In 2025, King Argentin won the Indonesian Triple Crown, becoming the fourth horse to do so after Mystere (1978),\n}} Manik Trisula (2002), and Djohar Manik (2014).\nBackground\nKing Argentin is a bay horse who was bred in Indonesia by King Halim Stable. He was foaled on August 25, 2021, in Ledug, Tretes, Pasuruan Regency, East Java. Sired by Agrippa, a son of Almuinjjid, out of Princess Misoni, a daughter of Long War, he is related to the champion Japanese racehorse T. M. Opera O through his sire's grandsire, Blushing Groom, and is a descendant of Secretariat.\nHe is currently trained by Farooq Ali Khan and regularly ridden by Jemmy Runtu.\nBreed\nKing Argentin, like most Indonesian racehorses, is not a thoroughbred, but instead a crossbreed between thoroughbreds and native sandalwood ponies. The resulting breeds are collectively known as Indonesian racing horses.\nKing Argentin, being a KP6, is the result of six generations of breeding a thoroughbred sire with a local dam.\nRacing career\n2025: two-year-old season\nIn April 2024, King Argentin debuted at Sultan Agung Racecourse in Bantul, Special Region of Yogyakarta, competing in the 800-meter sprint Class A/B race at the Piala Tiga Mahkota Seri 1 & Pertiwi Cup as a two-year-old colt. Though foaled in Pasuruan, East Java, he frequently represents West Java in competition.\n2025: three-year-old season\nIn the 2025 Jateng Derby, King Argentin crossed the finish line first in the 1,600-meter division. However, during the race, there was an incident involving his rival Milord, a top contender from North Sulawesi, where he collided with Salvator Minang, a contender from West Sumatra, resulting in a tragic accident where both horses died. Following the incident, the race committee declared the 1,600-meter division void, ruling that there would be no winner.\nAfter winning the first two legs of the Indonesian Triple Crown Series in 2025, King Argentin entered the Indonesia Derby with the chance of becoming the nation's fourth Triple Crown winner. Several recent contenders, including Queen Thalassa in 2019 and Bintang Maja in 2023, had failed to complete the series. In the history of Indonesian horseracing, only three horses had previously secured the title: Mystere in 1978, Manik Trisula in 2002, and Djohar Manik in 2014. King Argentin won the Indonesia Derby, thereby completing the Triple Crown and becoming the first horse to do so in 11 years.\nRacing form\nThe data below are mostly based on information available on livestreams from the  YouTube channel of Sarga.

The organizer Sarga.co later acknowledged this trend  and launched a fanart competition celebrating his victory  in the 2025 Indonesia Derby.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj1hoMtWFRE \"King Argentin: Star of the Decade\", short documentary by Sarga.co]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSH82X-3w1M \"Get To Know King Argentin, the 2025 Indonesia Triple Crown Winner, short documentary by Sarga.co\"]"
