In the packet networks, this act of forwarding is referred to as packet forwarding and is performed by network switches or network routers.\nFor example, in the tactical communications a data forwarder may forward data between:\n* links that are identical, i.e., TADIL B to TADIL B,\n* links that are similar, i.e., TADIL A to TADIL B, or\n* links that are dissimilar, i.e., TADIL A to TADIL J.\nMore than one source notes that routers and bridges can function as data forwarding devices.  Another source suggests, in fact, that gateways are a \"special type of data-forwarding device\".\nSee also\n* Repeater\nReferences\nMost of the content arises from:"
