It is 80,000 square feet and has three floors of exhibits and programs designed to be interactive and educational. It receives more than 265,000 visitors annually. The museum's focus is on children ages birth through 10 and their caregivers.\nThe museum is served by the Baltimore Metro Subway's Shot Tower/Market Place station.\nHistory\nThe original Baltimore Children's Museum was a Baltimore City agency founded in 1976 and was originally housed in The Cloisters, a historic property located in Baltimore County. The property and structure were donated to the City and the Museum operated out of this location for nearly 20 years. In 1990, the Baltimore Children's Museum formed its own 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation and merged with the Maryland Children's Museum. The merged entity's Board of Directors, along with Baltimore's Mayor Kurt Schmoke, decided to relocate the museum to downtown Baltimore to reach a broader audience. A 35-million dollar capital campaign, led by the Board of Directors, resulted in the renovation of Downtown's historic Fish Market building, which became the new home to Port Discovery Children's Museum in December 1998.\nThe building underwent major renovations in 2019. It added several new exhibits as well as a lunchroom and additional restrooms. The renovation cost $10.5 million.\nIn February 2022, the museum also functioned as a children's vaccine clinic for COVID-19.\nExhibits\n* SkyClimber\n* The Port\n* Art Showcase - a rotating art exhibits\n* BGE Studio Workshop\n* PD Presents\n* Tangram Wall\n* Chessie's Grotto\n* Kick It Up!\n* Royal Farms Convenience Store and Fill’er Up Station\n* Adventure Expeditions\n* The Oasis\n* Tot Trails\n* Over/Under Weaving Wall\n* Wonder Widgets\n* The Overlook\n* Previews, Pop-Ups & Prototypes\n* Sensory Wall\n* Tiny's Diner\n* Wonders of Water (WoW!)\n* Harvey M.
