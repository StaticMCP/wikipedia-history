During the Ottoman rule in the area, among other things, were the houses and shops of the local merchant Jakov Jazvo and his sons. After the arrival of the Austro-Hungarian rule area of the intersection of Split Street (westwards) and Travnik Street (eastwards) was named Stojan Platz after the Austrian army officer France Stojan who fought in the battles around Livno. During the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes square was renamed Square of Zrinski (Trg Zrinskog) and Travnik Street and Split Street were renamed to Street of Zrinski and King Peter Street.\nObelisk as a monument to the thousandth anniversary of the Kingdom of Croatia and the King Tomislav was erected in 1926 in the northern part of the Square. On the obelisk there is relief image of King Tomislav and an inscription in Croatian: U spomen hiljadugodišnjice prvog hrvatskog kralja Tomislava (925–1925) podigoše Hrvati sela i grada Livna. (In the memory of the thousand anniversary of the first Croatian king Tomislav (925–1925), the  Croats who built the village and the town of Livno.) After the construction of this monument square was renamed as King Tomislav Square\nFootnotes"
