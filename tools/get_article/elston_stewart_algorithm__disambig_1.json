It is due to Robert Elston and John Stewart.  It can handle relatively large pedigrees providing they are (almost) outbred.  When used for linkage analysis its computation time is exponential in the number of markers, in contrast to the Lander-Green algorithm, which has computational time exponential in the number of pedigree members.\nReferences\n*Elston, R.
