The Corps' commandant was Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. The school was closed in 1795 following the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising, which had been led by one of the Corps' first alumni, Tadeusz Kościuszko.\nIn the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski, several private corps of cadets were also established: by A. Tyzenhauz at Grodno, K. Radziwiłł at Nieśwież, W. Potocki at Niemirów, A. Sułkowski at Rydzyna.\nInterbellum\nIn the period between the two World Wars, the institution of the Corps of Cadets would be revived in Poland. Three state secondary schools of that name would be created: at Kraków (later at Lwów), at Modlin (later at Chełmno) and at Rawicz.\nAfter World War II\nAfter World War II, in the People's Republic of Poland, until 1956, there existed in Warsaw a Corps of Cadets of the Internal Security Corps (Korpus Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego).\nRevival\nThe original Corps' work is continued by Fundacja Szkoła Rycerska.\nNotable administrators\n* Michał Jan Hube, director and physicist\n* John Lind, governor and writer\nNotable alumni\n, member of the Corps' first class and its most famous alumnus]]\n* Tadeusz Kościuszko\n* Romuald Giedroyć\n* Jakub Jasiński\n* Hans Moritz Hauke\n* Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz\n* Karol Kniaziewicz\n* Kazimierz Nestor Sapieha\n* Józef Sowiński\n* Rajmund Rembieliński\nSee also\n* Academy of National Defence\n* Cadet Corps\n* Cadet Corps (disambiguation)\nNotes\nReferences\n*\"Korpusy kadetów\" (\"Corps of cadets\"), Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN (PWN Universal Encyclopedia), volume 2, Warsaw, Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1974, p.&nbsp;566."
