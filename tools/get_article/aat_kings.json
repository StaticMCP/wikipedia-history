In the 1930s they began to offer guided tours to Katoomba and Jenolan Caves. Tours were initially operated in seven-seater cars, until in 1935 when 14-seater coaches were introduced.\nIn 1973 Grenda's purchased Blue Line Tourist Coaches in Sydney and a Trans Australia Airlines / Mayne Nickless joint venture formed AAT Coachlines. In July 1975 AAT Coachlines purchased Pykes Tours and Grenda's coach businesses in Sydney and Melbourne.\nMeanwhile, in 1967, Bill King formed Bill King's Northern Safaris operating out of Melbourne with two Land Rovers, an ex Army International ambulance and a Denning from his father, who was the proprietor of Coburg-Heidelberg Omnibus Service.\nIn 1970 King purchased two larger ex Army International 4x4s and two M-series Bedford 4x4s. King later designed and designed his own 18 passenger Desert Cruiser vehicles on Bedford chassis, these were relocated to Alice Springs, and packaged tours were operated in association with Ansett Airlines.\nBy 1979 Bill King's Northern Safaris was operating 10 vehicles and had four Greyhound coaches on charter. At the same time AAT Coachlines had commenced operations in the Northern Territory with four new Dennings. In 1980 AAT purchased King's business with the tours were marketed as Bill King's Australian Adventure Tours, with King remaining as manager until 1985. Later both operations along with AAT Coachlines were merged to form AAT Kings.\nIn 1983 AAT Kings was purchased by Mayer Page and Geoff McGeary, proprietors of Australian Pacific Touring. In June 1993 the business was split with Page taking control of AAT Kings, and McGeary Australian Pacific Touring.\nIn 1997 AAT Kings was sold to The Travel Corporation.  In July 2012, AAT Kings purchased Australian Pacific Touring's Day Tours and Shorts Breaks divisions.\nIn August 2014, AAT Kings purchased a share in Down Under Tours, Cairns.\nIndigenous Culture\nAAT Kings has forged strong relationships with indigenous communities throughout Australia and New Zealand, including the Anangu people and Uluru Aboriginal Tours in Central Australia, as well as the  Tamaki Family Marae on the outskirts of Rotorua, New Zealand.
