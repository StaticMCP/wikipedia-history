New character options allow players to explore battlefield backgrounds, the magic of war, battle scars, and the benefits of working as a team. Campaign seeds help the Dungeon Master introduce the themes and events of the Last War in a current-day campaign or send characters back to their wartime days through flashbacks or actual time travel. A comprehensive overview of the Last War provides details on the events, armies, battlefields, and themes of Eberron's greatest clash of nations.\nPublication history\nThe Forge of War was written by James Wyatt, Ari Marmell, Wolfgang Baur, and published in June 2007. Cover art was by Wayne Reynolds, with interior art by David Bircham, Tomm Coker, Arnold Doong, Tomás Giorello, Fred Hooper, Ron Lemen, Howard Lyon, Lucio Parrillo, Jim Pavelec, Martina Pilcerova, Franz Vohwinkel, and James Zhang.\nReception\nReferences"
