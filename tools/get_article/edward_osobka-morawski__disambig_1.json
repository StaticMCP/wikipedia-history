Several months later, in June 1945, he was appointed Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of National Unity (Tymczasowy Rząd Jedności Narodowej), in office until February 1947. Osóbka-Morawski believed the PPS should join with the other non-communist party in Poland, the Polish Peasant Party, to form a united front against the Communist Polish Workers' Party.  However, another prominent socialist, Józef Cyrankiewicz argued that the PPS should support the communists while opposing the creation of a one-party state. The Communists, with Soviet support, played on this division and forced Osóbka-Morawski to resign in favour of Cyrankiewicz.\nOsóbka-Morawski would make his peace with the Communists, and gradually became a Stalinist. Nonetheless, in 1949 he was dismissed from his new post as the Minister of Public Administration, for \"deviationist\" tendencies. He was readmitted to the Communist Party, now called the Polish United Workers' Party, during the Polish October revolution of 1956. He then worked as a party official throughout most of his life in the People's Republic of Poland prior to the Revolutions of 1989, and in 1990 failed in his attempt to recreate the old Polish Socialist Party. He died in Warsaw in 1997.\nAwards and decorations\n*  Grand Cross of Order of Polonia Restituta (19 July 1946)\n*  Order of the Cross of Grunwald, 3rd Class (30 April 1944)\n*  Partisan Cross (12 June 1946)\n*  Medal for Warsaw 1939–1945\n*  Medal of Victory and Freedom 1945\n*  Grand Cross of Order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia, 1947)\n*  Order of People's Liberation (Yugoslavia, 1946)\nSee also\n* Stalinism in Poland\n* Socialist realism in Poland\nNotes and references"
