Yet more awards were created starting with the 2000–01 basketball season, when the EuroLeague Commercial Assets (ECA), essentially took over the management of the premier level European competition from FIBA Europe.\nEuroLeague awards\nFIBA European League Player of the Year\nThe FIBA European League (\"EuroLeague\") Player of the Year award was the award for the best player of each season of the top-tier level FIBA EuroLeague, which was organized by FIBA Europe.
