Located north of Cooperstown near County Highway 31, the Gothic Revival tower was designed by architect Henry J. Hardenbergh for  Singer Sewing Machine Company magnate Edward Clark in 1876, who built it \"to beautify the lake\" and \"provide construction jobs during an economic turndown\".\nThe property is still owned by his descendants, and is usually approachable only from the lake. A movie was made there in 1913.\nReferences\n* The Freeman's Journal (Cooperstown, Otsego County, N.Y.)
