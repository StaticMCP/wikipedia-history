These elections selected most of the 2,429 delegates to be sent to the Republican National Convention. Former president Donald Trump was nominated for president of the United States for a third consecutive election cycle.\nIn 2023, a crowded field of candidates emerged, including Trump, Florida governor Ron DeSantis, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, and wealth management executive Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump maintained a consistent lead in primary polling since the 2020 election. Among non-Trump candidates, DeSantis initially polled in a close second behind Trump, but his polling numbers steadily declined throughout 2023. Ramaswamy experienced a small polling bump in mid-2023, but this proved to be brief. Haley's campaign began attracting greater attention in the final months of 2023, though neither she nor any other candidate came close to Trump in polling. The Republican primaries were referred to as a \"race for second\" due to Trump's consistent lead in polls.\nAt the January 15 Iowa caucuses, Trump posted a landslide victory, with DeSantis narrowly beating out Haley for second place and Ramaswamy in a distant fourth. Following the Iowa caucuses, Ramaswamy and DeSantis dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, leaving Trump and Haley as the only remaining major candidates. Trump then defeated Haley in the January 23 New Hampshire primary, albeit by a smaller margin of victory than he achieved in Iowa; he defeated Haley again in the February 24 South Carolina primary, Haley's home state, a month later. After Trump's overwhelming victories nationwide on Super Tuesday, Haley suspended her campaign on March 6, having only won Vermont and Washington, D.C. Her victory in the Washington, D.C. primary on March 3, 2024, made her the first woman ever to win a Republican Party presidential primary contest.\nSome Republicans expressed concerns about Trump's candidacy due to his loss in 2020, his alleged role in inciting the January 6 Capitol attack, ongoing criminal cases against him, and the results of the 2022 midterms in which several Trump-endorsed candidates lost key races; many others supported him and decried the investigations as politically motivated, and Trump maintained high favorability ratings among Republican voters. Trump's eligibility to appear on the ballot was challenged by some voters and political leaders in Colorado, Maine and Illinois; these efforts were rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in a unanimous decision. Trump became the presumptive nominee on March 12, with his victory in the Washington primary bringing him over the 1,215 delegate threshold needed to clinch the nomination.\nOn July 15, 2024, Trump and his running mate, U.S. Senator from Ohio JD Vance, were officially nominated as the Republican presidential and vice presidential candidates at the Republican National Convention. Trump became the first person to be the Republican nominee in three consecutive elections, and the second three-time Republican nominee, after Richard Nixon (1960, 1968, 1972). The Trump-Vance ticket won the general election on November 5, defeating the Democratic Party ticket of incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota governor Tim Walz.\nResults\nPopular Vote\nWrite-in vote totals are excluded from the above election data reporting for the following states, and are added to the total number of votes for candidates for the purposes of candidate vote share calculations:\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}\n{| style=\"float:right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; border: 1px solid #a2a9b1; color: black; background-color: #f8f9fa; padding:0.2em;\"\n|+ Map legend\n|-\n|\n| Nikki Haley\n|-\n|\n| Donald Trump\n|-\n|\n| Winner not yet declared\n|-\n|\n| None of These Candidates\n|}\nFile:Republican Party presidential primaries results, 2024.svg|First-place winners of each state\nFile:2024 Republican Party presidential primaries results by county.svg\nCandidates\nDuring the 2024 election season, over 400 candidates filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for the Republican presidential nomination.\nNominee\n}}\nWithdrew during the primaries\n}}\nOther candidates\n* Ryan Binkley, pastor and businessman from Texas (withdrew February 27, 2024; endorsed Trump)\n*John Anthony Castro, tax consultant and perennial candidate from Texas\n* E.

Trump was the first former president to run for president after leaving office since Herbert Hoover did so in 1940. When he won the Republican nomination, he became the first Republican to be nominated for president three separate times since Richard Nixon (Republican nominee in 1960, 1968, and 1972). After winning the general election, Trump became the only president other than Grover Cleveland to serve two non-consecutive terms.\n2023\nFebruary 2023\nOn February 14, former South Carolina governor and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley released a video announcing her presidential candidacy.\nOn February 21, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy announced his presidential candidacy on Tucker Carlson Tonight.\nMarch 2023\nOn March 2, businessman Perry Johnson, who had been deemed ineligible to appear on the Republican primary ballot in the 2022 Michigan gubernatorial election due to allegedly fraudulent signatures, announced his intent to run for president in 2024.\nApril 2023\nOn April 2, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson announced his candidacy during an interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl.

Trump remained on the ballot pending an appeal. The Colorado Republican Party is considering holding a caucus in place of the state-sanctioned primary if the decision stands.\nOn December 22, CBS reported that Donald Trump was inquiring within his campaign and with his allies over the possibility of tapping Nikki Haley for his running mate. This came shortly after a poll which showed Haley in second place in Iowa with 29% to Trump's 44%. In response, senior members of the Trump circle, including Donald Trump Jr., Roger Stone, and Tucker Carlson, all rejected the idea.\nOn December 28, Maine followed Colorado in prohibiting former President Trump from appearing on its ballots, though it was stayed pending an appeal.\nOn December 29, an effort in Virginia to prohibit former President Trump from appearing on their ballots by two social justice activists, Roy Perry-Bey and Carlos Howard, was dismissed by Leonie Brinkema, judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, due to the pair lacking standing to sue Trump under Virginia law.\n2024\nJanuary 2024\nOn January 5, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump's appeal of his removal from the Colorado ballot.\nOn January 9, Gloria Navarro, judge for the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, rejected an effort in Nevada to block former President Trump from appearing on the state's ballots by John Anthony Castro. Navarro stated that Castro, a resident of Texas who cited the 14th Amendment in the case, does not have the standing to sue Trump under Nevada law. The point was largely moot, as the lawsuit would have barred Trump from appearing on the Nevada primary. Trump and the Nevada Republican Party had boycotted the state-organized primary in favor of a GOP-organized caucus.\nOn January 10, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie withdrew from the race. The fifth Republican presidential debate was held at Drake University in Des Moines, hosted by CNN.

The departure of DeSantis left Trump and Haley as the only remaining major candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.\nOn January 23, Trump won the New Hampshire primary, defeating Haley by a margin of 54.3%-43.3%.\nOn January 30, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that Trump had reached out to him in April 2023 about becoming his vice president pick. Kennedy indicated that he was flattered, but that he had refused Trump's offer. In response, a senior Trump advisor, Chris LaCivita, denied the exchange ever took place.\nFebruary 2024\nDuring a February 4 an interview with Fox News, Trump outlined a list of criteria his running mate would have to meet and mentioned Tim Scott and Kristi Noem as two examples of potential running mates.\nOn February 6, the Nevada primary took place. The primary was boycotted by the Nevada Republican Party in favor of the Nevada caucuses. As a consequence, Trump was not a candidate in the primary, while Haley was not in the caucus.

Griswold that he was ineligible under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment due to his role in the January 6, 2021, United States Capitol attack. On December 28, 2023, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows ruled that Trump was ineligible, also citing section 3 of the 14th Amendment. However, Bellows stayed her own ruling pending the results of a challenge in court. On February 28, a Cook County judge, Tracie Porter, ordered the removal of Trump from the ballot in Illinois, also citing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\nOn March 4, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a unanimous 9–0 ruling that the efforts by the Colorado Supreme Court, under orders of the Colorado Attorney general, to have Trump barred from the ballot, were unconstitutional as that decision can only be made by the United States Congress, and that Trump must be reinstated on the ballot.\nOverview\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:11/01/2022 till:08/31/2024\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightline unit:month increment:1 start:11/01/2022\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkline unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/2023\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbar:Trump\nbar:Haley\nbar:DeSantis\nbar:Hutchinson\nbar:Ramaswamy\nbar:Christie\nbar:Burgum\nbar:Scott\nbar:Pence\nbar:Elder\nbar:Johnson\nbar:Hurd\nbar:Suarez\nPlotData=\nwidth:15 fontsize:S textcolor:black anchor:till shift:(10,-4)\nbar:Christie\nfrom:06/06/2023 till:01/10/2024 color:withdrawn text:\"Christie\"\nbar:DeSantis\nfrom:05/24/2023 till:01/21/2024 color:Withdrawn text:\"DeSantis\"\nbar:Haley\nfrom:02/14/2023 till:03/06/2024 color:Withdrawn text:\"Haley\"\nbar:Hutchinson\nfrom:04/06/2023 till:01/16/2024 color:Withdrawn text:\"Hutchinson\"\nbar:Ramaswamy\nfrom:02/21/2023 till:01/15/2024 color:Withdrawn text:\"Ramaswamy\"\nbar:Trump\nfrom:11/15/2022 till:07/18/2024 color:Active text:\"Trump\"\nbar:Burgum\nfrom:06/07/2023 till:12/04/2023 color:withdrawn text:\"Burgum\"\nbar:Scott\nfrom:04/12/2023 till:05/19/2023 color:Planning\nfrom:05/19/2023 till:11/12/2023 color:withdrawn text:\"Scott\"\nbar:Pence\nfrom:06/05/2023 till:10/28/2023 color:withdrawn text:\"Pence\"\nbar:Elder\nfrom:04/20/2023 till:10/26/2023 color:withdrawn text:\"Elder\"\nbar:Johnson\nfrom:03/02/2023 till:10/20/2023 color:withdrawn text:\"Johnson\"\nbar:Hurd\nfrom:06/22/2023 till:10/09/2023 color:Withdrawn text:\"Hurd\"\nbar:Suarez\nfrom:06/14/2023 till:08/29/2023 color:Withdrawn text:\"Suarez\"\nLineData=\nlayer:front at:11/08/2022 width:0.6 color:purple\nlayer:front at:08/23/2023 width:0.9 color:orange\nlayer:front at:09/27/2023 width:0.9 color:orange\nlayer:front at:11/08/2023 width:0.9 color:orange\nlayer:front at:12/06/2023 width:0.9 color:orange\nlayer:front at:01/10/2024 width:0.9 color:orange\nlayer:front at:01/15/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:01/23/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:02/06/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:02/24/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:03/05/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:03/12/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:03/19/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:04/02/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:04/23/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:04/30/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:05/07/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:05/14/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:05/21/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:06/04/2024 width:0.6 color:state\nlayer:front at:07/15/2024 width:2.25 color:green\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#F50000;\"|\n| Active campaign\n| style=\"background:#FFFF00;\"|\n| Exploratory committee\n| style=\"background:#B24C4C;\"|\n| Withdrawn candidate\n| rowspan=2; style=\"background:#4FAF32;\"|\n| rowspan=2; |Republican National Convention\n|-\n| style=\"background:purple;\"|\n| Midterm elections\n| style=\"background:orange;\"|\n| Debates\n| style=\"background:#0000FF;\"|\n| Primaries\n|}\nBallot access\nDebates\nand Nikki Haley at the CNN Republican Presidential Debate in Des Moines, Iowa.]]\nThe first Republican debate was held on August 23, 2023, hosted by Fox News and moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.

They specify that all must occur between March and June 11, 2024 – except for Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina – which are allowed to hold contests in February. Iowa chose to hold its caucus the earliest in over a decade, on a federal holiday – January 15 – as the rules are not legally binding.\nNevada controversy\nAfter the 2020 presidential election, the Democratic-controlled Nevada Legislature moved to establish a presidential primary for the Republican and Democratic parties. Previously, party-organized caucuses were used in Nevada to determine delegates in presidential elections.\nIn May 2023, the Nevada Republican Party sued the state of Nevada in an effort to continue the use of caucuses as the means to determine its delegate allocation. The Nevada Attorney General's office stated that the Nevada Republican Party was allowed to choose between a primary or caucus, since the primary is non-binding and because state law does not mandate specific rules governing how political parties are to choose its candidate for president.\nOn August 14, 2023, the Nevada Republican Party announced it would hold its caucuses on February 8, while the February 6 state primary would not be binding.\nMichigan controversy\nThe Michigan primaries were originally scheduled to be held in March in accordance with Republican Party rules. Democrats, who were in control of the Michigan legislature and governorship after the 2022 midterm elections, moved up both primaries as part of their own 2024 presidential delegate selection plan. As a result, the earlier date of February 27 violates Republican rules – which state that only Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina can vote earlier than March 1, 2024.\nRepublicans in Michigan have criticized Democrats in Michigan for their unilateral move. Eventually, the Republicans held a primary on February 27 and a caucus on March 2.\nDelegates\nThere will be an estimated total of 2,467 delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention. In contests until March 15, delegates must be awarded on a proportional basis, either by percentage of statewide vote or share of congressional districts won. Some states have established thresholds between 4 and 20% for proportionality to kick in, under which a candidate receives no delegates. A vast majority, 41 contests totaling 1,920 delegates, operate this way using methods that are hybrid between proportionality and majority-take-all. New York for example has a 20% threshold for proportionality but if a candidate wins a majority, they take all delegates.\nNorth Dakota, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Virgin Islands, and 51 of Pennsylvania's 67 delegates are unpledged (free to vote for anyone at the convention), totaling 119. Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, Colorado, Arizona, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Montana's delegates are strictly awarded on a plurality-take-all basis, totaling 428. It will be possible for a candidate to take all 928 delegates of 19 contests by simply winning a threshold of votes.\nBy Super Tuesday, over 40% of delegates will have been awarded, and most by March 19. Republican Party rules mandate changes to delegate allocation methods happen by September 30. The primaries will conclude with a final vote on the nominee by a majority of delegates, at the newly elected Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which will be held July 15–18.\nAccording to the current rules of the Republican Party, no candidate can have their name placed into nomination, thereby earning television airtime at the Republican National Convention, unless he or she has received a plurality of delegates in at least five states (the rules state that \"'state' or 'states' shall be taken to include American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands\").\nSee also\n* 2024 Republican National Convention\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 Democratic National Convention\nNotes\nReferences"
