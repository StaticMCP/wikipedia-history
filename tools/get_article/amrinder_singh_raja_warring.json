He is a Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha and president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee.\nPolitical career\nWarring was the president of the Indian Youth Congress, the youth division of Indian National Congress, from December 2014 to May 2018.\nMLA: first term\nWarring was elected as a Member of Legislative Assembly from Gidderbaha from 2012–2017, district Sri Muktsar Sahib, Punjab to the Punjab Legislative Assembly.\nMLA: second term\nIn March 2017, he was re-elected as an MLA for the second successive time, after completing his first term from 2012–2017. He served as the Transport Minister in the Punjab government.\nWarring contested from Bathinda constituency in the  2019 Indian general election against Harsimrat Kaur Badal but lost the elections by over 20,000 votes.\nMLA: third term\nDuring the campaign for the 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election, Warring sang songs and danced during his public meetings. His associates said this was done \"to strike a chord with commoners\". He won the election. The Aam Aadmi Party gained a strong 79% majority in the sixteenth Punjab Legislative Assembly by winning 92 out of 117 seats in the 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election. MP Bhagwant Mann was sworn in as Chief Minister on 16 March 2022.\nOn 9 April 2022, Warring was appointed by the national leadership of Congress as the chief of Congress in Punjab.\nMP: first term\nIn June, Warring won the 2024 Indian general election from Ludhiana Lok Sabha constituency and was elected as a Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha by defeating his nearest competitor, Ravneet Singh Bittu of the Bharatiya Janata Party by a margin of 20,942 votes.\nFamily\nBorn to Kuldeep Singh and Malkeet Kaur, he lost his parents when he was still a child, and was brought up by his maternal uncles. He is married to Amrita Singh, and he has a son and a daughter. She is a INC candidate in the upcoming state by-polls. He was earlier known as Raja Sotha, with Sotha being the name of his maternal village. Later, he began using the name of his paternal village called Warring.\nCorruption charges in Bus Body Building Scam\nIn June 2022, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) demanded a CBI probe, claiming Raja Warring, while serving as Punjab’s Transport Minister, caused heavy losses to the state by awarding overpriced bus body construction contracts. RTI responses suggested that instead of procuring bus bodies locally for ₹8.20–8.40 lakh, contracts were given to a Jaipur-based firm at ₹11.98 lakh per bus, involving a total of 840 buses. This allegedly caused a loss of approximately ₹4 lakh per bus, plus an additional ₹1.51 crore in transportation costs and ₹18 crore in taxes a cumulative estimated loss of around ₹60 crore.\nAccording to reports from the Rozana spokesman, the Vigilance Bureau initiated a probe into Raja Warring’s tenure. It flagged irregularities such as issuing numerous route permits to private operators and associates. The Bureau questioned why local bus body fitting—typically costing ₹4–7 lakh—was bypassed in favor of the much higher ₹11.98 lakh per body contracts. This was estimated to have caused a loss of around ₹100 crore to the Punjab Transport Department.\nPolitical Life\nHe rose into prominence in 2022, when he was made the Punjab Pardesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief, right before Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra.\nAfter his elevation in the state, during his public interaction across the state and at the PPCC office, he was seen wearing bright-coloured turban. Though Warring at the time denied that his decision to tie turban had any political tone, party insiders said it was a message for his adversaries - on who is the party leader in the state. It is said that he started wearing turban to show his leadership and aim for bigger role in state politics.\nIn 2024, he made a controversial statement that - \"Those leading the (Akal) Takht are people of Sukhbir Badal.\" Sukhbir Badal at the time was leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal, a party which was erstwhile ally of BJP and in strong opposition to Congress.\nIn 2025, Punjab Congress president Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, in an ongoing tussle within its I.N.D.I.A. alliance parties, demanded resignation of its own partner Aam Adami Party's (AAP) Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann. He said that - \"...accountability be fixed in the Majitha hooch tragedy, which involved illegal country liquor distribution and consumption, that took several lives in the Amritsar district.\" He termed these 27 deaths as 'cold-blooded murders' blaming it on AAP government.\nReferences\nExternal links"
