      "text": "# 2023 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 2023 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 63rd in the National Football League (NFL), their eighth playing their home games at U.S. Bank Stadium and their second under the head coach/general manager tandem of Kevin O'Connell and Kwesi Adofo-Mensah.\nThey started 0–3 for the second time in the past four seasons. They failed to improve upon their 13–4 record from 2022 after a Week 5 loss to the eventual back to back Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and match that record with a Week 11 loss to the Broncos. However, after having a 1–4 record, the Vikings would win 5 games straight, going to a 6–4 record. During Minnesota's Week 8 game against their division rival, the Green Bay Packers, starting quarterback Kirk Cousins ruptured his achilles tendon, ruling him out for the rest of the season. They went through a quarterback carousel for the rest of the season, going 1–6 in their last 7 games including 4 straight losses to end the season. In Week 16, they were knocked out of division contention following a loss to the Detroit Lions, and in Week 18, they were eliminated from playoff contention after losing to the Lions again.\nFor the first time since 2012, wide receiver Adam Thielen was not on the roster, as he was released on March 10. Additionally, for the first time since 2016, four-time Pro Bowl running back Dalvin Cook was not on the roster, as he was released on June 9. This was also the first season after the death of legendary coach and team advisor Bud Grant on March 11.\nOffseason\nAdditions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| Player\n!style=\"\"| Former team\n!style=\"\"| Date\n|-\n|WR\n|Brandon Powell\n|Los Angeles Rams\n|Signed on March 22\n|-\n|LB\n|Troy Reeder\n|Los Angeles Chargers\n|Signed on March 22\n|-\n|TE\n|Josh Oliver\n|Baltimore Ravens\n|Signed on March 15\n|-\n|DE\n|Dean Lowry\n|Green Bay Packers\n|Signed on March 20\n|-\n|OLB\n|Marcus Davenport\n|New Orleans Saints\n|Signed on March 15\n|-\n|CB\n|Byron Murphy\n|Arizona Cardinals\n|Signed on March 15\n|-\n|CB\n|Joejuan Williams\n|New England Patriots\n|Signed on April 17\n|}\nSubtractions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| Player\n!style=\"\"| New team\n!style=\"\"| Date\n|-\n|WR\n|Adam Thielen\n|Carolina Panthers\n|Released on March 10\n|-\n|LB\n|Eric Kendricks\n|Los Angeles Chargers\n|Released on March 6\n|-\n|TE\n|Irv Smith Jr.\n|Cincinnati Bengals\n|\n|-\n|CB\n|Kris Boyd\n|Arizona Cardinals\n|\n|-\n|CB\n|Cameron Dantzler\n|Washington Commanders\n|\n|-\n|CB\n|Chandon Sullivan\n|Pittsburgh Steelers\n|\n|-\n|CB\n|Patrick Peterson\n|Pittsburgh Steelers\n|\n|-\n|CB\n|Duke Shelley\n|Las Vegas Raiders\n|\n|-\n|OLB\n|Za'Darius Smith\n|Cleveland Browns\n|Traded on May 16\n|-\n|DT\n|Dalvin Tomlinson\n|Cleveland Browns\n|\n|-\n|C\n|Greg Mancz\n|Buffalo Bills\n|Released on January 14\n|-\n|RB\n|Dalvin Cook\n|New York Jets\n|Released on June 9\n|}\n2023 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2023 Minnesota Vikings draft selections\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round !!style=\"\"| Selection !!style=\"\"| Player !!style=\"\"| Position !!style=\"\"| College !!style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n! 1 || 23\n| Jordan Addison || WR || USC ||\n|-\n! 2 || 55\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Detroit Lions ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 3 || 87\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the San Francisco 49ers}} ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 102\n| Mekhi Blackmon || CB || USC || From 49ers\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 4 || 119\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Kansas City Chiefs ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| From Lions\n|-\n! 126\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Cleveland Browns ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 134\n| Jay Ward || S || LSU || From Chiefs\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 5 || 141\n| Jaquelin Roy || DT || LSU || From Colts\n|-\n! 158\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Indianapolis Colts ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 164\n| Jaren Hall || QB || BYU || From 49ers\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 6 || 201\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Houston Texans ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|-\n! 211\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Indianapolis Colts ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Compensatory pick\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 7 || 219\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Philadelphia Eagles ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| From Texans\n|-\n! 222\n| DeWayne McBride || RB || UAB || From 49ers\n|-\n! 241\n|colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"| Traded to the Denver Broncos ||style=\"background:#BFBFBF\"|\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2023 Minnesota Vikings undrafted free agents\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| College\n!style=\"\"| Ref.\n|-\n| Junior Aho\n| OLB\n| SMU (IPP)\n|\n|-\n| Alan Ali\n| C\n| TCU\n|rowspan=\"9\"|\n|-\n| Calvin Avery\n| DT\n| Illinois\n|-\n| Abraham Beauplan\n| MLB\n| Marshall\n|-\n| Andre Carter II\n| OLB\n| Army\n|-\n| Jacky Chen\n| OT\n| Pace\n|-\n| C.
