He formed the Campaign for Social Democracy as an attempt to build a radical non-doctrinaire social democratic movement, and at the February 1974 general election they stood four candidates against leading Labour left-wingers, including Tony Benn.\nAll candidates were unsuccessful, with the highest polling at 2.4% of the vote in their constituency. The campaign ended when the Labour Party won the October 1974 United Kingdom general election, making a split in the Labour Party less likely. Such a split did occur in the early-1980s, when leading moderates in the Labour Party formed the Social Democratic Party.\nElection results\nThe party's results were:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
