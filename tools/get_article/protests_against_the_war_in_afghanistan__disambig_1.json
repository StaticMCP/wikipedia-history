The continuation of the war in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021 lead to further protest and opposition to hostilities.\n2001\nOn September 29, 2001, as many as 20,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., United States, denouncing the impending United States invasion of Afghanistan. The protests were organized by the recently formed A.N.S.W.E.R. coalition. Thousands of protesters gathered at Meridian Hill Park (Malcolm X Park) and marched downtown, while elsewhere members of the Anti-Capitalist Convergence clashed briefly with police on their way to Edward R.

Sporting buttons that said \"Don't Turn Tragedy into War\" and \"Our Grief Is Not a Cry for War\", many protesters argued that the attacks were not an act of war but a criminal act to be dealt with through the international justice system.\nOn October 7, 2001, 10,000 to 12,000 people turned out in New York City to oppose the Bush administration's so-called war on terror. The group marched from Union Square to Times Square, cheering the police at the beginning of the march. The list of about twelve speakers was cut to three or four by the police, and they were herded at the end into a one-lane-wide \"bullpen\".\nOn October 13, 2001, more than 20,000 people joined the UK's biggest protest yet against military action in Afghanistan by the United States and its allies.

As the demonstration fell during Ramadan, an element of prayer was included in the final rally to allow pious Muslims to observe their faith. Headlining speakers included human rights campaigner Bianca Jagger, Labour Party veteran Tony Benn, Labour MP George Galloway, and speakers of Muslim faith.\nMember of Parliament Paul Marsden told the rally:\nOrganiser Lindsey German said the bombing campaign had done nothing to tackle international terrorism.\nAt the time the protest was the largest peace demonstration in more than twenty years.\n2002\nOn April 20, 2002, 75,000 people marched in Washington, D.C. against U.S. militarism and foreign policy in the largest peace presence since the war began the previous fall. The April 20th Mobilization to Stop the War, a coalition of many groups, held a rally just south of the Washington Monument. Another protest focusing on perceived Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people was held near the White House, while a third protest focusing on the policies of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund took place near the headquarters of those institutions. The three rallies then converged together in a march up Pennsylvania Avenue to the United States Capitol in the largest anti-war demonstration to take place in Washington since the Gulf War more than a decade ago.\nProtesters denounced the bombing of Afghan civilians and carried signs and banners reading, \"No blank check for endless war,\" \"Criminals in the White House again\" and \"War without an end. Not in our name.\"\nSome of the most moving speeches opposing the U.S.'s aggression were given by family members of victims of the terrorist attacks on September 11. Derril Bodley, who lost a daughter on September 11, said he had travelled to Afghanistan to call for an end to the \"barbarous bombing campaign there.\" Just a few days after his daughter's death he spoke out against the possibility of war, saying, \"Don't kill more innocent people in the name of my daughter.\" He said thousands were suffering and dying by the \"perpetration of an aimless war.\"\nAnother speaker, Michael Ratner, a human rights lawyer and president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of prisoners captured in Afghanistan were being held at the U.S.'s military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba:\nAnother 15,000 to 20,000 people marched in San Francisco in a simultaneous protest on the West Coast, and demonstrations also took place in a number of other American cities.\n2005\nOn August 17, 2005, over 1,000 people took part in a vigil in Minneapolis-Saint Paul to protest the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
