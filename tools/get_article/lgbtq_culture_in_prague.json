Prague is also a host of the Mezipatra Queer Film Festival.\nAccording to Frommer's, the Vinohrady neighborhood is \"particularly gay-friendly\". Lonely Planet says, \"Prague is a relatively tolerant destination for gay and lesbian travellers\".\nFor those who are critical of the commercial and mainstream aspect of the main Prague Pride, Alt*Pride, organized at the same time in August, is another way to get involved. Alt*Pride’s aim is also to explore crucial issues, such as ethnicity and class, which unfortunately are not given as much attention at the main pride event.\nReferences"
