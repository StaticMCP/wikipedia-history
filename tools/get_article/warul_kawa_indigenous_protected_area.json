The protected area and island are the most north westerly of the Torres Strait Islands located in the water of Torres Strait, part of Queensland in Australia, and  from Indonesia, at the border of Papua province.\nGeology\nIt is a sand cay surrounded by a shallow reef platform interspersed with sandy patches, with little live coral present.\nBrown and Green algae are predominating on the rocky substrate with some seagrass present. The island and surrounding reef support two internationally significant populations of sea turtles. It contains one of the largest rookeries for the Flatback turtle (Natator depressus). The extensive shallow water habitats in the area also support large numbers of migrating green turtles. The breeding assemblages in north and eastern Australia are the largest remaining rookeries for green turtles. The island and surrounding reef system have retained their high natural value due largely to their remoteness. Although Warul Kawa has been inhabited periodically by Europeans in the past, there has been little impact on the natural environment as evident by the presence of only two-recorded exotic plant species. The area has maintained high vegetation integrity of considerable diversity and complexity. These habitats support thirty-three species of birds, including the yellow-footed scrubfowl, not reported on many other islands in Torres Strait.\nCultural significance\nDue to the spiritual and cultural significance that the island has for local Indigenous people, Deliverance Island was declared an Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) in February 2001. The local Indigenous name for the island, Warul Kawa, means \"Island of turtles\" in the Torres Strait Island language.\nSomerset Maugham's character German Harry from his book Cosmopolitans, a Danish mariner from Langebæk who was in fact known as Old Harry but christened as Johannes Henrik Enevoldsen (22 August 1850 – 21 January 1928), lived on the island as a hermit from about 1888 until his death.\nSee also\n}}\n* Indigenous Protected Areas\n* List of Torres Strait Islands\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\nSignificant agreement/treaty\n* [http://www.atns.net.au/biogs/A000500b.htm Warul Kawa (Deliverance Island) Financial Assistance Agreement]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060520010451/http://www.atns.net.au/biogs/A000463b.htm Warul Kawa Indigenous Protected Area (2001 - )]"
