The minister of the King also has said to have given offering to the viharaya.\nIn the Polonnaruwa period the monarch mentioned as King Vijayabahu I restored the viharaya since its construction.\nAccording to the Archaelogist Cyril Nicholas a residence for the resting of monks was built in the name of Kurundacullaka near the viharaya.}}\nVandalizing of the viharaya\nAccording to the Ceylon archaeologist John Penry Lewis in his published journal in 1895 he quotes: }}\nFurther more according to the archaeology commissioner H.C.P Bell in 1905 quotes on the archaeology survey of northern and central provinces which he quotes:\n|source=}}\nMany Buddhist temples in the north and east has been vandalized, destroyed or turned into kovils by the later Tamil residents.\nModern day issue\nBuddhist monks and residents of north was forced to leave due to unrest created in the area by Tamil extremists due to Tamil nationalism around the late century.\nNorth of Sri Lanka was unable to enter due to LTTE occupation and after the war was over, the archaeological department resurveyed the area and in 2013 the site was declared as a protected archaeological site but in 2018 the archaeological department and the TNA (political party) with some locals came into a dispute regarding the site, which they claimed the site was a Siva temple and had threatened the Buddhist priest and other workers from the archaeological department and they were able to temporarily stop any works in the site by filing a complaint to the Mullaitivu court by claiming any further excavations in the site will lead to a unrest among the citizens in the north of Sri Lanka.\nBefore the end of 2020 the Mullaitivu court gave permission to the archaeological department to continue their work and around 2021 completing of the conservation of the viharaya was planned but during the placing of Buddhist relics in the viharaya was disturbed by TNA and some locals into the site by claiming it as their “Homeland” and this site is actually a “Ancient Hindu kovil.”\nIn 2023 the archaeological department declared 229 acres surrounding the viharaya to be considered to be part of the kurundi archaeological site giving a total acres of 400, since archaeological artifacts have been found in these places, again the archaeological work was blocked by locals claiming that Sivalingam and a Hindu deity that was worshipped by the locals were taken away by archeological department workers.\nArchaeologist and a monk, Venerable Ellawala Medhananda Thera declined the claims of the locals that the surrounding area of the viharaya was paddy lands and the Tamil locals had harvested before the war which is further supported by the past archeological surveys done in the site.\nReferences"
