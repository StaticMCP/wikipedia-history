It’s not about collaboration on the same task or project, but rather about developing accountability, shared presence, and structure while working independently.\nVirtual co-working started gaining popularity during the COVID-20 pandemic when large parts of the working population stopped going to physical office spaces due to government guidelines and lockdowns. Platforms, such as FLOWN and Flowclub, emerged to specifically address this need.\nWho is virtual co-working for\nVirtual co-working can benefit a large number of workers but particularly addresses the needs of two groups:\n* Remote workers (professionals, freelancers, entrepreneurs or students) in need of structure, accountability and social presence.\n* Individuals with ADHD or executive function challenges, who benefit from body doubling without needing to coordinate physical meetings.\nWhat techniques does virtual co-working use?\nAt its core, virtual co-working is about working together separately — participants log into a shared virtual space, work alongside each other, silently or not, and hold one another accountable in real time. This setup taps into the “body doubling” technique — having someone present (virtually or physically) boosts focus and motivation, especially for individuals with ADHD. It's a modern, accessible version of a practice gaining traction both within neurodivergent communities and more broadly.\nNeural and psychological underpinnings\nAt a deeper level, virtual co-working leverages principles like social accountability, mirror neuron-driven mimicry, and structured goal-setting to enhance performance. Studies have shown that social pressure can increase performance by 16-32%. It has also been shown that sharing a goal increases the likelihood of completing it by 65%. Psychological benefits include task prioritization, reduced inertia, and emotional reinforcement.\nBenefits of virtual co-working\nEnhanced focus and productivity\nVirtual co-working taps into subtle social accountability that encourages you to start and stay on task. This mirrors the well-known social facilitation effect, where being observed, even virtually, can enhance performance. The presence of others has been shown to significantly increase the speed on simple tasks by a mean effect size of d = 0.32.\nReduced isolation\nRemote work often leads to decreased spontaneous social connection, which can negatively affect mental health. Research shows that loneliness and lack of integration are strong predictors of poor well-being. Virtual co-working can recreate aspects of an office environment—like shared norms and silent companionship—to foster a sense of connection. It's described as a “pseudo‑office environment” that helps reduce isolation, improve accountability, and support work structure.\nSupport for ADHD and executive function challenges\nThe mere presence of another person — physically or virtually — can help individuals with ADHD initiate tasks and resist distraction by providing external structure and motivation Although broader scientific research is still limited, many users and mental health professionals report substantial benefits. ADHD coaches have noted improved focus, reduced procrastination, and enhanced motivation from practitioners using virtual co-working and body doubling sessions.\nTypes of virtual co-working\nThere are a variety of platforms that offer virtual co-working with several types and formats of sessions:\n* Silent, open-ended sessions: Platforms like FLOWN offer “Drop‑in” rooms where users enter anytime, work quietly, and exit when done.\n* Structured sessions: These involve sessions with predetermined durations (e.g., 50-minute sprints), goal sharing and timers – common in platforms like FLOWN, Focusmate and FlowClub.\n* Peer‑led vs. facilitated: Focusmate relies on peep-to-peer accountability sessions while FLOWN and FlowClub feature guided sessions by hosts and facilitators.\n* On-demand sessions: Pre-recorded body doubling videos can be used as indirect virtual co-working sessions.\nReferences"
