His instrument, a Gibson RB-11 5-string banjo, is now in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Along with Kyle Creed, Wade Ward is known for his 'Galax' style of playing the clawhammer banjo.\nBiography\nBenjamin, \"Uncle,\" Wade Ward was born in Independence Virginia on October 15th, 1892. Ward was an award winning clawhammer banjo player and won first place in the Galax, Virginia Old Time Fiddler's Convention eight times between the years and 1936 and 1968.\nHe was the youngest of nine siblings born to Enoch Ward and Rosamond Ward. Ward began playing the banjo when he was 11 years old. His older brother, Davy Crockett Ward, who was 20 years his senior, taught him the skill. In addition to playing banjo, Ward also played fiddle. In August of 1913, Ward married Lelia Mathews. They had at least two children together before her death in 1951. He remarried in 1954 to Mollie Yates.\nWard began performing in public in 1919, at age 26. His first group, the Buck Mountain Band, included Van Edwards on fiddle and Van's son Earl on guitar.  In 1925, Ward recorded four solo tunes (unreleased) for the Okeh label during a field recording session in Asheville, North Carolina.  In October 1929 he and the Buck Mountain Band recorded four more tunes for Okeh in Richmond, Virginia, two of which were released.  In addition to playing with the Buck Mountain Boys, Ward was employed by the Parsons Auction Company. He performed for their Saturday sales for 51 years.\nIn the early 1930s, Ward joined a band called the Ballard Branch Bogtrotters, formed by his older brother Crockett. Ward played banjo, Crockett and his neighbor Alec \"Uncle Eck\" Dunford played fiddles, Crockett's son Fields played guitar and sang, and the Wards' family doctor W. P. Davis managed the group and occasionally played autoharp.  Folklorist John A. Lomax discovered the group in 1937 at the Galax Fiddlers' Convention and recorded them for the Library of Congress. John's son Alan Lomax recorded Wade in 1939, 1941, and again in 1959; nearly 200 recordings of Ward are archived at the Library of Congress' American Folklife Center.  Other folklorists including Mike Seeger and Peter Hoover made additional field recordings in the 1950s and 1960s.  The Bogtrotters appeared at festivals during the folk revivals of the 40s and 50s.\nDespite his musical gifts, Ward made his living as a farmer. He died on May 29th, 1971 in Independence, Virginia, and is buried in the Saddle Creek Primitive Baptist Church Cemetery a few miles west of town.\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n||Year\n||Title\n||Label\n||Number\n||Notes\n|-\n|1929||\"Don't Let the Blues Get You Down\" / \"Yodeling Blues\"||Okeh||45428||78 rpm\n|-\n|1962||Music of Roscoe Holcomb and Wade Ward||Folkways|| F-2363||\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1968||Fields and Wade Ward: Country Music||Biograph||RC-6002||\n|-\n|The Original Bog Trotters||Biograph||RC-6003||\n|-\n|1972||Uncle Wade - A Memorial To Wade Ward: Old Time Virginia Banjo Picker, 1892-1971||Folkways||F-2380||\n|-\n|2004||Uncle Charlie Higgins, Wade Ward & Dale Poe ||Field Recorders' Collective||FRC-501||Recorded 1959\n|-\n|2007||Wade Ward: Banjo & Fiddle||Field Recorders' Collective||FRC-507||Recorded 1959–1961\n|}\n*Many other recordings by Wade Ward have been released on compilation albums from Smithsonian Folkways, Biograph, Rounder, County and other labels.\nSee also\n*Alan Lomax\n*Charlie Higgins\n*Clawhammer\n* High Atmosphere, 1975 Rounder Records compilation\n*Old-time music\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n* Lornell, Kip (1989) ''[http://www.folklib.net/index/discog/bibliog18.shtml#8q Virginia's Blues, Country, & Gospel Records 1902-1943: An Annotated Discography.
