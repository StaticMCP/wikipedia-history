It specializes in the exploration, recovery, and conservation of historic shipwrecks through archaeologically sensitive methods. Founded in 2007 by former investment banker Kyle Kennedy, the company became publicly traded in 2008 via a reverse merger (OTCQB: SFRX). Seafarer emphasizes “rescue archaeology,” aiming to recover artifacts before they are lost to decay, and it employs advanced proprietary technology to locate submerged historical sites.\nHistory\nSeafarer Exploration was established in 2007 by Kyle Kennedy, who sold his brokerage firm to fund the venture along with his family. Kennedy took the company public in 2008 through a reverse merger and he raised capital for its ambitious shipwreck recovery projects. Early on, Seafarer targeted promising shipwreck sites off Florida’s coast – notably an unidentified wreck near Juno Beach in Palm Beach County, and areas off Melbourne Beach in the Treasure Coast region. In 2011, Seafarer obtained a 1A-31 Recovery Permit from Florida’s Bureau of Archaeological Research for the Juno Beach site – the first full treasure salvage permit the state had issued in over three decades. This permit authorized the excavation and recovery of artifacts from the Juno Beach wreck, marking a milestone in the company’s efforts.\nThroughout the 2010s, Seafarer expanded its operations and research. The company secured multiple 1A-31 exploration permits for sites along the Space Coast of Florida (Melbourne Beach Area 1 and 2), conducting extensive archival research and magnetometer surveys to locate wreck locations. By the late 2010s, evidence began to emerge that the Melbourne Beach site might hold one of the lost galleons of the famed 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet. In 2018, Seafarer commented on artifacts previously recovered near Melbourne – including a silver platter engraved with the name of the vessel owner's wife and his Spanish-made pistol – which had been linked to the Santisima Trinidad y Nuestra Señora de la Concepción, one of the five treasure ships from the 1715 fleet that sank off Florida and had never been fully salvaged. These references provided significant historical validation of the site’s potential and spurred new investment, accelerating exploration efforts.\nIn December 2020, Seafarer reported discovering a concentrated field of colonial-era shipwreck material in its Melbourne Beach permit area (Area 2) – including rigging, mast rings, ship’s fittings, rope, and wood fragments on the seafloor. The find suggested a second shipwreck. In accordance with its permit, the company immediately notified the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research and temporarily halted all disturbance within a 50-meter radius of the artifacts to protect the site context. This cautious approach reflected Seafarer’s commitment to archaeological protocols, even amid exciting discoveries.\nBy 2023, Seafarer’s long-running Juno Beach project began yielding tangible results as well. The team recovered a silver Spanish coin from the Juno site, identified as originating from the Mexico City mint as a Carlos and Joanna coin (dated between 1554 and 1572). This mid-16th-century coin aligned with Seafarer’s belief that the Juno wreck is a colonial-era (circa 1500s) ship. In January 2024, after years of regulatory effort, Seafarer obtained a critical five-year permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to commence full-scale excavation of the Juno Beach site. Simultaneously, the company secured all other necessary authorizations – including an admiralty court judgment granting exclusive rights to the wreck and a Florida submerged lands cultural recovery easement – giving Seafarer sole permission to proceed with recovery operations at Juno Beach. Also in 2024, Florida renewed Seafarer’s Melbourne Beach exploration permits through 2027, ensuring the company can continue its work on what is believed to be the 1715 fleet wreck as well as the new found “Ring Site”.\nOperations\nSeafarer’s core business is the development of proprietary IP to enable more efficient technology and perform top-tier underwater exploration, excavation, and preservation of historic shipwrecks. The company conducts extensive up-front research, including archival document retrieval and analysis in global libraries and archives, to narrow down the identity and location of target wrecks. Once a site is identified, Seafarer performs non-intrusive surveying — for example, using magnetometers to detect buried ferrous anomalies — before undertaking any excavation. This approach is part of what Seafarer calls “underwater rescue archaeology,” emphasizing careful site assessment, documentation, and minimal-disturbance recovery methods. Each project is overseen by professional underwater archaeologists who record the context of artifacts in situ and ensure that recovery is done methodically. Recovered items are brought to Seafarer’s onshore laboratory, where they are meticulously conserved and documented using museum-grade techniques (on a smaller scale) to stabilize each artifact and glean historical information.\nLegal and ethical compliance is a cornerstone of Seafarer’s operations. The company works closely with state and federal authorities to obtain all required permits for exploration and salvage. In Florida waters, Seafarer holds state-issued 1A-31 permits for exploration and recovery, granted by the Division of Historical Resources/Bureau of Archaeological Research, which authorize the firm to excavate specified underwater cultural sites. Seafarer also secures permits from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to address environmental and navigational regulations. For example, its Melbourne Beach site is covered by multi-year state exploration permits (recently extended to 2027) as well as an Army Corps permit and submerged lands easement that collectively sanction Seafarer’s activities at the site. In the case of the Juno Beach wreck, the state does not have the authority to permit this site as it is considered to be owned in its entirety by Seafarer Exploration. Seafarer entered into a Programmatic Agreement with the Army Corps and obtained a federal admiralty in rem claim through the U.S. District Court, granting it exclusive ownership rights to the unidentified wreck. This dual approach (state permits and federal admiralty claims) ensures that Seafarer’s claims are legally recognized and that artifacts can be recovered lawfully and responsibly.\nAdhering to archaeological ethics, Seafarer follows strict protocols during field operations. All significant finds are reported to authorities, and excavation is often done in phases to allow assessment. In one instance, after discovering a cluster of artifacts in 2020, Seafarer voluntarily paused all digging within a 50-meter buffer zone around the find and submitted a detailed exploration plan to the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research before continuing. The company’s commitment to best practices has been noted in permits and renewals; Seafarer credits collaboration with officials (such as Florida’s state archaeologists) for guiding its methodologies.\nImportantly, Seafarer does not sell the artifacts it recovers—even though it has the right to—setting it apart from traditional treasure-hunting firms. Instead, the company maintains all recovered treasures as a unified collection for study and public display. Seafarer plans to work with museums, government agencies, and media partners to exhibit and share these artifacts for educational and cultural value, rather than to auction them for profit. This model shifts the revenue focus toward possible museum exhibitions, documentary content, film rights, and technological spin-offs, while ensuring the historical integrity of the collections. Seafarer’s stated mission is to preserve maritime history through rescue archaeology “for the good of the public,” keeping artifacts accessible for research and posterity.\nTechnology\nThe SeaSearcher underwater drone, developed and owned by Seafarer, is an AI-enabled sensor platform that scans just above the seabed to detect and characterize buried shipwreck materials. Seafarer Exploration has invested heavily in proprietary technology to improve the efficiency and accuracy of underwater exploration. The centerpiece is the SeaSearcher – a custom-designed submersible drone equipped with advanced sensing capabilities and artificial intelligence. The SeaSearcher navigates above the ocean floor and can identify the exact location and depth of buried objects, differentiating between ferrous (iron/steel) and non-ferrous metals (like gold and silver) in real time. Uniquely, it transmits data to the surface instantly, allowing the crew to map targets without disturbing the seabed during initial survey. This technology was developed in-house by Seafarer’s engineering team, led by Tim Reynolds. According to the company, the SeaSearcher dramatically reduces the time, labor, and guesswork traditionally involved in finding shipwreck materials by providing a scientific, repeatable method to locate artifacts hidden under sand and sediment. Seafarer describes it as a “paradigm shift” in underwater archaeology – transforming what was once a slow, exploratory process into a precise, data-driven operation. In practice, the drone’s sensor suite (which includes advanced sensors, signal processing, AI, and machine learning) guides divers directly to high-probability targets, enabling surgical excavation of those areas instead of broad, indiscriminate digging.\nIn parallel, Seafarer developed the SandShark – a diver-operated metal detection system designed for precision scanning in dynamic, shallow-water environments. Where SeaSearcher excels in broad subsurface surveys, SandShark is built for mobility and targeted investigation. Its compact form factor allows divers to maneuver in surf zones, nearshore currents, and uneven terrain that autonomous platforms cannot easily access. SandShark incorporates high-sensitivity sensors capable of distinguishing ferrous and non-ferrous materials buried beneath layers of sediment. The system transmits real-time feedback to the diver, enabling immediate interpretation and response during a dive. By integrating SandShark into its toolkit, Seafarer extends its reach into previously inaccessible sites and complements its broader technology strategy with a flexible, human-operated solution. The tool has already proven effective in validating SeaSearcher targets and guiding focused excavations, reinforcing Seafarer’s commitment to combining advanced tech with field adaptability.\nBeyond the SeaSearcher and SandShark, Seafarer uses a range of conventional and novel marine survey tools. Cesium-vapor magnetometers towed behind survey vessels are used to detect magnetic anomalies indicative of shipwreck debris fields (cannons, anchors, chests, etc.). Side-scan sonar and sub-bottom profilers can map underwater terrain and buried objects, helping the team identify promising sites before deploying divers. In the lab, Seafarer employs advanced conservation technology – from electrolytic reduction tanks that remove corrosion on metal artifacts, to 3D scanning and X-ray imaging to analyze fragile items without damaging them. The company has built an archaeology laboratory with capabilities comparable to a major museum, enabling it to clean, stabilize, and study artifacts ranging from encrusted coins to waterlogged wood timbers on site.\nSeafarer’s technology development extends to spinoff applications as well. The company’s SeaSearcher technology, originally designed for shipwreck exploration, has broader potential applications beyond maritime archaeology. The SeaSearcher develops sensing and detection technologies that could be leveraged for government agencies, aerospace companies, and defense contractors. While the current focus is underwater rescue archaeology, there is interest in adapting the platform in the future for land-based applications such as utility mapping, environmental sensing, and defense-related use cases. While underwater exploration remains Seafarer’s primary focus, the dual-use potential of its innovations is a part of its business strategy. The SeaSearcher, for example, could have commercial or military uses in underwater surveying beyond shipwreck hunting. By investing in cutting-edge tech, Seafarer aims not only to gain an edge in discovering shipwrecks, but also to create intellectual property that adds value to the company.\nNotable Projects\nJuno Beach Shipwreck (Palm Beach County)\nOne of Seafarer’s flagship projects is the exploration of an unidentified shipwreck off Juno Beach, Florida, in approximately 90 feet of water. The site is believed to be a 16th-century wreck, potentially a colonial-era merchant vessel. Seafarer has investigated the Juno Beach site since its earliest days, working through substantial legal and environmental challenges. Although located within Florida state waters—where recovery would typically require a state-issued permit—Seafarer secured a full federal admiralty claim, eliminating the need for state salvage authorization. Over time, the company conducted magnetometer surveys, coring and limited test excavations, identifying a debris field with characteristics consistent with a mid-1500s shipwreck. A key breakthrough occurred in 2023 when a diver recovered a silver coin later identified as a Carlos and Joanna issue minted in Mexico City between 1554 and 1572. This, along with earlier finds such as ballast stones and early ship hardware, supports the theory that the site should be the remains of a colonial trading vessel.\nBy early 2024, Seafarer had secured full rights and permits to begin large-scale excavation at the Juno Beach wreck. The company holds an admiralty in rem judgment from U.S. federal court, granting exclusive ownership of the wreck and its contents. In January 2024, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a five-year Letter of Permission authorizing controlled excavation and recovery at the site. Combined with a Florida environmental seabed easement, these approvals allowed Seafarer to shift from exploration to full-scale salvage. The company mobilized multiple vessels and a team of archaeologists and divers to Juno Beach, with excavation guided by the SeaSearcher platform. CEO Kyle Kennedy described the site as a “massive mid-1500s shipwreck” and expressed optimism that, with all regulatory hurdles cleared, the team could finally resolve the site’s origins. Seafarer states that all archaeological data from Juno will be documented for scholarly research and historical preservation. As of 2025, excavation is ongoing, with SeaSearcher having identified several promising non-ferrous (precious metal) targets—potentially clusters of coins or artifacts still buried beneath the seabed.\nMelbourne Beach Site (Brevard County)\nAnother major endeavor for Seafarer Exploration is the Melbourne Beach partial shipwreck site along Florida’s Treasure Coast, which the company believes may be part of the legendary 1715 Spanish Plate Fleet. This fleet, a convoy of privately owned galleons laden with gold and silver from the New World, was destroyed by a hurricane, scattering treasure along the coast. Five of the fleet’s eleven ships were never recovered and are often referred to as “lost” treasure ships. Seafarer’s Melbourne Beach project focuses on what appears to be a section of an unsalvaged wreck from that disaster. The company’s permitted exploration areas—designated Area 1 and Area 2, just north of Sebastian Inlet—have produced a range of artifacts suggesting an early 18th-century origin. Among the finds are an encrusted silver platter with inscriptions and maker’s marks, bronze navigation instruments, musket balls, and fragments of colonial-era weaponry. Notably, a large silver platter, previously recovered and studied by researchers, was engraved with the name Doña Juana de Chaves y Espinosa de los Monteros—a Spanish noblewoman whose family reportedly owned the vessel. A Ramírez flintlock pistol linked to the same noble family has also been documented in association with the site and is believed to have been part of the cargo of the Santisima Trinidad y Nuestra Señora de la Concepción, one of the missing 1715 fleet galleons. Together, these references and artifacts strongly support the theory that the Melbourne Beach wreck may be the remains of the Trinidad/Concepción, representing a potentially historic discovery.\nSeafarer has worked closely with Florida state officials to explore the Melbourne Beach site in a responsible manner. The project has been ongoing for several years under Florida 1A-31 exploration permits that allow recovery of “diagnostic” artifacts to identify and evaluate the wreck. In 2017, Seafarer was granted a key permit for Area 1 of the site (after a three-year application process), which at the time the company called “perhaps the single most important permit [we] have ever received,” given the dense cluster of magnetometer targets detected there. Using its SeaSearcher technology and targeted dig-and-identify methodology, Seafarer has been excavating small test units within these areas to retrieve items that can confirm the wreck’s identity. The state of Florida has renewed Seafarer’s permits for this site through March 2027, following nearly three years of negotiations – a sign of confidence in the company’s archaeological approach. With the permits in hand, Seafarer can continue to carefully excavate sections of the wreck and recover artifacts.\nSignificant finds to date at Melbourne Beach include a range of artifacts pointing to an early 18th-century shipwreck. Underwater, Seafarer’s teams have recovered colonial-era tableware, belt buckle, pottery, and ship hardware from the sand strata. The artifacts that Seafarer has identified and conserved have been sent to the State archaeological archives for further conservation. If indeed the wreck is the Trinidad y Concepción of 1715, it would represent one of the most significant Treasure Coast finds since Mel Fisher’s discovery of the Nuestra Señora de Atocha (a 1622 galleon found in 1985). Seafarer has indicated that, with improved technology and cooperation with the state, it hopes to resolve the first Melbourne Beach wreck within a few years and contribute the findings to Florida’s maritime history archives.\nLeadership\nSeafarer Exploration’s leadership blends expertise in finance, engineering, and archaeology. The company is led by Kyle Kennedy, its Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer. Before founding Seafarer, Kennedy had a decades-long career in investment banking and held eight securities licenses. He has played a key role in financing the company’s operations and navigating the complex legal framework surrounding shipwreck recovery. Under his leadership, Seafarer has raised over $32 million in capital and established relationships in countries such as France, Spain, and Cuba to pursue additional exploration opportunities.\nOn the technical front, Seafarer’s engineering and technology division is led by a senior technologist with multiple degrees in physics and electrical engineering, including graduate-level research in signal processing and embedded systems. The company’s archaeological leadership has included professionals holding doctorates from prestigious institutions such as Harvard University and Oxford University, with specializations in maritime archaeology, historical anthropology, and conservation science. This multidisciplinary team brings together academic rigor and field-tested experience, ensuring that every phase of exploration — from sensing and survey to excavation and artifact conservation — meets the highest standards of scientific integrity and cultural stewardship.\nThe company’s board of directors and advisors provide additional oversight and expertise. In addition to Kyle Kennedy (who chairs the board), directors include Bradford T. “Brad” Clark, Charles Branscum, and Thomas B. Soeder, among others, who bring business management experience. Notably, Dr. Robert L. Kennedy (a relative of Kyle) also sits on the board. Seafarer has also enlisted industry leaders as advisors, including technology angel investor Maximilian Thyssen, who brings expertise in finance, innovation, and global business strategy. The management team’s blend of financial acumen, engineering innovation, and archaeological scholarship reflects the company’s multifaceted approach to underwater exploration. Together, they steer Seafarer’s strategic direction, from securing permits and funding to driving the day-to-day recovery operations in the field.\nSources:\n* Seafarer Exploration – Company website and press releases\n* U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings (Seafarer 8-K/10-Q)\n* Reuters Company Profile\n* Marine Technology News – “Seafarer Exploration Discovers Colonial-era Shipwreck Material” (Dec 2020)\n* Seafarer Exploration press release – “USACE Permit for Juno Site” (Jan 16, 2024)\n* Seafarer Exploration press release – “Melbourne Beach Permits Renewal” (Mar 28, 2024)"
