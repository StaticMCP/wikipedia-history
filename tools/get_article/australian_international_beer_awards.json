Judging of the awards is conducted at Melbourne Showgrounds, with the Awards presentation dinner held during Good Beer Week in Melbourne, Australia.\nThe awards were originally the ‘National Beer and Brewing Awards’ and operated in a partnership between RASV and the University of Ballarat. In 1995 the awards became an international competition, with a field of 201 competitors and entries from New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Canada, Indonesia, Malta and Tonga. It was at these awards that the first international winner was announced, Cisk Export Premium Lager by Simonds Farsons Cisk of Malta winning the Grand Champion Beer award.\nThe AIBA are now the second largest competition of their kind in the world, with 1,480 entries by 270 brewers from 35 countries in 2013.\nCompetitors must pay to enter in order to be judged. Only the trophies awarded in over 75 classes are strictly competitive; the unlimited number of gold, silver and bronze awards are based on meeting points thresholds in blind tastings.\nTrophy winners\n2006\n* Grand Champion – Redoak Brewery (New South Wales)\n* Champion Small Brewery – Colonial Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion International Brewery – Schneider Weisse, Private Weissbierbrauerei (Germany)\n* Champion Australasian Brewery – Little Creatures Brewery (Western Australia)\n2007\n* Grand Champion – Weihenstephan Brewery (Germany)\n* Champion International Small Brewery – Colonial Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion International Large Brewery – Deschutes Brewery (Oregon, USA)\n* Champion Australasian Brewery – Colonial Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n2008\n* Grand Champion – Matilda Bay Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion Large Brewery – Matilda Bay Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion Small Brewery – Redoak Brewery\n2009\n* Grand Champion – Feral Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion Large Brewery – Cerveceria Hondurena SA de CV (Honduras)\n* Champion Small Brewery – Feral Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n2010\n* Grand Champion – Nøgne Ø – Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri (Norway)\n* Champion Large Brewery – Weihenstephan Brewery (Germany)\n* Champion Small Brewery – Nøgne Ø – Det Kompromissløse Bryggeri (Norway)\n2011\n* Grand Champion – Moylan’s Brewing Company (California, USA)\n* Champion Large Brewery – Brooklyn Brewery (New York, USA)\n* Champion Small Brewery – Moylan's Brewing Company\n2012\n* Champion Large Australian Brewery – Feral Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion Large International Brewery – Deschutes Brewery (Oregon, USA)\n* Champion Small Australian Brewery – Wig and Pen Brewery and Tavern (Australian Capital Territory)\n* Champion Small International Brewery – Pelican Pub and Brewery (Oregon, USA)\n2013\n* Championship Large International Brewery- Weihenstephan Brewery (Germany)\n* Championship Medium International Brewery- Nogne O Brewery (Norway)\n* Championship Small International Brewery- Renaissance Brewery (New Zealand)\n* Champion Australian Beer – Alpha Pale Ale by Matilda Bay Brewing Company (Victoria)\n* Champion International Beer – Oude Geuze by Oud Beersel (Belgium)\n* Champion Large Australian Brewery – Carlton and United Breweries (Victoria)\n* Champion Medium Australian Brewery – Feral Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion Small Australian Brewery – 2 Brothers Brewery (Victoria)\n2014\n* Championship Large International Brewery – Oriental Brewery Company (Gyeonggido, South Korea)\n* Championship Medium International Brewery – Heller-Bräu Trum Kg (Bavaria, Germany)\n* Championship Small International Brewery – Renaissance Brewery (Marlborough, New Zealand)\n* Champion Australian Beer – Mash IPA by Mash Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion International Beer – Obisdian Stout by – Deschutes Brewery (Oregon, USA)\n* Champion Large Australian Brewery – Carlton and United Breweries (Victoria)\n* Champion Medium Australian Brewery – Thunder Road Brewing Company (Victoria)\n* Champion Small Australian Brewery – 3 Ravens (Victoria)\n2015\n* Championship Large International Brewery – Brouwerij De Halve Maan, Belgium\n* Championship Medium International Brewery – Pelican Pub and Brewery (Oregon, USA)\n* Championship Small International Brewery – Parrotdog (Wellington, New Zealand)\n* Champion Australian Beer – Barley Wine – Barrel Beer by Mountain Goat Beer (Victoria)\n* Champion International Beer – ''Speight's 5 Malt Old Dark'' by – Lion Beer Spirits Wine (Dunedin, New Zealand)\n* Champion Large Australian Brewery – 4 Pines Brewing Company (Victoria)\n* Champion Medium Australian Brewery – Thunder Road Brewing Company (Victoria)\n* Champion Small Australian Brewery – Boatrocker Brewing Company (Victoria)\n2016\n* Champion Large International Brewery – Ballast Point Brewing and Spirits (California, USA)\n* Champion Medium International Brewery – Pelican Brewing Company (Oregon, USA)\n* Champion Small International Brewery – Moylan's Brewing Company (California, USA)\n* Champion Australian Beer – Little Dove (Draught) – Gage Roads Brewing Company (Western Australia)\n* Champion International Beer – Samuel Adams Kosmic Mother Funk Grand Cru (Packaged) – Boston Beer Company (Massachusetts, USA)\n* Champion Large Australian Brewery – Stone & Wood Brewing Co.
