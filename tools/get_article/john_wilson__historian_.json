In 1840, he published Our Israelitish Origin, a book of his lectures, in which he claimed that the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel had made their way from the Near East, across the continent of Europe, to the British Isles. He believed the Northern European people to be descended from the Ten Lost Tribes, with the people of Britain being the Tribe of Ephraim. Wilson relied on philological \"evidence\" of English, Scottish, and Irish words that were similar to Hebrew words, even though he lacked formal training in language or seminary.\nIt was in Wilson's house in St Pancras, London, that the Anglo-Israel Association was founded in 1874.\nOn the death of Wilson's daughter in 1904, his manuscripts passed into the possession of Rev. A. B. Grimaldi.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n* Wilson, John, [https://archive.org/details/lecturesonourisr00wilsuoft/page/n3/mode/2up Lectures on Our Israelitish Origin], 5th edition 1876 (1st edition 1840).
