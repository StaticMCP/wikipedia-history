The persons named in the polls are declared candidates or have received media speculation about their possible candidacy.\nBackground\nThe Republican National Committee determined that candidates must qualify for the first primary debate by polling above 1% in three national polls since July 2023 – or in two national polls and one poll from two different early primary states (of which the polls must meet committee standards) – as well as attract donations from at least 40,000 individuals, with at least 200 from each of 20 states or territories.\nEach subsequent debate raised the polling threshold for qualification. For the second debate, candidates needed to poll above 3% in August or September in two national polls; otherwise, one national poll plus two state polls in two separate early primary states also qualify. The donor threshold was also raised for the second debate to 50,000 individuals. For the third and fourth debates, the threshold was raised to above 4% in one national poll and one early primary state poll, as well as 70,000 unique donors.\nIndividuals who have been included in statewide Republican primary polls but have either ruled out their candidacy or not expressed interest in running include Greg Abbott, Tucker Carlson, Liz Cheney, Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Kristi Noem, Mike Pompeo, Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio, Rick Scott, Chris Sununu, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Glenn Youngkin.\nPrimary and caucus calendar\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"line-height:14px;\"\n|+2024 Republican Party primaries and caucuses\n!Date\n!colspan=2|Delegates\n!Primaries/caucuses\n|-\n|January 15\n|colspan=2|40\n|Iowa caucus\n|-\n|January 23\n|colspan=2|22\n|New Hampshire primary\n|-\n|February 6\n|colspan=2|-\n|Nevada primary\n|-\n|February 8\n|35\n|269\n|Nevada caucusVirgin Islands caucus\n|-\n|February 24\n|colspan=2|50\n|South Carolina primary\n|-\n|February 27\n|colspan=2|55\n|Michigan primary\n|-\n|March 2\n|86\n|3254\n|Idaho caucusMissouri caucus\n|-\n|March 3\n|colspan=2|19\n|District of Columbia primary\n|-\n|March 4\n|colspan=2|29\n|North Dakota caucus\n|-\n|March 5(Super Tuesday)\n|874\n|492894016937204039754358162401748\n|Alabama primaryAlaska primaryAmerican Samoa caucusArkansas primaryCalifornia primaryColorado primaryMaine primaryMassachusetts primaryMinnesota primaryNorth Carolina primaryOklahoma primaryTennessee primaryTexas primaryUtah primaryVermont primaryVirginia primary\n|-\n|March 9\n|colspan=2|9\n|Guam caucus\n|-\n|March 10\n|32\n|923\n|Northern Marianas caucusPuerto Rico primary\n|-\n|March 12\n|160\n|59193943\n|Georgia primaryHawaii caucusMississippi primaryWashington primary\n|-\n|March 19\n|349\n|43125643978\n|Arizona primaryFlorida primaryIllinois primaryKansas primaryOhio primary\n|-\n|March 23\n|colspan=2|46\n|Louisiana primary\n|-\n|April 2\n|195\n|2816911941\n|Connecticut primaryDelaware primaryNew York primaryRhode Island primaryWisconsin primary\n|-\n|April 18–20\n|colspan=2|29\n|Wyoming caucus\n|-\n|April 23\n|colspan=2|67\n|Pennsylvania primary\n|-\n|May 7\n|colspan=2|58\n|Indiana primary\n|-\n|May 14\n|104\n|373631\n|Maryland primaryNebraska primaryWest Virginia primary\n|-\n|May 21\n|77\n|4631\n|Kentucky caucusOregon primary\n|-\n|June 4\n|131\n|31492229\n|Montana primaryNew Jersey primaryNew Mexico primarySouth Dakota primary\n|}\nAggregate polling summary\n270toWin\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=\"bottom\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!Statespolled\n!Datesadministered\n!Datesupdated\n!
