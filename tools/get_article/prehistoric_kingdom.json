      "text": "# Prehistoric Kingdom\n\nPrehistoric Kingdom is an upcoming construction and management simulation video game developed by Blue Meridian and published by Crytivo. The game allows players to build a zoo to exhibit dinosaurs and other extinct wildlife. The game was made available under Steam's early access program on April 27, 2022 for Microsoft Windows and macOS, and is also available on the Epic Games Store.\nBritish naturalist Nigel Marven provided a voiceover during the now scratched tutorial and provides facts about all in-game species.\nGameplay\nPrehistoric Kingdom is a business simulation game, where players build a zoo composed of dinosaurs and other extinct animals, similar in concept and gameplay to the Jurassic World Evolution games. The player can build enclosures to house the animals and must take care of their needs.  This includes providing animals with food, water, and the proper foliage.\nThe player must also meet the needs of the guests visiting the park, using modules (restaurants, bathrooms, etc.) to satisfy their guests'needs.\nThe game features a modular building system, allowing the player to use small props and other pieces to create buildings such as a hatchery or a guest facility. Players can precisely move, rotate, and scale individual pieces to create unique structures. These creations can also be uploaded to the Steam Workshop for other players to download.\nStaff are a major part of gameplay. There are three staff types currently in-game. These are the keeper, cashier, and laborer. Keepers support the animals side of management, stocking feeders and cleaning up dung. Cashiers support the guest side of management, selling food and other goods to guests. Laborers support the logistics side of management, transporting goods to modules.\nThere are currently 62 individual species of animals available in the game, including 49 dinosaurs and 13 extinct mammals. The designs of the animals aim to be scientifically accurate.  To discover and de-extinct new animals, players must assign dig teams to dig sites found all across the world.  These teams bring back DNA material which is added to an animal’s viable genome. Once the genome is complete, animals are then created in the Animal Nursery (a module).\nAnimals\nPrehistoric Kingdom features 62 individual species and 48 genera of prehistoric animals. These animals roam the world, eating, drinking, and resting, as well as performing basic idle behaviors (scratching, roaring etc.). The animals also have social requirements, and will naturally form packs and herds around a leader.  In addition, all species except for the smallest \"Vivarium\" animals (such as Microraptor and Archaeopteryx) have a full ontogeny system; with seamless growth from young to fully grown adult, in addition to being able to breed naturally.
