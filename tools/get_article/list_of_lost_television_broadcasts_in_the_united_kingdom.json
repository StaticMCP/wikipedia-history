At some point after the recording, it was discovered that a technical problem had caused backstage voices to be heard on the resulting videotape; in early December 1963, the episode was remounted with a different costume for Susan. The only surviving portion is the reprise at the beginning of Episode 2.\nPlanet of Giants is another odd example, having originally recorded four episodes. Directed by Douglas Camfield and entitled \"The Urge to Live\", Episode 4 was spliced together with the original Episode 3 (\"Crisis\") to create a faster-paced climax with only Camfield being credited on the resulting episode. This decision, made by then-Head of Drama Sydney Newman, resulted in a gap at the end of the second production block (and the creation of Mission to the Unknown); the unused portions of Episodes 3 and 4 are believed to have been destroyed.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
