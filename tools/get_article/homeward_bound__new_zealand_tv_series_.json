It was first broadcast on TV3 on 11 June 1992 and ran for 21 episodes (including the two-hour pilot), finishing on 29 October 1992. Created by Ross Jennings, Homeward Bound was TV3's bid for NZ On Air funding for a local soap opera, however, it ultimately lost out to TVNZ's Shortland Street and was reformatted as an hour-long drama series.\nSeries overview\nPlots centered on the domestic and professional lives of the extended Johnstone family and the residents of Riverside, a fictional rural community just south of the Bombay Hills. The area encompassed a pub and beer garden, a general store and garage, a community hall, a school, a church, a sawmill and a rubbish tip.\nHomeward Bound was produced by Soap (NZ) Ltd, a joint venture between Isambard Productions and Communicado, with funding from NZ On Air. The series was broadcast on TV3 on Thursdays at 7.30pm from June until October 1992.\nThe theme tune was composed by New Zealand musician Dave Dobbyn.\nCast\nMain cast\n* Michael Daly as Graeme Johnstone\n* Liddy Holloway as Janine Johnstone\n* Mark Raffety as Dan Johnstone\n* Francis Bell as Bob Johnstone\n* Karl Urban as Tim Johnstone\n* Sylvia Rands as Suzanne Johnstone\n* Peter Elliott as Neil Johnstone\n* David Aston as Gordon Jonstone\n* June Bishop as Isabella \"Izzy\" Johnstone\n* Simone Kessell as Hannah Tumai\nGuest and recurring cast\n* Mandie Simons as Amy Johnstone\n* Ben Alpers as Grant Johnstone\n* Charlotte Woollams as Katey Johnstone\n* Tina Grenville as Val Johnstone\n* Rebekah Mercer as Wendy Johnstone\n* Victoria Harrison as Sophie Johnstone\n* Doug Aston as Uncle Haddon\n* Margaret Murray as Auntie Beth\n* Nancy Flyger as Mavis Bartlett\n* Dai Evans as The Minister\n* Waihoroi Shortland as Monte Tumai\n* Eliza Bidois as Lisa Tumai\n* John Watson as Det Sgt Kuipers\n* Frank Whitten\n* Hine Elder as Louise Harvey\n* Michael Anthony Noonan as Toby Paykel\n*Ken Blackburn as Noel Connor\n* Tiara Lowndes as Kelly Marsh\n* Alison Routledge as Charley\n* Kelsey Howlett / Jonathan Mason as Jonty Harvey\n* Jon Kernutt as Kieran Connor\n* Helena Ross as Trisha Connor\n* Alistair Browning as Dr McIntyre\n* Ian Harrop as The Publican\n* Jon Bridges as Andy\nEpisodes\n|episodes=\n| ShortSummary        = The Johnstone family reunion is about to begin.
