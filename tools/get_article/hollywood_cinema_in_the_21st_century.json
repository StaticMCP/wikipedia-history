The Hollywood film industry plays a significant role among global movie-making studios and is the third-largest film market in the world.\nIn the 21st century, Hollywood films are sometimes referred to as \"New Hollywood.\" Beginning in the 2000s, American movies gained a larger international audience and had a greater impact on total box office revenue. Science fiction, fantasy, and animated films have played a crucial role in shaping the global movie industry. Research indicates that, compared to the 20th century, the financial value of films has approximately doubled.\nInternational advertising has been a key factor in the expansion of \"New Hollywood\" compared to the previous century. A significant portion of box office revenue now comes from overseas audiences.\nAcademy Award for Best Picture\nThe Academy Awards are widely regarded as the most prestigious honors in American cinema.
