The majority of these buildings are examples of Brutalist architecture or related modernist architecture which was ambitiously adopted by a number of Scottish architects, such as Sir Robert Matthew and Sir Basil Spence.\nIn Scotland, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of \"special architectural or historic interest\".  Category A structures are those considered to be \"buildings of national or international importance, either architectural or historic, or fine little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type.\" Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947, and the current legislative basis for listing is the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997.  The authority for listing rests with Historic Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government, which inherited this role from the Scottish Development Department in 1991. Once listed, severe restrictions are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or its fittings. Listed building consent must be obtained from local authorities prior to any alteration to such a structure.\nThere are approximately 47,400 listed buildings and statues in Scotland, of which around 8% (some 3,600) are Category A. The number which date from post 1945 currently stands at 49, following the addition of the Cables Wynd House and Linksview House buildings in January 2017. The two oldest buildings in this list both commenced construction prior to World War II but completion then occurred in the post-war period, the buildings are generally considered post-war.\n| date_listed =18 November 1993\n| grid_ref = NS7147155882\n| lat = 55.779122\n| lon = -4.050819\n| image = SouthLanarkshireCouncilHQ.JPG\n| commonscat = Lanark County Buildings\n}}\n|}\nFormer Grade A listings\n|}\nA-Groups\n* The University of Glasgow's Joseph Black building forms an A-Group with the Category A listed Graham Kerr building.
