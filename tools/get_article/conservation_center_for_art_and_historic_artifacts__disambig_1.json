CCAHA serves cultural, research, and educational institutions, such as museums, libraries, archives, and historical societies, both in its region and across the country. It also works with individuals and private organizations.\nTreatments include Bruce Springsteen's original lyric notebooks and scrapbooks, Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural drawings, John James Audubon Birds of America prints, Civil War muster rolls, and works by Degas, Matisse, and Picasso. CCAHA was instrumental in the 2014 discovery of two previously-unknown Cézanne sketches belonging to the Barnes Foundation.\nIn addition to treatment services, CCAHA offers nationwide educational programs on disaster planning, collections care, and records and archives management. These lectures, seminars, and workshops are designed for professional staff who have primary responsibility for the care and handling of artifacts, such as curators, collections managers, archivists, and librarians.\nOther services include digital imaging, conservation matting and framing, on-site consultations, emergency conservation services and disaster assistance, and help with grantwriting and exhibition planning.\nSee also\nPreservation (library and archive)\nNotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ccaha.org The Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts]\n*[http://www.rap-arcc.org/ The Regional Alliance for Preservation]"
