The format for 2023 did not present any changes from the previous edition. It featured 88 teams representing the prefectural football associations, J1 League, J2 League and Japan Football League. JFL's Honda FC was once again chosen to be the annually specially designated amateur club.\nVentforet Kofu were the defending champions, after a cinderella story for the J2 club saw them qualify for the final, which they won on penalties against Sanfrecce Hiroshima, after a 1–1 draw in regulation time, but were eliminated by Vissel Kobe in the round of 16.\nQualifying rounds\nAs only J1 and J2 League clubs qualify directly for the first round, teams from outside of it who want to qualify to the Emperor's Cup (exception being made to the JFA-seeded team), had to, as usual, undergo a prefectural qualification, with regulations and schedules varying from one association to another. In total, there are 47 prefectural cup qualifications, with the winners of each prefectural cup having earned their right to play in the Emperor's Cup, with all of them assigned to start the competition in the first round.\n|team1      = BTOP Hokkaido\n|score      = 1–0\n|report     =\n|team2      = Hokkaido Tokachi Sky Earth\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Sapporo Soccer Amusement Park\n|location   = Sapporo\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|team1      = North Asia University\n|score      = 4–1\n|report     =\n|team2      = TDK Shinwakai\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Space Project Dream Field\n|location   = Akita\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|team1      = Iwate Grulla Morioka\n|score      = 7–1\n|report     =\n|team2      = Ganju Iwate\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Iwagin Stadium\n|location   = Morioka\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|team1      = Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine\n|score      = 3–1\n|report     =\n|team2      = Yamagata University\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Yamagata City Athletic Stadium\n|location   = Yamagata\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|team1      = Niigata University HW\n|score      = 3–2\n|report     =\n|team2      = Niigata University HW FC\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Izimino Park Athletic Stadium\n|location   = Shibata\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|team1      = Tokyo International University FC\n|score      = 1–0\n|report     =\n|team2      = Josai University\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Tokyo International University 1st Soccer Field\n|location   = Sakado\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|team1      = FC Gifu\n|score      = 11–0\n|report     =\n|team2      = Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Gifu Nagaragawa Meadow\n|location   = Gifu\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\n|team1      = FC Ryukyu\n|score      = 2–0\n|report     =\n|team2      = Okinawa SV\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Tapic Kenso Hiyagon Stadium\n|location   = Okinawa\n|attendance =\n|referee    =\n}}\nParticipating clubs\nJ1 League\nAll 18 teams playing in the 2023 J1 League entered in the second round.\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!Club||Apps.||Prefecture\n|-\n|Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo||42nd||Hokkaido\n|-\n|Kashima Antlers||39th||Ibaraki\n|-\n|Urawa Red Diamonds||58th||Saitama\n|-\n|Kashiwa Reysol||55th||Chiba\n|-\n|FC Tokyo||29th||Tokyo\n|-\n|Kawasaki Frontale||40th||Kanagawa\n|-\n|Yokohama F.

The semi-finals and the final did not have its dates released by the Japan Football Association, as uncertainties around the schedule of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup left doubts about possible reschedule of one or more rounds of the Emperor's Cup. The decision was also made to avoid schedule conflict for teams whose squads would have one or more players participating in the competition.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

These specific away teams either finished between the 15th to 20th place on last season's J2 or got promoted from the J3 League for the 2023 season, and played their ties against teams that finished between the 7th and 14th place on last season's J2.\n*Eduardo\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = NHK Spring Mitsuzawa Football Stadium\n|location   = Yokohama\n|attendance = 4,287\n|referee    = Koichiro Fukushima\n}}\n*Nagamine\n|goals2     =\n*Matsui\n*Kurokawa\n*Nakashima\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Ishikawa Athletics Stadium\n|location   = Kanazawa\n|attendance = 1,177\n|referee    = Reo Tanaka\n}}\n*Patric\n|goals2     =\n*Ono\n|aet        = yes\n|penalties1 =\n*Patric\n*Hirato\n*Kimura\n*Iyoha\n*Kinoshita\n*Kaneko\n*Asada\n*Ueda\n*Tawiah\n*Ota\n*Patric\n|penalties2 =\n* Usui\n* Ando\n* Yagishita\n* Matsuoka\n* Takahashi\n* Wakimoto\n* Kamiyama\n* Shiina\n* Ohata\n* Tagawa\n* Usui\n|stadium    = Takebishi Stadium Kyoto\n|location   = Kyoto\n|attendance = 2,273\n|referee    = Koji Takasaki\n}}\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Denka Big Swan Stadium\n|location   = Niigata\n|attendance = 4,285\n|referee    = Hiroyuki Kimura\n}}\n*Fujii\n*Kida\n|goals2     =\n*Tamura\n*Ryang Hyon-ju\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Paloma Mizuho Rugby Stadium\n|location   = Nagoya\n|attendance = 5,340\n|referee    = Hirokazu Otsubo\n}}\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Yurtec Stadium Sendai\n|location   = Sendai\n|attendance = 2,495\n|referee    = Koei Koya\n}}\n|goals2     =\n|aet        = yes\n|stadium    = Urawa Komaba Stadium\n|location   = Saitama\n|attendance = 5,391\n|referee    = Hiroyoshi Takayama\n}}\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = ND Soft Stadium Yamagata\n|location   = Tendō\n|attendance = 2,552\n|referee    = Tomokazu Sato\n}}\n*Arthur Caíke\n*Someno\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Kashima Soccer Stadium\n|location   = Kashima\n|attendance = 3,837\n|referee    = Yoshimi Yamashita\n}}\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Transcosmos Stadium Nagasaki\n|location   = Isahaya\n|attendance = 2,304\n|referee    = Toru Kakinuma\n}}\nLikely, the postponement was related to Vissel Kobe's friendly match against FC Barcelona, played around that date.}}\n|time       = 19:00 JST\n|round      = Match 35\n|team1      = Vissel Kobe (1)\n|score      = 3–1\n|report     = [http://jfa.jp/match/emperorscup_2023/match_page/m35.html Report][https://www.jfa.jp/match/emperorscup_2023/schedule_result/pdf/m35.pdf Report]\n|team2      = (3) Nagano Parceiro\n|goals1     =\n*Lincoln\n*Yuruki\n|goals2     =\n*Nishimura\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Noevir Stadium Kobe\n|location   = Kobe\n|attendance = 3,332\n|referee    = Hayato Shimizu\n|note       =\n}}\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Yamaha Stadium\n|location   = Iwata\n|attendance = 2,483\n|referee    = Kentaro Uematsu\n}}\n*Sakata\n*Ishiwatari\n*Maikuma\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Yodoko Sakura Stadium\n|location   = Osaka\n|attendance = 2,489\n|referee    = Yuzo Sutani\n}}\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Fukuda Denshi Arena\n|location   = Chiba\n|attendance = 2,281\n|referee    = Ryo Tanimoto\n}}\n*Nagaki\n*Abe\n*Wakatsuki\n|goals2     =\n*Unno\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Lemon Gas Stadium Hiratsuka\n|location   = Hiratsuka\n|attendance = 1,632\n|referee    = Sho Kawamata\n}}\n|goals2     =\n*Hirahara\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = City Light Stadium\n|location   = Okayama\n|attendance = 2,564\n|referee    = Shuhei Ishimaru\n}}\n*Miyashiro\n|goals2     =\n*Toshima\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Kawasaki Todoroki Stadium\n|location   = Kawasaki\n|attendance = 5,325\n|referee    = Yuichi Nishimura\n}}\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = K's denki Stadium Mito\n|location   = Mito\n|attendance = 902\n|referee    = Takuto Okabe\n}}\n|goals2     =\n*Kobayashi\n*Miura\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Panasonic Stadium Suita\n|location   = Suita\n|attendance = 3,059\n|referee    = Akihiko Ikeuchi\n}}\n*Saulo Mineiro\n*Saito\n|goals2     =\n*Matsubara\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = NHK Spring Mitsuzawa Football Stadium\n|location   = Yokohama\n|attendance = 1,820\n|referee    = Jumpei Iida\n}}\n*Maie\n*Masukake\n*Ochiai\n*Yamamoto\n|goals2     =\n*Matsubara\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Sankyo Frontier Kashiwa Stadium\n|location   = Kashiwa\n|attendance = 1,819\n|referee    = Keigo Sendachi\n}}\n*Chiba\n|goals2     =\n*Endo\n|aet        = yes\n|stadium    = Pocarisweat Stadium\n|location   = Naruto\n|attendance = 1,441\n|referee    = Yudai Yamamoto\n}}\n*Fukai\n*Nakashima\n|goals2     =\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Sapporo Atsubetsu Park Stadium\n|location   = Sapporo\n|attendance = 2,647\n|referee    = Hajime Matsuo\n}}\n|aet        =\n|stadium    = Resonac Dome Oita\n|location   = Oita\n|attendance = 4,122\n|referee    = Tetsuro Yoshida\n}}\n*T.
