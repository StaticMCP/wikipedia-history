Most of the staff at Ottoman diplomatic missions in Europe originated from this office.\nSalaries and prominence of the office increased after the 1830s in the aftermath of the Battle of Konya and Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi.\nBernard Lewis, author of The Muslim Discovery of Europe, wrote that the Translation Office became \"one of the avenues to preferment and power\".\nThe office created French-language versions of official documents. Such documents, created by the Translation Office and other Ottoman government organs dedicated to translating documents, catered to foreigners, and were used to create versions of documents in languages used by Ottoman non-Muslims.\nNotable staff\n* Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha\n* Mehmed Fuad Pasha\nSee also\n* Dragoman\n* Languages of the Ottoman Empire\n* Foreign relations of the Ottoman Empire\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  - Master's degree thesis"
