      "text": "# 2023 Dominican presidential election\n\nAn indirect presidential election was held on 27 September 2023 to elect the next President of Dominica..\nPresident Charles Savarin was ineligible for re-election, the Constitution of Dominica prohibiting him from a third term.\nPrime Minister of Dominica Roosevelt Skerrit of the Dominica Labour Party proposed Sylvanie Burton as a candidate, making her the likely first woman president and first of the indigenous Kalinago community.\nSylvanie Burton however did not receive the support of opposition leader Jesma Paul-Victor, making an election by unanimity impossible. Skerrit thus informed the parliament of the situation on 12 September, triggering an election two weeks later between Burton and the candidate of the opposition, Anette Sanford, who is also a Kalinago woman.\nBurton was elected on 27 September, and was sworn in on 2 October.\nResults\n.\n}}\nReferences"
