The battle began when a United States Navy warship encountered two German warships in August 1944 while supporting the Allied Operation Dragoon. It was one of the few surface engagements fought between the US Navy and the German Kriegsmarine. Later that day, the combined American and Canadian 1st Special Service Force (the Devil's Brigade) was dropped by LST 32 on the main island and captured the German-held positions.\nBattle\nThe American destroyer —armed with six  guns and eight  torpedo tubes—was cruising in the Mediterranean on 15 August 1944. She came across the former Italian  Camoscio of , which had been renamed UJ6081 by the Kriegsmarine. Also involved was the former French aviso Amiral Senes of , renamed SG21. UJ6081 was armed with one  gun and two  torpedo tubes. The aviso was armed with two  guns. It was early morning off Port Cros, about four hours before the Allied landing in Vichy France, when the Americans sighted the German corvette. Commander Willam Hughes ordered a torpedo attack and directed his men to battle stations.\nA spread of torpedoes was launched and the Germans opened fire as they attempted to evade the torpedoes. One torpedo hit UJ6081 and she quickly began to sink; SG21 was then spotted coming to the rescue and was engaged by Somers main gun battery. The duel lasted for a few minutes until SG21 was hit several times and began taking in water. Within a few more minutes, both German ships had sunk and Somers left the area for naval gunfire support missions against targets along the French mainland. American forces suffered no damage or casualties.\nLater that day, a mixed regiment of United States Army and Canadian Army infantry, the 1st Special Service Force, was dropped onto Port Cros and captured the five forts after a day-long battle with their German garrisons. The Allies assaulted two or three forts and seized the remaining without resistance. Nine paratroopers were killed in the land battle.\nAftermath\nCommander Hughes was recognized for his victory and eventually rose to the rank of rear admiral partly due to his involvement in this action. After the engagement, the U.S. Army occupied Le Levant, another island nearby. Two days later, on 17 August 1944, the former Italian corvette Antilope, renamed UJ6082, and the former Egyptian armed yacht Nimet Allah were sunk by  with help from two British gunboats at the Battle of La Ciotat.\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\nExternal links\n* www.history.navy.mil: [https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/world-war-ii/1944/operation-dragoon.html Operation Dragoon: The Invasion of Southern France]"
