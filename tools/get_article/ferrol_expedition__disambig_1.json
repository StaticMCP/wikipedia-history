Ferrol was a major Spanish Navy base with a shipyard for shipbuilding and a dry dock for repairs.\nBackground\nThe primary object of the British expedition and fleet of 109 ships during the year 1800 was the conquest of Belle Île but the French defences appeared too strong. The expedition therefore proceeded to the coast of Spain, where it arrived on 25 August.\nBattle\nAfter a heavy cannonade against a small Spanish fort of eight 24-pounder cannon  by the British ships of the line HMS Impetueux with 74 guns, HMS London with 96 guns, HMS Courageux,  HMS Renown and HMS Captain, each with 74 guns. HMS Impetueus, HMS Brilliant, HMS Cynthia and the small gunner HMS St. Vincent, state on their logs to had taken part on the gunning of the small Fort. No mention on HMS London and HMS Renown logs of being part of the gunning.\nUnder the superintendence of Sir Edward Pellew, the British effected a landing at a small opening near Cape Prior. The army commander was Lieutenant-general Sir James Pulteney. The force landed consisted of seven British regiments, one of two battalions, and the rifle-corps totaling 8,000 troops and 16 field pieces.\nThe Spanish defenders of Ferrol were: Don Francisco Melgarejo (a Naval Engineer), commander of the naval department; Juan Joaquín Moreno de Mondragón, commander of the squadron stationed in the harbour; Don Francisco Xavier Negrété, captain-general of the province; and Field Marshal Count Donadio, who commanded the fortifications that protected the coast. The Spanish ship of the line were: Real Carlos and San Hermenegildo, each 112 guns; San Fernando, 96 guns; Argonauta, 80 guns; San Antonio and San Agustín, each 74 guns.\nThe British rifle-corps advanced up a ridge and was attacked by a Spanish detachment which it drove back with some loss. Early on the morning of 26 August a considerable body of Spanish attacked the British on the heights of Brion and Balon but they were repulsed. British casualties were 16 killed and 68 wounded. The heights overlooked the town and harbour of Ferrol. That night, after observing the strength of the fortifications, the British troops and artillery were embarked back on their ships.\nAftermath\nThe embarkation of the troops and artillery was effected, and soon after this failure on the coast of Galicia, another expedition, equally unsuccessful was directed on October against the city of Cadiz. The assault had to be abandoned due to an outbreak of yellow fever among British troops,\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt to capture Ferrol, the British Prime Minister William Pitt said in the House of Commons that: \"If Great Britain had a naval station so easy to defend as Ferrol, due to its location, it would have been surrounded by a thick silver wall\".\nFootnotes\nReferences\nRodrigo Ramos Ardá. \"El Desembarco de Doniños en la documentación Británica\".
