      "text": "# Timeline of the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 2022 Atlantic hurricane season saw an average number of named storms and hurricanes, and below average number major hurricanes (category&nbsp;3 or higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson wind speed scale). There were fourteen named storms during the season; eight of them strengthened into a hurricane, and two of those reached major hurricane intensity. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, and ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean. No subtropical or tropical development occurred in the Atlantic prior to the start of the season, making this the first since 2014 not to have a pre-season named storm. The season's first storm, Tropical Storm Alex, formed on June&nbsp;5, and the last, Hurricane Nicole, dissipated on November&nbsp;11.\nTropical cyclone formation ceased for several weeks beginning in early July, and for the first time since 1941 there were no named storm in the Atlantic basin between July&nbsp;3 and August&nbsp;30. This season, two systems, Bonnie and Julia, survived the crossover between the Atlantic and Pacific basins. The season's largest and most powerful hurricanes were Fiona and Ian. Fiona brought heavy flooding, significant damage, and loss of life along its path from the Lesser Antilles to Eastern Canada. The storm was responsible for 29&nbsp;deaths and caused over US$3&nbsp;billion in damage. Ian made landfall in Western Cuba and in Florida, where it hit at Category&nbsp;4 strength, causing massive storm surge and flooding, along with widespread destruction. It was responsible for over 150&nbsp;deaths, and over US$112&nbsp;billion in damage. The World Meteorological Organization later retired both names from future use in the North Atlantic basin.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) are: Greenwich, Cape Verde, Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nJune\nJune 1\n* The 2022 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.|group=\"nb\"}}\n*
