When Seyyed Reza Salehi Amiri was in charge of the library, a decision was made to change the use of one of the repositories to focus on the display of works and the official opening of a museum for the National Library and Archives of Iran. The purpose of its foundation was to promote the culture of society and spread Iranian-Islamic culture.\nSections\nThe Book and Documentary Heritage Museum of Iran includes two main sections:\n* Exhibition Hall: In this hall, the works for the public are in the form of seasonal and thematic exhibitions.\n*Assembly Hall: This hall is for holding cultural and artistic events, film screenings, workshops, meetings and conferences.\nBust of Hakim Abul-qasem Ferdowsi Tusi\nThe Book and Documentary Heritage Museum of the National Library and Archives of Iran holds a bust of Abul-qasem Ferdowsi which was registered under number 1448 in the Iran National Heritage List on February 25, 2020, by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism. This work was created in the solar year 1313 (1934) by Abolhassan Sadighi and then installed in the foyer of the National Library of Iran, located on 30 Tir Street. The bust is currently being held and is on display at the Book and Documentary Heritage Museum at the new address of the National Library.
