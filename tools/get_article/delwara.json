Delwara was originally known as ‘Devkul Patan Nagri’ , which means the town of god. It boasted over 1500 temples at one time, including over 400 Jain temples. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before the 15th century AD.\nHistorical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town\nThe ancient Jain temples of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat Samprati (224-215 BC). He was the grandson of Samrat Ashoka and the son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. Samprati became the Emperor of the entire western and southern parts of India (Maurya Empire) and ruled from Ujjain. It is said that Samprati, also known as ‘Jain Ashoka’, built thousands of Jain temples in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the Jain temples at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat Samprati.\nCity of Learning and Education\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before the 15th century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada – center of learning. Delwara was a large town that spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to Nagda. Today, only 25% of the original town remains.\nGrandeur of Jain temples\nAs of 2017, three main Jain temples remain in Delwara, for which restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of Rishabhdev (ऋषभदेव भगवान) and one of Parshvnath (पार्श्वनाथ भगवान). The Jain temples at Delwara were built with white marble stones and despite being plain and austere on the outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each temple has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath, respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara (तीर्थंकर) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples are their ceilings, which are circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of each temple is adorned with magnificent carvings, and it culminates into an ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down, forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figures of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (विध्या देवी)  are carved on the ceilings.\nThis site marks the very location where Muni Sundar, a Jain monk from the 15th century, crafted Shantikarma: a ritual aimed at safeguarding against diseases.\nThere is a story that the ministers of the Solanki rulers of Gujarat visited these temples during the 11th and 13th centuries AD, and were very impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, the then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the Jain temples. When Vimal Shah, minister, governor of Chandravati and commander-in-chief of Bhimadev I (1022–64), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara, he was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields. He hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple.\nThe temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers – Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the Jain temples designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between the 11th and 13th century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), they came to be known as Dilwara Temples (देलवाडा जैन मंदिर). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identities. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple, which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\nHistory\nUnder Chauhans\nRaja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during the mid-13th century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540–1572), annexed these Jagirs from the Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.\nThere is another bard's tale that during the 12th century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.\nBattle of Bhutalghati\nOne of the fiercest battles Raja Sagar fought alongside Rana Jaitra Singh (1213–53) was against Sultan Shams-ud-din Iltutmish (1211–36) at Bhutalghati, near Nagda. He ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Sultan Iltutmish destroyed many in and around Nagda and Delwara. Villages were also burnt.\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh (Hindi) – Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh\nThis fierce battle was fought in the valley near Nagda towards Gogunda. Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan's army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In the 14th century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.” There is another bard that says that Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.\nUnder Jhala Rajputs\nLater, in the 15th century, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from the 15th century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), descendant of Harpaldeva. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473–1509), Ajoji (Ajay Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajay Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajay Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana.\nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509–1527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for the Maharanas of Mewar.\nDelightful places\nDevi Garh Palace - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Today, this initiative has transformed into a self-owned enterprise involving more than 600 women from various villages.
