She also founded the Tennessee Nurses Association and the Tennessee Health Association and was the first superintendent of nurses at the City of Memphis Hospital.\nEarly life and education\nWarner was born in Grenada, Mississippi. Her immediate family died during the Yellow Fever epidemics of 1877 and 1878, after which she was raised by her grandmother.\nWarner attended St. Mary’s Episcopal School in Memphis, Tennessee and was among the first students accepted at the Memphis Training School for Nurses (1887).\nCareer and research\nWhen the Spanish-American War began in 1898, President McKinley called for volunteer nurses to help support efforts in Cuba to counter the numerous viruses such as cholera, malaria, smallpox, yellow fever, and bubonic plague all spreading across the country. Warner volunteered and was named Chief Executive Nurse, making her the only female officer in the United States Army at the time.\nFollowing the Spanish-American War, Warner was invited back to Cuba to support experiments related to Yellow Fever  alongside Dr. Walter Reed and other distinguished medical staff. The team was able to determine that Yellow Fever was carried by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito.\nAfter returning to Memphis, she founded the Tennessee Nurses Association and the Tennessee Health Association, organized Red Cross chapters, and served as the state chairperson for the Red Cross Nursing Department from 1910 to 1932.\nWarner moved to Knoxville in 1916 to fight epidemics of influenza and cholera until her eventual retirement in 1946 at 79.\nDeath\nWarner is buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.\nReferences"
