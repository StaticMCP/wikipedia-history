This would all be nothing if there were not, behind each work of art, a man happy with what he is doing, an artist for whom colour is a source of life and life a generator exploding with colour, one more dense and warm than the next.\" Anita NARDON, A.I.C.A. - 1996\n\"Clearly, Ward Lernout's talent has reached full maturity. He has no need to resort to attractive effects or play on fashion trends. He has developed a style which conveys to the observer the 'joie de peindre' so evident in this type of art. Lernout is an artist richly inspired by man and nature, which enables him to express his love for rural life in sensual and fascinating pictorial interpretations.\" Remi De Cnodder, A.I.C.A. - 1991\nExhibitions\n1979–2005\n* P.A.C.
