The most devastating air raids on Duisburg occurred during October 1944 when the city was bombed by the Royal Air Force (RAF).\nDuisburg was a major logistical centre in the Ruhr Area and location of chemical, steel and iron industries, Duisburg was a primary target of Allied bombers. Not only the industrial areas but also residential areas were attacked by Allied bombs. As an entry to the Ruhr, the city received daily warnings of bombing raids in 1943.\nIn the period 1939 to 1945 the Royal Air Force dropped a total of  of bombs on Duisburg.\nBattle of the Ruhr\nDuring the \"Battle of the Ruhr\" in 1943, 577 British bombers destroyed the old city on 12/13 May, with  of bombs: 96,000 people were made homeless.\nOperation Hurricane\nIn October 1944, Duisburg became the main target in Operation Hurricane a joint RAF Bomber Command and USAAF Eighth Air Force operation.\nOn 14 October 1944 just after daybreak, RAF Bomber Command sent \"1,013 aircraft ... to [bomb] Duisburg with RAF fighters providing an escort. 957 bombers dropped [... ] of high explosive and [... ] of incendiaries on\" the city for a loss of 14 aircraft. The same day the Eighth Air Force sent 1,251 heavy bombers escorted by 749 fighters to bomb targets in the area of Cologne.\nLater the same day, during the night of 14 October/15 October, 1,005 RAF bombers returned to Duisburg in two waves about two hours apart, and dropped a further  of high explosive and  of incendiaries for the loss of seven aircraft. The same night a further 230 aircraft destroyed Brunswick.\nDuring Operation Hurricane nearly  of bombs fell on Duisburg in less than 24 hours, but the damage to Duisburg is difficult to assess because much of the documentation including the final report (Endbericht), is not held by the Duisburg state archive (Stadtarchiv). Extant records mention \"Very serious property damage. A large number of people buried.\" and that at the Thyssen Mines III and IV eight days production was lost.\nChronology\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+valign=top| Chronology\n! width=18% | Date\n!Air Force\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n|1941-06-1212/13 June 1941\n|RAF Bomber Command\n| of bombs dropped.\n|-\n|1942-04-055/6 April 1942\n|RAF Bomber Command\n|263 aircraft.\n|-\n|1942-04-0520/21 December 1942\n|RAF Bomber Command\n|232 aircraft. \"The bombing force found that the target area was clear and claimed much damage.\"\n|-\n| 1943-03-2626/27 March 1943\n|RAF Bomber Command\n| a \"widely scattered raid\" by 455 aircraft during the Battle of the Ruhr due to cloud cover and lack of Oboe marking\n|-\n|1943-05-1212/13 May 1943\n|RAF Bomber Command\n|With good marking and the Main Force delivering concentrated bombing, 577 bombers destroy the old city with  of bombs: 96,000 people are made homeless.\n|-\n|1944-11-2323 November 1944\n|U.S. Eighth Air Force\n|Over 140 B-17s escorted by 2 fighter groups bombed the benzol manufacturing plant near Gelsenkirchen and Marshalling Yards at Duisburg.\n|-\n|1944-10-1414/15 October 1944\n|RAF Bomber Command\n|During the morning, 957 Operation Hurricane bombers dropped  of high explosive and 820 tonnes of incendiaries.
