It refers to analyses that perceive a deficit of liberalism or constitutionalism within the country's established electoral democracy. This framework is often used to analyze perceived structural imbalances and historical trajectories of South Korean democracy following democratization in 1987.\nWhile Fareed Zakaria presented South Korea's 1980s–90s trajectory as a model case of achieving economic \"liberalization\" under authoritarianism before democratization, 21st-century Korean democracy has faced complex challenges. Some scholars, such as Park Chan-pyo (2008), have suggested that Korean democracy faces an imbalance between high-quality \"elections\" and low-quality \"liberalism,\" arguing this stems from a structural \"deficit of liberalism.\"\nThe V-Dem Institute classified South Korea as a country undergoing 'autocratization' in its 2024 Democracy Report. The report identified South Korea as an example of a 'Bell-Turn' trajectory—where its democracy index rose after the 2016 impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, peaked around 2018, and then entered a period of decline—and noted that a crisis of illiberal democracy is materializing.\nTheoretical Foundations: The Separation of 'Democracy' and 'Liberalism'\nThe concept of \"illiberal democracy\" gained significant traction after Fareed Zakaria's 1997 article, \"The Rise of Illiberal Democracy,\" in Foreign Affairs. The concept's core insight is that democracy and constitutional liberalism, historically fused in the West, are in fact distinct phenomena that can be separated.\nAccording to Zakaria, Democracy (following the procedural definitions of Joseph Schumpeter or Robert Dahl) essentially means the 'rule of the people.' It refers to the political process of electing and replacing a government through free, fair, and competitive multiparty elections. In contrast, Constitutional Liberalism is about the goals of government and is rooted in a deep tradition of Western political history. It is an ideology dedicated to protecting an individual's autonomy and dignity from coercion by any power—be it the state, church, or society—and its core values include the rule of law, separation of powers, and the protection of fundamental constitutional rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and property.\nZakaria argued that after the Cold War, many countries were gaining formal legitimacy through democratic elections but were simultaneously eroding civil liberties by weakening the institutional checks (like an independent judiciary and free press) guaranteed by constitutional liberalism. Min Kyung-kook (2013) also points to the inherent tension between the two concepts, noting that while liberalism emphasizes the 'limitation of state power' and the 'law of justice (universal law),' democracy emphasizes the 'rule of the majority.' He warns that if democracy is not constrained by constitutional liberalism to become a 'limited democracy,' it risks devolving into 'democratic totalitarianism.'\nThe emergence of the 'illiberal democracy' concept is also linked to the limitations of transition studies in the post-Cold War era. As scholars like Thomas Carothers pointed out, the traditional 'transition paradigm' assumed that all countries moving away from authoritarianism were progressing toward the single goal of liberal democracy. However, many nations stalled or entered a 'grey zone,' resulting in various hybrid regimes often described as 'democracy with adjectives' rather than genuine liberal democracy.\nOne of the most systematic theories integrating these discussions is the 'embedded democracy' and 'defective democracy' model developed by Wolfgang Merkel, Aurel Croissant, and others. According to an analysis by Shin Jin-wook (2016), Merkel posits that a functioning liberal democracy must be 'embedded' in five interdependent sub-systems: ① a democratic electoral regime, ② political participation rights, ③ civil liberties, ④ horizontal accountability (i.e., checks and balances), and ⑤ the effective power to govern. A defective democracy is a system where the core electoral regime (①) functions democratically, but one or more of the other sub-systems are systematically defective. Within this framework, illiberal democracy is classified as a specific type of defect where the civil liberties sub-system (③) is systematically flawed or infringed upon by state power.\nScholarly analysis of electoral and liberal elements\nThe illiberal democracy framework is often used to analyze a perceived imbalance between the high quality of South Korea's 'electoral democracy' (sub-system ① in Merkel's model) and the fragility of its 'liberal elements' (sub-systems ③ and ④).\nAssessments of electoral democracy\nThe electoral system, the core of procedural democracy, is described by some metrics as having a high level of fairness and integrity. Freedom House has consistently awarded South Korea its highest rating (Tier 1) for 'Political Rights,' placing it on par with the United States and European nations. Analyzing this, Kim Yong-chul (2016) notes that the Electoral Integrity Project also rated South Korea's 2012 presidential election as the highest-quality in Asia (12th out of 127 countries). Furthermore, domestic voters express high trust in the fairness of elections (93% positive for presidential, 90% for general elections). According to this perspective, these indicators suggest that South Korea has established the formal, procedural aspects of 'democratic elections' (①) to the level of a developed nation.\nAssessments of liberal elements\nIn contrast, some analyses point to the domains of 'civil liberties' (③) and the 'rule of law,' which are central to constitutional liberalism, as showing stagnation or decline. Kim Yong-chul (2016) points out that Freedom House's 'Civil Liberties' score for South Korea had been in decline or stagnated since 2007.\nSpecific indicators are cited to support this 'liberal deficit' analysis. In the 2011 Asian Barometer Survey, only 52% of respondents agreed that they \"can freely speak their minds without fear.\" Freedom of the press is cited by some sources as a point of concern. The Press Freedom Index from Reporters Without Borders decreased to 70th in 2016 during the Lee Myung-bak administration. After improving to 41st in the early Moon Jae-in administration (2019), it subsequently fell again, ranking 62nd (\"problematic\" status) in 2024.\nLabor rights are another area identified by some organizations as one of concern. The International Trade Union Confederation rated South Korea in its lowest category for \"no guarantee of labor rights\" for three consecutive years (2013-2015). Furthermore, the World Bank's 'Rule of Law' indicator (2002-2014) also stagnated at a level lower than that of major developed countries like Japan and the United States.\nPark Chan-pyo (2008) analyzes this imbalance as evidence supporting the view that the problem with Korean democracy is a 'deficit of liberalism,' rather than an 'excess of democracy.'\nAnalysis of structural factors\nSome scholars suggest that South Korea's 'liberal deficit' is not a temporary phenomenon but a structural problem arising from a complex interplay of institutional, historical-ideological, and cultural factors.\nInstitutional Factors: The Imperial Presidency and Winner-Take-All System\nThe 'imperial presidency' is widely cited in academia as a critical institutional cause. Park Myung-lim (2019) criticizes the South Korean presidency for possessing 'hyper-presidential' characteristics, such as lacking the need for parliamentary consent for ministerial appointments, which he argues causes a deficit in horizontal accountability (④). Using Merkel's framework, Shin Jin-wook (2016) analyzes this to mean that Korean democracy, while achieving 'elections' (①), was launched with a structural defect known as 'delegative democracy'—a system lacking 'horizontal accountability' (④).\nKang Won-taek (2021) argues that this imperial presidency creates a \"fatal synergy\" when combined with the 'winner-take-all' single-member district system, another pillar of the '1987 system.' He argues that these two institutions structure an extreme political polarization centered on the two major parties, turning politics into an all-or-nothing war that makes compromise impossible, thereby precipitating a crisis of democracy.\nHistorical-Ideological Factors: The Legacy of the Cold War and the '1948 System'\nSome analyses suggest that 'liberalism' itself was distorted in the historical context of South Korea. Park Chan-pyo (2008) identifies the legacy of the 'Cold War and anti-communist system'—the '1948 system'—as a core cause. This system, formed through national division and the Korean War, introduced universal suffrage (inclusiveness) but simultaneously used strong anti-communism and the National Security Act to block the formation of political alternatives, especially from the left and the labor movement (failure of public contestation). This, he argues, gave birth to a 'democracy without labor.'\nIn this process, 'liberalism' was not used in its original sense of 'limiting state power' (Kim Il-young 2008) but was instead appropriated as a state ideology to defend 'anti-communism' and 'capitalist market economics.' Yoo Jong-sung (2014) critiques this 'disregard for liberalism' as a structural problem found not only in the conservative camp but also within the progressive camp, which often espoused 'anti-liberal' positions. He argues this is why both camps, when in power, have resorted to illiberal tools of governance, such as the abuse of defamation law.\nCultural-Civic Factors: Distrust in Representative Democracy and Preference for 'Good Governance'\nAnother cited factor is that representative democracy itself has lost public trust, being described as a 'dysfunctional democracy' (Choi Jang-jip 2005). As evidenced by South Korea's parliamentary satisfaction rate being the lowest among OECD countries, citizens hold a strong distrust of institutional politics.\nResearch by Park Sun-kyung and Hong Ha-eun (2023) analyzes that amid this distrust, Koreans have a strong tendency to perceive the essential component of democracy not as 'procedure' or 'liberty,' but as 'good governance' (i.e., administrative efficiency, integrity, and public order). When democracy fails to deliver this 'good governance,' public satisfaction plummets. This civic consciousness, they argue, can become a cultural foundation that tolerates 'Rule by law'—the use of law for administrative convenience—in the name of efficiency, rather than upholding the true 'Rule of law'.\nPost-1987 democratization period\nSince democratization in 1987, successive South Korean administrations have shown different trajectories regarding these structural factors, according to some scholarly analyses.\nKim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung, and Roh Moo-hyun administrations (1987–2008)\nAccording to Shin Jin-wook's (2016) analysis, the Kim Young-sam administration (1993–1998) overcame the 'tutelary democracy' deficit (intervention by unelected powers, ⑤) by dismantling the 'Hanahoe' military faction. During the Kim Dae-jung administration (1998–2003) and Roh Moo-hyun administration (2003–2008), 'political basic rights' (②) and 'civil liberties' (③) were expanded through measures like establishing the National Human Rights Commission of Korea and broadening citizen participation in policymaking.\nHowever, despite this progress, some analyses argue the 'poverty of liberalism' persisted even under progressive governments. Yoo Jong-sung (2014) notes that while infringements under the National Security Act were reduced, issues like the 'abuse of defamation law,' excessive regulations such as the 'ban on early election campaigning,' and 'restrictions on internet freedom' remained. This is pointed to as a limitation showing that the progressive camp also shared an anti-liberal stance to protect its own interests.\nLee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations (2008–2017)\nShin Jin-wook (2016) analyzes the nine years of the Lee Myung-bak administration (2008–2013) and Park Geun-hye administration (2013–2017) as a period of 'comprehensive deficit.' This analysis suggests that the structural deficit of 'delegative democracy' (the imperial presidency, ④), when combined with an authoritarian ruling bloc, systematically undermined all other sub-systems. He points to the 'seizure of broadcasting,' state surveillance of civilians, internet censorship, and restrictions on assemblies and protests (illiberal democracy deficit, ③); the decertification of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union and the dissolution of the Unified Progressive Party (exclusive democracy deficit, ②); the 'shadowy confidante' scandal (the Park Geun-hye–Choi Soon-sil gate), which constituted a 'tutelary democracy' deficit (⑤); and election interference by state agencies like the National Intelligence Service, which damaged the 'electoral democracy' itself (①).\nMoon Jae-in administration (2017–2022)\nThe Moon Jae-in administration (2017–2022), launched by the 2016–17 Candlelight Protests, is described by some scholars, such as Cha Tae-seo (2021), as a 'populist moment.' According to this analysis, a 'good vs. evil' dichotomy under the motto of 'liquidating deep-rooted evils' (jeokpye cheongsan), exclusionary politics exemplified by the 'Tochak waegu' narrative, and the rise of 'fandom politics' were seen as clashing with liberal norms of pluralism and tolerance.\nCha Tae-seo (2021) and Park Sang-hoon (2019) described the Blue House public petition system as a tool of plebiscitary politics, allowing the president to communicate directly with supporters while bypassing the legislature (representative democracy). This, in their view, demonstrated a fusion of 'delegative democracy' with 'populism.' Lim Jie-hyun (2019) analyzes that behind this phenomenon lay the ideological tendencies of the democratization movement activists: 'maximalism' (a tendency to reject compromise) and a 'besieged fortress syndrome' (perceiving oneself as a minority reformist force).\nAccording to these analyses, this trend resulted in violations of 'institutional forbearance,' such as the ruling party's monopoly of all 18 parliamentary committee chairs after the 2020 election, and legislative attempts that raised concerns over freedom of thought, like the '5.18 History Distortion Punishment Act.' Amid criticisms that 'due process' principles were being disregarded, the decline in South Korea's V-Dem democracy index began around 2018.\nYoon Suk Yeol administration (2022–2025)\nFollowing the inauguration of the Yoon Suk Yeol administration (2022), some critics argue that a regression in democratic indicators has accelerated, not through populist mobilization, but in the form of 'Rule by law'—mobilizing state apparatuses such as the prosecution, police, and the Board of Audit and Inspection. This method is characterized by using the law as a tool of governance, strengthening power and suppressing critics through arbitrary legal interpretation and enforcement.\nIn particular, freedom of the press, a core component of 'civil liberties' (③), is described by these critics as having declined. Following the 2022 MBC hot mic report, the presidential office and the ruling party increased 'defamation'-related lawsuits, criminal complaints, and 'search and seizures' against media companies and journalists.\nMultiple media outlets, including Newstapa, JTBC, and Kyunghyang Shinmun, became targets of investigations. These actions drew domestic and international criticism as potential symptoms of 'illiberal democracy,' such as 'SLAPP suits' that chill public criticism and suppress 'freedom of expression'.\nFurthermore, controversies over 'seizing control of broadcasting' have re-emerged through the replacement of board members at public broadcasters like KBS, YTN, and MBC's foundation (Foundation for Broadcast Culture). This was followed by specific instances of censorship and infringement on production autonomy, such as the removal of YTN's 'Dolbal Yeongsang' (Unexpected Video) and the replacement and eventual cancellation of the KBS program 'History Journal That Day'. These incidents were cited as major factors in the 2024 World Press Freedom Index ranking decreasing to 62nd.\nSee also\n* Authoritarianism\n* Democratization\n* Democratic backsliding\n* Defective democracy\n* Democracy indices\n* Hybrid regime\n* Illiberal democracy\n* Politics of South Korea\nReferences"
