In the British Museum there is a bead with the short inscription: king's wife, Tjan, beloved of Hathor, mistress of Atfih. In the Louvre, there is a scarab with her name and title. In the Egyptian Museum of Cairo there is a box with an inscription stating that a certain [...]hotep begotten of king Khaneferre and born of the king's wife Tjan. The name of the son is only partly preserved. Khaneferre is the throne name of king Sobekhotep IV. This inscription identifies her as the wife of this king. Finally there is a fragment of a faience vase naming her daughter Nebetiunet. Tjan does not appear on monuments of the king. Perhaps she married him late in his reign.\nSources"
