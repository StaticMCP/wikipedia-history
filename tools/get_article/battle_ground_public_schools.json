It serves the communities of Amboy, Battle Ground, Brush Prairie and Yacolt. The district headquarters are in Brush Prairie.\nAs of the 2011–2012 school year, the district has an average enrollment of 12,318 full-time-equivalent students.\nHistory\nThe district existed as early as 1870 as the Battle Ground School District and was eventually known as Central School District. The zone undertook the moniker of Battle Ground No. 85 when it combined with the district of Cherry Grove in 1914. A consolidation in 1955 with Glenwood, Washington led to the No. 119 designation and a further merger with Yacolt finalized the size of the Battle Ground district. However, the district currently recognizes 1909 as its year of inception and celebrated its centennial during the 2009–2010 school year.\nBoundary\nThe district includes almost all of Battle Ground. It also includes all of Brush Prairie, Cherry Grove, Dollars Corner, Lewisville, Meadow Glade, and Yacolt. Additionally, it includes most of Amboy, Mount Vista, and Venersborg, as well as parts of Duluth, Five Corners, Hockinson, Orchards, and Vancouver.\nBattle Ground Public Schools is bordered by the Green Mountain, La Center, Ridgefield, Vancouver, Evergreen, and Hockinson school districts in Clark County, Washington. It also borders the Woodland in Cowlitz County and Washougal in Skamania County.\nSchools\n, the district includes 19 schools and one half-day alternative learning program\nComprehensive high schools\n*Battle Ground High School\n*Prairie High School, Brush Prairie\nPrimary schools (Gr.

Following administrative changes, the publication ended by 2013. Your Battle Ground Public Schools was revived as a student magazine in 2025 by several students and the district's communications department.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/?schoolId=43 Battle Ground School District Report Card]"
