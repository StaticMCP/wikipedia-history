The restaurant is next to an 1853 Romanesque Revival traditional synagogue, Congregation Chasam Sopher. It attracts a weekend brunch line that stretches around the corner of the block, which includes New York foodies and many foreign tourists.\nMenu\nThe restaurant serves refined comfort food and baked items, which are made daily on its premises, with breakfast (which it serves all day), lunch, brunch, and dinner.\nAmong the items that it is known for are its blueberry pancakes.

Drinks include lime squash and bellinis.\nOwners\nIt is owned by a husband-and-wife team of restaurateurs, seasoned chef Neil Kleinberg and DeDe Lahman.

Lahman is the restaurant's catering director and handles back-end responsibilities such as public relations.\npancakes]]\nHistory\nThe restaurant began in 2001 as a bakery and a small coffee cafe, and over time became a full-fledged seven-days-a-week restaurant with a liquor license.
