Shahar Yeri with an expanse of approximately 200 hectares, is the most vast historical area of Ardabil province and one of the most important ancient sites in the northwest of Iran.\nThe site consists of three main parts, remains of several military fortress, a temple area and cemeteries with standing anthropomorphic monoliths.\nArchaeology and History\nThis ancient site was first researched by an archaeology team led by Charles A. Burney from university of Manchester in August 30, 1978.\nFurther excavations were carried out by Iranian teams, led by archaeologist Alireza Hejebri Nobari, in 2003, 2004 and 2005 with the aim of identifying the iron age cultures of northwestern Iran. The third excavation season in 2005 showed that Shahar Yeri was permanently populated from the late bronze age (around 7000 BC).\nThe most important architectural remains from the formation period are those of an early temple built with slab stones, mortar, mud brick, and monoliths. Semi-pastoralist societies occupied the site from the Late bronze age into the early iron age, during which they constructed a primary temple. The site developed further in the middle iron age, when a citadel was built along with a vast cemetery containing up to 500 anthropomorphic monoliths next to the temple. Overall, evidence suggests that settlement began in the middle and late bronze ages, with the early temples and the growth of a nomadic culture serving as the main archaeological markers of this period.\nFeatures\nGallery\nShahar yeari 1.jpg\nShahar yeari 2.jpg\nShahar yeari 3.jpg\nShahar yeari 4.jpg\nShahar yeari 5.jpg\nShahar yeari 7.jpg\nShahar yeari 8.jpg\nSee Also\n[https://www.magiran.com/paper/1134476/introducing-the-large-chamber-or-kurgans-graves-of-ardabil-province?lang=en Introducing the large Chamber or Kurgans graves of Ardabil Province]\nReferences"
