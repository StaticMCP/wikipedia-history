Led by fourth-year head coach Arnold Jeter, the Hornets compiled an overall record of 6–2 and a mark of 4–1 in conference play, placing third in the CIAA's Northern Division. This was Delaware State’s final season competing in the CIAA, as they moved to the newly formed Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) in 1971. Following the season, running back Steve Davis was selected with the 60th pick in the 1971 NFL draft, becoming the first Hornet to be selected in an NFL Draft.\nSchedule\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Lock Haven, PA\n| score = 19–14\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Sprague Field\n| site_cityst = Upper Montclair, NJ\n| score = 7–10\n| attend = 5,828\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Alumni Stadium\n| site_cityst = Dover, DE\n| score = 49–0\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Washington, DC\n| score = 20–0\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Alumni Stadium\n| site_cityst = Dover, DE\n| score = 6–0\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Hughes Stadium\n| site_cityst = Baltimore, MD\n| score = 6–34\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Alumni Stadium\n| site_cityst = Dover, DE\n| score = 44–10\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Princess Anne, MD\n| score = 21–15\n| attend =\n| source =\n}}\n}}\nReferences"
