It had two user interfaces, one for textmode use and another called remote control, which ran on an integrated web server and was used by a web browser. The first public version of Mutella was published on October 6, 2001.\nThe Mutella logo was changed into a squid somewhere around version 4.1. Before this change the logo used to be an Ouroboros. There was a blue and a black version of the ouroboros logo.\nSwapNut\n[http://slashdot.org/articles/01/09/23/0557259.shtml Slashdot] reports that LimeWire and SwapNut used the same code.  The website was www.swapnut.com.\nXoloX\nXoloX  was a Gnutella-based peer-to-peer file sharing application for Windows. It advertised having no spyware, adware, or hijackware. However, upon installation, it prompted the user to install programs suspected to be of that kind.  Also, Microsoft Anti-Spyware detected adware programs when you started to install the program.\nXoloX links\n* www.xolox.nl was the Official Website. Dead since June 2007.\n*[http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2002/xoloxreview.html Review: Xolox]\nSee also\n* Abandonware\n* Comparison of Gnutella software\nReferences\n* [http://www.gnutellaforums.com/discontinued-gnutella-client-forums/ Discontinued Gnutella Clients]\n*}}"
