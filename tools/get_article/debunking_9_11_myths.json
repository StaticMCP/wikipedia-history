The book is based on the article \"9/11: Debunking the Myths'\" in the March 2005 issue of Popular Mechanics and is written by David Dunbar and Brad Reagan, responding to various 9/11 conspiracy theories. The authors interviewed over 300 sources for the book, relying on expert and witness accounts.\nOriginal article\nThe front magazine cover art of Popular Mechanics' March 2005 issue, displaying the article's title.\n\"9/11: Debunking the Myths\" was the original article in the March 2005 issue of Popular Mechanics, on which the book was based. It also attempted to debunk the various 9/11 conspiracy theories. The magazine cover referred to the article as \"'''Debunking 9/11 Lies, Conspiracy Theories Can't Stand Up to the Hard Facts'''.\" The online version's title was later changed to \"Debunking the 9/11 Myths: Special Report.\" The original reporting team included Benjamin Chertoff, Davin Coburn, Michael Connery, David Enders, Kevin Haynes, Kristin Roth, Tracy Saelinger, Erik Sofge and the editors of Popular Mechanics.\nThe article (available at: http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military/news/1227842) has been referred to by publications and organizations such as the Chicago Tribune, the San Francisco Bay Guardian, and the Bureau of International Information Programs.\nCoverage of the book\nDebunking 9/11 Myths has been referred to by news sources such as the San Francisco Chronicle and The Courier-Mail.\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attacks, Democracy Now! screened a debate between Dunbar and James B.

However, Chertoff has repeatedly denied this claim, most notably in the September 11, 2006, issue of U.S. News & World Report, stating \"No one in my family has ever met anyone related to Michael Chertoff\".\nIn an audio interview, he noted that any possible relationship would likely only be found in \"19th-century Belarus\", and that his mother has described any such possible relationship as \"distant\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a49/1227842/ \"Debunking the 9/11 Myths: Special Report\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061024062122/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/research/4199607.html \"The Conspiracy Industry: Afterword to PM Expanded Investigation\"] The book's afterword, written by Popular Mechanics editor-in-chief James Meigs\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090420022431/http://www.origin.popularmechanics.com/blogs/911myths/ Blogs on Debunking 9/11 Myths]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070601181713/http://odeo.com/show/1783494/view Odeo podcast] with Popular Mechanics executive editor David Dunbar, contributing editor Brad Reagan and editor-in-chief James Meigs\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110228104436/http://www.america.gov/st/pubs-english/2006/September/20060828133846esnamfuaK0.2676355.html \"The Top September 11 Conspiracy Theories\"]"
