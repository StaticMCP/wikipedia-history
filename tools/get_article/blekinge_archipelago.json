It covers some  including water; the landmass amounts to about . The archipelago is dominated by a few large islands, Tjärö, Aspö, Hasslö, Tärnö and Sturkö, with smaller islands and skerries interspersed. In the whole archipelago area, some 85,000 people live, of whom 4,000 are islanders. The island of Utlängan is the furthest out to sea of the archipelago's islands. Only the lighthouse rock Utklippan is further out.\nThe landscape is a diverse cultural landscape, characterised by mainly a mix between oak pastures and deciduous forest. For its size, the archipelago exhibits an unusually high biodiversity. Endangered species that find a habitat in the archipelago include Osmoderma eremita and Lecanographa amylacea.\nCulture\nThe towns of Karlshamn and Karlskrona are both located within the archipelago area. Karlskrona is mainly situated on Trossö island. The latter, having been founded as a naval base, is noted for its Baroque architecture and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nShipbuilding has been a local trade within the archipelago and the area is known for a traditional type of small boat, called blekingeeka and used for tasks like fishing and transporting stone locally.\nIn the 1970s, the local diving club discovered a shipwreck in the Blekinge archipelago that was eventually identified by archaeologists as Gribshunden, a 15th-century Danish warship. The shipwreck is significant as one of the best-preserved wreckages from the early modern period.\nTjärö island was the site of the Sweden Social Web Camp from 2009 to 2013.\nGallery\nFile:Blekingeeka1.jpg|Blekingeeka, a type of small boat traditionally used in the archipelago area.\nFile:Almö (3).JPG|Typical landscape (Almö island)\nFile:Almö (4).JPG|Typical landscape (Almö island)\nFile:Gäraviken, Aspö, Karlskrona.jpg|Typical landscape Aspö island\nFile:Aspö kyrka exterior south-east.jpg|Church on Aspö island\nReferences"
