He was transferred to Vitória de Guimarães in 2019 and was sold to Sporting in January 2022 for an initial €7.67 million. He has played over 100 Primeira Liga games and holds the record for most goals by an English player in that league.\nEdwards earned 49 caps for England from under-16 to under-20 level, scoring 15 goals. He was part of the under-19 team that won the 2017 European Championship.\nClub career\nTottenham Hotspur\nEdwards joined the academy system at Tottenham Hotspur at the age of eight and progressed through the ranks and played initially as a  centre forward. On 2 August 2016, he signed his first professional contract with Tottenham after a protracted period of negotiations amidst interest from other clubs.\nEdwards joined the Tottenham first team in the summer of 2016 for their pre-season tour and produced some impressive performances in pre-season matches. He was given a squad number of 48 ahead of the 2016–17 season. On 20 September 2016, Mauricio Pochettino likened Edwards to a young Lionel Messi due to his low centre of gravity and ability to beat a man. The next day Edwards made his competitive debut in the EFL Cup third round at home to Gillingham, coming on as a substitute for the final 15 minutes in place of Vincent Janssen and taking a shot that was saved by Stuart Nelson in a 5–0 win. However, he injured his ankle in October which required surgery, and was sidelined for a long period to recover from the injury.\nOn 29 July 2017, Edwards signed a new contract at Tottenham, keeping him at the club until 2020. In the UEFA Youth League, he scored twice in a 4–0 win over Borussia Dortmund on 13 September. He went on to make five appearances and scoring two more goals throughout the group stage.\nLoan spells\nIn January 2018, Edwards moved on loan to Championship side Norwich City for the remainder of the 2017–18 season. He made his Norwich City debut on 30 March, coming on as a late substitute for Mario Vrančić, in a 2–0 home loss against Fulham. This turned out to be his only appearance for the club as he returned to Tottenham on 10 April for \"personal reasons\".\nIn August 2018, Edwards joined Dutch side Excelsior on a season-long loan. On 25 September, he was sent off in the first round of the KNVB Cup in a 3–2 extra-time home loss to NEC, for two bookings within six minutes late in the game. He scored two goals in 25 appearances for club with four assists, and although he scored a goal in the relegation play-offs, Excelsior was relegated. Edwards led the Eredivisie table at the end of the season in dribbles per game, with 3.3, ahead of PSV's Steven Bergwijn (3.2).\nVitória de Guimarães\nOn 2 September 2019, Portuguese Primeira Liga club Vitória de Guimarães signed Edwards on a four-year deal, purchasing 50% of his economic rights and setting a €15 million buyout clause. He scored his first goal on 24 October in the UEFA Europa League group stage, opening a 3–2 loss at his former club's rivals, Arsenal. With seven goals and five assists over the league season, he was one of ten candidates for its best player. He and João Carlos Teixeira both scored twice on 8 February 2020 in a 7–0 win at local rivals Famalicão, who were in contention for a Europa League place.\nEdwards scored the only goal at Boavista on 19 October 2020, his eighth in Portugal's top flight. With that, he surpassed Brian Deane of Benfica in 1998 as the highest scoring Englishman in the history of the league.\nOn 7 January 2021, Edwards' contract was extended to 2024, with a release clause of €50 million. A year and three days later, he came on as a substitute away to Gil Vicente, won and scored a penalty with three minutes remaining, and was then sent off in a 3–2 loss.\nSporting CP\nEdwards was transferred to reigning Primeira Liga champions Sporting CP on 31 January 2022 for a fee of €7.67 million with a further €500,000 if certain objectives are met. Sporting bought the 50% of his economic rights held by Vitória, while sending Bruno Gaspar and Geny Catamo in the opposite direction, on a permanent basis and a loan respectively. He made his debut two days later in a 4–1 win away to B-SAD, replacing Pablo Sarabia for the final 19 minutes; his first goal was on 19 March against his former employers Vitória de Guimarães, concluding a 3–1 away win with a long-range strike in the eighth minute of added time, having again replaced Sarabia with four minutes remaining.\nOn 7 September 2022, Edwards scored his first Champions League goal and provided an assist in a 3–0 away win against Eintracht Frankfurt, while on 26 October, he scored a goal in a 1–1 away draw against his former club, Tottenham Hotspur. In Sporting's run in the 2022–23 Taça da Liga he scored in a 6–0 rout of Farense in the first group game, and a 5–0 quarter-final win against Braga also at the Estádio José Alvalade; he started in the final on 28 January, a 2–0 loss to Porto in which he had a goal ruled out for offside.\nIn January 2023, Sporting received 15% more of Edwards's economic rights from Tottenham Hotspur, as part of the deal that saw Pedro Porro loaned, and later transferred, to Tottenham Hotspur.\nBurnley\nOn 3 February 2025, Edwards returned to England, joining Championship club Burnley on loan until the end of the season. On 8 February, Edwards scored on his debut, netting the only goal in a victory over Southampton in the fourth round of the FA Cup. On 20 May, Burnley announced the player would be joining the club on a permanent basis.\nInternational career\nEdwards is eligible to play for England through his father and Cyprus through his mother.\nIn November 2013, Edwards made his England U16 debut, where he played 80 minutes, in a 1–0 loss against Northern Ireland. He went on to make six appearances and scoring once for the U16 side.\nIn the England under-17 side, Edwards scored three times throughout 2014, including a brace on his debut in a 5–1 win over Iceland. Edwards was selected to represent England at the 2015 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. During the tournament, he made five appearances, and scored two goals against Italy and the Republic of Ireland. He was subsequently included in the team of the tournament. Edwards also appeared at the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup.\nIn September 2015, Edwards was called up to the England U18 squad, making his debut in a 2–0 win over the Netherlands, in which he set up one of the goals. He also scored a brace on two occasions against Austria and the Republic of Ireland in March 2016. Edwards made five appearances and scored four times for England U18.\nIn October 2016, Edwards was called up to the England under-19 squad, making his debut in a 3–1 win over Croatia before scoring in a follow-up match with a 2–1 win over Bulgaria. He was included in the squad for the 2017 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. In the semi-final, he came off the bench to provide the assist for Lukas Nmecha to score the only goal of the game against the Czech Republic. He was also a second-half substitute during the victory against Portugal in the final.\nAfter the end of the tournament, Edwards was called up to the England U20 squad in August 2017 and scored on his  debut, in a 3–0 win over the Netherlands.\nPersonal life\nEdwards is of Greek Cypriot descent through his mother.\nCareer statistics\n}}\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Europe\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Tottenham Hotspur\n|2016–17\n|Premier League\n|0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0\n|-\n|Tottenham Hotspur U21\n|2017–18\n|colspan=3|—||colspan=2|—||colspan=2|—||colspan=2|—||1||0||1||0\n|-\n|Norwich City (loan)\n|2017–18\n|Championship\n|1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0\n|-\n|Excelsior (loan)\n|2018–19 Excelsior Rotterdam season|2018–19\n|Eredivisie\n|25||2||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||0||28||2\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Vitória de Guimarães\n|2019–20 Vitória S.C. season|2019–20\n|Primeira Liga\n|26||7||0||0||4||0||5||2||colspan=\"2\"|—||35||9\n|-\n|2020–21\n|Primeira Liga\n|33||3||2||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||36||3\n|-\n|2021–22\n|Primeira Liga\n|18||7||2||1||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||24||8\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!77!!17!!4!!1!!9!!0!!5!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|—!!95!!20\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Sporting CP\n|2021–22\n|Primeira Liga\n|12||3||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||15||3\n|-\n|2022–23\n|Primeira Liga\n|33||7||1||0||5||2||12||3||colspan=\"2\"|—||51||12\n|-\n|2023–24\n|Primeira Liga\n|26||4||5||1||3||0||10||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||44||6\n|-\n|2024–25\n|Primeira Liga\n|6||1||1||2||1||0||1||0||1||0||10||3\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!77!!15!!9!!3!!9!!2!!24!!4!!1!!0!!120!!24\n|-\n|Burnley (loan)\n|2024–25\n|Championship\n|14||1||2||1||colspan=\"2\" |—|| colspan=\"2\" |—||colspan=\"2\" |—||16||2\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Burnley\n|2025–26\n|Premier League\n|3||0||0||0||2||0|| colspan=\"2\" |—||colspan=\"2\" |—||5||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!17!!1!!2!!1!!2!!0!!colspan=\"2\" |—!!colspan=\"2\" |—!!21!!2\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!197!!35!!16!!5!!21!!2!!29!!6!!4!!0!!267!!48\n|}\nHonours\nSporting CP\n*Primeira Liga: 2023–24\nEngland U19\n*UEFA European Under-19 Championship: 2017\nIndividual\n*UEFA European U-17 Championship Team of the Tournament: 2015\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.thefa.com/england/all-teams/players?p=355905 England profile] at The FA\n*"
