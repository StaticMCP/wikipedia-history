Dutton to recognize a previously unpublished work of fiction or non-fiction relating to animals. The reward for the winner was a $7,500 to $15,000 advanced against royalties after publication of the book by Dutton. The award was inspired by the success of Gavin Maxwell's Ring of Bright Water (1960), the story of two otters. The award was presented between 1963 and 1969; there was a 6-year hiatus with one more award presented in 1975.\nWinners\n*1963: Sterling North, Rascal\n*1964: Robert William Murphy, The Pond\n*1965: Walt Morey, Gentle Ben\n*1966: Faith McNulty, The Whooping Crane: The Bird That Defies Extinction\n*1967: Daniel P.
