Gill graduated from Washington University in St. Louis.\nGill is best known for failing to touch second base in a game against the Chicago Cubs on September 4, 1908.  With the game tied at 0 in the bottom of the 10th, Chief Wilson stroked a two-out single that scored the winning run.  However, Johnny Evers saw that Gill did not touch second base.  Umpire Hank O'Day, the only umpire working the game that day, said he did not see it and called the game over with a Pirates victory.\nThree weeks later on September 23, 1908, New York Giants player Fred Merkle repeated Gill's error during a game against the Cubs, a play that subsequently entered baseball lore as Merkle's Boner.\nIn 27 major league games, Gill posted a .224 batting average (17-for-76) with 10 runs and 14 RBIs. Defensively, he handled 244 total chances (237 putouts, 7 assists) at first base without an error for a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://graceandknowledge.faithweb.com/merkle.html Story of the 1908 season with a section on Gill's play]"
