It is the only species in the genus Notiomys, although species of Chelemys and Geoxus'' were formerly included in that genus.\nDescription\nEdwards's long-clawed mouse is a small mouse with a short tail, having a total length of about , including a tail of about . The dorsal fur is dense and soft and about  long, each hair having a grey shaft and being tipped with ochre, giving an agouti effect. The underparts have grey hairs tipped with white, and the two body colours are separated by grey hairs tipped with orange. The eyes are small, the snout is tipped with a pink, leathery button, and the sides of the muzzle have orange spots. The whiskers are white, the longest being about  in length. The pinnae are small and rounded, the thin margins being clad in white hairs. The tail is well furred, being buffy-white above and white below. The fore feet have long nails some  in length. The hind feet are short and broad, being fringed with bristly hairs at the sides, and having furred heel pads and naked soles; they have  claws.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe species is endemic to Santa Cruz Province, Chubut Province and Río Negro Province in southern Argentina. Its typical habitats are shrubby and herbaceous steppe, grassy steppes and rocky plateaus with shrubs and bunchgrass.\nEcology\nThe ecology of this burrowing mouse has been little studied. It mostly feeds on insects but may also consume seeds. One specimen was found inside the burrow of a Haig's tuco-tuco (Ctenomys haigi). Before 1998, only eight localities across Patagonia were known. More recently, as a result of more-intensive surveys, over fifty localities have been identified, some by finding the remains of mice in owl pellets.\nConservation status\nEdwards's long-clawed mouse has a wide range and is present in several protected areas. It is common in some places and uncommon in others, and is assumed to have a large total population. No particular threats have been identified and the population appears to be steady, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \"least concern\".\nReferences\nLiterature cited\n*Duff, A. and Lawson, A. 2004.
