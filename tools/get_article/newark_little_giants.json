They played in the Eastern League for one year until moving to the International League in 1887.\nNewark featured the first all African-American battery with George Stovey, pitching a 2.46 ERA, and catcher Moses Fleetwood Walker (also first African-American to play in the majors), who had a .264 batting average.\nThe Little Giants went out of business in 1888. They returned to the minors in 1889 and won second place in the Atlantic Association. After taking third in 1890, Newark again went out of business, this time forever."
