      "text": "# Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994\n\n| most wickets     = Tim Munton (81)\n| most catches     = Dermot Reeve (18)\n| most dismissals  = Keith Piper (66)\n| prevseason       = 1993\n| nextseason       = 1995\n}}\nWarwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994 achieved the unprecedented feat of winning three trophies in an English domestic season. The treble included titles in the County Championship, Sunday League and Benson & Hedges Cup while the grand slam was narrowly missed as they lost to Worcestershire in the final of the Natwest Trophy. Wisden described it as the 'most remarkable season by any side in the history of county cricket'.\nWarwickshire, captained by Dermot Reeve and coached by Bob Woolmer, won the County Championship by 42 points from second placed Leicestershire, the largest winning margin since 1979. During the 17 match season Warwickshire won eleven and lost just once, with the remainder draws. The solitary defeat came at home against Nottinghamshire when they lost by an innings. In one-day competitions they won 21 of their 26 matches.\nThe signing of Brian Lara as overseas player played a key role in the success, arriving days after recording a Test record innings of 375 he began the season with six centuries in seven innings which culminated against Durham County Cricket Club when he scored a first-class record 501 not out. He finished the season with nine centuries and a total of 2,066 runs at an average of 89.82, topping both run scoring and average lists for the season. His one-day performances paled in comparison, he scored 634 runs at 28.81 with a best of 81.\nBackground\nIn the 1993 season Warwickshire finished the County Championship in 16th position amongst the 18 counties. Two batsmen, Andy Moles and Dominic Ostler passed 1,000 runs while only Neil Smith, with 44, took more than 30 wickets. In one-day competitions they finished 10th in the National League, were knocked out of the first round of the Benson and Hedges Cup, and won the Natwest Trophy. They beat Sussex by five wickets in the Lord's final, chasing down 322 with Asif Din scoring a century and Dermot Reeve finishing unbeaten on 81.\nThe main pre-season interest surrounded which overseas player the county would sign. South African fast bowler Allan Donald had been at the club since 1987 but with South Africa touring England in 1994, the first time since re-admission, he would be unavailable for much of the season. The initial target was Indian all-rounder Manoj Prabhakar but he failed a fitness test on 6 April because of an ankle injury. The second choice was West Indian batsman Brian Lara and he signed a contract just two days later. Lara was playing in the Caribbean against England at the time and during the fifth Test of the series he scored 375, breaking the Test record for highest individual score.\nThe other significant signing in the close season was left arm spinner Richard Davis from Kent. Despite the acquisitions the club were not expected to mount a Championship challenge and were 25/1 to win the title. Warwickshire's coach for the season was Bob Woolmer who had joined the club in 1991 on a three-year contract. England all-rounder Dermot Reeve was captain for a second season.\nSquad\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"font-size:95%; width:80%;\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Birth date\n! Batting Style\n! Bowling Style\n!

The crowd was left disappointed on the first day as Glamorgan won the toss and chose to bat. The scoring rate on the first day was slow apart from Bermudian David Hemp who scored a maiden first-class century. In response to Glamorgan's 365 Warwickshire scored a total of 657/7 declared which equalled the county record for highest innings. The total was built on a career-best innings from opener Roger Twose, his score of 277 not out also was the second highest by a Warwickshire player. Twose had endured a poor 1993, scoring 224 runs in 11 matches, and surpassed that season's total in his dogged and determined innings which lasted more than ten hours. He shared a 215-run second wicket partnership with Lara, who scored 147 from 160 balls becoming the seventh Warwickshire player to score a hundred on debut. Needing to bat for longer than a day to draw the match Glamorgan lost two early wickets before the close of the third day. They were bowled out mid-afternoon on the final day with Gladstone Small claiming his first five wicket haul since 1990. Richard Davis, on his county debut, took three wickets.\n----\nRain and bad light allowed only 14 balls to be delivered on the first day with Leicestershire, put in, remaining unscathed. On the second day opener and captain Nigel Briers scored his 27th century and first since his return from rupturing an Achilles tendon. He shared a partnership of 108 in 27 overs with Ben Smith (78). Leicestershire batted onto the third morning with Warwickshire's bowlers being too wayward to exploit the helpful conditions. Brian Lara continued his good form by scoring a third consecutive century but Warwickshire were only able to save the follow-on by one run. Roger Twose, with 51, was the only other player to pass 18 as the hosts collapsed from 201/2 to 254, all eight wickets falling to former Warwickshire spinner Adrian Pierson. On the final day Leicestershire batted on until 35 minutes after lunch before declaring to leave Warwickshire a target of 285 from 57 overs. They survived with three wickets remaining but owed a great deal to Lara who was the only person to pass 20, his score of 120 not out made him the first Warwickshire batsman in 10 years to score hundreds in both innings of a match.\n----\nAfter winning the toss and batting first Somerset closed the first day on 255/5, the highest scorer being opener Mark Lathwell who made 86 in nearly four hours. Following his dismissal captain Andy Hayhurst and wicket-keeper Robert Turner shared a fifth wicket stand of 100 which was ended shortly before the close. Hayhurst completed a slow-paced century on the second day, before afternoon showers led to the hosts’ declaration. The wickets were shared amongst the Warwickshire bowlers but Richard Davis did take five catches, one short of a county fielding record. Warwickshire closed on 57 without loss. The third day witnessed no play because of rain so to generate a result both teams declared early on the final day leaving Warwickshire a fourth innings target of 321 from 95 overs. They were well placed on 87/1 at lunch but rain returned to wash out the afternoon session leaving the visitors 33 overs to score the 234 more needed to win. Brian Lara set about the unlikely chase by sharing partnerships of 74 in 9 overs with Paul Smith and then 126 in 14 overs with Asif Din. Lara reached his century, his fifth in consecutive innings, off 72 balls and was dismissed for 136 off 94. Warwickshire completed the victory with 20 balls remaining.\n----\nThe pre-match interest surrounded Brian Lara and his attempt to equal the first-class record of scoring six centuries in consecutive innings. After rain wiped out the first day Lara soon found himself in the middle as Middlesex chose to field first and Warwickshire lost an early wicket. He made 26 before edging a leg side delivery from Richard Johnson through to the wicket-keeper. The visitors were all out for 211, with no batsman passing fifty. Desmond Haynes was dismissed off the first ball of the reply but Middlesex lost no further wickets in the remainder of the day. Mike Roseberry and Mike Gatting, not out overnight, shared 77 for the second wicket before the latter was dismissed for 52. Roseberry also shared 79 with Mark Ramprakash (37) before going on to complete a 17th first-class century. He was ninth out as the middle and lower order offered little resistance and Middlesex's lead was restricted to 38. The deficit was turned into a lead by the close with Lara scoring a 52-ball half-century. He completed a sixth century in seven innings on the final morning, adding 85 from 84 balls, that quick scoring enabled a declaration leaving Middlesex a target of 269 from 50 overs. They began well, reaching 129/1 before Tim Munton took the wickets of Gatting and Ramprakash in consecutive deliveries followed by Roseberry in his next over. The chase continued but another double strike from Munton left Middlesex to settle for the draw.\n----\nDurham won the toss and on an easy paced pitch chose to bat first. After both openers were dismissed inside the first 75 minutes, number three John Morris shared century partnerships with Stewart Hutton (61) and Phil Bainbridge (67). Morris was dismissed early on the second day but his innings of 204 was the highest by a Durham player at the time, it was also his first century for Durham since moving from Derbyshire. An eighth wicket stand of 134 between Anderson Cummins  (62) and David Graveney (65*) boosted the total before a mid-afternoon declaration. The early wicket of Dominic Ostler brought Brian Lara to the crease, dropped on 18 by wicket-keeper Chris Scott at the close Lara was 111 not out and had become the first player to score seven centuries in eight innings. The third day of the match was rained off and with the captains unable to agree on a target, Lara had free rein to bat on. He took the opportunity by scoring 174 runs in the pre-lunch session, in the afternoon he added a further 133 and in the process beat the previous best by a Warwickshire player (305* by Frank Foster) and passed 1,000 runs for the season in only his seventh innings. After tea he passed Archie MacLaren's 424, the highest score in England, and progressed to 497 by the time of the final over. Still two runs short of the first-class record, Lara was made aware it was the last over of the match by batting partner Keith Piper after the fourth ball, the next delivery was driven for four to break the record. Lara's innings took 427 balls and lasted less than eight hours. He broke the records for most boundaries in an innings (72) and most runs in a single day (390). Trevor Penney contributed just 44 to a third wicket partnership of 314 with Lara while the unbeaten fifth wicket partnership between Lara and Piper was worth 322. The team total of 810/4 bettered the county record by over 150 runs.\n----\nHaving won the toss and batted first, Warwickshire pair of Roger Twose and Dominic Ostler (94) put on 196, their largest opening partnership of the season. The stand delayed the appearance of Brian Lara, in his first Championship innings since his record-breaking innings he made a sketchy 19. Contributions down the order took the total past 400 by the time of their dismissal shortly after lunch on the second day. After the early loss of Mark Benson, Kent batted cautiously until Carl Hooper's arrival at 60/2. He batted fluently in reaching a century from 131 balls and shared 109 in 28 overs for the third wicket with David Ward (63). On the third day Richard Davis took a sharp return catch to dismiss Hooper and although Matthew Fleming struck an aggressive 73, Warwickshire were able to gain a first innings lead. The hosts openers put on a second century stand of the match, before 86 runs in 55 minutes on the fourth morning allowed a declaration. The target of 347 off 82 overs on a turning pitch proved too much as Kent's batsmen were unable to go on after making starts. Neil Smith's figures of 7/133 were a career best while fellow spinner Davis took the other three wickets.\n----\nWarwickshire won the toss and built a formidable first day total of 448/9 after Brian Lara scored an eighth century in eleven innings. His score of 197 took 195 balls and contained 30 fours and 3 sixes. The only bowler to contain Lara was Curtly Ambrose who conceded 12 runs from the 45 balls he delivered to him. The second highest score was 39 from Trevor Penney who put on 168 in 31 overs with Lara. The last wicket partnership between Graeme Welch and Tim Munton grew to 68 before the innings was ended. Early in the reply Munton took the wickets of both openers before a 137 run partnership between Allan Lamb and Rob Bailey (54) recovered the situation. Welch, on his Championship debut, took the wickets of Lamb, Bailey and Mal Loye in a 22 ball spell and Northamptonshire lost their last 5 wickets for 27 runs allowing Warwickshire to enforce the follow on. Northamptonshire fared better second time around despite losing their first four wickets by the time the score reached 83. Loye and Kevin Curran (56) repaired the innings so the hosts ended day three with a lead of 84 runs and three wickets remaining. Loye, 99 overnight, reached his century before his seven-hour innings was ended. The resistance was continued by Russell Warren (94) and tail-ender Paul Taylor who took 113 balls for his 26. Needing 228 in 38 overs, Warwickshire won with three balls to spare. Dominic Ostler and Roger Twose (39) shared a fourth consecutive century opening stand while Penney, promoted to number three, added 43.\n----\nLancashire won the toss and chose to bat first. After losing both openers cheaply, John Crawley and Neil Fairbrother (76) put together a third wicket partnership of 164. Crawley's innings took him past 1,000 runs for the season, the third man to pass the landmark in 1994. Lancashire collapsed from a strong position of 274/3 to 342/9 with Welch taking three wickets in 19 balls. Despite missing Brian Lara the match with a knee injury, Warwickshire's top order performed well ending day two on 350/3. Opener Andy Moles scored 87 from 222 balls while Trevor Penney reached a sixth first-class hundred. Jason Radcliffe, making his first appearance of the season, added 69. The hosts collapsed on the third morning losing their last seven wickets for 28 runs, four of those fell to Glen Chapple. The clay pitch was now offering indifferent bounce and after making a good start to their second innings Lancashire themselves collapsed from 100/1 to 194 all out. Neil Smith took 7/42 and bettered his career best figures for the second successive home match. With rain threatening, the target was chased urgently, the last 72 runs being scored in 12 overs. Roger Twose's top score of 90 contained eleven fours and two sixes.\n----\nSurrey chose to bowl first on a green pitch and made use of the conditions to reduce Warwickshire to 52/5. Paul Smith suffered injuries to his hand and elbow but batted on to score 34 in two hours while Graeme Welch and Dougie Brown (54) both scored maiden first-class fifties putting on 110 for the ninth wicket. Alec Stewart and Graham Thorpe (38) added 107 for the second wicket before losing five wickets to the medium pace of Roger Twose in a nine over spell on the first evening. The last four wickets fell inside half an hour on the second morning, Tim Munton took three of those while Twose took the other to finish with career best figures. Opener Andy Moles scored his first century of the season and with contributions from Brian Lara (44) and  Twose (31), Warwickshire built a substantial lead by the end of the second day. The best support came from Neil Smith who scored 57 and added 131 with Moles for the sixth wicket. Moles remained unbeaten, his innings breaking the record for the highest at the ground. By the close of the third day Surrey had lost five wickets. The lower order scored quickly on the final morning but could not prevent a heavy defeat. Munton and Neil Smith bowled throughout the final session, Munton took 5/96 to end with match figures of 9/137 and Smith took four wickets.\n----\nWinning the toss, Warwickshire batted aggressively in their first innings. Brian Lara top scored with 70 from 81 balls, which included 11 fours and a six; there were also fifties from Andy Moles and Neil Smith. In the field Nick Knight took five catches, equalling the county record, and affected a run out. Before the close Essex had lost two wickets to Graeme Welch. Essex batted unconvincingly and only saved the follow-on by four runs. Knight scored his first championship half-century for two years and Nasser Hussain added 53 but both were caught by Keith Piper who took seven catches in the innings, a county record. Tim Munton took the last six wickets to fall, five in a twelve over spell after lunch. Moles and Roger Twose shared a century opening stand and Warwickshire closed the second day on 156/3, a lead of 302. Twose was dismissed early on the third day and the last seven wickets added 106 to increase the lead past 400. Opener Knight was the mainstay of Essex's second innings, he scored more than half the total and was last man out for 113. The second highest score was 26 from Jonathan Lewis who added 79 with Knight for the second wicket. Munton dismissed Lewis and Hussain before Dougie Brown was introduced and took four quick wickets, Munton returned to take Knight, his tenth wicket of the match.\n----\nDerbyshire won the toss and on a green pitch bowled first. Brian Lara struck his eighth century of the season including a hundred, off 94 balls, before lunch. He put on 160 for the fourth wicket with Trevor Penney (41) who was the only other batsman to pass 17. Tim Munton took three wickets as Derbyshire closed day one on 165/6. On the second morning Munton took the remaining four wickets in 23 balls to finish with 7/52, his seventh five wicket haul and best figures of the season. Dominic Ostler and Andy Moles (63) added 114 in 29 overs for the third wicket after the fall of Lara for 51 off 45. Derbyshire captain Kim Barnett took the wicket of Moles which sparked a collapse from 190/2, his leg-spin took five wickets while off-spinner Matthew Vandrau claimed three. The second day closed with Derbyshire on 26/1 in pursuit of 342. Munton took two wickets in his opening spell to reduce the hosts to 35/4, from there wickets fell regularly with off-spinner Neil Smith taking 5/69. Wicket-keeper Keith Piper took seven dismissals in the innings, equalling the Warwickshire record for the second match running. He also took 11 dismissals in the match which broke the county record and was one short of the first-class record.\n----\nWorcestershire chose to bowl first on a gloomy first day which saw 62 overs lost to the weather. Warwickshire lost three wickets on the opening day, openers Andy Moles and Roger Twose both scored 39 with Brian Lara making five. On the second day Warwickshire lost their last seven wickets for 87 in 44 overs, Stuart Lampitt was the pick of the bowlers taking three wickets to finish with figures of 4/32. Worcestershire openers Philip Weston and Tim Curtis had both scored unbeaten half-centuries before the close. The pair had shared 208 for the opening partnership when Weston fell six short of a first century of the season, Curtis went on to score 180 in over eight hours of batting. In the post-tea session David Leatherdale (71*) and Lampitt (56*) capitalised on poor bowling to boost the total by 133 in 25 overs. A declaration left Warwickshire with a deficit of 257 and 116 overs to play, in a 14 over spell on the third evening they lost two wickets. Nightwatchman Graeme Welch (66) and Moles (67) put on 135 for the third wicket and with further half-centuries from Trevor Penney and Lara (57) Warwickshire comfortably survived the final day to draw the match.\n----\nWarwickshire won the toss and fielded first on an overcast day and slow pitch. Stand-in captain Tim Munton took an early wicket but Nottinghamshire dominated the first day with Paul Pollard scoring a century in 295 minutes. He shared hundred partnerships with both Graeme Archer (41) and Paul Johnson (63) as the visitors closed a curtailed opening day on 268/4. Chris Lewis dominated the scoring on day two, taking his overnight score of 20 to 220 not out by the time of the declaration. He scored 21 fours and 6 sixes in his innings, and added 157 in 27 overs with Kevin Evans. Warwickshire lost three wickets in the remaining 20 over session. Warwickshire were made to follow on despite lower order resistance from Graeme Welch. He scored a career best 84 not out sharing in an eighth wicket stand of 68 with Neil Smith and added 86 with tail-enders Gladstone Small and Munton. Following on, Brian Lara was dismissed for a duck which brought his season average below 100 for the first time. The hosts closed day three on 134/3 with Roger Twose unbeaten on 74. Twose and overnight partner, Trevor Penney, were both dismissed inside the first 10 overs of the final day to reduce hopes of drawing the match. Three other wickets fell before lunch and Nottinghamshire's victory was achieved 45 minutes after the interval when Munton fell to Lewis, his sixth of the match.\n----\nYorkshire won the toss and batted first on a slow but flat pitch. They had lost five wickets for 175 by mid afternoon but a sixth wicket stand of 94 between Bradley Parker and Peter Hartley (61) boosted the total. Parker's innings was a career best and contained eight fours. Debutant Alex Wharf claimed Brian Lara as his maiden wicket in first-class cricket, to leave Warwickshire on 44/2. Opener Andy Moles (65) and Dominic Ostler put on 191 in 67 overs for the third wicket, building the platform for a significant first innings lead. Twose innings included 21 fours and a six and fell six runs short of a career best score. The visitors closed day two with a lead of 36 and five wickets remaining. Welch scored a third fifty in consecutive matches and aided by contributions from the lower order the lead was increased to 149. Yorkshire began well in response, openers Martyn Moxon and Michael Vaughan (49) put on 93 before the latter was bowled by Richard Davis. Davis took two further wickets in quick succession to reduce them to 109/3. Moxton reached a third century of the season and alongside Richard Blakey put on 92 before play ended. Moxton added 10 to his overnight score but a fluent 77 from Blakey and a spirited 46 by Wharf saw the innings well into the final afternoon. Davis took three further wickets, finishing with his first five wicket haul for the club. The target for Warwickshire was 199 in 49 overs and an opening stand of 89 in 16 overs between Moles (48) and Twose ensured it was a comfortable chase, achieved with eight and a half overs in hand.\n----\nAfter rain delayed the start until 2.30pm, Sussex won the toss and batted first. They made a solid start, reaching 59/1 after 90 minutes of play before Roger Twose in his fourth over took three wickets. Jamie Hall and Peter Moores (29) steadied the innings with a partnership of 42 but the wicket of Hall caused a collapse from 103/4 to 131 all out. Warwickshire lost two wickets in the remaining three overs. With the visitors on 67/5 the match was evenly poised but Dominic Ostler and Trevor Penney (24) put on 67 for the sixth wicket, Ostler was the only player to score a half-century in the match. A ninth wicket stand of 30 between Graeme Welch and Gladstone Small increased the lead past 50, substantial under the circumstances. Sussex lost regular wickets in their second innings and closed day two on 107/8 with top scoring Martin Speight unbeaten on 38. Tim Munton dismissed Speight with the second ball of the third day and shortly afterwards took the final wicket to finish with eight wickets in the match. Requiring 76 to win, openers Andy Moles and Twose saw Warwickshire to victory without loss.\n----\nHampshire chose to bat first on winning the toss; they began slowly before a collapse of five wickets for ten runs in eight overs. The position of 129/1 had been built by Paul Terry who scored 71 and shared stands of 74 and 55 with Tony Middleton (18) and Giles White (30) respectively. They recovered from 139/6 with Shaun Udal adding 64 and Rajesh Maru scoring 32. By the close Hampshire had been dismissed, Tim Munton finishing the innings with his fourth wicket of the day and 500th of his career. Warwickshire dominated a curtailed second day, scoring 210 in three hours of play. Andy Moles was the sole wicket to fall, and that brought together left-handers Roger Twose and Brian Lara who shared an unbeaten second wicket stand of 156 in 28 overs. When play was abandoned Lara had scored 89 from 93 balls and Twose 84 from 121. The partnership was extended to 295, the highest for any Warwickshire wicket against Hampshire. Lara's score was his ninth century for the club and took him past 2,000 runs for the season. Twose's innings of 137 took five hours and contained 19 boundaries. After their dismissals the middle order looked to score quickly but rain again restricted play. Warwickshire closed with a lead of 205 and four wickets remaining. They batted on for 40 minutes into the final morning increasing the lead by 53 runs. Munton dismissed both openers before spinners Neil Smith and Richard Davis took over, taking the remaining eight wickets including a spell of five wickets in five overs. The innings victory secured the County Championship title for Warwickshire, their first since 1972.\n----\nThe fixture was drawn with only one day, the third, of play possible. Gloucestershire won the toss and chose to bat first, Dean Hodgson scored a century having endured a poor season. He added 110 for the second wicket with Matt Windows (63) and there were contributions down the order from Tim Hancock (70) and Martyn Ball (38).

Captain Dermot Reeve described this as \"extremely disappointing\" mentioning the names of Tim Munton, Roger Twose, Dominic Ostler and Neil Smith as surprising omissions. Coach Bob Woolmer said it was \"unbelievable\" and also picked out Twose, Ostler and Smith as deserving of a place in the A team at least. Journalist Alan Lee selected a possible 15 man squad before the announcement and chose Twose, Munton, Ostler and Piper.\nFor their performances in 1994 Brian Lara and Tim Munton were both named amongst the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1995 Wisden. Pat Murphy wrote of the Championship celebrations:\nThe biggest cheer, one laced with affection and respect, went to Tim Munton. That was not just for an outstanding personal season, nor for his golden run as stand-in captain for the injured Dermot Reeve, but also for Munton's high standards of professionalism, his durability and his approachability. The supporters had not forgotten Munton selfless performances in many undistinguished seasons for the club, his tireless commitment to his job, his willingness to meet every autograph request and to exchange cheery banter at any time of his working day.\nFollowing the end of the season Bob Woolmer left the club to coach South Africa, his successor was Phil Neale who alongside captain Dermot Reeve led Warwickshire to another successful season. They won two trophies, retaining the County Championship and winning the Natwest Trophy and narrowly missed a third by finishing second to Kent in the Sunday League, losing out on run rate. Allan Donald returned as overseas player and took 88 Championship wickets at 15.48. The major close season signing was Essex opener Nick Knight.\nReferences"
