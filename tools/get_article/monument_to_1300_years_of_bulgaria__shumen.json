It was built in 1981 to commemorate the 1300th anniversary of the First Bulgarian Empire.\nThe monument is built in concrete in a Cubist style, and was designed by Bulgarian sculptors Krum Damyanov and Ivan Slavov. It is reached by a processional concrete stairway from Shumen, or by road.  It stands at a height of 450 m above sea level and can be seen from 30&nbsp;km away.\nThe monument was featured on the cover of Daniel Caesar's 2017 debut album Freudian.\nGallery\nImage:Monument and Shumen.jpg|View to the monument\nImage:Suzdateli na bg durjava otvutre.JPG|Inside view\nFile:Хан Крум и синове.jpg|Krum, Omurtag and Tervel monuments\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081014054008/http://www.vimeo.com/1599075 High definition video of the Shumen 1300 Years monument]"
