They narrowly finished ahead of English team of Ann Packer, Dorothy Hyman, Daphne Arden and Betty Moore and the New Zealand quartet of Nola Bond, Molly Cowan, Doreen Porter and Avis McIntosh who won bronze. England was leading by five yards coming in the final baton change, however Moore started her run too early and had to stop almost dead before receiving the baton. This cost England dearly as Cuthbert caught Moore two yards from the finish.\nRecords\n(Madeleine Weston, Dorothy Hyman, June Paul, Heather Young)\n| world_mark    = 45.3\n| world_place   = Cardiff, Wales\n| world_date    = 27 July 1958\n| world_ref     =\n| games_athlete = (Madeleine Weston, Dorothy Hyman, June Paul, Heather Young)\n| games_mark    = 45.3\n| games_place   = Cardiff, Wales\n| games_date    = 27 July 1958\n| games_ref     =\n}}\nFinal\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
