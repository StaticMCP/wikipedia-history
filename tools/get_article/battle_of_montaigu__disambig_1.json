Taken by surprise, this division fought back but lost 400 men, including many captured. Some of these prisoners were summarily executed by the Vendeens and their bodies later found in the castle wells by troops under Jean-Baptiste Kléber.\nFollowing this battle Beysser was recalled to Paris, compromised by his Girondin past, condemned to death with the Hébertists, and guillotined on 13 April 1794.\nSources\n*Yves Gras, La Guerre de Vendée, éditions Economica, 1994, p.&nbsp;75."
