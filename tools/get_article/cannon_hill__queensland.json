In the , Cannon Hill had a population of 6,701 people.\nGeography\nThe suburb is located  by road east of the Brisbane CBD.\nHistory\nCannon Hill was originally inhabited by Aboriginal people but, after being accused of \"intimidating\" the settlers, they were \"dispersed\" by the Native Police and Brisbane Mounted Police in November 1861, around the time when British settlement began in the area. Some land was used by settlers for farming and grazing, but the area remained mostly bushland.\nThe suburb is most likely named after Cannon Hill House, a residence formerly located on Wynnum Road. It was occupied by the Weedon family from its construction in 1867 until burning down in 1926. Thornhill Weedon named the house after two fallen trees which were said to have resembled a cannon.\nThe Cleveland railway line was opened in 1889 going through Cannon Hill to Cleveland. At the same time blocks of land near the station were offered for sale.\nCannon Hill State School opened on 16 August 1915.\nIn February 1917, the Cannon Hill Progress Association proposed that a School of Arts be established in the district and a campaign of fund raising commenced. In June 1917 a land parcel of  was reserved for the School of Arts. In August 1922 it was announced that construction of the building was underway, although the stumps (the foundations of a Queenslander building) were not in place until February 1923. The building was to be  and to be used as a dancing and concert hall, gymnasium and reading and recreation room purposes. Although intended to be two storeys, by June 1923 it was decided to just construct one storey initially to avoid going into debt. A stump-capping ceremony was held on 9 June 1923. The School of Arts was completed in 1923, consisting of a large hall and a library.\nOn Sunday 14 June 1925, Archbishop James Duhig blessed and laid the foundation stone of the new Catholic presbytery. He also blessed and opened St Finbar's Convent to be occupied by the Sisters of Charity. He returned in August 1925 to officially open the presbytery.\nCannon Hill Presbyterian Church opened in 1930 with the financial assistance of William Robert Black. It was a timber building designed by Brisbane architect George Trotter. The stump-capping ceremony was held on 22 March 1930 and the church was officially opened on 17 May 1930. The church property was sold in 2002 for $220,000 and has been converted into a private home.\nIn 1931, Brisbane's sale yards for livestock were relocated from Newmarket to Cannon Hill adjacent to the abattoir. The sale yards at Cannon Hill were described as \"a paradise as compared to the old yards at Newmarket\" and \"possibly the best in the Southern Hemisphere\". Specifically the yards had been specially constructed to prevent the bruising of cattle and the meat could be produced more hygienically for both local consumption and export.\nBlessed Oliver Plunkett School opened in January 1947 with an initial enrolment of 90 students. It was operated by the Presentation Sisters, a Roman Catholic order of nuns. When Oliver Plunkett was canonised on 12 October 1975 by Pope Paul VI, the school was renamed Saint Oliver Plunkett School. In December 1986 the involvement of the Presentation Sisters in the school ceased and a lay principal was appointed.\nSt Boniface's Anglican Church Room was opened circa 1952. It closed circa 1964.\nCannon Hill Kmart Plaza opened in 1973. Kmart is still situated in the original building. The eastern wing housing Woolworths supermarket is a newer addition. The shopping mart behind the Cannon Hill Shopping Centre, including anchor tenants Aldi and Bunnings, was previously the site of a drive-in cinema.\nIn 1994, a Cannon Hill paddock became one of the first places where Hendra virus was transmitted between bats and horses. The infected mare was taken to a training complex, starting an outbreak that eventually killed horse trainer Vic Rail (horse trainer). The paddock has since been turned into housing and parkland in Murarrie.\nDemographics\nIn the , Cannon Hill had a population of 5,533 people.
