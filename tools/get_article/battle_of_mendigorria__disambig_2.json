The Carlists were commanded by Vicente González Moreno, who assumed this post after the death of Zumalacárregui at the Siege of Bilbao.  The Carlist pretender Don Carlos was also at Mendigorría.\nWhen the Liberals attacked, the Carlists found themselves in a difficult strategic position: they had the Arga River behind them and only one way across, the Bridge of Larraga.\nThe Liberal left flank was led by Baldomero Espartero, the central flank by Luis Fernández de Córdova.\nThe Carlist fiercely defended themselves but were forced to retreat.  Don Carlos was able to escape thanks to the efforts of the defense of the Larraga bridge by the Carlist brigadier Bruno Villarreal.\nPlan of battle of Mendigorría\nThe battle was a Liberal victory, though the Liberals did not press forward and take advantage of the situation.\nExternal links\n*[http://zm.gipuzkoakultura2.net/19thcenturymilitaryhistory/batalla-mendigorria.php?titulo=MENDIGORRIA.%201835-VII-16&negrita=men MENDIGORRIA. 1835-VII-16]"
