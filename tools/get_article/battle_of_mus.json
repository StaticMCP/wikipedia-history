One of the commanders involved in the battle was Mustafa Kemal, who later became known as Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey. The battle resulted in a Russian victory. After about three weeks of fighting, the Russians captured the city of Muş. The Ottoman Second Army suffered heavy casualties and was nearly destroyed.\nBattle\nFollowing major Russian victories in the northern theater, as well as the Russian capture of Bitlis in the south, the Ottoman forces faced significant setbacks. The Ottomans were forced to redeploy troops, including veterans from the successful defense of Gallipoli against Russia's Western allies.\nOn 3 August, with a significant manpower advantage of 2.5 to 1, the Ottomans launched a general offensive against Russian forces along the entire front. After heavy fighting, the Russians abandoned Muş by 8 August. Ultimately, however, the 1st Russian Division managed to turn the tide and decisively defeat four Ottoman divisions. Due to the remote location, the initial phase of the battle presented logistical challenges for the Russians, who in some areas faced Ottoman forces which outnumbered them as much as 4 to 1.\nThrough fierce resistance, as well as the effective deployment of new mobile artillery, the Russians inflicted significant casualties on the Ottomans. Seizing the opportunity, Russian General Nikolai Yudnich launched a counteroffensive against Ottoman force across the entire front.\nThe Russians recaptured Muş on 23 August. Ottoman General Faik Pasha was reportedly killed during the battle. Some sources place General Pasha's death on 24 August or 25 August. However, other sources claim that he died after the battle, on 30 August.\nAftermath\nThe Ottomans' defeat in the Battle of Muş solidified Russia's military dominance. In the aftermath, the Ottoman Second Army suffered heavy losses at the hands of Russian artillery, and it was eventually reduced to the size of a corps.\nReferences\nNotes\nLiterature\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Allen W.
