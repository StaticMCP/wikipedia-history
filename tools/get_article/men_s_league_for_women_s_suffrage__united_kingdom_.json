E. M. Joad, Hugh Franklin, Henry Harben, Gerald Gould, Charles Mansell-Moullin, Israel Zangwill and 32 others. Graham Moffat founded the Northern Men's League for Women's Suffrage in Glasgow also in 1907 and wrote a suffrage propaganda play, The Maid and the Magistrate.\nBertrand Russell stood as a suffrage candidate in the 1907 Wimbledon by election.\nBy 1910 Henry Brailsford and Lord Lytton had, with Millicent Fawcett's permission, created a proposal that might have been the basis of an agreement that caused the suffrage movement to declare a truce on 14 February.\nIn 1911 they successfully took Liberals in Bradford to court for assaulting Alfred Hawkins. Alfred had shouted a question during a speech by Winston Churchill and he was ejected from the hall without warning. The judge considered this to be assault. Hawkins had received a fractured kneecap and he was awarded £100 plus costs. The group heard from orators including George Lansbury, Edith Mansell-Moullin, and Victor Duval in March 1912. Speakers there expressed their disgust at the treatment of William Ball, a male suffrage supporter and hunger striker, for being not only force-fed but effectively driven to lunacy and separated from his family by the authorities. Nevison produced a pamphlet on his case for the League, with the subtitle \"Official Brutality on the increase\".\nSee also\n* Women's Social and Political Union, which included male members in the Men’s Political Union for Women’s Enfranchisement (MPU).\n* Women's suffrage\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060514113440/http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/bl1911_womens.htm Women's suffrage societes] (archived 14 May 2006)\n*''[https://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/documents?filter_21=Men's%20League%20For%20Women's%20Suffrage&applyState=true Men's League for Women Suffrage Monthly Paper]'' on LSE Digital Library"
