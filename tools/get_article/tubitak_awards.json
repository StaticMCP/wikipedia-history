These awards recognize the academic contributions of Turkish and foreign scientists in the fields of science and technology, including engineering, and mathematics. Presented by the president of Turkey, the awards are classified into four categories and promote advancements in  science, technology, and innovation.\nWhile the TÜBİTAK Awards are designed to promote advancements in science and technology, they are typically awarded to living individuals (though not exclusively). Recipients of the TÜBİTAK Science and Incentive Awards, recognize scholars for their significant contributions to the global scientific community and receive several accolades. Each awardee is presented with ten gold coins, a gold plaque, and a certificate of achievement. Also, recipients receive cash support amounting to ₺1.25 million () to assist in their ongoing scientific research activities.\nHistory\nThe Science Awards were first established in 1966, followed by the introduction of the Service and Incentive Awards in 1969. In 2007, the TÜBITAK Special Award category was created to recognize the contributions of Turkish scientists living abroad, serving as an equivalent to the Science Award. That same year marked the inclusion of social sciences and humanities among the fields eligible for awards, although the inaugural awards in these disciplines were not presented until 2008. Later in 2019, the president issued Circular No. 2018/6 on September 5, 2018, under which the History of Science Award was presented to professor Fuat Sezgin as a one-time equivalent to the TÜBITAK Science Award.\nSince the inception of the TÜBİTAK Awards in 1966, awards have been presented to a total of 881 scientists, including 206 Science Awards, 20 Special Awards, 89 Service Awards, and 566 Incentive Awards.\nAwards\nScience Award\nThe TÜBİTAK Science Award is awarded to living scientists who have made \"significant contributions to science at the international level\" through their research conducted in Turkey. The award recognizes scientific achievements that contribute to global scientific communities. It is conferred after the eligibility criteria are met. Candidates should be engaged in research and have practically implemented their findings in their respective scientific fields on a global scale.\nSpecial Award\nThe TÜBİTAK Special Award is presented to living scientists who are citizens of the Republic of Turkey and have \"significant contributions to science at the international level\" through their research conducted abroad. This award serves as an equivalent to the Science Award, recognizing the significant impact of Turkish scientists in the global scientific community.\nService Award\nThe TÜBİTAK Service Award is conferred to both living scientists and, posthumously to died scientists. Scientists with \"outstanding contributions to the development of science and technology in Turkey\" are eligible for this award. It is primarily presented to recognizes the \"outstanding impact\" of their work on advancing scientific and technological progress within the country.\nIncentive Award\nThe TÜBİTAK Incentive Award, sometimes referred to as Encouragement Awards, is awarded to scientists residing in Turkey who have demonstrated the potential to make \"significant contributions to science at the international level\" through their research. While the award is designed to encourage early-career researchers, it is presented to candidates under the age of 40 as of the first day of the year the award is presented. It recognizes and promotes early-career researchers who exhibit exceptional qualifications and potential in the field of science.\nNomination\nThe nomination process for the TÜBİTAK awards (excluding Science and Service awards) involves several scientific organizations and institutions. Eligible nominators include TÜBİTAK awardees, the Council of Higher Education, the Turkish Academy of Sciences, and the senates or boards of directors of universities. The highest decision-making bodies of public and private sector institutions operating in science and technological fields are also responsible for nominating the candidates.\nThe Science and Service awardees are independently nominated by the TÜBİTAK board of directors.\nRecipients\nRecipients of Science Award\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | S.
