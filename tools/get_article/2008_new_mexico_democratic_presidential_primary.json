Rather than announcing its distribution of delegate votes, the state would yield to Illinois, which would in turn yield to New York as part of an effort to promote party unity.]]\nAlthough mass media called New Mexico's nominating contest as a caucus, the format was that of a party-run closed primary. Eligible voters included all registered Democrats as of January 4, 2008. Voting occurred between 12 noon and 7 PM Mountain Standard Time. Absentee ballots were available to any voter and were required to be returned by January 28. Delegates were then apportioned based on the results of the primary at the statewide and Congressional district levels, and were formally elected at district and state conventions in April based on the primary results.\nPolls\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"5\" |Final Polling\n|-\n!
