His father was an MP for Ballynakill in the Parliament of Ireland. He was educated privately and at Trinity College, Dublin and succeeded his father in 1801.\nHis paternal grandparents were Gertrude ( Baillie) Moore (a daughter of Capt. Francis Baillie) and John Moore of Drumbanagher, also an MP for Ballynakill.\nCareer\nFrom 1783 to 1790, he represented Enniskillen in the Parliament of Ireland. He was appointed High Sheriff of Donegal for 1799 and served in that role until 1800. In 1802, he represented County Donegal in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, serving until 1818.\nPersonal life\nOn 19 December 1778, Steward married Mary Susanna Whaley, the daughter of Richard Chapell Whaley, MP of Whaley Abbey. Together, they were the parents of two sons and three daughters, including:\n* Anne Stewart (d. 1867), who married William Conolly Staples, son of John Staples, Irish MP, in July 1797. After his death in 1798, she married Richard Napier.\n* Elizabeth Susanna Stewart (d. 1844), who married Charles Moysey, Archdeacon of Bath, in 1820.\n* Sophia Frances Stewart (d. 1852), who married Andrew Rutherfurd, Lord Rutherfurd.\n* Sir James Annesley Stewart, 8th Baronet (1788–1879), who married Jane Mansfield, daughter of Francis Mansfield, in 1830.\n* William Henry Stewart (1793–1820), who fought in the Waterloo Campaign and died unmarried.\nSir James died on 20 May 1827 and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son, James. As his son died without issue in 1879, the baronetcy passed to a distant cousin, Augustus Abraham James Stewart (1832–1889), who became the 9th Baronet.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
