Buckler left his previous band, Slint, in 1989 to start a new musical project. King Kong's first release, Movie Star, featured the other three members of Slint, David Pajo, Britt Walford, and Brian McMahan. King Kong would go on to feature an ever-changing lineup of performers including Richard Schuler, drums on Old Man On The Bridge, 1991 9-song CD, John McEntire, David Grubbs, and Peter Townsend.\nThe song \"Movie Star\" was used in the end credits of the 2014 Slint documentary, Breadcrumb Trail.\nIn 2018, King Kong released three singles: \"60s Apartment Building Balcony\", \"Pawnshopolis\", and \"Pigeon Man\".
