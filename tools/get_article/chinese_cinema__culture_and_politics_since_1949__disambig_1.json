The book's coverage ends in the year 1984.\nContents\nThe chapters are ordered in a chronological manner. The author chose to use the dates 1964-1978 for the Cultural Revolution chapter as the Communist authorities had, in 1964, issued public criticism of several film works.\nReception\nW. J. F. Jenner, in China Quarterly, praised the book for not using \"monstrous language of the higher film criticism\" in film criticism sections, and instead using \"brevity and unpretentiousness\", with a \"clear\" organization and \"quiet and reasonable\" tone. They criticized \"weakness\" in the book's analyses and the book failing to \"go deeply enough into either the culture or the politics of the Chinese film world.\"\nColin Mackerras of Griffith University called the book a \"first-rate study\" and that the \"documentation and bibliography are superb.\" He stated that the book should have had a conclusion section and not a postscript section.\nReferences\n*\n*  - [https://www.proquest.com/openview/577d4c18d8a87585a9d7920c3e39b714/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1817327 See also at] ProQuest\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/arts-theatre-culture/media-mass-communication/chinese-cinema-culture-and-politics-1949?format=HB&isbn=9780521326384 Chinese Cinema: Culture and Politics since 1949] - Cambridge University Press"
