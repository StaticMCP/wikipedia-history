Wellman and starring Robert Taylor, Denise Darcel and John McIntire.\nPlot\nIn 1851, the working men of Whitman's Valley in California are discontented, as there are no women. Roy Whitman, their employer, decides the best way to prevent his men from leaving is to bring in women from the East. Roy heads to Chicago to recruit women willing to take on the arduous journey to California in order to marry. Among the 140 women he signs up are middle-aged widow Patience, pregnant and unmarried Rose Meyers, and former showgirls Fifi Danon and Laurie Smith. The women select their prospective husbands from a bunch of daguerreotypes tacked to a display board. Roy hires experienced wagon master Buck Wyatt to lead the convoy.\nRoy and Buck take the women to St. Joseph, Missouri, where Conestoga wagons and 15 trail hands await them. Kentaro Ito, a determined, short Japanese man, persuades Buck to take him on as the cook. Before setting out, Buck warns the men and the women to stay away from each other, as he has seen wagon trains torn apart by romantic shenanigans. Four experienced women teach the others how to harness draft animals and drive the wagons, and after a week's training, the group begins making its way westward.\nAfter Buck executes one of the trail hands for raping Laurie, all but two trail hands leave in the middle of the night, with eight women going with them. While Roy wants to turn back, they are already halfway to their destination, and Buck believes they can finish the difficult journey if they train the women to defend themselves. While teaching the women to shoot, Tony Moroni, the young son of Italian widow Mrs. Moroni, is accidentally shot and killed. Distraught, Mrs. Moroni refuses to leave her son's grave. Buck hogties her for fear she will commit suicide and leaves her with Patience and Rose in their wagon.\nOver the coming weeks, the group endures many hardships and losses. A band of Native Americans attack, killing Roy, Sid, and six women. Laurie drowns when a heavy rainstorm causes the collapse of a riverbank, plunging her and Fifi's wagon into the water. Fifi and Buck fall in love. At the edge of the desert, Buck orders the women to leave behind their furniture and fancy clothing to lighten the wagon loads. As many of the women proceed on foot, Rose goes into labor and gives birth to a son.\nThey stop to rest near a small lake on the border of Whitman's Valley. Not wanting to meet their future spouses in tattered clothing, the women demand Buck bring them materials to fashion new dresses. Buck rides into town and orders the men to gather any fabric they can find. Once properly dressed, the women drive into town. Patience is the first to look for her prospective husband. Mrs. Moroni meets an Italian citrus farmer, and Rose and her newborn are greeted warmly by the man she chose. While some of the couples dance, others stand in line to be married by the preacher. Ito convinces Fifi to reconcile with Buck, and the two join the marriage line.\nCast\n* Robert Taylor as Buck Wyatt\n* Denise Darcel as Fifi Danon\n* John McIntire as Roy E.

He mentioned the idea to Wellman, who asked if he could take a stab at it. Capra gave him his blessing, and Wellman pitched it to Dore Schary at MGM, who gave him the go-ahead and liked the concept so much that he produced it himself.\nA documentary included in the film's DVD states that it was filmed at various locations in Kane County, Utah. Film locations also include Johnson Canyon, the Gap, Paria, and Surprise Valley in Utah. The documentary also mentions that the actresses all had to learn how to drive a four-horse team pulling a wagon.\nReception\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $2,640,000 in the US and Canada and $1,356,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $266,000.\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 67% from 33 reviews.\nIn 2025, The Hollywood Reporter listed Westward the Women as having the best stunts of 1951.\nRadio adaptation\nWestward the Women was presented on Lux Radio Theatre December 29, 1952. Taylor and Darcel re-created their roles from the film in the one-hour adaptation.\nFilm inspires caravans of women in Spain\nIn 1985, the Spanish village of Plan, Aragon, made the news in Spain when local bachelors organized a \"caravan of women\" following an airing on television of Westward the Women. At the time the plan was conceived, there were over 40 single men and just one single woman in the village, since most of the local women had emigrated. An advertisement in the press calling for \"Women between 20 and 40 with marriage intentions for Pyrenees village\" resulted in 33 marriages, revitalizing the village.\nSince then, other Spanish villages have organized similar \"caravans\".\nThe phenomenon inspired the 1999 Spanish film Flowers from Another World.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://www.allmovie.com/movie/westward-the-women-am146641 Westward the Women at AllMovie]\n*"
