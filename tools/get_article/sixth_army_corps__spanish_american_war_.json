After the declaration of war, General Order 36 of May 7, 1898 approved the organization of eight \"army corps,\" each of which was to consist of three or more divisions of three brigades each.\nGeneral Order 46 of May 16, 1898 assigned commanding officers and training camps to the new corps. Major General James H. Wilson was designated commander, with the corps to assemble at Camp Thomas, Georgia. For reasons that cannot be immediately determined—but which may have stemmed from the near-collapse of organization at Camp Thomas, which was also the mustering point for the First and Third corps—the Sixth Corps was never organized and Wilson was transferred to command of the First Division in the First Army\nCorps.\nReferences\nSee Also\nCorps Badges of the Spanish-American War by Robert Borrel Sr. at [https://www.jstor.org/stable/44031529 JSTOR]"
