The most important parts of the publication were also inserted at the end of all Swedish phone books. The publication contained information about how to act in a situation of national crisis and most notably, nuclear war. Between the 1950s and 1970s, Sweden went through a period with extraordinary high economic growth called the \"record years\" (). This made it possible to invest in civil defence and have a plan to save the entire population even in the event of a superpower invasion. If the war comes was a way to inform the public about these plans. With the end of the Cold War, the publication was deemed to be outdated and distribution ceased in 1991. The most basic information was kept in phone books until the early 21st century.\nIn 2018, the pamphlet was renewed and distributed by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency under the name \"In case of crisis or war\" (). A new version of the pamphlet was distributed in 2024.\nContent\nIn case of crisis or war is a short publication and contains the basic information that the Government of Sweden considered necessary to know in the event of war.  The chapter about civil defence contains the exhortation \"If Sweden is attacked, we will never surrender.\nAny suggestion to the contrary is false.\" (). The publication also contained information about civil defence sirens, how to act in an air raid shelter, and what belongings to bring in the case of a refugee situation.\nEditions\ngrocery store, Brastad, Sweden]]\n*Two pages out of the 1961 edition of \"If crisis or war comes\"Om kriget kommer – vägledning för rikets medborgare i händelse av krig (If the war comes – guidance to the citizens of the nation in case of war), Statens Informationsstyrelse, 1943 (16 pages)\n*Om kriget kommer – vägledning för Sveriges medborgare (If the war comes – guidance for the citizens of Sweden), Kungliga Civilförsvarsstyrelsen, 1952 (33 pages)\n*Om kriget kommer – vägledning för Sveriges medborgare (If the war comes – guidance for the citizens of Sweden), Kungliga Civilförsvarsstyrelsen, 1961 (48 pages)\n*Om kriget kommer – vad du bör veta (If the war comes – what you should know), Beredskapsnämnden för psykologiskt försvar, 1983 (39 pages)\n*Om kriget kommer (If the war comes), Styrelsen för psykologiskt försvar (SPF), 1987 (31 pages)\n*Om kriget eller katastrofen kommer – vad gör vi med barnen?
