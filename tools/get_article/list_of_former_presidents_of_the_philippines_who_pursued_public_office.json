The previous 1973 constitution provided no limit while the 1935 constitution provided only one reelection. The term limit has prevented any incumbent president to run again for the same office; one exception was Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who has served for 3 and a half years to serve the unfinished term of ousted President Joseph Estrada prior to her election in 2004.\nFor executive posts\nPresidency\nThis list only includes former presidents (those who are not in position anymore and seeking for a comeback) who ran again for president.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:center;\" width=80%\n|- valign=bottom\n!colspan=2| President !!
