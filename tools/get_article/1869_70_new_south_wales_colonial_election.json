This election was for all of the 72 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 52 single-member constituencies, six 2-member constituencies and two 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to adult white males. The previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 15 November 1869 by the Governor, Lord Belmore, on the advice of the Premier, John Robertson.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election; instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system. While the government, also called the Ministerial party, was returned in this election, Premier John Robertson could not get the support of the legislative assembly, and stepped aside for Charles Cowper to form a government.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
