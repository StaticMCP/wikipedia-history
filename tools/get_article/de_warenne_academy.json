Previously it had been Northcliffe School, a secondary modern school.\nThe school was the centre of controversy in the early 2000s due to a proposal to convert it into an academy run by the Emmanuel Schools Foundation, a Christian charity. The proposal was withdrawn in 2004 after legal threats by the National Secular Society.\nDoncaster Collegiate Sixth Form\nThe school was part of the Doncaster Collegiate Sixth Form which combined the sixth form offering from Ash Hill Academy, De Warenne Academy, Don Valley Academy, Rossington All Saints Academy and Serlby Park Academy however this was discontinued after several years.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.edubase.gov.uk/EstablishmentView.aspx?EstablishmentID=6777 EduBase]\nNews items\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/4966220.stm Teacher attacked September 2005 by former pupils]\n* [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1517390/Anger-as-teenager-who-scarred-teacher-for-life-is-given-six-months.html Injured teacher]\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/4527211.stm Pupil killed by air gun in May 2005]\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/3743824.stm Academy plan dropped in October 2004]\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3624198.stm Parents put school on eBay in September 2004]\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/3825461.stm Protest over Academy plan in June 2004]\n* [https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/south_yorkshire/3540609.stm Placed in special measures in 2003]"
