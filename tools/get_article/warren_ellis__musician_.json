He is a member of the rock groups Dirty Three and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. He performed with the band Grinderman until its disbandment in 2013, and has composed film scores with long-time friend, collaborator and band-mate Nick Cave. Ellis plays the violin, piano, accordion, bouzouki, guitar, flute, mandolin, mandocello and viola. He has been a member of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds since 1994.\nLife and career\nEllis was born in Ballarat, Victoria. He has said that he came to music by accident: while playing at the local tip, he found an abandoned piano accordion. He took it to school and his teacher showed him how to play it. He later learned classical violin and flute at school in Ballarat.\nAfter winning a scholarship to a private high school, Ellis went to university in Melbourne, where he studied classical violin. After that he then worked briefly as a schoolteacher in country Victoria. In January 1988 he travelled to Europe, where he busked in Greece, Hungary, Scotland and Ireland. A year later he returned to Australia. Ellis then wrote music for theatre groups and performed at art openings and plays in Melbourne, before he started playing in bands in the early nineties.\nIn 1992, Ellis formed The Dirty Three with guitarist Mick Turner and drummer Jim White. As of 2018 the band has recorded nine studio albums, including several to appear on the ARIA charts in their native Australia.\nIn 1993, Ellis was invited to play with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds as part of a small string ensemble for several songs on Let Love In (released 1994). He soon joined the band as a full-time member, initially emphasizing violin but gradually adding many other instruments. Ellis eventually co-wrote many of the band's songs and became a pivotal collaborator with singer Nick Cave in film scores and other projects. Ellis was also a member of Grinderman, a side-group from the Bad Seeds, who have released two albums.\nIn 2002, Ellis released a solo album on King Crab records called Three Pieces for Violin. Since 2005 he has played on several Marianne Faithfull albums. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis composed the award-winning score of the film The Proposition, and collaborated again on the scores of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, The Road, and Far from Men.\nIn 2009, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis released White Lunar – an album that includes other soundtrack scores.\nFollowing the release of Carnage, Ellis and Nick Cave toured Europe in the autumn of 2021 and the United States in the spring of 2022.\nEllis has lived in Paris since 1998 with his French wife and their two children.\nIn 2021, Ellis and his wife announced the purchase of a parcel of land in Sumatra, which they donated to the non-profit Jakarta Animal Aid Network. Ellis Park Wildlife Sanctuary is adjacent to the existing Sumatra Wildlife Centre, and specialises in animals who need lifetime care and cannot survive in the wild. Ellis Park, a documentary about Ellis and the Sanctuary, was directed by Justin Kurzel.\nWorks\nSolo albums\n* Three Pieces for Violin (2002)\nSolo scores\n* Mustang, film soundtrack (2015)\n*Bad Girl, film soundtrack (2017)\n* Django, film soundtrack (2017)\n* This Train I Ride, film soundtrack (2020)\n*Purple Perilla, book soundtrack (2021)\n* '' I'm Still Here, film soundtrack (2024)\nCollaborations with Nick Cave\n* Woyzeck, theatre score (2005), adaptation by Gísli Örn Gardarsson\n* The Proposition, soundtrack (2005)\n* The Metamorphosis, theatre score (2006)\n* The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, soundtrack (2007)\n* The English Surgeon, soundtrack (2007) with Nick Cave\n* The Road, soundtrack (2009)\n* The Girls of Phnom Penh, soundtrack (2009)\n* Lawless soundtrack (2012) composed with Nick Cave\n* Days of Grace, soundtrack (2012) With Nick Cave, Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne, Leopold Ross & Shigeru Umebayashi\n* West of Memphis, soundtrack (2013)\n* Loin des Hommes, soundtrack (2015)\n* Hell or High Water, soundtrack (2016) composed with Nick Cave\n* War Machine, soundtrack (2017) composed with Nick Cave\n* Wind River, soundtrack (2017) composed with Nick Cave\n* Kings, soundtrack (2017) composed with Nick Cave\n* Carnage, studio album (2021)\n* La Panthère Des Neiges, soundtrack (2021)\n* Blonde, soundtrack (2022) composed with Nick Cave\n* Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, soundtrack (2022) composed with Nick Cave\n* \"Wood Dove\", a track for the \"For the Birds: The Birdsong Project\", Vol. 2.\n* Back to Black'', soundtrack (2024) composed with Nick Cave\nOther collaborations\n* The Blackeyed Susans' album All Souls Alive (1993)\n* Kim Salmon's album Hey Believer (1994)\n* David McComb's album Love of Will (1994)\n* Played live music for Chicago neo-burlesque performer Maya Sinstress in 2000\n* Cat Power's album You Are Free (violin on \"Good Woman\") (2003)\n* Loene Carmen's album Slight Delay (2004)\n* \"Crazy Love\" by Marianne Faithfull/Nick Cave, with Isabelle Huppert on Before the Poison (2005)\n* \"Hell's Coming Down\" from Primal Scream's album Riot City Blues (2006)\n* Theo Hakola's album Drunk Women and Sexual Water (2008)\n* Jim Yamouridis' album Into the Day (2011)\n* The songs \"Woman, When I've Raised Hell\" and \"Honeymoon's Great!
