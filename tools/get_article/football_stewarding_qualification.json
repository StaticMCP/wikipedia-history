      "text": "# Football Stewarding Qualification\n\nThe Football Stewarding Qualification (or FSQ for short) is a qualification that all stewards at a designated football ground must gain while they are working. This is to ensure the safety of spectators who come to a football game and to avoid repeats of incidents like Hillsbourgh [https://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_2491000/2491195.stm] and the Bradford Fire [https://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/11/newsid_2523000/2523561.stm].\nCurrent issues\nAlthough the FSQ is still accepted as an acceptable qualification to steward at football grounds it has now been replaced by the NVQ Level 2 Spectator Control qualification which all new stewards starting training will work towards.\nReferences\n* [http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/ContactUs/Postings/2002/10/27083.htm The FA – Stewarding Guidelines]\n* [http://artificialfootballpitch.faidahbir.org Artificial Football Pitch Dimensions]\n\n---\n\n## Football stewarding qualification\n\n#REDIRECT Football Stewarding Qualification"
