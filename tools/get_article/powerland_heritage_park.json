It is located in Brooks, Oregon, United States (near Salem, Oregon), and is operated by the non-profit Antique Powerland Museum Association (APMA).

Originally, the site was primarily used for \"threshing bees\", a forerunner to the modern tractor pull, and the remainder of the site committed to farming.  With the addition of a truck museum and a railroad museum, the entire grounds were dedicated to exhibits; the current structure of Antique Powerland has been in operation since 1996.\nEach summer, Powerland Heritage Park presents the Great Oregon Steam-Up, wherein many of the exhibits are fired up and displayed in an operational state.
