The lake \"boils\" loudly with carbon dioxide bubbles bursting. The outflow of the stream is 2.5 million liters per 24 hours. The total surface area of the lake is 0.04 ha. The emission of gas in calm weather causes carbon dioxide to accumulate in lower levels. Small animals suffocate when they get near the lake, which is why there are dead animals there, such as mice, lizards, frogs and some birds.\nIt is part of Kazbegi Protected Areas along with Kazbegi National Park and five Natural Monuments:\n*Sakhizari Cliff,\n*Abano Mineral Lake,\n*Truso Travertine,\n*Jvari Pass Travertine,\n*Keterisi Mineral Vaucluse.\nSee also\n* List of natural monuments of Georgia\nReferences"
