His historical reference works were considered \"of inestimable value in Canadian studies.\" Canadian professor of political economy Harold Innis (1894–1952) was influenced by a maxim of the then McMaster University professor Wallace, \"that the economic interpretation of history is not the only interpretation but is the deepest interpretation.\"\n__TOC__\nProfessional contributions\nWallace was educated at Toronto and Oxford (Master of Arts) universities, and taught history (1906 – 1920) at the universities of Western Ontario, McMaster and Toronto.  In 1920 he became an assistant librarian, then in 1923, the librarian at the University of Toronto until his retirement in 1954 with title Chief Librarian.\nWallace wrote over thirty books and hundreds of articles.  These works were not without its critics.  Laura Secord is considered a heroine of the War of 1812, a war between the United States of America and Great Britain in Upper Canada (1812 – 1814).  Wallace's 1932 study downplayed the importance of her contributions in that war and resulted in great debate: of those contributions, the emerging professional historian, and subsequent interpretive gender bias by historians.In The Encyclopedia of the War of 1812 as reviewed by Stickney, discusses Wallace's error and its occasional resurfacing in literature.  Laura Secord's warning to the British resulted in an ambush of US military and their defeat at Beaver Dams on 24 June 1813. It was not until the 1960s that John Moir discovered two accounts from Lieutenant Fitzgibbon that proved Secord's claim of meeting prior to Fitzgibbon's Indian scouts being deployed and forewarning of the attack.  This information was not found by Wallace in 1932.  Source: Stickney (citation below).\nWallace was the founder and first editor (1920 – 1930) of the Canadian Historical Review, editor (1923 – 1943), president (1943 – 1948), and honorary president (1963 – 1970) of the Champlain Society, honorary editor (1937 – 1945) of the Royal Society of Canada, and a long-standing member of the Bibliographical Society of Canada. He received the Royal Society of Canada's J. B. Tyrrell Historical Medal in 1936.\nOne of Wallace's long-term interests was the history of the famous North West Company and its partners, whose careers he investigated in minute detail.  The \"Biographical Dictionary of the Nor'Westers\", published as part of his Documents Relating to the North West Company (1934), is full of evidence of the extensive correspondence he carried on with descendants of the partners, trying to locate new letters, journals and account books.  Although articles in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography have expanded knowledge of some of the Company's partners, Wallace's work remains a fundamental source.  One of his most important discoveries, near the end of his active career, was the correspondence of the Company's partner Æneas Cameron, then in the possession of descendants in Scotland and now at the Hudson's Bay Company Archives in Winnipeg.  This collection of manuscripts was a key source for Elaine A. Mitchell's Fort Temiskaming and the Fur Trade (1977, University of Toronto Press).\nWritings\nWallace was the author or editor of many noted printed materials, including:\n* Review of historical publications relating to Canada (1908, Volume 12)\n* The United Empire Loyalists: A chronicle of the Great Migration (1914)\n* The Family Compact: A chronicle of the Rebellion in Upper Canada (1915), Glasgow, Brook, Toronto, 172 pages, relating to the small group of men exercising political, economic and judicial power in pre-confederation Ontario\n* ''The Patriotes of '37: a chronicle of the Lower Canadian rebellion (1916), original written by Alfred D.

The 1944 edition of 186 pages was authorised by the Minister of Education for Ontario It was noted in Wright (2005, p.91) that Wallace had a 'lucrative relationship' with the Ontario Department of Education and it was suggested 'he was prepared to walk away from the truth as he understood it to preserve' that relationship.  As such, he submitted two books reviewed and subsequently approved for use in Ontario schools.
