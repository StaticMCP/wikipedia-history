Events in Portugal and France are specified.\nOverview\nThe Peninsular War was a military conflict for control of the Iberian Peninsula during the Napoleonic Wars, waged between France and the allied powers of Spain, the United Kingdom and Portugal. It started when French and Spanish armies, then allied, occupied Portugal in 1807, and escalated in 1808 when France turned on Spain, its former ally. The war on the peninsula lasted until the Sixth Coalition defeated Napoleon in 1814, and is regarded as one of the first wars of national liberation, and significant for the emergence of large-scale guerrilla warfare. British and Portuguese forces eventually secured Portugal, using it as a safe position from which to launch campaigns against the French army, while both Spanish and Portuguese guerrillas weakened the occupying forces.\nThe Peninsular War overlaps with what the Spanish-speaking world calls the Guerra de la Independencia Española (Spanish War of Independence), which began with the Dos de Mayo Uprising on 2 May 1808 and ended on 17 April 1814. Although Spain had been in upheaval since at least the Mutiny of Aranjuez (March 1808), May 1808 marks the start of the Spanish War of Independence. The French occupation destroyed the Spanish administration, which fragmented into quarrelling provincial juntas. In 1810, a reconstituted national government, the Cortes of Cádizeffectively a government-in-exilefortified itself in Cádiz but could not raise effective armies because it was besieged by up to 70,000 French troops. Cádiz would go on to hold the distinction of being the only city in continental Europe to survive a siege by Napoleon: thirty-one months—from 5 February 1810 to 25 August 1812. The combined efforts of regular and irregular forces throughout the peninsula prevented Napoleon's marshals from subduing the rebellious Spanish provinces, and the war continued through years of stalemate.\nWhile the initial stages of the Peninsular War were fought on Portuguese soil, most of the war was fought on Spanish soil and, as the French army was pushed further back across the Pyrenees, the final stages of the war were fought on French soil.\nList of events\n1807\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:left; line-height:150%;\"\n|-\n!

After having declared himself the only representative of King Ferdinand and was about to issue orders for dismissing the captain-general, Conde de Cervellon, and dissolving the Junta, Calvo was arrested, tried as a traitor and executed. Some two hundred of his followers were also executed and their bodies exposed in public.\n|-\n| 6 June 1808\n| data-sort-value=\"Valdepeñas\" | Uprising of Valdepeñas\n| Ciudad Real, Castile-La Mancha\n| Uprising: Spanish victory\n| Following the previous day's uprising in Santa Cruz de Mudela, Liger-Bélair and Roize, at the head of some 800 troops, together with some 300 soldiers that had escaped from the Santa Cruz uprising the previous day, prepare to march through the town of Valdepeñas. The population attack the leading column and Liger-Bélair sends in the dragoons, who are also forced to retreat. The resulting truce stipulates that, in return for a day's worth of food supplies, the French troops will not pass through the village. These actions at Santa Cruz (see 5 June 1808, above) and Valdepeñas, together with more isolated actions in the Sierra Morena, effectively cut French military communications between Madrid and Andalusia for around a month.\n|-\n| 6 June 1808\n| Porto (Uprising of)\n| Porto (Portugal)\n| Uprising: Portuguese victory\n| On hearing of the rebellion in Spain, Spanish general Belesta, having participated in the Invasion of Portugal, and stationed at Porto with 6,000 Spanish troops, captures the French general Quesnel, and marches to Coruña to join the fight against the French troops, sparking off a series of uprisings throughout the north of Portugal.\n|-\n| 6 June 1808\n| Coronation of Joseph I\n| Madrid\n|\n| Napoleon's elder brother, Joseph Bonaparte, proclaimed King of Spain.

Often grouped together as one battle, there were in fact two separate battles, or skirmishes, separated by more than a week, with different armies and commanders involved: of the 12 French regiments that participated, only one of them fought at both battles. Although Schwarz's 3,800 troops had successfully fought off the initial ambush by a smaller Spanish army numbering some 900 men, they did not pursue their advantage and were routed when reinforcements of miquelets and somatenes arrived. The battle saw troops of the Swiss Wimpffen Regiment fighting on both sides, since a detachment had recently deserted the French army to join the Spanish troops.\n|-\n| 7 June 1808\n| data-sort-value=\"Alcolea Bridge\" | Battle of Alcolea Bridge\n| Córdoba, Andalusia\n| French victory\n| At Alcolea, 10&nbsp;km from Córdoba, Dupont's troops engaged in their first battle in Andalusia against 3,000 regular troops under Pedro Agustín de Echávarri who tried to protect the bridge over the Guadalquivir. The same day, Dupont captured Córdoba.\n|-\n| 7 June 1808\n| Córdoba\n| Córdoba, Andalusia\n| French victory/sack\n| On their way to Seville, and ultimately to Cádiz, Dupont's 18,000 troops capture Córdoba, ransacking the city over four days. However, damaging guerrilla actions force Dupont to withdraw towards Madrid to meet up with Gobert's division, that had set out from Madrid on 2 July to reinforce Dupont. Only one brigade of this division ultimately reached Dupont, the rest being needed to hold the road north (to Madrid) against the guerrillas.\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"9 June 1808\" | 9–10&nbsp;June&nbsp;1808\n| Sack of L'Arboç\n| L'Arboç, Tarragona, Catalonia\n| Manoeuvres (French)/sack\n| On retreating back from Tarragona towards Barcelona, General Chabran's vanguard was attacked and chased away by some 1,200 sometents from El Vendrell and 200 Swiss regulars. When Chabran's emissary returned to negotiate, the villagers met them with gunfire and the French troops retaliated, sacking the village.\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"9 June 1808\" | 9–14&nbsp;June&nbsp;1808\n| data-sort-value=\"Rosily Squadron\" | Capture of the Rosily Squadron\n| Cádiz, Andalusia\n| Spanish victory\n|\n|-\n| 11 June 1808\n| Arrest of Spanish troops in Portugal\n| Lisbon, Portugal\n| Manoeuvres (French)\n| Following General Belesta's escape from Porto (See 6 June 1808, above), Junot arrested General Carrafa and rounded up most of his 7,000 troops, the only Spanish troops now left in Portugal, were disarmed and kept prisoners on pontoons moored under the guns of the Lisbon forts, until the English released them after the battle of Vimiero, ten weeks later, under the terms of the Convention of Cintra.\n|-\n| 12 June 1808\n| data-sort-value=\"Cabezón\" | Battle of Cabezón\n| Valladolid, Castile and León\n| French victory\n|\n|-\n| 14 June 1808\n| data-sort-value=\"Bruch 2\" | Second battle of Bruch\n| El Bruc, Barcelona, Catalonia\n| Spanish victory\n| See also First battle of Bruch (6 June 1808), above. Following Schwarz's defeat at the First battle of Bruc (see 6 June, above), Duhesme sent Chabran on a punitive operation. Some 1,800 men, with four cannon, under Colonel Juan Baget fought against Chabran's 1st Division, comprising some 5,600 troops.Although they were only really skirmishes, the two actions at Bruc mark the first victories over Napoleon's army in Spain and, as such, were put to good use as Fernandine propaganda.\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"15 June 1808\" | 15&nbsp;June&nbsp;1808&nbsp;– 14&nbsp;August&nbsp;1808\n| data-sort-value=\"Zaragoza 1\" | First Siege of Zaragoza\n| Zaragoza, Aragón\n| Spanish victory\n|\n|-\n| 16 June 1808\n| data-sort-value=\"Olhão\" | Uprising of Olhão\n| Olhão (Portugal)\n| Uprising: Portuguese victory\n| Portuguese civilians revolted and expelled the French forces from Olhão.

With the reinforcements from Vedel and Gobert, Dupont now had 20,000 men, albeit short of supplies.\n|-\n| 27 June 1808\n| Gijón: Arrival of British officers\n| Asturias\n| Delegation\n| In response to the Junta General of Asturias' request to London, the Portland administration sent three British Army officers, led by a lieutenant colonel, to Gijón to assess the state of affairs. Following the Spanish victory at Bailén the following month, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Viscount Castlereagh sent a second delegation, led by General Sir James Leith, who arrived in Gijón on 30 August 1808 charged with seeing how the north of Spain could be reinforced to prevent Napoleon sending in more troops through Irun, and isolating him in Madrid or Burgos. Leith would join Baird's forces in November 1808.\n|-\n| 30 June 1808\n|\n| Balearic Islands to mainland Spain\n| Manoeuvres (Spanish)\n| The corps of 10,000 men stationed in the Balearic Islands was the nearest force able to succour Catalonia. Faced with the open mutiny of the Aragonese and Catalan battalions of his army, the Captain-General at Palma, General Vives, in charge of the garrisons of Majorca and Minorca finally agreed to send troops from Port Mahon to the mainland. The Aragonese regiment landed near Tortosa, and marched for Saragossa, while the bulk of the expeditionary force, nearly 5,000 strong, was put ashore in Catalonia between 19 and 23 July.\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"2 July 1808\" | 2–3&nbsp;July&nbsp;1808\n| Sack of Jaen\n| Jaen, Jaén, Andalusia\n| Manoeuvres (French)\n| Dupont ordered Vedel, based at Baylen, to send a brigade, which sacked the city.\n|-\n| 4 July 1808\n| Sack of Guarda\n| Guarda, District of Guarda, Portugal\n| Manoeuvres (French)\n| Loison left a garrison of 1,200 men at Almeida, having formed a provisional battalion of soldiers not deemed fit for forced marching, and spent a week moving through the mountains of Beira, skirmishing with insurgents along the way and sacking the town of Guarda. By the time he reached Abrantes he had lost 200 men, mostly stragglers killed by peasantry. His cruelty led to his nickname, \"Maneta\" (‘One-Hand’), being accursed for many years in Portugal.\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"13 July 1808\" | 13&nbsp;July&nbsp;1808&nbsp;– 1&nbsp;August&nbsp;1808\n| Expeditionary force (British)\n| Cork, Ireland – Mondego Bay, Coimbra District, Portugal\n| Manoeuvres (British)\n| Wellington's expeditionary force, comprising thirteen battalions of infantry plus cavalry and artillery, 9,000 men in all, sailed from Cork, landing in Portugal on 1 August.\n|-\n| 14&nbsp;July&nbsp;1808\n| data-sort-value=\"Medina de Rioseco\" | Battle of Medina de Rioseco\n| Valladolid, Castile and León\n| French victory\n| Also known as the Battle of Moclín, from the name of a nearby hill held by Spanish infantry.

When attacked there by Lefebvre-Desnouettes's cavalry, the Spanish column retreated to Tudela, where Marshal Moncey met them with an infantry division. Again, Montijo retreated. Thinking that these skirmishes must be mere diversions, and under the impression that the attack would be coming from that side, King Joseph moved his reserves up the river to Miranda. Montijo, however, had given way simply because his troops were raw levies, and because his nearest support was Saragossa.

The public outcry in Britain led to an inquiry, held 14 November to 27 December 1808, which cleared all three British officers.

Silveira, concerned, immediately prepared to defend the frontier. However, Seras unexpectedly turned back to Zamora, leaving a battalion of the 2nd Swiss Regiment and a squadron of horse to garrison the place. Silveira and Taboada immediately united their forces, and routed the French from the castle, forcing it into the town on 4 August, where it was forced to surrender a week later, with some 20 officers and 350 men, of an original 600, taken prisoner. Seras returned too late to succour his garrison, and retired to Benavente, whereupon Taboada reoccupied the place. Seras then had to head up to the north where Bonet was being bothered by Porlier's actions, with Bonet asking him to attack Porlier's force in the rear.\n|-\n| 11 August 1810\n| Combat of Villagarcia\n| Villagarcía de la Torre, Extremadura\n| French victory\n|\n|-\n| 15 August 1810\n| Action at Linares de Cornellana\n| Cornellana, Asturias\n| Spanish victory\n| After having been forced to retreat to Mieres (see 26 April 1810, above), Bárcena was able to reorganise his troops and was victorious at the action of Linares de Cornellana and, later that month, at Campomanes (see 24 August 1810, below).\n|-\n| 24 August 1810\n| Action at Campomanes\n| Campomanes, Asturias\n| Spanish victory\n| After having been forced to retreat to Mieres (see 26 April 1810, above), Bárcena was able to reorganise his troops and was victorious at the action of Linares de Cornellana (see 15 April 1810, above) and, later that month, at Campomanes.\n|-\n| 10 September 1810\n| Combat at Begur\n| Begur, Girona, Catalonia\n| English victory\n| An English landing-party stormed the coastal battery, capturing the garrison of 50 men.\n|-\n| 14 September 1810\n| data-sort-value=\"La Bisbal\" | Battle of La Bisbal\n| Girona, Catalonia\n| Anglo-Spanish victory\n|\n|-\n| 14 September 1810\n| Actions at Palamos, San Feliu & Calonje\n| Palamós, Sant Feliu & Calonge, Girona, Catalonia\n| Anglo-Spanish victory\n| On the same day that O'Donnell was taking La Bisbal (see above), General Doyle (the British commissioner in Catalonia) and Captain Fane, having sailed from Tarragona on the British frigate Cambrian (Fane's ship) accompanying the Spanish frigate Diana, and a few transports, led a landing-force, numbering some 500 troops, to storm Palamós while the Spanish troops under Colonel Fleires took Sant Feliu, and Colonel Aldea cut off the French troops at Calonge.

After an initial landing at Gijón, from which they drove the French garrison and captured large amounts of supplies, the expedition then headed for Santoña, where a gale forced the expedition to turn back.

Hill sent two squadrons each of the 13th Light Dragoons and 2nd Hussars of the King's German Legion (KLG) in pursuit. The French captain formed his men in a square, and beat off five cavalry charges, with heavy loss to Hill's men: the KGL Hussars had two men killed and one officer and 17 men wounded, while the 13th Light Dragoons had one killed and 19 wounded. Dembowski, once warned of the approaching allied forces, evacuated Merida, where Hill, arriving the following day, found the French had abandoned 160,000&nbsp;lb. of wheat.

Lafosse managed to reach Tarragona, with only twenty-two of his dragoons, but his battalion, after resisting for several hours in the village, was forced to surrender. Eroles took nearly 600 prisoners, and left over 200 French troops dead. Commodore Edward Codrington, then commanding a squadron in the Mediterranean Sea charged with harrying French shipping, was present at the combat, having come on shore to confer with Eroles, with whom he often collaborated, regarding an action against Tarragona.

However, following Blake's surrender at Valencia, earlier that month, Mahy withdrew his garrison, neglecting to remove its magazines. On entering Dénia, Harispe found sixty guns mounted on its walls, plus forty small merchant vessels in the harbour, some of them laden with stores. As well as garrisoning the place, the French fitted out some of the vessels as privateers.

Suchet ordered Severoli, with two Italian and two French battalions, to besiege the place and on the 31st work began to erect five batteries.On February 2, Garcia Navarro capitulated under unusually favourable terms.In the letter he sent to Suchet along with the capitulation, he stated, \"To-day I see that to render Spain less unhappy it is necessary for us all to unite under the King Joseph, and I make my offer to serve him with the same enthusiasm.
