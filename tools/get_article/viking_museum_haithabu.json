While the region is now in modern Germany, it was once the oldest city in Denmark until it was ceded in 1864. The museum, located in the Busdorf municipality, features reconstructions of various Viking Age dwellings and ships and houses numerous artifacts discovered during the ongoing archaeological research of the area.\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://haithabu.de/en/homepage Official website]"
