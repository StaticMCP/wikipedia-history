The beaches of Asan were one of the landing sites of American forces in the 1944 Battle of Guam, in which the island was retaken from occupying Japanese forces.  The designated historic site includes the beaches extending between Asan Point and Adelup Point and extends inland roughly to Guam Highway 1.  It also includes the water area extending from the beach to the reef, about  out, an area that includes at least one abandoned Allied landing vehicle.\nThe beaches, fortifications, and water out to the reef were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  Portions of them are part of the Asan Beach Unit of the War in the Pacific National Historical Park, which includes a public access point at Asan Point.  Just east of this is Memorial Beach Park, a municipal beachfront park that was listed on the National Register in 1974.\nConservation\nIn 2024, the National Park Service began a project in the Asan Beach Unit to create a refuge for Guam's imperiled native birds, by recruiting volunteers to remove invasive brown tree snakes from the park. The site is an ideal area for snake exclusion since it is surrounded by ocean and highway.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Guam\nReferences"
