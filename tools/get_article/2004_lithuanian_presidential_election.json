The Constitutional Court of Lithuania ruled that Paksas could not seek re-election as president. In accordance with the constitution, the speaker of parliament, Artūras Paulauskas, became acting president pending new elections.\nCandidates\nThe candidates for the presidency were Adamkus, who had been President from 1998 to 2003 and who was running as an independent, Prunskienė of the Peasants and New Democratic Party Union (VNDS), Vilija Blinkevičiūtė of the New Union (Social Liberals) (NS), Petras Auštrevičius (independent), and Česlovas Juršėnas of the Social Democratic Party (LSDP).\nPrunskienė was also supported by the Liberal Democratic Party, while Auštrevičius was supported by the Homeland Union, Lithuanian Christian Democrats, Liberal and Centre Union and Labour Party.\nResults\nIn the first round on 13 June former president Valdas Adamkus led the vote tally over the former Prime Minister Kazimira Prunskienė. Adamkus defeated Prunskienė in the second round on 27 June.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.vrk.lt/statiniai/puslapiai/rinkimai/2004/prezidentas/indexn.html 2004 Lithuanian presidential elections] VRK"
