The third was formed by an associate of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP).\nPro-Democracy: Libertas.eu\n\"\n| foundation = 10 March 2009\n| ideology = anti-Lisbon Treaty, Euroscepticism\n| headquarters = 52 Grosvenor Gardens, London, SW1 0AU\n| colours = blue, gold\n| european = Libertas Party Limited\n| europarl = none\n| website = [http://www.libertas.eu/uk/ www.libertas.eu/uk/]\n|}}\nPro-Democracy: Libertas.eu is the name of the Libertas Party Limited affiliate in Great Britain.\nOn 10 March 2009, it was reported that Libertas intended to field candidates in the UK. Kevin O’Connell, a former deputy director of Europol, former commander in the London Metropolitan Police, and former employee of Libertas stated in The Sunday Times that \"if Libertas would have me as a candidate, I would run”. O’Connell was the first person to indicate a willingness to run for Libertas in Britain. Nigel Farage, leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), criticised Libertas's intention to run in the UK, stating: \"I'm a little surprised that Libertas want to stand in the UK as their policy seems almost the same as David Cameron's Conservatives'.\" Ganley dismissed UKIP's position as \"reactionary\". Former newspaper editor Bridget Rowe, Nigel Farage's press secretary, then registered Libertas UK with the United Kingdom Electoral Commission, making it unclear whether Ganley's Libertas could field candidates in the UK under that name. On 11 February 2009, Libertas announced the opening of its United Kingdom office at Suite 6.8, 52 Grosvenor Gardens, London, United Kingdom, SW1. Ganley gave a press conference on 10 March 2009, at which the party was launched and he introduced Robin Matthews as its leader.\nThe party originally registered under the name New Dawn for Europe: Libertas.eu, before changing its name to Pro-Democracy: Libertas.eu in April 2009. It is under this name that the party fielded candidates in the June 2009 European Parliamentary elections.\nPersonnel\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Person\n!Position\n|-\n|Robin Matthews\n|Leader\n|-\n|Andrew Jamieson\n|Nominating Officer\n|-\n|Nicholas Coke\n|Treasurer\n| foundation = 11 March 2009\n| ideology = anti-Lisbon Treaty, Euroscepticism\n| headquarters = 52 Grosvenor Gardens, London, SW1 0AU\n| colours = blue, gold\n| european = Libertas Party Limited\n| europarl = none\n| website = [http://www.libertas.eu/uk/ www.libertas.eu/uk/]\n|}}\nLibertas NI (abbr. unknown: LNI?) is the name of the Libertas Party Limited affiliate in Northern Ireland.
