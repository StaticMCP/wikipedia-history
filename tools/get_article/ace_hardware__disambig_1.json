It is the largest non-grocery retail cooperative in the United States.\nFounded on October 25, 1924, as \"Ace Stores\", the company changed its name to \"Ace Hardware Corporation\" in 1931. It grew dramatically following World War II, more than tripling its sales between the late 1940s and 1959. After the retirement of longtime president and founder Richard Hesse in 1973, Ace was sold to its retailers, becoming a retailer-owned cooperative. It first reached $1&nbsp;billion in wholesale sales in 1985 and $5&nbsp;billion in 2015. , it has over 5,200 locations in 60 countries. Ace operates 17 distribution centers in the United States, and additional distribution facilities in China, Panama, and the United Arab Emirates.\nHistory\nIn 1924, to increase buying power and profits, entrepreneurs Richard Hesse, E. Gunnard Lindquist, Frank Burke, and Oscar Fisher united their Chicago, Illinois, hardware stores into \"Ace Stores\". The company was named after the ace fighter pilots of World War I, who overcame all odds. Ace Stores was incorporated on March 2, 1928, and the company opened its first warehouse a year later. In 1931, the name was changed to Ace Hardware Corporation.\nBy 1933, Ace had thirty-eight  retailers in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. In 1946, Ace introduced its Super Ace Store concept. By the end of the 1940s, Ace had wholesale sales of more than $7&nbsp;million from the one hundred thirty-three stores it supplied. In 1954, the stores agreed to change their names from Ace Stores to Ace Hardware. By its 35th anniversary in 1959, the company had more than tripled this figure, with wholesale sales of $24.5&nbsp;million from 325 stores.\nIn 1961, Ace relocated its warehouse and corporate offices to Bedford Park, Illinois. By the end of the decade, the company built warehouses in Northern California and Georgia to support its expansion into the Western and Southeastern states.\nFounder and longtime president Richard Hesse retired in 1973. Ace relocated its corporate offices to Oak Brook, Illinois, the following year and opened a distribution center in Addison. The company was thereafter sold to its retailers and restructured as a cooperative. Independent retailers became the exclusive shareholders in the company and the corporate entity remained as a wholesaler and distributor. The strategy proved successful, and Ace surpassed $1&nbsp;billion in wholesale sales for the first time in 1985; it went on to pass $5&nbsp;billion in 2015.\nUnder CEO Roger Peterson (1986–1995), Ace sales more than doubled from $801M in 1983 to more than $2B in 1993. Needing more space to support its operations in the Midwest, Ace opened a 1.1 million–square-foot distribution center in Princeton, Illinois, in February to serve more than four hundred fifty stores. In October 1994, Ace launched a strategic plan known as \"The New Age of Ace\" with the objective, by 2000, to achieve improved retail performance, more efficient operations, international growth, and a faster pace for new store openings. The company reported a fifteen-percent jump in sales from 1993 to 1994.\nIn 1996, Ace surpassed Cotter & Company to become the largest hardware co-op. Ace overhauled its computer systems in 1999 to accommodate the introduction of the thirteen-digit barcode. In 2001, it passed TruServe to become the largest American hardware wholesaler. By 2002, the company had 5,100 stores. Ace surpassed $3 billion in annual hardline sales and $100 million in net profits in 2003.\nIn September 2011, Ace Hardware began selling a new line of premium paints, called Clark+Kensington. In 2012, the company opened a 336,000–square-foot redistribution center in Suffolk, Virginia. Ace was the first tenant at the CenterPoint Intermodal Center. It acquired its largest member, Westlake Ace Hardware, for $88&nbsp;million in December 2012. In January 2013, Ace announced a long-term deal under which Valspar agreed to acquire Ace's paint-manufacturing assets, including two facilities near Chicago, and produce the company's paints. The following year, Ace's president and CEO John Venhuizen launched 20/20 Vision, a strategy to use network power to provide better customer service.\nIn 2014, the company opened a 450,000–square-foot distribution center in Wilmer, Texas, and a 534,000–square-foot retail support center in West Jefferson, Ohio. Both facilities were expanded in 2019. Ace launched its wholesale distribution network through the acquisition of the Portland, Maine–based Emery-Waterhouse in 2014 and the Spokane, Washington–based Jensen Distribution Services in 2015. Later that year, Ace expanded its wholesale operations coast to coast with the formation of Emery Jensen Distribution, LLC. This new distribution arm operates under Ace Wholesale Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Ace Hardware Corporation, and is dedicated to serving non–Ace Hardware independent retailers.\nIn 2016, J. D. Power ranked Ace Hardware \"Highest in Customer Satisfaction with Home Improvement Retail Stores\" for the tenth consecutive year. In 2017, Ace announced a restructuring of its East Coast retail support network that closed facilities in Baltimore, Maine, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Distribution operations were absorbed by a new retail support center in Fredericksburg, Pennsylvania, and the expansion of one in Wilton, New York. The company also expanded its facility in Suffolk, Virginia.\nIn July 2017, a 10,000–square foot customer care center was opened at Page Field in Fort Myers, Florida. In October, Ace acquired e-commerce marketplace The Grommet. However, the website was shut down in June 2022 and later sold to startup GiddyUp.\nIn May 2019, Ace acquired full ownership of ACO Inc., the company that operates fifty Great Lakes Ace Hardware stores in Ohio and Michigan.\nIn August 2022, grocery chain Food City opened its own Ace Hardware location in Piney Flats, Tennessee. In March 2023, Ace opened a 1.1 million–square-foot logistics center in Visalia, California.

From 1987 to 2009, former NFL coach and NFL commentator John Madden also starred in Ace commercials.\nIn 1999, the American Society of Magazine Editors stripped This Old House magazine of an award nomination after it was deemed an Ace Hardware-branded insert was an inappropriate form of advertising. In 2002, home improvement expert Lou Manfredini was hired to serve as Ace's \"Helpful Hardware Man\" and media spokesman.\nIn 2016, Ace introduced a new series of commercials featuring associates addressing customers' needs, and a contextually-appropriate version of the Ace jingle (such as, after a customer asks for a lubricant they think is called 10W40, \"Ace is the place for the stuff for squeaking hinges that's called WD-40.
