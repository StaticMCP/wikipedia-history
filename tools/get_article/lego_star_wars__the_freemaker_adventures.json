Disney XD announced that it had renewed the series for a second season on April 3, 2017. A new series of five shorts debuted on May 4, with the second season premiering airing on June 17, 2017; the series' final episode aired on August 16, 2017. A follow-up series, Lego Star Wars: All-Stars, aired in 2018.\nOverview\nSet between Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi, The Freemaker Adventures centers on a family of three siblings — Rowan, Kordi, and Zander Freemaker — and their ex-battle droid companion R0-GR, who salvage parts from destroyed or damaged ships in order to build new ones, which they sell from their workshop aboard a space station known as the Wheel.\nDuring the first season, the Freemakers inadvertently become caught in the conflict between Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance when Rowan discovers his connection to the Force and part of an ancient artifact known as the Kyber Saber. Aided by a Force-wielder named Naare, the Freemakers embark on a journey to uncover the mystery of the Kyber Saber, which leads them to meet new and old Lego faces from the Star Wars universe.\nIn the second season, the Freemakers join the Rebel Alliance and attempt to build the Arrowhead, a kyber crystal-powered ship which Rowan saw in a vision and is supposedly the key to defeating the Empire. During this time, they are pursued by MO-C, a droid built by the Emperor for the sole purpose of capturing Rowan, and Darth Vader, who is also looking for kyber crystals to power the Empire's new battle station: the Death Star II.\nCast and characters\nMain\n* Nicolas Cantu as Rowan Freemaker, the young 12-year-old Force-sensitive member of the family who often has trouble with paying attention to his older siblings and other authority figures. Once trained in the use of the Force, he begins to use it constructively, thus becoming a successor of an ancient group of Jedi known as Force-Builders. His special sensitivity to kyber crystals make him a target for several nefarious adversaries throughout the series, including Emperor Palpatine and Graballa the Hutt.\n* Vanessa Lengies as Kordi Freemaker, the responsible, money-conscious middle sibling of the family who is fiercely protective of her younger brother Rowan and disapproves of his involvement in the quest for the Kyber Saber.\n* Eugene Byrd as Zander Freemaker, the eldest son of the family and a mechanic who specializes in creating new ships and devices from leftover components. He hates his creations being called \"Uglies\", preferring the term \"Z-Wings\", and has a weakness for pretty ladies, including Naare (until learning that she is working for the Empire), Rebel pilot Lt. Valeria, and Becky Smoochenbacher (voiced by Dove Cameron), a resident of the Wheel.\n* Matthew Wood as R0-GR (pronounced Roger), a battle droid and veteran of the Clone Wars who was salvaged by the Freemakers and reprogrammed to be their servant and friend.\nRecurring\nThe Empire\n* Grey Griffin as Naare, a dark side user and self-proclaimed Sith in the service of Emperor Palpatine who is masquerading as a Jedi survivor of Order 66 to fool and use the Freemakers in her mission to find the Kyber Saber crystals. She has a set of facial markings that change shape and color along with her eyes when she becomes angry or taps into the dark side.\n* Matt Sloan as Darth Vader, a Sith Lord, Emperor Palpatine's apprentice and chief enforcer, and the most feared man in the galaxy.\n* Trevor Devall as Emperor Palpatine, the ruler of the Empire and Darth Vader's Sith master.\n* Richard Kind as Durpin, a cowardly Imperial officer who is introduced as a lieutenant commander but soon promoted to general by the Emperor. Durpin is fully aware of the perils of high rank in the Empire and seeks to avoid it at all cost. After each failure to capture the Freemakers, he is relocated to another Empire-controlled planet which happens to be visited by the Freemakers in short order, causing him yet another humiliating defeat.\n* Jeff Bennett as Plumestriker, Durpin's second-in-command who lacks his superior's healthy fear of the perils of being in a command position in the Empire and is eager for Durpin to climb the Imperial ladder. In the second season he becomes more independent-minded and more willing to capture the Freemakers than Durpin in order to finally escape his continual penalty assignments.\n* Jane Leeves as Lieutenant Estoc, an Imperial officer assigned to the Wheel who participates in the hunt for Luke and Leia when they arrive at the station looking for repairs.\nHutts\n* Dana Snyder as Graballa the Hutt, a Hutt crime lord and Jabba's envious cousin who is constantly kept from pursuing his own ambitions by Jabba's greater influence and who seeks the kyber crystals as a means of gaining power. He is 462 years old, and has spent 200 of them running a mining operation in an asteroid field, nursing his dreams of running a beach resort. He eventually joins forces with Naare so that the pair can recover the crystals together until she betrays Graballa. In the second season, he is drafted by Darth Vader to locate more kyber crystals to complete the second Death Star.\n* Kevin Michael Richardson as Jabba the Hutt, the biggest Hutt crime lord in the galaxy and Graballa's cousin who is often annoyed by his antics. Unlike Graballa, who speaks in Galactic Basic (English), Jabba speaks in Huttese.\nBounty Hunters\n* James Patrick Stuart as Dengar, a bounty hunter in Graballa's employ who is best known for not being as feared as Boba Fett. In this series, his trademark head wrappings occasionally serve him as an improvised utility tool (parachute, rappelling rope, etc.).\n* John DiMaggio and Danny Jacobs as Baash and Raam, a pair of idiotic Iktotchi in the employ of Graballa the Hutt who are constant thorns in his and Dengar's side due to their incompetence.\n* Dee Bradley Baker as Boba Fett, a notorious bounty hunter wearing Mandalorian armor in the employ of Jabba the Hutt who is old friends with Dengar. Baker also provides various additional voices such as Ben Quadinaros.\nRebel Alliance\n* Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the former Administrator of Cloud City turned general in the Rebel Alliance. He works with Chewbacca in the absence of Han Solo.\n* Eric Bauza as Luke Skywalker, an X-wing pilot in the Rebel Alliance and Jedi-in-training.

(season 2)\nForce-users\n* Brian Dobson as Jek-14, also known as the Maker of Zoh, a former Sith experiment who now tries to avoid any form of conflict and uses the Force to build. Jek first appeared in Lego Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles and its sequel series Lego Star Wars: The New Yoda Chronicles, and in The Freemaker Adventures is seen in his elderly appearance from the latter.\n* Trevor Devall as Baird Kantoo, a Jedi Knight who created the Kyber Saber. After discovering how destructive the Kyber Saber is, he smashed it and gave each piece to trusted Jedi Knights to hide them in different areas around the galaxy to keep it out of evil's hand.\nDroids\n* French Stewart as N3-R0, a droid who hates humans due to their mistreatment of droids.\n* Fred Tatasciore as BL-OX, a large droid loyal to Jek but influenced by N3-R0.\n* James Urbaniak as M-OC, an Imperial hunting droid, who is assigned by Palpatine to hunt down Rowan Freemaker. He sports a versatile arsenal wielded by hand or installed into his body, including a pair of red lightsabers. M-OC and Darth Vader quickly become bitter rivals for the Emperor's favor as they repeatedly let the Freemakers slip through their grasp. (season 2)\nCivilians\n* Thomas Lennon as Wick Cooper, a wealthy resident of the Wheel space station who occasionally comes to the Freemakers to have them work on his vehicles. Very full of himself and proud of his station, he is quite willing to bully the Freemakers (particularly Zander) and others whom he regards as beneath him. He is also an insensitive individual, once making a joke at the expense of the destroyed planet Alderaan in the presence of Princess Leia. He is also the Emperor's self-proclaimed biggest fan. After the Freemakers are forced to leave their shop, he turns it into an expensive but lucrative café.\n* Jeff Bennett as Ignacio Wortan, a Twi'lek businessman.\n* Greg Baldwin as Furlac, the Freemakers' merciless Aqualish landlord aboard the Wheel space station. He is constantly threatening to throw the Freemakers out if they don't pay rent on their shop in time, but notably is susceptible to Force persuasion as employed by Naare. In the second season, he becomes an ally to Graballa.\n* Danny Jacobs as Yeppau, a Toydarian who acts as Graballa's yes-man. A running gag in the show involves him frequently, though not exclusively, responding to Graballa's inquiries with \"Yep\".\n* Jim Cummings as Hondo Ohnaka, a notorious Weequay pirate who led the Ohnaka Gang during the Clone Wars.\n* Grey Griffin as Maz Kanata, an ex-pirate and -smuggler and current bar owner on Takodana.\nEpisodes\nSeries overview\n| end1       =\n| color2     = #00CED1\n| link2      = #Season 2 (2017)\n| episodes2  = 13\n| start2     =\n| end2       =\n}}\nSeason 1 (2016)\n|prodcode=\n|prodcodeR=\n|viewers=\n|country=U.S.\n|episodes=\n| ProdCode        = 101\n| Viewers         = 0.51\n| ShortSummary    = During a briefing on the creation of the second Death Star seen in Return of the Jedi, Darth Vader explains to an unimpressed Emperor that they have come across information in the Jedi Archives regarding the mysterious Kyber Saber. Elsewhere, the Freemaker family of ship salvagers are gathering parts in the middle of a space battle, until youngest boy Rowan inadvertently destroys an Imperial transport. Returning to their home, the space station \"The Wheel\", the three find themselves in urgent need of funds to pay off their landlord Furlac, and head to a planet on which a Clone Wars battle took place in order to find a needed part to repair one of Zander's \"Z-Wings\" and sell it. Despite being told to stay on the Star Scavenger with Roger the salvaged battle droid, Rowan leaves the ship to warn his siblings Zander and Kordi of stormtrooper activity in the area only to experience a strange call that leads him to the hilt of the Kyber Saber. He is then greeted by Naare, who explains that the Kyber Saber is the first lightsaber, which was broken and scattered in order to keep its vast powers out of evil hands. The pair then work together to rescue Kordi and Zander from the Imperials, and Naare accompanies the Freemakers back to The Wheel where she uses the Force to get Furlac off their back for the time being while also renting a shop on the station for her own use. Unbeknownst to the Freemakers, however, their new \"ally\" is a Sith in the employ of the Emperor, who seeks to exploit Rowan's newfound connection to the Force only so that she can recover the fragments of the Kyber Saber for her master.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 102\n| Viewers         = 0.26\n| ShortSummary    = Kordi frowns on Naare's efforts to train Rowan, who doesn't want her younger brother getting involved in such dangerous activities. Naare then tries to use the Mind Trick ability on Kordi, but it has no effect on her. Rowan is determined to help out and tricks Roger into helping him take a ship out in search of another Kyber Saber crystal, which they find in an asteroid belt. The belt is run by Graballa the Hutt, whose men bring the pair to him after they recover the crystal. Alerted to the importance of the artifact, Graballa demands Rowan tell him how to find the rest of its pieces and threatens to feed him to his pet if he refuses. Zander, Kordi, and Naare arrive to rescue the pair, and after a harrowing encounter manage to do so. The Kyber Saber crystal is lost in the belt but then recovered, while Graballa sets his minions on the hunt for the Freemakers in order to obtain the crystals for himself.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 103\n| Viewers         = 0.36\n| ShortSummary    = Wealthy client Wick Cooper brings his classic N-1 Naboo Starfighter to the Freemakers, and the starstruck Zander defies Kordi's wishes by stealing the ship and taking it on a joy ride that lands him in Imperial custody. With the somewhat reluctant aid of Naare, Zander's siblings board the ship in order to rescue their brother and the fighter while Roger distracts their client. Believing the Freemakers to be Rebels, Darth Vader attempts to interrogate Zander and later holds him and his siblings captive until he sees the N-1 and, between his own love of ships and the nostalgia of his piloting one in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, takes off on a ride in the craft himself. The Freemakers are able to trick the Imperials and recover the fighter, but it is left badly damaged and Cooper infuriated until he spots Zander's pride and joy, the Blazemaster, sitting in the shop. Taking the ship as recompense for damages, Cooper flies out only to be left adrift when the incomplete ship explodes.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 104\n| Viewers         = 0.44\n| ShortSummary    = During the evacuation of Cloud City as seen in The Empire Strikes Back, Lobot is captured while attempting to recover \"precious cargo\" from Lando's quarters. Some time later, Rowan is struggling with moving objects using the Force, and Zander tries to cheer him up by taking him to the Wheel's lower ring. While there Rowan meets Lando who is offering a reward to anyone who can recover the cargo from Cloud City, and Kordi quickly agrees to the mission. However, Dengar and his bumbling partners Baash and Raam have also learned of the mission, while Naare comes to suspect that the Freemakers may have learned of her allegiance to the Empire and are gathering the Kyber Saber Crystals without her. The three parties soon arrive on Cloud City, and Rowan ends up frozen in carbonite while Kordi is retrieving the package. A chase soon ensues as Dengar and co. seize Lando's case-which they and Naare believe contains a Kyber Saber Crystal-and the frozen Rowan, leading Zander to a desperate plan: damaging Cloud City's repulsorlift systems so that the city begins to plummet into the depths of Bespin. They manage to free Rowan, and after being freed from the carbonite he is able-due to not being able to rely on his eyesight-to use the Force to repair the repulsorlift system and get the city back to its proper altitude. Lando soon rewards the Freemakers for retrieving the cargo–his much-longed-for wardrobe–while Dengar's crew are imprisoned on Cloud City but now know the identities of the Freemakers.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 105\n| Viewers         =\n| ShortSummary    = Due to business being slow and their rent being due in a matter of days, the Freemakers accept a dangerous mission: obtaining a wood panel for a Twi'lek businessman's starship that can only be obtained from Kashyyyk, the Wookiee homeworld under Imperial blockade. Despite Rowan's insistence that he can speak Wookiee, Kordi wants a translation droid, but settles for installing a translation program in Roger after learning what a real protocol droid costs. Their attempt to sneak in earns the attention of Lieutenant Commander Durpin, who is eager to keep the matter quiet so as not to draw attention to himself and risk getting promoted. After meeting party of Wookiees, the Freemakers receive the wood but then learn that they must free the son of the Wookiee chief from a Trandoshan prison in exchange. Despite some hiccups they succeed, but Rowan then senses the presence of a Kyber Saber Crystal inside the prison and insists on going after it despite the Wookiees starting their attack. The Freemakers manage to recover the crystal but the wood panel is damaged in their escape, while Durpin's failure to stop them is blamed on his lack of resources, leading to his reassignment and promotion to the rank of general.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 106\n| Viewers         = 0.49\n| ShortSummary    = Wick Cooper has brought his speeder bike to the Freemakers for repairs, even though they previously destroyed his N-1 Starfighter. Naare leaves on secret mission, after reminding Rowan he is forbidden from exposing his Force-sensitivity to anyone, just before Rebel fugitives Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa arrive at the Wheel with a damaged Y-wing, having just escaped from an Imperial patrol. When Imperial officer Estoc announces to the station that the fugitives are on the station, Roger accidentally launches the Star Scavenger with Luke and Rowan on board. Leia coaxes Kordi into not revealing her presence with a promise of paying five times the price of the Y-wing's repairs. With Leia concealed in a garbage container, the Freemakers attempt to smuggle her past the Stormtroopers, but the suspicious Estoc forces them to dump the garbage in the incinerator. Meanwhile, Luke is able to stop the Star Scavenger which crash-lands on Felucia. They make repairs, but an acklay has taken possession of the hyperdrive. Discovering the native plants bloom when the Force is used near them, Luke and Rowan distract the acklay and recover the hyperdrive. Back on the Wheel, Kordi and Zander have rescued the princes from the garbage chute. Zander knocks out the stormtroopers while Kordi and Leia escape to the Upper Ring where they accidentally hide in Cooper's quarters. They briefly convince him they are his cleaning crew, but stormtroopers are alerted, sending the girls back on the run. On Coruscant, Naare meets with the Emperor, who chides her for her failure to quickly find the parts of the Kyber Saber. Kordi and Leia hide in a diner, where Kordi is caught, but Leia attacks the troopers and Estoc to keep Kordi from being arrested. Zander arrives in the nick on Cooper's speeder bike. The Y-wing leaves the station, and is destroyed by Imperial TIEs, but it was only a decoy. The Freemakers convince Estoc that Leia forced them to help her. Roger, Rowan and Luke return; with the Y-wing destroyed, Luke and Leia take one of Zander's Z-wings to resume their voyage.Sometime later, a frustrated Naare returns as well. Rowan presents her with a flower from Felucia, that immediately wilts.

Rowan is troubled by the revelations of last episode and fears that Naare is a villain, but is unable to tell his siblings due to their concern over their cash flow. Podracing champion Ben Quadinaros then approaches the family about serving as his pit crew in a race on Tattooine, but it turns out to be a setup by Graballa. The Freemakers are able to escape on a stolen Podracer after Jabba arrives to investigate Graballa's presence, but end up stuck in the desert after the podrace leads to the destruction of their vehicle. They manage to take refuge in an abandoned Jawa sandcrawler, and the elder siblings contact Naare despite Rowan's half-hearted attempts to convince them not to do so. Graballa's forces arrive and attack, and are about to capture the Freemakers when Naare arrives and overcomes them with relative ease. During the battle, however, Rowan hides in her Eclipse Fighter and discovers her red-bladed lightsaber and dark side connection when the Emperor calls to check on her progress. The elder Freemakers are more convinced than ever of Naare's \"heroic\" nature, leaving Rowan at a loss as to how to deal with the deceiving Sith.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 108\n| Viewers         = 0.45\n| ShortSummary    = Rowan reveals to the other Freemakers that Naare is a Sith, and the group manage to escape her after being pursued by her in the Eclipse Fighter, though the Star Scavenger is badly damaged. Naare ends up making a deal with Graballa to hunt down the Freemakers and the crystals together, while the Freemakers crash land on Takodana, home to Maz Kanata. They lightly damage the ship of pirate Hondo Ohnaka, who is convinced to spare the Freemakers harm in exchange for them retrieving three golden orbs from one of Takodana's moons. Rowan, to his surprise, senses a Kyber Saber Crystal in Maz's castle, but assumes that he is imagining things and accompanies his siblings and Roger to the moon. They find that the orbs are in a pit surrounded by adult Varactyls, giant carnivorous lizards, and resort to lowering Roger into the pit from their smaller ship while the creatures are asleep. Roger wakes the creatures up after attempting to take more than Hondo's requested three orbs, and Rowan then discovers that the golden objects are Varactyl eggs. The group then return and confront Hondo over his dirty deal, and Maz then kicks Hondo out before gifting the Freemakers with a needed piece for their ship and another Kyber Saber Crystal. She then advises Rowan that, when things become desperate, he should seek out the Maker of Zoh.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 109\n| Viewers         = 0.44\n| ShortSummary    = The Freemakers continue to search for the Kyber Saber Crystals while being pursued by Naare, and lose one on a water planet before traveling to Naboo, where they discover one hidden in the Emperor Palpatine Museum. Sneaking Roger into the museum, they find that Durpin and Plumestriker are in charge of security. The contents of the museum prove distracting to the various members of the Freemaker family, and Rowan accidentally causes the Imperials to become aware of their presence. He is able to bluff his way into getting the Imperials to leave, only for Naare and Dengar to arrive in search of the crystal that Rowan has found. Roger and Dengar engage in a fire fight while Rowan battles Naare, only to find himself greatly out matched for his former master. He manages to bring down the museum and recovers Naare's blue lightsaber after she steals back her red lightsaber and gets the crystal from him, and the Freemakers escape. The Freemakers then learn that Naare has been using Roger to track them; Naare, learning of their discovery, is unconcerned, as the final crystal is known to be located on Hoth.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 110\n| Viewers         = 0.44\n| ShortSummary    = Realizing that Naare will be waiting for them on Hoth and has six of the seven Kyber Saber Crystals, the Freemakers ponder their next move after removing Roger's transmitter, which has been communicating to Naare since they contacted her from Tattooine. Remembering Maz's counsel, Rowan suggests that they travel to Zoh in search of the Maker; despite Zoh turning out to be a supposedly uninhabited junk planet, the group decides to go there. Upon arrival they find several cobbled together droids who attempt to drive them away only for them to be saved by the Maker, who is revealed to be Jek-14; Rowan then persuades him to teach him what he knows of building with the Force. Jek's droid companions become fearful that the Freemakers will take Jek with them and scheme to turn Roger to their side and destroy the unwanted interlopers; however, Roger proves faithful to his \"family\" and reactivates his transmitter, which brings Naare and Graballa to Zoh in search of the Freemakers. Jek confronts Naare while the Freemakers escape and is buried in junk; however, after the Freemakers and their enemies depart for Hoth, his hand is seen emerging from the pile as his droid friends rebuild.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 111\n| Viewers         = 0.34\n| ShortSummary    = The Freemakers fly to Hoth with Naare and Graballa's forces hot on their tails, but are able to land safely on the planet while Graballa's ship crashes. Roger causes the Star Scavenger to sink after thawing out a frozen lake, while the Freemakers encounter a baby Wampa before finding the last Kyber Saber Crystal. With their ship frozen the Freemakers are forced to enter Echo Base, where their old enemies Durpin and Plumestriker are now stationed, and Plumestriker inadvertently alerts Naare to the Freemakers' location while trying to capture them and secure promotions for himself and Durpin. However, the Wampa's mother arrives just in time to see the Imperials firing at her cub, and chases them off while the Freemakers are left to prepare for Naare's imminent arrival. Using their tools and Rowan's Force abilities, they repair some of the Rebel and Imperial technology left behind on the planet and fight against the arriving forces, unexpectedly freeing the Star Scavenger from the frozen lake in the process. Kordi shoots down Naare only for her to cause an avalanche with her Force powers and capture them, only to be knocked down when Durpin and Plumestriker come running by with the Wampa still in hot pursuit. Rowan briefly ponders surrendering to Naare in exchange for his family's safety, but instead tricks her with an ice crystal that melts when Naare attempts to form the Kyber Saber, enabling the Freemakers to escape with the real one. However, Rowan then takes Roger and the family salvage pod and leaves in order to protect his older siblings from Naare's continued pursuit.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 112\n| Viewers         = 0.46\n| ShortSummary    = The Emperor continues to demand that Naare hand over the Kyber Saber Crystals as she and Graballa search for the Freemakers; meanwhile, Kordi and Zander search for Rowan to no avail. The youngest member of the Freemakers has secluded himself on an unknown planet with Roger, using the battle droid's recorded memories of Clone Wars Jedi to learn new lightsaber techniques. Giving up on finding Rowan and resigning themselves to him finding them, Kordi and Zander decided to return to the Wheel only to be overheard by one of Graballa's spies, who informs the villains; they then ambush the pair on the wheel. Naare subjects the pair to individually tailored tortures-ripping apart Zander's ships with the Force and destroying Kordi' credits-in order to lure in Rowan, who senses their pain and leaves the last crystal on the planet before flying to their rescue. Arriving on the Wheel, he engages Naare in a full-on duel while the freed Kordi and Zander battle Graballa and his bounty hunters; though he performs well, Naare overpowers him and learns that Roger knows the location of the last crystal. Removing the battle droid's head, she then double crosses Graballa before burying Rowan under a pile of ship parts and departing to recover the crystal; however, Rowan survives her assault and has an epiphany regarding what must be done to stop her.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n| ProdCode        = 113\n| Viewers         = 0.45\n| ShortSummary    = It is Empire Day on Coruscant, and the Emperor sends Vader off to investigate Rebel activity before learning that Naare has almost claimed the last Kyber Saber Crystal; however, Naare has had enough of his belittling and, upon recreating the saber, claims it for herself and sets her sights on becoming Sith Empress. Meanwhile, Rowan uses his Force abilities to rebuild the Star Scavenger before proposing a desperate plan to his siblings; the trio then make their way to Coruscant and attempt to sneak into the Emperor's palace through the planet's sewer system. The Emperor desperately recalls Vader as Naare begins tearing her way through the Imperial fleet using the Kyber Saber, and he quickly determines to evacuate only to run into Rowan, who is disguised as him, and mistake him for a decoy. Rowan then waits in the Emperor's throne room for Naare, while Roger-his head discarded by Naare-informs Kordi and Zander of Naare's plans to claim the Empire; Naare soon discovers Rowan's ruse. The Emperor then attacks with a force of walkers and fighters only for Naare to dispatch them easily, who declares herself Empress and then drops a load of civilians off a ledge when they refuse to acknowledge her. Rowan is then able to use his ability to call to the Kyber Saber Crystals to tear the saber apart and out of Naare's grasp, and reforms the Saber in order to face Naare in a final showdown. After overcoming her, Rowan contemplates using its power to take revenge on her and is encouraged by the Emperor, but rejects the Sith Lord's offer and departs with his siblings and Roger's head. Pursued by TIE Fighters, they deploy Zander's masterpiece, the Blazemaker, as a decoy while the Star Scavenger is reconfigured into a new form to enable it to slip past the planetary defenses. The Freemakers escape while Naare is abducted and frozen in carbonite by a vengeful Graballa, and the Emperor has Rowan placed on his list of top enemies, after the leaders of the Rebellion. Rowan then tosses the Kyber Saber into a volcanic crater to ensure that it will never fall into the wrong hands again, and are then invited to join the Rebellion by Admiral Ackbar.\n| LineColor       = FBEC5D\n}}\n}}\nSeason 2 (2017)\n| ProdCode        = 201\n| Viewers         = 0.26\n| ShortSummary    = After joining the Rebel Alliance, the Freemakers embark on a series of misadventures.
