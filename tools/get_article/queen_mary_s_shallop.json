She was one of several state barges used during state occasions between 1689 and 1849. However, when ''Prince Frederick's Barge was taken out of service in 1849, she was the only state barge of the English Crown still in use. She was finally retired in the early twentieth century.\nShe was present at various occasions, such as the Royal Regatta at Henley in 1912, and the Peace Pageant in 1919. In 1930 she was given to the National Maritime Museum by King George V, and is in storage as of 2021.\nSee also\n* State Barge of Charles II\n* Gloriana''\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
