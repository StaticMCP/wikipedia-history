They have been implemented in an effort to enhance the public's awareness about the harmful effects of smoking. In general, warnings used in different countries try to emphasize the same messages. Warnings for some countries are listed below. Such warnings have been required in tobacco advertising for many years, with the earliest mandatory warning labels implemented in the United States in 1966. Implementing tobacco warning labels has been strongly opposed by the tobacco industry, most notably in Australia, following the implementation of plain packaging laws.\nThe WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, adopted in 2003, requires such warning messages to promote awareness against smoking.\nThe effectiveness of tobacco warning labels has been studied extensively over the past 50 years, and research shows that they are generally effective in changing smoking attitudes and behaviors. A 2009 science review determined that there is \"clear evidence that tobacco package health warnings increase consumers' knowledge about the health consequences of tobacco use\". The warning messages \"contribute to changing consumers' attitudes towards tobacco use as well as changing consumers' behavior\".\nDespite the demonstrated benefits of warning labels, the efficacy of fear-based messaging in reducing smoking behaviors has been subject to criticism. A 2007 meta-analysis demonstrated that messages emphasizing the severity of threat may be less effective at changing behaviors than messages focusing on susceptibility to threat, suggesting that extremely graphic warning labels are no more effective than labels that simply state the negative consequences of a behavior. Additionally, the study found that warning labels may not be effective among smokers who are not confident that they can quit, leading the authors to recommend exploring other methods of behavior modification.\nIn many countries, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including hematuria and diabetes) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.\nAlbania\nAs of 2020, all tobacco products in Albania must have one of the following general warning on the packaging: \"Smoking kills - quit now\" or \"Smoking kills\". Additionally, packaging must contain an information message about the product, as follows: \"Tobacco contains over 70 substances that cause cancer\". The general warning and the information message must occupy 50% of the packaging area of the side on which they are printed. Albania also requires the use of combined warnings that includes the text warning and a colored image, which must cover 65% of the front and back area of the packaging.\nText-based general warning label used on tobacco packages in Albania:\nArgentina\nGeneral warning before 2013:\nAs of 30 January 2013, Argentina passed a law requiring all cigarette packages must include graphical warning labels that show the detrimental effects on the health of long-term smokers, including COVID-19 (added in 2022).\nAustralia\nOn 1 December 2012, Australia introduced ground-breaking legislation and the world's toughest tobacco packaging warning messages to date. All marketing and brand devices were removed from the package and replaced with warnings, only the name of the product remains in generic standard sized text. All tobacco products sold, offered for sale or otherwise supplied in Australia were plain-packaged and labelled with new and expanded health warnings.\nAzerbaijan\nIn Azerbaijan, a text-only health warning in the Azeri language, \"Smoking harms your health\", is required to cover 30% of the front and back of the package. There is no requirement for rotation, and there is only one required health warning. Misleading packaging and labeling, including terms such as \"light\" and \"mild,\" is prohibited.\nBangladesh\nBangladesh law requires rotating pictorial health warnings to cover at least 50% of the main display areas of all tobacco products. Misleading terms such as \"light\" and \"low tar\" are prohibited on tobacco packaging, but other misleading packaging (e.g., colors, numbers, and symbols) is not banned.\nBolivia\nPrior to 2020, Bolivia required graphic text and image warnings covering 50% of the pack on the main faces. However, in 2020 Bolivia passed Ley Nº 1280 (Law No. 1280). Ley Nº 1280 requires display graphic health warnings, consisting of both images and text, on the front and back (principal surfaces) of all cigarette packs that occupy 60% of each main face, and are located at the top of the face. The text warnings warn the population of the risks of consuming tobacco products, as well as the risk of exposure to the harmful effects of tobacco smoke and environmental risks. The warnings can only be obscured in the case of soft packs that require a support element. There are currently no required warnings on smokeless tobacco products.\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\" and \"Croatian\" versions are identical and the \"Serbian\" one is a Cyrilic transliteration of the exact same text.]]\nBosnia and Herzegovina law requires:\nFront of packaging (covers 30% of surface):\n* Pušenje je štetno za zdravlje (Smoking is harmful to health)\n* Pušenje ubija (Smoking kills)\n* Pušenje ozbiljno šteti vama i drugima oko vas (Smoking seriously harms you and others around you)\nBack of packaging (covers 50% of surface):\n* Pušenje uzrokuje rak pluća (Smoking causes lung cancer)\n* Pušenje uzrokuje srčani udar (Smoking causes heart attacks)\n* Pušenje uzrokuje moždani udar (Smoking causes strokes)\n* Pušenje u trudnoći šteti zdravlju Vašeg djeteta (Smoking while pregnant harms your child)\nBefore 2011, a small warning with the text Pušenje je štetno za zdravlje (Smoking is harmful to health) was printed on the back of cigarette packets.\nBrazil\nIn 2001, Brazil became the second country in the world and the first country in Latin America to adopt mandatory warning images in cigarette packages. Warnings and graphic images illustrating the risks of smoking occupy 100% of the back of cigarette packs. In 2008, the government enacted a third batch of images aimed at younger smokers. The rule was in force for nine years until 2017, when yet another batch of warnings were introduced. They contain images as equally disturbing as the previous ones but also contain subtle messages such as \"Você morre\" (You die), \"Você sofre\" (You suffer) and \"Você adoece\" (You get sick).\nSince 2003, the sentence\nis displayed in all packs.\nBrunei\nThe following warnings appear on cigarette packages in Brunei since 2007, based on those of Singapore though displayed in both Malay and English:\n* (Smoking causes various cancers)\n* (Smoking causes strokes and heart disease)\n* (Smoking kills)\n* (Smoking damages your teeth)\n* (Tobacco smoke harms your baby)\n* (Tobacco smoke can kill babies)\n* (Smoking causes lung cancer)\n* (Smoking causes impotence)\nCambodia\nIn August 2021, the Cambodian Ministry of Health mandated the display of pictorial health warnings, requiring them to cover 55% of the packaging and be updated every two years. The warnings range from a gangrenous foot to premature birth.\nCanada\nCanada has had three phases of tobacco warning labels. The first set of warnings was introduced in 1989 under the Tobacco Products Control Act, and required warnings to be printed on all tobacco products sold legally in Canada. The set consisted of four messages printed in black-and-white on the front and back of the package, and was expanded in 1994 to include eight messages covering 25% of the front top of the package.\nIn 2000, the Tobacco Products Information Regulations (TPIR) were passed under the Tobacco Act. The regulations introduced a new set of sixteen warnings. Each warning was printed on the front and back of the package, covering 50% of the surface, with a short explanation and a picture illustrating that particular warning, for example:\naccompanied by a picture of cancerous growths inside a human lung.\nAdditionally, on the inside of the packaging or, for some packets, on a pull-out card, \"health information messages\" provide answers and explanations regarding common questions and concerns about quitting smoking and smoking-related illnesses. The side of the package also featured information on toxic emissions and constituent levels.\nIn 2011, the TPIR were replaced for cigarettes and little cigars with the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars). These regulations introduced the third and current set of 16 warnings in Canada. Currently, cigarette and little cigar packages in Canada must bear new graphic warning messages that cover 75% of the front and back of the package. The interior of each package contains 1 of 8 updated health warning messages, all including the number for a national quitline. The side of the package now bears 1 of 4 simplified toxic emission statements. These labels were fully implemented on cigarette and little cigar packages by June 2012 (though the 2000 labels still appear on other tobacco products). Canada also prohibits terms such as \"light\" and \"mild\" from appearing on tobacco packaging. The current labels were based on extensive research and a long consultation process that sought to evaluate and improve upon the warnings introduced in 2000.\nIn accordance with Canadian law regarding products sold legally in Canada, the warnings are provided in both English and French. Imported cigarettes to be sold in Canada which do not have the warnings are affixed with sticker versions when they are sold legally in Canada.\nHealth Canada considered laws mandating plain packaging, legal tobacco product packaging did still include warning labels, but brand names, fonts, and colors were replaced with simple unadorned text, thereby reducing the impact of tobacco industry marketing techniques.\nIt was mandated in January 2020.\nCanada became the first country in the world to require health warnings on each individual cigarettes and cigars, effective August 1, 2023, to be phased in over time when the regulation is fully in effect by April 2025.\nChile\nSince November 2006, all cigarette packages sold in Chile are required to have one of two health warnings, a graphic pictorial warning or a text-only warning. These warnings are replaced with a new set of two warnings each year.\nChina\nUnder laws of the People's Republic of China, the Law on Tobacco Monopoly (中华人民共和国烟草专卖法) Chapter 4, Article 18 and Regulations for the Implementation of the Law on Tobacco Monopoly (中华人民共和国烟草专卖法实施条例) Chapter 5 Article 29, cigarettes and cigars sold within Mainland China should indicate the grade of tar content and \"Smoking is hazardous to your health\" (吸烟有害健康) in the Chinese language on the packs and cartons.\nIn 2009, the warnings were changed. The warnings, which occupy not less than 30% of the front and back of cigarette packs, show \"吸烟有害健康 尽早戒烟有益健康\" (Smoking is harmful to your health. Quitting smoking early is good for your health) in the front and \"吸烟有害健康 戒烟可减少对健康的危害\" (Smoking is harmful to your health. Quitting smoking can reduce health risks) in the back.\nThe warnings were revised in October 2016 and must occupy at least 35% of the front and back of cigarette packs. The following are the current warnings.\n* In the front:\n*: 本公司提示吸烟有害健康请勿在禁烟场所吸烟\n*:(\"Our company notes that smoking is harmful to your health. Do not smoke in non-smoking areas\" in Chinese)\n* In the back:\n*: 尽早戒烟有益健康戒烟可减少对健康的危害\n*:(\"Quitting smoking as soon as possible is good for your health. It can also reduce health risks\" in Chinese)\n* or\n*: 劝阻青少年吸烟禁止中小学生吸烟\n*:(\"Dissuade teenagers from smoking. Prohibit primary and middle school students from smoking\" in Chinese)\nTimor-Leste\nTimor-Leste only used a text warning, \"FUMA OHO ITA\" (Smoking kills), prior to 2018, when new pictorial warnings covering 85% of the front and 100% of the back of packages were implemented.\nThe warnings currently in use are:\n* FUMA OHO ITA (Smoking kills), featuring a crucifix made of cigarettes on a pile of human skulls.\n* FUMA KAUZA IMPOTÉNSIA (Smoking causes impotence)\n* FUMA PROVOKA MORAS FUAN (Smoking can cause heart attacks)\n* FUMA KAUZA ABORTU (Smoking causes abortions)\n* FUMA PROVOKA KANKRU (Smoking can cause cancer)\n* FUMA KAUZA PULMAUN KRONIKU (Smoking causes chronic lung disease)\n* Konsulta atu para fuma – Numero telf: 113 (Consultation for quitting smoking – Phone number: 113), accompanying all of these warnings.\nEuropean Union\nCigarette packets and other tobacco packaging must include warnings in the same size and format and using the same approved texts (in the appropriate local languages) in all member states of the European Union.\nThese warnings are displayed in black Helvetica bold on a white background with a thick black border. Ireland once prefaced its warnings with \"Irish Government Warning\", Latvia with \"Veselības ministrija brīdina\" (Health Ministry Warning) and Spain with \"Las autoridades sanitarias advierten\" (\"The Health Board Warns\"). In member states with more than one official language, the warnings are displayed in all official languages, with the sizes adjusted accordingly (for example in Belgium the messages are written in Dutch, French and German, in Luxembourg in French and German and in Ireland, in Irish and English). All cigarette packets sold in the European Union used to have to display the content of nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide in the same manner on the side of the packet, this is no longer the case.\nIn 2003, it was reported that sales of cigarette cases had surged, attributable to the introduction of more prominent warning labels on cigarette packs by an EU directive in January 2003. Alternatively, people choose to hide the warnings using various \"funny\" stickers, such as \"You could be hit by a bus tomorrow.\"\nThe most recent EU legislation is the Tobacco Products Directive, which became applicable in EU countries in May 2016.\n*front, takes up 30%\n*reverse, takes up 40%\nAustria and Germany\n;General warnings:\n* Rauchen fügt Ihnen und den Menschen in Ihrer Umgebung erheblichen Schaden zu. – Smoking severely harms you and the people around you.\n;Additional warnings:\n* Raucher sterben früher – Smokers die younger.\n* Rauchen führt zur Verstopfung der Arterien und verursacht Herzinfarkte und Schlaganfälle. – Smoking leads to clogging of arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes.\n* Rauchen verursacht tödlichen Lungenkrebs. – Smoking causes deadly lung cancer.\n* Rauchen in der Schwangerschaft schadet Ihrem Kind – Smoking while pregnant harms your child.\n* Schützen Sie Kinder – lassen Sie sie nicht Ihren Tabakrauch einatmen! – Protect children – don't let them inhale your tobacco smoke!\n* Ihr Arzt oder Apotheker kann Ihnen dabei helfen, das Rauchen aufzugeben. – Your doctor or pharmacist can help you to give up smoking.\n* Rauchen macht sehr schnell abhängig: Fangen Sie gar nicht erst an! – Smoking makes you addicted very fast: Don't start in the first place!\n* Wer das Rauchen aufgibt, verringert das Risiko tödlicher Herz- und Lungenerkrankungen – Giving up smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases.\n* Rauchen kann zu einem langsamen und schmerzhaften Tod führen – Smoking can lead to a slow and painful death.\n* Rauchen kann zu Durchblutungsstörungen führen und verursacht Impotenz – Smoking can lead to blood circulation disorders and causes impotence.\n* Rauchen lässt Ihre Haut altern – Smoking ages your skin.\n* Rauchen kann die Spermatozoen schädigen und schränkt die Fruchtbarkeit ein – Smoking can damage the spermatozoa and decreases your fertility.\n* Rauch enthält Benzol, Nitrosamine, Formaldehyd und Blausäure – Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamine, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.\nBelgium\npackage. Warning reads \"Smoking harms your lungs. Open wound following lung surgery\"]]\nBelgium became a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on January 30, 2006. In April 2007, EU-specification text warnings were introduced. Including borders, these messages cover 48% of the front and 63% of the back of cigarette packages, larger than the EU requirements of 35% front and 50% back and amounting to 56% of the overall package, to accommodate Belgium's three official languages of German, French and Dutch.\nGeneral warning before 2011:\n*\nSince 2011, three different sets of 14 pictorial warnings have been rotated every 12 months.\nBelgium prohibits the terms \"light\" and \"mild\" from appearing on packages. Additionally, the country requires tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide emission numbers to appear on the side of packages. These emission numbers are generated using the ISO machine smoking method.\nCroatia\nCroatia requires:\nFront of packaging (covers 30% of surface):\nor\nBack of packaging (covers 40% of surface):\n* Pušači umiru mlađi (Smokers die younger)\n* Pušenje uzrokuje začepljenje arterija i uzrokuje srčani i moždani udar (Smoking clogs your arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes)\n* Pušenje uzrokuje smrtonosan rak pluća (Smoking causes fatal lung cancer)\n* Pušenje u trudnoći šteti vašem djetetu (Smoking while pregnant harms your child)\n* Zaštitite djecu od udisanja vašeg cigaretnog dima (Protect children from inhaling your cigarette smoke)\n* Vaš liječnik ili ljekarnik može vam pomoći prestati pušiti (Your doctor or pharmacist can help you stop smoking)\n* Pušenje stvara izrazitu ovisnost, nemojte ni počinjati (Smoking is highly addictive, don't even start)\n* Prestanak pušenja umanjuje rizik smrtnih srčanih ili plućnih bolesti (Quitting smoking reduces the risk of deadly heart and lung diseases)\n* Pušenje može izazvati polaganu i bolnu smrt (Smoking can cause a slow and painful death)\n* Potražite pomoć za prestanak pušenja /savjetujte se sa svojim liječnikom/ljekarnikom) (Get help to stop smoking /consult with your doctor/pharmacist)\n* Pušenje može usporiti krvotok i prouzročiti impotenciju (Smoking can slow down blood circulation and cause impotence)\n* Pušenje uzrokuje starenje kože (Smoking causes aging of the skin)\n* Pušenje može oštetiti spermu i smanjiti plodnost (Smoking can damage sperm and reduce fertility)\n* Dim sadrži benzene, nitrozamine, formaldehide i ugljikove cijanide (Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanides*)\nThe last warning contains a mistranslation from Directive 2001/37/EC – \"hydrogen\" was translated as ugljik (carbon) instead of vodik. It was nevertheless signed into law and started appearing on cigarette packages in March 2009.\n2004–2009\nThese warnings were also simple text warnings.\nFront of packaging:\n* Pušenje šteti Vašem zdravlju (Smoking harms your health)\nBack of packaging:\n* Pušenje uzrokuje rak (Smoking causes cancer)\n* Pušenje u trudnoći šteti i razvoju djeteta (Smoking while pregnant harms the child's development)\n* Pušenje uzrokuje srčani i moždani udar (Smoking causes heart attacks and strokes)\n* Pušenje skraćuje život (Smoking shortens your life)\nSide of packaging:\n* Zabranjuje se prodaja osobama mlađim od 18 godina (Not for sale to persons under the age of 18)\n1997–2004\nBetween 1997 and 2004, a simple text label warning, Pušenje je štetno za zdravlje (Smoking is harmful to health), was used.\nCyprus\n;Front side\n|(Smoking kills.)}}\nor\n|(Smoking seriously harms you and those around you.)}}\n;Rear\n*   (Smokers die younger.)\n*   (Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes.)\n*   (Smoking causes terminal lung cancer.)\n*   (Smoking during pregnancy may harm your baby.)\n*   (Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke.)\n*   (Your doctor or your pharmacist can help you stop smoking.)\n*   (Smoking is highly addictive, don't start.)\n*   (Stopping smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases.)\n*   (Smoking can cause a slow and painful death.)\n*   (Smoking may reduce the blood flow and cause impotence.)\n*   (Smoking causes ageing of the skin.)\n*   (Smoking can damage the sperm and decreases fertility.)\n*   (Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.)\nCzech Republic\n*Kouření vážně škodí Vám i lidem ve Vašem okolí.

Also cigarette manufacturers are prohibited to display the content of nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide on cigarette packages, because it might mislead customers. The box previously containing the contents of the cigarette was replaced by a warning message: Tabákový kouř obsahuje přes 70 látek, které prokazatelně způsobují rakovinu. (Tobacco smoke contains over 70 substances, which provably cause cancer.)\nDenmark\nWarning texts in tobacco products, health warnings, which are reproduced on the packaging of cigarettes and other tobacco products. It is implemented in an effort to strengthen public knowledge about the dangers of smoking.\nThe order was introduced in Denmark on 31 December 1991.

As a result, the European Communities (Manufacture, Presentation\nand Sale of Tobacco Products) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 were put in place. This provides that tobacco products going to market after 30 September 2008 must carry warnings in Irish and English. A year-long transition period applied to products which were on the market prior to 1 October 2008, which may have been sold until 1 October 2009.\nEach packet of tobacco products must carry:\n*One of the following general warnings (in both the Irish and English languages) which must cover at least 32% of the external side.\n**Toradh caithimh tobac – bás – Smoking kills\n**Déanann caitheamh tobac díobháil thromchúiseach duit agus do na daoine mórthimpeall ort – Smoking seriously harms you and others around you\n*and one of the following additional warnings (in both the Irish and English languages) which must cover at least 45% of the external side.\n**Giorrú saoil tobac a chaitheamh – Smokers die younger\n**Nuair a chaitear tobac, tachtar na hartairí agus is é cúis le taomanna croí agus strócanna – Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes\n**Caitheamh tobac is cúis le hailse scamhóg mharfach – Smoking causes fatal lung cancer\n**Má chaitheann tú tobac le linn toirchis, déantar díobháil don leanbán – Smoking when pregnant harms your baby\n**Cosain leanaí: ná cuir iallach orthu do chuid deataigh an análú – ''Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke\n**Féadann do dhochtúir nó do chógaiseoir cabhrú leat éirí as caitheamh tobac Your doctor or your pharmacist can help you stop smoking\n**Is éasca a bheith tugtha do chaitheamh tobac, ná tosaigh leis – Smoking is highly addictive, don't start\n**Má éiríonn tú as tobac a chaitheamh laghdaítear an riosca de ghalair mharfacha chroí agus scamhóg – Stopping smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases\n**Féadann caitheamh tobac bheith ina chúis le bás mall pianmhar – Smoking can cause a slow and painful death\n**Faigh cúnamh chun éirí as caitheamh tobac: Íosghlao Stoplíne 1850 201 203 – Get help to stop smoking: Callsave Quitline 1850 201 203\n**Féadfaidh caitheamh tobac imshruthúfola a laghdú agus bheith ina chúis le héagumas – Smoking may reduce the blood flow and cause impotence\n**Caitheamh tobac is cúis le críonadh craicinn – Smoking causes ageing of the skin\n**Féadann caitheamh tobac dochar a dhéanamh don speirm agus laghdaíonn sé torthúlacht – Smoking can damage the sperm and decreases fertility\n**Cuimsíonn deatach beinséin, nítreasaimíní, formaildéad agus ciainíd hidrigine – Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide\n*In the case of Smokeless Tobacco Products, only the following warning must be displayed:\n**Féadann an táirge tobac seo dochar a dhéanamh do shláinte agus is táirge andúile é – This tobacco product can damage your health and is addictive''\nItaly\n*\n*  /  (Smoking kills / Smoking can kill.)\n*  (Smoking heavily damages you and those around you.)\n*  (Smokers die younger.)\n*  (Smoking clogs arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes.)\n*  (Smoking causes deadly lung cancer.)\n*  (Smoking during pregnancy harms your baby.)\n*  (Protect children, don't smoke in their presence.)\n*  (A doctor or pharmacist can help you quit smoking.)\n*  (Specialists in the medical sector can help you quit smoking.)\n*  (Smoking is highly addictive, don't start.)\n*  (Quitting smoking reduces the risk of deadly cardiovascular and lung diseases.)\n*  (Smoking can cause a long and painful death.)\n*  (Smoking causes oral cavities and cancer.)\n*  (Get help to quit smoking.)\n*  (Smoking may reduce blood circulation and causes impotence.)\n*  (Smoking ages the skin.)\n*  (Smoking may damage sperm and diminishes fertility.)\n*  (Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid.)\n*  (Smoking can lead to blindness.)\nOther text is sometimes placed in the packets;

Under Hong Kong Law, Chap 371B Smoking (Public Health) (Notices) Order, packaging must indicate the amount of nicotine and tar that is present in cigarette boxes in addition to graphics depicting different health problems caused by smoking in the size and ratio as prescribed by law. The warnings are to be published in both official languages, Traditional Chinese and English.\nEvery warning begins with the phrase '/HKSAR GOVERNMENT WARNING' and then one of the following in all caps:\n* /Smoking causes lung cancer\n* /Smoking kills\n* /Smoking harms your family\n* /Smoking causes peripheral vascular diseases\n* /Smoking may cause impotence\n* /Smoking can accelerate aging of the skin\nIn addition, any print advertisement must give minimum 85% coverage of the following warnings:\nHKSAR GOVERNMENT HEALTH WARNING\n* January - February SMOKING KILLS\n* March - April SMOKING CAUSES CANCER\n* May - June SMOKING CAUSES HEART DISEASE\n* July - August SMOKING CAUSES LUNG CANCER\n* September - October SMOKING CAUSES RESPIRATORY DISEASES\n* November - December SMOKING HARMS YOUR CHILDREN\nIn 2018, a new batch of warnings were introduced, consisting of the following warnings that cover 85% of packs:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The warning must cover at least 85% of the surface of the pack, of which 60% must be pictorial and the remaining 25% contains textual warnings in English, Hindi or any other Indian language.\nIn 2003, India ratified the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which includes a recommendation for large, clear health warnings on tobacco packages. However, there was a delay in implementing graphic warning labels.\nUntil 2008, cigarette packets sold in India were required to carry a written warning on the front of the packet with the text CIGARETTE SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH in English. Paan, gutkha and tobacco packets carried the warning TOBACCO IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH in Hindi and English. The law later changed. According to the new law, cigarette packets were required to carry pictorial warnings of a skull or scorpion along with the text SMOKING KILLS and TOBACCO CAUSES MOUTH CANCER in both Hindi and English.\nThe Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules 2008 requiring graphic health warnings came into force on 31 May 2008. Under the law, all tobacco products were required to display graphic pictures, such as pictures of diseased lungs, and the text SMOKING KILLS or TOBACCO KILLS in English, covering at least 40% of the front of the pack, and retailers must display the cigarette packs in such a way that the pictures on pack are clearly visible. In January 2012, controversy arose when it was discovered that an image of former English footballer John Terry was used on a warning label.\nOn 15 October 2014, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan announced that only 15% of the surface of a pack of cigarettes could contain branding, and that the rest must be used for graphic and text health warnings. The Union Ministry of Health amended the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules, 2008 to enforce the changes effective from 1 April 2015.\nHowever, the government decision to increase pictorial warnings on tobacco packets from 1 April was put on hold indefinitely, following the recommendations of a Parliamentary committee, which reportedly did not speak to health experts but only to tobacco lobby representatives. On 5 April 2016, the health ministry ordered government agencies to enforce this new rule.\nFollowing the intervention by the Parliamentary committee, NGO Health of Millions, represented by Prashant Bhushan, filed a petition in the Supreme Court of India, which asked the government to stop selling of loose cigarettes and publish bigger health warnings on tobacco packs.\nIndonesia\nIn Indonesia, tobacco warnings are not just placed on packages but also on cigarette advertisements, which are not banned in few countries including Indonesia.\nUntil December 31, 1999\nJanuary 2000–December 2013\nWith the enforcement of Indonesian Government Regulation No. 19 (2003), a new warning was implemented:\nThe last recorded usage of this warning in TV advertisements was an Esse Mild advertisement from late February 2014.\nDecember 2013–December 2018\nWith the enforcement of the Indonesian Government Regulation No. 109 (2012), all tobacco products/cigarette packaging and advertisement should include warning images and age restriction (18+). Graphic warnings must cover 40% of cigarette packages. After the introduction of graphic images in Indonesian cigarette packaging, the branding of cigarettes as \"light\", \"mild\", \"filter\", etc. is forbidden, except for brands that already use some words above such as L.A. Lights, A Mild or Dunhill Filter. However, the last advertisement to use this warning was a 2021 Djarum Super advertisement, before it subsequently used the 2018 warning.\nOther alternatives:\n* PERINGATAN: MEROKOK SEBABKAN KANKER MULUT (Warning: Smoking causes mouth cancer)\n* PERINGATAN: MEROKOK SEBABKAN KANKER TENGGOROKAN (Warning: Smoking causes throat cancer)\n* PERINGATAN: MEROKOK DEKAT ANAK BERBAHAYA BAGI MEREKA (Warning: Smoking endangers children near you)\n* PERINGATAN: MEROKOK SEBABKAN KANKER PARU-PARU DAN BRONKITIS KRONIS (Warning: Smoking causes lung cancer and chronic bronchitis)\nThese warnings below appear on the side of cigarette packaging:\n* DILARANG MENJUAL/MEMBERI PADA ANAK USIA DI BAWAH 18 TAHUN DAN PEREMPUAN HAMIL (Do not sell or give [this product] to children under 18 years old and pregnant women)\n* Optional: TIDAK ADA BATAS AMAN! MENGANDUNG LEBIH DARI 4.000 ZAT KIMIA BERBAHAYA, 43 ZAT PENYEBAB KANKER (There is no safe limit! Contains more than 4,000 hazardous chemicals and 43 carcinogens)\nJanuary 2019–September 2024\nAfter it was revealed that the pictorial warnings used in Indonesia originally came from the 2005 warnings of Thailand, on 31 May 2018, the Ministry of Health launched new pictorial health warnings, of which two depict Indonesian smokers and one depicts a smoker from Venezuela.\nOther alternatives:\n* PERINGATAN: MEROKOK SEBABKAN KANKER MULUT (Warning: Smoking causes mouth cancer)\n* PERINGATAN: MEROKOK SEBABKAN KANKER PARU (Warning: Smoking causes lung cancer)\n* PERINGATAN: ROKOK MERENGGUT KEBAHAGIAAN SAYA SATU PERSATU (Warning: One by one, cigarettes took my happiness away)\n* PERINGATAN: MEROKOK SEBABKAN KANKER TENGGOROKAN (Warning: Smoking causes throat cancer)\n* LAYANAN BERHENTI MEROKOK: 0800-177-6565 (Smoking quitline: 0800-177-6565)\n* DILARANG MENJUAL/MEMBERI PADA ANAK USIA DI BAWAH 18 TAHUN DAN PEREMPUAN HAMIL (Do not sell or give [this product] to children under 18 years old and pregnant women) (from January 2019 until August 2024)\n* DILARANG MENJUAL DAN MEMBERI KEPADA ORANG DI BAWAH 21 TAHUN DAN PEREMPUAN HAMIL (Do not sell and distribute to persons under 21 and pregnant women) (since August 2024)\nIran\nIn Iran, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including lung cancer and mouth cancer) are placed prominently on cigarette packages. Additionally, many cigarette packs contain a message underneath each image: \"ترک سیگار موجب سلامتی و افزایش طول عمرمیشود\", literally \"quitting cigarettes makes you healthier and increases your life expectancy\".\nJapan\nIn 1972, Japan became the first country in Asia to display a general warning on cigarette packages.\nPrior to 2005, there was only one warning on all Japanese cigarette packages.\n* (For the good of your health, be careful not to smoke too much) (1972–1989)\n* (Be careful not to smoke too much, as there is a risk of damaging your health) (1990–2005)\nSince 2005, more than one general warning is printed on cigarette packaging.\nOn the front of cigarette packages:\n* (Smoking is a cause of lung cancer. According to epidemiological estimates, smokers are about two to four times more likely than non-smokers to die of lung cancer.)\n* (Smoking increases risk of myocardial infarctions. According to epidemiological estimates, smokers are about 1.7 times more likely than non-smokers to die of a heart attack.)\n* (Smoking increases risk of strokes. According to epidemiological estimates, smokers are about 1.7 times more likely than non-smokers to die of a stroke.)\n* (Smoking can aggravate the symptoms of emphysema.)\nOn the back of cigarette packages:\n* (Smoking during pregnancy is a cause of premature births and impaired fetal growth. According to epidemiological estimates, pregnant women who smoke have almost double the risk of low birth weight and three times the risk of premature births than pregnant women who do not smoke. (For more information, please visit the Ministry of Health home page at www.mhlw.go.jp/topics/tobacco/main.html.))\n* (Tobacco smoke adversely affects the health of people around you, especially infants, children and the elderly. When smoking, be careful not to annoy others.)\n* (The degree may differ from person to person, but nicotine [in cigarettes] causes addiction to smoking.)\n* (Smoking while underage heightens the addiction and damage to health caused by cigarettes. Never smoke, even if encouraged to by those around you.)\nLaos\nLaos introduced graphical warnings in 2016. Eight years later, these warnings were updated, one of which depicts a traditional Lao stupa grave accompanied by the message \"Tobacco kills one in two smokers who don't quit\".\nMalaysia\nIn Malaysia, a general warning was used between 1976 and 2009:  (Warning from the Government of Malaysia: Smoking endangers health).\nGraphic images on cigarette packs were introduced in June 2009 to show the adverse long-term effects of excessive smoking, replacing the general warning with text describing said images printed in Malay (front) and English (back) explaining:\n* \"Amaran: Rokok penyebab ...\"\n* \"Warning: Cigarettes cause ...\"\nGraphic warnings must cover 40% of the front of cigarette packages and 60% of the back. The branding of cigarettes as \"light\", \"mild\", etc. is also forbidden.\nMaldives\nIn the Maldives, products containing tobacco are required by law to have (in Dhivehi):\nAt the front and back:\n* A health warning eg. Smoking gives you a painful death ()\n* A cessation message eg. Stop quickly! ()\n* A graphic image eg. cut open body showing lung cancer\n* Description of the image\nOn the sides:\n* Explanatory message of complications caused by tobacco eg. Tobacco contains 250 poisonous chemicals. These poisons damage vital organs of the body, causing cancer, stroke, lung damage, and other such painful illnesses. ()\n* A message Get help from a health professional to save yourself! ()\nMexico\nSince 2010, cigarette packs in Mexico must contain health warnings and graphic images. By law, 30% of the pack's front, 100% of the pack's rear and 100% of one lateral must consist on images and warnings. The Secretariat of Health issues new warnings and images every six months. Images have included a dead rat, a partial mastectomy, a laryngectomy, a dead human fetus surrounded by cigarette butts, a woman being fed after suffering a stroke and damaged lungs, amongst others.\nWarnings include smoking-related diseases and statistics, toxins found in cigarettes and others.\nMexico became the first country to put a warning on cigarette packs that tobacco use could increase the risk of COVID-19 infection.\nMoldova\nGeneral warning (on the front of cigarette packages, covering at least 30% of the area, Helvetica font):\n*\"Fumatul ucide\" (Smoking kills) or\n*\"Fumatul dăunează grav sănătăţii dumneavoastră şi a celor din jur\" (Smoking seriously harms you and those around);\nAdditional warnings (on the back of cigarette packages, covering at least 40% of the area, Helvetica font):\n*\"Fumătorii mor mai tineri\" (Smokers die younger);\n*\"Fumatul blochează arterele şi provoacă infarct miocardic şi accident vascular cerebral\" (Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes);\n*\"Fumatul conduce la moarte de cancer pulmonar\" (Smoking causes death from lung cancer);\n*\"Fumatul în timpul sarcinii dăunează copilului dumneavoastră\" (Smoking while pregnant harms your baby);\n*\"Protejaţi copiii dumneavoastră de inspirarea fumului de ţigaretă\" (Protect your children from breathing in the cigarette smoke);\n*\"Psihologul, profesorul sau medicul vă poate ajuta să renunţaţi la fumat\" (Psychologists, professors and doctors can help you quit smoking);\n*\"Fumatul creează dependenţă rapidă, nu încercaţi să fumaţi\" (Smoking becomes addictive fast, try not to smoke);\n*\"Abandonarea fumatului reduce riscul de îmbolnăviri cardiace sau pulmonare fatale\" (Quitting smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases);\n*\"Fumatul poate provoca o moarte lentă şi dureroasă\" (Smoking can cause a slow and painful death);\n*\"Fumatul reduce circulaţia sîngelui şi provoacă impotenţă\" (Smoking reduces blood circulation and increases impotency);\n*\"Fumatul provoacă îmbolnăvirea tenului (pielei)\" (Smoking causes skin diseases);\n*\"Fumatul creează grave disfuncţii sexuale\" (Smoking causes serious sexual dysfunction);\nRegulated by \"Lege cu privire la tutun şi la articolele din tutun\" (Law on tobacco and tobacco articles) nr. 278-XVI from 14.12.2007 enabled at 07.03.2008\nThere is no such rule in Transnistria, where cigarette packages have variable warning labels depending on where they come from.\nNew Zealand\ncigarettes sold in New Zealand in 2010.]]\nThe first health warnings appeared on cigarette packets in New Zealand in 1974. Warning images accompanying text have been required to appear on each packet since 28 February 2008. New regulations were made on 14 March 2018 which provided for larger warnings and a new schedule of images and messages.\nBy law, 75% of a pack's front and 100% of its rear must consist of warning messages. Images include gangrenous toes, rotting teeth and gums, diseased lungs and smoking-damaged hearts. Cigarette packets also carry the New Zealand Quitline logo and phone number and other information about quitting smoking.\nIn total, there are 15 different warnings. A full list with pictures is available at the New Zealand Ministry of Health's [http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf/indexmh/tobacco-warnings-new website]. Warning messages are rotated annually. The following is a list of the warnings in English and Māori.\n* Smoking causes heart attacks, KA PĀ MAI NGĀ MANAWA-HĒ I TE KAI PAIPA\n* Smoking causes over 80% of lung cancers, NEKE ATU I TE 80% O NGĀ MATE PUKUPUKU KI NGĀ PŪKAHUKAHU I AHU MAI I TE KAI PAIPA\n* Smoking harms your baby before it is born, KA TŪKINOHIA TŌ PĒPI I TO KŌPŪ I TE KAI PAIPA\n* Your smoking harms others, KA TŪKINOHIA ĒTAHI ATU I Ō MAHI KAI PAIPA\n* Smoking is a major cause of stroke, KA PIKI AKE I TE KAI PAIPA TŌ TŪPONO KI TE IKURA RORO\n* Smoking damages your blood vessels, KA TŪKINOHIA Ō IA TOTO I TE KAI PAIPA\n* Smoking is not attractive, KA ANUANU KOE I TE KAI PAIPA\n* Smoking causes lung cancer, KA PĀ MAI TE MATE PUKUPUKU KI NGĀ PŪKAHUKAHU I TE KAI PAIPA\n* Smoking when pregnant harms your baby, KA TŪKINOHIA TŌ PĒPI I TE KAI PAIPA I A KOE E HAPŪ ANA\n* Your smoking harms children, KA TŪKINOHIA NGĀ TAMARIKI I Ō MAHI KAI PAIPA\n* Quit before it is too late, ME WHAKAMUTU KEI RIRO KOE\n* Smoking causes gum disease and stinking breath, KA PĀ TE MATE PŪNIHO, KA HAUNGA TŌ HĀ I TE KAI PAIPA\nNigeria\nSix warnings existed prior to 2013:\n* Smoking is addictive\n* Smoking damages lungs\n* Smoking can kill\n* Smoking can cause cancer\n* Smoking can damage the fetus\nFrom 2013 onwards, the general warning in Nigeria is: The Federal Ministry of Health warns that smokers are liable to die young.\nNorth Korea\nNorth Korea signed the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on 17 June 2003 and ratified it on 27 April 2005. Warnings are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They usually state that smoking is harmful to health. However, nicotine and tar content listed must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging in North Korea.\nNorway\n(bokmål)]]\nNorway has had general warnings on cigarette packets since 1975. Norway's warnings of today were introduced in 2003 and are in line with the European Union's legislation, as Norway is an EEA member:\nOn the front of cigarette and cigar packages, covering about 30% of the area:\n* (Smoking kills)\n* (Smoking is very harmful to you and your surroundings)\nOn the back of cigarette and cigar packages, covering about 45% of the area:\n* (Smoking causes fatal lung cancer)\n* (If you stop smoking, you will reduce the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases)\n* (Smoking causes early ageing of the skin)\n* (Smoking may reduce the blood flow and cause impotence)\n* (Smoking can cause a slow and painful death)\n* (Smoking can reduce sperm quality and decrease fertility)\n* (Protect children against smoke, don't let them inhale your smoke)\n* (Smoking is highly addictive: Don't start smoking)\n* (Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes)\n* (Your doctor or your pharmacy can help you stop smoking)\n* (Get help to stop smoking – call the Quitline: 800 400 85)\n* (Smoking lowers life expectancy)\n* (Smoking during pregnancy harms the child)\n* (Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide)\nTobacco products like snus and chewing tobacco have the following warning printed on them:\n* (This tobacco product may be a health hazard and is addictive)\nPakistan\nAll cigarette packages in Pakistan are required by Statutory Order 1219(I)/2008 dated 25 September 2008, published in The Gazette of Pakistan dated 24 November 2008, to carry rotating health warnings from 1 July 2009.\nEach health warning is printed for a period of 6 months, covering at least 30% on both sides of the packet and must be printed in Urdu at the front and English at the back. The warnings in English currently in use are:\n* Protect children, don't let them breathe your smoke – Ministry of Health\n* Smoking causes mouth and throat cancer – Ministry of Health\n* Quit smoking and live a longer life – Ministry of Health\n* Smoking severely harms you and the people around you – Ministry of Health\nParaguay\nThe Paraguay Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare requires cigarette packages to have graphic images and text warnings in both Spanish and Guaraní covering at least 40% of both main faces. Additionally, 100% of one of the sides must have detailed information as to the content of the cigarettes.\nPhilippines\nAll cigarette packaging sold in the Philippines are required to display a government warning label. The warnings include:\n* Government Warning: Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.\n* Government Warning: Cigarettes are addictive.\n* Government Warning: Tobacco smoke can harm your children.\n* Government Warning: Smoking kills.\nIn July 2014, President Benigno Aquino III signed the Republic Act 10643, or \"An Act to Effectively Instill Health Consciousness through Graphic Health Warnings on Tobacco Products\", more known as the \"Graphic Health Warning Act.\" This law requires tobacco product packaging to display pictures of the ill effects of smoking, occupying the bottom half of the display area in both front and the back side of the packaging. On 3 March 2016, Department of Health (DOH) secretary Janette Garin started the implementation of Republic Act 10643, requiring tobacco manufacturers to include graphic health warnings on newer cigarette packaging.\nWith the Graphic Health Warning Act implemented, graphic health warnings are used on all newer cigarette packages and older packages using text-only warnings are required to be replaced by newer ones incorporating graphic warnings. The 12 new warnings, showing photos of negative effects of smoking, like mouth cancer, impotence and gangrene are rotated every two years, and on 3 November 2016, all cigarette packaging without graphic health warning messages are banned from sale. Labeling of cigarettes with \"light\" or \"mild\" is also forbidden by the Graphic Health Warning Act.\nRussia\nIn Russia, warning messages have existed since the late 1970s, when the Soviet Union stipulated that the message \"The USSR Ministry of Health warns: Smoking is dangerous to your health\" be printed in Russian on the front (as ) and the language of each respective republic on the back of cigarette packages.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Warning messages on Russian cigarette packets\n!

Seek professional help to quit the habit.\n|}\nSingapore\nIn 1987, Singapore began displaying blunt, straight-to-the-point text warnings like \"Smoking damages your lungs\" and \"Smoking causes heart disease\" on cigarette packets. They were replaced by graphic warnings in August 2004 bearing the following messages:\n*Smoking causes a slow and painful death\n*Smoking harms your family\n*Tobacco smoke can kill babies\n*Smoking causes strokes\n*Smoking causes lung cancer\n*Smoking causes mouth diseases\n*Smoking causes 92% of oral cancers\nThese warnings were later copied by Brunei.\nIn 2016, the warnings were revised, with images focusing mostly on damaged organs. The following warnings show what is printed nowadays.\n*Smoking causes mouth diseases\n*Smoking can cause a slow and painful death\n*Smoking causes lung cancer\n*Smoking causes gangrene\n*Smoking causes neck cancer\n*Smoking harms your family\nFrom 1 January 2009, people possessing cigarettes without the SDPC (Singapore Duty Paid Cigarettes) label will be committing an offence under the Customs and GST Acts. The law was passed to distinguish non-duty paid, contraband cigarettes from duty-paid ones.\nSomalia\nA small warning in Somali and English is printed on Somali cigarette packages.\nSouth Africa\nIn South Africa, the Tobacco Products Control Act, 1993 and its amendments (1999, 2007, 2009), stipulate that a warning related to the harmful effects (health, social, or economic) of tobacco smoking, or the beneficial effects of cessation, must be placed prominently on tobacco products covering 15% of the obverse, 25% of the reverse and 20% of the sides of packs.\nAccording to the draft Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill, 2018, new legislation, once enacted, will require uniform, plain-colored packaging (branding and logos prohibited) containing the brand and product name in a standard typeface and color, a warning related to the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, or beneficial effects of cessation, and a graphic image of tobacco-related harm.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Warnings related to the harmful effects of tobacco smoking on South African tobacco products\n!Obverse\n!Reverse\n|-\n|DANGER: SMOKING CAN KILL YOU\n|Tobacco smoke contains many harmful chemicals such as carbon monoxide, cyanide, nicotine and tar, which can cause disease and death.

Your smoking increases their risk of lung cancer and heart disease. Stop smoking for the sake of your health and that of your family and friends.\n|}\nSouth Korea\nIn South Korea, general warnings on cigarette packaging have been used since 1976. The warning messages used since then have been:\n* From 1976 to November 1989:  (For your health, please refrain from smoking too much)\n* From December 1989 to 1996:  (Smoking may cause lung cancer and it is especially dangerous for teenagers and pregnant women)\n* From 1996 to March 2005:\nFront:  (Smoking causes lung cancer and other diseases and it is especially dangerous for teenagers and pregnant women)\nBack:  (It is illegal to sell cigarettes to people under 19) and additionally,  (You can be healthy and live longer if you quit),  (Smoking also causes paralysis and heart diseases),  (Smoking also damages your beloved children),  (Smoking damages others)\n* From April 2005 to April 2007:\nFront: 건강을 해치는 담배 그래도 피우시겠습니까?

Once you start smoking, it is very difficult to quit)\nBack:  (It is illegal to sell cigarettes to people under 19! It hurts your children's health)\n* From December 2016, 50% of cigarette packages must contain warning elements, of which 30% must be graphic warnings. In addition to the existing warning:  (Smoking can be a cause of disease), the following warning will be mandatory:  (Smoking can harm others' health)\n* From 2017, more pictorial warnings were added to cigarette packs.\nSri Lanka\nSri Lanka introduced graphic health warnings on cigarette packages in 2015. The warnings, displayed in English, Sinhalese and Tamil, cover 60% of both front and back panels.\nSwitzerland\nSwitzerland has warning messages in its three official languages (German, French and Italian). The three warning messages below, all meaning \"Smoking kills\", are posted on cigarette packs until 2024:\n* Rauchen ist tödlich.\n* Fumer tue.\n* Il fumo uccide.\nSince October 2024, the Federal Act on Tobacco Products updated the warnings to \"Smoking kills – stop now\":\n* Rauchen ist tödlich – hören Sie jetzt auf.\n* Fumer tue – arrêtez maintenant.\n* Il fumo uccide – smetti subito.\nTaiwan\nThe warnings in Taiwan are led by the phrase \"行政院衛生署警告\" (Warning from the Department of Health, Executive Yuan:) and followed by one of the following warnings:\n* 吸菸有害健康: Smoking is hazardous to your health\n* 孕婦吸菸易導致胎兒早產及體重不足: Smoking during pregnancy can cause premature death and underweight birth\n* 抽菸會導致肺癌﹑心臟病﹑氣腫及與懷孕有關的問題: Smoking can cause lung cancer, heart diseases, emphysema and pregnancy-related problems\n* 吸菸害人害己: Smoking hurts yourself and others\n* 懷孕婦女吸菸可能傷害胎兒，導致早產及體重不足: Smoking during pregnancy might damage the fetus and can cause premature death and underweight birth\n* 戒菸可減少健康的危害: Quitting smoking can reduce health risks (no longer used)\nThe images and warnings were revised in 2014, after the Department of Health was reorganised into the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The following warnings show what is printed since 1 June 2014.\n* 吸菸導致皮膚老化: Smoking causes ageing of the skin\n* 菸癮困你一生: Tobacco addiction traps your life\n* 吸菸會導致性功能障礙: Smoking causes sexual dysfunctions\n* 菸害導致胎兒異常及早產: Smoking causes birth defects and premature birth\n* 不吸菸，你可以擁有更多: You can have more if you quit smoking\n* 二手菸引發兒童肺炎、中耳炎、癌症: Second hand smoking causes pneumonia, otitis media and cancer in children\n* 吸菸影響口腔衛生: Smoking affects oral hygiene\n* 吸菸引發自己與家人中風與心臟病: Smoking makes you and your family suffer strokes and heart diseases\nWarnings of any version are accompanied with \"戒煙專線: 0800-636363\" (Smoking Quitline: 0800–636363).\nThailand\nRed pack|150px]]\nGraphic warnings have appeared on Thai cigarette packages since 25 March 2005 and underwent updates in 2006, 2009, 2010, 2014 and 2022. A recent study showed that the warnings made Thai smokers think more often about the health risks of smoking and about quitting smoking.\nThailand introduced plain packaging in 2020.\nTurkey\npack with an old warning]]\n;Front of packaging (covers 65% of surface)\nor\n;Back of packaging (covers 40% of surface)\n*  (Smokers die younger)\n*  (Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and paralysis.)\n*  (Smoking causes lethal lung cancer)\n*  (Smoking while pregnant will harm the baby)\n*  (Protect your children, don't let them breathe your smoke.)\n*  (Health agencies can help you quit smoking)\n*  (Smoking is highly addictive, don't start)\n*  (Stopping smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases)\n*  (Smoking can cause a slow and painful death)\n*  (To quit smoking ask for help from your doctor and ...)\n*  (Smoking will slow the blood flow and cause impotence)\n*  (Smoking causes early ageing of the skin)\n*  (Smoking can damage the sperm and decreases fertility)\n*  (Cigarette smoke contains carcinogens such as benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide.)\nUkraine\nThe warning messages on cigarette packets in Ukraine are also visually similar to those in European Union countries:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Warning messages on Ukrainian cigarette packets\n!

Government – Smoking can harm your health\", followed by the phrase \"Health Department's Chief Medical Officers\", issuers of the warning.\nIn 1991, the EU tightened laws on tobacco warnings. Thus, the message \"Tobacco seriously damages health\" was printed on the front of all tobacco packs. An additional warning was also printed on the reverse of cigarette packs.\nIn 2003, new EU regulations required one of the following general warnings must be displayed, covering at least 30% of the surface of the pack:\n* Smoking kills (- quit now)\n* Smoking seriously harms you and others around you\nAdditionally, one of the following additional warnings must be displayed, covering at least 40% of the surface of the pack:\n* Smokers die younger\n* Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes\n* Smoking causes fatal lung cancer\n* Smoking when pregnant harms your baby\n* Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke\n* Your doctor or your pharmacist can help you stop smoking\n* Smoking is highly addictive, don't start\n* Stopping smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases\n* Smoking can cause a slow and painful death\n* Get help to stop smoking: [telephone]/[postal address]/[internet address]/consult your doctor/pharmacist\n* Smoking may reduce the blood flow and cause impotence\n* Smoking causes ageing of the skin\n* Smoking can damage the sperm and decreases fertility\n* Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide\nFrom October 2008, all cigarette products manufactured must carry picture warnings in the reverse. Every pack must have one of these warnings by October 2009.\nPlain packaging, including prominent and standardised health warnings and minimal manufacturer information, became compulsory for all cigarette and hand-rolling tobacco packs manufactured after May 2016 and sold after May 2017.\nUnited States\n's warning on a cigarette pack, 2012]]\nhave ordered warning statements such as this one on a convenience store]]\nIn 1966, the United States became the first nation in the world to require a health warning on cigarette packages.\nIn 1973, the assistant director of Research at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company wrote an internal memorandum regarding new brands of cigarettes for the youth market. He observed that, \"psychologically, at eighteen, one is immortal\" and theorized that \"the desire to be daring is part of the motivation to start smoking.\" He stated, \"in this sense the label on the package is a plus.\"\nIn 1999, Philip Morris USA purchased three brands of cigarettes from Liggett Group Inc. The brands were: Chesterfield, L&M, and Lark. At the time Philip Morris purchased the brands from Liggett, the packaging for those cigarettes included the statement \"Smoking is Addictive\". After Philip Morris acquired the three Liggett brands, it removed the statement from the packages.\nThough the United States started the trend of labeling cigarette packages with warnings, today the country has one of the least restrictive labelling requirements on their packages. Warnings are usually in small typeface placed along one of the sides of the cigarette packs with colors and fonts that closely resemble the rest of the package, so the warnings essentially are integrated and do not stand out with the rest of the cigarette package.\nHowever, this is subject to change as the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 requires color graphics with supplemental text that depicts the negative consequences of smoking to cover 50% of the front and rear of each pack. The nine new graphic warning labels were announced by the FDA in June 2011 and were required to appear on packaging by September 2012, though this was delayed by legal challenges.\nIn August 2011, five tobacco companies filed a lawsuit against the FDA in an effort to reverse the new warning mandate. Tobacco companies claimed that being required to promote government anti-smoking campaigns by placing the new warnings on packaging violates the companies' free speech rights. Additionally, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard, Commonwealth Brands Inc., Liggett Group LLC and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company Inc. claimed that the graphic labels are an unconstitutional way of forcing tobacco companies to engage in anti-smoking advocacy on the government's behalf. A First Amendment lawyer, Floyd Abrams, represented the tobacco companies in the case, contending that requiring graphic warning labels on a lawful product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. The Association of National Advertisers and the American Advertising Federation also filed a brief in the suit, arguing that the labels infringe on commercial free speech and could lead to further government intrusion if left unchallenged.\nOn 29 February 2012, US District Judge Richard Leon ruled that the labels violate the right to free speech in the First Amendment. However, the following month the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the majority of the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, including the part requiring graphic warning labels. In April 2013 the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal to this ruling, allowing the new labels to stand. As the original ruling against the FDA images was not actually reversed, the FDA will again need to go through the process of developing the new warning labels, and the timetable and final product remain unknown. Additionally, rulings of the 6th Circuit are precedential only in the states comprising the 6th Circuit, i.e., Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee.\nIn March 2020, the FDA approved a set of 11 new graphic warning labels with images for cigarette packaging, with a deadline of compliance being set to June 18, 2021. The mandate would have required packaging to cover the top 50% of the front and rear panels of packages, as well as at least 20% of the top. Tobacco manufacturers R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris USA, ITG Brands LLC and Liggett Group LLC filed a joint motion requesting a preliminary injunction on implementing the labels and a ruling to prohibit enforcement in April 2020. They argued that the new packaging would have been a violation of the First Amendment. In December 2022, U.S. district judge J. Campbell Barker of the Eastern District of Texas ordered the new guidelines to be vacated, arguing the multiple interpretation of images cannot prove neutrality. The deadline was pushed to November 6, 2023. The decision was later appealed and overturned by a U.S. Appeals court who ruled unanimously that the warnings were \"factual and uncontroversial\" and thus was not in violation of the First Amendment. The decision was later appealed again to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, the Court declined to hear the case, thus making the new packaging legal. In September 2024, the FDA announced that enforcement of the new packaging would begin on December 12, 2025.\nCigars\n* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Cancers of the Mouth And Throat, Even If You Do Not Inhale.\n* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigars Are Not A Safe Alternative To Cigarettes.\n* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Smoke Increases The Risk of Lung Cancer And Heart Disease, Even in Nonsmokers.\n* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Lung Cancer And Heart Disease.\n* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Use Increases The Risk of Infertility, Stillbirth, And Low Birth Weight.\n* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: This Product Contains/Produces Chemicals Known to the State of California To Cause Cancer, And Birth Defects Or Other Reproductive Harm.\nStronger warning labels started to appear in May 2010, but are yet to be officially implemented.\nSmokeless tobacco\nwith a warning label]]\nproducts sold in the United States]]\nEffective June 2010, the following labels began to appear on smokeless tobacco products (most of which are chewing tobacco) and their advertisements.\n* Warning: This product can cause mouth cancer.\n* Warning: This product can cause gum disease and tooth loss.\n* Warning: This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes.\n* Warning: Smokeless tobacco is addictive.\nThese warnings are required to comprise 30% of two principal display panels on the packaging; on advertisements, the health warnings must constitute 20% of the total area.\nVenezuela\nIn 1978, Venezuela began printing a warning in small type along one of the sides of cigarette packs: \"\" (Warning: \"It has been determined that cigarette smoking is harmful to health\" (in brackets) – Cigarette Tax Law).\nOn 24 March 2005, as part of the \"Venezuela 100% libre de humo\" (100% smoke-free Venezuela) campaign initiated by Hugo Chávez, another warning similar to that of Brazil was introduced: \"Este producto contiene alquitrán, nicotina y monóxido de carbono, los cuales son cancerígenos y tóxicos. No existen niveles seguros para el consumo de estas sustancias\" (\"This product contains tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide, which are carcinogenic and toxic. There are no safe levels for consumption of these substances\"). The 1978 warning was not removed, so cigarette packs contains both warnings, one on each side, since then. In addition, one of the following warnings with images is randomly printed, occupying 100% of the back of the pack (40% for the text warning and 60% for the image):\n*  (This product is hazardous to your health and is addictive)\n*  (Smoking causes bad breath, tooth decay and mouth cancer)\n*  (Smoking causes lung cancer, coughing, pulmonar emphysema and chronic bronchitis).
