The winner receives the Bogs Adornado Trophy, which is named since 2010 in honor of William \"Bogs\" Adornado, a multiple time PBA most valuable player awardee who won his third MVP trophy in 1981 coming from a career-threatening knee injury in 1976 that forced him on the sidelines for two years. Unlike the traditional player awards, which is given by the league, this citation is awarded by the PBA Press Corps.\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 21 individuals. Brandon Ganuelas-Rosser of TNT Tropang 5G will be honored by the PBA Press Corps (PBAPC) as the winner of the Bogs Adornado Comeback Player of the Year award.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#CFECEC; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| ^\n|Denotes player who is still active in the PBA\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| *\n|Inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player has received the award\n|-\n|Team (X)\n|Denotes the number of times a player from this team has won\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Season (sortable), Coach (sortable), Nationality (sortable), Team (sortable)width=640px\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Season\n!scope=\"col\"| Player\n!scope=\"col\"| Position\n!scope=\"col\"| Country of birth\n!scope=\"col\"| Team\n!scope=\"col\" class=unsortable| Ref.\n|-\n|\n|\n| Shooting guard / Small forward\n|\n| Sta.
