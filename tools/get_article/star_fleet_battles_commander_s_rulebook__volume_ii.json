Sheeley commented that \"If you want to keep up with the latest rules, to complete your Volume I or to replace your worn-out expansions cheaply, then Volume II'' is worth its price.  But I must warn you that you can have as much fun with less outlay with just the old rules and expansions.\"\nReferences"
