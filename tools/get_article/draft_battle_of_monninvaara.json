The battle was fought between Swedish and Russian forces on 31 July 1808 at Mönninvaara.\nBackground\nIn North Karelia real hostilities began only in the summer of 1808. A Russian detachment under the command of Major General Alexeyev attempting to march through Pälkjärvi  to bypass Johan August Sandels and his troops in . Olli Tiainen  gathered up all the people around Pielisjärvi and in boats the peasants rowed to the south of the lake, after which they grouped up at Ahvenus on 30 July and then went to Mönninvaara to meet the Russian advance. The vulnerable guard that was stationed in Mönninvaara quickly fled. However, the Russians returned at sunrise the following day, they were now led by Major Scheene and were 200 men strong.\nBattle\nOlli Tiainen  had scattered his men in the rye fields and in the small forests on both sides of the road, and the peasants, aiming steadily, cut down one by one the Russian dragoons who could not get out of the road. Finally, it is true, the Russians reached the open field, but even there they suffered from the peasants' fire and considered it necessary to withdraw, after previously setting fire to the farm.\nReferences"
