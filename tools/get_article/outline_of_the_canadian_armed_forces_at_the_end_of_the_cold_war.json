It is intended to convey the connections and relationships between units and formations.\nFollowing the 1967 Canadian Forces Reorganization Act the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force were amalgamated in 1968 as the Canadian Armed Forces. Since then the Chief of Defence Staff is directly responsible for all services and commands of the Canadian Armed Forces and advises the Canadian Government in all military matters. Policy is developed in the Armed Forces Council, which is made up of the commanders of the functional commands.\nIn 1989 the Canadian Armed Forces had 84,600 active personnel, 7,800 of which were female, and 21,300 reserve personnel, 4,200 of which were female. Around three quarters of all military occupation were open to women in 1989 and the government actively pursued a policy to open more occupations to women. The 1987 Defence White Paper \"Challenge and Commitment\" called for an expansion of the reserve forces to approximately 90,000 troops, however with the end of the Cold War this plan was shelved.\nThe article is based on the Canadian government's 1987 White Paper \"A Defence Policy for Canada\" ([http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/429765/publication.html Link]), which was published at the end of 1987. The White Paper served as basis for the overall structure and the equipment numbers. The article was then expanded with information from the Canadian Armed Forces Annual Historical Reports, which provided a complete listing of all units in existence in 1989. Additional information came from the linked Wikipedia articles, a German brochure about the Canadian Forces based in Germany ([http://www.relikte.com/_basis/docs/cfe-1.pdf Link]) and the current Canadian Armed Forces website and the unit histories listed there.\nNational Defence Headquarters\n* National Defence Headquarters, in Ottawa\n** Communications Security Establishment, in Ottawa,

Canadian Forces Europe. Mobile Command's major formations were two brigade groups and an ad hoc special service force. Recognisably an army formation but not under Mobile Command, 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group was located in West Germany under the control of 1 Canadian Division (Forward) and Canadian Forces Europe. Mobile Command also commanded 106 major and 25 minor reserve units of the Canadian Militia. Active forces amounted to 22,500 troops with 15,500 reserve forces.\nIn case of war men Air Command's Air Transport Group would have flown about 1,400 men from 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group to Germany to bring 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group up to wartime strength, while 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group would have been shipped over the Atlantic as reinforcements for 1 Canadian Division (Forward). Special Service Force would have contributed a battalion group centered around 1st Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment to NATO's Allied Mobile Force (Land) (AMF(L)). The Airborne Regiment was destined for defence operations in Canada.\nin 1983.]]\nmain battle tank.]]\n* Canadian Forces Mobile Command, at CFB St. Hubert\n** CFB Shilo\n*** Royal Canadian Artillery Battle School\n** CFB Gagetown\n*** Combat Training Centre\n**** Armour School, 37x Leopard C1\n**** Field Artillery School\n**** Infantry School\n*** Army Meteorological Centre\n*** 22 Field Squadron (Canadian Military Engineers)\n** CFB Suffield training base\n** CFB Wainwright training base\n** CFB Edmonton (Griesbach)\n*** Canadian Airborne Centre\n** CFB Chatham (Air Command Base)\n*** Air Defence Artillery School\n** Canadian Land Force Command and Staff College, at CFB Kingston\n1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group\n* 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, at CFB Calgary\n** 1 CMBG Headquarters & Signal Squadron\n** Lord Strathcona's Horse\n** 1st Btn, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry\n** 2nd Btn, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry\n** 3rd Btn, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry\n** 3rd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery\n** 1st Combat Engineer Regiment\n** supported by 408th Tactical Helicopter Squadron part of 10 Tactical Air Group of Air Command\n** 1 Service Battalion\n** Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Battle School\n** 1 Field Ambulance\n** 1 Military Police Platoon\n5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group\n* 5 Groupe-brigade mécanisé du Canada, at CFB Valcartier\n** 5e GBMC Quartier général et escadron de transmissions\n** 12e Régiment blindé du Canada\n** 2nd Btn, Royal Canadian Regiment\n** 2e Btn, Royal 22e Régiment\n** 3e Btn, Royal 22e Regiment\n** 5e Régiment d'artillerie légère du Canada\n** 5e Régiment du génie de combat\n** supported by 430e Escadron tactique d'hélicoptères part of 10 Tactical Air Group of Air Command\n** 5 Bataillon des services\n** Royal 22e Régiment École de combat\n** 5e Ambulance de campagne\n** 5 Military Police Platoon\nSpecial Service Force\n* Special Service Force, at CFB Petawawa\n** Special Service Force Headquarters and Signal Squadron\n** Royal Canadian Dragoons\n** Airborne Regiment\n*** Airborne Headquarters and Signal Squadron\n*** 1er Commando Aéroporte, associated with Royal 22e Régiment\n*** 2nd Airborne Commando, associated with Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry\n*** 3rd Airborne Commando, associated with Royal Canadian Regiment\n*** 4th Airborne Commando (Reserve, formed from a company headquarters and 2x platoons from Queen's Own Rifles of Canada and 1x platoon from Loyal Edmonton Regiment)\n*** 5th Airborne Commando (Reserve, formed from a company headquarters and 2x platoons from Le Régiment du Saguenay and 1x platoon from Royal Westminster Regiment)\n*** Airborne Service Commando (providing combat service support)\n** 1st Btn, Royal Canadian Regiment, at CFB London\n** 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, E Battery airborne qualified, 24x 105mm M 56 pack howitzers\n** 2 Combat Engineer Regiment, provides one airborne troop\n** supported by 427th Tactical Helicopter Squadron part of 10 Tactical Air Group of Air Command\n** 2 Service Battalion\n** Royal Canadian Regiment Battle School\n** Militia Training and Support Centre\n** 119 Air Defense Battery, Air Defense Anti-Tank Systems\n** 2 Military Police Platoon\nMilitia\nThe Militia was the primary reserve of Mobile Command and headquartered in Ottawa. Maritime and air reserve formations were part of Maritime Command, respectively Air Command, while communication reserve units were part of the Canadian Forces Communication Command. In wartime the Militia would provide ground units for defence operations in Canada and elsewhere in North America, as well as replacements for the Canadian land force units fighting in the European war theatre. The Militia would also provide lightly armed guards to protect military vital points, and make major contributions to the logistic and medical organizations required to support Canadian Forces overseas. In total the militia fielded 106 major and 25 minor units with 15,500 men. Major units were regiments or battalions, although they seldom exceeded the strength of a company, while minor units were independent artillery batteries, and engineer squadrons. The militia was organized in five militias areas, which were subdivided into militia districts.\nIn case of war the Militia Areas would have become division commands with the responsibility to conduct all military ground operations in their area. In 1989 the Militia consisted of the following units:\nPacific Militia Area\n* Pacific Militia Area, in Vancouver covering British Columbia\n** Victoria Militia District, in Victoria (Merged with the

It provided combat-ready air forces for the surveillance and control over Canadian airspace and for the defence of North America. It also provided air groups for other commands:\n* Maritime Air Group provided Maritime Command with anti-submarine helicopters and airplanes\n* 10 Tactical Air Group provided Force Mobile Command with tactical helicopters\n* 1 Canadian Air Division Canada's aerial contribution to NATO's aerial defense\nThe other air groups of Air Command remained under its operational control, however in case of war two of Fighter Group's fighter squadrons were assigned as reinforcement to 1 Air Division in Germany, while its other two fighter squadrons were assigned as air defence assets to the Canadian NORAD Region. Air Command fielded only two wings: 3 and 4 Wing, as part of 1 Air Division, to fulfill NATO operational requirements. All other units fell under operational control of the bases they operated from. A key unit of Air Command was 437 Transport Squadron, which in case of crisis would have flown Canadian reinforcements from 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group to Germany to augment the strength of 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. Together with the US Air Force Air Command operated the Distant Early Warning Line of radar stations on the edge of Canada's arctic North. Beginning in 1988 the Distant Early Warning Line was upgraded with more powerful radars and automated to reduce personnel requirements.\n* Headquarters Canadian Forces Air Command, at CFB Winnipeg\n** CFB Penhold\n*** Canadian Forces School of Air Reserve Training\n*** Canadian Forces Junior Leader School\n** CFB Summerside\n*** Canadian Forces Junior Leader School\n** CFB Edmonton\n*** Canadian Forces School of Aeromedical Training\n*** Canadian Forces Survival Training School\n*** Canadian Forces School of Traffic and Movements\n** CFB Borden (Canadian Forces Training System Base)\n*** Air Command Academy\n*** Canadian Forces Aircrew Selection Centre\n*** Canadian Forces School of Aerospace Technology and Engineering\n** CFB North Bay\n*** Air Weapons Control and Countermeasures School\n*** Air Force Indoctrination School\nFighter Group/Canadian NORAD Region\nas part of NORAD's radar array as envisioned by Canada and the US in 1987]]\ntakes off]]\nlanding.]]\nat CFB St. Hubert.]]\nAfter the United States and Canada signed the North American Air Defence Modernization Agreement during the Shamrock Summit on 18 March 1985 Canada's air defence was undergoing a major restructuring: in 1987 Fighter Group was merged Canadian NORAD Region to create a unified air defence command for Canada. In the same year Canada began to replace the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW) radar sites across the Canadian Arctic with the more modern North Warning System (NWS) radars.\nNWS stretched from Alaska across the Canadian Arctic at approximately the 70th parallel and extended down the Canadian East Coast to Labrador. Unlike the manned DEW radars the NWS radars consisted of minimally manned long-range radars and unmanned short-range gap-filler radars. Therefore, Canada began to disband its 19 radar squadrons, with only six being left by 1989, four of which were coastal radars: three on the East Coast and one on the West Coast. The original NWS plan called for the installation of a further four coastal radars along the Canadian West Coast and Southeast Alaska.\n* Fighter Group/Canadian NORAD Region at CFB North Bay under

It developed, trained and equipped Canada's naval forces. In wartime operational command would have been exerted by Commander Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and Commander Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) respectively. Commander of Maritime Forces Atlantic doubled-hatted as commander of NATO's Canadian Atlantic Sub-Area (CANLANT) command. CANLANT was an area command of Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) and responsible to keep the Labrador Sea free from Soviet ships and submarines. As Soviet submarines passing under the ice of the Arctic Ocean and through the many channels of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago to reach the North Atlantic were seen as the biggest threat Canada's fleet fielded exclusively ships specialized in the anti-submarine role. Together with the US Navy Maritime Command operated a series the SOSUS underwater listening posts on the Atlantic Ocean's seabed to observe Soviet submarine operations in the Atlantic.\nAir Command provided Maritime Command with a group of anti-submarine planes and helicopters. Maritime Command ships participated every year in NATO's Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT). After having built no new ships since 1973 Maritime Command began an ambitious construction program for 12 new Halifax-class frigates in 1987, the first of which began to enter service in 1992 and replaced all major surface combatants safe for the Iroquois-class destroyers.\n]]\n* Canadian Forces Maritime Command (MARCOM), at CFB Halifax\n** Canadian Forces Base St. John's\n** Naval Station Argentia, joint Canadian-American SOSUS base\n** Canadian Forces Station Shelburne, Canadian SOSUS base\n** Canadian Forces Station Bermuda\n** Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental and Test Ranges, in Nanoose Bay\nMaritime Forces Atlantic\n* Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT), at CFB Halifax\n** Canadian Forces Base Halifax\n*** First Canadian Destroyer Squadron (CANDESRON 1):\n**** :\n**** : , , , ,\n*** Fifth Canadian Destroyer Squadron (CANDESRON 5):\n**** : , ,\n**** : ,\n*** First Canadian Submarine Squadron (CANSUBRON 1):\n**** : , ,\n*** Reserve Training Unit Atlantic:\n****  boom defence vessels: ,\n*** HMCS Cormorant (ASL 20), diving support vessel\n*** HMCS Quest, oceanographic research/acoustic vessel\n***  replenishment oiler: ,\n***  minesweeper: ,\n***  icebreaker:\n***  fireboat:\n*** : , ,\n***  tugboat: , ,\n** Fleet Diving Unit (Atlantic)\n** Acoustic Data Analysis Centre (Atlantic)\n** Canadian Forces Maritime Warfare Centre\n** Canadian Forces Fleet School Halifax\n** Meteorological and Oceanographic Centre Halifax\n** Queen's Harbour Master Halifax\n** Fleet Maintenance Group Atlantic\n*** Canadian Forces Ship Repair Unit (Atlantic)\n*** Naval Engineering Unit (Atlantic), CFB Halifax\nMaritime Forces Pacific\nExercise FLEETEX '83 near the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.]]\n* Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC), CFB Esquimalt\n** Canadian Forces Base Esquimalt\n*** Second Canadian Destroyer Squadron (CANDESRON 2):\n**** :\n**** : , ,\n*** Fourth Canadian Destroyer Squadron (CANDESRON 4):\n**** : , , ,\n*** Training Group Pacific:\n****  boom defence vessels: , ,\n**** Bay-class patrol boats: , , , , ,\n***  oceanographic research vessel:\n*** , replenishment oiler\n***  tugboat\n*** :\n*** : ,\n***  tugboat: ,\n*** , sail training vessel\n** Fleet Diving Unit (Pacific)\n** Canadian Forces Fleet School Esquimalt\n** Meteorological and Oceanographic Centre Esquimalt\n** Queen's Harbour Master Esquimalt\n** HMCS Venture, the Naval Officers Training Centre\n** Fleet Maintenance Group Pacific\n*** Canadian Forces Ship Repair Unit (Pacific)\n*** Naval Engineering Unit (Pacific), CFB Esquimalt\nNaval Reserve\nThe Naval Reserve consisted of 22 divisions in cities across Canada.

It operated and maintained several data and voice communication networks. With an active force of 3,300 troops and 1,570 reservists Communication Command was the smallest of the armed forces commands.\nCommunication Command provided signal squadrons to the three brigades and Special Service Force of Mobile Command, as well signal support for Air Command bases. It also operated the Canadian contribution to the Five Eyes ECHELON signals intelligence network. However the Communications Security Establishment, which analysed intercepted material, was not part of Communication Command. The Canadian Government's Emergency Government Headquarters were also managed by Communication Command. Communication reserve units were grouped in six regional communication groups, which also contained active units based in the same region.\nCommunication Command Structure\n* Communication Command\n** Canadian Forces School of Communications and Electronics, at CFB Kingston\n** Canadian Forces Data Centre, at CFB Borden\n** Canadian Forces Data Centre, at CFB Ottawa\n** Communications Group Europe, at CFB Lahr, supporting Canadian Forces Europe\n*** Communications Squadron Lahr\n*** Communications Squadron Baden-Söllingen\n** 1st Canadian Division Headquarters and Signal Regiment (Main), supporting 1st Canadian Division\n** 1 CMBG Headquarters & Signal Squadron, at CFB Calgary, supporting 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group\n** 4 CMBG Headquarters & Signal Squadron, at CFB Lahr, supporting 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group\n** 5 CMBG Headquarters & Signal Squadron, at CFB Valcartier, supporting 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group\n** Special Service Force Headquarters & Signal Squadron, at CFB Valcartier, supporting Special Service Force\n** CFS Carp (Emergency Government Headquarters)\n*** CFS Carp Almonte Detachment\n*** CFS Carp Dunrobin Detachment\n*** CFS Carp Richardson Detachment\n** 70 Communication Group, at CFB Toronto\n*** 701 Communication Squadron, at CFS Carp\n*** 702 Communication Squadron, at CFB Petawawa\n*** 704 Communication Squadron, at CFB Rockcliffe\n*** 706 Communication Squadron, at CFB Borden\n**** Detachment CFB Toronto\n**** Detachment CFB London\n*** 707 Communication Squadron, at CFB North Bay\n*** 708 Communication Squadron, at CFB Trenton\n**** Detachment CFB Kingston\n** 71e Groupe des communications, at CFB Montreal\n*** 711 Escadron des communications, at CFB Valcartier\n**** Détachement CFB Bagotville\n**** Détachement CFS Moisie\n**** Détachement CFS Mont Apica\n*** 715 Escadron des communications, at CFB Saint-Jean\n**** Détachement CFS Frobisher Bay\n** 72 Communication Group, at CFB Halifax\n*** 720 Communication Squadron, at CFS Debert\n**** Detachment CFB Chatham\n**** Detachment CFB Summerside\n*** 724 Communication Squadron, at CFB Gagetown\n**** Detachment CFB Moncton\n*** 726 Communication Squadron, at CFB Halifax\n**** Detachment CFS Barrington\n**** Detachment CFB Cornwallis\n**** Detachment CFB Greenwood\n**** Detachment CFB Shearwater\n**** Detachment CFS Sydney\n*** 727 Communication Squadron, at CFB St. John's\n**** Detachment CFB Gander\n**** Detachment CFB Goose Bay\n** 73 Communication Group, at CFB Winnipeg\n*** 731 Communication Squadron, at CFB Shilo\n**** Detachment Regina\n**** Detachment CFB Moose Jaw\n*** 733 Communication Squadron, at CFB Winnipeg\n**** Detachment CFS Churchill\n**** Detachment CFS Gypsumville\n** 74 Communication Group, in Vancouver\n*** 740 Communication Squadron, at CFB Esquimalt\n**** Detachment CFB Comox\n**** Detachment CFB Chilliwack\n**** Detachment CFS Holberg\n*** 742 Communication Squadron, at CFB Edmonton\n**** Detachment CFB Cold Lake\n**** Detachment CFB Wainwright\n**** Detachment CFS Yellowknife\n**** Detachment CFS Whitehorse\n*** 743 Communication Squadron, at CFB Penhold\n**** Detachment CFB Suffield\n**** Detachment CFB Calgary\n*** 747 Communication Squadron\n** 76 Communication Group, in Ottawa\n*** 764 Communication Squadron, at CFB Ottawa\n*** Canadian Forces Cryptographic Maintenance Unit\n*** Canadian National Distributing Authority\n*** 1 Line Troop\nSupplementary Radio System\n* Supplementary Radio System, at CFB Kingston (Canadian contribution to the Five Eyes ECHELON SIGINT network)\n** 2 Electronic Warfare Squadron, at CFB Kingston\n** 770 Communication Research Squadron, at CFB Gander\n** 771 Communication Research Squadron, at CFB Ottawa\n** CFS Alert\n** CFS Bermuda\n** CFS Leitrim\n** CFS Masset\n** Detachment at Fort George G.
