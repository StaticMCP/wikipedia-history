Created in 2007, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 19,350 people.\nThe ward has produced strong results for both the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Labour. Initially, the SNP held half the seats in the ward before swinging towards Labour which has held half the seats since 2012.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Clydesdale West was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards. It contained part of the former Clyde Valley and Forth wards as well as all of the former Carluke/Crawforddyke, Carluke/Whitehill and Law/Carluke wards. Clydesdale West covers an area in the north of South Lanarkshire next to its boundary with North Lanarkshire Council and takes in a rural area surrounding the town of Carluke including the villages of Braidwood, Crossford and Law. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward's boundaries were not changed.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Ian Gray(SNP)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=6|David Shearer(SNP)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=6|Eileen Logan(Labour)\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Alex Allison(Conservative)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=2|Pat Lee(SNP/Solidarity)\n|rowspan=5; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=5|Lynsey Hamilton(Labour)\n|-\n!2015\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Poppy Corbett(Conservative/Reform UK)\n|-\n!2022\n|-\n!2025\n|style=\"background-color: \" |\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nNotes\nReferences"
