The elections pitted Delaware's two most powerful families, the Republican du Ponts and the Democratic Bayards, against each other.\nIncumbent Democratic senator Josiah O. Wolcott resigned on July 2, 1921, to accept an appointment as Chancellor of Delaware. Governor William D. Denney appointed businessman and Republican National Committeeman T. Coleman du Pont to fill the vacancy until a successor could be duly elected. Democrat Thomas F. Bayard Jr. narrowly won both the special election to complete Wolcott's term and the regularly scheduled election, both held on November 7. Because Bayard won both elections on the same day, he became a two-term senator, with his second term beginning March 4, 1923.\nBayard became the fifth and last member of his dynastic family to ever serve in the U.S. Senate. du Pont would later be elected to Delaware's other Senate seat and served alongside his counterpart Bayard from 1925 to 1928.\nGeneral election\nCandidates\n*Thomas F.
