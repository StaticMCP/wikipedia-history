The name Gambia Underground Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party (GUSRWP) was adopted.  At this time Kukoi Sanyang, a Gambian socialist, returned from abroad and became active in the party.\n1981 coup d'état\nOn 30 July 1981 the party, along with disaffected members of the Gambia Field Force launched an unsuccessful coup against the government. The insurrection was quickly defeated following the military intervention of Senegal; Gibril George was killed, Kukoi Sanyang fled to Guinea-Bissau and the party effectively dissolved.\nReferences"
