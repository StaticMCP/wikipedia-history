However, when in September 1879 the British envoy in Kabul was murdered, the war recommenced. A Kabul Field Force was created, commanded by Major-General Sir Frederick Roberts, which advanced on Kabul. On the evening of 5 October 1879, Roberts reached Charasiab, a small town  south of Kabul, where he camped overnight, awaiting the arrival of his force's baggage. The next morning, 6 October, saw a large force of regular Afghan soldiers, equipped with artillery and reinforced by local tribesmen, on the ridge of the hills ahead. It was led by Nek Mohammed Khan, Governor of Kabul and uncle of former Amir Yakub Khan, who intended to attack the British.\nAttacking first, Roberts' force feinted to the left of the Afghan line, before launching his main attack to the right. The fighting lasted several hours, but eventually the Afghan army was pushed back, and by 3:45 pm the British-led force had opened the route to Kabul. After this, Roberts resumed his advance and occupied Kabul on 13 October.\nBritish casualties amounted to 18 killed and 70 wounded, while Afghans deaths exceeded 300. Twenty Afghan field guns were captured, including an eight-inch brass howitzer previously presented to the Afghan government by the British; as was a large proportion of the small arms and ammunition used during the battle.\nThe British force was equipped with two Gatling guns, with Charasiab the first time these rapid fire guns were used in action.\nThe spelling of the battle varied. The formal dispatch published in The London Gazette stated 'Charasiab', the regiments present received the battle honour 'Charasiah', while General Roberts' memoirs and the clasp authorised for the Afghanistan Medal referred to 'Charasia'.\nOrder of battle\nThe following regiments participated in the battle:\nBritish Army\n* 9th Lancers (1 squadron)\n* Royal Horse Artillery (F/A Brigade)\n* Royal Artillery (G/3 Battery)\n* 67th Foot\n* 72nd Highlanders\n* 92nd Highlanders\nIndian Army\n* 5th Cavalry, Punjab Frontier Force\n* 12th Bengal Cavalry\n* 14th Bengal Lancers\n* 2nd Derajat Mountain Battery\n* Bengal Sappers and Miners\n* 23rd Bengal Native Infantry (Pioneers)\n* 3rd Sikh Infantry\n* 5th Punjabis (Vaughan’s Rifles)\n* 28th Bengal Native Infantry (Punjabis)\n* 5th Gurkha Rifles\nReferences\nExternal links\n* General Robert's dispatch for the Battle of Charasiab\n* [http://www.britishbattles.com/second-afghan-war/charasiab.htm The Battle of Charasiab], ([http://www.britishbattles.com britishbattles.com])"
