Alabama was allotted sixty-seven delegates, thirty-six of which would be divided among the state's seven congressional districts, with twelve being divided among the candidates in proportion to their share of the statewide vote. The remaining delegates went to party leaders and elected officials, or \"superdelegates.\"\nGovernor of Arkansas Bill Clinton won the state by a substantial margin, taking a large majority of both the congressional district delegates and the at-large delegates, picking up thirty-eight in total. Uncommitted delegates won ten seats at the convention. Alabama was part of a six-state sweep by Clinton that enabled him to clinch the Democratic nomination on June 6. Alabama's entire 67-member delegation cast votes for Clinton at the Convention roll call.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable tpl-blanktable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Alabama Democratic presidential primary, 1992\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2 | Candidate\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=2 | Popular vote\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=3 | Delegates\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | #\n!scope=\"col\" | %\n!scope=\"col\" | Pledged\n!scope=\"col\" | Unpledged\n!scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Bill Clinton\n| 307,621 || 68.22% || 38 ||  || 38\n|-'\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jerry Brown\n| 30,626 || 6.79% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Charles Woods\n| 15,247 || 3.38% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Lyndon LaRouche\n| 6,542 || 1.45% || 0 ||  || 0\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Uncommitted\n| 90,863 || 20.15% || 10 ||  || 10\n|-\n!
