The trail network includes  of existing and planned sections, tracing the natural, historical, and cultural features of the Potomac River corridor, the upper Ohio River watershed in Pennsylvania and western Maryland, and a portion of the Rappahannock River watershed in Virginia. The trail is managed by the National Park Service and is one of three National Trails that are official NPS units.\nUnlike many long-distance hiking trails such as the Appalachian Trail, the Potomac Heritage Trail is an informal route with numerous side trails and alternatives, some in parallel on each side of the river. Currently, many of these are separate, connected to the others only by roads. The PHT crosses the Appalachian Trail near Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and is concurrent with the American Discovery Trail along the portion of the C&O Canal Towpath between Oldtown, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.\nInitial sections\nThree substantial sections of the trail were in existence when the Potomac Heritage Trail officially became a National Scenic Trail in 1983. These trails range from hiking-only to multi-use, illustrating the variety of the PHT route.\n*The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath, which runs  along the Maryland side of the Potomac River between Georgetown in Washington, D.C., and Cumberland, Maryland.\n*The Mount Vernon Trail in Virginia, which runs  between Rosslyn and Mount Vernon, parallel to the Potomac River.\n*The Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail, running for  in Pennsylvania between Ohiopyle State Park and the Conemaugh Gorge near Johnstown.\nCompleted and planned sections\nUpon its completion, the Potomac Heritage Trail will consist of the following sections:\n* The  Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail, within Laurel Ridge State Park in Pennsylvania.\n* A  section of the Great Allegheny Passage (GAP), between Cumberland, Maryland and Ohiopyle, Pennsylvania.\n* The  C&O Canal Towpath within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, in Maryland, and Washington, D.C.\n* A  linear park system in Loudoun County, Virginia.\n*  of trails within Riverbend Park, Great Falls Park, and Scott's Run Nature Preserve in Fairfax County, Virginia.\n* Two partially completed routes within the District of Columbia—the  Fort Circle Parks Trail, part of the Civil War Defenses of Washington, and a multi-use route between Georgetown and Oxon Cove Park.\n* The paved shared use  Mount Vernon Trail and a  gravel trail in and around Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia, mostly alongside the George Washington Memorial Parkway.(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (1) (2) (3) (4)\n* The  Alexandria Heritage Trail in Alexandria, Virginia.\n* A  biking trail in Prince George's County, Maryland.\n* A  trail in Piscataway Park in Prince George's County, Maryland.\n* A  route within the Nanjemoy Natural Resource Management Area in Charles County, Maryland.\n* A biking trail in Charles and St. Mary's counties in Maryland.\n* Two  routes in Prince William Forest Park and a partially completed  route, between Leesylvania State Park and Belmont Bay, in Prince William County, Virginia.\n* The Government Island Trail, the planned  Historic Falmouth-Ferry Farm Trail, and the Aquia Creek Water Trail, all in Stafford County, Virginia.\n* The Northern Neck Heritage Trail Bicycling Route Network in Westmoreland, Northumberland, Lancaster, and Richmond counties, all in Virginia.\nReferences\nExternal links\nTrails/Parks of PHNST\n* [http://www.atatrail.org/ Great Allegheny Passage]\n* [http://bikewashington.org/canal/ C&O Canal Bicycling Guide]\n* [http://bikewashington.org/trails/vernon/index.php Mt.
