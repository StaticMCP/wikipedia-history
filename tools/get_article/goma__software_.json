      "text": "# Goma (software)\n\nGoma is an open-source, parallel, and scalable multiphysics software package for modeling and simulation of real-life physical processes, with a basis in computational fluid dynamics for problems with evolving geometry. It solves problems in all branches of mechanics, including fluids, solids, and thermal analysis. Goma uses advanced numerical methods, focusing on the low-speed flow regime with coupled phenomena for manufacturing and performance applications. It also provides a flexible software development environment for specialty physics.\nGoma was created by Sandia National Laboratories and is currently supported by both Sandia and the University of New Mexico.\nCapabilities\nGoma is a finite element program which solves problems from all branches of mechanics, including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, chemical reactions and mass transport, and energy\ntransport.  The conservation principles for momentum, mass, species, and\nenergy, together with material constitutive relations, can be described by partial\ndifferential equations. The equations are made discrete for solution on a digital\ncomputer with the finite element method in space and the finite difference\nmethod in time. The resulting nonlinear, time-dependent, algebraic equations\nare solved with a full Newton-Raphson method. The linearized equations are\nsolved with direct or Krylov-based iterative solvers. The simulations can be\nrun on a single processor or on multiple processors in parallel using domain\ndecomposition, which can greatly speed up engineering analysis.\nExample applications include, but are not limited to, coating and polymer processing flows, super-alloy processing, welding/soldering, electrochemical processes, and solid-network or solution film drying.  A full description of Goma's capabilities can be found in [https://goma.github.io/files/goma-capabilities.pdf Goma's capabilities document].\nGoma is frequently used in conjunction with other software packages.  [https://cubit.sandia.gov/ Cubit] is typically used to generate computational meshes, while ParaView is often used to visualize the simulation results.  Simulation output is generated in the ExodusII file format.\nHistory\nGoma originated in 1994 from an early version of MP_SALSA, a finite element program designed to simulate chemically reacting flows in massively-parallel computing environments. As a point-of-departure, Goma was originally extended and adapted to free and moving boundary problems in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and mass transfer.  Five versions of Goma (1.0 through 5.0) were developed and released by Sandia from 1994 through 2012.  These original versions of Goma were not approved for public release, and were released only internally within the US Government and its contracted industrial and academic partners.\nIn 2013, Sandia released Goma 6.0 as open-source software under the GNU General Public License.  It is hosted by GitHub and contains instructions on downloading additional software packages that are required to build Goma.\nAwards\nGoma 6.0 was awarded a 2014 R&D 100 Award by [http://www.rdmag.com/ R&D Magazine].  This award identifies the open-source release of Goma 6.0 as one of the top 100 technological innovations of 2013.\nPublications\nA user manual for Goma 6.0 has been published openly.  Goma simulations have underpinned at least 14 Sandia technical reports and over 25 journal articles.\nExternal links\n* [https://github.com/goma/goma/ Goma hosted on GitHub]\n* [https://www.gomafem.com/ Goma Website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M4YjDJyUWI R&D 100 award nomination video]\nReferences"
