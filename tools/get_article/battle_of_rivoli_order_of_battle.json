The battle occurred during the fourth Austrian attempt to relieve the Siege of Mantua. After crippling Alvinczi's army on the 14th, Bonaparte left Barthélemy Joubert and Gabriel Rey to finish off the Austrians and raced south with André Masséna to deal with a relief column led by Giovanni di Provera. On 16 January, Masséna, Pierre Augereau, and Jean Sérurier trapped Provera near the Mantua siege lines and forced his surrender.\nFrance\n* Army of Italy: Napoleon Bonaparte (43,610)\n** Division: André Masséna (8,851 including 2 cavalry regiments)\n*** Brigade: Jean-Charles Monnier\n**** 18th Demi-Brigade (1,604)\n**** 32nd Demi-Brigade (1,848)\n*** Brigade: Guillaume Brune\n**** 75th Demi-Brigade (2,373)\n**** 25th Demi-Brigade (1,226)\n*** Brigade: Charles Leclerc\n**** 1st Cavalry Regiment (216)\n**** 15th Dragoon Regiment (203)\n**** 18th Light Infantry Demi-Brigade (1,150)\n*** Artillery: 6 guns\n** Division: Pierre Augereau (8,665 including 4 cavalry regiments)\n*** Brigade: Jean Guieu\n*** Brigade: François Point\n*** Brigade: Jean-Antoine Verdier\n*** Brigade: Frédéric Walther (cavalry)\n** Division: Barthélemy Joubert (10,250 including 1 cavalry regiment)\n*** Brigade: Honoré Vial\n**** 4th Light Infantry Demi-Brigade (792)\n**** 17th Light Infantry Demi-Brigade (784)\n**** 22nd Light Infantry Demi-Brigade (1,332)\n*** Brigade: Claude Lebley\n**** 29th Light Infantry Brigade (1,258)\n**** 33rd Demi-Brigade (1,965)\n**** 85th Demi-Brigade (1,386)\n*** Brigade: Thomas Sandos\n**** 14th Demi-Brigade (1,358)\n**** 39th Demi-Brigade (978)\n**** 22nd Light Cavalry Regiment (205)\n*** Artillery: 12 guns\n** Division: Gabriel Rey (4,156 including 2 cavalry regiments)\n*** Brigade: Antoine Veaux\n**** 8th Dragoon Regiment (207)\n**** 12th Light Infantry Demi-Brigade (529)\n*** Brigade: Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers\n**** 59th Demi-Brigade (2,814)\n**** 11th Light Infantry Demi-Brigade (254)\n*** Brigade: Joachim Murat\n**** Guides Regiment (322)\n*** Artillery: 6 guns\n** Division: Jean Sérurier (10,230 including 2 cavalry regiments)\n*** Alexandre Dumas and Claude Dallemagne each led small divisions under the supervision of Sérurier.
