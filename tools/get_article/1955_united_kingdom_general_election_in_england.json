It was called immediately after Anthony Eden succeeded Sir Winston Churchill as prime minister in order to strengthen the position of the Conservative Party in the Commons where it enjoyed only a slender majority.\n| leader1 = Anthony Eden\n| leader_since1 = 7 April 1955\n| party1 = Conservative Party (UK)\n| leaders_seat1 = Warwick&nbsp;andLeamington\n| last_election1 = 271 seats, 48.8%\n| seats1 = 293\n| seat_change1 = 22\n| popular_vote1 = 11,165,436\n| percentage1 = 50.4%\n| swing1 = 1.6 pp\n| image2 =\n| leader2 = Clement Attlee\n| leader_since2 = 25 October 1935\n| party2 = Labour Party (UK)\n| leaders_seat2 = Walthamstow West\n| last_election2 = 233 seats, 48.8%\n| seats2 = 216\n| seat_change2 = 17\n| popular_vote2 = 10,355,892\n| percentage2 = 46.8%\n| swing2 = 2.0 pp\n| image3 =\n| leader3 = Clement Davies\n| leader_since3 = 2 August 1945\n| party3 = Liberal Party (UK)\n| leaders_seat3 = Montgomeryshire\n| last_election3 = 2 seats, 2.3%\n| seats3 = 2\n| seat_change3 =\n| popular_vote3 = 571,034\n| percentage3 = 2.7%\n| swing3 = 0.4 pp\n}}The Conservative Party recorded a second consecutive victory over the Labour Party. It was the first time since 1935 that the Conservative Party won a greater share of the vote over the Labour Party. It is also to be noted that the 50.4% voteshare recorded by the Conservatives remains the largest share of the vote recorded by any party in a post-war general election. The 46.8% voteshare recorded by the Labour Party in England has been exceeded by the party only once since then- in the 1966 general election.\nIt was also the first of 18 general elections held under the reign of Queen Elizabeth II and the first general election whose television coverage is existent. At the same time, it was the fifth and the last election in which the Labour Party was led by Clement Attlee.\nResult Table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Seats won\n!Net change in seats\n!Total votes\n!Voteshare\n!Change in voteshare\n|-\n|Conservative\n|293\n|22\n|11,165,436\n|50.4%\n|1.6%\n|-\n|Labour\n|216\n|17\n|10,355,892\n|46.8%\n|2.0%\n|-\n|Liberal\n|2\n|\n|571,034\n|2.7%\n|0.4%\n|}\n|57.33}}\n|42.27}}\n|0.39}}}}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Thorpe, Andrew (1997).
