I look forward to visiting Słubice one day to see the monument for myself and perhaps meeting some of those involved in the project.|Jimmy Wales, the co-founder of Wikipedia, on the occasion of the unveiling}}\nSee also\n* 2014 in art\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/First-ever_Wikipedia_Monument_unveiled_in_Poland Press release: First-ever Wikipedia Monument unveiled in Poland], Wikimedia Foundation\n* [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/wikipedia-dc348d035a6544a49f429c89c5052314 3D-Model: Wikipedia Monument] Sketchfab, 3D-Platform\ncategory:Nude sculptures of women"
