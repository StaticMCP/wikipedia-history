The population was 222 at the 2010 census.\nGeography\nQueen Anne is located at  (38.919039, -75.952827).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.\nTuckahoe Creek passes by the town. The likely birthplace of Frederick Douglass is 2–3 miles south, near the banks of the Tuckahoe.\nMaryland Route 404 passes to the north of town. Tuckahoe State Park is a short ride north of MD 404. The border between Talbot County and Queen Anne's County runs through the middle of town.\nHistory\nAccording to the Maryland Municipal League:\n:In the 1850s, the area that is now the town of Queen Anne, was part of a 225-acre farm owned by Jacob Morgan. Initially, the town nucleus was nothing but a 1½-story dwelling, but in 1864 Mr. Morgan built a more substantial place—it was known locally as “the mansion house,” and the locale was known as Morganville.\n:At that time, the Pennsylvania Railroad had been laid as far south as Greensboro and, a little later, to Ridgely and Hillsboro and thence across Tuckahoe Creek. In 1878, the railroad purchased a site for a station across the creek in Queen Anne’s County, and, quite logically, named it Queen Anne when the station was finally put into service about 1882.\nThe train station made Queen Anne a good location for sending agricultural products to large cities. Middlemen would bring milk in cans from local dairy farms to the station. Several houses in town were converted to small hotels to accommodate these people.\nTransportation\nThe primary means of travel to and from Queen Anne is by road. Maryland Route 404 Alternate, Maryland Route 303 and Maryland Route 518 are the state highways directly serving the town. Maryland Route 404 and Maryland Route 309 pass just outside the town corporate limits to the north and west.\nDemographics\n}}\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 222 people, 83 households, and 54 families living in the town.
