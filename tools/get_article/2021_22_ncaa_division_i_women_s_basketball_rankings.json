It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\n|Week2Date = Nov 23\n|Week3Date = Nov 30\n|Week4Date = Dec 7\n|Week5Date = Dec 14\n|Week6Date = Dec 21\n|Week7Date = Dec 28\n|Week8Date = Jan
