Powell is an American operations researcher and academic whose work focuses on stochastic optimization with applications to transportation, logistics, and energy systems modeling.\nHe is Professor Emeritus at Princeton University, having taught there from 1981 to 2020, and was a founding member of Princeton’s Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering.\nHe directed the CASTLE Laboratory in 1990.His work focuses on development of a modeling framework for sequential decision analytics, which has been applied to the design and control of various processes. He was elected to the 2004 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.\nEducation and career\nPowell earned his Bachelor of Science in Engineering from Princeton University in 1977, with a focus on transportation systems. He went on to pursue graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he earned his MSE and Ph.D. at the intersection of transportation and operations research.\nPowell joined Princeton University in 1981, where he spent nearly four decades, initially in Civil Engineering and then as a founding member in 1999 of Operations Research and Financial Engineering.\nHe founded the CASTLE Laboratory (Computational and Stochastic Transportation and Logistics Engineering) in 1990, focusing on computational stochastic optimization arising in freight transportation (trucking and rail) and logistics.\nIn 2011, he also established the Princeton laboratory for Energy Systems Analysis (PENSA), which later merged into CASTLE Labs to broaden its research scope to include energy systems.\nHis later industrial collaborations included projects with Norfolk Southern Railway, UPS, NetJets, Embraer, and the U.S. Air Mobility Command. In the energy sector, Powell worked with PJM Interconnection and PSE&G to apply stochastic optimization methods to energy systems planning, which led to the formalization of a new class of stochastic optimization algorithms called “cost function approximations” based on the idea of parametrically modified deterministic approximations.\nPowell has co-founded three companies over his career. In 1988, he established Princeton Transportation Consulting Group, which was later acquired by Manhattan Associates. In 1995, he co-founded Transport Dynamics.\nHe is also a co-founder of Optimal Dynamics, a technology startup launched in 2017, that licensed one of his software platforms for truckload freight optimization; the company, led by his son Daniel Powell, recently completed its Series C funding round, raising over $90 million.Powell received the Robert Herman Lifetime Achievement Award from the Transportation Science and Logistics Society.\nPowell's work span both theoretical and practical aspects of operations research, with a particular focus on connecting academic insights to real-world industrial applications. His work in educational outreach include creating publicly accessible resources, instructional videos, and textbooks that aim to simplify complex topics in decision analytics.\nHe served on the board of directors of INFORMS, was president of the Society for Transportation Science and Logistics, and chaired the 2016 INFORMS Optimization Society conference. In 1991, he co-founded the TRISTAN (Triennial Symposium on Transportation Analysis) conference, and in 2004, he contributed to the establishment of the INFORMS Impact Prize.\nResearch\nPowell is a researcher in approximate dynamic programming (ADP) and sequential decision analytics, focusing on algorithms and frameworks for high-dimensional stochastic optimization problems.\nHe introduced a unified framework for modeling sequential decision problems and identified four fundamental classes of decision policies that include any method for making decisions over time. These frameworks are detailed in his 2022 book Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization: A unified framework for sequential decisions, which synthesizes 15 subfields under a standard methodology.\nPowell co-developed the knowledge gradient method for sequential learning problems, in collaboration with Peter Frazier. The method has been the subject of multiple dissertations and is described in the book Optimal Learning with Ilya Ryzhov.\nHe contributed to the development of a stochastic optimization model for managing large-scale truckload carrier fleets, in collaboration with Hugo Simao. This model later became the basis for the company Optimal Dynamics, which received the Daniel Wagner Prize. He also led the development of an optimization model for locomotive planning in U.S. freight railroads, implemented in 2008 at Norfolk Southern, where it remained in use as of 2025.\nIn the late 1980s, he developed a load-matching system for truckload trucking, MicroMAP, which used an early form of approximate dynamic programming to estimate the future value of drivers. MicroMAP was marketed by Princeton Transportation Consulting Group and later by Manhattan Associates.\nHonors and awards\n* 2022 Saul Gass Expository Writing Award\n* 2021 The Robert Herman Lifetime Achievement Award\n* 2013 Docteur honoris causa by the University of Quebec at Montreal.\n* Winner, 2009 Daniel H.
