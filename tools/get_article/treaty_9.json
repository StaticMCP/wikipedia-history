It is commonly known as the \"James Bay Treaty,\" since the eastern edge of the treaty territory is the shore of James Bay in Northern Ontario.\nBy the early 1900s, both federal and provincial governments were interested in taking control of lands around the Hudson and James Bay watersheds in northern Ontario, traditionally home to Cree, Oji-Cree, and Ojibwe peoples.\nAfter nearly a year of delay from Ontario, in May 1905, both governments began negotiating the terms of the treaty's written document. Although ratification of the treaty required the agreement of Indigenous peoples living in the territory, none of the Omushkegowuk and the Anishinaabe communities expected to sign were involved in creating the terms of the written document, nor were the terms permitted to change during the treaty expedition.\nOne First Nations community in the bordering Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec is included in this treaty. Further adhesions involving Ojibwe and Swampy Cree communities were signed in 1929 and 1937.\nTimeline\n* 29 June 1905: Duncan C. Scott and Samuel Stewart are appointed as treaty commissioners by the Government of Canada. Daniel G. MacMartin is appointed as commissioner by the province of Ontario. They would jointly conduct signing ceremonies with First Nations communities on a set route through the proposed treaty territory.\n* 3 July 1905: Agreement between province of Ontario and the federal Canadian government in support of Treaty 9.\n* 12 July 1905: Osnaburgh (Mishkeegogamang First Nation) signing\n* 19 July 1905: Fort Hope (Eabametoong First Nation) signing\n* 25 July 1905: Marten Falls (Marten Falls First Nation) signing\n* 3 August 1905: Fort Albany (Fort Albany First Nation) signing\n* 9 August 1905: Moose Factory signing\n* 21 August 1905: New Post (Taykwa Tagamou Nation) signing\n* 7 June 1906: Abitibi (Wahgoshig First Nation) signing\n* 20 June 1906: Matachewan signing\n* 7 July 1906: Mattagami (Mattagami First Nation) signing\n* 16 July 1906: Flying Post (Flying Post First Nation) signing\n* 19 July 1906: Fort Hope (Eabametoong First Nation) signing\n* 25 July 1906: Brunswick House (Brunswick House First Nation) signing\n* 9 August 1906: Long Lake (Long Lake 58 First Nation) signing\n* 5 July 1929: Big Trout Lake (Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation) signing\n* 18 July 1930: Windigo River signing\n* 25 July 1930: Fort Severn (Fort Severn First Nation) signing\n* 28 July 1930: Winisk (Weenusk First Nation) signing\n* 1995: Diaries kept by Daniel G.

MacMartin, treaty commissioner for the Government of Ontario, written more than 100 years ago but rediscovered by historians at Queen's University Archives, supported oral histories passed down by Indigenous Elders that the agreements spoken by commissioners at the treaty signings did not reflect the written document. The unearthing of this additional primary source evidence triggered a legal challenge for mining access on First Nations land. MacMartin's diary suggested \"First Nation leaders may have been misled by government negotiators as they were signing Treaty No. 9, says Murray Klippenstein, legal representative for Mushkegowuk Council.\"\nDocumentary film\nThe James Bay Treaty is the subject of a 2014 documentary film by Alanis Obomsawin, entitled Trick or Treaty?\nSee also\n* Nishnawbe Aski Nation\n* Numbered Treaties\n* Mushkegowuk Council\n* The Canadian Crown and Indigenous peoples of Canada\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://iportal.usask.ca/docs/ICC/treaties/9_eng.pdf Treaty 9]—Complete Treaty 9 Text Reprinted 1964.\n*[https://www.cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1100100028863/1581293189896 Treaty Texts - Treaty No. 9] from the Government of Canada\n**[https://web.archive.org/web/20110613170832/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ai/mr/nr/m-a2005/02690bk-eng.asp Backgrounder on James Bay Treaty 9]\n*[http://pathoftheelders.com On the Path of the Elders]\n*[http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/en/explore/online/jamesbaytreaty/index.aspx The James Bay Treaty (Treaty No. 9) Online Exhibit]"
