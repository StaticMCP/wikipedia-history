On September 12, 1814, Brigadier General John Stricker commanded forces of the Maryland Militia from within the park's borders. Stricker's men fought the invading British forces from behind a fenceline along the monument's eastern edge.\nThe  site opened to the public in 2015. Park features include wetlands, permeable parking and trail surfaces, boardwalks, and wildflower meadows. It is a satellite facility of North Point State Park, managed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://dnr.maryland.gov/publiclands/Pages/central/NorthPointBattlefield.aspx North Point State Battlefield] Maryland Department of Natural Resources"
