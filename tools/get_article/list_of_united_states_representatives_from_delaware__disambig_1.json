Terms began on the subsequent March 4 until 1935, from when they began on January 3.\nDelaware has had only one U.S. representative, except for 10 years between 1813 and 1823, when there was a second U.S. representative. This person was elected statewide, at-large, on the same ballot as the first U.S. representative. The two candidates with the highest number of votes were elected.\nCurrent representative\n* : Sarah McBride (D): (since 2025)\nList of members\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
