Televised by Fox, the ceremony began with a ruse where Homer Simpson appeared in an augmented-reality stage to host the event, before an animated piano dropped from the ceiling to land on The Simpsons''' character. With the event now \"host-less\", Anthony Anderson rushed on stage in a skit where he insisted that \"We're going to go without a host tonight!\" and pushed the first presenter Bryan Cranston to the stage to welcome the audience and introduce a montage of video clips. The ceremony continued in such fashion with only Lennon and montages and clips filling the time between presenters.\nSeveral winners made notable \"statement speeches\" while accepting their awards. After winning the award for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Alex Borstein said:\nThe winner for outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or movie, Patricia Arquette (The Act), in her acceptance speech said \"I'm grateful at 50 to be getting the best parts of my life\" and paid tribute to her sister, Alexis Arquette, who had died in 2016. Michelle Williams, after winning the award for outstanding lead actress in a limited series or movie for Fosse/Verdon, made references to the gender and racial wage gaps in the film industry, as well as the Time's Up movement:\nIn the In Memoriam presentation, a photograph of conductor Leonard Slatkin, who is alive and working in Ireland, was mistakenly used and captioned as André Previn, who died in February 2019.\nCategory and rule changes\nOn April 9, 2019, it was announced that American Horror Story: Apocalypse, the eighth season of the horror anthology series American Horror Story, and the second season of The Sinner would be ineligible for the Limited Series categories unlike their previous seasons, and instead be moved to Drama due to \"continuing story threads, characters and actors reprising those same character roles from previous seasons\", therefore making the series less fit for an anthology format. For similar reasons, the second season of American Vandal was moved from Limited Series to Comedy. None of the shows were nominated.\nCritical reviews and viewership\nThe telecast was watched by 6.9&nbsp;million viewers in the United States, making it the lowest-rated Emmy broadcast in history, amounting to a 32% drop from the 2018 ceremony.\nIn Memoriam\nHalsey sang \"Time After Time\" by Cyndi Lauper and Rob Hyman. The following people were included in the In Memoriam presentation:\n* John Singleton\n* Doris Day\n* Jan-Michael Vincent\n* André Previn\n* Cokie Roberts\n* Sid Sheinberg\n* Gloria Vanderbilt\n* Tony Askins\n* James Frawley\n* Ron Miller\n* Christopher Knopf\n* Steve Golin\n* Cameron Boyce\n* Nancy Wilson\n* Larry Siegel\n* Peggy Lipton\n* John Falsey\n* Kristoff St. John\n* Lou Weiss\n* Sharon Taylor\n* Roy Clark\n* Tony Lynn\n* Eunetta T.
