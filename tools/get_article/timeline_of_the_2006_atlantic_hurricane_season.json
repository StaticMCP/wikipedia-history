The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2006, and ended on November&nbsp;30, 2006. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis occurs in the Atlantic Ocean. The first storm to form in 2006 was Tropical Storm Alberto on June 10;|group=\"nb\"}} the last, Hurricane Isaac, dissipated on October 2.\nThe season saw near average activity in terms of the overall number of cyclones.|group=\"nb\"}} There were ten named storms in the Atlantic basin in 2006, of which five became hurricanes with two intensifying further into major hurricanes.) or higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson wind speed scale are considered major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} It was the first season since the 2001 season in which no hurricanes made landfall in the United States, and the first since the 1994 season that no tropical cyclones formed during October; activity was slowed by a rapidly forming El Niño event in 2006, the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic, and the steady presence of a robust secondary high-pressure area to the Azores High centered on Bermuda.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) are: Greenwich, Cape Verde, Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline of storms\nJune\nTropical Storm Alberto\n;June 1\n*The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\n;June 10\n*1 a.m. CDT (0600 UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One forms  south of the western tip of Cuba.\n*7 p.m. CDT (0000 UTC June 11)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One strengthens into Tropical Storm Alberto.\n;June 13\n*12:30&nbsp;p.m. EDT (1630 UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Alberto makes landfall near Adams Beach, Florida, with  winds.\n;June 14\n*2 a.m. EDT (0600 UTC)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Alberto weakens into a tropical depression.\n*8 a.m. EDT (1200 UTC)&nbsp;– The remnants of Alberto become extratropical.\nJuly\n;July 17\n*0600 UTC&nbsp;– A previously extratropical low-pressure area becomes a tropical depression about  southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts.
