Keyes, was born August 28, 1843, at Fort Moultrie Army Base in Charleston, South Carolina. He studied at Yale College, 1859–1863, graduating with a master's degree, and briefly served as his father's aide-de-camp as a captain in the United States Army. After graduating from Medical College of the New York University, he entered into practice with one of his teachers, William Holme Van Buren. In 1870 he himself began lecturing on dermatology and genitourinary surgery at Bellevue Hospital Medical College.\nFamily\nKeyes married Sarah Loughborough on April 26, 1870. From 1881 to 1907 they lived at 930 Fifth Avenue, which they had decorated by John F. Douthitt and where Sarah hosted a salon.\nTheir son, Edward Loughborough Keyes, was like his father a noted urologist.\nEdward Lawrence Keyes died from pneumonia at his home in New York on January 24, 1924. He was buried at Gate of Heaven Cemetery.\nPublications\n*with William H.
