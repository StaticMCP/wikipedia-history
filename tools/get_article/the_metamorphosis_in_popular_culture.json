Presenting himself as \"Dr. Josef Gregor,\" an entomologist, Skaggs held a press conference where he claimed to have developed a strain of cockroaches immune to toxins and radiation. He also asserted that he had extracted a hormone from the roaches that could cure common ailments and provide immunity to nuclear radiation. The event was attended by journalists, including representatives from United Press International (UPI), and received widespread media coverage, including a UPI story that ran in numerous newspapers across the United States. Skaggs later appeared live on WNBC-TV’s Live at Five and shared additional details about the supposed discovery. The hoax drew on references to Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis, including the protagonist Gregor Samsa, which went unnoticed by reporters at the time. Months later, in an interview with People Magazine (September 21, 1981), Skaggs revealed the hoax, highlighting his intent to critique media gullibility and encourage critical thinking about quick-fix solutions. The revelation prompted further media coverage, including a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal.\nReferences"
