A variety of other collaborators, including Sam Cino, Al Okada, Gary Dutch, Geoff Walton, Steve Clarkson, Mike Armstrong, Nathan Lawr, Don Pyle, and Michelle McAdorey, have contributed to individual albums.\nHistory\nIn 1993, the band, named for a special kind of toy marble, released its self-titled album, which fused progressive rock with dubstep sampling. In 1994, the band was signed to the EMI label, and released the followup album Project Twinkle. The album received a Juno Award nomination for Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1995.\nFollowing Project Twinkle, the band also performed a number of improvisational shows under the pseudonym Junior Relaxer, which would become the title of their third album in 1997.

In the fall of 2012, the band re-released Project Twinkle on Pheromone Recordings and performed the album live in its entirety at the Horseshoe Tavern and at Van Gogh's Ear in Guelph as part of the Stay Out Of The Mall XI festival.\nOn December 12, 2013, King Cobb Steelie released Goodbye Arcadia, a four-track EP.
