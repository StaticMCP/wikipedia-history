The insurgency started after the 1967 Naxalbari uprising and the subsequent split of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leading to the creation of a Marxist–Leninist faction. The faction splintered into various groups supportive of Maoist ideology, claiming to fight a rural rebellion and people's war against the government.\nThe armed wing of the Maoists is called the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army. They have conducted multiple attacks on the security forces and government workers. The influence zone of the Naxalites is called the red corridor, which consists of about 25 districts in Central and East India in 2021. The insurgency reached its peak in the late 2000s with almost 180 affected districts and has been on the decline since then due to the counter-insurgency actions and development plans formulated by the Government. Naxalite organisations and groups have been declared as terrorist organisations under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of India (1967).\n1960s-1970s\n* Early 1967: A faction of the Communist Party led by Charu Majumdar called the \"Siliguri group\", gave calls for the initiation of armed struggle in the Naxalbari region in West Bengal and many peasant cells were created in response.\n* 3 March 1967: A few peasant workers seized a plot of land from its jotedar (owner) and harvested the crops.\n* 18 May 1967: The Siliguri Kishan Sabha, of which Jangal Santhal was the president, declared their support for the movement initiated by Kanu Sanyal, and their readiness to adopt armed struggle to redistribute land to the landless.\n* 25 May 1967: In Naxalbari, a sharecropper of tribal background, who had been given land by the courts under the tenancy laws, was attacked by the previous landlord's men.
