Despite that it was cited by many, the quality of this dataset remains not optimal. An examination of the April 2024 release showed that many entries suffer from incomplete information (e.g. imprecise description, missing geolocation, missing date of damage, missing multilingual title/description). Among the 351 damaged cultural properties they examined, only 211 met their criteria and were annotated and were included in their dataset.Wang, S., Berezko, O., Kultorp, E., Stefashko, M., Fedak, S., & Denyshchuk, O. (2024). Annotated Dataset of Damaged Cultural Sites and Infrastructures during the Russian invasion of Ukraine [Data set].

Zenodo.\nBoth Ukraine and Russia have signed the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (the 1954 Hague Convention), which was drafted to safeguard cultural heritage during periods of armed conflicts.
