The station serves multiple notable Philadelphia landmarks, including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the National Constitution Center, the National Museum of American Jewish History, and the Philadelphia Bourse.\nThe station originally opened as 5th Street station and was renamed by SEPTA on June 29, 2016.\nThe station is also served by numerous SEPTA bus routes, the , and 48.\nHistory\n20th century\nThe station opened August 3, 1908 as part of the first extension of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company's Market Street Subway. The line had originally opened a year earlier between 69th Street and 15th Street station.\nThe station was expanded in the 1950s along with the creation of the Independence Mall, and was last rehabilitated in 1974 in preparation for the United States Bicentennial. Elevators were installed in 2010, making the station accessible under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n21st century\nIn July 2016, the city approved designs to rehabilitate the station, including new signage and lighting, rebuilt staircases and headhouses, as well as new artwork. The project began fall 2018 and it is scheduled for completion in fall 2020, coming in at an estimated total cost of $19.5 million. During the construction project, trains were bypassing the station.\nStation layout\nThe station has two side platforms with separate fare control on either side. 5th Street is the only station on the line in Center City that does not have a mezzanine crossover between the two platforms.\nImage gallery\nFile:5th Street Station septa.jpg|5th Street entrance\nFile:mfl5thst-elevator.jpg|5th Street elevator\nFile:5th Street (SEPTA station) and the old KYW (AM)-KYW-TV building.jpg|The now-demolished KYW AM Radio & TV building, with a subway entrance hidden in the foreground.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://world.nycsubway.org/perl/showpix?nsta=53128 5th Street-Independence Station images (World-NYCSubway.org)]\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=39.950428,-75.148941&spn=0.00389,0.013679&z=17&layer=c&cbll=39.950347,-75.148964&panoid=AN7GYuMt2yA36RKAIuN9tQ&cbp=12,246.03,,0,5.49 5th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View]"
