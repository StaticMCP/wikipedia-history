The awards are voted by a panel of industry personnel and critics and membership of the panel has changes over time.\nIn 2012 Silver and Gold Matilda statuettes were introduced, awarded for either a single work or a body of work over time. There were five Gold Awards each year but in 2015 only one was awarded as a result of industry advice.\nIn 2013 the Award for the Best Emerging Artist was changed to Bille Brown Award for Best Emerging Artist, named after the late actor.\nAt the 2015 awards co-founder Alison Cotes was farewelled after 25 years on the committee. She later wrote: \"In spite of many changes over its 29 year history, and the often bitter political rows about format and judges, the Matilda Awards are still going strong, and with the backing of Arts Queensland will continue to develop, even if they do annoy many people along the way and attract plenty of criticism.\"\nAt the 2015 awards the Gold Matilda was awarded posthumously to Carol Burns. She was renowned in Brisbane theatre and the audience responded with a standing ovation.\nOver the years awards have been won by productions from many theatre companies including Aboriginal Centre for the Performing Arts, Fractal Theatre Company,  Harvest Rain, Judith Wright Arts Centre, La Boite, Grin 'n' Tonic, little red company, Metro Arts, Monsters Appear, Oscar Theatre Company,  Queensland Theatre Company (QTC), shake & stir, The Escapists, Wax Lyrical, and Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre.\nHall of Fame\nIn 2011, the Matilda Awards created a Hall of Fame which recognises performers/craftsmen for a body of work. , the inductees were Sven Swenson, Sue Rider, Eugene Gilfedder, David Walters, Bill Haycock, Dale Ferguson, Andrew Buchanan, Caroline Kennison, Michael Futcher, Helen Howard, Greg Clarke, Hayden Spencer, Helen Cassidy, and Jennifer Flowers.\nAwards\nWinners are listed on the Matilda Awards website.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
