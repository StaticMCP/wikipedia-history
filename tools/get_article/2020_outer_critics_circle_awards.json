Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no formal awards ceremony was held, nor did the awards name winners. Instead, the normal slate of nominees were celebrated as honorees, as Broadway and Off-Broadway had been shut down on March 12, 2020.\nDespite the pandemic, with a cut-off date for the awards of March 6, over 150 productions were eligible, while the following were only eligible for new components to their productions, which were eligible in their previous runs: Girl from the North Country, Sea Wall/A Life and Slave Play.\nAwards and nominations\nAmong the 2020 Honorees, Moulin Rouge was the most nominated production, receiving 11 nominations including Outstanding New Broadway Musical, alongside Jagged Little Pill and Tina, which received eight and five nominations, respectively. The Secret Life of Bees and The Sound Inside both received seven nominations, including Outstanding New Off-Broadway Musical and Outstanding New Broadway Play, respectively. The Inheritance and The Height of the Storm both followed closely, with five nominations each.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Category\n!Honorees\n|-\n|Outstanding New Broadway Play\n|\n* Grand Horizons\n* The Height of the Storm\n* The Inheritance\n* Linda Vista\n* The Sound Inside\n|-\n|Outstanding New Broadway Musical\n|\n* Jagged Little Pill\n* Moulin Rouge!\n* Tina: The Tina Turner Musical\n|-\n|Outstanding New Off-Broadway Play\n|\n* Cambodian Rock Band\n* Greater Clements\n* Halfway Bitches Go Straight to Heaven\n* Make Believe\n* Seared\n|-\n|Outstanding New Off-Broadway Musical\n|\n* Darling Grenadine\n* Octet\n* The Secret Life of Bees\n* Soft Power\n* A Strange Loop\n|-\n| Outstanding Revival of a Play\n|\n* Betrayal\n* Fires in the Mirror\n* For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf\n* Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune\n* ''A Soldier's Play\n|-\n| Outstanding Revival of a Musical\n|\n* Little Shop of Horrors\n* The Unsinkable Molly Brown\n* West Side Story\n|-\n| John Gassner Award\n|\n* Catya McMullen, Georgia Mertching Is Dead\n* Will Arbery, Heroes of the Fourth Turning\n* Alexis Scheer, Our Dear Dead Drug Lord\n* Eboni Booth, Paris\n|-\n| Outstanding Book of a Musical  (Broadway or Off-Broadway)\n|\n* Diablo Cody, Jagged Little Pill\n* David Henry Hwang, Soft Power\n* Michael R.
