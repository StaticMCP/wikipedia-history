The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, about 3 to 4 kilometers from the \"Tungareshwar Entrance Gate,\" and opens in the morning from 05:00 AM to 06:00 PM. This is a Lord Shiva temple and also has a Ram Kund in the backside area (Kunds are human-made small water bodies).  Alongside the Tungareshwar Temple, a small temple of Goddess \"Khodiyaar Mataji\" (with her vehicle, a crocodile). Being said about God and Goddess, Tungareshwar attracts devotees who visit both these temples at special occasions and festival seasons like \"Khodiyar Jayanti,\" which comes in around February, and \"Maha Shivratri\" in Shravana Months as per the Hindu calendar, falling between July and August every year. Bhandara (a religious, publicly organized feast) takes place every year at the \"Mahashivratri Festival\" and every Monday at the Shravan month.\nHistory and Legend\nTungareshwar, a collection of five mountains, houses some very holy temples like those of Shiva, Kal Bhairav (the avatar of Shiva), Jagmata Temple (the avatar of Parvati, wife of Lord Shiva), the Balyogi Sadanandh Maharaj Matth. According to the legends, Lord Parashurama killed a Demon named 'Tunga' at this place. The temple was built in the honor of Lord Parashurama. Lord Parashurama meditated here in this place. It is believed that Adi Shankaracharya had meditated at a place nearby Shuparak, now called Sopara or Nalasopara.\nArchitecture\nThis temple is naturally situated in a strangely beautiful garden. In the dome, a trident (trident) stands impressively against the horizon. The temple room was small but beautifully decorated in minimalist works of colourful glass. In one corner of the room, a diya was lit, and there was a small temple of Devi. In the center, there is the Main Ling – Lord Shiva, with a huge serpent in brass coiled around it. A brass post hangs above, and water trickling down from it drops by drop over the Shivling. The temple also has some symbols of sacred geometry, and the temple is designed as per Vaastu Shastra.\nGallery\nFile:View of Tungareshwar Entrance Gate.jpg|View of Tungareshwar Entrance Gate, Vasai.\nFile:Close View of Tungareshwar Temple.jpg|Close View of Tungareshwar Temple at Vasai.\nFile:View of Tungareshwar Temple Shiv Ling.jpg|View of Tungareshwar Temple Shiv Ling.\nFile:Ram Kund at Tungareshwar Temple.jpg|View of Ram Kund at Tungareshwar Temple.\nFile:Goddess Khodiyaar Mataji at Tungareshwar Temple.jpg|View of A small temple of Goddess Khodiyaar Mataji (with her vehicle crocodile)\nFile:Ma Durga idols at Tungareshwar Temple.jpg|View of Mother Durga idols at Tungareshwar Temple\nFile:Hanuman Temple at Tungareshwar.jpg|View of small Hanuman Temple at Tungareshwar Temple.\nFile:Information Board of Tungareshwar Temple.jpg|View of Information Board of Tungareshwar Temple.\nSee also\n* Jivdani Mata Temple\n* Mumba Devi Temple\n* Siddhivinayak Temple, Mumbai\n* Mahalakshmi Temple, Mumbai\n* Babulnath Temple\n* Walkeshwar Temple\n* Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Mumbai\nReferences\nExternal links"
