It is a match-up between two historically black NCAA Division I FCS programs in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia.\nHistory\nPrivate Hampton University and public Norfolk State University are both located in the Hampton Roads region of coastal Virginia. The two schools are located, respectively, in Hampton, Virginia and Norfolk, Virginia, across the James River from each other. As the name of the rivalry suggests, the James River empties into the Chesapeake Bay just downstream.\nHampton and Norfolk State were both members of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference in the FCS. On November 16, 2017, Hampton announced that they were becoming a member of the Big South Conference in 2018. The two teams are scheduled to meet again through 2024.\nThe football series began in 1963 and has been played a total of 60 times as of 2025.\nGame results\n| team2 = Norfolk State\n| team2style =\n| October 19, 1963 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 42 | Hampton | 0\n| October 17, 1964 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 13 | Hampton | 9\n| October 16, 1965 | Portsmouth, VA | Norfolk State | 20 | Hampton | 0\n| October 15, 1966 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 33 | Hampton | 27\n| October 14, 1967 | Portsmouth, VA | Norfolk State | 23 | Hampton | 20\n| October 19, 1968 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 13 | Norfolk State | 7\n| October 18, 1969 | Portsmouth, VA | Norfolk State | 39 | Hampton | 6\n| October 17, 1970 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 52 | Hampton | 0\n| October 16, 1971 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 30 | Hampton | 15\n| October 14, 1972 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 33 | Hampton | 14\n| October 13, 1973 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 21 | Hampton | 6\n| October 19, 1974 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 27 | Hampton | 10\n| October 18, 1975 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 27 | Norfolk State | 7\n| October 16, 1976 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 24 | Hampton | 7\n| October 15, 1977 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 18 | Norfolk State | 0\n| October 14, 1978 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 16 | Hampton | 6\n| October 13, 1979 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 26 | Hampton | 13\n| October 18, 1980 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 37 | Hampton | 14\n| October 17, 1981 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 23 | Norfolk State | 20\n| October 16, 1982 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 25 | Hampton | 7\n| October 15, 1983 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 14 | Norfolk State | 12\n| October 13, 1984 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 15 | Hampton | 7\n| October 19, 1985 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 36 | Norfolk State | 35\n| October 18, 1986 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 19 | Norfolk State | 14\n| October 17, 1987 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 48 | Norfolk State | 17\n| October 15, 1988 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 34 | Hampton | 27\n| October 14, 1989 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 20 | Hampton | 20\n| October 13, 1990 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 27 | Hampton | 18\n| October 19, 1991  | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 26 | Hampton | 12\n| October 17, 1992 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 60 | Norfolk State | 0\n| October 16, 1993 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 48 | Norfolk State | 21\n| October 15, 1994 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 53 | Norfolk State | 28\n| October 14, 1995 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 23 | Norfolk State | 18\n| November 16, 1996 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 14 | Hampton | 7\n| October 18, 1997 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 9 | Norfolk State | 2\n| October 17, 1998 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 59 | Norfolk State | 14\n| October 16, 1999 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 28 | Norfolk State | 27\n| October 14, 2000 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 47 | Norfolk State | 19\n| October 13, 2001 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 28 | Hampton | 20\n| October 19, 2002 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 31 | Norfolk State | 14\n| October 18, 2003 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 52 | Norfolk State | 0\n| October 16, 2004 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 58 | Norfolk State | 10\n| October 15, 2005 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 55 | Norfolk State | 14\n| October 14, 2006 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 42 | Norfolk State | 13\n| October 13, 2007 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 20 | Hampton | 19\n| October 18, 2008 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 35 | Norfolk State | 17\n| October 17, 2009 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 46 | Hampton | 6\n| October 16, 2010 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 7 | Norfolk State | 6\n| October 15, 2011 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 34 | Hampton | 24\n| October 13, 2012 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 28 | Norfolk State | 14\n| October 19, 2013 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 27 | Norfolk State | 17\n| October 18, 2014 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 21 | Hampton | 13\n| September 26, 2015 | Norfolk, VA | Norfolk State | 24 | Hampton | 14\n| November 19, 2016 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 17 | Hampton | 10\n| October 14, 2017 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 16 | Norfolk State | 14\n| October 2, 2021 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 47 | Hampton | 44OT\n| September 17, 2022 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 17 | Norfolk State | 7\n| September 9, 2023 | Hampton, VA | Norfolk State | 31 | Hampton | 23\n| September 14, 2024 | Norfolk, VA | Hampton | 37 | Norfolk State | 7\n| October 4, 2025 | Hampton, VA | Hampton | 41 | Norfolk State | 34\n}}\nSee also\n* List of NCAA college football rivalry games\n* Norfolk State–Old Dominion rivalry\nReferences"
