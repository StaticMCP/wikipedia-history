By 1888, Bishop had switched to first class rugby club Swansea, and that year he was part of the team that faced the first international touring team, the New Zealand Natives. Bishop was suffering with damaged ribs, but played regardless showing bravery throughout the match. At one point Bishop missed the goal from a dropkick by a matter of inches. Swansea eventually lost the game by a goal and two tries to nil.\nIn 1889 Bishop was selected for his one and only appearance for Wales. As part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship, Bishop was chosen to play against Scotland at Raeburn Place under the captaincy of Frank Hill. Wales lost the match and Bishop never represented his country again.\nInternational matches played\nWales\n*  1889\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
