It was the first of twelve Russo-Turkish wars ending with World War I in 1914–18.\nIn 1556, the Astrakhan Khanate was conquered by Ivan the Terrible, who had a new fortress built on a steep hill overlooking the Volga.\nIn 1568, the Ottoman Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, who was the real power in the administration of the Ottoman Empire under Selim II, initiated the first encounter between the Ottoman Empire and her future northern arch-rival Russia. The results presaged the many disasters to come. A plan to unite the Volga and Don by a canal was detailed in Constantinople.\nMartin Janet explains the outbreak of the war by saying that the Russians interfered in the trading affairs of the Ottomans and prevented the pilgrimage to Mecca. Vitaly Penskoi and Stanford Shaw argue that it was to occupy Astrakhan, which could have become the northern base for attacking the Safavids or the core for will build a northern defensive system. Murat Yaşar also claims that Astrakhan was the target of the Ottomans. The Ottoman Empire sent a large force under Mustafa Pasha of 20,000 Turks and 50,000 Tatars to lay siege to Astrakhan. Meanwhile an Ottoman fleet besieged Azov. However, a sortie from the garrison under Knyaz (prince) Serebrianyi-Obolenskiy, the Russian military governor of Astrakhan, drove back the besiegers. A Russian relief army of 30,000 attacked and scattered the workmen and the Tatar force sent for their protection. On their way home up to 70% of the remaining soldiers and workers froze to death in the steppes or became victims of attacks by Circassians. The Ottoman fleet was destroyed by a storm. The Ottoman Empire, though militarily defeated, achieved safe passage for Muslim pilgrims and traders from Central Asia, and two years later, as a result of the Crimean raids, the Russians were forced to destroy a large section of the fort on the Terek River. The Russians did this because of the protracted hostilities in Livonia and fearing a new Ottoman campaign against Astrakhan.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Attila Weiszhár and Balázs Weiszhár: Lexicon of Wars, publisher: Athenaeum, Budapest 2004.\n*\n*\n*\n*"
