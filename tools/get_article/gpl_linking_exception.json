Linking is the technical process of connecting code in a library to the using code, to produce a single executable file. It is performed either at compile time or run-time in order to produce functional machine-readable code. The Free Software Foundation states that, without applying the linking exception, a program linked to GPL library code may only be distributed under a GPL-compatible license. This has not been explicitly tested in court, but linking violations have resulted in settlement. The license of the GNU Classpath project explicitly includes a statement to that effect.\nMany free software libraries which are distributed under the GPL use an equivalent exception, although the wording of the exception varies. Notable projects include ERIKA Enterprise, GNU Guile, the run-time libraries of GNAT, GNU Classpath and the GCC Runtime Library Exception.\nCompiler runtime libraries also often use this license modification or an equivalent one, e.g. the libgcc library in the GNU Compiler Collection, as well as all libraries of the Free Pascal project.\nIn 2007, Sun Microsystems released most of the source code to the class libraries for the Java SE and Java EE projects under version 2 of the GPL license plus the Classpath linking exception, and used the same license as one possible license for their enterprise server GlassFish and for their NetBeans Java IDE.\nVersion 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is likewise constructed as an exception to the GPL.\nThe Classpath exception\nThe GNU Classpath project provides an example of the use of such a GPL linking exception. The GNU Classpath library uses the following license:\nAs such, it can be used to run, create and distribute a large class of applications and applets. When GNU Classpath is used unmodified as the core class library for a virtual machine, compiler for the Java language, or for a program written in the Java programming language, it does not affect the licensing for distributing those programs directly.\nThe GNU Lesser General Public License\nWhile version 2.1 of the LGPL was a standalone licence, the current LGPL version 3 is based on a reference to the GPL.\nCompared to the GNU Classpath license above, the LGPL formulates more requirements to the linking exception: licensees must allow modification of the portions of the library they use and reverse engineering (of their software and the library) for debugging such modifications.\nSee also\n*\n* Free-software licence\n* GNAT Modified General Public License\n* OpenSSL Exception\n* Software using the GPL linking exception (category)\n* GPL font exception\nReferences\nExternal links"
