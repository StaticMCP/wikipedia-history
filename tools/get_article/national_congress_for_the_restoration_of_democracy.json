Its abbreviated name was the \"National Congress\".\nOverview\nThe National Congress held up the goal of democratic restoration, prescribed its organizational character as a “pan-national, non-political organization that advances a national movement without engaging in political activity,” and adopted “autonomy, peace, and conscience” as its code of conduct.\nThe democratization movement opposed to the personal dictatorship of President Park Chung-hee—the so-called Restoration Regime—was suppressed through Emergency Order No. 1, proclaimed in January 1974, and Emergency Order No.4, proclaimed in April 1974 in connection with the Democratic Youth League Incident. However, when the Emergency Measures were lifted in August, the democratization movement gained momentum again, with active movements developing among people from various fields, including opposition parties, students, religious figures, and journalists.\nOn 27 November, 71 representatives from various fields gathered at a Christian church in Jongno, Seoul, and held the Assembly for the Declaration of Democratic Resotration. The group included Yun Po-sun (former President),  (former leader of the New Democratic Party and scholar of constitutional law), Kim Young-sam (then leader of the New Democratic Party),  ( representative), Ham Seok-heon (religious leader), Cheon Gwan-u (orator), Yun Hyeong-jung (religious leader), Lee Byeong-lin (lawyer), and Lee Tai-young (lawyer). At this assembly, a resolution was passed to establish the National Congress for the Restoration of Democracy. The assembly also adopted a six-point “National Declaration,” which called for amending the current constitution to a democratic one through a reasonable process, releasing all political prisoners subject to prison sentences, detentions, or house arrest and restoring their political rights, and guaranteeing freedom of speech.\nOn 25 December that same year, the National Congress for the Restoration of Democracy was officially launched at its founding meeting, held at the Seoul YMCA Hall. Ten members were elected as committee representatives, including Yun Hyeong-jung (regular representative), Lee Byeong-lin, Lee Tai-young, , and Ham Seok-heon, while another six were elected as members of the steering committee, including Hong Seong-u, , and Ham Se-ung. In addition, another 18 people, including Yun Po-sun and Kim Dae-jung, were elected as advisors.\nBy March 1975, three months after its formal establishment, branches had been formed in 7 cities and provinces, along with 20 additional cities and counties. As the central force within the democratization movement, the National Congress launched a boycott of the national referendum held on February 12 regarding the Restoration Constitution, as well as a Declaration of Conscience movement to declare the confessions, statements, and memorandums compelled by investigative authorities invalid. However, from the very beginning, the group was subjected to severe government oppression, including the dismissal of university professors who had signed the National Declaration and the arrest of lawyers involved in the management of the National Congress. Following the proclamation of Emergency Order No. 9 in May 1975, the activities of the National Congress were completely shut down.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Signatories of the National Declaration of Democratic Restoration (71 Individuals)\n!Classification\n!Full Name\n|-\n|Elder Statesman\n|Yun Po-sun, Baek Nak-jun, Lee In, Kim Hong-il, , , Jeong Hwa-am\n|-\n|Independence Activist\n|Kim Jae-ho, Ahn Jae-hwan, Yu Seok-hyun\n|-\n|Constituent National Assembly Member\n|, ,\n|-\n|Catholic\n|Yun Hyeong-jung, Ham Se-ung, Shin Hyeon-bong, Kim Tak-am, Ahn Chung-seok, Yang Hong, Lee Chang-bok, Park Sang-rae\n|-\n|Protestant\n|Kim Jae-jun, Ham Seok-heon, Kang Sin-myeong, Kang Won-ryong, Kim Gwan-seok, Yun Pan-ung, Jo Hyang-rok, Lee Sang-rin, Park Chang-gyun, Kang Gi-cheol, Gye Koon-tae\n|-\n|Buddhist\n|Beop-jeong\n|-\n|Academic\n|Lee Hee-seung, Jeong Seok-hae, Lee Dong-hwa, Jeon Gyeong-won, Park Bong-in, Seo Nam-dong, Mun Dong-hwan, Ahn Byeong-mo\n|-\n|Literati\n|Lee Heong-gu, Kim Jeong-han, Park Won-hee, Kim Gyu-dong, , Go Eun, Kim Yun-su, , Hong Sa-jung\n|-\n|Orator\n|Cheon Gwan-u, , Jang Yong-hak, Kim Yong-gu, , Lim Jae-gyeong\n|-\n|Legal Professional\n|Lee Byeong-lin, Hong Seong-u, Hwang In-cheol, , Lim Gyeong-gu\n|-\n|Womens’ Activist\n|Lee Tai-young, Gong Deok-gwi, Lee U-jeong, Kim Jeong-ye\n|-\n|Politician\n|Kim Young-sam, , Ahn Pil-su, , Yun Jae-sul,\n|}\n:\nReferences"
