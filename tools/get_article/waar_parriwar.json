It featured Urmila Matondkar as the host, and Jatin Pandit as the in-house guru and trainer to the competing families.\nConcept\nThe show is a unique show which seamlessly blends, family bond with their love for music. It followed the journey of families from across India – their trials and tribulations, highs of victory and disappointment of defeat, their love for each other during tough times and eventually culminate in finding \"Sangeet Ka Naya Gharana\". The families competed against each other to win the title of best \"Sangeet Ka Naya Gharana\".\nThe show was judged by different celebrity judges each week and by India's foremost music families combined with audience voting.\n*The wildcard entry took place on Monday 14 July in which Ali Ghani Parriwar and Ramshankar Parriwar (now known as Shambhu Pandit Parriwar) have won among all other participants.
