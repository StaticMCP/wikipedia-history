Wilson follows Glen Campbell (1968), Brad Paisley (2000), and Kacey Musgraves (2013) who also had six in their first years.\n* With Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert's nominations for Entertainer of the Year, this is the first time that two female acts have been nominated in this category three years running since Reba McEntire and The Judds in 1986-88.\n* Shane McAnally's Song of the Year nomination for \"Never Wanted to Be That Girl\" ties him for most nominations in that category with Alan Jackson, with both songwriters achieving ten nods.\n* For the first time in CMA history, three of the five nominees in the Single of the Year category are collaborations. \"Never Wanted to Be That Girl\" by Carly Pearce and Ashley McBryde is also the second all-female collaboration to be nominated in this category, following \"Does He Love You\" by Reba McEntire and Linda Davis in 1994.\n* Miranda Lambert remains the most nominated female artist in CMA history, with 61, and the third most nominated artist overall behind Alan Jackson (81) and George Strait (83). Lambert's sixth Album of the Year nomination for Palomino makes her the most nominated female artist in that category, overtaking McEntire, Underwood and Loretta Lynn who each have five.\n* With 16 nods, Lambert and Underwood are tied for the third most nominations in the Female Vocalist of the Year category behind McEntire (18) and Martina McBride (17). Similarly, Lady A's 15th nomination for Vocal Group of the Year put them in joint third with The Statler Brothers and Diamond Rio behind Little Big Town (17) and Alabama (21) for most nominations in the category. Brooks & Dunn also extend their lead as the most nominated act in the Vocal Duo of the Year category, with 23 nominations.\n* Paul Franklin continues to extend his streak as the most nominated musician in CMA history, receiving his 29th nomination in the Musician of the Year category. Despite his 30 nominations overall, Franklin is notable for having never won a CMA Award in any category.\nReception\nThe 56th CMA Awards averaged 7.57 million viewers during their live broadcast on ABC, up ten percent from the previous year's ceremony and becoming the most-watched show in its timeslot.\nReferences"
