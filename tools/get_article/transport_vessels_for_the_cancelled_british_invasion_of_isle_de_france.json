As part of preparations for the invasion, British authorities detained several of the East India Company's (EIC) East Indiamen at Portsmouth to serve as transport vessels. In May 1794, the British government cancelled the invasion and released the detained ships, paying demurrage to the EIC for having delayed their voyages to the East Indies. British forces carried out a successful invasion of Isle de France in 1810, using transport vessels which were mostly hired \"country ships\", British merchantmen registered in Indian ports such as Bombay and Calcutta, along with small number of EIC vessels that had arrived at Madras or Calcutta.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
