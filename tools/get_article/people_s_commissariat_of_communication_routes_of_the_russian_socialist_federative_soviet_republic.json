However, by the decree of the Council of People's Commissars of February 27, 1918, the management of the waterways was transferred to the Supreme Council of the People's Economy, and the management of railways and the organization of railway transportation remained under the jurisdiction of the People's Commissariat of Communication Routes.\nSince 1921, the management of automobile, horse–drawn and tram transport, loading and unloading and freight forwarding business in all modes of transport has been transferred to the jurisdiction of the People's Commissariat of Communication Routes.\nOn December 9, 1921, on the initiative of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the Decree of the All–Russian Central Executive Committee and the Council of Labor and Defense of the Republic \"On the Protection of Warehouses, Goods Sheds and Storerooms, as Well as Structures on Railway and Waterways of Communication\" was adopted, in accordance with which an armed Guard of Communications was created in the structure of the People's Commissariat of Communication Routes of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, which stopped massive attacks on railway facilities, freight and passenger trains.\nIn 1923, after the formation of the Soviet Union, the People's Commissariat of Communication Routes of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was transformed into the All–Union People's Commissariat of Communication Routes of the Soviet Union.\nPeople's Commissars of Communication Routes of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic\nMark Elizarov became the first People's Commissar. Also People's Commissars of Communication Routes were Leon Trotsky, Felix Dzerzhinsky. During the First World War and the Civil War, more than 60% of the network, 90% of the locomotive and 80% of the car fleet were destroyed.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! People's Commissars\n!
