Like most of his other songs, it was co-written by songwriter Lennaert Nijgh. The music was composed by Boudewijn de Groot himself. The song is a protest against the war in Vietnam and the US president of the time, Lyndon B. Johnson and solidified De Groot as a protest singer.\nSee also\n*List of anti-war songs\nExternal links\n*[http://www.boudewijndegroot.nl/ Homepage Boudewijn de Groot]"
