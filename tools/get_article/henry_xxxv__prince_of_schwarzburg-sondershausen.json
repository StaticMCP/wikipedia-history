When he received Schwarzburg-Keula, he was upset with his family, including his siblings, and left the principality.  He settled on a country estate in Bürgel and maintained good contacts with his uncle, Duke William Ernest of Saxe-Weimar.\nHis elder half-brother Günther XLIII died childless in 1740, and Henry XXXV succeeded him as the ruling Prince.  He resided in Sondershausen Castle and in the market town of Reichelsheim.\nAlthough the Seven Years' War was raging during his reign, he did little to support his subjects.  He was wasteful and loved ostentatious displays of wealth.  For example, he owned a collection of diamonds worth half a million Taler, giving him his nickname Prince of Diamonds.  He was also a passionate collector of state coaches.  He owned 37 coaches, including two magnificent French specimens.  His Gold State Coach is now on display in Sondershausen Castle.\nHenry XXXV was the most controversial ruler of his dynasty.  He was very far from his subjects emotionally, and travelled outside his principality very often.  Because of his strained relationship with his siblings, he left his allodial possessions to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg.\nHe died unmarried in 1758, and was succeeded by Christian Günther III, the eldest son of his younger brother August I.\nSee also\n* House of Schwarzburg\n* Schwarzburg-Sondershausen\nReferences\n* Friedrich Apfelstedt: Das Haus Kevernburg-Schwarzburg von seinem Ursprunge bis auf unsere Zeit.
