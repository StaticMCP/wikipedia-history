Mark Donohue thinks it is related to Yoke, forming together the Lower Mamberamo family. On a 200 word list, they share 33%. Also there are some grammar similarities. According to Donohue, Warembori is heavily influenced by Austronesian languages to the west, in both vocabulary and grammar, Yoke is less influenced by them. More recent researchers (Dunn & Reesink, Foley, Kamholz) have classified Warembori and Yoke as  Austronesian languages. Malcolm Ross leaves Yoke unclassified due to lack of data, apparently referring to the fact that Donohue did not publish independent pronouns in Yoke. He did publish subject prefixes on verbs, which are very similar to Warembori, and the singular prefixes are also remarkably similar to two Kwerba family languages, namely Kauwera and Airoran, suggesting either borrowing or a distant relationship to Kwerba, though the Kwerba family shares almost no vocabulary with the Lower Mamberamo family. The Lower Mamberamo plural prefixes are similar to Austronesian, as are the plural object suffixes and, at least in Warembori, plural independent pronouns.\nKamholz (2024) classifies Warembori and Yoke as Austronesian, more specifically primary branches of South Halmahera–West New Guinea.\nPhonology\nVowels\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n! Front\n! Back\n|-\n! High\n|\n|\n|-\n! Mid\n|\n|\n|-\n! Low\n|colspan=\"2\"|\n|}\nConsonants\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|\n! Bilabial\n! Alveolar\n!

The heavy stops do not lenite.\nWhen a nasal is followed by a heavy plosive, it is lengthened, i.e. . When not followed by a stop, heavy nasals are long and preceded by a glottal closure, i.e. . Heavy consonants also attract stress.\nSome minimal pairs of heavy consonants are:\n* 'mouth',  'thorn'\n* 'crocodile',  'jungle'\nGrammar\nThe independent pronouns are:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!sg.!!du.!!pl.\n|-\n!Incl.\n|rowspan=2|||||\n|-\n!Excl.\n|||\n|-\n!2\n|||||\n|-\n!3\n|||||\n|}\nThe dual pronouns are derived from the plural via the infix . This parallels the nearby Austronesian Cenderawasih languages, which derive the dual from the plural with  or , from  'two'. The plural pronouns , , , , in turn, appear to be Austronesian in origin, from , , ,  (the latter via ). Although 3sg  might also derive from Austronesian , 1sg  and 2sc , the most basic pronouns, have no parallel in Austronesian. However, the basic pronouns , , , , ,  resemble Yoke ', ', ', ', ', ', illustrating the strong Austronesian influence on both languages.\nPossessive prefixes on nouns are nearly identical to subject prefixes on verbs. The object suffixes are also similar; the paradigm is very close to that of Yoke, apart from an inclusive-exclusive distinction which is not completely grammaticalized in the case of possessives.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Possessive !!

However, Kwerba has no more basic vocabulary in common with the Lower Mamberamo family than what is expected by chance.\nWriting system\nWarembori is written in a Latin alphabet based on the Indonesian. It represents phonetic, rather than phonemic, distinctions. In particular:\n* is written v\n* is written r\n* is written ngg\nReferences\n*\n*Rumaikewi, Luther, Lea Rumansao and Mark Donohue. 1998.
