Shomi currently runs a production company with his wife Punom Patwary based out of New York City.\nIllusive Media\nWhile a student at Old Dominion University Patwary co-created the multimedia artists collective, Illusive Media, with his lifelong friend and classmate Philip Ly. Initially the group began creating a web presence for underground artists, but later helped national acts like Sean Paul and N*E*R*D create an image that connected with a broader fan base. As websites like MySpace began to lose its grip in the internet and bloggers became the dominant source of information, Shomi and Illusive Media began directing Music Videos giving bloggers exclusive content to certain artists.  Through Illusive Media, Shomi has directed music videos for several artists, most notably A$AP Mob & Clipse. Shomi Patwary with Illusive Media has directed videos for: Lupe Fiasco, Major Lazer, ASAP Rocky, Mark Ronson, Joey Badass as well as many others.\nShomi is known for his guerrilla style of directing and editing often shooting, editing and releasing a complete project on the fly over a few days time. This allowed Illusive Media to remain more of an artists collective rather than a for-profit business making just enough money to keep the lights on  and thus attracting attention from top musicians and record industry executives across the globe.  Through Illusive Media, Patwary is also widely respected for often taking into account a musician's image and artistic input and putting his own spin on the project creating a truly collaborative process. He is often credited alongside other Illusive Media artistic collaborators such as Phil Ly (co-director), Abe Vilchez-Moran (Director), Robert Elliot Simmons (Special Effects), Tashfiq Patwary (Producer), Charley Feher (Videographer Designer), Paolo Obcemane (Videographer/Photographer/Video Editor) and Jay McCord (Producer/Director/Actor). Shomi's younger brother, Tashfiq, is a member of the VERYRVRE production team which has produced tracks for the hip hop collective A$AP Mob and Santigold.\nHaiti earthquake\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake Shomi teamed up with Robert Simmons, Jay McCord, Kenna, Lupe Fiasco, and Mike Shinoda on the \"Resurrection\" music video to promote the \"Music For Relief\". The song was written and the music video was directed for free with all proceeds going to aid the Haiti disaster through Music for Relief.\nKarmaloopTV & the FADER\nIn April 2012, Shomi was brought on board as an in-house music video director and television producer by Karmaloop.com's TV division. Shomi has worked with KarmaloopTV to help build the television and music video brand and tie it in with the online retail giant's streetwear image.  KarmaloopTV created a new division known as Karmaloop Media during the summer of 2012 Since taking the helm at Karmaloop, Patwary has shot videos for Beyoncé, ASAP Rocky, Diplo, Stalley, Wale, No Malice of the Clipse, and A-Trak. In 2014, Shomi left his appointment with Karmaloop to join the editorial team at the FADER magazine. With the FADER he will oversee all video production as Senior Video Producer.\n2016 Much Music Award nominations\nShomi Patwary was nominated in several categories in 2016's Much Music Awards for Belly's video  \"Might Not\" featuring The Weeknd.\nVideo of the Year\n* Alessia Cara, \"Here,\" Directed by Aaron A.\n* Belly f.
