In this battle, the Japanese successfully cut off Chongqing from the ocean, effectively severing foreign aid to China's war efforts by the sea, rendering Indochina, the Burma Road and The Hump the only ways to send aid to China.\nThe Chinese launched several major offensives that maximized Japanese casualties. A majority of the conflicts occurred in the fighting for Kunlun Pass. With the success of the Vietnam Expedition in September 1940, the Japanese were able to cut China off from Indochina. Now only the Burma Road and The Hump remained, ending the costly necessity of occupying Guangxi. By November 1940, Japanese forces had evacuated from Guangxi except from some coastal enclaves.\nOrder of battle\nSee also\n* Air Warfare of WWII from the Sino-Japanese War perspective\nSources\n*\n** [http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=94112&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=127 Map 18]\n* [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/ams/china/ Perry–Castañeda Library Map Collection], China 1:250,000, Series L500, U.S. Army Map Service, 1954- .
