Based on the character of the Evil Queen from \"Snow White\", the Queen of Fables is the living embodiment of all evil in folklore. She first appeared in JLA #47 (November 2000), and was created by Mark Waid, and Bryan Hitch.\nWanda Sykes voices the Queen of Fables in HBO's Harley Quinn.\nFictional character biography\nThe Queen of Fables was originally a sorceress from another dimension until she was exiled to Earth. She reigned until princess Snow White defied her and she was trapped in the Book of Fables. Snow White used the book to turn fact into fiction and undo all the Queen's terrible acts.\nCountless generations later the Queen was unwittingly released from her prison. She transformed Manhattan into an enchanted forest full of fantastic creatures extracted from folk tales. Just after being released she attempted to locate Snow White, mistaking a television for a magic mirror, and ordered it to show her -\"The Fairest In The Land\". Coincidentally, the TV was currently showing the news, reporting the Justice League's latest battle, and at that moment showing Wonder Woman. Believing the Amazon Princess to be her daughter, she confronts her, forcing her into a deep sleep in an enchanted forest. Aquaman awakens Wonder Woman with his kiss (as he was once a Prince, and is now the King of Atlantis, it counts as a kiss from a Prince), and Batman discovers the book that the Queen had been trapped in. Eventually, the Justice League managed to stop her, by making her realize that she was no longer immortal and eternally beautiful in the real world, and lock her up once more (by trapping her within a book on the United States Tax Code, where she could find nothing imaginative to use as a weapon), undoing her spell again.\nEventually the Queen of Fables awakens and is none too happy. Since being defeated by the Justice League, who placed her in the U.S. Tax Code manual, she has somehow escaped and now has her sights set on her own Prince Charming, Superman. After transporting Superman to a Kryptonian glass forest, he is able to win his freedom and defeat the Queen (although the effort leaves him weak). She is last seen standing over a young sleeping girl, saying \"Sleep well, dear one. Keep me alive. Dream of me. Dream of me\".\nShe returns again after assuming the identity of Laney Kirswel, the film executive in charge of an unauthorized Wonder Woman biography, made mostly of unapproved and slandering materials. She is again able to act in the human world, where she puts Wonder Woman through hellish scenarios, taken from the movie, meant to represent distorted happenings in her life. Diana coaxes her into taking the form of a huge dragon, who she notes is reminiscent of Maleficent, and blinds her with two battle axes, forcing her to flee.\nPowers and abilities\nThe Queen of Fables is an extremely powerful sorceress capable of altering the fabric of reality at an almost unparalleled level. She was able to transform Manhattan into an enchanted forest so vast that not even beings as fast as the Flash were able to escape it. She can perform virtually any feat and usually has fairy tale creatures such as dragons, trolls, fairies, witches, ogres and goblins at her command. The Queen of Fables has the ability to conjure various fictional monsters from other stories to use against the Justice League. She is immortal and cannot be killed while she resides within her storybook.\nIn other media\nTelevision\n* The Queen of Fables appears in Harley Quinn, voiced by Wanda Sykes. This version's powers are derived from a magical storybook, the Book of Fables, from which she can conjure storybook characters to do her bidding. In the 1980s, she attempted to transform Gotham into an enchanted forest kingdom before being defeated by the Justice League and imprisoned in a tax book by Zatanna. In \"The Line\", she is freed by a court order and sentenced to serve the rest of her term at Arkham Asylum. After Harley Quinn breaks her out in transit, the Queen temporarily joins her crew before her extreme and violent methods lead to her being ousted and vowing revenge. In \"Devil's Snare\", the Queen allies with the Joker, traps the Justice League in her storybook, and attempts to kill Harley and her crew, but is decapitated and reduced to a disembodied head.\n** The Queen of Fables appears in Kite Man: Hell Yeah!, voiced by Janelle James. Throughout the series, she mounts attempts to gain a new body.\nVideo games\nThe Queen of Fables appears as a character summon in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure.\nMiscellaneous\n* The Queen of Fables appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold #5. She abducts children so she can use their tears to maintain her youth, but encounters Batman and Captain Marvel. While she transforms the latter into a dragon minion, Batman steals the storybook and tricks the dragon into destroying it, causing the Queen to melt and undo her spells.\n* The Queen of Fables appears in DC Super Friends #21. When the Queen's storybook suddenly appears in their Watchtower, the Super Friends open it out of curiosity, but it pulls them into a fairy tale realm where the Queen invites them to become her subjects. When they decline, she scatters them throughout the realm before they eventually regroup, defeat her, and return to the Watchtower.\nReferences"
