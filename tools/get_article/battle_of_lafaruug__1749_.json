This battle established the dominance of the Isaaq Clan in the region and marked the beginning of the Isaaq Sultanate a year later.\nBackground\nAbdi Eissa was an Isaaq leader, Religious Mullah and a Military leader for the Isaaq  king at the time of the Tol jeclo dynasty named Boqor or King Harun dhuh Barar.\nAbdi rose to prominence after overthrowing the Tol Jeclo dynasty that had previously ruled the Isaaq clan.\nThe last King from the Tol Jeclo dynasty, King Harun (nicknamed dhuux baraar) has been described as a very cruel man, which led to Abdi Eissa’s dissatisfaction with him.\nHe organized a coalition of Isaaq clans to end the oppressive rule of the Tol Jeclo, positioning himself as a regent. In a show of humility, Abdi Eisa declined the leadership title for himself and instead installed his underage son Guled as the first sultan of the Isaaq clan in July 1750, acting as regent until Guled came of age.\nCauses\nOne day, as a group of Habar Awal Sacad Muuse tribesmen were grazing their camels in a place called Indha badane around the Gollis Mountains, a group of Ogaden came and sacked the town, looting everything including the camels in the process, they also sacked the town of Sheikh on the way and returned to their lands.\nAbdi Eissa was enraged by this and demanded that the Sacad Muse get ready to attack the Ogaden and take back their livestock.\nInstead, The elders of the Sacad Muse states that they were not ready for war, and that they should simply forget about the sacked towns and the stolen Camels. Abdi got even more enraged and composed poems calling out the Sacad Muse for cowardice, and saying that they were simply scared.\nHe also ordered all the Isaaq subclans that they should not help the Sacad Muse if they were to get into conflict, and not help them retrieve their stolen livestock.\nEventually, the Sacad Muse conceded and joined the preparations for the ensuing battle.\nBattle\nThe battle was fought near the vicinity of Lafa-Ruug. Abdi Eisa’s leadership led to a decisive victory for the Isaaq forces. His ability to unify various Isaaq Subclans under a single cause was a key factor in their success.\nIt is said that the name “Lafa-ruug” is a reference to the harshness of the battle, where the absame tribes suffered heavy casualties.\nAftermath\nFollowing the battle, the Isaaq clan firmly established its dominance in the region. The leadership of the Isaaq clan transitioned into a hereditary sultanate under Sultan Guled. Abdi Eisa's coalition-building and strategic vision laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Isaaq Sultanate.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
