He is best known for his role as Super Hans in the British sitcom Peep Show.\nEarly life\nKing was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, England on 31 January 1968 and attended Cheshunt School. He moved to Australia at age 20 where he worked as a chef before meeting Jimeoin McKeown. McKeown suggested that King become a stand-up comedian. King worked in the Australian comedy circuit for 15 years before returning to the UK.\nCareer\nAs an actor he has played many characters, including Elton John and Terry Venables in the BAFTA-nominated comedy series Star Stories, and also starring in his own self-penned sketch show Dogface.\nHis role as Super Hans in Peep Show spanned more than a decade. He has performed DJ sets in-character as Super Hans.\nHe has appeared in cult comedy series Look Around You, and in the third series of Skins, playing Cook's father, a character very similar to Super Hans. He co-starred in the film Inkheart, appeared in the Guy Ritchie film Rocknrolla, and the British film Bronson, and had a lead role in the fantasy thriller Malice in Wonderland. He also appeared in the third series of Doctor Who and as Peter Streete in \"The Shakespeare Code\", and was a regular playing computer expert Freeman in the BBC production Jekyll.\nAs a stand-up comedian he has appeared at the Edinburgh Festival, and at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.\nKing played a mad scientist in a 2007 commercial promoting a newly customizable credit card by Capital One.\nIn 2010 he played driver and bodyguard to Ray Winstone's character Rob Gant in London Boulevard alongside Colin Farrell and Keira Knightley. In the same year he co-wrote the BBC2 series Whites starring Alan Davies.\nIn 2010-2011, King starred in the Australian supernatural comedy-drama series Spirited, in which he plays the ghost of 1980s rock star Henry Mallet. He also stars in the Sky One generational family comedy drama, Starlings, co-written with Steve Edge and produced by Steve Coogan.\nIn 2013, King appeared in the final episode of The IT Crowd as Raymond Peterfellow. In 2015, he narrated the audiobook The Hunt for the Mayor of Smoochyville, written by writer and musician Chris Wade. In 2017, he appeared as Phil Hendricks in the BBC drama In the Dark.\nDuring the Xbox Showcase in June 2024, King was revealed to be playing Humphry in the 2026 Fable reboot.\nIn October 2025, King appeared in the music video for the song \"Fundraiser\" by Bar Italia.\nIn November 2025, it was announced, alongside four other members of the main Peep Show cast, that King would feature as a guest star on Channel 4's The Great British Bake Off Christmas Edition.\nIn the media\nIn 2024, King announced he was leaving X/Twitter, calling out Elon Musk after he stumbled across a disturbing video shared with the website. He directed his followers instead to his accounts on Instagram, Threads and the relatively new social media network Bluesky.\nPersonal life\nHe is a fan of Tottenham Hotspur, as is his character on Peep Show.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
