The film stars James Badge Dale, Ben Foster, Michael Mando, Graham Greene, and Melissa Leo.\nThe film premiered at the 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival in September 2, 2024, and was released on November 14, 2025.\nCast\nProduction\nThe film was shot in the Tulsa area during the summer of 2023. The production was made on a budget of under $7.5 million. Swab described the film as 'by far the most personal movie' he made.\nRelease\nThe film premiered at the 81st Venice International Film Festival, in the \"Orizzonti Extra\" sidebar. In March 2025, Saban Films and Roadside Attractions acquired North American distribution, while Universal Pictures handled other territories. It was theatrically released on 752 screens in the United States on November 14, 2025.\nReception\nThe Hollywood Reporter's film critic Jordan Mintzer praised the film, describing it as \"effective\", \"hard-nosed\" and \"above your average drug thriller\", and noted \"its uncompromisingly bleak view of fentanyl's damaging hold on the U.S. is not necessarily a crowd-pleaser, but it well deserves a look\". Rodrigo Perez from The Playlist paired it to  Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, and described the film as 'intense and engaging' and 'a terrific surprise'.\nScreen International's Tim Grierson criticized the film, noting that while 'Swab creates a sense of constant propulsion [... ] and certainly the testosterone-fueled shootouts are muscular in their execution', 'the high-octane King Ivory is intense without being insightful' and it 'rarely surprises'.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
