Because passports not of the series OB were no longer considered valid travel documents from that date onwards, holders were obliged to apply for new DRC passports in order to travel.\nThe passport costs 185 US dollars. It has been reported that the Congolese government receives a share of 65 US dollars, with the remainder going to the Belgian company Semlex and the Emirati company LRPS. The contract with these companies has not been awarded in a public tender, and it has been alleged that both companies have ties to the Congolese President Joseph Kabila.\nAs of 1 January 2017, Democratic Republic of the Congo citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 40 countries and territories, ranking the Democratic Republic of the Congo passport 94th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Djiboutian and North Korean passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index.\nVisa-free travel\n]]\nSee also\n*Visa requirements for Democratic Republic of the Congo citizens\n*List of passports\nReferences"
