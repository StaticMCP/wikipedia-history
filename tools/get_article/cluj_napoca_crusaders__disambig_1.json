It was the first official American football and powerlifting team, with legal status in Cluj-Napoca, founded in February 2010 by a group of American football fans. The Crusaders are the 2012, 2013, 2017 and 2018 Romanian American football champions and runners-up in  the 2010, 2011, 2015 and 2016 editions of the National American Football Championship of Romania.\nHistory\nCrusaders was founded on February 13, 2010, when they had the first training session together as a team, and the coach Rafael Ruiz met them face to face for the first time, finding only a group of individuals who did not know about American football, but had a desire to learn and become an organized team.\nThe first months were difficult, not having a field to train ans usually renting small synthetic pitches and having new people in training, without equipment (shoulder pads, helmets and training equipment).\nAfter a month and a half of training, they had their first scrimmage (non-special teams) in Bucharest against the Bucharest Predators on April 10, 2010, which they lost without scoring a point and being stopped at the 1 yard four times. The final score is still uncertain.\nAfter two weeks, the Predators came to Cluj on April 24, 2010, to return the visit with a scrimmage (special teams, but no extra points or field goals due to the absence of posts). The match was played on the field of Baciu in Cluj. The score was Bucharest Predators 24-6 Cluj Crusaders, Crusaders scoring their first points on a blocked punt.\nIn July 2010, the Crusaders became an NGO association and Club Sportiv Cluj Crusaders was born. In the same month, with Warriors and Lions, they began to organize the first National Football Championship (CNFA) being played in three stages, in Timișoara, Cluj and Bucharest.\nThe Crusaders played the first official match of the Romanian Championship against Timișoara Lions, winning 42-0, and scoring the first touchdown of a national championship with a kick off return.\nThe team participated in the first RoBowl and lost 51–12 the championship against the Warriors in November 2010.\nIn early 2011, the Crusaders created a powerlifting team. The first powerlifting contest was held in Cluj-Napoca with three weight categories giving medals to the top three places and the best lifters. It also started to develop relations with the Romanian Federation of Powerlifting, assisting in the Sub-Juniors National Championship 2011, where the coach Rafael Ruiz participated as a referee, having 12 years of experience as a powerlifter and referee.\nOn March 26, 2011, the first organized tryouts of the Cluj Crusaders to recruit new people took place, growing from a team of 19 in 2010 to 34 registered players for the 2011 season.\nCluj Crusaders was the first team in Romania offering insurance to players.\nIn an effort to promote more the sport, the team organized with Timișoara Lions a tournament that is expected to become tradition between these two cities, The Cupa de Vest. The first round took place in Timișoara and the final took place in Cluj-Napoca, where the Crusaders claimed victory and the cup.\nIn June 2011, Club Sportiv Cluj Crusaders officially became a sports club, receiving recognition from the Ministry of Sport and its Certificate of Sports Identity (CIS), the first organization involving American football to have a CIS making it ready for when the sport is recognized. Cluj was  the first organization dedicated to powerlifting in Cluj and the first to join the Romanian Powerlifting Federation.\nCluj Crusaders participated in the National Powerlifting Championship in Timișoara on 3–4 September 2011 with two lifters, Flroin Oltean and Norbert Gero, who were the first lifters from the city to compete officially in a National Championship. They obtained four gold medals.\nDue to the situation of American Football in Romania, the second edition of the Ro-Bowl took place as a cup, again between the Cluj Crusaders and Bucharest Warriors. In the first game at Bucharest, Crusaders lost 14–6. For the first time the Ro-Bowl final was in Cluj-Napoca, where the team was the first in Romania to have cheerleaders participating. In a tough game, Crusaders won the game 20-15, becoming the first Romanian team to defeat the Warriors. The difference in points made the Crusaders lose the championship, but this only gave more motivation to prepare for next year and at the end the team accomplish one of the primary objectives of the 2011 season, to arrive to the Ro-Bowl again.\nWith the season end, Crusaders started to prepare and co-operate in the organization of the Bench Press National Championship in Alba Iulia on November 26 and 27, 2011. Crusaders appeared in all the publicity offered by the Powerlifting Federation as a partner along with important institutions and companies. The club won gold and bronze medals in the 59&nbsp;kg junior category and 74&nbsp;kg junior category, respectively.\nAt the end of 2011 and a year full of accomplishments and growth, the club created the first edition of the Cluj Crusaders Awards, where the best players received awards for their performances throughout the year making the most important awards the \"Crusader Award\" given to the Most Valuable Player of the Year and the \"Ironman Award\" to the player who attended the most practices.\nNational American Football Championship of Romania\n2010 season and RoBowl I\nThe first National American Football Championship of Romania started in 2010.\nThe first round was held at Timișoara in 24–25 July 2010.\nSaturday, 24 July 2010 was the official press conference about the first national American football championship.
