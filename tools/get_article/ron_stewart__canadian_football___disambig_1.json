He played for 13 seasons for the Rough Riders, winning three Grey Cup championships and won the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian Award in 1960. He played college football for the Queen's Golden Gaels.\nEarly life\nBorn in Toronto, Stewart played football at Riverdale Collegiate Institute in Toronto and then at Queen's University in Kingston between 1953 and 1957, where he was the team's most valuable player three times and played on two Yates Cup championship teams (1955 and 1956). He was voted MVP of the 1957 season.\nProfessional career\nStewart, though smaller than most players at 5 foot 7&nbsp;inches, went on to a 13-year career with the Ottawa Rough Riders from 1958 to 1970. Stewart was an Eastern Conference all star running back in 1960, 1961 and 1964.\nStewart played on Grey Cup winning teams in 1960, 1968 and 1969, and also played in the 1966 Grey Cup on the losing side.

After his retirement from football, he was appointed the ombudsman for the federal correction system in 1977, which post he held until his retirement in 2003.\nSince his retirement, Stewart has been the subject of an investigation by the Office of the Auditor General of Canada, Sheila Fraser. Her report of November 28, 2006 made allegations regarding Stewart, who the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported was accused of \"often skipping work and collecting $325,000 in improper or questionable salary, vacation pay and expenses during a six-year period of his 26 years in office.\" The file was handed over to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for investigation.\nThe list of allegations included:\n* hundreds of thousands of dollars in questionable payments, including money for days he spent on vacation\n* travel to cities hosting the Grey Cup championships that he billed as a trip taken to “investigate inmate complaints”\n* the purchase of two computers used by his family\n* collecting nearly $100,000 for vacation pay (claiming he hadn’t taken a vacation for 14 years of his 26-year stint as ombudsman)\n* handing out performance bonuses over six years and of budget surpluses to staffers, disguised as overtime payments, that totaled over $260,000\nThe RCMP investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.\nStewart eventually agreed to pay back $77,500 of the money.\nWendy Stewart, Ron's wife and a former Ottawa city Councillor, believes that many of the legal problems are due to the fact that her husband has been suffering from significant memory loss for decades. Though she does not remember her husband suffering many concussions, she believes his small size for a pro football player led to many hits to his head. Ron Stewart now has trouble remembering much beyond the present, and while physically healthy, needs constant help with his memory.\nPersonal life\nHe is married to Wendy Stewart, a former Ottawa city councillor.\nReferences"
