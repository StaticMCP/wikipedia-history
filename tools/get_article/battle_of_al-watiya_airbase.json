During this offensive, Air Force planes loyal to the GNA attacked LNA positions, escalating tensions between the opposing factions.\nAirstrikes and escalations\nOn April 8, 2019, a series of airstrikes occurred involving both pro-LNA and pro-GNA air forces. Pro-GNA fighter jets targeted the Al-Watiya air force base, prompting a swift response from pro-LNA MiG-21 fighter jets that successfully bombed the pro-GNA Mitiga International Airport in Tripoli. The exchange of airstrikes demonstrated the intensity of the conflict.\nA Mirage F1 incident on April 24, 2019, near Al-Watiya Air Base added further complexity. Initially claimed by pro-LNA sources as a pro-GNA Mirage F-1AD shot down, later analysis suggested it was a Mirage F1-AD with an unclear ownership history. However, analysis by foreign experts revealed it to be actually a Mirage F1-AD serial number 402, and initially suggested it was previously in the possession of the pro-LNA air forces, and that it was shot down by its own pro-LNA anti-air defences.\nSiege and counter-attacks\nOn 19 June 2019, pro-GNA forces claimed that their fighter jets bombed pro-LNA Al Watiya air force base, destroying on the runway a Russian Su-22 fighter bomber just as it was taking off. The conflict continued in April 2020 when GNA forces besieged Al-Watiya Air Base, prompting a counter-attack by LNA forces that captured the town of Al-Aqrabiya.\nGNA offensive and capture\nOn May 5, 2020, the GNA launched a new offensive to capture Al-Watiya airbase, claiming to have successfully encircled the base. GNA forces claimed to have destroyed two enemy Grad Rocket launch vehicles and various ammunition vehicles. The sustained assault culminated in the capture of the airbase on May 18, 2020, marking a significant advancement for forces aligned with Libya's internationally recognized government. GNA forces seized the remains of 2 Mirage F1 and 1 Su-22.\nAftermath and developments\nFollowing the capture, the GNA forces secured a Pantsir-S1 TLAR at the base, transporting it for examination. On July 4, 2020, unidentified \"foreign\" warplanes targeted Al-Watiya Air Base, with conflicting reports on the extent of damage. The base's subsequent expansion, improvements to the runway, and ongoing air operations underscored its continued strategic importance.\nReferences"
