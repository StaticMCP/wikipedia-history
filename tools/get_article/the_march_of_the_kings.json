Recognition of the theme spread outside Provence when Georges Bizet used it in his incidental music for .\nHistory\nOrigin and attributions\nThe precise origins of both the tune and the lyrics are uncertain and debated.\nThe lyrics are regularly attributed to Joseph-François Domergue (1691 – 2 April 1728, died in Avignon), priest-dean of Aramon, in the Gard, from 1724 to 1728, whose name appears on the first manuscript copy of the lyrics, dated 1742 and preserved in the library of Avignon.\nThe text was published in Paris in 1759 in the . Subsequently, the work was added to the various (expanded) editions of the Provençal Christmas collection by the poet and composer of the seventeenth century Nicolas Saboly (1614–1675) to which it has often and erroneously been attributed.\nAccording to the 1742 document, the text can be sung on the tune of a  ('March of Turenne'). This mention corresponds to the established practice of christmasists, consisting of placing their texts on \"known\" French songs spread by the printing press. One hypothesis is that this  would be a military march dating back to the 17th century, in honor of the victories of Marshal Turenne, Such a  has however not been found. Some authors wanted to attribute it to Jean-Baptiste Lully, although no document corroborates this attribution.\nAn Avignon tradition rather dates the  back to the fifteenth century, at the time of King René (1409–1480), while some authors from the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th leaned towards a reference to  (1352–1413), known as \"The Scourge of Provence\", grand-nephew of Pope Clement VI and nephew of Pope Gregory XI.\nIn the 21st century, several American scholars have suggested that the March of the Kings has a medieval origin dating back to the 13th century. It could then be one of the oldest Christmas carols listed with Veni redemptor gentium and one of the first entirely composed in vernacular, and not in Latin.\nAccording to research carried out by the scholar Stéphen d'Arve (Edmond de Catelin) at the end of the nineteenth century, the only known score is that of Étienne-Paul Charbonnier (1793–1872), organist at the Aix Cathedral, who, perhaps taking it from the chain of its predecessors, had reconstructed it from memory by modifying its orchestration as new instruments were introduced. Henri Maréchal, an inspector of the  having done research at the request of Frédéric Mistral, thought that  must have been composed by Abbé Domergue himself.\nEpiphany celebration\nEvery year, the Epiphany feast gives rise in certain towns and villages of Provence to popular parades, the \"Marches des Rois\", where citizens sumptuously dressed as Biblical Magi progress towards the local church to the sound of the  March and other traditional music, accompanied by inhabitants dressed according to local folklore. Particularly at Aix-en-Provence, from the beginning of the nineteenth century, a sumptuous popular ceremony celebrates the visit of the kings: a traditional procession of characters dressed in Provençal costumes (shepherds, horsemen, drummers, trades, etc.) accompanies the Magi and their camels to Saint-Sauveur Cathedral where the organist, accompanied by drummers, performs the air of the \"March of the Kings\" at the arrival of the procession, passing from \"pianissimo\" to \"fortissimo\" to evoke the approach of the procession. A large star is then lit on the main altar, symbolizing the star that guided the Magi to Bethlehem. The ceremony ends as the tune plays descrescendo when the Kings leave.\nJoseph d'Ortigue wrote in 1837:\nCovers and adaptations\nThe March of the Kings is one of the themes of the overture of ''l'Arlésienne (1872 ), incidental music composed by Georges Bizet for a drama on a Provençal subject by Alphonse Daudet. According to musicologist Joseph Clamon, Bizet could find the melody of this march in a book published in 1864. After the failure of the drama, Bizet drew from the incidental music a suite for orchestra (Suite n° 1) which was an immediate success. In 1879, four years after the composer's death, his friend Ernest Guiraud produced a second suite (Suite n° 2) in which the March of the Kings is repeated in canon in the last part of the revised work.\nCertain passages are also found in the operetta Gillette de Narbonne by Edmond Audran, created in 1882. The words of a song \"M'sieu d'Turenne\", which can be sung to the tune of the March of the Kings, are due to :fr:Léon Durocher (1862-1918).\nThe March of the Kings has become a traditional chanson de France and one of the most common Christmas carols in the repertoire of French-speaking choirs. It has been performed several times by performers such as Tino Rossi, :fr:Les Quatre Barbus, Marie-Michèle Desrosiers or, in English, Robert Merrill. The piece has been adapted many times, notably by the organist Pierre Cochereau through an improvised toccata in 1973 for the Suite à la française sur des thèmes populaires.\nLyrics\nAbbot Domergue's original provençal text describes, at least in the first few stanzas, a sumptuous convoy accompanying three kings surrounded by bodyguards, from the perspective of a passerby who decides in the fourth stanza to join them. The rest of the song describe Casper and Melchior presenting their traditional gifts (gold and incense), and the seventh stanza is sung from the perspective of Balthazar, who presents the myrrh while prophecizing Christ's death on the cross. The eighth stanza refers to various biblical passages not related to the nativity.\n(Please note that the lyrics may be inaccurate and the song could use some further expansion)\n{|\n! French !!
