For a short time the academy was simply referred to as \"the girls' single gender academy,\" but it was later named by its first principal, Melody Morgan, in honor of the life and legacy of Coretta Scott King, the civil rights leader and wife of Martin Luther King Jr.\nAt its inception, the school served girls in grade 6 with plans for expansion to grade 12 by 2014. It graduated its first high school class in 2014. CSKYWLA is a public school in the Atlanta Public Schools system.\nAmong the staff and students, the acronym for the school's name, CSKYWLA (pronounced \"see-skee-WAH-lah\"), has been coined as a salutation given the definition \"to be empowered by scholarship, non-violence, and social change, my sister.\"\nSingle-gender education\nCSKYWLA was initiated by Atlanta Public Schools based on the research of Michael Gurian, who asserts that girls and boys have different learning styles. To this effect, teachers at CSKYWLA employ teaching strategies geared toward the general learning styles of girls.\nCurriculum\nStudents at CSKYWLA are immersed in a rigorous academic curriculum, which includes language arts, social studies, and reading.
