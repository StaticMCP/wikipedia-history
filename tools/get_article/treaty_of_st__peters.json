The treaty conducted on September 23, 1805, purchases two tracts of land: nine-square miles each at the confluence of the St. Croix River about what now is Hastings, Minnesota and the confluence of the Minnesota River with Mississippi about what now is Mendota, Minnesota, to establish military posts at each of the two sites. A military post was not established at the confluence of the St. Croix with the Mississippi, but Fort Snelling was established on the bluffs overlooking the confluence of the Minnesota with the Mississippi.  Though the treaty was never proclaimed by the President of the United States, it was ratified by the United States Congress on April 16, 1808.\n1837 Treaty of St. Peters\n*See White Pine Treaty\n1851 Treaty of St. Peters\n*See Treaty of Mendota\nSee also\n*Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v.
