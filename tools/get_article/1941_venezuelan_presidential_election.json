This presidential election, unlike the elections held since 1947, was indirect, that is, the voters were the deputies and senators of the Congress of Venezuela. The winner on this day was Isaías Medina Angarita with 120 votes, 87.6% of the seats in the Congress.\nBackground\nFollowing the death of President Juan Vicente Gómez, who was dictator of Venezuela from 1908 to 1935, General and Minister of Army and Navy Eleazar López Contreras assumed the presidency. Eleazar López Contreras attempted to mediate between the authoritarian processes of his predecessor, promoting democratic processes and political freedom for Venezuelans.\nIn July 1936 shortly after becoming President of Venezuela, President Eleazar López Contreras created a constitutional amendment limiting the presidential term from seven years down to five, applying this law upon himself as well. This constitutional decision led to the 1941 elections, where the Congress of Venezuela would determine the new President of Venezuela.\nResults\n|votes3=2\n|cand4=|votes4=1\n|cand5=José Izquierdo|votes5=1\n|source=Events\n}}\nReferences"
