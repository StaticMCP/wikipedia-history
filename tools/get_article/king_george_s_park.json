It was officially opened by King George V in 1923 and renamed in his honour.\nThe park previously contained a  long open-air swimming pool and children's paddling area constructed in 1936 which eventually closed in 1993 and the site redeveloped with an indoor tennis and bowls centre.\nIn the aftermath of World War II nearly 100 prefabricated houses were constructed in the middle of the park, providing homes to roughly 400 people. The buildings remained for 18 years before their eventual removal, at which point the land was returned to the park.\nIn June 1952 officers of Special Branch arrested Soviet agent William Martin Marshall in King George's Park.\nOne of the park's footpaths – Foster's Way – is named in honour of Victoria Cross recipient Edward Foster.\nDetails\nThe park is about  long, north–south, with an average width of . It covers approximately . The Wandle forms the eastern boundary.  It has three areas of approximately equal size. In the north is a leisure area; in the centre is a play area; in the south are sports fields.\nThe leisure area includes formal gardens, a bowling green, tennis courts, a wild-fowl lake (at one time with row boats), and shaded paths with many seats. As this is less than five minutes' walk from the main shopping area of Wandsworth, it is, in summer, a great place for eating picnic lunches.\nThe play area has a pavilion where children's play sessions are held (the One O'Clock Club). Also there is an ecological site and an adventure playground. There are paths for walking and for cycling, and a wide open grass field for ball sports, formal and informal.\nThe Wandle trail passes through the park. Along its path, it is possible to walk nearly  in a natural area save for crossing one minor road.\nThe park can be entered through gates at the north and south ends, and on the east via a footpath with its own bridge across the Wandle.\nReferences and footnotes\nExternal links\n* [https://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/parks-and-open-spaces/parks/king-georges-park/ King George's Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907091805/http://wgate.users.netlink.co.uk/kgp01.html Photos of the park]"
