In July 2023, Nenking announced that they wouldn't inject capital and the DNCG (the organization responsible for monitoring and overseeing the accounts of professional association football clubs in France) relegated Sochaux to National (French Football 3rd Division) due to their financial problems. The club now faces a potential Bankruptcy. As a result, the FC Sochaux-Montbelliard would lose its professional football club status and would be relegated to the 6th Division.\nWhile Romain Peugeot, the great-grandson of the club's founder, had concluded an agreement for a takeover offer allowing the group to remain a 33% shareholder of FC Sochaux-Montbelliard, Nenking did not respect his commitment to pay the 4 million euros planned. The objective of the operation was to avoid the bankruptcy of the club and to allow it to return to the French Ligue 2 championship.\nThe club was founded nearly a century ago by French automobile company Peugeot and they won the top division league title in the 1934–35 and 1937–38 seasons, the French League Cup in 2004 and the Coupe de France, the country's premier knockout cup competition, in 2007.\nThe Nenking company sold FC Sochaux on 25 August after causing a chaotic management situation that almost led to the demise of a club that was almost a hundred years old.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
