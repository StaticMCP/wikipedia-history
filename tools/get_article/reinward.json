      "text": "# Reinward\n\nReinward (d.  1150) was Bishop of Meissen from 1140 to 1150.\nHe also appears under the variants Reinwald, Reinbert, Rembert, Reinhard, Reinwert or Richard. In old lists of bishops he further appears, incorrectly, as Meinward, Meinwert, Meinhard or Menward for the period 1046 to 1056 and as Grambert, Grambor, Grambod or Grambrecht for the period 1118 to 1125.\nThere is no information available about Reinward's family background. Before becoming bishop he was a cathedral provost in Meissen Cathedral. He also experienced the Second Crusade.\nAs for the length of his episcopate, older authorities such as Fabricius maintained that Reinward died on 24 July 1146 and was succeeded by a Bishop Berthold. Machatschek however found no evidence of Berthold and concluded that Reinward died in about 1150 and was directly succeeded by Albrecht I.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Eduard Machatschek: Geschichte der Bischöfe des Hochstiftes Meissen in chronologischer Reihenfolge (...), pp. 111–116.
