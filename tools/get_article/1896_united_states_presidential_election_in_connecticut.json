Voters chose six representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nConnecticut voted for the Republican nominee, former Governor of Ohio William McKinley, over the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Representative from Nebraska William Jennings Bryan. McKinley won the state by a margin of 30.7%. This was the first time a Republican carried Connecticut in a presidential election since James A. Garfield did so 16 years earlier.\nWilliam Bryan, running on a platform of free silver, appealed strongly to Western miners and farmers in the 1896 election, but held little appeal in the Northeastern states like Connecticut.\nBryan would lose Connecticut to McKinley again four years later and would later lose the state again in 1908 to William Howard Taft.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Connecticut\nReferences"
