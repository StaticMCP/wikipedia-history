These were easily launched with just a few people, ideal to respond quickly to local emergencies.\nMore stations were opened, and in July 1967, the RNLI established South Queensferry Lifeboat Station, and a  Inshore lifeboat, the unnamed (D-145), was placed on service. The boathouse at Hawes Pier was previously the booking office for the North and South Queensferry ferry boats.\nAt the request of the branch, the station was renamed Queensferry Lifeboat Station in 1969.\nIn 1972, the  lifeboat was withdrawn, and replaced with the larger and faster twin-engined  RIB Major Osman Gabriel (B-505).\nAt 17:00 on 8 December 1974, the Queensferry lifeboat Major Osman Gabriel (B-505) was launched in cold dark conditions, and force 6–7 winds, to reports of a man in a small dinghy in difficult off Inchcolm island. Nearing the island, a large wave shorted out the radio and navigation lights. Firing a flare, the man was spotted on Swallow Craig rock. He had set out in his dinghy to attend to his boat, when he lost an oar. Bringing the lifeboat in as close as possible, the remaining two crew went ashore, and pulled the man's dinghy above the high water mark. The man was landed at Inchcolm at 17:40, the lifeboat returning to station at 18:45, For this service, Helm Ranald Mackay and his two crew were each presented with \"A Framed Letter of Thanks, signed by the Chairman of the Institution\".\nA new boathouse and station facilities were constructed and opened in 1989, and a boathouse extension was completed in 1998.\nQueensferry was the busiest lifeboat station in Scotland in 2010, launching 74 times, and rescuing 138 people.\nIn August 1911, due to construction works at the lifeboat station, members of the Queensferry lifeboat station attended Dundas Castle, home of station president Sir Jack Stewart-Clark , for the naming ceremony of their new  Inshore lifeboat, in the presence of HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. With a splash of whisky, the Duke named the lifeboat Jimmie Cairncross (B-851), after a Perth jeweller, a Life Governor of the RNLI, whose trust donated the funds to buy the boat.\nAll new facilities were provided in 2012, with the construction of a new station building, incorporating new crew facilities; changing and shower rooms; mechanic's workshop; boat hall for the  and launch tractor attached, allowing direct access to the river; training rooms; a Manager's office; and a crew room, with panoramic views of the River Forth estuary. A retail outlet was also provided.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Queensferry.\n*A Framed Letter of Thanks signed by the Chairman of the Institution\n::Ranald Durness Mackay, Helm – 1974\n::James Crichton Smith – 1974\n::Gordon Joseph McAlpine – 1974\n*Member, Order of the British Empire (MBE)\n::Thomas James Robertson, chairman, and former Lifeboat Operations Manager – 2010QBH\n*Long Service Award\n::Donald Quate, crew member, then Helm and later Deputy Launch Authority – 2016 (40 years)\n::Thomas James Robertson , chairman, and former Lifeboat Operations Manager – 2023 (50 years)\nQueensferry Lifeboats\nD-class lifeboats\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
