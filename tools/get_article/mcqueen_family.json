Marlena has several children by several different fathers, including daughters Kathleen, Myra, Reenie and son Louis. Marlena fell pregnant with Kathleen in her early 20s. She married a man named Reggie soon after. They had one daughter, Myra. Reggie and Marlena divorced after several arguments and affairs like every other McQueen\n. It is unknown who are the fathers of Kathleen, Reenie and Louis.\nAt age 14, Myra fell for the charms of Martin Brownlow and they began a relationship. They slept together and Myra fell pregnant by Martin, who left her. Ashamed of this, Marlena forced Myra keep her pregnancy a secret. When the baby arrived, Myra and Marlena left the baby, named Matthew, on the doorstep of a church with only a note as an explanation. The baby was subsequently put into care as Myra promised to return for her son one day. After this, Myra began a relationship with a man named Billy Alexander and became pregnant with her eldest daughter Jacqui one year after she had Matthew; Jacqui had always assumed she was the eldest. Myra chose to keep Jacqui instead of going through the pain of giving up another child. Myra had her second daughter with Billy one year later and named her Mercedes. Billy left Myra and his daughters soon after Mercedes was born. At aged 19, Myra gave birth to Tina following a one-night stand with a married man named Marvin Bassman who refused to be involved in his daughter's life. She named her daughter after Tina Turner. Later that year in 1985, Myra met Ricky Bowen and began a relationship with him. Myra had Carmel with Ricky. Two years later, while Ricky and Myra were on a break, she gave birth to a son called John Paul by a projectionist she met at a Chester cinema called Iain Naismith, however he left her so that he could transition into his female alter-ego, Sally St. Claire. Myra lied to Ricky and told him John Paul was his son. Finally, Myra had Michaela in 1991 by Ricky again. Ricky left the family in 1992 and later married and had another son named Richard.\nKathleen had one daughter who she named Theresa, Theresa's father was believed to be a man named Don, but it was later revealed that Billy Alexander was her father after Kathleen had a one-night stand with him at a nightclub. It is assumed Kathleen lied to Don about Theresa being his daughter.\nLouis went on to join the army and has a son who was also called Louis. Louis Sr. was killed in action, this inspired Louis Jr. to follow in his father's footsteps and enroll in the army too.\nReenie was repeatedly raped by Marlena's abusive boyfriend Derek Clough, which she kept a secret from the rest of her family; he impregnated her at 15 and she later gave birth to her daughter Porsche in 1991. Reenie was originally supposed to give Porsche up for adoption but decided against it. For years it was believed by everyone that Porsche's father was a boy named Mickey, who grew up in the same estate as the McQueens. Reenie had another two daughters with Porsche's presumed father Mickey. She gave birth to Celine in 1994 and then finally in 1998, she gave birth to Cleo. When the girls were young, Mickey was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. Reenie's boyfriend, Pete Buchanan, subjected Porsche, Celine and Cleo to varying levels of abuse, most notably sexually abusing Porsche and Cleo and damaging Celine's confidence. There was an incident one Christmas where Derek got excessively drunk and punched Marlena, ultimately breaking her jaw.\nMarguerite was married to a pig farmer and they had at least four children, including Breda, Victor and Valene. Marguerite's husband was a violent alcoholic who would beat her and their daughters Breda and Valene. He supposedly died after drunkenly falling down the stairs and hitting his head, but it was later revealed Breda murdered him. Their son Victor continually shamed and disappointed his family by getting involved in crime and drugs. Victor married a woman named Sarah in the late 1980s. Sarah gave birth to Victor's son Bart. Victor was an unfaithful husband which ruined his marriage. Sarah left when Bart was five. Soon after the breakdown of his marriage, Victor remarried a woman named Joan. Joan immediately took on the responsibility of being Bart's mother and stayed loyal to Victor and his son even though Victor took advantage of her good nature and found it difficult to stay faithful. Joan died in 2010.\nBreda became a nanny and was devoted to the children she cared for. She was also a strict Catholic woman, married to a man named Vinnie Bletcher. On Christmas Day 1986, while pregnant with her and Vinnie's daughter, Goldie, Breda brought toys to the home of her charge, three-year-old Peter, who was being raised by an abusive father called Wes after his mother, Harriet, abandoned them. Wes was about to hit Peter before Breda bludgeoned him over the head with an angel ornament. After murdering his father, Breda took Peter in and adopted him, renaming him Sylver. They lived on a farm but Vinnie became abusive towards his Sylver and Goldie. Adoptive second cousins, Sylver and Mercedes, lost their virginity to each other when they were 14 years old. Soon after, thirteen-year-old Goldie learns she is pregnant to boyfriend Shane Sweeney. When a drunken Vinnie discovered this, he went flew into a violent rage, threatening Goldie and her unborn baby. During a struggle, Sylver pushed Vinnie down the stairs. Believing he had killed his stepfather, a terrified Sylver called the police. When Breda discovered Vinnie was still alive, she delivered the fatal blow that killed him.

Mercedes' corpse is then seen being dragged out of the house, and the figure mopping up all of her blood. The figure is later revealed to be Freddie. Meanwhile, at the wake of Carmel's funeral, Porsche reveals that she was the culprit who stole Carmel's ring, and not Mercedes. The entire family then rush home to try and catch Mercedes in time, but when she is not there, they all believe she has left for Alicante. The following day, Phoebe is suspicious of Mercedes' whereabouts and calls the police, with old friend D.S Thorpe questioning Myra. She explains that Phoebe is just being over-dramatic, and when she spills a cup of tea, D.S Thorpe notices blood on the floor, and calls for forensic scientists.

Theresa explains that Carmel would have wanted her to become a good person, but Porsche reminds Theresa of the risks and if she dies, then who will look after her children. Theresa then tells Nico and Sienna that she cannot be a donor, with Sienna insulting Theresa. Afterwards, Theresa has a change of heart and decides to be Nico's donor, but after the operation, Theresa is given far too much morphine and has to be examined by Dr. Charles S'avage.
