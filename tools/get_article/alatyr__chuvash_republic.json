Population:  43,161 (2002 Census);  43,000 (1968).\nHistory\nAlatyr is one of the oldest towns in the republic. It was founded in 1552, succeeding the outpost of Kurmysh, which had served as the easternmost Russian outpost for two centuries. Alatyr originally served as a fortified outpost where an old Mordvin village once stood, and it was granted town status in 1780. Alatyr gained economic importance in 1894 after the construction of the Moscow—Ryazan—Kazan railroad.\nAdministrative and municipal status\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Alatyr serves as the administrative center of Alatyrsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of republic significance of Alatyr—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of republic significance of Alatyr is incorporated as Alatyr Urban Okrug.\nDemographics\n*Russians: 87.3%\n*Mordvins: 7.2%\n*Chuvash: 4.1%\n*Others: 1.4%\nGallery\nFile:Trinity Monastery Alatyr.jpg|\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://galatr.cap.ru/ Official website of Alatyr]\n*[https://alatyir.jsprav.ru/ Directory of organizations in Alatyr]"
