He played for South Africa, but not in Test cricket.\nA right-arm medium-pace bowler, Budgen had an outstanding match for Western Province in the 1910–11 Currie Cup, taking 4 for 26 and 7 for 30 (the last seven wickets of the match) in the innings victory over Griqualand West. When the Australian Imperial Force Touring XI played Western Province in October 1919, Budgen took 7 for 70 (all of them bowled) in the first innings of the match, which the Australians won by two wickets. A month later he was selected to play for South Africa in the second of the two matches against the AIF XI, and took two wickets, but the Australians won by an innings.\nBudgen took his best first-class figures in the 1921–22 season. Playing for Orange Free State in a Currie Cup match against Natal, he took 4 for 63 and 8 for 107, and Orange Free State won by 42 runs.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
