Voters chose 9 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nThe first readmission of Georgia to the Union occurred in 1868. The Seymour/Blair ticket carried the state of Georgia on election day. With 64.27% of the popular vote, Georgia would be Seymour's fourth strongest victory in terms of percentage in the popular vote after Kentucky, Louisiana and Maryland.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | United States presidential election in Georgia, 1868\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Horatio Seymour\n| align=\"right\" | 102,707\n| align=\"right\" | 64.27%\n| align=\"right\" | 9\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Ulysses S.
