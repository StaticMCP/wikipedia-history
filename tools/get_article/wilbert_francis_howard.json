He attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and the University of Manchester. He was a lay pastor in Tyneside for a year and then worked at Didsbury College as assistant to the president. In 1919, he was appointed New Testament tutor at Handsworth College, where he remained until retiring in 1951; he was the college's principal from 1943 to 1951. He was also president of the Methodist Conference in 1944 and, in a brief acting capacity, in 1946.\nAcademically, he was interested in New Testament scholarship and edited the second volume of J. H. Moulton's Grammar of New Testament Greek. He was the Dale Lecturer at Mansfield College, Oxford, in 1940, and in 1946–47 was Select Preacher at the University of Cambridge. He was awarded the Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies in 1947 and was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1949. He died on 10 July 1952.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* V.
