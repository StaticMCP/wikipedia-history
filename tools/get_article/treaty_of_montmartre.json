Based on the terms of the accord, Louis XIV was given control of the Duchy of Lorraine, and Charles IV's family would become princes in the French royal family. However, it failed to take hold and Charles IV publicly repudiated it.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/france/frroyal.htm The French Royal Family: Titles and Customs]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203024146/http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/bourbon/france/success/sucprt3.htm The French Succession: The Renunciations of 1712, The Treaties of Utrecht and their Aftermath in International Affairs]"
