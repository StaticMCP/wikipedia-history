A few days after PMF was established, a Team Media War was formed by the Iraqi government and affiliated with followers of President Haider al-Abadi, where it was adopted as a means of transmitting the events of the wars fought by the Popular Mobilization Forces. The main purpose of the formation of Team Media War was to spread propaganda by trying to influence people's opinions of PMF as some of the organisation's component militias are considered terrorist groups by some states, while others have been accused of sectarian violence.\nSee also\n* Hadi Al-Amiri\n* Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis\n* Qais Khazali\nReferences\nExternal links\n* * [http://al-hashed.net/ Official Website]"
