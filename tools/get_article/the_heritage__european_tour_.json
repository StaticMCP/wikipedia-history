The winner was Henrik Stenson, who finished four strokes ahead of Carlos Rodiles.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Year!!Winner!!Score!!To par!!Margin ofvictory!!Runner-up\n|-\n| 2004 ||  Henrik Stenson || align=center|269 || align=center|−19 || 4 strokes ||  Carlos Rodiles\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2004/tournamentid=2004061/index.html Event page on the official site of the European Tour]"
