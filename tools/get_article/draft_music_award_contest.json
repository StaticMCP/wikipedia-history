MAC was created with the aim of providing fair and impartial recognition to talented singers and songwriters who are not well-known enough to win major awards like the Grammys. The contest is unique in that it allows both lesser-known artists and globally recognized figures, such as Eminem, to compete on equal footing.\nWhile Rap is the dominant genre of the contest, MAC also features Hip-Hop, Pop, Greek Laika, and several other musical genres. The contest is invite-only, and only selected singers and musicians are eligible to participate each year. These participants are chosen based on their musical talent and previous recognition in the industry.\nFormat of the Competition\nIn its inaugural year, 2024, MAC had three main categories, with each category featuring four songs. The public and a panel of judges voted to determine the winners, with the final result being a combination of both public votes and judges’ decisions. This voting system ensures that the most deserving songs are awarded, offering a transparent and fair judgment process.\nThe competition is held entirely online, taking place through the official MAC website. The event occurs every year during the last week of December, ensuring that it becomes a highly anticipated event in the music industry. The winners are announced at the conclusion of the event, and each recipient is awarded a trophy to honor their success.\nAward Categories and Results (2024)\nIn 2024, the first-ever edition of the Music Award Contest featured the following categories and nominees:\nMAC Best Song of 2024\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Artist\n!Song Title\n!Result\n|-\n|Kendrick Lamar\n|Not Like Us\n|\n|-\n|Tommy Richman\n|Million Dollar Baby\n|\n|-\n|21 Savage\n|Redrum\n|\n|-\n|Hanumankind\n|Big Dawgs\n|\n|}\nMAC Best Song of the Decade\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Artist\n!Song Title\n!Result\n|-\n|The Weeknd\n|Blinding Lights\n|\n|-\n|Dua Lipa\n|Levitating\n|\n|-\n|Olivia Rodrigo\n|Good 4 U\n|\n|-\n|Olivia Rodrigo\n|Drivers License\n|\n|}\nAdditional Information\nThe Music Award Contest (MAC) is unique because it brings together both emerging artists and established names in the music industry, creating an inclusive environment for diverse genres and talents. The contest has quickly gained attention for its commitment to fair voting processes and its recognition of artists who may not have the platform to receive such awards in larger competitions.\nThe event has no external sponsors or media partners, ensuring that it remains independent and focused solely on the music and artists themselves. Every year, MAC promises to deliver a transparent and fair competition, with public votes being combined with those of expert judges to give a well-rounded final decision.\nAwards and Recognition\nWinners of the Music Award Contest receive an official MAC trophy, celebrating their achievements in the music world. The event not only serves as a recognition platform but also helps to provide exposure to talented artists who may not yet have the opportunity to showcase their work in larger, mainstream award shows.\n__FORCETOC__\n__NEWSECTIONLINK__"
