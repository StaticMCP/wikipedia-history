It was last located on Upper Dome Creek, shortly northeast of the mouth of Seattle Creek, about  north of Fairbanks, prior to its being scrapped c. 2012.  The dredge was manufactured by the Bethlehem Steel Company in 1928, shipped in pieces to Alaska, and assembled by the Fairbanks Exploration Company on Cleary Creek, where it was used until 1942.  It thereafter served on Eldorado Creek (1947–55) and Dome Creek (1955-59) before it was abandoned.\nThe dredge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska\nReferences"
