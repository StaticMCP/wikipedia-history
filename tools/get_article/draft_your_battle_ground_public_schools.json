      "text": "# Draft:Your Battle Ground Public Schools\n\n----\nYour Battle Ground Public Schools (Your BGPS) is a magazine-style publication released by Battle Ground Public Schools, spearheaded by local student, Rye Dilley.\nThe publication originated in 2009 as an insert in local newspaper, The Reflector. Ending in 2013, Your Battle Ground Public Schools was mostly lost to history. Only being rediscovered in Spring 2025 by a student at Tukes Valley Middle School, the old newspaper was rapidly revived, in the new form of a student-build magazine, and released its first issue on June 3, 2025.\nStaff\nYour Battle Ground Public Schools is a student-built publication staffed completely by pupils from across the district—not including the lone staff advisor, Amy Hanson.\nReferences"
