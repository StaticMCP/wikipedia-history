Voters chose eight representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nConnecticut voted for the Republican nominee, incumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower of Pennsylvania, over the Democratic nominee, former Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. Eisenhower ran with incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon of California, while Stevenson's running mate was Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee. Eisenhower won Connecticut by a margin of 27.46%, which made Connecticut 12% more Republican than the nation-at-large and Eisenhower's eighth-best state in the nation.\nTo date, this is the last time that the cities of Middletown, New Britain, and New Haven, as well as the town of Bloomfield voted Republican. In addition, this is the last election where a Republican candidate won more than 70% in any Connecticut county.\nConnecticut would not vote for a Republican presidential candidate again until Eisenhower's vice president, Richard Nixon, won the state in his re-election bid in 1972.\nResults\n}}\nBy county\n{| width=\"60%\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| County\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Dwight D.
