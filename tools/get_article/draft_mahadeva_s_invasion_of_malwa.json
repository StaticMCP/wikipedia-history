While the Yadava sources mentions the quite opposite of this that is Mahadeva of Devagiri being successful and Jayavarman II of Malwa submitting before him\nPrelude\nMahadeva, the Yadava ruler of Devagiri, had attempted to expand his domain by fighting his neighbors with mixed success.\nHis predeccessors, Krishna and Simhana had successfully campaigned against the Paramara dynasty. In order to mimic or even outshine his predeccessors, Mahadeva invaded the domain of the Paramara dynasty under Jayavarman II\nMeanwhile, in the Paramara realm, the Paramara ruler Jayavarman II had restored much of its lost fortunes for his successes against his neighbors, such as his victory over the Chandelas at Rahatgarh and his successes in Rajputana.\nWar\nMahadeva crossed the Narmada river in order to face the Paramaras in battle, but was defeated by Jayavarman, whose Mandhata inscription suggests that he forced Mahadeva back to the south of the bank, then continued to drive him south until the Tapi River after crossing the Vindhyas and Satpuras..\nAccording to D. C. Sircar, the \"Dakshinatya (Southern) king\" whom Jayavarman defeated was probably Ramachandra, who later defeated Jayavarman's successor Arjunavarman II. However, H. V. Trivedi argues that this is unlikely, because during the early part of his reign, Ramachandra was engaged in a conflict with his own brother Amana. The Dakshinatya king referred to here is probably Ramachandra's uncle Mahadeva. The Sangur inscription of the Yadavas refers to Mahadeva's invasion of Malwa.\nHemadri indicates that Mahadeva triumphed over the lord of Malwa but spared him due to his status as a minor. This lord is almost certainly Paramara Jayasimha II (1269–1274 CE), which implies that if Mahadeva did indeed attack him, it would have been at some point around 1269-1270 CE—just at the end of Mahadeva and at the beginning of Jayasimha's reign. The Sangur inscription, along with the two inscriptions from the Chitaldroog district of present-day Karnataka (both dated 1265 CE), indicates Mahadeva's engagement with Malwa as having wrestled with the region within contest. Two later inscriptions from the same district dated 1275 and 1280 CE took it a step further by indicating submission of the Malavas, which would support Hemadri's argument. It may also have been the case that, at least in the course of Mahadeva's campaign into Gujarat, that the Yadava army engaged the Paramaras.\nAftermath\nAfter the war, the Paramara realm reached the greatest territorial extent it had ever seen since the reign of Lakshmadeva, prior to the long decline of the reigns of Naravarman and his successors.\nReferences"
