      "text": "# Revolution Earth\n\n\"Revolution Earth\" is the fourth single released by the B-52's from their 1992 album Good Stuff.\nThe song's music video was directed by James Herbert. The single contains remixes of the song by Moby.\nComposition and recording\nThe song is an upbeat, folk influenced song, a radical stylistic departure for the B-52's. It is one of many songs with lyrics co-written with Robert Waldrop, a friend of the band.\nFeaturing Kate Pierson on lead vocals, \"Revolution Earth\" remains a fan favourite despite the fact that it is from an album featuring only three of the original five members of the band. With founding member Cindy Wilson absent from the recording, Pierson sings in harmony with herself - multi-tracking different vocal lines. Fred Schneider sings a brief backing vocal. As with many of the tracks from the Good Stuff album, \"Revolution Earth\" has a long and resounding intro and outro, as opposed to the band's earlier songs which always had a definite beginning and ending.\nLive performances\n\"Revolution Earth\" was regularly featured in the B-52's live shows from 1992 up until about 2002, and then again from 2015. Julee Cruise sang harmony during live performances until 1996 when Cindy Wilson rejoined the band. Live performances of the song from 2000 until 2002 were based on the  Mix, one of several remixes created by Moby, couched in a faster rhythm and featured Sara Lee (then bass player for the band) on backing vocals, along with Wilson.\nTracklisting\n;CD\n# Revolution Earth (Edit) – 4:08\n# Revolution Earth (CO2 Mix) – 8:33\n# Revolution Earth (Vibe Tribe Mix) – 4:53\n# Revolution Earth (PMM Dub) – 6:52\nCover versions\nThe song was covered on the Whirligig album Spin and featured Terre Roche.\nReferences"
