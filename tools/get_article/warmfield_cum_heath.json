The parish lies just over  east of Wakefield, and has 57 listed buildings within the parish boundaries.\nHistory\nIt had a population of 844 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 941 at the 2011 Census. Historically, the parish was within the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley, and until 1974 it formed part of Wakefield Rural District, It is now under the electoral ward of Normanton.\nThe parish consists of the villages of Warmfield in the east, Heath in the west, and Kirkthorpe in the north, and the hamlet of Goosehill north of Warmfield. Warmfield is derived the Old English of Wærna, meaning stallion open country, and Heath stems from the Old English of Hǣp, meaning heathland. The A655 road traverses the area of the parish from southwest to northeast, and the southwestern parish boundary follows the A638 road. North of Kirkthorpe, the railway between Wakefield and Normanton passes through the area, but there is no station. At Goosehill there was a junction with the North Midland Railway which opened in 1840, but this was closed as a through route in 1987.\nNeighbouring settlements are Agbrigg and Wakefield in the west, Normanton in the northeast, Streethouse in the east, New Sharlston in the southeast, and Walton in the south. The parish has 57 listed buildings; six are grade I, six are grade II*, and the rest are grade II.\nHeath Common was given registered common status in the late 19th century, and now forms part of a conservation area. Nikolaus Pevsner expresses surprise at the open plan common being just over a  from the industrial centre of Wakefield. Plans have been submitted to Wakefield Council to house a battery energy storage system (BESS) on the common, which is being opposed by the people who live in the area.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Population of Warmfield cum Heath 1801–2011\n!1801\n!1811\n!1821\n!1831\n!1841\n!1851\n!1861\n!1871\n!1881\n!1891\n!1901\n!1911\n!1921\n!1931\n!1951\n!1961\n!1971\n!2001\n!2011\n|-\n|625\n|639\n|741\n|752\n|829\n|805\n|783\n|927\n|977\n|1,067\n|1,126\n|1,152\n|1,094\n|953\n|964\n|983\n|822\n|841\n|944\n|}\nNotable people\n*Astronomer William Wales was baptised in the parish in 1734\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Warmfield cum Heath\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.wakefield.gov.uk/media/matjggof/heath-common-map.pdf Map of Heath Common]\n*[https://www.warmfieldcumheath.org.uk/ Parish council website]"
