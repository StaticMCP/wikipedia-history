It covers the Crayola brand of marking utensils, as well as the history of Binney & Smith, the company that created the brand and is currently a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards known as Crayola LLC.\nList of events\n1864–1900\n*1864: Joseph Binney founds Peekskill Chemical Works in Peekskill, New York, for producing carbon black.\n*1880:''' Joseph Binney sets up headquarters in New York City on 147 Maiden Ln, joined by son Edwin Binney and nephew C. Harold Smith.\n*1885: Joseph Binney retires; Edwin and C. Harold Smith, form a partnership and call their company Binney & Smith. Early products include red oxide pigment used in barn paint and carbon black used for car tires. During this time, Binney & Smith took an active role in the development and production of carbon black from natural gas, after natural gas deposits were found throughout Pennsylvania.\n*1889: Binney & Smith made yellow oxide pigment; the company produces three colors: Carbon black, yellow, and red.\n1900–1950\n*1900:\n**The company begins producing slate school pencils in its newly opened Easton, Pennsylvania mill.\n**Their carbon black wins the Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition.\n*1902: \"Binney & Smith Company\" is formed September 30, in Easton, Pennsylvania, and serves as general distributor for several carbon black producers, introducing Carbon black to other countries.  This also marks their first crayon product, the industry crayon \"Staonal\" in black. This crayon precedes the Crayola brand by a full year and still exists to this year.\n*1903: Noticing a need for safe, quality, and affordable wax crayons, the company produces their first boxes of crayons from the No. 30 box containing 30 unwrapped colors to the No. 51 box of 28 wrapped colors. The No. 54 box contains 8 classic colors and the first one sells for a nickel. A total of 40 colors are introduced including Black, Blue, Brown, Burnt Sienna, Burnt Umber (later retired in 1949), Celestial Blue (later retired in 1944), Charcoal Gray (later retired in 1910), Copper, Dark Blue (later Prussian Blue then Midnight Blue), Dark Green (later Pine Green), English Vermillion (later retired in 1935), Flesh Tint (later Flesh then Peach), Gold, Golden Ochre (later Gold Ochre then Maize, later retired in 1990) Green, Indian Red (later Chestnut), Lemon Yellow (was once later Light Yellow, later retired in 1990), Light Blue (was once later Cobalt Blue, later retired in 1958), Madder Lake (later retired in 1935), Medium Green (later retired in 1939), Medium Yellow (later Goldenrod), Olive Green, Orange, Permanent Geranium Lake (later retired in 1910), Permanent Magenta (later Magenta), Raw Sienna, Raw Umber (later retired in 1990), Red, Rose Pink (later Carnation Pink), Sea Green, Sepia, Silver, Ultramarine Blue (later retired in 1958), Van Dyke brown (later retired in 1910), Venetian Red (later retired in 1949), Violet, White, and Yellow.\n*1904: Binney & Smith wins the Gold Medal during the April 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Their entry was actually for their An-Du-Septic dustless chalk, but it was the foundation of their \"Gold Medal\" packaging in which they featured the gold medal on the front of their crayon boxes for the next 50 or so years. Given that this award wasn't given out until April 1904 and Crayola had been selling since August 1903, it is a misconception that the famous box shown on the postage stamp and in numerous other historical articles and web pages is \"the\" actual first design of their Crayola boxes because the box shown in all of those pictures has that Gold Medal on the front.\n*1905: Binney redesigns their 8-color assortment to use the famous \"Gold Medal\" label and design. They also renamed the box to be the No. 8, following an earlier such introduction by the Franklin Mfg. Co. for their Rainbow line of crayons. This first and only Gold Medal box used the Eagle side of the Gold Medal and was the only assortment size to use this side of the medal, as it was changed to the other side before they expanded the line to other assortment sizes in 1910.  This also marks the year that they introduced Spectra, a pastel crayon line.\n*1907: Binney & Smith partnered with Milton Bradley to produce the Crayola No. 77 assortment box with Milton Bradley printed on the box also.\n*1908: Binney & Smith partnered with Littlefield Maps to make a special color assortment of their Rubens-Crayola No. 12 box with special Biblical colors pasted on the back to accommodate church work on their Old Testament maps.\n*1909: Binney & Smith launched their Durel line of pressed crayons\n*1910:\n**Binney & Smith expands their Gold Medal line to include the debut of their No. 16 box (which also followed an earlier debut of a 16-color assortment by Franklin Mfg. Co.).  They also discontinued many of their original boxes in favor of standardizing more to this Gold Medal line.\n**Three crayon colors are discontinued: Charcoal Gray, Permanent Geranium Lake, and Van Dyke Brown.\n**Raw Sienna becomes unavailable until 1958.\n*1911: Binney & Smith launch their Cerola brand of crayons targeted toward the lower end quality but more affordable markets\n*1912: Binney & Smith's carbon black is first used on tires to make black tires. They also launched their Cerata brand of crayons.\n*1913: Marks the launch of the Little Folks outfit boxes (Nos. 25 & 50) along with a Picture Tracer box.\n*1915: The Boston crayon line debuts.  This also marks the discontinuation of the No. 101 assortment box that contained Gold, Silver and Copper crayon colors.  While Gold and Silver was available as a bulk purchase, these three original colors couldn't be found on a retail assortment box for the next 30 years. Copper goes away until 1958.\n*1919: The design of their Gold Medal boxes is changed to drop the Paris reference.
