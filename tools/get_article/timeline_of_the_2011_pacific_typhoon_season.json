Most of the tropical cyclones formed between May and November 2011. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator between 100°E and the International Date Line. Tropical storms that form in the entire Western Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Tropical depressions that form in this basin are given a number with a \"W\" suffix by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). In addition, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones (including tropical depressions) that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility. These names, however, are not in common use outside of the Philippines.\nDuring the season, a total of 40 systems were designated as Tropical Depressions by either the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), or other national meteorological and hydrological services such as the China Meteorological Administration and the Hong Kong Observatory. Because the JMA runs the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for the Western Pacific, it assigns names to Tropical Depressions should they intensify into a tropical storm. PAGASA also assigns local names to tropical depressions which form within their area of responsibility; however, these names are not in common use outside of PAGASA's area of responsibility.\nFor the PAGASA, 19 systems formed or entered in area of responsibility during 2011, which 10 of them directly made landfall over the Philippines. No tropical cyclones formed during January to March. The season started on April 1 with the formation of Tropical Depression 01W.\nTimeline\nImageSize = width:1030 height:250\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:2 left:30

Philippines, with PAGASA predicting of naming it in the next few days.\n;December 10\n*0300 UTC&nbsp;- The LPA weakened as the JTWC cancelled a TCFA, due to cold air wrapping the system.\n*2100

at water and affecting southeast Asia.\n;December 14\n*0000 UTC&nbsp;- 26W's circulation became exposed as it dissipated over waters.\n*1200 UTC&nbsp;- The JTWC upgrades it to Tropical Storm 27W.\n;December 15\n*0300 UTC&nbsp;- PAGASA issues its first warning on tropical storm 27W, as it named it Sendong as a tropical storm too.\n*0900 UTC&nbsp;- JMA upgrades Sendong to a tropical storm too, with the latter naming it as Washi.\n;December 16\n*0900 UTC&nbsp;- Washi makes landfall over Surigao del Sur.\n*1200 UTC&nbsp;- Due to land reaction, it weakened but still a storm.\n;December 18\n*0000 UTC&nbsp;- Washi finishes affecting the Philippines as it moves away from the PAR.\n;December 19\n*1500 UTC&nbsp;- Washi weakens to a low-pressure area with a total of 1,200 fatalities over the Philippines.\n;December 30\n*2230 UTC&nbsp;- The last depression formed  to the northeast of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n;December 31\n*1800 UTC&nbsp;- The system last noted by the JMA as the next season started.\n*The 2011 Pacific typhoon season officially ends as the 2012 Pacific typhoon season officially begins.\nSee also\n*2011 Pacific typhoon season\n*2011 Pacific hurricane season\n*2011
