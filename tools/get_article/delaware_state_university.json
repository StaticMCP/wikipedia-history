DSU also has two satellite campuses: one in Wilmington and one in Georgetown. The university encompasses four colleges and a diverse population of undergraduate and advanced-degree students. Delaware State University is classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\".\nHistory\n19th century\nThe Delaware College for Colored Students was established on May 15, 1891, by the Delaware General Assembly. The name was changed to the State College for Colored Students by state legislative action in 1893 to eliminate confusion with Delaware College, which was attended by whites in Newark, Delaware.  It first awarded degrees in 1898.\n20th century\nIn 1945, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education awarded the college provisional accreditation. Three years later, the institution became Delaware State College by legislative action. Although its accreditation was revoked in 1949, it was regained in 1957.\nOn July 1, 1993, the institution changed its name yet again, this time to Delaware State University. Delaware State University is one of the first historically black colleges and universities to have a no-smoking policy.\n21st century\n2007 shooting\nOn September 21, 2007, two 17-year-old Delaware State University freshmen were shot on campus. One died 32 days later on October 23, from critical injuries sustained in the attack. A freshman student from East Orange, New Jersey, Loyer D. Braden, was arrested and charged with murder.\nOther events\nIn 2015, the university began phasing out smoking on campus by restricting it to four designated areas and providing educational resources on smoking cessation tools and programs.  In August 2015 it implemented a completely tobacco-free policy.\nIn 2017, the university received the ACAS Health Leadership Award in recognition of its efforts.  The award was jointly presented by the Public Health Service Officers Foundation for the Advancement of Public Health, the Truth Initiative, Arizonans Concerned About Smoking and the Arizona NAACP.\nIn December 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $20 million to Delaware State University. Her donation is the largest single gift in the university's history.\nOn July 1, 2021, Delaware State University officially finalized its acquisition of Wesley College, a 157-year-old private institution founded by the Methodist Church in 1873. This acquisition makes Delaware State the first historically Black university to acquire an institution that is not a historically Black college or university.\nThe university has renamed the former Wesley campus \"DSU Downtown\", reflecting its close proximity to downtown Dover, Delaware, and has relocated most of its College of Health and Behavioral Science (Public and Allied Health, Psychology, and Social Work programs on that additional 41-acre site. That academic division has been renamed the Wesley College of Health and Behavioral Sciences as a way to preserve the history of the former Wesley College.\nCampus\nThe  main campus in Dover, the capital of Delaware, is approximately a two-hour drive from Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., and three hours from New York City. The university has two satellite campuses located in Wilmington and Georgetown.\nThe main campus in Dover contains thirty buildings, including:\n* Administration Building\n* Alumni Stadium\n*Memorial Hall\n* The Bank of America Building\n* Delaware Hall\n* The Education and Humanities Building & Theatre\n* Loockerman Hall – listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\n* The Mishoe Science Center\n* Price Building\n* Willam C. Jason Library\n* The Wellness and Recreation Center\n* The Optical Science Center for Applied Research\nOn the main campus there are five main campus traditional residential halls and three apartment-style residence halls for upperclassmen on campus. Off-campus there is an apartment complex and an residential hall. In addition, the university has activated two residential halls at DSU Downtown (the former Wesley College campus). The residential facilities include:\n* Harriet Tubman-Lydia Laws Hall\n* Jenkins Hall\n* Medgar Evers Hall\n* Wynder Towers\n* The Living and Learning Commons (off campus)\n* University Courtyard Apartments (off campus)\n* University Village Complex\n* Warren-Franklin Hall\n* Malmberg Hall (DSU Downtown)\n* Zimmerman Hall (DSU Downtown)\nTwo dining halls serve the more than 1,500 on-campus students.\nAs a part of the Internet2 initiative, the university maintains several research computer laboratories including a high-performance computational cluster in its DESAC center. Almost every building has a computer lab and each student has a dedicated data port for internet access, their own phone, a campus email address, and cable television access in all residence hall rooms. Most campus buildings also offer wireless connectivity.\nDSU is one of 148 schools in the country to receive Tree Campus USA recognition from the Arbor Day Foundation. The university owns two farms near Kenton and Smyrna, and has an Airway Science Program based at Delaware Air Park in Cheswold.\nAdministration\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ Presidents\n!

Three months into his presidency, Allen ended in-person classes and residential operations on campus following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the faculty began offering curriculum online. The university raised $1.5 million for a Student Emergency Relief Fund to address student needs brought on by COVID-19 crisis. Although the COVID-19 crisis continued throughout the year, Allen and the university reopened its residential halls for the fall semester 2020, allowing more than 1,700 students to resume their residency on campus while almost all classes continued to be held virtually.\nThe business and affairs of the university are governed by the board of trustees. The board of trustees has all the powers accorded it by Title 14, Chapter 65 of the Delaware Code. The board consists of 15 members whose appointment or election is provided for in the Delaware Code and the governor of the state and the president of the university who are ex officio members with voting rights.\nAcademics\nJoe Biden delivering the commencement speech in May 2016]]\nThe university consists of four colleges:\n*College of Agriculture, Science & Technology\n*College of Humanities, Education & Social Sciences\n*College of Business\n*College of Health & Behavioral Sciences\nDSU offers 46 undergraduate degrees, 21 graduate degrees, and six doctoral degrees (interdisciplinary applied mathematics and mathematical physics, applied chemistry, neuroscience and optics, integrative agriculture, food & environment, and educational leadership).

About 80 percent of first-year undergraduates receive need-based financial aid. It has a traditional Honors Program and a Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) Honors Program to increase the number of students in science interested in pursuing biomedical research and obtaining doctor of philosophy degrees in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, and biopsychology.\nIn addition to satisfying the requirements for the major or majors and any minor, all undergraduates are required to complete the General Education Program, which includes: seven core courses, twelve foundation courses (across the curriculum), and the Senior Capstone Experience.\nAccreditations include the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN), the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), the Accreditation Council for Programs in Hospitality Administration (ACPHA), the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), and the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetic Education (CCDE).
