The settlement originally came about as a result of gold discoveries in the region in the late 1900s and the arrival of prospectors. These events and increasing contact with Europeans were accompanied by a breakdown of the traditional lifestyle of the Aboriginal people living in the area. Later a food depot was established by the government and Mulga Queen became established as a semi permanent camping ground for Aboriginal people.\nGovernance\nThe community is managed through its incorporated body, Nurra Kurramunoo Aboriginal Corporation, incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 on 9 September 1987.\nTown planning\nMulga Queen Layout Plan No.1 has been prepared in accordance with State Planning Policy 3.2 Aboriginal Settlements. Layout Plan No. was endorsed by the community on 8 September 2001 and the Western Australian Planning Commission on 18 June 2002.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://register.oric.gov.au/document.aspx?concernID=100592 Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations]"
