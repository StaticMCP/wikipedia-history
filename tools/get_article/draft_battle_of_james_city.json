It was the opening engagement of the Bristoe campaign during the American Civil War. Commanding the Union forces was Gen. Judson Kilpatrick while J.E.B. Stuart  led the Confederate forces.\nBackground\nIn August 1863, after the retreat at the Battle of Gettysburg the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee withdrew across the Rapidan River Lee sent his First Corps under Gen. Longstreet  south to Tennessee. Longstreet's timely arrival helped Confederate forces achieve a victory at the Battle of Chickamauga. After the Confederate victory at Chickamauga, Gen. Halleck ordered Gen. Meade to transfer the Union XI and XII Corps to Washington, D.C.. They would eventually be transported by rail to Tennessee.\n. In the fall of 1863, Lee knew that with Meade's army reduced by two Corps, now would be the time to move. He sent Stuart to screen his army and attack the Union signal station at to capture the Federal signal station atop of Thoroughfare Mountain.\nBattle\nAt 3:00 a.m. on October 10, 1863, Stuart's forces moved across the Robertson River. The primary Confederate attack happened around 6:30 a.m. when James B. Gordon's brigade attacked the 5th New York Cavalry Regiment at Russell's Ford. The Confederate cavalry pushed the 5th New York back to Bethesaida Church. Already stationed at the church, was the 120th New York Infantry Regiment. Stuart commanded his men to attack the New Yorkers and sent Pierce M. B. Young's men to attack their flank.  The fight at the church happened fast. The 120th New York held off Stuart's men for an hour but eventually collapsed and the men ran, having suffered heavy casualties.  Stuart's cavalry continued towards James City. Kilpatrick's main force was stationed there. Kirkpatrick realized that he was dealing with a large number of Stuart's forces. He called on Henry Prince's infantry for support but Prince did not move.  Stuart moved up his artillery and traded fire with the Union gunners. Prince's men eventually moved forward. In the afternoon, around 4 p.m.,  Custer charged with the 5th Michigan Cavalry but told a volley from the 1st South Carolina cavalry. Stuarts men held.  Custer eventually retreated. In the morning of the 11th, Stuart realized that Kikpatrick and the Union infantry had withdrawn from his front.\nReferences\nNotes"
