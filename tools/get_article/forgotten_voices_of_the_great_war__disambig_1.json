The Museum oral archive has become an important archive of its kind in the world, with thousands of hours of footage.  Authors have occasionally been granted access to the vaults.\nCirca 2000, the Museum allowed the author and a team of researchers access to the complete audio tapes.  Arthur in the writings put the interviews into chronological and campaign order, and provided some context about the events that surround the memories.\nThe book includes testimonies from\nTom Adlam (Victoria Cross awardee),\nHorace Birks,\nEdmund Blunden (poet and author, Military Cross awardee),\nGodfrey Buxton,\nCharles Carrington (under-age enlistee, Military Cross awardee),\nMontagu Cleeve (artillery officer),\nNorman Demuth (under-age enlistee),\nMabel Lethbridge (munitions factory worker, youngest-then British Empire Medal awardee),\nReginald Leonard Haine (Victoria Cross awardee),\nCecil Arthur Lewis (fighter ace, Military Cross awardee),\nPhilip Neame (Victoria Cross awardee),\nKeith Officer (an Australian who served with the Australian Imperial Force),\nHarry Patch (last surviving trench combat soldier of the war),\nEdward Spears (military liaison English–French translator),\nHenry Williamson (gassed and medically discharged), and\nDouglas Wimberley (Military Cross awardee).\nThe book has subsequently been dramatised for the stage as Forgotten voices by the playwright Malcolm McKay by 2006.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044740/http://www.forgottenvoices.co.uk/ Forgotten Voices website]\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk Imperial War Museums website]\n* [https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/max-arthur-interview Oxford University podcast] interview with the author"
