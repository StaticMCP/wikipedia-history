Located in the state capital city of Dover on Legislative Avenue, it houses the chambers and offices of the Delaware General Assembly.  It was designed in the Colonial Revival architecture style by E. William Martin and Norman M. Isham, and built 1931–1933, with wings added in 1965–1970 and 1994.\nArchitects\nThe building was built of red brick with white wooden trim, designed in the Colonial Revival style by E. William Martin and Norman M. Isham, under the direction of the State Buildings and Grounds Commission, created by Governor C. Douglass Buck in 1931 during the Great Depression. Initially the commission was awarded to Isham, but his appointment was protested by Alfred Victor Du Pont (on the grounds that Isham was not a resident of Delaware); therefore, local architect Martin was brought in. The influence of Isham is clear when one notes the resemblance of many architectural details to Old Colony House in Newport, Rhode Island, a building which Isham had also restored in 1932.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.state.de.us/research/Tour/default.shtml Delaware Legislative Hall]\n*[https://history.delaware.gov/old-state-house/ State House Museum] ()"
