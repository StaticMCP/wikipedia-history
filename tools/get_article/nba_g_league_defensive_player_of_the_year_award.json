      "text": "# NBA G League Defensive Player of the Year Award\n\nThe NBA G League Defensive Player of the Year is an annual NBA G League award given since the league's inaugural season to the best defensive player of the regular season. The league's head coaches determine the award by voting and it is usually presented to the honoree during the D-League playoffs.\nThrough the 2020–21 season, three players have been named the Defensive Player of the Year more than once: Derrick Zimmerman (2005, 2006), Stefhon Hannah (2012, 2013) and DeAndre Liggins (2014, 2016). Six international players have been named recipients: Stéphane Lasme (Gabon), Mouhamed Sene (Senegal), Walter Tavares (Cape Verde), Landry Nnoko (Cameroon), Chris Boucher (Canada), and Christ Koumadje (Chad). Jeff Myers was the inaugural winner while playing for the Greenville Groove.\nWinners\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#CFECEC;\" | †\n|Denotes a tie for the Defensive Player of the Year Award\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
