In addition to the firemen, many people lost their lives and extensive property damage.\nDedicated to Belas' Volunteer Firefighters, the monument was officially dedicated on 24 November 2002, with the presence of the Secretário de Estado adjunto do Ministério da Administração Interna (Adjunct-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Internal Administration), Luís Pais de Sousa and president of the municipality, Fernando Seara, along with other politicians, dignitaries and officials, marking the 35th anniversary of the tragedy. In a speech addressing the crowd, the president of the parish council, Guilherme Dias, reminded the crowd that the statute \"served to demonstrate to the people, the respect [we] have for the firefighters. At the bottom we transform in bronze our collective sentiment\". In addition to the inauguration, the event served to inaugurate the new vehicles and forest-fighting equipment, ambulances and generators that were acquired for the institution.\nA medal was impressed officially to honour the firefighters and pay homage to the people who died in the tragedy.\nThe monument was designed and created by the artist Bottelho.\nSee also\n* List of firefighting monuments and memorials\nReferences"
