He played a season for the Detroit Falcons of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), the league that would later become the modern NBA.\nAfter a college career at the University of Michigan, King signed with the Falcons in 1946. King (who would later prove successful in business) negotiated roles as publicity director, business manager and travelling secretary for the team. This combination of duties netted him an annual salary of $16,500, making him the highest paid player in the league, despite averaging only 5.1 points per game on the season.\nKing was married to Canadian figure skater and Olympic gold medallist, Barbara Ann Scott.\nBAA career statistics\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 90%; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#f2f2f2; border:1px solid #aaa;\"| Legend\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f2f2f2; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;GP\n| Games played\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f2f2f2; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;FG%&nbsp;\n| style=\"padding-right: 8px\" | Field-goal percentage\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f2f2f2; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;FT%&nbsp;\n| Free-throw percentage\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f2f2f2; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;APG&nbsp;\n| Assists per game\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f2f2f2; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;PPG&nbsp;\n| Points per game\n|}\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!
