A design was brought forward the following year by Lafaye & Lafaye. J.J. McDevitt built the memorial in 1935. The cornerstone was laid by The American Legion's Wyndham Manning and contains a complete listing of all the South Carolina citizens involved in World War I. The memorial was dedicated on May 30, 1935.\nThe structure is modeled on a Roman or Greek temple. Construction is of granite and limestone. On the face of the entrance are six columns with three windows set between the central four columns. The building also features engravings over the entrance and on either side of the main doorway.\nUses\nAside from being a monument to South Carolina's veterans, the building was also meant to function as office space. The Historical Commission became the first tenant, but outgrew the space, as the second floor was designated as a chapel and its office space housed the American Legion Auxiliary. The Historical Commission began seeking a new building in 1947. In 1960, the structure began housing the University of South Carolina's International Studies department. 1971 saw the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room and Museum take up residence in the building. The Confederate Relic Room was housed here for three decades. Today, the building houses University of South Carolina Publications\nGallery\nFile:Pendleton Street Side of World War Memorial in Columbia, South Carolina.jpg|Pendleton Street Sidewall (north-facing)\nFile:World War Memorial, Columbia SC, West view 20160702 1.jpg|Entrance (west-facing)\nReferences"
