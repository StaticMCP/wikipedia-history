At a young age he went to see above the British ship Ewardina that cruised between the UK and Rangoon, until she sank while he was on leave in Liverpool. Donnér began studying art at Valand Academy in Gothenburg, which was followed by a ten-year period, 1910–1920, in Copenhagen where he made the acquaintance of the Swedish female author Ulla Bjerne. In the years 1920–1922 he was in Paris, where he studied under L'hote and Arogeau, and later returned to Paris and travelled extensively in the Mediterranean.\nArtistic career\nDuring his stay in Copenhagen Donnér made his name as an illustrator drawing humorous cartoons for the Danish newspaper Politiken, and later worked for Dagens Nyheter and Stockholms-Tidningen. From 1919 onwards he began to focus more on painting works of art, with his art being exhibited in Stockholm in 1940, in Örebro in 1941 and in Norrköping and Västerås in 1942. His works contained sailing and Mediterranean motifs.\nPersonal life\nIn 1915 he was married to Cätschen Looft, and from 1930 to 1938 to Astrid Cassel.\nReferences"
