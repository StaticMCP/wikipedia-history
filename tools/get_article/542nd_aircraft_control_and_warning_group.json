It was last assigned to the 28th Air Division, stationed at Hamilton Air Force Base, California. It was inactivated on 6 February 1952.\nThis command and control organization was responsible for Aircraft Control and Warning (Radar) stations along the West Coast.  On 27 April 1950, the reserve 566th AC&WG was activated as a Corollary unit at Hamilton, sharing the 542d's equipment and facilities.  The 566th was called to active duty on 10 May 1951 and was inactivated, with its personnel used as fillers for the 542d.
