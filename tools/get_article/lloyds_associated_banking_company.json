Operating principally in the London inter-bank sterling market, it matched deposits and loans closely, thus minimising its exposure to risk. In 1982, Lloyds Associated Banking Company was renamed Lloyds Bank (LABCO) Limited and, in 1985, it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Lloyds Merchant Bank Holdings as a primary market maker in the new gilt-edged market, under the name Lloyds Merchant Bank (Government Bonds) Limited.\nLloyds Merchant Bank\nLloyds' merchant banking activities included capital markets, corporate finance, development capital, export and project finance, and investment management services. Lloyds Merchant Bank Limited ceased to operate as a separate business unit in 1993, but the parent bank's activities, which were re-organised around market segments, continued in development capital, investment management and stockbroking.\nSee also\n*Lloyds Development Capital\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://commercialbanking.lloydsbank.com/home/ Lloyds Bank Commercial Bank]"
