He collaborated with John Wayne on 12 projects, starting with Angel and the Badman (which he also directed) in 1947 through Circus World in 1964. Support Your Local Gunfighter was released in 1971, five years after his death.\nBiography\nBorn in Chicago, Grant was originally a journalist in his home town. He wrote a short story, \"The Whipsaw\", for the 11 Aug 1934 issue of Liberty, which was turned into a movie with Spencer Tracy and Myrna Loy launching his screenwriting career.\nGrant wrote numerous short stories that were published in Argosy, The Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan, and Liberty, among others.\nHe also wrote a play, Plan M.\nJohn Wayne called Grant \"a dear friend\", and said of him:\nHe had a great talent as a writer. Jimmy was a short-story writer. Now a short story writer doesn't have all the voluminous language that dulls a scene. He had to make the dialogue give character to a person and progress the story, and that's practically what Ford as a director did all the time. Ford cut through the nuance and all that crap and got down to the basic story. He put the nuance in with the camera. Jimmy was a writer of the same type ... I knew Jimmy Grant for twenty years. It's very handy to have somebody like that. You know with writers, you don't have enough contact with them.\nA chain smoker, Grant died from lung cancer in Burbank, California.\nHe owned a cattle ranch in Winton in Merced County from the 1940s until his death.\nAwards\nGrant won the Bronze Wrangler, an annual award presented by the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum, twice, for The Alamo in 1961 and The Comancheros the following year. William Bowers and he were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Sheepman in 1959.\nAdditional filmography\n* Big Brown Eyes (1936)\n* Great Guy (1936)\n* Danger - Love at Work (1937)\n* ''We're Going to Be Rich (1938)\n* Josette (1938)\n* Miracles for Sale (1939)\n* Boom Town (1940)\n* Music in My Heart (1940)\n* Johnny Eager (1942)\n* Incendiary Blonde (1945)\n* Angel and the Badman (wrote + Directed) (1947)\n* Sands of Iwo Jima (1949)\n* Johnny Allegro (story) (1949)\n* California Passage (1950)\n* Bullfighter and the Lady (1951)\n* Flying Leathernecks (1951)\n* Big Jim McLain (1952)\n* Hondo (1953)\n* Trouble Along the Way (uncredited) (1953)\n* Ring of Fear (original screenplay + Director)  (1954)\n* The Last Wagon (1956)\n* Good-bye, My Lady (1956)\n* Three Violent People (1956)\n* The Proud Rebel (1958)\n* The Barbarian and the Geisha (uncredited)  (1958)\n* The Alamo (1960)\n* The Comancheros (1961)\n* Donovan's Reef (1963)\n* McLintock!
