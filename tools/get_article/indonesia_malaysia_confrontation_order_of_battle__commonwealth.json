Those marked * were based in UK.  The conditions for the BORNEO clasp were 30 days service ashore in Brunei, Sabah or Sarawak or afloat in coastal waters or one operational flying sortie in support of operations ashore.  In addition the MALAY PENINSULA clasp was awarded for 30 days service ashore in the Malay Peninsula or Singapore or afloat in their waters or carrying out 30 air patrols over the land area between 17 August 1964 and 11 August 1966.\nIn addition to the units listed below, between 1963 and 1966 there were up to 80 ships from the Royal Navy, Royal Australian Navy, Royal Malay Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy. Most of these were patrol craft, minesweepers, frigates and destroyers patrolling the coast-line to intercept Indonesian insurgents. One of the two Commando Carriers, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, was also committed throughout the period of Confrontation usually in their transport role for troops, helicopters and army aircraft between Singapore and Borneo.\nAn indication of relative effort is 'infantry battalion months' for the last 12 months of the war in Sarawak and Sabah. Of the 144 such months 36 were Malaysian, 48 Gurkha, 52 British, 4 Australian and 4 New Zealand.\nUnited Kingdom\n* Royal Navy\n** HMS Woolaston M1194\n** HMS Triumph A108\n** HMS Albion\n** HMS Bulwark\n** HMS Victorious\n** HMS Centaur\n** ((HMS Chichester (F59)(HMS Chichester)\n** HMS Eagle\n** HMS Kent\n** HMS Hampshire\n** HMS Cavendish\n** HMS Caesar\n** HMS Cambrian (D85)\n** HMS Berwick\n** HMS Dido\n** HMS Fiskerton\n** HMS Maryton\n** PLUS: 17 other Destroyers and Frigates, twelve Minesweepers and five Submarines.\n** 40 Commando Royal Marines stationed at HMS Sembawang, Singapore\n** 42 Commando Royal Marines stationed at HMS Sembawang\n** Sections of Special Boat Service\n** Detachments of 845 Naval Air Squadron (Wessex) stationed at HMS Simbang, Singapore\n** Detachments of 846 Naval Air Squadron (Whirlwind) stationed at HMS Simbang\n** Detachments of 848 Naval Air Squadron (Wessex) stationed at HMS Simbang\n** 849 NAS Fairey Gannet AEW on HMS Victorious\n* British Army\n** Squadron of Life Guards\n** Squadrons of 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards*\n** Squadrons of Queen's Royal Irish Hussars\n** Squadrons of 4th Royal Tank Regiment\n** H Squadron of 5th Royal Tank Regiment*\n** V Light, 132 (Bengal Rocket Troop) Medium Batteries (of 6th Light Regiment Royal Artillery)\n** T (Shah Sujah's Troop) and 9 (Plassey) Light Air Defence Batteries (of 12th Light Air Defence Regiment)\n** 30 Light Anti Defence Battery (Roger's Company) (of 16th Light Air Defence Regiment)*\n** 53 (Louisburg) Light Anti Aircraft Battery (now 53 (Louisburg) Battery RA of 22nd Light Air Defence Regiment* (disbanded 2004))\n** 11 (Sphinx) Light Anti Defence Battery (of 34th Light Air Defence Regiment)*\n** 40th Light Regiment Royal Artillery (comprising 38 (Seringapatum), 129 (Dragon), 137 (Java) Light Batteries)*\n** 70 Light, 176 (Abu Klea) Light, 170 (Imjin) Medium Batteries (of 45th Field Regiment Royal Artillery)\n** 8 (Alma), 7 (Sphinx), 79 (Kirkee), 145 (Maiwand), Commando Light Batteries (of 29th and 95th Commando Light Regiments, Royal Artillery)\n** 1st Battalion, Scots Guards\n** Guards Independent Parachute Company\n** 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers*\n** 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders*\n** 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles*\n** 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Highlanders\n** 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Buffs, The Royal Kent Regiment\n** 1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry\n** 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders\n** 1st Battalion, Royal Leicestershire Regiment\n** 1st Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry\n** 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd)\n** 2nd Green Jackets, The King's Royal Rifle Corps\n** 3rd Green Jackets, The Rifle Brigade\n** 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment*\n** D Company, 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment*\n** 1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment*\n** 22 Special Air Service Regiment*\n** 1st and 2nd Battalions of 2nd Gurkha Rifles\n** 1st and 2nd Battalions, 6th Gurkha Rifles;\n** 1st and 2nd Battalions, 7th Gurkha Rifles;\n** 1st and 2nd Battalions, 10th Gurkha Rifles;\n** Gurkha Independent Parachute Company\n** Detachments 656 Squadron Army Air Corps\n** various units from Corps of Royal Engineers\n** various units from the Royal Corps of Signals\n* Royal Air Force\n** Detachments 15 Squadron RAF Regiment\n** Detachments 26 Squadron LAA.
