The film was released on July 15, 1951, by Republic Pictures.\nPlot\nPablo Morales, part-owner of the Foster & Morales Wild West Show, is killed during a stunt on horseback. Steve Lacey plans to replace him in management and in the act, so he is irate at learning Rex Allen is going to be the show's new star.\nPablo's young daughter Juanita takes an immediate liking to Rex and his talented horse, Koko. But when another accident results in a broken leg for Koko that could prove fatal for the horse, Rex and his sidekick Muscles Benton suspect foul play.\nKoko recovers thanks to the care of Juanita and her governess, Janet Wells, and Rex feels he should give the horse to the girl. After a fight with Lacey, he intends to leave until he learns that Juanita, now the show's co-owner, has just $2,000 left. After a lab analysis proves the chicanery involved, Foster shoots a sheriff, but Rex manages to make sure the guilty parties  both end up behind bars. A grateful Juanita feels that Koko's rightful place is with Rex.\nCast\n*Rex Allen as Rex Allen\n*Koko as Koko\n*Mary Ellen Kay as Janet Wells\n*Buddy Ebsen as Muscles Benton\n*Roy Barcroft as Steve Lacey\n*Tristram Coffin as Jack Foster\n*Bonnie DeSimone as Juanita Morales\n*Don Beddoe as Mr. Richards\n*Jonathan Hale as Dr. Sands\n*Harry Harvey, Sr. as Veterinarian\n*Rory Mallinson as Sheriff Baxter\n*Joseph Forte as Dr. Teal\n*Buff Brady as Pablo Morales\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
