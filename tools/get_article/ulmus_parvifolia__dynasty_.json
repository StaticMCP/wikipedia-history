First described in 1984, it is reputed to be very fast-growing.\nDescription\nA medium tree rarely exceeding 13&nbsp;m in height, with a spread of similar dimension producing a very rounded shape. Opinions of the tree's aesthetic merit vary; Dirr considered that the tree \"borders on a boondoggle\", whereas Warren and Jacobson thought the shape \"good\", and the foliage a  decent autumn colour (the leaves turn orange-yellow).\nFile:Ulmus parvifolia 'Dynasty' - J.

Raulston Arboretum - DSC06179.JPG|Bark of 'Dynasty', Raulston Arboretum\nPests and diseases\nThe species and its cultivars are highly resistant, but not immune, to Dutch elm disease, and unaffected by the Elm Leaf Beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola. Moreover, the tree's foliage was adjudged \"resistant\" to Black Spot by the Plant Diagnostic Clinic of the University of Missouri [https://web.archive.org/web/20080920051358/http://soilplantlab.missouri.edu/plant/diseases/resistant.htm].\nCultivation\nThe tree is largely limited to North America, although it has been introduced to Italy.\nAccessions\nNorth America\n*Bartlett Tree Experts, US.
