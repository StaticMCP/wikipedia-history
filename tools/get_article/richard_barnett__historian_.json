I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in art, medicine, history, or, simply, the difficult and exhausting business of having and maintaining a body.\" The Guardian praised the book as well, stating, \"Richard Barnett's superbly erudite and lucid accompanying text would really suffice in itself as an introduction to the history of western medical science.\"\nAnisha Gupta wrote in Nature of The Smile Stealers, \"Barnett expertly narrates the 'medical history' that has shaped the dental profession from its gruesome origins of the 'tooth puller', through to its modern day format of the skilled clinical service provider and aesthetician of the twenty-first century.\" The Engineering & Technology magazine reviewer found the work \"stands out among other 'dental' publications both in quality and in quantity. ... What I particularly like about 'The Smile Stealers' is its often irreverent, tongue-in-cheek (in the true sense) tone ...\" The Smile Stealers was the basis for the \"Teeth\" exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London, in 2018.\nHis expertise in the history of medicine led to him becoming the 2014 Scholar in Residence at the Morbid Anatomy Library in New York, and to being the historical consultant for BBC 2's short-running historical comedy Quacks.   He was also a judge for the Wellcome Book Prize and the MacCarthy Award, both in their founding years.\nReferences"
