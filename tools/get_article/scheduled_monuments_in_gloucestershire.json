These protected sites date from the Neolithic period in some cases and include barrows, moated sites, ruined abbeys, castles, Roman villas and tithe barns.\nIn the United Kingdom, the scheduling of monuments was first initiated to ensure the preservation of \"nationally important\" archaeological sites or historic buildings. Protection is given to scheduled monuments under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.\nNotable scheduled monuments in Gloucestershire\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!
