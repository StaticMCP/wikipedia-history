In 1934, the REM took over from the Reichsinnenministerium (Reich Interior Ministry) the supervision of colleges and universities in Germany, as well as research institutions such as the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (abbreviated PTR; translation: Reich Physical and Technical Institute.); today, the PTR is known as the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt.\nAdministrators\n| alt_party         = Nazi Party\n| cabinet           = Hitler\n| ref               =\n}}\n| alt_party         = Nazi Party\n| cabinet           = Goebbels\n| ref               = –\n}}\n| alt_party         = Nazi Party\n| cabinet           = Flensburg Government\n| ref               =\n}}\nHeads of the REM Amt für Wissenschaft (Science Office)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n|\n|Theodor Vahlen\n|1934\n|1937\n|-\n|\n|\n|1937\n|1939\n|-\n|\n|Rudolf Mentzel\n|May 1939\n|1945\n|}\nBibliography\n*Hentschel, Klaus, editor, and Ann M.
