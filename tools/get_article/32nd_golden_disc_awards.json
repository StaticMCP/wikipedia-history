The JTBC network broadcast the show from the Korea International Exhibition Center (KINTEX) in Ilsan. It is the second consecutive year that the show was hosted at the venue. Lee Seung-gi and Lee Sung-kyung served as hosts on the first day, with Kang So-ra and Sung Si-kyung on the second.\nBackground\nOrganized by All Access Productions and HM Entertainment in cooperation with Lumos E&M and broadcasting company JTBC, the 32nd Golden Disc Awards was scheduled to take place at the Mall of Asia Arena in Manila on January 10 and 11, 2018. It would have marked the Philippines' first opportunity to host the show, as well as the ceremony's fourth to be held in a foreign country. Ticket sales began on November 26, but JTBC announced that \"[a]ll kinds of promotions or ticket sales that are currently in progress are not in anyway related to Golden Disc Awards\" due to the ceremony's location remaining unconfirmed. The event was ultimately pulled from the country. All Access Productions cited its domestic financier's \"failure to comply with their responsibility to the owner of the original Golden Disc Awards Ceremony\" as the reason for cancellation.\nThe show was sponsored by Penta Global Advisers Fund and Genie Music, and was held at the Korea International Exhibition Center in the town of Ilsan in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province for a second consecutive year. The first day of the ceremony, which highlighted digital album sales, was hosted by Lee Seung-gi and Lee Sung-kyung. Kang So-ra and Sung Si-kyung served as hosts, for the second year in a row, on the following day which bestowed physical sales awards.\nCriteria\nAlbums and songs released between December 1, 2016, and November 30, 2017, were eligible to be nominated for the 32nd Golden Disc Awards. The awards committee decided to eliminate online voting from the criteria of the Grand Prize Golden Disc, Best Artist, and Rookie Artist of the Year awards; winners were determined by music sales (80%) and a panel of 30 selected music experts (20%). The Popularity Award was calculated entirely from online votes.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first in alphabetical order and emphasized in bold.\nNominee lists adapted from Ilgan Sports.
