Exploiting the independence of Kuku from Algiers, Matthew devised a plan with him to let Spanish garrisons military access. To which Abdallah promised to give the Spaniards entry at Mers-el-Fahm (Arabic: مرسى الفحم, romanized: Marsā al-Faḥm) However, the Divan of Algiers found out about this plot from spies, and Soliman Pasha took an army and besieged Azzefoun, to which Abdallah surrendered. Soliman asked Abdallah to massacre the Spanish garrison on their arrival at Oued-el-Fahm, promising him 1 sultani for each Christian's head and 200 sultani for Matthew's head, to which Abdallah accepted.\nMassacre\nFather Matthew arrived with 4 Galleys commanded by the Viceroy of Majorca, and 100 men. When they arrived Abdallah made sure to give them a honorable welcome to make them feel safe. Matthew asked about the son of the King of Kuku, who was to be taken by the Spanish as a hostage. Abdallah told him that his cousin was confined in a fortress and invited Matthew to follow him into the fort to retrieve the hostage. Matthew became suspicious and tried to go back to his galleys only to be attacked by the Kabyles and massacred. The Viceroy of Majorca retreated from the shores leaving Matthew and his 80 men to be killed by Abdallah and his army.\nAftermath\nAfter bringing the heads to Algiers, Soliman Pasha did not give Abdallah anything, with the pretext that Abdallah 'had to bring the slaves alive so they could be held captive or sold as slaves'.\nReferences"
