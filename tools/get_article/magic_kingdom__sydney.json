It is now closed.\nHistory\nThe park operated in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The park was closed not long after Wonderland Sydney opened.\nThe park was promoted on television with commercials featuring the song \"Magic\" by the band Pilot.\nSome of the rides were sourced from Luna Park after Luna Park closed in 1979 following the Ghost Train tragedy.\nMagic Kingdom was popular at its peak but due to its size and location (it could only be accessed by a road which went through an industrial area and residential area) the park struggled to remain viable.\nThe site was sold in 2017 however, flooding issues with the nearby Prospect Creek have limited its potential for redevelopment.\nAttractions\nThe park was small, covering about .
