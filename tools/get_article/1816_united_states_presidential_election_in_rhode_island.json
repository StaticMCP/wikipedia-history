The Democratic-Republican ticket of U.S. Secretary of State James Monroe and Governor of New York Daniel D. Tompkins was elected unopposed. The Federalist Party failed to nominate a candidate. In the national election, Monroe easily defeated the senior U.S. senator from New York, Rufus King, who received 34 votes from unpledged electors despite not being a candidate.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nRhode Island chose four electors on a statewide general ticket. Nineteenth-century election laws required voters to vote directly for members of the Electoral College rather than for president. This sometimes resulted in small differences in the number of votes cast for electors pledged to the same presidential candidate if some voters did not vote for all the electors nominated by a party. This table shows the votes for the most popular elector pledged to the Democratic-Republican ticket to give an approximate sense of the statewide result.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ 1816 United States presidential election in Rhode Island\n!colspan=2 style=\"width: 130px\"| Party\n!style=\"width: 17em\"| Candidate\n!style=\"width: 5em\"| Votes\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#008000; width:5px;\"|\n| Democratic-Republican\n| James Fenner\n|align=right|\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#008000; width:5px;\"|\n| Democratic-Republican\n| Thomas G.
