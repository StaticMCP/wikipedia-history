It governed an area historically known as Maakhir. The sultanate was ruled in the 19th century by the influential Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire who assumed control during its most turbulent years. In 1884, the United Kingdom established the protectorate of British Somaliland through various treaties with the northern Somali sultanates (Dir, Isaaq and Harti including the Warsangali). The Warsangali clan constituted 120,000 of British Somaliland's total population at the time, of 640,000 (18.75%).\nHistory\nBackground\nThe Sultanate of Gerad Dhidhin was established in northern Somalia in the late 13th century by a group of Somalis from the Warsangali branch of the Darod tribe, and was controlled by the descendants of the Gerad Dhidhin. The Warsangali Sultanate included the Sanaag region and sections of the country's northeastern Bari region, which was traditionally known as Maakhir or the Maakhir Coast.\nThe Sultanate is recognized for its remarkable longevity as a political entity and its tendency to prioritize trade over conquest or expansionism. The Sultanates major ports included Maydh, Bosaso and finally Laasqoray, its capital. It was through these ports that they made the bulk of their trade revenue. I.M. Lewis, in his book A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa, mentions the sultanates reliance on their ports and writes:\nDuring the 19th century, Somali sultanates began to face pressure from European imperialism. I.M. Lewis points to the Sultanate's declining strength was due to the British Protectorate. Lewis writes:\nBritish-Warsangali Treaties\nUnder threat of violence from the British Empire, several northern Somali sultanates, including the Warsangali Sultanate, signed numerous treaties that led to the establishment of the British Somaliland protectorate in 1887. I.M. Lewis mentions the Warsangali as being the most powerful of the sultanates within the British Protectorate.\nWarsangali treaty with the British governmentThe British Government and the Elders of the Warsangali tribe who have signed this Agreement being desirous of maintaining and strengthening the relations of peace and friendship existing between them;\nThe British Government have named and appointed Major Frederick Mercer Hunter, C.S.I., Political Agent and Consul for the Somali Coast, to conclude a Treaty for this purpose.\nThe said Major F. M. Hunter, C.S.I., Political Agent and Consul for the Somali Coast, and the said Elders of the Warsangali, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:-\nART.\nI. The British government, in compliance with the wish of the undersigned Elders of the Warsangali, undertakes to extend to them and to the territories under their authorities and jurisdiction the gracious favour and protection of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress.\nII. The said Elders of the Warsangali agree and promise to refrain from entering into any correspondence, Agreement, or Treaty with any foreign nation or Power, except with the knowledge and sanction of Her Majesty's Government.\nIII. The Warsnagali are bound to render assistance to any vessel, whether British or belonging to any other nation, that may be wrecked on the shores under their jurisdiction and control, and to protect the crew, passengers, and cargo of such vessels, giving speedy intimation to the Resident at Aden of the circumstances; for which act of friendship and good-will a suitable reward will be given by the British Government.\nIV. The Traffic in slaves throughout the territories of the Warsangali shall cease for ever, and the Commander of any of Her Majesty's vessels, or any other British officer duly authorized, shall have the power of requiring the surrender of any slave, and of supporting the demand by force of arms by land and sea.\nV. The British Government shall have the power to appoint an Agent or Agents to reside in the territories of the Warsangali, and every such Agent shall be treated with respect and consideration, and be entitled to have for this protection such guard as the British Government deem sufficient.\nVI. The Warsangali hereby engage to assist all British officers in the execution of such duties as may be assigned to them, and further to act upon their advice in matters relating to the administration of justice, the development of the resources of the country, the interests of commerce, or in any other matter in relation to peace, order, and good government, and the general progress of civilization.\nVII. This Treaty to come into operation from the 27th day of January, 1886, on which date it was signed at\nBunder Gori by the Undermentioned.\nF. M. Hunter\nMohamoud Ali Shire from 1905.]]\nWitness:\nJ.

Hess touches upon this alliance, writing that \"in attempt to break out of Obbian-Mijertein encirclement, the Mullah sought closer alliances with the Warsangali of British Somaliland and Bah Geri of Ethiopia\". In May 1916 the Dervish attacked Las Khorey but were repelled by a British Warship. In September of that year fearing a Dervish invasion, British troops occupied Las Khorey at the insistence of Sultan Mahamud Ali Shire.\nSultans\nRulers of the Warsangali Sultanate:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|1\n|Garaad Dhidhin\n|1298–1311\n|Established the Warsangali Sultanate in the late 13th century.\n|-\n|2\n|Garaad Hamar Gale\n|1311–1328\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Garaad Ibrahim\n|1328–1340\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Garaad Omer\n|1340–1355\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Garaad Mohamud I\n|1355–1375\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Garaad Ciise I\n|1375–1392\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Garaad Siciid\n|1392–1409\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Garaad Ahmed\n|1409–1430\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Garaad Siciid II\n|1430–1450\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Garaad Mohamud II\n|1450–1479\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Garaad Ciise II\n|1479–1487\n|Father of Garaad Ali Dable.\n|-\n|12\n|Garaad Omar\n|1487–1495\n|Following Garaad Ciise II's death, various pretenders to the throne battled each other to succeed the ruler.
