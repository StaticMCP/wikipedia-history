Byun Woo-sung, the elder son of Byun Kang-soo, is jealous of his younger brother and seizes opportunities to bring him down.\nKwon Jae-hoon is a long time friend of Byun Hyuk and is employed by Gangsu Group to cover up the follies of Hyuk. Jae-hoon's father is a loyal driver of Kang-soo and has also gone to jail because of Hyuk's mistake, which is the cause of Jae-hoon's hatred towards Hyuk.\nBaek Joon is a street-smart girl who has multiple part-time jobs and refuses to settle in a full-time permanent job. Her father was wronged by Gangsu Group after being a loyal employee for a long time. She has a crush on Jae-hoon, who is extremely cold towards her.\nWhen Byun Hyuk accidentally meets Baek Joon, he is wearing a custodian's uniform. This leads Joon to believe that Hyuk is just a regular employee of Gangsu Group. Later, when Hyuk is kicked out of his house, he comes to live with Jae-hoon. Joon forces Hyuk to take part-time jobs and in the process imbues him with the confidence to fight Gangsu Group's misconduct and oppressive business policies and practices.\nWith Woo-sung and Kang-soo fighting hard to bring Hyuk down, Kwon Jae-hoon, Byun Hyuk and Baek Joon unite to expose the corruption of Gangsu Group.\nCast\nMain\n* Choi Si-won as Byun Hyuk\n:An unemployed third-generation chaebol who hides his true identity as the second son of a wealthy family and begins living in a studio apartment.\n* Kang So-ra as Baek Joon\n:A hardworking young woman who has a university education but makes her living by working part-time jobs.\n* Gong Myung as Kwon Jae-hoon\n** Son Sang-yeon as young Jae-hoon\n:A highly intelligent young man who is the chief of a secretarial team at a company owned by Byun Hyuk's family.\nSupporting\n;People around Byun Hyuk\n* Lee Jae-yoon as Byun Woo-sung\n:Byun Hyuk's brother.\n* Choi Jae-sung as Byun Kang-soo\n:Byun Hyuk's father.\n* Seo Yi-an as Hong Chae-ri\n:Byun Hyuk's ex-girlfriend and Chairman Hong's youngest daughter.\n* Kyeon Mi-ri as Jung Yeo-jin\n:Byun Hyuk's mother.\n* Jung Chan-bi as Byun Se-na\n:Byun Hyuk's sister.\n* Kim Eung-suk as Byun Gang-ho\n:Byun Huk's uncle.\n* Kim Ye-ryeong as Byun Geum-hee\n:Byun Hyuk's aunt.\n;People around Baek Joon\n* Kim Ye-won as Ha Yeon-hee\n:Baek Joon's best friend who is a flight attendant.\n* Jeon Bae-soo as Baek Joon's father.\n* Hwang Young-hee as Baek Joon's mother.\n;People around Je-hoon\n* Choi Gyu-hwan as Hwang Myeong-soo\n:A prosecutor at the Seoul Central Court.\n* Lee Han-wi as Kwon Choon-sub\n:Je-hoon's father.\n* Kim Ki-doo as Chief Yang\n:Jae-hoon's co-worker.\n;Others\n* Choi Dae-chul as Lee Tae-kyung\n:Baek Joon's colleague at the construction company.\n* Seo Hyun-chul as Kim Ki-sub\n:Baek Joon's colleague at the construction company.\n* Hwang Jung-min as An Mi-yeon\n:Baek Joon's colleague at the construction company.\n* Kang Young-seok as Jang Cheol-min\n:A policeman involved in arresting Byun Hyuk, who later becomes his neighbour by coincidence.
