The APRA Music Awards were presented by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and the Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS). APRA-AMCOS changed the timing of their awards ceremony from May to the previous November and hence a special presentation for 1989/90 recipients was made at the 1991 ceremony. The Australasian Performing Right Association Awards of 1989 are a series of awards held in May 1989 at the Hilton Hotel, Sydney; and are shown in the second table below.\n1989 – 1990 Awards\nOnly winners are noted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
