He is also known to have worked with inflow clepsydras as opposed to earlier, typically less accurate outflow clepsydras.\nThe measurements of synodic periods of the planets given in the following table are attributed to him.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Comparison of Li Fan's values for the synodic periods of the planets\n!Planet\n!True value (days)\n!Li Fan's value (days)\n|-\n|Mercury\n|115.877\n|115.881\n|-\n|Venus\n|583.921\n|584.024\n|-\n|Mars\n|779.936\n|779.532\n|-\n|Jupiter\n|398.884\n|398.846\n|-\n|Saturn\n|378.092\n|378.059\n|}\n)]]\nAn impact crater that is located at the Phaethontis quadrangle, Mars, 47.2°S Latitude and 153.2°W Longitude was named in his honor.
