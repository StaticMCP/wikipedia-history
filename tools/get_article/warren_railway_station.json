The station was built on the New Brighton branch of the Seacombe, Hoylake and Deeside Railway, between Wallasey Grove Road and New Brighton stations, opening on 30 March 1888. The branch became part of the Wirral Railway on 1 July 1891.\nRemotely situated, the station only ever served a small part of the community (and the local golf course). This, combined with an infrequent service, and the later introduction of a tram service on Warren Drive, meant the station was little used, and it was closed on 1 October 1915. The station had one siding nearby, on the seaward side, which was possibly used for the transportation of sand. The foundations of the up platform are extant, and were revealed during engineering work in 2006. The line past the station site remains in use as part of the Wirral Line, now operated by Merseyrail.\n}}\nReferences\nSources\n*"
