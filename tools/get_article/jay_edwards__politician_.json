He is a Republican.

After high school he attended nearby Ohio University on a football scholarship, where he studied mathematics. Edwards is a licensed realtor, and recently begun work in medical sales within the drug treatment market.\nOhio House of Representatives\nIn 2016, Representative Debbie Phillips was term-limited and ineligible to run for a fifth term.  A Democrat, Phillips had only faced one serious election in her four terms, in 2014, where she won by just over 100 votes. However, despite Athens County, the largest in the district, being considered reliably Democratic, Republicans had historically seen success in winning the district prior to Phillips' taking the seat. Democrats nonetheless fielded Sarah Grace, a small-business owner from Athens who was a newcomer to politics and a liberal. Despite being considered the favorite, Edwards raised considerable money, albeit not without controversy. In the end, in what was a very good year for Republicans, Edwards defeated Grace by a 58% to 42% margin, taking the seat.\nEdwards is the first Republican to hold the seat since Jimmy Stewart, who held the seat from 2003 to 2008.\nIn 2018, Edwards defeated Democrat Taylor Sappington to retain the seat.\nIn the 2020 general election, Edwards faced Democrat Katie O'Neill.\nElectoral history\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" | Election results\n|-\n!Year\n!Office\n!Election\n!Votes for Edwards\n!%\n!Opponent\n!Party\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|2016\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Ohio House of Representatives\n|General\n| |28,649\n| |57.80%\n| |Sarah Grace\n| |Democratic\n| |20,897\n| |42.20%\n|-|-\n|2018\n|General\n| |23,562\n| |58.29%\n| |Taylor Sappington\n| |Democratic\n| |16,855\n| |41.71%\n|-\n|2020\n|General\n| |31,584\n| |60.4%\n| |Katie O’Neil\n| |Democratic\n| |20,719\n| |39.6%\n|-\n|2022\n|General\n| |22,190\n| |61.2%\n| |Tanya Conrath\n| |Democratic\n| |14,084\n| |38.8%\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ohiohouse.gov/jay-edwards Ohio State Representative Jay Edwards] official site"
