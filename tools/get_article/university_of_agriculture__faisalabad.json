It is the largest university of Pakistan by area, with a covered area of 2,550 acres. It is ranked as a top university of Pakistan for Agriculture/Veterinary and is ranked among top ten Pakistani universities in general category.\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (Urdu: ), (formerly: Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute), is a university in the city of Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. It was established in 1906 as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the British Punjab.\nIn 2009, the Vice Chancellor of the university said:\nAt independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. Despite subsequent industrialisation and development, agriculture remains central to its economy. After independence, the Government of Pakistan appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing agrarian system and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions advocated for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. This resulted in the upgrade of the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. This had been the first university established by the British Empire. Plans were approved in 1906, and the foundation stone laying ceremony was carried out by Sir Louis Dane, the then lieutenant and governor of the Punjab. The college opened in 1909. The principal between 1923 and 1931 was Thomas Brownlie. By 1989, the university was reported to have 345 academic staff, 3,400 undergraduates and 600 postgraduates, and to be the country's \"largest academic institution in agriculture\".\nThe new campus is green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in a modern style, and the old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12&nbsp;km northeast of the Faisalabad International Airport), about 2&nbsp;km away from the city centre and clock tower.\nThe university has a Zoology Museum, Art Gallery and University Library.\nThe university has hostels for men and women, including Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah), Iqbal Hall, Fatima Jinnah Hostel and Hailey Hall. It accommodates over 15,000 students and approximately 12,000 day scholars.\nOrganisation and administration\nFaculties and departments\nUAF is organised into faculties of Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Food Nutrition and Home Economics, Social sciences, Animal Husbandry, Food Sciences, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Plant and Animal Breeding, Veterinary Science, Doctor of Pharmacy, Mathematics, Statistics and Sciences.
