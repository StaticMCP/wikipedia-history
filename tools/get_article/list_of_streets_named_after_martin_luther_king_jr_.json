There are also a number of other countries that have honoured Martin Luther King Jr., including Italy and Israel. The first street in the United States named in his honor was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Chicago in 1968. The number of streets named after King is increasing every year, and about 70% of these streets are in states which were members of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas. King's home state of Georgia had the most, with 75 streets as of 2001; this had increased to 105 as of 2006.\nAs of 2003, there were over 600 American cities that had named a street after King. By 2004, this number had grown to 650, according to NPR. In 2006, Derek Alderman, a cultural geographer at East Carolina University, reported the number had increased to 730, with only 10 states in the country without a street named after King (Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Vermont). In 2014 he estimated that there were over 900 streets named after King in 41 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. In 2019, National Geographic published an interactive mapping of more than 1,000 streets around the world named after King.\nBusiness owners in the affected parts of cities have often filed objections (and in the case of Kansas City, voted in a referendum to reverse a designation) against streets named for King, arguing that naming a street after Martin Luther King would cause a severe decline in their businesses, associating violent crimes and homicides with a re-naming and claiming it makes the neighborhoods a King-named road passes through dangerous by proxy, though in many cases there is no correlation with that occurring.\nThe following is a list of streets named after King in the United States.\nAlabama\n* Andalusia: A concurrency with US-29 and US-84 is designated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway.\n* Atmore: A  thoroughfare on the east side of town is named Martin Luther King Avenue.\n* Auburn: A section of Alabama State Route 14 is called Martin Luther King Drive, also known interchangeably as Loachapoka Road.\n* Bay Minette: A portion of County Road 138 is labeled Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.\n* Dothan: The portion of US 431 between Ross Clark Circle and its conjunction with US 231 is referred to as Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard\n* Huntsville: Dr. Martin Luther King expressway, located in North Huntsville and part of the Northern bypass. Also known as Alabama State Route 255 from Alabama State Route 53 to Pulaski Pike.\n* Mobile: On Mobile's northside area, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue runs from Congress Street in downtown Mobile up to the intersections of Craft Highway and Saint Stephens Road. The section was formerly known as Davis Avenue from Congress Street to Bizell Avenue, and Stone Street from Bizell Ave. to Saint Stephens Road.\n* Montgomery: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway is I-85 from Eastern Boulevard to the I-65 interchange.\n* Opp: Dr. Martin Luther King Drive runs from College Street to Maloy Street.\n* Prichard: A portion of Craft Highway between the intersections of New Bay Bridge Road and Wilson Avenue is designated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.\n* Scottsboro: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street in Scottsboro runs north–south on the northwest side of town.\n* Selma: In 1976, Sylvan Street was renamed Martin Luther King Street. King spent many days along Sylvan Street working for civil rights in the 1960s, especially by speaking at First Baptist Church and Brown Chapel. Brown Chapel is the background in a famous Time magazine photograph of King in the 1960s. Today, there is a monument honoring King in front of Brown Chapel. Brown Chapel was also the beginning of the route of the infamous Bloody Sunday march. Ironically, the street crosses Jefferson Davis Avenue, named after the president of the Confederacy.\nAlaska\n* Anchorage: A  thoroughfare running from Elmore Road to East Tudor Road was built and given the name of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue in 2010. This idea surfaced in the late 20th century. Initially, some advocates aimed for renaming portions of 9th Avenue, however this proposal resulted in rejection in the hands of a city-wide vote. Some attempted to name the performing arts center after King but failed as well. Despite both of these failures, some proponents were persistent and still desired a street in Anchorage named after King and were successful in 2006 when the Anchorage Assembly approved the proposal of dedicating a street after him. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue is seen as a reminder of King's legacy and position as a civil rights leader. Ten years after the opening of the street, in 2020, plans were announced to expand the avenue to Piper Street.\nArizona\n* Eloy: A three-block-long portion of West Second Street was renamed by the city council to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street.\n* Glendale: Maryland Avenue from 91st to 95th Avenue was renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard by the city of Glendale in 2016.\n* Maricopa: M.

That event was celebrated by the first ever Kingdom Day Parade; years later the event was made an annual tradition. It is typically held on the street between Crenshaw Boulevard and Western Avenue. Due to the length of Dr. King's name, the roadway name is often abbreviated as King Blvd. on its traffic signs and sometimes called MLK Blvd. Running east–west, MLK Boulevard begins as a major thoroughfare at Obama Boulevard (formerly Rodeo Road), running until Central Avenue. From Central Avenue, it continues as a residential street in two discontinuous segments due to the presence of Jefferson High School: between Central and Hooper avenues, and then from Compton Avenue to Alameda Street.\n* Lynwood: A portion of Century Boulevard was renamed Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard within the Lynwood city limits.\n* Merced: Formerly J Street, Martin Luther King, Jr. Way is the north–south State Route 59.\n* Modesto: runs east–west from a dead end as Elm Avenue, then curves to run north–south as Martin Luther King Drive and sometimes abbreviated to S M.L.K.
