Mandela received more than 260 awards over 40 years, most notably the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.\nFrom 1994 to 1999, Mandela was President of South Africa. He was the first such African to be elected in fully representative democratic polls.\nBefore his presidency, Mandela was an anti-apartheid activist and leader of the African National Congress and its armed wing Umkhonto we Sizwe. He spent 27 years in prison, much of it in a cell on Robben Island. The rest of his incarceration was in Pollsmoor Prison, on convictions for crimes that included sabotage committed while he spearheaded the struggle against apartheid.\nFollowing his release from prison on 11 February 1990, his advocacy of a policy of reconciliation and negotiation helped lead the transition to multi-racial democracy in South Africa. Since the end of apartheid, he was widely praised, even by former opponents.\nMandela died on 5 December 2013 as a celebrated elder statesman who continued to voice his opinion on topical issues. In South Africa he is often known as Madiba, an aristocratic title adopted by the elderly members of the royal clan that he belonged to. This title has come to be synonymous with Nelson Mandela.\n1960s\n* 1964&nbsp;– Elected Honorary President of the Students' Union, University of Leeds\n1970s\n* 1973&nbsp;– A nuclear particle
