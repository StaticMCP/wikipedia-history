The song was written by Nosie Katzmann and Jay Supreme with its producer, Doug Laurent. The song peaked at number five in Germany and entered the top 10 in Austria, Denmark and Hungary. Outside Europe, it peaked at number two on the Canadian RPM Dance chart and number 15 on the US Billboard Dance Club Play chart. The accompanying music video, directed by Friedel & Chrudimak, features band members Tania Evans and Jay Supreme in a desert landscape.\nCritical reception\nUpon the release, Larry Flick from Billboard magazine wrote, \"Culture Beat, one of the more enduring acts from rave/NRG, returns with 'Inside Out', a jumpy li'l ditty on 550 Music. The techno flavor of the act's past recordings remains mildly intact, though the arrangements lean more toward soft keyboards and a fluffy disco context. Perfect for tea dances and other jolly gatherings.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media named it Single of the Week, saying, \"Chill out with the original Eurodance stars. A cuddly track chugging along at moderate speed combines with a sonorous male rap that makes it a sure EHR hit.\"\nIn a separate review, Music & Media wrote, \"Dance freaks and club DJ's can delight in no less than 11 remixes. Still, it's the Not Loveland Master Radio Edit 1 which is most suitable for radio. The spooky male voice half way through this otherwise happy uptempo beat adds an unusual touch.\" James Hamilton from Music Week's RM Dance Update described the song as a \"bland slick Euro throbber\" in his weekly dance column, DJ directory.\nChart performance\n\"Inside Out\" peaked within the top 10 in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Hungary. Additionally, it was a top-20 hit in Belgium, Finland and Switzerland, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it peaked at number 17 during its 12th week on the chart, on 27 January 1996. In the UK, it peaked at number 32 on the UK Singles Chart during its first week on the chart, on 21 January. The song also reached number 14 on UK Dance Singles Chart. Outside Europe, \"Inside Out\" became a hit in North America, peaking at number two on the Canadian RPM Dance chart and number 15 on the US Billboard Dance Club Play chart. In Australia and New Zealand, the single reached numbers 62 and 44, respectively. \"Inside Out\" was awarded with a gold record in Germany, with a shipment of 150,000 singles.\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video for \"Inside Out\" was directed by Friedel & Chrudimak.\nTrack listings\n* CD maxi-single (Europe, 1995)\n# \"Inside Out\" (radio edit) – 3:55\n# \"Inside Out\" (extended version) – 5:56\n# \"Inside Out\" (Doug Laurent mix) – 5:48\n# \"Inside Out\" (Temple of Light mix) – 6:50\n# \"Inside Out\" (Mikado mix) – 6:19\n# \"Inside Out\" (Transformed Brainstorm mix) – 7:57\n# \"Inside Out\" (Not Normal mix) – 2:29\n* CD maxi-single – Remix (Europe, 1995)\n# \"Inside Out\" (Not Loveland Master radio edit 1) – 3:36\n# \"Inside Out\" (DNS radio mix) – 3:50\n# \"Inside Out\" (Doug Laurent Euro mix) – 6:16\n# \"Inside Out\" (Felix Gauder mix) – 6:28\n# \"Inside Out\" (DNS mix) – 5:01\n# \"Inside Out\" (Private Area mix) – 7:39\n# \"Inside Out\" (Andrew Brix Good Vibes mix) – 7:52\n# \"Inside Out\" (DJ Tom & Norman mix) – 7:22\n# \"Inside Out\" (Kai McDonald Eternia mix) – 9:48\n# \"Inside Out\" (Quadriga mix) – 6:19\n# \"Inside Out\" (Not Loveland Master mix 12-inch) – 8:58\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1995)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)\n| 62\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40)\n| 10\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)\n| 14\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia)\n| 19\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Dance/Urban (RPM)\n| 2\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark (IFPI)\n| 6\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 17\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista)\n| 15\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|France (SNEP)\n| 46\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Germany (Media Control Charts)\n| 5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Mahasz)\n| 9\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (RIANZ)\n| 44\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Quebec (ADISQ)\n| 36\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Scotland (OCC)\n| 27\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)\n| 23\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)\n| 11\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n| 32\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Dance (OCC)\n| 14\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100\n| 22\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot Dance Club Play (Billboard)\n| 15\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1995)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Germany (Media Control)\n| 91\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1996)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 95\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Germany (Media Control)\n| 76\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Germany\n|October 1995\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Dance Pool\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Australia\n|23 October 1995\n|\n|\n|-\n|30 October 1995\n|2×12-inch vinyl\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe\n|3 November 1995\n|CD\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|15 January 1996\n|\n|Epic\n|\n|}\nReferences"
