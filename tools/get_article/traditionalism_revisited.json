      "text": "# Traditionalism Revisited\n\nTraditionalism Revisited is an album by jazz trombonist and pianist Bob Brookmeyer featuring popular music of the 1920s and 1930s recorded in 1957 for the World Pacific label.\nReception\n| rev2 = Disc\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings\n| rev3score  =\n}}\nThe Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated \"While these selections have occasionally been revived by Dixieland and swing bands, Brookmeyer and his group use harmonies that were modern for the 1950s... Because the musicians have a respect for the older styles, they extend rather than break the tradition; the results are quite enjoyable\". On All About Jazz, Jack Bowers stated \"it’s good to hear Brookmeyer, one of a handful of masters on his axe, and especially the versatile Giuffre, whose more recent work lies in the realm of the avant–garde, playing sturdy straight–ahead Jazz with a well–defined kick\".\nTrack listing\n# \"Louisiana\" (Andy Razaf, Bob Schafer, J.
