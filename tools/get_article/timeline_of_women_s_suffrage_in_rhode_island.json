Women's suffrage in Rhode Island started with women's rights activities, such as convention planning and publications of women's rights journals. The first women's suffrage group in Rhode Island was founded in 1868. A women's suffrage amendment was decided by referendum on April 6, 1887, but it failed by a large amount. Finally, in 1917, Rhode Island women gained the right to vote in presidential elections. On January 6, 1920, Rhode Island became the twenty-fourth state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment.\n19th century\nBefore the Rhode Island Woman Suffrage Association in October 1891]]\n1850s\n1850\n*Paulina Wright Davis is the chair of the National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n1852\n*Anna W.
