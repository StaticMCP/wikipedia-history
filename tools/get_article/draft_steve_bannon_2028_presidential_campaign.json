After Trump's first inauguration, Bannon served as senior counselor and the White House chief strategist until August 2017. Bannon served four months in prison on contempt of Congress charges; if Bannon were to be elected president, he would be the first president to have served time in prison and the second to be convicted of a crime, after Trump.\nPre-candidacy developments\nAt the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Bannon's supporters encouraged attendees to vote for him in a straw poll. According to The New York Times in March, supporters of Bannon were \"quick to mention him as a potential candidate for president in 2028\". That month, Politico reported that Bannon had privately discussed a campaign in the 2028 United States presidential election. He continued to express support for Donald Trump, telling NewsNation's Chris Cuomo that he expected Trump to run for a third, unconstitutional term and that he would win.\nOn August 7, the Daily Mail reported that Bannon was considering a presidential campaign.\nPolling\nIn a straw poll conducted at the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference, Bannon received twelve percent of votes, behind vice president JD Vance.\nReferences"
