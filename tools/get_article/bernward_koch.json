His music mainly evokes a soothing and calming style, with a clearly recognizable melody from the piano, enriched with keyboards, flute, guitar and percussion. His first release, 1989's Flowing, was successful especially in the United States, hit song: \"Ever Returning\".\nThe second album Laguna de la Vera achieved top positions on the Billboard New Age Chart.
