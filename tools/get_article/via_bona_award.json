The Via Foundation supports community and philanthropy development in the Czech Republic. Via Foundation focuses on growing the number of people in the Czech Republic working collaboratively to improve their communities and giving to help others. \"Every act of charity is a story – which can motivate other people who are thinking about giving back but don't know how to start,\" says Executive Director Jiří Bárta about why Via Foundation presents the Via Bona awards.\nThe Via Bona Awards are one of the two major annual awards in the Czech Republic to honor philanthropy and philanthropists.  The other major Czech philanthropy award is the TOP Corporate Philanthropists Award presented by Donors Forum to award companies which have given the highest total monetary amount to charitable causes over the course of one year.\nSince 1997, The Via Bona Awards are held each year under the auspices of the Embassy of the US in Prague and the general partner is Nadace Vodafone Česká republika. The Via Bona Award is given to those who serve as an example to others through their material and financial support, as well as their willingness to tread untried paths.\nThe Via Bona Awards are nominated by Czech nonprofit organizations and are chosen by an independent jury.\nFor the 19th year in a row, Via Foundation recognized individuals and companies who help improve their communities by giving their time, energy, expertise or money to help others. Via announced the winners of the 2016 Via Bona Philanthropy Awards. Juries selected winners in six categories.\nThe 2016 award winners include people such as Zdeňka Mocňáková, who helps disabled people and senior citizens despite being reliant on a wheelchair herself. She is the recipient of the Personal Engagement Award.\nIn the Young Personal Engagement category, the jury selected two winners: Jakub Trefný, who despite being just nineteen years old, is an experienced volunteer nad helps senior citizens, homeless people and refugees, and Milan Dzuriak, who undertakes \"Journeys against Pain\" to raise money to make disabled children's dreams come true.\nThe Patron Award was presented to businessman Sanjiv Suri, owner of Zátiší Group, for his numerous philanthropic activities both in the Czech Republic and around the world.\nThe Good Company Award went to Dušan Hopp's company Auto Díly Servis s.r.o., based in Nový Jičín, whose owner and employees helped remodel a Home for Pregnant Women in Crisis.\nThe Loyal Donor Award is a new category this year. It went to Asaf Auerbach, a regular donor to children's charities whose own life was saved by Sir Nicholas Winton during World War II.\nThe Bequests Help Award draws attention to bequests, which are still an uncommon form of giving in the Czech Republic. Via Foundation recognized microbiologist Ludmila Šilhánkova in memoriam. She left over CZK 2 million to help disabled children and young people.\n''The Public's Choice Award'' is a special seventh category presented under the auspices of Czech TV, the main media partner of the Via Bona Awards. Members of the public chose from among the 15 nominated philanthropists on the Via Foundation website. The winner of the voting was Zdeňka Mocňáková.\nList of Award Winners\n2016\nPersonal Engagement Award and Public's Choice Award: Zdeňka Mocňáková\nYoung Personal Engagement Award: Milan Dzuriak and Jakub Trefný\nGood Company Award: Dušan Hopp, Auto Díly Servis s.r.o.\nPatron Award: Sanjiv Suri\nLoyal Donor Award: Asaf Auerbach\nBequests Help Award: Ludmila Šilhánková\n2015\nPersonal Engagement Award: Zdenka Wasserbauerová\nYoung Philanthropist Award: High school student Kateřina Vaňáková\nAward for a Bequest: Professor Kateřina Šmídková\nForging a New Path Award: Vojtěch Sedláček\nIndividual Donor Award: Libor Winkler\nThe Small and Medium-Sized Company Award: Konzum, obchodní družstvo v Ústí nad Orlicí\nLarge Corporation Award: NET4GAS, s.r.o.\nThe Public's Choice Award (public online voting at www.umimetouzoddetstvi.cz): First, third, fourth and 4C classes, Gymnázium Jateční, Ústí nad Labem\n2014\nPersonal Engagement Award:\n* Barbora Jindřiška Petrtýlová\n* Petr Sýkora\nJournalists' Individual Donor Award: Kvido Štěpánek\nYoung Philanthropist Award: Martin Kučera and Vojtěch Paukner\nForging a New Path Award: Aleš Jeník\nSmall and Medium-Sized Company Award: GALVAMET spol. s.r.o.\nLarge Corporation Award: AVAST Software s.r.o.\n2013\nForging a New Path Award: JUDr. Hana Machačová\nPersonal Engagement Award: Tomáš Slavata\nAcademic Philanthropy Award: students of the Third Faculty of Medicine - Charles University Scott Keel and Petr Oliva\nJournalists' Individual Donor Award: Martin Hausenblas\nSmall and Medium-Sized Company Award: Z - Trade s.r.o.\nLarge Corporation Award: Česká spořitelna\nHonorary Award: Olbram Zoubek\n2012\nJournalists' Individual Donor Award: Jana Bečvářová\nAcademic Philanthropy Award: students of grammar school Broumov and their teacher Šárka Rambousková\nPersonal Engagement Award: Ondřej Horecký\nForging a New Path: Adastra, s.r.o.\nSmall and Medium-Sized Company Award: MIBCON a.s.\nLarge Corporation Award: KPMG Czech Republic\nAward for Support Specific Project by Large Corporation: OKD, a.s.\n2011\nJournalists' Individual Donor Award: Břetislav Tůma\nPersonal Engagement Award: PhDr. Jaroslav Šturma\nLarge Corporation Award: Vodafone Czech Republic\nSmall and Medium-Sized Company: LAW CZ\nAward for Innovative Project: LMC s.r.o.\nAward for Employee Involvement in Philanthropy: KPMG Czech Republic\nAward for Long-term partnership with a Nonprofit: Telefónica Czech Republic, a.s.\n2010\nCorporate Award (large companies): Ogilvy Group\nCorporate Award (small- and medium- sized companies): College of Economics and Management (VŠEM)\nIndividual Award: Lubomír Kohout\nAward for Innovative Projects: e|n|w|c Natlacen Walderdorff Concola v.o.s\nAward for Employee Involvement in Philanthropy: PricewaterhouseCoopers Česká republika s.r.o.\nAward for Long-term Partnership with a Nonprofit: Ogilvy Group\nJournalists' Award: Lubomír Kohout\n2009\nCorporate Award (large companies):  Československá obchodní banka, a.s.\nCorporate Award (small- and medium- sized companies): Josef Kvapil, a.s.\nIndividual Award: Marek Stanzel\nAward for Innovative Projects: Jaroslav Sklenář\nAward for Employee Involvement in Philanthropy: T-Mobile Czech Republic, a.s.\nAward for Long-term Partnership with a Non-profit: Pavel Cindr\n2008\nCorporate Award (large companies): Telefónica O2 Czech Republic\nCorporate Award (small- and medium- sized companies): Bisport, spol. s.r.o.\nIndividual Award: Mr. Milan and Mrs. Marie Sourada\nAward for Innovative Projects: Poštovní spořitelna\nAward for Employee Involvement in Philanthropy/Volunteerism: Citibank Europe plc\nAward for Long-term Partnership with a Non-profit: Kocián Šolc Balaštík\nHonorary Award: Mrs. Marka Bednářová and Mr. Donald Hamer\n2007\nCorporate Award (large companies): Isolit – Bravo, s.r.o.\nCorporate Award (small- and medium- sized companies): Orbit, s.r.o.\nIndividual Award: Countess Mathilda Nostitzozová\nAward for Innovative Projects: Vodafone Czech Republic\n2006\nCorporate Award (large companies): Metrostav a.s.\nCorporate Award (small- and medium- sized companies): Hobra - Školník\nIndividual Award: Vlastimil Venclík\nAward for Innovative Projects: Skanska CZ Corporation\nHonorary Award: Vaclav and Marie Hora\nHonorable Mentions: Marten, s.r.o; Československa obchodní banka\n2005\nCorporate Award (large companies): Stavební spořitelna České spořitelny, a.s.\nCorporate Award (small- and medium- sized companies): Casta a.s.\nAward for Innovative Projects: ECE Projektmanagement G.m.b.
