The Temple is dedicated to Venkateswara, an incarnation of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared here to save mankind from the trials and troubles of Kali Yuga. The temple is situated at a height of  on Tirumala Hills which are part of the Seshachalam Hills and is constructed in Dravidian architectural style.\nMaha dwaram\nover it encircled by Mahaprakaram]]\nThe Maha Dwaram is the main entrance to the temple and is also known as 'Padikavali', 'SimhaDwaram,' or 'outer gopuram'. It provides access from outside the temple to the Sampangi Pradakshinam, and is separated from it by an outer compound wall (Maha Prakaram). The tower stands at the height of . On either side of the entrance stand two panchaloha (metal) statues of Sankanidhi and Padmanidhi, who are traditionally regarded as the guardians of the navanidhi, the nine treasures of Venkateswara.\nSampangi Pradakshina\nThe Sampangi Pradakshinam is the primary circumambulation walkway within the temple complex. It is named after Magnolia champaca flowers, called Sampangi in Telugu, which were grown in the area. The Sampangi Pradakshinam includes Prathima Mandapam, Rang Mandapam, Tirumalaraya Mandapam, Saluva Narasimha Mandapam, Aina Mahal and Dwajasthamba Mandapam. Additionally, various ugrams (storerooms) are located across the corridor.\nVendi Vakili\n, which means \"silver entrance\" in Telugu, is the second entrance of the temple. It leads to the Vimana Pradakshinam and is also known as 'Nadimipadikavali'. The name of this entrance comes from the silver plating on the doors. An inner compound wall separates the Sampangi Pradakshinam and Vimana Pradakshinam. A three storied gopuram was built over this entrance with seven kalisams during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\nVimana pradakshina\nVendivakili leads to the Vimana Pradakshinam. Vimana Pradakshinam is the pathway that circumambulates the Ananda Nilayam Vimana Gopuram—the Sanctum Sanctorum or Main Shrine. The Angapradakshina Seva is performed in this area; hence, this path is also referred to as the Anga Pradakshina Margam.\nJust after entering the Vimana Pradakshinam, opposite Vendivakili and behind the Garuda Mandapam, there are small idols of Sri Varadaraja Swamy, Sri Ranganatha Swamy (in a sleeping posture over Adisesha), and Sri Venkateswara Swamy, plated in gold.\nThe Vimana Pradakshinam also includes small shrines: the Varadaraja Swamy Temple, located to the right of Vendivakili and facing west, and the Yoga Narasimha Swamy Temple, located to the left of Vendivakili, also facing west.\nOther rooms along the path include:\n* Potu (the main kitchen),\n* Bangaru Bavi (golden well),\n* Ankurarpana Mandapam,\n* Yagasala,\n* Rooms for Nanalu (coins) and Notlu (paper notes) for Parkamani,\n* The Almirah of sandal paste (Chandanapu Ara),\n* The Cell of Records,\n* The seat of Sannidhi Bhashyakarulu (Sri Ramanuja),\n* The '''Lord's Hundi, and\n* The seat of Vishvaksena.\nDevotees also have darshan of Vimana Venkateswara Swamy, who resides on Ananda Nilayam, from the Sampangi Pradakshinam.\nAll the small temples along this pathway are collectively known as ‘Chuttu Gullu’'—the sub-shrines that encircle the main shrine.\nAnanda Nilayam Vimanam\n(semicircular building in the foreground) as seen from Srivari Padalu on Narayanagiri hill]]\nThe Ananda Nilayam is a monumental tower with a golden roof. Its inner temple or vimanam houses the main deity, Lord Sri Venkateswara. The deity stands directly beneath a gilt dome called the Ananda Nilaya Divya Vimana. This deity, called the Mulaberam, is believed to be self-manifested, and tradition holds that no human being is known to have installed it in the shrine. The deity wears a gold crown with a large emerald embedded in the front. On special occasions, the deity is adorned with a diamond crown. The Mulaberam'' has a thick double tilaka drawn on his forehead, which screens his eyes. His ears are decorated with golden earrings. The right hand is pointing to his lotus feet. His left hand is akimbo. His body is dressed with yellow clothing tied with gold string and a gold belt with gold bells. He has a yajnopavita (sacred thread) flowing down crosswise from his left shoulder. He bears Lakshmi Devi on his right chest and Padmavathi Devi on his left chest. His feet are covered with gold frames and decked with gold anklets. A curved gold belt encompasses his legs. The Ananda Nilaya Divya Vimana was covered with gilt copper plates and surmounted with a golden vase in the 13th century, during the reign of the Vijayanagara king Yadava Raya. The ancient and sacred temple of Sri Venkateswara is located on the seventh peak, Venkatachala (Venkata Hill) of the Tirupati Hill, and lies on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini. It is by the Lord's presidency over Venkatachala that He has received the appellation Venkateswara, meaning the Lord of the Venkata Hill. He is also known as the Lord of the Seven Hills.\nBangaru vakili\nTirumamani Mandapam is the mandapam in front of bangaru vakili and is constructed in 1417AD by madhavadasar. From the Tirumamani Mandapam, one can enter the Bangaru vakili (translates to Golden Entrance) to reach the inner sanctum sanctorum. There are two tall copper images of the dwarapalakas Jaya and Vijaya on either side of the door. The thick wooden door is covered with gilt plates depicting the dasavataram of Sri Maha Vishnu. The doorway is directly in line with the Padi Kavali and the Vendi Vakili (Meaning Silver Corridor in Telugu). It admits pilgrims to the Snapana Mandapam. Suprabhatam is sung in front of this door.\nGarbhagriha\nThe Garbhagruha or sanctum sanctorum is where the idol of Venkateswara is placed. The idol stands in the Garbha Gruha, directly beneath a gilt-dome called the \"Ananda Nilaya Divya Vimana\". This idol, called the Mulaberam, is believed to be self-manifested. Tradition holds that no known sculptors were capable of producing such an idol, and no person was known to have installed the idol in the temple.\nThe idol of the Lord wears a gold crown (Kiritam) with a large emerald embedded at the front. On special occasions, this emerald crown is replaced with a diamond Kiritam. The idol also has two thick patches of tilak, drawn with refined camphor, on its forehead, which almost cover the idol's eyes. Between the two white patches is a Kasturi Tilakam made of saffron.\nGolden makara kundalas hang on the ears of the idol. The palm of its raised right hand is embedded with a gem-set Sudarshana Chakra and the left palm with the Holy Cone. The slightly outstretched front right hand, has its fingers pointing toward the feet, as if the Lord is the only recourse to his devotees to dissolve in him and enjoy eternal bliss. The akimbo of the front left hand implies lord's protection to devotees and to show that the Samsara Sagara (Ocean of Life) is never deeper than to hip's height, if they seek his refuge.\nThe body of the Idol is spun with a Gold-stringed-Pitambaram, with a belt of golden-bells. The idol is decorated with precious ornaments. It has a sacred thread flowing down, crossing from the left shoulder. It bears Goddess Lakshmi on the right chest and Sri Padmavathi Devi on the left. Nagaabharanam ornaments are on both shoulders of the idol. The lotus feet are covered with gold frames and decked with clinging gold anklets. A strong curved belt of gold encompasses the legs. During abhishekam, worshippers can have darshan of Goddess Lakshmi.\nThe Ananda Nilaya Divya Vimana was covered with gilt copper plates and topped with a golden vase in the 13th century, during the reign of the Vijayanagara king Yadava Raya.\nPilgrims are not allowed to enter the Garbha Gruha beyond the Kulasekhara padi, or path.\nPushkarni\nSwami Pushkarni is the temple pond located on the northern side of the main temple. The pond is spread over 1.5 acres, and is considered sacred as it is believed to have been brought by Garuda from Vaikuntham to Tirumala Hills. The tank had a mandapam at its centre, which was constructed by Saluva King Narasimha Raya in 1468. A harathi is given to the Pushkarni daily in the evening by temple priests. Every year the Sri Venkateswara Annual Theppotsavam (Float festival) is conducted in this pond, where the processional deities of the temple are taken to float over the water. Chakrasnanam, a celestial bath to Chakrathalwar, Malayappa and his concerts, is conducted at this pond during the last day of Srivari Brahmotsavams.\nAkhilandam\nAkhilandam, also known as Akhandam, is the area in front of main temple where huge lamps are installed. Devotees will offer karpuram (camphor) and coconuts to Venkateswara at this place after darshan. From the Akhilandam one can have a complete view of the temple. It has huge lamps, two iron rails to break coconuts and two huge coconut hundis where devotees can offer the coconuts.\nSee also\n* Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala\n* Dravidian architecture\nReferences"
