The moment was uploaded on YouTube in July 2009; it currently has over 4 million views.\nTop 10 films\n(in alphabetical order)\n* About Schmidt\n* Adaptation.\n* Catch Me If You Can\n* Chicago\n* Far from Heaven\n* Gangs of New York\n* The Hours\n* The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n* The Pianist\n* Road to Perdition\nWinners and nominees\n, Best Director winner]]\n, Best Actor co-winner]]\n, Best Actor co-winner]]\n, Best Actress winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Best Young Actor/Actress winner]]\n, Best Writer winner]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\nChicago\n* About Schmidt\n* Adaptation.\n* Catch Me If You Can\n* Far from Heaven\n* Gangs of New York\n* The Hours\n* The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n* The Pianist\n* Road to Perdition\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Steven Spielberg – Catch Me If You Can / Minority Report'\n* Roman Polanski – The Pianist\n* Martin Scorsese – Gangs of New York\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Daniel Day-Lewis – Gangs of New York as Bill \"The Butcher\" Cutting (TIE)Jack Nicholson – About Schmidt as Warren Schmidt (TIE)'\n* Robin Williams – One Hour Photo as Seymour \"Sy\" Parrish\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Julianne Moore – Far from Heaven as Cathleen \"Cathy\" Whitaker'\n* Salma Hayek – Frida as Frida Kahlo\n* Nicole Kidman – The Hours as Virginia Woolf\n* Diane Lane – Unfaithful as Constance \"Connie\" Sumner\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Chris Cooper – Adaptation. as John Laroche'\n* Alfred Molina – Frida as Diego Rivera\n* Paul Newman – Road to Perdition as John Rooney\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Catherine Zeta-Jones – Chicago as Velma Kelly'\n* Kathy Bates – About Schmidt as Roberta Hertzel\n* Meryl Streep – Adaptation. as Susan Orlean\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Kieran Culkin – Igby Goes Down as Jason \"Igby\" Slocumb Jr.'\n* Tyler Hoechlin – Road to Perdition as Michael Sullivan Jr.\n* Nicholas Hoult – About a Boy as Marcus Brewer\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Gollum – The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'\n* Dobby – Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n* Yoda – Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\nChicago\n* The Hours\n* My Big Fat Greek Wedding\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Adaptation. / Confessions of a Dangerous Mind – Charlie Kaufman'\n* About Schmidt – Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor\n* My Big Fat Greek Wedding – Nia Vardalos\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\nSpirited Away\n* Ice Age\n* Lilo & Stitch\n* Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\nBowling for Columbine\n* The Kid Stays in the Picture\n* Standing in the Shadows of Motown\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n* The Rookie\n* Tuck Everlasting\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Y tu mamá también • Mexico'\n* Monsoon Wedding • India\n* Talk to Her • Spain\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'Catch Me If You Can / Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets / Minority Report – John Williams'\n* The Hours – Philip Glass\n* The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers – Howard Shore\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n'\"Lose Yourself\" – 8 Mile'\n* \"Father and Daughter\" – The Wild Thornberrys Movie\n* \"Hero\" – Spider-Man\n|}\nFreedom Award\n'Denzel Washington – Antwone Fisher\nBest Picture Made for Television\nDoor to Door'\n* Live from Baghdad\n* Martin and Lewis\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" background: #f6e39c;\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\"| Nominations\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 4\n| About Schmidt\n|-\n| Adaptation.\n|-\n| The Hours\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 3\n| Catch Me If You Can\n|-\n| Chicago\n|-\n| Gangs of New York\n|-\n| Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n|-\n| The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n|-\n| Road to Perdition\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 2\n| Far from Heaven\n|-\n| Frida\n|-\n| Minority Report\n|-\n| My Big Fat Greek Wedding\n|-\n| The Pianist\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" background: #f6e39c;\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:55px;\"| Wins\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film\n|-\n| 3\n| Chicago\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2\n| Adaptation.\n|-\n| Catch Me If You Can\n|-\n| Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n|-\n| Minority Report\n|}\nReferences"
