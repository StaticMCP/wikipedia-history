Roman consul Appius Claudius who was sent in a campaign had settled in Lychnidos with 4,000 troops but had gathered another 4,000 troops. Appius Claudius had received a message that the people of Uskana would give the city to him. He went to the city with 7,000 troops letting 1,000 troops in Lychnidos. Appius Claudius thinking that the city was going to be given to him didn't form a military formation. The battle cost the Romans 5,000-6,000 men.\nBattle\nThe Macedonian king Perseus of Macedon marched 3 days from Stubera to Uskana with 10,000 infantry, 2,000 lightly armed soldiers and 500 cavalry. Around 4,000 Roman troops and 500 Illyrian cavalry were stationed in the city. The fighting continued day and night. When the Romans and Illyrians saw the Macedonian siege towers they realized that further defense of the city was in vain. Roman generals Gaius Carvilius and Caius Afranius were sent to negotiate with the Macedonians and he let the Roman soldiers withdraw from the city, but not before taking their weapons and the remaining 500 Illyrian cavalry surrendered.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle ended Perseus of Macedon established a Macedonian garrison at Uskanahe also captured parts of the city's entire population and sent them to Stubera. The Illyrians and Uscans were sold as slaves to Penestae.\nReferences"
