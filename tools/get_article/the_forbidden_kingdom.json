Loosely based on the 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, the plot revolves around Jason Tripitikas (Angarano), a modern-day American teenager who is transported back to ancient China after discovering Sun Wukong's Ruyi Jingu Bang. He accompanies Lu Yan / Old Hop (Chan) and Sun Wukong / Silent Monk (Li) on their quest to return the staff to its rightful owner while trying to avoid the minions of the evil Jade Warlord (Chou). The action sequences were choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping.\nThe film is regarded as the first co-production helmed by an American director to make a primarily English-language wuxia genre film set in ancient China for a global audience. Heavily promoted as the first film starring both Chan and Li, it was distributed in the United States through Lionsgate and The Weinstein Company, and through The Huayi Brothers Film & Taihe Investment Company in China. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $128 million against a budget of $55 million.\nPlot\nIn South Boston, martial arts film fan Jason Tripitikas dreams of a battle between Sun Wukong and celestial soldiers in the clouds. He visits a pawn shop in Chinatown to buy wuxia DVDs and discovers a golden Ruyi Jingu Bang. On his way home, Jason is harassed by some hooligans, whose leader Lupo attempts to use him to help them rob the shop's owner Hop, who is shot by Lupo. Hop tells Jason to deliver the staff to its rightful owner and Jason flees with it. He is cornered on the rooftop before being pulled off the roof by the staff.\nWhen Jason regains consciousness, he finds himself in an ancient Chinese village under attack by soldiers. They attempt to seize his staff, but he is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar Lu Yan, a supposed \"immortal\", who remains alert and agile even when drunk.\nLu tells him the story of the rivalry between Sun Wukong and Erlang Shen, who tricked the Monkey King into setting aside his magical staff, Ruyi Jingu Bang, and transformed him into a stone statue, but the Monkey King cast his staff far away before the transformation. Lu ends the tale with a prophecy about a \"Seeker\" who will find the staff and free the Monkey King. Just then, they are attacked by the Jade Warlord's men again, but manage to escape with the help of Golden Sparrow, a young woman whose family was murdered by the Jade Warlord.\nMeanwhile, the Jade Warlord, upon learning about the staff, sends the witch Ni-Chang to help him retrieve it in exchange for the elixir of immortality. Jason, Lu and Sparrow meet the Silent Monk who joins them in their quest to free the King. As the four travel to Five Elements Mountain, Lu and the Monk teach Jason kung fu along the way.\nWhile crossing a desert, Lu attempts to summon rain using magic calligraphy, after which the Silent Monk urinates on Lu to make fun of his supposed powers.\nAfter crossing the desert, they encounter Ni Chang, who offers to return Jason home in exchange for the staff. When he refuses, a battle ensues and ends after Ni Chang shoots an arrow which mortally wounds Lu. Jason's team escapes and takes refuge in a monastery, where they learn that Lu is not an immortal as he claimed to be, and only the Jade Warlord's elixir can save his life. Jason goes to the Jade Warlord's palace alone to exchange the staff for the elixir.\nHowever, the Jade Warlord promised the elixir to Ni Chang already. As the Warlord can only give the elixir to one of them, Jason must duel Ni Chang for it. Sparrow, the Silent Monk, and the monks from the monastery arrive to join the battle. Silent Monk fights the Jade Warlord, and Sparrow fights Ni Chang. While she is distracted, Jason manages to grab the elixir and tosses it to Lu, who drinks it and recovers. Lu then fights Ni Chang on the balcony then kicks her off it. Ni Chang tries to strangle him with her hair to climb back up to the balcony; he cuts her hair, causing her to fall to her death.\nThe Monk is mortally wounded by the Jade Warlord and passes the staff to Jason, who uses it to smash the King's statue. The Monkey King is freed and the Monk is revealed to be one of the Monkey King's clones. Sparrow is killed, and the Jade Warlord is eventually stabbed by Jason after being defeated by the Monkey King and falls into a lava pit to his death. The Jade Emperor, having returned from his meditation, praises Jason for fulfilling the prophecy and grants him one wish. Jason asks to be returned home.\nJason finds himself back in the present. Then, he overpowers Lupo and drives the other hooligans away. Hop survives being shot and claims that he is immortal, indicating that he is actually Lu. After checking in on him, Jason meets a young woman who resembles Sparrow. Jason then continues honing his kung fu skills, while Lu narrates the King's search for truth.\nCast\n* Jackie Chan as Lu Yan / Old Hop\n* Jet Li as Sun Wukong / Silent Monk\n* Liu Yifei as Golden Sparrow / Chinatown Girl\n* Li Bingbing as Ni Chang\n* Michael Angarano as Jason Tripitikas\n* Morgan Benoit as Lupo\n* Collin Chou as Erlang Shen\n* Wang Deshun as Jade Emperor\nProduction\nDevelopment\nWhile the character Sun Wukong came from Wu Cheng'en's famous classical novel Journey to the West, in an interview with Screen Power magazine, actor Collin Chou denied that the plotline would be related to the novel.

Before trying to kill the Jade Warlord, Golden Sparrow refers to the 1966 film, telling him to \"Come drink with\" her.\nLu Yan is a famous Taoist Saint, better known as Lü Dongbin, one of the Eight Immortals referenced in Jackie Chan's Drunken Master films.\nThe White Haired Demoness Ni Chang is the anti-heroine of the iconic pulp novel Baifa Monü Zhuan by Liang Yusheng, adapted as the film The Bride With White Hair.\nThe Jade Emperor is the ruler of the Heavens in Chinese myth.\nFilming\nFilming began in early 1 May 2007 in the area around the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. Before filming began, the entire cast did a costume fitting and a script read through, certain dialogues were altered to suit the different actors' English speaking abilities; this was due to the majority of the cast having English as their second language. Chan described the first day of shooting as \"very relaxing\" because the shots only required drama and walking, with no action. When the two martial arts veterans (Chan and Li) did film action scenes together for the first time, they both expressed how easy it was to work with one another.
