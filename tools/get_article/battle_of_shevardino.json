Kutuzov stated that the fortification was manned simply to delay the advance of the French forces.\nBattle\nThe Shevardino redoubt was defended by Prince Gorchakov's troops, part of Pyotr Bagration's Second Western Army. The conflict began on September 5 when Marshal Joachim Murat's French forces met Konovnitsyn's Russians in a massive cavalry clash, the Russians eventually retreating to the Kolorzkoi Cloister when their flank was threatened. Fighting resumed the next day but Konovnitsyn again retreated when Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais' Fourth Corps arrived, threatening his flank. The Russians withdrew to the Shevardino Redoubt, where a pitched battle ensued. Murat led Nansouty's First Cavalry Corps and Montbrun's Second Cavalry Corps, supported by Compans's Division of Louis Nicolas Davout's First Infantry Corps against the redoubt. Simultaneously, Prince Józef Poniatowski's Polish infantry attacked the position from the south. The French captured it. The small redoubt was destroyed and covered by the dead and dying of both sides.\nCasualties\nThe French won the combat at a cost of 4,000 French and 6,000&nbsp;Russian casualties. The estimates of 2,000 French casualties refer only to the fighting at the redoubt itself, and do not include Konovnitsyn's actions. Losses of 7,000 were suffered by the Russians in all actions, including the previous 2 days.\nAftermath\nThe unexpected French advance from the west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray. Since the left flank of their defensive position had collapsed, Russian forces withdrew to the east, constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa. The left flank of the Russian position was thus ripe for a flanking attack. The Battle of Borodino would begin two days later.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the French invasion of Russia\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
