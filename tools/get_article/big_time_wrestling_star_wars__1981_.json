Promoter Fritz Von Erich held two \"Wrestling Star Wars\" events, one in June and one in October as well as a special \"Christmas Star Wars\" on December 25 of that year.\nWrestling Star Wars (June)\n| venue=Reunion Arena\n| city=Dallas, Texas\n| attendance=\n| liveevent=y\n| lastevent = Big Time Wrestling Parade of Champions\n| nextevent = Wrestling Star Wars\n| event = Wrestling Star Wars\n| lastevent2 = First\n| nextevent2 =October 1981\n}}\nWrestling Star Wars (June 1981) was a professional wrestling supercard show that was held on June 4, 1981. The show was produced and scripted by the Dallas, Texas based Big Time Wrestling (BTW) professional wrestling promotion and held in their home area, the Dallas, Texas. Several matches from the show were taped for BTW's television shows and broadcast in the weeks following the show. It is believed that the June 4, 1981 version of \"Wrestling Star Wars\" was the first  overall show in the \"Wrestling Star Wars\" event chronology. The show was held at the Reunion Arena.\nDue to sparse records from 1981 the full show has not been found documented, only three matches on the show have been verified. Kerry Von Erich defeated Ernie Ladd to win the NWA American Heavyweight Championship on the show, Bruiser Brody defeated The Great Kabuki in a Texas Death Steel Cage match and, as a result of the latter, Fritz Von Erich was able to face The Great Kabuki's manager, Gary Hart, for five minutes in the cage in an impromptu match. As of May 2019, all known matches are available as Hidden Gems on the WWE Network.\nResults\n| match7 = Bruiser Brody defeated The Great Kabuki\n| match6 = Kerry Von Erich defeated Ernie Ladd (c)\n| stip6 = Singles match for the NWA American Heavyweight Championship\n| match4 = Fritz Von Erich and José Lothario defeated Tim Brooks and René Guajardo\n| stip4 = Tag team\n| match5 = Chang Chung defeated The Spoiler\n| stip5 = Singles match\n| time7 = 9:58\n| time8 = 5:00\n}}\nWrestling Star Wars (October)\n| venue=Reunion Arena\n| city=Dallas, Texas\n|time7=20:08\n|match8=Al Madril (c) defeated Bill Irwin via DQ\n|stip8=Singles match for the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship\n|time8=15:42\n}}\nChristmas Star Wars\n| venue=Reunion Arena\n| city=Dallas, Texas\n|time3=06:33\n|match4=Blue Demon and Al Madril defeated Arman Hussein and Carlos Zapata\n|stip4=Tag team match\n|time4=13:52\n|match5=El Solitario (c) defeated Killer Tim Brooks\n|stip5=Singles match for the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship\n|time5=05:32\n|match6=The Great Kabuki defeated Fritz Von Erich\n|stip6=\"Texas death\" match\n|time6=14:32\n|match7=Kerry, Kevin, and David Von Erich defeated Frank Dusek, Bill Irwin, and Ten Gu\n|stip7=Six-man tag team match\n|time7=11:30\n|match8=Big Daddy Bundy defeated Al Madril, Armand Hussein, Bill Irwin, Blue Demon, Carlos Zapata, David Von Erich, Frank Dusek, José Lothario, Kerry Von Erich, Killer Tim Brooks, El Negro Assassino, Richard Blood and Ten Gu\n|stip8=Two-ring battle royal\n|time8=\n}}\nReferences"
