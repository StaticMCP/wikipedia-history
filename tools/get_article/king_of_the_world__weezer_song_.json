Chris DeVille at Stereogum described the song as \"[feeling] like ’90s Weezer with room to breathe.\"\nLive performances\nOn March 31, 2016, \"King of the World\" was performed on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in celebration of the release of Weezer's 2016 album. Rivers was dressed as Elvis Presley during the performance. The song was performed the following day on Good Morning America, where a photo was shot with the band and several Major League Baseball mascots.\nMusic video\nA music video for \"King of the World\" was released on January 14, 2016, and was directed by Scantron Films. The video features a bearded man in a king's crown and cape, running along a boardwalk, causing havoc, whom eventually gets caught by a police officer, who arrests him.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Alternative Songs (Billboard)\n| 38\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Rock Airplay Songs (Billboard)\n| 46\n|}\nReferences"
