According to pre-Meiji scholars, his reign spanned the years from 1336 through 1348.\nGenealogy\nHis personal name was Yutahito (豊仁), second son of Emperor Go-Fushimi.  His mother was Neishi (寧子), the daughter of  (西園寺公衡)\n*Naishi: Ogimachi Sanjo Sanemi’s daughter\n**daughter: Jogakuin-dono (長照院; d.1422)\n**daughter\n*Naishi: Mikawa-no-kami’s daughter\n**son: Shuson (周尊)\nEvents of Kōmyō's life\nIn his own lifetime, Kōmyō and those around him believed that he occupied the Chrysanthemum Throne from 20 September 1336 to 18 November 1348.\nWhen Ashikaga Takauji rebelled against Emperor Go-Daigo's Kenmu Restoration and entered Kyōto in 1336, Go-Daigo fled to Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei.  Despite lacking the sacred treasures, Prince Yutahito was enthroned as emperor, beginning the Northern Court.  On the 12th month, 21st day, Go-Daigo escaped to Yoshino, founding the Southern Court.\nOn 18 November 1348, he abdicated in favor of the eldest son of his older brother, the former claimant to the throne Emperor Kōgon, who became Emperor Sukō.\nIn April 1352, taking advantage of the Kan'ō Disturbance, a family feud in the Ashikaga clan, the Southern Emperor Emperor Go-Murakami entered Kyoto, capturing it and carrying away Kōmyō along with Emperor Kōgon, Emperor Sukō, and the Crown Prince Tadahito.  They all ended up finally in Anau, the location of the Southern Court.\nIn the Shōhei Reunification, Kōmyō and his companions were placed under house arrest in Yamato Province, in what is today the village of Nishiyoshino, Yoshino District, Nara.  In 1355, returning to Kyōto, he entered a monastery.\n* 26 July 1380 (Kōryaku 2, 24th day of the 6th month): The former emperor died at age 60.\nEras of Kōmyō's reign\nThe years of Kōmyō's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n:'Nanboku-chō Northern court'\n*Eras as reckoned by pretender Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)\n* Kenmu (continued)\n* Ryakuō\n* Kōei\n* Jōwa\n:'Nanboku-chō Southern court'\n*Eras as reckoned by legitimate Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)\n* Engen\n* Kōkoku\n* Shōhei\nSouthern Court Rivals\n*Emperor Go-Daigo\n*Emperor Go-Murakami\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.
