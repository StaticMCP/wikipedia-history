It is located in Bohinjska Bela, Slovenia. It is \"responsible for training individuals and units for operation in the mountains and other terrains difficult to pass\".\nCurrently, the centre is not fully accredited; full accreditation is planned for 2015.\nOverview\nMN COEMW is based on the Slovenian Military Mountain School, which was formed in 1996. In 2004 school was chosen as site of future COE.\nOn 15 November 2011, Slovenia (as a Framework nation) signed a cooperation agreement with Austria, Hungary, and Italy (as Participating nations) regarding training of soldiers from these three countries in Bohinjska Bela; with this, the Centre became a multinational resource. Several other countries – Germany, Turkey, Canada, and Croatia – are currently planning to apply for membership.\nMission\nPrimary mission of the centre is \"to support the transformation of the forces and assets of mountain warfare\". The four core working areas are as follows: (1) education and training, (2) doctrine and concept development, (3) capability development and support to experimentation and (4) lessons identified and lessons learned processes.\nCurrently Centre provides following courses: Military Mountaineering, Combat Decision-Making in the Mountains, Small Unit Tactics in the Mountains, Surviving in the Mountains, Military Alpine Climbing, Military Mountain Rescue and Military Mountain Guiding.\nSee also\n* List of mountain warfare forces\n* NATO Mountain Warfare Centre of Excellence\n* Slovenian Armed Forces\n* Army Mountain Warfare School (United States)\n* Hatsavita Mountain Warfare Training Centre (Russian Federation)\n* Isonzo Front\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mwcoe.org/  Official Webpage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140219102921/http://www.slovenskavojska.si/en/structure/genneral-staff-commands-and-units/doctrine-development-educational-and-training-command/mountain-school/ Old Official Webpage]"
