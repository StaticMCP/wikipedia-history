He was an accomplished stage leading man, who entered films through the auspices of producer Thomas H. Ince.\nCareer\nIn 1900, Hickman debuted on stage as an extra in a production in San Francisco. He went on to act in repertory theater with the Alcazar Theatre, Morosco, and Melborne MacDowell companies, among others. On Broadway, Hickman wrote, and portrayed Gabby in, The Skirt (1921).\nHickman's initial work in films was with the Lasky Pictures Company, after which he acted with the Triangle Company and later the Ince company.\nIn 1918, Hickman debuted as a director, with The Rainbow (for Paralta studios) as his first film. He directed 19 films.\nWith the rise of the sound film, Hickman returned to the film business but received mostly small roles, often as an authoritarian figure. In 1939, Hickman made a brief appearance as plantation owner John Wilkes, father of Ashley Wilkes, in Gone with the Wind. He ended his film career in 1944, after more than 270 films.\nPersonal life\nHickman was married to actress Bessie Barriscale. He died of a heart attack at his home in San Anselmo on December 31, 1949, six weeks before his 70th birthday and was buried at Mount Tamalpais Cemetery in San Rafael.\nSelected filmography\nAs actor\n(1941)]]\nmodel 2709 is Eugene Gaudio.]]\n*The Circus Man (1914) as Artful Dick Cronk\n*The Cup of Life (1915) as Higsby\n*The Man from Oregon'' (1915) as 'Honest' Jim Martin\n*Civilization (1915) as Count Ferdinand\n*The Picture of Dorian Gray (1915) as Basil Hayward\n*The Moral Fabric (1916) as Mackley Stuart\n*The Wolf Woman (1916) as John Morton\n*The Jungle Child (1916) as Ridgeway Webb\n*Somewhere in France (1916) as Lt.
