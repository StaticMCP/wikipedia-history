Their uncles Counts Anthony I (1505–1573) and John VII (1540–1603) of Oldenburg took up the regency.  Later, the brothers ruled jointly.\nIn 1593, they inherited the County of Honstein, according to an inheritance treaty from 1433.  However, other relatives of the Counts of Honstein also claimed the county, and after a lengthy dispute, the Counts of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen only received a small part of Honstein.\nSchwarzburg-Sondershausen suffered badly during the Thirty Years' War, especially the city of Arnstadt and its surroundings.  The brothers did their best to try to mitigate the burdens of war.\nThe brothers added the north wing to Sondershausen Palace.\nMarriage and issue\nOn 15 November 1612, Christian Günther I married Anna Sibylle (1584–1623), the daughter of Count Albert VII of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.  They had the following children:\n* Anna Juliane (1613–1652)\n* John Günther III (1615–1616)\n* Christian Günther II (1616–1666), nicknamed the Pious, Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen-Arnstadt\n* Catharina Elisabeth (1617–1701), married Henry II of Reuss-Gera\n* Sophie Eleanor (1618–1631)\n* Anton Günther I (1620–1666), Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen\n* Louis Günther II (1621–1681), Count of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen-Ebeleben\n* Sophie Elisabeth (1622–1677)\n* Clara Sabine (1623–1654)\nReferences\n* Friedrich Apfelstedt: Das Haus Kevernburg-Schwarzburg von seinem Ursprunge bis auf unsere Zeit, Arnstadt, 1890\n* Dr. Kamill von Behr: Genealogie der in Europa regierenden Fürstenhäuser, Leipzig, 1870"
