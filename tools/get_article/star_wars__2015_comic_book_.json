Originally written by Jason Aaron with art by John Cassaday, it is set between the 1977 film Star Wars and its 1980 sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, much like the previous comic published in 2013 by Dark Horse Comics. The series features classic Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, , and R2-D2. It was one of three new Star Wars comics by Marvel announced in July 2014, along with Darth Vader and the limited series Princess Leia.\nIt marks the return of the Star Wars license to Marvel Comics, and the first instance of the latter publishing the former's material since the original comic book adaptation back in 1977, as well as its adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back in 1980-to-1981, before the rights were sold to Dark Horse Comics in 1991-to-2014, until The Walt Disney Company bought out Lucasfilm and its subsidiaries in 2012 (having bought out Marvel Entertainment the year prior) and Dark Horse relinquished the rights back to Marvel in 2015 (but not before publishing their final title with the license, Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir). However, in 2022, Lucasfilm and Marvel would enact a dual distribution deal with both IDW Publishing and Dark Horse Comics to publish new Star Wars comic series again.\nIn 2017, Aaron stepped down as the comic's writer and was replaced by Kieron Gillen, while the art was taken over by Salvador Larroca. In 2019, Marvel announced that the series would be finished after 75 issues. The series was relaunched with issue #1 on January 1, 2020, continuing the story after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, written by Charles Soule with art by Jesus Saiz.\nPlot\nThe Star Wars series focuses on Luke, Leia and Han's continued conflict against the Galactic Empire with their fellow Rebel allies soon after the destruction of the first Death Star. As the series begins, Leia leads a covert Rebel mission to destroy an Imperial weapons factory, attracting the attention of Darth Vader. In issues #4–5, Luke returns to Tatooine, searching Obi-Wan Kenobi's abandoned house for anything of interest regarding Obi-Wan or his father. He fights Boba Fett but also discovers Obi-Wan's journals, which Luke reads in issues #7, #15, #20, and #26–30. In issue #6, Fett reveals to Vader that the Rebel pilot who destroyed the Death Star is named Skywalker; the issue also introduces Sana Starros, who is dramatically introduced as Han Solo's wife Sana Solo before revealed to be only legally married to him on one planet during a previous scam, after which Han had stolen her cut. She becomes a recurring character. Issues #13–14 are part of the \"Vader Down\" crossover with the Darth Vader comic series. In issues #16–19, the Rebels enlist the help of antagonist Doctor Aphra. Issues #21–25 involve capturing a Star Destroyer. Issues #26–30 flash back to Yoda's history before the events of The Phantom Menace, as recounted in Obi-Wan's journals. Issues #31–32 are part of \"The Screaming Citadel\" crossover with the Doctor Aphra series. In issues #38–43, the Rebels fight to prevent the Imperials from obtaining kyber crystals on Jedha. In issues #44–49, they try to recruit Mon Cala to the Rebel cause even as the world experiences local unrest. In issues #50–55, the Mon Calamari, including Admiral Ackbar, join their cause, even as Queen Trios of Shu-Torun betrays them, allowing the Empire to attack. Issues #56–61 sees the Rebellion crippled and scattered. In issues #62–67, Leia strikes back against Queen Trios with the aid of the unorthodox Partisans. The closing story arc, told in issues #68–75, sees the Rebels avoiding Imperial probe droids, getting wrapped up in a crime syndicate's conflict with the Empire, and aiding the rock creatures of an unstable world against Imperial forces led by Vader.\nThe 2020 relaunch picks up before the epilogue of The Empire Strikes Back, when Lando Calrissian returns to Cloud City to retrieve Lobot and help Luke look for his lightsaber. Unable to locate his old weapon, Luke learns of a High Republic-era Jedi outpost, where he finds a yellow lightsaber and battles the spirit of the Grand Inquisitor. Leia leads the Rebellion (including the parents of Poe Dameron), but their security codes are compromised by the Empire, forcing the Rebels to improvise. Subsequently, in the War of the Bounty Hunters crossover event, the Rebels try to rescue the frozen Han from Crimson Dawn (led by his old flame Qi'ra), but Fett is able to recover his prize and deliver it to Jabba the Hutt. Crimson Dawn's story continues in the Crimson Reign crossover event and the spin-off miniseries Hidden Empire, while the Rebels prepare to mount their last stand against the Empire.\nCharacters and development\nAaron said in 2014, \"We wanted this to feel like the movies. We wanted to feel like we were hired to do the direct sequel to the original film ... It's very much a team book and we've got all the main players here. Luke, Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and Darth Vader all get big moments in this first arc, and that's our core cast going forward.\" He explained that Luke's story is a main thrust of the comic, considering where the character is at this point in the timeline, adding:\nAaron also noted that Han is in \"an interesting spot at this point in the timeline ... We don't know how fully committed he is to this Rebellion, and we're in the very early stages of his relationship with Leia ... And of course, you know with Han, eventually his past is going to start catching up to him.\"\nPublication\n(left) and writer Jason Aaron (right) at a January 2015 signing at Midtown Comics in Manhattan for Star Wars #1, the first Star Wars comic published by Marvel since 1987.]]\nStar Wars was one of three new Star Wars comics by Marvel announced in July 2014, along with Princess Leia and Darth Vader.
