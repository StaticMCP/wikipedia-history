The Finnish Democratic Republic was only recognised by the Soviet Union and nominally operated in Soviet-occupied areas of Finnish Karelia from the de facto capital of Terijoki. The Finnish Democratic Republic was portrayed by the Soviet Union as the official socialist government of Finland capable of restoring peace, but lost favor as the Soviets sought rapprochement with the Finnish Government. The Finnish Democratic Republic was dissolved and merged into the Karelo-Finnish SSR upon the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty.\nCreation\nsigning an agreement between the USSR and the Finnish Democratic Republic in front of Joseph Stalin.

Terijoki was the first town in Finland captured by the Red Army after the Soviet invasion, and the new government was seated there as its de facto capital. The Finnish Democratic Republic regime was commonly known by the colloquial name the Terijoki Government (, ), but officially the government was called the Finnish People's Government ( ). In Finnish historiography, the government is also occasionally called the Kuusinen Government ( ).\nOtto Wille Kuusinen was chosen as the prime minister and head of government. Kuusinen's cabinet was made up of Soviet citizens and left-wing Finns who had fled to Soviet Russia after the Finnish Civil War.}}\nSoviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov spoke to the German ambassador to the Soviet Union on 30 November—a day before the proclamation of the Finnish Democratic Republic—saying, \"This government will not be Soviet but a democratic republic. Nobody will set up soviets there, but we hope that it will be a government that we can reach agreement with on safeguarding the security of Leningrad.\" Soviet leaflets dropped over Helsinki on the first day of the Winter War stated: \"Finnish Comrades! We come to you not as conquerors, but as liberators of the Finnish people from the oppression of the capitalists and the landlords\".\nRelations with the Soviet Union\nThe Soviet government entered into diplomatic relations with the Finnish Democratic Republic's government immediately after its creation. On the first day of its existence, the Kuusinen regime agreed to lease the Hanko Peninsula; to cede a slice of territory on the Karelian Isthmus; and to sell an island in the Gulf of Finland, along with sections of the Kalastajasaarento near the Arctic Ocean to the Soviet Union.\nOn 2 December 1939, Kuusinen and Molotov signed a mutual assistance agreement and a secret protocol in Moscow. The content of the agreement was very similar to what the Soviet foreign ministry had planned earlier in October 1939, though it never was presented to the Finnish government. According to the new agreement, the Soviet Union would cede a much larger area, Eastern Karelia, except for the Murmansk railroad, in exchange for the same territories that the Soviets had demanded in earlier negotiations from the Republic of Finland.\nAn earlier draft of the Moscow agreement was signed ten days earlier at Petrozavodsk by Andrei Zhdanov for the USSR and Kuusinen for the Republic. The Molotov–Kuusinen agreement mentioned leasing the Hanko Peninsula, and determining the number of troops to be appointed in a separate agreement. Before the 1990s, historians could only speculate about its existence and content.  In 1997, during a joint Finnish-Russian project, Russian professor Oleg Rzesevski discovered the protocol in the Kremlin. The content is quite similar to protocols the Soviet Union signed with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in September–October 1939.\nReaction in Finland and abroad\nThe Finnish Democratic Republic failed to gain support among Finnish workers as the Soviet Union had hoped. Instead, in the face of the invasion, Finnish society became strongly united in what is called the \"Spirit of the Winter War\". The Democratic Republic also failed to gain any international recognition aside from the Soviet Union itself, although a number of prominent left-wing activists and writers such as Jawaharlal Nehru, George Bernard Shaw, Martin Andersen Nexø and John Steinbeck voiced their support for the government. In Nazi Germany, state newspapers gave their support for the Democratic Republic because of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.\nJoseph Stalin was well aware of the domestic political situation in Finland based on Soviet intelligence information, and thus did not anticipate that the establishment of the Democratic Republic would cause any revolutionary action or popular uprisings against the existing Finnish Government.\nThe Kuusinen Government was officially recognised by the Soviet Union and the Soviet satellite states of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Tuvan People's Republic.\nDissolution\nThe Soviets had increasingly begun to seek rapprochement with the Finnish government during the course of the Winter War and the Kuusinen regime fell out of favor. Although the Soviets had captured two-thirds of the Karelian Isthmus, casualties were very high and the upcoming spring thaw threatened their offensive. Both sides were exhausted from the war, but the Soviets held the upper hand and successfully pressured the Finns into peace on Soviet terms. On 12 March 1940, the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed between Finland and the Soviet Union, ending hostilities the following morning. By the terms of the treaty, Finland ceded 9% of its territory to the Soviet Union, though the Soviets' attempt to conquer Finland had failed. Subsequently, the Finnish Democratic Republic became obsolete and merged with the Karelian ASSR within the RSFSR to form the new Karelo-Finnish SSR, a Soviet republic in its own right, after Finland had ceded the areas specified in the treaty to the Soviet Union.\nTerijoki Government\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto;\"\n|-\n!Minister\n!In office\n|-\n| '''Chairman of the People's Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Finland'Otto Wille Kuusinen\n| 1939.2.12 – 1940.12.3\n|-\n| 'Assistant Chairman of the People's Government and Minister of FinanceMauritz Rosenberg\n| 1939.2.12 – 1940.12.3\n|-\n| Minister of DefenseAkseli Anttila\n| 1939.2.12 – 1940.12.3\n|-\n| Minister of Internal AffairsTuure Lehén\n| 1939.2.12 – 1940.12.3\n|-\n| Minister of AgricultureArmas Äikiä\n| 1939.2.12 – 1940.12.3\n|-\n| Minister of EducationInkeri Lehtinen\n| 1939.2.12 – 1940.12.3\n|-\n| Minister of Karelian Affairs'''Paavo Prokkonen\n| 1939.2.12 – 1940.12.3\n|}\nSee also\n* Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic, an earlier, independent socialist state which existed for several months in 1918.\n* Finland-Soviet Union Peace and Friendship Society\n* Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic\n* Commune of the Working People of Estonia\nReferences\nCitations\n}}\nBibliography\n*\n*"
