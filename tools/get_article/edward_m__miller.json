He was appointed research professor of economics and finance, at the University of New Orleans in 1984.\nMiller began writing about the economics of intelligence before expanding to discuss purported correlations of race and intelligence, sex and intelligence, and topics related to eugenics.\nAfter Miller wrote to local New Orleans paper Gambit Weekly in 1996 to object to an earlier story about race and intelligence, Miller was subjected to discipline for using his university position to lend unwarranted weight to views outside his professional competence. Among those who came to Miller's defense was Robert D. Chatelle at the National Writers Union.\nReferences"
