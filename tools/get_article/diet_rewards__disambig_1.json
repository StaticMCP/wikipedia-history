This has been a trend in both the US and the UK. The Biggest Loser reality TV series increased public awareness of the idea of losing weight for cash and the importance of regular weigh-ins.\nEvidence of effectiveness\nSeveral academic studies have concluded that financial incentives are effective for producing weight loss. The Kevin G. Volpp et al. study found that dieters with incentives were five times more likely to reach their goal. How incentives are delivered appears to play a role in their effectiveness. In a 2016 study, insurance premium adjustments as high as $550 were shown to be ineffective in driving weight loss.\nOrganizations and programs\nDirect to consumers\nAmong the current providers of weight loss incentives for consumers are:\n*HealthyWage (US): Pays individuals $200 for losing 10% of their weight, and up to $1,000 for reaching a healthy weight.
