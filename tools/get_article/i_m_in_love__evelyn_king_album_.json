It was produced by Morrie Brown, Willie Lester, Rodney Brown, Kashif, and Lawrence Jones.\nBackground\nBy the time her previous album Call on Me was released, disco music in the United States faced severe backlash across the country pressuring it to move underground. The now infamous so-called \"death of disco\" propelled artists to look elsewhere for inspiration, one of which was the way of \"one-man bands\" pioneered by Stevie Wonder. King was one of the previous successful disco artists who followed the new direction in music, \"my whole thing was, I was a big believer in making sure others were heard because they had a different sound.\" Theodore Life (or T. Life) who produced her chart-topping song \"Shame\" and album Call on Me was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Kashif and songwriters Morrie Brown, and Paul Lawrence Jones III. The songwriting duo Rodney Brown and Willie Lester, who were involved in working with Gayle Adams and Sharon Redd, composed, arranged and produced  \"Don't Hide Our Love,\" \"What Are You Waiting For,\"  \"The Other Side Of Love,\" \"I Can't Take It,\" and \"The Best Is Yet To Come.\" On her producer change King commented, \"I'm not going to say my new producers were a better fit than, say, T. Life. I'm going to just say they were a good match for the time. [...] If you keep staying in the same area, if you sound the same all the time—people can get bored with that. They made sure that Evelyn hit the top spot again! It was just fun.\"\nHistory\nThe album peaked at number 6 on the R&B albums chart and number 28 on the Billboard 200. It produced the hit singles \"I'm In Love\", \"If You Want My Lovin'\", \"Don't Hide Our Love\", and \"Spirit of the Dancer\". The album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD with bonus tracks in 2011 by Big Break Records.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Percussion - Bashiri Johnson\n*Backing vocals - B.J Nelson\n*Lyrics, music by - Kashif Saleem\n*Horns, strings - Ralph Schuckett\n*Guitar - Ira Siegel\n*Drums - Steve Walker\n*French horn - Robert Gloff\n*Mixed by, recorded by – \"Magic Hands\", Steve Goldman (If You Want My Lovin'\")\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1981)\n!Peak\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Top LPs\n|align=\"center\"|28\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Top Soul LPs\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|}\n;Singles\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Single\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| US\n! width=\"40\"| USR&B\n! width=\"40\"| USDance\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|1981\n| align=\"left\"| \"I'm in Love\"\n| 40\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| \"Don't Hide Our Love\"\n| &mdash;\n| 28\n| &mdash;\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\"|1982\n| align=\"left\"| \"Spirit of the Dancer\"\n| &mdash;\n| 51\n| 54\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
