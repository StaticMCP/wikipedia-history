It was announced as featuring 20 teams from the Kings League, with 10 teams from Spain and 10 from the Americas, along with teams from other countries, totaling 32 teams. It was held in Mexico from 26 May to 8 June 2024.\n2024\nFollowing the announcement, it was confirmed that former Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimović would preside over the competition.\nThe Kings World Cup officially began on Sunday, 26 May 2024, with Saiyans FC beating Youniors FC 2–0 in the opening match. The tournament was played in its initial phase in Mexico City. The so-called 'Final Four' changed its location and was held at the Estadio BBVA in Monterrey, where Porcinos FC became the champion after defeating G3X FC 5–3 in the final.\n2025\nBefore the start of the 2024–2025 season, in an introductory video for the campaign uploaded on 7 September 2024, the 2025 edition of the Kings World Cup, renamed to the Kings World Cup Clubs due to the announcement of Kings World Cup Nations, was announced to happen at the end of the season. Spain would send Porcinos FC, the defending champions of the competition, automatically, alongside four teams from Kings League Spain. They were to be joined by four teams from the Americas Kings League and teams from four then-unknown Kings Leagues, as well as \"wildcard\" teams from other countries, for a 32-team tournament.
