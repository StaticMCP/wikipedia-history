The CAA was founded in 1968 by a group of archaeologists that included William E. Taylor, the head of the Archaeology Division at the National Museum of Canada. The organization's first publication was named the Bulletin. In 1977 it was renamed the Canadian Journal of Archaeology.\nSmith-Wintemberg Award\nThe Smith-Wintemberg Award (also known as the Smith-Wintemberg Medal) was established by the CAA in 1978. It recognises outstanding lifetime contributions to Canadian archaeology and is named for the pioneering archaeologists Harlan I. Smith and William J. Wintemberg. The nomination process is rigorous, requiring at least two letters of recommendation from peers, and as such the award is not given every year, only on merit.
