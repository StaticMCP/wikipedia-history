Within the Southern Pacific Ocean, most tropical cyclones form within the cyclone season which began on November 1 and will end on April 30, though occasionally cyclones form outside these times. The scope of this article is limited to tropical cyclones that form in the Indian Ocean 160°E and 120°W to the south of the equator. Should a tropical cyclone form to the west of 160°E then it will be monitored within the Australian region by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, should a tropical cyclone form to the east of 120°W, it is unclear how it will be handled as no tropical cyclone has ever been observed in the South Pacific Ocean east of 120°W.\nWhen a Tropical Disturbance forms or moves into the South Pacific, it is assigned a number and monitored by Météo-France who run the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) on Réunion Island. Should a tropical disturbance intensify and become a moderate tropical storm the two sub-regional tropical cyclone Advisory Centres in Maurtius and Madagascar in conjunction with RSMC La Réunion. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also issue warnings on tropical cyclones in this region assigning a number with an \"S\" suffix. When monitoring a tropical cyclone the Joint Typhoon Warning Center will assess the cyclones intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale whilst RSMC La Réunion, Maurtius and Madagascar use the Southwest Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale to assess a tropical cyclones intensity.\nTimeline\nNovember\n;November 1\n* 0000 UTC, (1200 FST)&nbsp;— The 2009–10 South Pacific cyclone
