Prior to doing so, each of the Australian colonies were responsible for their own defence, and all had separate colonial armies. As each colonial army was responsible for the defence of their own colony, each colony separately contracted the purchase of their own equipment, so at the time that each colonial army merged into the newly formed Australian Army, there was a variety of incompatible equipment used by the various interstate units.\nOne of the first tasks of the newly formed Army following restructure and the creation of unified hierarchy and command chains, was to uniformly equip the new national army. This was no easy task, as at the time of the foundation of the Australian Army, all six colonial armies were in the field involved in  the Second Boer War. Whilst badge-changing ceremonies were performed and hats and uniforms supplied, it proved impractical to fully re-equip in the field. Consequently, the Martini–Henry rifle, which was favoured by the majority of colonial units, continued in use until about 1910.\nSecond Boer War\nThe Australian Army was founded by a merger of the six separate armies of the six independent Australian British colonies. When those forces merged officially on 1 March 1901, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, all six colonies had troops already engaged in combat in the field. It was obviously impossible and unnecessary  to completely re-equip and re-uniform the forces while they were deployed, and most of the colonial armies wore similar khaki uniforms anyway. A symbolic ceremony to replace colonial badges was held in the field during which Australian soldiers were given the Rising Sun Badge, the new symbol of the Australian Army, for the first time.\nInfantry weapons\nSide-arms\n* Beaumont–Adams revolver (.450 calibre)\n* Enfield revolver (.476 calibre)\n* Webley revolver (.455 calibre)\nLong-arms\n* Martini–Henry rifle (.577/.450 calibre)\n* Snider–Enfield rifle (.577 calibre)\n* Lee–Enfield rifle (.303 calibre)\n* Lee–Metford rifle (.303 calibre)\nHorses\n* Waler horse\nFirst World War\nBy the outbreak of World War I, the equipment of the Australian Army had become standardised, and was essentially the same as most of the armies of the British Empire. The one major difference was the preference of kangaroo leather over canvas for webbing and other equipment, straps and belts.\n{| border=0 style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| width=33% valign=top |\nInfantry weapons\nSide-arms\n* Enfield revolver (.476 calibre)\n* Webley revolver (.455 calibre)\nLong-arms\n* Lee–Enfield rifle (.303 calibre)\nGrenade\n* Jam Tin Grenade\n* Mills Bomb\nLight machine-gun\n* Lewis Gun (.303 calibre)\n* Hotchkiss Gun (.303 calibre) used by the Light Horse\nHeavy machine-gun\n* Vickers machine gun (.303 calibre)\n|  width=33% valign=top |Infantry-support\n* Stokes Mortar (3&nbsp;inch calibre)\nHorses\n* Waler horse\nArtillery\nTrench Mortar\n* Garland Trench Mortar (65mm)\n* 2 inch Medium Mortar\nHeavy mortar\n* 9.45 inch Heavy Mortar\nField guns\n* 4.5 inch Howitzer\n* 18-Pounder Field Gun\n|  width=33% valign=top |\nVehicles\nArmoured Cars\n* Model T Ford (with mounted Lewis Gun)\n* Rolls-Royce Type A (with mounted Lewis Gun)\n* 50 HP Daimler (with mounted M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun)\n* 60 HP Mercedes (with mounted M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun)\n* 50 HP Minerva (with mounted M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun)\n|}\nAircraft\n(The Australian Flying Corps which served in WWI was an Army unit, not a separate airforce.)\n{| border=0 style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| width=50% valign=top |\n*  Airco DH 5\n*  Airco DH.6\n*  Armstrong Whitworth F.K.3\n*  Avro 504\n*  Bleriot XI\n*  Bristol Boxkite\n*  Bristol F.2 Fighter\n*  Bristol Scout\n*  Caudron G.3\n*  Curtiss JN Jenny\n*  Deperdussin\n*  Grahame-White Type XV Boxkite\n*  Handley Page 0/400\n*  Martinsyde S.1\n*  Martinsyde G.100\n|  width=50% valign=top |\n*  Martinsyde G.102\n*  Farman MF.7 Longhorn\n*  Farman MF.11 Shorthorn\n*  Maurice Farman Seaplane/Landplane\n*  Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2\n*  Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12\n*  Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2\n*  Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8\n*  Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5A\n*  Sopwith Buffalo (two prototypes for trials only)\n*  Sopwith Baby (one aircraft flown by the Royal Australian Navy in 1917)\n*  Sopwith Camel (AFC, RAN)\n*  Sopwith Pup (AFC, RAN)\n*  Sopwith Snipe\n*  Sopwith 1½ Strutter (AFC, RAN)\n|}\nSecond World War\nAt the beginning of World War II, the Australian Army was continuing with the practice of sourcing military equipment from the United Kingdom as it had done in the colonial era and the first three decades of the twentieth century. However, as the war progressed, Britain's difficulties in keeping up production demand, Australia's geographic isolation, and a differing focus on war policies and theatres, caused Australia increasingly to obtain arms, equipment, and military assistance from the United States.\n{| border=0 style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| width=33% valign=top |\nInfantry weapons\nSide-arms\n* Enfield Revolver MK II (.38 calibre)\n* Webley Revolver MK IV (.38 calibre)\n* Smith & Wesson Victory (.38 calibre)\n* Webley Revolver MK VI (.455 calibre)\nRifles\n* Lee–Enfield SMLE No.1 MkIII* Rifle (.303 calibre)\n* Lee–Enfield No.4 MkI/MkI* Rifle (.303 calibre) (used in small quantities by frontline forces.

Whilst there were minor changes such as the replacement of the British QF 4.5 inch Howitzer by the American-built 105 mm Howitzer M3 as the primary artillery piece, the most dramatic changes to Australian equipment during the Korean War period were to the aircraft used by the Royal Australian Air Force. Important lessons learned during the Korean War later influenced the way the Australian Army re-equipped to adapt to the needs of modern warfare in time for the Australian Army's entry into the Vietnam War.\n{| border=0 style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| width=50% valign=top |\nInfantry weapons\nSide-arms\n* Enfield Revolver MK II (.380 calibre)\n* Webley Revolver MK IV (.38 calibre)\n*M1911\nLong-arms\n* Lee–Enfield SMLE No.1 MkIII* Rifle (.303 calibre)\n* Lee–Enfield No.4 MkI Rifle (.303 calibre) (in limited use)\nGrenade\n* Mills Bomb M36\nSub-machine-guns\n* Owen Gun (9mm calibre)\n* Sterling Submachine Gun (Trials)\nLight machine-gun\n* Bren Gun (.303 calibre)\nHeavy machine-gun\n* Vickers Machine Gun (.303 calibre)\n|  width=50% valign=top |Infantry-support\n*  SBML 2 inch Mortar\n* Ordnance ML 3 inch Mortar\n* M2A2 flamethrower\nAnti-armour\n* M20 Bazooka (89&nbsp;mm)\n* Ordnance QF 17 pounder\n|}\nVietnam War\nThe Vietnam War proved to be a highly mobile operation for Australian forces, who often engaged their enemies during arduous jungle patrols through thick and difficult terrain. Much of the equipment used on the battlefields of the Korean War proved to be too cumbersome for this type of warfare, including long-arms such as the Lee–Enfield SMLEs. However, the Australian Army had become an expert at jungle warfare during their campaigns in South-East Asia against the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II, and the lessons in jungle warfare they had learned proved invaluable in the choosing of equipment for the Vietnam War. Long rifles continued to be used by snipers, but infantry patrols favoured the use of assault rifles such as the L1A1 and M16. The heavy machine-guns which were useful for the static defences of the Korean War were replaced by the lighter general-purpose M60 machine gun, which was man-portable by a patrol machine-gunner.\n{| border=0 style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| width=50% valign=top |\nInfantry weapons\nSide-arms\n* Colt 1911A1 (.45 calibre)\n* L9A1 Browning Hi-Power (9×19mm Parabellum)\nLong-arms\n* L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (licensed FN FAL derivative) (7.62 calibre)\n* M14 rifle (used by the Special Air Service Regiment)\n* M21 Sniper Weapon System (used on a small scale by Australian troops in the later years of the Vietnam War)\nGrenades\n* M26 grenade\n* M79 grenade launcher\n* /  various smoke grenades\nAssault rifles\n* Colt M16A1 (5.56 calibre)\n* Colt M16A1 (5.56 calibre) fitted with under-barrel M203 grenade launcher\nSub-machine-guns\n* F1 submachine gun (9×19mm Parabellum)\n* Owen Gun (9×19mm Parabellum)\n* Sterling submachine gun (used by Australian SAS troopers in Vietnam)\n* CAR-15 (5.56 calibre) (used by Australian SAS troopers)\nGeneral-purpose machine gun\n* M60 machine gun (7.62 calibre)\n* L2A1 LMG SLR Varient (7.62 calibre)\n* L4A1 Bren Varient (7.62 calibre)\n* L3(A3&A4) GPMG Browning M1919 Varients (.30-06 calibre)\n* M2HB Heavy Machinegun (.50 calibre)\n|  width=50% valign=top |Infantry-support\n* L16 81mm Mortar\n* M2A1-7 flamethrower\nAnti-personnel\n* M18A1 Claymore Antipersonnel Mine\nAnti-armour\n* M72 Light Anti-tank Weapon\n* M20 Bazooka\n* ENTAC Anti-tank guided missile\nArtillery\n* M2A2 howitzer\n* L5 (Aust) Pack Howitzer 105-mm (103 Battery)\nVehicles\n* Land Rover series\nArmoured Personnel Carriers\n* M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier\n* Fire Support vehicle (FSV) (hybrid of M113 with Alvis Saladin turret fitted)\nTanks\n* Centurion tank\nAircraft\n* Cessna 180\n* Pilatus PC-6\n* Bell H-13 Sioux\n* UH-1 Iroquois (RAAF)\n* DHC-4 Caribou (RAAF)\n* Canberra Bomber (RAAF)\n|}\nLate 20th Century\nAfter the Vietnam war the Australian Army suffered severe budget cut-backs, and expenditure on equipment decreased as a result. The army was scaled back in size, and experienced a period of very little overseas deployment for the first time in the post–World War II period. Despite this the Army did manage to continue to modernise its weaponry and equipment. During the 1980s traditional long-arms such as the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (SLR) were phased out and finally  withdrawn from front line service by 1990, and replaced by the locally produced F88 Austeyr, a derivative of the Austrian Steyr AUG which is still in service . During the 1980s the khaki field uniforms that had been used by the Australian Army since its foundation in 1901 were replaced by Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform.\n{| border=0 style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:left;\"\n|-\n| width=50% valign=top |\nInfantry weapons\nSide-arms\n* L9A1 Browning Hi-Power (9×19mm Parabellum)\nLong-arms\n* L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (licensed FN FAL derivative) (7.62 calibre)\n* Parker Hale M82 (.308 calibre Sniper-Rifle)\nGrenades\n* F1 grenade\n* M79 grenade launcher\n* /  various smoke grenades\nAssault rifles\n* F88 Austeyr (locally produced Steyr AUG derivative, adopted 1988, still in use) (5.56 NATO calibre)\n* M16A1 /M16S1 Used by the Australian Army until 1989 when the F88 Austeyr came into service.
