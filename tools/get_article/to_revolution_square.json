During the movie, people come to listen to strange radio news while they are on the bus. They don't react particularly to the unbelievable reports, though, and are incredibly detached.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.instagram.com/hosseinrajabian/ Hossein Rajabian Official Website]\n* [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/02/a-jailed-iranian-musician-texts-from-his-hospital-bed-dont-forget-me/ washington post]\n* [http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/index.php?m=157&c=3&id_film=100076571&o= International Film Festival Clermont]\n* [http://cultureactioneurope.org/news/arj-carries-an-international-campaign-for-human-rights-in-iran/ Culture action europe]\n* [http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/index.php?m=157&c=3&id_film=100076571&o= International Film Festival Clermont]\n* [http://www.tasteofcinema.com/2016/the-10-best-iranian-films-of-2015/2/ The 10 Best Iranian Films of 2015]"
