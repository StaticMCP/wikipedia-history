This  story wood-frame house was built in 1876 for William Hayward, a banker and business partner of the locally prominent mill owner Moses Taft.  The house is an excellent local example of Italianate styling, although its elaborate porch is a later c. 1900 modification.  The property also has a period carriage house in good condition and has been occupied by the George and Louise Kurzon family for 100 years.\nOn October 7, 1983, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Uxbridge, Massachusetts\nReferences"
