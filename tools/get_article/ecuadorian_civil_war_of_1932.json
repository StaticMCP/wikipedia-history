Widespread unemployment and poor living conditions led to the unopposed military coup of 1931, effectively ending the rule of president Isidro Ayora. Supported by the far-right, lower class movement of Compactación Obrera Nacional,  became the Ecuadorian president.\nIn August 1932, a variety of liberal and leftist Congress members blocked Bonifaz's assumption of power, thus starting the war.\nCivil war\nA four-day conflict ensued. The Quito garrison, supported by pro presidential paramilitaries succeeded in suspending the work of the Congress. Despite the initial success, Bonifaz failed to remain in power, as the majority of the armed forces stationed in Quito avoided any involvement in the conflict. Aided by provincial regiments, the anti-presidential paramilitaries later restored the Congress into power, ending Bonifaz's reign. Over 2,000 people were killed in the fighting.\nIn popular culture\nExperiences related to the Ecuadorian civil war have inspired a large number of Oswaldo Guayasamín's early works, including  \"Los Niños Muertos\".\nFootnotes"
