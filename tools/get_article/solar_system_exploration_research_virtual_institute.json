Supported by the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) and the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD), SSERVI is a NASA program office located at the NASA Ames Research Center and was modeled on the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) with dispersed teams across the nation working together to help lead the agency's research activities related to NASA's human exploration goals. Competitively selected team investigations focused on one or more aspects of lunar science investigations of the Moon (including lunar samples), from the Moon, and on the Moon.\nIn 2013 the NLSI became the Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute and expanded its scope to include Near-Earth asteroids and Phobos and Deimos.\nTeams\nThe Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI) is composed of 12 U.S. teams, and 11 international partners. The teams are listed below:\nCurrent US teams\nCurrent US teams are:\n;CAN-2 selections\n* Network for Exploration and Space Science (NESS); principal investigator Jack Burns, University of Colorado in Boulder, CO.\n**Focus: Conducting research in robotics, cosmology, astrophysics and heliophysics.\n**https://www.colorado.edu/ness\n* Exploration Science Pathfinder Research for Enhancing SS Observations (ESPRESSO); principal investigator Alex Parker, Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, CO.\n**Focus: A range of science and operations objectives relevant to characterizing target surfaces and mitigating hazards that create risk for robotic and human explorers.\n**https://www.espresso.institute\n* Toolbox for Research and Exploration (TREX); principal investigator Amanda Hendrix, Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, AZ.\n**Focus: Laboratory spectral measurements and experiments, data analysis, surface characteristics & ISRU on airless bodies.\n**https://trex.psi.edu\n* Radiation Effects on Volatiles and Exploration of Asteroids & Lunar Surfaces (REVEALS); principal investigator Thomas Orlando, Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA.\n**Focus: Radiation chemistry, volatile formation, volatile sequestration and transport, regolith and composite materials.\n**https://reveals.gatech.edu\n;CAN-3 selections\n* Center for Lunar and Asteroid Surface Science (CLASS); principal investigator Dan Britt, University of Central Florida (UCF) in Orlando.\n**Focus: Regolith of the Moon and asteroids, specifically looking at the physical properties and resources of regolith and its behavior in the space environment. CLASS also will create soil simulants that will help other teams and the broader science community in this research area.\n* – Interdisciplinary Consortium for Evaluating Volatile Origins (ICE FIVE-O); principal investigator Jeffrey Gillis-Davis, at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa in Honolulu.\n**Focus: Remote sensing of airless bodies and how things weather in space. Modeling the physical, chemical, and isotopic signatures around the Moon’s polar regions. ICE FIVE-O will address curation protocols for sample return and the evolution of volatiles, or low-boiling point compounds, and minerals within long-duration, curated samples.\n* Remote, In Situ, and Synchrotron Studies for Science and Exploration 2 (RISE2); principal investigator Timothy Glotch, Stony Brook University in New York.\n**Focus: This team will investigate how planetary environments impact human health by looking at the chemical reactivity of regolith in association with animal cells and tissues. RISE2 also will analyze how remote sensing datasets can be confirmed through laboratory experiments, analyses, and field deployments.\n* Resource Exploration and Science of OUR Cosmic Environment (RESOURCE); principal investigator Jennifer Heldmann, NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley.\n**Focus: This team focuses on determining what volatiles are available on the Moon for in-situ resource utilization. It will assess the quantity and availability of resources on the Moon, test the technology required for processing those resources, and field test the concepts of operations required for sustained human lunar presence.\n* Institute for Modeling Plasmas, Atmospheres, and Cosmic Dust (IMPACT); principal investigator Mihaly Horanyi, University of Colorado Boulder.\n**Focus: This team will measure micron-sized dust impacts in icy regolith using the world’s fastest “dust impact” facility, and they will develop hardware to determine secondary particle generation and examine how that hardware degrades over time. IMPACT also will use laboratory experiments to help validate theories of dust and volatile mobility and modeling efforts being completed by other SSERVI teams.\n* Lunar Environment And Dynamics for Exploration Research (LEADER); principal investigator Rosemary Killen, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n**Focus: This team will focus on plasma interactions with airless bodies and determine the effects of the space environment on robotic and human assets at various geographic locations on the Moon. The team also will model the radiation environments and related effects associated with space exploration.\n* Center for Lunar Science and Exploration (CLSE); principal investigator David Kring, Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.\n**Focus: Through modeling and geochemical analyses, this team will track the distribution and form of volatiles from the early solar system to the formation of the Moon and subsequent evolution to today. This team will analyze the volatile cycle on the Moon to determine overall source and loss mechanisms and how we can use these resources.\n* Geophysical Exploration Of the Dynamics and Evolution of the Solar System (GEODES); principal investigator Nicholas Schmerr, University of Maryland in College Park.\n**Focus: This team will use geophysical modeling and laboratory techniques to characterize the overall evolution, stability, and volatile content of the Moon and asteroid subsurfaces.
