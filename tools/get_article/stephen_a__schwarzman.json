He is the chairman and CEO of the private equity firm Blackstone Inc., which he established in 1985 with Peter G. Peterson. Schwarzman was chairman of President Donald Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.\nAccording to Forbes, Schwarzman has a net worth of US$43 billion as of May 2025.\nEarly life and education\nSchwarzman was raised in a Jewish family in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the son of Arline and Joseph Schwarzman. His father owned Schwarzman's, a former dry-goods store in Philadelphia, and was a graduate of the Wharton School.\nSchwarzman's first business was a lawn-mowing operation when he was 14 years old, employing his younger twin brothers, Mark and Warren, to mow while Stephen brought in clients.\nSchwarzman attended the Abington School District in suburban Philadelphia and graduated from Abington Senior High School in 1965. He attended Yale University, where he was a member of senior society Skull and Bones and founded the Davenport Ballet Society. After graduating in 1969, he briefly served in the U.S. Army Reserve before attending Harvard Business School, where he graduated in 1972.\nInvestment career\nSchwarzman's first job in financial services was with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, an investment bank that merged with Credit Suisse in 2000. After business school, Schwarzman worked at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, became a managing director at age 31, and then head of global mergers and acquisitions. In 1985, Schwarzman and his boss, Peter Peterson, started The Blackstone Group, which initially focused on mergers and acquisitions. Blackstone branched into business acquisition, real estate, direct lending, alternative assets, and had $1.1 trillion in assets under management as of September 30, 2024.\nWhen Blackstone went public in June 2007, it revealed in a securities filing that Schwarzman had earned about $398.3 million in fiscal 2006. He ultimately received $684 million for the part of his Blackstone stake he sold in the IPO, keeping a stake then worth $9.1 billion. In the following years, his compensations increased even more: he received $350 million in 2007 and $702.4 million in 2008—partly due to stock awards. His salary was $734.2 million in 2015, $425 US million in 2016 and $786 US million in 2017. In 2022, he was paid $253 million, making him the highest paid CEO in the US that year.\nIn June 2007, Schwarzman described his view on financial markets with the statement: \"I want war, not a series of skirmishes ...

It's like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.\" Schwarzman later apologized for the analogy. In 2012, Obama called Schwarzman and requested his assistance in brokering a budget agreement with Republicans in congress to avoid a fiscal cliff.

At the same time, he had positive things to say about Hillary Clinton.\nIn early 2016, he said that in a two-candidate race he would prefer Donald Trump to Ted Cruz, saying that the nation needed a \"cohesive, healing presidency, not one that's lurching either to the right or to the left.\" He had previously made a donation to Marco Rubio in 2014.\nIn late 2016, Schwarzman \"helped put together\" a team of corporate executives to advise Trump on jobs and the economy.

Several of the Republicans he funded voted against certifying the 2020 Presidential Election.\nIn private, Schwarzman called the January 6 United States Capitol attack an \"insurrection\" and \"an affront to the democratic values we hold dear\". However, he stopped short of criticizing Trump over the riot.\nIn 2022, Schwarzman indicated that he would not support the Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign, providing in a statement to Axios that it was \"time for the Republican Party to turn to a new generation of leaders.\" In 2024, Schwarzman announced that he would support Donald Trump as a \"vote for change.\"\nIn 2025, Schwarzman said the tariff situation in the US had put Europe in a unique position to capture more investment from those looking to diversify away from uncertain markets.\nIn the fall of 2025, Schwarzman became a key player in efforts to resolve the longstanding dispute between the Trump administration and Harvard University over university policies and billions of dollars in research funds.\nIn October 2025, Schwarzman was named by the White House as a donor to the construction of the White House State Ballroom, a proposed 90,000-square-foot expansion of the East Wing.\nIn November 2025, Schwartzman attended a red carpet dinner at the White House for Saudi dictator Mohammed bin Salman.
