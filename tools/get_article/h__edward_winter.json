Edward Winter and Edward Winter, he wrote several books on enameling and produced enamel murals for churches and the Section of Painting and Sculpture.\nBiography\nHarold Edward Winter was born in Pasadena, California, to John Edward Winter and Lila (Deveny) Winter. He studied art in Vienna, and went on to teach at the Cleveland Institute of Art (1935–37) and Old White Art Colony in West Virginia.\nIn December 1939, he married the ceramist Thelma Frazier. Winter died in 1976, and his wife died the following year.\nWork\n]]\nWinter created abstract compositions with occasional botanical or biomorphic elements. He employed copper, steel, silver, or aluminum as his substrate and sometimes used foil inlays in addition to the enamel colors. The works ranged from household tableware to large wall plaques. In the 1950s, Thelma started working in enamel as well, and the pair worked both independently and collaboratively on various projects. They created a number of sizable enamel murals, including eleven commissioned by churches.\nWinter wrote Enamel Art on Metals (1958), Enameling for Beginners (1962), and Enamel Painting Techniques (1970), as well as many articles on his medium. The first of these was praised as an important book from a master of the craft when it first appeared.\nDuring World War II, while serving as a technical sergeant, Winter received a special commission from the U.S. Army to make educational posters.\nIn the 1960s, Winter offered a kit for making enameled aluminum jewelry.\nHis work is in the Cleveland Museum of Art, the  Butler Museum of Art, and other institutions.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://ead.ohiolink.edu/xtf-ead/view?docId=ead/OCLWHi0410.xml H.
