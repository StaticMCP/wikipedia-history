The skirmish took place near modern-day Palmersville, Tennessee. The skirmish derives its name from the ford and gristmill on the nearby northern fork of the Obion River owned by Marshall Lockridge.\nBackground\nof the 5th Iowa Cavalry Regiment.]]\n5th Iowa Cavalry Regiment\nAfter the successful capture of Paris, Tennessee in March, 1862 Colonel William Warren Lowe of the 5th Iowa Cavalry Regiment, at the time nicknamed the \"Curtis Horse\", detached several of his cavalry companies to different areas of central and western Tennessee. On March 27, 1862, a detachment of Companies C, I, and M under the command of Alfred Bruce Brackett were sent to Savannah, Tennessee to protect telegraph wires of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps. Brackett's detachment was later sent to Fort Heiman on August 29, 1862. Other detachments of the 5th Iowa were also operating in western Tennessee under Colonel Lowe. Up until this point in time the 5th Iowa Cavalry Regiment had not yet taken part in any battles.\nFollowing the Battle of Shiloh Colonel Lowe ordered a detachment of Companies E, F, and G under the command of Major Carl Schaeffer Boernstein, a German emigrant, nobleman, and veteran of the 1st Iowa Infantry Regiment, to perform reconnaissance in the direction of Dresden and Como, Tennessee. Major Boernstein's officers included; Captain Charles C. Nott (Company E), Captain William A. Haw (Company F), and Captain Henning Von Minden (Company G). Roughly two-thirds of Boernstein's command were German Americans including the majority of the officers of the detachment.\nBoernsein's force was ordered to travel to Henry Station to intercept the supplies, they were successful in this endeavor and captured roughly $15,000 worth of food along with other military supplies. On May 3, 1862, Colonel Lowe ordered Boernsein's detachment to travel to Como, Tennessee in order to intercept a wagon train of supplies including medicine which was reportedly taken from Paducah, Kentucky by elements of the Army of West Tennessee. While at Como the column found no trace of the wagon train an set up camp. Meanwhile, Captain Nott and 25 men stayed behind the main column to capture any guerrilla fighters following them. The column later continued westward towards the direction of Dresden, Tennessee. While staying behind Notts ascertained that there was a significant force of nearly 3,000 Confederate cavalry were near Caledonia, Tennessee marching towards Paris.\nConfederate interception\nDuring this time Confederate States Army General P. G. T. Beauregard had planned to raid Paris, Tennessee and sent elements of the 7th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment, under the overall command of Colonel Thomas Claiborne and Colonel William Hicks Jackson, some 1,250 men in total. Colonel Claiborne and the 6th Tennessee Cavalry Battalion reached Trenton, Tennessee on May 2, when they received word that the 7th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment under Colonel Jackson were on its way to McKenzie's Station to support them. While on his way towards Paducah Claiborne was warned of Borenstein's detachment, Clairborne chose to intercept the Federal force and destroy it before his troop movements were discovered. Clairborne's column was broken up into 3 detachments; one column was under Lieutenant colonel James Pell, which was ordered to Boydsville, Kentucky and Tennessee to cut off a possible retreat, the two other columns were sent to pursue and overtake the intruders. Colonel Jackson was given the lead column which consisted of several companies of the 7th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. Claiborne would remain with the final column and serve as the main attacking force.\nEncampment at Lockridge Mill\nOn the evening of May 6, 1862 while heading towards Dresden Borenstein's column came across the Lockridge Mill, a 400 acre farm and gristmill on the Obion River 12 miles north of Dresden which was owned by Marshall Lockridge and was operated by a large number of salves. Borenstein's column set up a bivouac at Lockridge's property and detailed 45 men to set up three lines of pickets along the southern outer perimeter near the Dresden-Mayfield Road to safeguard the dismounted cavalry from surprise attacks. One of several mistakes Borenstein made during this time was placing one of the pickets, Company F under Captain William A. Haw, nearly half a mile away (.08&nbsp;km) from the main camp. Another mistake was ignoring the advice of his subordinate officers to set up their encampment on the north side of the Obion River, Borenstein instead chose to encamp on the southern side of the river crossing which allowed his force to be easily overwhelmed.\nBattle\nAround 5:30pm on May 6, 1862, as the final picket post was being organized and the cavalrymen made their supper and watered their horses they were suddenly attacked by Confederate mounted skirmishers under the command of Confederate Colonel Claiborne. The Union pickets did not have enough time to warn the main encampment of the Confederate skirmishers as they were mounted and within 70 yards by the time they engaged. As the men of the 5th Iowa scrambled to saddle their horses Major Boernstein ordered the column to retreat back across the Obion River and destroy the bridge. During the ensuing chaos Major Boernstein was nowhere to be found, Captain Charles C. Nott of Company E took command of several squadrons and attempted to rally the panic stricken cavalrymen into line, but to no avail.\nCaptain Charles C. Nott of Company E recalls the attack stating: \"Saddle up, and fall in,\" I shouted to the men; \"and you men in the house call the major; tell him we are attacked.\" My men were in line, but a disorderly stream of flying men and riderless horses was pouring past. I looked for the major, but he was not in sight, and I found myself the ranking officer there. \"I must act, it is not time to wait for orders,\" I said, as I looked up the valley, and saw the head of the rebel column. They were coming on a gallop, their shotguns and rifles blazed away, and their wild yells were louder than the volleys they fired. Between us were the last of the rear guard and the horses of those who had fallen, \"wild and disorderly.\" Turning the other way, I saw the river and the bridge. \"We must check their advance,\" I thought, \"and then cross the river and tear up the bridge; it is our only hope. I will charge them.\" I touched my good horse as I drew my sabre, and he flew round. I was giving the orders, \"Draw sabre. By platoons, left wheel,\" and the squadron was executing them, when the men of the second squadron rushed frantically round the barnyard fence and into my line. In an instant all was confusion. There was no time to restore order, the rebels were not the width of a city block distant, and their buck shot flew thickly, wounding men and horses, while there rose the thundering sound of cavalry at full speed. I still had a hope of the bridge. In another instant they would be upon us. I cried, \"gallop and form across the bridge.\"\nof Company E took command of the 5th Iowa during the battle. Nott later fought in the 131st New York Volunteer Infantry and 176th New York Volunteer Infantry achieving the rank of Colonel.]]\nFearing for the life of his men Captain Nott ordered a general retreat towards the Dresden-Mayfield road. The majority of the command along with much of the 5th Iowa were able to cross the bridge, however, several of the company commanders were wounded or captured including Captain William A. Haw and Henning Von Minden, the same was true for many of the non-commissioned officers and enlisted men. Captain Nott, although severely wounded, was able to escape with 58 men and 48 horses to Paducah, Kentucky. Captain Nott later returned to Lockridge Mill in October 1862 and remarked \"What a strong position it is! How easily we could have held it, had we been armed like the enemy\".\nAftermath\nwho wounded Major Boernstein.]]\nDuring the skirmish Major Boernstein was mortally wounded in a saber fight with Confederate Captain John Goff Ballentine. Ballentine approached Boernstein within six feet until Boernstein exclaimed \"My pistol is empty; draw your sword!\", to which Ballentine complied, a duel ensued between the two officers. Both Boernstein and Ballentine were wounded and taken to Dresden in the same wagon. Before his death Boernstein awarded Captain Ballentine his horse, pistol, and saber as his lawful spoils of war, he later died on May 7, 1862, from his wounds. Likewise, Captain Haw of Company F attempted to cut his way through the enemy with his men but was severely wounded in the head by a saber and taken prisoner. The death of Major Boernstein was a hard loss to the regiment. Boernstein's body was taken back to his home in Dubuque, Iowa.\nCasualties of the 5th Iowa Cavalry vary dependent on the source, Colonel Claiborne's official report states, \"Killed 6, wounded 16, and captured 4 officers and 67 non-commissioned officers and privates\". Claiborne also captured two wagons, 56 horses, and many small arms of the 5th Iowa Cavalry. Colonel William Warren Lowe's official report states: 1 Officer killed in action, 3 Officers wounded in action, 1 non-commissioned officer wounded, 3 Privates killed, 2 Privates wounded. Colonel Lowe confirms that the majority were taken prisoner stating \"Our loss in prisoners cannot as yet be actually ascertained, but will, I presume, number about 60, as Captain Nott has reached Paducah with 58 men and 48 horses\". The prisoners of the 5th Iowa Cavalry were first sent to Jackson, Mississippi and later to Corinth, Mississippi where they were paroled and exchanged on May 15, 1862. The officers of the detachment including Captain William A. Haw, Captain Henning Von Minden, and Lieutenant Richard Van Vredenburgh however were all held in captivity until October 15, 1862.\nClaiborne claimed that he took no casualties during the skirmish in his official report stating \"the loss on our side was not one; a few scratches were received\". Contrasting this statement are Captain Ballentine, Private O'Kelly, and a Sergeant R.J. Black who would all require medical assistance.\nLegacy\nA commemorative plaque marks the site of the Battle of Lockridge Mill near Palmersville in Weakley County, Tennessee. The marker itself was erected by the Tennessee Historical Commission (Marker Number 4A 44). The marker is at the intersection of Tennessee State Route 190 at milepost 34 and West New Hope Church Road, on the right when traveling north on Tennessee Route 190.\nReferences"
