From the time of Irish independence, it was not represented in the UK Parliament, as Laois was no longer part of the United Kingdom.\nBoundaries\nThis constituency comprised the eastern part of Queen's County now known as County Laois.\nThe Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 defined the division as including the Baronies of Ballyadams, Cullenagh, Maryborough East, Slievemargy, and Stradbally, and that part of the Barony of Portnahinch not contained within the Ossory constituency.\nMembers of Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1885\n| Richard Lalor\n| Irish Parliamentary Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1892\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Mark MacDonnell\n| Anti-Parnellite Nationalist\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1900\n| Irish Parliamentary Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1906\n| Patrick Aloysius Meehan\n| Irish Parliamentary Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1913 by-election\n| Patrick Joseph Meehan\n| Irish Parliamentary Party\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|1918\n|colspan=\"2\"| ''Constituency merged into Queen's County''\n|}\nElections\nElections in the 1880s\n}}\nElections in the 1890s\nElections in the 1900s\nElections in the 1910s\nReferences\n*\n*"
