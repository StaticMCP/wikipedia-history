The County Donegal Railway Restoration Society restored the centre, which opened in 1995 and is housed in the old station house of Donegal Railway Station in Donegal Town. Today, it operates as a visitor attraction comprising a museum, information centre and shop. On display are rolling stock, historical artefacts and an audio-visual presentation on the railways’ history.\nRolling stock\nThe centre owns several items of rolling stock, some awaiting restoration.\n* Class 5 Locomotive, \"Drumboe\" built 1907, already (2021) restored\n* Restored Series 2 Carriage #28 from 1893.\n* Railcar #15, built 1936, undergoing restoration.\n* Trailer #5, built 1929, undergoing restoration.\nSee also\n* List of heritage railways in the Republic of Ireland\nReferences\nSources\n* [http://www.donegalrailway.com Website of the County Donegal Railway Restoration Society]\n* [http://www.Donegaltown.ie Donegal Town Website]\n* [http://www.irishtourist.com/details/the_donegal_railway_heritage_centre.shtml Heritage Centre web page]\n*Kits for many of the passenger coaches and locomotives are produced by Worsley Works - [http://worsleyworks.co.uk/ website]"
