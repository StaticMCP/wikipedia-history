The terrain is mountainous with elevations ranging from  above sea level. There are a number of named peaks (from north to south):\n* Mount Huntley ()\n* Sentinel Point ()\n* Mount Bauer ()\n* Mount Guymer ()\n* Mount Steamer ()  with its \"Steamers\"\n** Stern ()\n** Mast ()\n** Funnel ()\n** Prow ()\n* Mitchells Peak ()\n* Hoffmans Peak ()\nThe Steamers are distinctive rock formations, which are thought to be from a thick trachyte lava flow from the Main Range volcano which was active 24 million years ago.  They look like an old steamship with four high protruding peaks representing its Stern, Prow, Funnel and Mast.\nMost of the north-east of the locality is within the Main Range National Park. Apart from this protected area, the land use is mostly crop growing in the south-east (the lower flatter area around the town) and grazing on native vegetation elsewhere.\nHistory\nThe town takes its name from the Emu Vale railway station on the Killarney railway line, which is believed to be named after an early pastoral run.\nA sawmill was established  on  of land at Upper Emu Creek byJames McAra, George Hall, Thomas Hall and William Hall.
