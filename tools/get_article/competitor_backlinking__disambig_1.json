The outcome of this activity is designed to increase organic search engine rankings and to gain an understanding of the link building strategies used by business competitors.\nCompetitor backlinking can provide insights into the types of links that may contribute to higher search engine rankings. The number and quality of backlinks may be influential, and they are part of a broader array of factors that search engines use to rank websites, including content quality, user experience, technical SEO, and keyword relevance. These factors include content quality, keyword relevance, user engagement, and overall site architecture. Obtaining a similar number or quality of backlinks as a competitor does not guarantee similar search engine rankings.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9049606?hl=en Google Search Console]"
