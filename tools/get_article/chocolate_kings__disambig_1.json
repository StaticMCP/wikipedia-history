It was released in 1975 by Numero Uno, a division of RCA Records in Italy. It was also released with different cover art by Manticore Records in the UK and Asylum Records in the USA.\nIt was the first album to include Bernardo Lanzetti (formerly singer of Acqua Fragile) on lead vocals. This was also their first album where the lyrics were originally written in English, as the band felt they were better suited to the music they were making at this time. The lyrics for \"From Under\" and \"Chocolate Kings\" were written by Marva Jan Marrow, an American friend of the group, then living in Italy.\nTrack listing\n# \"From Under\" (Flavio Premoli, Franco Mussida, Mauro Pagani, Ivan Graziani, Marva Jan Marrow) – 7:29\n# \"Harlequin\" (Premoli, Pagani) – 7:48\n# \"Chocolate Kings\" (Mussida, Pagani, Marrow) – 4:39\n# \"Out of the Roundabout\" (Mussida, Pagani) – 7:53\n# \"Paper Charms\" (Mussida, Pagani) – 8:30\nPersonnel\n* Bernardo Lanzetti – vocals\n* Franco Mussida – guitar, voice\n* Flavio Premoli – keyboards, vocals\n* Mauro Pagani – flute, violin, vocals\n* Patrick Djivas – bass, vocals\n* Franz Di Cioccio – drums, vocals\nReferences"
