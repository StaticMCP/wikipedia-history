The broadcast features narration by King Charles alongside a selection of the King's favourite songs and pieces of music from across the Commonwealth, with some other music from other parts of the world. The broadcast was recorded at Buckingham Palace in London, United Kingdom.\nKing Charles said that he had wanted to share \"songs which have brought me joy\" and that music had the ability to \"bring happy memories flooding back from the deepest recesses of our memory, to comfort us in times of sadness, and to take us to distant places. But perhaps, above all, it can lift our spirits to such a degree, and all the more so when it brings us together in celebration\".\nMusic featured\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"4\" |Commonwealth Artists\n|-\n!Order\n!Song name\n!Artist\n!Country of Artist\n|-\n|1\n|Could You Be Loved\n|Bob Marley & The Wailers\n|\n|-\n|2\n|My Boy Lollipop\n|Millie Small\n|\n|-\n|3\n|The Loco-Motion\n|Kylie Minogue\n|\n|-\n|4\n|The Very Thought of You\n|Al Bowlly\n|\n|-\n|5\n|La Vie En Rose\n|Grace Jones\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Love Me Again\n|Raye\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Mpempem Do Me\n|Daddy Lumba\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Kante (feat Fave)\n|Davido\n|\n|-\n|9\n|The Click Song\n|Miriam Makeba\n|\n|-\n|10\n|My Country Man\n|Jools Holland\nRuby Turner\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Indian Summer\n|Anoushka Hemangini Shankar\n|\n|-\n|12\n|Anta Permana\n|Siti Nurhaliza\n|\n|-\n|13\n|E Te Iwi E (Call to the People)\n|Kiri Te Kanawa\n|\n|-\n|14\n|Haven’t Met You Yet\n|Michael Buble\n|\n|-\n|15\n|Hot Hot Hot\n|Arrow\n|\n()\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Non-Commonwealth Artists\n|-\n|16\n|Crazy in Love (feat Jay-Z)\n|Beyonce\n|\n|-\n|17\n|Upside Down\n|Diana Ross\n|\n|}\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
