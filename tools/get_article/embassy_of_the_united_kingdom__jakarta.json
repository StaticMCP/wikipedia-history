The British Ambassador to Indonesia also serves as the non-resident Ambassador to Timor-Leste and also as British representative to ASEAN.\nHistory\nThe original embassy was built in 1962, to the designs of Eric Bedford, Chief Architect at the Ministry of Public Building and Works. It was ransacked on 16 September 1963 when anti-British sentiment led to attacks on both the British and Malaysian Embassies.  During the attack, the assistant military attache Roderick Walker played bagpipes as a sign of defiance against the mob attack.\nThe old Embassy building on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta, had increasingly become the target of protesters. In 2004, the Islam Defenders Front (FPI) knocked down the building's gate and pelted it with rotten eggs. The British government installed roadblocks at its two main access points, a move that was met with contempt from local residents. As a result of security issues the UK decided to seek a more suitable building.\nThe Embassy moved to its current location on Jl. Patra Kuningan Raya, South Jakarta in 2013 and was officially opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. It sits in grounds behind a secure gatehouse.\nDominic Jermey became ambassador in 2023 and in 2025 the new deputy was identified as Fiona Ritchie.\nOther locations\nOutside Jakarta, there is also a British Honorary Consulate in Bali providing limited consular assistance.\nSee also\n*Indonesia–United Kingdom relations\n*List of diplomatic missions in Indonesia\n*List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Indonesia\nReferences"
