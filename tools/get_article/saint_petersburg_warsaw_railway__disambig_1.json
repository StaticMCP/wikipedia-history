It was built to Russian gauge. Construction was completed and operations began in 1862. At the time of opening the entire railway line was within the Russian Empire: Warsaw was under a Russian partition of Poland. Due to territorial changes, the line now lies within five countries and crosses the eastern border of the European Union three times. Therefore, no passenger trains follow the entire route. Passenger trains between Saint Petersburg and Warsaw used to travel through Brest instead and a new line called Rail Baltica is under development to improve the direct connection between Poland and Lithuania.\nHistory\nConstruction\nIn February 1851, the Russian Emperor Nicholas I signed a decree on conducting surveys for the construction of a railway line between Saint Petersburg, then capital of the Russian Empire, and Warsaw, the administrative centre of Russian Poland. In November 1851, the Emperor signed the order for the construction of the railway line, using state funds from the Imperial Russian Government. Construction began in 1852 under the supervision of the Russian engineer Eduard Gerstfeld with the Polish railway engineer Stanisław Kierbedź as deputy chief of construction.\nin Saint Petersburg on a pre-1917 photo.]]\nThe first section of the railway with a length of 41 versts () was completed between Saint Petersburg and the residential city of Gatchina in 1853, with daily scheduled train service starting on 31 October 1853. However, with the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1853, the work on other sections, where only earthworks had begun, was interrupted, as the war exhausted state funds..\nAfter the disastrous outcome of the Crimean War, which was considered as an effect of the backwardness of the Russian transport system, the Russian government abandoned its protectionist policy and decided to try to attract foreign capital. On 26 January 1857, the Main Society of Russian Railways (), of which the main capital was French, was founded. The construction work was transferred to the newly formed society. On 19 July 1858 the first train arrived in Pskov.\n,  1900.]]\nIn May 1858, construction started near Vilnius on the first section of 19 kilometers. On 1 May 1859 the ground works started along the entire route Daugavpils–Vilnius–Lentvaris–Kaunas–Kybartai. The end of summer of 1860 marked the end of the construction of the Ostrov-Daugavpils–Vilnius railway. The first train from Daugavpils arrived in Vilnius on  1860. In 1861, this branch was completed to the Prussian border, and between Verzhbolovo Station in Kybartai and Eydtkuhnen in Prussia (now Chernyshevskoye in Russian Kaliningrad Oblast) the first junction between Russian gauge and standard gauge railway systems was built, with rails in both gauges between the border stations.\nin Warsaw in 1908.]]\nThe construction of the section from Lentvaris to Warsaw was completed on 15 December 1862.\nThe first locomotives for the St. Petersburg–Warsaw railway were bought in England, France, and Belgium. They were “G” class 0-6-0s with two cylinders. They were produced in Manchester in 1857, in Paris in 1860, and in Belgium in 1862. Their weight was 30–32 tons.\nLater development\nOn 1 January 1907, the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw railway, along with the Baltic and Pskov–Riga railways, became part of the North-Western Railways.\nThe portion between Vilnius and Warsaw was rebuilt in the standard gauge in the 1920s when that area belonged to Poland.\nThe railway was partly destroyed during both world wars.\nPresent\nand Porechye in Lithuania.]]\nA 224km section of the line between Zielonka, some 13km north-east of Warsaw and Kuźnica Białostocka on the Polish-Belarusian border, some 54km north-east Białystok is today designated by the Polish National Railways PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe as PKP rail line 6. It is one of the country's major trunk lines. Since 2014 the line is being modernized to ultimately allow passenger trains to run at  and freight trains at , works include renewal of tracks and overhead lines, replacing level crossings with tunnels or overpasses and installation of ETCS level 2. The line is electrified along its entire length, and has two tracks up to Białystok.\nIn Zielonka a 9km long line built in 1933, today designated PKP rail line 449 branches of from the former Warsaw-Sankt Petersburg railway south to the former Warsaw–Terespol railway and through it to the Warsaw Cross-City Line and the other trunk lines of the Warsaw Railway Junction. The original route continues south-west as PKP rail line 21 terminating at the Warszawa Wileńska station in Warsaw Praga district, without reaching the city center. This segment is used only for local passenger traffic in the Warsaw metropolitan area, however due to large passenger volumes it is designated as a primary line. Line 21 also extends north-east from Zielonka to Wołomin along line 6, giving a total of four tracks on this segment.\nFrom Białystok to Kuźnica Białostocka line 6 has only one track, which shortly before the Polish-Belarusian border is joined by a broad gauge track designated PKP rail line 57, with several transshipment facilities along its route. Both lines extend across the border and continue from Bruzhi into Hrodna, with the standard gauge line electrified at 3 kV DC which is commonly used by the Polish railways, rather than 25 kV AC used on the two Belarusian trunk lines. This allows Polish trains to reach Hrodna without the need for time consuming break of gauge operations and replacing traction power, and before 2020 Polish companies offered regular connections there.\nFrom Hrodna however only the broad gauge track continues to Uzbieraž on the Belarusian–Lithuanian border. The track from the border to Marcinkonys in Lithuania has been dismantled at some point at the beginning of the 21st century, from Marcinkonys to Vilnius and further north-east the line remains in use for local regional traffic, although there have been some sporadic connections between Vilnius and Daugavpils.\nTrains traveling between Warsaw and Vilnius today have to take a long detour through Ełk and Kaunas. It appears extremely unlikely a direct connection through Hrodna might be restored in the foreseeable future. Instead a project called Rail Baltica is underway to upgrade existing infrastructure and build new standard gauge lines in order to improve the rail connection from Poland to Lithuania, Latvia, further to Estonia and eventually to Finland, running entirely within EU territory.\nSee also\n* History of rail transport in Belarus\n* History of rail transport in Latvia\n* History of rail transport in Lithuania\n* History of rail transport in Poland\n* History of rail transport in Russia\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links"
