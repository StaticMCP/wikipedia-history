The officially unnamed peak is also known as Valpe Ridge–Rose Flat due to its location near Rose Flat.\nThe area is high enough to receive occasional snowfall during the winter, which generally melts within a few days of falling.\nAlthough it is on private property, the Ohlone Wilderness Trail, in Sunol Regional Wilderness, comes to within about  of the summit.\nHistory\nDiscovery Peak was named in 1991 after it was \"discovered\" by highpointer Dinesh Desai while studying a topo map. Field work by Gordon MacLeod and others supports Desai's conclusion,\nbut this is in conflict with numerous official county documents that list nearby Rose Peak as the highest point.\nReferences\nSee also\n* List of highest points in California by county"
