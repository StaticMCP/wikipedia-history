Beads can be simple round shapes, or more complex patterns.\nA bead may be created with an electric router, a special moulding handplane or a scratch stock. Beads are usually cut directly into the edge of the item to which the bead is being applied. However, beads applied across the grain are usually cut into a separate piece, which is then fixed in position.\nA bead is also an important design element in wood turning, a ring-shape or convex curve incised into a piece by the use of a chisel or skew.\nTypes of beads\n* Angle bead, a projecting wood moulding at the corner of a plastered wall\n* Corner bead is similar, but is usually fully embedded in plaster or drywall, and usually plastic or metal\n* Nosing bead, the rounded projection of a stair tread over the riser below\n* Parting bead, or parting strip, the feature that separates two sashes in a sash window\nReferences"
