The contests use social media to foster that dialogue among people around the world.\nThe 2009 Video Challenge was first announced on September 15, 2008, International Day of Democracy. Richard Engel, NBC News chief foreign correspondent served as master of ceremonies for both the 2009  and 2010  contest launches. Since its launch, more than 1,600 people from 111 countries have entered the contest,  while nearly 3.5 million people have been engaged online.\nProcess\nEach year the Challenge honors one winner from each of six regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Europe, the Near East and North Africa, South and Central Asia, and the Western Hemisphere.\nA jury selects 18 finalists – three videos from each of the six geographic regions.  The winners are then selected during a global online vote on YouTube. The six winning filmmakers receive an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C., Hollywood and New York City to meet with professionals from entertainment, government, media and civil society.\nJury\nYears jurors participated are in parentheses.
