The Warhawks have primarily competed in the Gulf South Conference since the 2017–18 academic year.\nAuburn Montgomery competes in eleven intercollegiate varsity sports. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, and tennis; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball.\nMove to NCAA Division II\nAuburn University at Montgomery (AUM) participated in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) for approximately 30 years. However, during those 30 years, AUM had routinely explored possible future participation in NCAA Division II. AUM was accepted into the membership process into the NCAA Division II on July 12, 2013, but the decision was reversed on July 26, 2013. AUM was expected to join the Peach Belt Conference in the 2014–15 season, but this was apparently set aside when the NCAA refused to admit the school. However, the school reapplied and was approved to begin the three-year Division II membership process on July 17, 2015 and began the transition with the 2015–16 season, while joining the Gulf South Conference for all sports effective in the 2017–18 season.\nConference affiliations\nNAIA\n* Independent (1975–1999)\n* Southern States Athletic Conference (1999–2016)\nNCAA\n* Independent (2016–2017)\n* Gulf South Conference (2017–present)\nVarsity teams\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|-\n| Baseball || Basketball\n|-\n| Basketball || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country || Soccer\n|-\n| Soccer || Softball\n|-\n| Tennis || Tennis\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n|}\nNickname\nThe teams formerly competed under the name 'Senators' until August 18, 2011, when the college changed its nickname to 'Warhawks.'\nAccomplishments\nWhile participating in the NAIA, AUM teams won 25 national championship, 14 by the women's tennis team (1992, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015), 9 by the men's tennis team (1987, 1995, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010) and most-recently consecutive championships by the softball team (2014, 2015).
