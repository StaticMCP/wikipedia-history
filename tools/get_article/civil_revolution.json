Among the signatories of this appeal were Franco Battiato, Fiorella Mannoia, Luigi de Magistris, Leoluca Orlando, Milly Moratti, Massimiliano Bruno, Max Paiella, Sabina Guzzanti, Vauro and Enrico Fierro. The coalition had an anti-corruption platform.\nIn the 2013 general election the party obtained 2.2% of the vote, returning no seats in the Italian Parliament.\nSoon after RC was dissolved on 2 April 2013, Ingroia launched a new party named Civil Action ().\nOverview\nCivil Revolution was founded on 29 December 2012 in Rome by Ingroia and the following parties:\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:left\n|-\n!colspan=2|Party\n!Ideology\n!Leader\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Italy of Values (IdV)\n| Anti-corruption\n| Antonio Di Pietro\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Communist Refoundation Party (PRC)\n| Communism\n| Paolo Ferrero\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Party of Italian Communists (PdCI)\n| Communism\n| Oliviero Diliberto\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Federation of the Greens (FdV)\n| Green politics\n| Angelo Bonelli\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0002b;\"|\n| The Network 2018 (LR2018)\n| Anti-corruption\n| Leoluca Orlando\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n| Orange Movement (MA)\n| Anti-corruption\n| Luigi de Magistris\n|}\nSubsequently, the following parties and organizations joined RC:\n*Red Diaries (Agende Rosse - Anti-mafia politics), led by Salvatore Borsellino;\n*We Can Change (Cambiare Si Può, CSP - Left-wing appeal), led by Livio Pepino, Marco Revelli and Chiara Sasso;\n*Ecologists and Civic Networks (Ecologisti e Reti Civiche - Green coalition), led by Bonelli and Mary Luppino, including:\n**Federation of the Greens (Federazione dei Verdi);\n**We Have a Dream (Abbiamo un Sogno);\n**Ecologist Constituent Assembly (Costituente Ecologista);\n**Mayors of Good Administration (Sindaci della Buona Amministrazione);\n*New Action Party (''Nuovo Partito d'Azione, NPA - Social liberalism), led by Giuseppe Antonio Quartana;\n*Purple People (Popolo Viola - Activism), led by Massimo Malerba.\n*Party of the South (Partito del Sud'' - Southernism), led by Beppe De Santis.\nElectoral results\nItalian Parliament\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| colspan=6|Chamber of Deputies\n|-\n!
