The motorcyclist eventually gave way. While the motorcyclist was being searched and interrogated by soldiers an unidentified vehicle filled with gunmen surged forward spraying the troops with gunfire. This served as a temporary distraction allowing the motorcyclist to detonate the explosive belts he was wearing mortally instantly killing two soldiers and severely wounding four others. By 1:40 p.m, the MOJWA gunmen in the unmarked car were all reported killed supposedly before they had enough time to remotely detonate a car bomb.\nReferences"
