Many Muslim community groups have switched their affiliation from the Islamic Council of Queensland to QMI due to perceived lack of inclusive representation and greater connection with the wider community.\nQMI is the first Muslim organisation in Queensland that brings together community groups from across sectarian divides of ethnicity and Muslim belief, and is affiliated with the Alliance of Australian Muslims.\nActivities\nCommunity\nCreswalk\nThe QMI is the key organiser and sponsor of the annual Creswalk in Brisbane. This is a community fun run specifically for the Muslim community that helps build community connections and health. In 2024, 467 participants took part walking, running and jogging.\nAdvocacy\nQMI regularly participates in government forums and is the key representative voice on behalf of Muslims in QLD. They have created events bringing panels of experts together to discuss the Gaza genocide, Islamophobia and discrimination against Muslims and spirituality. QMI is a member of the QLD Faith Communities Council.\nIn 2022, QMI hosted a citizenship ceremony at the Islamic College of Brisbane which accepted 100 people as Australian citizens and was presided over by the Federal Treasurer, Dr Jim Chalmers.\nIn 2023, the governor of Queensland participated in QMI's annual iftar dinner and acknowledged the important contributions of the Muslim community to Queensland.\nIn 2024, the QMI spoke out in support of the Truth-Telling and Healing Inquiry, which sought to examine the historical misjustice wrought against the Indigenous community.\nEvent coordination\nQMI volunteers regularly assist in protests against the Gaza genocide, mass Eid prayers at the Islamic College of Brisbane and fundraising events on the south-side of Brisbane.\nOrganisation Structure\nQMI is the representative body that represents the interests of it's member groups, who are Muslim community organisations.
