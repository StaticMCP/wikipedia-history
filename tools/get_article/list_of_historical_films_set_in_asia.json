      "text": "# List of historical films set in Asia\n\nHistorical or period drama is a film genre in which stories are based on historical events and famous persons. Some historical dramas attempt to accurately portray a historical event or biography, to the degree that the available historical research will allow. Other historical dramas are fictionalised tales that are based on an actual person and their deeds.\nDue to the sheer volume of films included in this genre and in the interest of continuity, this list is primarily focused on films pertaining to the history of East Asia, Central Asia, and India. For films pertaining to the history of Near Eastern and Western civilisation, please refer to list of historical period drama films and series set in Near Eastern and Western civilization.\nThe films on this page are divided into regions, and within each region the films are listed chronologically.\nCentral Asia\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Sortable table\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Release date\n!Time period\n! scope=\"col\" | Setting\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| The Beast || 1988\n|1981|| Afghanistan || during the Soviet–Afghan War\n|-\n|The Orphanage\n|2019\n|1989–1990\n|Afghanistan\n|The story of children living in an orphanage in Kabul in Soviet Afghanistan and during the outbreak of the Afghan Civil War\n|-\n| Kandahar || 2001\n|1996–2001|| Afghanistan || Afghanistan during the Taliban regime\n|-\n|Tomiris\n|2019\n|6th century\n|Kazakhstan\n|Kazakhstani historical drama about Tomyris, the 6th century queen of the Massagetae\n|-\n|Myn Bala\n|2011\n|18th century\n|Kazakhstan\n|Kazakhstani historical dramatic film depicting the eighteenth century war fought between the Kazakhs and the Dzungar Khanate\n|-\n| Nomad || 2006\n|18th century|| Kazakhstan || about the early years of Ablai Khan (early 18th century), a Kazakh khan in part of what is now Kazakhstan.\n|-\n|Genghis Khan||1950\n|1158–1227||Mongolia||Life of the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan focusing on the succession of his throne.\n|-\n| Genghis Khan|| 1965\n|1158–1227|| Mongolia || The life and conquests of the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan\n|-\n| Genghis Khan: To the Ends of the Earth and Sea|| 2007\n|1158–1227|| Mongolia || Japanese-Mongolian film about the life of Genghis Khan\n|-\n| Mongol|| 2007\n|1172–1192|| Mongolia || Mongolian language film depicting the early life of Genghis Khan, focusing on the years 1172–1192\n|-\n| The Conqueror|| 1956\n|1178–1203|| Mongolia || English-language film starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan\n|-\n| Queen Mandukhai the Wise || 1988\n|1449–1510|| Mongolia || Mongolian language film about the life of Queen Mandukhai (1449–1510) who reunited the Mongols.\n|-\n| Tsogt Taij || 1945\n|1581–1637|| Mongolia || Mongolian language film about the patriotic struggle of Prince Tsogt Taij (1581–1637).\n|-\n| Kundun || 1997\n|1950|| Tibet || an American film depicting the early life of the 14th Dalai Lama and the 1950 invasion of Tibet and subsequent events\n|-\n| The Golden Horde|| 1951\n|1220|| Uzbekistan || English-language film about an English knight who leads the defense of Samarkand against Genghis Khan\n|}\nSouth Asia\nIndian History\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Sortable table\n|-\n!

Literally \"period dramas\", they are most often set during the Edo period of Japanese history, from 1603 to 1868.  Some, however, are set much earlier—Portrait of Hell, for example, is set during the late Heian period—and the early Meiji era is also a popular setting. Jidaigeki show the lives of the samurai, farmers, craftsmen, and merchants of their time. Jidaigeki films are sometimes referred to as chambara movies, a word meaning \"sword fight\", though chambara is more accurately a subgenre of jidaigeki, which equates to historical period drama. In Japan, the term , also commonly spelled \"chambara\", meaning \"sword fighting\" movies, denotes the genre called samurai cinema in English, and is roughly equivalent to western cowboy and swashbuckler films. Jidaigeki may refer to a story set in a historical period, though not necessarily dealing with a samurai character or depicting swordplay. Jidaigeki rely on an established set of dramatic conventions including the use of makeup, language, catchphrases, and plotlines.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notable cast\n! scope=\"col\" | Release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Time period\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n|Kōchiyama to Nao-zamurai\n|\n|Ichitarō Kataoka, Matsunosuke Onoe, Kijaku Ōtani\n|1916\n|\n|Based on the play of the same name.\n|-\n|Nao-zamurai\n|Jiro Yoshino\n|Shirogoro Sawamura\n|1922\n|\n|Based on the play of the same name.\n|-\n|''A Diary of Chuji's Travels\n|Daisuke Itō\n|Denjirō Ōkōchi\n|1927\n|\n|Awards: 1 Kinema Junpo Award\n|-\n| Sword of Penitence\n|Yasujirō Ozu\n|Saburo Azuma, Kunimatsu Ogawa, Kanji Kawahara, Shoichi Nodera\n|1927\n|\n|\n|-\n|Jobless Samurai\n|Masahiro Makino\n|Kōmei Minami, Tōichirō Negishi, Tsuyako Okajima\n|1928\n|\n|Awards: 1 Kinema Junpo Award\n|-\n|Nao-zamurai\n|Kintarō Inoue\n|Chōjirō Hayashi, Ryūnosuke Tsukigata, Kōkichi Takada, Kinuko Wakamizu\n|1930\n|\n|Based on the play of the same name.\n|-\n|Jirokichi the Rat\n|Daisuke Itō\n|Denjirō Ōkōchi, Naoe Fushimi, Nobuko Fushimi\n|1931\n|\n|\n|-\n|Chūshingura Zenpen: Akōkyō no maki\n|Teinosuke Kinugasa\n|Tomio Aoki, Juzaburo Bando, Kōtarō Bandō\n|1932\n|\n|\n|-\n|Chūshingura – Ninjō-hen, Fukushū-hen\n|Daisuke Itō\n|Shinpachirō Asaka, Satoko Date, Sannosuke Fujikawa\n|1934\n|\n|\n|-\n|The Million Ryo Pot\n|Sadao Yamanaka\n|Denjirō Ōkōchi, Kiyozo, Kunitarō Sawamura\n|1935\n|\n|\n|-\n|The Avenging Ghost of Yukinojo, Part 1\n|Teinosuke Kinugasa\n|Kazuo Hasegawa, Tokusaburo Arashi, Akiko Chihaya\n|1935\n|\n|\n|-\n|The Avenging Ghost of Yukinojo, Part 2\n|Teinosuke Kinugasa\n|Kazuo Hasegawa, Tokusaburo Arashi, Akiko Chihaya\n|1935\n|\n|\n|-\n|Daibosatsu tōge: dai-ippen – Kōgen itto-ryū no maki\n|Hiroshi Inagaki\n|Fujiko Fukamizu, Ranko Hanai, Takako Irie\n|1935\n|\n|\n|-\n|The Avenging Ghost of Yukinojo, Part 3\n|Teinosuke Kinugasa\n|Kazuo Hasegawa, Tokusaburo Arashi, Akiko Chihaya\n|1936\n|\n|\n|-\n|Daibosatsu tōge: Suzuka-yama no maki – Mibu Shimabara no maki\n|Hiroshi Inagaki\n|Fujiko Fukamizu, Kobunji Ichikawa, Momonosuke Ichikawa\n|1936\n|\n|\n|-\n|Humanity and Paper Balloons\n|Sadao Yamanaka\n|Chojuro Kawarazaki, Kanemon Nakamura, Shizue Yamagishi\n|1937\n|18th century\n|\n|-\n|Chikemuri Takadanobaba\n|Hiroshi Inagaki, Masahiro Makino\n|Tsumasaburō Bandō, Tokuma Dan, Komako Hara\n|1937\n|\n|\n|-\n|Chushingura, Part One\n|Kajirō Yamamoto\n|Denjirō Ōkōchi, Kazuo Hasegawa, Yatarō Kurokawa\n|1939\n|1701\n|\n|-\n|Chushingura, Part Two\n|Kajirō Yamamoto\n|Denjirō Ōkōchi, Kazuo Hasegawa, Yatarō Kurokawa\n|1939\n|1701\n|\n|-\n|Singing Lovebirds\n|Masahiro Makino\n|Chiezō Kataoka, Takashi Shimura\n|1939\n|\n|\n|-\n|A Color Print of Edo\n|Kazuo Mori\n|Shinpachirō Asaka, Utaemon Ichikawa, Yaeko Kumoi\n|1939\n|\n|\n|-\n|The 47 Ronin\n|Kenji Mizoguchi\n|Chojuro Kawarasaki, Kanemon Nakamura, Kunitaro Kawarazaki, Yoshizaburo Arashi, Daisuke Katō\n|1941\n|1701–1703\n|Two-part film depicting the famous actions of the Forty-seven rōnin in 1701–1703.
