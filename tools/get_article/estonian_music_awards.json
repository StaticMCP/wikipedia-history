The concert is organized and the awards are presented by the Estonian Association of the Phonogram Producers (EFÜ). The awards ceremony is broadcast on television.\nThe awards began in 1998, when the EFÜ first awarded the Golden Record () to the most successful artists. In 1998–1999, the Golden Records Music Awards was presented in cooperation with the Estonian Authors' Association and the Estonian Performers' Association.\nIn 2000, the logo and name of the award were changed. Artists were selected based on the voting results of juries – which included music editors, presenters, music teachers, musicians, DJs, concert organizers, producers, etc. In six categories, juries of 100 members were formed, and in three categories, juries of up to 15 members were formed. In addition, nominees and laureates were selected based on rankings.\nCategories\nBelow are the current categories as of 2025.\n# Album of the Year\n# Debut Album of the Year\n# Female Artist of the Year\n# Male Artist of the Year\n# Ensemble of the Year\n# Jazz Album of the Year\n# Ethno/Folk/Folk Album of the Year\n# Original Song Album of the Year\n# Hip-Hop/Rap Artist of the year\n# Soul/Funk/R'n'B Artist of the Year\n# Metal Album of the Year\n# Rock Album of the Year\n# Classical Album of the Year – the nominees for the category \"Classical Album of the Year\" are the albums that received the most votes in each classical genre category.\n#* Solo or Chamber Music Album of the Year\n#* Orchestra or Stage Music Album of the Year\n#* Choral Music Album of the Year\n#* Estonian Composition Album of the Year\n# Song of the Year\n# Music Video of the Year\n# Contribution to Estonian Music\nHistory\n1998\nEstonian phonogram producers first felt the need to recognize the best of Estonian pop music by creating the Estonian Pop Music Annual Awards Golden Disc in 1998, when the most successful artists were awarded the Estonian Pop Music Annual Awards Golden Record 1998. The awards ceremony took place and was recorded at the Estonian Television (ETV) studio on December 29, 1998, and aired as a 40-minute television program two days later, on the last day of the year.\nThe 1998 awards were presented in 9 categories: Most Successful Female Singer, Most Successful Male Singer, Most Successful Ensemble, Most Successful Debut, The Most Successful Record Company, Most played radio hit, The most played hit in dance halls, Album of the Year, and Music Video of the Year.

The difference compared to the two previous years is that the EFÜ started to determine the nominees and winners based on the jury voting results from 2000.\nImpartial juries of 100 members were formed in six categories. Nominees and laureates were determined based on rankings. The juries consisted of individuals active in various fields of music in Estonia (for example, music editors, presenters, teachers, musicians, DJs, concert organizers, producers, etc.). For the first time, a comprehensive set of rules for music awards was also developed, which included the conditions for nomination, criteria for determining nominees and winners, and the composition and work of the juries. When determining nominees and winners, the jury members had to take into account, among other things, the following criteria - sales success, the idea and execution of the performance or music video or album design, playability on radio and television, the success of concerts, and the impact on Estonian music in general and more broadly.\nAt the award ceremony held on March 3, 2001 at the Decolte nightclub. New awards were added that included multiple genres of music, rather than just pop music, including ethno/folk, jazz/blues and classical music categories. One of the special awards recognized the fight against piracy – the Music Supporter of the Year award was given to Äripäev journalist Peep Sooman for his articles on piracy.\nCooperation with ETV and Raadio 2 continued, both of which broadcast the event live, providing extensive advance advertising for the event in the form of commercials, interviews, etc. The 2000 awards were presented in 14 categories: Male Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, Newcomer of the Year, Ensemble of the Year, Jazz/Blues Artist of the Year, Ethno/Folk Artist of the Year, Classical Artist of the Year, Music Video of the Year, Album Design of the Year, Radio Hit of the Year, Dance Hit of the Year, Record Label of the Year, Music Supporter of the Year, Contribution to Estonian Music.\n2001\nThe Estonian Music Awards 2001 took place on March 3rd at Saku Suurhall.
