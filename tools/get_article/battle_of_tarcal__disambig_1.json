Ferdinand defeated Zápolya.\nBackground\nIn 1526, King Louis II of Hungary was killed at the Battle of Mohács. The Hungarian Diet elected Zápolya as their new king. Archduke (and future Holy Roman Emperor) Ferdinand also claimed the crown, and was elected by a rump Diet. This conflict resulted in war between the rivals. In 1527, Ferdinand invaded Hungary  and captured Buda while Zápolya was distracted by a peasant uprising. Zápolya quickly turned to meet Ferdinand, but could only bring limited forces to the field.\nThe battle\nZápolya's army numbered around 7,000–8,000 men, drawn mainly from eastern Hungary, Transylvania, and Serbia. Ferdinand's army numbered 18,000 men, mostly German mercenaries, but also some of his western Hungarian supporters. 6,000 were under the command of Niklas Graf Salm and Bálint Török. On 26 September Zápolya encamped near Tokaj. Ferdinand's forces engaged with, and defeated a small Zápolya contingent in a skirmish near Sajólád.\nOn 27 September, Zápolya attacked Ferdinand's main force, bringing on a full-scale battle.  Ferdinand's left-flank troops (from Styria) overwhelmed the Serbian troops of Zápolya's right wing, while German and Austrian mercenaries swept through Zápolya's cavalry. Ferdinand's Hungarian hussars then broke through Zápolya's center, seized his camp, and drove his remaining soldiers to the river Tisza.\nAftermath\nAccording to a report, estimated by  to be from November 1527, from voivode of Moldavia Petru Rareș to the Ottoman court, Zápolya retreated to Kolosvar, from which he was driven to Tasnád by Transvlvanian forces and Székelys. Aided by Sigismund I the Old, he raised a new army then marching toward Buda to again engage Ferdinand. At the Battle of Szina Ferdinand once again defeated Zápolya,  Zápolya allied with the Ottoman sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent; after two failed assaults on Vienna in 1529 and 1533, Ferdinand signed a peace treaty delineating his western domain and Zápolya's eastern one.\nReferences\nSources\n* Szilágyi, Sándor.
