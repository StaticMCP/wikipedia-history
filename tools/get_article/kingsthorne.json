The primary school catering for approximately 200 pupils is between Kingsthorne and Much Birch. The village is part of the Wormelow Hundred benefice, with its church in Little Birch. The Castle Inn is in the heart of the village.\nNotable people\n* Ruth Sherlock, journalist\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.muchbirchparish.org.uk Much Birch parish website]"
