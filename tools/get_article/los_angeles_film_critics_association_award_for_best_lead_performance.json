It was first introduced in 2022, after it was announced that the four acting categories would be retired and replaced with two gender neutral categories, with both Best Actor and Best Actress merging into the Best Lead Performance category. Two awards for Best Lead Performance and two awards for Best Supporting Performance, each with two winners and two runners-up, are handed out.\nWinners and runners-up\n* † = Winner of the Academy Award for Best Actor or Best Actress\n* ‡ = Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor or Best Actress\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"68%\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n! width=\"100\"| Year\n! width=\"300\"| Winner(s)\n! width=\"300\"| Film(s)\n! width=\"300\"| Role(s)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2022 || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Cate Blanchett || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Tár || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Lydia Tár ‡\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Bill Nighy || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Living || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Mr. Williams ‡\n|-\n| Danielle Deadwyler || Till || Mamie Till-Mobley\n|-\n| Michelle Yeoh || Everything Everywhere All at Once || Evelyn Wang †\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2023 || rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Sandra Hüller || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Anatomy of a Fall || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Sandra Voyter ‡\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| The Zone of Interest || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Hedwig Höss\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Emma Stone || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Poor Things || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Bella Baxter †\n|-\n| Andrew Scott || All of Us Strangers || Adam\n|-\n| Jeffrey Wright || American Fiction || Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison ‡\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2024 || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"|  Marianne Jean-Baptiste || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Hard Truths || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Pansey Deacon\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Mikey Madison || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Anora || style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"| Anora \"Ani\" Mikheeva †\n|-\n| Demi Moore || The Substance || Elisabeth Sparkle ‡\n|-\n| Fernanda Torres || ''I'm Still Here'' || Eunice Paiva ‡\n|}\nSee also\n* Gotham Independent Film Award for Outstanding Lead Performance\n* Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Performance\n* National Board of Review Award for Best Actor\n* National Board of Review Award for Best Actress\n* National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor\n* National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress\n* New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor\n* New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
