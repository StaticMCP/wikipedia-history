The ceremony was produced by Gary Miller and directed by Mark Stone. Comedian Bobby Slayton returned as host, with actresses Nici Sterling and Kylie Ireland as co-hosts. At a pre-awards event held the previous evening, 60 more AVN Awards, mostly for technical achievements, were given out by hostess Dyanna Lauren and comedy ventriloquist Otto of Otto & George, however, the pre-awards event was neither televised nor distributed on VHS tapes as was the main evening's ceremony.\nShock won the most awards with 11, however, Bobby Sox, an \"off-beat period piece comedy\" that received six statuettes, won for best film. Flesh and Blood was next with five awards including best gay feature.\nWinners and nominees\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on January 11, 1997. Missy was the first actress to win both Starlet of the Year and the AVN Female Performer of the Year Award in the same year.

This year the show was centered around an international theme, “the world of adult,” with added emphasis on European presenters and awards. This was the first year the awards ceremony was split over two nights, with a pre-awards event held January 10, 1997, where awards for technical achievements were distributed, while the main awards were presented January 11, 1997.\nSeveral other people were also involved with the production of the ceremony. Serenity was responsible for choreography and Mark Stone was musical director with original songs by Mark J. Miller.\nThe top selling and renting tape of the year was Shock, although it was tied in the best-selling category with ''World's Biggest Gang Bang 2. There were several new awards categories this year including Best Advertisement and the AVN Breakthrough Award to acknowledge \"those who were carving new niches and forging new territories in the adult business.\"\nThe ceremonies were published on VHS tape by VCA Pictures.\nCritical response\nThe show received a negative reception from Hustler magazine, which said, “Long-winded speeches from several award winners threatened to bore everyone to death.” It went on to add that since AVN is a trade publication paid for by ads \"from the same adult video companies it bestows awards upon, the critical value of such honors is subject to debate.\" Swank Video World'' magazine was a bit more positive, calling the show \"the most glamorous night in the adult industry.\"\nSee also\n* AVN Award for Best Actress\n* AVN Award for Best Supporting Actress\n* AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year\n* AVN Award for Male Foreign Performer of the Year\n* AVN Award for Female Foreign Performer of the Year\n* AVN Female Performer of the Year Award\n* List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Adult_Video_News_Awards/ Adult Video News Awards]  at the Internet Movie Database\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/19970606095942/http://www.avn.com/avn_main/1997awards.html \"1997 AVN Award Winners\" and categories] at the Internet Archive Wayback Machine"
