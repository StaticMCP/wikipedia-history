He was the fifth son of Emperor Duzong and an elder brother of his predecessor, Emperor Gong and successor Zhao Bing.\nEmperor Gong along with Grand Dowager Xie surrendered to the Yuan dynasty in 1276 after the fall of the Southern Song capital, Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou). Zhao Shi and his seventh brother, Zhao Bing, managed to escape southward to Fujian, where the new Song capital was established. On June 14, 1276, Zhao Shi was enthroned as the new Emperor Duanzong who ruled under the era name \"Jingyan\" (; literally: \"bright flame\"). However, in early 1278, Yuan forces broke through the Song dynasty's last lines of defence, forcing Zhao Shi to flee again. Accompanied by loyal ministers such as Lu Xiufu and Zhang Shijie, Zhao Shi boarded a ship and fled further south to Guangdong Province. In March 1278, while fleeing from Yuan forces led by Liu Shen, in a hurricane, Zhao Shi fell from a boat and almost drowned. Thereafter, he stayed temporarily in Hong Kong which at that time was a small fishing village. He died a few months later in Gangzhou (; present-day Jiangmen) due to illness. He was succeeded by his seventh brother, Zhao Bing, who was enthroned in Mui Wo, the same village where Zhao Shi nearly drowned and died.\nThe body of Zhao Shi is buried in Yongfu Mausoleum (). The actual area of the tomb is still unknown and undiscovered.\nThe historical relic Sung Wong Toi in present-day Hong Kong's Kowloon City commemorates Zhao Shi's escape to Hong Kong.\nSee also\n*Chinese emperors family tree (middle)\n*List of emperors of the Song dynasty\nReferences\n*"
