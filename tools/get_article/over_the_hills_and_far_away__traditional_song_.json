Two versions were published in the fifth volume of Thomas D'Urfey's Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy; a version that is similar to the second Wit and Mirth one appears in George Farquhar's 1706 play The Recruiting Officer. A further version appears in John Gay's ''The Beggar's Opera of 1728. The melody is modal, in what is known as C-Dorian (the Dorian mode transposed to C).\nThe words have changed over the years, as can be seen in the versions below. The only consistent element in early versions is the title line and the tune. The first Wit and Mirth'' version and Gay's version both refer to lovers, while the second Wit and Mirth version along with Farquhar's version refer to military service. The tune was provided with another set of lyrics for the British Sharpe television series of the 1990s, based on Farquhar's version. This version was also recorded by John Tams who played Dan Hagman in the series.\nThe nursery rhyme \"Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son\" mentions a piper who knows only one tune, this one.  Early versions of this, known as \"The distracted Jockey's Lamentations\", may have been written (but not included) in Thomas D'Urfey's play The Campaigners (1698):\n:Tommy was a Piper's Son,\n:And fell in love when he was young;\n:But all the Tunes that he could play,\n:Was, o'er the Hills, and far away.\nAnother nursery rhyme, \"Five Little Ducks\", uses the title of the song as a line.\nAn instrumental version was heard in the Barney & Friends episode \"Classical Cleanup\".\nWit and Mirth lyrics\nJockey's Lamentation\n:Jockey met with Jenny fair\n:Betwixt the dawning and the Day,\n:And Jockey now is full of Care,\n:For Jenny stole his Heart away:\n:Altho' she promis'd to be true,\n:Yet she, alas, has prov'd unkind,\n:That which do make poor Jockey rue,\n:For Jenny's fickle as the Wind:\n:And, 'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away,\n:'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away,\n:'Tis o'er the Hills, and far away,\n:The Wind has blown my Plad away.\n:Jockey was a bonny Lad,\n:As e'er was born in Scotland fair;\n:But now poor Jockey is run mad,\n:For Jenny causes his Despair;\n:Jockey was a Piper's Son,\n:And fell in Love while he was young:\n:But all the Tunes that he could play,\n:Was, o'er the Hills, and far away,\n:And, [As for verse one]\n:When first I saw my Jenny's Face,\n:She did appear with sike a Grace,\n:With muckle Joy my Heart was fill'd;\n:But now alas with Sorrow kill'd.\n:Oh!
