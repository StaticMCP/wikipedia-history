Emir Ahmed Ali campaigned against the Italian forces in eastern Sudan and led about 10,000–12,000 men east from Kassala. This force encountered 2,400 Italians and their Eritrean askaris at Agordat, west of Asmara, commanded by Colonel Arimondi. Over 1,000 Dervishes, including the Emir, were killed in severe fighting. The outcome of the battle constituted \"...the first decisive victory yet won by Europeans against the Sudanese revolutionaries,...\"\nA year later, Italian colonial forces seized Kassala.\nSources\nfr:Combat d'Agordat"
