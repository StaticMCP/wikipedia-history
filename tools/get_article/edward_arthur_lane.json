Lane was an English classical archaeologist and ceramics specialist.\nAfter attending St. John's School in Leatherhead, Arthur Lane studied classics at St John's College (Cambridge). In 1932 he attended the British School at Athens on a scholarship and, based on the work of its then director Humfry Payne, he wrote a fundamental work on Laconian vase painting. Since 1934 he worked in the Department of Ceramics at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and was head of this department from 1950 to 1963. In 1937 he took part in Leonard Woolley's excavation at Al Mina, where his interest in Islamic ceramics was awakened. He wrote his most important works in this area, but also wrote about numerous other areas of ceramics.\nPublications (selection)\n* Laconian Vase Painting.
