It moved into the Saalhof in 1955, and a new extension was opened in 1972.\nDue to reconstruction and renovation work on the old buildings (before 1971), the museum was closed until the beginning of 2012. The renovated old building was opened on 26 May 2012 and the new building on 7 October 2017.\nCollection\nThe museum's collection is displayed in several permanent chronological exhibitions: Mediaeval Frankfurt, the Late Middle Ages, the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, the nineteenth-century city, and its history as a metropolis from 1866 to 2001. Special exhibitions are also on display.\nArtworks\nFile:HMF Altar Hl Anna DSC 1505 6321.jpg|St. Anne altarpiece from the Carmelite church in Frankfurt, c.1500 by the Master of Frankfurt\nFile:HMF Duerer Gruenewald Harrich Heller-Altar DSC 6312.jpg|The Heller Altarpice (1508) from the Dominican cloister in Frankfurt by Albrecht Dürer\nFile:Frankfurt Am Main-Alfred Rethel-Die Versoehnung Ottos des Grossen mit seinem Bruder Heinrich-1840.jpg|The Reconciliation of Emperor Otto I with his brother Heinrich in 941 in Frankfurt am Main (1840) by Alfred Rethel\nFile:Schöner, Johann, Erdglobus mit Holzgestell, um 1515, Holz, Pappmaché, Papier © Historisches Museum Frankfurt am Main Fotograf Uwe Dettmar.jpg|Johannes Schöner's Terrestrial globe with wooden frame, around 1515, wood, papier-mâché\nFile:HMF Treuner Roemerberg Nikolaikirche DSC 6279.jpg|A highlight of the museum is the Treuner Brothers' model of the old town (Altstadt), showing how it looked before World War II bombing.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Germany\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
