He was a linen and cloth merchant who became a justice of the peace, Lord Mayor of Leeds in 1848/1849, and a director of the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway.\nEdward Carbutt went into business as a mechanical engineer in Leeds. When he was 24 (circa 1862) he entered into partnership with the engineer Robinson Thwaites (1811–1884) in the Vulcan Iron Works at Bradford. Carbutt and Thwaites exhibited a 'Patent Double-Action Self-Acting Steam Hammer' at the 1862 London Exhibition.

In 1896 he was appointed High Sheriff of Surrey.\nIn 1887 Carbutt was elected President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He represented the Institute on the committee of the National Physical Laboratory. He was also a vice president of the Iron and Steel Institute.  In 1891 he was concerned with the erection of a tower at Wembley to rival the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\nIn 1874 Carbutt married Mary Rhodes.
