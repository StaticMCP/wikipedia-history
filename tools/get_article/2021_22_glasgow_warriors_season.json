With the addition of the 4 Super Rugby Unlocked franchises of the Bulls, Sharks, Stormers and the Lions, the Pro14 rebranded itself as the United Rugby Championship.\nThere will be 4 regional conferences with teams playing their regional rivals home and away; and teams from the other conferences either home or away.\nWith 16 teams in total, this means 18 normal matches in the season before the play-offs.\nAs Scotland and Italy only have 2 teams each in the United Rugby Championship, they were placed in one regional conference; the Irish sides, Welsh sides and South African sides had their own regional conferences respectively.\nTeam\nCoaches\n* Head coach:  Danny Wilson\n* Assistant coach:   Kenny Murray (to January 2022)\n* Assistant coach:   Peter Murchie\n* Assistant coach:   Nigel Carolan\n* Scrum Coach:   Alasdair Dickinson\n* Head Strength and Conditioning Coach:  Cillian Reardon\n* Senior Athletic Performance Coach: Damien O'Donoghue\n* Sport Scientist: Robin Reidy\n* Lead Performance Analyst: Greg Woolard\n* Asst.

A second friendly, to be played a week before the Worcester match, was confirmed to be against the Newcastle Falcons at Scotstoun Stadium.\nThe side named to play against Newcastle Falcons was affected by several of the Glasgow players being in isolation due to the coronavirus pandemic; and Super 6 players and academy players were drafted into the Warriors line-up.\nIn the match against Newcastle Falcons, both Ratu Tagive and Kiran McDonald received injuries which will keep them out of action for months. After a collision with Newcastle fullback Mike Brown, Tagive broke his cheekbone, requiring surgery. McDonald took a blow to his kidney in the match.\nA 'Clash of the Warriors' cup was specially produced for the match with Worcester Warriors. It is intended that a return match at Scotstoun will also play for the cup in the following pre-season.\nHead Coach Danny Wilson was pleased with the two friendly outings; and especially the Worcester win. He stated after the 'Clash of the Warriors':\nLast week wasn’t about winning, it was about the first hit out and getting the lads playing some rugby, but tonight was about coming here to get an away win because our next game will be about winning away so we came here to do that. There were a couple of sticky moments in the first half when they were attacking well and the whole game was very physical, but in the second half in particular some guys took their opportunities so we have some headaches ahead of the first selection. It is a case of small stepping stones in pre-season, but getting everybody out there playing and no major injuries is good – but we won’t read too much into it. Still, when you set out your stall to play hard and get a win, not just giving people a game, then it is good to get a win and the players will get some confidence because of that.\nA Super6 pro-alignment fixture was announced for 18 June 2022. Players from Ayrshire Bulls, Stirling County and Boroughmuir Bears will represent Glasgow Warriors. Players from Watsonians, Heriot's Rugby and Southern Knights will represent Edinburgh. The Warriors team was mixed with current Academy prospects like Jamie Drummond, Rory Jackson and Michael Gray, alongside ex-Warriors like Robert Beattie and the previous Academy player Logan Trotter; the Australian 7s international player Liam McNamara and the Cyprus international player Marcus Holden. The Edinburgh side had breakthrough Edinburgh players Kwagga van Niekerk and Harrison Courtney, ex-Edinburgh players like Jason Baggott and Cameron Fenton (Fenton has also played for Glasgow Warriors); alongside the Wales international 7s player Joe Jenkins and the Scotland international 7s player Nyle Godsmark; and former London Irish player Rory Brand.\nMatch 1\n|score = 7–12\n|report = [https://www.glasgowwarriors.org/news/squad-named-for-newcastle-clash Preview][https://www.glasgowwarriors.org/fixtures-results/2021-22/pre-season/3sep/glasgow-warriors-v-newcastle-falcons Report][http://www.glasgowwarriors.com/articles/match/011109.php Report][https://www.theoffsideline.com/glasgow-v-newcastle-warriors-fail-to-capitalise-on-promising-start/ Report]\n|away =   Newcastle Falcons\n|try1 = Duncan Weir\n|con1 = Duncan Weir\n|pen1=\n|try2 = Callum ChickGeorge Wacokecoke\n|con2 = Will Haydon-Wood\n|pen2=\n|stadium = Scotstoun Stadium\n|attendance = 3464\n|referee = Hollie Davidson (SRU)\n}}\nGlasgow Warriors: Ollie Smith (Cole Forbes 51); Rufus McLean (Finlay Callaghan 61), Sione Tuipulotu (Nick Grigg 61), Stafford McDowall (Pete Horne 51), Ratu Tagive (Logan Trotter 41); Duncan Weir (Ross Thompson 51), Sean Kennedy (Jamie Dobie 51); Tom Lambert (George Thornton 51), Johnny Matthews (Grant Stewart 51), Murray McCallum (Murphy Walker 51), Lewis Bean (Max Williamson 51), Richie Gray (Rob Harley 51), Kiran McDonald (Scott Cummings 51), Rory Darge (Tom Gordon 51), Ryan Wilson (Rory Jackson 51)\nNewcastle Falcons: 15 Mike Brown, 14 Ollie Lindsay-Hague, 13 George Wacokecoke, 12 Pete Lucock, 11 Iwan Stephens, 10 Brett Connon, 9 Sam Stuart; 1 Adam Brocklebank, 2 George McGuigan, 3 Mark Tampin, 4 Marco Fuser, 5 Philip van der Walt, 6 Josh Basham, 7 Will Welch, 8 Callum Chick\nReplacements: 16 Robbie Smith, 17 Kyle Cooper, 18 Conor Kenny, 19 Matthew Dalton, 20 Carl Fearns, 21 James Blackett, 22 Will Haydon-Wood, 23 Ben Stevenson, [blank shirts]: Mark Dormer, Oscar Caudle, George Merrick, Freddie Lockwood, Marcus Tiffen, Ewan Greenlaw, Louie Johnson (all used)\nMatch 2 - Warriors Cup\n|score =  22–27\n|report = [https://www.glasgowwarriors.org/news/wilson-names-squad-for-trip-to-worcester Preview][https://web.archive.org/web/20210920192138/https://glasgowwarriors.org/fixtures-results/2021-22/pre-season/10sep/worcester-warriors-v-glasgow-warriors Report][http://www.glasgowwarriors.com/articles/match/011104.php Report][https://www.theoffsideline.com/worcester-v-glasgow-rufus-mclean-double-gives-visitors-morale-boosting-win/ Report]\n|away =   Glasgow Warriors\n|try1 = Willi HeinzOllie LawrenceMelani Nanai\n|con1 = Owen Williams x 2\n|pen1= Billy Searle\n|try2 = Rufus McLean x 2Lewis Bean\n|con2 = Ross Thompson x 2Duncan Weir\n|pen2= Ross ThompsonDuncan Weir\n|stadium = Sixways Stadium\n|attendance = 3,751\n|referee = Adam Leal (RFU)\n}}\nWorcester Warriors: 1 Ethan Waller, 2 Scott Baldwin, 3 Christian Judge, 4 Matt Garvey, 5 Justin Clegg, 6 Ted Hill (CC), 7 Sam Lewis, 8 Kyle Hatherell, 9 Willi Heinz (CC), 10 Owen Williams, 11 Harri Doel, 12 Francois Venter, 13 Ollie Lawrence, 14 Noah Heward, 15 Melani Nanai Replacements: Niall Annett, Lewis Holsey, Jay Tyack, Graham Kitchener, James Scott, Morgan Monks, Caleb Montgomery, Matt Kvesic, Will Chudley, Billy Searle, Tom Howe, Ashley Beck, Oli Morris, Perry Humphreys, Jamie Shillcock [all used – except James Scott & Tom Howe]\nGlasgow Warriors: 1.

Robbie Chalmers\nUnited Rugby Championship\nThe season's opener was away to Ulster. It was a match the Warriors could have won scoring 4 tries – but unfortunately they conceded 5 tries. There were some positives; 2 bonus points were earned and Rory Darge secured the man of the match. Darge's performance prompted Jack Dempsey to compare his work-rate with that of Australian captain Michael Hooper. The home match against Sharks saw the Warriors quickly secure a bonus point in the first half. Scoring a quick try in the second half, the Warriors game seemed to lose a gear after Sione Tuipulotu ran in for what would have been a sixth try, but the referee Ben Whitehouse chalked it off for obstruction. This let the South African side regroup somewhat and at the end of the match the Sharks had scored 3 tries; which was an otherwise comfortable game for the Glasgow giants. Glasgow Assistant Coach Peter Murchie was delighted with Glasgow's play up until the Warriors eased off: \"I thought we were excellent for the first 50 minutes – we scored some fantastic tries and that’s probably some of the best rugby we’ve played since I’ve been here as a coach.\" Darge received another man of the match award against the Lions. The Lions proved toothless with no clean breaks in the match but the kicking of EW Viljoen kept the South African side in contention. Danny Wilson said: \"We played so well in the first half and created so much, but it was a little bit forced with the offloads. We were trying to force the issue when we should have been more patient. In the second half, the weather came in and there were more scrums. We didn’t want that, because we knew the scrum was a really powerful weapon for them.\"\nLeague table\nResults\nRound 1\n|score = 35–29\n|report =
