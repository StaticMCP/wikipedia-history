      "text": "# Queen Jeongsuk\n\nQueen Jeongsuk of the Dongju Choe clan (; 1232–20 September ?) was the second wife of Yi Haengni and mother of Yi Chun, making her the great-grandmother of Yi Seonggye, the founder of the Joseon Dynasty. She was honoured as Jeong-Bi (; \"the virtuous queen\") at first.\nBiography\nShe was born in 1232 as the daughter of Choe Gi-Yeol, Prince Anbyeon () from the Dongju Choe clan () and his unnamed wife. She was the second wife of Yi Haengni () because his first wife, Lady Son () died too early.\nOn 28 July 1392, when her great-grandson, Yi Seong-Gye () established a new dynasty, she was given the royal title Jeong-bi (; literally: Queen Jeong or Consort Jeong) and her husband was given the title King Ik (). Later on 22 April 1411, her great-great-grandson, Taejong of Joseon, gave her a posthumous name, Queen Jeongsuk ().\nWith Yi Haeng-ni, she had 7 sons and 1 daughter. However, she later died on 20 September in an unknown year. Her tomb was located in Sukneung, Muncheon-gun, Hamgyeongnam-do and her husband's tomb was located in Jireung, Anbyeon-gun, Hamgyeongnam-do.\nFamily\n* Father - Choe Gi-Yeol, Prince Anbyeon (최기열 안변군; 1205–?)\n* Unnamed mother (1205–?)\n* Spouse - Yi Haeng-ni, King Ikjo of Joseon (조선 익조; 1236–?)\n** Father-in-law - Yi Ahn-sa, King Mokjo of Joseon (조선 목조; 1204–1274)\n** Mother-in-law - Queen Hyogong of the Pyeonchang Yi clan (효공왕후 이씨; 1207–?)\n* Issue\n** Son - Yi Song, Grand Prince Hamwon (이송 함원대군; 1256–?)\n** Son - Yi Won, Grand Prince Hamcheon (이원 함천대군; 1260–?)\n** Son - Yi Go-tae, Grand Prince Hamneung (이고태 함릉대군; 1263–?)\n** Son - Yi Chun, King Dojo of Joseon (조선 도조; 1265–1342)\n** Son - Yi Jeon, Grand Prince Hamyang (이전 함양대군; 1267–?)\n** Daughter - Princess Anui (안의공주; 1269–?)\n** Son - Yi Eung-sin (이응신; 1270–?)\n** Son - Yi Eung-geo, Grand Prince Hamseong (이응거 함성대군; 1274–?)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0050464 Queen Jeongsuk] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture ."
