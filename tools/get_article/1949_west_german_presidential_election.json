He was elected by the Federal Convention (composed of all members of the Bundestag and an equal number of delegates selected by the state legislatures).\nBackground\nUnder the 1949 Basic Law, the new office of the Federal President was given substantially reduced powers when compared with the preceding office of Reich President, which was subject to the abuse of emergency powers under Nazi Germany.\nThis was the first German presidential election in post-war Germany and the second indirect election since 1919 that elected Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert as Germany's first President.\nResults\nHeuss assumed a largely ceremonial role upon his election as Federal President in the second round. Federal President Heuss took the oath of office in front of Bundestag and Bundesrat the same day of his election, 12 September 1949. Heuss's duties notably included the nomination of the first Federal Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer of the CDU, who took office on 15 September 1949.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" |First Round\n! colspan=\"2\" |Second Round\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Supporting party\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\" | Voters\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | %\n!Voters\n!%\n|-\n| Theodor Heuss\n| 377\n| 46.9%\n|416\n|51.7%\n| FDP\n| FDP, CDU/CSU, DP\n|-\n| Kurt Schumacher\n| 311\n| 38.7%\n|312\n|38.8%\n|SPD\n!\n|-\n| Rudolf Amelunxen\n| 28\n| 3.5%\n|30\n|3.7%\n|Zentrum\n!\n|-\n| Hans Schlange-Schöningen\n| 6\n| 0.7%\n|2\n|0.2%\n| CDU\n!\n|-\n| Karl Arnold\n| 1\n| 0.1%\n!\n!\n| CDU\n!\n|-\n| Josef Müller\n| 1\n| 0.1%\n!\n!\n| CSU\n!\n|-\n| Alfred Loritz\n| 1\n| 0.1%\n!\n!\n| WAV\n!\n|-\n|Valid votes\n|725\n|100%\n|760\n|100%\n!\n!\n|-\n| Abstention\n| 76\n| 9.5%\n|37\n|4.6%\n!\n!\n|-\n| Invalid\n| 2\n| 0.2%\n|3\n|0.4%\n!\n!\n|-\n|Total votes\n|803\n|100%\n|800\n|100%\n!\n!\n|}\nReferences"
