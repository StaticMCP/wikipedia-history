Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in Delaware since January 1, 1973. On January 1, 2012, civil unions became available to same-sex couples, granting them the \"rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities\" of married persons. Delaware legalized same-sex marriage on July 1, 2013.\nState law bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and the state has legally banned the practice of conversion therapy on minors since July 2018.

Sokola and Melanie George introduced a bill to create civil unions in Delaware. It was approved by the Delaware Legislature. Governor Jack Markell signed the legislation on May 11, 2011, and it took effect on January 1, 2012. In 2012, Delaware issued at least 565 civil union licenses, much higher than advocates had anticipated.\nIn March 2012, Markell said he thought that the legalization of same-sex marriage in Delaware was \"inevitable\" and would be passed \"probably within the next few years\". In September, Representative Pete Schwartzkopf said he expected the General Assembly to vote on same-sex marriage in 2013 and that he would support it, but was uncertain of the legislation's prospects. A bill to allow same-sex marriage and convert civil unions to marriages passed the Delaware House by a vote of 23 to 18 on April 23. The Senate approved it by a vote of 12 to 9 on May 7, and that same day the Governor signed the legislation, which went into effect July 1, 2013.\nAdoption and parenting\nDelaware law permits any unmarried adult or married couple to petition a court for adoption of a child.

Since January 2012, same-sex couples in a civil union or marriage have had the same adoption rights as opposite-sex couples.\nDiscrimination protections and hate crime legislation\nThe University of Delaware's policy on both discrimination and harassment has included sexual orientation since 1990.\nSince 2009, Delaware law has prohibited discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation in employment, housing, public accommodations, and other areas.

As of February 11, 2017, sex reassignment surgery is no longer an explicit requirement to obtain an amended birth certificate. Instead, a signed affidavit from a medical provider is required, stating that there has been \"surgical, hormonal, psychological or other treatment appropriate for the individual for the purpose of gender transition.\"\nIn 2015, the Delaware General Assembly passed a law to make it easier for inmates to access and/or change the name on their birth certificates to reflect their gender identity. Previously, inmates could only change their names due to religious beliefs. Democratic Governor Jack Markell signed the bill into law on June 25, 2015. The law became effective immediately.\nSince March 26, 2016, Delaware has prohibited discrimination based on gender identity within insurance contracts.
