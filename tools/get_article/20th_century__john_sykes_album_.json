As Loveland was entirely composed of ballads, 20th Century was written to dispel accusations that Sykes had \"gone soft\". Sykes's goal with the album was also to have shorter and more \"concise\" songs, similar in vein to Van Halen's first album. The album's title was inspired by the impending end of the 20th century.\nThe album reached number 47 on the Japanese charts.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and composed by John Sykes.\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.\n{|\n|valign=top|\nMusicians\n* John Sykes – guitars, vocals, bass (on \"2 Counts\")\n* Marco Mendoza – bass\n* Simon Phillips – drums\nAdditional musicians\n* Tommy O'Steen – drums (on \"2 Counts\")\n* Tommy Aldridge – drums (on \"Look In His Eyes\")\n* Bonnie Bonapart – drums (on \"System Ain't Working\" and \"Found What I Needed\")\n* Mars Lasar – keyboards\n|valign=top|\nProduction\n* John Sykes – production\n* Noel Golden – mixing\n* Jeff Robinette – additional mix engineering\n* Orris Henry – additional engineering\n* Eddy Schreyer – mastering\nArtwork\n* William Hames – photography\n* John Sykes and Tami Fukatami – artwork concept\n* Masahiro Yamazaki and Ryota Mizuki – designs\n|}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Chart performance for Loveland\n|+\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1997)\n!align=\"left\"|Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Japanese Albums (Oricon)\n| 47\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
