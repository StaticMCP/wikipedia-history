They are members of the North West Junior Hockey League (NWJHL). The Kings moved from the Coca-Cola Centre to the Crosslink Sports Centre in January 2014, which has a capacity of 600.\nHistory\nThe Kings (formerly the Wheelers) joined the NWJHL when the league began operations in 1994.  It took the Kings nearly 20 years to capture their first league championship but did so on March 26, 2013.\nIn the 2013-2014 NWJHL season the Kings hosted the Hockey Alberta Investors Group Junior B Provincial Championship. Despite losing the NWJHL finals to the North Peace Navigators, Grande Prairie had already secured a spot as tournament host.  The Kings captured a silver medal falling 6 to 0 to the Blackfalds Wranglers in the provincial final.\nSeason-by-season record\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, PIM = Penalties in minutes\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background-color:#dddddd;\" |\n|Season || GP || W || L || OTL || Pts || GF || GA || PIM || Finish || Playoffs\n|-\n| 2009-10 || 35 || 19 || 14 || 2 || 40 || 153 || 162 || 1471 || 3rd NWJHL || Won quarterfinals  3-0, (Vipers) Won semifinals 4-0, (Huskies)Lost in Finals, 0-4 (Wolverines)\n|-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 2010-11 || 35 || 20 || 9  || 6 || 46 || 158 || 112 || 998  || 3rd NWJHL || Won quarterfinals  3-0, (Huskies)Lost in Semifinals, 1-4 (Navigators)\n|-\n| 2011-12 || 36 || 30 || 6 || 0 || 60 || 228 || 93 || 941 || 2nd NWJHL || Won quarterfinals  3-0, (Jr. Canucks)Lost in semi-finals, 0-4 (Wolverines)\n|-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 2012-13 || 35 || 32 || 3 || 0 || 64 || 257 || 98 ||  || 1st NWJHL || Won quarterfinals  3-0, (Vipers)Won semi-finals, 4-1 (Huskies)Won finals, 4-2 (Navigators)League Champions\n|-\n| 2013-14 || 35 || 27 || 6 || 2 || 56 || 228 || 128 || 1471 || 2nd NWJHL || Won quarterfinals  3-0, (Vipers) Won semifinals 1-1, (Fairview Flyers)Lost finals, 1-4 (Navigators)\n|-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 2014-15 || 30 || 24 || 5 || 1 || 49 || - || - || - || 2nd of 7 NWJHL || Won quarterfinals (forfeit), (Blades)Lost semi-finals, 2-4 (Fairview Flyers)\n|-\n| 2015-16 || 36 || 21 || 14 || 1 || 43 || 173 || 131 || - || 3rd of 7 NWJHL || Won quarterfinals 3-0, (Jr. Canucks)Lost semi-finals, 4-1 (Navigators)\n|-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 2016-17 || 30 || 13 || 13 || 4 || 30 || 104 || 105 || - || 5th of 6 NWJHL || Won quarterfinals 3-1, (Jr. Canucks)Lost semifinals 3-4, (Fairview Flyers)\n|-\n| 2017-18 || 36 || 21 || 13 || 2 || 44 || 146 || 128 || - ||4th of 7 NWJHL ||Won quarterfinals 3-2, (Fairview Flyers)lost semifinal 1-4 (Huskies)\n|-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 2018-19 || 36 || 19 || 15 || 2 || 40 || 151 || 141 || - ||3rd of 7 NWJHL ||Won quarterfinals 3-2, (Vipers)Won semifinal 4-3 (Jr. Canucks)Lost League Finals 2-4 (Huskies)advance to Barnes Cup as League finalist\n|-\n| 2019-20 || 40 || 14 || 21 || 5 || 33 || 128 || 161 || - ||5th of 7 NWJHL ||Lost quarterfinals 2-3, (Fairview Flyers)\n|-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 2020–21 || 5 || 5 ||0 || 0 || 10 || 32 || 13 ||—|| colspan=\"2\"| Season cancelled due to covid-19 pandemic\n|-\n| 2021-22 || 40 || 19 || 20 || 0 || 38 || 148 || 147 || - ||3rd of 7 NWJHL ||Won quarterfinals 3-0, (Navigators)Won semifinals 2-4(Kodiaks)Lost finals, 2-4 (Huskies)\n|-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 2022–23 || 42 || 32 || 7 || 3 || 67 || 148 || 147 || - ||2nd of 8 NWJHL ||Won quarterfinals 3-0, (Blades)Won semifinals 4-0(Vipers)Lost finals, 2-4 (Huskies)\n|-\n| 2023-24 || 42 || 18 || 10 || 4 || 60 || 181 || 122 || - ||3rd of 8 NWJHL ||Lost quarterfinals 1-3, (Navigators)\n|-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n| 2024-25 || 40 || 25 || 15 || 0 || 50 || 179 || 149 || - ||2nd of 4 N/S Div3 of 8 NWJHL ||Lost Div Semi 2-3, (Blades)\n|}\nRuss Barnes Trophy\nAlberta Jr B Provincial Championships\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background-color:#dddddd;\" |\n|Year || Round Robin || Record || Standing || Semifinal || Bronze Medal Game ||Gold Medal Game\n|-\n|  2013 || L, Red Deer Vipers 4-6W, Wetaskiwin Icemen 6-2L, Cold Lake Ice 4-6 ||   1-2-0||  3rd of 4 Pool ? ||n/a ||n/a||   n/a\n|-\n|  2014HOST|| W, Blackfalds Wranglers 6-4L, Cold Lake Ice 5-3W, Ft.
