It received positive reviews from critics.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = DIY\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = The Line of Best Fit\n| rev3score = 8/10\n| rev4 = NME\n| rev4score =\n}}\nIms Taylor of DIY called it \"ethereal, exploratory, and unexpected\", calling it \"a bitesize promise of exciting things to come\". Taylor also found that \"moody guitar meanderings and offbeat vocal musings are English Teacher's weapons of choice\". The Line of Best Fits Kieran Macadie summarised it as \"a solid body of work from a fresh young band that intend to make their mark on music – filled with absurdist humour, orbiting guitar riffs and punchy melody\".\nReviewing the EP for NME, Sophie Williams called the five tracks \"punchy, melodic songs [that] unite nervy, whirlpooling guitars with cutting takedowns of the day-to-day (laborious supermarket trips, hangovers, dodgy dates). It makes for a deliciously sour debut EP, set to a soundtrack of restless art-punk\". Eddie Smith of Beats Per Minute wrote that the band's \"haunting arpeggios lurch into a capricious mix of poetry, bass riffs and guitar stabs, making for an exhilarating 16 minutes\" with \"math rock volatility\" and \"overt indie pop moments present\".\nTrack listing\nReferences"
