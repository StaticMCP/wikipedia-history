It was written by David Phillips, and directed by Chris Thomson, and stars Jack Thompson, Brad Davis and Germain Houde.\nPlot\nFrom 1978 to 1985, the Rainbow Warrior was the flagship of the Greenpeace fleet, active in supporting a number of anti-whaling, anti-seal hunting, anti-nuclear testing and anti-nuclear waste dumping campaigns, during that period. In 1985 it was at the Port of Auckland in New Zealand on its way to a protest against a planned French nuclear test in Moruroa. It was sunk by a bombing operation by the \"action\" branch of the French foreign intelligence services, the Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure (DGSE), carried out on 10 July 1985. Fernando Pereira, a photographer, drowned on the sinking ship.\nCast\n* Jack Thompson as Stuart Irvine\n* Brad Davis as Neil Travers\n* Germain Houde as Alain Mafart\n* Louise Laparé as Dominique Prieur\n* Peter Carroll as Louis-Pierre Dillais\n* Guy Thauvette as Manignet\n* Bruno Lawrence as Terry Batchelor\n* Christian Manon as French Priest\n* Alex Menglet as Velche\n* Gary Day\n* Justin Monjo as Hendrick\nSee also\n* The Rainbow Warrior, 1993 film\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the-screen-guide/t/the-rainbow-warrior-conspiracy-1988/1379/ The Rainbow Warrior Conspiracy] at screenaustralia\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20220217021637/https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b79f4591d The Rainbow Warrior Conspiracy] at BFI\n*[http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/feature-project/pages/Rainbow-Warrior.php The Rainbow Warrior Conspiracy] at NZ Film Archive"
