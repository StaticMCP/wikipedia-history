His contribution to the study of medieval Spain was recognised by his appointment to the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1989.\nBiography\nRoger Highfield enjoyed a long career at Merton College Oxford which began in 1948 when he joined the college as a Harmsworth Senior Scholar. Prior to that he read history at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was tutored by the influential historians A. J. P. Taylor and K. B. McFarlane. He also did military service in the Royal Artillery.\nIn 1951 he became Tutor in History at Merton, a post he kept until he retired in 1989, teaching alongside historians Robert Gildea and Philip Waller. He was also a colleague of J. R. R. Tolkien, for whom he had little respect, describing the author as “very lazy\" and “the worst sub-warden ever”, adding that Tolkien-mania left him “baffled”. When champagne was ordered to mark Tolkien's donation to the College of his original manuscript of The Hobbit, Highfield remarked acidly: \"waste of good champagne\".\nHe was tutor to the emperor of Japan Naruhito at Merton College and is mentioned in his memoir The Thames and I.\nHighfield served as Merton's archivist for almost 40 years, as well as other college offices. In 1953 Highfield began a series of annual history reading weeks in Cornwall, open to all undergraduate historians, a tradition which continues today.\nIn 1997 he published the History of Merton College, which was jointly authored with the historian and archivist Geoffrey Martin, drawing heavily on documents from the College archives.\nHighfield's scholarship focused on late medieval Spain, in recognition of which he was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1989.\nSelected publications\n*The Early Rolls of Merton College, Oxford; with an appendix of thirteenth-century Oxford charters.
