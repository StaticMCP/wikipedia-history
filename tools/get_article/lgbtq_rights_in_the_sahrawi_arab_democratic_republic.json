According to the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR), there is thus no type of protection for LGBTQ individuals in case of discrimination or violence. Most residents of the country are Muslim, and same-sex relationships are seen as a foreign phenomenon.\nThe region was under Spanish colonial rule until 1976, and homosexuality was not decriminalized in Spain until 1979. Same-sex sexual activity is also illegal in Morocco, which occupies most of the territory in Western Sahara claimed by the SADR.\nSee also\n*Human rights in Western Sahara\n*LGBTQ rights in Morocco\nReferences"
