The first women's suffrage group was created in 1855 in Earlville, Illinois by Susan Hoxie Richardson. The Illinois Woman Suffrage Association (IWSA), later renamed the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association (IESA), was created by Mary Livermore in 1869. This group held annual conventions and petitioned various governmental bodies in Illinois for women's suffrage. On June 19, 1891, women gained the right to vote for school offices. However, it wasn't until 1913 that women saw expanded suffrage. That year women in Illinois were granted the right to vote for Presidential electors and various local offices. Suffragists continued to fight for full suffrage in the state. Finally, Illinois became the first state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment on June 10, 1919. The League of Women Voters (LWV) was announced in Chicago on February 14, 1920.\n19th century\n1850s\n1855\n* Alonzo Jackson Grover gives the first women's suffrage speech in Illinois.\n*Susan Hoxie Richardson creates the Earlville Suffrage Association.\n1860s\n1869\n* Mary Livermore organizes a women's suffrage convention in Chicago.\n*During the convention, the Illinois Woman Suffrage Association (IWSA) is created.\n*Livermore starts the women's suffrage newspaper, The Agitator.\n1870s\n1870\n* February: Frances Willard and the IWSA petition the Illinois Constitutional Convention to include women's suffrage in the state constitution.\n*February: Annual meeting of IWSA held at the Opera House in Springfield, Illinois.\n1871\n* Annual convention of IWSA held at Farewell Hall in Chicago.\n1872\n* Annual convention of IWSA held in the Opera House in Bloomington, Illinois.\n1873\n* School offices are opened to women in Illinois.\n1874\n* Ten women are elected to County Superintendent of Schools.\n1876\n* Elizabeth Boynton Harbert becomes president of IWSA.\n* IWSA affiliates with the National Women's Suffrage Association (NWSA).\n1879\n* Frances Willard brings a petition to the General Assembly for women to have suffrage rights over alcohol-related issues in Illinois.\n1880s\n1884\n* The American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) holds their annual convention in Chicago.\n1885\n* Susan B.
