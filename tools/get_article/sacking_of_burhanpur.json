The Maratha army commanded by Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Sersenapati Sarlashkar Hambirrao Mohite attacked and plundered the city for three days. The Marathas got a huge loot and returned to Raigad by evading Mughal forces. Marathas also sacked Aurangabad after this sack. This event caused the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to turn his expedition towards the Deccan, which caused the Execution of Sambhaji.\nSacking of Burhanpur\nHambirrao Mohite reached the forests near Burhanpur with a 15,000-strong cavalry force. Kakar Khan gathered civilian forces and decided to attack Hambirrao at midnight. As he came out of the city gates, Sambhaji Maharaj himself attacked from the old trenches with a cavalry force of 4,000. Sambhaji Maharaj's force routed the ill-prepared Mughal garrison. Sambhaji Maharaj then left 200-300 soldiers at the main city gate and left for Bahadurpura, the richest suburb of the city. Sambhaji Maharaj started to loot the houses of the richest merchants which were shown to him by his spies. Hambirrao's force soon joined Sambhaji Maharaj and the combined Maratha force started looting the city. Hambirrao, then sealed the city's entrances to ensure that the word of the attack did not spread. Marathas looted the city consecutively for three days. Marathas earned a loot estimated to be around 2 crore rupees.\nMovies\nThe sacking is depicted in the opening scenes of the 2025 Hindi film Chhaava.\nReferences"
