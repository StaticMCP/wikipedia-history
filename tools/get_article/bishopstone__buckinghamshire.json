It is not known to which Bishop this refers though as the village lies within the ancient diocese of Lincoln, it presumedly denotes property owned by the Bishop of Lincoln. The village was first recorded in manorial rolls of 1227 as Bissopeston''.\nLocation\nBishopstone resides amongst farm land just a mile east of Stone and two miles south of Aylesbury. The village is overlooked by the Chiltern Hills, most notably Coombe Hill with its Boer War memorial, a well known Buckinghamshire landmark and viewpoint. Bishopstone is easily accessible from the A418 which runs from Aylesbury to Thame in Oxfordshire.\nAmenities\nDue to Bishopstone's relatively remote location there is a limited bus service. The closest train stations are located in Aylesbury and at Little Kimble 2.5 miles south. The only pub in the village, The Harrow, was closed for 5 years but re-opened in October 2019 after a total refurbishment of both the grounds and building. There is no village shop; however neighbouring Stone is host to an Indian restaurant, a petrol filling station, antiques store, a grocery store and post office.\nGallery\nImage:Monbish.jpg|The War memorial on Main Road\nImage:Villagehall.jpg|Bishopstone Village hall\nImage:Mainback3.jpg|Main Road, Bishopstone\nImage:Barn2.jpg|A ruined farm building\nImage:Moreton1.jpg|Moreton Lane Street Sign\nImage:Mainminus1.jpg|Main Road facing West\nImage:Foot1.jpg|Footpath towards Aylesbury\nImage:Foot22.jpg|The North Bucks way\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721185700/http://www.bishopstone.info/ Bishopstone Village Website]\n*[http://www.theharrowbishopstone.co.uk The Harrow at Bishopstone (Pub & Restaurant)]\npl:Bishopstone"
