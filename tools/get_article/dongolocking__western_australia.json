The only remnants of the original townsite is the Dongolocking Hall, and the (disused) tennis courts, which is maintained and used for events such as annual Christmas social gatherings. The original hall was replaced in 1960 by the current town hall due to deterioration. The towns legacy can also be found in the town of Katanning where the original Dongolocking School Building was transported to for use on the Katanning Primary School site, where it is still used by the Education Department today.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.dumbleyung.wa.gov.au/historicallocalitysigns History of Dongolocking]\n* [http://museum.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/1.%20Chapman_0.pdf Introduction to Dongolocking Nature Reserve]"
