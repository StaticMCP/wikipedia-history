The book expands every army with new units and gear, introducing paramedics, AI forces, and standout characters from Mutant Chronicles like Cardinal Dominic and kamikaze Mishiman operatives. Some additions include AI rules, indirect fire and clubbing, sweep attacks and anti-sniper tactics, and close combat now includes mechanics like parries and counter-charges.\nPublication history\nWarzone: Dawn of War is the first supplement for the Warzone sci-fi wargame.\nReception\nMark Donald reviewed Warzone: Dawn of War for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall, and stated that \"Anyone who counts Warzone among their pursuits should be able to put this book to good use. My only reservation is that, by trying to cover so many forces evenly, some of the ideas are given scant regard. I feel future supplements should specialise.\"\nReviews\n* #4\nReferences"
