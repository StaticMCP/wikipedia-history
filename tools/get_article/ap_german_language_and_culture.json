However, in 1983, due to the persistently low number of AP German Literature exam students, the College Board dropped the Literature exam. Since then, they have offered only the AP German Language exam.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-german-language-and-culture German Language and Culture at CollegeBoard.com]"
