In early April 2008, the pre-production demo tracks of the entire album were released on multiple P2P clients. The band stated in an April 19 blog that this leaked version was not the complete album and they had yet to mix, master, and rearrange some of the tracks. The band did however release the first single \"MegaDEATH\" on April 29 and noted that it was in fact a final, album version.\nAndrea Dyer of Exclaim! gave it a negative review.\nTrack listing\n# \"A Ticket to the Pussy Crusher\" - 1:01\n# \"Doug Burns to Death\" - 2:09\n# \"You Look Better When You're Drunk\" - 3:11\n# \"You Use Dirt as a Metaphor for Life\" - 2:19\n# \"Megadeath\" - 3:04\n# \"Americant\" - 3:39\n# \"Ham Hands Lives\" - 2:59\n# \"Taking Back the Night Life\" - 2:55\n# \"Bad Rock Anthem\" - 2:22\n# \"Amaranthine\" - 2:16\n# \"Chernobyll\" - 14:39 (The song \"Chernobyll\" lasts until 1:48.
