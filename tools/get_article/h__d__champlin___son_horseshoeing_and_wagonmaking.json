D. Champlin & Son Horseshoeing and Wagonmaking shop building is located on Main Street (NY 301) in Nelsonville, New York, United States. It is a typical commercial structure for a common business of the late 19th century that survives in good condition. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nChamplin started his business in 1858 in a building on nearby Spring Street behind the present property. His name does not show up on maps at that site until 1876, and only by 1912 does the current, one-story brick building appear on any map of the village.\nThe entranceway was expanded and a larger door installed at some point before then. It is used today as a garage.\nReferences"
