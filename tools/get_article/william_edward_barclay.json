When the majority of the Everton set-up left Anfield in order to move to the purpose-built Goodison Park, Barclay was one of the people who stayed to form a new club which eventually became Liverpool F.C.\nWhile he was in charge of the side that won the Second Division championship in 1893–94, Liverpool got relegated from the First Division the following season (with Liverpool losing a test match to Bury 1–0). However, in his last season as Liverpool manager, Barclay led the side to the Second Division championship in 1895–96.\nBarclay also served two spells as Liverpool chairman and worked for the Football Association.\nBarclay remained the only person to have managed both Liverpool and Everton until the appointment of Rafael Benítez as Everton manager in 2021.\nReferences"
