Of those, 363,647 people voted for independence of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic.\nInternational observers were invited, including representatives of the US State Department. However, only representatives of the St. Petersburg city council accepted the invitation to participate. In the conclusion of the observers, the referendum was an expression of the true will of  Transnistria's population. The United States, which did not avail itself of the invitation to watch the referendum, later expressed doubt about its veracity. Transnistria offered to hold it again, and indeed did so with the 2006 Transnistrian referendum. According to an article by the ethnic Russian researcher from Moldova Alla Skvortsova from 2002, \"polls and elections in the PMR may to some extent have been rigged\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.vspmr.org/?Part=5&Lang=Eng History of creation and development of the Parliament of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060523092822/http://www.olvia.idknet.com/news-26-08-2.htm CEC data on referendum] (Olvia Press - Official site)"
