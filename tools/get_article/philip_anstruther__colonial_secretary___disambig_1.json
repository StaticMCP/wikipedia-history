His grandfather was Sir John Anstruther, the baronet of Nova Scotia.\nOn 18 December 1819, at the age of seventeen, he joined the Ceylon Civil Service beginning as extra assistant to the Colonial Secretary and was subsequently appointed Collector of Colombo. On 1 October 1833 he was appointed as Colonial Secretary of Ceylon, taking up a position on the Executive Council of Ceylon on 7 November 1837. On numerous occasions he was called upon to take on the role of acting Governor of Ceylon. From 1840 onwards, Anstruther purchased  of crown land in the high lands around Kandy, on which he established a number of coffee plantations.\nHe married Mary Frances Stewart Mackenzie (1819-1913), daughter of James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie, the Governor of Ceylon (1837-1941), on 27 July 1838 in Scotland. They had eleven children: Mary Helen (b. 1839); Robert Durham (b. 1841); Annie Nairn (b. 1843); Jemima Stewart (b. 1845);  Philip Morrison (b. 1846); Stewart (b. 1848); John Newdegate (b. 1850); Caroline Petre (b. 1928); Keith Francis George (b. 1854); Henry Lewis (b. 1856); and Charles William (b. 1858).\nIn October 1838 he went on extended leave and was in London for two years and four months, during which time he advised the Colonial Office. His assessment of the state of affairs in Ceylon, resulted in the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord John Russell, reviewing a number of the recommendations of the Colebrooke–Cameron Commission. He retired from the Ceylon Civil Service in 1845.\nIn 1845 he was the inaugural chairman of the Ceylon Railway Company, which was established to construct and operate the colony's first railway. In 1849 he was called to present evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee on sugar and coffee planting, where he was heavily critical of the administration of Governor Torrington.\nHe died on 22 May 1863 (at the age of 60) in London, England. He is buried in Saint Cuthbert's Churchyard, Edinburgh, Scotland.\nReferences"
