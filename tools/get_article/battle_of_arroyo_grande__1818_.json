This, together with the battle itself, was a severe blow to Artigas' war effort.\nThe battle was the last action of General Curado's military campaign in the Banda Oriental. On 22 January 1820, Artigas was definitively defeated in the Battle of Tacuarembó. Two months after this episode, Rivera abandoned the fight, signing a ceasefire agreement with the Portuguese-Brazilians at Tres Arboles.\nReferences"
