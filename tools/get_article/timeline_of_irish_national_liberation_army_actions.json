Most of these actions took place as part of its 1975–1998 campaign during \"the Troubles\" in Northern Ireland. The INLA did not start claiming responsibility for its actions under the INLA name until January 1976 at which point they had already killed 12 people, before then they used the names People's Liberation Army (PLA) and People's Republican Army (PRA) to claim its attacks.\n1970s\n1974\n* 8 December: the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), along with its political wing, the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP), was founded at the Spa Hotel in Lucan, South Dublin.\n1975\n* 14 February: INLA members shot and injured a utility worker in his car in Derry, having mistaken him for a member of British security forces.\n* 20 February: the Official Irish Republican Army (OIRA) shot dead an IRSP branch chairman of Whiterock (Hugh Ferguson) in Ballymurphy, Belfast, as part of the feud between the two republican groups.\n* 25 February: the INLA shot dead an Official IRA volunteer (Sean Fox) in the Divis Flats area of Belfast; part of the feud.\n* 1 March: the INLA shot and critically injured OIRA leader Sean Garland outside his home in the Ballymun area of Dublin; part of the feud.\n* 12 March: Republican gunmen shot dead a Protestant civilian (Raymond Carrothers) at his home in the Cliftonville area of Belfast.
