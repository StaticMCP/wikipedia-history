It was reissued as a picture disc LP in July 2000 on the Cold Front label.\nThe band offered the song \"River City\" to George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign, feeling that its chorus of \"I want to rape the U.S.A.\" was appropriate.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev2score =\n| rev3 = Kerrang!\n| rev3score =\n|rev4 = Pitchfork\n|rev4score = 6.0/10\n}}\nSteve Huey of AllMusic gave the album a 3-star rating, commenting on its departure into \"catchy, garagey punk-pop tunes with jackhammer electronic beats,\" and calling it \"one of their most intriguing albums.\" Matt Le May of Pitchfork rated the album at 6.0 out of 10, describing the album as \"trite, overused guitar progressions, incompetent pentatonic solos, and seriously fucked-up lyrics,\" but going on to say that \"interesting sounds do occasionally pop up,\" and crediting the band for fully embracing \"the role of fucked-up punk rockers.\" Westword deemed it \"an oddball fusion of punk, industrial and dance.\" The Cleveland Scene called it an \"overlooked classic\" and a \"slick and severe album full of potential radio hits that should have been the Dwarves' breakout LP.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"How It's Done\" – 1:19\n# \"River City\" – 1:11\n# \"Over You\" – 2:41\n# \"Way Out\" – 1:30\n# \"Come Where The Flavor Is\" – 2:37\n# \"Deadly Eye\" – 2:30\n# \"Better Be Women\" – 2:35\n# \"I Want You To Die\" – 0:56\n# \"Johnny On The Spot\" – 1:35\n# \"Accelerator\" – 1:19\n# \"Act Like You Know\" – 1:49\n# \"Production Value\" – 1:21\nReferences"
