      "text": "# For a Swarm of Bees\n\n\"For a Swarm of Bees\" is an Anglo-Saxon metrical charm that was intended for use in keeping honey bees from swarming. The text was discovered by John Mitchell Kemble in the 19th century. The charm is named for its opening words, \"'\", meaning \"against (or towards) a swarm of bees\".\nIn the most often studied portion, towards the end of the text where the charm itself is located, the bees are referred to as ', \"victory-women\". The word has been associated by Kemble, Jacob Grimm, and other scholars with the notion of valkyries (Old English ), and \"shield maidens\", hosts of female beings attested in Old Norse and, to a lesser extent, Old English sources, similar to or identical with the Idise of the Merseburg Incantations. Some scholars have theorized the compound to be a simple metaphor for the \"victorious sword\" (the stinging) of the bees.\nIn 1909, the scholar Felix Grendon recorded what he saw as similarities between the charm and the Lorsch Bee Blessing, a manuscript portion of the Lorsch Codex, from the monastery in Lorsch, Germany. Grendon suggested that the two could possibly have a common origin in pre-Christian Germanic culture.\nCharm text\nand it is related to the Sigel (Sowilo) rune.}}\nnæfre ge wilde &nbsp; tō wuda fleogan,  Wilde means wildly, whereas wille means willfully, as well as a literal or figurative stream.}}\nbeō ge swā gemindige, &nbsp; mīnes gōdes, }}\nswā bið manna gehwilc, &nbsp; metes and ēðeles.}}}}\nSettle down, victory-women, sink to earth,\nnever be wild and fly to the woods.\nBe as mindful of my welfare,\nas is each man of border and of home.\nNotes\nReferences\nEditions\n* Foys, Martin et al.
