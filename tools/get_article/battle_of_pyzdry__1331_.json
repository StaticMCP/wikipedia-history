      "text": "# Battle of Pyzdry (1331)\n\nThe Battle of Pyzdry took place on 27 July 1331 between the Teutonic Order led by Dietrich von Altenburg and the Kingdom of Poland.\nOn 22 July 1331, Teutonic forces crossed the Vistula at Wyszogród and ravaged through Bydgoszcz, Inowrocław, and Słupca, reaching Pyzdry on 27 July. The city was captured in the absence of Prince Casimir as the future king had been evacuated, leaving the troops in Pyzdry led by the governor of Poznań Vincent of Szamotuł. Pyzdry was captured, looted and burned. Polish forces were too weak to break the branches of the Teutonic Knights and after incurring severe losses withdrew west in the direction of Poznań.\nReferences\n*Tadeusz Marian Nowak: Ladislaus the Short - politician and leader, ed.
