They compete in the Women's Super50 Cup and the Twenty20 Blaze.\nUntil 2014, the countries that make up the Windward Islands competed separately in the two competitions. In 2015, two teams named South Windward Islands and North Windward Islands competed before the current team began playing in 2016.\nHistory\nThe Windward Islands joined the West Indies domestic structure in 2016, playing in the Regional Women's Championship and the Regional Women's Twenty20 Championship. They finished fifth out of six in the 50-over competition and fourth in the T20 competition.\nPrior to this, the countries that now make up the Windward Islands team had competed separately, with Grenada joining the domestic structure for its inaugural season in 1975–76, Saint Lucia joining in 1988, Dominica in 1995 and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2000. St Lucia won two 50-over titles, and Grenada and St Vincent won one apiece. The four individual teams competed in their final season in 2014, and in 2015 were replaced in the 50-over competition by South Windward Islands and North Windward Islands. The South team finished 4th out of 6 with two wins, whilst the North team finished bottom with no victories.\nSince 2016, the now-unified Windward Islands team have competed in every edition of both the 50-over and T20 competitions. They achieved their best finish in the 50-over competition in the 2016–17 season, finishing 3rd with 3 wins. In 2023, the side finished third in both competitions, equalling their best 50-over finish and achieving their best T20 finish.\nPlayers\nCurrent squad\nBased on squad announced for the 2023 season.
