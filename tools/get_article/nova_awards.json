      "text": "# Nova Awards\n\nThe Nova Awards were presented annually, between 1973 and 2014, at the UK science fiction convention Novacon and recognised achievement in British and Irish sf fanzines.\nWhen initiated in 1973, members of Novacon could nominate fanzines but the actual judging was done by a panel of well-known fans, none of who could be said to be directly connected to a group or specific fanzine.\nIn 1974 the judging panel were unable to reach a consensus and so the award was given jointly to Zimri and Big Scab.  In 1975 the panel announced that while they had wanted to give the award to Wrinkled Shrew they felt that under the rules it had to go to Maya. The\nmanner of the presentation led to some criticism in fanzines at the time. From 1977 the judging panel was discontinued and the award was decided by popular vote of Novacon members able to demonstrate a basic familiarity with the field. Following a debate at Novacon 39 and\nfollow-up discussions at Novacon 40, the rules were changed in 2011 to allow voting by non-Novacon members resident in the UK and Eire able to meet the 'familiarity' criterion.\nOriginally there was a sole award for best fanzine. From 1981 Novas were also presented to the best fanzine writer and best fanzine artist and from 1995 there were\noccasional committee awards for 'best fan'.\nPast administrators have included Dave Langford, Pam Wells, Paul Vincent, Martin Tudor, Sandra Bond and Tony Berry. In 2009, Steve Green stepped down after seven years in the post, and Tudor resumed the reins; Tudor was unable to see the year out and\nGreen returned to run the 2010 Novas.\nIn March 2015, Novacon 45 announced the main categories were being retired, although occasional 'committee awards' might still be made.\nPast winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
