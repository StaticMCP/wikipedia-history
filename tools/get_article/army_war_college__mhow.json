It is a premier training institute of warfare and carries out research in tactics, logistics, contemporary military studies and improvement in military doctrine. The college trains about 2500-3000 officers of the Indian Armed Forces, as well as paramilitary forces each year.\nHistory\nThe college was originally established as the College of Combat at Mhow on 1 April 1971 following the merger of the Senior Officers' and Tactical Wings of the Infantry School, Mhow. Once the Higher Command Course was also started at the College, it was decided to separate the College of Combat from the Infantry School. The foundation stone of the new college campus was laid on 6 January 1983 by the then Chief of Army Staff, General K. V. Krishna Rao. The institution continued to function from the campus of Infantry School till the college moved into its new abode in August 1988. On 1 January 2003, the college was renamed as the Army War College, Mhow.\nThe college is led by the Commandant, a three-star officer from the Indian Army. The present Commandant is Lieutenant General DP Pandey .\nTraining\nA.W.C. develops doctrines and trains Army personnel for operations in existing environments to which the Indian Army forces are typically deployed, keeping in mind the modern technology and systems they encounter. A.W.C. aims to train forces for synchronised operation with other services of the armed forces.\nIt develops and validates new operational and logistic concepts through conceptual studies, war games, discussions and seminars.\nThe courses offered at A.W.C. include the Higher Command Course, the Senior Command Course, the Junior Command Course and the Defence Management Course. The Higher Command course (HCC) is a part of a Master of Philosophy programme in Defence Management, affiliated with the Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (also known as Indore University). The HCC is aimed at officers of the rank of Colonel, Captain and Group Captain who have completed their command tenure.\nAbout 2500-3000 officers of the Indian Army and Indian paramilitary forces undergo training at A.W.C. each year. In addition, about 100 officers of foreign armies also go through A.W.C. courses annually.\nJournal\nThe college publishes the War College Journal, which was previously known as the Combat Journal.\nAwards\nThe College was awarded the GOC-in-C (Army Training Command)'s unit citation in 2014.\nSee also\n* Naval War College, Goa\n* College of Air Warfare\n* Indian National Defence University\n* Military Academies in India\nReferences"
