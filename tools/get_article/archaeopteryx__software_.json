This type of program can be used for a variety of analyses of molecular data sets, but is particularly designed for phylogenomics.\nBesides tree description formats with limited expressiveness (such as Newick/New Hamphshire, Nexus), it also implements the phyloXML format.\nArchaeopteryx is the successor to Java program A Tree Viewer (ATV).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.phyloxml.org phyloXML]\n*[http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/software.html List of phylogeny software, hosted at the University of Washington]\n*[http://www.phylosoft.org/archaeopteryx/ Archaeopteryx]"
