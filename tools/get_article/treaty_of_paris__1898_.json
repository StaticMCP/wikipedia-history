Under it, Spain relinquished all claim of sovereignty over the West Indies archipelagos and islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean, the Western Pacific island of Guam in the Marianas archipelago in Micronesia, and the Western Pacific archipelago of the Philippines in Southeast Asia to the United States. The cession of the Philippines involved a compensation of $20 million from the United States to Spain.\nThe treaty was preceded by the Spanish-American War armistice, a preliminary peace agreement signed on August 12, 1898 in Washington, DC.  The armistice formally stopped the active hostilities between Spain and the United States,  requiring Spain to cede Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States, and to agree to the American occupation of Manila in the Philippines. The treaty came into effect on April 11, 1899, when the documents of ratification were exchanged. It was the first treaty negotiated between the two governments since the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty.\nThe Treaty of Paris marked the end of the Spanish Empire, apart from some small holdings. It had a major cultural impact in Spain known as the \"Generation of '98\". It marked the beginning of the United States as a world power. In the U.S., many supporters of the war opposed the treaty, which became one of the major issues in the election of 1900 when it was opposed by Democrat William Jennings Bryan, who opposed imperialism. Republican President William McKinley supported the treaty and was reelected.\nBackground\nThe Spanish–American War began on April 25, 1898, due to a series of escalating disputes between the two nations, and ended on December 10, 1898, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. It resulted in Spain's loss of its control over the remains of its overseas empire. After much of mainland in the Americas had achieved independence, Cubans tried their hand at revolution in 1868–1878, and again in the 1890s, led by José Martí. The Philippines at this time also became resistant to Spanish colonial rule. August 26, 1896, presented the first call to revolt, led by Andrés Bonifacio, succeeded by Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy. Aguinaldo then negotiated the Pact of Biak-na-Bato with the Spaniards and went into exile to Hong Kong along with the other revolutionary leaders.\nThe Spanish–American War that followed had overwhelming public support in the United States due to the popular fervor towards supporting Cuban freedom.\nOn September 16, President William McKinley issued secret written instructions to his emissaries as the Spanish–American War drew to a close:\n|sign=|source=}}\nNegotiations\nArticle V of the peace protocol between United States and Spain on August 12, 1898,[https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/spanishAmWar.html Major Events of the Spanish–American War - Topics in Chronicling America (Newspaper and Current Periodical Reading Room, Library of Congress)] read as follows:\n}}\nThe composition of the American commission was somewhat unusual in that three of its members were senators, which meant, as many newspapers pointed out, that they would later vote on the ratification of their own negotiations. These were American delegation's members:\n* William R. Day, chairman, who had resigned as U.S. Secretary of State to lead the commission\n* William P. Frye, a senator from Maine\n* Cushman Kellogg Davis, a senator from Minnesota\n* George Gray, a senator from Delaware\n* Whitelaw Reid, a former diplomat and a former nominee for Vice President\n, Secretary of State, signing the memorandum of ratification on behalf of the United States]]\nThe Spanish commission included the following Spanish diplomats:\n* Eugenio Montero Ríos,\n* Buenaventura de Abarzuza,\n* José de Garnica,\n* Wenceslao Ramírez de Villa-Urrutia,\n* Rafael Cerero, and\n* Jules Cambon (French diplomat).\nThe American delegation, headed by former Secretary of State William R. Day, who had vacated his position as U.S. Secretary of State to head the commission, arrived in Paris on September 26, 1898. The negotiations were conducted in a suite of rooms at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the first session, on October 1, the Spanish demanded that before the talks got underway, the return of the city of Manila, which had been captured by the Americans a few hours after the signing of the peace protocol in Washington, to Spanish authority. The Americans refused to consider the idea and, for the moment, it was pursued no further.\nFelipe Agoncillo, a Filipino lawyer who represented the First Philippine Republic, was denied participation in the negotiation.\nFor almost a month, negotiations revolved around Cuba. The Teller Amendment to the declaration of war made it impractical for the United States to annex the island as it had with Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. At first, Spain refused to accept the Cuban national debt of $400 million, but ultimately, it had no choice. Eventually, it was agreed that Cuba was to be granted independence and for the Cuban debt to be assumed by Spain. It was also agreed that Spain would cede Guam and Puerto Rico to the United States.\nThe negotiators then turned to the question of the Philippines. Spanish negotiators were determined to hang onto all they could and hoped to cede only Mindanao and perhaps the Sulu Islands. On the American side, Chairman Day had once recommended the acquisition of only the naval base in Manila, as a \"hitching post.\" Others had recommended retaining only the island of Luzon. However, in discussions with its advisers, the commission concluded that Spain, if it retained part of the Philippines, would be likely to sell it to another European power, which would likely be troublesome for America. On November 25, the American Commission cabled McKinley for explicit instructions. Their cable crossed one from McKinley saying that duty left him no choice but to demand the entire archipelago. The next morning, another cable from McKinley arrived:\n}}\nThis position was proposed by U.S. negotiators, though they considered it unsound, and was formally rejected on November 4. Spain was in distressed financial condition, and was responsible for considerable Cuban debt, having been sovereign when the debts were incurred. Estimating U.S. costs in the war at $300 million and regarding Porto Rico as worth only a fraction of that, the negotiators favored acquisition of the Philippines as indemnity for the balance. Seeking a solution to avoid collapse of the negotiations, Senator Frye suggested offering Spain $10 or $20 million, describing the purpose as the assumption of existing debts incurred for improvements of a pacific nature. The State Department approved, though it considered this odious. After some discussion, the American delegation offered $20 million today.}} on November 21, one tenth of a valuation that had been estimated in internal discussions in October, and requested an answer within two days. Montero Ríos said angrily that he could reply at once, but the American delegation had already departed from the conference table. When the two sides met again, Queen-Regent Maria Christina had cabled her acceptance. Montero Ríos then recited his formal reply:\n}}\nWork on the final draft of the treaty began on November 30. It was signed on December 10, 1898.\nRatification\nSpanish ratification\nIn Madrid, the Cortes Generales, Spain's legislature, rejected the treaty, but Maria Christina signed it as she was empowered to do by a clause in the Spanish constitution.\nU.S. ratification\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; width: 315px; float:right;\"\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|colspan=3 |George F. Hoar (MA-R) (left), Eugene Hale (ME-R) (center), and George G. Vest (MO-D) (right) led the opposition to the ratification of the Treaty of Paris within the Senate.\n|}\nIn the Senate, there were four main schools of thought on U.S. imperialism that influenced the debate on the treaty's ratification. Republicans generally supported the treaty, but those opposed either aimed to defeat the treaty or exclude the provision that stipulated the acquisition of the Philippines. Most Democrats, particularly in the South, opposed expansion. A minority of Democrats also favored the treaty on the basis of ending the war and granting independence to Cuba and the Philippines. During the Senate debate on ratification, Senators George Frisbie Hoar and George Graham Vest were outspoken opponents. Hoar stated:\n}}\nSome anti-expansionists stated that the treaty committed the United States to a course of empire and violated the most basic tenets of the constitution. They argued that neither the Congress nor the President had the right to pass laws that governed colonial peoples who were not represented by lawmakers.\nSome Senate expansionists supported the treaty and reinforced such views by arguing:\nExpansionists said that the Constitution applied only to citizens, an idea that was later supported by the Supreme Court in the Insular Cases.\nAs the Senate debate continued, Andrew Carnegie and former President Grover Cleveland petitioned the Senate to reject the treaty. Both men adamantly opposed such imperialist policies and participated in the American Anti-Imperialist League, along with other such prominent members as Mark Twain and Samuel Gompers.\nFighting erupted between Filipino and American forces in Manila on February 4, and quickly escalated into a battle between armies. This changed the course of debate in the Senate in favor of ratification. The treaty was eventually approved on February 6, 1899, by a vote of 57 to 27, just over the two-thirds majority required. Only two Republicans voted against ratification: George Frisbie Hoar of Massachusetts and Eugene Pryor Hale of Maine. Senator Nelson W. Aldrich had opposed entry into the Spanish–American War but supported McKinley after it began. He played a central role in winning the treaty's two-thirds majority ratification.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=7 style=\"background:#f5f5f5\" | Vote to pass the resolution to ratify the Treaty of Paris\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width: 9em;\" | February 6, 1899\n! colspan=5 | Party\n! rowspan=2 | Total votes\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n! | Democratic\n!  | Republican\n!  | Silver Republican\n!  | Populist\n!  | Silver\n|-\n| Yea\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 10\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 39\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 2\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 4\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 2\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 57\n|-\n| Nay\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 22\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 2\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 2\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 1\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 0\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 27\n|-\n| Not voting\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 2\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 3\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 1\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 0\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 0\n| style=\"background:#ffffff\" | 6\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"text-align:left;\" |Result:\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"background:#f9f7f0\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#f5f5f5\" | Roll call vote on ratification\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 170px;\"| Senator !!

Spain relinquished all claims of sovereignty over and title to Cuba. Upon Spain's departure, Cuba was to be occupied by the United States, which would assume and discharge any obligations of international law by its occupation.\nThe treaty also specified that Spain would cede Puerto Rico and the other islands under Spanish sovereignty in the West Indies as well as the island of Guam in the Mariana Islands to the United States.\nThe treaty also specified that Spain would cede the Philippine Islands, including the islands within a specified line, to the United States in exchange for $20 million.\nSpecifics of the cession of the Philippines were later clarified on November 7, 1900, when Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Washington. This clarified that the territories relinquished by Spain to the United States included any and all islands belonging to the Philippine Archipelago, but lying outside the lines described in the Treaty of Paris. That treaty explicitly named the islands of Cagayan Sulu and Sibutu and their dependencies as among the relinquished territories. The boundary between the Philippines and North Borneo was further clarified by the Convention Between the United States and Great Britain (1930).\nAftermath\nIn the United States\nVictory in the Spanish–American War turned the United States into a world power because the attainment of the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines expanded its economic dominance in the Pacific. Its growth continued to have effects on U.S. foreign and economic policy well into the next century. Furthermore, McKinley's significant role in advancing the ratification of the treaty transformed the presidential office from a weaker position to a prototype of the stronger presidency that is more seen today.\nIn Spain\nThe ''Generation of '98'' in Spain comprised those Spanish writers deeply impacted by the events and committed to cultural and aesthetic renewal. They were associated with modernism. The term refers to the moral, political and social crisis in Spain produced by the humiliating loss of the worldwide empire. The intellectuals are known for their criticism of the Spanish literary and educational establishments, which they saw as steeped in conformism, ignorance, and a lack of any true spirit. Their criticism was coupled with and heavily connected to the group's dislike for the Restoration Movement that was occurring in Spanish government.\nA few years after the war, during the reign of Alfonso XIII, Spain improved its commercial position and maintained close relations with the United States, which led to the signing of commercial treaties between the two countries in 1902, 1906 and 1910. Spain would turn its attention to its possessions in Africa (especially northern Morocco, Spanish Sahara and Spanish Guinea) and would begin to rehabilitate itself internationally after the Algeciras Conference of 1906.\nIn the Philippines\nPhilippine revolutionaries had declared independence from Spain on June 12, 1898, and continued to resist the imposition of American sovereignty. On August 12, 1898, representatives of Spain and the US concluded a peace protocol in Washington D.C., suspending hostilities.
