In 1740 A.D. Alivardi Khan became the Nawab Bengal Subah deposing Sarfaraz Khan in the Battle of Giria. Lutfullah Tabrizi also known as Rustam Jang and Murshid Quli II, the Deputy Governor of Odisha, refused to accept Alivardi's suzerainty. He sought to avenge his brother-in-law Sarfaraz Khan and asserted independence. This ensued conflict between the two and Alivardi's forces clashed with Lutfullah Tabrizi's in a battle in the plains of Phulwari. Faced with betrayals, and a fierce counterattack led by Mir Jafar, the battle ended in Lutfullah Tabrizi's defeat, the death of key commanders, and the severe wounding of his son-in-law Mirza Baqar, solidifying Alivardi's control over Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha.\nBackground\nAlivardi Khan then the governor of Bihar marched from Patna into Bengal, defeated and killed Sarfaraz Khan () at the Battle of Giria on 10 April 1740, and became the Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. Lutfullah Tabrizi, the son-in-law of Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan and Deputy Governor of Orissa (Odisha) refused to acknowledge the authority of Alivardi Khan. At first he tried to make an agreement with Alivardi. His wife Dardana Begam persuaded him to avenge her half-brother Sarfaraz’s death. Subsequently he declared independence.\nPrelude\nLutfullah Tabrizi left his wife Dardana Bagum and son Yahya Khan at the with all his wealth at the fort of Barabati. In December 1740, he marched from Cuttack with his two sons-in-law, Mirza Baqar Khan and Allauddin Muhammad Khan. Crossing Balasore he reached at the plains of Phulwari}} and encamped there, forming a round circle of 300 cannons around the tents.\nOn hearing of Lutfullah Tabrizi's advance, Alivardi started from Murshidabad in January 1741 with his nephew, Sayyid Ahmad alias Saulat Jung, at the head of 10,000 or 12,000 cavalry, into Orissa. Ghulam Husain Salim writes Alivardi’s army made of 100,000 cavalry and infantry. According to Madla Panji, Alivardi the number is 500 elephants, 4,000 cavalry and one lakh infantry. The figures are over exaggerated.\nMarching to Midnapore, Alivardi reached to Jalasore. There he crossed the Subarnarekha River and encamped at Ramachandrapur, three miles near the plains of Phulwari. Despite being near Lutfullah Tabrizi's camp, Alivardi could not attack due to severe provisions shortage caused by Midnapore zamindars failure to supply as the zamindars of Orissa who were loyal to Lutfullah Tabrizi intercepted the supplies. In the meantime, Maratha bargis raided his camp. Alivardi being pressed decided to make peace with Lutfullah Tabrizi, but Alivardi's general Mustafa Khan advised entrenching through the rains and renewing the campaign afterward.\nBattle\nConflicts erupted when Mirza Baqar, instigated by Abed Khan sallied forth from his camp a contingent composed of Barha Sayyid soldiers and launched an assault on Alivardi's forces. In the initial onslaught, Alivardi captured the entirety of Lutfullah Tabrizi's artillery, which had been left inadequately guarded due to Mirza Baqer's early assault. Lutfullah Tabrizi came out to help Mirza Baqer. Despite the significant loss, Lutfullah Tabrizi, Mirza Baqar, and their troops fought vigorously which forced portion of the Bengal soldiers to flee the battlefield, leaving their commander on the brink of defeat. Alivardi was pushed two miles away from the battlefield. Seeing Alivardi in distress, Manikchand, peshkar of the Raja of Burdwan, secretly offered to join Lutfullah Tabrizi's side with his troops for personal safety, but Mirza Baqar, suspecting his sincerity, opposed the proposal.\nLutfullah Tabrizi gained the upper hand on the battlefield but faced betrayal from his generals.  Abed Khan entered into a secret agreement with Mustafa Khan, Alivardi's commander. Pretending to launch an attack on the enemy, Abed Khan advanced with his soldiers, only to defect to the opposing side. This betrayal was soon followed by similar actions from several other army officers, including Mukhlis Ali Khan, Muqarrab Khan, and a number of Afghan generals.\nUndeterred by these defections, Mirza Baqar launched a swift and forceful assault on the left wing of Alivardi's army, which was under the command of veteran generals such as Mir Jafar and Qasim Ali Khan. This sudden attack initially caused great disorder and confusion among the Bengal forces. Mir Jafar, however, promptly mounted a gallant resistance, counterattacking Baqer's troops and coming to the aid of Alivardi's defeated generals, including Musaheb Khan, Dilir Khan, and Aslat Khan. This action greatly inspired Alivardi's soldiers, who renewed their assault on the enemy. Lutfullah Tabrizi's generals Mujtaba Ali, Mir Ali Akbar, and Mir Abdul Aziz was slain alongside 300 Sayyid soldiers. Mirza Baqar was wounded seriously and was carried from the battlefield in a palanquin. The army abandoned the fight. Lutfullah Tabrizi fled for his safety. Thus Alivardi gained victory in the battle of Phulwari.\nAftermath\nAlivardi successfully captured Cuttack and appointed Sayyid Ahmad Khan alias Saulat Jung, his second son-in-law as the Deputy Governor of Orissa Alivardi dispatched Mirza Khairullah Beg to capture Dardana Bagum and Yahya Khan. Ramchandradeva II of Khurdah, loyal to Lutfullah Tabrizi dispatched his general Murad Khan. Mirza Khairullah Beg seized Lutfullah Tabrizi's treasure but his family fled.\nSee also\n* Battle of Giria\n* Battle of Katwa\n* Battle of Rani Sarai\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
