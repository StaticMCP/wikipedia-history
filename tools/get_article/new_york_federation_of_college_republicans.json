      "text": "# New York Federation of College Republicans\n\nThe New York Federation of College Republicans, also known as the NYFCR, is an organization that oversees College Republicans chapters across the state of New York. The NYFCR and its chapters are made up of college and university students who support the Republican Party of the United States. In 2021, the NYFCR withdrew from the College Republican National Committee. The NYFCR now functions as a collaborative organization, and is affiliated with different Republican and conservative groups in New York state, including the New York Republican State Committee, the New York State Young Republicans, and the New York Young Republican Club.\nThe executive board of NYFCR is made up of ten positions headed by a chairperson. The current chairman of the organization is Steven Margolis from Baruch College.\nOn July 13 of the same year the NYFCR published a dossier alleging that then-chairman Chandler Thornton had been mismanaging the CRNC's funds. The report cited the CRNC's advertising budget, which showed more than $1,000,000 in funds unaccounted for. Uncertainty over the fate of a $122,000 donation from Kid Rock also became a point of contention. Finally, on July 24, the university chapters of the NYFCR voted unanimously to withdraw from the CRNC.\nOn February 14th 2024, the New York Federation of College Republicans officially chartered with the College Republicans of America (CRA), re-entering the state into the chartering of a national organization.\nReferences"
