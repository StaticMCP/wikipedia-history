Board members are independent professional journalists, boxing historians and record keepers from around the world.  Their rankings and titles are meant to be uninfluenced by promoters and the traditional sanctioning bodies.\nTBRB championships\nThe TBRB awards championships when the top-ranked fighters in any division meet, and currently recognizes legitimate world champions or \"true&nbsp;champions\" in each weight class. It also presents the \"successions\" of these championship \"thrones.\"\nThree of its recognized champions were identified by The Ring magazine before the TBRB was founded. Thus, the TBRB was formed to continue where The Ring \"left off\" in the aftermath of the latter's purchase by Golden Boy Promotions in 2007, and the following dismissal of the editorial board headed by Nigel Collins. After the new editors announced a controversial new championship policy in May 2012, three members of the Ring Advisory Panel resigned. These three members (Springs Toledo, Cliff Rold and Tim Starks) became the founding members of the TBRB, which was formed over the summer of 2012 with the assistance of Stewart Howe of England.\nESPN boxing analyst and commentator Teddy Atlas praised the TBRB's efforts on-air in March 2013 and again during the season finale in August 2013.\nBritish magazine Boxing News announced in 2021 that it would only recognize world champions as voted by the TBRB.\nTBRB Voting Panel members\nThere are currently members representing 21 countries on five continents: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, England, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United States, Vietnam, and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\nSuccessions\nThe following are the lineal champions recognized by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board:\nHeavyweight\n* Oleksandr Usyk W12  Anthony Joshua (20 August 2022 – Usyk and Joshua were the top two Transnational-Ranked heavyweights at the time of this bout.
