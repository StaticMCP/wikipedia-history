Typically such recordings are of artists and performances that were particularly notable at the time they were first released, or were unavailable because they were private recordings made at concerts or radio broadcasts. The latter can be of rather high quality if the recording derives from tapes made and archived by the broadcaster or the organization mounting the performance.\nRecordings issued by arts organizations\nImportant sources of historical recordings are the broadcast archives of orchestras and opera companies. For instance, the Met Opera of New York has issued a number of historical broadcast recordings which are only available upon making a donation. In the late 1980s, the [http://www.metoperafamily.org/guild/ Metropolitan Opera Guild] issued a large number of two-disc compilations of historical recordings called Great Operas at the Met. Each album featured recorded performances of arias from a particular opera, generally beginning in the early 20th century and continuing up into the early stereo era.\nThe Boston Symphony Orchestra issued a 12-CD box entitled Boston Symphony Orchestra Symphony Hall Centennial Celebration: From the Broadcast Archives 1943-2000 in the 1980s. These recordings are now available for download from the orchestra's web site.\nMajor label reissues\nMany of the major record labels have also reissued important historical recordings. For example, Philips Records issued a 200-CD series of recordings entitled Great Pianists of the 20th Century in 1999.\nRecord labels specializing in historic recordings\nThere are a number of record labels that have primarily issued historic classical recordings or have treated them as an important category.\nExamples include:\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120911013330/http://www.arbiterrecords.com/catalog.html Arbiter Records].\n* Centaur Records\n* Fonit Cetra\n* Golden Melodram\n* Harmonia Mundi\n* Hunt\n* Laudis\n* Legato Classics\n* Marston Records\n* Music & Arts\n* Pearl\n* [http://www.78rpm.net/cd/index.html Sakuraphon].\n* Standing Room Only\n* Symposium Cds.\n* Testament Records\n* Verona\nRecordings made and shared privately by clubs, internet groups, blogs, and other aficionado-run free forums\nRecordings made from radio and internet broadcasts, in-house personal microphones and recording devices, and from performer's earpiece monitor transmissions are archived and disseminated in various ways. This kind of documentation of live performance is also known as a Recording Of Indeterminate Origin, or ROIO. Many blogs, clubs, internet groups and other forums exist whose members contribute and receive ROIOs, many of which have never been available commercially. Most of these forums traffic in non-commercially available broadcast/other classical music recordings for free. Historic recordings that begin as freely traded ROIOs often surface later as commercial products.\nGrammy Awards\nThe Grammy Awards have included a category for Best Historical Album since 1979, which does not distinguish between classical and non-classical albums.
