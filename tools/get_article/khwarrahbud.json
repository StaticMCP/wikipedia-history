Captured by the Romans and sent to stay in their territory, Khwarrahbud wrote a book on the accomplishments of Shapur II and Julian, and also learned Greek. He made a Greek translation of a Middle Persian book written by Rāstsakhwan, one of his captive associates. The 6th-century Roman historian Agathias later used this book.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
