It sought to \"struggle for the formation of a Communist International of a new type, based on Marxism–Leninism–Maoism\". The RIM appears to be defunct as are many of the founding organizations. The Revolutionary Communist Party, USA was the most powerful force within the RIM.\nIdeology\nFrom 1993 onwards the RIM believed that the experience gained from the \"People's War\" in Peru enabled the International Communist Movement \"to further deepen [their] grasp of the proletarian ideology and on that basis take a far-reaching step, the recognition of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism as the new, third and higher stage of Marxism\". This formulation caused a split in the Maoist movement, with the continued adherents of Mao Zedong Thought leaving RIM and congregating around the International Conference of Marxist–Leninist Parties and Organizations.\nMembers\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Country\n!English name\n!Native name\n!Abbreviation\n|-\n|\n|Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan\n|حزب كمونيست (مائوئيست) افغانستان\n|C(M)PA\n|-\n|\n|Proletarian Party of East Bengal\n|পূর্ব বাংলার সর্বহারা পার্টি\n|PBSP\n|-\n|\n|Revolutionary Communist Party\n|Partido Comunista Revolucionario\n|PCR\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|Revolutionary Communist Group of Colombia\n|Grupo Comunista Revolucionario de Colombia\n|RCGC\n|-\n|Communist Party of Colombia (Marxist–Leninist), Mao Tsetung Regional Committee\n|Partido Comunista de Colombia (marxista-leninista), Comité Regional Mao Tsetung\n|CPC(ML)MTRC\n|-\n|\n|Revolutionary Communist Union\n|Unión Comunista Revolucionaria\n|RCU\n|-\n|\n|Haitian Revolutionary Internationalist Group\n|Gwoup Entènasyonalis Revolisyonè Ayisyen\n|GRIA\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|Central Reorganisation Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist)\n|केंद्रीय पुनर्गठन समिति, भारतीय कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी (मार्क्सवादी-लेनिनवादी)\n|CRC, CPI(ML)\n|-\n|Leading Committee, Revolutionary Communist Party, India\n|अग्रणी समिति, क्रांतिकारी कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी, भारत\n|LC, RCP\n|-\n|\n|Union of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran)\n|اتحادیه کمونیست‌های ایران\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|Communist Collective of Agit/Prop\n|Collettivo Comunista Agit/Prop\n|CCA/P\n|-\n|Proletarian Communist Organisation, Marxist–Leninist\n|Organizzazione Comunista Proletaria, Marxista-Leninista\n|PCO, ML\n|-\n|\n|Communist Party of Nepal (Masal)\n|नेपाल कम्युनिष्ट पार्टी (मसाल)\n|CPN(M)\n|-\n|\n|colspan=\"2\"|New Zealand Red Flag Group\n|NZFLG\n|-\n|\n|Communist Party of Peru\n|Partido Comunista del Perú\n|PCP\n|-\n|\n|Ceylon Communist Party (Maoist)\n|ලංකා කොමියුනිස්ට් පක්ෂය (මාඕවාදී)\nசிலோன் கம்யூனிஸ்ட் கட்சி (மாவோயிஸ்ட்)\n|CPC(M)\n|-\n|\n|Communist Party of Turkey/Marxist–Leninist\n|Türkiye Komünist Partisi/Marksist-Leninist\n|TKP/ML\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|colspan=\"2\"|Nottingham Communist Group\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\"|Stockport Communist Group\n|\n|-\n|\n|colspan=\"2\"|Revolutionary Communist Party, USA\n|RCP\n|}\nThe Communist Party of Nepal (Masal) left over differences of political line, but a much larger group, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), is a member. Indian member organizations amalgamated into the Communist Party of India (Maoist).\nMagazine\nA World to Win was published from 1981 to 2006 as the unofficial magazine of the Committee of RIM (CoRIM). Communist Party of India (Maoist) leader Ajith (Murali Kannampilly) was the editor of the magazine.\nCriticism\nThe Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist–Leninist) has criticized the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement (RIM) for what it perceives as ultra-left revisionism, characterized by dogmatism and sectarianism. The party contends that RIM's neglect of critical Maoist concepts, such as the mass line and the theory of the new democratic revolution, alongside a focus on Eurocentrism, detracts from the effectiveness of the global revolutionary movement. This criticism points to RIM's strategies as being out of step with the practical demands of revolutionary activity, especially in the context of the Third World's class struggle.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.org/download/DeclarationOfTheRevolutionaryInternationalistMovement_292/DeclarationOfTheRevolutionaryInternationalistMovement_292.pdf Declaration of the Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]\n*[http://revcom.us/s/corim.htm RIM map and Committee of the RIM (CoRIM) statements]"
