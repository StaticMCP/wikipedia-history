He worked as a legal clerk.\nCareer\nAfter playing for Aberdeen, Davidson was signed by Middlesbrough manager Tom Mcintosh on 17 April 1913 for a fee of £675. He played 76 league games across two seasons prior to the outbreak of World War One. During the war, Davidson played as a wartime guest player for Manchester City, and although wounded during the war, was able to continue his football career after the end of the war in 1918. He became Middlesbrough club captain in 1920, and earned his first and only cap for Scotland against England in 1921.\nIn summer 1923, Davidson was deemed surplus to requirements at Middlesbrough and returned to his former club Aberdeen. He was later player-manager of Forres Mechanics and coached for the Kent F.A., before became assistant manager to ex-teammate Billy Birrell at Chelsea from 1939 to 1957.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! colspan=\"3\" |League\n! colspan=\"2\" |Scottish Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" |Aberdeen\n|1905–06\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Scottish Division One\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|1906–07\n|4\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|1907–08\n|7\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|1\n|-\n|1908–09\n|8\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|8\n|0\n|-\n|1909–10\n|19\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|20\n|0\n|-\n|1910–11\n|7\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|11\n|0\n|-\n|1911–12\n|24\n|0\n|5\n|0\n|29\n|0\n|-\n|1912–13\n|31\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|32\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!101\n!1\n!11\n!0\n!112\n!1\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Middlesbrough\n|1913–14\n| rowspan=\"2\" |First Division\n|30\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|31\n|1\n|-\n|1914–15\n|36\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|37\n|0\n|-\n|1915–16\n| colspan=\"7\" |Official English football disrupted by the First World War\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!66\n!1\n!2\n!0\n!68\n!1\n|-\n|Aberdeen (loan)\n|1916–17\n|Scottish Division One\n|3\n|0\n| -\n| -\n|3\n|0\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |Middlesbrough\n|1917–18\n| colspan=\"7\" rowspan=\"2\" |Official English football disrupted by the First World War\n|-\n|1918–19\n|-\n|1919–20\n| rowspan=\"4\" |First Division\n|42\n|1\n|2\n|0\n|44\n|1\n|-\n|1920–21\n|37\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|38\n|0\n|-\n|1921–22\n|41\n|2\n|1\n|0\n|42\n|2\n|-\n|1922–23\n|22\n|0\n|2\n|0\n|24\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!142\n!3\n!6\n!0\n!148\n!3\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Aberdeen\n|1923–24\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Scottish Division One\n|26\n|0\n|6\n|0\n|32\n|0\n|-\n|1924–25\n|6\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|6\n|0\n|-\n|1925–26\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!32\n!0\n!6\n!0\n!38\n!0\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Aberdeen total\n!136\n!1\n!17\n!0\n!153\n!1\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Middlesbrough total\n!208\n!4\n!8\n!0\n!216\n!4\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!344\n!5\n!25\n!0\n!369\n!5\n|}\nInternational\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Appearances and goals by national team and year\n!National team\n!Year\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n|Scotland\n|1921\n|1\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!1\n!0\n|}\nReferences"
