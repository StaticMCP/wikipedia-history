In the , the locality of Agnes Water had a population of 2,729.\nGeography\nAgnes Water is in Central Queensland approximately  south-east of the Bruce Highway, Queensland's major coastal route. It is accessed via the main road called Round Hill Road. It is 90 minutes south of Gladstone, and 90 minutes north of Bundaberg on the Discovery Coast. Agnes Water is the closest access point to the Great Barrier Reef. It is a neighbouring town of the Town of 1770.\nMuch of the area's natural beauty has been preserved through the establishment of Eurimbula National Park, covering more than 23,000 hectares and the nearby Joseph Banks Environmental Park, located on the headland originally known as Round Head.\nHistory\nPrior to European settlement Agnes Water was home to the Meerooni tribe who form the southern part of the Gurang nation.\nThe town of Agnes Water takes its name from pastoral holding first leased by Daniel Clowes in 1883, which he named after the coastal schooner Agnes, which was lost at sea in the area. The schooner left Bustard Head on 15 June 1873, en route from Mackay to Brisbane. Daniel Clowes remained there until his death in 1891. The gravestones of Clowes and his wife are near the present township.\nThere was saw milling in the locality in the 1890s and the wide beach was a popular venue, particularly as buggies could be driven onto the beach. It became a holiday destination, and weekend residences were built, notably on Round Hill where the Town of 1770 was officially named in 1936. The population grew slowly initially but gained momentum in the 1980s and 1990s driven by the \"sea change\" phenomenon.\nAgnes Water State School was opened on 29 January 1990.\nAgnes Tavern  opened in 1993.\nMango Tree Motel Agnes Water opened in April 1982\nThe current Agnes Water Public Library opened in 2011 and had a minor refurbishment in 2016.\nDiscovery Christian College opened in 2015.\nGoora Gan Steiner School opened in January 2017.\nIn 2018, Agnes Water became the first cryptocurrency town. Shops, hotels accept cryptocurrency - Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and NEM. Businesses were persuaded to accept cryptocurrency payments due to the belief that cryptocurrency users would be high net-worth customers likely to spend more on goods and services and that  establishing point-of-sale terminals that accepted cryptocurrencies was easy to do at low cost. There was also seen to be value in the publicity the town would receive for being the first cryptocurrency town. A review in 2023 showed that tourists did make use of cryptocurrency payments in the first six months, thought to be linked to the novelty of doing so due to the publicity. However, use of cryptocurrency payments fell after that. Some of the explanations put forward  are that high-net worth customers were not attracted to the town due to a lack of luxury accommodation and high-end tourism services, that accepting cryptocurrency is not a major consideration in choosing a holiday destination as tourists who use cryptocurrency also have other methods of making payments, and that the volatility of cryptocurrency make tourists reluctant to pay using crypocurrency, particularly in a falling market preferring to hold the cryptocurrency in the expectation of subsequent rise in value.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Agnes Water had a population of 1,814 people.
