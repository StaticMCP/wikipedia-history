He went to Imperial College where he was awarded a second class degree in chemistry in 1920. In 1916, at the age of 20, he enlisted in the Royal Engineers as a Pioneer and served until he was discharged, September 1918, when he was appointed Temporary Second Lieutenant in the Royal Garrison Artillery.\nHe first worked at Harper Adams College but in 1923 he moved to Mauritius where he worked as a chemistry teacher at the Royal College Curepipe. His interest in botany developed and from 1934 he collaborated with Paul Octave Wiehe on botanical exploration and conservative, seeing the creation of 16 nature reserves between 1951 and 1974, and in 1959 the creation of the Mauritius Herbarium. The herbarium collection moved from Pamplemousses to Réduit, within the Mauritius Sugar Industry Research Institute (MSIRI) which he had created, with Wiehe, in 1946. He was director of the Mauritius Institute from 1946 to 1960. He was the curator of the Herbarium from 1960 until 1969, when he retired. Together with Joseph Guého, his assistant, he added to the collections in the herbarium. He continued to work on the flora and helped initiate the Flore des Mascareignes project.\nDuring World War II from 1943 he worked as the chief censor for the Bureau of Information.\nHe was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society on 8 December 1932, obtained his Ph.D. in 1934 from the University of London and later a D.Sc.

He is recorded returning to England in 1932, 1936, and 1940, accompanied by Phyllis, on his own in 1944, and then with Elsie in 1949.\nHe died in Mauritius on 29 April 1987.\nAlbizia vaughanii Brenan, Eugenia vaughanii J.Guého & A.J.Scott, Syzygium vaughanii J.Guého & A.J.Scott, Croton vaughanii Croizat, Hyophorbe vaughanii L.H.Bailey, Myonima vaughanii Verdc., are some of the species named in his honour.\nThe RE Vaughan Building, MSIRI Compound, Reduit, Mauritius is named after him.\nSelected publications\nStudies on the Vegetation of Mauritius: I.
