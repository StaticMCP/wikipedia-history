The division was formed in May 1915 as \"Division Beckmann\" (named for its commander, Max Beckmann) and became the 108th Infantry Division on November 7, 1915.  It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in 1915.  The division was disbanded in September 1918 and its assets distributed to other units.\nThe division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions which were being triangularized.  The division's 97th Infantry Regiment came from the 42nd Infantry Division; the 137th Infantry Regiment came from the 31st Infantry Division; and the 265th Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 80th Reserve Division.\nCombat chronicle\nThe 108th Infantry Division initially served on the Eastern Front, serving in the Baltic region until June 1916.  It then went south to the front in Ukraine on the Styr River where it faced the Brusilov Offensive and then remained in the line until the armistice on the Eastern Front in December 1917.  The division was then sent to the Western Front, entering the line north of the Ailette River, where it remained until April 1918.  It then fought in the Somme region until it was dissolved on September 19, 1918.  Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.\nOrder of battle on formation\nThe 108th Infantry Division was formed as a triangular division.  The order of battle of the division on October 3, 1915, was as follows:\n*5. Infanterie-Brigade\n**1. Oberrheinisches Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 97\n**2.
