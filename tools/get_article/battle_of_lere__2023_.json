Malian and Wagner forces attacked the town of Ber in August 2023, the first major clashes between the two groups since the signing of the Algiers Accords in 2015. CSP-PSD spokesmen denounced the attack, and stated that retaliation would occur. They then attacked Malian forces in Bourem a few weeks later, with both sides declaring victory. Following the attack on Bourem, the CSp_PSD declared war on the Malian junta.\nBattle\nAt 1:30 local time on September 17, CSP-PSD fighters attacked two Malian military camps in Léré, Tombouctou Region, Mali. Fighting lasted for two hours, and the CSP-PSD seized both military camps in the town. RFI claimed that the CSP-PSD had also effectively seized control of the town of Lere during the battle, but journalist Wassim Nasr rebutted this and stated that Malian soldiers had sought refuge in the town center after the capture of their bases, and that the CSP-PSD did not enter the town. The CSP-PSD retreated from the bases between 2 and 3am on September 18, leaving with lots of weaponry and Malian equipment.\nAftermath\nThe day after the battle, the Malian junta denounced an attack by \"evil forces\" against the military camps at Lere and promised retribution. Later that night, the Malian Army published a statement reporting the deaths of five Malian soldiers, twenty injured, and eleven missing. The Malian Army also estimated that eight CSP-PSD vehicles were destroyed with thirty men killed or injured, but stated that they only found the bodies of seven militants within the camps boundaries.\nThe CSP-PSD claimed the deaths of thirty-five Malian soldiers during the battle, along with six taken prisoner, several dozen injured, several vehicles captured, and a large number of weapons and equipment seized. They also stated eight fighters were killed and twelve were wounded. The CSP-PSD published several videos and photos of the attack on social media during and after the battle. They also claimed the destruction of a Malian L-39 Albatros plane above the city with photographic evidence, and claimed that another plane was damaged and eventually crashed. The Malian Army only acknowledged the downing of one plane due to technical issues, and stated its crew was still being sought out.\nReferences"
