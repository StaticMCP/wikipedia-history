He is the 4th and incumbent President of Russia; previously he was the 33rd Prime Minister of Russia, 2nd President of Russia and 4th Federal Security Service Director.\nThis campaign is his fourth. Prior to this he successfully participated in elections in 2000, 2004 and 2012.\nVladimir Putin had consistently scored higher than 40% in opinion polls since the last presidential election. According to an opinion poll conducted in December 2017 by Gallup International, if Putin was not to be on the ballot, 46% wouldn't have known for whom to vote and 19% would have made the ballot paper invalid. Putin was re-elected as the President of the Russian Federation on 18 March 2018.\nBackground\nPutin became the President in 2012. According to the Constitution of Russia he is entitled to another re-election. Until December 2017 it was not clear whether Putin would seek re-election or not. Some political analysts believed that Putin was not going to run, which is why he refused to answer questions about his nomination. Some named Governor of Tula Oblast Alexey Dyumin as Putin's successor. Others, on the contrary, believed that Putin would participate in the elections, but would announce it as late as possible in order to conduct a short campaign.\nAnnouncement\nIt was assumed that Putin would announce his nomination on 14 December 2017, during his annual press conference. However, at the beginning of December 2017, some experts said that Putin would announce his participation in the elections on 6 December, during the Volunteer of Russia 2017 awards. Putin's press Secretary Dmitry Peskov, commenting on these reports said that Putin could announce the nomination any day. On 6 December, after the presentation of awards, Putin declined to answer the question about participation in the elections, saying that in the near future he will decide on whether to participate in the election. A few hours later, speaking to the workers of the GAZ automobile plant, Putin announced that he will again run for president.\nNomination\non 19 December 2017]]\nIn the 2012 election, Putin was nominated by the United Russia party, which he led at the time. Putin announced that he will run as an independent on 14 December 2017 during his annual press conference.  This is the third time he will run as an independent. He will have to collect at least 300,000 signatures in his support, only then will he be admitted to the election.\nThe official nomination of Putin took place at a meeting of his initiative group on 26 December 2017. The initiative group included 668 people, among them the former Minister of Economics Alexander Shokhin, hockey player Alexander Karelin, Moscow State University rector Viktor Sadovnichy, Director of Bakulev Scientific Center of Cardiovascular Surgery Leo Boqueria, Senator and Secretary-General of United Russia Andrey Turchak, the President of Support of Russia Alexander Kalinin, co-founder of Kaspersky Lab Natalya Kaspersky, leader of the party A Just Russia Sergey Mironov, as well as members of the State Duma and senators.\nCampaign\nOn 27 December 2017, Putin submitted documents for participation in the elections to the Central Election Commission. On 28 December, the CEC registered the initiative group and allowed him to start collecting signatures.\nCollection of signatures\nOn 5 January 2018, signatures started being collected in support of Putin. It was necessary to collect from 300,000 to 315,000 signatures to be admitted to the elections. In each subject of the Russian Federation it was necessary to collect no more than 7,500 signatures.\nBy 12 January Putin had gathered the required number of signatures, and even exceeded this number by almost 100,000. Putin's staff decided to continue collecting signatures. In total the campaign gathered more than 1.5 million signatures, of which around 315,000 were submitted to the CEC on 29 January.\nBy 2 February they had been verified - only 232 signatures were deemed invalid.\nVisits and campaign\nOn 7 February Putin visited Krasnoyarsk. Although it was officially a work trip many believe it was linked to his campaign. His visit was linked to the preparation to the Universaide, which will be held in the winter of 2019. Before addressing the issue he visited the multi-functional sports center Sopka. During the meeting concerning the issue Putin noted that Russia \"without a doubt remains a leader in international sport\" - this was the year before Russia was banned from international sport (see Doping in Russia). Next he went to a council concerning ecological problems. Near the end of his visit he entered the sport watching complex Platinum Arena Krasnoyarsk, where he took photos with training hockey players and met with the three players of the youth team Totem. To conclude his visit he inspected the new terminal of the aeroport Yemelyanovo.\nOn 8 February President Putin visited Novosibirsk. The main topic for the visit was the scientific potential of the state. He met with members of SO RAN and congratulated them with the day of science. He visited the nuclear science institute Budker. He met with Andrey Travnikov, who is Acting Governor of Novosibirsk Oblast. He was present at the meeting of the council for education and science, where he revealed a few details of the speech he would give to the Federal Assembly.\nDuring his campaign he refused to take part in any presidential debates personally like he did in previous ones in 2000, 2004 and 2012, citing his spokesman, being \"too busy\". Though he was presented by his representative and his most presidential campaign is done by his trusted figures.\n.]]\nOn 3 March, in Moscow at the Luzhniki stadium held a rally in support of Vladimir Putin. In total, more than 130,000 people came to the rally. The rally was made by confidants of Putin, among whom were star athletes, figures of culture and science. Speaking at the meeting, Vladimir Putin said: \"We want to make our country bright, looking forward to the future, because our ancestors lived here, we live, our children live and our children and grandchildren will live. We will do everything to make them happy. For us and apart from us no one else will. But if we do this, the next 10 years, the entire XXI century will be marked by our bright victories. We'll do it!\".\nOn 14 March, Vladimir Putin spoke at a rally in Sevastopol to mark the anniversary of the Crimean status referendum.\nOn 18 March, Vladimir Putin voted in the presidential election. He voted at a traditional polling station located in the building of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nHiding the pension reform plan\nShortly after Putin’s re-election, the appointed Russian government  released the plan of the pension reform involving a substantial increase of the national retirement age; in October 2018 Putin signed the corresponding bill into law. However, during the presidential campaign, nothing was said by Putin on this subject — so that Russian citizens would not expect any changes in this socially-sensitive area. Moreover, for many years Putin promised not to hike the retirement age, and in several articles published by Russian media before the election, the existence of any intentions to change the pension age until 2030 were denied.\nIn the aftermath, more than 60% of Russians interpreted his silence as a trick aimed at securing victory in the election, which would have been questionable if he had presented his plan in advance. All this has severely affected Putin’s reputation, Forbes estimated the whole story as cynical and heavily compromising the leader of the nation.\nEndorsements\nParties supporting Putin's presidential bid\nThe following political parties support Putin in the election:\n*Cities of Russia\n*Civic Platform\n*Civilian Power\n*Great Fatherland Party\n*Greens\n*Labor Party\n*Party for Fairness!\n*Party of Free Citizens\n*Party of Pensioners\n*Patriots of Russia\n*Rodina\n*United Russia\n*Women's Dialogue\n}}\nPutinTeam\nThe PutinTeam movement was created by ice hockey player Alexander Ovechkin on 2 November 2017 in support of Vladimir Putin.\nIn addition to Ovechkin, the PutinTeam movement also includes many Russian sportspeople, actors, musicians and social activists: Evgeni Malkin, Yelena Isinbayeva, Sergey Karjakin, Sergey Tetyukhin, Nikolay Rastorguyev, Polina Gagarina, Ilya Kovalchuk, Nyusha, Andrey Merzlikin, Pavel Bure, Evgeni Plushenko, Nikolay Baskov, Sergei Krikalev, Mikhail Galustyan and others.
