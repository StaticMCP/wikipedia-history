It was established in 1912 by engineer Alfred Ackermann-Teubner and was an endowment of the University of Leipzig.\nIt was awarded 14 times between 1914 and 1941. Subsequent awards were to be made every other year until a surplus of 60,000 marks was accumulated within the endowment, at which time, the prize was to be awarded annually. The subjects included:\n* History, philosophy, teaching\n* Mathematics, especially arithmetic and algebra\n* Mechanics\n* Mathematical physics\n* Mathematics, especially analysis\n* Astronomy and theory of errors\n* Mathematics, especially geometry\n* Applied mathematics, especially geodesy and geophysics.\nHonorees\nThe fifteen honorees between 1914 and 1941 are:\n* 1914: Felix Klein\n* 1916: Ernst Zermelo, prize of 1,000 marks\n* 1918: Ludwig Prandtl\n* 1920: Gustav Mie\n* 1922: Paul Koebe\n* 1924: Arnold Kohlschütter\n* 1926: Wilhelm Blaschke\n* 1928: Albert Defant\n* 1930: Johannes Tropfke\n* 1932: Emmy Noether and Emil Artin, co-honorees\n* 1934: Erich Trefftz(de)\n* 1937: Pascual Jordan\n* 1938: Erich Hecke\n* 1941: Paul ten Bruggencate\nJurists\nIn 1937, Constantin Carathéodory and Erhard Schmidt were invited to jury the award.  Along with Wilhelm Blaschke, Carathéodory was invited again in 1944 by the German Union of Mathematicians.\nSee also\n* List of mathematics awards\nReferences"
