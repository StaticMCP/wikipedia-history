Sometimes worn by dancers to warm up their bodies before class, they have also become a fashion item, popular in the fall.\nArm warmers can also describe any glove-like articles of clothing that lack finger coverings and/or were originally designed to keep wrists and lower arms warm. Today, many competition and sport bicyclists as well as distance runners/marathoners wear spandex-compression arm-warmers.\nHistory\nof a person wearing striped arm warmers.]]\nVarious sub-cultures, such as the punk, emo, scene and goth subcultures, have also adopted arm warmers as a fashion statement. Stores such as Hot Topic sell arm warmers with chains and designs of skulls, piano keys, band logos, and other alternative inspired designs.\nSports\nwearing running sleeves in Taipei, 2016.]]\nSleeves made from Spandex or Lycra are used by long-distance runners and other endurance athletes. The compressive effect prevents swelling of the arm muscles and the build-up of lactic acid; they also provide insulation in cold weather and solar ultraviolet protection. During 2010 FIFA World Cup, arm warmers featuring the participating national teams became a phenomenon in the host country South Africa and abroad.\nSee also\n*Engageante\n*Evening glove\n*Gloves\n*Leg warmer\nReferences\nfr:Gant#Moufle ou mitaine"
