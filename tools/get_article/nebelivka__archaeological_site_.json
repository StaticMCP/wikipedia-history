The settlement was for the time huge, covering an area of 260-300 hectares. It was the home to perhaps 15,000 to 17,000 people.\nThe settlement within the boundary ditch includes over 1200 structures. Research from 20122014 implies \"the possibility of state-level societies\", contemporary with similar developments in Uruk. Mega-structures \"suggest the presence of public buildings for meetings or ceremonies\".\nTemple\nA two-storey structure  of mud and wood with a galleried courtyard has been excavated. Its structure and contents indicate it was a major temple. Artefacts include female or Venus figurines, pottery stylised faces, charred bones of animals, and small gold pieces that were perhaps hair or clothing ornaments. It has eight clay platforms, perhaps altars, and the floors and walls of all five rooms on the upper floor were \"decorated by red paint, which created [a] ceremonial atmosphere.\"\nFile:Cucuteni-trypillian temple.jpg|Nebelivka temple, reconstruction.\nFile:Nebelivka megastructure, reconstruction.jpg|Nebelivka temple, reconstruction.\nFile:Nebelivka.jpg|Nebelivka settlement ground plan\nReferences\nSources\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.trypillia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=141:the-new-project-started-early-urbanism-in-prehistoric-europe&catid=60:archaeology&Itemid=72 The New Project Started: Early Urbanism in Europe?] at the Trypillian Civilization Journal website"
