Adventists have impacted world eating habits in the breakfast and health food areas.\nOne author wrote, \"popular culture hasn’t often been very kind to Adventists.\"\nRepresentation in cinema\nThe movie Evil Angels (released as A Cry in the Dark outside of Australia and New Zealand) portrays the events surrounding the death of Azaria Chamberlain, the daughter of Seventh-day Adventist Church pastor Michael Chamberlain and his wife Lindy. Lindy is falsely accused and convicted of killing the nine-week-old baby, and the public's unfamiliarity with of the practices of the religion are shown as one of the causes of public opinion turning against the Chamberlains.\nAnother Australian film, The Nostradamus Kid, depicts a coming-of-age story in which a Seventh-day Adventist young man grows up in the 1950s.\n2016 Hollywood film Hacksaw Ridge depicts the story of Desmond Doss, a Seventh-Day Adventist medic who exhibited extraordinary bravery in the Pacific Theatre during World War II, including single-handedly saving the lives of at least 75 wounded American soldiers in one night under heavy enemy fire on Maeda Escarpment Okinawa, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

Lois Griffin, the mother from the main family in the series, states, \"I don't know who's crazier, Christian Scientists or those Seventh-day Adventists.\" The scene cuts to a scene where one Methodist man explains his faith as a Methodist and another man explains his faith as a Seventh-day Adventist. The second man says the same thing as the first man, except that they go to church on Saturdays instead of Sundays, causing the first man to react in shock.\nGirls' Season 4 episode \"Tad & Loreen & Avi & Shanaz\" complains about the bothersome persistence of door-to-door evangelist Adventists, confusing Jehovah's Witnesses with Seventh-day Adventists. The fictional character Avi Mensusen, states, \"Shanaz, do we get Watch Tower? It's those annoying Seventh-day Adventists, again.\"\nThe Leftovers' first episode of Season 3 there are some strong references to the event of the Great Disappointment. The intro is set back in the 19th century of America, showing a small family giving away their possessions, a group of people waiting for something on top of roofs and a congregation where someone is preaching about an event that will occur later in 1844.

Sawyer, a character explains the values of being immortal, including studying various faiths including Seventh-day Adventism.\nTree of Smoke (2007) by Denis Johnson features Kathy Jones, a Seventh-day Adventist aid worker\nRepresentations on postage stamps\nPostage stamps are used by countries to celebrate their culture and important people, places and events.

Pitcairn started printing stamps in 1940 and although there is little demand for postage from the less than 50 people in the local population, postal releases by Pitcairn are highly collected around the world and represent a significant part of the isolated island's revenue.\nSeventh-day Adventist connected issues include:\n*1958:The church school and teachers house stamps\n*1975: The Pitcairn owned by the Adventist church.\n*1977: The island church, which is the Seventh-day Adventist church on the island.\n*1986: A series of four stamps to celebrate 100 years of Adventism on the island.
