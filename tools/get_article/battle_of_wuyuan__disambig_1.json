This happened in reaction to the Chinese 1939-40 Winter Offensive in Suiyuan during the Second Sino-Japanese War.  The Japanese call it the Second Battle of the Back Loop (第2次後套作戦).\nBy 28 January 1940 the Japanese had built up forces from the 26th Division at Baotou sufficient to launch the First battle of the Back Loop (第1次後套作戦) to recover lost territory and move west to take Wuyuan which fell on February 3 and Linhe further west on 4 February.\nUnits\nJapanese Forces:\nMongolia Garrison Army 駐蒙軍 - Naosaburo Okabe\n* 26th Division - Lt.

On the night of the 20th they entered Wuyuan by surprise and after a seesaw fight over the strongpoint captured the city at 1600 hours on the 21st. The Japanese garrison retreated northward. Chinese forces then moved on to capture a strongpoint around Hsin-an-chen on the 22nd. This cut the road along the Yellow River to Wuyuan.\nIn an attempt to recover the situation the Japanese sent 600 troops from Dashetai via Siyitang in 80 trucks to make a forced crossing of the Wu-chia River at Ta-tsai-chu  north of Wuyuan.  For three days they fought the 101st Division without success.  By the 25th they had been reinforced to 3,000 men and made the crossing with artillery and air support.  Wuyuan again fell to the Japanese on the 26th and the Chinese fell back to the banks of Fang-chi-chu and continued their attacks at Xin'an, Xishanzui, Xixiaozhao, and Man-ko-su.\nThe Middlesboro Daily News which reported on Japan's planned offensive into the Muslim region, predicted that the Japanese would suffer a massive crushing defeat at the hands of the Muslims.\nMuslim Generals Ma Hongkui and Ma Hongbin defended west Suiyuan, especially Wuyuan in 1940 against the Japanese. Ma Hongbin commanded the Muslim 81st corps and incurred heavy casualties, but after fierce fighting eventually repulsed the Japanese and defeated them.\nUnable to withstand the pressure of Chinese attacks, the Japanese at Wuyuan retreated on March 30 and 31. On April 1 a guerrilla force and cavalry column recaptured Wuyuan, and the 11th Provisional Division recaptured Wu-pu-lang-kou. On April 3, cavalry recovered Xishanzui as the Japanese retreated to the east.\nJapan used poison gas against the Chinese armies at the Battle of Wuyuan and Battle of West Suiyuan.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Fu Zuoyi, deputy commander of the Eighth Military Front, requested that the 1st battalion of the 95th regiment of the new 32nd division be awarded the honorary flag, citing their bravery in attacking Wuyuan, fighting until battalion commander Zhao Shoujiang (趙壽江) was killed and the whole battalion had only 11 soldiers left. On May 16, the Nationalist Government awarded the battalion the .\nSources\n* Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) 2nd ed., 1971.
