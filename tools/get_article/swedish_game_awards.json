It has been held annually since 2002 and is organized by the student-driven, non-profit entrepreneurship association at the Royal Institute of Technology, Excitera. The competition's audience is students at Swedish universities and high schools, particularly those studying game development and software engineering. Funding is handled through partnerships with various software and game development companies, e.g. Digital Illusions CE and Sun Microsystems.\nHistory\nSwedish Game Awards started in 2002 as a PC-only game competition under the name KTH Game Awards, and was targeted mainly at students in the Stockholm area. KTH Game Awards was founded by the KTH students Yashar Moradbakhti, Bartek Gudowski, Mikael Pommert and Andreas Harju. In 2004, KTH Game Awards was merged with another competition organized by Excitera, called the Excitera Mobile Award. This led to the creation of special class for mobile phone games. After its first iteration, the name was changed to Swedish Game Awards to reflect the increase in scope from local to national competition, as well as the fact that the competition had grown to be the largest of its kind in Sweden.\nIn 2014 the competitions hosts changed from students of Royal Institute of Technology to students of Södertörn University (while still maintaining its cooperation with Excitera).\nIn 2015 the competition added the category Best Diversity Effort as a result of their co-operation with Diversi to reflect the games industry's increasing interest in variation of its developers and consumers. The final day of the competition also had [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2umQO2r7g7Q its first livestream] on YouTube by cooperating with students of Medieinstitutet to make the announcement of the winners available directly to the public. It also broke the previous record of submitted games in 2014 (which was 98) with 104 games.\nThe competition has gradually gained recognition from Swedish game development companies and universities as a way for students to show their game development capabilities and thus increase their chances of getting employment within the video game industry.\nCompetition Award History\nCurrent

Swedish Game Awards continues annually to draw greater numbers of entries from student-development teams across Sweden.\nRules\nThe parameters to the competition have remained relatively stable over the years, aimed toward providing a launching pad for talented, independent, student game developers to develop new and marketable games.\nThe official rules are available at http://gameawards.se/competition/rules.\nEvent Timeline\nThe process of the Swedish Game Awards spans the majority of each academic year. Beginning in October with the SGA Kickoff, previous winners, current jury members, and corporate sponsors are invited to present their perspectives of the game industry and the Swedish Game Awards in particular to the upcoming year's participants. Also at this time, the various award categories are announced. The competition submissions are developed by independent teams during the year, culminating in a Jury Weekend and Grand Finale party in late May.\nIn the early months of the competition, the SGA Tour also occurs. During the tour, representatives from the Swedish Game Awards visit universities and technical schools across the country to engage with competition participants.\nPartners\nMain Partners\nKing (company), DICE, Arrowhead Game Studios, Sweden Game Arena Autodesk\nGold Partners\nMAG Interactive\nSilver Partners\nParadox Interactive, Epic Games\nBronze Partners\nRovio Entertainment, Avalanche Studios\nCurrent Categories\n: Game of the Year\n: Gamers' Choice\n: Best Diversity Effort\n: Best Execution in Art\n: Best Execution in Audio\n: Best Execution in Design\n: Best Execution in Narrative\n: Best Technical Execution\nPrevious Competition\nPrevious Partners\nHere is a list of previous partners that have sponsored the Swedish Game Awards in some way in the past.\nPrevious Main Partners\nHP, Intel, ARM, Epic Games, King (company)\nPrevious Gold Partners\nDICE, Arrowhead Game Studios, Rovio Entertainment, Mali DEVELOPER CENTER\nPrevious Silver Partners\nParadox Interactive, DICE, Wooga, Stardoll, Fondia, Grand Cru Games\nPrevious Bronze Partners\nAutodesk, Easy Studios, Junebud, Gamers Gate, Swedish National Defence College, Avalanche Studios, Bitsquid, Hansoft\nPrevious Event Partners\nEasyTryck.se\nPrevious Media Partners\nThe Square (publication)\nPrevious Awards\n: Best Execution\n: Best Innovation\n: Best Mobile Game\n: Best Scenario\n: Best Serious Game\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvoioBWtZKZ4XvBB16aE28Q YouTube Channel] - YouTube Channel (since 2015).\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/swedishgameawards/ YouTube Channel] - Old YouTube Channel (2009-2010).\n* [https://www.facebook.com/swedishgameawards Facebook Page] - Official Facebook Page.\n* [https://twitter.com/SweGameAwards Twitter Page] - Official Twitter Page (since 2015).\n* [https://www.gameawards.se Swedish Game Awards] - Official Site\n* [http://conceptartchallenge.se/ Swedish Game Awards Concept Art Challenge] - Mini-challenge, Concept Art Challenge, Official Site\n* [http://gameawardswarmup.se/ Swedish Game Awards Warmup Competition] - Mini-challenge, Warmup Competition, Official Site\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100811114718/http://gameawards.se/episodes SGA TV] - Videos, Interviews, and More"
