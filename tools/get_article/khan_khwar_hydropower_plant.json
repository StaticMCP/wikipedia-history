It is situated on the Khan Khwar River, a right bank tributary of the Indus River. It is approximately 265&nbsp;km from the federal capital of Islamabad and 350&nbsp;km from the provincial capital of Peshawar.\nThe total electricity generation capacity of the Khan Khwar project is . There are two vertical Francis turbine units of 34 MW and one unit of 4 MW installed at the Khan Khwar Hydroelectric Station, with an average annual generation capacity of 595&nbsp;million units (GWh) of cheap electricity. These turbines are manufactured by the Dongfang Electric Machinery Co. Ltd. The project was completed by the technical assistance of Chinese corporations (Sinohydro Corporation via a consortium with China Water Resources Beifang Investigation, Design and Research Co. Ltd).\nConstruction of the Khan Khwar Hydropower Plant commenced in April, 2003, and was completed in April, 2012. The power house commenced commercial operations in November, 2010. The project was officially inaugurated on the 14 July, 2012, by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan Raja Pervez Ashraf. The total cost of the project was about PKR 10.73&nbsp;billion, out of which PKR 5.049&nbsp;billion accounted for the foreign exchange component.\nDam:Type: RCCLength: 112&nbsp;m.Height: 46&nbsp;m.Design discharge: 29 cusecsDesign head: 244&nbsp;m.\nSee also\n* List of dams and reservoirs in Pakistan\n* List of power stations in Pakistan\n* Satpara Dam\n* Allai Khwar Hydropower Project\n* Gomal Zam Dam\nReferences"
