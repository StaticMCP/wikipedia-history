It was intended to be established on the Left Bank of the Rhine which was under French occupation at the time. However, the Coup of 18 Fructidor in the same year led to a shift in policy, resulting in the direct annexation of the territory instead.\nFurther reading\n* Yvonne Kafka: Das Wendejahr 1797/8: Cisrhenanische Republik oder Annektion?
