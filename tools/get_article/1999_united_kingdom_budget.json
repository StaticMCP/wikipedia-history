Basic rate income tax was to be reduced from 23 per cent to 22 per cent in April 2000. The budget also abolished the married couple's allowance for under-65s and MIRAS mortgage interest relief from April 2000. Child tax credit was to be introduced and employer national insurance contributions cut by 0.5 per cent from April 2001. Stamp duties on property were to be raised. A Climate Change Levy was scheduled for the 2001–02 fiscal year.\nDetails\nTax Revenue\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Receipts\n! style=\"text-align: right\" |1999–2000 Revenues (£bn)\n|-\n|Business rates\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |16\n|-\n|Corporation Tax\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |30\n|-\n|Council Tax\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |13\n|-\n|Excise Duties\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |36\n|-\n|Income Tax\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |88\n|-\n|NI\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |56\n|-\n|VAT\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |54\n|-\n|Other\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |56\n|-\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" |Total Government revenue\n! style=\"text-align: right\" |349\n|}\nSpending\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Department\n! style=\"text-align: right\" |1999–2000 Expenditure (£bn)\n|-\n|Debt Interest\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |26\n|-\n|Defense\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |22\n|-\n|Education\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |41\n|-\n|Health\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |61\n|-\n|Housing & Environment\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |13\n|-\n|Industry, Agriculture,  Employment\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |15\n|-\n|Law & Order\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |19\n|-\n|Other\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |41\n|-\n|Social Security\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |102\n|-\n|Transport\n| style=\"text-align: right\" |9\n|-\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" |Total Government spending\n! style=\"text-align: right\" |349\n|}\nReferences"
