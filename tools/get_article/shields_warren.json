He was among the first to study the pathology of radioactive fallout. Warren influenced and mentored Eleanor Josephine Macdonald, epidemiologist and cancer researcher.\nEarly life\nWarren was born in 1898 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He graduated with an A.B in 1918 from Boston University and with an M.D. in 1923 from Harvard Medical School. From 1923 to 1925, he was an assistant in pathology at Boston City Hospital where he completed his medical residency in 1927.\nCareer\nAt Harvard Medical School, he began teaching as an instructor in pathology in 1925, was promoted to assistant professor in 1936, and became a full professor of pathology in 1948. In 1927, he became a pathologist at New England Deaconess Hospital (which later became part of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) and was promoted to pathologist-in-chief in 1946, serving in that post for 36 years.\nHe also served as pathologist-in-chief at New England Baptist Hospital and at Pondville State Hospital and was a consultant for several other hospitals. He established New England Deaconess Hospital's Cancer Research Institute and served as the director of the Institute until he resigned from the directorship in 1968.}}Warren's various research projects involved the American Society for Experimental Pathology, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Academy of Sciences, NASA, and the Veterans' Administration. Warren was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He was a trustee with the American Board of Pathology from 1944 to 1958.\nAwards and honors\n*Shields Warren Festschrift\n*Ward Burdick Award for Distinguished Service to Clinical Pathology, American Society for Clinical Pathology, 1949[https://s3.amazonaws.com/ascpcdn/static/ASCPResources/Web/pdf/awards/ASCP+Ward+Burdick+Award+for+Distinguished+Service+to+Clinical+Pathology+October+2016.pdf ASCP Burdock Award for Distinguished Award for Distinguished Service to Clinical Pathology]\n*Banting Medal for Scientific Achievement Award, American Diabetes Association, 1953\n*Pathologist of the Year, Meritorious Service Award, College of American Pathologists, 1955\n*Albert Einstein Medal and Award, 1962\n*James Ewing Lecture, Society of Surgical Oncology, 1962\n*American Cancer Society National Award, 1968\n*Enrico Fermi Award, US DOE, 1971\n*Holmes Lecture, New England Roentgen Ray Society, 1972\n*Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award, Health Physics Society,1974\n*Gold Headed Cane Award, Association of Clinical Scientists, 1980\n*Founders Award, Health Physics Society, 1985\nPersonal life\nOn August 11, 1923, he married Alice Springfield.
