Built in 1912 for the Sullivan Machine Company, it is one of the city's reminders of that company's importance as a major economic force in the region. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nDescription and history\nThe Claremont Warehouse No. 34 is located about  west of Claremont's central Tremont Square, between Main Street and Heritage Place. It is a tall building, four stories in height, with an irregular four-sided footprint about  long and ranging in width from . When built, the structure had an open interior with a single floor and three mezzanine levels, with a tall three-story opening at one end, and was covered by a sawtooth roof.\nThe building was designed by Arthur S. Coffin and built in 1912 by the Sullivan Machinery Company, a local manufacturer of quarrying and mining equipment. It was used primarily as a warehouse until 1967, also including a welding shop for a time. A rail line ran directly into the building, facilitating the loading and unloading of materials. It was purchased in 1974 by a mattress manufacturer. A large portion of the adjacent Sullivan Company plant (located between this building and the Sugar River) was destroyed by fire in 1979. It has since been converted to residential use.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sullivan County, New Hampshire\nReferences"
