Wardill played two first-class cricket matches: one for Victoria in 1866, and one 20 years later for the Australians in England in 1886. His brother Richard also played cricket for Victoria.\nBorn in England, Wardill migrated to Melbourne in 1861 and worked for several years with his brother Richard at the office of the Victoria Sugar Co. He joined the garrison artillery soon after his arrival, and rose to the rank of major in the Harbor Trust Garrison Battery in 1885.\nWardill was secretary of Melbourne Cricket Club from 1876 to 1911. In his time the membership of the club increased from 572 to 5353. A biographer said that \"Wardill was largely successful in his aim to make the Melbourne Cricket Club the Australian counterpart of the famous Marylebone Cricket Club in England\". His salary was raised to 700 pounds per annum in 1907, having been 600 pounds per annum for the previous 16 years.\nIn his role as Melbourne Cricket Club secretary, Wardill organised and managed Australia's tours to England in 1886, 1899 and 1902.\nWardill died of heart disease in 1917. He married once, to Elizabeth King, and had one daughter who died in infancy.\nSee also\n* List of Victoria first-class cricketers\nReferences"
