He is not mentioned again until he becomes chamberlain of the City of York in 1399. He also held the offices of sheriff (1401–02) and lord mayor (1417–18 & 1428–29). A measure of his standing in the city was evident when he and his wife were granted a papal indult and gifts received from William Skirlaw, the then bishop of Durham. William was a member of the Calais Staple. He was returned as MP for the city on four occasions and, as a member of the council of twelve, was involved in the elections on ten more occasions. William was reprimanded in 1418 by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester for apparently polluting the royal fisheries on the River Foss. This may have been caused by sewage from properties he owned in nearby Peasholm.\nWilliam was married to Isabel, who died in 1435 and had one son, William and three daughters. He was related by marriage to fellow merchant John Blackburn, who married his daughter Joan. He died in 1439 and was buried next to his wife in St Cuthbert's Church in York, a building he had paid to have rebuilt and restored. He left his holdings in Peasholm and Colliergate to his son, William. His daughter, Katherine, received his property on Thursday Market. He left his grandson, William, his armour and jewelry.\nReferences"
