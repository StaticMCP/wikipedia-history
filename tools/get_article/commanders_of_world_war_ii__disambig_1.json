Rommel was highly decorated in World War I with the Pour le Mérite, Germany's highest award. During World War II, he made an immediate impact in the Saharan desert, conquering all of West Africa and threatening to reach Suez. A number of factors such as stretching supply lines and the reinforcement of Allied military power (both in Morocco and Egypt) turned the tide in the favour of the Allies, and his forces were routed in the Battle of Tunisia in 1943. Before he could counterattack, German high command reassigned him to defend the Atlantic Wall. Rommel failed to stop the allied invasion of Normandy. Though typically linked to the assassination of Hitler, Rommel likely did not take part in the July 20 plot as he did not want future generations to think that the Axis lost the war due to backstabbing.

After Adolf Hitler convinced Ion Antonescu to continue the war beyond Romania's pre-1940 borders, Dumitrescu then led the Third Army to the Crimea, taking part in the Battle of the Sea of Azov. In 1942 he was made General of the Army, thus becoming Antonescu's second-in-command. The German forces in Stalingrad were in dire need of assistance, and the German High Command transferred many of its troops to the besieged city, which meant the Third Army now had fewer troops to defend an increasingly large front. The German Command, however, chose to ignore Dumitrescu's reports about a Soviet troop buildup in the southwest and request for anti-tank weapons, as they did with his repeated suggestions to attack the Soviet bridgehead at Kletskaya. After the 1944 Romanian coup d'état Dumitrescu turned against Nazi Germany and captured more than 6,000 German prisoners of war. He retired in early September, 1944 after the Romanian Army and the Red Army retook Northern Transylvania and advanced into Hungary. Dumitrescu was put under house arrest and put on trial for war crimes by the new communist government, but was eventually acquitted because of a lack of evidence.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Constantin Constantinescu-Claps\n|\n|Army General\n|Order of Michael the Brave\n|General Officer Commanding, Romanian Fourth Army\n|Died in 1961.\n|\n* Eastern Front (World War II)\n* Battle of Stalingrad\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Commanded 10th Army Corps in 1940, the 11th Army Corps in 1941 and the Romanian Fourth Army between 1941 and 1943.

In the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, General Nicolae Ciupercă noted: \"General Constantinescu has led the army corps with a lot of competence, causing, indirectly, the withdrawal of the Soviet forces between the Dniester River and the Suhoz Lake. I consider him to be a very good army corps commander, who is distinguished by great devotion and precious optimism\". He fought later tat the Battle of Stalingrad, where the Romanian armies suffered a crushing defeat. Constantinescu’s 4th Army, was deployed to the south of Stalingrad. Most of these formations were in deplorable shape, with at best 73% of necessary manpower, with the 1st Infantry Division going as low as 25% and an almost nonexistent arsenal of heavy anti-tank guns. In 1943, Constantinescu-Claps was relieved of his assignment and replaced by Constantin Sănătescu. In spite of his high rank, he never received any German medals and was in conflict with the German leadership and Conducător Ion Antonescu who merely tolerated him allegedly for his abilities as a general.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Constantin Sănătescu\n|\n|Army General\n|\n|General Officer Commanding, 4th Army Corps\nGeneral Officer Commanding, Romanian Fourth Army\nChief of the Romanian General Staff\n|Died in 1948.\n|\n* Eastern Front (World War II)\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |In 1939 he held the positions of commander of the 8th Army Corps and later that year commander of the Cavalry Corps.

On the day of the coup, when General Dumitru Dămăceanu proposed to move it to 26 August as it's a bath day for the Bucharest Garrison and soldiers will not be prepared in time, Sanatescu is reported to have replied \"Dămăceanu, you forget that at Mărăşeşti we won in pijamas, this time we will win naked!\". Referring to an event during the Battle of Mărăşeşti in World War I  where the Romanian Infantry Regiment 32 \"Mircea\" was forced to fight in white shirts due to a surprise attack by the German Army while they were cleaning their uniforms, Major Ionescu Atanasie desperately ordered a bayonet charge in white shirts that pushed back the German attack.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Gheorghe Avramescu\n|\n|Army General\n|German Cross in Gold\n|General Officer Commanding, 10th Division\nGeneral Officer Commanding, Mountain Corps\nGeneral Officer Commanding, III Corps\nGeneral Officer Commanding, VI Corps\nGeneral Officer Commanding, 4th Army\n|Died in 1945.\n|\n* Eastern Front (World War II)\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Commanded the Romanian Mountain Corps between 1941 and 1943.

He successfully led the 4th Army in the assault on the Zvolen–Banská Bystrica line, in what was the prelude to the Bratislava–Brno Offensive in Slovakia. Avramescu complained repeatedly to the Soviets about the lack of supplies to the Romanian Army and impossible tasks as the spearhead of the assaults. He was killed on 3 March 1945 in the car that was transporting him, the other 3 occupants were NKVD officers. According to the official report issued on 23 March 1945 by NKVD head Lavrentiy Beria, Avramescu was hit by a bullet through the car's windshield. On the same day, his wife and daughter were arrested and sent to Siberia. His daughter committed suicide; according to Soviet sources, this happened on 6 March 1945.

Following the Red Army's offensive in the Caucasus, surrounding the 13th Panzer Division near Mayramadag, Dumitrache's troops broke through the Soviet forces and allowed the German armored units to pull out. Afterwards, the Axis forces in the Caucasus were put on the defensive, and began to withdraw.

Coroamă himself claimed that the initiative was curbed by Horia Sima, who did not want Codreanu alive. When Antonescu informed Carol that the Iron Guard wanted a new king, Antonescu also commented that the government \"cannot count on the commanders, and especially not on General Coroamă, who has switched completely toward the Iron Guard.\" When the Iron Guard marched for the royal palace, General Coroamă refused to comply with the royal order of shooting down Guardists who marched in front of the Palace. According to several period witnesses, his resistance persuaded Antonescu to follow suit, and allowed for a bloodless transition. Antonescu was poorly impressed by Coroamă's inaction, telling Coroamă ''\"You sir were the king's trusted man. If these were your ideas, then you shouldn't have accepted such an appointment.\"'' In the aftermath of Carol II's forced abdication, Coroamă was mistrusted and marginalized by Conducător Ion Antonescu. Like other Guardists, Coroamă was dissatisfied with Antonescu's regime, or \"National Legionary State\". Under the command of the 4th Army Corps in Iași, he witnessed the clashes between Antonescu and his Guard colleagues, peaking during the Legionary Rebellion of 1941. Coroamă took a moderate stance, refusing to side with the Iron Guard and his mediation helped Antonescu to restore order in Iași without bloodshed. According to Nazi German diplomatic cables, he did so because he feared that the Soviet Union would profit from the unrest and invade Romania. Later in 1941, as Nazi Germany and Romania opened an Eastern Front against the Soviet Union, Coroamă advised against continuing the offensive beyond Bessarabia. In 1944, he was one of the Romanian generals prepared to support Germany during Operation Spring Awakening, however, he switched his allegiance in support of the Royal Coup and worked to consolidate a national network of anti-communist resistance groups.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Mihail Cămărașu\n|\n|Army Corps General\n|Order of the Crown (Romania)\n|General Officer Commanding, 7th Army Corps\n|\n|\n* Eastern Front (World War II)\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Commanded the 7th Army Corps between 1941 and 1943.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ioan Sion\n|\n|Division General\n|Order of Michael the Brave\n|\n|Died during the Battle of Stalingrad\n|\n* Eastern Front (World War II)\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Commanded the 1st Armored Division between 1939 and 1942.

At the request of the Soviet Union, his division was disbanded in 1944 and he was arrested in his words \"like a common burglar\". In prison, he wrote a letter to Constantin Sănătescu, where he deplored the fact that so many of the Romanian senior officer corps were being dismissed en masse, while others were being arrested or harassed, after having fought in war as ordered by the king. He concluded his letter by asking, \"Why are the prisons being filled with the most devoted soldiers of the country?\". He was released in 1945 at the insistence of Constantin Sănătescu with the approval of Soviet General Vladislav Vinogradov, and retired from the army the next month. After the war he was investigated by the Bucharest People's Tribunal for \"anti-Soviet propaganda\" but was found not guilty. In 1948 his son, Mihai, managed to escape Communist Romania and settled in France. He was arrested by the Siguranța Statului secret police for \"conspiracy against state security,\" and sent to Jilava Prison.\n|-style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Nicolae Cambrea\n|\n|Division General\n|Order of Michael the Brave\n|General Officer Commanding, 5th Infantry Division\n|\n|\n* Eastern Front (World War II)\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Commanded the 5th Division in 1942.

He presided over a significant enlargement of the Romanian Black Sea Fleet, most notably the commissioning of the Romanian-built submarines Marsuinul and her smaller sister ship Rechinul, the former being the most powerful and modern Axis submarine in the Black Sea. The evacuation of the Crimea in April–May 1944 was the most complex and extensive operation of the Romanian Navy during the Second World War. From 15 April to 14 May, numerous German and Romanian warships escorted many convoys between Constanța and Sevastopol. Axis ships transported, under constant attacks from Soviet aircraft and shore artillery, over 30,000 troops. Of these, 18,000 were transported by Romanian ships. In total, Romanian and German convoys evacuated over 113,000 Axis troops from the Crimea. No Romanian Navy warships were lost during the evacuation. Macellariu's successful conduct of the evacuation and the achievements obtained by the Romanian warships under his command, in combat and number of Axis troops evacuated, earned him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. After the 23 August 1944 coup which put Romania on the side of the Allies, the situation became uncertain. German Vice Admiral Helmuth Brinkmann had orders to hold Constanța at all costs. However, after a face-to-face meeting with Macellariu, he was persuaded to make an orderly retreat and avoid an unnecessary bloodshed. In 1948, Macellariu was arrested by the communist authorities and incarcerated at Jilava Prison. After a trial, he was sentenced to hard labor for life for high treason, a sentence subsequently reduced to 25 years.\n|}\nSlovakia\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#000; color:white;\" | Armed Force\n! colspan=\"2\" |Name\n!
