The station was originally built in 1913 by the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and is also known as the \"Truman Depot\", because it was the final stop in Harry S. Truman's 1948 Whistlestop Campaign and where 8,500 admirers welcomed Truman home in January 1953 after leaving office. The depot has since become an Amtrak stop and is home to the Jackson County Genealogical Society Research Library. The station was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nSee also\n* List of Amtrak stations\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.trainweb.org/usarail/independence.htm Independence, MO – USA Rail Guide (TrainWeb)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101026090723/http://www.examiner.net/features/x1273022064/Fans-of-Truman-Depot-fear-for-its-future \"Fans of Truman Depot fear for its future: History lovers and train buffs want to ensure its future isn't as rocky as its past\"] Page A-1, Independence Examiner, 10-23-2010 edition."
