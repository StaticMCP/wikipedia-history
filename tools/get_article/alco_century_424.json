Cataloged as a part of Alco's Century line of locomotives, the C424 was intended to replace the earlier RS-27 model and offered as a lower-priced alternative to the C425. Montreal Locomotive Works also built some of these locomotives.\nOriginal owners\nALCO C424 5202 at Rutherford Yard in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1970]]\nLocomotives built by Alco\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Owner\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Quantity\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Numbers\n! style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Notes\n|-\n|Belt Railway of Chicago ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |6 || 600–605 || At least one (#603) now Western New York & Pennsylvania Railroad\n|-\n|Erie Lackawanna Railway ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |15 || 2401–2415 ||\n|-\n|Erie Mining Company ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |1 || 500 ||\n|-\n|Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |45 || 8100-8144 ||\n|-\n|Green Bay and Western Railroad ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |4 || 311–314 ||\n|-\n|Pennsylvania Railroad ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |1 || 2415 || rebuilt from RS27 demonstrator 640-1\n|-\n|Reading Company ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |10 || 5201–5210 ||\n|-\n|Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |7 || 300–306 || To Burlington Northern 4240–4246.\n|-\n|Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |2 || 800–801 || Later sold to the Morristown & Erie Railway as #18 and 19. #19 preserved by Tri-State Railway Historical Society. #18 preserved by the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, IL.\n|-\n|Wabash Railroad ||style=\"text-align:center;\" |7 || B900-B906 || Originally supposed to be NDM 8100–8106, but the order was canceled and the units were sold to Wabash.
