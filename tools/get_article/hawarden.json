It is part of the Deeside conurbation on the Wales-England border and is home to Hawarden Castle. In the 2011 census the ward of the same name had a population of 1,887, whereas the community of the same name, which also includes Ewloe (which also has a castle) Mancot and Aston had a population of 13,920.\nThe scenic wooded Hawarden Park abuts the clustered settlement in the south. Hawarden Bridge consists of distribution and industrial business premises beyond Shotton/Queensferry and the Dee. The west of the main street is called The Highway, its start marked by the crossroads with a fountain in the middle, near which are public houses, some with restaurants.\nThe village is  from Chester. In 2014 it was named in The Sunday Times annual Best Places To Live List.\nEtymology\nBoth the English and Welsh names of the village allude to its elevated geographical position. English '  is from Old English ' \"high\" +  'enclosure' and has had its bisyllabic pronunciation since the sixteenth century, its trisyllabic, now solely written, form being due to the influence of Welsh, which stresses and therefore kept the penultimate syllable. The Welsh name '  is older than ' and is a compound of ' \"high ground\" + ', which is most likely a form of  'rich in cattle' although may be a personal name.\nHistory\nThe 1848 Topographical Dictionary of Wales led by Samuel Lewis states that Hawarden is of remote antiquity and was called 'Pennard Halawg', or more properly 'Pen-y-Llwch', the headland above the lake. of the estuary - most of the village and Ewloe is over 80 metres - compared withup to 20 metres on both sides nearer Chester and Broughton above ordnance datum (sea level).|group= n}}  The hill forts such as the huge remains next to the medieval Hawarden Castle and Trueman's Hill motte were - it records locally - believed to date to the time of fortifications against incursions of the Cornavii tribe and the Romans.\nThe Normans recorded that the Saxons called the place Haordine where, east of today's village, was the principal manor of the Saxon Hundred of Atiscros. William the Conqueror granted the lands and manor to Hugh Lupus since it formed part of the County Palatine of Chester, whereupon Hawarden Castle was built and later proved key to Welsh history, at that time lived in by Roger Fitzvalerine, then the Montaults, or de Montaltos, barons of Mold, who held it as seneschal.\nEfforts to subdue north Welsh territory into a degree of fiefdom followed intermittently, with no great success.  In the castle Llewellyn of Wales who was in possession negotiated peace in 1264 with Simon de Montford, who led a brief rebellion against Henry III of England and agreed to betroth his daughter to Llewellyn in exchange for restoring the de facto Welsh castle to Robert de Montault.  The rebellion failed.  Accordingly, by 1280 the castle became a crown asset, listed as a Castrum Regis.  Later, following Edward's successful campaign imposing exacting terms on the Welsh, building Flint Castle and strengthening other castles, in 1282 Llewellyn's brother Dafydd took the castle back, killing the garrison and transferring Roger de Clifford to remote Snowdon.  This second recapture of the castle triggered Edward's killing of Llewellyn and annexation of Wales.  The castle became a prized possession: see Hawarden Castle.\nThe village of Saltney (next to Chester, but in Wales) was part of the parish.\n19th century\nThe prime minister William Ewart Gladstone (1809–1898) spent his later life in Hawarden Castle, which had in the Glorious Revolution been acquired by his wife's family, the Glynne baronets.  In 1847 water was brought into the place at an expense of upwards of £1000 to be recouped by the River Dee Company.  In the nineteenth century the economy of the parish (about three times larger than the modern Community Council area) involved weekly markets, many seams of coal, the making of tiles, bricks and drainage pipes and chemicals such as Glauber salts and ivory black making.\nIn 1886 the curate of Hawarden, the Rev. Harry Drew, married Mary Gladstone, the second daughter of the Prime Minister, at St Margaret's Church, Westminster – a society wedding attended by the Prince of Wales.\nIn 1896, Hawarden was the location of prime minister William Ewart Gladstone's meeting with Li Hongzhang, a key reformer in the Qing dynasty's Self Strengthening Movement, on his diplomatic mission to the UK.\nGladstone bequeathed his library to the town under the name of St Deiniol's Library in honour of the patron saint of the parish church next door. It is the only residential library in Britain and was renamed Gladstone's Library in 2010.\nEducation\nHawarden Village Church School (previously Rector Drew Primary School) is the junior school of the village. Hawarden High School is a high school which dates back to 1606 and was attended by Michael Owen and Gary Speed, the former manager of the Wales national football team.\nIn 1927, Knutsford Ordination Test School relocated to Hawarden — first to the Old Rectory, then to the new castle in 1939 before it closed the following year.\nEconomy\nQueensferry consists predominantly of industrial, commercial and storage businesses by the River Dee and is situated to immediately northeast of the community - the village is residential. moneysupermarket.com has significant premises at St David's Park by the main A55 road in nearby Ewloe.\nHawarden Airport, sometimes called Hawarden (Chester) Airport, with adjoining Hawarden Industrial Park is in nearby Broughton.\nVisitor attractions\n*St Deiniol's Church\n*Hawarden Castle\n*Old Hawarden Castle\n*Gladstone's Library\nGovernance\nAt the lowest level of local government, Hawarden Community Council elects or co-opts twenty-one community councillors from three wards namely Hawarden Aston, Hawarden Ewloe and Hawarden Mancot.\nThere are three identical electoral wards for Flintshire County Council, each of which elects two councillors.\nThe county archives, the Flintshire Record Office, are housed in the Old Rectory at Hawarden.\nClimate\nThe highest temperature in Wales was recorded in Hawarden on 18 July 2022 at 37.1°C (98.8°F). The previous highest  temperature recorded in Wales, 35.2°C (95.4°F), was also recorded in Hawarden on 2 August 1990.  Hawarden has held this record almost continuously, until it was replaced for a few hours by Gogerddan which recorded a temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F) on 18 July 2022, first breaking the Welsh record, after which Hawarden surpassed Gogerddan.\nTransport\nClose towns include Connah's Quay , Mold , Flint  and the city of Wrexham .\nHawarden railway station is on the Borderlands line with services direct to  to the north and to  (via ) to the south.\nThere are three interchanges with local roads onto the major A55 road linking North Wales to Chester and the major A494 road linking Dolgellau via Mold to the Wirral where it divides into the roads towards Liverpool and Manchester (the M53 and M56 motorways) - the village has a choice of three routes towards Chester city centre.\nHawarden Airport lies some  east of the village.\nNotable residents\n*Sir John Glynne, 6th Baronet (1713–1777) politician and landowner, built Hawarden Castle.\n*Emma, Lady Hamilton (1765–1815), maid, model, dancer and actress; raised in Hawarden.\n*William Ewart Gladstone (1809–1898), 12 years as Prime Minister; retired to Hawarden Castle.\n*Edmund J.
