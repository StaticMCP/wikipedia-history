It is around 2 hectares or 0.02 square km in size. It is part of the Low Isles, along with Woody Island, an uninhabited coral and mangrove island. The isles are surrounded by  of reef. The Low Islets are a Marine National Park Zone. Day visitors come to the island on a regular basis via a number of commercial operators. There is a lagoon where private vessels can moor or anchor outside the reef protection markers overnight, but there is no overnight accommodation on the island. There is a weather station and an active lighthouse (named Low Isles Light). No fishing is allowed in the lagoon or within a buffer zone around the islands. Motorised water sports are not permitted in the locality. There is a 6 knot limit. No open fires of any sort or dogs are permitted on either island, and no island access between sunset and sunrise.\nHistory\nOn 4 September 2006, Steve Irwin was killed by a stingray on Batt Reef to the east of Low Island. He was rushed to Low Island where he was pronounced dead.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/1dejkfd/alma99183410407402061 Report on Scientific Expedition to Low Isles in 1954 1954; 2014], State Library of Queensland"
