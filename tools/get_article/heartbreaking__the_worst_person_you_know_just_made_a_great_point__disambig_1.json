Written in second person, the article describes a situation in which the reader's hated coworker makes a logically sound argument during a political debate, much to the reader's chagrin.\nThe article's headline and stock photo became an Internet meme used to mock otherwise-disliked figures when they make statements that users agree with. In 2025, ClickHole published a follow-up article titled \"This Makes More Sense: The Worst Person You Know Just Made A Terrible Point\".\nImage\nThe article is illustrated with a stock photo of Josep Maria García, drummer in the Spain-based band Primogénito Lopez. The picture was taken in 2014 during a work trip to Barcelona, during which García was helping his photographer brother-in-law to set up the lighting for a photoshoot. The Guardian compared García to András Arató, who also unintentionally became the subject of an Internet meme as Hide the Pain Harold.\nSlate journalist Cameron Wilson tried to find García in 2021 by emailing ClickHole, without getting a response. Twitter user @iamtherog had found that the image was owned by Getty Images, but the image was already removed from their site at that time. An Indian medical website contained the image, still including the Exif data with the GPS coordinates and the name of the photographer.\nThe image, separate from the article and headline, has been used as a meme with the same meaning.\nThe meme has been used in reference to Donald Trump, David Portnoy, Mo Brooks, Neil Gorsuch, Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Nick Fuentes, and many others who have been considered polarizing by many.\nReception\nMic has called the article \"absolutely iconic\"; Vulture called it \"one of the best articles to ever grace the internet\".\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
