      "text": "# List of Alexander McQueen collections\n\nBritish designer Alexander McQueen designed 36 womenswear collections under his eponymous fashion label during a career that lasted from 1992 until his death in 2010.}} As a designer, McQueen was known for sharp tailoring, historicism, and imaginative designs that often verged into the controversial. His runway shows were known for being dramatic and theatrical, with some including elements of performance art. McQueen drew inspiration for his clothing and shows from a broad range of sources, including film, history, nature, world religions, art, and his own life.}} Through his work, he explored themes such as romanticism, sexuality, and death.\nHe used unusual cuts and silhouettes to play with the human form, making wearers appear inhuman. Early in his career, he originated an extreme low-rise trouser cut called the \"bumster\", which became a brand signature. Other significant designs include the skull scarf, another brand signature; the oyster dress; and the armadillo shoe, notably worn by singer Lady Gaga.\nWomenswear was the focus of McQueen's career. In his early collections, he sometimes presented menswear or had male models walk in the shows, but his label did not have a regular menswear line until 2004. From October 1996 to October 2001, McQueen was – in addition to his responsibilities for his own label – head designer at French fashion house Givenchy, for which he produced both haute couture and ready-to-wear collections each season. This article concerns itself with McQueen's own-label womenswear collections.\nCollections\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" | Collection\n! scope=\"col\" | Season\n! scope=\"col\" | Show date\n! scope=\"col\" | Show location\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Themes and inspiration\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims\n| 1992 graduation collection\n|\n|Duke of York's Headquarters, London It is unclear where this originated from, but it appears to be erroneous, as London Fashion Week in 1992 was held in March, and Central Saint Martins holds its graduation shows at Fashion Week.}}\n|London serial killer Jack the Ripper and prostitution in the Victorian era, particularly their practice of selling locks of hair\n| Thesis collection for Master's degree in fashion at Central Saint Martins; purchased in its entirety by editor Isabella Blow\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Taxi Driver\n| Autumn/Winter 1993\n|\n|data-sort-value=\"Ritz\"|The Ritz Hotel, London\n|Taxi Driver, a 1976 neo-noir film by Martin Scorsese; to a lesser extent McQueen's taxi driver father\n|Debut of bumster trousers; exhibited rather than shown on runway;}} no pieces survive as entire collection was accidentally lost immediately following the exhibit\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Nihilism\n| Spring/Summer 1994\n|\n|Bluebird Garage, London\n|Eclectic collection with no straightforward theme, elements of primitivism, pushback against feminine womenswear\n|First professional catwalk show\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Banshee\n| Autumn/Winter 1994\n|\n|Café de Paris, London\n|The Gaelic banshee, a spirit whose wailing foretells death; darkly romanticised idea of resilience through tragedy\n|Isabella Blow walked as a model; show was reprised for New York Fashion Week at the behest of fashion promoter Derek Anderson\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" data-sort-value=\"Birds\" | The Birds\n| Spring/Summer 1995\n|\n|Bagley's warehouse, London\n|The Birds, a 1963 natural horror film by Alfred Hitchcock; ornithology; the mathematical designs of graphic artist M.
