It spent 6 weeks on the chart.\nCritical reception\nIn the October 19, 1985 issue of Billboard, it stated \"new star [Houston] should have no trouble parlaying her pop prominence into club action with this crisp, cool Kashif production; upbeat rhythms in an elegant manner.\"\nAllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the track \"unheralded\" and one of the lighter songs on the album, as well as \"a dance/R&B hit [...] that remains one of Whitney's purest pop pleasures\".\nAccolades\nIn their list of \"40 Best Whitney Houston Songs\", BET ranked the song 29th place, writing that Houston \"knew how to counterbalance her pop grandiloquence with some good old-fashioned rhythm and blues from the very beginning.\" Slant ranked \"Thinking About You\" as Houston's 11th best song, writing that it was a \"deeply seductive gem—and one of the most teasingly erotic of all her dance-floor jams.\"\nFormats and track listings\n*US 7\" vinyl single\n:A: \"Thinking About You\" – 5:24\n:B: \"Someone for Me\" – 4:58\n*US 12\" vinyl maxi single\n:A: \"Thinking About You\" (extended dance version) – 7:19\n:B1: \"Thinking About You\" (single version) – 4:03\n:B2: \"Thinking About You\" (dub version) – 8:04\n*UK 12\" vinyl single\n:A: \"Thinking About You\" (club side) – 5:24\n:B: \"You Give Good Love\" (radio side) – 4:33\nCredits and personnel\n;\"Thinking About You\"\n*Kashif – writer, producer\n*La La – writer\n*Bruce Forest – remix producer\n*Michael Hutchinson – engineer\n;\"Someone for Me\"\n*Freddie Washington – writer\n*Raymond Jones – writer\n*Jermaine Jackson – producer\n*Bill Schnee – mixer\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1985)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Top 100 Black Contemporary Singles (Cashbox)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
