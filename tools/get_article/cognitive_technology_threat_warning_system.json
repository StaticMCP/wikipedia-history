CT2WS is part of U.S. Department of Defense's effort to produce an efficient and working Network-centric infantryman.\nProject\nProposal\nProposed in early 2007, DARPA came to believe that a visual warning system could be produced and developed via an integration of technology and artificial intelligence. By combining discoveries in flat-field, wide-angle optics, large pixel-count digital imagers, ultra-low power analog-digital hybrid signal processing electronics with cognitive visual processing algorithms, and neural network-based target detection signatures, DARPA felt a breakthrough was possible, but not likely to be achieved by independent researchers. CT2WS further requires that human brain activity must be integrated with the technology.\nSelection of research partners is currently open to potential researchers, including: non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, etc.\nIt was anticipated that funding for CT2WS will continue until 2011.\nFunding\nBudget for the project will be determined based upon the scope of the independent proposals.\nThere have been many research and technology contributors to the project including [https://web.archive.org/web/20190821163927/http://www.hrl.com/ HRL] and [http://advancedbrainmonitoring.com/ Advanced Brain Monitoring] which contributed the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130605015032/http://advancedbrainmonitoring.com/neurotechnology/wireless-eeg/ B-Alert wireless-EEG headsets].\nTechnical details\nCriteria for project includes: soldier portable, sensory-data collect for a 120 degree field of view (FOV), artificial analysis of data, threat analysis and prioritizing \"brain-in-the-loop\" integration, and real-time processing of neural and artificial cognitive data.\nRelated projects\nThe DARPA Grand Challenge is another project designed to attract independent researchers to study AI for application to network-centric warfare. The Grand Challenge has tested autonomous driving ability in both urban and rough terrain settings.\nSee also\n* Future Combat Systems\n* Future Force Warrior\n* Transformation of the United States Army\nReferences"
