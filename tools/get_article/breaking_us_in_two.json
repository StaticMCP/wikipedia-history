It was the third of three charting singles from his 1982 LP, Night and Day.\nThe single was released in the UK on 13 August 1982, backed with the Spanish version of \"Target\" renamed \"El Blanco\" (target in Spanish).  In the US, the B-side was the regular English version of \"Target\". The single began to get radio airplay in late 1982 and early 1983, especially in the US where the music video was in medium rotation on MTV in early February. The single had become a hit in the US, reaching number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 the week of March 19, 1983. Later, it reached number 40 in Canada. It also charted in the UK and Australia.  It was a bigger Adult Contemporary hit, reaching number eight in the U.S. and number 12 in Canada.\nThe music video was filmed on location in and around the Oakworth railway station in England.\nReception\nUpon its release as a single, Charles Shaar Murray of the NME called \"Breaking Us in Two\" \"one of those 'Let's sit down and have a serious talk about our relationship' songs for which Jackson is so justly famous\". He added, \"This one is pleasant rather than stirring, a medium-paced toe-tapper with suitably anguished lyrics and some fairly stylish piano playing.\" Geoff Barton of Sounds was negative, describing the \"miserable, depressing, mournful ballad\" as an \"ugly grey stain in the Dalmatians' colourful world\". Edwyn Collins, as a guest reviewer for Melody Maker, said, \"This is another song that's just full of cliches. It's almost a pastiche. It's just so mediocre. If you heard it on the radio it would be some totally ambient background noise. Brian Eno would be proud of him.\"\nIn the US, Billboard said it was \"jazzy and precise [and] similar in tone to the top 10 'Steppin' Out'.\"\nChart history\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1982-1983)\n!align=\"left\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|90\n|-\n|Canada RPM Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|40\n|-\n|Canada RPM Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|\n|-\n|New Zealand\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n|-\n|UK (The Official Charts Company)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|US Billboard Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US Cash Box Top 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
