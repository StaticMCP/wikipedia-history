It was built in 1870 for Anthony A. Ward and his wife, née Mary Jane Foster. It was inherited by their daughter Jennie, who lived here with her husband John Meade, an engineer for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. It remained in the Ward-Meade family until 1961, when it was acquired by the city of Topeka.\nIt has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since November 12, 1975.\nHistory\nThe site was originally the homestead of the Anthony A. Ward family, who settled there in the 1850s and who were among the earliest settlers of the area that later became Topeka.  The Ward-Meade house is considered the first mansion built in Topeka.  Construction began in 1870, the same year as the first wing of the Statehouse.\nAnthony Ward was a wheelwright who held the sand rights on the Kansas River near his house.  He sold sand to the builders of Topeka and made wheels for wagons that carried settlers to California.  The Wards also taught and worked with the Native Americans who lived in the area.\nOn April 16, 1874, John Mackey Meade, a civil engineer, came to Shawnee County from Virginia to survey the route of the Santa Fe Railroad. He married Jenny Ward, a daughter of Anthony, and they inherited the Ward House when her parents died.  The Meades raised seven children in the house, which was owned by members of the family until it was purchased by the City of Topeka in 1960.\nSite development\nThe Ward-Meade house and surrounding five acres were sold to the City of Topeka in the 1960s as a garden center.  Shawnee County acquired the site when the City of Topeka and Shawnee County Parks and Recreation Departments consolidated in January 2011; the County continues to maintain part of the grounds as a botanical garden.  In 1976, after being placed on the National Historic Register, the house became a Bicentennial project of the Junior League of Topeka.  Restoration of the exterior and three main rooms of the first floor of the house were financed by private, state and federal funds.  The work was completed and the house was opened to the public for seasonal tours as part of Topeka's Bicentennial celebration.  A volunteer board of directors, Historic Topeka Inc., was established to oversee the project.  The Board was actively involved in fundraising for the park until 1985.\nIn 1984, a plan was developed by a group of volunteers affiliated with the Park to establish a prairie town at the site.  The plan was approved by the Parks and Recreation Department and the City Commission a year later.\nOld Prairie Town\nOld Prairie Town at Ward-Meade Historic Site is a  open-air museum, park and historic site located in Topeka, Kansas.
