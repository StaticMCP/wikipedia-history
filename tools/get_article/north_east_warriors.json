      "text": "# North East Warriors\n\nNorth East Warriors was the women's representative cricket team for the English historic counties of County Durham and Northumberland. They played their home matches at grounds across the two counties, including Vigo Lane, Washington, County Durham and The Wicket, Hipsburn, Northumberland. They were captained by Laura Ellison.\nThe team was formed ahead of the 2020 season, with Durham and Northumberland deciding to merge at both youth and senior levels in order to provide a \"united high performance pathway\" for the region. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not take part in any formal competitions in 2020, only playing friendlies, but went on to compete in the Women's Twenty20 Cup from 2021 onwards and the ECB Women's County One-Day in 2024. They also contributed players to the North Representative XI, and were partnered with the regional team Northern Diamonds. They also played List A matches in the 2024 ECB Women's County One-Day championship, including a match against Yorkshire at the Riverside Ground.\nWith Durham Women turning professional, the Warriors played their last fixture against Derbyshire at Rockliffe Park in a T20 on 13 August 2024.\nPlayers\nCurrent squad\nBased on appearances in the 2023 season.  denotes players with international caps.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#AFEEEE; color:black\" scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! style=\"background:#AFEEEE; color:black\" scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Nationality\n! style=\"background:#AFEEEE; color:black\" scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! style=\"background:#AFEEEE; color:black\" scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Laura Ellison ||  || 2 || Club captain\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Maddy Atkinson ||  || 2 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Ami Campbell ||  || 0 || On loan to Worcestershire\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Hayley Falla ||  || 2 || Wicket-keeper\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Libby Haward ||  || 2 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Rachel Hopkins ||  || 2 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Sterre Kalis&nbsp; ||  || 0 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Jenny McDowell ||  || 2 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Harriet Robson ||  || 2 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Lizzie Scott ||  || 0 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Lilly-Mai Taylor ||  || 2 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Layla Tipton ||  || 2 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Emily Whiting ||  || 2 ||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|Abbie Whybrow ||  || 2 || Wicket-keeper; Dual-registration with Buckinghamshire\n|}\nSeasons\nWomen's Twenty20 Cup\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Division\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"8\" | League standings\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | P\n! scope=\"col\" | W\n! scope=\"col\" | L\n! scope=\"col\" | T\n! scope=\"col\" | A/C\n! scope=\"col\" | NRR\n! scope=\"col\" | Pts\n! scope=\"col\" | Pos\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2021\n| North\n| 8 || 1 || 5 || 0 || 2 || –0.92 || 6 || 5th\n| style=\"background: white;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2022\n| Group 1\n| 6 || 3 || 3 || 0 || 0 || –0.52 || 12 || 5th\n| style=\"background: white;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2023\n| Group 1\n| 6 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 6 || +0.00 || 6 || 5th\n| style=\"background: white;\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2024\n| Group 1\n| 7 || 2 || 2 || 0 || 3 || +0.38 || 37 || 6th\n| style=\"background: white;\" |\n|}\nECB Women's County One-Day\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Group\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"8\" | League standings\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | P\n! scope=\"col\" | W\n! scope=\"col\" | L\n! scope=\"col\" | T\n! scope=\"col\" | A/C\n! scope=\"col\" | BP\n! scope=\"col\" | Pts\n! scope=\"col\" | Pos\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2024\n| Group 1\n| 4 || 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 6 || 6th\n| style=\"background: white;\" |\n|}\nSee also\n* Durham Women cricket team\n* Northumberland Women cricket team\n* North Representative XI\n* Durham County Cricket Club\n* Northumberland County Cricket Club\n* Northern Diamonds\nReferences"
