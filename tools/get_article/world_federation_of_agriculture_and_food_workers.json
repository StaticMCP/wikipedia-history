Originally named the \"World Federation of Agriculture and Food Workers\", it later changed its official name to the World Federation of Agriculture, Food, Hotel and Allied Workers, but its older name remained in common use, and it retained its FEMTAA acronym.\nIn 2006, the WCL merged into the new International Trade Union Confederation, and FEMTAA dissolved, its former affiliates mostly joining the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations.\nThe federation had three regional affiliates, the Pan-African Federation of Agricultural and Food Workers, the Federation of Agricultural Workers in Latin America, and the Asian Professional Federation of Mixed Industries.\nGeneral Secretaries\n:1996: José Gómez Cerda\n:2004: Timothee T.
