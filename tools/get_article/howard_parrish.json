He was then appointed as the commander of the 6th Port Headquarters, bringing the first large contingent of service troops to Casablanca. They landed on 19 November 1942.  While the two port battalions, 382nd and 384th, did not have experience or training working on a water front, within a short time they began working.  The 6th Port operated directly under Col. Walter J. Muller, General Patton's G-4 of the Western Task Force. Officers of General Patton's staff issued direct orders to 6th Port officers, which Col. Parrish considered it to not be in the general order of command, which created some friction between Muller and Parrish.  On December 2, 1942, Muller put Colonel Tank in charge of port operations with Parrish remaining until January 1943.  Col. Parrish questioned and protested this order, and appealed it to the higher command, the Chief of Transportation.  While the protest did not result in any changed in his favor, in December 1945, Parrish was renamed commander of the 6th Port.\nIn 1943, Parrish received the Legion of Merit \"for exceptional meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding service\" while serving in North Africa.\nPersonal\nColonel Parrish had one son, Howard Parrish Jr., who attended George Tech.\nReferences"
