Advancing through Ages does not happen at the Town Center but by constructing Landmarks.\nBuildings\nMost civilizations have the same roster of buildings:\n* Economic - Farm, House, Lumber Camp, Mill, Mining Camp, Market, Town Center\n* Military - Archery Range, Barracks, Dock, Siege Workshop, Stable\n* Technology - Blacksmith, University/Madrasa\n* Defensive - Keep, Outpost, Palisade Wall, Palisade Gate, Stone Wall, Stone Wall Gate, Stone Wall Tower\n* Religious - Monastery, Mosque, Prayer Tent\n* Wonder\nCivilizations have replacement buildings which fill the same role differently and are available to only that civilization. They may also have unique buildings.\nLandmarks\nIn addition, every civilization with the exception of the Abbasid Dynasty, Ayyubids, and Knights Templar have four landmarks (the starting town center plus one each in Feudal, Castle, and Imperial Ages). Each landmark is special in its own way and building any one advances them to the next Age.\nThe Chinese are unique in that they can build both of their landmarks to enable a Dynasty. The Abbasid Dynasty has a single landmark, the House of Wisdom, with the option of four wings that can be researched in any order. Researching any wing will cause advancement to the next age, except the fourth wing which can be researched but does not advance them to a fifth age. Similarly, the Ayyubids, a variant civilization of the Abbasid Dynasty, can choose from one of two options for each wing when advancing to the next age in the House of Wisdom. Knights Templar are also unique in having only a single landmark, the starting town center, being the only civilization to advance to the next age via researching it in their starting town center.\nDevelopment\nOn August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced Age of Empires IV, developed by Relic Entertainment. Microsoft's Executive Vice-president of Gaming, Phil Spencer, confirmed on June 11, 2019, that Age of Empires IV was still in development, with more information coming later in 2019. On November 14, 2019, gameplay footage of Age of Empires IV was shown at the X019 event. It showed medieval warfare between English and Mongol forces. On March 16, 2021, the fan preview was released, showing more detailed gameplay and also including the two other known civilizations, the Chinese and the Delhi Sultanate. Microsoft announced at E3 2021 that the game will be released on Game Pass for PC on October 28, 2021. The game released on October 28, 2021, having been developed using the Essence Engine.\nSoundtrack\nThe game's voiceovers were recorded using historical pronunciation of each language. In-game music was written by Dynamedion composers Tilman Sillescu (main theme, menu music, trailers, Mongols, Holy Roman Empire), Alexander Röder (Chinese, English, Ottomans), Henning Nugel (Rus', Abbasid, Malians, Byzantines), Armin Haas (Delhi Sultanate, Malians), Christian Wirtz (Ottomans, Byzantines), Nicolai Patricio (Japanese), Dominik Morgenroth (Japanese) and also Mikolai Stroinski (French).

Game Informer liked the history videos between missions, but criticized how the game didn't seem to innovate on the formula of its predecessor, feeling that Age of Empires IV \"lacks any ambition to even gently jostle the standards set by Age of Empires II decades earlier\". Hayes Madsen of CGMagazine summed up his 10/10 review by saying \"Age of Empires IV is a bold and ambitious evolution of the series, and quite likely one of the best RTS games ever made.\"\nThe Washington Post enjoyed the campaign balancing describing it as how \"Every battle feels like it could tip any way at any moment\" and that there was a \"magic to this design\". VG247 felt that the game's commitment to historical accuracy set it apart from its strategy game peers \"making Age of Empires 4 more than just another medieval combat simulator\". PCGamesNs Ian Boudreau praised the Art of War tutorials, saying they were \"hugely helpful for new players who want to understand the nuts and bolts of successful economy management\".\nRobert Zak of PC Gamer felt the distinct civilizations were the fourth entry's greatest triumph, calling \"the visual and strategic\" variety \"one of the most significant evolutions in the series\". He criticized how he felt the game whitewashed history, saying its \"squeaky-clean presentation skirts around the ickier parts of history\". Polygon felt the simplifications from Age of Empire IIs mechanics benefited the game, saying that the changes led \"its complications [to] come more from decision-making and strategy than from the minute details of mechanical plays\". Darryn Bonthuys of GameSpot called the game \"satisfying\", praising the historically educational campaign as well as the uniqueness of the factions. He criticized the dated visuals and the lack of innovation regarding the standard Age of Empires formula, saying that the game \"rarely ventures out of its comfort zone\".\nAwards and accolades\nAge of Empires IV won the award for \"Best Sim/Strategy Game\" at The Game Awards 2021. It also won the award for \"Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year\" at the 25th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://discord.gg/t3Wh5kSnaa Official Discord]\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe4/ Reddit]"
