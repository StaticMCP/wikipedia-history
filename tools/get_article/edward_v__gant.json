He joined UConn in 1942 and was promoted to full professor of civil engineering in 1947.\nFrom 1957 through 1974, Gant held various positions, including assistant dean and acting dean of the School of Engineering, acting head of the civil engineering department, and provost and academic vice president. He stepped down as provost in 1974 to return to full-time teaching. He worked at UConn for a total of forty-three years. In addition to these leadership roles, Gant chaired the Mansfield Board of Education from 1949 to 1953.\nThe Edward V. Gant Building, a  science building on UConn's main campus in Storrs, is named in his honor. The Edward Victor Gant Scholarship for graduate and undergraduate students was established in his honor.\nGant died in 1985. He was survived by his wife, Margaret Regen Gant, who died in 2001, and their two children.\nReferences"
