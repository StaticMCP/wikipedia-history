It has both a national organization and chapters in individual states. In 2025, Politico released over 2,900 pages of messages from a Young Republicans group chat that included racist, anti-Semitic and violent rhetoric. This led to the removal and firing of several high-ranking leaders of the organization, including some who held political positions or worked for elected officials.\nAlthough frequently confused, the YRNF is separate from the College Republicans.\nYoung Republican clubs are both social and political in nature. Many of them sponsor various social events and networking events for members. In addition, Young Republican clubs assist Republican political candidates and causes.\nHistory\nAlthough Young Republican organizations existed as early as 1856 with the founding of the New York Young Republican Club, the Young Republican National Federation was formed by George H. Olmsted at the urging of Herbert Hoover. The YRNF was officially founded in 1931.\n2025 Telegram chat leaks\nIn October 2025, Politico reported on 2,900 pages of leaked Telegram chats from high-ranking Young Republicans leaders nationwide. The chats spanned more than seven months. Many participants work in government or party politics, including Vermont state senator Samuel Douglass and U.S. Small Business Administration adviser Michael Bartels. The chats caused bipartisan controversy and condemnation due to racist and antisemitic slurs, white supremacist slogans and symbols, comments encouraging rape of political opponents to cause suicide, praise for Adolf Hitler, promotion of gas chambers, and enthusiasm for Republicans who they believed supported slavery.\nSee also\n* College Republicans\n* The New York Young Republican Club\n* Republican Party (United States)\n* Republicans Overseas\n* Teen Age Republicans\n* Turning Point USA\n* Young Democrats of America\nFootnotes\nFurther reading\n* Jon Grinspan, \"'Young Men for War': The Wide Awakes and Lincoln's 1860 Presidential Campaign,\" Journal of American History, vol. 96, no. 2, (Sept. 2009), pp.&nbsp;357–378.
