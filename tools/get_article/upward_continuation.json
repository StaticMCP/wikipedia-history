This technique is commonly used to merge different measurements to a common level so as to reduce scatter and allow for easier analysis.\nSee also\n*Petroleum geology\nReferences\n*[https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/u/upward_continuation Upward Continuation in Schlumberger's Oilfield Glossary]\n*[https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/d/downward_continuation Downward Continuation in Schlumberger's Oilfield Glossary]\n\n---\n\n## Upward Continuation\n\n#REDIRECT upward continuation"
