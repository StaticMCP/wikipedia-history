He was a close friend of the Sun family, and when Sun Jian was involved in his campaigns, Zhang Hong served him as a privy adviser. In the days of Sun Ce, Zhang Hong was often responsible for writing official memorials and essays to Emperor Xian and Cao Cao. After Sun Ce's death, he was sent to serve Cao Cao, and then was later sent by Cao Cao to monitor Sun Quan's activities. Zhang Hong, however, remained loyal to Sun Quan, and on his deathbed, petitioned Sun Quan to develop the city of Moling (present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu), which ultimately became the imperial capital of the state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period.\nSee also\n* Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms\nReferences\nGeneral references\n* Chen, Shou (3rd century).
