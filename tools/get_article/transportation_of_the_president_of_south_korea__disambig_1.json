Because of their role as commander-in-chief they exclusively use military transports for international travel. However, the civilian Presidential Security Service operates the president's motorcade.\nAircraft\nSince 2010, whenever the president is on board a military flight its call sign is Code One. Also, a highly modified Boeing 747-8 has served as the current Code One. Its lease comes to an end in 2020 where the presidential bidding process will begin.\nSince 2007, three highly modified Sikorsky S-92 have served as the presidential helicopters. These are used to take the president and his family from the Blue House to Seoul Air Base, where Code One is stationed, and where it takes off from; and it takes the president around the country for various official engagements.\nAutomobiles\nThe presidential state car is a highly modified 2018 Hyundai Nexo SUV first introduced in 2019 of which it is operated by the civilian Presidential Security Service.
