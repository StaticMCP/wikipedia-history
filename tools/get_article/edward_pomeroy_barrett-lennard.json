He was the fifth son of Sir Thomas Barrett-Lennard, 1st Baronet, and Dorothy St. Aubyn. His paternal grandfather was the 17th Baron Dacre.\nBarrett-Lennard arrived at the Swan River Colony on board the  on 23 August 1829 bringing with him six servants, farm animals, and equipment. He was allotted a relatively large grant of  and quickly established a property in the virgin bushland in the West Swan Area near Guildford which he named ''St Leonard's''.\nIn December 1829, the Lieutenant-Governor, James Stirling appointed him, along with five other prominent settlers, a Justice of the Peace.\nHe returned to England in 1836 where he married Elizabeth Frances Graham on 28 September 1837. They returned to Western Australia on the Montreal on 2 May 1839 with their first child and Barrett-Lennard's nephew, Edmund Thomas Barrett-Lennard, whose descendants lived at Beverley, Western Australia.\nOn 4 May 1840, Barrett-Lennard replaced William Locke Brockman as one of the four nominee positions on the Western Australian Legislative Council. He only held the position until the following year before resigning, possibly due to a fire which destroyed the St. Leonards homestead in 1841.\nHe and his wife had seven children, two of them dying young, and in 1854, she returned to England with the four youngest children to ensure their education and never returned. Of the remaining children, only one, Edward Graham Barrett-Lennard, remained in Western Australia and survived to marry and have children locally.\nAt his peak, Barrett-Lennard's holdings comprised 16,000 acres (65&nbsp;km2) of freehold land with a horse stud and cattle holdings. He also imported merino sheep. However, much of his assets were on borrowed money and by 1866 he was bankrupt. After selling his properties to his son's wife's family, he lived out his final years alone on the St. Leonards property in relatively poor circumstances.\nHe is buried at All Saints Church in Upper Swan.\nReferences\n*\n*"
