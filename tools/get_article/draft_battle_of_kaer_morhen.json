It marked a turning point in the conflict between Cirilla (Ciri) and the Wild Hunt, a spectral elven cavalry from another world known as the Aen Elle.\n| combatant2        = The Wild Hunt\n| commander1        = * Geralt of Rivia\n* Vesemir †\n* Yennefer of Vengerberg\n* Triss Merigold\n| commander2        = * Eredin Bréacc Glas\n* Imlerith\n* Caranthir Ar-Feiniel\n| strength1         = * 4 Witchers\n* 2–5 sorcerers (varies by choices)\n* 1 vampire (optional: Emiel Regis)\n* Additional allies (Zoltan, Roche, Letho etc.)\n| strength2         = * Dozens of spectral elven warriors\n* Frost hounds and wraiths\n* Elite generals (Imlerith, Caranthir)\n| casualties1       = * Vesemir (killed)\n* Variable ally losses (depends on game choices)\n| casualties2       = * Dozens of spectral warriors\n* No major generals lost\n| notes             = The battle triggered the full awakening of Ciri's Elder Blood abilities.\n}}\nBackground\nKaer Morhen, the ancient stronghold of the School of the Wolf, was once a center for witcher training but had long since fallen into ruin and disuse by the time of the battle. Despite this, the fortress still served as a safe haven for the few remaining witchers: Vesemir, Geralt of Rivia, Lambert, and Eskel.\nAs the Wild Hunt relentlessly pursued Ciri due to her Elder Blood, Geralt rallied allies to mount a defense at Kaer Morhen. Among those who answered the call were powerful sorceresses like Yennefer of Vengerberg and Triss Merigold, along with warriors like Zoltan Chivay, Vernon Roche, Keira Metz, and even the vampire Emiel Regis (depending on player choices).\nPrelude\nThe defenders spent several days preparing the keep’s defenses with magical wards, traps, potions, and alchemical weapons. Tensions were high as the reality of an interdimensional army bearing down on them became imminent. The Wild Hunt, led by Eredin, intended to capture Ciri to harness her powers to conquer space and time.\nThe Battle\nThe battle began with the Wild Hunt opening portals into the courtyard of Kaer Morhen, unleashing waves of spectral warriors and frost-based magic. While the defenders fought bravely, the sheer power of the Hunt overwhelmed many of their defenses.\nDuring the assault, Vesemir was killed by Imlerith while trying to protect Ciri. His death was a critical moment, causing Ciri to fully awaken her Elder Blood powers, unleashing a devastating energy wave that forced the Wild Hunt to retreat temporarily.\nAftermath\nThe battle, though technically a defensive success, left Kaer Morhen heavily damaged and cost the lives of several key allies, most notably Vesemir. The loss deeply affected Ciri and Geralt and became a rallying point for the coming final confrontation with the Wild Hunt.\nThe conflict shifted the war from passive defense to active pursuit. Ciri, now fully aware of her powers, took the fight to Eredin and his generals.\n----\nReferences\n* Andrzej Sapkowski, The Witcher novels, 1993–2013.\n* CD Projekt Red, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, 2015.\n* Battle of Kaer Morhen, Witcher Wiki, https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Kaer_Morhen"
