Roch Voisine was the host for the ceremonies, which were taped that afternoon for broadcast that evening on CBC Television.\nNominations were announced 8 February 1994. Starting in 1994, the Best New Solo Artist combined the former Most Promising Male and Female Vocalist categories. Reggae also received its own category, after years of being included under banners such as \"world beat\" or mixed with calypso.\nA new category for aboriginal music was also introduced and was awarded by Robbie Robertson. The award faced controversy after nominee Sazacha Red Sky was accused of cultural appropriation by Leonard George son of Chief Dan George, the alleged writer of the song that has since been registered as Public Domain, because she was not personally a member of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation and according to Leonard George did not have the right to record it under their cultural traditions. His son Leonard George sought a legal injunction to prevent the award from being presented at the Juno Awards ceremony at all, and a final compromise revising Red Sky's nomination to reflect the album instead of the song was announced on the morning of the ceremony.\nAround the time of the 1994 ceremonies, there were plans to host the 1995 ceremonies in Winnipeg. However, Juno organisers CARAS was demanding substantial funding from the Winnipeg committee attempting to host the awards.\nAtlantic group The Rankin Family was the major winner in 1994, winning awards in four categories including Entertainer of the Year.\nNominees and winners\nCanadian Entertainer of the Year\nThis award was chosen by a national poll rather than by Juno organisers CARAS.\nWinner: The Rankin Family\nOther Nominees:\n* Barenaked Ladies\n* Celine Dion\n* The Tragically Hip\n* Michelle Wright\nBest Female Vocalist\nWinner: Celine Dion\nOther Nominees:\n* Rita MacNeil\n* Sarah McLachlan\n* Anne Murray\n* Alannah Myles\nBest Male Vocalist\nWinner: Roch Voisine\nOther Nominees:\n* Stef Carse\n* Daniel Lanois\n* John McDermott\n* Snow\nBest New Solo Artist\nWinner: Jann Arden\nOther Nominees:\n* Meryn Cadell\n* Charlie Major\n* Mario Pelchat\n* Jim Witter\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: The Rankin Family\nOther Nominees:\n* Blue Rodeo\n* The Jeff Healey Band\n* Moxy Früvous\n* Rush\nBest New Group\nWinner: The Waltons\nOther Nominees:\n* Junkhouse\n* The Odds\n* Sloan\n* The Tea Party\nSongwriter of the Year\nWinner: Leonard Cohen\nOther Nominees:\n* Jann Arden\n* Jim Cuddy and Greg Keelor\n* Sarah McLachlan\n* Jane Siberry\nBest Country Female Vocalist\nWinner: Cassandra Vasik\nOther Nominees:\n* Joan Kennedy\n* Anne Murray\n* Anita Perras\n* Shania Twain\nBest Country Male Vocalist\nWinner: Charlie Major\nOther Nominees:\n* Joel Feeney\n* George Fox\n* Ron Hynes\n* Jim Witter\nBest Country Group or Duo\nWinner: The Rankin Family\nOther Nominees:\n* The Blue Shadows\n* Cassandra Vasik and Russell deCarle\n* One Horse Blue\n* The Johner Brothers\nBest Instrumental Artist\nWinner: Ofra Harnoy\nOther Nominees:\n* John Arpin\n* André Gagnon\n* Jacques de Koninck\n* Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet\nBest Producer\nWinner: Steven MacKinnon and Marc Jordan, \"Waiting for a Miracle\" from Reckless Valentine by Marc Jordan\nOther Nominees:\n* k.d. lang and Ben Mink, \"Just Keep Me Moving\" by k.d. lang (from Even Cowgirls Get the Blues soundtrack)\n* Daniel Lanois, \"The Messenger\" and \"Mon beau petit choux\" from For the Beauty of Wynona by Daniel Lanois\n* Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart with co-producer Peter Collins, \"Nobody's Hero\" and \"Alien Shore\" from Counterparts by Rush\n* Jane Siberry, \"Temple\" from When I Was a Boy by Jane Siberry\nBest Recording Engineer\nWinner: Kevin Doyle, \"Old Cape Cod\" and \"Cry Me a River\" by Anne Murray\nOther Nominees:\n* Marc Ramaer, \"Just Keep Me Moving\", \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" by k.d. lang\n* Andy Hermant, \"Life on the Inside Track\", \"Sweet Airs That Give Delight\", \"When Daisies Pied\", \"Sweet Airs That Give Delight\" by Stratford Orchestra\n* Stephen Traub, \"Window of Opportunity\" from Bombazine by Meryn Cadell\n* Michael Phillip Wojewoda, \"Beginning of Time\" and \"Calling All Angels\" by Jane Siberry\nCanadian Music Hall of Fame\nWinner: Rush\nWalt Grealis Special Achievement Award\nWinner: John V.
