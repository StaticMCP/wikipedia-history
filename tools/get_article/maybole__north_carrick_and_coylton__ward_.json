Originally a four-member ward, Maybole, North Carrick and Coylton was reduced in size following a boundary review and has elected three councillors since the 2017 South Ayrshire Council election.\nThe ward has been split politically between the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Conservatives with each party taking one seat at every election.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created following the Fourth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2007 Scottish local elections. As a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, local elections in Scotland would use the single transferable vote electoral system from 2007 onwards so Maybole, North Carrick and Coylton was formed from an amalgamation of several previous first-past-the-post wards.\nIt contained all of the former North Carrick and Maybole East ward as well as the majority of the former Coylton and Minishant and North Carrick and Maybole West wards, the northern half of the former Annbank Mossblown St Quivox ward and part of the former South South Carrick wards. The ward runs across the centre of the council area from the Firth of Clyde coast to the council's boundary with East Ayrshire and includes the towns of Maybole and Coylton. Following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections, the ward's northern boundary was moved north and an area around Maidens, Turnberry and Kirkoswald was transferred to the Girvan and South Carrick ward. As a result, the ward was reduced from a four-member ward to a three-member ward.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Mairi Low(SNP)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Brian Connolly(Independent)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Ann Galbreith(Conservative)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Sandra Goldie(Labour)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=3|William Grant(SNP)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2|Ian Campbell(Conservative)\n|colspan=2; rowspan=2\n|-\n!2022\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2012 election\n2007 election\nReferences"
