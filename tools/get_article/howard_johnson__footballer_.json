Born in Sheffield, he played in the Football League for Sheffield United and York City.\nEarly life\nBorn in the Pitsmoor area of Sheffield, Johnson attended the Firth Park Grammar School and later served in the navy.

After making his league debut against Brentford a few days later, Johnson made occasional first-team appearances for his first two seasons. Johnson began make regular appearances during the 1953–54 promotion season but was soon relegated to bit-part status once more as he had to compete with Joe Shaw in central defence.

Despite never really holding down a first team place with Sheffield United, Johnson left the club having made over 100 appearances, scoring one goal.\nAfter leaving Sheffield United, Johnson joined York City where he remained for a further two seasons before joining non-league Denaby United in 1959.\nLater life\nOn retiring from football, Johnson returned to his former career as an accounts clerk and later became a computer systems analyst.\nJohnson died on 15 June 2015.
