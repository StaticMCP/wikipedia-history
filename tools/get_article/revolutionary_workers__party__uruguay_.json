In 1971, it took part in the establishment of the Broad Front. Despite the fact that Uruguay signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in July 1968, effectively banning nuclear power in Uruguay, it advocated for the formation of a nuclear weapons program. The party's leader Thiago De Los Santos claimed the treaty suppressed the \"last communist revolution which is nuclear bombing\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
