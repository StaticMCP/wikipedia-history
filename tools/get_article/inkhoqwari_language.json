It was separated from Khwarshi in the 9th century.\nClassification\nFormerly considered a dialect of Khwarshi, of which it shares many features, they differ in phonology and lexicon to the point of mutual unintelligibility to neighboring peoples. According to linguists, the similarity between the two varieties would be around 91%, which is more than enough for Inkhoqwari to be considered its own language.\nUsage\nInkhoqwari is entirely a spoken language only spoken inside the home, and is unwritten. Yet the Inkhoqwari manage to keep their language and culture as best as they can, as they live far apart from each other in isolated mountain villages.\nInkhoqwari children, like those of neighbouring peoples, spend their first five years at school being taught in Avar, and afterward in Russian.\nIt is difficult to find the amount of speakers but it is believed to be around 700 against 400 Khwarshi.\nDialects\nInkhoqwari has four dialects:\n* Xvaini (spoken in the village of Khvayni)\n* Kvantlada (spoken in the village of Kvantlada)\n* Santlada (spoken in the village of Santlada)\n* Inkhoqwari proper\nThe Kvantlada and Santlada dialects are very close to each other.\nInfluence from other languages\nInkhoqwari has been influenced by Avar, Georgian and Russian. A number of Arabic, Persian and Turkic loanwords have also permeated Inkhoqwari through Avar. Andic, mainly Tindi, words are more frequent in Inkhoqwari than in Khwarshi.\nLexical comparison\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Gloss\n!Inkhoqwari\n!Khwarshi\n|-\n|bull\n|\n|\n|-\n|cow\n|\n|\n|-\n|horse\n|\n|\n|-\n|fox\n|\n|\n|-\n|spider\n|\n|\n|-\n|bee\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Khwarshi language\n* Language or dialect\nReferences"
