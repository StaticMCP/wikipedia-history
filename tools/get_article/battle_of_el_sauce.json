It was the last major battle of the Sandino Rebellion of 1927–1933. The incident has its origins in Nicaraguan President José María Moncada's plan to commemorate the completion of the León–El Sauce railway on 28 December 1932.\nRumors spread that Sandinista rebels planned on crashing the ceremony, so an expedition of eight Marines and 64 Nicaraguan National Guardsmen led by Captain Lewis B. \"Chesty\" Puller were sent by train towards El Sauce on the 26 December 1932 to secure the area. Meanwhile, a Sandinista force led by Juan Pablo Umanzor was looting a construction company commissary. As the Marines'/National Guard's train passed some ancient ruins, it was fired upon by rebels from both sides of the tracks.\nSoldiers led by Puller exited the train on the right side, while those following First Lieutenant William A. Lee got out on the left side of the tracks. Lee's men soon took cover in a ditch while Puller's forces \"tried to turn Umanzor's left flank.\" During the firefight, Corporal Bennie M. Bunn grabbed a Browning automatic rifle and began driving the Sandinistas back. After one hour and ten minutes, the battle concluded with victory for the Marines and National Guard. Thirty-one Sandinista corpses were found after the battle (and 63 live horses were captured), compared to losses of three killed and three wounded for the Guard.\nMoncada got to participate in the ceremony two days later, as planned. He was so pleased with American performance during the battle that he promoted Puller to major and Lee to captain.\nReferences"
