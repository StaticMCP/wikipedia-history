Romantic Warriors&nbsp;II: Special Features DVD is a 2013 documentary film and an addendum to the 2012 feature-length documentary Romantic Warriors&nbsp;II: A Progressive Music Saga About Rock in Opposition. The film was written and directed by Adele Schmidt and José Zegarra Holder, and was released in the United States by Zeitgeist Media. It was generally well received by critics, with a reviewer at AllMusic saying that it \"is a showcase for tremendous musicianship and a must-have for existing [Rock in Opposition] fans\".\nThe Special Features DVD consists of additional material filmed during the making of, but not used in, the original Romantic Warriors&nbsp;II. Unlike its predecessor, the DVD is not narrated, and features 60 minutes of live performance videos by eight of the bands that appear in the original film, followed by 40 minutes of additional interview clips of people interviewed in the first Romantic Warriors&nbsp;II.\nReception\n| rev2 = Babyblaue Seiten\n| rev2Score = recommended\n}}\nDave Lynch at AllMusic welcomed the one hour's worth of live performance videos on the Special Features DVD, which he said made up for the \"short performance snippets\" in the original documentary. He was impressed by the music, particularly Yugen's \"Becchime\", which he called \"astounding\". Lynch said that the DVD \"is a showcase for tremendous musicianship and a must-have for existing [Rock in Opposition] fans\", but added that for context \"the uninitiated should probably experience the original Romantic Warriors&nbsp;II first\".\nAchim Breiling wrote in a review at Babyblaue Seiten that the performances on the Special Features DVD shows how Rock in Opposition as a style of music has diversified since the movement was formed in the late 1970s. He said that the DVD is a great and very informative (\"großartige und sehr aufschlussreiche\") addition to the Romantic Warriors series.\n}}\nExternal links\n*[https://www.progdocs.com/special-features/ Official site]"
