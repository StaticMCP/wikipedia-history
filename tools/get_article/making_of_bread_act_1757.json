It was introduced after a report accused bakers of using alum, chalk and powdered bones to keep bread white.\nBackground\n, saving the loaves, and dividing the fishes by James Gillray]]\nIn England, the regulation of bread was often a priority for the English – and later British – governments since at least the thirteenth century. Prior to the mid-eighteenth century, selling underweight bread was a punishable offence, and thus sometimes stones were used to increase the weight of bread to avoid the regulation.\nAs white bread became preferable, so did the adding of alum. The concept that a baker could add chalk or bone triggered a riot in Manchester. Making white bread meant discarding part of the edible wholegrain, and which was discouraged during times of food shortage. Bakers in 1735 complained about the poor quality of flour they received. Traditionally an exporter of wheat, after 1750, England began importing it, with the consequence of rising prices of bread.\nThe originating bill was introduced after a report accused bakers of using alum lime, chalk and powdered bones to keep bread white, and was passed and published in 1757.\nThe act\nThe act aimed to protect the making of bread and punish those that adulterated it. It generally related to London, with the aim of changing people's behaviour in bread consumption. In order to persuade bakers to make and sell household bread, the act abolished the traditional White and Wheaten grades.\nEffects\nThe act had little effect on eating habits in London, with respect to bread, and people continued to prefer the old Wheaten bread to the new household type.\nSee also\n*Making of Bread, etc. Act 1800\n*Assize of Bread and Ale\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
