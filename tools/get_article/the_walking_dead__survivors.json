The game was released for iOS and Android platforms on April 12, 2021.\nGameplay\nThe Walking Dead: Survivors puts players in charge of a settlement of survivors, surrounded by walkers and rival factions. Players need to strategize the expansion of their settlements by managing resources, armies, and exploration.\nPlayers rebuild a safe place to welcome characters from the comics (Rick, Michonne) and new characters. Each survivor has their own set of skills. Players will decide the best ways to use those particular skills: producing food, clearing up groups of Walkers, leading armies.\nPlayers train and upgrade armies and assign a leader before setting out on different missions across the world map: loot or occupy production farms, explore new locations, clear an area or attack another player base.\nPlayers clear the fog around their settlements to discover a world ravaged by walkers. Exploring is crucial to continue the story, unlock new locations, characters, items, and resources. Upgrading the settlement, survivors, skills, and armies are necessary to explore further as the threats get stronger.\nThe settlement is under a constant threat from walkers trying to breakthrough. As a result, players need to build up and strengthen their settlement walls. However, upgrading defenses require increasing amounts of resource; players need to maximize their production to protect their settlement faster.\nHordes of walkers will often attack the settlement, and players must place defense towers and assign their best Survivors to ensure the walkers do not breakthrough. During the walker attack, players choose when and where to use their survivor skills, gear, and traps for maximum effect.\nEach player can join or create a clan in the game. After players team up, each Clan can build several buildings spread out across the region to gain more territory and wage war against Negan. Once a Clan is joined, the player gains access to many benefits and features:\n*Clan members can fight together or reinforce each other during battle, and will always have a better chance of winning battles when fighting alongside clanmates.\n*Clan members can help reduce building or healing times, and can be helped as well and gain solo points for helping them\n*The player can send/receive resources from and to Clan members.\n*Generate additional resources based on Clan size and territory.\n*Player can make friends in-game using game-chat or clan function.\nGame modes\nThe mission is to survive and fight the walkers in multiple different game modes in the game.
