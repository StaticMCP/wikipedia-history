It was written and produced by Pink and Billy Mann. The song is an open letter to the then-President of the United States, George W. Bush, criticizing several areas of his administration and terms in office, including the Iraq War, No Child Left Behind Act, opposition to same-sex marriage and LGBT rights in general, perceived lack of empathy for poor and middle-class citizens, and his drinking and drug usage in college. Pink felt that it was one of the most important songs she had ever written.\nCritically acclaimed, \"Dear Mr. President\" was released as the sixth and final international single from I'm Not Dead'' on April 2, 2007, by LaFace Records. A commercial success, it peaked atop the charts in Austria and Belgium, while reaching the top five in Australia, the Czech Republic, Germany and Switzerland.\nCritical response\n\"Dear Mr. President\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Entertainment Weekly's Chris Williams described the song \"with its incongruous folkie social concern and Bush-baiting applause lines.\" The Los Angeles Times Natalie Nichols said that Pink taps her inner Ani DiFranco on the confrontational \"Dear Mr. President\". The New York Times Jon Pareles noted that the song is \"well meaning\", \"hectoring\" and that it \"grow[s] even more sententious\". PopMatters praised the single with long overview:  }} Rolling Stone's Barry Walters praises Pink for \"writ[ing] a scathing letter in 'Dear Mr. President and \"cooing righteous folk harmonies with Indigo Girls.\" Sal Cinquemani was mixed, writing that Dear Mr. President', which cleverly uses George W. Bush's own words against him, pales next to Missundaztood's 'My Vietnam.\nFormats and track listings\nDigital Single\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" – 4:33\n#\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\" – 3:18\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" [Live from Wembley Arena] – 4:45\n#\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\" [Live] – 4:44\n'''UK Collector's Set CD1'''\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" – 4:33\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" [Live from Wembley Arena] – 4:45\n#\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\" [Live] – 4:44\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" [Video] – 5:00\n'''UK Collector's Set CD2'''\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" – 4:33\n#\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\" – 3:18\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" [Live] – 4:45\n#\"Live From Wembley Trailer\" [Video] – 0:59\n'''Germany Collector's Set CD1'''\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" – 4:33\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" [Live from Wembley Arena] – 4:45\n#\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\" – 3:18\n#\"Live From Wembley Trailer\" [Video] – 0:59\n'''Germany Collector's Set CD2\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" – 4:33\n#\"Who Knew\" [Live From Wembley Arena] – 3:29\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" [Live from Wembley Arena] – 4:45\nAustralian Tour Collector's Set CD1\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" – 4:33\n#\"Who Knew\" [Live From Wembley Arena] – 3:30\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" [Live From Wembley Arena] – 4:45\n#\"On The Road With Pink\" [Video] – 10:00\nAustralian Tour Collector's Set CD2\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" – 4:33\n#\"U + Ur Hand\" [Live From Wembley Arena] – 4:39\n#\"Dear Mr. President\" [Video] – 5:00\n#\"Live From Wembley Trailer\" [Video] – 1:00\nRemixes'\n#Offer Nissim Club Mix\n#Offer Nissim Radio Edit\nPersonnel\n*Vocals: Pink and Indigo Girls\n*Backing vocals: Emily Saliers and Amy Ray\n*Mixed by: Al Clay\n*Pro Tools: Christopher Rojas\n*Guitar: Emily Saliers\n*Production coordinator: Lana Israel\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2006–2009)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| European Hot 100 Singles (Billboard)\n| 10\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2007)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 41\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40)\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)\n| 16\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| European Hot 100 Singles (Billboard'')\n| 47\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Germany (Media Control GfK)\n| 13\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)\n| 8\n|}\nDecade-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2000–2009)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Austria (Ö3 Austria Top 40)\n| 51\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Release dates and formats for \"Dear Mr. President\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Label(s)\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom\n| April 2, 2007\n| Digital download\n| LaFace\n| }}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| Germany\n| April 20, 2007\n| Digital download\n| rowspan=\"4\"| Sony BMG\n| }}\n|-\n| April 27, 2007\n| CD\n| }}\n|-\n| May 18, 2007\n| Maxi CD\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia\n| July 7, 2007\n| CD\n| }}\n|}\nSee also\n*List of anti-war songs\n*Commander in Chief (song)\nReferences"
