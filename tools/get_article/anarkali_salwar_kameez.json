It varies in length and embroidery such as floor-length and usually ends up at the knees. Anarkali suits owe their name to the legendary Anarkali, a courtesan in the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar. According to the legend, she was murdered for her illicit relationship with Crown Prince Salim, who later became Emperor Jahangir. The word anarkali translates to the \"delicate bud of the pomegranate flower/tree.\" This name signifies the qualities of softness, vulnerability, innocence, and beauty associated with the women who wore anarkalis. This dress is generally worn by Kathak dancers. With the development, the mid-length and floor-length anarkali became popular. It is known for its long, flowing kurtas that beautifully complement every woman's look.\nTypes\nThe following are some of the different types of Anarkali Suits:\n#Floor-Length Anarkali Suits\n#Cape Anarkali Suits\n#Jacket Anarkali Suits\n#Layered Anarkali Suits\n#Gown Style Anarkali Suits\n#Palazzo Anarkali Suit\n#Churidar Anarkali Suit\nSee also\n* Shalwar kameez\nReferences"
