Founded in 2002 by Doug Levin, it develops and markets software and services for application security.\nHistory\nBlack Duck was founded in December 2002 by Doug Levin. In 2017, eight years after raising $38.5 million in venture capital funding, the firm raised $75.5 million.\nWhen acquired by Synopsys for $565 million in 2017 and becoming part of the \"Synopsys Software Integrity Group\", the firm was combined with several other Synopsys acquisitions, such as code analysis company Coverity, interactive application security testing software Seeker, Cigital, and Codiscope.\nIn 2024, the Synopsys Software Integrity Group was sold to private equity firms Clearlake Capital Group and Francisco Partners for $2.1 billion. The new owners rebranded the company back to its original \"Black Duck Software\" namesake.\nProducts\nBlack Duck provides software and services for software development security testing. The company initially focused on software that identified usage of open-source code and determined corresponding security and licensing risks. Over time, it expanded to various application security tools and services related to training, support, and development, for developers. In 2024, it also began using generative artificial intelligence to identify potential security risks for customers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
