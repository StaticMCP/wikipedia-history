It is a two-story hip-roofed Colonial Revival house, with a balustrade on the roof, pedimented gable dormers, and an elliptical fanlight in the central bay window on the second floor.  It was built about 1915 by Morton Swallow, about whom nothing is known.  The President's Hill area originally belonged to the Adams political family.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Quincy, Massachusetts\nReferences"
