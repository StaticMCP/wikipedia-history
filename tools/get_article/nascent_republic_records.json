The label was formed to give recording freedom to the artists without the pressure of someone telling them they had to sound a certain way.  There are four artists on the roster: Joey Barnes (formerly of Daughtry, 2006–2010), Patrick Rock, Stephen von Heyking, and Courtney Smith. Former artist J Timber was signed to the label from 2010 to 2011.\nDiscography\n*Always by Joey Barnes - March 2009\n*When All Else Fails... by Patrick Rock- March 2009\n*Last Request by Joey Barnes - June 2009\n*Change by Joey Barnes - November 2009\n*Self-Titled by J Timber- May 2010\n*Lips that Taste of Tears by Courtney Smith- November 2010\n*Last Christmas by Joey Barnes - December 2010\nMusic videos\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
