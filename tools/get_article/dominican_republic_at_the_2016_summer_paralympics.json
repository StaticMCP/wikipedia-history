Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.\nAthletics\n;Men's Track\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Events\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-\n!Time\n!Rank\n!Time\n!Rank\n!Time\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left rowspan=2|Joselito Hernandez(Guide – Bizmark Volquez Diaz)\n|align=left|100 m T11\n|11.73\n|2\n|colspan=4|did not advance\n|-align=center\n|align=left|200 m T11\n|24.38\n|3\n|colspan=4|did not advance\n|}\nCycling\nWith one pathway for qualification being one highest ranked NPCs on the UCI Para-Cycling male and female Nations Ranking Lists on 31 December 2014, the Dominican Republic qualified for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, assuming they continued to meet all other eligibility requirements.\nRoad\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!Athlete\n!Event\n!Time\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left rowspan=2|José Frank Rodríguez\n|align=left|Men's road time trial C5\n|42:44.57\n|13\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Men's road race C4-5\n|2:27:07\n|16\n|}\nTrack\n;Pursuits and time trials\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Qualification\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-\n!Time\n!Rank\n!OppositionTime\n!Rank\n|- align=center\n|align=left rowspan=2|José Frank Rodríguez\n|align=left|Men's 1000m time trial C4-5\n|colspan=\"2\"\n|1:14.427\n|19\n|- align=center\n|align=left|Men's individual pursuit C5\n|5:27.010\n|11\n|colspan=2|did not advance\n|}\nSee also\n*Dominican Republic at the 2016 Summer Olympics\nReferences"
