It is the result of a collaboration between Square Enix and Disney Interactive Studios, and is a crossover of various Disney settings based in a universe made specifically for the series. The series features Disney, Final Fantasy, The World Ends with You,'' and Pixar characters, as well as several original characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which includes many Disney characters' official voice actors.\nThe series centers on Sora, his friends, and their encounters with various Disney and Final Fantasy characters along the way. Players primarily control Sora, though there are numerous characters that join his party as computer controlled members. Most characters were introduced in the original game Kingdom Hearts, with subsequent installments featuring new original, Disney, and Final Fantasy characters. Dream Drop Distance introduces characters from Square Enix's The World Ends with You, while Kingdom Hearts III introduces characters from Pixar franchises.\nVarious types of merchandise modeled after the characters' likeness have been produced, including figurines and jewelry. The characters have garnered praise from several video game websites and magazines for the quality of their voice acting and visual style. Comments have focused on the accurate presentation of Disney characters, the unique visual style of Square Enix characters, how well all the characters blend together, and the consistent quality performances from voice actors.\nCreation and influences\nThe Kingdom Hearts series is directed by Tetsuya Nomura, who is also the games' character designer. Nomura has stated that unlike working with Final Fantasy characters, keeping the main character Sora alive and interesting over multiple games is a challenge. He also stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics. Though Disney gave Nomura freedom in the characters and worlds used for the games, he and his staff tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds. When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting.\nThe inclusion of specific Final Fantasy characters was based on the opinions of fans and the development staff. Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design because he was unfamiliar with the background of such characters. For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura did this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He stated that with speculation, even though a game may get old, people can still be happy with it.\nMain original characters\nSora\n:\n:Young Sora\n:\nis the main protagonist of the Kingdom Hearts series, and the sole playable character in the original game. He is portrayed as a cheerful 14-year-old boy who lives on the Destiny Islands with his childhood friends Riku and Kairi. When the Islands are attacked by creatures of darkness known as the Heartless, Sora comes into possession of a weapon of light called the Keyblade, and he embarks on a journey alongside Donald Duck and Goofy to protect other worlds from the Heartless, Nobodies, and other forces of evil. Nomura has stated that Sora's name can be interpreted as \"sky\", as the Japanese word for sky is .\nRiku\n:\n:Young Riku\n:\nis a childhood friend and rival of Sora who resides with him and Kairi on the Destiny Islands. He originally appeared as a non-playable character in the original game, where he is introduced as a 15-year-old boy, and has a playable role in the \"Reverse/Rebirth\" story mode of Chain of Memories, the multiplayer mode of 358/2 Days, and the core story of Dream Drop Distance. He is also a computer-controlled party member in the final level of Kingdom Hearts II, and is temporarily playable during a sequence where Sora is incapacitated in the game's final boss battle. Riku is also briefly playable at several points in the \"Dark World\" in Kingdom Hearts III and in its Re Mind expansion. His signature weapon is the \"Soul Eater\" sword, a manifestation of the darkness in his heart. During the first game, Riku is revealed to be the rightful owner of Sora's Keyblade, which Terra bequeathed to him during the events of Birth by Sleep; however, his reliance on the power of darkness caused the Keyblade to reject Riku in favor of Sora. In Kingdom Hearts II, where Riku is now 16 years old, he acquires another Keyblade of his own, the \"Way to the Dawn\"; this Keyblade is later broken in Kingdom Hearts III, leading him to obtain a new Keyblade, \"Braveheart\".\nRiku also appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit.\nKairi\n:\n:Young Kairi\n:\nis the main female protagonist of Kingdom Hearts and Sora and Riku's best friend. She is a non-playable character in most games, but debuts as a playable character in the Re Mind scenario of Kingdom Hearts III. As one of the seven Princesses of Heart, she was cast adrift from her homeworld of Radiant Garden at a young age as part of Xehanort's experiment to locate the key bearer, which eventually brings her to the Destiny Islands, piquing Sora and Riku's interest in other worlds. Birth by Sleep reveals that her arrival on the islands was the result of an encounter with Aqua, who gives the four-year-old Kairi a protective charm to shield her from the darkness; Kairi gains the ability to wield a Keyblade after touching Aqua's Keyblade.\nDuring Kingdom Hearts, where Kairi is 14 years old, her heart is stolen by darkness bugs commanded by Ansem, sending her body into a coma while her heart takes refuge within Sora. Upon learning her of identity as a Princess of Heart and the location of her heart, Sora sacrifices his own heart to release hers and allow it to return to her body. While Sora disappears, Kairi escapes from a revived Ansem along with Donald Duck and Goofy. Soon after, Kairi finds Sora's Heartless and restores him to human form. Kairi later remains behind on the restored Destiny Islands to await Sora's return from his journey. In Kingdom Hearts II, Axel approaches Kairi and asks her to come with him, but she flees with help from Pluto and a dark corridor made by Riku. Saïx soon kidnaps her to motivate Sora towards acting in the Organization's wishes. She escapes with help from Naminé and Riku, who gives her her Keyblade, Destiny's Embrace, to fight alongside Sora, while the former merges with her to become a whole being once again. After Sora and Riku defeat the Organization's leader Xemnas, Kairi reunites with them at Destiny Islands. In Dream Drop Distance, Yen Sid summons her to train as a Keyblade wielder to combat Xehanort's reconfigured Organization XIII. In Kingdom Hearts III, Kairi trains with a reformed Axel in a secret place created by Merlin's magic. After completing her training, she reunites with her friends and shares with Sora a paopu, a legendary fruit that binds the destinies of those who eat it together. Afterwards, she participates in the final battle against Xehanort and Organization XIII, but Xehanort destroys her body to motivate Sora into helping recreate the χ-blade. Following Xehanort's defeat, Sora departs to restore Kairi by using the power of waking; in the final scene of the game, Kairi is shown to have been revived by Sora before he fades away as a consequence of overusing the power. In the \"Limitcut\" episode of Re Mind, Kairi is revealed to be in a deep sleep in Ansem's lab, as Ansem the Wise and his apprentices analyze her heart for clues on Sora's whereabouts. In Melody of Memory, she awakens and is able to deduce with Riku that Sora is in a location outside of their own reality called \"Quadratum\". As Riku departs to save Sora, Kairi stays behind to train with Aqua.\nNomura has stated that Kairi's name can be interpreted as \"sea\", as the on'yomi pronunciation of the Japanese word for \"sea\" is .\nKairi also appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit.\nRoxas\n:\nis the initial player-controlled character of Kingdom Hearts II, who is featured during the game's prologue segment. He is introduced as a youth living in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town, who discovers himself to be Sora's Nobody, having been born when Sora transformed into a Heartless to restore Kairi's heart during the events of the first game. He is also revealed to be a defector from Organization XIII, which sought to utilize his ability to wield the Keyblade. Roxas serves as the main protagonist of Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, which revolves around the circumstances leading to his eventual defection from the Organization. Roxas sacrifices his existence to merge with Sora at the end of Kingdom Hearts IIs prologue, but is restored in a replica body during the events of Kingdom Hearts III.\nAxel / Lea\n:}}|Quinton Flynn}}\nis the Nobody of a Radiant Garden citizen named . He is Organization XIII's resident assassin, entrusted with killing the group's traitors, and the original Organization's eighth member. He has the power to control fire, which he uses to empower his chakrams. He is introduced in Chain of Memories as a double agent under orders to dispatch the traitorous members at Castle Oblivion. He also appears in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days as a mentor for Roxas. The two develop a friendship, and he warns Roxas of the dangers of defecting from the Organization. In Kingdom Hearts II, Axel helps Sora reach The World That Never Was as an apology for kidnapping Kairi, and sacrifices himself to allow Sora to escape. In Dream Drop Distance and Kingdom Hearts III, his restored human self becomes a Keyblade wielder and guardian of light. Axel also appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit.\nXion\n:\nis the de facto fourteenth member of the Organization who is introduced in 358/2 Days. Similar to Roxas, she wields a Keyblade and appears to lack memories of her past. Despite initially appearing to be emotionless and static, she eventually befriends Roxas and Axel and joins them on missions. Xion eventually discovers her true identity as an artificial human \"replica\" created from Sora's memories to duplicate Roxas' powers, which forces her to sacrifice her existence and others' memories of her to protect her friends. She is later revived as the final member of Xehanort's thirteen \"seekers of darkness\" before regaining her original memories and rejoining her friends. Xion also appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit.\nTerra\n:\nis introduced in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep as an apprentice Keyblade wielder who trains alongside Aqua and Ventus at the Land of Departure. Early on in the game, Terra is denied the rank of Keyblade Master when his mentor and father figure, Master Eraqus, detects strong darkness in his heart. Despite initially being disheartened, Terra is given a chance to redeem his failure when he is dispatched to eliminate an insurgence of dark creatures called the Unversed in neighboring worlds. During his journey, the vagabond Master Xehanort appeals to Terra to channel the power of darkness freely, creating a schism between him and his friends as they grow troubled by his actions. This eventually leads Terra to clash with Eraqus when he finds his master inexplicably attacking Ventus, which ends with Xehanort vanquishing the weakened Eraqus. After realizing the conflict was engineered to stimulate his inner darkness, Terra confronts Xehanort at the Keyblade Graveyard and succumbs to rage, allowing Xehanort to transplant his heart into his body to prolong his own life. The process that turns Terra into Terra-Xehanort also transfers his disembodied mind into his discarded armor, which becomes the Lingering Will that defeats Xehanort and remains in the Keyblade Graveyard. Following Terra-Xehanort's battle with Aqua, Terra's heart begins resisting Xehanort with the aid of Eraqus's heart, which is revealed to have entered Terra's own before his apparent death, while Xehanort ends up in an amnesiac state by the time Ansem the Wise took him in as an apprentice.\nTerra appears in Kingdom Hearts Coded alongside other characters who are bound to Sora's heart. He is also mentioned in the secret ending of the remake Re:coded, where Mickey Mouse and Yen Sid discuss his and Ventus' whereabouts following the events of Birth by Sleep. Terra briefly appears in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, first during Sora's dream where Sora's friends, Riku and Kairi, are transformed into Terra and Aqua; and again when Sora declares his pride in being connected to many Keyblade wielders. A vision of Terra appears in Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage, a part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, as Aqua explores the realm of darkness. In Kingdom Hearts III, Terra's restored body appears at the Keyblade Graveyard as one of Xehanort's thirteen \"seekers of darkness\" in his plan to open Kingdom Hearts, serving again as a vessel for Xehanort's heart from the past. The Lingering Will also appears, being summoned by Naminé after Sora uses the power of waking to undo his allies' initial defeat. During Sora, Aqua, and Ventus's battle against Terra-Xehanort, Terra's heart awakens from within Terra-Xehanort's guardian Heartless, the Dark Figure, which aids Sora in banishing Xehanort's heart and restoring Terra to his true self. After reuniting with Aqua and Ventus, and later aiding in keeping Kingdom Hearts closed, Terra releases Eraqus's heart and spirit, who persuades the dying Xehanort to surrender peacefully. Afterwards, Terra and his friends return home before joining their allies in celebration on the Destiny Islands.\nTerra's role in Birth by Sleep is reprised in Tomoko Tanemaki's light novels based on the game. Additionally, the final chapter shows the Lingering Will fighting Sora from Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix.\nTerra also appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit.\nVentus\n:\n, commonly nicknamed , before being introduced in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, camoed in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and its re-release, Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, which depict him and his friends Terra and Aqua battling Master Xehanort and Vanitas. Ventus also makes a cameo appearance in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, when Xion, a replica of Roxas, takes on his appearance while fighting Xigbar. Ventus is also referenced by Xigbar in Kingdom Hearts II and 358/2 Days while Xemnas, the Nobody of Xehanort, searches for him in Castle Oblivion.\nBirth by Sleep introduces Ventus as an apprentice of Master Xehanort, who tries to condition him into a dark component of the χ-blade. Due to Ventus's reluctance to use darkness, Xehanort extracts it from his heart and creates Vanitas, damaging his heart in the process. Xehanort brings Ventus to the Destiny Islands, where his heart connects with a newborn Sora to prevent it from collapsing. An amnesiac Ventus is placed under Master Eraqus's care alongside Terra and Aqua, whom he forms a sibling-like bond with. At the beginning of the game, Vanitas provokes Ventus into pursuing Terra during the latter's search for Xehanort, pitting him against dark creatures called the Unversed to strengthen him. Upon meeting Xehanort, Ventus rediscovers his purpose in the χ-blade's creation. Ventus refuses to battle Vanitas and create the weapon, but is forced to do so after Vanitas threatens his friends. They battle within the Keyblade Graveyard, where Vanitas merges with Ventus and obtains the χ-blade. However, the fusion is incomplete, allowing Ventus to destroy both Vanitas and the χ-blade within his heart, but causing him to lose his heart in the process. Aqua reconfigures the Land of Departure into Castle Oblivion to keep Ventus's catatonic body safe, while his wandering heart finds its way back to Sora, who accepts it into his body.\nVentus makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts Coded, where Mickey Mouse—whom Ventus befriended in the previous game—discovers his heart is connected with Sora's. In Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, Sora briefly takes Ventus's form during a dream, and when his heart is wounded, Ventus's armor appears to protect his body. In the game's ending, Ventus is seen smiling in Castle Oblivion, still asleep. An apparition of Ventus appears in the realm of darkness in Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage, a playable episode included in Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. Kingdom Hearts Union χ, which is set many years before Birth by Sleep, reveals Ventus to have been a member of the Dandelions and one of the five Union leaders chosen after the end of the Keyblade War. Along with the other leaders, he forms Union Cross to prevent history from repeating itself. Ventus returns in Kingdom Hearts III after being restored and reunites with Terra, Aqua, and his Dream Eater partner Chirithy.\nVentus also appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit.\nAqua\n:\nis a Keyblade Master who serves as one of the three playable characters of Birth by Sleep, and the sole playable character of A Fragmentary Passage, a direct sequel bundled with Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue. She is also playable during one fight in Kingdom Hearts III. In gameplay, she is nimble and specializes in magic attacks. As the only one among her friends to achieve the rank of Keyblade Master by the start of the game, Aqua is tasked by Master Eraqus to watch over Terra and retrieve Ventus when he runs away from home. While attempting to protect Ventus and save Terra from Xehanort's control, she becomes trapped in the realm of darkness, where she remains suspended in time throughout the series while fending off the Heartless. In Kingdom Hearts III, Sora rescues her from the realm of darkness, and she joins him in the final battle against Xehanort.\nRecurring original characters\nXehanort\n:Master Xehanort\n:\n:Terra-Xehanort/Ansem, Seeker of Darkness\n:\n:Xemnas\n:\n:Young Xehanort\n:\n}} is the main antagonist of the Dark Seeker Saga, the first phase in the Kingdom Hearts series. He is initially introduced as the original form of the sentient Heartless Ansem and Nobody Xemnas, but is later established to be an elderly Keyblade Master from Destiny Islands who acquired the means to transplant his heart into the bodies of others, which he uses to orchestrate the events of the games up to Kingdom Hearts III as part of his agenda. Throughout the series, Xehanort is driven by an obsessive interest in the Keyblade War, a historic cataclysm that resulted in the universe's present, fragmented state. In Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, he attempts to use the hearts of his pupils Ventus and Vanitas to forge the χ-blade and unlock Kingdom Hearts to incite another war, desiring to create a new world where light and darkness exist in perfect balance. He also transfers his heart into Terra's body to prolong his own life. However, he is defeated through the combined efforts of Ventus, Terra and Aqua, gaining amnesia in the process. In Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, Xehanort returns to his original form following the destruction of Ansem and Xemnas, who are revealed to have been created to reenact his original plan by gathering seven \"guardians of light\" and thirteen \"seekers of darkness\" in the form of the Princesses of Heart and Organization XIII, respectively. He also uses time travel to assemble Ansem, Xemnas, and other versions of himself from across time into a new Organization, sending their hearts into replica bodies to co-exist with their present self. In Kingdom Hearts III, where he is defeated and his past selves are eliminated during a showdown against Sora's group, Xehanort surrenders and allows his heart to pass on together with his former friend Eraqus. Kingdom Hearts χ reveals him to be Ephemer's descendant.\nNaminé\n:\nis first introduced in Chain of Memories, and is revealed in Kingdom Hearts II to be Kairi's Nobody, who was created when Sora released Kairi's heart from within himself during the events of the first game. She has the ability to manipulate the memories of Sora and those close to him, for which she is called a witch. She originates from Castle Oblivion, and is forced by Marluxia to alter Sora's memories so he remembers her as a close friend from Destiny Islands, allowing Marluxia to manipulate him. Axel later lets her escape so she can reveal the truth to Sora, and oversees the year-long process to restore him and his friends' memories to their original state. Naminé also saves Riku in \"Reverse/Rebirth\" from Zexion, disguising herself as Kairi. In Kingdom Hearts II, Naminé visits Roxas in the virtual Twilight Town to help him discover his true identity as Sora's Nobody. She returns in the game's final world to help Kairi escape from the Organization's dungeon, after which she merges with her. In Kingdom Hearts III, Naminé plays a role in summoning the Lingering Will to help Sora against Terra-Xehanort after being temporarily separated from Kairi's heart. After Xehanort destroys Kairi's body, Naminé's heart is released and transferred to a replica body which Riku had provided to Ansem the Wise and his apprentices, allowing her to exist as a separate person.\nOrganization XIII\nis a group created by Xehanort in his plan to acquire the χ-blade. They are introduced as thirteen Nobodies who seek the power of Kingdom Hearts to become complete humans, with Xehanort's Nobody Xemnas ranked first as their leader. With the exception of Xemnas, who uses Ansem's name, each Organization member's name is an anagram of their original self's name with the letter \"X\" inserted. While Nobodies initially lack true emotion and morality, they gradually grow hearts over time. Dream Drop Distance reveals that the Organization's true purpose is to serve as vessels for Xehanort's heart in his plan to forge the χ-blade. A second, \"real\" Organization XIII is assembled from several of the Organization's older members, who willingly return to their Nobody forms, and various incarnations of Xehanort brought from the past using artificial replica bodies. The first Organization's members also serve as computer-controlled party members of 358/2 Days, and are playable in the game's \"Mission Mode\".

He initially appears to be Riku under the influence of darkness, but his true nature is revealed after he battles Sora to protect Naminé, who altered his memories so that he believed himself to be real as part of Marluxia's plan to manipulate Sora. The game's \"Reverse/Rebirth\" story mode depicts Riku's confrontations with his replica, who is eventually destroyed in a fight meant to prove his right to exist after discovering his origins. In Kingdom Hearts III, Riku finds the replica's heart in the realm of darkness and gives it refuge within his own heart. A past version of the replica called \"Dark Riku\" also appears in the game as a member of the real Organization XIII, masquerading as Riku's younger self. After Dark Riku is defeated, Riku Replica sacrifices himself to extract Dark Riku's heart from its vessel, which he provides for Naminé.\nAnsem the Wise\n:\nis the former sage king of Radiant Garden, who first appears in the \"Reverse/Rebirth\" storyline of Chain of Memories as a bandaged figure known as . His true identity is revealed in Kingdom Hearts II, which also reveals the similarly named antagonist to be an impostor. Nine years prior to the first game's events, Ansem studied the darkness in people's hearts for the benefit of his world after taking in an amnesic Terra-Xehanort. After meeting with King Mickey and learning his research may be connected to a crisis happening in other worlds, Ansem ceased his experiments. However, Xehanort secretly continued the experiments under Ansem's name alongside Ansem's other pupils—Braig, Dilan, Even, Aeleus, and Ienzo—who exiled Ansem to a world of nothingness and formed Organization XIII. Ansem disguised himself as DiZ, an acronym for \"Darkness in Zero\", and escaped to exact revenge on the Organization.\nIn Chain of Memories, DiZ guides Riku through Castle Oblivion under the guise of Xehanort's Heartless. Along with Riku and Naminé, DiZ oversees the restoration of Sora, Donald, and Goofy's memories throughout 358/2 Days, moving them from Castle Oblivion to Twilight Town for safekeeping. When Roxas unwittingly begins absorbing Sora's memories, DiZ orders Riku to retrieve Roxas, whom he places inside a simulation of Twilight Town to eventually merge with Sora. In Kingdom Hearts II, DiZ's plans fall apart when Sora does not function as he wants upon awakening. Upon realizing the harm he brought to Sora and his friends, DiZ becomes remorseful and abandons his desire for revenge. Ansem later reveals himself to Mickey at the World That Never Was while attempting to digitally encode Xemnas' Kingdom Hearts within a machine. The hearts overload the machine and cause it to self-destruct, with Ansem allowing himself to be engulfed by the blast to atone for his mistakes.\n''Birth by Sleep's epilogue reveals Ansem to be alive in the realm of darkness, where he relays his intact memories of Sora to Aqua. In Dream Drop Distance'', a digital copy of Ansem appears within Sora's heart to present Riku with research data he has hidden regarding Roxas, Xion, and Ventus's hearts. During the events of Kingdom Hearts III, Ansem is brought back to the realm of light by Xehanort's Heartless to locate one of his former test subjects for the Organization before being rescued by Vexen's intervention. Following Xehanort's defeat, Ansem resumes his role as ruler of Radiant Garden.\nVanitas\n:\nis a Keyblade wielder and antagonist who first appears in Birth by Sleep, created by Master Xehanort from darkness extracted from Ventus's heart as part of his plan to forge the χ-blade. Vanitas was initially faceless at the time of his creation until Ventus connected his heart to the newborn Sora. This made Vanitas closely resemble Sora, albeit with black hair and yellow eyes. He considers Sora as a \"brother\" like Ventus since their connection defined him as a person. Though he aids in Xehanort's scheme, Vanitas acts on his own whims to lure Ventus away from home to strengthen him into his equal to commence their reunion. He also attacks him and his friends with the Unversed manifested from Vanitas's negative emotions. While Vanitas succeeds in merging into Ventus during their final confrontation at the Keyblade Graveyard, their reunion produces an unstable χ-blade, which is destroyed along with Vanitas in a metaphysical battle against Ventus within their combined heart. However, he briefly appears alongside Young Xehanort in Dream Drop Distance in reaction to the presence of Ventus's heart within Sora's. In Kingdom Hearts III, Vanitas is inducted into the real Organization XIII as one of the thirteen seekers of darkness, using a replica body with the intention of reclaiming Ventus's heart. Vanitas returns to his original time upon being defeated for a second time.\nWhile developing Birth by Sleep, Nomura created Vanitas's relationship with Ventus under suggestion from the game's Osaka development team, as he enjoyed the idea of adding more connections between characters. He chose the name \"Vanitas\"—Latin for \"emptiness\"—for its similarity to Ventus's name, and because its Japanese translation, , could be reinterpreted as Sora's name, which means \"sky\". A secret boss based on Vanitas called the  appears in Birth by Sleep.\nEraqus\n:\n:Young Eraqus\n:\nis introduced in Birth by Sleep as one of the few remaining Keyblade Masters alongside Xehanort, and is later revealed to be descended from the Keyblade users that survived the Keyblade War. He is in charge of the Land of Departure and is both a mentor and father figure to Terra, Aqua and Ventus. He is also noted for being biased against the existence of darkness in favor of light, a key factor behind his eventual falling out with Xehanort. Nomura described his relationship with Xehanort as that of old friends and classmates.\nAt the start of Birth by Sleep, Eraqus passes Aqua the Mark of Mastery but denies Terra, basing his decision on the darkness in his heart. He sends Terra and Aqua to deal with the appearance of the Unversed and the disappearance of Master Xehanort and Aqua to retrieve Ventus, fearing that Xehanort will use Ventus to create the χ-blade. When Ventus confronts him over this and confirms his fears, Eraqus attempts to destroy Ventus to foil Xehanort's plan, but is stopped by Terra. After battling with his student, he is struck down by Xehanort and fades away, leaving his Keyblade behind. However, the game's secret ending reveals that Eraqus had hidden his heart within Terra, allowing Terra to resist Xehanort's influence after being possessed by him. Eraqus returns in Kingdom Hearts III, emerging from Terra's restored body and persuading Xehanort to surrender, after which their hearts ascend to the afterlife. Dark Road explores Eraqus's childhood and his friendship with Xehanort leading up to the events of Birth by Sleep.\nEraqus' name is an anagram of \"Square\", referencing series developer company Square Enix, and acting as a parallel to Yen Sid's name being Disney in reverse. He also resembles Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi.
