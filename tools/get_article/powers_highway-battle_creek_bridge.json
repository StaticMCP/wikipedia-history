It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The bridge is a double-intersection Warren truss, a design noted for its extremely lightweight members and low cost. It is the only known example of its type in Michigan.\nHistory\nThe exact history of this bridge is unknown; however, the Michigan Department of Transportation lists a construction date of 1910. The bridge was likely constructed by the township as an inexpensive option.\nThe bridge is closed to traffic.\nDescription\nThe Powers Highway Bridge is a rigid-connected lattice pony truss bridge. It has a  25-foot span and a 15.8 foot-wide roadway on a 16.3-foot wide deck. The deck is constructed of a single layer of wood deck over six steel I-beam stringers and two outside channels. The bridge sits on a masonry abutment substructure.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://historicbridges.org/bridges/browser/photos.php?bridgebrowser=truss/powers/&gallerynum=1&gallerysize=1 Image gallery from HistoricBridges.org]\n* [http://bridgehunter.com/mi/eaton/23303H00006B010/ Information from BridgeHunter]"
