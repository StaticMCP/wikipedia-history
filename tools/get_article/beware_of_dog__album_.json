It was released on September 26, 2000, through So So Def Recordings and Columbia Records. Recording sessions took place from 1999 to 2000, with Lil' Bow Wow's mentor Jermaine Dupri primarily producing the album, and Xscape, Jagged Edge, Da Brat and Snoop Dogg appearing as guests, among others.\nBeware of Dog received generally positive reviews from music critics and was also commercially successful, debuting at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 chart and selling 101,000 copies in the first week. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it double platinum in March 2001.\nSingles\nFour singles were released from the album, all produced by Lil' Bow Wow's mentor and hip-hop record producer Jermaine Dupri.

AllMusic editor Jason Birchmeier praised the tracks for encapsulating the album with endearing charm in its pop-rap material despite doubting Lil Bow Wow's actual writing credits, concluding that \"All the same, there's no denying the charm and vocal dexterity of Lil Bow Wow, who proves himself genuinely talented, if not exactly a prodigy.\" An editor from HipHopDX said that despite Lil Bow Wow's age showing in his lyrics, found potential in his ability to deliver tough lyricism with \"Bow Wow (That's My Name)\" being a great starting point, concluding that \"Beware of Dog is a definite keeper and a trademark to the So So Def dynasty. This album is clear cut winner in my opinion to potentially be rated for best debut album of the year.\" Robert Christgau graded the album as a \"dud\", indicating \"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.\"\nCommercial performance\nBeware of Dog debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 101,000 copies in the first week. This became Bow Wow's first US top-ten debut. On March 5, 2001, the album was certified double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over 2 million copies. By December 2006, the album sold 2.7 million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen Soundscan.
