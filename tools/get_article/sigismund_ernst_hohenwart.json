He was appointed by the emperor on 10 January 1809, but the appointment did not receive papal approbation until December, 1814, on account of the imprisonment of the pope.\nHohenwart took energetic measures against the visionary followers of Thomas Pöschl and Martin Boos, who were then numerous in Upper Austria.\nReferences\n*"
