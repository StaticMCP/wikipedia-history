His writings on theft, dishonesty, recklessness, and jury directions shaped the structure and interpretation of modern English criminal law.\nHe was Professor of Law at the Universities of Leicester and Nottingham, an adviser to the Judicial Studies Board and Law Commission, and a long-serving contributor to the Criminal Law Review.\nEarly life and education\nGriew was born in 1926 in England. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and he studied law at University College London. He was called to the Bar at Gray’s Inn in 1950.\nAcademic career\nAfter lecturing at UCL, Griew joined the University of Leicester, later becoming Professor of Law, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (1976–1987), and Public Orator (1977–1979). In the late 1980s he moved to the University of Nottingham where he would become Emeritus Professor.\nHis teaching and writing covered theft, dishonesty, recklessness, mental disorder, and the moral foundations of criminal law.\nGriew was a long-serving member of the Criminal Law Review editorial board and its General Editor from 1964 to 1966.\nCriminal Code Project\nGriew was a member of the group of academic lawyers chaired by Professor J.C. Smith (known as the \"Criminal Code team\") who, in the early 1980s, worked under the auspices of the Law Commission to report on consolidation and codification of the general part of the criminal law into a Criminal Code. Smith, Griew and Dr Ian Dennis (as he then was) co-authored Codification of the Criminal Law, a Report to the Law Commission (Law Com No 143, 1985).\nTheir analytical work from 1983–1985 was incorporated into the Commission's final report, A Criminal Code for England and Wales (Law Com No 177, 1989). Griew’s analyses of dishonesty and recklessness are cited in discussions of mens rea and general principles of criminal liability (see Part II).\nFor the history of consolidation and codification more generally, see Criminal Code of England and Wales.\nJudicial Studies Board\nGriew was an academic adviser to the Judicial Studies Board, serving on its Crown Court Committee and helping to draft the first Specimen Directions to the Jury (1984), the forerunner of the modern Crown Court Bench Book and Judicial College Crown Court Compendium.\nIn Summing-Up the Law [1989] Crim.L.R. 768 he argued that judges should “protect the jury from the law” by using clear, factual language—a principle adopted by the JSB in its guidance on summing-up.\nImpact and legacy\nGriew was an early and staunch critic of the Court of Appeal's formulation of the test of dishonesty in R v Ghosh [1982] EWCA Crim 2: see \"Dishonesty—The Objections to Feely and Ghosh\" [1985] Crim.L.R. 341.  Ultimately, his views were vindicated when Ghosh was doubted by the Supreme Court in Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67 and set aside by the Court of Appeal in R v Barton and Booth [2020] EWCA Crim 575.\nHis approach to jury directions, urging simplicity and moral intelligibility, underpins the Judicial College’s current model directions.\nSelected publications\nBooks\n* Griew, Edward (1970-1995).
