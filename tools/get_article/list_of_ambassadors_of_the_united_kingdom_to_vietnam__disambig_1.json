During that period the British government maintained a consulate-general in Hanoi. The British embassy is now in Hanoi with a consulate-general in Ho Chi Minh City.\nAmbassadors\n*1954–1955: Sir Hubert Graves\n*1954–1957: Sir Hugh Stephenson\n*1957–1960: Sir Roderick Parkes\n*1960–1963: Henry Hohler\n*1963–1966: Gordon Etherington-Smith\n*1966–1967: Sir Peter Wilkinson\n*1967–1969: Lord MacLehose\n*1969–1971: Sir John Moreton\n*1972–1974: Brooks Richards\n*1974–1975: John Bushell\n*1975–1976: John Stewart\n*1976–1978: Robert Tesh\n*1978–1980: Sir John Margetson\n*1980–1982: Derek Tonkin\n*1982–1985: Sir Michael Pike\n*1985–1987: Richard Tallboys\n*1987–1990: Emrys Thomas Davies\n*1990–1997: Peter Keegan Williams\n*1997–2000: David Fall\n*2000–2003: Warwick Morris\n*2003–2007: Robert A.
