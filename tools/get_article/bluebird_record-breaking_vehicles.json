It was  'Flapper III'  which he renamed after seeing the play, famously and impetuously knocking up a paint shop owner at night, so as to purchase blue paint before racing at Brooklands the following day.\nIn 1925, he also raced an Itala at Brooklands with the name  'The Blue Bird'  painted on the bonnet.\nBluebird or Blue Bird?\nMalcolm Campbell named them \"Blue Bird\", Donald \"Bluebird\"''.\nThe hydroplane K4 began life as Malcolm's \"Blue Bird\", but when Donald decided to use her in 1949, after his father's death, he renamed her \"Bluebird\".\nCars\nSir Malcolm Campbell\nFor completeness, earlier cars raced by Campbell and named 'Blue Bird' are also listed here.
