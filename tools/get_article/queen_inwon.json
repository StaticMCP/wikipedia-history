She was queen consort of Joseon from 1702 until her husband's death in 1720. She was honoured as Queen Dowager Hyesun () during the reign of her step-son Yi Yun, King Gyeongjong, and later as Grand Queen Dowager Hyesun () during the reign of her adoptive son, Yi Geum, King Yeongjo.\nBiography\nEarly life\nBorn on 3 November 1687 during the thirteenth year of the reign of King Sukjong, the future queen was the second daughter of Kim Ju-shin, and his wife, Lady Jo of the Imcheon Jo clan. She had one older sister, a younger sister, and two younger brothers.\nThrough her 3rd great-grandmother, Lady Kim was a 9th great-granddaughter of King Jeongjong and Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Pyeongchang Yi clan; through their son, Yi Jong-saeng, Prince Jinnam.\nMarriage and palace life\nThe 15 year old Lady Kim married the 42 year old King Sukjong on 3 October 1702; following the death of Queen Inhyeon in September and the execution of Jang Hui-bin in November of 1701. Technically, she was Sukjong's fourth queen consort, but is officially recorded as the third queen consort of King Sukjong. Jang Ok-jeong was the actual third queen consort, but was ousted upon Queen Inhyeon's reinstatement.\nHer parents were royally entitled as Internal Prince Gyeongeun () and Internal Princess Consort Garim ().\nThere is no record of the young Queen and the King having children amongst them. But in 1703, she adopted Royal Noble Consort Suk’s son, Prince Yeoning, despite being 7 years his senior, who was known to be her favorite and whom she regarded as her own son.\nIn her early years of marriage, it was recorded that the young Queen had suffered from measles, toothaches, boils, and smallpox. Which in 1711, she came down with smallpox prompting Choi Suk-bin to order the gungnyeo to go out of the palace and look for remedies among the commoners to save the Queen, who in the end survived.\nLife as queen dowager\nFollowing Sukjong's death in 1720, she was honoured as Queen Dowager Hyesun (). Although her family was Soron, she changed her faction to Noron after Sukjong's death due to the political turmoil her adoptive son was dealing with within the palace.\nKing Gyeongjong suffered ill health and was unable to produce an heir—or to do much of anything for that matter. During his reign, the Noron and Soron factions battled for power. The Soron faction were the ruling political faction and supported Gyeongjong, and the Noron faction supported his half-brother, Prince Yeoning. The Noron faction and his step-mother, Queen Dowager Hyesun pressured him to appointed Prince Yeoning as his heir.\nAccording to one theory, Queen Seonui opposed Prince Yeoning and planned secretly to adopt Prince Milpung, a great-grandson of Crown Prince Sohyeon, King Injo's first son. But two months after the King's enthronement, Prince Yeoning was installed as Crown Prince Successor (Wangseje, 왕세제, 王世弟).\nFollowing the death of her step-son, King Gyeongjong, and the accession of her adoptive son, King Yeongjo, in 1724, she was honoured as Grand Queen Dowager Hyesun ().\nIt’s said that during her time in the palace, Queen Dowager Hyesun wrote 3 books: Syeongyun Yusa (), Syeonbi Yusa (), and Nyuk Ayukjang ().\nLater life\nDuring King Yeongjo’s reign, the Queen Dowager received filial piety from her adopted son and his wife, Queen Jeongseong.\nOn 3 April 1757, her adoptive daughter-in-law Queen Jeongseong had died at the age of 64 within Changdeok Palace.\nAbout a month later, the Queen Dowager also died on 13 May 1757 in the thirty-third year reign of King Yeongjo at Changdeok Palace, aged 69. She is buried in Myeongreung in Goyang city, Gyeonggi Province, near the tombs of King Sukjong and his second queen consort, Queen Inhyeon.\nShe was posthumously honored as Queen Inwon (). The king later remarried to a young noble girl from her family clan, later posthumously honored as Queen Jeongsun, in 1759 after the mourning period ended.\nKing Yeongjo’s son, Crown Prince Sado, from Royal Noble Consort Yeong, had been said to have grieved immensely which caused his mental illness to worsen. This was because the crown prince was close to his legal grandmother, Queen Inwon, and legal mother, Queen Jeongseong.\nHis actions eventually caused him to die in a rice chest in 1762; five years after both of the queen's death.\nFamily\nParent\n* Father − Internal Prince Gyeongeun, Kim Ju-shin (; 1661–1721)\n* Mother − Internal Princess Consort Garim of the Imcheon Jo clan (; 1660–1731)\nSibling\n* Older sister − Lady Kim of the Gyeongju Kim clan (1680–?)\n* Younger brother − Kim Hu-yeon (; 1694–1735)\n* Younger brother − Kim Gu-yeon (; 1699–1742); became the adoptive son of Kim Gae-shin ()\n* Younger half-sister − Lady Kim of the Gyeongju Kim clan (1700–?)\n* Younger sister − Lady Kim of the Gyeongju Kim clan (; 1701–?)\n* Younger half-brother − Kim Ga-yeon (; 1703–1749)\n* Younger half-brother − Kim Nae-yeon (; 1708–1779)\nConsort\n* Husband − Yi Sun, King Sukjong (; 1661–1720)\n** Father-in-law − Yi Yeon, King Hyeonjeong (; 1641–1674)\n** Mother-in-law − Queen Myeongseong of the Cheongpung Kim clan (; 1642–1684)\n* Sister-in-law − Princess Myeongseon (; 1659–1673)\n* Sister-in-law − Princess Myeonghye (; 1662–1673)\n* Sister-in-law − Yi On-hui, Princess Myeongan (; 1665–1687)\nIssue\n* Adoptive son − Yi Geum, King Yeongjo (; 1694–1776)\nFull posthumous name\nShe was given the posthumous title\n*Queen Inwon, Hyesun Jagyeong Heonryeol Gwangseon Hyeonik Kangseong Jeongdeok Suchang Yeongbok Yunghwa Hwijeong Jeongwoon Jeongui Jangmok Inwon Wanghu\n*혜순자경헌렬광선현익강성정덕수창영복융화휘정정운정의장목인원왕후\n*惠順慈敬獻烈光宣顯翼康聖貞德壽昌永福隆化徽精正運定懿章穆仁元王后.\nIn popular culture\n*Portrayed by Kang Boo-ja in the 1988 MBC TV series 500 Years of Joseon: Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong.\n*Portrayed by Kim Yong-rim in the 1998 MBC TV series ''The Great's King Road\n*Portrayed by Oh Yeon-seo in the 2010 MBC TV series Dong Yi.\n* Portrayed by Kim Hae-sook in the 2015 film The Throne.\n* Portrayed by Nam Ki-ae in the 2019 SBS TV series Haechi''.\nReferences\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}"
