It was designed by T.J. Collins (1844–1925) and built in 1896–1897.  The courthouse is a 3 1/2-story building of coursed rusticated ashlar above a raised basement.  It has a tile covered hipped roof with a molded cornice with dentilwork above a plain frieze. The building has elements of the Richardsonian Romanesque and Romanesque Revival styles.  It has a projecting central pavilion with a two-stage clock tower.  Fronting the pavilion is a triple arched portico on the first story formed by slender columns set on square pedestals with a heavy stone balustrade above.  It is the fifth courthouse to stand on the site since Rockingham was formed from Augusta County, Virginia in 1778.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nReferences"
