      "text": "# List of Battle Royale characters\n\nThe following is a list of characters that appear in the novel, manga and film versions of Battle Royale.\nPrimary characters\nShuya Nanahara\n* Assigned weapon: Army Knife (novel and manga); Pot lid (film)\nBoy #15 }} has witnessed a good deal of troubling events throughout his life. His father was killed by the government for struggling against the regime, and his mother died while he was in third grade. When the rest of his family rejected him, Shuya was put in an orphanage. He is willing to trust others, not wanting to take part in the Battle Royale program. He tries several times to rally fellow students in an attempt to escape, but fails. Consequently, he narrowly escapes death at the hands of his classmates on several occasions. Shuya is a self-proclaimed \"rock star\", listening to and playing rock 'n' roll music in spite of the ban on the genre, and his favorite artist is Bruce Springsteen. After the death of his best friend Yoshitoki, he vows to protect Yoshitoki's crush, Noriko. Shuya survives the contest and escapes. In the manga version he emigrates to the United States.\nIn the English manga, he has the nickname \"Shu.\"\nIn the original novel, Shuya develops an anger and feels remorseless when he kills soldiers on the boat. In the manga, Masayuki Taguchi altered Shuya's personality so the characters could differentiate themselves, as he believed the serialization of the manga requires more of this aspect than other mediums such as novel and film. Taguchi described Shuya as developing a justice-oriented personality like \"the character of a shōnen manga.\" As Taguchi developed Shuya's pacifistic characteristic, he decided to change the ending and allow for Shuya to spare the soldiers in the boat. Taguchi somewhat felt that Shuya pulled him into the story.\nIn the film, many of Shuya's characteristics are highly pruned, such as his love for Bruce Springsteen and rock 'n' roll music. However, in the film, he is still an extremely caring individual who desires for his classmates to halt their violence upon each other. In the end, after killing the administrator of the current Battle Royale, Kitano, he and Noriko become fugitives and are wanted by the government.\nIn the sequel to the film, Shuya becomes a terrorist, leading an army of youths who have either lost a family member or survived a Battle Royale, and declares war on all adults who support and administrate the Battle Royale Act. This forces the government to initiate a new BR Act, called BR II, which sends a single 9th grade class to a terrorist base in order to terminate the threats, with the targeted terrorist being Shuya.\nShuya's men spares few of those sent to his base, killing many of the students and earning the ire of the students who were their friends. Shuya takes the remaining soldiers as prisoners, constantly attempts to persuade them to join his cause, although he is often met with contempt, as the few remaining students in the class refuse to forgive him for the deaths of their comrades.\nEventually, a student named Takuma Aoi allies himself with the terrorist after Shuya offends the United States with a video encouraging the youth of all countries bombed by the US to rise up and rebel, which, in turn, forces the US government to bomb the base. Shuya and Aoi fend off the soldiers sent to storm the base, just long enough for them and their allies to escape while the base is bombed to ashes.\nShuya and Aoi reunite with their allies in Afghanistan and go their separate ways.  In the films, Shuya is portrayed by Tatsuya Fujiwara.\nKills: Tatsumichi Oki (accident); Unspecified number of soldiers (novel); Kitano (film); Kazuo Kiriyama (manga)\nNoriko Nakagawa\n* Assigned weapon: Boomerang (novel and manga); Binoculars (film)\nGirl #15  is the story's primary female character and Shuya's first companion, as well as, ultimately, his love interest. She is a quiet, reserved girl who is considered cute by Shuya. In the novel and manga, she is shot in the lower leg for attempting to help Yoshitoki Kuninobu; in the film, she is shot in the arm, although this wound is an accident. In both versions she falls ill and is treated for her fever by Shogo and Shuya at a pharmacy. Although she does not realize it, she manages to keep Shuya sane, and she is the only other person besides Shuya to survive the game. While innocent at heart, she is profoundly philosophical and inspires hope in Shuya and Shogo, and everything she says is true in the broader context of the novel. It is she who kills Kazuo Kiriyama, with the one and only bullet she fires during the course of the game (there is some confusion over this scene in the novel, as Shogo then shoots Kiriyama again and takes credit for the murder; the general consensus is that he is trying to spare Noriko the lifelong guilt of having killed someone). In the English-language version of the manga, after the game, her family supposedly rejects her (as her brother has been abducted by the police as a means to get her family to help look for her), so she emigrates to the United States with Shuya. In the film, teacher Kitano cares for Noriko, wishing her to win the game and reveals a picture of her as the victor when she, Nanahara and Kawada break into the school. He even goes into the island to look for her, giving her an umbrella in the rain. Shuya has commented that she wrote the best compositions in Literature class; as a result, when she speaks from her heart, her words are described as being \"like poetry\".\nAki Maeda portrays Noriko in the film adaptations.\nKills: Kazuo Kiriyama (novel), Unspecified number of soldiers (novel)\nShogo Kawada\n* Assigned weapon: Remington Arms M31 sawed-off shotgun (novel); Remington Arms M32 Shotgun (manga); Franchi SPAS-12 (film)\nBoy #5 , portrayed as a loner within the class ranks, is a transfer student. He is put in Class B about two months before the program takes place. He is the winner of the current program (pretending to kill Shuya and Noriko) and a previous program which he participated in some three years prior. He allies himself with Shuya and Noriko, telling them he knows a way to escape from the island and the entire Battle Royale program. Noriko and Shuya frequently doubt his trustworthiness, but these doubts turn out to be unfounded, as Shogo reveals that he deliberately transferred to the school in hopes of being in the selected class. He is on a mission to avenge the death of his girlfriend, who died during the last program they played in. He along with Noriko and Shuya defeat Kiriyama. He helps overturn the program, helping Shuya and Noriko to escape, but he succumbs to his wounds and dies. In all versions he is the final participant to die.\nIn the novel, Shogo is described as having \"the body of a middleweight boxing champion\". In the manga he is also very muscular. He also is the only student with facial hair. Shogo has a distinct scar underneath his left eye caused from a knife wound when he won the program, the previous year. In the novel, Shuya also noted he saw Shogo had multiple gunshot scars all over his torso from when they would change in gym class.\nIn the manga flashbacks, his father was a doctor and ran a small poorly equipped local hospital. His father was self-employed and Shogo would occasionally help out, this is how he was able to treat Noriko's wounds with such expertise. His father was killed by the government, when he tried to protest Shogo's entering of the program. Shogo also had long hair in the flashbacks, as opposed to the present when he has it completely buzzed.\nKoushun Takami describes Kawada as a \"Young Champion-esque character\" (the manga version of Battle Royale was serialized in Young Champion) and recalled that a person told him that Masayuki Taguchi's version of Shogo Kawada \"looks like Bancho Kiyohara,\" referring to the Yomiuri Giants baseball player Kazuhiro \"Bancho\" Kiyohara. Readers of Young Champion ranked Kawada first in a character popularity poll. Taguchi felt that timing contributed to the ranking as a Kawada-centered story appeared at the time of the poll. Takami felt that Kawada would have received first place even if a Kawada-centered story had not appeared on the same pages as the poll.\nShogo is portrayed by Tarō Yamamoto in the film adaptation.\nKills: Kyoichi Motobuchi; Kinpatsu Sakamochi (novel); Kaori Minami (manga), Kazuo Kiriyama (film); Yonemi Kamon (manga)\nKilled by: Kazuo Kiriyama, Nature (post-game)\nKazuo Kiriyama\n* Assigned weapon: Knife (novel); Ingram MAC-10 machine pistol (manga); Paper fan (film)\nBoy #6  is the player who kills the most students in the game.\nIn the novel and manga, Kiriyama is a sociopath with the mind of a genius and the inability to feel emotion, due to brain damage from a car crash in his childhood (in utero in the novel) that led to partial lobotomy. He is slender and handsome, with slicked back hair (which was initially styled by his gang member Mitsuru Numai, who idolises Kazuo) which he never changes the style of because he can't be bothered to. He came from a rich family, but in the manga profile and the novel it is suggested he is an illegitimate child. Kiriyama has a great intuitive grasp of everything, enabling him to not only do outstanding schoolwork, but also to master normally time-consuming skills such as painting, playing the violin, and various martial arts at a rapid rate. However, due to his emotionless state, he tends to set them aside after attaining mastery, and then losing interest in them moments afterwards. This quick intuitive grasp allowed Kazuo to be the first student to master the mechanics of the Program. In the manga, he also plucked out an abusive gym teacher's eyeball and crushed it with it still connected by the optic nerve, just to see the color of the liquid within. He was also the only male student not to fall for Mitsuko Souma's charms. Kiriyama is also shown to have a high tolerance for pain, such as when, after killing Mitsuko, he cuts his arm open and tapes the muscles that control his index finger back so as to permanently pull said finger back into a position that allows him to fire at a much more rapid rate.\nDuring his time in school, Kiriyama became the leader of his own gang, consisting of Mitsuru Numai, Hiroshi Kuronaga, and Ryuhei Sasagawa. Despite their loyalty, he has no attachment to any of them and murders all of them during the Program. Kiriyama participates in the Program not out of necessity (as with most students), but only because he had nothing better to do, and succeeds in killing many of his classmates (fourteen total, fifteen if Shogo Kawada is counted, amounting to the most kills of all students), only to ultimately be killed in the end. In the novel, Noriko shoots Kiriyama in the head once, and then Shogo shoots him in the head again; at that point Shogo tells her that he killed Kiriyama to spare Noriko the guilt of murder. In the manga, Shuya ultimately kills Kiriyama by shooting him in the neck, though Kiriyama was able to regain his emotions from an earlier shot in the face, and moments before his death, he tells Shuya that he can feel again.\nIn the film, Kiriyama, not from Shiroiwa Junior High School Class 3-B, voluntarily joins the Battle Royale program for his own entertainment. Unlike his novel and manga counterparts, he displays emotion and takes enjoyment in killing students. Kiriyama is also depicted as mute and never speaks during the course of the film. In this adaption, the \"Kiriyama family\" gang members from the novel and manga, led by Numai instead, thought Kiriyama was in the league with Kitano, and tried to bully him to confess, but were killed by him. Shogo ultimately kills him by shooting and detonating his collar.\nKiriyama is portrayed by Masanobu Andō in the film adaptation.\nGained weapons- Colt Python, 2 hand grenades, Uzi\nKills: Hiroshi Kuronaga, Ryuhei Sasagawa, Izumi Kanai, Mitsuru Numai, Yumiko Kusaka, Yukiko Kitano,(film), Yutaka Seto, Toshinori Oda, Mitsuko Soma, Shogo Kawada (post-game); Shinji Mimura, Mizuho Inada (novel and manga); Keita Iijima (film); Kayoko Kotohiki, Hiroki Sugimura (manga)±\nKilled by: Shogo Kawada (film); Shuya Nanahara (manga); Noriko Nakagawa (novel)\nMitsuko Souma\n* Assigned weapon: Kama (Sickle) (novel, manga, and film)\nGirl #11,  is beautiful and seductive on the outside yet inside, she's a hollow shell, having been left permanently damaged after suffering physical and sexual abuse from her stepfather. She is said to be one of the most beautiful girls in school with her angelic face, shapely body, and seductive smile which is referred to in the novel as her \"fallen angel's smile.\" She uses her sexuality to her advantage throughout the series. Similar to Kazuo Kiriyama, Mitsuko suffers from childhood trauma, and she is the leader of her own gang, which consists of Hirono Shimizu and Yoshimi Yahagi. She manages to kill a total of six (seven in the novel) students, becoming the second most dangerous opponent in the Program, before she finally gets killed by Kazuo Kiriyama.\nIn the novel, Mitsuko is abused by several individuals during her childhood. When she was nine years old, her mother took her to an old building in a run-down neighborhood. In the building, three men paid her mother to gang rape her and videotaped the events. When Mitsuko told a teacher what had happened, instead of getting the help she was looking for, the teacher raped her in the reading room after school. Mitsuko's friend at the time witnessed the rape and spread a rumor around school that resulted in the teacher getting fired. Mitsuko's mother tried to take her again to be raped for money, but Mitsuko accidentally killed her mother. She cleaned up the scene to make it look like a robbery gone wrong, and afterwards she sat on a swing in the park. She was then taken to live with distant relatives where their child harassed Mitsuko. When the child was hospitalized after falling off of their roof, the mother wrongly accused Mitsuko of pushing the child, but Mitsuko was defended by the father who began taking advantage of her shortly after. Being repeatedly violated in her youth shaped Mitsuko into a manipulative young woman with a twisted child's psyche. In the novel, she managed to kill seven students, the last of which (Kayoko Kotohiki) she kills seconds before Mitsuko was killed by Kiriyama.\nIn the manga, it was revealed that as a child, Mitsuko's biological father divorced his wife and eventually fled the country altogether, intending to protect her and young Mitsuko from the government. This left young Mitsuko completely heartbroken. Before he left, her father gave her a Magical Emily ring because he knew that she wanted to have one and also so that she could have something to remember him by. Mitsuko would later treasure the Ring and use it as a possible source of comfort even during the Program. Some time later, and when Mitsuko was nine years old, she then met her stepfather who ended up giving her a doll which was the only time he'd ever really shown her kindness along with the promise that they would be a family. Shortly after that, things changed as he then began subjecting both Mitsuko and her mother to all forms of abuse. In time, the damage was too much for even Mitsuko's mother to take and she too began abusing her own young daughter, presumably by physically assaulting her while her stepfather also subjected young Mitsuko to sexual abuse. Eventually, the horrific abuse Mitsuko had gone through left her damaged for life. By the time she became a teenager, Mitsuko turned into a manipulative young woman with a twisted sense of right and wrong. She also developed a habit of regularly seducing men, drugging them before having sex with them and then robbing them. She also made a deal with a local criminal to have her stepfather killed but the criminal ended up killing both Mitsuko's stepfather and mother before Mitsuko called the police on the unnamed criminal. In the English manga, she's nicknamed \"Hardcore Souma\" presumably due to her good looks. She uses much of her sexuality in the manga and often seduces men before having sex with them and later ends up either drugging them and stealing their money or just hurting them which she began doing during her tenure on the Program. During the Program, Mitsuko also becomes a killing machine who kills her classmates one by one as she seeks to win the game, including her former \"friend\", Yoshimi Yahagi. Prior to the Program, Mitsuko is feared by her female classmates and is the head of a girl gang. Her designated weapon is a sickle or a kama which she wields with incredibly lethal skill although she is seen using a gun with great skill. She also uses her good looks and body to seduce her male classmates so that she can catch them off-guard.\nDue to her emotional abuse, she has a twisted idea of sex, thinking that it is the solution to everything, which led her to rape a wounded Yuichiro Takiguchi, thinking it would make him feel better. She became upset when he said that it hurt him, and thinking that he was rejecting her, she killed him. She later came across Kazuo Kiriyama, another student who similarly to Mitsuko had been responsible for the majority of the deaths during the Program and almost immediately, the two engaged in a gunfight. Having been shot in her right arm, Mitsuko then attempted to seduce him by stripping completely naked, a tactic she had used on other men in the past. However, due to his sociopathic behavior, Kiriyama did not fall for her act and proceeded to injure Mitsuko by regularly shooting her in random parts of her body which left her in agony and caused her to remember various moments of her life. Her childlike personality seizing control, Mitsuko began calling for her father while repeatedly saying \"Magical Tool\". Kiriyama then proceeded to end Mitsuko's life by shooting her through the face which destroyed her nose and eventually resulted in her death seconds later with her final thoughts being composed of her calling for her biological father and that he'd promised not to leave her.\nIn the extended version of the film, a flashback portrayed a young Mitsuko returning home from school. At home she found her mother severely drunk, along with an unknown man who had paid Ms. Souma to molest her daughter. Mitsuko, in self-defense, quickly pushed him down the stairs - the act happened to break his neck, instantly killing him.\nIn both the extended and standard versions of the film, she is depicted more to have been a socially awkward, anxiously vain outcast and loner with no friends who, upon provision of a lethal weapon and one very lucky encounter with a bitter classmate, broke down to desperation, madness and highly potentiated, wanton homicidality under the pressure of both the Program and her own mental disorders than the hyper-criminal, deeply feared school bully of the novel or manga (on the bus, a schoolgirl loudly and repeatedly, though not maliciously, disturbs her nap–Mitsuko says and does nothing; a scene depicting another female character being harassed by three female classmates at Shiroiwa High School does not see Souma as a perpetrator; additionally, she is herself terrorized at gunpoint by another female student, having \"always pissed [the student] off\". She is also invariably referred to by classmates in the film simply as \"Mitsuko\", her given name, and never \"Souma\", her familial Japanese \"first\" name; this likely reflects a class-wide attitude of disrespect and dismissal toward her). She is gunned down with her own firearm by Kazuo Kiriyama in a particularly violent sequence, dying completely alone as a \"loser\"–which she \"just didn't want to be... anymore.\" Her total of six killings made her by far the deadliest permanent classmate in 3-B. It was rumored that she slept with a few guys at school and stole Hirono Shimizu's boyfriend; in the manga and film Mitsuko is the last girl to die.\nShe is played by Ko Shibasaki in the film, her \"breakout\" role. Shibasaki went on to become a major film/TV actress, J-pop star and model in Japan and throughout East Asia.\nKills: Megumi Eto, Takako Chigusa, Tadakatsu Hatagami, Yuichiro Takiguchi; Kayoko Kotohiki (novel and film); Hirono Shimizu (film); Yoji Kuramoto, Yoshimi Yahagi (novel and manga)\nKilled by: Kazuo Kiriyama\nShinji Mimura\n* Assigned weapon: Beretta 92 (novel, manga, and film)\nBoy #19  uses his intellect to invent escape plans.\nThe novel describes Shinji as having \"short hair\" and wearing an \" earring\" on his left ear. Shinji, the first-string shooting guard in basketball had the nickname \"The Third Man.\" Shuya and Shinji became friends after the two performed well as a team during the second-year class basketball competition. The novel states that Shinji and Shuya had equal athletic skills, although Shinji would proclaim that he is more talented. Shinji's grades in subjects other than mathematics and the English language \"weren't great.\" Instead Shinji has an \"incredible\" scope of real-world knowledge, \"mature, way beyond his peers\" views, and knowledge of information from outside of the Greater Republic of East Asia. The novel states that Shinji is \"not arrogant.\"\nIn the novel and manga, his first plan is to hack into the government's computer and disable their collars, and then bomb the school. He is unsuccessful at hacking into the computer, since he discusses his plan with his friend Yutaka Seto, and the conversation is transmitted through his collar back to the teacher, who puts a stop to that plan. Shinji then attempts to bomb the building where the Program's staff is bunkered in, a plan which fails after a slight disruption that results in Shinji killing Keita Iijima. In the ensuing confusion, Kazuo shows up and kills Yutaka. When Kazuo enters the farm coop where Shinji and Yutaka were hiding in, Shinji detonates the bomb in the coop in an attempt to kill Kazuo. Despite the resulting explosion, Kazuo survives and guns down Shinji. In a series of flashbacks, it was also revealed that Shinji's uncle was a spy who taught him many things including how to hack systems and also how to make a bomb from items scattered around the island. His uncle later died although Shinji suspects that he was murdered by the government for being a spy. His manga profile also states that although he's sexually active, Shinji has displayed traits of misogyny. Shinji viewed Takako Chigusa, Mitsuko Souma and Sakura Ogawa as the prettiest girls in the class.\nIn the film, Mimura meets with Iijima and Yutaka immediately. Mimura discovers that his collar is bugged early on, so they plot to bomb the school. They nearly succeed, but Kiriyama discovers the group and kills Yutaka and Iijima. As Kiriyama fires on him, Mimura detonates the group's bomb, killing him and blinding Kiriyama, unintentionally catalyzing the events that would lead to Kiriyama's death at the hands of Shogo. He also survives much longer in the film than in any other adaption, dying moments before Shogo kills Kiriyama at the film's climax.\nShinji is portrayed by Takashi Tsukamoto in the film adaptation.\nKills: Keita Iijima (novel and manga); self (film)\nKilled by: Kazuo Kiriyama (novel and manga); self (film)\nHiroki Sugimura\n* Assigned weapon: Tracking device homed in to collar's frequencies (novel, manga, and film)\nBoy #11  spends most of the program time looking for Kayoko Kotohiki, the girl he loves, and his best friend, Takako Chigusa.\nThe novel describes Hiroki as \"reserved\" and as having a \"tall, lanky body.\" Hiroki \"projected toughness\" because he studied martial arts. Hiroki has a \"shy\" demeanor and does not socialize that much with the other boys. The novel stated that people who began to \"know [Hiroki] a little\" discovered that Hiroki \"turned out to be nice.\" Hiroki enjoys reading Chinese poetry; because the Greater Republic of East Asia considers China to be \"part of our homeland,\" translations of Chinese books are easy to find in Japan.\nIn the manga, Hiroki is said to be the tallest boy in the class (5\"11 in manga profiles). He has long dark hair & a slightly effeminate face. He and Kiriyama engage in battle three times (more than any of the other characters); however Kiriyama always seems to come out on top. When he encounters Kiriyama for the third and final time, they engage in an intense bloody fight. Hiroki tries his best and is able to draw blood, but for the most part Kazuo is able to predict all his moves. In the process, Hiroki loses three fingers, all of his fingernails, one eye, and is hit many times. He is initially saved from death by Kazuo leaving him to target Kayoko, who has a gun: this allows him to steal Kazuo's Uzi machine gun and hit him three times in the chest and once in the arm. Hiroki and Kayoko both assume that  he is dead. Kayoko comes over to comfort Hiroki in a loving moment, but Kazuo arises. Hiroki notices too late, as he remembers that Oda had a bulletproof vest and Kazuo took it. Before he can reach for the gun, Kazuo shoots him in the stomach. Hiroki tells Kayoko to run, but she stays with him. Kazuo then shoots Kayoko in the back of the head, killing her, and proceeds a second later to kill Hiroki by shooting him in the face. They die in each other's arms.\nIn the manga flashbacks, we see Hiroki being bullied at a very young age, thus his reason for taking up martial arts. Another flashback shows him falling in love with Kayoko's \"beauty & grace\" when watching her from afar during her flower arrangement classes, his martial arts teacher made the remark \"she'd be good for you\" leaving Hiroki red and embarrassed.\nWhen he finds Takako, she is near death, and he comforts her. In the novel and film Kayoko becomes frightened and fatally injures Sugimura. In the manga, Kayoko decides to travel with him. However, they are both soon killed by Kiriyama.\nKoushun Takami, author of the novel and co-author of the manga version of Battle Royale (with Masayuki Taguchi), said that the manga version emphasizes Sugimura's fear of being \"violent.\"\nIn the film adaptation, Hiroki is portrayed by former actor Sousuke Takaoka.\nKilled by: Kayoko Kotohiki (novel and film); Kazuo Kiriyama (manga)\nTakako Chigusa\n* Assigned weapon: Ice pick (novel and manga); Jackknife (film)\nGirl #13  is an athletic girl (the fastest sprinter on the track team) and the most beautiful girl in the school.\nTakako is described as a little fierce- yet aristocratic-looking with upward-curved eyes, a sharp chin, a well-defined nose, a well-formed mouth and arched eyebrows. Her long hair has orange streaks running through it and she enjoys wearing jewellery such as bracelets, rings and earrings, much to the opposition of her teachers. Takako is known for being the prettiest girl in her class and is described so by several students, including Shuya Nanahara, Shinji Mimura and Kayoko Kotohiki. She is very close with Hiroki Sugimura, her only friend in the class since her best friend, a girl called Kahoru Kitazawa, goes to another school. Takako is a very gifted athlete, her 200m track record is the second best in the history of the prefecture. On the island, she is approached by Kazushi Niida, a boy she despises because of his immaturity and the fact that he spread a rumour of him going out with Takako. When she refuses to team up with him, he threatens to rape her and attacks her. She gouges out his eyes and crushes his penis and scrotum, finally killing him with her issued ice pick. In the novel, Takako then notices Mitsuko standing nearby and talks with her for a short time where the latter confesses that she was always a little envious of Takako because of her beauty and her being \"a better girl\". Mitsuko then shoots her three times in the back and leaves her for dead. Severely wounded, she is found by Hiroki a while later. She tells him that he has become \"quite a stud.\" He compliments her back but as she thanks him, she dies in his arms.\nIn the film she is approached by Niida and attacks him after he shoots her in the face with his crossbow when Takako refuses to sleep with him, scarring her beautiful face. This a relatively easier fight than in any version as Niida merely runs away after Takako threatens him. She then pulls out her knife and briefly chases him before stabbing him in the back, the crotch, and finally in the chest, killing him. As soon as Takako gets up from Niida's corpse she sees Mitsuko pointing a gun at her and runs through the woods while Mitsuko chases her, firing four shots to her back before letting Takako run away. Takako manages to hold out until sundown before succumbing to her wounds, where Hiroki finds her, she compliments him and tells him to stay with her before she dies in his arms.\nThe manga version presents a significantly more violent fight on Niida's part, giving him a better chance of actually killing Takako before he dies. Niida calls Takako \"Robobitch\" several times during their encounter which is the name she is referred to by some students due to her cold and arrogant attitude. In the manga, after Takako kills Niida, Mitsuko is standing behind her and fatally shoots her in the back before walking away. Later, she is found by Hiroki while dying. It is hinted that Takako may have been in love with Hiroki, asking him if they could have been more than friends. When he does not respond, she realizes that he has a crush on someone else and tells him a \"secret,\" telling him that he was her most precious friend, only to die in his arms.\nTakako is played by Chiaki Kuriyama in the film. Kuriyama's character in the film Kill Bill is based on her portrayal of Takako.\nKills: Kazushi Niida\nKilled by: Mitsuko Souma\nSupporting male characters\nYoshio Akamatsu\n* Assigned weapon: Crossbow (novel, manga, and film)\nBoy #1  is the first student to leave the school where they are briefed in all versions of the series.\nYoshio Akamatsu is one of the class of third-year students at the fictional Shiroiwa Junior High School. A large boy who performs poorly in sports, Yoshio is frequently bullied, particularly by his classmate Ryuhei Sasagawa. Yoshio is said to be 180&nbsp;cm tall in the novel (about 5'11\"). He is a timid, quiet student, who is often paranoid about being mistreated by his peers. In the manga, a flashback of Yoshio being asked for help with a video game by Shuya Nanahara can be seen. Shuya had told Yoshio that he considered him a friend.\nIn all versions, after killing girl #14 Mayumi Tendo, Yoshio trips down a small hill during his attempt to kill Nanahara, blinded by fear of his own death. He rises in a huff to find Kazushi Niida standing nearby. Kazushi then shoots Yoshio with an arrow from his own crossbow. The book says that Kazushi shoots him in the back of the neck accidentally after panicking. In the film, Kazushi shoots Yoshio in the heart instead of the neck after panicking. In the manga, the attack is deliberate and is done by Kazushi Niida: when Yoshio awakens, he panics and looks for his crossbow. However, Kazushi shoots him in the side of the head, killing him instantly.\nYoshio is portrayed by Shin Kusaka in the film adaptation.\nKills: Mayumi Tendo\nKilled by: Kazushi Niida\nKeita Iijima\n* Assigned weapon: Kitchen knife (novel and manga); Jutte (film)\nIn the novel and manga, Boy #2  is a loner who is a former friend of Shinji Mimura. The two have had a falling out, due to Keita's refusing to help fight the street gang harassing Shinji, in his spite of losing a bet, though Iijima is also said to be a coward, which Shinji refused to take into account. When Keita wishes to join Yutaka Seto and Shinji, Shinji points a gun at Keita and tells him to leave. Shinji fires the gun in an attempt to scare him off, but accidentally hits and kills him. This begins a chain of events which leads to the ultimate failure of Mimura's plan. In the manga, Keita is known to vomit in disgust when he sees something revolting, such as when Kazuo Kiriyama plucks out the eyeball of a gym teacher and crushes it in front of everyone, and when Yonemi Kamon shows the class the decaying corpse of Masao Hayashida.\nIn the film, Iijima is shown to be laughing at inappropriate times---in the beginning, Kitano demands to know what was funny, to which he gave no answer. Iijima is still Mimura's friend, and he travels with Mimura and Yutaka. In the end Kazuo Kiriyama kills Iijima and Yutaka, but Iijima's last words were that they will be together when they escape.\nKilled by: Shinji Mimura (novel and manga); Kazuo Kiriyama (film)\nTatsumichi Oki\n* Assigned weapon: Hatchet (novel and film); Machete (manga)\nBoy #3  cracks under the pressure of the situation in all versions of Battle Royale.\nIn the manga, Oki is a new student. Oki is a member of the school's handball team. After the game starts, he goes insane and attempts to kill Shuya and Noriko. After a fall with Shuya, his weapon becomes lodged in his face, killing him instantly (the film version shows him walking for several seconds before falling dead on the ground). Yuko Sakaki witnesses the fall, and believes Shuya to be deliberately responsible for Oki's death, leading to her attempted murder of Shuya and the subsequent lighthouse massacre.\nKilled by: Self (accident)\nToshinori Oda\n* Assigned weapon: Bulletproof vest (novel, manga, and film)\nBoy #4  In the English manga, he is nicknamed \"Froggy\" for his appearance.\nIn the novel and manga, Toshinori attempts to kill Hirono Shimizu by strangulation while she is drinking water from the well.  She then shoots him twice in the stomach, though she is unaware he is wearing a bulletproof vest.

She and Haruka worked well together on the volleyball team and Yukie was the setter. She was held in high regard by most of her classmates, as both Shinji Mimura and the proud Takako Chigusa considered her to be trustworthy. She was often a better leader than the male class representative Kyoichi Motobuchi, this is shown especially in the Program.\nDuring the game, she gathers Haruka and several other girls and hides in an abandoned lighthouse. Hiroki delivers an injured Shuya and brings him in. Yukie admits that she is in love with him, and in the manga she kisses him.

Shuya firmly claims that it was an accident and also tells Yukie about Shogo Kawada's plan to escape from the island.\nShortly afterward, Yukie tells him that she knows everything about him and then asks if he knows what that means which he is confused by. She brushes it off and tells him that it's lunch time and she will bring him his food.\nYukie later announces to the other girls that Shuya is awake and in good condition. She tells Haruka to get Yuka from watch and she tries to calm Satomi and Yuko down as they are scared of what may happen in the days to come.\nAfter Yuka joins the group, Yukie gathers the girls to tell them of Kawada's plan and suddenly Yuka dies from the food that was poisoned by Yuko. Satomi freaks out and blames Chisato, who then pins the blame on Haruka, all while Yukie tries to calm everyone down.

Horrified, Yukie grabs her gun and shoots at Satomi, while Haruka joins in. The three girls get into a violent gun fight and all three fall, with Haruka killed.

Wishing the person to be one of her friends, her luck fails as Mitsuko discovers the phone.\nIn the novel and manga, Mitsuko tells Megumi that she is scared, as well, and wants to team up with her. Megumi, overjoyed believes her, but Mitsuko instead slits her throat (in the manga her nape is slit instead), revealing that she had been lying the whole time and is actually playing to win.

However, soon they turn against each other, and kill each other in a violent gun fight. Haruka does not participate until Satomi kills Yukie, and is shot several times in the side when grabbing her friend's gun.

They then find Hiroki holding Shuya, who is injured. They take in Shuya and prepare a stew. Yuko, however, thinks Shuya intentionally killed Tatsumichi Oki, even though it was an accident. While Yuko is preparing soup for Shuya, she slips potassium cyanide into it. Yuka says that she will have a taste of the soup, and dies after eating the poisoned food meant for Shuya. This sparks a gunfight and eventual massacre between the girls in the lighthouse. Although Yuka has the same surname as Noriko, the two have no relation to one another as \"Nakagawa\" is a very common surname in Japan.\nKilled by: Yuko Sakaki (accident)\nSatomi Noda\n* Assigned weapon: Uzi submachine gun (Novel and Manga); Remington Model 870 (Movie)\nGirl #17  is a model student. Satomi wears wire-rimmed glasses which the novel says fits her \"calm, intelligent face.\"\nSatomi was one of the girls who joins Yukie Utsumi and her group at the lighthouse. Her designated weapon was an Uzi submachine gun in all versions, which she uses to kill all of her friends. As soon as she left the school Satomi joined the group of girls that Yukie Utsumi put together.\nIn the film, Satomi moans about only living until the next day. Yukie comforts her, telling her that she will find a way out of the scenario.\nAfter Yuko Sakaki tries to poison Shuya Nanahara, but accidentally kills Yuka Nakagawa, the girls suspect each other, thinking that one of themselves is the murderer. Satomi realizes she should kill her friends since she has the chance to and win the program. She was the first one to become panicked enough to grab her gun and points it at her friends. Satomi kills Chisato Matsui, Yukie Utsumi, and Haruka Tanizawa in all versions but the details vary.\nIn the novel and manga, Satomi shoots Chisato three times in the back first after she goes for Yuka's gun. Satomi claims afterwards that Chisato was guilty of poisoning Yuka and that Chisato's murder was in self-defence. Yukie rejects this, saying that Satomi killed Chisato because she just wanted to. Satomi gets ready to shoot Haruka because Haruka told Yukie to kill her. While Satomi's back is turned, Yukie points her gun at Satomi, and hesitates because she only wants to disarm her. This gives Satomi the chance to turn around and fatally shoot Yukie. Haruka dives for Yukie's gun but Satomi shoots her too. Thinking that Haruka is dead, Satomi turns to Yuko, the last girl standing. In the manga she encourages Yuko to join her, and that she will protect her. In the novel she also says that Yuko is 'different'. Haruka then uses the last of her energy to shoot Satomi in the head, killing her. In the novel, Satomi's Uzi goes off as she falls, almost tearing off Haruka's neck.\nIn the film, Satomi shoots Chisato dead, then ends up in a gunfight with Yukie and Haruka. Satomi successfully kills Haruka and mortally wounds Yukie, but sustains injuries herself. As in the other versions, Satomi speaks her last words, of mercy, to Yuko. However, in the film Yukie shoots Satomi dead before dying herself, not Haruka.\nAt three kills, Satomi has the third-highest number of victims in The Program, behind Mitsuko and Kiriyama.\nKills: Chisato Matsui, Yukie Utsumi, Haruka Tanizawa\nKilled by: Haruka Tanizawa (novel and manga); Yukie Utsumi (film)\nFumiyo Fujiyoshi\n* Assigned weapon: None (killed before Program begins)\nGirl #18  is the quiet, caring nurse's aid.

In the novel and manga, she is the second student to be killed, while she is the first to die in the film. She is good friends with Yukie Utsumi, and in the bus she's seen bullying with Kayoko Kotohiki. In the manga, Yutaka has a crush on her, and named Shinji's plan \"Fumiyo's Revenge\".\nKilled by: Kinpatsu Sakamochi (novel); Kitano (film); Yonemi Kamon (manga). Fumiyo is one of the few characters to be killed by a different person in each version, though this is due to a new \"teacher\" in every version.\nChisato Matsui\n* Assigned weapon: IMI Desert Eagle (novel); Luger 9mm (manga); Walther PPK (film)\nGirl #19  is one of Yukie's friends. The novel describes Chisato, a member of a non-distinct group of girls referred to by the novel as \"the neutrals,\" as \"always quiet and withdrawn.\" Chisato is a petite girl with long hair. She had a crush on Shinji Mimura and in the Manga, she and Yuka were apparently \"Boy crazy\".\nChisato was one of the girls who teamed up with Yukie Utsumi and the others at the lighthouse. She cooked the meal, along with Haruka Tanizawa, which made the others suspicious of her when Yuka Nakagawa was poisoned. When the girls all became paranoid and panicked, Satomi Noda grabbed the uzi, and when Chisato moved to get Yuka's gun, Satomi shot her three times in the back. In the manga, after Satomi begins accusing Chisato of poisoning the food, Chisato becomes increasingly paranoid, believing that everyone is going to side with Satomi. Chisato grabs Yuka's gun, thinking that the others will have to listen to her if she has it, however, when she points it at Satomi, Satomi responds by shooting Chisato in the stomach with the machine gun, killing her instantly. In the film, she also accuses Yukie of poisoning the meal in order to run off with Shuya Nanahara alone before grabbing a gun.\nKilled by: Satomi Noda\nKaori Minami\n* Assigned weapon: SIG P230 (novel); SIG P226 (manga); Pickaxe (film)\nGirl #20  is a fan of various pop idols, especially of Junya Kenzaki.

On the island, Kaori finally loses her sanity after accidentally killing a kitten, and she gets into a gunfight with Hirono. She then ends up shooting Hirono in the arm. After trying to kill Shuya, Shogo kills her by shooting her in the head with his shotgun.  In the novel, Kaori is distracted by Shuya during her gunfight with Hirono, allowing Hirono to shoot her in the head.\nIn some of the flashbacks in the manga, she is constantly bullied by Mitsuko's gang; gang members usually steal her money. Other students label her \"pizza face\" to insult her due to her acne problem that she was sensitive to; during the program she goes insane because of this and often chants out the sentence, \"No more pizza face!\".\nIn the film, she says goodbye to Mizuho Inada after her name is called, promising they will still be friends. The two are later shown to have joined forces, but are seen stabbed to death next to a life preserver. The two killed each other.\nKills: Mizuho Inada (film)\nKilled by: Hirono Shimizu (novel); Mizuho Inada (film); Shogo Kawada (manga).

Yoshimi is in a relationship with Yoji Kuramoto, whom she met while watching a movie.\nYoshimi Yahagi is one of the class of third-year students at the fictional Shiroiwa Junior High School. She was a member of an all-girl gang headed by Mitsuko Souma, along with Hirono Shimizu. Yoshimi used to regularly steal from and torment her classmates. She often singled Kaori Minami out of the girls. Yoshimi is described in the novel as one of the more urban girls in Shiroiwa; she never saw a sickle before in her life.\nIn the manga during flashbacks, Mitsuko and her gang prostitute themselves to get money. At this point Yoshimi is a virgin and upon mentioning this, two of the male clients continue to rape her. Even Mitsuko doesn't treat her very nice and manipulates Yoshimi frequently. So when she meets Yoji by chance while watching an emotional movie to which Yoji is crying, and he treats her with care and affection, she falls for him.\nIn the novel and manga, Yoshimi is thrilled when she manages to meet up with Yoji, but is shocked when he attacks her. They talk briefly, and Yoji starts to realize that he could not kill Yoshimi because he loves her. Before they could do anything, Mitsuko appears and kills Yoji; in the novel, Mitsuko stabs Yoji's head with her sickle, while in the manga, she picks up Yoshimi's gun and shoots him through the head. Afterward, Yoshimi is then killed when Mitsuko shoots her in the eye. In the novel she attempts to stop Mitsuko from removing her scythe from Yoji's head and attacks her before she is in turn shot by Mitsuko. Her manga profile states she had potential for a \"dark horse\" win.\nIn the film version, Yoshimi and Yoji hang themselves rather than participate in the Program.\nMasayuki Taguchi, creator of the manga version, did not model his version of Yoshimi after any particular person. Taguchi said that he listened to many women and felt that they had a \"unique outlook on life.\" Koushun Takami, author of the original Battle Royale novel, liked how Taguchi expanded Yoshimi's backstory. Takami described the manga version of the meeting between Yoshimi and Yoji as \"standing strongly on its own.\"\nKills: herself (film)\nKilled by: Mitsuko Souma (novel and manga); herself (film)\nOther characters\nKinpatsu Sakamochi\nIn the novel version  is a government employee who is the administrator of the current Battle Royale program. Sakamochi briefs the students on the rules of the Program. He is a vile and sadistic man, as he kills two students for misbehavior. In the end, he was killed by Shogo Kawada. His name is a play on the character Kinpachi Sakamoto (坂本 金八 Sakamoto Kinpachi) from the Japanese TV drama San nen B-gumi Kinpachi-sensei.\nKitano\nIn the film version,  is the head instructor of the program. He is less sadistic than Sakamochi and Kamon.\nHe leaves his initial job at Shiroiwa Junior High School after Yoshitoki stabs him. Kitano returns as the instructor of the Battle Royale program and kills both Fumiyo and Yoshitoki.\nKitano seems to have some sort of affection for Noriko, whom he considers a respectful student much unlike the rest of her class. At one point in the movie, he saves her life from Mitsuko Souma by scaring Mitsuko. Afterwards, he then gives her his umbrella telling her \"not to catch a cold\". After Shogo Kawada is declared the winner, Kitano orders the military to leave the island and to not bother to check for the bodies of Shuya Nanahara and Noriko. When Shogo arrives to meet Kitano, Kitano reveals that he knew Shogo had deactivated Shuya's and Noriko's collars and then threatens to kill him. Shuya and Noriko both burst into the classroom in time. Kitano then reveals a painting he had created with all the other students dead, and Noriko triumphant. He tells her that he wishes to die, and he would prefer to die with her. He then threatens the trio with a gun once more and orders them to shoot him, or he would shoot them. Shuya promptly shoots him with a machine gun; Kitano rises and fires his gun (which turns out to be a harmless water gun). Shocked by the fake gun, Shuya accidentally lets loose another volley and Kitano falls down. Kitano rises again once more to answer his cell phone. After hanging up angrily on his daughter, tossing the phone to the floor, shooting it with a real gun and then eating the last of Noriko's cookies (complimenting the cookies while doing so) Kitano dies.\nIn the film adaptations, Kitano is portrayed by Takeshi Kitano.\nYonemi Kamon\nIn the manga version,  is a government employee who is the administrator of the current Battle Royale program. Kamon briefs the students on the rules of Battle Royale. He is a vile and sadistic man, as he kills two students for misbehaving, and then orders the rest of the class to write lines, each stating that they will kill a certain student's name, all the while making cruel and sick jokes. He is also overtly lecherous. He also claims to have killed parents who objected to their children's placement in the program, as well as having raped Yoshitoki's guardian. Kamon himself bet 20,000 yen on Kazuo Kiriyama as the winner. When Yonemi tries to kill the winner, Shogo, for breaking the rules and saving Shuya and Noriko, Shogo stabs Yonemi in the neck with a pencil, killing him.\nKeiko Onuki\nis Shogo Kawada's girlfriend from his previous school in Kobe; Keiko was in Shogo's class when the two were in a Battle Royale.\nIn the novel, Shogo loses track of Keiko; Shogo believes that Keiko felt afraid of him. Shogo later discovered Keiko dead.\nIn the manga, Shogo and Keiko meet. When Keiko seemingly points her gun towards Shogo, Shogo kills her; he later discovered that Keiko had aimed at a person behind him. In the film, Shogo and Keiko are the last two in the game. The injured players notice that their collars are about to explode. Keiko shoots Shogo to entice him to shoot her fatally; before Keiko dies she smiles and says arigatou (Thank you). Shogo, the survivor of that game, wonders why Keiko smiled at that point.\nIn the novel and manga versions of Battle Royale Shogo carries a bird call Keiko had given him, and uses it as a signal should any of the main group get lost or, in the case of Sugimura, succeed in finding Kayoko let them know he found her. This is later exploited by Kazuo Kiriyama after Sugimura and Kayoko are killed. Shogo also carries a photo of him and Keiko in all versions.\nRyoko Anno\nis the superintendent of the Charity House, a Catholic orphanage. She acts as guardian to Yoshitoki and Shuya. In the manga and novel, the teacher (Sakamochi in the novel, Yonemi in the manga) says that he raped her when she objected to her charges being selected for the program. Yoshitoki becomes enraged upon hearing this and charges at Sakamochi/Kamon before he is gunned down and killed.\nIn the last volume of the manga, Shuya revisits the orphanage in secret without Ryoko knowing he is still alive. There he sees that she has formed a romantic relationship with a man. He tells himself he is pleased for her, before leaving on a ship to America.\nRyoko Anno is not mentioned in the film version.\nMasao Hayashida\nis the teacher of Class 3-B at Shiroiwa Junior High School. He is executed when he pleads for the lives of the 3-B students and his corpse is left to decay for a while before being shown to his former class by their new \"teacher\" who tells them that this is the fate that befalls those who would defy the Program. He is nicknamed \"Dragonfly\" because of his glasses.\nTahara, Nomura, and Kondo\nPrivates , , and  are, in the novel version, soldiers enforcing the Program.

He was formerly an Olympic judo participant, and has high skills in the martial arts, calling himself the \"Jaguar\" in arrogance. This arrogance, along with his abusive methods of \"teaching\" his students, made him highly despised by everyone in school. In the English translation, Sugimura had trouble remembering his name due to his dislike for the teacher. Sakaguchi would brutally beat up Sugimura in a judo match, despite knowing that Sugimura refused to fight back in pride, instead making it look like his student was weak. Sakaguchi then got humiliated by Mimura when the latter took his belt and dropped his pants, making him a laughing stock. Then Sakaguchi would suddenly pick on Kiriyama for reading a book about judo in class; Sakaguchi got defeated in the first round and was humiliated again, so he hit Kiriyama hard in the face in round two. This turned out to be a mistake, as Kiriyama used the third round to pop out Sakaguchi's right eyeball out of its socket. Sakaguchi screamed in pain and begged for mercy and help, but was ignored as Kiriyama crushed the eye while it was still connected via the retina, while everyone else refusing to help due to hating Sakaguchi and fearing Kiriyama. Horrified and traumatized by this torture, Sakaguchi resigned immediately, and Kazuo Kiriyama became infamous from that point on.\nIn the manga, Sakaguchi challenges Sugimura because of his dislike for Chinese martial arts. But because it is a judo match, Sugimura cannot strike; therefore Sakaguchi won throwing him to the floor in brutal fashion.\nMai\nIn the film version Mai (FR) is the smiling girl who survived the previous program.

Taku initially shrugs off any of Shuya's persuasions, but, in the end, realizes that Shuya, like him, is fighting merely to honor his dead friends.\nTaku finally allies himself with Shuya by the end, and, as Japanese/US soldiers raid the island, they evacuate their allies off the island.
