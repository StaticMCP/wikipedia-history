Woodward High School is a public high school located in the north side of Toledo, Ohio, that was built in 1928.  It was named after an early advocate for vocational education.  The original Woodward Technical High School was located in the former Central High School building at the corner of Adams and Michigan streets (the current site of the Lucas County Main Library) before the present location was chosen.  Woodward is part of the Toledo City School District.\nThe Woodward Polar Bears wear blue and white for athletics and either chose their nickname because they are located in the north end of Toledo, or because former principal Charles LaRue named them after his alma mater at Ohio Northern University.  Woodward is a charter member of the Toledo City League from 1926.  From 1923-1932, Woodward played Libbey High School in a football game on Thanksgiving Day until Libbey and DeVilbiss High School became the annual matchup. In April 1937, the High School displayed a Tesla Coil formerly owned by Nikola Tesla to the public, which they had acquired for educational purposes.\nIn 2010, the building that Woodward's neighborhood had called home since 1928 was replaced by a newer facility located on the same property.\nThe TPS board approved a resolution in November 2013 to have new stadiums built at Woodward and Scott High School after their previous facilities were torn down during  construction and renovation.  They were built in time for the 2014 season.  Woodward's previous stadium had been dedicated in 1969 after they had gone without one since the 1930s.\nMr. Jack Renz is the current principal.\nOhio High School Athletic Association State Championships\n* Girls Basketball - 1976\nToledo City League Titles\n*Football: 1952*, 1975*, 1991*, 2019\n*Volleyball:\n*Golf:\n*Boys Basketball: 1927-28, 1929–30, 1939-40*, 1941-42*, 1943-44*, 1944–45, 1946–47, 1952-53*, 1959-60*, 1963–64\n*Girls Basketball: 1975-76\n*Wrestling:\n*Baseball:\n*Boys Track and Field:\n*Girls Track and Field: 1970\n*Softball:\n– (years marked with an asterisk (*) denote a shared title)\nNotable alumni\n* Danny Thomas (dropped out  1927), actor, comedian and nightclub singer\n* Billy Jones (class of  1932), former NBL basketball player, pioneer in integrating professional American sports\n* Aaron Novick (class of 1937), molecular biologist\n* John Payak (class of 1944), former NBA player\n* Paul Seymour (class of 1945), former NBA player and coach\n* Bob Harrison (class of 1945), former NBA player\n* Andrew J.
