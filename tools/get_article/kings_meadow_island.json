A smaller island, Little Annie''' lay nearby to the southwest whilst the two Clarenee Islands lay to the north of the east end of Kings Meadow. The islands were removed by dredging between 1862 and 1887 by the Tyne Improvement Commission, to make it easier for river traffic to pass.\nDuring the siege of Newcastle, in 1644, Scottish sentries were posted on Kings Meadow, shooting dead at least one man who attempted to sail past.\nIn the 18th century, a public house, the 'Countess of Coventry', operated on Kings Meadow.\nA regatta and horse racing were held on Kings Meadow, annually until 1850. It was also used for greyhound racing.\nKingsmeadow Community Comprehensive School, nearby, is named after the island.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://northeasthistorytour.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-kings-meadows-nz230628.html Blog post]"
