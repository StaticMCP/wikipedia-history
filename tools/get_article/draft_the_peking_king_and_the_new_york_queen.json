The song’s lyrics were written by Ray Manzarek, the band’s organist and lead vocalist after Jim Morrison passed away in 1971.\nRay Manzarek discusses the surreal culture clashes between an interracial couple, one from the Peking and one from New York.\nThe song features additional musicians and background vocalists including Chico Batera on percussion. Jack Conrad plays bass. Bobbye Hall is on percussion and Clydie King, Vanetta Fields, and Melissa MacKey are background vocalists.\nThe song is the longest of the track list for “Full Circle”, clocking in at 6:29.\nAccording to Robby Krieger, the song was written about the marriage of Ray Manzarek and his wife Dorothy Manzarek. He stated, “That was Ray’s quintessential song about him and Dorothy.”\n“The Peking King and the New York Queen” was later included on the CD reissue of “Other Voices” and “Full Circle” in 2015.\nReferences\nAdditional sources\nExternal links\nhttps://genius.com/The-doors-the-peking-king-and-the-new-york-queen-lyrics"
