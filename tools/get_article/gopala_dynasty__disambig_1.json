The Lunar dynasty is the origin of the Gopala. The Kings of Gopala Bansha ruled over Nepal for 505 years. It was replaced by rulers of Mahisapala dynasty. Both the Krishna and Mahisapalas have connections to the Gopalas.\nOrigin and history\nAccording to legendary accounts, the early dynasty of Nepal was the Gopala dynasty established by Gopa, who presumably ruled for about five centuries. They are said to have been followed by the Mahisapala dynasty. The Gopalas and the Mahisapalas were together known as Abhiras.\nAnother belief was that Gopalvamsi and Mahispalvamsi belonged to the same dynasty and they were divided into two on the basis of their profession. Amarakosha gives Abhira as synonym for Gopa and Gopala.\nList of rulers\nThe 8 rulers of the Gopala dynasty (with their traditional reign lengths) were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Monarchs of the Gopala dynasty\n!Name\n!Reign Length\n|-\n|Bhuktamana Gupta\n|88 years\n|-\n|Jaya Gupta\n|72 years\n|-\n|Parama Gupta\n|60 years\n|-\n|Harsha Gupta\n|93 years\n|-\n|Bhima Gupta\n|38 years\n|-\n|Mani Gupta\n|37 years\n|-\n|Vishnu Gupta\n|42 years\n|-\n|Yakchhya Gupta\n|71 years\n|}\nEach ruler was the son of the previous one.\nPashupatinath Temple\nThe rulers of Gopala dynasty were devotees of Lord Shiva.
