It was released in the U.S. on August 21, 2007, in Ireland on September 7, 2007, through Independent Records, and released in the rest of Europe on October 1, 2007, by V2 Records. By July 26, 2007, the album had leaked onto peer-to-peer file-sharing websites.\nThe record was recorded in a Maine farmhouse dating to the 18th century. According to Ritter: \"Lyrically, musically, and in terms of production, it's the most adventurous record I've made yet and I think when you hear it you're going to be surprised.  Seriously, repeatedly, and in a good way.\"\nThematic elements\nThe lyrics of the album's Dylanesque opening track, \"To the Dogs or Whoever,\" contains a number of historical references, many of them to traditional American cultural and mythological figures:\n*Florence Nightingale\n*Calamity Jane\n*Joan of Arc\n*Casey Jones\n*Casey at the Bat\n*General George Armstrong Custer\nThe second verse of the song \"Empty Hearts\":\nThese lyrics reference the title of the first track on the album, which could be read as the friends' singing that first song or singing for a canine audience. The title of the first track on the CD is never mentioned in that song's lyrics, but Ritter self-referentially uses it in the lyrics of \"Empty Hearts,\" suggesting that the songs on the CD may have an interrelated design.\nCritical reception\n|rev1       =AllMusic\n|rev1Score=\n|rev2       =Entertainment Weekly\n|rev2Score= (A−)\n|rev3       =Pitchfork\n|rev3Score=\n|rev4       =Tiny Mix Tapes\n|rev4Score=\n|rev5       =Slant\n|rev5Score=\n}}\nIn regards to The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter, Paste Magazine described Ritter as the poster-boy of Americana music.
