The ceremony was hosted by David Frost and Danny Thomas.  Winners are listed in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nThe top shows of the night were My World and Welcome to It, and Marcus Welby, M.D.. Marcus Welby, M.D., and Room 222 each won three major awards. My World and Welcome to It won Outstanding Comedy Series, but was cancelled after its first season. It is currently the most recent series to win for Outstanding Comedy Series in the show's one and only season. Another oddity in the Outstanding Comedy Series category was that not one show nominated the previous year was nominated this year. This marks the last time that either series category (comedy or drama) has had this occur.\nGail Fisher from Mannix became the first black woman to win an Emmy Award in any category. Susan Hampshire from The Forsyte Saga became the first Lead Actress, Drama to win outside the Big Three television networks - from the NET network. Her win was also the first for a British produced programme.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'My World and Welcome to It (NBC)'\n** The Bill Cosby Show (NBC)\n** ''The Courtship of Eddie's Father (ABC)\n** Love, American Style (ABC)\n** Room 222 (ABC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Marcus Welby, M.D. (ABC)'\n** The Forsyte Saga (NET)\n** Ironside (NBC)\n** The Mod Squad (ABC)\n** NET Playhouse (NET)\n** The Name of the Game (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The David Frost Show (NBC)'\n** The Carol Burnett Show (CBS)\n** The Dean Martin Comedy Hour (NBC)\n** The Dick Cavett Show (ABC)\n** Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Annie, the Women in the Life of a Man (CBS)'\n**Kraft Music Hall'': \"The Friars Club 'Roasts' Jack Benny\" (NBC)\n**Kraft Music Hall: \"The Sound of Burt Bacharach\" (NBC)\n**The Second Bill Cosby Special (NBC)\n**Sinatra (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'Cinderella (NET)'\n**S.
