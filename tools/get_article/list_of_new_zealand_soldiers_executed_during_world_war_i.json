The executions, carried out by firing squad, were not made public at the time. All five were posthumously pardoned on 14 September 2000, when New Zealand's Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act became law. The bill was presented by Mark Peck, Member of Parliament for Invercargill. The vote was 112 for the motion and five against.\nList\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=15%|Name\n! width=4%|Age\n! width=10%|Unit\n! width=10%|Executed\n! Offence\n!
