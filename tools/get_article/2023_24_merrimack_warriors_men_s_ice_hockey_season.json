The Warriors represented Merrimack College, played their home games at the J. Thom Lawler Rink and were coached by Scott Borek, in his sixth season.\nSeason\nComing off of its first NCAA tournament appearance in twelve years, Merrimack entered the year with some expectations for its program. Though the team had lost several depth players to graduation, the Warriors returned the top three forwards as well as both of their starting goaltender. However, just before the opening game, Alex Jefferies was injured in practice and missed the first month of the season. Without their leading scorer, the team was unable to do much offensively against Arizona State but the Warriors soon recovered and posted three solid wins to finish out October.\nOnce Jefferies returned in early November, the team was hoping to continue their upwards trend but the goaltending gave out. Over a six-game stretch, Merrimack lost four 1-goal games with neither netminder finding much consistency.  The Warriors recovered a bit over Thanksgiving, winning two matches against weak Atlantic Hockey teams, but ended the first half of their season with three consecutive losses. Both Zachary Borgiel and Hugo Ollas were struggling to keep the puck out of the net and coach Borek had no option but to hope at least one of his goaltenders would recover their form from '23.\nMerrimack was able to pick itself up after the winter break when Borgiel strung three solid games together and lifted the Warriors record back to .500. Ollas joined in to help earn a split against #13 Massachusetts in the middle of January, however, Jefferies went back on the shelf after the second match and was out of the lineup for three weeks. Merrimack lost every game that their top forward missed and when he returned the team was well and truly out of the race. Borgiel's play had also degraded to the point that the goaltending rotation was ended in mid-February with Ollas taking over for the remainder of the season. Merrimack was able to salvage what was left of their season and play even in the final few weeks but that only saved the team from finishing last in the standings.\nWith an abysmal record in conference, the Warriors were going to have to run through a gauntlet of strong teams if they wanted to reach the tournament once more. However, the team was unable to surmount even their first challenge.  Northeastern shut down the Merrimack offense, blacking the team for the first time since the opening game and swiftly ended the Warriors' season.\nDepartures\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=1100\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Will Calverley || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with Florida Everblades)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Tristan Crozier || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with Tulsa Oilers)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Slava Demin || Defenseman ||  || Graduation (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Hugo Esselin || Forward ||  || Graduation (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Filip Karlsson Tägtström || Forward ||  || Signed professional contract (Tyresö/Hanviken)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Ryan Leibold || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with South Carolina Stingrays)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Ottoville Leppänen || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with Orlando Solar Bears)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Mick Messner || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with Utah Grizzlies)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Kevin Sadovski || Defenseman ||  || Left program (retired)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Jordan Seyfert || Forward ||  || Graduation (signed with Kalamazoo Wings)\n|}\nRecruiting\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=1100\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Liam Cavan || Defenseman ||  || 21 || Gloucester, ON\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Michael Citara || Forward ||  || 21 || New Hope, PA; transfer from Providence\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Ty Daneault || Forward ||  || 18 || Red Deer, AB\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Frank Djurasevic || Defenseman ||  || 21 || New Rochelle, NY\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Brady Hunter || Forward ||  || 21 || Enfield, NS\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| David Sacco || Forward ||  || 21 || Middleton, MA\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n| Max Wattvil || Defenseman ||  || 21 || Stockholm, SWE\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n| Luke Weilandt || Forward ||  || 21 || Northbrook, IL\n|}\nRoster\nAs of September 26, 2023.\nStandings\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" |\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" |\n}}\nScoring statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=800\n|- align=\"center\"\n]]}}\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || C ||30 ||7 ||25 ||32 ||48\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || D ||33 ||4 ||24 ||28 ||30\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || LW ||22 ||13 ||10 ||23 ||19\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || RW ||34 ||13 ||8 ||21 ||33\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || F ||35 ||7 ||12 ||19 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||35 ||5 ||14 ||19 ||20\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || LW/RW ||35 ||5 ||13 ||18 ||25\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || RW ||31 ||6 ||9 ||15 ||6\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || C ||30 ||4 ||9 ||13 ||18\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || D ||35 ||4 ||6 ||10 ||26\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || F ||29 ||6 ||3 ||9 ||10\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || D ||35 ||2 ||7 ||9 ||10\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || LW ||30 ||3 ||5 ||8 ||24\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || D ||26 ||3 ||4 ||7 ||4\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D/F ||19 ||2 ||4 ||6 ||6\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||23 ||3 ||2 ||5 ||6\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || F ||33 ||2 ||3 ||5 ||23\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||15 ||4 ||0 ||4 ||10\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D ||21 ||1 ||3 ||4 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || D ||24 ||2 ||1 ||3 ||14\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || D ||24 ||1 ||2 ||3 ||4\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || RW ||18 ||1 ||1 ||2 ||23\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || C ||11 ||0 ||2 ||2 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || F ||12 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||4\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || RW ||12 ||0 ||1 ||1 ||25\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || G ||1 ||0 ||0 ||0 ||0\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\"\n|  || G ||16 ||0 ||0 ||0 ||2\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"f0f0f0\"\n|  || G ||22 ||0 ||0 ||0 ||2\n|-\n!
