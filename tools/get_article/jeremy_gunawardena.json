His lab focuses on cellular information processing.\nEducation\nHe received a BSc degree in mathematics from Imperial College, London, where he was awarded the Sir John Lubbock Memorial Prize for the highest-ranked first class degree in the University of London. He did Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, for which he was awarded a J T Knight Prize in Class 1, and went on to do his PhD in algebraic topology with Frank Adams at Cambridge.\nCareer\nHe was elected to a research fellowship in Pure Mathematics at Trinity College. Before taking up his Fellowship, he spent two years as L.E. Dickson Instructor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Chicago.\nHe subsequently spent several years in industrial research at\nHP Labs in Bristol, UK. He also served as a Member of Council of the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). In\n2002, Gunawardena become a Visiting Scientist at the Bauer Center for Genomics Research at Harvard. In 2003, he joined the newly formed Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School.\nWork\nGunawardena's PhD thesis led to the solution, with Frank Adams and Haynes Miller, of the Segal conjecture for elementary abelian groups, which provided the algebraic starting point for Gunnar Carlsson's solution of the full conjecture. At the University of Chicago, he helped to set up the first computer science courses at the University. At HP Labs, Gunawardena created the Basic Research Institute in the Mathematical Sciences (BRIMS), a pioneering academic-industrial partnership with the University of Bristol and the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge.\nOne of his most cited papers, \"Multisite protein phosphorylation makes a good threshold but can be a poor switch\" in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,   has received 280 citations according to Google Scholar.\nGunawardena introduced, with Aneil Mallavarapu, the programming-with-models approach to virtual cells, which led to the programming language little b.Together with Marc Kirschner, Lew Cantley, Walter Fontana and Johan Paulsson, he helped set up and co-taught Systems Biology 200, one of the first courses to discuss the core mathematical ideas needed in systems biology. He also founded the weekly series of Theory Lunch chalk talks, which has been running since 2003 and has brought some of the culture of the mathematical sciences into systems biology.\nAt Harvard Medical School, Gunawardena's lab studies information processing in eukaryotic cells, with a focus on mechanisms like post-translational modification, gene regulation and allostery. Gunawardena has had a long-standing interest in the interface between mathematics and biology, on which he has written several perspectives. Gunawardena's essay, ''\"Models in biology: 'accurate descriptions of our pathetic thinking',\" published in BMC Biology'', critiques the limitations of mathematical models in biological research. He argues that many models fail to accurately represent nature and emphasizes the importance of verifiability and falsifiability in their components and conclusions.\nGunawardena's lab has developed over several years a mathematical approach for analyzing biomolecular systems called the 'linear framework in which theorems can be proved about biological processes.\nGunawardena has been exploring the concept of cellular learning, bringing ideas from cognitive science and psychology to bear on the behavior of individual cells. He was awarded a European Research Council synergy grant to study this, '''CeLEARN: learning in single cells through dynamical internal representations','' together with Aneta Koseska, Dietmar Schmucker and Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo.\nSelected publications\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://vcp.med.harvard.edu/ The Virtual Cell Program @ HMS]\n* [https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/jeremy-gunawardena Jeremy Gunawardena's Faculty Profile @ HMS]"
