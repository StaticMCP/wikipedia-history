      "text": "# 1935 Guatemalan presidential term referendum\n\nA referendum on the presidential term of Jorge Ubico was held in Guatemala on 25 May 1935. If approved, it would have allowed Ubico to override the constitutional limitation on serving two consecutive terms in office. It was reportedly approved by 99.85% of voters.\nBackground\nIn 1934, a group of civilians feared that Ubico intended to establish a dictatorship. They planned to assassinate him, and drew in military allies who had lost administrative posts or commands under his rule. However, they were betrayed from within, and many were executed as a result. Six months later, Ubico convened a Constitutional Assembly with the aim of changing the constitution to allow him to remain in office until 1943.\nCongress received thousands of (allegedly) spontaneous and identical petitions from 246 municipalities, which all called for the constitution to be amended to extend his term in office. Ubico then called a referendum on the issue.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|-\n!Choice\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|For||834,168||99.85\n|-\n|align=left|Against||1,227||0.15\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes|| ||-\n|-\n|align=left|Total||835,395||100\n|-\n|align=left colspan=3|Source: Grieb\n|}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*Campang Chang, José.
