The MNR was thus left without a real fleet; even ships abandoned during construction in Northern Italian shipyards (among them many Gabbiano-class corvettes and Ariete-class torpedo boats) were completed for the German Kriegsmarine, that refused to transfer any of them to the MNR.\nThe first Chief of Staff of the MNR was Admiral Antonio Legnani, who however died in a car crash less than a month after the creation of the MNR. He was succeeded by Captain Ferruccio Ferrini.\nJunio Valerio Borghese's Decima Flottiglia MAS was formally part of the MNR, but it operated as a de facto independent unit under Borghese's undisputed leadership. Ferrini did not tolerate this independence; he accused Borghese of having contacts with the Allies and the anti-Communist partisans, and of conspiring to depose Mussolini and replace him at the head of the RSI. In January 1944 Borghese was summoned by Mussolini and placed under arrest, but this immediately brought the Decima MAS personnel on the verge of mutiny; the situation settled after Borghese was released, following German intervention.\nThe fleet of the MNR never amounted to more than a small number of MAS, submarine chasers, midget submarines and assault craft, the latter operated by the Decima Flottiglia MAS. Part of the personnel recruited by the MNR served on Kriegsmarine ships in the Mediterranean, whereas others manned coastal batteries in Northern Italy. Other personnel fought on land alongside the National Republican Army and the Wehrmacht\nSize and ships\nThe Marina Nazionale Repubblicana only reached a twentieth the size of the Allied Italian fleet, and consisted of nine motor torpedo boats (two large and seven small), dozens of MTSM small motor torpedo boats and MTM explosive motorboats. The National Republican Navy also operated fifteen CB-class midget submarines (ten in the Adriatic and five in the Black Sea) and one larger submarine, CM 1, as well as the auxiliary submarine chasers Equa and Antonio Landi, the trawlers Cefalo and Pegaso, and a flotilla of minesweepers based in Venice.\nAn unknown number of MTSMs were active with the navy of the Italian Social Republic. Most of their operations took place in the Adriatic Sea, sometimes with mixed Italian and German crews.\nOf their CB midget class submarines, five were initially given to the Italian Social Republic by Germany, but later ten more boats were transferred by the Germans to the RSI Navy and served in the Adriatic. One was used for spare parts, seven were sunk and two were captured by the Allies.\nOperational history\nDue to its small size, activity by MNR mainly consisted in coastal patrolling and minelaying operations, as well as some limited offensive activity against Allied shipping with MAS and assault craft.\nThe only success by a MNR vessel came on 16 April 1945, a few weeks before its dissolution, when one MTM hit and heavily damaged the French destroyer Trombe off Liguria, Italy. In late April 1945, the MNR ceased to exist following the liberation of Northern Italy and the fall of the Italian Social Republic.\nMany MNR and Decima MAS'' personnel stationed in Istria became victims of the Foibe massacres between April and May 1945.\nList of ships\n:CB-class submarines:\n::*CB1: 27 January 1941–August 1944, scuttled\n::*CB2: 27 January 1941–August 1944, scuttled\n::*CB3: 10 May 1941–August 1944, scuttled\n::*CB4: 10 May 1941–August 1944, scuttled\n::*CB6: 10 May 1941–August 1944, scuttled\n::*CB7: 1 August 1943—?, scrapped\n::*CB13: Late 1943–23 March 1945, sunk\n::*CB14: Late 1943–?, sunk\n::*CB15: Late 1943–?, sunk\n::*CB16: Late 1943–?, captured by British forces\n::*CB17: Late 1943–3 April 1945, sunk\n::*CB18: Late 1943–31 March 1945, sunk\n::*CB19: Late 1943–1947, scrapped\n::*CB20: Late 1943–?, captured by Yugoslavia\n::*CB21: Late 1943– 29 April 1945, rammed by a Marinefährprahm.\n:VAS-class patrol boats:\n::*VAS 207\n::*VAS 225\n::*VAS 238\n::*VAS 252\n::*VAS 253\n::*VAS 255\n::*VAS 263\n:MTSM-class motorboat\n::*MTSM 204\n::*MTSM 230\n::*MTSM 234\n::*MTSM 268\n:MS-class speedboat\n::*MS 16\n::*MS 34\n::*MS 41\n::*MS 71\n::*MS 76\n:MAS-class\n::*MAS 433\n::*MAS 502 January 22, 1944–?\n::*MAS 504 26 October 1943–?\n::*MAS 505 April 10, 1944–?\n::*MAS 525 October 1943–?\n::*MAS 531 2 November 1943–?\n::*MAS 544 November 5, 1943–?\n::*MAS 549 1944–?\n::*MAS 551 1944–?\n::*MAS 553 November 1943–?\n::*MAS 554\n::*MAS 556 January 22, 1944–?\n::*MAS 557 11 October 1943–?\n::*MAS 558 November 8, 1943–?\n::*MAS 561 November 8, 1943–?\n::*MAS 562 November 8, 1943–?\nRanks\nCommissioned officer ranks\nThe rank insignia of commissioned officers.\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|}\nOther ranks\nThe rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|}\nReferences"
