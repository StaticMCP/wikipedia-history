Forty-seven institutions loaned pieces, including 12 in Europe.\nUMMA first exhibited the show, February 17–May 5, 2002.

Included are not just large-scale paintings and sculptures, but also enamels, cameos, medals, illustrated books, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, woodcuts, engravings (both reproductive and original), engravings with etching, saltcellars, and even silver tankards. . . . Unfortunately missing are tapestries, an important vehicle for royal propaganda, but drawings for them are included.\"\nReferences"
