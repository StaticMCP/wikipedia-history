In 1827, Parry attempted one of the earliest expeditions to the North Pole. He reached 82°&nbsp;45'&nbsp;N, setting a record for human exploration Farthest North that stood for nearly five decades before being surpassed at 83°&nbsp;20'&nbsp;N by Albert Hastings Markham in 1875.\nEarly life\nParry was born in Bath, Somerset, the son of Caleb Hillier Parry and Sarah Rigby. He was educated at King Edward's School.\nAt the age of thirteen he joined the flagship of Admiral Sir William Cornwallis in the Channel fleet as a first-class volunteer, in 1806 became a midshipman, and in 1810 received promotion to the rank of lieutenant in the frigate Alexander, which spent the next three years in the protection of the Spitsbergen whale fishery.\nParry took advantage of this opportunity for the study and practice of astronomical observations in northern latitudes, and afterwards published the results of his studies in a small volume on Nautical Astronomy by Night. From 1813 to 1817 he served on the North American Station.\nArctic exploration\nruns west from Lancaster Sound.

This expedition followed the coast of Baffin Bay without making any new discoveries.\n1819: Halfway across the Arctic\nParry and many others thought that Ross was wrong to turn back after entering Lancaster Sound at the north end of Baffin Island. Partly as a result, Parry was given command of a new expedition in , accompanied by the slower  under Matthew Liddon. Others on the expedition were Edward Sabine, science officer and Frederick William Beechey. For protection from ice the ships were clad with  oak, had iron plates on their bows and internal cross-beams.\nThey also carried food in tin cans, an invention so new that there were as yet no can openers. Instead of taking Ross's route anti-clockwise around Baffin Bay (which Ross was charting) he was able to cross the bay straight to Lancaster Sound. Fighting his way through ice he reached clear water on 28 July and entered Lancaster Sound. He passed Ross's farthest west and kept going. Blocked by heavy ice, they went south for more than  into Prince Regent Inlet before turning back.\nContinuing west they passed 110°&nbsp;W (about  west of Lancaster Strait) which entitled them to a £5,000&nbsp;award offered by Parliament. Finally blocked by ice they turned back to a place Parry called Winter Harbour on the south shore of Melville Island, somewhere near 107- or 108°&nbsp;W. Cutting their way through new ice the ships reached anchorage on 26 September.\nHere they were frozen in for the next 10&nbsp;months. There were three months of total darkness and in the new year the temperature dropped to . The men were kept busy with regular exercise while the officers put on plays and produced a newspaper.  The first case of scurvy was reported in January and by March fourteen men were on the sick list, about half with mild scurvy. Parry carried mustard and cress seeds and planted them in his cabin. The leaves seemed to help.\nThere was some excitement in early March when the first melt water appeared, but by the end of the month the ice was still  thick. In June Parry led a group of men dragging a wooden cart to the north shore of the island which he named Hecla and Griper Bay. It was the first of August before the ships were able to float out of the harbour. They got as far west as 113°46'W before turning back. It was too late in the season and new ice was already beginning to form. They reached England in October 1820 having lost one man.\nParry's voyage, which had taken him through the Parry Channel three-quarters of the way across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago was probably the single most productive voyage in the quest for the Northwest Passage. Luck was on their side; 1819 was unusually ice-free and no ship was able to travel so far west until Edward Belcher's expedition in 1850. A narrative of the expedition, entitled Journal of a Voyage to discover a North-west Passage, appeared in 1821, publisher John Murray paying 1,000&nbsp;guineas for it. Upon his return Lieutenant Parry received promotion to the rank of commander. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in February 1821.\n1821: West side of Foxe Basin\nIn April 1821 he again left for the Arctic commanding  accompanied by  under George Francis Lyon. Others with him were George Fisher, scientist and chaplain, William Hooper, purser and diarist, lieutenant Henry Parkyns Hoppner and then midshipmen Francis Crozier and James Clark Ross. Experience from the previous voyage led to improvements. The two vessels were nearly identical since Gripper had not been able to keep up with Hecla, and all the equipment was made to be entirely interchangeable. They had cork insulation, cork plugs for the portholes and an improved heating system, coal-burning stove, placed in the lowest deck to deal with cold and condensation. The men were issued better clothing and lemon juice was stored in kegs rather than glass bottles.\nThe goal this time was to find a passage near the northwest end of Hudson Bay. After working slowly through the ice of Hudson Strait he headed directly west to Frozen Strait which Christopher Middleton had found impassable in 1742. He passed Frozen Strait in a fog and found himself in Repulse Bay which he re-checked and found land-locked. He then ran northeast and mapped the coast of the Melville Peninsula and wintered at the southeast corner of Winter Island. From the Inuit he learned that northward the coast turned west.\nIn March and May Lyon led two sledging expeditions into the interior. Freed from the ice in July they then went north and found the Fury and Hecla Strait, which was ice-filled. They waited for the ice to clear, but it did not. In September Lieutenant Reid trekked  west along the Strait to the ice-filled Gulf of Boothia, the north end of which Parry had approached in 1819. When new ice began to form they went a short distance southeast and wintered at Igloolik.\nThe ship was not freed from ice until 8 August. Since it was late in the season and there were signs of scurvy, Parry turned for home and reached Shetland in mid-October 1823. During his absence, he had been promoted to post rank in November&nbsp;1821, and shortly after his return he was appointed acting Hydrographer of the Navy. His Journal of a Second Voyage, &c., appeared in 1824.\n1824: Loss of Fury at Prince Regent Inlet\nand HMS Fury enter Baffin Bay during the 1824 expedition]]\nIn May 1824 he left London in the Hecla accompanied by Henry Parkyns Hoppner in the Fury. With them were Horatio Thomas Austin, James Clark Ross, Francis Crozier and William Hooper. The goal this time was Prince Regent Inlet at the west end of Baffin Island where he had been blocked by ice in 1819. It was a bad year for ice and he did not reach Lancaster Sound until 10 September. He entered Prince Regent Inlet but after  of ice he was forced to winter at a place he called Port Bowen on the eastern shore.\nIn late July 1825 they freed themselves from the ice, but  further south they were caught by wind and ice and the Fury was driven against the western shore and damaged by the ensuing pressure. After 48&nbsp;hours work on the pumps they made an attempt to deliberately beach the ship for repairs. Stores were unloaded, but by 25 August it was clear that the keel was broken and the advancing ice forced them to abort further efforts. Most of the stores were left on the beach and the crew taken on board the Hecla which reached England in October&nbsp;1825. Parry thought he could see open water south of the wreck site. He published an account of this voyage in 1826.\nThe wreck site, Fury Beach, near  where the coast turns west became an important landmark. Sir John Ross reached it in 1829. He found the hulk gone and many stores, Furys boats and anchors piled on the beach. When his ship was frozen in further south he depended on those stores before being rescued. In 1850, Charles Codrington Forsyth reached it but was blocked by ice.\nFarthest North record\nIn the following year Parry obtained the sanction of the Admiralty for an attempt on the North Pole from the northern shores of Spitsbergen at Sjuøyane. On , Parry married Isabella Louisa Stanley, daughter of John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley, before undertaking the expedition.\nIn 1827, he reached 82°45′N, which remained the highest latitude attained for the next 49&nbsp;years. He published an account of this journey under the title of Narrative of the Attempt to reach the North Pole, &c..\nLater career\nin east London]]\nIn April 1829 he was knighted. Parry served as Commissioner of the Australian Agricultural Company based at Tahlee on the northern shore of Port Stephens, New South Wales, from .\nParry was subsequently selected for the post of comptroller of the newly created department of steam machinery of the Navy, and held this office until his retirement from active service in 1846, when he was appointed captain-superintendent of Haslar Hospital. He reorganised the packet service, which had been transferred from the Post Office to the Admiralty in January&nbsp;1837. Steamship companies were contracted to carry the mail, instead of naval vessels, on a regular schedule.\nHe attained the rank of rear-admiral in 1852, and in the following year became a governor of Greenwich Hospital, and retained this post until his death.\nHe died after a long illness at Bad Ems in Germany on , but his body was returned to London for burial. He is buried in Greenwich Hospital Cemetery. The cemetery is now largely cleared to create a pocket park but he is named on the west face of the Officers Monument in the centre of the area.\nLegacy\n'' by Stephen Pearce, 1851]]\nParry's character was influenced by his religiousness, and besides the journals of his different voyages he also wrote a Lecture to Seamen, and Thoughts on the Parental Character of God (1878, co-author). He was noted as \"an evangelical [Christian] and an ardent advocate of moral reform in the navy.\"\nParry also pioneered the use of canning techniques for food preservation on his Arctic voyages. However, his techniques were not infallible: in 1939 viable spores of certain heat-resistant bacteria were found in canned roast veal that had travelled with Parry to the Arctic Circle in 1824.\nThe crater Parry on the Moon was named after him, as were Parry County, New South Wales, Parry Sound, Ontario, and the optical phenomenon Parry arc, documented by him during the 1819–1821 expedition.\nIn 1930, a large sandstone rock at Winter Harbour on Melville Island marking Parry's 1819 wintering site, approximately  and , was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.\nParry Street in Cooks Hill is named after him due to his work at the A A Company.\nContributions to botany\nParry was cited as the author of some plant species of Greenland in the following documents:\n* ''Journal of a Voyage for the Discovery of a North-West Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific; Performed in the years 1819–'20, in His Majecty's Ships Hecla and Griper ... with an Appendix Containing the Scientific and Other Observations...
