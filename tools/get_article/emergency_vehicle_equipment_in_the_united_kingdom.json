This vehicle is part of the New Dimension programme and consequently does not carry any insignia of Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service.]]\nEmergency vehicle equipment is used in the United Kingdom to indicate urgent journeys by an emergency service.  This usage is colloquially known as \"blues and twos\", which refers to the blue lights and the two-tone siren once commonplace (although most sirens now have a range of tones like Wail, Yelp, Phaser, and Hi-Lo). A call-out requiring the use of lights and sirens is often colloquially known as a \"blue light run\". From 1993-1998 a television documentary following Britain's emergency services was titled Blues and Twos for this reason.\nPermitted use\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%; width:250px\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:100%\" | Legislation that regulates blue flashing lights and sirens\n|\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1989/1796/regulation/3?view=extent Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1986/1078/regulation/37?view=extent Road Vehicle Construction and Use Regulations 1986]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/2559/contents/made Road Vehicles Lighting (Amendment) Regulations 2005]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/2560/contents/made Road Vehicles (Construction and Use)(Amendment)( No.2) Regulations 2005]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/594/contents Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Consequential and Supplementary Amendments to Secondary Legislation) Order 2006]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/3165/contents/made Road Vehicles (Construction and Use)(Amendment)(No.4) Regulations 2009]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/3220/contents/made Road Vehicles Lighting and Goods Vehicles (Plating and Testing) (Amendment) Regulations 2009]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/935/contents/made Road Traffic Exemptions (Special Forces) (Variation and Amendment) Regulations 2011]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/20/section/50 Section 50 of the Deregulation Act 2015]\n*[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/20/schedule/9 Schedule 9 of the Deregulation Act 2015]\n|}\nIn Great Britain, the use of blue lights is regulated by the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989, and sirens by the Road Vehicles Construction and Use Regulations 1986, both of which have been amended by various other pieces of legislation (see right).\nRegulation 16 of the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations 1989 state that no vehicle, other than an emergency vehicle (or a vehicle used for special forces purposes), shall be fitted with a \"blue warning beacon or special warning lamp\", or a device which resembles a blue warning beacon or a special warning lamp, whether it works or not.\nSimilarly, Regulation 37(4) of the Road Vehicle Construction and Use Regulations 1986 prohibit vehicles from having a siren, bell, gong, or two-tone horn, unless the vehicle met the conditions of paragraph 5 (for emergency vehicles), paragraph 6 (for goods inside a vehicle that are on sale), or paragraph 7 (for car alarms, or for summoning help onboard a bus).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Most require the driver to be trained to a particular standard in response driving, but currently, no national standard exists. Provision exists for a national standard to be required in order to utilise speed limit exemptions, but this has not been brought into force.\nRoad traffic exemptions\nSix Metropolitan Police Service motorcycles driving with the blues and twos on. They can be seen breaking a number of normal traffic rules. Each motorbike has driven through a red light, and the motorbike on the far right can be seen driving on the wrong side of the road and passing on the right of a keep left sign.\nIn the UK, vehicles used for certain purposes may have exemptions from some road traffic regulations whilst responding to an emergency. Merely being authorised to use blue lights and sirens does not of itself grant exemptions from road traffic law. These exemptions apply whether or not blue lights and/or sirens are being used, although it is mainly desirable:\n* treating a red traffic light as a give way sign\n* passing to the right of a keep left sign or to the left of a keep right sign (but not disobeying a turn left, turn right, or ahead only sign)\n* driving on a motorway hard shoulder (even against the direction of traffic)\n* exceeding the statutory speed limit (police, fire and ambulance purposes only; and National Crime Agency purposes only, where the driver is trained or is being trained in high-speed driving)\n* stopping on zig-zag lines\n* parking in restricted areas, including against flow of traffic at night\n* leaving the vehicle with the engine running, normally the offence of \"quitting\" (police and ambulance utilising the run lock feature on most cars)\n* using audible warnings outside permitted hours\n* using a bus lane during hours of operation\n* using a siren, bell, gong, or two-tone horn, whether the emergency vehicle is stationary or not\nSee also\n*Battenburg markings\n*Code 3 Response\nReferences"
