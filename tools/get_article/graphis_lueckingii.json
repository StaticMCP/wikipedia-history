Found in southern Brazil, it was fornally described as a new species in 2010 by Manuela Dal-Forno and Sionara Eliasaro. The type specimen was collected by the first author in the Pontal do Paraná, where it was found growing on bark in a forest restinga. The species epithet honours lichenologist Robert Lücking.\nGraphis lueckingii can be identified by its sorediate thallus, prominent  featuring thin and complete thalline margins, a distinct clear hymenium, completely  excipulum, small ascospores that are trans-septate and range from 20 to 23&nbsp;μm in length, and the presence of norstictic acid. Graphis lueckingii shares some features with G.&nbsp;intricata and G.&nbsp;caesiocarpa, but both of these species lack soredia.\n}}"
