At a height of  with 81 stories, the mixed-use building would have been significantly taller than any highrise building in the Vancouver area. The skyscraper also would have had the most floors of any building in Canada, exceeding the 78 floors of Aura in Toronto, Ontario. However, due to the proposed height of the project, there was concern that the skyscraper may interfere with air traffic heading to Vancouver International Airport.\nSee also\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences"
