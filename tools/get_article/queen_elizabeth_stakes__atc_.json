Prize money in 2013 was A$500,000 and was increased to A$4,000,000 in 2014 to become the richest race of the Sydney Autumn Carnival and as of 2020 the third richest WFA race in Australia (after the W. S. Cox Plate and the Everest).\nHistory\n, 1908 winner]]\n, 1946 winner]]\n, 1941 winner]]\n, 1930 winner]]\n, 1947 & 1948 winner]]\nThe origins of this race are firmly associated with colonial Sydney and the growth of thoroughbred racing in the colony during the 1840s and 1850s. The Australian Jockey Club initiated an autumn race meet which coincided with the Easter holiday period and created several races which exist even today. One of these races was the Queen's Plate in honour of Queen Victoria which was first run in 1851 over a distance of about 3 miles.\nThrough the early 20th century the race continued to hold its prestige, but with the decline in long distance racing, the AJC focused on the Sydney Cup as the premier long distance event of the AJC Autumn Carnival.  By the mid 1950s the race had changed its name and had its distance shortened. Distance was changed several times until today's distance of 2000 metres in 1986.\nThe ATC focused on the Queen Elizabeth Stakes as it became the  signature event of a new Sydney autumn racing series called \"The Championships\", attracting international entries.\nName\n*1851&ndash;1872 - Queen's Plate\n*1873&ndash;1927 - AJC Plate\n*1928 - AJC King's Cup\n*1929&ndash;1933 - AJC Plate\n*1934 - AJC King's Cup\n*1935&ndash;1954 - AJC Plate\n*1954 onwards - Queen Elizabeth Stakes\nIn February 1954, Queen Elizabeth II visited Australia and the Australian Jockey Club consequently named a new race in her honour. She was present at Randwick on 6 February 1954 and witnessed 33/1 long shot Blue Ocean win the race with a track record of 2 minutes  seconds for the  miles race.\nOn the last day of the 1954 AJC Autumn Carnival was the last-named race for the AJC Plate, as Lancaster won the Weight for Age 2-mile race. The next year, on the last day of 1955 AJC Autumn Carnival held on 16 April 1955, the fourth race on the card was the Queen Elizabeth Randwick Stakes over a distance of  miles.\nDistance\n*1851&ndash;1913 – 3 miles (~4800 metres)\n*1914 -  miles (~2400 metres)\n*1915&ndash;1922 – 3 miles (~4800 metres)\n*1923&ndash;1927 -  miles (~3600 metres)\n*1928 -  miles (~2400 metres) (AJC Kings Cup)\n*1929&ndash;1933 -  miles (~3600 metres)\n*1934 -  miles (~2400 metres) (AJC Kings Cup)\n*1935&ndash;1941 -  miles (~3600 metres)\n*1944&ndash;1946 -  miles (~2800 metres)\n*1947&ndash;1953 -  miles (~3600 metres)\n*1954 -  miles (~2400 metres) (Queen Elizabeth Stakes)\n*1954 – 2 miles (~3200 metres) (AJC Plate)\n*1955&ndash;1969 -  miles  (~2800 metres)\n*1970&ndash;1971 -  miles (~2400 metres)\n*1972 -  miles (~2800 metres)\n*1973&ndash;1978 – 2400 metres\n*1979&ndash;1983 – 2000 metres\n*1984&ndash;1985 – 2400 metres\n*1986 onwards - 2000 metres\n1934 racebook\nFile:1934 AJC KINGS CUP RACEBOOK P1.jpg|1934 AJC Kings Cup racebook front cover\nFile:1934 AJC Kings Cup Racebook P5.jpg|1934 AJC Kings Cup showing raceday officials\nFile:1934 AJC KINGS CUP RACEBOOK P2.jpg|1934 AJC Kings Cup starters and results the winner, Rogilla\nFile:1934 AJC KINGS CUP RACEBOOK P3.jpg|1934 AJC Kings Cup starters and results\nFile:1934 AJC Kings Cup Racebook P6.jpg|1934 AJC Kings Cup racebook showing semaphore flags\nFile:1934 AJC KINGS CUP RACEBOOK P4.jpg|Back cover showing charges at the entrance gates\n1954 racebook\nFile:1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes Racebook P1.jpg|1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes racebook front cover\nFile:1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes Racebook P2.jpg|1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes showing raceday officials\nFile:1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes Racebook P3.jpg|1954 Queen Elizabeth Stakes starters and results\nFile:1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes Racebook P4.jpg|1954 Queen Elizabeth Stakes starters and results\nFile:1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes Racebook P5.jpg|1954 Queen Elizabeth Stakes showing the winner, Blue Ocean\nFile:1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes Racebook P6.jpg|1954 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes showing Band Entertainment program\nRecords\nOnly Carbine (1889–91), Trafalgar (1909, 1911–12), David (1921–23) and Tulloch (1958, 1960–61) have won the race 3 times.
