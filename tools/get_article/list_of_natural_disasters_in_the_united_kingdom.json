The summer (and possibly the spring in London/south) of 1252 was outstandingly dry/hot, with the ensuing drought ruining crops and many people died from the excessive heat. Spring/summer 1253 was also noted as dry/hot London/south.\n|-\n| 1287 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | St. Lucia's flood || Not known by that name, the flood killed hundreds in England. This flood, along with the South England flood of February 1287, contributed to the decline of Dunwich as a major port.\n|-\n| 1315–17 || style=\"background: rgb(255,250,205)\" | Great Famine || Throughout Europe.\n|-\n| 1324 || style=\"background: rgb(255,225,225)\" | 10 years of hot summers || Drought in summer (London/south).

The climatological summer (June, July and August) of 1666 was amongst the top 10 or so of warm summers in the Central English Temperatures (CET) series (began 1659). CET also suggests that July 1666 had a mean value of , and August was . The heat and long drought added to a heightened risk of fire in populated areas. Lack of rain and hot temperatures helped spark the Great Fire of London (not itself classified as a natural disaster). As a result, this year saw an end to the Great Plague of London due to extreme heat and fire.\n|-\n| 1690s || style=\"background: rgb(255,250,205)\" | Famine ||| Known as the seven ill years, it occurred throughout Scotland, killing 15% of the population.\n|-\n|1697 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Hertfordshire hailstorm |||The most severe hailstorm ever documented in the UK, travelling 25&nbsp;km from Hitchin (Hertfordshire) to Potton (Bedfordshire).

Newspapers ran deaths by heat columns.\n|-\n|1913 || style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | UK tornado outbreak || Series on tornados on 27 October, particularly in England and Wales. This day was the only known time in British history where two tornados exceeded F3 on the Fujita scale. One tornado in Edwardsville, Merthyr Tydfil, resulted in hundreds of injuries and six deaths and is the deadliest-known tornado to occur in the UK. The damage caused was around £100,000.\n|-\n| 1918–19 || style=\"background: rgb(210,255,210)\" | Flu pandemic || Worldwide influenza pandemic nicknamed the Spanish flu.\n|-\n| 1920 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Louth flood || A severe flash flooding event in the Lincolnshire market town of Louth which caused 23 fatalities in 20 minutes.\n|-\n| 1928 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Thames flood || A disastrous flood of the River Thames in London. 14 drowned and thousands were made homeless.\n|-\n| 1931 || style=\"background: rgb(245,222,179)\" | Dogger Bank earthquake || At 6.1 on the Richter Scale, it was the largest earthquake in British history, but caused only minor damage as it was offshore.\n|-\n| 1946–47 || style=\"background: rgb(255,255,255)\" | Severe winter || Right after WWII, blizzards blocked roads and cause blackouts, resulting in industrial stagnation. It was followed by heavy flooding in March, causing £250–375&nbsp;million of damage.\n|-\n| 1952 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Lynmouth Flood || 34 people were killed, with a further 420 made homeless.

In Glasgow alone, over 300 houses were destroyed and 70,000 homes were damaged. Electrical power also failed in Glasgow, leaving the whole city in darkness. In total, the storm felled 8,000 hectares of forest across Scotland (1.6&nbsp;million cubic metres of timber). The storm, which affected Northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, received little attention from the BBC or the national press.\n|-\n| 1976 || style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | Gale of January 1976 || The gale of 2–5 January resulted in severe wind damage across western and central Europe and coastal flooding around the southern North Sea coasts. At the time, this was the most severe storm over the British Isles.\n|-\n| 1974–1976|| style=\"background: rgb(255,225,225)\" | Two-year drought and heatwaves, including the 1976 British Isles heatwave || 1974–1975 was the mildest winter in England and Wales since 1869. However, during the first few days of June 1975, in and around London snow and sleet occurred. During the next week maximum temperatures of  were recorded each day across the country. Later, August 1975 was nationally the second-hottest on record in the nationwide series dating back to 1884, with an extended period starting from late July of temperatures regularly reaching over . August 8th saw temperatures as high as . The autumn of 1975 was notably dry. The summer of 1976 experienced five days of temperatures exceeding  somewhere in the UK. Between 23 June to 7 July, temperatures in London and other parts of Southern England reached above  for 15 consecutive days. The weather was settled and temperatures were above average, with many short and long periods of above  heat, between mid June to mid September. In 1976, the country suffered forest fires, grass fires and water shortages. Summer 1976 was followed by an extremely unsettled autumn.\n|-\n| 1978 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | North Sea storm surge || A storm surge which occurred over 11–12 January caused extensive coastal flooding and considerable damage on the east coast of England between the Humber and Kent. Locally severe flooding occurred in Lincolnshire, The Wash, north Norfolk and Kent. Improvements in flood protection following the devastating flood of 1953 meant that the catastrophic losses seen during that storm were not repeated. The storm caused severe damage to many piers along the east coast of England.\n|-\n| 1981 || style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | UK tornado outbreak || The 1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak is regarded as the largest tornado outbreak in European history. 104 confirmed tornadoes touched down across Wales and central, northern and eastern England. 8 injuries were recorded but there were no casualties.\n|-\n|1981-now\n|AIDS outbreak\n|The first case of AIDS in the United Kingdom was reported in December 1981. The patient was a 49-year-old gay man who regularly visited Florida and was referred to a London hospital with opportunistic infections. The first UK death from AIDS was in London in July 1982, and was attributed to Terry Higgins, who was one of the first people in the UK to die of an AIDS-related illness. Millions of people have died from this plague since 1981.\n|-\n| 1987 || style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | Great Storm || After Michael Fish famously forecast \"very windy\" weather mainly over France, an unusually strong storm occurred in October 1987, with wind speeds widely over  along England's southern coastline, and which killed 18 people in England. The great storm caused substantial damage over much of Southern England, downing an estimated 15&nbsp;million trees (including six of the seven eponymous oaks in Sevenoaks).\n|-\n| Latest 1980s - Late 1990s|| style=\"background: rgb(255,225,225)\" | Recurring droughts, heatwaves and exceptionally mild winters|| Starting from c. November 1988, the UK experienced regular periods of abnormally mild, warm and notably dry conditions over the 1990s. Historically mild winters include 1988/89, 1989/90, 1994/95 and 1997/98, with several other particularly mild spells across other winters, such as in January 1993. Unusually hot spells include the extended summer of 1989, July and August 1990, May 1992, July 1994, the summer of 1995 and August 1997. The periods November 1988 - August 1990 and c. April 1995 - February 1998 were particularly dry for part or all of the UK. Note that there were significant breaks in the drought, and weather at times chaotically swung between dry and wet extremes, so this list may not be exhaustive.\n|-\n| Late 1988 - 1990|| style=\"background: rgb(255,225,225)\" | Prolonged warm and dry conditions, including the 1990 United Kingdom heatwave|| From c. November 1988, part or all of the UK experienced a prolonged warm and dry spell, with winter 1988/89 being the mildest on record. Conditions were particularly warm and notably dry from May to September 1989, with May and July being particularly dry. The abnormally mild conditions returned in winter 1989/90. From March 1990, the southern half of the country experienced a prolonged drought, with consecutive months of below average rainfall. May in particular was historically dry. By July, temperatures were persistently hotter than average, and this culminated in the August 1990 heatwave, which saw three consecutive days above , peaking at a value of  at Cheltenham on the 3rd, which if accurate, was the highest temperature ever recorded in UK history, although this reading is disputed and a figure of  recorded at Heathrow Airport and Cambridge may be more reliable. Temperatures remained elevated for the rest of August and later reached  again. Conditions were less settled from September, but both October and November saw notably warm spells and both the autumn and winter of 1990 remained dry, with significant rainfall only arriving from March 1991.\n|-\n| 1990 || style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | Burns' Day Storm || Winds of up to  kill 47 people and cause £3.37&nbsp;billion worth of damage, the most costly weather event for insurers in British history.\n|-\n|1990–91|| style=\"background: rgb(255,255,255)\" | Severe winter|| Periods of heavy snow and rainstorms lasting from December 1990 to February 1991 throughout the United Kingdom, Ireland and Western Europe. About 42 people died, almost all in the UK and Ireland.\n|-\n|1991–92|| style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | New Year's Day Storm\n|The most violent winds ever successfully recorded unofficially hit the Northern isles of Scotland, with winds exceeding 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h), leading to the deaths of 2 people in Unst, Shetland and 1 person in Frei, Norway.\n|-\n| 1995 - 1998|| style=\"background: rgb(255,225,225)\" | Prolonged hot and dry conditions, including the 1995 United Kingdom heatwave|| Following the dry and hot summer of 1994, from c. April 1995 part or all of the UK experienced extremely dry conditions, with all months between May and August 1995 being notably dry, June and August in particular being among the driest on record. By the end of June, temperatures were regularly surpassing . Between July 30th and August 5th, temperatures remained above , with a peak of  recorded at Boxworth in Cambridgeshire, although this figure is disputed and a more reliable figure is perhaps  recorded at Kew Gardens (a higher figure of  recorded there on the 2nd is unreliable). Temperatures remained elevated all month and August 1995 is the hottest on record in all series. September saw a significant break in the spell, but by October conditions were notably dry again and October in particular was among the mildest on record. A pronounced lack of wetter than average conditions over 1996, along with a notably dry March, meant that the UK was facing significant water supply issues by summer. Autumn 1996 was again dry, and January 1997 was the driest on record. 1997 saw violent swings between notably dry and notably wet conditions, with March, April and October being notably dry, and June being the wettest of the 20th century. From November conditions remained wetter than average, but winter 1997/98 was again dry and mild. From March 1998, conditions turned much wetter and would largely remain wet until the early 2000s.\n|-\n| Early 1998 - Early 2003|| style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Prolonged wetter than average conditions and repeated flooding episodes|| From March 1998, the UK experienced overwhelmingly wetter than average conditions, with few breaks. Both 1998 and 2000 are among the wettest years on record, with particularly wet episodes occurring in April and July 1998, April 2000 and autumn 2000. The latter two are both the wettest of their kind on record. All years between 1998 and 2002 were wetter than usual. Springs had a tendency to arrive late with more colder than average Marches and Aprils than average or warm over this period. Winters were very mild, continuing the spell of mild winters from the 1990s. By 2002 the wetter than average conditions were in decline and the year saw the first notable dry spells since 1997. From February 2003 the UK would see a significantly dry spell with generally drier than average conditions prevailing until May 2007.\n|-\n| 1998 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Easter floods|| At the start of Easter 1998 (9–10 April) a stationary band of heavy rain affected the Midlands. This resulted in floods in which five people died and thousands had to be evacuated from their homes. The wettest area, with over , stretched from Worcestershire towards The Wash and the flooded towns included Evesham, Leamington Spa, Stratford-upon-Avon, Bedford, Northampton and Huntingdon. On Maundy Thursday (9 April), thundery rain in the south of England moved northwards and became slow-moving from East Anglia through the Midlands to north Wales. This band gave some very heavy downpours with hail and thunder. On Good Friday (10th) the band rotated slowly anticlockwise spreading to Lincolnshire and the West Country and continued to rotate, with sleet and heavy bursts of rain in places. There was sleet and snow across the Pennines and north Wales during the evening.\n|-\n| 2000 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Autumn 2000 Western Europe floods|| Severe flooding hit many parts of the UK. Among the worst hit were York, Kent (incl. Maidstone), Sussex (incl. Lewes and Uckfield) and  Shrewsbury.\n|-\n| 2002 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Glasgow floods || 200 people immediately evacuated, and the water supply for 140,000 people was affected.\n|-\n| 2003 || style=\"background: rgb(255,225,225)\" | European heatwave || More than 2,000 people may have died in the UK alone as a result of the hottest summer recorded in Europe since at least 1540, and possibly in thousands of years. Temperatures remained above  for 10 days, between 3 and 13 August. The highest temperature known and accepted was recorded at Faversham, Kent on 10 August when it reached . The death toll across Europe as a result of the heatwave was eventually estimated at 70,000.\n|-\n| 2004 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Boscastle flood || Boscastle and Crackington Haven, two villages in Cornwall, were heavily damaged due to flash floods.\n|-\n| 2005 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Cyclone Gudrun|| Significant flooding was seen in Cumbria, which was the hardest hit area in the UK, and affected more than 3,000 properties.\n|-\n| 2005 || style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | Birmingham Tornado || 30 injuries caused by the tornado, which uprooted trees, destroyed roofs and picked up cars, causing £40&nbsp;million in damage.\n|-\n| 2006 || style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | London tornado || Only one injury, but £10&nbsp;million of damage caused.\n|-\n| 2007 || style=\"background: rgb(200,200,200)\" | Storm Kyrill || Hurricane-force winds across the British Isles, at least 11 people dead.\n|-\n| 2007 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | UK floods || Killed 13 people. Gloucestershire suffered many road and rail closures, power cuts and evacuations, with 420,000 inhabitants left without drinking water requiring emergency assistance from the army. Other areas heavily affected included Yorkshire, Hull and Worcestershire. The disaster is estimated to have caused £6&nbsp;billion of damage.\n|-\n| 2008 || style=\"background: rgb(225,225,255)\" | Floods || River Wansbeck bursts its banks causing damage to 995 properties costing £40&nbsp;million.
