      "text": "# Revolution Brewing\n\n}}\nRevolution Brewing is a brewery in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded as a brewpub in 2010 on Milwaukee Avenue in the Logan Square neighborhood. A separate production brewery, with canning and bottling lines and a tap room, opened in 2012 about a mile from the brewpub, on Kedzie Avenue in the Avondale neighborhood.\nHistory\nRevolution Brewing was started as a brewpub in 2010 by owner Josh Deth. Deth attended the University of Michigan and became interested in brewing from his frequent visits to Bell's Brewery. Deth worked at Goose Island Brewery and connected with head brewmaster Jim Cibak during his time there. Cibak has worked at a number of breweries including Three Floyds Brewing.\nRevolution Brewing has received local and national recognition with awards from the Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup, and Time Out Chicago.\nThe film Drinking Buddies is partly set in the Revolution Brewing brewery and taphouse. A romantic comedy-drama, written and directed by Joe Swanberg, it was shot in 2012 and released in 2013. It stars Olivia Wilde, Jake Johnson, Anna Kendrick, and Ron Livingston. In the movie, the fictional characters portrayed by Wilde and Johnson work at the brewery.\nBeers\nRevolution Brewing produces more than 20 different beers.  Some of them are available year-round, and others are seasonal.  There are also several dozen more beers that were brewed at different times in the past.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Revolution Brewing Beers\n|-\n! Name !! Style !! ABV % !!
