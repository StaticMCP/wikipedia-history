It comes under (NSG2) railway stations category of India.\nHistory\nDuring the period 1893 to 1896, 800 miles of East Coast State Railway was built and opened to traffic. It necessitated construction of some of the largest bridges across rivers like Brahmani, Kathajodi, Kuakhai and Birupa.\nThose days Cuttack was the capital of Orissa and Bhubaneswar was a village, a tehsil under Puri district. Since it was a tehsil a station was built. Later when Bhubaneswar became state capital in 1970, the previously existing station was improved. In 2001 it was electrified and platform no. 3 & 4 were opened.\nMajor trains\nThe train which originates from Bhubaneswar are :\n● Konark Express (11019/11020)\n● Bhubaneswar–Howrah Jan Shatabdi Express (12073/12074)\n● Bhubaneswar–New Delhi Duronto Express (12281/12282)\n● Odisha Sampark Kranti Express (12819/12820)\n● Bhubaneswar–SMVT Bengaluru Weekly Superfast Express (12845/12846)\n● Lokmanya Tilak Terminus–Bhubaneswar Superfast Express (12879/12880)\n● Bhubaneswar–Bolangir Intercity Superfast Express (12893/12894)\n● Visakha Express (17015/17016)\n● Hirakhand Express (18447/18448)\n● Prashanti Express (18463/18464)\n● Bhubaneswar Rajdhani Express (Via Sambalpur City) (20817/20818)\n● Bhubaneswar–Junagarh Express (20837/20838)\n● Bhubaneswar–Visakhapatnam Vande Bharat Express (20841/20842)\n● Rameswaram–Bhubaneswar Express (20849/20850)\n● Puducherry–Bhubaneswar Superfast Express (20851/20852)\n● Bhubaneswar–Chennai Central Express (20853/20854)\n● Bhubaneswar–Anand Vihar Weekly Superfast Express (22805/22806)\n● Bhubaneswar Rajdhani Express (Via Adra) (22811/22812)\n● Bhubaneshwar–Visakhapatnam Intercity Express (22819/22820)\n● Bhubaneswar Rajdhani Express (Via Tatanagar) (22823/22824)\n● Bhubaneswar–SMVT Bengaluru Humsafar Express (22833/22834)\n● Rourkela–Bhubaneswar Intercity Express (22839/22840)\n● Bhubaneswar–Tirupati Superfast Express (22871/22872)\n● Pune–Bhubaneswar Express (22881/22882)\nReferences\nExternal links"
