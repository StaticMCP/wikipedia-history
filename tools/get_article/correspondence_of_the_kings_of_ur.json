They are known primarily from copies dating to the Old Babylonian period, ca. 1800–1600 BCE; their original date of composition and their historical accuracy are debated.\nCopies of the letters\nThe CKU letters are known only through copies written on clay tablets as school exercises by students learning to write cuneiform. All but one of the known copies have been dated to the Old Babylonian period, and were found in cities of Mesopotamia or the broader Near East, including Nippur, Ur, Isin, Uruk, Kish, Sippar, and Susa. A single tablet bearing copies of two of the letters and dating to the Middle Babylonian period was also found at Susa. About 115 cuneiform tablets bearing copies of one or more CKU letters are currently known.\nContent and structure\nThe CKU letters are written in a literary style of Sumerian prose. They loosely conform to the following structure:\n* Address formula: \"Speak to [RECIPIENT], saying (the words of) [ADDRESSOR]:\"\n* Argument\n* Salutation\n* Closing formulas\n**In letters to the king: \"Now my king is informed (about all this)\" and/or \"whatever my king orders me, I will do\".\n**In letters from the king: \"it is urgent\".\nMost of the letters are presented as an exchange between a king of the Ur III dynasty and one of his officials (some of whom are known historical figures, e.g., the general Aradmu and later king of Isin Išbi-Erra), usually discussing matters of state or administration. Some of the topics include: difficulties in dealing with particular officials, the building and repair of fortifications, reports about securing the provinces and the completion of other assignments, and accusations of disloyalty or injustice directed towards other officials.\nList of letters\nLetters addressed to and from Šulgi\n1.

For many years, the letters were treated as one of the best sources of information for reconstructing political events of the Ur III period, especially the end of the kingdom. The modernistic account of the end of the Ur III dynasty, for example (catastrophic collapse due to factors such as Amorite invasions, environmental disasters and crop failures, and the rise of bloated bureaucracy), is largely based on CKU.\nHowever, the historicity of the letters has recently been called into question, sparking at times intense debate among scholars. In 2001, Fabienne Huber published an article entitled \"La Correspondance Royale d’Ur, un corpus apocryphe\", in which she argued that the corpus was entirely apocryphal. This argument was based primarily on the occurrence of post-Ur III linguistic features, of borrowings between the letters, and of post-Ur III personal names and place names. In response to Huber's article, W. W. Hallo wrote a defense of the CKU's authenticity, arguing that nearly all of the letters were copied from Ur III archival letters and can be used as historical sources. Piotr Michalowski, in his 2011 publication of the entire CKU, presented an argument against both viewpoints.\nInstead, he took the position that some elements of authentic Ur III letters were incorporated into the Old Babylonian curriculum, but that these were extensively redacted; in some cases it is possible to tell that a letter was fabricated, while in others, it is more likely that the core of the letter represents original Ur III content. In a review of Michalowski's book, Pascal Attinger defended Huber's position against Michalowski's critiques.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Michalowski, Piotr. 2011.
