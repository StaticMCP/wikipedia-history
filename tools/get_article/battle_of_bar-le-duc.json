Rudolph's nephew, Odo II, continued to dispute this outcome, maintaining his own right to the inheritance.\nConflict\nIn 1037, Conrad II led an army to Italy to put down a rebellion in Lombardy. Odo took advantage of his absence to invade the Duchy of Lorraine and occupy the city of Bar. Emissaries from the rebels in Italy offered him the Kingdom of Italy if he would come to their aid.\nInitially having been taken by surprise, Gothelo I, Duke of Lorraine, had meanwhile been able to raise an army—in part by appealing to Reginard, bishop of Liège, and Albert II, Count of Namur for troops. When their armies met outside Bar, six hours of fighting ensued at the conclusion of which Odo's forces were defeated. Odo himself died in the rout.\nReferences"
