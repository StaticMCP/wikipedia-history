He attributed its performance to competition from rival wargames set during the American Civil War, which had launched not long before War Between the States. It received a \"bronze\" prize in Usenet's \"War-Historical Wargame of the Year\" award category.\nArmchair General said the game \"[...] is highly recommended for turn-based strategy fans.\" but \"Players new to strategy gaming or those looking for light fare might find it a little too deep for their tastes [...]\". Giochi per il mio computer called it a valid alternative to Forge of Freedom: The American Civil War. They praised the robust artificial intelligence (AI) but criticized the lack of scenarios. Wargamer summarized: \"This game achieves everything necessary for strategy gaming greatness.\"  gave a negative review, calling the user interface unclear. No Greater Glory (1991) was noted as a better game about American Civil War.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110511100104/http://www.matrixgames.com/products/357/details/Gary.Grigsby's.War.Between.The.States Official page] (archived)"
