The princess was raised “very simply and strictly” by a Swiss governess. Elisabeth received drawing and painting lessons from the later Rudolstadt court painter Richard Schinzel.\nOn April 17, 1852, she married Leopold III, Prince of Lippe and moved with him to Detmold. Elisabeth remained close to her homeland, and even after her marriage she regularly visited Rudolstadt. The princess was popular with the population, but the couple became increasingly estranged from each other, from which Elisabeth suffered greatly.\nElisabeth was known for her charity and care; she used almost all of the resources at her disposal for charitable purposes. She also published various writings (including a booklet with Bible sayings for every day) and artistically designed Bible and baptismal sayings, but also larger art sheets, all of which were printed in large quantities. The proceeds from these works also benefited charity.\nIn 1861 the princess founded a children's institution in Blomberg, which was named the Elisabeth Institution after her  She also promoted the founding and maintenance of the Augustineum Secondary School in Namibia. Detmold's Elisabethstrasse also bears this name in her honor.\nAfter Leopold's death, the marriage remained childless, Elisabeth moved into her widow's residence in the Neues Palace. From then on she only rarely took on representative tasks, but continued to follow political and social events as well as her social concerns. In 1884 she arranged for Princess Luise (a sister of Woldemar, Prince of Lippe) to hand over her palace to the state pension chamber in order to house the “Princely Public Library” (today Lippische Landesbibliothek).  In addition, the widowed princess financed, among other things, the new building of the Hostel to the Homeland with 30,000 marks in 1885. The gymnasium of the Detmold Girls' School also owed its existence to Elisabeth; she was the patron of this school and the patron of the eight Detmold women's clubs.\nSince the death of her brother George Albert, to whom she shared a close bond throughout her life, Elisabeth stayed regularly in Niederkrossen. She managed the manor there, which became her property after Georg Albert's death. At her initiative, a handicraft school was also set up in town. During her last stay in the fall of 1896, the Dowager Princess contracted pneumonia, as a result of which she died on November 27 at around 11&nbsp;p.m. In accordance with her wishes, Elisabeth was not buried in Detmold, but on December 3, 1896, in the princely crypt of the Rudolstadt town church .\nAncestry\nReferences\nCATEGORY:House of Schwarzburg\nCATEGORY:House of Lippe\nCATEGORY:Princesses of Schwarzburg\nCATEGORY:Princesses of Lippe"
