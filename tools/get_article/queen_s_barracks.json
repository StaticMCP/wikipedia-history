It became the home to the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays) and it was from this regiment that the barracks derived its name. The barracks were subsequently converted to take infantry regiments.\nIn 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot and the 79th (Cameron Highlanders) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot amalgamated with the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot to form the Black Watch with its depot in the barracks in 1881.\nIn the 1960s the Regimental Headquarters and the Regimental Museum moved to Balhousie Castle where the Museum still remains.\nThe barracks were decommissioned in May 1961 and were then demolished. The site became the headquarters of Perth and Kinross Constabulary and then Western Division, Tayside Police.\nIn June 2017 the Black Watch Association unveiled a memorial in the form of a simple stone structure on the site of the former barracks.\nToday, the site is Police Scotland's Perth headquarters.\nArmy Reserve Centre\nThe Army Reserve Centre, located further up the Dunkeld Road, has since adopted the name of Queen's Barracks. It is home to the Battalion Headquarters and Headquarters Company of 7th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland. The Highland Band, and Pipes & Drums, 7 SCOTS is also based here.\nReferences"
