      "text": "# Historic family farms of Licking County, Ohio\n\n}}\nThere are twenty-nine farms within Licking County that have been designated as historic family farms by the Ohio Historic Family Farm Program. This program helps designate farms that have been consecutively owned by the same family for one hundred years or more. Within Licking County, agriculture has always been a significant industry, and in the 1800s, it was a top producer of corn, wheat, and oats. Today, Licking County ranks 11th out of 88 counties in Ohio for products sold, and agriculture is still an important industry. However, many of these historic farms face pressure to sell their farms and land due to increased urbanization and the growth of residential and commercial use of land.\nBackground\nHistoric Family Farm Program\nThe Ohio Historic Family Farm Program is a program that recognizes families who have consecutively owned and farmed their land. There are three designations that are offered by the program: Century Farms (100–149 years), Sesquicentennial Farms (150–199 years), and Bicentennial Farms (200 and more years). The program started in 1993 and honored eight farms each year, but since then the program has changed over time to include more farms with different designations. To be approved into Ohio's Historic Family Farms Program, certain requirements must be met. For example, ten or more acres of land must be used for agricultural use. If the farm is under ten acres, $2,500 of income must be produced yearly. The owners also must provide an 8.5x11-inch map and a current photograph of the farm. Verifiable family records must be shown to prove that the farm has been within 100 years of consecutive ownership by the family. Once a farm has received this designation, the family must continue to farm the land to stay a historic family farm.\nLicking County Historic Family Farms List\nThis is a list of all 29 Historic Family Farms, as of August 5, 2025.

Due to the formation of the Licking County Agricultural Society in 1832, and the formation of both the Ohio and Erie Canal helped boost agriculture in Licking County during this time period. Many different personal accounts discuss the popularity of farming within this time period, and also discuss the success many farmers had. They benefited from easier access to markets via railroads, and different companies would supply tools to local farmers. In the later end of the 1800s, Licking County was in the top ten of counties within Ohio for agricultural production. By 1870, 2,692 farms with 278,611 improved acres were owned by farmers within Licking County; all of these helped account for $3,500,000 in production. Licking County ranked very high within the state of Ohio in production of corn, wheat, and oats while also leading the state in wool production. By 1887, 150,000 acres of designated pasture land was readily available and Licking County ranked first in Ohio with over 174,000 sheep within the county.\nFarming practices through time\nThrough time, these farms have made changes in their crops produced and agricultural methods. In the 19th century, Licking County farms produced a variety of crops like corn, wheat, and oats, along with livestock such as cattle, chickens, pigs and lambs. Farms relied on labor-intensive methods of farming, using crop rationing and the spread of manual manure to keep the soil fertile. Currently, Licking County is focused on large-scale production of grains and oilseeds, in particular corn and soybeans. This accounted for two-thirds of the county's agricultural sales in 2017, according to the USDA Census of Agriculture. In response to the recent economic pressure, many historic farming families have reduced active cultivation for conservation purposes. Modern agricultural methods involve chemicals and mechanization, which support a shift from traditional to modern farming practices. Despite these changes and different pressures, the USDA Census reported that in 2017, 99% of all Licking County farms are still registered as family-owned.\nChallenges facing historic family farms in Licking County in the 21st century\nDespite their recognition, many historic families are facing pressure to sell their farms, due to increased urbanization and commercial growth in areas such as New Albany. Rising land values and frequent offers from developers encourage farmers to sell their land for commercial or residential use. In New Albany urbanization, such as the nine-million-square-foot business park and the addition of over a hundred homes every year, are two examples that may affect the historic family farms in the area. The increasing urbanization and development of residential land may damage the preservation of a family's historic farm.\nOverall impact\nLicking County's historic farms are considered culturally important to the communities in the county. These farms have long standing heritage and 99% are still family owned compared to 87% of farms being family owned in Ohio. This is predicted to change in the future. Family farms have begun to face increased economic difficulties in the county and subsequently, farmers are forced to work other jobs. Additionally, the average age of a farm operator is 56.8 years old and many of these family farms cannot find family members to inherit these farms. Due to this, some historic farms are at risk of losing their Historic Family Farm status.\nReferences"
