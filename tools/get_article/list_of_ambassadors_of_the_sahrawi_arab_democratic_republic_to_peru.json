The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's embassy in Peru was located in Miraflores, a district of Lima. Prior to its opening, the embassy in Caracas was accredited instead.\nBackground\nThe Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was first recognised by Peru through a treaty signed on August 16, 1984, under the presidency of Fernando Belaúnde. Bilateral relations were then formally established in 1987 but ultimately frozen in 1996 due to the Moroccan government pursuing closer relations with Peru as a direct consequence of the recognition, as well as criticisms at home and diplomatic incidents involving both African states.\nAfter relations were suspended, the only Peruvian government to take an interest in the situation in Western Sahara was that of Ollanta Humala, who sent a delegation to the territories administered by the Polisario Front and the Algerian refugee camps, where they met with Sahrawi authorities. During this period, the Sahrawi government was represented through special envoys sent to negotiate the reestablishment of relations.\nAfter 25 years, relations were resumed on September 8, 2021, under the presidency of Pedro Castillo. After a year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Peru announced that it decided to withdraw its recognition of the state on August 18, 2022, but this was disputed by Castillo, who confirmed the recognition of the state on September 8, 2022. Castillo subsequently met with Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamed Salem Uld Salek and speculated on the prospect of opening an embassy in Peru. The embassy ultimately opened in November 2022 and closed on September 23, 2023.\nList of representatives\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  text-align:center;\"\n|+Ambassadors from the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to Peru\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Term begin\n! scope=\"col\" | Term end\n! scope=\"col\" | President\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n|scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=3 |\n| First special envoy and ambassador of the SADR to Peru.
