The result is generally considered a German victory, with the Danish rebel leader, Niels Ebbesen being killed in action.\nBackground\nIn the early 14th century, Denmark was under the control of foreign powers, with Count Gerhard III of Holstein-Rendsburg overseeing a large portion of the country by the 1330s. However, in 1340, a group of 50 Jutes, led by Niels Ebbesen, a minor nobleman, launched a surprise attack on Count Gerhard in Randers, resulting in his assassination which sent shockwaves throughout the country. In the aftermath, Ebbesen and his followers fled south across the Gudenå River, using a bridge to escape.\nAs they continued their revolt further south, Ebbesen and his men stormed a Holsteinian fortification located near present-day Skjern, killing many Germans. Next, Ebbesen sought to capture the strategically important Skanderborg Castle.\nPrelude\nWhile besieging Skanderborg, the besieged Germans received help from a relief force of 600 professional knights, and the Danes were now surrounded on both fronts.\nBattle\nOn a hill outside Skanderborg, the two sides met in open terrain. The Danish force consisted of roughly 2,000 peasants and knights, while the German force was made up of armed knights and cavalry. The ensuing battle was bloody and hard fought and ultimately resulted in the Jutish peasants fleeing and were ousted. Subsequently, the Danish landlords and knights, seeing the now superior German forces, decided to surrender. A massive bloodbath followed with up to 2,200 Danes killed, including Ebbesen and his two brothers.\nAftermath\nAccording to the Lübeck Chronicle, the Danish bodies were dismembered and put on wheels and pillars by the Holsteinian, which may have been interpreted as revenge for the assassination of their father, Gerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, and given as food for the birds.\nAccording to the Chronica Jutensis, the Danes won the battle, however, it agrees with the Lübeck Chronicle that Niels Ebbesen died in the battle. According to the Chronica Sialandie, another final battle should have taken place at Manbjerg.\nLegacy\nAs a memory of the battle of death of Niels Ebbesen, there has been raised a memorial stone in Skanderborg near European route E75. It was raised a couple of years after the Second Schleswig War, when anti-Germanisation was at its highest in Denmark. Additionally, N. F. S. Grundtvig has also published a psalm on Ebbesen's revolt and fall in 1839.\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
