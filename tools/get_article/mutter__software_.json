It became the default window manager in GNOME 3, replacing Metacity which used GTK for rendering. \"Mutter\" is a combination of \"Metacity\" and \"Clutter\".\nWindow management\nMutter can function as a standalone window manager for GNOME-like desktops, and serves as the primary window manager for the GNOME Shell, which is an integral part of GNOME 3. Mutter is extensible with plug-ins, and supports numerous visual effects. GNOME Shell is written as a plug-in to Mutter.\nRelease history\n* Support for HiDPI was added to version 3.13 of Mutter by Adel Gadllah.\n* In version 3.13.2 logind integration replaced mutter-launch.\n* In version 3.13.3 (June 24, 2014) the server side bits of wl_touch_interface were implemented by Carlos Garnacho.\nForks\nMuffin\nMuffin is a fork of Mutter by the Linux Mint team for their Cinnamon desktop environment. Cinnamon's shell, a fork of GNOME Shell, is written as a plugin for Muffin.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://download.gnome.org/sources/mutter/ Mutter tarballs]\n* [https://download.gnome.org/sources/mutter-wayland/ mutter-wayland tarballs]\n* [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/ GNOME git: Mutter]\n* [https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Mutter/Gestures GNOME Wiki: Mutter Gestures]"
