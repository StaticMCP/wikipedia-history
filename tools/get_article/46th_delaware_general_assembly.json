Elections were held the first Tuesday of October and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening January 1, 1822, two weeks before the beginning of the year of the administration of Governor John Collins. He died April 16, 1822, and Governor Caleb Rodney took administration.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Federalist majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Caleb Rodney, Sussex County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Alrichs Ryland, New Castle County\nMembers\nSenate\nSenators were elected by the public for a three-year term, one third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Victor du Pont\n*Charles Thomas Jr.\n*Jacob Vandegrift\n|\n:Kent County\n*Thomas Clayton\n*George Cummins\n*Maylove Hayes\n|\n:Sussex County\n*Jesse Green\n*Joseph Maull\n*Caleb Rodney\n|}\nHouse of Representatives\nRepresentatives were elected by the public for a one-year term.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Jesse Chandler\n*John Harlan\n*Washington Rice\n*Alrichs Ryland\n*William Seal\n*John Sutton\n*William Weldon II\n|\n:Kent County\n*William Hopkins\n*James B.
