It was begun by the Australian Army in 1943 and has been in the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission since 1949 and is maintained by the Office of Australian War Graves.\nThe cemetery contains 96 graves, 2 Royal Navy sailors, 5 Royal Australian Air Force airmen and 89 Australian Army soldiers. 24 of those buried died on 8 May 1943 in the Wodonga level crossing accident when a passenger steam train collided with a bus carrying 34 Australian Army personnel near Wodonga, Victoria, resulting in Australia's largest military funeral at the time.\nA further 18 war graves are scattered throughout the Albury General Cemetery. They died as results of war-related injuries, accidents or illnesses. Also buried in Albury General Cemetery are 4 Australians of the First World War.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
