The crisis began in 1951 after the Iranian government, under the democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, nationalized the British owned Anglo-Persian Oil Company, including the Abadan Refinery. In 1901, local Iranian sovereigns had sold an oil concession covering much of the country's southwest, to William Knox D'Arcy, by the time oil was discovered in commercial quantities in May 1908, D'Arcy was nearly bankrupt and sold his rights to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909. In the decades that followed he British profited immensely from the concession returns, local Iranians employees labored in often abysmal conditions while the APOC earned millions of pounds. The British hid the earnings of APOC from the Iranian government and refused to comply with the profit-sharing terms they had been agreed to.\nThe nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's assets namely oil refinery in Abadan infuriated the British Government who imposed a blockade of Iranian oil exports and began conspiring to overthrow the elected government. Eventually, the CIA orchestrated a successful coup in 1953, which enabled the Shah to rule autocratically for the next 26 years.\nBackground\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Year || style=\"width:10%\" |Date || Event || Significance\n|-\n| 1925 || || Mohammed Mosaddeq opposes coronation of Reza Shah. || Establishing a reputation for integrity.\n|-\n| 1930s || || Mosaddeq is hounded from public life by the powerful Reza Shah. ||\n|-\n| 1941 || || Reza Shah deposed during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran and his son Mohammad Reza Shah is placed on the throne|| Mosaddeq re-emerges as a popular hero.\n|-\n| 1946–1949 || || The National Front, a coalition of parties and groups comes together with the goal of moving Iran's oil resources from British to Iranian control.
