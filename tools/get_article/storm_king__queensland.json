The name presumably comes from the Storm King Dam, which takes its name from the Storm King Mining Company which was established by John Yaldwyn and James Ross, who built an earlier dam for mining purposes. The company, in turn, took its name from the sailing ship Storm King, on which they migrated to Australia, arriving 9 February 1872.\nThe present dam was first proposed in 1928 but was not built until 1954 by the Stanthorpe Shire Council (now Southern Downs Regional Council). It had filled by February 1954.\nDemographics\nIn the , Storm King had a population of 87 people.\nIn the , Storm King had a population of 106 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Storm King.

It is managed by the Southern Downs Regional Council.\nReferences"
