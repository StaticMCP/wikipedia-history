The 2001 reissue includes the Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes written track \"I Am a Camera\", which was previously recorded by Yes on their 1980 Drama studio album (as \"Into the Lens\") and by Downes and Horn themselves on the final Buggles studio album, Adventures in Modern Recording (1981).\nWriting and recording\nBarking at Airplanes is the first studio album Carnes co-produced since ''St. Vincent's Court (1979). The album is noted by Nashville Scene'' as the first synth-pop album produced by a woman. Carnes wrote \"Don't Pick Up the Phone\" and \"Crazy in the Night\" on an ARP String Ensemble. \"Crazy in the Night\" was inspired by her son Collin's fear of the dark. The track opens with three loud door knocks followed by Collin saying, \"Who is it?\". Carnes' writing was inspired by films including Metropolis (1927) and Black Orpheus (1959), with a direct reference to the latter in the track \"He Makes the Sun Rise (Orpheus)\". \"Bon Voyage\" features a sample of tannoy announcements recorded at Charles de Gaulle Airport by a staff member at the French branch of EMI.\nRelease and promotion\nBarking at Airplanes was released on May 29, 1985, by EMI America. In 2001, the album was reissued by EMI-Capitol Special Markets with three bonus tracks; a cover version of \"Into the Lens\" (retitled as \"I Am a Camera\") by Yes, \"Forever\" written by Steven Van Zandt, and a demo version of Carnes singing \"Make No Mistake, He's Mine\". Carnes became aware of this reissue during an interview with Nashville Scene in 2020, and said she never intended for them to be released.\n\"Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes)\" was released as the album's lead single in April 1985. It spent a total of sixteen weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at no. 15. The song also reached no. 24 on the Dance Club Songs chart and no. 22 on the Cash Box Top 100 Singles chart.

It spent four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at no. 67. The track received two extended remixes by Rusty Garner and Jack Witherby. \"Rough Edges\" was released in the US and Canada as the album's third single in October 1985. In the same year, \"Bon Voyage\" was released as a single exclusively in the Netherlands.\nCritical reception\n| rev2      = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Barking at Airplanes as a \"cohesive and consistent album\" and her best outing since Mistaken Identity.\nPeople stated that Carnes has \"never recorded an album as pleasing as this\", noting her \"enchanting\" voice.\nTrack listing\n| length2      = 3:32\n| title3       = Begging for Favors (Learning How Things Work)\n| writer3      =\n| length3      = 4:52\n| title4       = He Makes the Sun Rise (Orpheus)\n| writer4      =\n| length4      = 4:28\n| title5       = Bon Voyage\n| writer5      =\n| length5      = 4:44\n| title6       = Don't Pick Up the Phone (Pick Up the Phone)\n| writer6      =\n| length6      = 4:19\n| title7       = Rough Edges\n| writer7      =\n| length7      = 4:44\n| title8       = Abadabadango\n| writer8      =\n| length8      = 3:58\n| title9       = Touch and Go\n| writer9      = Clive Gregson\n| length9      = 4:48\n| title10      = Oliver (Voice on the Radio)\n| writer10     = Kim Carnes\n| length10     = 3:46\n| total_length = 42:46\n}}\n| length11     = 5:11\n| title12      = Make No Mistake, He's Mine\n| note12       = solo version\n| writer12     = Kim Carnes\n| length12     = 4:13\n| title13      = Forever\n| writer13     = Steven Van Zandt\n| length13     = 3:58\n}}\nPersonnel\n* Kim Carnes – lead vocals, backing vocals (1–5, 7–10)\n* Bill Cuomo – synthesizers (1, 3, 4, 9), drum programming (1, 2, 6), Kurzweil synthesizer (5, 10), Yamaha DX7 (5, 10), keyboards (6, 7), additional synthesizer (8), Roland JX-3P (10)\n* Duane Hitchings – synthesizers (8), Oberheim DMX programming (8)\n* Waddy Wachtel – electric guitar (1), backing vocals (1, 6), guitars (2, 6, 8)\n* Lindsey Buckingham – guitars (3), lead and backing vocals (3)\n* Craig Hull – guitars (3, 9)\n* Chas Sanford – guitars (4)\n* Ry Cooder – guitars (7)\n* Erik Scott – bass (3, 6, 7, 9)\n* David Jackson – bass (4)\n* Leland Sklar – bass (5, 10)\n* Craig Krampf – drum programming (1, 2, 6), backing vocals (1, 6), drums (3, 9, 10), Oberheim DMX (3, 9)\n* Gary Mallaber – drums (4)\n* Paulinho da Costa – percussion (2, 4, 5, 9)\n* Jerry Peterson – saxophone (3, 4, 8, 9)\n* Dave Ellingson – backing vocals (1–4, 6–8, 10)\n* Daniel Moore – backing vocals (1, 4, 6–8), lead vocals (8)\n* Julia Tillman Waters – backing vocals (4, 7–10)\n* Maxine Waters Willard – backing vocals (4, 7–10)\n* Niko Bolas – backing vocals (6)\n* Martha Davis – backing vocals (7)\n* James Ingram – backing vocals (7)\nProduction\n* Kim Carnes – producer\n* Bill Cuomo – producer (1–7, 9, 10)\n* Duane Hitchings – producer (8)\n* Mark Ettel – recording engineer\n* Sabrina Bucharek – second engineer\n* Tony Chiappa – second engineer\n* Judy Clapp – second engineer\n* Denny Densmore – second engineer\n* David Egerton – second engineer\n* Steve MacMillan – second engineer\n* Niko Bolas – additional engineer\n* Richard Bosworth – additional engineer\n* Duane Seykora – additional engineer\n* Mike Shipley – mixing (1–5, 8–10)\n* Ian Taylor – mixing (6, 7)\n* George Marino – mastering at Sterling Sound (New York City, New York)\n* Sue McGonigle – project coordinator\n* Henry Marquez – art direction\n* Jay Vigon – design\n* Richard Seireeni – design\n* Eric Blum – back cover photography\n* Greg Gorman – front cover photography\n* Matthew Rolston – inner sleeve photography\n* Michael Brokaw – direction\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1985)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n| 40\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Release formats for Barking At Airplanes\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n|-\n| Worldwide\n| May 5, 1985\n|\n| EMI\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | United States\n| 2001\n| rowspan=\"2\" | CD\n| EMI-Capitol Special Markets\n|-\n| May 23, 2014\n| Culture Factory\n|-\n| Worldwide\n| September 1, 2017\n| Digital download\n| Capitol Records, LLC\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
