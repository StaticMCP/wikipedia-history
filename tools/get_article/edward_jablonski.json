His father had been a writer for Sztandar Polski and another relative, Paul F. Jablonski, wrote for The Bay City Times. Early on he fell in love with the music of George and Ira Gershwin. A fan letter he wrote to Ira while in school quickly turned into regular correspondence and eventually a lasting friendship with the lyricist.\nWhile Jablonski was interested in music, his true fascination was with aviation. Supposedly, he spent much of his time watching the planes at the James Clements Airport near the South End of Bay City. Later on in his life, he became interested in aerial warfare. Telling an interviewer in 1986, \"Aviation makes possible the most deadly form of warfare ever -- the perversion of one of man's greatest inventions.\"\nMilitary and writing career\nHe served in the United States Army Field Artillery in New Guinea during World War II.  For his actions in New Guinea, he was awarded the Silver Star.\nAfter leaving the army, he attended junior college in Bay City as a pre-journalism major. He continued his studies at the New School for Social Research, receiving his bachelor's in 1950. He also completed postgraduate work in anthropology at Columbia.\nIn 1949, Jablonski and  co-founded Walden Records. The company was a short-lived recording studio in New York City that specialized in American pop music.\nWhile working for the March of Dimes charity in New York, Jablonski wrote articles and music reviews for a number of small magazines as well as liner notes for albums; this was the beginning of a fifty-year freelance career.\nAt the time of his death, he was working on Masters of American Song, which would have been a comprehensive history of American pop music.\nWorks\n*\n*\n*  (1968 )\n*\n*\n*  (1979  )\n*\n*\n*  Reprinted by DaCapo press in 1982.\n*\n*\n*  (1985 paperback , 1996 )\n*  (paperback )\n*\n* Harold Arlen.
