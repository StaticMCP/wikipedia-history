The show was held in Nashville, Tennessee, at the Nashville Arena. Live coverage on The Nashville Network was hosted by John Tesh and Naomi Judd, with a one-hour pre-show hosted by Clarence Gilyard and Kathy Troccoli. This would be the last full national telecast of the event until 2003 (the hosting network would evolve into fare which the award show likely would not have fit within).\nResults\n;Song of the Year\n\"On My Knees\"; David Mullen, Nicole Coleman-Mullen, Michael Ochs (Seat of the Pants Music/Word Music (ASCAP), Ochsongs Music (BMI))\n;Songwriter of the Year\nSteven Curtis Chapman\n;Male Vocalist of the Year\nSteven Curtis Chapman\n;Female Vocalist of the Year\nCrystal Lewis\n;Group of the Year\nJars of Clay\n;Artist of the Year\nRich Mullins\n;New Artist of the Year\nAvalon\n;Producer of the Year\nBrown Bannister\n;Southern Gospel Album of the Year\nLight of the World; The Martins; Michael Sykes, Lari Gross; Spring Hill\n;Southern Gospel Recorded Song of the Year\n\"Butterfly Kisses\"; The Rock Cries Out; Tim Greene, Bob Carlisle, Randy Thomas; New Haven\n;Inspirational Album of the Year\nArtist of My Soul; Sandi Patty; Robbie Buchanan; Word\n;Inspirational Recorded Song of the Year\n\"A Baby's Prayer\"; Love and Mercy; Kathy Troccoli; Kathy Troccoli, Scott Brasher; Reunion\n;Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year\nBehind the Eyes; Amy Grant; Keith Thomas, Wayne Kirkpatrick; Myrrh\n;Pop/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year\n\"Let Us Pray\"; Signs of Life; Steven Curtis Chapman; Steven Curtis Chapman; Sparrow\n;Contemporary Gospel Album of the Year (formerly Contemporary Black Gospel)\nPray; Andrae Crouch; Andrae Crouch, Scott V.
