He invented the commutator. In 1828, Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical DC motors: the stator, rotor and commutator.\n|\n|-\n| Before 1830,&nbsp;Johann Michael Ekling\n| Austrian, mechanic; constructed an electric motor according to the plans of Austrian physicist Andreas von Baumgartner.\n|\n|-\n| 1831 Michael Faraday\n| British, scientist; discovered and investigated induction law in terms of electric current generation in a varying magnetic field.\n|\n|-\n| 1831,&nbsp;Joseph Henry\n| American, physicist; Created a mechanical rocker, which he however describes as a philosophical toy.\n|\n|-\n| 1825–1833 William Sturgeon\n| British, scientist; 1825 – invented the electro-magnet; 1833 – built first commutated rotating electric machine that was demonstrated in London.\n|\n|-\n| 1832–33,&nbsp;Hippolyte Pixii\n| French, instrument maker, built the first AC generating apparatus out of a rotation; and, the following year, an oscillating DC generator.\n|\n|-\n| 1833,&nbsp;Joseph Saxton\n| American, inventor; demonstrated a magneto-electric machine before the British Association for the Advancement of Science.\n|\n|-\n| 1833,&nbsp;Heinrich Friedrich Emil Lenz\n| German; formulated the law of reversibility of generators and motors.\n|\n|-\n| 1834–1839,&nbsp;Moritz von Jacobi\n| German-Russian, engineer and physicist; built a 15 watt motor in 1834 submitted to the Academy of Sciences in Paris with details published in 1835; demonstrated first use of electric motor to propel a boat; first real useful rotary electrical motor.\n|\n|-\n| 1837,&nbsp;Thomas Davenport and Emily Davenport\n| American, blacksmith-inventor and inventor; obtained first US electric motor patent.\n|\n|-\n| 1837–1842,&nbsp;Robert Davidson\n| Scottish, inventor; developed electric motors for a lathe and a locomotive.\n|\n|-\n| 1838,&nbsp;Solomon Stimpson\n| American; built a 12-pole electric motor with segmental commutator.\n|\n|-\n| 1840,&nbsp;Truman&nbsp;Cook\n| American; built electric motor with a PM armature.\n|\n|-\n| 1845,&nbsp;Paul-Gustav Froment\n| French, engineer and instrument maker; first of various motors; first motor translated linear \"electromagnetic piston's\" energy to wheel's rotary motion. See also Mouse mill motor.\n|\n|-\n| 1856,&nbsp;Werner Siemens\n| German, industrialist; invented generator with a double-T armature and slots windings.\n|\n|-\n| 1861–1864,&nbsp;James Clerk Maxwell\n| British, scientist; reduced electromagnetism knowledge in four key equations.\n|\n|-\n| 1871–1873,&nbsp;Zénobe Théophile Gramme\n| Belgian, engineer; developed the anchor ring motor which solved the double-T armature pulsating DC problem; at Vienna exhibition, demonstrated to great effect ability to transmit between generator and motor 1&nbsp;km apart.\n|\n|-\n| 1879,&nbsp;Walter Baily\n| British; based on Arago's rotations, by manual switching on and off, developed the first primitive commutatorless induction motor.\n|\n|-\n| 1880, Marcel Deprez\n| French engineer; by the progressive shifting of a magnetic field through the mechanical commutator in regular order around a center, electric currents are being developed by induction in a rotating metal mass without sliding contacts or commutator.\n|\n|-\n| 1885,&nbsp;Galileo Ferraris\n| Italian, physicist and engineer; invented the first AC commutatorless induction motor using two-phase AC windings in space quadrature. Delivered a paper on it in April 1888.\n|\n|-\n| 1887, M. Borel\n| Constructed a two-phase motor where the rotor is set in rotation by the combined rotating field produced with two sets of coils.\n|\n|-\n| 1887, Helios Co.\n| Based on Coerper's patent, Helios Co. constructed the first 3-phase motor with three slip-rings. The project was dropped in 1890 as they could get satisfactory results using a 2-phase current.\n|\n|-\n| 1887,&nbsp;Friedrich August Haselwander\n| Friedrich August Haselwander develops the first AC 3-phase synchronous generator in Europe. The patent application filed in July 1887.  His first generator of this type went into operation in October 1887.\n|\n|-\n| 1887, Charles S. Bradley\n| Motor/generators with a Gramme ring, having multiple radial connectors, led off at corresponding symmetrical points to slip-rings. He thus obtained alternate currents differing in phase.\n|[https://patents.google.com/patent/US390439A/en?oq=390439 US390439A]\n|-\n| 1887–1891,&nbsp;Nikola Tesla\n| Serbian-American, engineer and inventor; having worked independently from Ferraris, presented a paper in May, 1888 to AIEE describing three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately-excited DC supply to rotor winding. Westinghouse acquired exclusive rights to the Tesla patents as well as the Ferraris design and retain Tesla as a consultant for a short time to work on development of these motors.\n|\n|-\n| 1886,&nbsp;Frank Julian Sprague\n| American, industrialist; development of new constant-speed DC motor, which allowed the Sprague company to issue the world's \"first important industrial electric motor catalogue\".\n|\n|-\n| 1889–90,&nbsp;Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky\n| Polish-Russian, engineer and inventor; invented the first cage and wound rotor versions of the three-phase induction motor that are still widely in use today.\n}}"
