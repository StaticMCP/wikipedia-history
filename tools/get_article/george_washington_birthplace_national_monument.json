It commemorates the birthplace location of George Washington, a Founding Father and the first President of the United States, who was born here on February 22, 1732. Washington lived at the residence until age three and later returned to live there as a teenager.\nHistory\n17th&ndash;18th centuries\nJohn Washington, George Washington's great-grandfather, settled this plantation in 1657 at the original property on Bridges Creek. The family acquired expanded land to the south toward nearby Popes Creek.\nPrior to 1718, the first section of the house was built. His father enlarged it between 1722&ndash;1726. He added on to it by the mid-1770s, making a ten-room house known as \"Wakefield\". This house, which George Washington in 1792 would describe as \"the ancient mansion seat,\" was destroyed by fire and flood on Christmas Day 1779, and never rebuilt.\nGeorge Washington was born in the house on February 22, 1732. Thirty-two graves of Washington family members have been found at the Bridges Creek cemetery plot, including George's half-brother, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.\nWashington's father owned enslaved people and had them cultivate tobacco on his several plantations, as his ancestors had done.\n19th century\nIn 1858, the Commonwealth of Virginia acquired the property to preserve the homesite and cemetery. In 1882, however, Virginia donated the land to the federal government following the Civil War.\n20th century\nThe Wakefield National Memorial Association was formed in 1923 to restore the property. In 1930, the grounds were authorized by Congress as a U.S. National Monument. In 1931, the Wakefield Association received a grant from John D. Rockefeller Jr., to acquire and transfer a total of  of land to the Federal government.\nSince the exact appearance of the original Washington family home is not known, a Memorial House was designed by Edward Donn Jr., representing similar buildings of the era; it was constructed on the approximate site in 1931. The actual location of Washington's boyhood home is adjacent to the memorial house and its foundation is outlined in the ground by crushed oyster shells.\nThe Memorial House represents a typical tobacco plantation of the period of the original's construction. The Memorial House is constructed of bricks handmade from local clay. It has a central hallway and four rooms on each floor, furnished in the 1730&ndash;1750 period style by the Wakefield National Memorial Association. Furnishings include an 18th-century tea table believed to have been in the original house. Most of the other furnishings are more than 200 years old. At the entrance to the grounds, now maintained and operated by the National Park Service, is a Memorial Shaft obelisk of Vermont marble; it is a one-tenth scale replica of the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.\nThe park and Memorial House were opened by the National Park Service in 1932, on the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth.\n21st century\nIn the 21st&nbsp;century, the Monument is part of the National Park Service's ongoing efforts to interpret historical resources. In addition to the Memorial House, park facilities open to visitors include the historic birthplace home area, Kitchen House, hiking trails, and picnic grounds. In the Kitchen House, costumed re-enactors demonstrate candle- and soap-making.\nA colonial herb and flower garden has been planted with herbs and flowers common to Washington's time, including thyme, sage, basil, and flowers such as hollyhocks, forget-me-nots, and roses. Typical trees and bushes of Washington's time have also been added to the landscaping. The Colonial Living Farm has a barn and pasture and raises livestock, poultry, and crops that were typical in the 18th century and using farming methods that were common at the time.\nVisitors may also tour the Washington family Burial Ground, which contains the graves of 32 members of the Washington family, including George Washington's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Replicas of two original gravestones are visible, along with five memorial tablets placed here in the 1930s.\nThe Visitors' Center contains artifacts recovered from the burned-down Washington house, including a bowl, clay figurine, wine bottle seal belonging to Augustine Washington, wine bottle, and keyhole plate.\nA 15-minute film depicting Washington family life is shown in a theater at the Visitors' Center.\nDirections\nThe George Washington Birthplace National Monument is  east of Fredericksburg, Virginia, located on the Northern Neck. It can be reached via VA Route 204, the access road to the site from VA State Route 3.\nSee also\n* List of national monuments of the United States\n* List of residences of presidents of the United States\n* Northern Neck George Washington Birthplace AVA\n* Washington's Birthday\n* Montross, Virginia\n* Stratford Hall Plantation\n* State Route 204, the access road to the site from State Route 3\nReferences\n* Gary W.
