The start is traditionally confirmed moon sightings within the United Kingdom via the New Cresent Society often in collaboration with the Royal Observatory Greenwich, though some minority communities rely on announcements from Saudi Arabia's astronomical calculations though the validity of this is within Sunni Islam is disputed.\nPredicted Ramadan dates in the United Kingdom (1447–1457 AH)\nThe table below shows predicted start dates for Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr in the United Kingdom according to crescent visibility data published by the HM Nautical Almanac Office, as applied by the New Crescent Society (NCS), the leading UK moonsighting organisation.

Due to the UK’s longer daylight hours fasting reaches up to 16–17 hours in summer. Just like other mosques the London Central Mosque host nightly Taraweeh prayers, with Quran recitation competitions and translations in sign language for inclusivity. The \"Night of Power\" (27th Ramadan) is commemorated with extended prayers and Quranic readings.\nCulinary traditions and Iftar meals\nBreaking the fast with Iftar is a cherished tradition. In the UK, Iftar meals often feature a blend of traditional dishes from various cultures. Common items include dates, lentil soups, samosas, and kebabs. Resources like BBC Good Food offer a collection of recipes tailored for Ramadan, ranging from energizing Suhoor options to hearty Iftar dishes.\nRestaurants and supermarkets in the UK often cater to the increased demand for halal food and special Ramadan delicacies.\nCharitable activities and community engagement\nCharity is a cornerstone of Ramadan. In the UK, initiatives like the Ramadan Tent Project exemplify this spirit by hosting free Open Iftar events in iconic locations such as Trafalgar Square and the Victoria and Albert Museum. These events aim to foster cross-cultural understanding and community cohesion by inviting people of all backgrounds to share in the Iftar experience.\nOrganizations like the Muslim World League in London host interfaith meals with Christian, Jewish, and Bahá’í leaders, fostering social cohesion.\n\"Iftar With Your Neighbour\" a Projects that invite asylum seekers and non-Muslims to share meals, emphasizing solidarity.\nPolitical leaders, including the Prime Minister, issue Ramadan greetings, raising awareness and hosting Iftar Party.\nEconomic impact\nThe term \"Ramadan Rush\" emerged in 2011 to describe the surge in retail activity during Ramadan, attributed to an influx of wealthy Middle Eastern visitors to the UK.\nRamadan significantly contributes to the UK economy, with estimates suggesting its total economic impact ranges between £800 million and £1.3 billion annually. This includes retail spending on food, clothing, and gifts, as well as charitable contributions. The travel and tourism sector also experiences a boost, as many Muslims travel to visit family and friends or embark on holidays during this period. Recent reports indicate that the UK's Ramadan economy has grown rapidly over the past decade, reflecting the increasing purchasing power and influence of British Muslims.\nMedia coverage and public perception\nMedia representation of Ramadan has seen notable developments. In 2025, the BBC broadcast Eid prayers live from Bradford Central Mosque for the first time. However, media portrayals can also spark controversy; for instance, London Mayor Sadiq Khan faced criticism over his Eid message referencing international conflicts, leading to debates about the politicization of religious observances.\nSee also\n* Ramadan in Pakistan\n* Ramadan in the United States\n* Ramadan in Turkey\nReferences\nExternal links"
