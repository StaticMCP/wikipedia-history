The monument was a token of gratitude for the support provided by Perón to the Francoist regime during the immediate period after World War II, amid the international isolation of the dictatorship.\nDesigned by Agustín de la Herrán, the full-body leading sculpture, cast in bronze and 2.10 metre high, represents a standing Perón, dressed with a full dress uniform and carrying the presidential staff. The design of the granite plinth was entrusted to a municipal architect of the Ayuntamiento de Madrid.\nThe inscription in the main plaque displays the  (\"Paladin of the Argentine–Spanish friendship\") epithet.\nThe monument was unveiled on 1 July 1975, on occasion for the first anniversary of Peron's death, in the Madrilenian avenue already named after him during a ceremony attended by the  (Mayor of Madrid),  (Argentine ambassador),  (Minister of Information and Tourism), Pedro Cortina Mauri (Minister of Foreign Affairs), and the Duke of Cádiz (President of the ), among others. Before the inauguration, authorities paid a visit to the nearby Monument to Isabella the Catholic in order to deposit a floral tribute.\nReferences"
