      "text": "# Best Female Track Athlete ESPY Award\n\nThe Best Female Track Athlete ESPY Award was presented annually between 1993 and 2006 to the female track and field athlete, irrespective of nationality, adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year. Beginning in 2007, this award was combined with the parallel Best Male Track Athlete ESPY Award into the single Best Track and Field Athlete ESPY Award.\nBetween 1993 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter was exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.\nThrough the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter were conferred in June and reflected performance from the June previous.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Athlete\n!Nation represented\n!Event(s) contested\n|-\n|1993\n|Evelyn Ashford\n|\n|100 metres, 4 × 100 metres relay\n|-\n|1994\n|Gail Devers\n|\n|100 metres, 100 metres hurdles, 4 × 100 metres relay\n|-\n|1995\n|Gwen Torrence\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100 metres relay\n|-\n|1996\n|Kim Batten\n|\n|400 metres hurdles\n|-\n|1997\n|Marie-José Pérec\n|\n|200 metres, 400 metres\n|-\n|1998\n|Marion Jones\n|\n|100 metres, 4 × 100 metres relay, long jump\n|-\n|1999\n|Marion Jones\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100 metres relay, long jump\n|-\n|2000\n|Marion Jones\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, long jump\n|-\n|2001\n|Marion Jones\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100 metres relay, 4 × 400 metres relay, long jump\n|-\n|2002\n|Marion Jones\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, long jump\n|-\n|2003\n|Gail Devers\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100 metres relay\n|-\n|2004\n|Gail Devers\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100 metres relay\n|-\n|2005\n|No award presented\n|\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|Allyson Felix\n|\n|200 metres\n|}\nSee also\n* List of sports awards honoring women\n*Best Male Track Athlete ESPY Award\n*European Athlete of the Year Award\n*IAAF Athlete of the Year Award\n*IAAF Golden League\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
