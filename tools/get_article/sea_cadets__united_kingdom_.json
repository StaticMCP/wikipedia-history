Cadets follow an ethos, training plan and rank structure similar to that of the Royal Navy, and are recognised by the UK Ministry of Defence.\nHistory\nIn 1854, a vicar in Whitstable, Kent returned from the Crimean War and founded an orphanage where sailors taught nautical skills to prepare orphans for future careers. Multiple similar orphanages were founded across the country, and the organisation became known as the Naval Lads' Brigade. In 1899 Queen Victoria presented £10 (around £1,000 today) to the Windsor Unit to purchase uniforms.\nIn 1910, the Navy League sponsored a small number of units as the Navy League Boys' Naval Brigade, and in 1919 the organisation adopted the name Navy League Sea Cadet Corps. Lord Nuffield donated £50,000 in 1937 to fund an expansion of the Corps.\nKing George VI became the Admiral of the Corps in 1942 and the name was changed to the Sea Cadet Corps. The Sea Cadets had approximately 400 units and 50,000 Cadets. The Girls Naval Training Corps was also formed (later renamed Girls Nautical Training Corps in 1950). Queen Elizabeth II became the Patron of the Sea Cadets in 1952. In 1955 the Sea Cadet Council agreed to the formation of the Marine Cadet Section. The Girls Nautical Training Corps became affiliated with the Sea Cadet Corps in 1963. The Royal Naval Association began planning the first British colonial unit in Bermuda in 1964, with TS Bermuda formed on 12 January 1966. Located at Admiralty House, Bermuda, it was followed by two further units (TS Venture at the former Roman Catholic chapel of the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda and TS Admiral Somers at Convict Bay, St. George's, another former Admiralty property).\nOn 31 March 1980 the Ministry of Defence approved the admission of girls into the Sea Cadet Corps. The successful integration of girls into the Sea Cadet Corps led to the dissolution of the Girls Nautical Training Corps in 1992.\nEthos\nThe Sea Cadets' ethos is made up of three parts: its values, its mindset, and the customs and traditions of the Royal Navy. The promise made by every cadet who joins the Sea Cadet Corps is as follows:\nThe Sea Cadet Promise:\nI promise to serve my God, my King, my country, and, the Sea Cadet Corps and to obey the orders of my superior officers. I will be proud of my uniform and be smart and seamanlike in wearing it, and, always do my duty.\nThe ethos is underpinned by the Sea Cadet Values which are: Courage, Commitment, Discipline, Respect, Loyalty, Honesty, and Integrity. These are taught by staff throughout the time cadets are with a unit; chaplains will also take a lead in such delivery.\nCadets\nJunior Sea Cadets\nFor 9 to 12-year-olds, Junior Cadets have their own training programme and uniform, based on a more practical version of the Sea Cadets training programme.\nSea Cadets\nFor 12 to 18-year-olds, young people can join as a Sea Cadet and work their way up through the training programme.\nRoyal Marines Cadets\nFor 13 to 18-year-olds, the Sea Cadets has detachments of Royal Marines Cadets.\nAdmiral of the Sea Cadet Corps\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2013 payouts totalled £64,782, and in 2014 payouts totalled £544,213.\nIn 2017, a Panorama episode entitled \"Cadet Abuse Cover-Up\" highlighted sexual abuse cases in the British Cadet Forces. In a 1979 case of sexual abuse of a 14-year-old cadet in Hertfordshire, the boy's parents were dissuaded from reporting the offender to police by Sea Cadet officers in full uniform, who had visited their home. The offender was neither dismissed or suspended but instead promoted to oversee 10 cadet units in London. Further historical cases have been investigated with settlements being made. In the years 2012 to 2017 there were 28 allegations of sexual abuse made against SCC volunteers, including historical allegations. All 28 offenders were dismissed and referred to the police.\nSee also\nOther elements of the Community Cadet Forces\n* Royal Marines Cadets\n* Army Cadet Force\n* Air Training Corps\nOther MoD sponsored cadet forces\n* Combined Cadet Force\n* Volunteer Cadet Corps\nOther Sea Cadet organisations\n* Australian Navy Cadets\n* Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps\n* Royal Canadian Sea Cadets\n* Hong Kong Sea Cadet Corps\n* New Zealand Sea Cadet Corps\n* United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps\nRelated articles\n* Marine Society and Sea Cadets\n* Reserve Forces and Cadets Association\n* Cadet Vocational Qualification Organisation (CVQO)\n* Laurie Brokenshire\n* Girls' Nautical Training Corps\n* National Association of Training Corps for Girls\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n__FORCETOC__"
