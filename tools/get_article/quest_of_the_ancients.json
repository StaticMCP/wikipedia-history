      "text": "# Quest of the Ancients\n\nQuest of the Ancients is an independent role-playing game published in the late 1980s by Unicorn Game Publications.\nGameplay\nIt is mainly a Dungeons & Dragons clone, in that it was character class- and level-based, used a Dungeon & Dragons style Vancian Magic system, and used a skill system similar to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons thief skill system.  Most notably, it used a thirty sided die (or d30) for combat resolution.\nWritten by Vince Garcia of Fresno, California, the game system implements a large number of character classes.\nReception\nStewart Wieck reviewed Quest of the Ancients in White Wolf #28 (Aug./Sept., 1991), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that \"This game would be deserving of extra attention if the author had included more information about the game world or even a sample adventure (a pet peeve of mine). As it is QA is a game without a world, and since there are plenty of FRPGs available, there is nothing to distinguish this one beyond being what the new edition of AD&D should have been.\"\nReferences\nSources\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20080522202607/http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showline&gamelineid=267\n* http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/encyclopedia/alphabetical/P-Q.html"
