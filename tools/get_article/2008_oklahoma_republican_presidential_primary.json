It was a closed primary, meaning only registered Republicans could vote in the election. The primary was on Super Tuesday on the same day as twenty-three other states. John McCain won Oklahoma's primary with 37% of the vote, although Mike Huckabee picked up some delegate votes as well by receiving 33% of the vote.\nEleven candidates appeared on the Oklahoma Republican Party primary: John McCain, Tom Tancredo (withdrawn), Duncan Hunter (withdrawn), Ron Paul, Rudy Giuliani (withdrawn), Jerry Curry, Mitt Romney, Alan Keyes, Fred Thompson (withdrawn), Daniel Ayers Gilbert, and Mike Huckabee.\nThe filing period ended December 5, 2007, after which candidate was allowed to be added to the ballot.  No candidate could withdraw his name after the withdrawal deadline of December 7, 2007.  Consequently, four candidates' names appeared on the ballot despite their withdrawal from the election.[http://www.ok.gov/~elections/08cal.html 2008 ELECTION CALENDAR]\nPolling\nEarly polling in Oklahoma showed Oklahoma Republicans preferred Rudy Giuliani over John McCain.

At-large delegates are awarded to each state regardless of its size. At-large delegates are pledged to the presidential candidate who receives the most primary votes statewide.\n* 13 bonus delegates.
