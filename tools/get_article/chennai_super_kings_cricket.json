The company was incorporated on 19 December 2014. The name itself was derived from its first and flagship franchise Chennai Super Kings (CSK), which plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\nAs of 2023, the major share holders include India Cements Shareholders Trust (30%), Saradha Logistics (6.9%) and Life Insurance Corporation of India (6%). The company took over the ownership of CSK in 2014. It also owns the teams Joburg Super Kings in SA20 and Texas Super Kings in Major League Cricket.\nHistory\nIn 2008, Indian Premier League, a franchise based T20 tournament was launched by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Chennai Super Kings (CSK) was acquired by India Cements, a company owned by N.Srinivasan, then president of BCCI. The BCCI had an existing clause in its regulations which prohibited administrators of BCCI from holding commercial interests in the matches conducted by the board. This was modified to enable the ownership of franchises in the IPL by members linked to the BCCI. In 2014, the Supreme Court of India admitted a petition which challenged the amendment and cited conflict of interest. Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited was incorporated on 19 December 2014. To avoid complications arising out of the conflict of interest case, the ownership of CSK was transferred to the new company. The amendment to the BCCI clause was later voided by the Supreme Court of India in 2016.\nOwnership\nChennai Super Kings Cricket Limited is incorporated as a public limited company.
