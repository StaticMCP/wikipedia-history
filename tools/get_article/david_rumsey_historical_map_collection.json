The collection was created by David Rumsey who, after making his fortune in real estate, focused initially on collecting 18th- and 19th century maps of North and South America, as this era \"saw the rise of modern cartography.\"\nAfter 2004 Rumsey expanded the collection to include maps from the 16th through 21st centuries, covering more of the world. In 2008 the collection's website was cited as one of only seven websites with freely available \"skillfully compiled carto-bibliographic entries with corresponding early-map images.\" At that time the site comprised 16,000 digital images.\nIn February 2009, David Rumsey announced that the entire collection would be donated to Stanford University, including 150,000 maps and their digital images, as well as the database used to track the images. Stanford houses the collection in the new David Rumsey Map Center which opened in the main library in 2016. The website (where the images are posted on-line) was to continue as a separate public resource.\nAs of July 2025, there were over 141,000 digitized items available through the website, hundreds of which were hosted through Google Earth layers. Select maps are also featured at the Rumsey Maps island in Second Life. as well as 2D and 3D GIS. A new MapRank search tool has been added enabling geographical searching of about 60,000 maps from the collection by map location and coverage. In addition, a georeferencing tool has been added that allows site users to georeference and display any of the maps in the collection. The website has additional viewers from Luna Imaging, Inc, including the LUNA browser which doesn’t require any special plug-ins or software to view the collection, zoom into image detail, create slide shows, media groups, or presentations.\nThe website also has a blog listing new additions to the collection, featured maps, news, videos, and related sites.\nWhen a document is found on the website, it is usually accompanied by extensive metadata, such as author, date of publication, short title, type, dimensions, note(s), area, full title of the document, full title of the publication it may be part of with notes and download options.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*O'reilly Network: [https://web.archive.org/web/20050605003522/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/06/02/davidrumsey.html Historical Maps Online] by David Rumsey 2005\n*Wired.com: [https://www.wired.com/2002/03/this-is-a-real-quest-for-maps/ This Is a Real Quest for Maps]\n*Technology Review: [http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/20357/?a=f Historical Maps in Second Life]\n*PBS Newshour: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/paper-maps-vs-digital-maps New Digital Maps vs Old Paper Maps video]\n*Harper's Magazine, September, 2012: [http://rumsey3.s3.amazonaws.com/images/harpers/HarpersJelly-Shapiro.pdf \"All Over the Map: A Revolution in Cartography\"]\n* 2011 Digital Humanities conference, [http://www.davidrumsey.com/blog/2011/7/11/reading-historical-maps-digitally-how-spatial-technologies-can-enable-close-distant-and-dynamic-interpretations keynote address]"
