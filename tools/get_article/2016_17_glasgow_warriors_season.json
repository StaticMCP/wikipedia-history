It was the team's last season under head coach  Gregor Townsend. Due to the flooding of its grass pitch, an artificial turf surface was installed at Scotstoun Stadium.\nOverview\nCoaching changes and new pitch\nIt was announced at the beginning of the season that it would be the last under head coach Gregor Townsend. Townsend was announced as taking over the Scotland head-coach role from Vern Cotter in the summer of 2017. The SRU named Townsend's successor, Dave Rennie (New Zealand head coach of the Super Rugby Chiefs), two days later. The Chiefs had won the Super Rugby title twice under Rennie.\nJason O'Halloran and Jonathan Humphreys were later also announced as joining the Warriors for the 2017–18 season. To avoid the problems which plagued the 2015–16 season (when Scotstoun Stadium became unplayable due to flooding), a new artificial-grass pitch was installed at the stadium.\nObjectives\nSince this would be head coach Gregor Townsend's last season with the Warriors, a good European run was a key target; the Warriors had never qualified for the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup.\nThe Pro12 league began in 2011–12. Every year since then, the Warriors had made the play-offs during the final weeks; this was another target. The 1872 Cup had been held by Edinburgh Rugby for the previous two seasons, despite Glasgow finishing above Edinburgh in the Pro12 league in every year of Townsend's tenure, and Glasgow wanted the cup back west.\nResults\nA mixed season saw the team qualify for the European Champions Cup quarter-final for the first time, losing to the eventual champion Saracens. The Warriors missed a Pro12 play-off place for the first time, and the Autumn International and Six Nations Championship were particularly challenging.\n}}\nAlthough the Warriors won the 1872 Cup, they lost their home match to Edinburgh for the first time.\nTownsend era\nDuring Gregor Townsend's five-year tenure with the Warriors, he guided the team to the 2014-15 Pro12 title and a European Champions Cup quarter-final for the first time in 2016–17. Except for this season, the team made the Pro12 play-offs every year he was head coach.\n}}\nTeam\nCoaches\n* Head coach:  Gregor Townsend\n* Assistant coach:   Matt Taylor\n* Assistant coach:   Kenny Murray\n* Assistant coach:   Dan McFarland\n* Assistant coach:   Mike Blair\n* Lead Strength and Conditioning Coach:  Stuart Yule\n* Asst.

The Warriors were eager for the match, and secured a try bonus victory at Galway Sportgrounds; Peter Horne later said, \"I think that really told when we finally played them in the first game of the season and hammered them. It was frustration about why we hadn't been able to do it at the end of last year.\"\nThe next match, against Leinster, saw Tommy Seymour run in four tries in another five-point victory for the Warriors. This set up an intriguing away match with Cardiff Blues, another team which started well. The Blues saw out a tight match, and the Warriors only managed a losing bonus point.\nFinn Russell, back from his freak injury in the end-of-season match against Connacht, started against Ulster. Again, the Warriors contented themselves with a losing bonus point.\nAn away win against Newport Gwent Dragons and two bonus-point wins against the Italian sides Treviso and Zebre put the Warriors in a good place before the Autumn Internationals, when they lost fifteen players to the national team. Another three Warriors were also asked to train with the Scotland squad: Ali Price, Nick Grigg and Rory Hughes. Four international players (Simone Favaro, Nemia Kenatale, Djustice Sears-Duru and Langilangi Haupeakui) were called up for their respective countries before Sila Puafisi was called up to play for Tonga. A rapidly-growing injury list which sidelined Leonardo Sarto, Richie Vernon, Ryan Grant, Adam Ashe, Greg Peterson, Scott Cummings, Tjiuee Uanivi and Chris Fusaro also tested the Warriors' depth. They lost both of their Autumn International matches, against the Scarlets and the Ospreys. The run of defeats continued with a one-point loss to Munster at the start of December.\nOver the winter period, with the international players returning, the Warriors again began winning matches. A healthy lead in the first leg of the 1872 Cup against Edinburgh led to wins against Treviso and Cardiff.\nIn the Six Nations window, the Warriors provided most of the Scotland national team. Strength and depth again became an issue; three successive losses to Scarlets, Ulster and Ospreys left Glasgow Warriors trailing those teams battling in the play-off hunt.\nThe international players returned, and the Warriors' results improved. Wins against Newport Gwent Dragons, Connacht and Zebre were a belated challenge for a top-four place, but losses to Munster and Leinster ended Glasgow's play-off hopes.\nThe Leinster defeat, on 28 April 2017, cost the Warriors its record as the only team which had qualified for a top-four place every year since the Pro12 began in 2011–12. The match, at the RDS Arena in Dublin, was strange; the match was topsy-turvy, with Leinster initially leading before the Warriors took control. Leinster edged ahead with a penalty, and then the stadium lights went out. It looked like the Dublin side would win the match with the abandonment rule, but the referee waited; about 20 minutes later, the lights came back on and Leinster saw out the remainder of the match.\nThe final Pro12 match was the second leg of the 1872 Cup against Edinburgh Rugby at Scotstoun Stadium. Glasgow was eager to return the cup back to the west after Edinburgh had won it two seasons before. Although Edinburgh won the match (their first 1872 Cup victory in Glasgow), they could not overturn the margin which the Warriors had built up in the away match at Murrayfield Stadium. The Warriors' seventh 1872 Cup win was bittersweet, as it was Gregor Townsend's last match with the Glasgow side.\nResults\n|score = 5 - 41\n|report = [http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/news/16/09/02/harley-connacht-perfect-place-start Preview][http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/match-report/connacht-vs-glasgow-warriors-sat-03092016-1715 Report][http://www.glasgowwarriors.com/articles/match/009427.php Report][http://www.pro12rugby.com/report/glasgow-warriors-humble-champions-connacht/ Report]\n|away =  Glasgow Warriors (1 BP)\n|try1 = Adeolokun 32' m\n|try2 = Seymour (2) 10' m, 36' mHogg 45' cSwinson 52' cPuafisi 58' cLamont 70' c\n|con2 = Pyrgos (3/5)Rory Clegg (1/1)\n|pen2 = Pyrgos (1/1) 24'\n|stadium = Galway Sportsgrounds\n|attendance = 6,063\n|referee = Ian Davies (Wales)\n}}\n|score = 33–25\n|report = [http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/news/16/09/09/glasgow-warriors-set-make-debut-scotstoun%E2%80%99s-artificial-pitch Preview][http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/match-report/glasgow-warriors-vs-leinster-rugby-sat-10092016-1500 Report][http://www.glasgowwarriors.com/articles/match/009428.php Report][http://www.pro12rugby.com/report/inspired-seymour-scores-four-warrior-tries/?FixGuid=16GL6008 Report]\n|away =  Leinster\n|try1 = Seymour (4) 15' m, 53' c, 55' c, 73' cSwinson 31' c\n|con1 = Pyrgos (4/5) 31', 53', 55', 73'\n|try2 = R.

They were drawn against the previous year's finalists Racing 92 and past winners Munster and Leicester Tigers. Since it had been announced that this would be Gregor Townsend's last season with the Warriors, a huge focus for the season would be for Glasgow to get out of the pool stages and qualify for a quarter-final.\nGlasgow's previous best in the Heineken Cup was a quarter-final play-off in 1997, when they lost to Leicester Tigers. This season's Tigers were first up in the pool stage.\nThe match at Scotstoun was a 42–13 victory for the Warriors, with the Glasgow side running in five tries. The untimely death of Munster coach Anthony Foley postponed Munster's match with Racing 92, and Munster's next match would be against the Warriors at an emotionally-charged Thomond Park. Foley's death seemed to galvanise the Munster side, and they were 38–17 victors in a difficult match.\nA tough doubleheader against last year's finalists was next for the Warriors. Racing 92 had New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter and former Glasgow Warrior favourite Leone Nakarawa in their ranks; Glasgow side crushed the French side in Paris, however, with Townsend describing the victory as the second-best of his Warriors coaching career (after the 2014-15 Pro12 final against Munster).\nA home tie proved the Paris result no fluke, as another special night at Scotstoun saw the Warriors dominate Racing. In particular, Finn Russell's outplaying of Dan Carter in back-to-back matches thrust the Scotland fly-half into Lions contention. Townsend said, \"Finn deserved to be in the Lions conversation before the games against Racing but he’s playing with lots of confidence and parts of his game have got really strong over the last couple of years. Finn’s been up against Dan Carter and a lot of other big players in big environments, too. He’s started at Scotland at stand-off for the last two-and-a-half years so even though British & Irish rugby is full of quality players, I expect him to be in the mix.\"\nAn emboldened Munster came to Scotstoun and ground out a three-point win. The last Pool 1 game for Glasgow was at Welford Road in Leicester. The Warriors went to Leicester with purpose, and gave the Tigers their worst result in European history. The Tigers failed to score, and Glasgow ran in six tries for a 43–0 victory. By the end of the match, the Warriors pushed for 50 points in the Tigers' 22. Leicester's Freddie Burns was tackled, and the ball about to be turned over when Burns reached out for the touchline to end the match and avoid another Warriors score. The Warriors were the first Scottish team to defeat Leicester at home since the Fettesian-Lorettonian Club managed it 112 years before, when they won by a try to nil on 28 December 1905 with Jobson scoring the three points.\nThe Warriors qualified for a European Champions Cup quarter-final for the first time in their history. They drew Saracens away and, as the European champions, Sarries were heavy favourites. Still 6,000 Warriors fans went to London, however, and provided the Aviva Premiership team with their largest home attendance at Allianz Park. The first half was tighter than expected; a few attempted tries by Saracens were ruled out for infringements, but the London club led.  Warriors captain Jonny Gray was taken off injured; returning from injury in his first game back, Greg Peterson tried to cover Gray's absence.\nThe second half began well for the Warriors, and a try by Lee Jones brought a period of Warriors dominance. A missed kick to touch by Finn Russell to consolidate Warrior pressure into a lead was the turning point of the match, however, and the Saracens began running in tries. A consolation try at the end by Ryan Wilson was the Warriors' only reply.\nTownsend later blamed himself for the defeat, saying that he had over-analysed the Saracens and prevented Glagow from playing their own game: \"Nothing might have worked, because Saracens are so good, but I got it wrong\". Despite the loss, the Warrior Nation made many friends and Glasgow were now firmly on the European rugby map. Saracens would go on to the European Champions title, again defeating Clermont in the final at Murrayfield Stadium.\nResults\n|score = 42–13\n|report =  [http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/news/16/10/13/reid-set-make-100th-appearance-leicester-come-town Preview][http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/match-report/glasgow-warriors-vs-leicester-tigers-fri-14102016-1945 Report][http://www.glasgowwarriors.com/articles/match/009470.php Report][http://www.epcrugby.com/matchcentre/33594.php Report]\n|away =  Leicester Tigers\n|try1 = Sarto (2) 24' c, 76' cBrown 28' cPyrgos 33' mBennett 68' c\n|con1 = Russell (4/5) 24', 28', 68', 76'\n|pen1 = Hogg (1/1) 14'Russell (2/2) 55', 67'\n|try2 = Thompstone 20' c\n|con2 = O.
