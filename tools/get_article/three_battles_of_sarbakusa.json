They pitted Wand Bewossen and Fasil of Damot against the forces of Emperor Tekle Haymanot II and Ras Mikael Sehul, with the former prevailing. This led to the end of Mikael Sehul's hegemony in imperial politics and the marginalization of Tekle Haymanot. According to James Bruce, the Meridazmach Amha Iyasus led 1,000 horsemen in support of Emperor Tekle Haymanot at Sarbakusa.\nReferences"
