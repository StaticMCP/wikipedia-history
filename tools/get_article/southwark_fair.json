      "text": "# Southwark Fair\n\nSouthwark Fair is a 1733 genre painting and engraving by the British artist William Hogarth.\nThe scene, which was first called simply \"A Fair\" and only later became associated with Southwark Fair, shows theatrical performances, musicians, a rope-dancer and other entertainers. A stage collapses during a performance. The old church of St. George the Martyr can also be seen, which was torn down and replaced by a new church at the time the picture was executed.\nIt is said to depict a view of a fair being held in the Borough of Southwark, then a separate settlement from London on the south side of London Bridge. Dating back to 1409, the fair had originally lasted for three days but by Hogarth's time it continued for around two weeks. It was abolished in 1762 because of increasing vice and disturbance.\nToday, the painting is in the collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum in Ohio.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Einberg, Elizabeth.
