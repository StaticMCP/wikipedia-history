Towards the end of the period, the texts appeared in the tombs of royal wives.\nMiddle Kingdom\nThese are a collection of ancient Egyptian funerary spells written on coffins beginning in the First Intermediate Period. Nearly half of the spells in the Coffin Texts derive from those in the Pyramid Texts.\nNew Kingdom\n*Book of the Dead\n*Amduat\n*Spell of the Twelve Caves\n*The Book of Gates\n*Book of the Netherworld\n*Book of Caverns\n*Book of the Earth\n*Litany of Re\nLate New Kingdom\n*Books of the Sky\nAfter the Amarna Period, a new set of funerary texts began to be used. These centre on representations of Nut, the sky goddess. They represent the nighttime journey of the sun into and through her body, with her giving birth to the rejuvenated sun in the morning. From the tomb of Ramesses IV onwards two of these Books of the Sky were usually placed next to each other on the ceiling of royal tombs.\n* Book of Nut\n* Book of the Day\n* Book of the Night\n* Book of the Heavenly Cow\nLate Period\n*Books of Breathing\nPtolemaic\n*Book of Traversing Eternity\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
