When, after a week, Garrard failed to do so, two brigades of infantry and three brigades of cavalry with artillery support were advanced against the Confederate positions on June 9.  Two charges failed, and the Union Army retired from the field. However, Wheeler's cavalry was moved to a position between Bell's Ferry and Canton Road.\nOn June 10, the 17th Indiana Infantry Regiment pushed the enemy across Noonday Creek after heavy fighting.\nOn June 15, a division of Union cavalry attacked and was repelled.  On June 17, the Federals pushed Wheeler down Bell's Ferry Road, where he retired to Robert McAffee's house located at the intersection of today’s Barret Parkway and Bells Ferry Roads. This location is often confused with the house of Doctor John McAfee, which was located at the intersection of the Canton and Marietta Road, and the Old Alabama Road in Woodstock. On June 10 Colonel Robert H. G. Minty’s First Cavalry Brigade (U.S.) consisting of the 4th U.S. Cavalry, 4th Michigan Cavalry, and 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiments, and the Chicago Board of Trade Battery crossed Noonday Creek on the Old Alabama Road, and proceeded to McAfee’s Crossroads, where Doctor McAfee’s Home was located. Upon approaching the crossroads the 7th Pennsylvania became heavily engaged, but drove in the Rebel pickets, and occupied the crossroads. While Minty was deploying his line he was attacked by two brigades of Major General William T. Martin’s division, and the entire division of Wheeler's cavalry. After fighting for about an hour the 7th Pennsylvania made a saber charge, and drove the Confederates south on the Canton and Marietta Road for a mile, until they entrenched on the crest of a hill. After an unsuccessful assault on that position, Minty withdrew back across Noonday Creek on the Old Alabama Road. Minty’s Brigade remained in position near McAfee’s Crossroads skirmishing daily with Wheeler’s Confederate Cavalry until June 20.\nOn June 19, the Union Army attacked but was driven off with heavy losses.\nOn June 23, Colonel Eli Long, USA, crossed Noonday Creek with his brigade. He was attacked at that time, and repelled the attackers.\nThe 4th Michigan Cavalry was attacked by 4,500 of Wheeler's cavalry at Latimar's Mill on Little Noonday Creek near Noonday Church.\nSince the Civil War\nDespite  land development since the 1980s in the area near Town Center at Cobb, the McAfee house (and a historical marker at the street) is still located on Bells Ferry Road, on the northwest corner of what is now the intersection with Barrett Parkway (west) and Piedmont Road (east).
