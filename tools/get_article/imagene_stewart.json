She ran the House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center in Washington, D.C.\nEarly life and education\nStewart was born in Dublin, Georgia, the daughter of J. C. Bigham and Mattie Watkins Bigham. Her father was a pastor. She graduated from Washington Technical Institute and the Wesley Theological Seminary.\nCareer\nChurch work and leadership\nStewart joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as a young woman and attended the 1963 March on Washington. She was one of the first women ordained in the National Baptist Convention denomination and had her own congregation, the Greater Pearly Gate Full Gospel Baptist Church. In 1969, she co-founded the Afro-American Women's Clergy Association and was president of the association in the 1990s. She hosted a Sunday morning radio show. In 1996, she was made a bishop in the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship denomination.\nHouse of Imagene shelters\nIn 1972, drawing from her own experience of homelessness, Stewart opened the House of Imagene, a shelter serving homeless veterans. She preached and served free meals on troubled street corners. In 1974 she opened a women's shelter for domestic violence survivors, in Prince George's County, Maryland. In 1981, she received an Outstanding Women of the Year award from the NAACP, for her shelter work.\nStewart accepted no government funding for her shelter program; instead, she courted the attention and support of wealthy and conservative political and military leaders, including the Reagans and Bushes. She attended Ronald Reagan's inaugural ball in 1981, telling a reporter \"I may be poor and broke, but there's no sense hanging around with those who are poor and broke.\" Political commentator Armstrong Williams helped her pay the shelter's back rent in 1997. The House of Imagene struggled financially for years, and permanently closed after a fire in 2010.\nChaplaincy and other work\nStewart was an inventory management specialist at the Government Publishing Office in the 1970s. She was the first Black national chaplain to the American Legion Auxiliary, elected in 1993. She was also chaplain to the Tuskegee Airman Civil Air Patrol at Andrews Air Force Base. She officiated at veterans' funerals, and spoke and wrote about honoring the American flag. In 1999, she demonstrated in front of the Justice Department with other religious leaders, seeking an investigation into the FBI's response at Waco in 1993.\nPersonal life\nStewart's first husband was Lucius Johnson; they married in 1958. Her second husband was Albert Stewart. She had two sons. She died in 2012, at the age of 69, from ovarian cancer.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.c-span.org/video/?1319-1/veterans-day-salute/ A 1987 appearance by Stewart] on C-Span, introducing Colin Powell when he spoke to the American Legion Auxiliary for Veteran's Day that year\n* [https://www.c-span.org/person/?36456/ImogeneStewart/ Other appearances by Stewart on C-Span], from 1994 to 2002"
