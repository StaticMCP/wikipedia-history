The game features a three-dimensional game engine and individual modeling of game character behaviors. The game was released in Spain and Italy in December 2006 by FX Interactive under the name Imperium Civitas. The difference in naming is explained by the popularity of Haemimont's previous games, Imperium I, II and III, which sold more than 1 million copies in these countries.\nIn the game, the player assumes the roles of city planner, governor, and military leader. Successful players will need planning skills, economic savvy, and—should those fail—military might. The glory of the Roman Empire will challenge gamers to grow a small village into a thriving community through trade with neighbors, while also expanding and defending its borders through more militaristic means. Players will need to focus on the physical and emotional health of the citizenry; as villagers age and mature under strong leadership, they contribute to the development of more advanced societies and larger cities.\nA sequel entitled Imperium Romanum was released in 2008.\nScenarios\nGlory of the Roman Empire:\nMissions take place in Florentia (5 missions), Pompeii (1 mission), Syracusae (4 missions), Toletum (3 missions), Kartagena (3 missions), Massilia (2 missions), Mediolanum (2 missions), Lugdunum (2 missions), Londinium (3 missions), and Colonia Claudia (3 missions).\nThere are seven more scenarios that are sandboxes: Mountain Paradise, Desert, Highlander, Across the river, Mamertum, Halkedonia, and Rome.\nIt also has a challenge mode where the player has to achieve random goals for 4 different cities.\nImperium Civitas: (Spanish and Italian edition)\nThere are two campaigns instead of one as in Glory of the Roman Empire: a military and peaceful campaign.\nThere are 12 freebuild cities: Burdigala, Colonia Agrippina, Syena, Andautonia, Roma, Geneva, Venetia, Tamiatis, Labacum, Antium, Salamantica, and Emerita Augusta.\nIn the challenge mode the player can choose from Londinium, Lutetia, Colonia Agrippina, Burdigala, Lugdunum, Mediolanum, Andautonia, Tarraco, Carthago Nova, Tingis, Caralis, Carthago, Syracusae, Pompeii, and Roma.\nReception\n| 1UP = C+\n| EuroG = 6/10\n| GSpot = 5.6/10\n| GSpy =\n| GameZone = 7/10\n| IGN = 7.6/10\n| PALGN = 6/10\n| PCGUK = 70%\n| PCGUS = 50%\n| XPlay =\n| rev1 = The Sydney Morning Herald\n| rev1Score =\n}}\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nSee also\n* Haemimont Games\n* City-building game\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*  at Haemimont Games\n*  at FX Interactive\n*"
