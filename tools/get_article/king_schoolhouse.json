Located near the center of King, about  east of United States Route 71, it is a two-story brick building with a hip roof and a hip-roof dormer.  Its main entry is centered on the southern facade, slightly recessed under an arch, with sidelight and transom windows.  The Colonial Revival building was built in 1915, when King was a bustling lumber and railroad community, and served it as a school, church, and community center, and is the only known Colonial Revival school building in Sevier County.  It continues to be used as a community center.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sevier County, Arkansas\nReferences"
