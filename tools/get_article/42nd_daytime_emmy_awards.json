The ceremony took place on April 26, 2015, at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California,  5:00&nbsp;p.m. PST / 8:00&nbsp;p.m. EST. The ceremony, televised in the United States by Pop was executive produced by Michael Levitt, Gary Tellalian and Mike Rothman. Talk show host, actress and producer Tyra Banks hosted the show for the first time.\nThe drama pre-nominees were announced on February 4, 2015, and the standard nominations were announced on March 31, 2015, during an episode of The Talk.  In related events, the 42nd Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony was held at the Universal Hilton in Los Angeles on April 24, 2015, with Jeopardy! icon Alex Trebek and The Brady Bunch actress Florence Henderson serving as the ceremony's hosts.\nVariety reported that the return of the Daytime Emmys on Television was due that the Academy hoped to rebound in viewership after the previous year's internet-only ceremony, which also resulted in a high-volume of no-shows among the nominees. The awards ceremony was also moved up from its normal month in June to April to improve participation since many shows were still in production during that time. The Academy also choose to hold the ceremonies at the Warner Bros. Studios instead of a hotel ballroom like in previous years so participants \"would feel [more] comfortable\". They specifically picked Stage 16, where Casablanca and other famous films were produced. It was later announced that the Lifetime Achievement Award would be presented to Betty White.\nWinners and nominees\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series  winner]]\n, Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Game Show Host winner]]\nIn the lists below, the winner of the category is shown first, with a double-dagger (), followed by the other nominees.\n, Lifetime Achievement Award honoree.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"37%\" | Category\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"50%\" | Winners and nominees\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Outstanding Drama Series\n|\n*Days of Our Lives (NBC)\n*The Young and the Restless (CBS)\n**The Bold and the Beautiful (CBS)\n**General Hospital (ABC)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" |Outstanding Culinary Program\n|\n*Barefoot Contessa: Back to Basics (Food Network)\n**''Guy's Big Bite (Food Network)\n**Martha Bakes (PBS)\n**The Mind of a Chef (PBS)\n**My Grandmother’s Ravioli (Cooking Channel)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"width=50%\"|Outstanding Game Show\n|\n*Jeopardy!
