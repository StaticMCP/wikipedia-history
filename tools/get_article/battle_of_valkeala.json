The next day, they continued their march to Valkeala, where a Russian force of 3000 men stood ready to face them. The Swedish force available for battle consisted of roughly 3000 men, since 3 battalions had been diverted to guard the ford crossing and rear positions.\nThe Swedes were victorious in the following battle, pressing home the victory with several successful head-on bayonet charges. After Colonel Swedenhjelm's adversity through Anjala on May 5, the Army Corps of Keltis returned the Kymi river. Swedish units involved included the Västmanland Regiment, Östergötland Infantry Regiment, Life Grenadier Regiment, 1st Life Grenadier Regiment and Kronoberg Regiment.\nThe Swedes had 13 killed and 137 wounded of the lower rank soldiers (of which 9 killed and 68 wounded from the Kronoberg, 4 killed and 49 wounded from the Västmanland, 13 wounded from the Östgöta regiments and the rest attributed to the Jägers, dragoons and artillery) and 1 killed and 20 wounded of the higher rank, including both Gustav Wachtmeister who had been shot in his arm and the king himself who had suffered a light contusion in his arm. Left on the battlefield there were 50 Russians killed and 70 wounded with another 40 unharmed captives of the lower rank. Additionally two higher ranked officers had been killed with another two captured. The total casualties of the Russians are unknown, many may have been brought with them as they retreated, however, it is said that their Jeager battalion had 317 at the beginning of the battle, but only 60 remained as they retreated. The Swedes captured a large bulk of supplies left by the retreating Russians.\nAftermath\nWachtmeister was the hero of the hour for a king who wished for good publicity. Wachtmeister was made a Major-General for his heroic intervention.\nReferences"
