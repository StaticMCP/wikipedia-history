The party has taken various anti-imperialist and anti-militarist positions, including the end of conscription in South Korea, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, and the negotiation of a peace agreement with North Korea.\nHistory\nThe Founding Preparatory Committee of the Hwansu Welfare Party () was formed on 12 July 2016 and it held a press conference on 18 July. The inauguration ceremony of the Hwansu Welfare Party was subsequently held on 5 November 2016, and the party registered with the National Election Commission (NEC) on 21 November.\nThe Hwansu Welfare Party merged with organizations affiliated with the National Liberation and People's Democracy political camps on 15 August 2017. The party subsequently renamed itself to the '''People's Democracy Party-Hwansu Welfare Party''' (), later shortened to the \"People's Democracy Party\".\nIdeology and policies\nThe People's Democracy Party aims to establish a people's democracy in South Korea, in which workers, farmers, and small merchants (i.e. the proletariat and petite bourgeoisie) are the owners of the productive forces. The party program calls for free housing, education, and medical care, as well as an end to conscription in South Korea. The party has been described as far-left in South Korean media.\nForeign policy\nThe party is opposed to the U.S. military presence in Asia, advocating for the departure of the United States Forces Korea and the suspension of \"Foal Eagle\" exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. The party has stated that \"South  is a complete colony occupied by the U.S. military, is politically oppressed by the U.S., and is economically subordinate to imperialist countries, including the U.S.,\" and therefore \"True peace is possible only without imperialism; the head of imperialism is the U.S.\" The party has also expressed opposition to the current government of Japan, calling it \"militaristic\" and \"imperialist\". The party advocates engagement with North Korea and has called for an end to the Korean conflict through an immediate inter-Korean peace deal. The party also advocates the reunification of Korea under a federal system, and opposes \"reunification by absorption\" (as West Germany had done with East Germany) or reunification through war. The party supports a \"collective security system\" in East Asia, with ultimate goal of peace in all of Asia.\nThe party is a member of the World Anti-Imperialist Platform. The party supports the Russian invasion of Ukraine, echoing the Russian government's claims of it being a campaign of \"de-Nazification\". The party has accused the U.S. and NATO of supporting \"neo-Nazis\" and \"Banderites\" in Ukraine to threaten Russia.\nElection results\nLegislative elections\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Election\n! scope=\"col\" | Constituency votes\n! scope=\"col\" | Share of votes\n! scope=\"col\" | Seats won\n! scope=\"col\" | +/−\n! scope=\"col\" | Outcome\n|-\n! 2020\n| 63\n| 0.00%\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! 2024\n| 290\n| 0.00%\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
