It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a steeply pitched gable roof and Gothic Revival styling.  A front-facing gable is centered on the main facade, with a Gothic-arched window at its center.  The single-story porch extending across the front is supported by chamfered posts and has a jigsawn balustrade.  Built about 1875, it is one of the city's few surviving 19th-century Gothic houses, a style that is somewhat rare in the state.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Independence County, Arkansas\nReferences"
