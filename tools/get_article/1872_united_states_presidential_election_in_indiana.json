The Republican ticket of the incumbent president Ulysses S. Grant and the junior U.S. senator from Massachusetts Henry Wilson defeated the Liberal Republican and Democratic ticket of the editor of the New-York Tribune and former U.S. representative from New York's 6th congressional district Horace Greeley and the governor of Missouri Benjamin Gratz Brown. Grant defeated Greeley in the national election with 286 electoral votes.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nIndiana chose 15 electors on a statewide general ticket. Nineteenth-century election laws required voters to vote directly for members of the Electoral College rather than for president. This sometimes resulted in small differences in the number of votes cast for electors pledged to the same presidential candidate, if some voters did not vote for all the electors nominated by a party. This table reflects the statewide popular vote as calculated by Walter Dean Burnham in his influential study, Presidential Ballots, 1836–1892, including 1,417 votes for Charles O'Conor listed in the appendix which cannot be tabulated by county. Svend Petersen's later study includes these votes while reporting similar totals to Burnham for Grant and Greeley.\n}}\n1.61}}\n}}\n2.02}}\n}}\n0.40}}\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Indiana\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
