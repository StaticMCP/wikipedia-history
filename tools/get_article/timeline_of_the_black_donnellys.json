      "text": "# Timeline of the Black Donnellys\n\nThe \"Black\" Donnellys were an Irish immigrant family who settled in Biddulph township, Upper Canada in the 19th century. The family became involved in a series of personal and business disputes which frequently escalated to violence, culminating in the 1880 burning of the family home by an armed vigilante mob, resulting in the deaths of five family members.\nThe following is a timeline of key events in the lives of the family.\nTimeline\nEarly events\n* 1840: James Donnelly marries Johannah Magee in Ireland.\n* 1841: James and Johannah Donnelly's first son, James Jr, is born in Moneygall, Co Tipperary.\n* 1842: James and Johannah sail to Upper Canada. James may have arrived first, followed by Johannah.\n* 1844: William is born in Upper Canada.\n* 1845: The family builds a home on Lot 18, Concession 6 in Biddulph, a lot owned by John Grace.\n* 1847: John Donnelly is born in Upper Canada.\n* 1849: Patrick Donnelly is born in Upper Canada.\n* 1850: Michael Donnelly is born in Upper Canada.\n* 1853: Robert Donnelly is born in Upper Canada.\n* 1854: Thomas Donnelly is born in Upper Canada.\n* 1855: John Grace sells the southern 50 acres of Lot 18, Concession 6 to Michael Maher for £200. However, the Donnelly family was still living on the land.\n* 1855: Not long after the sale of the land that the Donnelly family lives on James Donnelly is charged with shooting at Patrick Farrell.\n* 1856: John Grace applies to eject the Donnelly family from the northern half of Lot 18, Concession 6. Michael Maher does the same for the southern half of the property. In the end, however, Grace sells James Donnelly the NORTHERN half of the property for £50, far less than the £200 paid by Maher due to Donnelly's improvements on the land, but a reflection of the work the Donnellys had put into developing the lot.\n* 1857: During a logging bee at a neighbour's farm James Donnelly Sr kills Patrick Farrell with a handspike. Donnelly goes into hiding and a $400 reward is offered for his capture.\n** (In the London Free Press account of that day it is reported that Patrick Farrell had attacked James Donnelly with his fists, James Donnelly defended himself with his fists and knocked Farrell down, then was walking away when Farrell picked up a logging handspike and attacked Donnelly from behind: Donnelly then defended himself with another handspike and Farrell was killed. This is why the hanging sentence was commuted on appeal, because the death was self defence. These things were well testified to at the original trial.)\n* 1858: Jennie Donnelly is born in Upper Canada.\n* 1858: James Donnelly Sr turns himself in and is convicted of the murder of Patrick Farrell and sentenced to death. His wife, Johannah, and others in the community petition for his sentence to be commuted.

The Donnellys escape and a group of townspeople go in search of them. Many come forward to pursue old charges against the Donnellys. Constable Bawden captures Michael Donnelly and holds him in a Lucan hotel, but Michael manages to escape.\n* 1876: Most of the charges against the Donnellys with regards to McKellar, Kennedy, and Esdale lead to no convictions.

He hears stories about the 'troublesome' Donnelly family and forms a prejudice before meeting them. William Donnelly writes to him complaining that he is unfair to the Donnelly family.\n* 1879: In June Father Connolly founds a \"Peace Society\" and asks people in the community to pledge their support, and to agree to have their homes searched for stolen property. The Donnellys do not sign the pledge.\n* 1879: In August a splinter group of the Peace Society begins meeting at the Cedar Swamp Schoolhouse in Biddulph. James Carroll is part of the group, as are many of the Donnellys' neighbours. This group becomes known as the Vigilance Society.\n* 1879: Not long after the creation of the Vigilance Society, a cow disappears from Mary and William Thompson's farm.

They speak to James Feeheley and ask him to spy on the Donnellys later that night.\n* February 3, 1880: The Donnelly family prepare to attend their trial over the burning of the Ryder barn, to be held in Granton the next day. Johnny O'Connor, a 15 year old boy from a family friendly to the Donnellys helps with chores on their farm.\n* February 3, 1880: John Donnelly leaves the family farm and goes to William Donnelly's home in Whalen's Corners to borrow a sleigh to take the family to court the next day.

They go to one of the farms owned by Patrick Ryder.\n* Shortly after midnight, February 4, 1880: John and William Donnelly and Martin Hogan go to bed at William's place. Nora Donnelly is already asleep. John and Hogan share one room, and William and Nora another.\n* Shortly after 1:00&nbsp;a.m., February 4, 1880: The Vigilance Society proceeds to the Donnelly homestead. Carroll allegedly enters the home first via the back kitchen door, and handcuffs Thomas Donnelly. Bridget and Johannah awake and start a fire. Carroll goes to the front room and wakes James Sr, and Johnny passes James Sr his coat. The mob quickly enters the home and attacks James Sr and Johannah Donnelly. Johnny O'Connor takes cover under the bed and watches the violent scene. Johnny then follows Bridget and runs upstairs, but she shuts the door so is unable to follow her. Johnny returns to his hiding place under the bed. Johnny later says he saw Thomas run outside, but Thomas was dragged back into the house. Johnny says that he saw some of the mob go upstairs to kill Bridget. The mob then spreads coal oil and sets fire to the cabin.\n* 1:30&nbsp;a.m., February 4, 1880: Johnny flees out the back door and goes to the home of Patrick Whalen. Johnny tells them about the murders and the fire and after some time they go back to the Donnelly cabin, which is in flames; Bridget's body falls through to the main level of the house. It snows for most of the night, and the snow covers the scene of the murders.\n* 2:00&nbsp;a.m., February 4, 1880: After killing Bridget, Thomas, Johannah and James Sr Donnelly, the Vigilance Society travels to William Donnelly's house at Whalen's Corners. The mob separates and surrounds the house. Members of the mob shout “Fire!” hoping to awaken William Donnelly. Instead, John Donnelly wakes and goes to the door. He is mistaken for William and is shot, allegedly by Martin McLaughlin and James Ryder. Hogan, Nora and William hide inside and see John die.\n* Early morning of February 4, 1880: Neighbours come to view the burned Donnelly home and the remains of the murdered victims; some scavenge for souvenirs.

They meet again on February 18 and March 2. They decide that the Donnellys were murdered by “persons unknown”.\n** Johnny O'Connor knew all the persons who did the killing and identified them easily, but his testimony was disregarded because of his age, which was somewhere between 11 and 15 years old.)\n* February 21, 1880: A preliminary hearing is held from February 21 to March 13. Six prisoners (James Carroll, John Kennedy, Martin McLaughlin, Thomas Ryder, James Ryder and John Purtell) are committed for trial at the Spring Assizes. Two others, Patrick Ryder Jr. and William Carroll are allowed out on bail.\n* April to May, 1880: Prosecutors, aware of the bias against the Donnellys, ask for a change of venue, but the judge refuses.

Newspapers take sides in the conflict and the case is held over until the Fall Assizes.\n* Summer of 1880: William Donnelly works tirelessly to gather evidence for the trial. There is trouble gathering a jury.\n* October 4–9, 1880: The trial begins October 4 under Justice Armour. First on trial is James Carroll who is charged with the murder of Johannah Donnelly. The testimony heard is much the same as that at the inquest and preliminary hearing. Justice Armour issues a strong charge to the jury, but they cannot reach a verdict. Four of the jury want to convict, seven to acquit and one is undecided.\n* November to December, 1880: Attorney General Mowat decides not to wait until spring for another trial to be held; he orders a special commission to oversee an earlier trial. He appoints two justices: Matthew Crooks Cameron and Featherstone Osler.\n* January 24, 1881 to February 2, 1881: The second trial takes place. The jury finds Carroll not guilty of murder. The rest of the prisoners are granted bail and are never tried for the Donnelly murders.\n* February, 1881: The surviving Donnellys befriend James and Michael Feeheley despite the actions of the Feeheleys on the night of the murders. James Feeheley confesses to Patrick Donnelly about the night of the Donnelly family murders, but he is afraid of the Vigilance Society.\n* April, 1881: James and Michael Feeheley flee to Michigan.\n* September, 1881: The Feeheleys, after being extradited to Canada, are charged with aiding and abetting the murder of Thomas Donnelly. The Crown agrees to set them free on bail, and the Vigilance Society pays the bail money. The Feeheleys refuse to testify against anyone so the chance of a third trial is diminished.\nLife after the massacre\n* 1882: William Donnelly goes to Ohio to work in the coal mines. Patrick Donnelly remains in the wagon-making business. Robert and Jennie Donnelly move to Glencoe where Robert owns a hauling business and Jennie is married to Constable James Currie.\n* 1883: William Donnelly returns to Canada and joins Jennie and Robert in Glencoe.

Others died of violence or particularly gruesome illnesses.)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/donnellys/prelude/indexen.html"
