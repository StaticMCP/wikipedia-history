After the first Battle of Tuyutí, won by the Allies on 24 May 1866, an Allied council of war decided to use their navy to bombard and capture the Paraguayan battery at Curupayty.\nBattle\nOn September 1, five Brazilian ironclads, Bahia, Barroso, Lima Barros, Rio de Janeiro and Brasil began bombarding the batteries at Curuzú, which continued the next day. That is when the Rio de Janeiro hit two mines and sank immediately along with her commander Américo Brasílio Silvado, and 50 sailors.\nSimultaneously, 8,391 men of the Brazilian 2nd Corps, under the command of Manuel Marques de Sousa, then Viscount of Porto Alegre, attacked the Paraguayan batteries at Curuzú, south of the main stronghold of Humaitá on the shores of Paraguay River.\nOn September 3, the fort, commanded by colonel Giménez, was stormed. The defenders relied on the advantage of the wetlands and bushes around the fort. The fort was conquered after a heavy bombardment, and the Paraguayan army was pursued until the vicinity of Curupayty.\nThe Brazilian ironclad Rio de Janeiro had a hole blown in her bottom by a contact mine, and sank almost immediately – the greater part of her crew, together with her captain, being drowned. This was the only ironclad sunk during the war.\nAftermath\nPresident Francisco Solano López decimated the 10th Infantry Battalion on 10 September 1866, killing 63 men.\nGallery\nFile:Planta da parte do rio Paraguai em que se deu combate da canhoneira Ivaí com a Fortaleza de Curuzu.jpg|Map of the part of the Paraguay River where took place the fight of the gunboat Ivaí with the Fortress of Curuzú\nFile:Cándido Lopez - Vista interior de Curuzú mirado de aguas arriba - Google Art Project.jpg|Interior view of Curuzú.\nFile:Battle of Curuzu by Vitor Meireles.jpg|The Viscount of Porto Alegre leads the Brazilian forces in the Battle of Curuzú, 1866, by Victor Meirelles.\nFile:GUERRE DU PARAGUAY. - Prise de la batterie de Curuzù (3 septembre) par le 2º corps d'armée brésilien, sous les ordres du lientenant-général vicomte de Porto-Alegre.
