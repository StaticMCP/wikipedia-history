The title was transformed from the previous title of tsar and grand prince of all Russia. The old title tsar (or tsaritsa) continued to be popularly used to refer to the emperor (or empress) until the monarchy was abolished in 1917.\nTitle\nArticle 1 of the Fundamental Laws of the Russian Empire stated that \"the Emperor of All Russia is an autocratic and unrestricted monarch. To obey his supreme authority, not only out of fear but out of conscience as well, God himself commands\".\nThe full title of the emperor in the 20th century (Art. 37 of the Fundamental Laws) was:\nTsarist autocracy\nHistory\n]]\nPeter I recognized the need to secure the position of Russia within the European states system, including the importance of securing recognition from the Holy Roman Emperor of the equality of the titles of tsar and emperor. Following his victory at the Battle of Poltava, Peter I brought up the question of the title of emperor to the Viennese court. In 1717, Peter I defended his right to use the title of imperator, using the letter from Maximilian I to Vasily III to support his claim.\nThe title of Emperor of all Russia was introduced for Peter the Great. After his victory in the Great Northern War and the signing the Treaty of Nystad in September 1721, the Senate and Synod decided to award Peter with the title of Emperor of all Russia with the following statement: \"in the manner of the Roman Senate for the noble cause of emperors such titles publicly given them as a gift and into statues for the everlasting generations inscribed\".\nOn November 2, 1721, Peter I accepted the title. The Dutch Republic and Kingdom of Prussia immediately recognized the new title of the Russian monarch, followed by the Kingdom of Sweden in 1723, the Ottoman Empire in 1739, the United Kingdom and Austria in 1742, the Holy Roman Empire, the Kingdom of France and Spain in 1745, and finally the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1764. From then on, the Russian state was referred to as the Russian Empire.\nOn February 16, 1722, Peter I issued the Decree of Succession by which he abolished the old custom of passing the throne to the direct descendants in the male line, but allowed the appointment of an heir through any decent person, at the will of the monarch.\nCoronation ceremony\nCoronations in the Russian Empire involved a highly developed religious ceremony in which the emperor was crowned and invested with regalia, then anointed with chrism and formally blessed by the church to commence his reign.  Although the grand princes of Moscow had been crowned prior to the reign of Ivan III (), their coronation rituals assumed overt Byzantine overtones as the result of the influence of Ivan's wife Sophia Paleologue, and the imperial ambitions of his grandson, Ivan IV.\nThe modern coronation style, introducing \"European-style\" elements, replaced the previous \"crowning\" ceremony and was first used for Catherine I in 1724. Since tsarist Russia claimed to be the \"Third Rome\" and the successor to Byzantium, the Russian rite was designed to link its rulers and prerogatives to those of the so-called \"Second Rome\" (Constantinople).\nWhile months or even years could pass between the initial accession of the sovereign and the performance of this ritual, church policy held that the monarch must be anointed and crowned according to the Orthodox rite to have a successful tenure.  As the church and state were essentially one in Imperial Russia, this service invested the tsars with political legitimacy; however, this was not its only intent. It was equally perceived as conferring a genuine spiritual benefit that mystically wedded sovereign to subjects, bestowing divine authority upon the new ruler. As such, it was similar in purpose to other European coronation ceremonies from the medieval period.\nEven when the imperial capital was located at St.&nbsp;Petersburg (1713–1728, 1732–1917), Russian coronations were always held in Moscow at the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Kremlin. The last coronation service in Russia was held on 26 May 1896 for Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, who would be the final emperor and empresses of Russia. The Russian Imperial regalia survived the subsequent Russian Revolution and the Soviet period, and are currently on exhibit at the Diamond Fund in the Kremlin Armoury.\nList of emperors\n2 June 16822 November 1721\n|reignend1   = 8 February 1725\n|notes1      =\n|family1     = Romanov\n|image1      = Peter I by Kneller.jpg\n|alt1        =\n|name2       = Catherine I\n|nickname2   = Екатери́на I Алексе́евна\n|native2     =\n|life2       = 15 April 1684—17 May 1727\n|reignstart2 = 8 February 1725\n|reignend2   = 17 May 1727\n|notes2      = Wife of Peter I\n|family2     =  (by birth)Romanov (by marriage)\n|image2      = Catherine I of Russia.jpg\n|alt2        =\n|name3       = Peter II\n|nickname3   = Пётр II Алексеевич\n|native3     =\n|life3       = 23 October 1715—30 January 1730\n|reignstart3 = 18 May 1727\n|reignend3   = 30 January 1730\n|notes3      = Grandson of Peter I via the murdered Tsesarevich Alexei.
