King is a graduate of Neshaminy High School and Millersville University.\nIn 2002, King entered the race for state representative only three months before the general election, as a late replacement for the Democratic candidate who withdrew. Against incumbent Matt Wright, King took 41% of the vote in the loss.\nIn 2006, King made a second run at the state house.  In the primary election, he defeated Democrat Larry Lefkowitz with more than two-thirds of the total vote. This time, with many incumbents hobbled by the fallout of the 2005 legislative pay raise, King defeated Wright, taking 52.5% of the vote.\nIn 2008, he was defeated for re-election by Republican Frank Farry.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110522035053/http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=46912 Biography], [https://archive.today/20240524070907/https://www.webcitation.org/5cPU1kjjZ?url=http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php%3Fcan_id=46912 voting record], and [https://archive.today/20240524070947/https://www.webcitation.org/5cPU2FhtB?url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php%3Fcan_id=46912 interest group ratings] at Project Vote Smart\n*Follow the Money - Chris King\n**[http://www.followthemoney.org/database/StateGlance/candidate.phtml?c=88342 2006] [http://www.followthemoney.org/database/StateGlance/candidate.phtml?c=60022 2002] campaign contributions"
