The film revealed, using digital investigation methods, permission was given by former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina to use lethal weapons on protesters.\nBackground\nA large number of protesters were killed during the 2024 anti-government protest in Bangladesh. The previous Awami League led-government dismissed that police forces were behind such deaths. The Awami league-led government fell on August 5, 2024. Few audio call recordings were leaked online by anonymous sources. These calls included a conversation of Sheikha Hasina with security officials permitting use of lethal weapons.\nContent\nBBC Eye Investigations obtained leaked recordings and shared them with Earshot to verify. Earshot ascertained the audio recordings were authentic. The film also mapped police brutality around Dhaka, especially at Jatrabari Police Station on August 5. It presented visual evidence, previously not reported, by portraying police officials firing on crowds that resulted in deaths.\nReaction\nIn a right of reply letter in the documentary an Awami League spokesman dismissed claims that Sheikh Hasina ordered shootings and said they were not able to confirm if audio recordings were real.\nHowever, following broadcasting of the documentary Awami League denied any spokesperson's comment appeared on the documentary.\nAmnesty International appraised the documentary and urged the government to hold perpetrators accountable.
