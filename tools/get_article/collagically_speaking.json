Marcus J. Moore of Pitchfork wrote: \"while the album's open-endedness largely works to its benefit, Collagically Speaking occasionally meanders\". In a mixed review, Hank Shteamer of Rolling Stone wrote: \"singing, rapping and spoken-word float through these tracks, as do soulful improvs from Adjuah, Glasper and others, but what lingers is the overall aura: a no-seams-showing blend of jazz, R&B and hip-hop, with a spontaneous \"3 a.m. in the studio\" feel\".\nTrack listing\n| length1 = 7:32\n| title2 = Awake to You\n| writer2 =\n| length2 = 8:14\n| title3 = By Design\n| note3 = featuring Jahi Sundance, India Shawn and Mirna Jose\n| writer3 =\n| length3 = 5:27\n| title4 = Resting Warrior\n| writer4 =\n| length4 = 9:51\n| title5 = Needed You Still\n| note5 = featuring Omari Hardwick\n| writer5 =\n| length5 = 6:09\n| title6 = Colors in the Dark\n| writer6 =\n| length6 = 4:48\n| title7 = The Night in Question\n| note7 = featuring Terry Crews\n| writer7 =\n| length7 = 7:41\n| title8 = Reflect Reprise\n| note8 = featuring Stalley\n| writer8 =\n| length8 = 6:42\n| title9 = Her=Now\n| note9 = featuring Amanda Seales\n| writer9 =\n| length9 = 6:44\n| title10 = Respond\n| writer10 =\n| length10 = 5:21\n| title11 = Been on My Mind\n| note11 = featuring Amber Navran and Yasiin Bey\n| writer11 =\n| length11 = 4:49\n| total_length = 73:18\n}}\nPersonnel\n* Derrick Hodge – bass, songwriter, producer\n* Justin Tyson – drums and songwriter (tracks 1–8, 10), producer\n* Robert Glasper – keyboards (tracks 1–8), piano (track 11), songwriter (tracks 1–8, 11), vocals (track 3), producer\n* Taylor McFerrin – synthesizer (tracks 1–5, 7–11), songwriter (tracks 1–3, 5, 7–11), producer\n* Terrace Martin – synthesizer and songwriter (tracks 1–6, 8), vocoder (tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 8), saxophone (track 4), additional tracking, producer\n* Christian Scott – trumpet and songwriter (tracks 1–5, 7, 10, 11), producer\n* Rose McKinney – songwriter (tracks 1–6, 8)\n* Goapele Mohlabane – vocals (track 1)\n* India Shawn – vocals (track 3)\n* Jahi Sundance – vocals (track 3), turntables & songwriter (tracks 3, 11)\n* Mirna Jose – vocals (track 3)\n* Omari Hardwick – vocals and songwriter (track 5)\n* Michael \"Phoelix\" Neil – songwriter (track 5)\n* Arin Ray – songwriter (track 6)\n* Terry Crews – vocals and songwriter (track 7)\n* Kyle \"Stalley\" Myricks – vocals and songwriter (track 8)\n* Amanda Seales – vocals and songwriter (track 9)\n* Amber Navran – vocals and songwriter (track 11)\n* Dante \"Mos Def/Yasiin Bey\" Smith – vocals and songwriter (track 11)\n* Keith \"Qmillion\" Lewis – recording, mixing\n* Bryan DiMaio – engineering\n* Robert \"G Koop\" Mandell – engineering\n* Collin Kadlec – recording assistant\n* Derrick Stockwell – recording assistant\n* Chris Athens – mastering\n* Nicole Hegeman – executive producer\n* Vincent Bennett – executive producer\n* Stephanie Darden – design\n* Delphine Diaw Diallo – photography\n* Chris Baldwin – photography\n* Elizabeth Craig – photography\n* Mathieu Bitton – photography\n* Simon Benjamin – photography\n* Justin \"J3\" Jackson – photography\n* Freda Knowles – artist coordinator\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Collagically Speaking\n! scope=\"col\" |Chart (2018)\n! scope=\"col\" |Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
