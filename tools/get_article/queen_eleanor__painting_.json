The painting is displayed at the National Museum Cardiff, which obtained it in 1981.\nLegend\nThe traditional story recounts that King Henry concealed his affair from Queen Eleanor by conducting it within the innermost recesses of a complicated maze. Queen Eleanor penetrated the labyrinth while trailing a red cord, shown in the subject's left hand, and forced her rival to choose between a dagger and the bowl of poison. Rosamund chose the poison, and died.\nReferences"
