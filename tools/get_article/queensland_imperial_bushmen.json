The forces of the South African Republic and Orange Free State skirmished with the British Natal Contingent, prompting an escalation of hostilities. In a show of support for the empire, the governments of the self-governing British colonies of Canada, New Zealand, Natal, Cape Colony and the six Australian colonies all offered men to participate in the conflict. The Australian contingents, numbering around 16,000 men in total, were the largest contribution from the Empire, and were supplemented by a further 7,000 Australian men who served in other colonial or irregular units.\nBoer War\nThe British Australian government was called upon to raise battalions to send to South Africa. As with the other five Australian domains, Queensland raised a contingent of mounted soldiers for the Second Boer War. The 4th and 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen departed Brisbane on 18 May 1900 and were deployed to Cape Town on 31 June 1900. Both contingents served with distinction during the conflict, and developed a tough reputation among the Boers.}}\nFollowing the conclusion of the conflict, the Queensland Imperial Bushmen sailed for home on 7 July 1901 and were disbanded on 5 May 1902.\nReferences"
