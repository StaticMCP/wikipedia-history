Mikhaylovka II is divided into a lower (3400-3300 BCE) and an upper level (3300-3000 BCE). Mikhaylivka II shows a shift from farming to cattle herding, typical for the Yamna horizon.\nThe Mikhaylivka archaeological site was extensively studied by three expeditions of the Institute of Archaeology, National Academy of Science of Ukraine, led by E.F. Lagodovskaya and O.G. Shaposhnikova, between 1952 and 1963.\nThe lower horizon of the middle layer of the Mikhaylivka archaeological site is dated to 3646-3348 calBCE, while the upper horizon is dated to 3371-3026 calBCE. A tooth specimen from the lower horizon of the middle layer dated to 3635-3383 calBCE has been genetically identified as the earliest specimen of the Core Yamna ancestry in the North Pontic.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
