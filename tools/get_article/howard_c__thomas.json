Thomas is a British hepatologist and academic. He is Emeritus Professor of Hepatology at Imperial College London, known for his research on viral hepatitis, liver immunology, and antiviral therapies. Thomas chaired national advisory groups on hepatitis for the UK Department of Health, led clinical trials of interferon therapy, and was founding editor of the Journal of Viral Hepatitis. He has received multiple international awards and delivered named lectures including the Humphry Davy Rolleston, Hans Popper, and Sheila Sherlock lectures. He was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1999.\nEarly life and education\nThomas studied at Newcastle University, where he received a BSc in Physiology and MB BS in Medicine with honours, and was awarded the Phillipson Prize. He gained a PhD in Medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1974 with a thesis on liver immunology. Following his PhD, he became a Lecturer and Wellcome Senior Clinical Research Fellow at the Royal Free Hospital.\nAcademic and clinical roles\nFrom 1974 to 1987, Thomas held a Wellcome Senior Clinical Research Fellowship and then became Professor of Medicine under Dame Sheila Sherlock at the Royal Free Hospital Medical School.
