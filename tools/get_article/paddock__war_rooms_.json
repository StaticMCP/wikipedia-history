It comprises some thirty-seven rooms on three floors. The facility included offices for the prime minister and Cabinet, but no living accommodation. Neville's Court, a nearby civilian block of apartments without strengthening, was to be used for this purpose.\nIt was taken out of use in 1944.  It is semi-derelict, with original equipment abandoned and rusted, and a certain amount of water ingress which is kept at bay by an electric extraction pump.\nPaddock was used after World War II by the General Post Office (GPO) for research and development and by the Post Office Research Laboratories Sports and Social Club.  Paddock lay unused from when the Post Office moved to Martlesham Heath (Suffolk) and vacated the site in 1976, until Network Homes purchased the site (including Paddock) in 1997.\nThe bunker is now owned by Network Homes, an affordable housing association which is responsible for the properties now occupying part of the former research station site above.  It used to be open to the public two or three times a year, with free guided tours provided by volunteers from the Subterranea Britannica organisation.  It featured on the Channel 5 programme \"Underground Britain\".\nSee also\n*Military citadels under London\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.Bunkers.org.uk/paddock.htm The Paddock Information Collection (over 2,200 pages of information) The most comprehensive source of information about Paddock]\n*[https://www.NetworkHomes.org.uk/paddock/ Churchill's bunker] - twice-yearly bunker open days, and a 'virtual tour', Network Homes\n*[https://www.Google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Brook+Road+Neasden&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=20.403926,67.631836&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Brook+Rd,+London+NW2,+United+Kingdom&ll=51.562427,-0.237534&spn=0.00059,0.004128&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=51.562427,-0.237535&panoid=PsrBKo10Wh2P4NW8m8GjgA&cbp=11,234.01,,0,8.96 Location on Google StreetView]"
