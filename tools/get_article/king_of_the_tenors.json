The album was re-issued in 1957 on Verve Records as King of the Tenors (MGV 8020), and has been released with that title ever since. Webster is accompanied by the Oscar Peterson Trio, and, on several tracks, by Benny Carter and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison.\nReception\n| rev2 = The Penguin Guide to Jazz\n| rev2Score =\n| rev4 = The Virgin Encyclopedia of Jazz\n| rev4Score =\n}}\nAllMusic awarded the album 4 stars, with reviewer Ron Wynn describing King of the Tenors as \"a series of elegant yet soulful and exuberant small group dates... Although this date is more than four decades old, Ben Webster's solos have a freshness and vitality that make them quite relevant to contemporary events.\"\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz gave King of the Tenors 4 stars out of 4, saying \"'Tenderly' has never been more tender, 'That's All' is sheer heaven, but 'Jive at Six' is a good piece of studio knockabout.\"\nIn Someone to Watch Over Me: The Life and Music of Ben Webster, Frank Buchmann-Moller writes of the album: \"These recordings show a broad spectrum of Ben's craft and can be heard as a summary of his artistic level at the time.... On the blues tunes 'Jive at Six' and 'Bounce Blues'... he plays with gusto and drive, and 'Cotton Tail' is exceptional, built up over six choruses, inspired and full of direction all the way....[I]t is the ballads that stand out, beginning with a one-and-a-half-chorus version of 'Tenderly,' in a rendition perfectly reflecting the title. Ellington's 'Don't Get Around Much Anymore' is played at a medium slow pace... with Ben at his most lyrical, presenting the theme almost seductively.\"\nTrack listing\nSide A\nSide B\n1993 CD reissue bonus tracks\nPersonnel\n*Ben Webster – tenor saxophone\n*Benny Carter – alto saxophone (tracks 2–4, 6 & 11)\n*Harry \"Sweets\" Edison – trumpet (tracks 2–4, 6 & 11)\n*Oscar Peterson – piano\n*Herb Ellis (tracks 1–4, 6 & 11), Barney Kessel (tracks 5, 7–10) – guitar\n*Ray Brown – double bass\n*Alvin Stoller (tracks 1–4, 6 & 11), J.
