The 2001 film Enemy at the Gates utilized the book's title and used it as one of its sources, but was not a direct adaptation of the work.\nReception\nThe Slavic Review panned Enemy at the Gates, calling it \"rambling and exaggerated\" and negatively comparing Craig to former Nazi propagandist and author  Paul Carell. In contrast, The Washington Post was more favorable and drew favorable comparisons to Cornelius Ryan.\nReferences"
