He served as the first auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Detroit in Michigan from 1911 to 1919, and then as the third bishop of the Diocese of Grand Rapids in Michigan from 1919 until his death in 1926.\nBiography\nEarly life\nEdward Kelly was born on December 30, 1860, in Hartford, Michigan, to Thomas and Mary (née Hannon) Kelly. He attended Assumption College in Windsor, Ontario, Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio, and St. Charles College in Catonsville, Maryland. Kelly finished his formation for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary in Troy, New York.\nPriesthood\nKelly was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Detroit in Windsor on June 16, 1886, by Bishop Caspar Borgess. After his ordination, Kelly was appointed as assistant pastor at St. Philip's Parish in Battle Creek, Michigan. In late 1887, he also joined the faculty of St. Francis Seminary in Monroe, Michigan; he was named as vice rector two years later. Also in 1889, he was moved to pastoral positions first at St. John's Parish in Monroe and then to St. Joseph's Parish in Dexter, Michigan.\nKelly was named as an examiner for the diocese in 1891, a post he would hold until 1919. He was also named pastor of St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Parish in Ann Arbor, Michigan. While there, he constructed a larger church between 1896 and 1899, using the architectural firm Spier & Rohns.\nAuxiliary Bishop of Detroit\nOn December 9, 1910, Pope Pius X appointed Kelly as the first auxiliary bishop of Detroit and as titular bishop of Cestrus. He received his episcopal consecration at St. Thomas the Apostle Church on January 26, 1910, from Cardinal James Gibbons, with Bishops Henry Richter and Camillus Maes serving as co-consecrators.\nKelly was a major contributor to the founding of Theta Phi Alpha, a national women's sorority at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

In 1918, he was appointed superintendent of the diocesan schools.
