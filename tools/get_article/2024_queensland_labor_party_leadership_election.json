Dick, along with senior Labor MP Shannon Fentiman, had announced following the state election that they would not contest the leadership if Miles did.\nBackground\nProcedure\nLabor's rules authorise the formal method in which the leader is appointed. Section K of the party's rules state that: \"A ballot for Leader of the State Parliamentary Labor Party (SPLP) will be called if any of the following conditions are met: a. a state general election loss\n* b. a casual vacancy where the leader resigns or becomes permanently unavailable\n* c. not less than 50% of members of caucus petition the State Secretary for a ballot.\"}}\nAfter this, the party's Administrative Committee will call for nominations for SPLP leader and approve a timetable for elections on the advice of the General Returning Officer.\nIf more than one candidate is nominated, an election will be held through three separate equal-weight ballots of the SPLP (state MPs, also known as the Caucus), rank-and-file party members and affiliated unions.\nThe rules were reformed in November 2013 to give rank-and-file members and unions a direct vote in the leadership election, following similar reforms introduced by then-prime minister Kevin Rudd for the federal Labor Party in July 2013.\nCandidates\nLeader\nDeclared\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=125px; colspan=3| Candidate\n! width=115px| Electorate\n! width=135px| Faction\n! width=195px| Union affiliation\n! width=650px| Portfolio(s)\n|-\n| width=\"3pt\"  |&nbsp;\n|\n| Steven Miles\n| Murrumba\n| Labor Left\n| United Workers Union\n| align=left |\n|}\nSpeculated\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! width=125px; colspan=3| Candidate\n! width=115px| Electorate\n! width=135px| Faction\n! width=195px| Union affiliation\n! width=650px| Portfolio(s)\n|-\n| width=\"3pt\"  |&nbsp;\n|\n| Shannon Fentiman\n| Waterford\n| Labor Left\n| Australian Manufacturing Workers Union\n| align=left |\n|-\n| width=\"3pt\"  |&nbsp;\n|\n| Cameron Dick\n| Woodridge\n| Labor Right\n| Australian Workers' Union\n| align=left |\n|}\nReferences"
