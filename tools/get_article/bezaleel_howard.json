Bezaleel worked on the family farm until age 21.\nHe enrolled at Harvard in 1777, after about nine months of preparation. He graduated in 1781. Following this, he began studying theology under a Dr. Gay while teaching at a school in Hingham. From 1783 until 1785, he was a tutor at Harvard.\nIn 1784, he was invited to preach at First Church in Springfield, Massachusetts for six weeks. He was well-received, and in November 1784 they asked him to become their new pastor. He was ordained at the Springfield church on April 27, 1785.\nIn the late 1780s, Howard criticized both the insurgents of Shay's Rebellion and local authorities, whom he saw as abusing their power.\nHe resigned from First Church in September 1803, due to ill health. He was succeeded by Samuel Osgood.\nIn February 1808, Howard bought a home on Elm Street, where he lived until his death.\nIn 1809, Howard led a group of 18 other Springfield residents in raising money to purchase the freedom of a woman named Jenny, who had escaped from slavery in New York. Howard had officiated the wedding of Jenny and a freeman named Jack Williams several years prior, in 1802.\nIn 1819, Howard joined a splinter group of Unitarian congregation members in forming the new Third Congregational Society of Springfield, and remained with that church until his death.\nHe died in 1837 at the age of 83.\nFamily\nIn December 1785, he married Lucinda Dwight (b. 1767), the daughter of a prominent congregation member. She died in March 1788, leaving Howard with a daughter. Two years after her death, he married Prudence Williams (d. 1853), from Wethersfield, Connecticut. The couple went on to have four children (three sons and one daughter), including John and Charles (b. 1794).\nIn 1802, Howard became the guardian of Mary Lyman following the death of her parents.\nOrganizations and honors\nIn 1793, Howard co-directed a \"select school for young ladies\". He was also president of the Hampton Bible Society.\nIn 1818, Howard was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nIn 1824, he received the Doctor of Divinity degree from Harvard.\nLegacy\nHoward Street in Springfield is named after Howard and his family.\nReferences"
