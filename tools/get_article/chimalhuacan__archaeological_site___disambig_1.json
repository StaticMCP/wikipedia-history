It lies just outside the northeast border of the Federal District (Distrito Federal). The name derives from the Nahuatl words “chimalli” (shield), hua (possession particle) and can (place), this would mean \"Place of Shields\".The ancient name of the city by its founders was “Chimalhuacantoyac”.The word Atenco, is also Nahuatl; A, “water”; tentli, “lip” and co, “place”, hence would mean “at the water side”.\nThe Chimalhuacán glyph appears on the Quinatzin codex, symbolizing a round shield on a hill, has an alternative interpretation, the name Chimalltepetl = \"Hill shields\" or \"shields site\"; most probably referring to the \"Chimalhuache\" hill, mountain located within the municipality and near the site.\nIt is considered one of the cradles of Mesoamerican civilization due to the finding in 1984, of the \"Chimalhuacán Man\", whose remains are some 12,000 old.\nHistory\nThe Chimalhuacán Altepetl was founded 1259 by three Tlatoanis (brothers) named Huauxomatl, Chalchiutlatonac and Tlatzcantecuhtli. These tlatoanis and their people originated from Tula and Colhuacan. They spoke Chichimec y Mexica languages; since their ancestors were Acolhua and Mexica, but with time their customs merged and Nahuatl became the dominant language. Chimalhuacán was one of the Texcoco Altépetl, thus belonged to the Aztec Triple Alliance (México, Texcoco y Tlacopan), as of 1431. These villages dominated the territory part of current Mexico.\nThe site, also known as \"Los Pochotes\", one of the few late Postclassical period (1200-1521 CE.) known examples of palace architecture in the Basin of Mexico. Although the place was inhabited from the preclassical or Formative, the building, a place or tecpan (Sp), that now can be seen corresponds to the village founded by Chichimec's towards 1250 AD. Chimalhuacán would become an important Texcoco tributary.\nOccupation Stages\nChimalhuacán had three main occupation epochs identified:\nLate Preclassical period\nProbably founded and originally occupied between 400 and 100 BCE.\nClassical period\nThere is occupation evidence during the classical period, between 200 and 450 CE.\nPostclassical period\nThere are two occupation stages reported, during the early (800 to 1000 CE) and late (1100 to 1521 CE) Postclassical\nRelevant historical events\nChimalhuacán registered events:\nNezahualcóyotl Crowning\nBefore the Netzahualcoyotl crowning as Texcoco Tlatoani, triple alliance troops from Mexico, went to Texcoco and accompanied Netzahualcoyotl, the Tenochtitlan Tlatoani traveled, via de Santa Martha plains, and upon arriving at Chimalhuacán decreed an amnesty for all villages, that belonging to Texcoco, fought against them siding with the Tepaneca, as was the case of Huexotla; the fourth Mexica Tlatoani Itzcoatl (1427–1440) offered pardon in exchange for their surrender, as otherwise allied troops would enter and take their city, Huexotla did not accept the offer and decided to fight, the battle was brief as, Itzcóatl successor, Moctezuma I (1440–1469) took their king prisoner and the troops surrendered shortly thereafter. Finally Netzahualcoyotl was proclaimed Texcoco Tlatoani.\nMoctezuma I - First Visit\nMoctezuma I or Moctezuma Ilhuicamina was twice at this town, perhaps due to the closeness of the Texcoco Lake to Tenochtitlan. At a point in time he was taken prisoner by the Chalcas, whom offered his life to Huejotzingo, they rejected the offer. Then he was taken before Maxtla (Tlatoani Tepaneca and last independent governor of the Azcapotzalco Altépetl (1426–1428), with the same purpose, but Maxtla was not interested. Cuateotl freed him and advised him to go back to México via Chimalhuacán.\nMoctezuma I – Second Visit\nThe second time Moctezuma was when he accompanied Netzahualcoyotl, after their triumph against the Tepaneca.\nStructures\nThe archaeological area approximate covers one hectare. Architectural remains in the area correspond to a residential area of Azteca phase III and it has been determined that it is a governor palace. Spaniards destroyed the Chimalhuacán buildings and city and built their chapels.\nStructure remains\n*Three platform Pyramid.\n* Ballgame court.\n* Stone Serpent\nPleistocene Traces\nAccording to archaeological vestiges, Chimalhuacán formed part of the lacustrine plain of Texcoco Lake, Mammoths and Bison lived you the shores of the lake.\nAccording to the Institute Mexiquense investigator, Maximinio Quintero, Pleistocene (period ending approximately 12,000 years before present) mammoth and other animals remains have been found at Chimalhuacán, man-made lithic utensils, a pre-ceramic skeleton, the best complete and preserved of 38 recovered up to 1984; According to the researcher, it could be the oldest in Mexico.\nSite Museum\nChimalhuacán archaeological zone has a site museum, with pleistocene fauna exhibits, and other items.\nNotes\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015136/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15031a.htm Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico Estado de Mexico Chimalhuacán\".] Chimalhuacán denomination.
