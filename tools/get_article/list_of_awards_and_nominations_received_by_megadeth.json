The group was formed in 1983 by guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson, following Mustaine's expulsion from Metallica. The band has since released fourteen studio albums, four live albums, two extended plays, five compilation albums, one box set, and numerous singles and music videos.\nMegadeth rose to international fame in the late 1980s. Megadeth, alongside Anthrax, Metallica, and Slayer, is ranked as one of the \"Big Four\" of thrash metal, whose commercial success led to popularization of the genre. As an early pioneer of thrash metal, Megadeth is regarded as one of the progenitors for the burgeoning extreme metal movement of the late 1980s and early 1990s. With 50 million records sold worldwide, Megadeth is considered to be one of the most successful American heavy metal bands.\nOver the course of its career, Megadeth has earned twelve Grammy nominations, winning one for Best Metal Performance for the song \"Dystopia\" in 2017. In 1993, the title track of the fifth studio album, Countdown to Extinction, was awarded with the Humane Society of the United States's Genesis Award for dealing with issues of animal welfare.\nBURRN!\nBURRN! is the major publication on heavy metal music in Japan, it holds a annual years end readers poll.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Nominee / work\n!Award\n!Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |2007\n|Megadeath\n|Best live performance in Japan\n|\n|-\n|United Abominations\n|Best Album Cover\n|\n|-\n|That One Night: Live In Buenos Aires\n|Best DVD\n|\n|-\n|“Washington Is Next!”\n|Best Tune\n|\n|-\n|Dave Mustaine\n|Shining Star\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2009\n|Megadeth\n|Best Group\n|\n|-\n|Endgame\n|Best Album\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Dave Mustaine\n|Shining Star\n|\n|-\n|Best Song Writer\n|\n|}\nClassic Rock Roll of Honour Awards\nThe Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards are awarded annually by Classic Rock magazine.\n|-\n| 2014 || Dave Mustaine || Metal Guru ||\n|-\nClio Awards\nThe Clio Awards is an annual award program in which an international group of advertising professionals honor creativity in advertising, design, and communication.
