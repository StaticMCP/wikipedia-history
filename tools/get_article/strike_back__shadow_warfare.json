Damian Scott (Stapleton) and Michael Stonebridge (Winchester) are recalled from holiday to find Baxter's executioner, Leo Kamali (Zubin Varla), a member of a terrorist organisation led by al-Zuhari, in the jungles of Colombia. The two team up with an American Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) team, led by Kim Martinez (Jackson). Kamali is being sheltered by cartel leader Miguel Gomez (Raoul Trujillo), in his compound. Scott spots Mossad agent Rebecca Levi (Lyne Renée), last seen in Vengeance, posing as Kamali's girlfriend. After capturing Kamali the team kills Viktor Ulyanov, a representative of the Russian mafia, during the escape. They return to their rendezvous to find Martinez's team dead, and are soon ambushed by Gomez's men. Stonebridge manages to hijack an armed riverboat as a getaway vehicle.

After Martinez and Julia Richmond (Lukes) locate Kamali's safehouse from the contents, Scott and Stonebridge apprehends Kamali, who claims to be a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative under deep cover to infiltrate al-Zuhari. Scott and Stonebridge are captured and tortured by Gomez after Section 20 learn the CIA did not employ Kamali. Kamali however, rescues the two, and Scott kills Gomez. In Beirut, Dalton finds and questions Grey, who reveals the name James Leatherby before he is killed by a gunman of al-Zuhari. Dalton is then rescued by Colonel Philip Locke (Green), an SAS legend who is overseeing Section 20.

In Moscow, Arkady Ulyanov (Marcel Iureș), Viktor's father, learns of the identities of his son's killers and sends a woman to Beirut to seduce Scott. Kamali meets and pays Leatherby in a casino, but fails to get the location of al-Zuhari's arrival. Section 20 then kidnap Leatherby's boyfriend, who reveals the time and location to an airfield. Stonebridge is unknowingly contaminated while ambushing the landing party. Instead of al-Zuhari, they find a woman named Sophia Abboud (Agni Scott), the daughter of a former Syrian minister of finance.

Kamali arrives, posing as a friend of al-Zuhari, and allows her to escape. He and Dalton tail her to an address, but instead of finding al-Zuhari, they find a woman Locke later recognises as Mairead McKenna (Catherine Walker) of the Real Irish Republican Army, who kills Dalton and Sophia and recovers a memory card hidden in Sophia's watch.

McKenna meanwhile, seduces and murders an employee of the British Embassy to obtain access to the building. Scott, Stonebridge and Martinez ambush the weapons trade at a train yard, and McKenna is captured. However, Stonebridge fails to stop the IRA from escaping with the weapons when his impaired vision affects his combat abilities, prompting him to see a doctor.

After killing him, Section 20 successfully rescue Locke, who surmises that McKenna intends to attack a NATO hub. Three of McKenna's vans surround the British Embassy. Although Scott takes out one of the vans, the other two fire mortars at the embassy. In the chaos, an IRA team led by McKenna breaks into the building dressed as medics with the stolen access to clone sensitive NATO information from the secret basement area. Though they succeed in passing the harddrive, Locke captures McKenna for information on the identity of the IRA operative who killed his son twenty years before.

Section 20 further discover that Ulyanov, who is allied with al-Zuhari, is using Swedish hacker Erik Andersson (Andreas Utterhall), a prisoner, to decrypt the harddrive. To recover it, Scott and Stonebridge get themselves arrested as cocaine dealers and are sent to the prison, where they learn that Andersson is working under duress; his friends are being held hostage. Michael learns that he is infected with a neurotoxin, and has as long as two days to live unless he is injected with an antitoxin. Martinez and Richmond locate and rescue the hostages, but not before Andersson finishes the decryption. Kamali believes that al-Zuhari wants him dead after his car explodes. To rescue Andersson, Scott and Stonebridge start a prison riot, as Federal Security Service (FSB) Major Nina Pirogova (Tereza Srbova) arrives at the prison, apparently to collect Ulyanov's bounty on them, but it is revealed she is working with Locke to break them out. Andersson is being transferred; Stonebridge tries to rescue him, but he too is being taken away in the same van, while Scott and Pirogova are captured by prison guards.\n|LineColor = FF6426\n}}\n|Aux3 = 0.312\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|Aux4 = 0.832\n|ShortSummary = Scott and Pirogova break out while they are being transported to Ulyanov, and are saved from their pursuers by Martinez and Richmond. Meanwhile, Andersson and Stonebridge are taken to a secret biochemical facility in Drezna where scientists are testing prisoners with weaponised smallpox, which al-Zuhari wants to obtain. Stonebridge is deemed useless by the head doctor, Takenaka (Togo Igawa), due to his condition. He manages to kill his captors however, and learns from Andersson, who is infected with the smallpox, that he tagged all of NATO's cleanskins. After Stonebridge calls Section 20, they and Spetsnaz covertly surround the facility as Kamali arrives using his terrorist cover. After Ulyanov arrives, Section 20 and Spetsnaz raid the facility, where Scott gives Stonebridge the antitoxin. Ulyanov manages to escape with Kamali, whose cover is blown, and a sample of the smallpox. Later, the members of Section 20 watch a video recording of al-Zuhari's men executing Kamali.\n|LineColor = FF6426\n}}\n|Aux3 = 0.400\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|Aux4 = 0.742\n|ShortSummary = Section 20 follow al-Zuhari's main enforcer, Qassein (Philip Arditti), to Berlin, Germany.

Martinez and Richmond follow him to compound led by Raza Hassan (Fred Maamar Fortas), al-Zuhari's right-hand man. The team attack the compound by night; though Saleh and Hassan are both killed, the team retrieve a flash drive with the identities of the cleanskins. One of them, Colonel Novotny (Iván Fenyö), is posing as a Czech diplomat travelling to Frankfurt to attend a NATO meeting. Scott and Stonebridge intercept him on a train bound for the city. However, Novotny releases the smallpox in one of the carriages. Scott stops the train from approaching a populated area by parking a lorry at a level crossing, where Novotny dies. Afterwards, Scott and Stonebridge find that Ester's safe house is compromised, and the pair are taken hostage by Qassein and Kamali, who faked his death.\n|LineColor = FF6426\n}}\n|Aux3 = 0.436\n|OriginalAirDate =\n|Aux4 = 0.709\n|ShortSummary = Kamali reveals that he was the one responsible for the entire plot (al-Zuhari was in fact killed by the Israelis six months before) and is going to release the smallpox as revenge for his wife's death. Scott and Stonebridge escape capture, where Section 20 learns Kamali has implanted several cleanskins to Ramstein Air Base. As one of the cleanskins releases the virus in the hospital wing, infecting Martinez and others, Kamali hijacks an aircraft with the intent of flying over Berlin to release the virus and infect the city. Scott and Stonebridge rescue Richmond, who Kamali captured on the aircraft, before it takes off, where the plane is shot down. Kamali is not on board, and he and Ester are captured by Ulyanov, who demands Scott and Stonebridge turn themselves in, in exchange for Kamali. The exchange goes awry, resulting in Kamali and Ulyanov's deaths, though in his dying moments Kamali tells Ester that the necklace he gave her contains the cure to the virus. Section 20 take the cure to the base, where there is only enough to save those infected at the NATO base.\n|LineColor = FF6426\n}}\n}}\nCast\nReturning cast members for the series include Philip Winchester and Sullivan Stapleton, who return as protagonists Sergeant Michael Stonebridge and ex–Delta Force operative Sergeant Damian Scott, respectively, Rhona Mitra as Major Rachel Dalton, the head of Section 20 in Strike Back: Vengeance, the previous season, Michelle Lukes as Sergeant Julia Richmond, and Liam Garrigan as Sergeant Liam Baxter.
