They ruled from Amrargar and branched out to Bharatpur (on the bank of the Damodar) and Kanksa. The Sura kings occupy a somewhat mythical position in the region. It is estimated that they ruled between the late 4th century to around 11th century. They were believed to be based in Singheswar (in the northern Rarh region) and Gar Mandaran. One branch of the family was based in what is now Purba Bardhaman district. The capital of Bhu Sura, son of the legendary Adi Sura, was located at Surnagar or Surogram in the Monteswar police station area.\nSee also - Gourangapur for information on Ichhai Ghosh\nGeography\n| float=left|caption=Cities and towns in the Kalna subdivision of Purba Bardhaman districtM: municipal city/ town, CT: census town, R: rural/ urban centre, H: historical/ religious centre, C: craft centre.Owing to space constraints in the small map, the actual locations in a larger map may vary slightly\n|mark-coord1= | label-pos1=right|label1=Kalna | numbered1=M| mark-title1= Kalna, India (M)|label-color1=#800000 |label-size1=13| mark-size1=13|shape1=l-circle|shape-color1=#800000|shape-outline1=white|label-offset-x1=2\n|mark-coord2= | label-pos2=left|label2=Srirampur | numbered2=CT| mark-title2= Srirampur, Bardhaman (CT)|shape-color2=#A40000\n|mark-coord3= | label-pos3=left|label3=Hatsimla | numbered3=CT| mark-title3= Hatsimla (CT)|shape-color3=#A40000\n|mark-coord4= | label-pos4=right|label4=Jaluidanga | numbered4=CT| mark-title4= Jaluidanga (CT)|shape-color4=#A40000\n|mark-coord5= | label-pos5=left|label5=Gopinathpur | numbered5=CT| mark-title5= Gopinathpur, West Bengal (CT)|shape-color5=#A40000\n|mark-coord6= | label-pos6=right|label6=Nasratpur | numbered6=CT| mark-title6= Nasratpur (CT)|shape-color6=#A40000\n|mark-coord7= | label-pos7=right|label7=Dhatrigram | numbered7=CT| mark-title7= Dhatrigram (CT)|shape-color7=#A40000\n|mark-coord8= | label-pos8=right|label8=Piarinagar | numbered8=CT| mark-title8= Piarinagar (CT)|shape-color8=#A40000\n|mark-coord9= | label-pos9=left|label9=Uttar Goara | numbered9=CT| mark-title9= Uttar Goara (CT)|shape-color9=#A40000\n|mark-coord10= | label-pos10=left|label10=Shashpur | numbered10=CT| mark-title10= Shashpur (CT)|shape-color10=#A40000\n|mark-coord11= | label-pos11=right|label11= Nadanghat| numbered11=R| mark-title11= Nadanghat (R)| shape-color11=#C42222\n|mark-coord12= | label-pos12=right|label12= Purbasthali| numbered12=R| mark-title12= Purbasthali (R)| shape-color12=#C42222\n|mark-coord13= | label-pos13=right|label13= Monteswar| numbered13=R| mark-title13= Monteswar (R)| shape-color13=black| label-size13=13|label-color13=black\n|mark-coord14= | label-pos14=left|label14=Rangapara| numbered14=R| mark-title14= Rangapara, Kalna (R)| shape-color14=#C42222\n|mark-coord15= | label-pos15=left|label15=Singarkone| numbered15=R| mark-title15= Singarkone (R)| shape-color15=#C42222\n|mark-coord16= | label-pos16=left|label16=Parulia| numbered16=R| mark-title16= Parulia, Bardhaman (R)| shape-color16=#C42222\n|mark-coord17= | label-pos17=left|label17=Atgharia| numbered17=R| mark-title17= Atgharia (R)| shape-color17=#C42222\n|mark-coord18= | label-pos18=right|label18=Badla| numbered18=R| mark-title18= Badla, Purba Bardhaman (R)| shape-color18=#C42222\n|mark-coord19= | label-pos19=left|label19=Samudragarh| numbered19=C| mark-title19= Samudragarh (C)| shape-color19=#AA6666\n|mark-coord20= | label-pos20=right|label20=Patuli| numbered20=R| mark-title20= Patuli (R)| shape-color20=#C42222\n|mark-coord21= | label-pos21=left|label21= Baidyapur Jora Deul| numbered21=H| mark-title21= Baidyapur Jora Deul (H)| shape-color21=#AA6666\n|mark-coord22=| label22=Hooghly| label-color22 = #77A1CB| label-angle22=-90| label-pos22=right| label-size22=10| mark-size22=0| mark-title22 =none\n|mark-coord23=| label23=River| label-color23 = #77A1CB| label-angle23=-45| label-pos23=right| label-size23=10| mark-size23=0| mark-title23 =none\n|mark-coord24=| label24=Khari River| label-color24 = #77A1CB| label-angle24=55| label-pos24=top| label-size24=10| mark-size24=0| mark-title24 =none}}\nPhysiography\nMonteswar is a part of the flat alluvial and occasionally flood-prone Bardhaman Plain, the central plain area of the district.\nPolice station\nMonteswar police station has jurisdiction over Manteswar CD Block.
