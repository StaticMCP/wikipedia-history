The people directly elect the president for five years, for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The presidency is essentially a ceremonial office, but the president exercises certain limited powers with absolute discretion. Their official residence is the Grassalkovich Palace in Bratislava.\nHistory\nThe office was established by the constitution of Slovakia on 1 January 1993, when Slovakia permanently split from Czechoslovakia and became independent. The office was vacant until 2 March, when the first president, Michal Kováč, was elected by the National Council of Slovak Republic. However, in 1998, the National Council could not elect a successor to Kováč. As a result, the position was vacant for half a year after Kováč's term ended in March 1998. The duties and powers of the office devolved upon the then-prime minister and speaker of the National Council. To resolve the issue, the constitution was changed to provide for the popular election of the president. Presidential elections have been held in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, and 2024.\nPeter Pellegrini is the current president, taking office on 15 June 2024.\nRole and powers\n, seat of the president of Slovakia]]\nThe president of Slovakia has a limited role in policy-making, as the office is largely ceremonial within the framework of a parliamentary republic. According to the constitution, the president is the supreme representative of the state both in Slovakia and abroad.\nThe president represents the Slovak Republic externally and concludes and ratifies international treaties. The president may delegate to the government or, with the government's consent, to individual members of the Slovak Republic, the conclusion of international treaties. Historically, all Slovak presidents delegated this power to the government which has been done by Decision of President No. 250/2001 Coll. (which superseded Decision of President No. 205/1993 Coll.).\nAmong the president's constitutional powers are nominating and appointing the prime minister. The constitution does not limit the president's choice; through their decisions, the president ensures the due performance of constitutional bodies. Because the government of whoever is appointed prime minister must receive a vote of confidence in parliament, the president usually appoints the winning party or coalition leader in parliamentary elections.\nThe president has sole discretion to appoint three members of the judicial council, one member of the Budget Council, and two members of the council of the Nation's Memory Institute; to award distinctions, to appoint the president and vice-president of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic (from among the Constitutional Court judges), and to grant pardon or parole. They can veto any bill or proposal by the National Council, except for constitutional amendments. This veto can be overridden if the National Council passes the same bill again with a majority of all council members, so this power is considered relatively weak.\n]]\nThe president is formally the commander-in-chief of the Slovak armed forces, but this role is ceremonial because by the constitution when the president acts as the commander-in-chief, their decision is valid only after it is signed by the prime minister or a minister authorized by the prime minister.\nAmong their other constitutional duties are signing bills into law, appointing ministers on the prime minister's recommendation, and appointing various other state officials, such as generals, professors, judges, rectors, and prosecutors.\nThe president has discretionary power over the appointments of some officials. For example, there have been cases when the president has refused to appoint vice-governors of the National Bank of Slovakia recommended by the government. These actions of the president were confirmed by the Constitutional Court.\nPresidential powers are substantially increased in special circumstances when the National Council passes a vote of no confidence in the government. In such a case, many executive powers of government (e.g., appointment of officials, foreign trips, signing treaties) are subject to the president's approval, and the president can appoint the government without being subject to the parliament's approval.\nList of presidents of Slovakia\nCzechoslovakia (1918–1992)\n(First) Slovak Republic (1939–1945)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"line-height:1.4em; text-align:center; border:1px #aaf solid;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"3\" | Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"65\" | Election\n|-\n! width=\"85\" |\n! width=\"85\" |\n! width=\"10\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background: ; color:white\" |1\n|\n| Jozef Tiso\n| class=\"nowrap\" | 1939\n| class=\"nowrap\" | 1945\n|\n| HSĽS-SSNJ\n| 1939by his party\n|}\nSlovak Republic (since 1993)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"line-height:1.4em; text-align:center; border:1px #aaf solid;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"3\" | Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"65\" | Election\n|-\n! width=\"85\" |\n! width=\"85\" |\n! width=\"10\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background:#73C2FB; color:white\" |1\n|\n| Michal Kováč\n| class=\"nowrap\" | 1993\n| class=\"nowrap\" | 1998\n| 5 years\n|HZDS\n|1993\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f53e13; color:white\" |2\n|\n| Rudolf Schuster\n| class=\"nowrap\" | 1999\n| class=\"nowrap\" | 2004\n| 5 years\n|SOP\n|1999\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#79b6d7; color:white\" |3\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Ivan Gašparovič\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2004\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10 years\n|HZD\n|2004\n|-\n|None\n|2009\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cccccc; color:white\" |4\n|\n| Andrej Kiska\n| 2014\n| 2019\n| 5 years\n|None\n|2014\n|-\n! style=\"background:#00bdff; color:white\" |5\n|\n| Zuzana Čaputová\n| 2019\n| 2024\n| 5 years\n|PS\n|2019\n|-\n! style=\"background:#7e1447; color:white\" |6\n|\n| Peter Pellegrini\n| 2024\n| Incumbent\n|\n|Hlas\n|2024\n|-\n|}\nTimeline\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:3 start:1993\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1993\nLegend     = columns:3 left:110 top:77 columnwidth:245\nColors =\nid:ind   value:gray(0.8)              legend:Independent\nid:HZDS  value:rgb(0.45,0.76,1)       legend:Movement_for_a_Democratic_Slovakia\nid:SOP   value:rgb(0.96,0.24,0.08)    legend:Party_of_Civic_Understanding\nid:HZD   value:rgb(0.475,0.714,0.843) legend:Movement_for_Democracy\nid:PS    value:rgb(0,0.741,1)         legend:Progressive_Slovakia\nid:Hlas  value:rgb(0.49,0.07,0.28)   legend:Voice_Social_Democracy\nid:liteline    value:gray(0.8)\nid:line        value:rgb(0.3,0.3,0.3)\nid:bg          value:white\nDefine $now =\nTextData =\npos:(20,77) textcolor:black fontsize:s\ntext:\"Political Affiliation:\"\nBarData =\nbar:Kováč\nbar:Schuster\nbar:Gašparovič\nbar:Kiska\nbar:Čaputová\nbar:Pellegrini\nPlotData=\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:s shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbar:Kováč\nfrom: 02/03/1993 till: 02/03/1998 color:HZDS text:\"Michal Kováč\"\nbar:Schuster\nfrom: 15/06/1999 till: 15/06/2004 color:SOP  text:\"Rudolf Schuster\"\nbar:Gašparovič\nfrom: 15/06/2004 till: 15/06/2009 color:HZD\nfrom: 15/06/2009 till: 15/06/2014 color:Ind  text:\"Ivan Gašparovič\"\nbar:Kiska\nfrom: 15/06/2014 till: 15/06/2019 color:Ind  text:\"Andrej Kiska\"\nbar:Čaputová\nfrom: 15/06/2019 till: 15/06/2024 color:PS   text:\"Zuzana Čaputová\"\nbar:Pellegrini\nfrom: 15/06/2024 till: end        color:Hlas text:\"Peter Pellegrini\"\n}}\nActing presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Term\n|-\n|Vladimír MečiarIvan Gašparovič\n|2 March 1998 – 30 October 1998\n|-\n|Mikuláš DzurindaJozef Migaš\n|30 October 1998 – 15 June 1999\n|}\nLatest election\n|party9=Independent|votes9=3111\n|cand10=Andrej Danko|party10=Slovak National Party|votes10=1905\n|cand11=Róbert Švec|party11=|votes11=1876|color11=#AA1801\n|invalid=10563|invalid2=17233\n|electorate=4364071|electorate2=4368697\n|source=[https://www.volbysr.sk/en/vysledky_hlasovania_kolo1.html First Round], [https://www.volbysr.sk/en/vysledky_hlasovania_kolo2.html Second Round]\n}}\nSee also\n*List of prime ministers of Slovakia\n*List of speakers of Slovak parliaments\n*List of presidents of Czechoslovakia\nNotes\nReferences"
