BAFTA is a British organisation that hosts annual awards shows for film, television, and video games (and formerly also for children's film and television).\nIntroduced in 2025 after BAFTA changed multiple polices in their award categories, the category was made to showcase films that had inter-generational interest to children, young people and adults. For a film to be considered eligible for the category, it must be rated either a U, PG or 12a by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).\nIn the following lists, the titles and names in bold with a gold background are the winners and recipients respectively; those not in bold are the nominees. The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which always takes place the following year.\nWinners and nominees\n2020s (inauguration)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:26%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Director(s)\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Producer(s)\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"| }}\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\"| Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\"| Nick Park, Merlin Crossingham\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\"| Richard Beek\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86\"| United Kingdom\n|-\n| Flow\n| Gints Zilbalodis\n| Matīss Kaža\n| Latvia\n|-\n| ''Kensuke's Kingdom\n| Neil Boyle, Kirk Hendry\n| Camilla Deakin, Ruth Fielding, Stephen Roellants\n| United KingdomLuxembourgFrance\n|-\n| The Wild Robot''\n| Chris Sanders\n| \tJeff Hermann\n| United States\n|}\nReferences"
