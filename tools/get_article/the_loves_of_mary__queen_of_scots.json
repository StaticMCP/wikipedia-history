The film depicts the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her eventual execution. It was one of the final films made by Ideal, one of the leading British studios, before they were hit by the Slump of 1924. It is most likely considered a lost film.\nCast\n* Fay Compton as Mary Stuart\n* Gerald Ames as Bothwell\n* Ivan Samson as Lord Dudley\n* John Stuart as George Douglas\n* Ellen Compton as Queen Elizabeth I of England\n* Lionel d'Aragon as Moray\n* Harvey Braban as Ruthven\n* Irene Rooke as Catherine de' Medici\n* Donald Macardle as Francis II\n* René Maupré as Rizzio\n* Ernest A.
