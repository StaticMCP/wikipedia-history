Formerly announced during Adelaide Writers' Week in March, as part of the Adelaide Festival, from 2024 the awards are announced in a dedicated ceremony in October. The awards include national as well as state-based prizes, and offer three fellowships for South Australian writers. Several categories have been added to the original four.\nHistory\nThe Adelaide Festival Awards for Literature were created by the Government of South Australia in 1986 and awarded during Writers' Week as part of the Adelaide Festival.\nIn 2020, the State Library of South Australia (SLSA) took over administration of the awards from Arts South Australia, and library director Geoff Strempel felt that the awards being presented in the late afternoon right at the end of a busy Writers' Week meant that they did not get the attention they deserved, especially compared with its interstate equivalents.\nFrom 2024, the awards are renamed the South Australian Literary Awards (a name in line with its interstate equivalents), and the awards ceremony takes place in the Mortlock Chamber of the SLSA towards the end of the year, away from the festival season. The first of the rebranded awards takes place in October 2024. The shortlist was announced on 9 August 2024.\nDescription\nThe Premier's Award is the richest prize, worth , and awarded for the best overall published work which has already won an award in one of the other categories. There is a total prize pool of , which is distributed 11 categories, including the Premier's Award. There are six national and five South Australian categories.\nOther national awards, worth  each as of 2024, are the Fiction Award, Children's Literature Award, Young Adult Fiction Award, John Bray Poetry Award, and the Non-Fiction Award. South Australian awards and fellowships are the Jill Blewett Playwright's Award, the Arts South Australia/Wakefield Press Unpublished Manuscript Award, the Barbara Hanrahan Fellowship, the Max Fatchen Fellowship (in honour of Adelaide author and journalist Max Fatchen), and the Tangkanungku Pintyanthi Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fellowship. Applications for each year's awards are open until mid-December of the preceding year.\nThe awards are jointly funded by the SA government and the Libraries Board of South Australia.\nNational awards\nPremier's Award\nWinners:\n* 1996 The Future Eaters by Tim Flannery (Reed Books)\n* 1998 The Drowner by Robert Drewe (Pan MacMillan)\n* 2000 ''Mr. Darwin's Shooter by Roger McDonald (Vintage Books)\n* 2002 True History of the Kelly Gang by Peter Carey (University of Queensland Press)\n* 2004 Wild Surmise by Dorothy Porter (Picador)\n* 2006 Sixty Lights by Gail Jones (Vintage Books)\n* 2008 Urban Myths: 210 Poems by John Tranter (University of Queensland Press)\n* 2010 Tales from Outer Suburbia by Shaun Tan (Allen and Unwin)\n* 2012 That Deadman Dance by Kim Scott (Picador Australia)\n* 2014 Cold Light by Frank Moorhouse\n* 2016 Figgy in the World by Tamsin Janu\n* 2018 The Last Garden by Eva Hornung\n* 2020 Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow by Jessica Townsend (Lothian)\n*2022 The Yield by Tara June Winch\n*2024 Childhood by Shannon Burns\nFiction Award\nWinners:\n* 1986 The Children's Bach by Helen Garner (McPhee Gribble)\n* 1988 Julia Paradise by Rod Jones (McPhee Gribble)\n* 1990 Oscar and Lucinda by Peter Carey (University of Queensland Press)\n* 1992 The Great World by David Malouf (Chatto & Windus)\n* 1994 Grand Days by Frank Moorhouse (William Heinemann Australia)\n* 1996 Death of a River Guide by Richard Flanagan (McPhee Gribble/Penguin)\n* 1998 The Drowner by Robert Drewe (Pan MacMillan)\n* 2000 Mr. Darwin's Shooter by Roger McDonald (Vintage Books)\n* 2002 True History of the Kelly Gang by Peter Carey (University of Queensland Press)\n* 2004 Moral Hazard by Kate Jennings (Picador)\n* 2006 Sixty Lights by Gail Jones (Vintage Books)\n* 2008 The Ballad of Desmond Kale by Roger McDonald (Vintage Books)\n* 2010 Ransom by David Malouf (Knopf/Random House)\n* 2012 That Deadman Dance by Kim Scott (Picador Australia)\n* 2014 Cold Light by Frank Moorhouse\n* 2016 To Name Those Lost by Rohan Wilson\n* 2018 The Last Garden by Eva Hornung\n* 2020 The Death of Noah Glass by Gail Jones (Text)\n* 2022 The Yield by Tara June Winch\n* 2024 Permafrost'' by SJ Norman\nChildren's Literature Award\nWinners:\n* 1986 The Long Night Watch by Ivan Southall (Methuen)\n* 1988 Space Demons by Gillian Rubinstein (Omnibus Books)\n* 1990 Beyond the Labyrinth by Gillian Rubinstein (Hyland House)\n* 1992 The House Guest by Eleanor Nilsson (Viking Penguin)\n* 1994 ''Angel's Gate by Gary Crew (William Heinemann Australia)\n* 1996 The Third Day, the Frost by John Marsden (Pan MacMillan)\n* 1998 The Listmaker by Robin Klein (Viking Penguin)\n* 2000 Deadly, Unna?
