It consists of two tracks facing a 96&nbsp;cm-high central platform on the Homburg Railway and two passing tracks on the Main-Weser Railway. There was formerly a junction at the station with a branch to the now closed main freight yard.\nLocation\nAt the southern end of the station, the Main-Weser line divides into ramps towards Frankfurt Central Station, connecting with the Main-Neckar line and the Taunus line.\nThe station is elevated above the streets of Mainzer Landstraße and Frankenallee. Escalators connect the platform and the two streets.\nServices\nThe station is served by S-Bahn lines S3, S4, S5 and S6. Intercity and regional trains run past on the Main Weser tracks, which have no platforms at Galluswarte.\nBelow the station, on Mainzer Landstraße, there is an interchange with tram lines 11 and 21, and with bus line 52.\nReferences"
