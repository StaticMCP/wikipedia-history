It combines two previously separate categories in the Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music field, Best Gospel Song (for songwriters) and Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance (for performers). The current category recognizes both songwriters and performers (solo/duos/groups/collaborations/etc.) and is open for singles or tracks only. Songwriters are only awarded a Grammy Award if it is a newly written song. Grammys for cover versions of previously recorded songs are awarded to the performer(s) only.\nThese changes were made in June 2014 by NARAS \"in the interest of clarifying the criteria, representing the current culture and creative DNA of the gospel and Contemporary Christian Music communities, and better reflecting the diversity and authenticity of today's gospel music industry.\"\nAlong with its sister category Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song, both are the only Grammy categories that award both performers and songwriters.\nAccording to the Grammy committee, the move recognizes \"the critical contribution of both songwriters and performers by combining  songwriters and artists into the Best Gospel Performance/Song and Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song categories.\" The category awards traditional Christian, roots gospel or contemporary gospel music.\nContemporary Christian Music performances, which were previously recognized in the Best Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music Performance category, now fall under the Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song category only.\nKirk Franklin has won the most Grammy's in this category, six as of 2024. (If a winning artist is both the performer and the composer, they win just one Grammy).\nRecipients\nwas the first recipient of the award alongside Aaron W.
