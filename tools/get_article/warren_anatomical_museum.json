The Warren also has objects significant to medical history, such as the inhaler used during the first public demonstration of ether-assisted surgery in 1846 (on loan to the Massachusetts General Hospital since 1948), and the skull of Phineas Gage, who survived a large iron bar being driven through his brain. The museum's first curator was J.B.S. Jackson.\nEarly 2020s closure\nThe museum gallery was closed for renovation through winter/spring 2023, as stated on the museum's website, although the collection remains accessible to researchers by appointment. Normally a rotating subset of items, including Gage's skull and the tamping iron that passed through it, is on public display.\n__NOTOC__\nSee also\n*William Fiske Whitney\n*Harvard Dental Museum\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.countway.harvard.edu/center-history-medicine/warren-anatomical-museum Warren Museum website]\n* [http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/deepLink?_collection=oasis&uniqueId=med00145 Finding aid for Warren Anatomical Museum] in Francis A.
