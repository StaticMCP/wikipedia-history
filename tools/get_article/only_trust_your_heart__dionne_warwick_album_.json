It was released by MPCA Records and RED Music on March 15, 2011. A specialty album that is devoted to the work of lyricist Sammy Cahn, it reached the top ten of the US Billboard Top Jazz Albums.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAllmusic editor William Ruhlmann found that Warwick gives \"Cahn's better-known works [...]  a variety of musical settings, starting with the bossa nova arrangement of the title song and going on to small jazz bands, big string orchestras, solo piano accompaniments, and even a blues reading (\"Keep Me in Mind\"). She ignores previous interpretations, making each song her own [...] If she never really put both feet into any one genre of music, that has turned out to serve her well on a late album like this, on which she demonstrates a mastery of several classic pop styles, just as Cahn was able to switch gears as a lyricist-for-hire throughout his distinguished (if often unheralded) career.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks produced by Michael Mangini.\nTracks 1, 3, 10, 12 orchestrated by Nathan Kelly.\n| length1         = 4:32\n| title2          = You I Love\n| writer2         =\n| length2         = 2:26\n| title3          = I'm a Fool to Want You\n| writer3         =\n| length3         = 4:10\n| title4          = Wonder Why\n| writer4         =\n| length4         = 2:49\n| title5          = If You Can Dream\n| writer5         =\n| length5         = 4:02\n| title6          = The Second Time Around\n| writer6         =\n| length6         = 2:30\n| title7          = Come Out, Come Out Wherever You Are\n| writer7         =\n| length7         = 2:30\n| title8          = I'll Never Stop Loving You\n| writer8         =\n| length8         = 5:08\n| title9          = Some Other Time\n| writer9         =\n| length9         = 2:48\n| title10         = I Fall in Love Too Easily\n| writer10        =\n| length10        = 3:40\n| title11         = Keep Me in Mind\n| writer11        =\n| length11        = 3:52\n| title12         = And Then You Kissed Me\n| writer12        =\n| length12        = 2:56\n| title13         = Pocketful of Miracles\n| writer13        =\n| length13        = 2:42\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2011)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Various\n| March 15, 2011\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
