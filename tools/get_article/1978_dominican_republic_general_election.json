Following diplomatic pressure from American President Jimmy Carter, the elections were free and competitive and contested by all political parties, unlike the previous elections in the 1970s. Antonio Guzmán Fernández won the presidential election, whilst his Dominican Revolutionary Party (which had not contested the 1970 and 1974 elections) won the Congressional elections. Voter turnout was 76%.\nWhen counting showed an unmistakable trend toward Guzmán, the Army attempted to stage a coup in favor of incumbent Joaquín Balaguer. However, when the army tried to interrupt the vote count, it was forced to back down amid protests at home and strong pressure from abroad.  The final count showed Balaguer had suffered the first defeat of his career, losing by almost 10 points. Although Guzmán was allowed to assume the presidency, the Central Elections Authority redistributed the uncast votes equally between the PRD and the Reformist Party, diminishing the PRD's majority in Congress.\nGuzmán's swearing-in on 16 August marked the first time in the country's history that a sitting government had peacefully surrendered power to an elected member of the opposition.\nResults\nPresident\n|party5=Dominican Communist Party|votes5=9828\n|cand6=Alfonso Lockward|party6=Social Christian Revolutionary Party|votes6=7981\n|cand7=Luis Julián Pérez|party7=National Salvation Movement|votes7=7782\n|cand8=|party8=People's Democratic Party|votes8=5956\n|invalid=85530\n|electorate=2283784\n|source=Nohlen\n}}\nCongress\n|votes5=13316|st1t5=0|st2t5=New|st3t5=0|st4t5=New\n|party6=Social Christian Revolutionary Party|votes6=11094|st1t6=0|st2t6=New|st3t6=0|st4t6=New\n|party7=Social Democratic Alliance|votes7=11056|st1t7=0|st2t7=New|st3t7=0|st4t7=New\n|party8=Dominican Communist Party|votes8=10751|st1t8=0|st2t8=New|st3t8=0|st4t8=New\n|party9=Movement of National Reconciliation|votes9=7743|st1t9=0|st2t9=New|st3t9=0|st4t9=New\n|party10=National Salvation Movement|votes10=7727|st1t10=0|st2t10=New|st3t10=0|st4t10=New\n|party11=Democratic Quisqueyano Party|votes11=5984|st1t11=0|st2t11=New|st3t11=0|st4t11=New\n|party12=People's Democratic Party|votes12=5667|st1t12=0|st2t12=–3|st3t12=0|st4t12=0\n|party13=Revolutionary Movement of the People|votes13=3867|st1t13=0|st2t13=New|st3t13=0|st4t13=New\n|party14=Independent Provincial Union Movement|votes14=1998|st1t14=0|st2t14=New|st3t14=0|st4t14=New\n|party15=Justicialist Popular Movement|votes15=1649|st1t15=0|st2t15=New|st3t15=0|st4t15=New\n|party16=Santuagúes Restoration Movement|votes16=1428|st1t16=0|st2t16=New|st3t16=0|st4t16=New\n|party17=Municipal Movement of the People|votes17=284|st1t17=0|st2t17=–1|st3t17=0|st4t17=0\n|invalid=85530\n|electorate=2283784\n|total_st2t=0|total_st4t=0\n|source=Nohlen, Campillo Pérez\n}}\nReferences"
