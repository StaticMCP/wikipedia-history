The award ceremony will take place on October 17, 2025, in Pasadena. As of July 10, 2025, there was no venue that has been announced. On September 4, it was announced the 52nd Daytime Emmys and Creative Arts Emmys would be held at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. As of September 17, 2025, the Daytime Emmys will be streamed only.\nCeremony information\nNATAS president Adam Sharp announced January 8, 2025, that the Daytime Emmys and the Daytime Creative Arts Emmys would move to October and trade places with the 46th News and Documentary Emmy Awards to highlight the \"timely nature\" of news and documentary programming. Sharp said of the forty-two categories, \"We’re excited to recognize the exceptional individuals and teams who make daytime television great every year and in some cases, every day. As the Daytime landscape continues to expand, we’re excited to introduce new categories to recognize the boundary-pushing work being done.\" The nominations were announced on July 10, 2025, alongside the nominees for the main ceremony categories and that instead of two separate dates for both ceremonies that there would be one ceremony for both. The same day NATAS announced the enforcement of the rules where any category that has fewer than ten (10) submissions, no more than 50% of submitted entries may be nominated. Hence why The Bold and the Beautiful, The Bay, and Neighbours were not nominated. NATAS will honor programming and creative arts & lifestyle from January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2024. Beyond the Gates started broadcasting on CBS and streaming on Paramount + in February 2025 as to why no one or department was nominated from the show. While the ceremony was broadcast on CBS from 2020 to 2024 and streaming on Paramount +, Paramount Global had not signed a new broadcasting agreement with NATAS. Viewers will be able to watch the telecast from their mobile devices, Smart TVs, and many other connected devices such as Apple TV, Roku, Android TV, Fire TV, Chromecast, and iPad. Later in the day of July 10, it was announced that Paramount Global had signed an agreement with NATAS. CBS will broadcast and Paramount + will stream the entire ceremony. On September 4, it was announced the 52nd Daytime Emmys and Creative Arts Emmys would be held at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. On September 17, it was announced the Daytime Emmys would only be streaming, and the host will be Mario Lopez.\nCategory changes\n* A new category, Outstanding Emerging Talent in a Daytime Drama Series, honors performers who are in their first two years on their first daytime drama series. Unlike the retired Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series and its gender-specific predecessors, there would be no maximum age limit. However, one who is wins it once would be disqualified from winning it a second time.\n* Outstanding Culinary Program was divided into two specific categories: Outstanding Culinary Instructional Series honoring those shows more instructive in food preparation and cooking, and Outstanding Culinary Cultural Series honoring those shows focused more on the cultural aspects of food.\n* Outstanding Travel, Adventure and Nature Program was divided into two specific categories: Outstanding Travel and Adventure Program honoring those shows focused more on travel, and Outstanding Nature and Science Program honoring those shows focused more on the science of the natural world.\n* Outstanding Regional Content in a Daytime Genre was created for outstanding regional work that will be awarded with a Crystal Pillar.\n* Outstanding Original Song was eliminated.\nWinners and Nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger
