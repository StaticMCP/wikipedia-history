However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nAir Technical Service Command\n* Buffalo MAP, Buffalo\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil AirportAircraft modification center.\n: Also contract flying school operated by Curtiss-Wright Corp.\n: Now: Buffalo Niagara International Airport\n* Farmingdale AAF, Farmingdale\n: 436th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Used by Republic Aircraft\n: Now: Republic Airport\n* Niagara Falls MAP, Niagara Falls\n: Aircraft modification center\n: Niagara Falls International Airport and\n:  Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station\n* Rome AAF, Rome\n: 420th Army Air Force Base Unit (Rome ASC)\n: Was: Rome Air Force Base (1948)\n: Was: Griffiss Air Force Base (1948-1991)\n: Now:  Rome Laboratory (1991-Pres)\n:: Wheeler Sack Field AAF, Deferiet\n:: Sub-base of Rome AAF\n:: Supported Fort Drum\n:: Now: Wheeler-Sack Army Airfield, Active US Army Airfield.\n* Syracuse AAB, Syracuse\n: 393d Army Air Force Base Unit (Rome ASC)\n: Now: Syracuse Hancock International Airport\n:  Hancock Field Air National Guard Base\nAir Transport Command\n* La Guardia Field, New York City\n: 523d Army Air Force Base Unit (Reduced)\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: La Guardia Airport\n* Albany MAP, Albany\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: Now: Albany International Airport\nFirst Air Force\n* Mitchel AAF, Garden City\n: 1st Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Mitchel Air Force Base (1947-1961)\n: Now: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071221082902/http://www.airfields-freeman.com/NY/Airfields_NY_LongIsC.htm#Mitchel Non-flying facility part of greater NYC urbanised area].\n* Suffolk County AAF, Westhampton Beach\n: 437th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Suffolk County Air Force Base (1947-1969)\n: Was: Suffolk County Airport (1969-1991) and Suffolk County Air National Guard Base (1970-1991)\n: Now: Francis S.
