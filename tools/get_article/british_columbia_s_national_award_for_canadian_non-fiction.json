Awarded annually since 2005 by the British Columbia Achievement Foundation, it was the largest non-fiction prize in Canada, rising from $25,000 in its initial years to $40,000 in 2008. Despite being presented by a BC-based organization, the award was not limited to writers from British Columbia, and instead was open to all non-fiction work by Canadian writers.\nIn May 2018, the British Columbia Achievement Foundation announced that it was discontinuing the award as part of a process of refocusing the foundation's activities and programs.\nWinners\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Nominated\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2005\n| 'Patrick Lane, There Is a Season'\n|\n*Jane Jacobs, Dark Age Ahead\n*Harry Thurston, ''A Place Between the Tides: A Naturalist's Reflections on the Salt Marsh\n*Ronald Wright, A Short History of Progress\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2006\n| 'Rebecca Godfrey, Under the Bridge: The True Story of the Murder of Reena Virk '\n|\n*J.
