The single preceded her self-titled debut album (2024), which was released to critical acclaim and moderate commercial success, entering or approaching the top 25 in multiple countries including the United States.\nTyla is the youngest African artist in history to win a Grammy Award. Her other accolades include an MTV Video Music Award, two BET Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards and the honorary Global Force Award at the first Billboard R&B's No. 1's, among nominations for a Brit Award, an Ivor Novello Award, a Soul Train Music Award and nine South African Music Awards."
