Due to a temporary peace between the Armagnacs and Burgundians, the treaty was never fulfilled.\nContext\nIn November 1407, Louis I, Duke of Orléans was assassinated, starting a civil war in France between the Armagnacs and the Burgundians. In consequence, both parties sought Henry IV's assistance for the war.\nIn 1411, Henry IV sent a small contingent to help John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. In 1412, the Armagnacs offered the restitution of Aquitaine in return for military aid.\nAgreement\nOn May 18, 1412, the Armagnacs recognized the sovereignty of Henry IV in the Duchy of Aquitaine in return for an army of 4,000 men.\nIn exchange for military aid the allied princes of France, John, Duke of Berry, Charles, Duke of Orléans, John I, Duke of Bourbon and John I, Duke of Alençon pledged to help Henry IV recover Aquitaine and agreed to pay homage to the English sovereign for the fiefs they possess in the duchy.
