Subsequently, he traveled in West Africa and the West Indies, making natural history collections.\nIn 1860, he returned to Rochester, where he was a professor at the University of Rochester until 1865. In Rochester, he founded Ward's Natural Science Establishment, a pioneering enterprise that collected and prepared taxidermy, fossils, and other animal remains from all parts of the world for sale to colleges, universities, museums, and private collectors.\nHe published:\n* Notices of the Megatherium Cuvieri (1863)\n* Descriptions of the Most Celebrated Fossil Animals in the Royal Museums of Europe (1866)\nIn 1897, he married a widow, Lydia Avery Coonley, (1845–1924), president of the Chicago Woman's Club in 1895-96, who wrote Under the Pines, and other Verses (1895); Singing Verses for Children (1897); Love Songs (1898).\nHe died on July 4, 1906, after being struck by a motorist in Buffalo, New York, becoming Buffalo's first automobile related fatality. His ashes were interred in Mount Hope Cemetery in a niche in his granite monument. Subsequently the ashes were stolen.
