The Chief Chronicler was the official authority on Portuguese historiography, and the post was soon associated to the post of Keeper of the Royal Archives, already centralised in an autonomous way in the 1370s — a singularity in late medieval history in both its precocious creation and organisation.\nThe first to occupy the position was Fernão Lopes, in 1434. The last occupant was writer and politician Almeida Garrett, who was sacked in 1841, after fiercely criticising António José de Ávila (who was then Minister of the Exchequer), and no one was appointed to replace him. The following year, Minister of the Kingdom Costa Cabral issued a decree extinguishing the position of Chief Chronicler and transferring its responsibilities to the Keeper of the Royal Archives.\nList of Chief Chroniclers of the Kingdom\n:The following list is sorted by date of appointment:\n# 1434 – Fernão Lopes\n# 1459 – Gomes Eanes de Zurara\n# 1484 – Vasco Fernandes de Lucena\n# 1497 – Rui de Pina\n# 1525 – Fernão de Pina\n# 1550 – D.
