The ministry existed from 1808 through the establishment of the German Empire and was dissolved in 1919, being succeeded by the Ministry of the Reichswehr.\nFormation\nThe Prussian Ministry of War was gradually established between 1808 and 1809 as part of a series of reforms initiated by the Military Reorganization Commission created after the disastrous Treaties of Tilsit. The War Ministry was to help bring the Army under constitutional review, and, along with the General Staff, systematize the conduct of warfare. Gerhard von Scharnhorst, the most prominent and influential of the reformers, served as acting Minister of War from roughly 1808 until 1810 (he was also concurrently Chief of the General Staff).\nThe War Ministry was established on 25 December 1808, replacing the existing military institutions. The Ministry initially consisted of two departments. The first department was responsible for the command and condition of the army, the second for its financial administration.\nAt first, no Minister of War was appointed due to resistance from Frederick William III, the King of Prussia. Gerhard von Scharnhorst became head of the first department (the General War Department or Allgemeines Kriegsdepartement) and Lieutenant Colonel Graf Lottum became head of the second department. Scharnhorst also functioned as acting Minister of War, as long as no permanent appointment was made.\nThe first department initially consisted of three divisions. The first division represented the continuation of the old Prussian Adjutancy-General and was also known as the \"Privy Military Cabinet\" (Geheimes Kriegskabinett). It in turn had control over the General War Chancellery (Allgemeine Kriegskanzlei). The second division dealt with general army matters, including troop formation, replacements and turnover, accommodations, military exercises and mobilization. A third division was also created, the artillery and engineering department. This in turn comprised the artillery section, which dealt with artillery equipment, rifle production, cannon foundries, powder factories, etc., and the engineering section, which was primarily responsible for the maintenance of fortifications.\nThe second department, the military economy department (Militär-Ökonomie Departement), had four divisions. The first division was responsible for pay, the second for provisioning, the third for clothing and the fourth for invalids.\nOrganization in 1914\nOver the years from its founding, the structure of the Ministry of War evolved.

War Raw Materials Section (Kriegs-Rohstoff-Abteilung) (KRA)'\nOver the course of the war, further reorganizations would take place, most importantly with regard to the organization of the war economy. Among the most significant was the establishment of the War Office (Kriegsamt) and the .\nPrussian Ministers of War, 1808–1919\nScharnhorst was succeeded by General der Infanterie Karl von Hake, who served as minister from 1810 to 1813 and from 1819 to 1833. Hermann von Boyen, another prominent reformer alongside Scharnhorst, served as minister from 1813 to 1819 and again from 1841-to 1847 and was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall in 1847.\nAmong other long-serving ministers was Albrecht Graf von Roon, who served as minister from 1859 to 1873, during the Second Schleswig War (1864), the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) and was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall in 1873. General der Infanterie Georg von Kameke succeeded Graf von Roon and served from 1873 to 1883.\nKarl von Einem would serve as minister from 1903 to 1909 and would be recalled in World War I, commanding the 3rd Army from 1914 to 1918. Erich von Falkenhayn was named Minister of War on 7 June 1913 and held the office during the opening stages of World War I. He would succeed Helmuth von Moltke the Younger as Chief of the General Staff from 14 September 1914 to 29 August 1916. Falkenhayn was briefly concurrently minister and chief of the general staff until 21 January 1915, when Adolf Wild von Hohenborn succeeded him as minister. Wild von Hohenborn was dismissed on 29 October 1916 and replaced by Hermann von Stein, who held the office until shortly before the end of the war. Stein was succeeded on 9 October 1918 by Heinrich Schëuch, though by that point much of the ministry's responsibilities had been assumed by the higher military staff under Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff. Walther Reinhardt would serve as the last Prussian Minister of War in 1919.\nLocations\nFor one hundred years, from 1 January 1819 to 1 January 1919 (when the ministry ceased to exist), it was located in the Friedrichstadt quarter of what is today Berlin-Mitte:\nThe main building was on Leipziger Straße 5 facing south, with the garden bordering on the Prinz-Albrecht-Palais (demolished in 1935 to erect the Ministry of Aviation building). Additional offices were later established in other parts of Berlin.\n* Wilhelmstrasse 81 - used from 1824.\n* Behrenstraße 66 - used by the General Staff after approximately 1820, transferred to the War Ministry from 1871. From 1900 it was used by the Military Cabinet. The building is now the rear part of offices belonging to the Russian Embassy.\n* Hinter dem Gießhaus 2 (behind the Zeughaus) - used by the Military Cabinet from 1820 to 1900.\nA new building was built for the General Staff between 1867 and 1871 in the Tiergarten at the Königsplatz (now the Platz der Republik), with its western corner facing the Moltkestraße.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Curt Jany: Geschichte der preußischen Armee – vom 15.
