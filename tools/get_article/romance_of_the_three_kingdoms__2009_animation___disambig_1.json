It was broadcast in Japan starting April 2010.\nProduction\nThis is a collaboration between Beijing Huihuang Animation, an animation production company under the umbrella of China Central Television (CCTV), and Future Planet Corporation, a Japanese video planning and production company. The production cost was 650 million yen. Takara Tomy releases figures for the Japan-China joint production of \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms: The Strongest Generals\".  The production period was 25 months (although some articles claim it was four years), and a total of more than 2,000 staff members were involved in the production.  A Japanese anime director provided the storyboard manuscript, and the Chinese side produced the animation. It was produced in the form of.  In mainland China, the series began broadcasting on CCTV-8 (TV Drama Channel) in August 2009.\nWhile many of the film adaptations of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms end with the Battle of Red Cliffs, this work depicts the unification of China by the Jin. For example, the first episode carefully depicts the events leading up to Diao Chan's adoption by Wang Yun, intertwined with the depiction of the turbulent times, while the story moves quickly from the Oath of the Peach Garden to the suppression of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Zhang Fei's beating of the governor. While some episodes, such as the Battle of Red Cliffs, are depicted over several episodes, many episodes are omitted or shortened, and are done with narration. In the Japanese dubbed version, the characters are referred to by their surnames and given names, perhaps to prioritize clarity.\nTakara Tomy, a major Japanese toy manufacturer, also invested 250 million yen into the production costs, and the company is importing and selling merchandise related to the series, such as figurines and card games. To commemorate HoriPro's 50th anniversary, a star-studded cast of voice actors will be cast in the \"Sangoku Engi\" series, in which heroes compete for supremacy, which will begin airing in April.\nFuture Planet, the Japanese production company, was already in financial trouble before the series aired, and was unable to pay the production costs it was supposed to cover, so it transferred the rights to the series that it held to another production company.  The company dismissed all of its employees on July 31, 2010, and was filed for bankruptcy by its creditors on August 26. It received a decision to commence bankruptcy proceedings on September 29.\nThe series cost ¥650 million (US$7.8 million).\nJapanese version\nThe series was exhibited at the 2009 Tokyo International Anime Fair in March 2009, and a promotional video was released in which the Chinese voices of characters such as Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei were subtitled in Japanese.\nIn March 2010, it was officially decided that the Japanese version would be broadcast, and a press conference was held to announce the program. At the event, it was announced that the program would be called the \"50th Anniversary Program of Horipro\" in Japan, and that actors and talents affiliated with Horipro would be providing the voices and narration for the main characters, as well as about half of the characters appearing in the work.\nWith the broadcast of this work, the \"Jewelpet (anime)|Jewelpet\" series, which had been broadcast in this time slot as the successor to the \"Onegai My Melody\" series, was moved to a local sales slot produced by TV Tokyo.
