Their music features an eclectic range of electronic, woodwind, string and brass instruments, with a musical style described as \"indie rock meets hip hop production with a sprinkle of Disney\". Kings Kaleidoscope has recorded four EPs and six LPs, as well as a series of live studio sessions.\nBackground\nBased out of Seattle, Washington, Kings Kaleidoscope formed in 2010 at a Mars Hill Church plant on the campus of the University of Washington, where Gardner was a worship leader. Drawing on a variety of influences from math rock and hip-hop, to the dense sound of Canadian indie outfit Broken Social Scene, they recorded their first live EP, Sin, at a Good Friday service in 2011. A year later, they released the studio EP, ''Asaph's Arrows, followed by a Christmas EP, Joy Has Dawned''.\nIn late 2013, Gardner and the band announced they were leaving Mars Hill,  where they had served as worship leaders and artists on the church's label. Their fourth EP, 2014's Live in Color, was released by BadChristian Music. Working with BadChristian Music and well-established indie label Tooth & Nail Records, they released their debut LP, Becoming Who We Are, on October 27, 2014. Their second studio album Beyond Control was released June 24, 2016, and was the band's most commercially successful release to date.\nOn August 17, 2017, the band released a mixtape, The Beauty Between, that includes several collaborations with hip-hop artists and producers, including Propaganda, Andy Mineo, Beautiful Eulogy, Derek Minor, and Beleaf, and including Daniel Steele (as DSTL) and John McNeill (credited as 42* North) on record for the first time.\nTheir third studio album, Zeal, was released on April 5, 2019, followed by an international tour with their new lineup.\nAfter taking a touring hiatus due to the 2020 COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, and in response to the increasing politicization of the American church during the election year, they dropped the three-song \"Power Perfect\" EP on October 30, 2020, which contains the rousing \"W.D.Y.K.A.G?\" featuring frequent collaborator Propaganda, a call to \"Burn Babylon Down\", referring to the co-opting of the government world systems or \"Babylons\" that sometimes influence the church more than Jesus does, and will be destroyed at His second coming (Revelation 18:21).\nMore than two years later, Kings announced that they were working on their fourth studio album \"Baptized Imagination\", a work that they crafted and edited while on tour throughout 2022, finally culminating in a November 2022 release. The following year they released their fifth studio and first self-titled album \"Kings Kaleidoscope\", also drawing from the 2022 tour creation process.\nBand members\nKings Kaleidoscope is a project led by Chadwick \"Chad\" Gardner with a large rotating cast of collaborators. During the band's early years as a worship band for Mars Hill, the band featured local college students and church volunteers, some of whom included Mark Palfreeman, Beth Vander Pol, and Eric Shoubridge, who all contributed to ''Asaph's Arrows''.\nBy 2014, the band solidified into an 'original' line up of Gardner and 9 core members - Andrew Nyte, John Platter, Zawadi Morrow, Zach Walkingstick, Nadia Ifland Essenpreis, Lindsay Gardner, Julianne Smith, Blake Strickland and Jared Buck.\nAfter Beyond Control and The Beauty Between the band underwent a major transition, as most of the original band members -many of whom never intended to be professional musicians - could no longer commit to full-time membership. A new core lineup was formed in 2019 with Daniel Steele, Zach Boyd, John McNeill, JJ Kim and Beserat Tafesse. Zach Boyd left in 2025 after helping record ''Asaph's Arrows II. The door remains open for past band members to return; Platter, Morrow, and Nyte have returned often, and over a dozen new and old band members united for a 10th anniversary performance of Becoming Who We Are'' in 2024.\nBeyond this core, Brian Eichelberger and Zach Bolen of Citizens have extensive writing and performance credits on Kings Kaleidoscope songs; Eichelberger also mixes all the band's releases and performs live occasionally. Maxwell Gaver and Jess Alldredge have appeared on multiple albums, tours, and live recordings, and Ryan Ponten and Lauren McShane have credits on two albums each.\nOther significant collaborators include photographers Matthew Warren and Zac Schweit, who direct visuals for the band, Propaganda, and Andy Mineo.\nCurrent members\n* Chadwick \"Chad\" Gardner - lead vocals, guitar, keyboards, production, tambourine\n* Daniel Steele - drums, synth, programming, backing vocals\n* Beserat Tafesse - trombone, trumpet, euphonium, backing vocals\n* John McNeill - bass, synth, backing vocals\n* JJ Kim - guitar, bass, keys, backing vocals\nPast, part-time, and touring members\n* Zach Boyd (guitar, cello, sampler, mullet, backing vocals)\n* John Platter (drums, percussion, cello)\n* Andrew Nyte (drums, sampler)\n* Zawadi Morrow (piano, flute, violin)\n* Zack Walkingstick (bass)\n* Nadia Ifland Essenpreis (keys, violin)\n* Lindsay Gardner (cello, keys)\n* Julianne Smith (violin, accordion)\n* Blake Strickland (trombone)\n* Jared Buck (guitar)\n* Maxwell Gaver (keys, production)\n* Brian Eichelberger (violin, mixing)\n* Jess Alldredge (violin, drums)\n* Ethan Bieg (merch, melodica)\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions\n!
