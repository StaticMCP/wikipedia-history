The host of the awards ceremony was Sean Lau. The state-owned China Central Television did not air the program as it had previously for every year since 1991; this was because the film nominated for best picture in the awards, Ten Years, was seen to be critical of China's influence over Hong Kong. The Chinese government was reported to have ordered the state broadcaster not to broadcast the ceremony.\nAwards\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Andrew Choi and Ng Ka-Leung — Ten Years\n**Benny Chan, Alvin Lam  and Stanley Tong — Little Big Master\n**Huang Jianxin, Nansun Shi and Yu Dong   — The Taking of Tiger Mountain\n**Raymond Wong and Pang Yuk-Lam — Ip Man 3\n**Julia Chu — Port of Call\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Tsui Hark — The Taking of Tiger Mountain\n**Adrian Kwan — Little Big Master\n**Derek Yee — I Am Somebody\n**Wilson Yip — Ip Man 3\n**Philip Yung — Port of Call\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Philip Yung — Port of Call\n**Adrian Kwan and Hannah Chang — Little Big Master\n**Derek Yee — I Am Somebody\n**Saville Chan and Adam Wong  — She Remembers, He Forgets\n**Lau Ho-Leung — Two Thumbs Up\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Aaron Kwok — Port of Call\n**Andy Lau — Lost and Love\n**Nick Cheung — Keeper of Darkness\n**Tony Leung Ka Fai — The Taking of Tiger Mountain\n**Jacky Cheung — Heaven in the Dark\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Jessie Li — Port Of Call\n**Tang Wei — A Tale of Three Cities\n**Miriam Yeung — Little Big Master\n**Sylvia Chang — Office\n**Karena Lam — Heaven in the Dark\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Michael Ning — Port Of Call\n**Andrew Lam — Full Strike\n**Louis Cheung — Keeper of Darkness\n**Zhang Jin — SPL II: A Time for Consequences\n**Zhang Jin — Ip Man 3\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Elaine Jin — Port Of Call\n**Qin Hailu — A Tale of Three Cities\n**Anna Ng — Little Big Master\n**Janice Man — Helios\n**Angelica Lee — Murmur of the Hearts\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n*Michael Ning — Port Of Call\n**J.

Major mainland news websites, including Sina and Tencent, which covered the awards ceremony on 3 April 2 016 neglected to mention the winner of best picture, considered one of Asia's top film awards. In mainland Chinese cities where TVB, the main Hong Kong television channel, is aired, users on social media reported that the programme was blacked out and replaced with a cooking programme.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hkfaa.com Official website of the Hong Kong Film Awards]\n* [http://lib.hku.hk/av/hkfilmawards/2013/ Hong Kong Film Awards 2013 University of Hong Kong Library]"
