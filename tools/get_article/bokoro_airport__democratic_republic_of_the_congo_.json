The province of Mai-Ndombe is one of three regions the former province of Bandundu has been divided into.\nTrivia\nOfficially, Bokoro Airport does not have an ICAO-Code. However, the code FZBC is attributed to Bikoro Airport, allegedly serving the town of Bikoro. Bikoro never had an airport as various old maps and aeronautical charts confirm. It is instead served by the airfield of Yembe-Moke (FZEM) located 7 miles north-east of the town. Additionally, the third letter \"B\" in the code indicates that the airport is located the former province of Bandundu. Bikoro is located in the former province of Equateur. It is therefore assumed that FZBC is actually the ICAO code intended for Bokoro airport that has been wrongly assigned due to a spelling error.\nSee also\n*\n*\n* Transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* List of airports in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nReferences"
