The Ndwandwe hierarchy was set asunder by the battle, and largely scattered their population in response.\nHistory\nIn 1818, Shaka had been attacked by Qwabe warriors led by Phakathwayo along the same river.\nThe battle\nAs in the Battle of Gqokli Hill, Shaka's superior tactics led his people to victory. When the Ndwandwe attack came, he waited until about half were on each side of the river, effectively splitting the attackers into two separate groups which allowed a Zulu victory.\nSee also\n* Mhlatuze River\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of mhlatuze river\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Mhlatuze River"
