The parliament's principal goal was to join an independent state of Poland. On October 30, the Organisation officially declared its independence from Austria-Hungary and, two days later, made itself a \"National Council\". This was eventually disestablished on November 16 when the Polish Liquidation Committee took control of Galicia.\nThe Republic's only president was the Polish writer Stefan Żeromski.\nSee also\n* First Republic of Pińczów\n* Goralenvolk\n* Komańcza Republic\n* Lemko Republic\n* Republic of Gniew\n* Republic of Ostrów\n* Republic of Tarnobrzeg\nReferences"
