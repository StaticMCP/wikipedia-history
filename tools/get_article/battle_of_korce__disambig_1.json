The battle for Korytsa formed the first part of the operation against the Italians and marked the final stage of the Greek penetration in the Battle of Morava–Ivan heights sector.\nThe Italian 9th Army was entrenched around the town, but fierce fighting over two days led to the break-through of the Italian defensive line by the Greeks and its capture. Remnants of the 9th Army itself avoided capture, as the opposing Greek forces were poorly motorized and unable to pursue the retreating Italians.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010258/http://dis.army.gr/sites/dis.army.gr/files/unmanaged/pdf/Articles_June14/Vlachos/LIBERATION_KORYTSA.pdf Greek army article on the battle]"
