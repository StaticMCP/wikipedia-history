It is the oldest graveyard in the city and is a site on the Freedom Trail. The graveyard pre-dates the adjacent King's Chapel, whose first structure was built in 1688, and it is not affiliated with any church despite its name.\nHistory\nKing's Chapel Burying Ground was founded in 1630 as the first graveyard in the city of Boston. According to custom, the first interment was that of the land's owner, Isaac Johnson. It was Boston's only burial site for 30 years (1630–1660). The local Anglican congregation was allotted land in the graveyard to build King's Chapel in 1686, being unable to locate land elsewhere.\nToday there are 505 headstones and 59 footstones remaining from the more than one thousand people buried in the small space since its inception. There are also 78 tombs, of which 36 have markers. This includes the large vault, built as a charnel house and converted into a tomb for children's remains in 1833. The earliest tombs are scattered among the grave markers. Most are in tabletop form.\nNotable burials\n* Charles Apthorp, merchant, slave trader\n* Francis Brinley, American landowner, government official, philanthropist and military officer\n* Mary Chilton, Plymouth Pilgrim, first European woman to step ashore in New England\n* Captain Roger Clapp, member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, died February 2, 1691, formerly lived at Dorchester (Capt.
