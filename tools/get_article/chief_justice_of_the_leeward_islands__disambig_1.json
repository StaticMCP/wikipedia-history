Prior to 1871, when the Supreme Court was established, the individual islands had their own courts.\nIn 1939 the Windward and Leeward Islands Supreme Court and the Windward and Leeward Islands Court of Appeal were established, which was replaced in 1967 by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court which provides both functions.\nList of chief justices\nAntigua\n* 1706– Samuel Watkins\n* ?–1716 John Gamble\n* 1716–c.1742 Samuel Watkins\n* ?–1750 William Lavington\n* 1750– William Blizard\n* ?–1759 Richard Wilson\n* 1759–1762 Ralph Payne\n* c.1776 Thomas Jarvis\n* c.1792–1814 Rowland Burton\n* 1814–1822 James Athill\n* 1823–c.1833 Paul Daxon Horsford\n* c.1844–1847 Richard Weston Nanton\n* 1847–1856 Robert Marsh Horsford\n* 1856–>1863 Sir William Snagg (Antigua and Montserrat) (afterwards Chief Justice of British Guiana, 1868)\n* 1863–1864 Richard Weston Mara (acting)\nDominica\n* 1767–1773 Thomas Atwood (afterwards Chief Justice of the Bahamas)\n* 1773 James Ashley Hall (died in office)\n* 1773–1779 Thomas Wilson\n* 1789–1805 John Matson\n* 1806 John Burrows\n* 1812–c.1825 Archibald Gloster\n* 1827–1828 John O'Driscoll\n* 1828–1833 Robert Sympson Jameson\n* c.1844 Henry John Glanville\n* 1849–?
