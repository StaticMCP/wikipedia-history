It is located alongside Aviation Boulevard above its intersection with Century Boulevard, located in the Westchester neighborhood of Los Angeles.\nConstruction on the station was completed with the rest of the initial line in late 2022, but its opening was delayed to November 3, 2024 due to construction on the LAX Automated People Mover and the LAX/Metro Transit Center. Aviation/Century is the second-newest station in the Los Angeles Metro Rail system after LAX/Metro Transit Center, which opened on June 6, 2025.\nThe Santa Fe's Century railroad bridge was demolished on July 25, 2014, to make way for the station.\nService\nHours and frequency\nConnections\n, the following connections are available:\n* Beach Cities Transit: 109\n* GTrans (Gardena): 5\n* Los Angeles Metro Bus:  , , ,\n* Metro Micro: LAX/Inglewood Zone\n* Torrance Transit: 8\nStation artwork\nThe station incorporates artwork by the artist Sherin Guirguis, an Egyptian artist known for her work exploring cultural identity and lost feminist histories.
