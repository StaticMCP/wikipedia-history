In January 2003 he rode  on a specially designed \"ice bike\" around the Patriot Hills.\nIn 2012, Helen Skelton became the first person to reach the South Pole using a bicycle. The bike was custom built for her trip with 8-inch-wide (20&nbsp;cm) tires. She also used skis and a kite to help her pull a sled containing  of supplies. She covered  by kite ski,  by bike and  by cross-country ski. Some of Skelton's claims have been challenged.\nIn December 2012, Eric Larsen made the first attempt to undertake an expedition solely by bicycle to the South Pole. After covering , a quarter of the distance to the South Pole, Larsen abandoned his attempt and cycled an additional  back to Patriot Hills.\nOn 27 December 2013, Maria Leijerstam became the first person to cycle from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole. Her journey commenced from near McMurdo Station on the Ross Ice Shelf and accessed the Polar Plateau via the Leverett Glacier. Maria also established the human-powered speed record of 10 days, 14 hours, and 56 minutes\nJuan Menéndez Granados, calling himself \"Juan Sin Miedo\", started his bicycle and ski expedition at Hercules Inlet in December 2013 and finished on January 17, 2014. He traveled the full distance without being resupplied, surviving the last 4 days of the expedition drinking chocolate powder and sunflower oil. When it was not possible to progress by cycling, he used skis to make progress. He became the first person to cycle to the South Pole solo, unsupported and unassisted.\nDaniel Burton attempted a solo cycling expedition to the South Pole later in 2014, although there were four caches of food staged along the route, as well as an equipment cache. Burton traveled the full distance pedaling or pushing his bike (without skis such as Menéndez used). His effort took 5 days longer than Menéndez'.\nIn 2026-17, Keith Tuffley became the first person to cycle a new route to the South Pole. He cycled from the coast of Antarctica on the Ross Ice Shelf to the top of the Reedy Glacier and through the Trans-Antarctic Mountains - this was first ever traverse of the Reedy Glacier. For the first 21 days of the expedition (distance of 377km, to an altitude of 2,846m), 81% of the distance was completed on the bike and 19% on skis. For the remaining 13 days (244km) to the South Pole, the majority was on skis. In total, he traveled 621km, 51% of which was completed by bike (315km), 49% on skis. The expedition was unsupported and unassisted (no food drops, no access to a compacted ice road or to vehicle tracks). He completed the expedition together with polar guide Eric Phillips and Robert Smith who were both on skis.\nOmar Di Felice attempted a solo cycling expedition to the South Pole first in November 2022 but it was forced to come back home after a week due to family problem. After winning the Trans Am Bike Race in June 2023, he decided to come back trying to reach the South Pole starting from Hercules Inlet in November 2023. He started on November 20th and after 48 days of riding he was forced to stop and cycle back to be picked up in Thiels Corner (85°05' South on the Hercules Inlet - South Pole track). His attempt called \"Antarctica Unlimited\" is also part of the project \"Bike to 1.5°C\" to raise awareness on climate change. The distance he covered is the second longest ever cycled in Antarctica\nReferences"
