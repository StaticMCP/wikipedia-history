In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a \"nationally important\" archaeological site or historic building that has been given protection against unauthorised change by being placed on a list (or \"schedule\") by the Secretary of State for Digital Culture, Media and Sport; Historic England recommends sites for scheduling to the Secretary of State. Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. There are nearly 20,000 entries on the schedule, which is maintained by Historic England as part of the National Heritage List for England; more than one site can be included in a single entry. While a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, Historic England's aim is to set the most appropriate form of protection in place for the building or site. Applications to deschedule a site are administered Historic England, who will carry out an assessment and make a recommendation to the Secretary of State.\nThe metropolitan county of Greater Manchester is composed of 10 metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan. Rochdale has no scheduled monuments; those in the other boroughs are listed separately. They range from prehistoric structures&nbsp;– the oldest of which date from the Bronze Age&nbsp;– to more modern structures such as the Astley Green Colliery, from 1908. Greater Manchester has seven prehistoric monuments (i.e. Bronze or Iron Age), found in Bury, Oldham, Salford, Stockport, and Tameside. The Bronze Age sites are mainly cairns and barrows, and both the Iron Age sites are military in nature, promontory forts.\nThe trend of military sites continues from the Iron Age into the Roman period; two Roman forts in Greater Manchester are scheduled monuments and were the two main areas of Roman activity in the county. Of the nine castles in Greater Manchester, four are scheduled monuments: Buckton Castle, Watch Hill Castle, Bury Castle, and Radcliffe Tower. The last two are fortified manor houses, and although defined as castles were not exclusively military in nature; they probably acted as the administrative centre of the manors they were in. There are several other manor houses and country houses&nbsp;&ndash; some with moats&nbsp;&ndash; in the county that are protected as scheduled monuments. The Astley Green Colliery, the Marple Aqueduct, Oldknows Limekilns, and the Worsley Delph are scheduled relics of Greater Manchester's industrial history.\n{|style=\"width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|\nBolton\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"10%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Remains\n! width=\"10%\"| Date\n! width=\"10%\"| Location\n! width=\"55%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n| Round cairn(nr. Old Harper’s Farm)\n|Cairn\n| Bronze Age\n| Horwich\n| On the eastern slope of Adam Hill, in the Winter Hill massif, a round cairn on a local high point 280m west of Old Harpers Farm. It is a slightly oval mound of stones, covered with turf approximately 12 m by 11.5m and standing 0.4m high. The cairn is unexcavated and retains undisturbed deposits of archaeological value.\n|\n|-\n| Smithills Hall\n| Standing building\n| 0114th century\n| Bolton\n| Smithills Hall was originally built in the early 14th century, but was extended in the 15th and 16th centuries. The oldest surviving part is the great hall, which dates from the early 15th century. The site was originally moated, however no trace of the moat survives. Smithills Hall is now a Grade I listed building and open to the public as a museum.\n|\n|-\n| Ringley Old Bridge\n| Stone bridge\n| 021677\n| Stoneclough, Kearsley\n| The current bridge over the River Irwell was built in 1677 to replace one washed away in 1673. It is still used today, having been pedestrianised, and is a Grade II* listed building.\n|\n|}\nBury\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"10%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Remains\n! width=\"10%\"| Date\n! width=\"10%\"| Location\n! width=\"55%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n| Castlesteads\n| Earthworks\n| 00200&nbsp;BC&ndash;250&nbsp;AD\n| Bury\n| Castlesteads is a promontory fort on the banks of the River Irwell. The site is defended by a  long and  wide ditch, and a silted up channel of the river. The interior is triangular shaped. Pottery finds indicate the site was occupied from 200&nbsp;BC to 250&nbsp;AD.\n|\n|-\n| Radcliffe Tower\n| Ruins\n| 011403\n| Radcliffe\n| Radcliffe Tower is the only part of a medieval manor house that belonged to James de Radliffe, the Lord of the Manor of Radcliffe, still standing. It was a stone-built hall with two towers, and was surrounded by a moat. The site was fortified with the addition of crenellations and battlements with permission from the king. The manor house was demolished in the 19th century. The tower is now a Grade I listed building.\n|\n|-\n| Bury Castle\n| Below ground remains\n| 031469\n| Bury\n| Bury Castle is a manor house built in 1469, replacing an earlier building on the same site from the late 14th century. It was built by Sir Thomas Pilkington, Lord of the Manors of Bury and Pilkington, and fortified with permission of the king; it was razed to the ground when Sir Thomas had his lands confiscated for supporting the losing side in the War of the Roses. Some of the castle remains have been excavated and are on display to the public.\n|\n|-\n| Affetside Cross\n| Stone pillar\n| 0417th or 18th century\n| Affetside\n| The pillar was originally a cross and replaced a medieval waymarker in the 17th or 18th century. The pillar stands on three circular steps, which probably date from 1890 when the cross was taken down for repairs and re-erected.\n|\n|}\nManchester\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"10%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Remains\n! width=\"10%\"| Date\n! width=\"10%\"| Location\n! width=\"55%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n| Mamucium\n| Below ground remains\n| 0079\n| Castlefield, Manchester\n| A Roman fort was established on a sandstone bluff near a crossing over the River Medlock, along the line of the Roman road between Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum); it was designed to garrison a cohort of 500&nbsp;auxiliary soldiers. A civilian settlement (vicus) of traders and families grew up around the fort. In around 140, the fort was demolished and the civilian settlement was abandoned around the same time. The fort was rebuilt in 160 and the settlement was re-inhabited. It was abandoned by the mid-3rd century, although the fort was in use into the early 4th century. A partial reconstruction of the fort on the site is open to the public.\n|\n|-\n| Nico Ditch\n| Earthwork\n| 017th&ndash;9th centuries\n| Ashton-under-Lyne and Denton\n| Nico Ditch is an earthwork stretching from Ashton Moss in the east to Hough Moss in the west. According to legend, the ditch was dug in a single night as a defence against Viking invaders in 869&ndash;870. However, the U-shaped profile of the ditch indicates it was not defensive as it would most likely be V-shaped. It was probably used as an administrative boundary. The ditch is visible in sections, and in places is about  deep and up to  wide.\n|\n|-\n| Baguley Hall\n| Standing building\n| 0214th century\n| Baguley\n| The original building was possibly from the 11th or 12th century, but the current timber-framed house dates from the 14th century. The medieval north wing was refaced in brick. In the 18th century the brick south wing was added. Baguley Hall is considered one of the \"finest surviving medieval halls in the northwest of England\". It is a Grade I listed building, and is on the Buildings at Risk Register; its condition is rated as \"fair\" and it is owned by English Heritage.\n|\n|-\n| Peel Hall\n| Waterlogged moat\n| 0314th century\n| Ashton New Road, Manchester\n| In the mid-14th century, Sir John de Arderne built Peel Hall. The site is surrounded by a moat which is between  wide and  deep. Peel Hall was demolished in 1809 and replaced by a farmhouse on the same site, which was demolished in 1975.\n|\n|-\n| Hanging Bridge\n| Ruins\n| 051421\n| Cateaton Street, Manchester\n| The current structure was built in 1421; however the first reference to the bridge was in 1343. The bridge, which is  long and  wide, spanned Hanging Ditch and was part of medieval Manchester's defences. Hanging Bridge was probably obscured by housing in the 1770s as a result of Manchester's expansion. It was uncovered in the 1880s, and again in the late 20th century, and is now on display in Manchester Cathedral's visitor centre.\n|\n|-\n| Clayton Hall\n| Standing building\n| 0415th century\n| Clayton\n| The hall, which probably dates back to the 15th century, was probably originally either a quadrangle or consisted of three wings. Much of the hall was demolished in the 17th century and replaced by a new house. Clayton Hall underwent further changes and restoration in the 18th century and in 1900. The hall is on a rectangular island surrounded by a moat and is a Grade II* listed building.\n|\n|}\nOldham\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"10%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Remains\n! width=\"10%\"| Date\n! width=\"10%\"| Location\n! width=\"55%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n| Saddleworth Bowl Barrow\n| Earthworks\n| 00Bronze Age\n| Saddleworth\n| The barrow is oval shaped and measures  by  and is  tall. The barrow has been excavated archaeologically, but has not revealed any signs of grave good or human remains. The site is in good condition.\n|\n|-\n| Castleshaw Roman fort\n| Below ground remains\n| 0179\n| Castleshaw, Saddleworth\n| In 79, a fort was established at Castleshaw by the Romans, for a garrison of 500&nbsp;auxiliary soldiers, as part of the frontier defences along the road between Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum). It was slighted in 90, but a smaller fort&nbsp;&ndash; or fortlet&nbsp;&ndash; was built on the site in 105, designed for a garrison of less than 100. A civilian settlement (vicus), made up of traders and hangers on of the soldiers, grew around the fort in the 2nd century. The fortlet was abandoned in the mid-120s when it was superseded by the neighbouring forts at Manchester and Slack. About the same time, the civilian settlement was abandoned. A series of ditches and earthworks was built to mark the site.\n|\n|}\nSalford\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"10%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Remains\n! width=\"10%\"| Date\n! width=\"10%\"| Location\n! width=\"55%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n| Iron Age promontory fort\n| Below ground remains\n| 00500BC&ndash;200AD\n| Salford\n| The promontory fort is surrounded by two ditches. Inside the fort are four circular structures that are probably industrial areas and livestock enclosures. The Cheshire Very Coarse Pottery (VCP) found on the site is the only evidence of a late prehistoric pottery industry in Greater Manchester.\n|\n|-\n| Worsley Delph\n| Brick structure\n| 011759\n| Swinton\n| In 1759, construction began on a system of underground canals; they provided a route between Worsley Colliery and the Bridgewater Canal for the coal the colliery produced. The canals were used for this purpose until 1887 and closed shortly after the last coal pit in the area in 1968.\n|\n|}\nStockport\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"10%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Remains\n! width=\"10%\"| Date\n! width=\"10%\"| Location\n! width=\"55%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n| Brown Low\n| Earthworks\n| 00Bronze Age\n| Ludworth, Hazel Grove\n| Brown Low is a bowl barrow,  in diameter and  tall. The site is covered in turf, and two hollows on the barrow are from an 1809 excavation.\n|\n|-\n| Cairn\n| Mound of stones\n| 01Bronze Age\n| Ludworth, Hazel Grove\n| The late Bronze Age cairn is  in diameter and  tall. There is a series of chambers and cremation cists. Due to its position on a knoll on Mellor Moor, it is highly visible.\n|\n|-\n| Peel Moat\n| Dry moat\n| 02Medieval\n| Heaton Moor, Stockport\n| The dried-up, rectangular moat surrounds the site of a square-shaped fortified tower. There are no above ground remains of the tower, but it was situated on an area of land  square, with the surrounding moat measuring between  and  wide.\n|\n|-\n| Torkington Moat\n| Water-logged moat\n| 03Medieval\n| Torkington, Stockport\n| The moat in Torkington surrounds the site of the manor house that was first built in 1350. The  deep moat is between  wide, and forms the perimeter of a  by  island. Torkington Hall replaced the medieval manor house in the early 17th century.\n|\n|-\n| Oldknows Limekilns\n| Lime kilns\n| 041797\n| Marple\n| Between 1797 and 1800, Samuel Oldknow built three lime kilns on the east side of the Peak Forest Canal. The kilns are  deep and were built into the hillside. The site operated into the 20th century, and the remaining walling of the kilns is protected as a Grade II listed building.\n|\n|-\n| Marple Aqueduct\n| Aqueduct\n| 051801\n| Marple\n| The Marple Aqueduct was built between 1794 and 1801 to carry the Peak Forest Canal over the River Goyt. The aqueduct is still in use for pleasure craft.\n|\n|}\nTameside\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"10%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Remains\n! width=\"10%\"| Date\n! width=\"10%\"| Location\n! width=\"55%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n| Cairn\n| Mound of stones\n| 00Bronze Age\n| Stalybridge\n| The turf covered round cairn is situated on top of a hill, and consists of a mound of stones with a flat top.

The site has been altered in modern period by the addition of a dry stone wall and a trigonometrical pillar.\n|\n|-\n| Buckton Castle\n| Below ground remains\n| 011180s\n| Carrbrook\n| Buckton Castle is an enclosure castle probably built by the earls of Chester in the 12th century. It may have been constructed to guard the Longdendale Valley. The castle was first referred to in 1360, when it was in a ruinous state. The castle is circular, measuring  and  along the axes, and is surrounded by a  wide and  deep ditch. Buckton Castle has been damaged by 18th-century treasure hunters and later 19th and 20th-century quarrying.\n|\n|}\nTrafford\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! width=\"10%\"| Name\n! width=\"10%\"| Remains\n! width=\"10%\"| Date\n! width=\"10%\"| Location\n! width=\"55%\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s)\n|-\n| Watch Hill Castle\n| Earthworks\n| 12th century (probably)\n| Bowdon\n| The castle is a motte-and-bailey, consisting of a conical mound (motte)  in diameter and  tall, surrounded by a triangular lower enclosure (bailey) covering .

The moat is filled with water, however the ruined farmhouse is not part of the scheduled monument.\n|\n|-\n| Winstanley Hall\n| Standing building\n| h1560s\n| Winstanley\n| Winstanley hall was built in the 1560s for the Winstanley family of Wigan, who were Lords of the Manor. It is linked with the neighbouring halls of Bispham Hall (built in 1573), Birchley Hall (1594), and Hacking Hall (1607). Winstanley Hall was extended in the 17th and 18th centuries, and further work was done in the 19th century including work by architect Lewis Wyatt in the Jacobean style.
