These included six sculptures of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first prime minister of Canada, three of other figures connected to the Canadian Indian residential school system (Alexander Wood, Egerton Ryerson and Joseph Hugonard), two of Canadian monarchs (Queen Victoria and Elizabeth II), one of the British explorer Captain James Cook and one of John Deighton (\"Gassy Jack\"), a bar-owner whose nickname inspired the name of Vancouver's Gastown district.\nThe initial protests in 2020 occurred in the context of the worldwide George Floyd protests, which resulted in the widespread removal of monuments and memorials in the United States and other countries connected to systemic racism. In Canada, the 2021 discovery of possible unmarked graves at former residential schools added to the conversation about systemic racism and the appropriateness of certain monuments.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Monument/memorial\n!
