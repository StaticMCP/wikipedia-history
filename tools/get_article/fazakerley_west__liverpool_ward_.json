The Fazakerley West ward was created as a single-member ward from the western quarter of the former Fazakerley ward and a small portion of the former Norris Green ward. The ward boundaries follow Longmoor Lane, Higher Lane, the Kirkby branch of the Northern Line, Longmoor Lane, Lower Lane, the East Lancashire Road, Stopgate Lane, and Lone Lane.}}\n§Paul Brant was a re-standing councillor for Fazakerley ward.\nReferences"
