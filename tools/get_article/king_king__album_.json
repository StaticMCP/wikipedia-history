It was recorded live at King King Club in Los Angeles during three or four of their regular Monday-night performances in 1991.\nThe album captures the immediacy and informality of a small club performance.  It features the band's interpretation of blues songs originally recorded by Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Howlin' Wolf, and Willie Dixon as well as some band originals. King King was produced by Rick Rubin.\nCritical reception\n}}\nKing King was released in July 1992 and a review in USA Today called it \"the year's most electrifying live album, a stunning debut\".  According to the Los Angeles Times, \"King King is a 12-song live recording that captures the band in fine, aggressive form at the La Brea Avenue club\". The Baltimore Sun noted that \"the group avoids the sort of overplaying that usually undoes white blues bands, leaving the sound lean, mean and utterly believable.\" The Toronto Star called the album \"a heap of unremarkable originals and tepid blues covers, recorded live in such poor quality, an audience member holding a cassette recorder couldn't have done worse.\"\nAllMusic's gave the album a three out of five star rating, calling it a mix of straight-ahead blues and singer/harmonica player Lester Butler's later alternative rock.\nTrack listing\nSonny Boy Williamson II\n| length5 = 4:28\n| title6 = Tail Dragger\n| writer6 = Dixon\n| length6 = 5:24\n| title7 = Devil Woman\n| writer7 = The Red Devils\n| length7 = 6:57\n| title8 = No Fightin'\n| writer8 = Butler\n| length8 = 5:56\n| title9 = Mr. Highway Man\n| writer9 = Chester Burnett  Howlin' Wolf\n| length9 = 3:35\n| title10 = I'm Ready\n| writer10 = Dixon\n| length10 = 3:46\n| title11 = Quarter to Twelve\n| writer11 = Marion Jacobs  Little Walter\n| length11 = 7:03\n| title12 = Cut That Out\n| writer12 = Junior Wells\n| length12 = 4:59\n}}\nPersonnel\n;The Red Devils\n*Lester Butler &ndash; vocals, harmonica\n*Paul \"The Kid\" Size &ndash; lead guitar\n*Dave Lee Bartel &ndash; rhythm guitar\n*Johnny Ray Bartel &ndash; bass\n*Bill Bateman &ndash; drums\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://nofightin.com/ No Fightin': The Red Devils, Lester Butler and California blues, rock and roots music]\n*"
