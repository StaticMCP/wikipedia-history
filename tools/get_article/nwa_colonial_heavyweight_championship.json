It was first won by Gino Martino, who was awarded the title after winning the annual Tony Rumble Memorial Battle Royal in Bellingham, Massachusetts on November 20, 2004. The title was co-promoted with a local promotion, New World Wrestling, and defended in both promotions during an eight-month period before being merged with the NWW Heavyweight Championship in August 2005.\nTitle history\nSilver areas in the history indicate periods of unknown lineage.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n!width=25%|Wrestler:\n!width=5% |Times:\n!width=15%|Date:\n!width=18%|Location:\n!width=32%|Notes:\n|-\n|colspan=5 style=\"background: #ccddcc;\" align=center|NWA New England Championship\n|-\n|Gino Martino\n|1\n|November 20, 2004\n|Bellingham, Massachusetts\n|\n|-\n|-style=\"background: #f2f2f2;\"\n|colspan=\"5\" align=center|Title is vacated on February 4, 2005, after Gino Martino wins the NWA New England Heavyweight Championship.\n|-\n|Dan Bidondi\n|1\n|February 5, 2005\n|Bellingham, Massachusetts\n|\n|-\n|-style=\"background: #f2f2f2;\"\n|colspan=\"5\" align=center|Title is awarded to NWW Heavyweight Champion Beau Douglas when Bidondi failed to make a scheduled title defence at the Summer Blackout supercard in Attleboro, Massachusetts on August 20, 2005.
