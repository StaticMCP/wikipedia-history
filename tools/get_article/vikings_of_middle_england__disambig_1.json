They portray through historical costume and activities the people who lived, travelled to, and invaded Britain in the Viking-Age. Tÿrslið aims to entertain and educate its audience through a mix of drama, pageantry, special effects, historical context, demonstrations, and audience participation. Tÿrslið are one of the few groups to display Icelandic Horses in a Viking-Age presentation, with horses and riders from Oakfield Icelandic Horses joining them at events. As well as arena displays, Vikings of Middle England erect a Living History encampment where members demonstrate Viking-age crafts such as blacksmithing or where the audience can have a go at certain activities such as coin-striking. The organisation once owned a scale replica Longship called Ratatosk.\nVikings of Middle England perform at events throughout the UK, including at places of historical interest such as Rockingham Castle, carnivals, festivals and local events, and also at other visitor attractions such as Conkers.

Their reputation can only be enhanced by this performance. This was staggeringly good entertainment.'\n*Jonathon Davies summarising in Skirmish Magazine in 2010 said 'A number of points impressed me over the weekend. The first is how privileged we are to have and to work at such a beautiful site, and with a public that was both numerous and highly appreciative. Next is the variety of presentation styles represented by the different groups, which complemented each other over the weekend. There were the fighting groups that put on a tremendous show for the public in the arena, there were the re-enactors who acted with enthusiasm and wit and then there were the specialists; highly knowledge-able about the period and with the ability to communicate their passion and understanding.'\n* The group was reviewed and included in the 'Top Ten Re-Enactments for Family' by BBC CountryFile Magazine.\nReferences\nSee also\n* List of historical reenactment groups"
