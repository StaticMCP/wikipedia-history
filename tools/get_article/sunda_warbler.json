It is found only in Indonesia.\nThe Sunda warbler was previously placed in the genus Seicercus. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018 found that neither Phylloscopus nor Seicercus were monophyletic. In the subsequent reorganization the two genera were merged into Phylloscopus which has priority under the rules of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Sunda Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Sunda warbler\n}}"
