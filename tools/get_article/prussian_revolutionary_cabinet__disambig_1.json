It was based on a coalition of Majority Social Democrats (MSPD) and Independent Social Democrats (USPD), as was the Council of the People's Deputies, which was formed at the Reich level. The Prussian cabinet was revolutionary because it was not formed on the basis of the previous Prussian constitution of 1848/1850.\nThe cabinet was led by Paul Hirsch of the MSPD. One MSPD and one USPD man were assigned to each department. The USPD members left the cabinet on 4 January 1919. It was replaced by a new cabinet after the Prussian State Assembly was elected on 26 January 1919.\nHistory\nThe Kingdom of Prussia was by far the most important member state in the monarchical German Empire and remained so after the German revolution of 1918–1919. Prussia and the German Empire were linked to each other in many ways: the German Chancellor was also the Prussian Prime Minister, and many state secretaries were Prussian ministers. Prussia was also the dominant power in the German Bundesrat, the body representing the German states.\nOn 9 November 1918, the last Imperial Chancellor, Max von Baden, announced prematurely that William II, Germany's Emperor and King, had abdicated. Max unconstitutionally transferred the office of German Chancellor to Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the Majority Social Democrats. On 10 November, Ebert formed the Council of the People's Deputies () as a revolutionary transitional body at the federal level and became one of two chairmen of the council.\nSince Max von Baden was not Prussian Prime Minister, he was unable to give Ebert the premiership at the same time. The majority of the Prussian State Ministry wanted to resign on 8 November, but after his abdication was declared the next day, the King could no longer accept their resignations. The Prussian cabinet therefore remained in office, as did the state secretaries at the federal level.\nOn 9 November, Reich Chancellor Ebert instructed the leader of the MSPD in Prussia Paul Hirsch to ensure peace and order. The Prussian Interior Minister Bill Drews confirmed the instruction with his own power of attorney to Hirsch. According to historian Ernst Rudolf Huber, Hirsch briefly became \"Federal and Prussian State Commissioner\".\nCabinet members\n| minister1_party             = SPD\n| minister1_termstart         = 14 November 1918\n| minister1_termend           = 25 March 1919\n| minister2                   = Hugo Simon\n| minister2_party             = USPD\n| minister2_termstart         = 14 November 1918\n| minister2_termend           = 4 January 1919\n}}\n| minister1_termend           = 2 January 1919\n| minister2                   = Walther Reinhardt\n| minister2_party             = N/A\n| minister2_termstart         = 3 January 1919\n| minister2_termend           = 25 March 1919\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n*Prussian State Ministry\nNotes\nReferences"
