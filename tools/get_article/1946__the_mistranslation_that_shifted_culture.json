The film says that for the creation of this Revised Standard Version (RSV), two rare and poorly-understood Greek words&mdash; and , which respectively refer to abusive behaviors and exploitative relationships&mdash;were mistranslated to encompass consenting same-sex relationships.  The word homosexual is alleged to have been used to instead reflect contemporary biases instead of history or linguistics.  It was the first time it appeared in any translation of the Bible.\nThe film has interviews with biblical scholars, linguists, religious leaders, theologians, and David Fearon: a man who had successfully challenged the translation as a seminary student in 1959, but was told by scholars then that while it was possibly inaccurate, \"the damage had already been done.\"  The RSV became widely adopted across the United States, influencing culture, public policy, and theology.  Further translations, such as the 1970s' New International Version, kept using homosexual, with \"damning effect\".\nProduction\nFilmmaker Sharon \"Rocky\" Roggio was a homosexual Christian.  Her father was a pastor whose belief in biblical literalism led him to estrange his daughter from her family when she was forceably outed.  She met Baldock at a Hollywood United Methodist Church seminar where she learned of their research into the RSV mistranslation and met Fearon.  Roggio was inspired to make 1946 to \"encourage more conversation and help stop the weaponization of God and scripture and free the LGBTQ+ community from religious oppression.\"  Roggio's father features prominently in the film.\nThe 92-minute, crowdfunded, documentary film was produced in the United States and directed by Roggio.  She and Jena Serbu produced the film, with Serbu and Jill Woodward serving as screenwriters.  Mary Lambert composed the original music for the film.  Cinematography was done by Tyler Eichorst, Collier Landry, and Samuel Emerson Morgan.  Jill Woodward served as editor.\nACOWSAY, Quest for Biblical Truth, Sweetbreadstudios, and ZUM Communications were the production companies for 1946, while ACOWSAY distributed it.\nRelease\n1946: The Mistranslation That Shifted Culture premiered in 2022 at Doc NYC, where it won the audience award.  With over  raised at GoFundMe, 1946 began a limited theatrical release on December 1, 2023.\nReception\nIn January 2023, Screen Daily Nikki Baughan spoke well of 1946, calling it a fascinating documentary that has potential to reach audiences outside of the Christian faithful and LGBTQ community&mdash;however unlikely it is to change the minds of the Christian right.  By that December, the film had won 23 festival awards.  In mid-2024, while referring to one such in Tacoma, Washington, Roggio told The News Tribune that selling out screenings of 1946 was typical.\nPrior to its premiere, Roggio said that her documentary received significant criticism from conservative media trying to debunk its claims, sometimes without having seen the film.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*"
