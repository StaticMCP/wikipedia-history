H. Donaldson (1864–1925), the founder of The Billboard (now Billboard) magazine.\nCategories included \"best new play\", \"best new musical\", \"best performance\", \"best debut\" and \"best costumes and set design\". The winners were chosen by votes of the theatre community at large with no predetermined nominees and the winners were presented with a gold key and a scroll.\nAccording to an article in Billboard, \"The Donaldson Awards are the stages' accolades to their own.\"\nThe awards were discontinued in 1955 having been overshadowed by the Antoinette Perry Awards (Tony Awards).\nList of winners\n(Note: on occasion a single performance won in multiple categories, such as Nanette Fabray winning as both actress and supporting actress for High Button Shoes.)\nPlays\nPlay\n* The Voice of the Turtle (1943–44)\n* The Glass Menagerie (1944–45)\n* State of the Union (1945–46)\n* All My Sons (1946–47)\n* A Streetcar Named Desire (1947–48)\n* Death of a Salesman (1948–49)\n* The Member of the Wedding (1949–50)\n* Darkness at Noon (1950–51)\n* The Shrike (1951–52)\n* Picnic and The Crucible (1952–53)\n* The Teahouse of the August Moon (1953–54)\n* Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1954–55)\nFirst Play\n* Born Yesterday (1945–46)\n* No Exit (1946–47)\n* Mister Roberts (1947–48)\n* Edward, My Son (1948–49)\n* The Member of the Wedding (1949–50)\n* Billy Budd (1950–51)\n* The Shrike (1951–52)\n* The Love of Four Colonels (1952–53)\n* Tea and Sympathy (1953–54)\n* Inherit the Wind (1954–55)\nDirector (play)\n* Moss Hart, Winged Victory (1943–44)\n* John Van Druten, I Remember Mama (1944–45)\n* Garson Kanin, Born Yesterday (1945–46)\n* Elia Kazan, All My Sons (1946–47)\n* Elia Kazan, A Streetcar Named Desire (1947–48)\n* Elia Kazan, Death of a Salesman (1948–49)\n* Harold Clurman, The Member of the Wedding (1949–50)\n* Daniel Mann, The Rose Tattoo (1950–51)\n* José Ferrer, The Shrike (1951–52)\n* Joshua Logan, Picnic (1952–53)\n* Elia Kazan, Tea and Sympathy (1953–54)\n* Elia Kazan, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1954–55)\nActor (play)\n* Paul Robeson, Othello (1943–44)\n* Frank Fay, Harvey (1944–45)\n* Louis Calhern, The Magnificent Yankee (1945–46)\n* Laurence Olivier, Oedipus Rex (1946–47)\n* Paul Kelly, Command Decision (1947–48)\n* Lee J.
