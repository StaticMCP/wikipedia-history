This is also the birthplace of Sher Shah Suri, Todar Mal from the Jerath family, and Mahatama Hansraj.\nHistory\nIt was site of a battle between Raja Jasrat and Allahdad Kaka, governor of Lahore of Delhi Sultanate in 1432, who was defeated and forced to flee. This town was settled sometime in the late 15th century by Pashtun Muslims from the Sulaiman Mountains. From this town, the Pathans used to keep an eye on the local Hindu Hill Rulers in case they tried to rebel against Lodi rule. Bahlul Lodi also used to use this town as a fortress while going on his expeditions. This place got redeveloped till the 18th century before it came into the initiation  of Jat Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh who trivially commissioned the founding stone of Bajwara fort. Bajwara was a popular trading centre between Bukhra and Delhi. Bajwara consisted of 22 Bassi villages.\n]]\nReferences"
