He chose the name \"Holland\", after the most important province, as \"Hollande\" was much used in France as a name for the Netherlands.\nThe statute described the royal arms and mentioned a royal crown. On 20 May 1807 a precise drawing of the royal coat of arms was approved by the king. The crown was topped with an orb with a cross.\nIn practice crowns without a cross became part of the crosses of Louis' Order of Knighthood, the Order of the Union, and the new coins. The second coat of arms, approved on 6 February 1806, showed no cross.\nAs the country was ruined by the Napoleonic Wars and the resulting lack of trade there was no opportunity for a coronation. The crown existed on paper alone until the French annexed the country in 1810. In 1813 the Dutch \"chose\" a new sovereign ruler, later king, William I who had a new crown, the crown of the Netherlands designed and wrought in gilded silver.\nSee also\n*Circlet\n*Coronet\n*Diadem\n*Helmet\n*Tiara\n*Papal tiara\n*Crown jewels\n*List of royal crowns\nReferences\n* Hubert de Vries, \"Wapens van de Nederlanden\", Amsterdam 1995"
