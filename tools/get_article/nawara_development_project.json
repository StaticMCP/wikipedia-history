The project, situated in the south of Tunisia, focuses on extracting and processing natural gas from the Nawara gas field, a key resource.\nHistory\nThe Nawara Development Project's history is marked by milestones in exploration, discovery, and infrastructure development:\n* 2003: The Jenein Sud exploration permit was granted to Tunisia's state-owned ETAP and Austria's OMV Group, with OMV assuming the exploration costs and risks.\n* 2006: The Nawara gas and condensate field was discovered, marking a major achievement for Tunisia's hydrocarbon sector.\n* 2008-2010: Drilling campaigns resulted in eight additional successful wells, further confirming the field's potential.\n* 2010: The Ministry of Industry officially granted the concession for the Nawara field, equally shared between ETAP and OMV.\n* 2012-2013: After negotiations with the Tunisian government over a proposed pipeline route change to Tataouine, the original plan was reinstated to ensure project viability.\n* 2014: The government committed to local development initiatives, including a spur pipeline to Tataouine, a gas treatment plant, and an LPG bottling unit to boost regional economic activity.\n* 2019: The Field was expected to be operational.\n* 2020: The project was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n* 2021: British engineers were brought in to work remotely on \"technical intervention\", while Tunisia agreed to continue to import petroleum products from Algeria.\nObjectives\nThe Nawara Development Project has the following objectives:\n* To increase Tunisia’s natural gas production and reduce dependency on imported energy.\n* To stimulate industrial and economic activity in the region, particularly in southern Tunisia.\n* To generate employment opportunities through construction, operation, and ancillary industries.\n* To build an energy infrastructure network, including extraction, processing, and transportation.\nFacilities\n* The Central Processing Facility, at the field site, it processes raw gas before transportation.\n* A 370 km pipeline connects the CPF to the Gas Treatment Plant in Gabès.\n* Located in Gabès, a gas treatment plant processes natural gas into market-ready products, including LPG.\n* Infrastructure such as the Tataouine spur pipeline and LPG bottling units are local development projects.\nSee also\n* Energy law\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.etap.com.tn/ ETAP Official Website]\n* [https://www.omv.com/ OMV Group Nawara Project Page]\n* [https://www.tunisia.gov.tn/ Tunisia Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Mines]\n*[http://www.omv.tn/portal/01/tn/omv-tn/omv-en-tunisie/activites/le-projet-de-developpement-de-nawara/!ut/p/b1/04_SjzQ0MzMxNjc3MzXSj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Q9OKwKJRZnFmxtYmhgZGxhZ-huZmBo4mjg5m7sEmhkZmJnr-3nk56bq50YGKgIA38f5zw!!/dl4/d5/L0lJSklrQSEhL3dMTUFKa0FFak1nIS80SmtHUW9RNFFBISEvWjZfNzA5NDIzMDI5OERFMTBBS01KTEIxVDIwSjYvWjdfNzA5NDIzMDI5R0tKQzBBNFJITUpDQTEwMjYvSG9tZQ!!/ OMV Tunisia Nawara project official page (French)]\n*[http://www.ogj.com/articles/2014/05/omv-to-invest-500-million-in-nawara-gas-field.html OMV to invest €500 million in Nawara gas field]"
