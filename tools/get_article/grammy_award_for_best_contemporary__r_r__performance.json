They appeared in different guises at the Grammys, aimed at male and female soloists and duos/groups. The Recording Academy used these categories to distinguish contemporary or rock 'n' roll recordings from traditional pop recordings, which had their own Best Pop Vocal Performance categories for male and female soloists and for duos or groups.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"4%\" | Year\n! width=\"48%\" | Recipient\n! width=\"48%\" | Nominee\n|-\n! rowspan=\"10\" | 1968\n| colspan=\"2\"  | Best Contemporary Female Solo Vocal Performance\n|-\n| \"Ode to Billie Joe\" by Bobbie Gentry\n|\n* \"Don't Sleep in the Subway\" by Petula Clark\n* \"I Say a Little Prayer\" by Dionne Warwick\n* \"It Must Be Him\" by Vikki Carr\n* \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" by Aretha Franklin\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Best Contemporary Male Solo Vocal Performance\n|-\n| \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" by Glen Campbell\n|\n* \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\" by Frankie Valli\n* \"Child of Clay\" by Jimmie Rodgers\n* \"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\" by Scott McKenzie\n* \"Yesterday\" by Ray Charles\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Best Contemporary Group Performance (Vocal or Instrumental)\n|-\n| \"Up, Up and Away\" by The 5th Dimension\n|\n* \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" by Procol Harum\n* \"I'm a Believer\" by The Monkees\n* \"Sgt.

The fact that in 1968, the three winners in the Male, Female and Group categories of the Best Contemporary Performance were identical to the winners of the Best Vocal Performance categories (Bobbie Gentry, Glen Campbell and The Fifth Dimension), had shown that the distinction between the two category groups was difficult to recognise.\nThe Best Contemporary Single category returned in 1970 and 1971, when it was renamed Best Contemporary Song.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.grammy.com/ Official site of the Grammy Awards]"
