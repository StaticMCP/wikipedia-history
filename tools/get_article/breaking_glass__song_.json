It was co-written by Bowie, bassist George Murray and drummer Dennis Davis in September 1976. Originally a track on Bowie's eleventh studio album Low (1977), a reworked version of the song was a regular on the Isolar II Tour. A live version from that tour was used as the lead track on a 7-inch EP to promote his second live album, Stage in 1978. The EP reached number 54 on the UK Singles Chart in December 1978.\nIn the US, the track \"Star\" was chosen as the lead track for the live EP (with \"What in the World\" and \"Breaking Glass\" as B-sides), but failed to chart, while in Japan, \"Soul Love\" was released to promote Stage (with \"Blackout\" as the B-side).\nBowie performed \"Breaking Glass\" on his Isolar II, Serious Moonlight, Outside, Heathen, and A Reality tours.\nLyrics\nThe original song was uncompromising even by Lows standards. The fractured lyrics are, like several songs written during Bowie's stay in Berlin, introspective of his dark, drug-filled period living in America in 1975–1976. Its lyrics, when written out, look potentially more like a paragraph than a song, and when separated into phrases, the song has a disjointed feeling. The song is short, less than two minutes, with only one verse.\nThe lines ''\"Don't look at the carpet; I drew something awful on it\"'' refer to Bowie's practice of drawing the tree of life on the floor during that period, as he was interested in Aleister Crowley and Hermetic Qabalah at the time.\nTrack listing\n# \"Breaking Glass\" (David Bowie, Dennis Davis, George Murray) – 3:28\n# \"Art Decade\" (Bowie) – 3:10\n# \"Ziggy Stardust\" (Bowie) – 3:32\nPersonnel\n* David Bowie – vocals, production\n* Carlos Alomar – lead guitar\n* Ricky Gardiner – rhythm guitar\n* George Murray – bass\n* Dennis Davis – drums\n* Brian Eno – Minimoog synthesizer\n* Tony Visconti – production\nLive versions\n* A spring 1978 live version recorded on the Isolar II Tour was released on Stage and on the above-mentioned single.
