Due to budget considerations, an alternative Stadtbahn line is also considered.\nMunich Airport Express\nAs the Munich city government is opposed to plans of the Bavarian government to build a Transrapid mag-lev line from München Hauptbahnhof to the Airport, it has proposed an alternative Express S-Bahn, MAEX, that should run along the tracks of the current S8 S-Bahn line.\nTo achieve a fast connection of airport and central station, the construction of a tunnel along the current tracks of the S8 has been proposed.\nEnglschalking grade crossing\nIndependent of the city government's plans, Deutsche Bahn is considering the construction of a short S-Bahn tunnel to make the grade crossing at the station redundant as it constantly leads to traffic jams. Also, the long waiting times at the crossing hamper the development of the districts east of the railway line.\nAlternatively, a bridge construction is considered.\nReferences"
