Published in 1994, the book contains original essays as well as updated versions of essays that appeared in anthologies and magazines like New York Native, The Village Voice, and Forum. As the title suggests, Allison gives the reader her take on her difficult childhood, race- and class-based schisms within the lesbian community, feminism, pornography, sadomasochism, and the transcending effect that literature can have on children.\nList of essays\n# Context\n# A Question of Class\n# Never Expected To Live Forever\n# Gun Crazy\n# Shotgun Strategies\n# What Do We See?
