It was published once a week, on a Thursday, and distributed free of charge.\nIt was available as a free, paperless Kingston Guardian e-newspaper and delivered straight to email inboxes each Thursday morning.\nThe newspaper was also sold for 60p at some newsagents and shops around the borough. It had an average distribution of 30,546, including 1,249 free pick-up copies at supermarkets and estate agents. It was delivered to homes in Kingston upon Thames, Norbiton, Surbiton, Tolworth, New Malden, Old Malden, Worcester Park, Hook and Chessington. It was owned by regional newspaper publisher Newsquest Media Group's South London arm, along with other Guardian titles including the Elmbridge Guardian and the paid-for Surrey Comet. Owing to cuts from Newsquest, the publication ceased to be printed on 30 September 2016, and became part of an amalgamated Surrey Comet.\nReferences\n*[http://www.kingstonguardian.co.uk Kingston Guardian]\n*[http://www.thisisnewsquest.co.uk/ Newsquest Media Group]"
