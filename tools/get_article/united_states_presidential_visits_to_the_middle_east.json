The first trips by an incumbent president to countries in (or partly within) the Middle East were those by Franklin D. Roosevelt, and were an offshoot of Allied diplomatic interactions during World War II. To date, 17 visits have been made to Egypt, 13 to Saudi Arabia, 14 to Israel, six to both Iraq, Jordan and Turkey, four to Iran, three to the Palestinian Territories, two to Kuwait, Syria, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, one to Bahrain, Georgia, and Oman. No incumbent American president has yet visited Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Lebanon, and Yemen.\nTable of visits\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!President\n!Dates\n!Countries\n!Locations\n!Key details\n|-\n|nowrap rowspan=4|Franklin D.
