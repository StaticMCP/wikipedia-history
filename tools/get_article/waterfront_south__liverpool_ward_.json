The Waterfront South ward was created as a single-member ward from the riverfront areas of the former Central and Riverside wards.\nThe ward has a smaller number of residents than other wards of the city, with a -59% variance from average at the 2019 figures used in the review, at 1,586. This had increased by the 2023 elections to 2,263. However, due to the expected significant redevelopment of the docklands it was projected that by 2027 the electorate would be 4,241, representing a -1% variance.\nThe ward boundaries follow the southern edge of the Prince's Half-Tide Dock, Bath Street, New Quay, George's Dock Gates, The Strand, Strand Street, Wapping, Chaloner Street, Sefton Street, Brunswick Way and the River Mersey. The ward covers the Liverpool Waterfront including the Liver Building, Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool, Liverpool Arena, Liverpool Marina and the Port of Liverpool between Princes Dock and Brunswick Dock.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
