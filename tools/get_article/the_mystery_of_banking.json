      "text": "# The Mystery of Banking\n\nThe Mystery of Banking is Murray Rothbard's 1983 book explaining the modern fractional-reserve banking system and its origins. In his June 2008 preface to the 298-page second edition, Douglas E. French suggests the work also lays out the “...devastating effects [of fractional-reserve banking] on the lives of every man, woman, and child.”\nRothbard dedicated the book to Thomas Jefferson, Charles Holt Campbell, and Ludwig von Mises, all “Champions of Hard Money.”\nSee also\n* Austrian Business Cycle Theory\nExternal links\n* [https://mises.org/document/614 The Mystery of Banking] (PDF and ePub), 2nd edition (2008)."
