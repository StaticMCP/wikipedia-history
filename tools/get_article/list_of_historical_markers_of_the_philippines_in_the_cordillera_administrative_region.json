The markers are in Ilocano, Filipino, and English.]]\nThis list of historical markers installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) is an annotated list of people, places, or events in the region that have been commemorated by cast-iron plaques issued by the said commission. The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations.\nWhile many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed, not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties.\nThe first historical marker in the Ilocano language was unveiled in 2009 for the Mansion House, Baguio.\nFor former NHCP Chairperson Maria Serena Diokno, the presence of the historical marker affirmed the historical significance of the City Hall site in Baguio against alterations on the said site under the National Cultural Heritage Act. The historicity was affirmed despite the lack of resolutions or consultations regarding the historical significance of the site.\nThis article lists thirty-seven (37) markers from the Cordillera Administrative Region, including seven (7) that are part of the Philippine Nationhood Trail markers series.\nAbra\nThis article lists three (3) markers from the Province of Abra.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Marker title\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| English Translation\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Type\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Description\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Language\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Date Issued\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Image\n|-\n| Ignacio Villamor y Borbon\n|\n|\n|\n| Jurist, author, and educator.
