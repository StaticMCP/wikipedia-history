Treiber designed Storm King for Clallam County's ferry route on Lake Crescent, Washington.\nStorm King was named after a mountain overlooking the lake.  Storm King was driven by sidewheels..  On deck, the vessel was 112' long and measured 31.5' on the beam across the sidewheels.  (The hull measurements were 90' long, 20.5' on the beam.)  Storm King, powered by a  Fairbanks-Morse engine, was probably the largest vessel ever on Lake Crescent.  The ferry had a capacity of 21 automobiles and 150 people.\nFerry traffic on Lake Crescent ended in 1922 with the completion of the Olympic Highway along the south side of the lake.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W.
