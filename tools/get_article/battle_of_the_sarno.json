It was fought in the plain at the mouth of the Sarno River in Campania, south of Mount Vesuvius. John's forces were strengthened by reinforcements from Jacopo Piccinino, who on the 27th defeated papal and Milanese forces under Alessandro Sforza and Federigo of Urbino near San Fabiano.\nFerdinand escaped with only twenty men but, with the help of Pope Pius II, the duke of Milan, the Albanian lord Skanderbeg, and the king of Aragon, was ultimately able to defeat John at the battle of Troia on 18 August 1462 and off Ischia in 1465.\nSee also\n* Battle of Nola (disambiguation)\nReferences\nCitations\nReferences\n*  }}.\n*  }}\n*  |date=1872 |title=Encyclopaedia of Chronology, Historical and Biographical |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeI0AQAAMAAJ |location=London |publisher=Longmans, Green, & Co. |contribution=Ferdinand |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZeI0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA512 |pages=512–4}}\n* .\n* .\n*  |title=Italy Illustrated: A Complete History of the Past and Present Condition of the Italian States |volume=I |publisher=London Printing & Publishing Co. |date=1860 }}."
