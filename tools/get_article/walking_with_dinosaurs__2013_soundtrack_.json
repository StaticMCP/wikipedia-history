The film score is composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan and released under the Sony Classical Records and Metropolis Movie Music labels on 24 December 2013.\nBackground\nIn May 2013, it was reported that David Hirschfelder would compose the musical score for Walking with Dinosaurs but was ultimately replaced by Paul Leonard-Morgan that August. Having never done an animated film before, with the exception of the Despicable Me short films he did for Illumination, Leonard-Morgan admitted his skepticisms on doing an animated film which had an $80 million dollar budget, but knew that he would write strong melodies and have lot of fun in his music, considering it as a natural progression from the Despicable Me short films. He described it as a \"schizophrenic, energetic stuff\".\nThe score was recorded at the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam, Germany where Leonard-Morgan conducted the German Film Orchestra Babelsberg. Various instruments were recorded at multiple places including throat-singing and didgeridoo in New York City, harp, harmonica and vocalists in Los Angeles, tin whistle, violin, guitar and bass players in Scotland and percussions at the AIR Studios in London, where the score was also mixed there by audio engineer Rupert Coulson. Additional overdubs were done at Los Angeles.\nMusic composed and conducted by: Paul Leonard-Morgan\nOrchestrations by; Matt Dunkley, Richard Bronskill & David Foster\nPeformed By; Filmorchestra Babelsberg\nOvertone-Singing & Didgeridoo; Alex Glenfield\nRecorded By; Brad Lauchert\nRecorded By; GCR Audio Recorded Studio, NY, USA\nSolo Low/High Whistle; Marc Duff\nGuitar/Bass/Banjo; Ross Hamilton\nSolo Violin; Fiona Hamilton\nRelease\nThe score was released through Sony Classical Records and Metropolis Movie Music on 24 December 2013, four days after the film's release.\nTrack listing\nReception\nMichael Rechtshaffen, reviewing for The Hollywood Reporter, called Leonard-Morgan's score as \"fantastic\", while Peter Debruge of Variety noted it to be \"functional\". Tom Meek, reviewing for Paste, considered the choice of music to be \"awkward, inappropriate and poorly synched\". The score was one of  scores from feature films that were determined by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to be eligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Score at the 86th Academy Awards. However, it did not make the final list of nominations.\nPromotional score\nA promotional score was released in December 2013 by 20th Century Fox as a part of their For Your Consideration campaign for the 2013–14 film awards season.\nAdditional music\nThe following songs are featured in the film but not included in the soundtrack:\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
