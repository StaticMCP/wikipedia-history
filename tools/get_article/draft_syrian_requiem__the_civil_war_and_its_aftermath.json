Rabinovich said the work combines rigorous scholarship with accessible narrative, aiming to provide readers with \"a nuanced understanding of one of the most devastating and complex conflicts of our time.\"\nFormat\nThe book is divided into six chapters, complemented by a preface, a conclusion, and additional reference materials. The chapters documents the historical and political developments in Syria, starting with the Ba’th Party’s rise to power (1963–2011) and the subsequent civil war (2011–2018). Following this, the book studies Syria’s domestic situation, its interactions within the regional orbit, and the involvement of international actors. The narrative then transitions to developments in Syria during 2019–2020, culminating in a conclusion that reflects on the war’s ongoing ramifications. The book is also supported by extensive notes, a selected bibliography, and an index.\nReviews\nFred H.
