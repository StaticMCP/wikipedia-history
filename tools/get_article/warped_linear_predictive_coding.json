This can have advantages in reducing the bitrate required for a given level of perceived audio quality/intelligibility, especially in wideband audio coding.\nHistory\nWarped LPC was first proposed in 1980 by Hans Werner Strube.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n---\n\n## Warped Linear Predictive Coding\n\n#REDIRECT Warped linear predictive coding"
