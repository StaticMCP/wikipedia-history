It was her first notable play and was written when she was nineteen.\nLansbury wrote the play while studying anthropology at university. It was inspired by Professor A.P. Elkins' book The Australian Aboriginie.\nThe play won the 1948 Henry Lawson prize for poetry.\nLansbury played the title role in the original 1949 production. It was one of the most highly regarded Australian radio plays of the 1940s. The play was produced again in 1951.\nPremise\nKrubi, a young Aboriginal woman, defies the strictures of her group by enquiring into knowledge normally reserved for men. She refuses to marry Arilla, her bethrothed. Arilla shows Krubi Churinga, the secret place of men's initiations.\nWingaree, a wise Aboriginal edler, watches on.\nReferences\nNotes\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/C211592 Krubi of the Illawarra] at AustLit"
