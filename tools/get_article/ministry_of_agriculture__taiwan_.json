The COA is actively participating various FAO-led activities.\nHistory\nIn 1912, the Ministry of Basic Industries was created after the establishment of the Provisional Government of the ROC. The ministry was in charge for agriculture, forestry, industry and commerce in China. After the Beiyang Government was established in the same year, the ministry was divided into two office, one is to oversee the agriculture and forestry, and the other is to oversee the industry and commerce. In 1914, the two offices reemerged to become the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.  In 1925, the Ministry of Basic Industries was installed but renamed to Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery. In 1930, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery and Ministry of Industry and Commerce were combined to form the Ministry of Basic Industries. In 1938, the ministry was changed to Ministry of Economic Affairs with the Department of Agriculture and Forestry was placed under it. In 1940, the department was expanded to become Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. In 1941, the ministry was changed to Agriculture and Forestry Administration.\nOn the other hand, there was the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCRR) established in Nanking in 1948.  After the Kuomintang's defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, which saw the government evacuated to Taiwan, the JCRR moved there. That same year,  the Department of Agriculture was created under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in which it was later renamed to Department of Agriculture and Forestry. In November 1981, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry was upgraded to Agriculture Bureau of the MOEA.\nIn 1978, the JCRR was changed to the Council for Agricultural Planning and Development  (CAPD) under the Executive Yuan. On 20 July 1984, both of the CAPD and the Agriculture Bureau were merged to become the Council of Agriculture. In May 2022, the Executive Yuan approved the proposal to upgrade the council to the status of a ministry. In May 2023 the Organization Act of the Ministry of Agriculture was passed by the Legislative Yuan.\nOrganization structures\n* Department of Planning\n* Department of Animal Industry\n* Department of Farmers’ Services\n* Department of International Affairs\n* Department of Science and Technology\n* Department of Irrigation and Engineering\n* Secretariat\n* Personnel Office\n* Accounting Office\n* Civil Service Ethics Office\n* Legal Affairs Committee\n* Petitions and Appeals Committee\n* Information Management Center\nAgencies\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n* Agriculture and Food Agency\n** North Region Branch\n** Central Region Branch\n** Southern Region Branch\n** Eastern Region Branch\n* Fisheries Agency\n* Animal and Plant Health Inspection Agency\n** Keelung Branch\n** Hsinchu Branch\n** Taichung Branch\n** Kaohsiung Branch\n* Agricultural Finance Agency\n* Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency\n** Luodong Forest District Office\n** Hsinchu Forest District Office\n** Dongshi Forest District Office\n** Nantou Forest District Office\n** Chiayi Forest District Office\n** Pingtung Forest District Office\n** Taitung Forest District Office\n** Hualien Forest District Office\n** Aerial Survey Office\n* Agency of Rural Development and Soil and Water Conservation\n** First Engineering Office\n** Second Engineering Office\n** Third Engineering Office\n** Fourth Engineering Office\n** Fifth Engineering Office\n** Sixth Engineering Office\n* Irrigation Agency\n* Agricultural Technology Park Administration Center[https://www.atp.gov.tw/ENG/Default.aspx]\n* Taiwan Agricultural Research institute\n* Taiwan Forestry Research Institute\n* Fisheries Research Institute\n* Taiwan Livestock Research Institute\n** Taitung Animal Propagation Station\n* Veterinary Research Institute\n** Animal Drugs Inspection Branch\n* Taiwan Agricultural Chemicals Research Institute\n* Taiwan Biodiversity Research Institute\n* Taoyuan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station\n* Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station\n* Taichung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station\n* Tainan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station\n* Kaohsiung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station\n* Hualien District Agricultural Research and Extension Station\n* Tea Research and Extension Station\n* Taiwan Seed Improvement and Propagation Station\nMinisters\nPolitical Party:\n|Kuomintang|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Democratic Progressive Party|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Non-partisan/ unknown|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|--\n!
