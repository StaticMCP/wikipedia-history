It occurred in July 1904 at the town of Bekeriyah in the Qassim region. After Ibn Saud's victory in the Battle of Dilam, he tried to expand his power by capturing Qassim, weakening his Rashidi enemies and their Ottoman allies. The battle ended in a Saudi victory with heavy casualties on both sides.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Battle of Bekeriyah, Arabic Wikipedia"
