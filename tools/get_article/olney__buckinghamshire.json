At the 2021 census, it had a population of 6,598.\nLying on the left bank of the River Great Ouse, the town is located around  from Central Milton Keynes, and  from Bedford, Northampton and Wellingborough.\nHistory\nOlney is thought to have been an important Romano-British township, with remains located north-east of the current town, where in 2023 archaeologists uncovered a villa mosaic considered \"remains of high significance\".\nOlney is mentioned as Ollanege (Olla's island) in 932. According to the Domesday Book the place later called Olnei had been held in 1066 by Burgred, a descendent of the King of Mercia, but by 1086 its overlord was Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances.\nThe \"L\" in Olney came long ago not to be pronounced, at least by local people.\nIn 1643, during the English Civil War, the Battle of Olney Bridge saw Prince Rupert's force attack Col. Harvey's Parliamentarians, with 60 killed.\nThe town was a centre of the Buckinghamshire lace-making industry, with Armstrong's Lace Factory prominent in the High Street, ornamented as \"the Bucks Lace Industry\".\nIn the late 18th century, the poet William Cowper and anti-slavery campaigner and cleric John Newton collaborated here on what became known as the Olney Hymns, which include Amazing Grace. The town has the Cowper and Newton Museum dedicated to them, adapted from Cowper's former residence, given to the town in 1905 by the publisher William Hill Collingridge (who had been born in the house). Newton was succeeded as curate in Olney by the biblical commentator Thomas Scott (1747–1821). In July 2022, the museum celebrated the 250th anniversary of Amazing Grace with exhibitions and special events.\nOlney Park Farm\nThe hamlet of Olney Park Farm to the north of the town derives its name from a park established in 1374 by Ralph, Lord Basset. In 1861 it attained civil parish status, but was subsequently incorporated into an enlarged Olney civil parish around 1931.\nThe 1841 census gave the population as 2,362.\nOlney Pancake Race\nSince 1445, a pancake race has been run in the town on many Pancake Days, the day before the beginning of Lent. Tradition records that in 1445 on Shrove Tuesday, the \"Shriving Bell\" rang out to signal the start of the Shriving church service. On hearing the bell a local housewife, who had been busy cooking pancakes in anticipation of the beginning of Lent, ran to the church, frying pan still in hand, tossing the pancake to prevent it from burning, and dressed in her kitchen apron and headscarf.\nThe women of Olney recreate this race every Shrove Tuesday by running from the market place to the Church of St Peter and St Paul, a distance of over 400 yards. The traditional prize is a kiss from the verger. In modern times, Olney competes with the town of Liberal, Kansas, in the United States for the fastest time in either town to win the \"International Pancake Race\". There is also a children's race, run by children from the local schools. The children have to run a distance of about 20 yards. The competition was revived postwar in 1948 and has been run every year without interruption since 1950.\nListed buildings and structures\nThe parish has one Grade I listed building, the Church of Saints Peter and Paul; four Grade II*,  and a further 114 at Grade II. The church is 14th century, with later additions. There is a scheduled monument, a Romano-British settlement, on the northern outskirts of the town.\nGovernance\n, depicting a women's pancake race]]\nOlney has been part of the Borough (now City) of Milton Keynes since 1974, which has been a unitary authority since 1997.
