The most well-preserved temple is the Bahal temple complex. Most of the other temples on the site are in ruins.\nStatus\nThere are no effective controls over the management of the remains of the numerous temples at the site.  In 2011, a research worker from Medan State University expressed the view that up to half of the 16 temples in the area were at risk of being illegally excavated and noted that groups of thieves had been observed working at some of the temples.\nReferences"
