The awards recognise outstanding literary achievement in Canberra and surrounding regions, with categories spanning fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and children's literature. The suite also includes in memoriam prizes and funded mentorships that support both emerging and established writers.\nHistory\nThe ACT Writers Centre was established in 1994 to support writers in the Australian Capital Territory.\nThe inaugural ACT Writing and Publishing Awards were presented in 2004.\nIn 2022, the organisation was renamed MARION ACT, and the awards became known as the MARION Book Awards. Since then, the awards program has evolved into the ACT Literary Awards, which now encompasses multiple categories across fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and children's literature. The suite also includes memorial prizes honouring distinguished individuals, as well as funded mentorships for emerging and established writers.\nCategories\nIn 2004, the Centre launched the ACT Writing and Publishing Awards, coordinated and presented annually to recognise excellence in local writing.\nIn 2022, the organisation rebranded as MARION, and the awards were briefly renamed the MARION Book Awards. Since then, the program has expanded and evolved into the ACT Literary Awards, coordinated by MARION as part of its annual programming. The awards now include categories for fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and children's literature, and also incorporate in memoriam prizes and funded mentorships supporting both emerging and established writers in the ACT and surrounding regions.\nIn 2023, MARION introduced the MARION Fellowship, a developmental opportunity open to emerging writers, regardless of location. In 2024, the Marion Halligan Award was established in memory of acclaimed Australian author Marion Halligan OAM. This award recognises work that demonstrates uniqueness, literary excellence, and a capacity to surpass genre. It is selected from across all categories of the ACT Literary Awards.\nList of winners\n2024 AWARDS\n'Fiction Self-published\n* Highly Commended:' The Last Famine by Elisa Cristallo\n'Fiction Traditional Publishing\n* Winner': Girl in a Pink Dress by Kylie Needham (Penguin Books Australia)\n* Highly Commended: Untethered by Ayesha Inoon (HarperCollins Australia)\n'NonFiction Self-published\n* Winner': Neither King nor Saint by Helen Topor\n'NonFiction Traditional Publishing\n* Winner': Bennelong & Phillip: A History Unravelled by Kate Fullagar (Scribner Australia)\n* Highly Commended: Helena Rubinstein: The Australian Years by Angus Trumble (La Trobe University Press, Black Inc.)\n'''Children's Self-published\n* Winner': That Book About Space Stuff  by David Conley\n* Highly Commended: Phoenix and Ralph by Barbie Robinson, ill.
