Perceived as a sign of profound humility, images of Brandt's action received worldwide attention. More broadly, the gesture came to symbolise Ostpolitik, Brandt's ultimately successful policy of diplomatically reconciling West Germany with its eastern neighbours following the Holocaust and the Second World War.\nEvent\nThe event took place on December 7, 1970, in Warsaw, Poland, during a visit to a monument to the German occupation-era Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. After laying a wreath, Brandt unexpectedly, and spontaneously, knelt. He remained silently in that position for a short time (about 30 seconds), surrounded by a large group of dignitaries and press photographers. Brandt had actively resisted the early Nazi regime, and had spent most of the time of Hitler's reign in exile. The occasion of Brandt's visit to Poland at the time was the signing of the Treaty of Warsaw between West Germany and Poland, guaranteeing German acceptance of the new borders of Poland. The treaty was one of the Brandt-initiated policy steps (the 'Ostpolitik') to ease tensions between West and East during the Cold War.\nReactions\nIn Germany\nWilly Brandt Monument in Willy Brandt Square in Warsaw]]\nOn the same day, Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, which acknowledged the Oder–Neisse line as the final German border with Poland. Both actions attracted controversy within Germany, as did Ostpolitik in general, which was supported by only a narrow majority of the people and had opposition within Brandt's own Social Democratic Party. Its voters had included a significant proportion of expellees from the formerly-German territories in Poland, most of whom left to support the conservative parties.\nAccording to a Der Spiegel survey of the time, 48% of all West Germans thought the Kniefall was excessive, 41% said it was appropriate and 11% had no opinion. Brandt's victory in the next elections, in late 1972, was also due to the growing view among voters that Brandt's Ostpolitik, symbolized by the Kniefall, and his reformist domestic policies were helping to boost Germany's international reputation and so should be supported. His party won its best federal election result ever.\nInternationally\nThe Warsaw Ghetto Heroes memorial.\nWhile at the time, positive reactions may have been limited, his show of humility was a small but vital step in bridging the gaps World War II had left between Germany and Eastern Europe. In historical terms, Brandt gained much renown for this act. He was named Time Person of the Year in 1970, with the magazine highlighting the Kniefall as one of the main reasons for his recognition, and it is thought to be one of the reasons he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.\nA monument to Willy Brandt was unveiled on 6 December 2000, in Willy Brandt Square in Warsaw (near the Warsaw Ghetto Heroes Monument) on the eve of the 30th anniversary of his famous gesture.\nBrandt's memories\nBrandt was repeatedly interviewed about the genuflection and about his motives. He later noted that:\n:(German original) \"Am Abgrund der deutschen Geschichte und unter der Last der Millionen Ermordeten tat ich, was Menschen tun, wenn die Sprache versagt.\"\n:(English translation) At the abyss of German history and under the weight of millions of murdered people, I did what humans do when speech fails them.\nEgon Bahr, an eyewitness and Brandt's friend and political ally of many years, recalled in a 2010 interview: \"The only thing he said was that at that moment facing the ribbon, he thought: Just laying the wreath is not enough.\"\nLater reception\nReviewing the Kniefall one tends to agree that it played an important part in easing the tension between the Eastern and Western Blocs. The Treaty of Warsaw 1970 was signed on the very same day and it included the inviolability of the Oder-Neisse-line. Józef Cyrankiewicz (1911–1989) the Polish prime minister and survivor of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp signed. To expand on Brandt's memories, here are some later receptions:\nThere is a lot of speculation whether Brandt did this spontaneously. Willy Brandt wrote about that in his memoirs Erinnerungen (reminiscences):\n:\"Again and again I have been asked what the deal was with the gesture. Was it planned? No, it wasn't. My closest colleagues were as surprised as those reporters and photographers standing close to me, as well as those keeping their distance, as they did not expect anything new. [...] I did not plan anything, but left Wilanów Palace with the feeling that I have to represent the special remembrance of the ghetto monument. At the abyss of German history and the weight of millions that have been murdered, I did, what people do when speech fails them.\"\nEgon Bahr said in his reminiscence Zu meiner Zeit (Back in my time) 1996:\n:\"Right as the motorcade moved towards the ghetto monument, Berthold Beitz and me compared our impressions. We calmly got out of the car and were in no hurry to get closer to the journalists and photographers -  then everything went quiet. It is rare for this hard-boiled crowd to be silenced. While coming closer, someone whispered >>He's kneeling.> I've had the feeling that bowing my head won't be enough\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120406113958/http://www.cicero.de/sites/default/files/field/image/willy-brandt-kniefall-warschau.jpg Photo of the Kniefall] (photographer: Engelbert Reineke)\n* [http://www.dhm.de/lemo/objekte/pict/KontinuitaetUndWandel_zeitschriftSpiegelKniefallBrandt/index.html Cover of German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" with image of Brandt in front of the monument] (photographer: Sven Simon)\n* [http://p2.la-img.com/375/24940/9095814_1_l.jpg Photo of the Kniefall including wreath], Photographer Hanns Hubmann\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7iVNoWDJDY 1970: This photo of a German chancellor went down in history.
