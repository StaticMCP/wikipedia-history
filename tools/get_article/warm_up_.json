      "text": "# Warm Up!\n\nWarm Up! is a 2000 single-player racing simulator developed by Lankhor and published by Microids for PlayStation and Windows.\nGameplay\nWarm Up! is essentially a Formula 1 game without the official license, consisting of both a simulation mode and an arcade mode.\nCritical reception\nJeuxVideo praised the game's realism and addictive gameplay. On the contrary, Absolute Games offered a scathing review, deeming the title primitive, and an insult to the simulator genre.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.lankhor.net/jeux.php?jeu=36&menu=documents&ident=214 Joystick] (French)\n* [http://www.lankhor.net/jeux.php?jeu=36&menu=documents&ident=612 Generation 4] (French)"
