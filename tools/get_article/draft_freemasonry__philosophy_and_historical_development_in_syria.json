Its development spans three main phases: the emergence of lodges during the Ottoman period, the institutional expansion under the French Mandate, and restricted intellectual continuity following the 1965 prohibition order. A later phase of revivalist activity emerged in the 1990s, characterized by independent organizations drawing upon earlier Syrian Masonic traditions.\nIntroduction\nFreemasonry, a fraternal and philosophical movement shaped by Enlightenment thought and older guild traditions, has historically emphasized moral self-improvement, civic responsibility, and fraternity. In Syria, these ideas took root within an environment of intellectual reform and cultural exchange, allowing the movement to adopt a distinct regional character grounded in local history and the broader traditions of the Levant.\nPhilosophical background\nClassical Masonic literature emphasizes the symbolic and ethical dimensions of the Craft. Its teachings are framed around personal discipline, moral refinement, and service to others. Writers such as Albert G. Mackey and Carl H. Claudy described Freemasonry not as a repository of hidden doctrines but as a system intended to cultivate virtue through symbolic instruction and communal practice.\nThese philosophical interpretations circulated in the Levant during the early twentieth century and influenced the intellectual climate surrounding Syrian lodges. They formed a supplementary body of ethical guidance rather than constituting historical evidence of lodge administration or governance.\nEarly history (1868–1918)\nThe first documented Masonic activity in Syria dates to April 1868, when American Mason Robert Morris visited Damascus and described a lodge operating under the English Constitution. Further lodges were later established in Damascus and Aleppo under Scottish and French auspices.\nMembership records and contemporary correspondence indicate participation by local officials, merchants, and intellectuals. The sons of Emir Abdelkader al-Jaza’iri—Muhammad, Saʿid, and Mohyeddin—were among the earliest documented participants in Damascene lodges.\nMandate-era expansion (1920–1945)\nUnder the French Mandate, Freemasonry expanded through new charters issued by the Grand Orient de France. The Ibrahim al-Khalil Lodge was established in Damascus in 1924 and was later followed by lodges such as Nur al-Sharq, Qasioun, and Khalid ibn al-Walid.\nSeveral prominent political and professional figures of the period appear in surviving lodge rosters, including Faris al-Khoury, Lutfi al-Haffar, Abd al-Rahman al-Shahbandar, Dr. Rida Said, and Jamil Mardam Bey.\nA regional body described in contemporary correspondence as the \"Regional Grand Lodge of Syria\" was active by the late 1930s. In 1946–47, the Grand National Syrian-Lebanese Lodge and the Grand Orient of Syria appeared in Beirut and Damascus, coordinating lodge activity across the region.\nSocial and cultural contributions\nHistorical studies identify Masonic involvement in several civic and cultural initiatives in early twentieth-century Syria. Freemasons participated in the Arabization of the Faculty of Medicine at Damascus University, supported early music education initiatives, contributed to the founding of the Syrian Red Crescent (1923), and funded medical institutions such as the tuberculosis hospital in Rukn al-Din and al-Muwasat University Hospital.\nProhibition (1965)\nOn 9 August 1965, the Syrian Arab Republic issued Decree No. 6 prohibiting all Masonic organizations and ordering the closure of lodges and the confiscation of their assets. Since that date, Freemasonry has had no legal status in Syria.\nPost-1965 developments (1994–present)\nWhile formal lodge activity remained prohibited, intellectual interest in Masonic heritage persisted in private circles. In 1994, independent organizations identifying themselves as heirs to the pre-1965 tradition announced the formation of the Supreme Legislative Council of Freemasons and the Grand Lodge of the Middle East, based in Damascus.\nThese bodies describe themselves as philosophical and organizational successors to historical Syrian Freemasonry, though they operate without official recognition and are not documented in academic or governmental literature assessing post-1965 Masonic continuity.\nLegacy\nThe history of Syrian Freemasonry reflects broader regional trends: early adoption during the late Ottoman reform era, intellectual and institutional growth under the Mandate, suppression during the mid-twentieth century, and renewed private interest in later decades. Although formal lodge activity ceased in 1965, the philosophical ideals of the Craft—moral cultivation, fraternity, and the pursuit of knowledge—continued to influence intellectual life and revivalist currents in the modern period.\nReferences\n:Category:Syrian Freemasonry\n:Category:Freemasonry\n:Category:History of Syria"
