The construction of this lot more than doubled the commuter parking capacity at the station; its construction required land swaps between the Town of North Hempstead and the Long Island Rail Road, and the rail freight depot was relocated roughly  from its original location for its construction.\nIn 1969, the boundaries of the parking district were expanded, taking in several incorporated villages surrounding the hamlet of Port Washington (Baxter Estates, Flower Hill, Manorhaven, Port Washington North, and Sands Point). As a result of the expansion, legislation was enacted limiting parking at the Port Washington LIRR station to residents of the parking district.\nAs of 2022, the Port Washington Parking District operates 12 parking fields, some of which require residential permits exclusively available to district residents or merchants between certain hours and on certain days (specifically the commuter and merchant lots).\nCommunities served\nThe Port Washington Parking District serves the following communities:\n* Baxter Estates\n* Flower Hill\n* Manorhaven\n* Port Washington\n* Port Washington North\n* Plandome Manor\n* Sands Point\nSee also\n* Port Washington Police District\n* Port Washington Water District\n* Port Washington Water Pollution Control District\n* Special districts in New York (state)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://goportparking.org/rppportal/ Official website]"
