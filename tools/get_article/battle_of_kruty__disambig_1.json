Tymchenko, withdrew from Bakhmach to a small railroad station Kruty midway towards Nizhyn. The small unit consisted mainly of the Student Battalion (Kurin) of Sich Riflemen, a unit of the Khmelnytsky Cadet School, and a Free Cossacks company.\nJust before the assault Tymchenko was replaced by D. Nosenko. Tymchenko left for Nizhyn in attempt to recruit the locally quartered Shevchenko Regiment (800 soldiers) to the Ukrainian side. On January 30, 1918, the Shevchenko regiment sided with the Soviet regime, the news of which forced the Ukrainian garrison of Kruty hastily to withdraw. Over half of the 400 men were killed during the battle, which lasted up to five hours. In Soviet historiography, the battle is mistakenly dated on January 29, 1918 and confused with the Plysky rail station skirmish (:uk:Плиски (станція)).\nThe Haidamaka Kish of Symon Petlyura (300 soldiers) that rushed to reinforce the Kruty garrison and was delayed due to the Darnytsia railworkers sabotage and stopped in close vicinity at Bobryk railway station. They eventually turned back to Kyiv due to the Bolshevik Arsenal Uprising, which occurred on the same day.\nEighteen of the students were re-buried at Askold's Grave in the centre of Kyiv after the return of the Tsentralna Rada to the capital in March 1918. At the funeral the then President of the Ukrainian People's Republic, Mykhailo Hrushevsky, called every one of the 400 students who fought in the battle, heroes. Poet Pavlo Tychyna wrote \"To the memory of the thirties\" about the heroic death of the students.\nAfter the fall of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the bodies of the students were moved to the Lukyanivske Cemetery in Kiev.\nUkrainian legacy\nAn accurate history of the battle was long suppressed by the Soviet government. Only recently, a monument was set up to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Kruty at Askold's Grave, and a commemorative hryvnia coin was minted. In 2006, the Kruty Heroes Monument was erected on the site of the historic battle. The battle is remembered each year on or around January 29.\nOn 1 March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the area around the villages of Pamiatne and Khoroshe Ozero reportedly resulted in nearly 200 Russian troops being killed in action, according to local officials. Before the fighting, Russian soldiers took photos near the Kruty Heroes Memorial and fired on it.\nThe battle and subsequent massacre are mentioned in the \"\" by .\nThe battle has been described as the \"Free World's First Resistance To Communism\" by historian Volodymyr Yaniv, as it was one of the earliest examples of a free people resisting an invasion by a foreign communist army intent on subjugating them, a precursor to the Russian invasion of Georgia two years later in 1921.\nImportant personalities\n* Leonid Butkevych, the youngest soldier who was in the sixth grade\n* Yakiv Ryabokin-Rohoza-Rozanov\n* Volodymyr Shulhyn, a brother of the Ukrainian statesman Oleksander Shulhyn\n* Ivano Hrushetsky, later an Orthodox priest who eventually died in a Soviet prison in August 1940\n* Mytrofan Shvydun, later continued to fight on the \"Shooter\" and \"Free Ukraine\" armored trains and in 1941 organized the Lutsk Battalion of OUN (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists)\n* Mykhailo Mykhailyk, later wrote a detailed memoir about the battle\n* Numerous former students of Kruty became the base of the officer corps of the legendary Black Zaporizhians Cavalry Regiment\n* Mykola Kryvopusk and Hnat Martynyuk in 1920-1921 served as personal bodyguards of Symon Petlyura, Martynyuk, after becoming a priest, perished in Volyn in 1943 under unknown circumstances\n* Serhiy Zakhvalsky, eventually became an officer in the Polish Army, however, he was renowned for imprisoning a whole company of the Red Army in 1920, while heading one of the cavalry squads of the Zaliznyak Cavalry Regiment\n* Averkiy Honcharenko, in 1943 became one of the organizers of the SS Halychyna of which he was appointed a commander in 1945\n* Petro Franchuk, one of the members of SS Halychyna\n* Yuri Voronoy, son of Ukrainian mathematician Georgy Voronoy, performed the first human kidney transplant in 1933\nTo the memory of the thirties\nGallery\nFile:Burying of the fighters of the Battle of Kruty.jpg|Photo, mistakenly taken as photo of burial of the student fighters of the battle, 1918\nFile:Kruty Commemorative coin.jpg|A hryvnia coin commemorating the Battle of Kruty\nFile:Kruty monument on Askold Grave.jpg|Kruty monument on Askold's Grave\nSee also\n* Kruty Heroes Memorial\n* Kyiv Arsenal January Uprising\n* Group of forces in fight with counter revolution in the South Russia\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fawq2VDcApg Retrospective by historian]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T00JnmDpI_k|Video Montage about the Battle of Kruty]\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150203053230/http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2011/01/28/19369/ Життя після Крут.
