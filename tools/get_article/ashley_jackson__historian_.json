Jackson is a specialist in the history of the British Empire.\nEarly life and education\nAshley Jackson was born in Bristol, England on 24 June 1971. He attended the University of Greenwich, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1992, and Oxford University, from which he received a Master of Studies degree in 1993 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1996. His dissertation was about the history of World War II and British imperial Botswana (then formally known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate).\nCareer\nAcademia\nJackson is Professor of Imperial and Military History at King's College London. He specializes in studying the global military strategy of the British Empire. His first book, Botswana, 1939–1945: An African Country at War, published in 1999, was adapted from his dissertation; it covers the recruitment and demobilization of the African Auxiliary Pioneer Corps as well as the wartime Botswanan home front experience. The Times Literary Supplement called it a \"fascinating study\". His second book, published in 2001 and considered thematically similar to his first by the Journal of Southern African Studies, was War and Empire in Mauritius and the Indian Ocean and analyzed British Mauritius during World War II. According to African Affairs, Botswana, 1939–1945 and War and Empire were \"two useful, excellent books\". His third book was published in 2006 as The British Empire and the Second World War, taking on \"the whole of the British Empire in the war years\" in what African Affairs called \"an important book\" and \"an accurate account of the contributions made by dominions and colonies\". In 2016, Jackson told The Independent that he believed the British public needed \"better education\" in a \"warts and all understanding\" of British imperial history that acknowledged the exploitative dimensions of the British Empire.\nTelevision\nJackson appears as himself in Cunk on Earth, a 2022 mockumentary about human history created by the BBC.\nSelective bibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSelective filmography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Air date\n!Series\n!Installment\n!Role\n|-\n|12 March 2012\n|Empire\n|\"Playing the Game\"\n| rowspan=\"8\" |Himself\n|-\n|March 2014\n|Heir Hunters\n|Series 8\n|-\n|10 April 2018\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Cunk on Britain\n|\"The Empire Strikes Back\"\n|-\n|17 April 2018\n|\"The Third Episode\"\n|-\n|24 April 2018\n|\"Twentieth Century Shocks\"\n|-\n|23 February 2022\n|BBC Online\n|\"Did Darkest Hour Get Much Right?\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |20 September 2022\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Cunk on Earth\n|\"Rise of the Machines\"\n|-\n|\"War(s) of the World(s)?\"\n|}\nSee also\n* Historiography of the British Empire\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://ashleyjacksonhistorian.com/ Professional website]"
