The book goes further by analyzing the development of the ideas and practices of using air power in counterinsurgency and other asymmetrical roles.\nReviews\nA review by Michael Robert Terry in The Journal of Military History stated: \"Joel Hayward's edited work, Air Power, Insurgency and the \"War on Terror\", successfully presents the foundations of air power's historical, contemporary, and moral relationships to irregular warfare. ... [It] provides thought provoking reading, while the collection of papers provides much needed critical thinking about the relationship of air power to meet the challenges of conducting counter-insurgent operations within the context of irregular warfare and terrorism.\"\nReferences"
