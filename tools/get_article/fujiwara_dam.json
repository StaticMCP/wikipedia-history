It is located  north of Minakami. It was constructed between 1951 and 1957. The dam itself supports a single Francis turbine hydroelectric generator with a 23 MW capacity which was commissioned in 1957. The reservoir created by the dam serves as the lower reservoir for the 1,200 Tamahara Pumped Storage Power Station which was commissioned in 1986. The dam is  high and withholds a reservoir with a  storage capacity.\nSee also\n}}\n*List of power stations in Japan\n*List of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations\nReferences"
