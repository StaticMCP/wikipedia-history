It proved to be by far the most successful of his four games at this level: Righton hit a first-innings 48 and took his only first-class wicket, that of England Test cricketer Albert Knight.\nHe did nothing in his three subsequent games, other than to hold a catch to dismiss Thomas Langdon in his final match, against Gloucestershire in June 1913.\nHis son Edward (also, in fact, named Edward Grantham Righton) also played four times for Worcestershire, in the mid-1930s.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
