However the other USAAF support commands (Air Technical Service Command (ATSC); Air Transport Command (ATC) or Troop Carrier Command) commanded a significant number of airfields in a support roles.\nIt is still possible to find remnants of these wartime airfields. Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor Airfields\nArmy Air Force Training CommandAAF Southeast Training Center\n* Nashville AAC, Nashville (Non-Flying Facility)\n: Aviation Cadet Classification Center\n: 526th Army Air Force Base Unit\nEastern Flying Training Command\n* Smyrna AAF, Smyrna, Tennessee\n: 313th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Was: Sewart AAF until 1947, then Sewart Air Force Base (1947-1971)\n: Now: Smyrna Airport and  Army Aviation Support Facility #1, Tennessee Army National Guard\n:: William Northern Field, Tullahoma\n:: Sub-base of Smyrna AAF\n:: 343d Army Air Force Base Unit\n:: Now:  Tullahoma Regional Airport\nAir Transport Command\n* Memphis AAF, Memphis\n: 4th Ferrying Group\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport/US Navy\n: 346th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now: Memphis International Airport and  Memphis Air National Guard Base\n* Berry Field/Nashville Municipal Airport, Nashville, Tennessee\n: 20th Ferrying Group\n: Joint use USAAF/Civil Airport\n: 508th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: Now Nashville International Airport and  Berry Field Air National Guard Base\nThird Air Force\n* Dyersburg Army Air Base, Halls, Tennessee\n: B-17/B-24 Pilot training facility\n: 346th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy\n: 419th Army Air Force Base Unit\n: 451st Bombardment Group, Heavy\n: Reopened as Arnold Field (Tennessee)\nReferences\n* Maurer, Maurer (1983).
