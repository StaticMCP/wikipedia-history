Built by the rulers of the Chand dynasty, Baleshwar Temple is a marvelous symbol of stone carving. It is believed to have been built in 13th century AD (1390 AD) by Garud Gyan Chand. Uday Chand started reconstruction work for this temple between 1420 and 1421 AD.\nHari Chand, who reigned from 1423 AD to 1427 AD, completed the reconstruction work on the temple as per a copperplate inscription (dated 1423 AD) at the temple.\nOverview\nThe main Baleshwar temple is dedicated to Shiva (who is also known as Baleshwar). There are two other temples in the compound of Baleshwar, one dedicated to Ratneshwar and other to Champawati Durga.  Close to the Baleshwar Temple is a \"Naula\" (freshwater resource). On the day of Mahashivratri, a very crowded fair is held in the Baleshwar Temple compound.\nThe exteriors of Ratneshwar and Champawati Durga temples are carved with the different posters of the local deities.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151128011626/http://www.himvan.com/gallery/Flash/Pratinidhi%20Devalaya/Baleshwar/index.html Baleshwar Temple Photos :: Himvan.com Photo Gallery]\n* [http://www.euttaranchal.com/photo_essay/baleshwar/baleshwar_temple.php Baleshwar Temple Photo Essay]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140112145800/http://champawat.nic.in/pages/display/77-baleshwar-temple Champawar official website]"
