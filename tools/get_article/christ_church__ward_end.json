The first sod was cut on 4 March 1934 by Revd. W.E. Dugmore, vicar of St Margaret's Church, Ward End. The foundation stone was laid on 12 May 1934 by Rt. Revd Ernest Barnes Bishop of Birmingham in a ceremony conducted with Masonic rites, Freemasons being present from various lodges in the Warwickshire Province.\nThe church was built to designs by the architect Holland W. Hobbiss by the firm of William Deacon and Son of Lichfield. It was consecrated by Rt. Revd Ernest Barnes Bishop of Birmingham on 29 June 1935.\nThe church contains two sculptures by William Bloye.\nThe side chapel was fitted out in 1951 with panelling and an altar from St Stephen the Martyr's Church, Newtown Row. It became a parish in its own right on 28 May 1965.\nThe church hall was built in 1968 to designs of the architect Noel Hastilow.\nIn 2005, St Margaret's Church, Ward End was closed, and the parish was merged with Christ Church.\nOrgan\nThe organ dates from 1948 and was built by Alfred E. Davies & Son Ltd. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.\nReferences"
