He received 3735 votes, against 3467 for Progressive Conservative Russ Farrell (incumbent Liberal Gwen Charles was third with 3009).  Dewar was re-elected by a wider margin in the 1995 election, and by a comfortable margin in 1999. The NDP formed government following the 1999 election, and Dewar was appointed Government Whip.\nDewar supported Lorne Nystrom's bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party in 1995.  In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie.\nDewar was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, receiving more than 60% of the vote in his riding.\nHe was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election and in the 2011 provincial election. Dewar was the legislative assistant to the Minister of Finance. He resumed the role of Government Whip following the 2011 election and held that position until 2014.\nOn November 3, 2014, Dewar was appointed as Minister of Finance after then-Minister Jennifer Howard, along with four other ministers, resigned from cabinet over concerns about Premier Selinger's leadership.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
