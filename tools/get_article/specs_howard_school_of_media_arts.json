It was named after its founder Specs Howard and focuses on programs in radio and television broadcasting, graphic design, and digital media arts. In 2021, Specs Howard School Of Media Arts relocated to the Lawrence Technological University campus and merged into Specs @ LTU.\nHistory\nSpecs Howard was born on April 8, 1926, in Kittanning, Pennsylvania. In 1948, he received a B.A. degree in history/political science and radio speech and dramatics from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. That same year, he opened his own radio station in Pennsylvania. Later, Howard moved to Cleveland and continued his broadcast career there. In 1962, he joined forces with Harry Martin, launching The Martin and Howard Show, which remained on the air in Cleveland until the duo moved to Detroit in January 1967. The show aired for another year in Detroit.\nIn 2009, the school changed its name to the \"Specs Howard School of Media Arts\" to reflect the broader scope of training offered.\nIn 2021, Specs Howard School of Media Arts formed a partnership with Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Michigan, to become the new home of the media arts school. Lawrence Tech has had a relationship with the Specs Howard School since 2004 when an agreement allowed Specs Howard students to transfer various coursework to LTU's certificate and degree programs in media communication. Many students have taken advantage of that plan.\nNotable alumni\n* Jack O'Malley, politician and broadcaster\n* Tony Ortiz, sportscaster and sports talk show host\n* Gary Yourofsky, animal rights activist and lecturer\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ltu.edu/specs/ Official website]"
