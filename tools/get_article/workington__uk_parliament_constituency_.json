The town of Workington itself was combined with the majority of the also-abolished constituency of Copeland to form Whitehaven and Workington. The remainder, comprising the majority of the electorate, formed part of the new seat of Penrith and Solway.\n| demographics1_title1 = White\n| demographics1_info1 = 98.6%\n| demographics1_title2 = Mixed\n| demographics1_info2 = 0.6%\n| demographics1_title3 = Asian\n| demographics1_info3 = 0.5%\n| demographics1_title4 = Other\n| demographics1_info4 = 0.2%\n| demographics1_title5 = Black\n| demographics1_info5 = 0.1%\n}}\nBoundaries\n|frame=yes|frame-height=250|text=Map of boundaries 2010-2024}}\nThe constituency covered much of the north-west of Cumbria, corresponding largely to the Allerdale borough, except for the areas around Wigton and Keswick.

Workington has traditionally supported the Labour Party, although a by-election in 1976 (forced by the elevation of Fred Peart to the House of Lords) was won by Richard Page of the Conservative Party. However, the constituency reverted to type at the 1979 general election when it was regained by Labour. Labour held the seat until the 2019 general election, when Mark Jenkinson won the seat for Conservatives for the first time in forty years.\nMembers of Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1918\n| Thomas Cape\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1945\n| Fred Peart\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1976 by-election\n| Richard Page\n| Conservative\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1979\n| Dale Campbell-Savours\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 2001\n| Tony Cunningham\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 2015\n| Sue Hayman\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 2019\n| Mark Jenkinson\n| Conservative\n|-\n|\n|2024\n| colspan=\"2\" |Constituency abolished\n|}\nElections\nElections in the 2010s\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 2000s\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 1990s\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 1980s\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 1970s\nElections in the 1960s\nElections in the 1950s\n*This constituency underwent boundary changes between the 1945 and 1950 general elections and thus calculation of change in vote share is not meaningful.\nElection in the 1940s\nElections in the 1930s\nElections in the 1920s\nElection in the 1910s\n|votes  = 2,968\n|percentage  = 14.6\n}}\nStewart was endorsed by the Coalition Government but repudiated it.\nSee also\n*List of parliamentary constituencies in Cumbria\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/13478.html Workington UK Parliament constituency] (boundaries April 1997 – April 2010) at MapIt UK\n*[https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/65625.html Workington UK Parliament constituency] (boundaries April 2010 – May 2024) at MapIt UK"
