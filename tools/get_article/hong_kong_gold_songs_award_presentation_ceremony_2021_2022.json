Hosted by TVB and RTHK jointly, it recognized the best Cantopop recordings, compositions, and artistes of the eligibility year.\nBackground\nThe Hong Kong Gold Songs Award Presentation Ceremony 2021/2022 was originally two separate events: the Top Ten Chinese Songs Music Awards held by Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) since 1979, and the Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation held by TVB since 1984. On January 5, 2022, RTHK and TVB jointly held a press conference to announce the merger of the two ceremonies. The award show was initially scheduled to take place on April 3, 2022, at Kowloonbay International Trade & Exhibition Centre.\nHowever, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was rescheduled to July 24, 2022, at the TVB City. This awards ceremony marked the first time in the history of Hong Kong's pop music that two major electronic media organizations collaborated to host a music awards ceremony, with TVB inviting RTHK to co-organize the event. The awards winners were determined through public opinion surveys conducted by independent agencies, online voting by citizens, and votes from music professionals.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82\" | Category\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82\" | Artiste(s)\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82\" | Work\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\"|Top 10 Gold Song Awards\n| Joyce Cheng\n| \"First Tear Last Salute\" ()\n|rowspan=\"34\"|\n|-\n| Gigi Yim\n| \"Noble Truth\" ()\n|-\n| Mike Tsang\n| \"I'm Not As Good\" ()\n|-\n| Edan Lui\n| \"Mr. E's Series of Unfortunate Events\" ()\n|-\n| Hins Cheung\n| \"What Separates Us/The Way We Were\" ()\n|-\n| Vincy Chan\n| \"Sea of Thorns\" ()\n|-\n| MC\n| \"Pillow Talk\" ()\n|-\n| AGA\n| \"City Pop\"\n|-\n| Janice Vidal\n| \"It's OK To Be Sad\"\n|-\n| Chantel Yiu\n| \"So, This Is Love\" ()\n|-\n| Best Male Singer Award\n| Hins Cheung\n|-\n| Best Female Singer Award\n| Joyce Cheng\n|-\n| Best Group Award\n| Supper Moment\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Best Singer-songwriter Awards\n| Jay Fung\n|-\n| Phil Lam\n|-\n| Mischa Ip\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Best Male Newcomer Awards\n| Mike Tsang\n|-\n| MC\n|-\n| ANSONBEAN\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Best Female Newcomer Awards\n| Gigi Yim\n|-\n| Chantel Yiu\n|-\n| Gigi Cheung\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Most Improved Artists of the Year\n| Mischa Ip\n|-\n| Kako Hung\n|-\n| Zaina Sze\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| Best TV Series Theme Songs\n| JW\n| \"I Don't Want To Leave\" ()\n|-\n| Kayee Tam\n| \"Never Happening\" ()\n|-\n| Gin Lee & Michelle Siu\n| \"This Kind Of Love\" ()\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Best Album Awards\n| Hins Cheung\n| The Brightest Darkness\n|-\n| Hana Kuk\n| ''Can't Let You Go ()\n|-\n| MIRROR\n| One and All''\n|-\n|Best Group Song\n| MIRROR\n| \"BOSS\"\n|-\n|Best Mandarin Song Award\n| Vivian Koo\n| \"Stubborn\" ()\n|-\n| Gold Melody Song Award\n| Jacky Cheung & Gin Lee\n| \"When The Sun Rises\" ()\n|}\nViewership\nThe show achieved a 19.1 rating points, which translates to 1.24 million viewers.\nReferences"
