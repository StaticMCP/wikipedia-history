They were the founders and the ruling dynasty of the kingdom of Macedon from about 700 to 310 BC.\nTheir tradition, as described in ancient Greek historiography, traced their origins to Argos, of Peloponnese in Southern Greece, hence the name Argeads or Argives. Initially, the Argeadae were the rulers of the tribe of the same name, (Argead Macedonians) who prevailed in early Emathia. By the time of Philip II they had expanded their reign further, to include under the rule of Macedonia all Upper Macedonian states. The family's most celebrated members were Philip II of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great, under whose leadership the kingdom of Macedonia gradually gained predominance throughout Greece, defeated the Achaemenid Empire and expanded as far as Egypt and India. The mythical founder of the Argead dynasty is King Caranus. The Argeads claimed descent from Heracles through his great-great-grandson Temenus, also king of Argos.\nOrigin\n; .\n| footer_align = left\n| image1 = Argos, Triobol, c.270-250 BC, HGC 5-670.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| caption1 =\n| image2 = Amyntas II, Bronze, c.395-393 BC, HGC 3-I-820.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n| caption2 =\n}}\nThe words Argead and Argive derive (via Latin Argīvus) from the Greek  (Argeios meaning \"of or from Argos\"), which is first attested to in Homer where it was also used as a collective designation for the Greeks (, Argive Danaans). The Argead dynasty claimed descent from the Temenids of Argos, in the Peloponnese, whose legendary ancestor was Temenus, the great-great-grandson of Heracles.\nIn the excavations of the royal palace at Aigai (near modern Vergina), Manolis Andronikos discovered in the \"tholos\" room (according to some scholars \"tholos\" was the throne room) a Greek inscription relating to that belief. This is testified by Herodotus, in The Histories, where he mentions that three brothers of the lineage of Temenus, Gauanes, Aeropus and Perdiccas, fled from Argos to the Illyrians and then to Upper Macedonia, to a town called Lebaea, where they served the king. The latter asked them to leave his territory, believing in an omen that something great would happen to Perdiccas. The boys went near the garden of Midas, above which mount Bermio stands. There they made their abode and slowly formed their own kingdom.\nHerodotus also relates the incident of the participation of Alexander I of Macedon in the Olympic Games in 504 or 500 BC where the participation of the Macedonian king was contested by participants on the grounds that he was not Greek. The Hellanodikai, however, after examining his Argead claim confirmed that the Macedonian kings were Greeks and allowed him to participate. According to the Greek scholar M. Sakellariou, the common name of Temenids between the Macedonian dynasty and the Doric dynasty of Argos had its origin to the relation between the tribe of Makednoi, that later became the Makedones, and the Dorians.\n, Peloponnese, to Macedonia according to Herodotus.]]\nThucydides, in the History of the Peloponnesian War, the Argeads were originally Temenids from Argos, who descended from the highlands to Lower Macedonia, expelled the Pierians from Pieria and acquired in Paionia a narrow strip along the river Axios extending to Pella and the sea. They also added Mygdonia in their territory through the expulsion of the Edoni, Eordians, and Almopians.\nAnother theory supported by the Greek historian Miltiades Hatzopoulos, following the opinion of the ancient author Appian, is that the Argead dynasty actually came from Argos Orestikon. Miltiades Hatzopoulos has suggested that the Macedonian dialect of the 4th century BC, as attested in the Pella curse tablet, was a sort of Macedonian 'koine' resulting from the encounter of the idiom of the 'Aeolic'-speaking populations around Mount Olympus and the Pierian Mountains with the Northwest Greek-speaking Argead Makedones hailing from Argos Orestikon, who founded the kingdom of Lower Macedonia. However, according to Hatzopoulos, B. Helly expanded and improved his own earlier suggestion and presented the hypothesis of a (North-)'Achaean'  substratum extending as far north as the head of the Thermaic Gulf, which had a continuous relation, in prehistoric times both in Thessaly and Macedonia, with the Northwest Greek-speaking populations living on the other side of the Pindus mountain range, and contacts became cohabitation  when the Argead Makedones completed their wandering from Orestis to Lower Macedonia in the 7th c. BC. According to this hypothesis, Hatzopoulos concludes that the Ancient Macedonian Greek dialect of the historical period, which is attested in inscriptions, is a sort of koine resulting from the interaction and the influences of various elements, the most important of which are the North-Achaean substratum, the Northwest Greek idiom of the Argead Macedonians, and the Thracian and Phrygian adstrata. Borza has argued that \"the 'highlanders' or Makedones of the mountainous regions of western Macedonia may have been derived from northwest Greek stock\", and that \"those who emerged into the lowlands were to be distinguished from the rest of the Makedones who remained in the mountain cantons by the name Argeadae\".\nHistory\nSuccession disputes\nThe death of the king almost invariably triggered dynastic disputes and often a war of succession between members of the Argead family, leading to political and economic instability. These included:\n* Six-year Macedonian interregnum (399–393 BCE), after the death of king Archelaus, between Orestes, Aeropus II, Amyntas II and Pausanias\n* Macedonian war of succession (393–392 BCE), after the death of king Pausanias, between Amyntas III and Argaeus II\n* Macedonian war of succession (369–368 BCE), after the death of king Amyntas III, between Ptolemy of Aloros and Alexander II of Macedon\n* Macedonian war of succession (360–359 BCE), after the death of king Perdiccas III, between Philip II (who deposed Amyntas IV), Argeus (supported by Athens), Pausanias (supported by Thrace) and Archelaus (supported by the Chalcidian League)\n* Wars of the Diadochi (323–277 BCE), after the death of king Alexander the Great, between his Diadochi (\"Successors\")\nAdditionally, long-established monarchs could still face a rebellion by a relative when the former's kingship was perceived to be weak. An example was Philip's rebellion against his older brother, king Perdiccas II, in the prelude to the Peloponnesian War (433–431 BCE).\nList of rulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |\n|+Argead Rulers\n! width=\"160px\" |Image !! align=\"center\" width=\"123px\" |Reign !! width=\"500px\" |Monarch Name\n!Comments\n|-\n| ||-778 BC || Karanos\n|Founder of the Argead dynasty and the first king of Macedon.

Robin Lane Fox, for example, refutes Nicholas Hammond's claim that Ptolemy of Aloros was Amyntas II's son, arguing that Ptolemy was neither his son nor an Argead. Consequently, the charts below do not account for every chronological, genealogical, and dynastic complexity. Instead, they represent one common reconstruction of the Argeads advanced by historians such as Hammond, Elizabeth Carney, and Joseph Roisman.\n| boxstyle_Pe1=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Arg1=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Ph1=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Ae1=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Alc=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Am1=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Alx1=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Pe2=border-width:3px| Men=Menelaus| boxstyle_Men=border-width:1px| Amy=Amyntas| boxstyle_Amy=border-width:1px}}\n| boxstyle_Arc=border-width:3px| Ae2=Aeropus II| boxstyle_Ae2=border-width:3px| Arg2=Argaeus II| boxstyle_Arg2=border-width:3px| Am2=Amyntas II| boxstyle_Am2=border-width:3px| Arr=Arrhidaeus| boxstyle_Arr=border-width:1px}}\n| boxstyle_Ore=border-width:3px| Pau=Pausanias| boxstyle_Pau=border-width:3px| Pto=Ptolemy of Aloros| boxstyle_Pto=border-width:3px| Am3=Amyntas III| boxstyle_Am3=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Alx2=border-width:3px| Pe3=Perdiccas III| boxstyle_Pe3=border-width:3px| Ph2=Philip II| boxstyle_Ph2=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Am4=border-width:3px| Ph3=Philip III Arrhidaeus| boxstyle_Ph3=border-width:3px| Alx3=Alexander the Great| boxstyle_Alx3=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Alx4=border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Per=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Arg=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Phi=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Aer=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px}}\n| boxstyle_Alc=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px}}\n&nbsp;512–498/7| boxstyle_Am=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px}}\n&nbsp;498/7–454| boxstyle_Alx=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px| Gyg=Gygaea∞&nbsp;Bubares| boxstyle_Gyg=border-width:1px}}\n&nbsp;454–413| boxstyle_Pe2=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px| Men=Menelaus| boxstyle_Men=border-width:1px| Amy=Amyntas| boxstyle_Amy=border-width:1px| Phl=Philip| boxstyle_Phl=border-width:1px| Al2=Alcetas| boxstyle_Al2=border-width:1px| Str=Stratonice∞&nbsp;Seuthes II| boxstyle_Str=border-width:1px| And=Amyntas| boxstyle_And=border-width:1px}}\n&nbsp;394/3| boxstyle_Am2=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px| Arr=Arrhidaeus| so2=sons| boxstyle_so2=border-width:1px| so3=sons| boxstyle_so3=border-width:1px}}\n&nbsp;393 BC?| boxstyle_Arg2=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px| Pau=Pausanias&nbsp;394/3| boxstyle_Pau=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px| Pto=Ptolemy''&nbsp;368–365| boxstyle_Pto=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px| Am3=&nbsp;393–369| boxstyle_Am3=background:LemonChiffon;border-width:3px| wfe=1.
