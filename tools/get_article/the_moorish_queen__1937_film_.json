When they arrived at the party though, the love changes into a quarrel in which Coral must calm down his opponent and Esteban is assigned to solve the matter. As expected, the fight ends with Esteban shooting his opponent and is sent to jail. Coral, saddened that his friend is confined, visits Esteban's brother in a Sevillian house to whom he tells of Esteban's deprivation of liberty. Their friendship will give rise to presumptuous Don Juans to launch their conquest for freedom and tales of legends.\nCast\n*María Arias as Coral\n*Raquel Rodrigo as Mercedes\n*Alejandrina Caro as Doña Juana\n*Pedro Terol as Esteban\n*Antonio Gil Varela 'Varillas' as Don Nuez\n*Valeriano Ruiz París as Miguel Ángel\n*Erasmo Pascual as Cotufa\n*José Córdoba as Peleón\n*Carmen Vázquez as ballerina\n*Capelillo as singer\n*Manolito Heras as The Boy of the Birds\n*J.
