The republic was proclaimed on September 23, 1868, but was suppressed by Spanish forces within a day. Though it lasted only a few hours, the event is considered a foundational moment in the island’s struggle for independence and is a significant symbol of Puerto Rican nationalism.\nBackground\nThe Grito de Lares rebellion was the culmination of growing discontent with Spanish colonial rule in the mid-19th century. Economic hardship, high taxes, and the persistent issue of slavery fueled a desire for independence. The rebellion was organized by a secret society of separatists known as the \"Comité Revolucionario de Puerto Rico,\" which was based in exile in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The group was led by Ramón Emeterio Betances, often called the \"Father of the Puerto Rican Nation,\" who penned the \"Ten Commandments of Free Men\" as a manifesto for the revolution. The plan was to launch a coordinated attack on various towns to declare the independence of Puerto Rico. However, a Spanish informant learned of the plan, forcing the revolutionaries to accelerate their timeline.\nOn the night of September 23, 1868, approximately 400 to 600 rebels, many of them enslaved people and poor laborers, gathered in the town of Lares. They were led by Manuel Rojas and Juan de Mata Terreforte, and carried machetes and other simple weapons. They took control of the town, looting Spanish-owned stores, and imprisoned local Spanish authorities. At around 2:00 a.m., the revolutionaries proclaimed the Republic of Puerto Rico in the town's church, with Francisco Ramírez Medina as president of the provisional government. The rebels also freed enslaved people they encountered, a key objective of the uprising.\nFlag\nThe flag of the Grito de Lares was designed by Ramón Emeterio Betances and sewn by Mariana Bracetti, a leading figure in the rebellion known as \"Brazo de Oro\" (Golden Arm). The flag featured a white Latin cross, a symbol of the revolutionaries' faith, dividing two red and two blue sections. A single white star in the upper left corner represented liberty and freedom. The flag is a powerful symbol of Puerto Rican identity and has been adopted by various independence movements throughout history.\nSuppression\nDespite their initial success in Lares, the rebellion was swiftly suppressed. The revolutionaries, hoping to expand their control, marched towards the neighboring town of San Sebastián del Pepino. They were met with fierce resistance from the Spanish militia. The rebels, who were poorly armed, were quickly overwhelmed and forced to retreat to Lares.\nThe Spanish authorities, who were prepared for the uprising due to the leaked information, mobilized a significant force. The rebels scattered, and within hours, the Republic of Puerto Rico had ceased to exist. Hundreds of rebels were captured and imprisoned, and many were sentenced to death. However, due to public pressure and international criticism, the Spanish government eventually pardoned most of the rebels. The fate of Francisco Ramírez Medina remains unclear, but he is believed to have been captured and later exiled.\nLegacy\nAlthough it was a military failure, the Grito de Lares had a profound and lasting impact on Puerto Rican history. It was the first major challenge to Spanish rule and demonstrated the desire for independence among the Puerto Rican people. The event is a cornerstone of Puerto Rican nationalism and is commemorated annually on September 23. The flag of the Grito de Lares and the figure of Betances are powerful symbols of the island's enduring quest for self-determination.\nSee also\n• Grito de Lares\n• List of presidents of Puerto Rico\n• Timeline of Puerto Rican history\nReferences\n• Pérez-Moris, José, and Luis Cueto y González.
