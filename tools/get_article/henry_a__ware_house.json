Ware House is a historic house located at 460 Bellefontaine Street in Pasadena, California. Prominent Pasadena architectural firm Greene & Greene designed the American Craftsman style house, which was built in 1913. The house's roof has a complex gabled form typical of Craftsman designs, and its eaves are overhanging with exposed rafters and beams. A large front-facing gable features a stepped brick chimney, while a one-story bay includes Tudor-inspired half-timbering.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 15, 2004.\nReferences"
