Published by Historica Canada, the Minutes integrate Canadian history, folklore and myths into dramatic storylines. Like the Canada Vignettes of the 1970s, the Minutes themselves have become a part of Canadian culture and been the subject of academic studies as well as parody.\nThe Minutes were first introduced on March 31, 1991, as part of a one-off history quiz show hosted by Wayne Rostad. Originally distributed to schools, they appeared frequently on Canadian television and in cinemas before feature films, and were later available online and on DVD. \"Radio minutes\" have also been made. From 1991 to 1995, 50 episodes aired. In 2012, new Minutes were produced in the lead-up to Canada's sesquicentennial (150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation) in 2017.\nThe Minutes have featured appearances by some of Canada's best-known personalities, including Jared Keeso, Michael Shanks, Calum Worthy, Colm Feore, Dan Aykroyd, and Kate Nelligan. Voice-over end narration for the Heritage Minutes has been provided by such recognizable voices as Peter Mansbridge, k.d. lang, Adrienne Clarkson, and Lloyd Robertson.\nBackground\nThe thirteen original short films were broken up and run between shows on CBC Television and the CTV Network. The continued broadcast of the Minutes and the production of new ones was pioneered by Charles Bronfman's CRB Foundation (subsequently The Historica Dominion Institute), Canada Post (with Bell Canada being a later sponsor), Power Broadcasting (the broadcasting arm of the Power Corporation of Canada), and the National Film Board. They were devised, developed, and largely narrated (as well as scripted) by noted Canadian broadcaster Patrick Watson, while the producer of the series was Robert Guy Scully.\nIn 2009, \"The Historica Foundation of Canada\" merged with \"The Dominion Institute\" to become \"The Historica-Dominion Institute\", a national charitable organization. In September 2013, the organization changed its name to \"Historica Canada\". While the foundations have not paid networks to air Minutes, in the early years they have paid to have them run in cinema theatres across the country. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has ruled that Heritage Minutes are an \"on-going dramatic series\"; each vignette thus counts as ninety-seconds of a station's Canadian content requirements.\nLaura Secord warning the British (Lieutenant – James FitzGibbon) and First Nations of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams June 1813. By Lorne Kidd Smith, .]]\nThe first sets of Heritage Minutes were released in five segments between 1991 and 2000. A set of eight new Heritage Minutes, covering military moments in Canadian history, were released in 2005. In 2012, two new Minutes were created on the War of 1812 in anticipation of the war's bicentenary, and in 2014 two more Minutes were released on John A. Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier that had been filmed in and around Toronto in September 2013. To honour the centenary of the start of World War I two Minutes were released: one on the Winnipeg Falcons in 2014 and one on Canadian Nursing Sisters in early 2015. In September 2015, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of Terry Fox's run to conquer cancer, Historica released a \"Minute\" on Fox's inspirational run.\nFebruary 2016 saw the release of a \"Minute\" on Viola Desmond, a trailblazing black female entrepreneur from Halifax who spoke out against racial discrimination in Nova Scotia. On June 21, the 20th anniversary of National Aboriginal Day, Historica Canada released two new Minutes. The first tells the story of Chanie \"Charlie\" Wenjack, whose death sparked the first inquest into the treatment of Indigenous children in Canadian residential schools. The second, Naskumituwin, highlights the making of Treaty 9 from the perspective of historical witness George Spence, an 18-year-old Cree hunter from Albany, James Bay. On October 19, Historica Canada released another Heritage Minute that shows a story about an Inuk artist named Kenojuak Ashevak. It is also the first Heritage minute that is narrated on not just its official languages (English and French) but also a third language, where this Heritage Minute is narrated in Inuktitut.\nA 2012 Ipsos Reid poll of 3,900 Canadians selected the five most popular Minutes. Tied for first place were the episodes on Jackie Robinson and the Halifax Explosion, followed by Jennie Kidd Trout, Winnie-the-Pooh and Laura Secord.\nList\nOf the over 100 \"Heritage Minutes\" available online, one on Canadian peacekeeping in Cyprus was pulled from broadcast shortly after its 1991 premiere, and was only posted on Historica Canada YouTube channel in 2016, while being omitted from the listing on \"Historica Canada\" official website. According to The Canadian Encyclopedia published by Historica Canada:\nIn 2020, three Heritage Minutes were deleted from Historica's website and Youtube channel - Louis Riel (1991), Grey Owl (1999), and Sir John A. Macdonald (2014). Historica told CTV News in 2024 that the removal of the Louis Riel Heritage Minute was due to a lack of consultation with the Métis community at the time of production, and concerns about presenting the Heritage Minute in classrooms, due to it graphically showing the hanging of the Metis Leader. However, the Manitoba Metis Federation stated that Historica had not consulted with them about removing the Heritage Minute and expressed support for the violent reality of the depiction.  The Grey Owl Heritage Minute was later restored to the Historica website.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\" style=text-align:left;\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Episode\n! scope=\"col\" | Released\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Peacemaker||1992||The formation of the Iroquois Confederacy presented by a First Nations grandfather explaining the significance of the Great Peace to his granddaughter.\n|-\n| Vikings ||1992||L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland is settled by Norsemen (Vikings) around the year 1000 CE.\n|-\n| John Cabot ||1991|| Italian navigator and explorer John Cabot discovers the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.\n|-\n| Jacques Cartier ||1991|| French navigator and explorer Jacques Cartier misunderstands some Natives resulting in the name Canada.\n|-\n|Jean Nicolet ||1992||French coureur des bois and explorer Jean Nicolet becomes the first European to reach Lake Michigan, but thinks it's the Pacific.\n|-\n| Governor Frontenac ||1992||New France, under the leadership of French governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac, repels the British invasion at the Battle of Quebec (1690) (narration was later added to this Minute in order to clarify the story).\n|-\n| Syrup ||1997||A First Nations family teaches early settlers how to make maple syrup.\n|-\n| Laura Secord ||1993||Canadian heroine Laura Secord aids the British in the War of 1812 with an overland trek to warn of an American military advance.\n|-\n| Responsible Government ||1991|| Queen Victoria decides to grant Canada responsible government after the crushing of the Rebellions of 1837.\n|-\n| Baldwin & LaFontaine ||1992|| Lawyer and politician Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine build interlingual cooperation.\n|-\n| Orphans ||1991||French Canadian families adopt Irish orphans in the 1850s while allowing them to keep their original names.\n|-\n| Underground Railroad ||1991||An African American escapes to Canada along the Underground Railroad.\n|-\n| Etienne Parent ||1990|| Journalist and government official Étienne Parent demands equality for French and English.\n|-\n| Hart & Papineau ||1995||The efforts of politician and lawyer Louis-Joseph Papineau give full equality of religion to Jews in Canada.\n|-\n|The Paris Crew ||1995|| The surprise victory of the Paris Crew, a group of unheralded Canadian rowers, at the 1867 World Championships.\n|-\n| Joseph Tyrrell ||1992|| Geologist and cartographer Joseph Tyrrell discovers a plethora of dinosaur bones in Alberta (see Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology).\n|-\n| Basketball ||1992|| Sports coach James Naismith's invention of basketball is featured.\n|-\n| Joseph Casavant ||1992||Joseph Casavant, world-renowned organ maker is featured.\n|-\n| Emily Carr ||1992||The art of Emily Carr is featured.\n|-\n| Soddie ||1991||Prairie settlers build a house of sod (see Addison Sod House).\n|-\n| Midwife ||1992||A look at the importance of midwives in early Canada.\n|-\n|Saguenay Fire ||1992||The 1870 fire in Saguenay is featured.\n|-\n| Sandford Fleming ||1990|| Engineer and inventor Sandford Fleming develops the system of international standard time.\n|-\n| Nitro ||1990|| A young Chinese Canadian risks his life to set a dangerous nitroglycerine charge while helping to build the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s.\n|-\n| Jennie Trout ||1991||Jennie Trout becomes Canada's first woman doctor.\n|-\n| Rural Teacher ||1992||Teacher Kate Henderson sways school trustees to embrace new methods, and the event is represented in the famous painting by Robert Harris, A Meeting of the School Trustees (see image at top).\n|-\n| Louis Riel||1991 ||The achievements and execution of political and spiritual leader Louis Riel are featured.\n|-\n| Sitting Bull ||1990||Native American Chief Sitting Bull seeks refuge in Canada (starring Graham Greene as Sitting Bull).\n|-\n| Les Voltigeurs de Québec ||1990||The rehearsal for the first performance of O Canada.\n|-\n| Grey Owl ||1999 ||Englishman Archie Belaney (played by Pierce Brosnan) rises to prominence as a notable author and lecturer after he took on the First Nations identity called Grey Owl.\n|-\n| Frontier College ||1997||Frontier College educates those away from the urban centres.\n|-\n| Sam Steele ||1993||Major-General and police official Sam Steele (portrayed by Alan Scarfe) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police bars an unruly American (portrayed by Don S.
