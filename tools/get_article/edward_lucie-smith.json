He has been highly prolific in these fields, writing or editing over a hundred books, his subjects gradually shifting around the late 1960s from mostly literature to mostly art.\nBiography\nLucie-Smith was born in Kingston, Jamaica, the son of Mary Frances (née Lushington) and John Dudley Lucie-Smith. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1946. He was educated at The King's School, Canterbury, then spent time in Paris. In  1954, he received a Bachelor of Arts from  Merton College, Oxford.\nAfter serving in the Royal Air Force as an education officer and working as a copywriter, Lucie-Smith became a full-time writer (as well as anthologist and photographer). He succeeded Philip Hobsbaum in organising The Group, a London-centred poets' group.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1964. With Bernard Stone and George Rapp he was a director of the small press Turret  Books, founded in 1965 in London. Wallace Southam set some of his poetry to music for Turret and Jupiter Records.\nAt the beginning of the 1980s he conducted several series of interviews, Conversations with Artists, for BBC Radio 3. He was a contributor to The London Magazine, in which he wrote art reviews, and wrote regularly for the independent magazine ArtReview from the 1960s until the 2000s. A prolific writer, he has written more than one hundred books in total on a variety of subjects, chiefly art history as well as biographies and poetry.\nIn addition he has curated a number of art exhibitions, including three Peter Moores projects at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, The New British Painting (1988–1990) and two retrospectives at the New Orleans Museum of Art. He is a curator of the Bermondsey Project Space.\nIn recent years Lucie-Smith has been promoting drawings attributed to Francis Bacon owned by Italian journalist Cristiano Lovatelli Ravarino. However, Christie's, Sotheby's and the Francis Bacon Estate have not authenticated these works known as the 'Francis Bacon Italian Drawings'. Martin Harrison, the editor of the Francis Bacon: Catalogue Raisonné, does not include 'The Francis Bacon Italian Drawings' and does not see the hand of Bacon in these drawings.\nHis uncle Euan Lucie-Smith was one of the first mixed-heritage infantry officers in a regular British Army regiment, and the first killed in World War I.\nBibliography\nPoetry and fiction\n*\n*A Tropical Childhood and Other Poems (1961)\n*Confessions & Histories (1964)\n*Penguin Modern Poets 6 (1964; with Jack Clemo and George MacBeth)\n*A Game of French and English (1965) poems\n*Jazz for the N.U.F.
