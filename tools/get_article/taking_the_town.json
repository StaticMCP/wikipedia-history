It was released in April 1984 as the lead single from their third studio album Sidewalk. It peaked at No. 29 on the Australian chart.\nPromotional music video\nThe music video for \"Taking the Town\" was filmed by Russell Mulcahy in Sydney, and used similar effects to Elton John's \"Sad Songs (Say So Much)\", filmed in Rushcutters Bay also by Russell Mulcahy when John was in Sydney for his first marriage. It did not feature Icehouse's then-keyboardist Andy Qunta, instead it featured a look-alike with his back to the camera.\nTrack listing\n* 12\" Single\n# \"Taking the Town (Extended Dance Mix)\" – 5:11\n# \"Dance On\" – 3:54\n# \"Taking the Town\" – 3:32\n* 7\" Single\n# \"Taking the Town\" – 3:32\n# \"Java\" – 4:41\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1984)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australian (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|29\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
