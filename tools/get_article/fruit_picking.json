Some farms market \"You-Pick\" for orchards, such as the tradition of Apple and Orange picking in North America, as a form of value-add agritourism.\nTypes of fruit\nApple picking\n, the former President of Finland, with his family picking apples in the 1930s.]]\n]]\nApple picking is an activity found at apple farms. Apple orchards may be opened to the public, allowing consumers to pick their own apples or purchase pre-picked apples.\nAlthough this is ultimately a method of purchasing apples, it is often a social activity as well. Apple picking is often a very popular dating ritual in the American Midwest. Apple orchards catering to a family outing will provide additional activities beyond the picking of apples. Many have petting zoos, restaurants and country shops that sell related products such as home-made jams and jellies.  This aspect of the activity is especially popular in the Northeastern United States & Southern Ontario and Southern Québec in Canada.\nThe apples that fall off the trees are often used to make apple cider. Apple cider is a juice made grinding the apples, then pressing out the juice.\nThere are several tests that are used to determine apple fruit maturity, and these will be described throughout this article. But before performing any measurement, the first step is to know how to collect a representative fruit sample from the orchard block.\nWorkers\n, Scotland, March 2009]]\nMost fruit picking is done by migrant workers, who can be paid relatively low wages. In California, Mexican migrants most frequently do the work. There has been much controversy about replacing workers with automation.  It puts many out of work.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, people engaging in backpacker tourism do a lot of the fruit-picking work while on a working holiday visa. The Australian government encourages people on this visa to do this sort of work for a minimum of three months so they can add another year to their visa. This benefit does not apply to all parts of Australia - one must undertake work in selected post-code areas to become eligible for the extra year.\nMonoculture orchards can face particular labor-timetable issues.\nAutomation\nAs labor costs are still quite expensive in fruit picking, robots are being designed that can replace humans for this kind of works. The research is still in full progress, especially as the robots need to be carefully designed so that they do not bruise the fruit while picking. One solution is the use of suction grippers. Citrus fruit robot pickers have thus far been the focus of research and development, but cherry pickers are also being researched.\nFruit picking in art\nFile:The Fall of Man by Lukas Cranach.jpg|Lucas Cranach the Elder, Paradise (detail), 1530\nFile:Christian Berentz - Flowers, Fruit with a Woman Picking Grapes - WGA1936.jpg|Christian Berentz, Flowers, Fruit with a Woman Picking Grapes, 1696\nFile:William-adolphe bouguereau the grape picker.jpg|William-Adolphe Bouguereau, The grape picker, 1875\nFile:Gauguin La récolte.jpg|Paul Gauguin, La récolte or Homme cueillant des fruits, 1897\nFile:Rippl Fruit-picking Women.jpg|József Rippl-Rónai, Fruit-picking Women ('Gyümölcsszedő hölgyek)\nFile:August Macke Obsternte 1913.jpg|August Macke, Obsternte, 1913\nFile:Frantisek Jakub Obsternte.jpg|František Jakub (Czech, 1875 – 1940), Obsternte, by 1950\nSee also\n* Cherry picker\n* Working Holiday Visa\n* Peach wall\nReferences\n12. \"Fruit Harvest - Determining Apple Fruit Maturity and Optimal Harvest Date\". extension.psu.edu.
