It features guest appearances from Mumia Abu-Jamal, Akir, C-Rayz Walz, Diabolic, Jean Grae, Loucipher, Poison Pen, Pumpkinhead and Tonedeff.\nRevolutionary Vol. 2 attacks the United States government, especially the Bush administration. Immortal Technique claimed in an interview to have sold more than 85,000 copies. The album features Mumia Abu-Jamal, who introduces the album and also provides a speech about hip hop's relationship to homeland security. Issues repeatedly discussed on the album include poverty, drug trade, slave labor, censorship, corporate control over the media (including hip hop), the September 11th World Trade Center attacks, racism, the prison industrial complex and class struggle.\nRevolutionary Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 were re-pressed in 2004 via Babygrande Records.\nTrack listing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.viperrecords.com/ Viper Records official website]"
