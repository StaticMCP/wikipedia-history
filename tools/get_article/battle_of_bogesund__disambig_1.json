In 1520, Christian's army of mercenaries had landed in Sweden, seeking to consolidate Christian's powers over Sweden within the Kalmar Union and to unseat the rebellious Swedish viceroy Sten Sture the Younger. On the ice of lake Åsunden near Bogesund, Christian's army led by Otte Krumpen was intercepted by a force led by Sten Sture.\nLittle is known of the details of the battle. At an early stage, a cannonball ricochetted off the ice, hitting Sten Sture in the leg and killing his horse. Deprived of their leadership, Sture's forces (mostly armed peasants) fell into disarray and fled. Sture himself retreated towards Stockholm, but died of his wounds on the ice of lake Mälaren on February 5.\nThe anti-union resistance was continued by Sture's widow Christina Gyllenstierna and ultimately Gustav Vasa.\nSee also\n*Stockholm Bloodbath\n*Christian II of Denmark\n*Gustav I of Sweden\nReferences"
