Over 1,300 audience members were in attendance and the show was broadcast live online.\nThe show was met with technical difficulties and other disruptions throughout the ceremony and was criticized for its humour which was viewed as unfunny, crude, and deprecatory of internet culture.

The show was also interrupted by streakers as part of a stunt by Best Reality or Documentary Web Series nominee Streak to Win''. The poor reception of the event, and the surrounding controversy, resulted in the International Academy of Web Television separating from the Streamys to create its own awards, the IAWTV Awards, and a two-year hiatus of the Streamys.\nMany online content creators, including iJustine and Chris Hardwick, felt that the ceremony did not represent online content creation and worried that it would be a setback for the medium being taken seriously. iJustine said that the show's skits had made her feel uncomfortable and condemned the excessive vulgarity, saying that she had left the event \"feeling confused, embarrassed and a bunch of other emotions that I still have yet to put my finger on.\" Jim Louderback, CEO of the multi-channel network Revision3, called the show a \"misogynistic, puerile, protracted and poorly executed event\" and criticised one of the monologues that \"went beyond poking fun at the industry, and was more like a spit in the face.\" YouTuber Michael Buckley also criticized the event in a tweet saying \"All of the technical problems were one thing but it seemed like the jokes were picking on the internet – not CELEBRATING what we do.\" Erin Broadley of LA Weekly similarly opined \"The technical difficulties were forgivable for an event only two years young; it was the tone of the program that was most upsetting to people, who saw last year's optimism replaced by self-deprecating humor and masturbation jokes\". Due to nominees and award winners' disappointment with the show, an unofficial redo of the ceremony was held at the ACME Comedy Theatre.\nSee also\n*List of Streamy Award winners\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.streamys.org Streamy Awards website]\n*"
