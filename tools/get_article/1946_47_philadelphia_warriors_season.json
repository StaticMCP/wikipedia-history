For the Warriors' first game ever played on November 7, 1946, a notable event would occur late in that game where after five of the Pittsburgh Ironmen's players (which involved their leading scorer Moe Becker alongside John Abramovic, Press Maravich, Ed Melvin, and John Mills, with Mike Bytzura being dangerously close to joining them himself also) fouled out of the game (back when fouling out involved five fouls instead of the six fouls the league implements to this day going forward) and opposing head coach Paul Birch refused the Warriors' offer to reinstate one of their disqualified players back into the game, the two teams decided to finish the game off with their teams playing the rest of the game in a four-on-four manner as opposed to the usual five-on-five display, which led to the Warriors winning 81–75. Despite later finishing the season in second place within the Eastern Division behind only the Washington Capitols (who had the best record in league history throughout the BAA/NBA's first 20 years of history and the least amount of losses recorded in a season there until 1996), the Warriors ended up finishing the season winning their first league championship by winning the inaugural 1947 BAA Finals (now known as the NBA Finals) 4–1 over the Chicago Stags (who continued existing as a franchise until 1950).\nRoster\nRegular season\nSeason standings\nGame log\n{|class=\"wikitable\"
