      "text": "# Dàomíng Kingdom\n\n}}\nDàomíng Kingdom () was an ancient kingdom mentioned in the Chinese text, , written by Zhōu Zhì-zhōng () during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368 CE). It was described as the kingdom of people who do not wear clothes, like the barbarians. When they see people wearing clothes, they laugh at them. They have no salt or iron, and use bamboo crossbows to shoot insects and fish. To the northeast, it met the kingdom of Lí Zhōu () which is now Central Vietnam, and to the south, bordered Zhenla, which itself adjacent to the Chē qú Kingdom () in the east, and was the vassal of Funan.\nNo further information about the Dàomíng Kingdom has been found, and its identification is uncertain. Some believe Dàomíng was located in southeastern Laos or along the coast of Myanmar. Some say it was in the northern part of Laos. Nonetheless, the southern Laos theory is now more widely accepted.\nSome people think it is another name for the Tángmíng Kingdom () of the Liao people that was founded around the 1st century CE, centered at Zhenning, and also covered the northern part of Laos.\nReferences"
