On 27 March, the competition, known as the Intrust Super Cup due to sponsorship from Intrust Super, was cancelled after one round due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first time the competition would not be played out since its inaugural season in 1996.\nTeams\nIn 2020, the lineup of teams remained unchanged for the sixth consecutive year.
