Sanadhya Brahmins are called Belwars or naiks mainly in Sitapur, Lakhimpur, Hardoi, Barabanki, Gonda and Gorakhpur. They like to be called Bilwar or Bailwar as it is a matter of pride for them. According to caste census of 1931,\nbelwars of hardoi get the paelagans and namaskars of other brahmanas.\nOrigin\nThe Belwars are Sanadhya Brahmins from Awadh who are small but wealthy community whose chief occupation was trade in cattle and grains.\nPresent circumstances\nThe Belwar are strictly endogamous, and practice clan exogamy. They are Hindu, and Mahadev is their clan deity. Their customs are similar to other Awadh Brahmin communities. They are generally vegetarian.\nThe Belwar are mainly a landowning community, but are now being urbanised. Those in rural Awadh live in multi-caste villages, but occupy distinct quarters. Each of their settlements contains an informal caste council, known as a biradari panchayat. The panchayat acts as an instrument of social control, dealing with issues such as divorce and adultery.\nReferences"
