It was fought between Federalist forces led by Facundo Quiroga and Unitarian forces under Governor Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid, near the city of San Miguel de Tucumán.\nQuiroga was the victor, forcing Lamadrid to resign and go into exile in Bolivia, leaving the government of Tucumán Province in the hands of the Federalists.\nBackground\nAfter Facundo Quiroga's victory in the Battle of El Tala in 1826, in which he thought Lamadrid had died, the leader from La Rioja Province went to Cuyo, where he assured the triumph of the Federalist party.\nMeanwhile, the wounded governor of Tucumán Province received support from Buenos Aires, where President Bernardino Rivadavia urged him to overthrow the provincial governments opposed to his rule. Lamadrid invaded Catamarca Province for the third time, where he restored a Unitarian government.\nHe returned to face Facundo Quiroga, supported Juan Felipe Ibarra, Governor of Santiago del Estero Province.\nHe advanced to the outskirts of the capital of Tucumán and attacked Quiroga in the Rincón de Valladares on 6 July 1827.\nThe battle\nThe battle began with a Unitarian cavalry advance, which completely displaced the Federal cavalry.\nBut the Federal infantry, commanded by Colonel Bargas, resisted the enemy onslaught and advanced to the center of Lamadrid's line.\nPart of Lamadrid's forces set about pursuing Santiago de Estero troops, who had left the battlefield,\nand Quiroga's reserve took advantage of the moment to destroy the remaining enemy lines.\nWhen the Tucumán cavalry returned from their pursuit and found the infantry had lost three quarters of its soldiers, they also retired.\nCasualties were very high on both sides.  They increased when, days later, Quiroga had several officer prisoners shot.\nAftermath\nLamadrid fled north to Salta Province, where Governo José Ignacio Gorriti refused to help him.  He was forced to go into exile in Bolivia.\nQuiroga, meanwhile, ensured the dominance of Tucumán Province by the most prestigious Federalist politician of that province, Nicolás Laguna.\nThis battle marked the end of the first  war between Unitarians and Federalists in the interior.\nThe forces of no more than three provinces were involved in each campaign, so the scope was limited.\nThe cycle of the Argentine civil wars would change substantially in 1828, when many provinces would be involved, dividing the country into two opposing halves.\nThis situation would be repeated at least twice, in 1840 and 1861.\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n* |url=http://www.lagazeta.com.ar/rincon_de_valladares.htm\n|work=La Gazeta  |title=Batalla del Rincón de Valladares (6 de julio de 1827)}}\n*"
