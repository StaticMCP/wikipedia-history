It operates as an academy and caters for students aged 11 to 18.\nHistory\nThe school was established in 1967. In October 2010 it converted to academy status, having previously been a community school administered by Enfield London Borough Council. In 2006, Kingsmead was designated a specialist college in the performing and visual arts. In 2004, it was part of a sanctions scheme where children were sent as a punishment to Lea Valley Academy, rather than being temporarily excluded. The school also had a behaviour improvement programme manager, and Ofsted said that \"they had seen nothing in any other school to equal Kingsmead's work on behaviour\".\nEnrolment\nThe school has approximately 1,450–1,560 students on roll, operating at or near full capacity.\nAcademic performance and curriculum\nKingsmead offers a broad academic programme, including GCSEs and A-Levels, with particular emphasis on EBacc subjects and the arts. In 2017, its A-Level outcomes ranked in the top 4% nationally. The most recent Ofsted inspection (April 2022) rated the school as \"Good\", praising its ambitious curriculum, high standards of behaviour, and strong pastoral support.\nSixth form\nIt offers a range of A-Level courses, including subjects often unavailable in smaller schools, such as Music, Music Technology, French, Spanish, and a Computer Science course.\nNotable former pupils\n*Diane Parish (1981-1985), actor known for her portrayal of Denise Fox in the BBC soap opera EastEnders.\n*Jessie Wallace (1982-1986), actress known for her portrayal as Kat Slater in the BBC soap opera EastEnders.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingsmeadschool.org/ Kingsmead School official website]"
