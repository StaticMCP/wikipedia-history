      "text": "# Timeline of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2007 Pacific hurricane season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipation. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, which is information from post-storm analysis by the National Hurricane Center.\nThe season officially started on May 15, 2007, in the eastern Pacific, designated as the area east of 140°W, and on June 1, 2007, in the central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140°W, and lasted until November 30, 2007. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. The season began slowly; through the end of July, the seasonal Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) was the third lowest since the geostationary satellite era began in the 1966 Pacific hurricane season. The inactivity continued through the next month, which was the third quietest August in terms of ACE since reliable records began in the basin during the 1971 Pacific hurricane season. In June, Tropical Storm Barbara caused $55&nbsp;million (2007&nbsp;USD) in crop damage to southeastern Mexico from heavy precipitation. In August, Hurricane Flossie formed in the eastern Pacific and crossed into the central Pacific; the hurricane threatened Hawaii but caused little damage. In early September, Hurricane Henriette dropped heavy rainfall in southwest Mexico, which caused nine fatalities and $25&nbsp;million (2007&nbsp;USD) in damage.\nTimeline of storms\nImageSize = width:770 height:215\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/05/2007 till:30/11/2007\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/2007\nColors     =\nid:canvas value:gray(0.88)\nid:GP     value:red\nid:TD     value:rgb(0.43,0.76,0.92)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_≤38_mph_(≤62_km/h)\nid:TS     value:rgb(0.3,1,1)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117_km/h)\nid:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.85)     legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(118–153_km/h)\nid:C2     value:rgb(1,0.85,0.55)  legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h)\nid:C3     value:rgb(1,0.62,0.35)  legend:Category_3_=_111–129_mph_(178–208_km/h)\nid:C4     value:rgb(1,0.45,0.54)  legend:Category_4_=_130–156_mph_(209–251_km/h)\nid:C5     value:rgb(0.55,0.46,0.90)  legend:Category_5_=_≥157_mph_(≥252_km/h)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Hurricane\nbar:Month\nPlotData=\nbarset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\nfrom:26/05/2007 till:31/05/2007 color:TS text:\"Alvin (TS)\"\nfrom:29/05/2007 till:02/06/2007 color:TS text:\"Barbara (TS)\"\nfrom:11/06/2007 till:13/06/2007 color:TD text:\"Three-E (TD)\"\nfrom:09/07/2007 till:11/07/2007 color:TD text:\"Four-E (TD)\"\nfrom:14/07/2007 till:15/07/2007 color:TD text:\"Five-E (TD)\"\nfrom:14/07/2007 till:23/07/2007 color:C1 text:\"Cosme (C1)\"\nfrom:21/07/2007 till:27/07/2007 color:TS text:\"Dalila (TS)\"\nfrom:31/07/2007 till:02/08/2007 color:TS text:\"Erick (TS)\"\nbarset:break\nfrom:08/08/2007 till:16/08/2007 color:C4 text:\"Flossie (C4)\"\nfrom:29/08/2007 till:02/09/2007 color:TS text:\"Gil (TS)\"\nfrom:30/08/2007 till:05/09/2007 color:C1 text:\"Henriette (C1)\"\nfrom:18/09/2007 till:22/09/2007 color:C1 text:\"Ivo (C1)\"\nfrom:19/09/2007 till:20/09/2007 color:TD text:\"Thirteen-E (TD)\"\nfrom:29/09/2007 till:01/10/2007 color:TS text:\"Juliette (TS)\"\nfrom:14/10/2007 till:23/10/2007 color:TS text:\"Kiko (TS)\"\nbar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\nfrom:01/05/2007 till:31/05/2007 text:May\nfrom:01/06/2007 till:30/06/2007 text:June\nfrom:01/07/2007 till:31/07/2007 text:July\nfrom:01/08/2007 till:31/08/2007 text:August\nfrom:01/09/2007 till:30/09/2007 text:September\nfrom:01/10/2007 till:31/10/2007 text:October\nfrom:01/11/2007 till:30/11/2007 text:November\nTextData =\npos:(570,30)\ntext:\"(From the\"\npos:(618,30)\ntext:\"Saffir–Simpson scale)\"\nMay\n;May 15\n:*The Eastern Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\n;May 26\n:*5:00 p.m. PDT (00:00 UTC May 27) &ndash;
