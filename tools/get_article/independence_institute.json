The group's stated mission \"is to empower individuals and to educate citizens, legislators and opinion makers about public policies that enhance personal and economic freedom.\"\nHistory\noutside of it]]\nThe Independence Institute was founded in 1985 by John Andrews, a former Republican state legislator from Colorado. Since 1999, Independence Institute has been led by Jon Caldara.\nPolicy positions\nThe Independence Institute is a proponent of educational choice and charter schools, as well as the right to bear arms in accordance with the Second Amendment. II supported school board members in Douglas County, Colorado who became the majority there in 2009 and subsequently curtailed the power of the teachers' union, expanded school choice, and attempted to initiate a voucher system. However, a new school board majority elected in 2017 has promised to reverse many of these policies.\nPrior to winning election to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat, Jared Polis wrote a white paper for the institute about privatizing the U.S. Postal Service.\nBecause of the Institute's pro Second Amendment stance, it supports gun rights, including the right of concealed carry.\nIn 2013, II opposed Amendment 66, an unsuccessful ballot measure that would have increased the state's income tax by $950 million (which would have begun the hollowing out of Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR)). The organization supported the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), which was passed by Colorado voters in 1992.\nII opposed the Affordable Care Act. The Institute supports the use of fossil fuels.\nSee also\n* State Policy Network – a U.S. national network of conservative and libertarian think tank, which the Independence Institute belongs to\n* Political activities of the Koch brothers\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.i2i.org/ Official website]\n* [http://nccsweb.urban.org/communityplatform/nccs/organization/profile/id/840990300/popup/1 Organizational Profile]  – National Center for Charitable Statistics (Urban Institute)\n* [https://edirc.repec.org/data/i2iiius.html EDIRC listing] (provided by RePEc)"
