The result was a victory for the Rio Grande.\nPrelude\nGeneral Antonio Canales and the remaining insurgents that survived the Battle of Morales (25 March) sought refuge in San Antonio, Texas.\nWhile official recognition from the Republic of Texas was not obtained, General Canales' tour was met with some success. On the 1 June he arrived in San Patricio, where the rebellion forces had been reorganising. In addition to 300 volunteers, the army had grown to include 140 Texan and 80 Native American volunteers. The Texan volunteers were led by Colonel Samuel Jordan.\nBattle\nGeneral Canales sent Colonel Jordan and approximately 90 Texan volunteers south into disputed territory in late June; they crossed the Rio Grande, and took Ciudad Victoria, the capital of Tamaulipas, without any resistance. A few of those who were guiding Jordan were still loyal to the Central government of Mexico and were trying to lead the Texans towards San Luis Potosí, where a Mexican ambush awaited. Jordan suspected such and diverted his troops to Saltillo, Coahuila, where, on the 25 October he was attacked by Mexican General Ráfael Vásquez. Some of Jordan's soldiers deserted and he was heavily outnumbered, but he was able to defend himself and return to Texas.\nAftermath\nSoon after this defeat Canales capitulated to the Centralists.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
