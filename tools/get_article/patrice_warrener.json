Church of the Pilgrim Virgin, [[Pontevedra.]]\nPatrice Warrener is a French light artist, mostly known for his Chromolithe Polychromatic Illumination System. Warrener has made more than 60 chromolithe installations over the last fifteen years, lighting up buildings in close to a dozen different nations. Warrener's work has influenced the rising numbers of Light Festivals in many cities of World Heritage status around the world.\nTrained as a printer, Patrice made his mark in the world of light shows: first, with the French co-operative Open Light, and then with his collaboration with the English musician, and electronic music pioneer, Tim Blake, with whom he introduced Laser Lighting effects in their Crystal Machine shows in the early 1970s.\nIn 2016 Warrener illuminated the front of Westminster Abbey in London with coloured light projected onto statues as part of the Lumiere light festival.\nIn 2025, from 20 to 22 June, Patrice Warrener illuminated the church of the Pilgrim Virgin in the Spanish city of Pontevedra, during the first 3 days of the 32nd edition of the Pontevedra International Art Biennial.\nChromolithe\nChromolithe installations have been made for cathedrals and churches, historic public buildings, modern art museums, and even banks.\nThe chromolithe process starts with data collection, using a specially-built photographic chamber, months of meticulous art work on computer screens, and finally re-projecting the image, printed to 24x24 cm photographic plates, back onto the building from a series of custom-built 6000Kva Xenon projectors, discreetly placed, so as to make the light source appear invisible.\nSome of the cathedrals and intricate sculptured Gothic buildings that have been chromolithed, were originally painted. Thus, Warrener's work can be seen as a restoration of heritage buildings.\nGallery\nImage:Lichtkunst2.jpg|Second projection\nImage:Lichtkunst3.jpg|Third projection\nImage:Westminster Abbey Lumiere London 2016.jpg|Coloured light projected onto Westminster Abbey for Lumiere\nImage:Roemer_2017.jpg|Römerberg (Frankfurt) October 2017\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://moonweed.free.fr/chromo_web/chromolithe.html Chromolithe web site]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olyMLJNv36o Chromolithe at Lyon on YouTube]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050515063323/http://homepage1.nifty.com/ttomi/kobe/chromolithe/101.htm Chromolithe in Kobe]\n*"
