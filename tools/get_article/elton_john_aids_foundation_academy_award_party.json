The first party was held in February 1993 at Maple Drive Restaurant and raised $300,000. It had been produced by Patrick Lippert, an AIDS activist who died of the disease just months later. In recent years it has been held at the Pacific Design Center and was attended by 650 people in 2009. It is hosted by Elton John and the AIDS Foundation, and is one of the most high-profile parties in the Hollywood film industry, particularly for people of British origin working in Hollywood films or the entertainment industry. The annual party contributes to the foundation fund by its high priced ticket sales which are given by invitation only ($3500 or £2400 as of 2009) and a celebrity auction. The 2010 party raised over $8 million or £4 million.\nElton John has been quoted as saying that 98% of the proceeds of the party go to the foundation.\nThis party became a point of contention between two Real Housewives of Beverly Hills stars, Sutton Stracke and Lisa Rinna, when it was revealed that Stracke provided Rinna with a ticket when Stracke bought a table and never received a thank you from Rinna.\nVenues\n*1993 65th Academy Awards: Maple Drive Restaurant\n*1994 66th Academy Awards:\n*1995 67th Academy Awards: Four Seasons Hotel, Beverly Hills\n*1996 68th Academy Awards:\n*1997 69th Academy Awards:\n*1998 70th Academy Awards: Spago restaurant, Beverly Hills\n*1999 71st Academy Awards: Pagani\n*2000 72nd Academy Awards:\n*2001 73rd Academy Awards: Moomba restaurant, West Hollywood\n*2002 74th Academy Awards: Moomba restaurant, West Hollywood\n*2003 75th Academy Awards:\n*2004 76th Academy Awards:\n*2005 77th Academy Awards: Pacific Design Center, West Hollywood\n*2006 78th Academy Awards: Pacific Design Center, West Hollywood\n*2007 79th Academy Awards: Pacific Design Center, West Hollywood\n*2008 80th Academy Awards: Pacific Design Center, West Hollywood\n*2009 81st Academy Awards: Pacific Design Center, West Hollywood\n*2010 82nd Academy Awards: Pacific Design Center, West Hollywood\n*2011 83rd Academy Awards: Pacific Design Center, West Hollywood\n*2012 84th Academy Awards: West Hollywood Park, West Hollywood\n*2013 85th Academy Awards: Pacific Design Center, West Hollywood\n*2014 86th Academy Awards: West Hollywood Park, West Hollywood\n*2015 87th Academy Awards: West Hollywood Park, West Hollywood\n*2016 88th Academy Awards: West Hollywood Park, West Hollywood\n*2017 89th Academy Awards: West Hollywood Park, West Hollywood\n*2018 90th Academy Awards: West Hollywood Park, West Hollywood\n*2019 91st Academy Awards: West Hollywood Park, West Hollywood\n*2020 92nd Academy Awards: West Hollywood Park, West Hollywood\n*2021 93rd Academy Awards: Worldwide\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061129203655/http://www.ejaf.org/pages/events/index.html Official site]"
