It was released on 2 August 2013 as the eighth and final single from Harris' third studio album, 18 Months (2012). The song was written by Harris and Marar, who previously worked together on Harris's promotional single, \"Let Me Know\" (2004) and \"Flashback\" (2009), the third single from his second studio album, Ready for the Weekend.\nThe song debuted and peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, giving Harris his ninth UK top 10 single from 18 Months and making him the first artist in history to have nine UK top 10 singles from one album. His record was surpassed in March 2017 by Ed Sheeran, whose third studio album ÷ includes ten top 10 hits.\nChart performance\nOn 11 August 2013, the song climbed to number 8 in the UK, giving Harris his ninth top-10 hit from 18 Months (counting \"We Found Love\", on which Harris was listed as a featured artist, as a single from 18 Months)  and breaking his own chart record in the process. On Billboards Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, the song became his fifth consecutive number one.\nMusic video\nThe official music video was uploaded to Harris's Vevo account on 15 July 2013. It was directed by Vincent Haycock and filmed in Los Angeles County off the coast of Santa Catalina Island. Establishing shots of Avalon, California and Santa Catalina Island were used to convey the Somali coast of East Africa. Some additional scenes were filmed in Avalon, specifically the fight scene of the teenage boy, which overlooks the city and Pacific Ocean towards the California mainland.\nThe video features a pool party, a rave, a boat party (which Marar is on) being hijacked by Somali pirates, a couple having sex on a plane and a beaten-up teenage boy taking out revenge by badly beating up the guy who did it to him. The video also features an appearance from Hurts member Theo Hutchcraft.\nThe music video aroused controversy in France due to the nudity, sexual content, firearms explicitly showed and several violent scenes. Later, the French Audiovisual Regulation would ban the video music from TV-broadcasting during the day and then would be broadcast with a warning Not advised to kids under 10 years old (déconseillé aux moins de 10 ans in French) or without (depending to music channels).\nTrack listing and formats\n| title1 = Thinking About You\n| note1 = Jesse Rose Remix\n| length1 = 5:29\n| title2 = Thinking About You\n| note2 = Laidback Luke Remix\n| length2 = 6:34\n| title3 = Thinking About You\n| note3 = Michael Brun Remix\n| length3 = 5:42\n| title4 = Thinking About You\n| note4 = Ludo Remix\n| length4 = 6:45\n| title5 = Thinking About You\n| note5 = GTA Remix\n| length5 = 6:49\n| title6 = Thinking About You\n| note6 = Firebeatz Remix\n| length6 = 5:53\n| title7 = Thinking About You\n| note7 = EDX's Belo Horizonte At Night Remix\n| length7 = 6:51\n| title8 = Thinking About You\n| note8 = Manufactured Superstars Remix\n| length8 = 6:53\n}}\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2013–2014)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia Dance (ARIA)\n| 3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Romania (Romanian Top 100)\n| 62\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Russia Airplay (TopHit)\n| 193\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ukraine Airplay (TopHit)\n| 65\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|}\nMonthly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Monthly chart performance for \"Thinking About You\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ukraine Airplay (TopHit)\n| 75\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2013)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Dance Top 40)\n|43\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Rádiós Top 40)\n|65\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)\n|91\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100)\n|99\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company)\n|92\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard)\n|48\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2014)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Dance Top 40)\n|80\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Rádiós Top 40)\n|99\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard)\n|31\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|2 August 2013\n|Digital download\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United States\n|8 October 2013\n|Contemporary hit radio\n|}\nReferences"
