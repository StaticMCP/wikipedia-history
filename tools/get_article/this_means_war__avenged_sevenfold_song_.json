The song was singled out by Machine Head's vocalist Robb Flynn as a ripoff. Users on Ultimate Guitar voted the song into the site's \"Worst Guitar Riffs\" list.\nAlthough the song was not released as a single, it placed on several American Billboard rock charts and received a music video. Directed by Andrew Baird, it was released July 5, 2014.  The unreleased director's cut of the music video was released in 2017. The song was featured in the video game WWE 2K15.\nPersonnel\n;Avenged Sevenfold\n* M.
