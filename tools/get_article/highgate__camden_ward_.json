The ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. It returns three councillors to Camden London Borough Council. The boundaries of the ward were subject to minor changes in May 1978, April 1994, May 2002 and May 2022.\nHistory\nIn October 2019, during its review of the London Borough of Camden, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE) proposed removing Dartmouth Park from the Highgate ward. Dartmouth Park would be represented by two councillors while the rest of Highgate would be represented by one councillor. This was met with \"anger\" from local residents, and the LGBCE's final recommendations for Camden, published in February 2020, included only a single three-member ward for Highgate, accepting that \"its previous proposal a two-councillor ward alongside a one-councillor ward would have divided local communities.\"\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
