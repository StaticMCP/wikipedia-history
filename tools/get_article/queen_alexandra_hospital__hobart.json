In 1980, the building in Battery Point which was becoming too antiquated for modern health care services, was closed, and the Queen Alexandra hospital was moved to a new wing attached to the Royal. In 1999, the Queen Alexandra wing was leased to a private hospital organisation, which re-opened the site as the Hobart Private Hospital.\nNotable people\nBirths\n*Max Bingham (1927–2021), politician\n*Martin Bryant (born 1967), perpetrated the Port Arthur massacre (Australia)\n*Queen Mary of Denmark (born 1972)\n*Errol Flynn (1909–1959), actor\n*Peter Jones (Australian rules footballer) (born 1946)\nStaff\n*Bruce Hamilton (ophthalmologist) (1901–1968), ophthalmic surgeon\n*Doone Kennedy (1927–2014), politician who served as a president or board member of numerous organizations, including QAH\nReferences"
