They were re-released in 2014 and included a letter from Kingsbury to her readers, explaining how writing these types of stories became too much for her to handle emotionally due to the darkness associated with them, and thus she changed genres to writing more general fiction with a Christian emphasis (which she titled, and has trademarked, as \"Life-Changing Fiction\").\nStandalone novels\nSource:\n* On Every Side (2001)\n* Oceans Apart (2004)\n* Divine (2006)\n* Like Dandelion Dust (2006)\n* When Joy Came to Stay (2000)\n* Where Yesterday Lives (2006)\n* Between Sundays (2007)\n* Shades of Blue (2008)\n* This Side of Heaven (2009)\n* Unlocked (2010)\n* The Bridge (2012)\n* The Chance (2013)\n* Fifteen Minutes (2013)\n* A Distant Shore (2021)\n* Just Once (2023)\n** Although not part of any of her Baxter Family series, one of the characters (Ashley) is briefly portrayed as the manager of an adult care home where the main character resides in the latter stages of her life.
