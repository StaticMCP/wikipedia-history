The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations.\nWhile many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed, not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties.\nDelayed negotiations with the family that owns Casa Hacienda prompted the local government of Bautista to install the marker where Filipinas/Lupang Hinirang was composed to the town's plaza instead.\nThe historical marker commemorating the centennial birth anniversary of the late dictator and president Ferdinand Marcos in Batac, Ilocos Norte, unveiled on September 11, 2017, became controversial, as the NHCP earlier opposed the late strongman's burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani. Baybayin, an Ateneo de Manila student organization, issued an alternative marker online containing atrocities under the Marcos regime, as well as his burial. The said online marker became a statement against historical distortion.\nThis article lists one hundred twenty-six (126) markers from the Ilocos Region, including twenty (20) that are part of the Philippine Nationhood Trail markers series.\nIlocos Norte\nThis article lists thirty-nine (39) markers from the Province of Ilocos Norte.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Marker title\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| English Translation\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Type\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Description\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Language\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Date Issued\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Image\n|-\n| Abolition of Tobacco Monopoly\n|\n|Sites/ Events\n|Commemorative marker\n| Established in March 1782.
