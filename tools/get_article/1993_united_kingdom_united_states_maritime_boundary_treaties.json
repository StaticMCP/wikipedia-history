The first treaty delimits the boundary between the British territory of Anguilla and the United States Virgin Islands. The boundary is a simplified equidistant line that consists of a single maritime straight-line segment  long. It is defined by a straight line connecting two individual coordinate points. The full name of the treaty is Treaty between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the United States of America on the Delimitation in the Caribbean of a Maritime Boundary between the US Virgin Islands and Anguilla.\nThe second treaty delimits the boundary between the British Virgin Islands and the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The boundary is a simplified equidistant line that runs in a south–south-east direction until it terminates at the tripoint of Anguilla. It is far longer and more complicated than the Anguilla–U.S. Virgin Islands boundary: it is about  long and consists of 49 straight-line segments defined by 50 individual coordinate points. The full name of the treaty is Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the United States of America on the Delimitation in the Caribbean of a Maritime Boundary between Puerto Rico/US Virgin Islands and the British Virgin Islands.\nThe two treaties entered into force on 1 June 1995 after they had been ratified by both states.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Anderson, Ewan W.
