They supplied mercenary soldiers for the Ummayyad and Abbasid Caliphate. These soldiers would settle in nowadays Iraq and marry amongst local Arab women. Thus forming the Az-Zutt tribe also known as Banu Zutt.\nRebellion\nDuring circa. 810, Yusuf ibn Zutt began a rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate which created semi-independent state in the Marshlands of Southern Iraq (Mesopotamian Marshes). Isa ibn Yazid al-Juludi would be sent by caliph Al Ma'mun to crush the rebellion, but would fail to do so. Isa ibn Yazid al-Juludi and Ahmad bin Qutayba would be sent by caliph Al Ma'mun to crush the rebellion, but would fail to do so.\nUnder the tribal leader, Muhammad Ibn Uthman, rebellion continued when Kufa, Basra, Wasit, Al-Jazira and surrounding places of Baghdad came under his control. This caused a major disruption of resources and food to Baghdad, putting the Abbasids in danger.\nNaval raids\nMu'tasim's army employed similarly meticulous tactics to suppress a Zutt rebellion in southern Iraq. However, the new Turkish troops were not involved, as their strategies were ill-suited for the marshes and densely cultivated palm groves. Instead, other forces blocked off hundreds of reedy canals used by the Zutt for raids in small boats, and then methodically advanced into rebel-held territory.\nZutt colonization of Khuzestan\nThe Zutt colonization of Khuzestan refers to the migration and settlement of the Zutt people Muslim communities originally from the Indus Valley region of modern day Pakistan in the marshlands of southwestern Iran during the late Sasanian and early Islamic periods. They established agricultural communities and irrigation infrastructure in Khuzestan. After the suppression of the Zutt rebellion in southern Iraq, many were relocated to Bahrain, where they continued similar activities.\nCapture of Basra\nThe Capture of Basra was a significant event in the Zutt Rebellion. After a series of successful military engagements and leveraging their control over the region's vital waterways and marshlands, the Zutts launched a assault on the city of Basra. Their guerrilla tactics and their strategic advantage in navigating the waterways allowed them to isolate the city and launch surprise raids. The Abbasid Caliphate forces, struggling against the challenging terrain and the Zutt tactics, failed to mount an effective defense.\nCapture of Wasit\nThe Capture of Wasit was an important moment in the Zutt Rebellion. The Zutts, using their dominance over the marshlands and waterways between Wasit and Basra, launched a coordinated attack on Wasit. Their intimate knowledge of the terrain and reliance on guerrilla tactics enabled them to overwhelm Abbasid defenses and seize control of the city.\nThe Abbasid forces, commanded by Al-Mu'tasim, suffered heavy casualties as they struggled to counter the Zutt's ambushes in the marshes. The fall of Wasit allowed the Zutts to establish temporary rule over the city and destabilized Abbasid authority in the region.\nEnd of Rebellion\nAfter the passing of al-Ma'mun, al-Mu'tasim becomes Caliph of the Abbasids. With a reformed military, he took charge of the dire situation of the rebellion, sending Ujayf ibn Anbasa to successfully crush the rebellion in 835. He then dispersed the Zutt population to different parts of the Caliphate to prevent another rebellion. Muhammad Ibn Uthman still retained the position of tribal leader after rebellion, however with a weaker force.\nExternal sources\n*Houtsma, M. Th. (1993). E. J.
