His name appears in the credits for having contributed to every song, however Webb's parts in the recordings were done by longstanding sideman John Parsons.\nCurrent steel string guitarist Miles Gilderdale contributes to two songs on this album.\nThe song \"Augustrasse 18\" is titled after the address of the Hansahaus-Studios in Bonn, Germany (actually written Auguststraße) where Acoustic Alchemy recorded numerous albums under producer John Parsons.\nTrack listing\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # !!
