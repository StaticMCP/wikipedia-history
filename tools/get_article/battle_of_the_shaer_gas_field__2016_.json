It is the third attack that was launched by ISIL on the gas field.\nOffensive\nOn 5 May 2016, ISIL once again captured the Shaer gas field that had been held by the Syrian government since the Second Battle of the Shaer gas field. 34 soldiers and 16 ISIL fighters were killed during the battle for the field.\nFour days later, ISIL attacked the nearby al-Mahr oil field, capturing al-Mahr hill, before the military recaptured the hill and repelled the attack on the field the following day. The same day, 10 May, ISIL captured an abandoned military base near the T4 airbase, cutting the main supply route to Palmyra. Government troops recaptured the base and reopened the supply road.\nMid-May, there were reports of explosions and a 4.4 Richter magnitude scale  earthquake that was believed to be caused by the entire field blowing up.\nOn 30 May, government forces recaptured the Huwaysis area.\nAftermath\nIn late June, ISIL was once again in control of the Huwaysis area.\nIn early July, some media activists showed the first photos and videos of the preparation of blasting and explosion.\nIn September, pro-government forces regained control of the Huwaysis area. but lost it again in a December offensive before recapturing it yet again in early 2017.\nSee also\n* Battle of the Shaer gas field (July 2014)\n* Battle of the Shaer gas field (October–November 2014)\nReferences"
