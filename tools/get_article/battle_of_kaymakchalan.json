Between 26 and 30 September, the peak changed hands several times until the Serbian army decisively captured it on the 30th.\nThe battle proved to be very costly for both sides. Serbian losses had reached around 10,000 killed and wounded by 23 September. The Bulgarian companies had been reduced to 90 men each, and one regiment, the 11th Sliven Regiment, had 73 officers and 3,000 men hors de combat.\nFrom a strategic standpoint, the battle was not a significant success for the Allies due to the upcoming winter that rendered further military engagements almost impossible.\nToday, there is a small St. Peter's Church on the peak of Prophet Elijah where the skulls of dead Serbian soldiers are stored, and it is regarded as a cultural site and is a tourist attraction. There is confusion about the name of the church, but it is called Saint Peter's (Sveti Petar in Serbian), which stands on the peak called Prophet Elijah.\nGallery\nSerbian chapel on Kajmakčalan (2521m).jpg|The St. Peter's Church at Kajmakčalan\nBattle of Kaymakchalan (painting, Oton Iveković).jpg|Oton Iveković: Battle of Kaymakchalan\nVrhovna komanda.jpg|Observation Post of the Serbian Army High Command on Kajmakčalan, moved to Pioneers Park, Belgrade\nBattle of Kaymakchalan 100th anniversary, 2016 post stamp of Serbia.jpg|Commemoration post stamp of Serbia for 100th anniversary (2016)\nKajmakčalan, od 1930.jpg|Kajmakčalan in 1930 (trenches can be easily seen even today)\nЗвоно код капеле Кајмакчалан (2017).jpg|Bell at the St. Peter's Church on the top\nУрна Арчибалда Рајса (Кајмакчалан).jpg|Urn with heart of Archibald Reiss, original was destroyed by Bulgarians in World War II\nSv.
