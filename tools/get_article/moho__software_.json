The software was distributed by E Frontier until 2007, when it was acquired by Smith Micro Software and renamed to Anime Studio.\nIn 2010, Smith Micro released Anime Studio 7, which added features such as physics, 3D creation, and an improved interface.\nIn 2011, Anime Studio 8 added features such as the character Wizard, layered Photoshop import, and real-time media connection. Version 8.1 also supported the new Poser 9 SDK and integrated the Wacom multi-touch API, allowing it to work natively with Wacom's Bamboo and Intuos tablets.\nIn 2012, Smith Micro released Anime Studio 9, with new features including smart bones, editable motion graphs, and bézier handles. It also included enhancements to the timeline, keyframes, and onion skin.\nIn 2014, Anime Studio 10 contained upgraded features and new mechanics to its predecessor. Some of these include new drawing tools, improved inverse kinematics, squash & stretch, and rendering improvements. Version 10.1 added the ability to copy keyframes between similar characters.\nIn 2015, Anime Studio 11 added frame-by-frame animation, layer referencing, animated shape ordering, enhanced tools and brushes, JSON file format support, and other features.\nIn 2016, Anime Studio was rebranded as its original name Moho by Smith Micro Software to reflect the software's ability to create more animated content than anime.\nIn 2016, Moho 12 was released with pin bones, optimized bézier handles, improved free hand tools, smart warp, real motion blur, and more. Moho Pro 12 was released in August 2016. In October 2016, Moho became available for the Microsoft Surface Studio. Smith Micro worked with Microsoft to develop Moho functionality for the Surface Dial peripheral. This feature set enabled users to create animations more quickly and easily through functions such as a new overlay timeline, rigged characters, rotating canvases, and frame-by-frame animation.\nIn June 2019, Moho 13 introduced new bitmap tools, including bitmap frame to frame capabilities, and re-engineered 3D object support.\nOn 22 December 2020, it was announced that the Moho 2D animation software had been acquired by Lost Marble LLC, a company founded by Mike Clifton, the original creator of Moho, Victor Paredes, Supervisor of Moho animation at Cartoon Saloon and former Moho Product Manager and Fahim Niaz, Founder at Graphixly LLC and former Moho Product Manager.\nOn 26 April 2021, Lost Marble LLC released Moho 13.5, with new features including Vitruvian Bones, Wind Dynamics, Quad meshes, and a slightly refreshed user interface.\nOn 12 September 2023, Lost Marble LLC released Moho 14, with new features including a new graphics engine, improved drawing and frame-by-frame tools, liquid shapes, curvers, new freehand styles, smart line boil, easier follow through and overlapping with dynamics, delayed constraints, an updated scripting interface, a better timeline, and improved SVG support and user interface.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
