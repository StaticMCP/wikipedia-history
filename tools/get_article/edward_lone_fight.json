He retired as Superintendent of Mandaree School, Mandaree, North Dakota, in 2000.\nPersonal life\nLone Fight was a fluent speaker of the Hidatsa language and a traditionalist. He graduated from Dickinson State University with a major in biology; one of the earliest Native Americans to do so. He also held a master's degree in education and a master's degree in Public Administration.\nThe son of Mabel Good Bird and Theodore Lone Fight, Edward was also a direct descendant of Waheenie Wea (Buffalo Bird Woman), Sheheke, and Chief Four Bears. \"Lone Fight\" is a broad family name related exclusively to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation of the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota.\nLone Fight died in Stanley, North Dakota, on November 1, 2025, at the age of 86.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.mhanation.com/ Three Affiliated Tribes Homepage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120518162036/http://www.ndstudies.org/resources/IndianStudies/threeaffiliated/leaders_contemp_1968.html North Dakota Tribal Leaders]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120518162036/http://www.ndstudies.org/resources/IndianStudies/threeaffiliated/leaders_contemp_1968.html Contemporary Tribal Leaders NDSU]"
