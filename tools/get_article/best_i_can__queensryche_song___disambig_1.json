A lot of people really embraced that song, people with serious disadvantages, and we are happy about that as it was a rallying song to get behind of and kind of inspired them to seek their goals and move in the right direction.\"\nTrack listing\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1991)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|US Mainstream Rock (Billboard) || align=\"center\" |28\n|-\n||UK Singles (OCC) || align=\"center\" |36\n|}\nPersonnel\n* Geoff Tate – lead vocals\n* Chris DeGarmo – lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards\n* Michael Wilton – rhythm guitar\n* Eddie Jackson – bass, backing vocals\n* Scott Rockenfield – drums\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.discogs.com/master/195981-Queensr%C3%BFche-Best-I-Can?srsltid=AfmBOordXfVA57h919nm6q00e9J6k5hULOrO5jrF9LdJYllxfGZ8XF7b \"Best I Can\"] at Discogs (list of releases)\n* [https://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Queensr%FFche&titel=Best+I+Can&cat=s \"Best I Can\"] at Dutch Charts (list of releases)"
