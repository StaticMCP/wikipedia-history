The ceremony was broadcast on ABC, from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, Pasadena, California.\nThe Cosby Show defeated two-time reigning champion Cheers to win Outstanding Comedy Series, one of three major awards it won.  Although it only took home one major award, Cheers did tie the then-record for most major nominations by a comedy series (11), set by The Mary Tyler Moore Show in 1977. In the drama field Cagney & Lacey, en route to winning four major awards on the night, defeated presumed favorite Miami Vice to win Outstanding Drama Series, four-time defending champion Hill Street Blues still received nine major nominations, but only won one award. This was Hill Street Blues 18th and final major award, setting an Emmy record for a drama series that still stands and was later achieved by The Sopranos.\nThe ceremony also had a memorable unscripted moment involving the arrest of impersonator Barry Bremen for grand theft while attempting to accept the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series award on behalf of Betty Thomas, who would show up on the auditorium stage a few minutes late.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Cosby Show (NBC)'\n** Cheers (NBC)\n** Family Ties (NBC)\n** Kate & Allie (CBS)\n** Night Court (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Cagney & Lacey (CBS)'\n** Hill Street Blues (NBC)\n** Miami Vice (NBC)\n** Murder, She Wrote (CBS)\n** St. Elsewhere (NBC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Do You Remember Love (CBS)'\n** The Burning Bed (NBC)\n** Fatal Vision (NBC)\n** Heartsounds (ABC)\n** ''Wallenberg: A Hero's Story (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n*'The Jewel in the Crown (PBS)'\n** Ellis Island (CBS)\n** Robert Kennedy & His Times (CBS)\n** Space (CBS)\n** A Woman of Substance (Syndicated)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" colspan=\"2\"|\n* 'Motown Returns to the Apollo (NBC)'\n** AFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute to Gene Kelly (CBS)\n** Great Performances: \"Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music\" (PBS)\n** Late Night with David Letterman (NBC)\n** The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (NBC)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Robert Guillaume as Benson DuBois in Benson (ABC)'\n** Harry Anderson as Judge Harry T.
