Located on the Funmilayo Kuti street in Garki, is expected to be replaced by the city's Cathedral of the Twelve Apostles upon its completion.\nInitially it was called \"Church of All Saints\" and had its first priest in 1983.\nThe cathedral parish follows the Latin Rite.  It serves as the mother church of the archdiocese (Archidioecesis Abugensis), which was created as a mission sui juris in 1981 and elevated to archiepiscopal status in 1994 via the bull \"Quo aptius\" of Pope John Paul II.\nIt is under the pastoral responsibility of Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama. Pope John Paul II visited it in 1988, as did President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, in 2015.\nSee also\n*Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Lagos\n*List of cathedrals in Nigeria\n*Roman Catholicism in Nigeria\nReferences"
