Arizona voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her running mate Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. Arizona has 11 electoral votes in the Electoral College.\nDespite the country at-large swinging to the right, Arizona's Republican margin of victory decreased from 9.0% in 2012 to only 3.5% in 2016, thus making it one of 11 states (along with the District of Columbia) to swing toward the Democratic Party in this election.\nAs of 2024, Trump's 2016 margin of victory in Arizona remains the smallest for any Republican who won the presidency since Arizona's statehood in 1912. This was the last time Arizona voted to the right of Florida.\nNotably, Maricopa County, the state's most populous county, went more Democratic than the state as a whole for the first time in state history; it has done so in every election since. The county had not voted for a Democrat since Harry S. Truman in 1948. Maricopa County and Arizona as a whole both voted Democratic in 2020 and then flipped back to the Republican presidential column in 2024.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic primary\nin Phoenix on March 21, 2016.]]\nin Phoenix on March 15, 2016.]]\nat a campaign rally for his wife at Central High School in Phoenix on March 20, 2016.]]\nSix candidates appeared on the Democratic presidential primary ballot:\n* Bernie Sanders\n* Hillary Clinton\n* Rocky De La Fuente\n* Martin O'Malley (withdrawn)\n* Henry Hewes\n* Michael Steinberg\nOpinion polling\nResults\nDetailed results per congressional district\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n|+ Detailed results for the Arizona Democratic primary, April 5, 2016\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | District\n! colspan=2 | Total\n! colspan=3 | Hillary Clinton\n! colspan=3 | Bernie Sanders\n|-\n!

From March 2016 to October, the polling in this normally Republican state was quite close, with neither candidate seriously leading. In late October, Trump gained momentum and won every pre-election poll in the weeks leading up to the election. The final poll showed Trump leading Clinton 46% to 41% and the average of the final 3 polls showed Trump leading 47% to 43%, which was accurate compared to the results.\nPredictions\nThe following are final 2016 predictions from various organizations for Arizona as of Election Day.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Los Angeles Times\n|\n|November 6, 2016\n|-\n| align=left | Rothenberg Political Report\n|\n| November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |CNN\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |NBC\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |RealClearPolitics\n|\n|November 8, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Fox News\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |ABC\n|\n|November 7, 2016\n|}\nResults\n}}\n5.4%\n}}\n0.1%\n}}\n2.7%\n}}\n1.0%\n}}\n0.7%\n}}\n0.0%\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nBy county\n{|width=\"60%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |Donald TrumpRepublican\n! colspan=\"2\" |Hillary ClintonDemocratic\n! colspan=\"2\" |Various candidatesOther parties\n! colspan=\"2\" |Margin\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\" |%\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Apache\n|  |8,240\n|  |29.79%\n|  |17,083\n|  |61.76%\n|  |2,338\n|  |8.45%\n|  |-8,843\n|  |-31.97%\n|  |27,661\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Cochise\n|  |28,092\n|  |56.17%\n|  |17,450\n|  |34.89%\n|  |4,473\n|  |8.94%\n|  |10,642\n|  |21.28%\n|  |50,015\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Coconino\n|  |21,108\n|  |35.31%\n|  |32,404\n|  |54.20%\n|  |6,272\n|  |10.49%\n|  |-11,296\n|  |-18.89%\n|  |59,784\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Gila\n|  |14,182\n|  |62.99%\n|  |7,003\n|  |31.10%\n|  |1,330\n|  |5.91%\n|  |7,179\n|  |31.89%\n|  |22,515\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Graham\n|  |8,025\n|  |65.34%\n|  |3,301\n|  |26.88%\n|  |955\n|  |7.78%\n|  |4,724\n|  |38.46%\n|  |12,281\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Greenlee\n|  |1,892\n|  |57.33%\n|  |1,092\n|  |33.09%\n|  |316\n|  |9.58%\n|  |800\n|  |24.24%\n|  |3,300\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |La Paz\n|  |4,003\n|  |67.27%\n|  |1,575\n|  |26.47%\n|  |373\n|  |6.27%\n|  |2,428\n|  |40.80%\n|  |5,951\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Maricopa\n|  |747,361\n|  |47.67%\n|  |702,907\n|  |44.83%\n|  |117,566\n|  |7.50%\n|  |44,454\n|  |2.84%\n|  |1,567,834\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Mohave\n|  |58,282\n|  |72.90%\n|  |17,455\n|  |21.83%\n|  |4,206\n|  |5.26%\n|  |40,827\n|  |51.07%\n|  |79,943\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Navajo\n|  |20,577\n|  |51.07%\n|  |16,459\n|  |40.85%\n|  |3,258\n|  |8.09%\n|  |4,118\n|  |10.22%\n|  |40,294\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Pima\n|  |167,428\n|  |39.71%\n|  |224,661\n|  |53.28%\n|  |29,551\n|  |7.01%\n|  |-57,233\n|  |-13.57%\n|  |421,640\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Pinal\n|  |72,819\n|  |56.21%\n|  |47,892\n|  |36.97%\n|  |8,835\n|  |6.82%\n|  |24,927\n|  |19.24%\n|  |129,546\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Santa Cruz\n|  |3,897\n|  |23.71%\n|  |11,690\n|  |71.14%\n|  |846\n|  |5.15%\n|  |-7,793\n|  |-47.43%\n|  |16,433\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Yavapai\n|  |71,330\n|  |62.32%\n|  |35,590\n|  |31.10%\n|  |7,530\n|  |6.58%\n|  |35,740\n|  |31.22%\n|  |114,450\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|  |Yuma\n|  |25,165\n|  |47.47%\n|  |24,605\n|  |46.42%\n|  |3,240\n|  |6.11%\n|  |560\n|  |1.05%\n|  |53,010\n|-\n!Totals!!1,252,401!!48.08%!!1,161,167!!44.58%!!191,089!!7.34%!!91,234!!3.50%!!2,604,657\n|}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}|\n|Trend relative to the state by county|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}|\n}}}}\nBy congressional district\nTrump won five of nine congressional districts, with the remaining four going to Clinton.

Arizona was among the eleven states in which Hillary Clinton outperformed Barack Obama's margin in 2012, primarily due to an increase in Hispanic voter turnout in southern Arizona, including heavily populated Maricopa County. This was the weakest performance for a Republican in the state since 1992. Trump also lost the 2nd congressional district that Romney had won four years earlier.\nMaricopa County, in particular, went from a 10.7% margin of victory for Romney in 2012 to a 2.8% margin of victory for Trump, making this the first time since 1996 that the county was held to single digits. Clinton also came the closest of any Democrat to winning Yuma County since La Paz County broke off from it in the 1980s, as the county was last carried by a Democrat in 1964. Other rural counties that Bill Clinton had won in the 1990s continued to trend in a Republican direction, namely the formerly union-heavy Gila, Graham, and Greenlee counties. In terms of percentage of the vote, Trump's strongest support was in the northwest of the state, including Mohave County, which was the only county to give him over 70% of the vote. Clinton did best in the southern-central region along the US-Mexico border. Santa Cruz and Pima counties (home to Tucson) were among her strongest and among the places in the state where she outperformed Barack Obama in 2012.\nElectors\nArizona had 11 electors in 2016. All of them voted for Donald Trump for president and Mike Pence for vice president.\nThe electors were\n* Bruce Ash\n* Walter Begay\n* Sharon Giese\n* Robert Graham\n* Alberto Gutier\n* Jerry Hayden\n* Carole Joyce\n* Jane Pierpoint Lynch\n* J.
