It lasted from November 1918 until August 1919. The military operation launched by the Hungarian Red Army in 1919 against Czechoslovak forces referred as Northern Campaign () in Hungary.\nBackground\nAt the end of 1918, the final year of World War I, the collapse of Austria-Hungary led to the declaration of independence of Czechoslovakia.\nOccupation of Upper Hungary\nOn October 28, 1918, Czechoslovakia was proclaimed, but its borders were not settled for several months. Edvard Beneš wanted to present the Paris Peace Conference with a fait accompli, so Czechoslovak forces tried unsuccessfully to occupy the northern counties of Hungary in November 1918 without any official permission. The future territory of Slovakia (then Upper Hungary), which until then had belonged to Hungary, was supposed to be part of Czechoslovakia. At the beginning of November 1918, clashes began between Hungarians and Czechoslovak military units. At the end of the month, the Entente drew a provisional demarcation line, and this was revealed to the Hungarian government on December 23, in the document known as the Vix Note. Czech legions were ordered back from Italy; they began to occupy the southern, Hungarian-inhabited regions of Upper Hungary (the future Slovakia) on December 31, 1918, and took control before mid-January.\nHowever, on December, French lieutenant colonel Ferdinand Vix, who was the head of the Entente military mission in Budapest, informed Hungary that the Czechoslovak army was recognized as part of the Entente army. He also pointed out that Slovakia was part of the Czechoslovak Republic, which had the right to militarily occupy the territory of Slovakia, and Hungary was obliged to withdraw its troops from there.\nThe dominant Hungarian and German population tried to prevent the annexation of Pozsony (today Bratislava) to Czechoslovakia and declared it a free city. However, the Czechoslovak Legions occupied the city on January 1, 1919, and made it part of Czechoslovakia, against the wish of the local population, because of its economic importance for the new state. On February 12, 1919, the German and Hungarian population started a protest against the Czechoslovak occupation, and the Czechoslovak Legions opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators. The intervention by the Czechoslovak soldiers firing on the peaceful demonstrators caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries.\nCzechoslovak soldiers began occupying Northern Hungary on November 2, 1918. A Holíč detachment of 120 men penetrated as far as Malacky. The Hungarian prefect in Bratislava sent several dozen soldiers against them, but they were unable to push them back. The tension was calmed by the drawing of a temporary demarcation line leading from Děvínská Nová Ves to the Little Carpathians. Bratislava remained in Hungarian hands. Based on the agreement, Czechoslovak soldiers occupied the area from Stupava to Devín Lake. They took control of Trenčín on November 10 and Žilina two days later. However, when 120 Czechoslovak soldiers occupied Trnava on November 9, the local guard, supported by Hungarian soldiers sent from Bratislava, pushed them back to Senica, where the Hungarian advance was halted on November 17. Czechoslovak soldiers advancing on Ružomberok also had to retreat to Žilina. Under Hungarian pressure, they had to retreat to Ostrava. The provisional border between Czechoslovakia and Hungary was then established on November 28; it was formed by the river Ipeľ up to Lučenac and continued through Rimavská Sobota to Uzhhorod. The new commander of the Czechoslovak troops in Northern Hungary, Colonel František Schöbl, who took office on November 25, decided to occupy the Nitra Valley on December 6. On December 4, however, he already faced a Hungarian attack on Hlohovec, and the first company of Czechoslovak sailors successfully repulsed an attack at Žilina a day later, and occupied the town. After securing Hlohovec, Sereď and Pezinok were also occupied. Nitra, from which the Hungarians retreated to Nové Zámky, was occupied on December 11. This was followed by an operation whose goal was to control the center and east of Northern Hungary. Poprad was captured with the support of an armored train on December 15, and Spišská Nová Ves was occupied a day later. After the clash with the Poles near Kežmarok, the demarcation line between Czechoslovakia and Poland had to be established; this ran from Lomnický štít through Magura to Stará Ľubovna. Zvolen was occupied on December 22, Banská Štiavnica and Banská Bystrica a day later. By December 25, all of Považie and the territory extending to Spišská Nová Ves were already under control. Only eastern Northern Hungary remained to be secured, and this was not done until the end of the year. Prešov was occupied on December 28 and Košice a day later. On the same day, the Italian general Luigi Piccione took command of the Czechoslovak troops. The Czechoslovak army legionary corps from Italy was tasked with the occupation of southern Northern Hungary. Piccione started the advance to Bratislava on December 30. He gained control of the city from January 1 to January 2, 1919. Lučenec was occupied on the night of January 2/3, Nové Zámka was occupied on January 9 without a fight, and Komárno a day later. By January 11, the northern bank of the Ipeľ was cleared. As Piccione's line of demarcation crossed the key railway line from Bratislava to the east, Piccione decided to advance south. The southern bank of Ipeľ was occupied on January 16, and by January 20 the entire territory of the future Slovakia was under control. Czechoslovakia was not satisfied with the border established on November 28, because the railway line leading to the east did not remain on the Czechoslovak side of the border. Thus the Council of the Agreement in February 1919 allowed that the Czechoslovak troops occupied a much more southerly line, leading from Esztergom through Mátra to Čop. During the war, the Hungarian Red Army fought separate battles against troops from Czechoslovakia and Romania, and France was also heavily diplomatically involved in the conflicts. By the end of the war, more than 120,000 troops on both sides had become involved.\nOn April 26, 1919, Hungarian troops left the areas of the border with Czechoslovakia. The withdrawal facilitated the operation of the Czechoslovak troops, who joined the Romanians on April 27, based on the order of April 7. Their task was not only to secure the territory of the new state, but also to prevent the connection of the Hungarian Red Army with Russia. Therefore, part of the forces headed east; after crossing the Carpathian passes, they penetrated Transcarpathian Rus (today's Subcarpathian Ukraine), which they controlled by April 30. As the Hungarians withdrew, the advance to the south was also rapid. The units led by the Italian general Luigi Piccione did not stop at the newly drawn demarcation line, but continued on and entered Miskolc on May 2. The Romanians stopped on the Tisza on May 1 because Bessarabia, which they had taken over after the fall of Tsarist Russia, was threatened. On May 1, Soviet Foreign Minister Gerogii Chicherin gave Bucharest an ultimatum to withdraw from Bessarabia or face attack. Therefore, on May 2, Romania agreed to a truce with Budapest so that they could defend Bessarabia. This was exploited by the Hungarian forces, who decided to focus on Czechoslovakia.\nNorthern campaign\nBattle of Salgótarján and aftermath\nAppealing to Hungarians with promises of regaining the land lost to neighbouring countries within a week of his rise to power, communist revolutioner Béla Kun declared war upon Czechoslovakia. That increased Kun's domestic support by making good on his promise to restore Hungary's borders. The Hungarian Army recruited men aged between 19 and 25. Industrial workers from Budapest volunteered, and many former Austro-Hungarian officers re-enlisted through patriotism. The Hungarian army moved its 1st and 5th artillery divisions (40 battalions) to Upper Hungary (partially modern day Slovakia). The Hungarian counterattack launched on 9 May 1919 in the area of Hatvan. On 20 May 1919 Colonel Aurél Stromfeld, attacked in force and routed Czechoslovak troops from Miskolc (Miškovec), also recapturing Košice (Kassa) and Prešov (Eperjes), thus successfully separated the Czechoslovak and Romanian Armies from each other. Through that successful action, Hungary controlled territory up to its old northern borders and regained control of industrial areas around Miskolc, Salgótarján and Banská Štiavnica (Selmecbánya).) by the Hungarian Red Army on 6 June 1919 in contemporary Hungarian news ]]\nThe 1st Division, unable to cross the Hernád River due to strong Czechoslovak resistance, did not complete its daily objective. However, the rest of the corps successfully advanced. Particularly successful were the 80th and 46th brigades of the 3rd Division, which pushed forward towards Losonc (today Lučenec). As a result, the enemy evacuated Losonc on the evening of 30 May.\nOn 1 June, the troops captured Tiszalúc, Szendrő, Tornalja, and Léva (today Levice). By 3 June, they had entered Érsekújvár (today Nové Zámky), and on 5 June, the Hungarian soldiers marched into Sárospatak and Korpona (today Krupina). The Hungarian forces of the 6th Division operated towards Kassa (today Košice) and on 6 June they had captured the city. In the following days, the III Corps continued to push their attack towards Tőketerebes (today Trebišov), Eperjes (today Prešov), Bártfa (today Bardejov).\nProclamation of Slovak Soviet Republic and moral collapse of army\nDespite the communists' promises on the restoration of the former borders of Hungary, they declared the establishment of the independent Slovak Soviet Republic in Eperjes (today Prešov) on 16 June 1919. After that proclamation, the Hungarian nationalists and patriots soon realized that the new communist government had no intentions to recapture the lost territories, only to spread communist ideology and establish other communist states in Europe, and was thus sacrificing Hungarian national interests. Despite the series of military victories against the Czechoslovak Army, the Hungarian Red Army started to disintegrate because of the fundamental tension between patriots and communists during the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic, and that concession shook the popular and military support of the communist government, particularly among professional military officers, patriots and nationalists in the Hungarian Red Army. In fact, even the chief of the general staff, Aurél Stromfeld, resigned his post in protest.\nOn 7 June, French Prime Minister Clemenceau sent a note to the Hungarian government on behalf of the Peace Conference, urging the immediate cessation of hostilities. He emphasized that it was their intention to invite Hungarian representatives to Paris. Since it was clear, even to politicians, that the note was intended to provide a breathing space only for the Czechoslovak army, the Hungarian Soviet government immediately responded to the note, stressing that the hostilities had been initiated by the Czechoslovaks, who had arbitrarily crossed the demarcation line. Furthermore, they suggested that the common concerns of the states formed in the territory of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy be addressed at a more restricted conference.\nOn 13 June, the Hungarian Soviet government received another note from Clemenceau about the Paris Peace Conference's decision on Hungary's borders, with orders for the Hungarian army to withdraw within those borders. Clemenceau promised that if the Hungarians ceased their northern offensive and withdrew from the occupied territories, they would also instruct the Romanian forces to immediately retreat to the demarcation line. After 13 June, a serious debate broke out among the leaders of the Hungarian Soviet government regarding whether to accept or reject the note. Following the retreat in the north, the Tisza front collapsed, leading to the downfall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. On 4 August, the Romanian army entered Budapest.\nMeanwhile, the Czechoslovak Army had changed. The few unreliable Italian commanders were replaced by French generals and officers. The head of the newly organized Czechoslovak 2nd Infantry Division was the French Legion Colonel and veteran Foreign Legion Josef Šnejdárek. Battalions and regiments broken in previous battles were formed and, along with new units, receded in mountainous terrain from one defensive line to another. It was enough for a week for Šnejdárek to consolidate subordinate troops and prepare them for offensive actions.\nOn 24 June, following multiple exchanges of notes between the High Command of the Red Army and General Pellé, who was appointed by the Czechoslovak side, a ceasefire took effect on the northern front. This marked the end of the Red Army's northern campaign.\nBattle of Zvolen (Zólyom)\nOn the morning of June 10 the 2nd Infantry Brigade launched a demonstration attack on Zvolen (Zólyom). Its left wing surprisingly appeared in the side of the Hungarian troops, the right wing entered Banská Štiavnica (Selmecbánya). All Hungarian attacks on the following day were repelled, and the 2nd Division continued to attack. Šnejdárek changed the direction of the strike, and on June 13 he ordered a by-passing attack on Zvolen. After four hours of fighting, his troops occupied the dominant dimensions and began attacking the key positions of the Hungarian defense. At around noon, the first unit of the Elected, and the queue were punched to a depth of 10&nbsp;km. The whole central flow of Hron (Garam) was given to the Czechoslovak control, and the Hungarian command no longer had advances to break the breakthrough. The recapture of Zvolen meant a turnaround of combat. The Czechoslovak Army took the initiative and attacked the Hungarians in two directions: Levice (Léva) and Lučenec (Losonc). Weekly battles exploded, and all of the Hungarian advances were exhausted. The Hungarian Army Command agreed with the ceasefire and retreated to the demarcation line. The Czech soldiers, most of whom had fought in World War I in the ranks of the Austro-Hungarian Army, as well as Slovak Army volunteers, showed that they were as good as the Czechoslovak Legions, which were still in Russia in 1919.\nRenewed conflict\nIn August 1919, the Bolshevik regime in Hungary collapsed and the Romanians occupied central parts of the country, including its capital. Czechoslovakia also took advantage of the situation. The offer that it could take part in the occupation of Budapest was rejected, but on August 14 it captured Petržalka and Salgótarján. While they had to leave Salgotarjan, Petržalka became part of Bratislava. Transcarpathia was occupied in September 1919.\nAftermath\nThe defeat of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the Slovak Soviet Republic and the Romanian occupation of Budapest in August 1919 ended the war. Romanian troops withdrew from the occupied territory in March 1920. In this war, Czechoslovakia gained control over the territory of Slovakia, which before the war was part of Hungary. In the final phase of the war, there were more than 120,000 soldiers on both sides. Volunteers signed up for the Czechoslovak army, and Slovak volunteer units were established in Slovakia - Jánošík's troupe, Zbor Turčianských volunůník, Dobrovoľnická družina Slovákov, Tisovský volunůníci. Slovak volunteers mainly came from northern Slovak counties - they fought mainly in the battles for Zvolen, Banská Bystrica and Košice. According to historian Zdenek Kárník, 90 fallen soldiers on the side of the Czechoslovak army came from Slovakia and Subcarpathian Rus; 895 fallen soldiers (of which 640 were volunteers) came from the Czech Republic.\nSources\n*\n*\nReferences\nLiterature\n* Aliaksandr Piahanau, Czechoslovak-Hungarian Border Conflict, In: 1914-1918-online.
