Although successive movements of French troops would be harried by Spanish guerrilleros fighting along the way, on both sides of the Sierra Morena and in the steep gorge (defile) of Despeñaperros that separates Castile-La Mancha (including Madrid) and Andalusia, Dupont met with no resistance there.\nAt Alcolea, some 3,000 regular troops, accompanied by some armed civilians, tried, unsuccessfully, to stop Dupont's vastly superior forces at the bridge over the Guadalquivir and were forced to retreat to Córdoba. Dupont went on to capture Córdoba that same day, his troops ransacking the city over four days.\nThe seventy troops Dupont had left to protect the bridge were later massacred by guerrillas led by Juan de la Torre, the mayor of the town of Montoro.\nOne of the Spanish soldiers who fought at Alcolea was Pedro Agustín Girón, who would later become a minister of war, and who would also accuse General Echávarri of not having personally participated.\nAftermath\nIberia in revolt proceeded with the Capture of the Rosily Squadron.\nSee also\n*Battle of Bailén\n* Timeline of the Peninsular War\n*Uprising of Santa Cruz de Mudela\n*Uprising of Valdepeñas\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*  Commander in the Marins de la Garde Imperiale\n*"
