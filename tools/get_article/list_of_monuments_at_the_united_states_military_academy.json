The Academy was formally founded in 1802 and graduated its first class in October of the same year. It is the oldest of the five American service academies. Due to the academy's age and its unique purpose of producing Army officers, it is home to many monuments and memorials, the oldest dating back to the early 19th century, shortly after the academy's founding. The oldest monument is the Cadet Monument, dedicated in 1818 and located in the West Point Cemetery, while the newest is the US Grant statue, located across from Battle Monument and dedicated in 2019.\nMonuments\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n!  width=\"*\" | Monument\n!  width=\"*\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n!  width=\"*\" | Dedicated\n!  width=\"*\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n!  wdith=\"*\" class=\"unsortable\" | Reference\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Air Cadet Monument\n| align=\"center\" | 50px\n| align=\"center\" | 1945\n| Dedicated by members of the Corps of Cadets to their comrades who died during Cadet flight training.
