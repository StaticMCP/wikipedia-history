It is the provincial capital of the homonymous province. The city is known as the Carnival epicenter of the Dominican Republic for its tradition and culture, its large agricultural production methods throughout its province.\nHistory\nConcepción de la Vega (Real) was the first settlement in its province, having been founded in 1495 by Batholomew Columbus at the foot of a fortress built by his brother, Christopher Columbus in 1494, which was intended to guard the route to the interior gold deposits of the Cibao Valley. This Spanish settlement gradually grew around the fort. The name of the city honors and refers to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which in Spanish is commonly shortened to \"Concepción\"; and \"la Vega\" refers to the \"plain\" in which it is sited. Either the city itself or the antecedent fortress was founded on 8 December, this being the date of the Catholic feast of the Immaculate Conception. After 1508, when gold was found in quantity there, Concepción became the first gold boomtown in the island. It already had a cathedral, two convents, a hospital, and several administrative buildings. The first coin was minted in La Vega, and the first merchants settled there.\nBy 1510 it was one of the largest and most important European cities in the hemisphere. The city was destroyed and buried by an earthquake on December 2, 1562, and the survivors moved to the present site on the banks of the Camú River. The second foundation of the city corresponds to its current location and it is believed that it took place between the years 1562 and 1563. In the days of National Independence, the city of La Vega joined the cause of freedom with soldiers. On March 4, 1844, La Vega formalized its declaration in support of the War of Independence, and that same day it became the first town in the country to raise the national flag.\nCommerce, agriculture, and industry gained new momentum in the late 1800s and early 1900s. An event that strengthened the area's economic development was the inauguration of the railway between the port of Sánchez and the city of La Vega. The transport by this means of fruits and merchandise led to new living conditions, with settlers arriving from Santo Domingo, Santiago, Moca, and other places. The La Vega region today yields cacao, coffee, tobacco, rice, fruits, and cattle. The first theater in the country was also built in La Vega. In 1915, the city received the name of a cultured city due to its art and culture. In the place of the ruins of the first city, there is an archaeological park and a museum, the Pueblo Viejo National Park. Over the years, a town called Pueblo Viejo emerged in honor of being the first place where the city existed.\nGeography\nLa Vega is bounded on the north by the Camú River. This river flows about 100 kilometers before emptying into Yuna River. South of the city is the Cordillera Central, the largest mountain system of the Dominican Republic. El Ponton Field, a local airport, bounds the city on the east. To La Vega's west are the Camú River again and Montellano.\nClimate\nLa Vega has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen: Af)\n}}\nSectors\nCentro Ciudad sector\n{|\n| width=240 |\n*Arenoso (surrounding areas)\n*Brache Batista\n*Barrio Guarionex\n*Barrio Loteria\n*Barrio Militar\n*Barrio X\n*Bayacanes (surrounding areas)\n*Carmelitas\n*Camboya\n*Centro Ciudad (Margarita)\n*Conani\n*Cutupú (surrounding areas)\n*Don Bosco\n*Don Pedro\n*El Bolsillo\n* El Paraiso\n*El Campito\n*El Cerro (surrounding areas)\n*El Ensueño\n*El Napoles\n*El Riito\n*Ensanche Duarte\n*Gamundi\n*Guaigui (surrounding areas)\n*La Arboleda\n*La Boca Del Lobo\n*Las Carolinas\n*La Enramada\n*La Cigua\n*La Planta\n*La Riviera\n| valign=top |\n*Las Marias\n*Licey (surrounding areas)\n*Los Pomos\n*Los Robles\n*Los Multi-Familiares (Viejos y Nuevos)\n*Palmarito\n*Parque Hostos\n*Ponton\n*Puerto Rico\n*Rancho Abajo (surrounding areas)\n*Residencial Chimbin\n*Residencial Coral\n*Río Verde Abajo (surrounding areas)\n*Río Verde Arriba (surrounding areas)\n*San Antonio\n*San Martin\n*San Miguel\n*Santo Domingo Sabio\n*Soto (surrounding areas)\n*Villa Carolinas\n* Villa Olga\n*Villa Francisca\n*Villa Francisca II\n*Villa Margarita\n*Villa Mera\n*Villa Real\n*Villa Hollywood\n*Villa Lora\n*Villa Rosa\n*Zafaraya\n|}\nGovernment of Vega\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
