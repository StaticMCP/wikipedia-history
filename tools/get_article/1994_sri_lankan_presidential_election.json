This was the 3rd Presidential election held in the country's history, and the Nominations were accepted on 7 October 1994. Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga of the governing People's Alliance was elected as President, receiving 62% of the votes and becoming the first female President of Sri Lanka. It marked the end of the 17 year United National Party's rule in Sri Lanka, were they will be in opposition for 7 years until 2001.\nBackground\nPresident Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated on 1 May 1993 by the Tamil Tigers and was succeeded by the Prime Minister, Dingiri Banda Wijetunga. According to the Constitution, a President who assumed office to fill their predecessor's vacancy are prohibited to call an Early Presidential election. Therefore, the next Presidential election was scheduled between 2 November and 2 December 1994.\nWijetunga decided to dissolve Parliament and call an Snap Parliamentary General election in August, 1994. This resulted in the winning of People's Alliance, led by Chandrika Kumaratunga and a Cohabitation government with Wijetunga, who was from the United National Party. Kumaratunga was sworn in as Prime Minister on 19 August 1994.\nPresident Wijetunga chose not to for a term of his own in the upcoming Presidential election; therefore the United National Party selected Leader of the Opposition Gamini Dissanayake as their candidate. His main challenger was Prime Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga of the People's Alliance, whose party had won the Parliamentary elections earlier in 1994.\nElection\nNominations were accepted from 9.00am to 11.00am IST, on 7 October 1994, and the Date of the election was announced by the Gazette Extraordinary No.839/9, on 26 October 1994.\nOn 24 October 1994, during his presidential campaign, Gamini Dissanayake become a victim of an Assassination attempt by the Tamil Tigers. After his sudden death, His name on the ballot paper was replaced by his wife Srima Dissanayake, thus making the election the first Sri Lankan presidential election in which both main party candidates were women.\nThe campaign turned significantly less competitive following the assassination of the UNP’s original presidential candidate, Gamini Dissanayake, just weeks before the election. His death weakened the opposition’s organization and morale, leaving Kumaratunga with little effective challenge. As a result, she secured a comfortable and largely uncontested win, becoming Sri Lanka’s first female executive president.\nKumaratunga managed to win a landslide victory by securing 62% of the votes, and was inaugurated as the 5th President of Sri Lanka at the Presidential Secretariat, Colombo, on 12 November 1994.\nResults\nKumaratunga won the election by a record margin with 62.28% of the vote.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
