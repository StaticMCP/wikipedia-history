The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was created in 1956 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to honour non-English-speaking films produced outside the United States. The award is handed out annually, and is accepted by the winning film's director, although it is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Countries are invited by the Academy to submit their best films for competition according to strict rules, with only one film being accepted from each country.\nFor the 32nd Academy Awards, thirteen films were submitted in the category Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The Netherlands, Pakistan, Hong Kong and Singapore submitted films for the first time. The five nominated films came from Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands and West Germany.\nFrance won for the fifth time with Black Orpheus by Marcel Camus. Even tough the film was shot in Brazil, in Portuguese, and with a large Brazilian cast and crew, it was directed by a French filmmaker and produced by French companies, thus was deemed able to represent France.\nSubmissions\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
