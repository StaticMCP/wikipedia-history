Siwan became a fully-fledged district when it was split from Saran in 1976.\nSiwan derived its name from \"Shiva Man\", a Bandh Raja whose heirs ruled this area till Babar’s arrival. Maharajganj, which is another subdivision of Siwan district, may have found its name from the seat of the Maharaja there. A recently excavated marvellous statue of Vishnu at Village Bherbania from underneath a tree indicates that there were large numbers of followers of Lord Vishnu. Currently it is not located as border district of Bihar. The Gorkha king had briefly extended his kingdom to Siwan for a few years in the 1790s before the British started their rule and repulsed the Gorkhas and that is how the name got stuck to the region. It is now dominated by Yadavs and Rajputs.\nSiwan was a part of Banaras Kingdom during the 8th century. Muslims came here in the 13th century. Sikandar Lodi brought this area in his kingdom in the 15th century. Babar crossed Ghaghra river near Siswan in his return journey. In the end of the 17th century, the Dutch came first followed by the English. After the battle of Buxar in 1765 it became a part of Bengal. Siwan played an important role in 1857 independence movement. It is famous for the stalwart and sturdy ‘Bhoj-puries’, who have always been noted for their martial spirit and physical endurance and from whom the army and police personnel were largely drawn. A good number of them rebelled and rendered their services to Babu Kunwar Singh. The anti pardah movement in Bihar was started by Sri Braj Kishore Prasad who also belonged to Siwan in response to the Non Co-Operative movement in 1920.\nHistorical places near Tarwara\nKorara\nA village in Mairwa Blcok, which is situated at 2&nbsp;km south from Mairwa Dham. where there is the first Sai temple of siwan district along with temple of Lord Shiva and Mother Durga.\nDon\nA village in the Darauli block where there are remnants of a fort, which is said to be connected with the famous hero of the Mahabharat, Acharya Dronacharya the guru of both Kaurava and Pandav.
