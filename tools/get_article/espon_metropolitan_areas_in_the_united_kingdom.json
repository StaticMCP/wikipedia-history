It also excluded city regions such as those formed in Greater Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield, which are typically areas now covered by combined authorities.\nSummary\nIn 2001, there were 46 metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom with a populations in the range 150,000 to 25 million inhabitants, according to the ESPON project, with the following population distribution:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"alignment:center;\"|Category\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Populations (2011)\n!Count\n|-\n!A\n|style=\"width:150px;\"|12.8 – 25 million\n|1\n|-\n!B\n|style=\"width:150px;\"|6.4 – 12.8 million\n|0\n|-\n!C\n|style=\"width:150px;\"|3.2 – 6.4 million\n|1\n|-\n!D\n|style=\"width:150px;\"|1.6 – 3.2 million\n|3\n|-\n!E\n|style=\"width:150px;\"|0.8 – 1.6 million\n|7\n|-\n!F\n| style=\"width:150px;\"|0.4 – 0.8 million\n|9\n|-\n!Gi\n| style=\"width:150px;\"|0.2 – 0.4 million\n|19\n|-\n!Gii\n| style=\"width:150px;\"|\n!Metro Rank\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Metropolitan area\n!Metro Population (2001)\n|-\n!Greater London\n|8,173,941\n|1\n|London\n|13,709,000\n|-\n!rowspan=3|West Midlands\n|rowspan=3|5,601,847\n|2\n|Birmingham\n|3,683,000\n|-\n|20\n|Stoke\n|456,000\n|-\n|39\n|Telford\n|209,000\n|-\n!rowspan=5|North West\n|rowspan=5|7,052,177\n|3\n|Manchester\n|2,556,000\n|-\n|5\n|Liverpool–Birkenhead\n|2,241,000\n|-\n|22\n|Blackburn–Burnley\n|391,000\n|-\n|24\n|Preston\n|354,000\n|-\n|27\n|Blackpool\n|304,000\n|-\n!rowspan=5|Yorkshire and the Humber\n|rowspan=5|5,283,733\n|4\n|Leeds–Bradford\n|2,302,000\n|-\n|7\n|Sheffield\n|1,569,000\n|-\n|21\n|Hull\n|419,000\n|-\n|35\n|York\n|234,000\n|-\n|43\n|Grimsby\n|174,000\n|-\n!rowspan=2 | North East\n|rowspan=2|2,596,886\n|6\n|Newcastle–Sunderland\n|1,599,000\n|-\n|17\n|Middlesbrough\n|656,000\n|-\n!rowspan=5|South East\n|rowspan=5|8,634,750\n|8\n|Portsmouth–Southampton\n|1,547,000\n|-\n|15\n|Brighton–Worthing–Littlehampton\n|769,000\n|-\n|30\n|Milton Keynes\n|271,000\n|-\n|33\n|Oxford\n|244,000\n|-\n|45\n|Hastings–Bexhill\n|164,000\n|-\n!rowspan=4|East Midlands\n|rowspan=4|4,533,222\n|9\n|Nottingham–Derby\n|1,543,000\n|-\n|16\n|Leicester\n|745,000\n|-\n|28\n|Northampton\n|288,000\n|-\n|42\n|Lincoln\n|176,000\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Wales\n|rowspan=2|\n|11\n|Cardiff and South Wales valleys\n|1,097,000\n|-\n|19\n|Swansea\n|462,000\n|-\n!rowspan=8|South West\n|rowspan=8|5,288,935\n|12\n|Bristol\n|1,041,000\n|-\n|18\n|Bournemouth–Poole\n|531,000\n|-\n|25\n|Plymouth\n|343,000\n|-\n|31\n|Swindon\n|260,000\n|-\n|32\n|Exeter\n|259,000\n|-\n|36\n|Torbay\n|231,000\n|-\n|44\n|Gloucester\n|166,000\n|-\n|46\n|Cheltenham\n|164,000\n|-\n!rowspan=6|East of England\n|rowspan=6|5,846,965\n|23\n|Norwich\n|364,000\n|-\n|29\n|Cambridge\n|283,000\n|-\n|34\n|Ipswich\n|240,000\n|-\n|37\n|Peterborough\n|219,000\n|-\n|40\n|Bedford\n|202,000\n|-\n|41\n|Colchester\n|191,000\n|-\n!rowspan=4|Scotland\n|rowspan=4|5,404,700\n|10\n|Glasgow\n|1,395,000\n|-\n|14\n|Edinburgh\n|782,000\n|-\n|26\n|Aberdeen\n|332,000\n|-\n|38\n|Dundee\n|211,000\n|-\n!Northern Ireland\n|\n|13\n|Belfast\n|799,000\n|}\nSee also\n* List of metropolitan economies in the United Kingdom\n* Core Cities Group\n* Combined authority\n* List of towns and cities in England by population\n* List of urban areas in the United Kingdom\n* Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England\n* Travel to work area\n* List of metropolitan areas in Europe by population\n* List of metropolitan areas by population for the world\n* Larger urban zone\nReferences"
