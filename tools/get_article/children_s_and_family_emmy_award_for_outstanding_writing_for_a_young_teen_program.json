The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022, and is a sister category to the Children's and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Preschool or Children's Program, which honors shows aimed at younger audiences, and one of the four categories honoring writing at the Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nThe inaugural recipient of the award was Netflix series Heartstopper. The current holder of the award is the Disney+ series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which won at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards. Writing was originally honored there with the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Children's Series, which was presented from 1985 to 2020.\nWinners and nominations\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"20%\" | Series\n! width=\"20%\" | Writer/s\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n! width=\"3%\" | Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022(1st)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n|Heartstopper\n| Alice Oseman\n| Netflix\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n| Better Nate Than Ever\n| Tim Federle\n| rowspan=3|Disney+\n|-\n| Doogie Kameāloha, M.D.\n| Kourtney Kang\n|-\n| The Mysterious Benedict Society\n| Phil Hay, Matt Manfredi\n|-\n|Sweet Tooth\n| Justin Boyd, Noah Griffith, Christina Ham, Haley Harris, Jim Mickle, Michael R.
