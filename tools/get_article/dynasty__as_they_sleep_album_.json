The album is the first to feature drummer Tony Lukitsh.\nCritical reception\nNick Habisch of Sputnik Music states:\n\"Overall, As They Sleep has released a very solid Death Metal album. Encasing melody and brutality within the same set of songs, the band puts out a very talented and engaging album, sure to please fans of bands such as The Black Dahlia Murder, or other related acts. I highly recommend Dynasty, and it will become a staple of my collection for quite some time.\" He gave the album a 4.5 Star rating out of 5 Stars.\nSteve at Indie Vision Music says: \"This is one of the best pure metal albums released this year. It is hard to believe that a band with this much talent could slip through the cracks for so long, but they are here now and ready to kick your teeth in. With the pummeling drums to the nasty riffs, Dynasty lays a good old-fashioned beat down on you. If you love death metal, do yourself a favor and go buy this album when it comes out on Monday November 22.\" He gave the album 4 Stars out of 5.\nConcept and lyrical themes\nDynasty is concept album. As stated by Vocalist Aaron Bridgewater, the album talks about the rise and fall of ancient civilizations up to present time. The song \"The Third Reich\", for instance, talks about Adolf Hitler's squadron and how they massacred many people in their strikes. The song \"To the Republic\" talks about the United States Economy and far the Government has fallen from God.\nTrack listing\n|title1 = Oracle of the Dead\n|length1 = 3:23\n|title2 = To the Republic\n|length2 = 3:52\n|title3 = The Third Reich\n|length3 = 3:43\n|title4 = Bedlam at the Nile\n|length4 = 4:07\n|title5 = The Darkest Ages\n|length5 = 4:45\n|title6 = Ritual\n|length6 = 1:30\n|title7 = The Offering\n|length7 = 3:11\n|title8 = Attila\n|length8 = 3:11\n|title9 = Poseidon\n|length9 = 3:45\n|title10 = God of War\n|length10 = 2:49\n|title11 = The Unseen\n|length11 = 3:34\n}}\nCredits\nAs They Sleep\n* Aaron Bridgewater – vocals\n* Nick Morris – guitars, producer, engineer\n* Barry Gomez – guitars\n* Derek Kosiba – bass\n* Tony Lukitsh – drums\nProduction\n* Troy Glessner – mastering\n* Ronn Miller – mixing assistant\n* Jason Suecof – mixing\nArt\n* Ryan Clark – design\n* Jerad Knudson – photography\nReferences"
