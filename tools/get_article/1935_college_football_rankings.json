The Minnesota Golden Gophers (8–0), led by head coach Bernie Bierman, were selected as national champions in the UP poll, the Toledo Cup voting, and the Boand System. The SMU Mustangs (12–0 prior to losing the 1936 Rose Bowl), led by consensus All-Americans Bob Wilson and J. C. Wetsel, were selected as national champions by Dickinson and Houlgate.\nChampions (by ranking)\nMajor rankings (both contemporary and retroactive) have varied in who they identify as the season champion(s). Schools identified as 1935 season champions by at least one such ranking include: Minnesota, LSU, Princeton, SMU, and TCU as season champions:\n*Associated Press final ranking: Minnesota, Princeton, SMU (co-champions)\n*Berryman QPRS: SMU\n*Billingsley Report: Minnesota\n*Boand System: Minnesota\n*College Football Researchers Association: Minnesota\n*Dickinson System: SMU\n*Dunkel System: Princeton\n*Helms Athletic Foundation: Minnesota\n*Houlgate System: SMU\n*Litkenhous Ratings: Minnesota\n*National Championship Foundation: Minnesota\n*Poling System: Minnesota\n*Sagarin Ratings Elo chess method: SMU\n*Sagarin Ratings Predictor method: SMU\n*Toledo Cup: Minnesota\n*Williamson System: LSU and TCU (co-champions)\nNote: Associated Press rankings, Boand System, Dickinson System, Dunkel System, Houlgate System, Litkenhous Ratings, Poling System, Toledo Cup, and Williamson System were given contemporarily. All other methods were given retroactively.\nAssociated Press rankings\nWeekly top ten rankings were published by the Associated Press news service throughout the season. The rankings were made by Associated Press sports editor Alan Gould.\nGould's final rankings on December 3, 1935, declared a three-way tie for first between SMU, Princeton, and Minnesota. Controversy surrounding his selections lead Gould to instead poll the nation's sportswriters in subsequent years; thus the AP Poll would officially begin in 1936.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each writer was asked to rank the top ten teams, and the UP then assigned points with ten points being awarded to a first-place vote, nine points for a second-place vote, etc. The leaders in the poll were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Fordham\n12. North Carolina\n13. Duke\n14. Holy Cross\n15. Auburn\n16. Northwestern\n17. Alabama\n18. (tie) Army, Iowa, UCLA\n21. (tie) Nebraska, Ohio\n23. (tie) Marquette, Washington, Saint Mary's\n26. (tie) Temple, Dartmouth, NYU\nToledo Cup\nThe Toledo Cup was presented to the college football national champion. Overseen by a committee including westbrook Pegler, Avery Brundage, Gustavus Kirby, Lynn St. John, Wilbur C. Smith, Stewart Edward White, and Theodore Roosevelt Jr., the Toledo Cup award was based on input from a judge's committee of 250 sports editors of leading newspapers.\nA preliminary vote was taken in December 1935 with the following results:\n1.
