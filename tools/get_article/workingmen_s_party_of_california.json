Remembered primarily for its anti-Chinese racism, the party's famous slogan was \"The Chinese must go!\"\nOrganizational history\n, founder of the Workingmen's Party of California]]\nAs a result of heavy unemployment from the Long Depression, Sand Lot rallies erupted in San Francisco that led to the Party's formation in 1877. In 1878, the party won 51 out of 152 delegates to California's Second Constitutional Convention (the most of any organized party), rewriting the state constitution to deny Chinese Americans voting rights in California. The most important part of the constitution included the formation of a California Railroad Commission that would oversee the activities of the Central Pacific Railroad that were run by Crocker, Huntington, Hopkins and Stanford. In 1879, the party won 10 seats in the State Senate and 16 in the State Assembly.\nThe party's goal was to \"rid the country of Chinese cheap labor,\" taking aim against Chinese emigrants and the railroad companies that employed them. Kearney's attacks against the Chinese were of a particularly virulent and openly racist nature, and found considerable support among working-class Californians of the time. Ironically, the party's strongest supporters were immigrants themselves; a majority of party members were Irish-born, with dedicated German, French, Swiss-Italian, Scandinavian and Spanish clubs. The party even attempted to organize the city's black community.\nFollowing the 1879 elections, the party began to decline in power and influence as its elected officials, stonewalled by their opponents and mostly inexperienced themselves, were unable to fulfill their bold campaign promises. In 1880, the party was torn apart by one faction seeking to affiliate with the Democratic Party and another seeking to affiliate with the Greenback-Labor Party. By October 1881, the Workingmen's Party had effectively ceased to exist. The next year, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act.\nRelation to the WPUS\nKearney's party should not be confused with the Workingmen's Party of the United States (WPUS), which was mostly based in the Eastern United States. The branches of the Workingmen's Party of the United States located in California were absorbed into the Workingmen's Party of California after \"practically all members\" of the former abandoned it for the latter, which was growing at a rapid rate and had adopted similar language. One such member was Charles J. Beerstecher, elected to the Railroad Commission in 1879, who originally headed the German language section of the WPUS in San Francisco.\nMembers\nCity officials\n* Denis Kearney, Party President\n* John G.
