With the retirement of long time captain Jamie Lyon, the team captain was Daly Cherry-Evans with Jake Trbojevic named as vice-captain. The club competed in the National Rugby League's 2017 Telstra Premiership and played its home games at the 23,000 capacity Brookvale Oval, which for the first time was known as Lottoland due to a sponsorship agreement.\nSquad list\n|list1b=\n|list1c=\n|list1d=\n|list1e=\n|list1f=\n|list1g=\n|list1h=\n|list1i=\n|list1j=\n|list1k=\n|list1l=\n|list1m=\n|list2a=\n|list2b=\n|list2c=\n|list2d=\n|list2e=\n|list2f=\n|list2g=\n|list2h=\n|list2i=\n|list2j=\n|list2k=\n|list2l=\n|list2m=\n|list3a=\n|list3b=\n|list3c=\n|list3d=\n|list3e=\n|coach=Trent Barrett\n|assistant=John Cartwright\n|legend1= Injured\n}}\n2017 signings/transfers\nNote: The \"Out\" column is from the players who were with the team as of the end of the 2016 NRL season.
