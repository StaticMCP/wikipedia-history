The ward contained over 160 listed buildings that are recorded in the National Heritage List for England. Of these, four are listed at Grade&nbsp;I, the highest of the three grades, four are at Grade&nbsp;II*, the middle grade, and the others are at Grade&nbsp;II, the lowest grade. The ward was to the west of the city centre, extending to the northwest, it included the areas of Radford and The Park, and it is mainly residential.\nThe most important buildings in the ward are the remains of Nottingham Castle, and the ducal palace built within its walls, later converted into Castle Museum and Art Gallery. These buildings are listed together with structures within the original grounds of the castle. Also in the ward are churches, including Nottingham Cathedral; many of these are listed, together with associated structures. The city is built on sandstone, and many caves have been carved into it, some of which are ornamental, and are listed. Most of the other listed buildings are houses, offices and associated structures, and the others include public houses, shops, a tunnel, a former pumping station, boundary markers, former lace and textile factories, war memorials, a school, statues and a bust, a former warehouse, a bandstand, a former nurses' home and associated structures, a waterworks depot, telephone kiosks, a former cinema, and a theatre.__NOTOC__\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\n|-\n!
