With his army reinforced, he invaded San Luis Province, where he defeated Colonel Juan Pascual Pringles, who was killed in a battle near the Quinto River.\nDevelopment\nHaving occupied San Luis, Quiroga's next target was the governor of Mendoza Province, José Videla Castillo.\nQuiroga's rapid advance forced him to give battle before he was properly organized.\nSoon after Quiroga had entered Mendoza, the two armies met on 22 January 1831 at a place in the hills called Rodeo de Chacón, near the Tunuyán river.\nVidela Castillo's army of 1,500 men was commanded by Colonels Lorenzo Barcala, Indalecio Chenaut and José Aresti. The Federal army was commanded by Quiroga from the back of a cart, as he could not move due to the rheumatism that tortured him.\nHis divisions were commanded by Colonels Prudencio Torres, José Ruiz Huidobro, Pantaleón Argañaraz and Juan de Dios Vargas.\nAt the start of the battle, Torres shouted for the soldiers who have fought under him in the campaigns of Lavalle, and who were under the command of Chenaut.\nThey had been treated too harshly, so they just dropped out of the fight.\nThe battle lasted only a few minutes after Quiroga launched a cavalry charge into the Unitarian ranks, which were disrupted by the desertion of Chenaut's Regiment.\nAftermath\nThe Unitarian chiefs fled to Córdoba, where Videla Castillo was promoted to general.\nA few days later, General Paz was taken prisoner by the Federalists, and Lamadrid retreated with the Unitarian army to San Miguel de Tucumán.\nQuiroga seized Mendoza and San Luis without resistance, while his officers recovered La Rioja and San Juan almost equally peacefully.\nFrom there, a few months later Quiroga advanced to Tucuman with a new army of 2,000 men which would defeat Lamadrid in the Battle of La Ciudadela. With that, the civil war ended for some years, with all of Argentina for the first time being controlled by the Federalists.\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n* |url=http://www.revisionistas.com.ar/?p=3138\n|work=Revisionistas |title=Facundo Quiroga}}\n*\n*\n*\n*"
