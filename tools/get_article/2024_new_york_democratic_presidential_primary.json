He faced a primary challenge from author, progressive activist, and 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, and former Congressman Dean Phillips. All three candidates filed to appear on the ballot by the January 19, 2024, filing deadline.\nNew York also officially tallies and reports the number of voters who leave their ballots blank. New York does not give voters the option of voting \"uncommitted\" the way that some other states do, but protest votes can be registered by submitting a blank ballot.\nEndorsements\nForbes 3050 Summit |url=https://www.forbes.com/video/6322204085112/hillary-clinton-discusses-leadership-2024-and-opportunities-for-women--forbes-3050-summit/ |access-date=May 3, 2023 |website=Forbes |language=en}}\n* James Comey, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (2013–2017), United States Deputy Attorney General (2003–2005), United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (2002–2003) (Independent)\nUS Senators\n* Kirsten Gillibrand, New York (2009–present), U.S. Representative from NY-20 (2007–2009)\n* Chuck Schumer, New York (1999–present), Senate Majority Leader (2021–present), Senate Minority Leader (2017–2021), U.S. Representative from NY-09 (1993–1999), NY-10 (1983–1993) and NY-16 (1981–1983)\nUS Representatives\n* Jamaal Bowman, NY-16 (2021–present)\n* Grace Meng, NY-06 (2013–present)\n* Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, NY-14 (2019–present)\n* Pat Ryan, NY-18 (2023–present), NY-19 (2022–2023)\n* Thomas Downey, NY-02 (1975–1993)\n* Carolyn Maloney, NY-12 (2013–2023) and NY-14 (1993–2013)\n* Tom Suozzi, NY-03 (2017–2023, 2024–present), candidate for Governor of New York in 2022\nState officials\n* Kathy Hochul, Governor of New York (2021–present); Lieutenant Governor of New York (2015–2021); U.S. Representative for NY-26 (2011–2013)\n* Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York (2011–2021); Attorney General of New York (2007–2011); United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (1997–2001)\nMayors\n* Eric Adams, 110th mayor of New York City, New York (2022–present)\nIndividuals\n* Jack Schlossberg, grandson of John F.
