He uses his broker to find a potential bride. A wealthy Rathnapuri Zamindar, Vijayakumar is introduced to him by his marriage broker. In a surprising change of events, he weds Thenmozhi, Rathinapuri Zamin's daughter, right away.\nFollowing the marriage, Vetrivel learns that the zamindar has lost everything, including the palace, and is deeply in-debt of 10 crore. Now that he has no other choice, he must move to his apartment with his wife, brother-in-law, and father-in-law. Due to this betrayal, he is upset with his spouse and in-laws. Zamindar and Vetri's brother-in-law Bala cause misunderstandings by using Vetri's money without consulting him, which only makes Vetri angrier. One day, Vetri receives an invitation from his boss, Amalraj, to the workplace party with his family. During the celebration, Zamindar and Bala start a disturbance with Vetri's boss Amalraj, causing Vetri to lose his job. As a result, he drives their in-laws out of the house.\nMeanwhile, in Bombay, a terrorist group led by Baski, a doppelgänger for Vetri's boss Amalraj, is preparing an attack in several locations in Chennai. Praveena, Vetri's neighbour, is a hooker who entices Baski to her apartment. In an attempt to win Vetri's forgiveness, Bala and Zamindar bring Baski to their flat after mistaking him for Vetri's boss, Amalraj. Unable to evade them, Baski had to go to their house. He gets electrocuted as he turns on the bathroom light switch to use the restroom. The family smashes him hard with wooden blocks, and Baski instantly passes away there. Praveena witnesses this, at which point Thenmozhi threatens to have Praveena join them for her involvement in the crime.\nTo properly dispose of the body and place it in the mortuary as an unclaimed deadbody, Vetri, his family, and Praveen team up with Body Balram. After arriving home, they see Amalraj and are horrified to learn from television news that the body they disposed of was that of a wanted terrorist and also a 50 lakhs bounty has been announced by the police department.\nThe family and Vetri now plan to remove the corpse from the hospital mortuary themselves. Body Balram also visits the hospital in search of the deceased, now being aware of the declared bounty. Meanwhile, terrorists capture Amalraj after mistaking him for Baski. When the corpse is first brought to the commissioner by Vetrivel, he gets alerted by Amalraj about the police commissioner's connection to the terrorists and they immediately escape from the commissioner. When they eventually try to rescue Amalraj from the terrorists, a struggle breaks out.\nThe terrorists finally admit that they detonated a bomb in an omnibus in Koyambedu, which the police were able to locate and neutralise with the aid of a Vetrivel. At last, the police commissioner and the terrorists are taken into custody, and Vetrivel receives the bounty.\nCast\nProduction\nThe film was produced by G.N.

Prashanth Vallavan of The New Indian Express wrote, \"The premise, the setting, the long list of supporting cast, and even the brand of wacky adventure, feel outdated. However, even with an incoherent screenplay, the dialogues and the humour could have saved Inga Naan Thaan Kingu, which is unfortunately not what happened\". Abhinav Subramanian of The Times of India gave a more positive review, calling it \"your typical Santhanam fair – situational comedy revolving around a bunch of dimwits. What makes it tick is Ezhichur Aravindan's original scripting\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
