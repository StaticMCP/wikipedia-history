He was promoted to lieutenant in September 1909. Sinclair made his debut in first-class cricket for the Royal Navy Cricket Club against the British Army cricket team at Lord's in 1913. He served in the First World War, during which he was promoted to lieutenant commander in September 1917. Following the war, he made two further first-class appearances for the Royal Navy in 1919, against Cambridge University and the British Army. Playing as a right-arm medium pace bowler, he took a total of 9 wickets in his three matches, with best figures of 4 for 162. He was placed on the retired list at his own request in April 1931, at which point he was granted the rank of commander. Sinclair died at Orpington in December 1966.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
