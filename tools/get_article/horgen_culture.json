The Horgen culture may derive from the Pfyn culture and early Horgen pottery is similar to the earlier Cortaillod culture pottery of Twann, Switzerland.  It is named for one of the principal sites, in Horgen, Switzerland.\nDates\nThe Horgen culture started around 3500/3400 cal BC and lasted until 2850 cal BC. Tree ring dates range from 3370 – 2864 BC.\nDistribution\nThe Horgen core area is in Northern Switzerland and Southwest Germany near Lake Constance, but it may have reached farther north along the Rhine River.  It may have had ties to the French Seine-Oise-Marne culture.\nSites include Horgen, Hauterive-Champréves, Eschenz, and Zürich.\nAt Feldmeilen-Vorderfeld and Meilen on the right bank of Lake Zurich near Zürich, four layers of Pfyn culture artifacts (4350-3950 BC calibrated) are followed by five Horgen culture (3350-2950 BC) layers were found at Feldmeilen.  In nearby Meilen, one Pfyn layer (4250-4000 BC) followed by three Horgen (3300-2500 BC) layers were discovered.\nTraits\nThere were three phases of pottery; early, middle, and late.  The early pottery exhibits an affinity with the Pfyn and maybe the Cortaillod at Twann, Switzerland.  The spindle whorls on the pottery may indicate connections to the southern Funnelbeaker culture and early Baden culture.  The middle phase (found at Naschdorf-Strandbad, Lake Constance and Dullenried, Federsee) may be influenced by more westerly traditions.  The final Horgen phase exhibits similarities to the Burgerroth, Wartberg, and Goldberg III cultures.\nThe pottery was less refined and decorated than the earlier Cortaillod culture.  However, the flint industry was well developed and produced elegant stone tools.\nPigs became increasingly important during the Horgen era.  Pig bones were the most common bones found in the village midden heaps, accounting for up to 70% of all bones.\nThe Horgen culture practiced copper smelting to a limited extent, though copper finds are rare and evidence of processing is sporadic. Ötzi the iceman, who was found with a copper axe, also had stone tools of Horgen culture type.\nGallery\nFile:Landesmuseum Württemberg Stuttgart Neolithikum 042.jpg\nFile:Archäologie im Parkhaus Opéra - Horgener Kultur - Steinbeilklinge mit 'Zwischenfutter' aus Hirschgeweih und Geschäftete Hacke aus Hirschgeweih (Replik) 2013-03-10 16-11-58 -crop-.JPG\nFile:Archäologie im Parkhaus Opéra - Horgener Kultur - Steinbeil in 'Zwischenfutter' aus Hirschgeweih aus Originalsediment 2013-03-04 16-25-52 (P7700).JPG\nFile:Archäologie im Parkhaus Opéra - Ausstellung im Tiefparkhaus Sechseläutenplatz - Horgener Kultur - Schmuckkette (Kopie) 2014-10-31 17-12-32.jpg\nFile:Archäologie im Parkhaus Opéra - Netz zum Fischfang mit Schwimmern aus Holz und Netzsenkern aus Stein (Nachbildung) 2013-03-04 16-11-56 (P7700).JPG\nFile:Archäologie im Parkhaus Opéra - Ausstellung im Tiefparkhaus Sechseläutenplatz - Horgener Kultur - Silexdolch aus Norditalien (Replik) und Pfeilspitzen 2014-10-31 17-13-17.jpg\nFile:Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen-07.jpg|alt=\nFile:Heidenstein01.jpg\nFile:Dolmen du Plant de Rives (side).jpg|alt=\nFile:Degernau dolmen, Germany.png\nFile:PierrePercee01.jpg\nFile:Pierre percee Traves dolmen 2.JPG\nFile:Dolmen Oberbipp 3.jpg|Oberbipp dolmen\nFile:Landesmuseum Württemberg Stuttgart Neolithikum 156.jpg|Wooden wheel fragment, c. 3000 BC\nFile:Goldberg axe 1.jpg|Alpine copper axe, 4th millennium BC\nSee also\n* Schwörstadt-type dolmen\n* Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps\n* Prehistoric pile dwellings around Lake Zurich\n* Mondsee group\nReferences\nExternal links"
