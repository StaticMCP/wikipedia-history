This was the first season to air after the premiere of the American version of The Office, by co-creator Greg Daniels, which led to him becoming even less involved with the show.\nEpisodes\n| ProdCode=8ABE22\n| Viewers=6.84\n| ShortSummary=The Hills travel to Montana to visit Peggy's mother.

Meanwhile, Hank discovers a mistake on his driver's license and is sent through a boatload of red tape in order to fix it—a task made all the more onerous when Dale reports Hank as a threat to America's national security, though Dale also provides the key to resolving the problem.\n| LineColor=006363\n}}\n| ProdCode=9ABE06\n| Viewers=4.69\n| ShortSummary=When Hank agrees to take in a soldier's pet, he gets stuck with a vicious aging beast of a cat named Duke.
