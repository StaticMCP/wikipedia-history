Discovery and headquartered in Miami, Florida, which started as a programming block on the Latin American version of Discovery Channel. It launched on 1 November 1996, with programming aimed for older children and preschoolers. It was owned by Discovery Networks Latin America and is one of two Discovery Kids-branded channels that remains airing (the other being Discovery Kids India). The programming is entirely in either Spanish or Portuguese, depending on the region.\nThe channel is divided into six live feeds: Pan-regional, Colombia, Southern (plus a Chilean subfeed), Mexico and Brazil, each with their own HD simulcast feeds. Until 2019, the channel had an HD version of the channel with different schedules broadcasting to all of Latin America. The network is also available in the Caribbean alongside several islands in the Americas, such as Barbados, Grenada, Jamaica and Puerto Rico.\nHistory\nThe Beginning era (1996–2002)\nOn 1 November 1996, the channel launched and programming was aimed for older children and preschoolers. Preschool programming aired in the mornings, while shows for older children aired in the afternoons-evenings. The channel was originally named Discovery Kids Channel, but was shortened to simply Discovery Kids in official promos and bumpers. Its slogan was \"Discovery Kids is not an infants channel, it's a kids channel!\". The logo originally showed a white stick figure jumping on a red background.\nIn 1998, Discovery Kids changed its name, with the word \"channel\" getting dropped. The logo got updated, now being a planet with a ring underneath it. Its new slogan \"Baterías incluidas\" made its debut.\nThe Rainbow era (2002–2005)\nIn April, 2002, preschool programming began airing around the clock on weekdays, while shows for older children only aired around the clock on weekends. The channel's current slogan \"¡Aquí, en Discovery Kids!\" also made its debut.\nIn January, 2003, the channel changed its programming to target preschoolers, removing all shows for older children, which furthermore, changed its demographic to children under 8 years of age.\nIn the early-to-mid 2000s, a website for the channel was launched, titled \"Tu Discovery Kids\".\nIn February, 2005, Doki, the channel's mascot, was introduced, originally appearing in promos. Several prototypes of the mascot were made on 28 October 2004. His name is an abbreviation of the English term \"A Dog for Kids\".\nThe Imaginary era (2005–2009)\nIn March, 2005, the channel itself rebranded, which furthermore, also turned Doki into a standalone mascot.\nIn 2006, the Doki Descubre shorts began airing on the channel, airing until the year 2010.\nIn 2008, a new mascot was introduced, named Mundi. Originally made to celebrate Earth Day, it later became one of the standalone mascots for the channel.\nThe Park era (2009–2013)\nIn March, 2009, the channel received a new look. The logo now depicts a green K with a yellow D enclosed in a blue sphere, alongside a yellow ring in the K. The channel also created specials based on several themes, such as ambience, reading, and sports. The programming was also changed to focus on shows for children with up to 10 years of age. Newer mascots also made their first appearance: Oto, Fico, Anabella, and Gabi. The change originally appeared in Mexico, Argentina, and Chile on 30 March, before expanding to other regions on 30 May, and eventually expanded to Discovery Familia in the year 2010.\nIn December, 2009, a TV series based on its mascots, named Las Aventuras de Doki, premiered, being produced by Nelvana.\nIn 2010, the final Doki Descubre short aired on the channel.\nThe World era (2013–2016)\nIn April, 2013, another TV series based on its mascots, simply titled Doki, premiered, being produced by Portfolio Entertainment. The channel got rebranded as well, with the logo now being in 3D, rather than flat 2D. A high-definition feed also launched, with the D in the logo being replaced with the initials HD. The Discovery Kids logo was portrayed as a planet, full of colorful and bright buildings and houses, and the channel's mascots all lived in there.\nIn September, 2014, the entire channel started airing entirely in 16:9. Back then, the channel mostly aired in 4:3, with some 16:9 programs airing since the rise of HD TVs.\nOn 5 October 2015, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures premiered on this channel, which was also the first program for older children to be premiered after January 2003, originally carrying a TV-Y7 rating in the United States. It was also the only TV show on the channel to be based on an arcade game.\nThe Modern era (2016–2021)\nOn 1 April 2016, programming for older children returned after a 13-year hiatus for afternoons and evenings while preschool programming continues airing in the mornings. The logo was updated as well, replacing the \"D\" sphere with a speech bubble and removing the ring around the K. Doki characters were also removed from the bumpers and as the channel's mascots, though its TV series was still aired until December 2019.\nOn 2 January 2017, Angry Birds Toons premiered, making it the only TV show on the channel to be based on a mobile game.\nCurrent era (2021–present)\nOn 7 April 2021, the channel received a new logo, designed by Spanish design agency Dtmg.tv Studio, with the \"D\" speech bubble being changed back to a sphere, and the K becoming more lowercase. Children also appear in promos.\nProgramming\nWebsite\nDiscovery Kids has a website that launched in the early-to-mid 2000s, with the app launching in the early-to-mid 2010s. A Brazilian version was also made, with all of its content being translated into Portuguese.\nOne common feature of the site are its online games, which originally required the Flash Player plugin.\nThe site offers games and formerly interactive books, and activities. At launch, the website was titled Tu Discovery Kids, with the app being simply titled Discovery Kids at launch.\nIn March 2005, the website received a major update. New games based on the channel's mascot were made, such as Saltando con Doki.\nIn 2008, the website received another major update.

Accounts were also implemented.\nIn 2011, the website received yet another major update, now featuring a 3D logo casting shadows in the banner. During this era, the app launched.\nBetween February 2012 and 2018, a webpage appeared on the website, title Kids en Control. Kids en Control allows children to vote for shows, similar to Cartoon Network's 'Votatoon' which was exclusive to Latin America. The show that have the most votes would air via marathons on Saturdays.\nIn April 2013, the website received a minor update. The background has been changed to the one from the new look at the time.

The new website is also geo-blocked, being exclusive to Latin America. All of the Flash games from the old sites were also removed due to Adobe Flash Player's end-of-life.
