It is the band's first single off of their self-titled fifth studio album, and to feature lead vocalist Danny Worsnop since his departure in 2015. He returned in October 2016, after the departure of former vocalist Denis Stoff. The single was released on 21 September 2017 by the label, Sumerian Records. The song was used in a trailer for the racing game \"MX vs. ATV All Out\", which was released on 27 March 2018.\nMusical style and themes\nLoudwire described the song as having \"punchy, downtuned rhythms and forceful drumming\" in the background with Worsnop's clean, melodic singings over the top of it. In addition to the traditional rock elements, synthesized electronic \"whoa-oh\" sound effects play over parts of the song. 7\"\n|title1 = Into the Fire\n|note1 = Album Version\n|length1 = 3:57\n|title2 = Into the Fire\n|note2 = Radio Edit\n|length2 = 3:30\n}}\n| title1 = Into the Fire\n| length1 = 3:57\n| title2 = Into the Fire\n| note2 = Acoustic Version\n| length2 = 3:28\n| title3 = Into the Fire\n| note3 = Radio Edit\n| length3 = 3:30\n}}\nPersonnel\n* Danny Worsnop – lead vocals, additional guitar\n* Ben Bruce – lead guitar, backing vocals\n* Cameron Liddell – rhythm guitar\n* Sam Bettley – bass\n* James Cassells – drums\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
