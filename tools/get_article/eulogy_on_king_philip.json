      "text": "# Eulogy on King Philip\n\nEulogy on King Philip is a printed text of a speech delivered by William Apess in 1836 to, among other things, commemorate Metacom, also known as King Phillip, 160 years after his death. The speech was delivered at the prestigious Odeon lecture hall on Federal Street in Boston, Massachusetts. Metacom is still remembered as the leader of an allied indigenous force that engaged in a consequential war with New England colonists, 1675–1676.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* .\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.wgbh.org/forum-network/lectures/a-community-reading-of-william-apesss-eulogy-on-metacom  A Community Reading of William Apess's Eulogy on Metacom].
