The Mayor of Lübeck, Johann Wittenborg, was put in command of an attack force of some 3,000 men, and 50 small seagoing ships, 5 of which had been paid for by Magnus Eriksson, King of Sweden.\nAs Wittenborg's fleet sailed through the narrow Øresund en route to Copenhagen, he was persuaded to attack the town of Helsingborg and its fortified citadel. He disembarked his fighting men and besieged the stronghold for several weeks. Meanwhile, Valdemar Atterdag, King of Denmark, assembled his fleet capable of carrying an army of 2,500 men and made a surprise attack on the Hanseatic Fleet.\nThe Danish were victorious, as most of Wittenborg's soldiers were in the town. The Hanseatic cities lost twelve of their ships and several of their nobles were captured.\nAftermath\nThe son of Valdemar IV, Christopher, Duke of Lolland was injured during the battle. German chronicles are not clear about what weapon inflicted the prince's mortal wound, but according to Swedish Henrik Smith's chronicle from the early 16th century, Christopher was hit by a rock while fighting at sea. According to Nordisk familjebok, Christopher was shot in the head with a rock and subsequently suffered from a mental disorder.\nOn his return to Lübeck, Wittenborg was tried and executed because of his poor performance in the war. The captured nobles were later ransomed. The war was brought to an end on 22 November 1365 by the peace treaty of Vordingborg.\nReferences\n*\n*"
