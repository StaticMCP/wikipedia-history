Several thousand Norwegians and foreign citizens were tried and convicted for crimes committed in Scandinavia during World War II. However, the scope, legal basis, and fairness of these trials has since been a matter of some debate. A total of 40 people—including Vidkun Quisling, the self-proclaimed and Nazi-supported Minister President of Norway during the occupation—were executed after capital punishment was reinstated in Norway. Thirty-seven of those executed were executed under Norwegian law, while the other three were executed under Allied military law.\nBackground\nThe German invasion of Norway during World War II created a number of constitutional issues, chiefly related to what was the legitimate Norwegian government, and whether the constitution and Norwegian code of law remained in effect during the occupation. Although the occupying power, under Reichskommissar Josef Terboven and the puppet Norwegian regime under Vidkun Quisling, claimed that the Norwegian government had abandoned its authority in the spring of 1940, the Norwegian government claimed that it had merely capitulated in the military struggle for the homeland, while the executive branch had been given special powers by the Storting (Norwegian parliament) through the Elverum Authorization. The Norwegian government's claim was upheld both by parliament and the Norwegian Supreme Court after the war, which in turn led to an extensive set of indictments and convictions against Norwegian citizens for treason, and German citizens for war crimes.\nAs early as 1941 and 1942, the Norwegian government-in-exile put into effect a number of decrees regarding treasonous acts. Capital punishment was reinstated as an option, prison sentences with hard labor were approved, higher upper limits for financial penalties introduced, and a controversial, new measure known as \"loss of public confidence\" () adopted, which would effectively deprive those convicted of various civil privileges. These decrees reached a final, workable form on 15 December 1944, the so-called . Crimes defined in these decrees notably included membership of Nasjonal Samling, the Norwegian fascist party that collaborated with the Nazis.\nCulpable acts during the occupation\nIn autumn 1940 the Nazi-supporting Norwegian fascist party, Nasjonal Samling, was declared as the only legal political organization in Norway.  Its claim to be the government was based on the premise that the pre-war leadership had abdicated its responsibilities by leaving Norway. As Nasjonal Samling had taken the responsible course by assuming the mantle of power, it was therefore the legal administration. However it never achieved any level of support justifying its claim to be the legitimate Norwegian government.\nThis was the view taken in London by Norway's government-in-exile. It saw the Nazi Party and its Third Reich to be the \"enemy of war\". Anything that aided or encouraged the German occupation of Norway was to be considered in principle an act of treason; this included membership of Nasjonal Samling. Norway's exiled government also considered it to be a criminal act to assist the Nazi regime through economic support and commercial activities.\nNorwegians who had volunteered for military service with the Wehrmacht or, especially, the Germanic-SS were subject to criminal prosecution after the war. Police officers who worked with the RSHA in the Statspolitiet (Norwegian Secret State Police) or joined the Gestapo faced charges relating to war crimes, torture, executions, and the mistreatment of prisoners.\nArrests, trials and executions\nIn May 1945, at the close of World War II, the paramilitary Milorg (Norway's official resistance movement in the war) joined units of the Norwegian police that had been trained in Sweden. Both had been well briefed and prepared ahead of the official liberation on 8 May 1945. The Norwegian government-in-exile assembled this force because it viewed the avoidance of lynching or other extrajudicial punishment of former members of the Nazi regime as being of paramount importance. Nevertheless, during the summer of 1945, there was a fierce debate reported in Norwegian newspapers about the prosecution and punishment of war criminals and traitors. Many spoke openly of retaliation, but others argued that death penalty was a \"drawback for a civilized community\". As tensions hardened, those fighting against the death penalty for humanitarian reasons were stigmatized as \"the silk front\". Those who favored harsh penalties were known as \"the ice front\". The editorial pages of Norwegian newspapers (Dagbladet being one of the most prominent) demanded harsh penalties.\nWithin just a few days of the war ending, up to 28,750 people were arrested for questioning. Although many were released quickly, between 5,000 and 6,000 individuals were still in custody in August 1946.\nFormer wartime resistance leader Sven Arntzen was made acting chief barrister of the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority. He was given the responsibility for bringing the cases to trial. Arntzen played a highly public role in establishing the principles that should drive the trials. This led to considerable public and internal debate about the nature of the legal purges.\nAltogether prosecutors requested death sentences in 200 cases of treason; of these only 30 were passed down, with 25 being carried out. All were executed by firing squad, except for Erich Hoffmann, who was hanged. From the beginning, the application of capital punishment was controversial in Norway, in part because the country's first government instituted capital punishment before the Norwegian parliament had reconvened after the war.\nPeople executed\nForty people were executed. Thirty-seven of them were executed under Norwegian law, and the other three under Allied military law. One man was hanged; the rest were shot.\nFor treason under Norwegian law\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| Reidar Haaland\n| 17 August 1945\n| Akershus Fortress, Oslo\n|Served in the Statspolitiet\n|-\n| Hans Birger Egeberg\n| 4 October 1945\n| Kristiansten Fortress, Trondheim\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Arne Braa Saatvedt\n| 20 October 1945\n| Akershus\n|Served in the Statspolitiet\n|-\n| Vidkun Quisling\n| 24 October 1945\n| Akershus\n|Coup leader, head of the pro-Nazi puppet government\n|-\n| Hans Jakob Skaar Pedersen\n| 30 March 1946\n| Sverresborg Fortress, Bergen\n|Served in the Statspolitiet\n|-\n| Albert Viljam Hagelin\n| 25 May 1946\n| Akershus\n|Interior minister\n|-\n| Alfred Josef Gärtner\n| 8 August 1946\n| Sverresborg\n|German-born translator for the Gestapo\n|-\n| Holger Tou\n| 30 January 1947\n| Sverresborg\n|Served in the Statspolitiet\n|-\n| Henry Rinnan\n| 1 February 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Leader of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Ole Wehus\n| 10 March 1947\n| Akershus\n|Served in the Statspolitiet\n|-\n| Eilif Rye Pisani\n| 2 April 1947\n| Kvarven Fortress, Bergen\n|Translator for the Gestapo\n|-\n| Einar Dønnum\n| 22 April 1947\n| Akershus\n|Served in the Statspolitiet\n|-\n| Johny Alf Larsen\n| 29 May 1947\n| Bremnes Fortress, Bodø\n|Translator for the Gestapo\n|-\n| Max Emil Gustav Rook\n| 5 June 1947\n| Sverresborg\n|German-born translator for the Gestapo\n|-\n| Per Fredrik Bergeen\n| 12 July 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Harald Grøtte\n| 12 July 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Olaus Salberg Peter Hamrun\n| 12 July 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Harry Arnfinn Hofstad\n| 12 July 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Bjarne Konrad Jenshus\n| 12 July 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Aksel Julius Mære\n| 12 July 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Kristian Johan Randal\n| 12 July 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Harry Aleksander Rønning\n| 12 July 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|Member of the Rinnan gang\n|-\n| Olav Aspheim\n| 19 March 1948\n| Akershus\n|Served in the Statspolitiet\n|-\n| Hermann Eduard Franz Dragass\n| 10 July 1948\n| Kristiansten\n|German-born translator for the Gestapo\n|-\n| Ragnar Skancke\n| 28 August 1948\n| Akershus\n|Minister for Church and Educational Affairs in Quisling's government; the last person to be executed in Norway\n|}\nFor war crimes under Norwegian law\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| Karl-Hans Hermann Klinge\n|28 March 1946\n| Akershus\n|\n|-\n| Ludwig Runzheimer\n|6 July 1946\n| Sverresborg\n|\n|-\n| Nils Peter Bernhard Hjelmberg\n|8 August 1946\n| Sverresborg\n|Danish national\n|-\n| Willi August Kesting\n|8 August 1946\n| Sverresborg\n|\n|-\n| Emil Hugo Friedrich Koeber\n|22 March 1947\n| Kristiansten\n|\n|-\n|August Stuckmann\n|28 March 1947\n| Akershus\n|\n|-\n| Richard Wilhelm Hermann Bruns\n|20 September 1947\n| Akershus\n|\n|-\n| Rudolf Theodor Adolf Schubert\n|20 September 1947\n| Akershus\n|\n|-\n|Otto Wilhelm Albert Suhr\n|10 January 1948\n| Akershus\n|\n|-\n| Gerhard Friedrich Ernst Flesch\n|28 February 1948\n| Kristiansten\n|\n|-\n| Siegfried Wolfgang Fehmer\n|16 March 1948\n| Akershus\n|\n|-\n|Julius Hans Christian Nielson\n|10 July 1948\n| Kristiansten\n|\n|}\nFor war crimes under Allied military law\nThe three men executed under Allied military law were convicted and sentenced after standing trial in Oslo.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| Hans Wilhelm Blomberg\n| 10 January 1946\n| Akershus\n|\n|-\n| Werner Seeling\n|10 January 1946\n| Akershus\n|\n|-\n| Erich Hoffmann\n| 15 May 1946\n|Hamelin Prison, Hamelin\n|Hoffmann was not shot in Norway, but instead hanged at Hamelin Prison in Germany\n|}\nLegacy\nThese were the last executions carried out in Norway.\nA great deal of sensitivity continues to surround this subject in Norwegian society.
