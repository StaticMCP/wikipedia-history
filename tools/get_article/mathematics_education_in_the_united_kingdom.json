However voluntary Mathematics education in the UK takes place from 16 to 18, in sixth forms and other forms of further education. Whilst adults can study the subject at universities and higher education more widely. Mathematics education is not taught uniformly as exams and the syllabus vary across the countries of the United Kingdom, notably Scotland.\nHistory\nThe School Certificate was established in 1918, for education up to 16, with the Higher School Certificate for education up to 18; these were both established by the Secondary Schools Examinations Council (SSEC), which had been established in 1917.\n1950s\nThe Association of Teachers of Mathematics was founded in 1950.\n1960s\nThe Joint Mathematical Council was formed in 1963 to improve the teaching of mathematics in UK schools. The Ministry of Education had been created in 1944, which became the Department of Education and Science in 1964. The Schools Council was formed in 1964, which regulated the syllabus of exams in the UK, and existed until 1984. The exam body Mathematics in Education and Industry in Trowbridge was formed in 1963, formed by the Mathematical Association; the first exam Additional Mathematics was first set in 1965. The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications was formed in 1964, and is the UK's chartered body for mathematicians, being based in Essex.\nBefore calculators, many calculations would be done by hand with slide rules and log tables.\nThe Nuffield Mathematics Teaching Project started in September 1964, lasting until 1971, to look at primary education, under Edith Biggs, from the Schools Inspectorate. The Nuffield Foundation Primary Mathematics Project began, with the 'Mathematics for the Majority Project', for the years up to 16, for slow learners.\n1970s\nDecimal Day, on 15 February 1971, allowed less time on numerical calculations at school. The Metric system has curtailed lengthy calculations as well; the US, conversely, largely does not have the metric system.\nAt Ruskin College on Monday 18 October 1976 Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan made a radical speech decrying the lack of numeracy in school leavers, possibly prompted by the William Tyndale affair in 1975. The Prime Minister also questioned why so many girls gave up science before leaving secondary school.\nBut the Labour Party, instead, took curriculum change slowly, merely setting up the Committee of Inquiry into the Teaching of Mathematics in Schools, under Sir Wilfred Cockcroft, with Hilary Shuard and Elizabeth Williams. The subsequent report Mathematics Counts, was published in 1982; it offered few radical changes.\nIn March 1977 the government had a £3.9m scheme to recruit 1,200 more teachers. In England and Wales, there was a shortfall of 1,120 Maths teachers, 424 in physical sciences, and 525 in Design and Technology. It would be paid for by the Training Services Agency, and run by the Local Government Training Board. The scheme was open to people over 28, who had not attended a higher education course in the last five years.\n1980s\nElectronic calculators began to be owned at school from the early 1980s, becoming widespread from the mid-1980s. Parents and teachers believed that calculators would diminish abilities of mental arithmetic. Scientific calculators came to the aid for those working out logarithms and trigonometric functions.\nThe BBC2 'Horizon' documentary Twice Five Plus the Wings of a Bird on Monday 28 April 1986, narrated by Peter Jones, looked at why people disliked abstract Maths, notably in the teenage years.\nThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) showed that in some topics, the UK apparently had adequate Mathematics teaching, and from such reports Sir Keith Joseph merely implemented feasibility studies of national attainment standards, but the next education secretary, Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking, wanted a lot more than mere feasibility studies. From hearing reports of national industrial failure being caused by insufficient mathematical abilities, he swiftly proposed a national curriculum in January 1987, to start in September 1988. Anita Straker and Hilary Shuard were part of the team that developed the primary national curriculum.\nSince 1988, exams in Mathematics at age sixteen, except Scotland, have been provided by the GCSE.\n1990s\nFrom the 1990s, mainly the late 1990s, computers became integrated into mathematics education at primary and secondary levels in the UK.\nOn Wednesday 18 November 1992 exam league tables were published for 108 local authorities, in England, under the Education Secretary John Patten, Baron Patten. The tables showed GCSE and A-levels for all 4,400 state secondary schools in England. Independent schools results were shown from 1993, and would include truancy rates. Left-wing parent groups, teachers' unions had opposed the move. Labour said it showed the government's simplistic approach to education standards, adding that raw results cannot reflect the real achievement of schools. The Liberal Democrats were not opposed, but thought that any information being provided was limited. Ofsted would be brought in the next year by Education Minister Emily Blatch, Baroness Blatch.\nThe specialist schools programme was introduced in the mid-1990s in England. Fifteen new City Technology Colleges (CTCs) from the early 1990s often focussed on Maths.\nIn 1996 the United Kingdom Mathematics Trust was formed to run the British Mathematical Olympiad, run by the British Mathematical Olympiad Subtrust. The United Kingdom Mathematics Trust summer school is held at The Queen's Foundation in Birmingham each year.\nThe National Numeracy Strategy, costing £60m, was devised by Anita Straker, for the government's Numeracy Task Force, for primary schools, for implementation in autumn 1999. Prof David Reynolds, of Newcastle University, was the chairman. He had appeared in a Panorama documentary on Maths education on 3 June 1996. The 60-page report in January 1998 recommended that children under the age of 8 should not have calculators.\nThe Millennium Mathematics Project was set up in 1999 at Cambridge by John D. Barrow, with 21 staff, with deputy director Julia Hawkins, now directed by Julia Gog.\n2000s\nMathematics and Computing Colleges were introduced in 2002 as part of the widened specialist schools programme; by 2007 there were 222 of these in England.\nThe Excellence in Cities report was launched in March 1999, which led to the Advanced Extension Award in 2002, replacing the S-level for the top 10% of A-level candidates. Since 2008, the AEA is only available for Maths, provided by Edexcel; the scheme was introduced when the A* grade was introduced; the scheme was provided until 2018.\nIn February 2004, the Smith Report, by the Principal of Queen Mary College, looked at how good exams were. People could pass at grade B at GCSE, but had taken much different type of exams. The report concluded that people could pass such exams, but lacked scant real-life proficiency at Maths.\nA-level Maths entries dropped from 67,000 in 2000 to 53,000 in 2004.\nThe IGCSE, a more rigorous exam, was introduced in 2004, but the Labour government banned state secondary schools from being allowed to set the exam. It was viewed as 'elitist'.\nIn a 2006 House of Lords report on science education, the Lib Dem chair Baroness Sharp, took an interest in the reduced participation in Maths in schools; she had worked with the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex. The 2001 report by the Lords Science and Technology Committee led to the National Science Learning Centre (Science Learning Centres) at National STEM Centre, with the University of York in 2006, with a Maths centre at University of Southampton.\nThe National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics was founded 2006, after the Smith Report, being now in Sheffield.\nThe National Higher Education Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (HE STEM) Programme was founded in August 2009 by HEFCE and HEFCW; the scheme had six regions across England and Wales, working with the universities of Bath, Birmingham, Bradford, Manchester Metropolitan, Southampton and Swansea; it was funded by £21m, and developed by the University of Birmingham STEM Education Centre; the scheme finished in July 2012. Also involved was the MSOR centre of the HEA (now Advance HE) Subject Centre, and the Centre for Excellence in University Wide Mathematics and Statistics Support at Loughborough University.\n2010s\nThe HEA subject centres closed in August 2011.\nIn September 2012 Prof Jeremy Hodgen, the chairman of the British Society for Research into Learning Mathematics, produced a report made by Durham University and KCL, where 7,000 children at secondary school took 1970s Maths exams. Maths exams results over the same time scale had doubled in grades, but the researchers did not find much improvement. Proficiency in routine Maths was better, but proficiency with difficult Maths was not as good.\nMathematics free schools were opened in 2014 - the King's College London Mathematics School in Lambeth, and Exeter Mathematics School in Devon; both were selective sixth form colleges; others opened at Liverpool and Lancaster; more selective sixth form maths schools are to open in Cambridge, Surrey, and Durham.\nA newer curriculum for Maths GCSE (and English) was introduced in September 2015, with a new grading scale of 1–9.\nIn August 2015 the ACME claimed that there was a shortfall of 5,500 secondary school Maths teachers, in England. But this shortfall was hugely uneven. Comprehensive schools in wealthy areas or state grammar schools were not commonly short of Maths teachers, but secondary schools in less-salubrious places were often hideously short of Maths teachers.\nNations\nEngland\nMathematics education in England up to the age of 19 is provided in the National Curriculum by the Department for Education, which was established in 2010.\nEarly years education is called the Early Years Foundation Stage in England, which includes arithmetic. In England there are 24,300 schools, of which 3,400 are secondary.\nThe National Curriculum for mathematics aims to ensure that all pupils:\n* become fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics, including through varied and frequent practice with increasingly complex problems over time, so that pupils develop conceptual understanding and the ability to recall and apply knowledge rapidly and accurately.\n* reason mathematically by following a line of enquiry, conjecturing relationships and generalisations, and developing an argument, justification or proof using mathematical language.\n* can solve problems by applying their mathematics to various routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of more straightforward steps and persevering in seeking solutions.\nMathematics is a related subject in which pupils must be able to move fluently between representations of mathematical ideas.  It is essential to everyday life, critical to science, technology and engineering, an appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematics, and a sense of and necessary for financial literacy and most forms of employment. A high-quality mathematics education, therefore, provides a foundation for understanding the world, the ability to reason mathematically, and curiosity about the subject. Pupils should build connections across mathematical ideas to develop fluency, mathematical reasoning and competence in solving increasingly sophisticated problems. They should also apply their mathematical knowledge in science, geography, computing and other subjects.\nWales\nWales takes the GCSE and A-level in Mathematics, but has its own Department for Education and Skills. Wales does not produce school league tables. Wales has 1550 schools, of which 180 are secondary.\nScotland\nEducation Scotland, formed in 2011, regulates education at school in Scotland, with qualifications monitored by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and the Mathematics syllabus follows the country's Curriculum for Excellence. Scotland does not produce school league tables. Scotland has 5,050 schools, of which 350 are secondary.\nNorthern Ireland\nNorthern Ireland is the only country in the UK to have exclusively selective schools - it has sixty nine grammar schools. Mathematics education is provided by the Department of Education (DENI), with further education provided by the Department for Employment and Learning. Northern Ireland has 1120 schools, of which 190 are secondary.\nRelation to other countries\nIn the 1980s the education researcher Sig Prais looked at mathematics education in Germany and the UK. He found that the teaching of mathematics of an appropriate level, in Germany, worked much better than to bludgeon all levels of mathematics onto all abilities in British comprehensive schools. In preparation for the new national curriculum in 1988, Sig Prais said 'There is an enormous burden on the teacher facing a mixed ability class. At age five, mixed ability classes are not such a problem. You can assume that nobody knows anything, but as the children process through the school, some will not have grasped all that they should, and they never catch up. In some countries, children are not allowed to move into the secondary schools until they are ready for it. They retake the lessons until they are.'\nPrimary level\nThe Department of Education and Science set up an Assessment of Performance Unit in 1976 to monitor attainment of children at a national level, with standards of mathematics being monitored from 1978 by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). Before this time, assessment of primary school standards had not been carried out at a national level.\nChildren at primary school are expected to know their times tables. Children are taught about long division, fractions, decimals, averages, ratios, negative numbers, and long multiplication.\nSecondary level\nStudy of Mathematics is compulsory up to the school leaving age. If you do not take Additional Mathematics at GCSE, in some schools, it is likely that you would not be allowed to subsequently take Maths A-level in the sixth form.\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds in mathematics and science above OECD averages. In 2011, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) rated 13–14-year-old pupils in England and Wales 10th in the world for maths and 9th for science.\nMathematics teachers\nQualifications vary by region; the\nEast Midlands and London have the most degree-qualified Maths teachers and North East England the least. For England about 40% mostly have a maths degree and around 20% have a BSc degree with QTS or a BEd degree. Around 20% have a PGCE, and around 10% have no higher qualification than A level Maths.\nFor schools without sixth forms, only around 30% of Maths teachers have a degree, but for schools with sixth forms and sixth form colleges around 50% have a Maths degree.\nThere are around 27,500 Maths teachers in England, of whom around 21,000 are Maths specialists; there are around 31,000 science teachers in England.\nSixth-form level\nYou will need at least grade 6 at GCSE to study Maths in the sixth form, and many sixth forms will only accept people with a grade 7 at GCSE.\nAt A-level, participation by gender is broadly mixed; about 60% of A-level entrants are male, and around 40% are female. Further Mathematics is an additional course available at A-level. A greater proportion of females take Further Maths (30%) than take Physics (15%), which at A-level is overwhelmingly a male subject.\nFrom the UPMAP project (Understanding Participation rates in post-16 Mathematics and Physics) of the ESRC Targeted Initiative on Science and Mathematics Education (TISME), in conjunction with the Institute of Physics, it was found that uptake of Maths A-level was linked to the grade at GCSE. From 2012 figures, 79% with A*, 48% of A, 15% of B and 1% of grade C chose Maths in the 6th form. For English, History and Geography, 30% with grade B, and 10% with grade C chose the course in the 6th form.\nThe House of Lords July 2012 report Higher Education in STEM Subjects recommended that everyone study some type of Maths after 16. For less-able sixth formers, there was the AS level titled 'Use of Mathematics'.\nProfessor Robert Coe, Director of the Centre for Evaluation and Monitoring (CEM) at Durham University conducted research on grade inflation. By 2007, 25% of Maths A-level grades were an A; he found that an A grade A-level would have been a grade B in 1996 and a grade C in 1988. The Labour government wanted to expand higher education, so required 'proof' that academic standards at A-level appeared to be rising, or at least not falling, so requiring higher education to expand for this wider apparent academic achievement.\nCore Maths\nPeople not taking Maths A-level can take the Core Mathematics Level  3 Certificate, developed by Mathematics in Education and Industry in Wiltshire.\nIt was introduced by education minister Liz Truss from September 2015; her father was a university Maths lecturer. From 2014 it had been trialled in 170 schools. It was hoped that 200,000 sixth formers could study the course for three hours per week, but would possibly require 1,000 extra Maths teachers. 20% of sixth formers studied some kind of Mathematics in 2015.\nThe Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education wanted the Core Maths introduction. In August 2016, there were 3,000 entries for the first Core Maths Level 3 exam. Consequently, the Conservative government was looking at making Maths education up to 18 compulsory.\nUniversity level\nAdmission to Mathematics at university in the UK will require three A-levels, often good A-levels. It is prevalently males who study Maths at university, and has been for decades.\nThere are around 42–43,000 Maths undergraduates at British universities, with around 27,000 being male and around 16–17,000 being female. Mathematics at university is also taught for other physical sciences and Engineering, but much fewer women than men are taught on these types of courses.\nBroadcasting\nTelevision\nEducational series on television have included\n* Mathematics and Life, BBC TV 18 September 1961 on Mondays at 11am, repeated on Fridays at 2pm, presented by Hugh David, produced by Donald Grattan\n* Pure Mathematics, BBC TV 17 September 1962 on Mondays and Wednesdays at 10am, repeated on Wednesday and Fridays at 9.30am, for the fifth form and sixth-form, presented by Norman Hyland, produced by Donald Grattan; repeated in September 1963\n* Pure Mathematics Year II, BBC TV 16 September 1963 on Mondays and Wednesdays at 10am, for the age of 14, presented by Alan Tammadge (9 July 1921 - 25 February 2016, educated at Dulwich College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge); the series was the first of its kind on the BBC, to teach in such a formal way, known as 'chalk and talk'; the series was developed in response to an increasing lack of teachers for the sixth-form; in 1965, 38-year old Donald Grattan, a former grammar school Maths teacher, set up a new further education department at the BBC, with twenty producers; a new 'University of the Air' was being planned by Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge; in March 1968 through BBC Education, under Mr Grattan, this proposal turned largely into adult education courses, and from 1974 towards adult illiteracy; in July 1971 44-year-old Mr Grattan took over as Controller of Educational Broadcasting at the BBC, staying until July 1984; he died aged 93 on 21 August 2019.\n* Middle School Mathematics, BBC TV 16 September 1963 on Mondays at 3pm, a 28-part series presented by Dikran Tahta, Alan Tammadge, the President of the Mathematical Association in 1978, David Morris, Stewart Gartside, Gerald Leach (4 January 1933 - 10 January 2004, the husband of child psychologist Penelope Leach), and Maurice Meredith, produced by Donald Grattan, and John Cain; repeated in September 1964, September 1965, September 1966.\n* Modern Mathematics, BBC1 April 27 1964 on Mondays, repeated on Wednesdays at 9.30am, a 16-part series for 6th forms, for newer parts of the A-level Maths syllabus, directed by Edward Goldwyn and Norman Hyland, presented by J E Reeve, Tom Jones, Douglas Quadling and Geoffrey Matthews.
