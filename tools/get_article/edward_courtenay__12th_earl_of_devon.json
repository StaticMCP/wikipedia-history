He was first educated at Westminster School, before attending Christ Church, Oxford.\nPolitical career\nDevon represented the Conservative Party as Member of Parliament for Exeter from 1864 to 1868 and for Devon East for two years from 1868 to 1870 before resigning. John Kennaway replaced him at his second constituency. Devon was known for his advocacy of women's rights, and joined the Albemarle Club, a members club open to both men and women. In 1888 he succeeded his father in the earldom and entered the House of Lords, following that he became a governor of the London Charterhouse and a Deputy Lieutenant for Devonshire.\nDeath\nLord Devon died unmarried in January 1891, aged 54. He was walking through Trafalgar Square and staggered to call a cab back to his residence. He passed unconscious and died after he arrived, with Devon being considered to have suffered from apoplexy. The funeral took place on 21 January, with the body encased within three coffins, with one made of elm, one of lead and one of oak. The exterior coffin was adorned with brass fittings and a plaque describing Lord Devon. He was succeeded in the earldom by his uncle, Hugh Courtenay. His remains were interred at the church near to Powderham Castle, alongside those of his ancestors.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
