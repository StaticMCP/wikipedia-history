He is particularly noted for his summons to the bar of the House of Commons in 2021, a rare parliamentary procedure.\nEarly career\nStewart began his career in the Canadian public service in the early 2000s, working across various departments, including Industry Canada, where he gained experience in economic and regulatory policy. Over time, Stewart became known for his leadership, focusing on innovation, science, and technology.\nBefore his appointment at PHAC, Stewart served as the president of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), where he oversaw scientific research and development initiatives. His role at NRC involved promoting innovation and responding to emerging national challenges.\nPublic Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)\nIn September 2020, Stewart was appointed President of PHAC, succeeding Tina Namiesniowski. This appointment came at a critical time as Canada was grappling with the complexities of managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Stewart’s leadership at PHAC involved overseeing vaccine procurement, distribution strategies, and coordinating public health measures across Canada in cooperation with federal, provincial, and territorial governments.\nDespite these efforts, the Auditor General of Canada noted that PHAC was unprepared for the pandemic.\nCall to the bar of Parliament\nIn June 2021, Stewart was summoned to appear before the House of Commons in a rare parliamentary procedure known as being \"called to the bar of Parliament.\" This marked the first time since 1913  that a public servant had been summoned in this manner. The summons occurred after PHAC, under Stewart’s leadership, defied Parliament and declined to release unredacted documents related to the firing of two scientists from the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, citing national security concerns.\nStewart complied with the summons and appeared before the bar on June 21, 2021, where he stood silently and received a formal reprimand from the speaker of the House, Anthony Rota.\nReturn to the National Research Council\nIn October 2021, Stewart stepped down from his role as President of PHAC and returned to his previous position as President of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). His time at PHAC was marked by both praise for his efforts during a challenging period and scrutiny over the decisions related to the disclosure of sensitive information.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/biography-iain-stewart.html Biography of Iain Stewart] at the Government of Canada website"
