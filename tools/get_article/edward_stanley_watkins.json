In the 1880s he lived at 22 Margaretta Terrace in Chelsea, but by 1909 he had moved to 39 Ranelagh Road in Ealing. In his lifetime, he was best known in the North of England, the Midlands and in London, but his work can also be found in the South of England. He is perhaps best known for his Oldham Parish Church reredos depicting Christ triumphant. Watkins worked in a broad range of artforms for churches, including stained glass, painted panels for reredoses and triptychs, marble and venetian mosaics, and memorial brasses.\nWork\n* St James the Less Church, Dorney, Buckinghamshire, Stained glass (1920).
