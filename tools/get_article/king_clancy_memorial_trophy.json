The winner is chosen by \"a special panel of representatives\" from the Professional Hockey Writers' Association and the NHL Broadcasters' Association.\nThe trophy is named in honour of Francis M. \"King\" Clancy, a former player for the original Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Maple Leafs who later went on to become a coach, referee, and team executive. The trophy was first awarded in 1988 and was presented to the NHL by Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard, who called Clancy \"one of the greatest humanitarians that ever lived\". It honours similar community service as the Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award, which was retired in 1984.\nFive teams have had more than one player win the award. Three members of the Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, New York Islanders, and Boston Bruins have won the award, while two members of the Minnesota Wild, and Detroit Red Wings have also won the award. Ray Bourque and Dave Poulin won it in consecutive years for the Boston Bruins, and Jason Zucker and Matt Dumba won it in consecutive years for the Minnesota Wild. Players from the seven different Canadian teams have won the trophy on 10 of the 28 occasions that it has been awarded. Three members each from the Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, and Vancouver Canucks, as well as one each from the Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, and the original Winnipeg Jets have won the award. Henrik Sedin is the only player who has won it more than once. Henrik and his brother Daniel are the only recipients to have won the trophy jointly.\nThe 2024–25 winner is Aleksander Barkov, captain of the Florida Panthers. He was awarded for his partnership with the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, and donations for every goal and every assist. To date, Barkov has donated $420,000 to the hospital.\nThe similar NHL Foundation Player Award was discontinued for the 2017–18 NHL season, with its associated charitable donation being redirected towards the King Clancy Memorial Trophy instead.\nWinners\n, inaugural winner]]\n(top) and Daniel Sedin, 2018 winners. Henrik also won in 2016, making him the only player to win the trophy more than once.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#CFECEC; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| ^\n|Denotes player who is still active in the NHL\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| *\n|Denotes player inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#CCFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"| ~\n|Denotes inactive player not yet eligible for Hockey Hall of Fame consideration\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player had won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy at that time\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Season\n!scope=\"col\"| Winner\n!scope=\"col\"| Team\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Player's humanitarian contribution\n|-\n|\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99\"|*\n|Calgary Flames\n|Supporter of numerous charities in Toronto and Calgary.\n|-\n|\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99\"|*\n|New York Islanders\n|Worked with numerous charities, including the Special Olympics, the Long Island \"Just Say No to Drugs\" program, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n|-\n|\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99\"|*\n|Edmonton Oilers\n|Although very busy as a player and with the NHLPA, he was made the honorary Chairman of the Edmonton City Christmas Bureau, a charity which fed needy persons.\n|-\n|\n|\n| Los Angeles Kings\n|Did a lot of charity work with his team, and also assisted persons with speech impediments, as he had previously overcome one.\n|-\n|\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFF99\"|*\n| Boston Bruins\n|Involved in numerous charities; he was most notably the honourable chairman for Boston's Floating Hospital for Infants and Children.\n|-\n|\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n|Spent a lot of time helping charities; he was co-chairman of the March of Dimes \"Walk for Life\" fundraiser.\n|-\n|\n|\n|New York Rangers\n|Was previously recognized by his team and city for his extensive community work.
