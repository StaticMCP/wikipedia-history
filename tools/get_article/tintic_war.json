It was named after a subchief of the Ute and involved several clashes between  Mormon settlers and  Native Americans previously residing in the Tintic and Cedar Valleys.\nConflict\nInitially, the settlers and Indians got along well. However, the war started out as small skirmishes between the two communities, with the first battle occurring at Battle Creek.\nThe conflict began when Native Americans took settlers' cattle due to drought.\nThe local Indians' desperation occurred because they had been displaced from their land by the settlers. During the winter the Indians did not have the necessary resources to survive, and began to starve. The European Americans settled the area, and proceeded to establish mining communities. They depleted the land of timber, game, diverted the water, and most of the land's resources in general.\nThe settlers established successful livestock and agriculture endeavors on the land. The Indians were forced to steal from the settlers in order to survive. Brigham Young was among the settlers, and he recounts the early troubles by stating, \"They came pretty nigh starving to death last winter; and they now see, if they are driven from these valleys in winter, they must perish\".\nOutcome\nThe war concluded with the federal government intervening by taking the Utes from their land to the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. This occurred in the late 1860s and in the Uinta Basin. However, the issues did not resolve quickly. The government never legally bought the Ute lands, causing issues that persisted after World War II, when the Indian Claims Commission demanded money for their confiscated lands.\nReferences"
