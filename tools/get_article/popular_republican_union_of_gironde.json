The UPR was affiliated with the Republican Federation, the largest conservative French party of the interwar period.Le Temps, 30 January 1928, p. 4.\nThe party was founded in 1925,Journal Officiel, 6 March 1925, p. 2348. six years after the birth of the Alsatian Popular Republican Union. Both organizations shared clerical and conservative stances, and opposed the Cartel des Gauches which had won the 1924 legislative election.Le Temps, 4 January 1926, p. 2.\nChaired by Father Bergey, priest of Saint-Émilion and member of Parliament, and supported by Cardinal Pierre Andrieu,''L'Ouest-Éclair, 10 January 1928, p. 2. the UPR displayed a program reflecting the concerns of the Catholic right, in the continuity of the Fédération Nationale Catholique. The party defended private education against the laïque \"single school\" project and endorsed the right to vote for women, at that time considered more clerical than men.L'Ouest-Éclair, 1 April 1930, p. 2.\nThe party had 7,200 supporters in the eve of the 1928 legislative election.La Croix, 18 April 1928, p. 1-2.
