It services the surrounding coal mining and rural activities. It is situated approximately  west of Biloela on the Dawson Highway,  west of the port city of Gladstone, and  south west of Rockhampton. In the , the locality of Moura had a population of 1,993 people.\nEconomy\nA number of industries are represented in the local economy. Chief amongst these is coal mining. The name of the local coal mine changes each time it is sold, currently Dawson coal mine, owned and operated by AngloAmerical Coal. Only open-cut mining has been used since 1994. Beef, cotton and cereals are other major industries of the area.\nHistory\nIn 1854 Charles Marshall named his leased pastoral selection Moura. There are two theories regarding the origin of the name. One is that it is named after Moura in Portugal where he served in the British Army during the Peninsular Wars. The other is that it is an Aboriginal word meaning native camp dog.\nThe Moura property was developed into a homestead in 1880 by Edward Homer.\nThe town was first established in 1936 as a farming centre near the existing Moura Station.\nThe Moura Post Office opened in late 1939.\nMoura Provisional School was opened on 10 September 1940. It became Moura State School on 1 January 1948. In 1965 a secondary department was attached to the school. By 1975, there were sufficient secondary students to warrant a formal high school and so Moura State High School was opened on 25 January 1976 with 263 pupils.\nMining disasters\nThere have been three mining disasters that have occurred near Moura:\n*The first was the Kianga mining disaster occurring due to an explosion in the underground workings of the Kianga No. 1 mine on 20 September 1975, claiming 13 miners' lives. On 11 March 1978, a memorial centre was officially opened in Moura to commemorate the disaster.\n*The second, on 16 July 1986, was an explosion in the Moura No. 4 underground mine, claiming twelve miners' lives, the youngest miner being 18.\n*The third was an explosion in the Moura No. 2 underground coal mine on 7 August 1994. Rescue and recovery attempts were abandoned after a second, more violent explosion occurred 18 hours later. Eleven miners' lives had been lost and the mine was sealed at the surface.\nAfter 1994, underground mining ceased and the area was operated as an open-cut coal mine.\nIn November 2017, a routine blast in the mine resulted in ground movement leading to a \"circular geotechnical failure\" that resulted in a crack through a public access road across the open pit. The road had been a key access and freight route for farmers and graziers to reach the town of Moura, including a school bus route. The road remained closed in February 2018 and was expected to remain unstable indefinitely. The company had conducted improvements to a southern detour route, and consulted with the community about a viable long-term alternative. A new route was proposed which would cross the pit further north, but was expected to take 15 months to complete construction.\nDemographics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Population !!
