It was fought on  the 23 July 1798 on Carrigmoclear a low hill attached to the mountain of Slievenamon 3 km north-west of the village of Grangemockler in County Tipperary near the border with County Kilkenny.\nThe battle\nIn July 1798 insurgents from the Tipperary/Kilkenny border attempted to raise forces around the mountain of Slievenamon. Largely rural recruits from in and around the nearby villages of Grangemockler, Mullinahone, Windgap, Killamery and Callan assembled at Carrigmoclear. The lighting of a fire on the hill was supposed to signal the start of the rebellion in Tipperary. However, the rebels were betrayed by a local named Maher or O'Neill from Ninemilehouse who heard of their plans and informed William Despard, head of the local yeomanry militia about them. Despard lit a fire on the hill to create a false signal and lure the rebels into an ambush. When the rebel leadership found out, they hurried to inform their men that they were running into an enemy trap, but it was too late as almost 600 walked right into Despard hands. Awaiting them was a large loyalist force, of which the deceived men initially managed to fight off, inflicting numerous casualties upon the British, but eventually as the battle went on the rebel force was overwhelmed and in the end they were easily defeated. What remained of the rebels fled higher up the mountain. For days afterwards, British forces searched the mountainside looking for them. Those caught were hanged, flogged, or forcefully transported away for life. The defeat at Carrigmoclear halted the rebellions progression into Tipperary with the county seeing no more action in 1798. The rebels who died in the fighting were buried in Killamery, County Kilkenny.\nReferences"
