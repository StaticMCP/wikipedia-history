The series starred Leslie Phillips as a university lecturer and three episodes were co-written by Tim Brooke-Taylor. The entire series was wiped and is no longer thought to exist.\nBackground\nThe Culture Vultures was originally going to be piloted in Comedy Playhouse, but it was decided it was good enough to go straight to a series. After the second episode, the lead Leslie Phillips collapsed with an internal haemorrhage. He recovered enough to return to the series. His next sitcom lead would be ''Casanova '73''.\nCast\n*Leslie Phillips - Dr Michael Cunningham\n*Jonathan Cecil - Dr Ian Meredith\n*Peter Sallis - Professor George Hobbes\n*Sally Faulkner - Vivienne\nPlot\nDr Michael Cunningham is a senior lecturer in anthropology at the University of Hampshire.

He enjoys the campus nightlife and is always looking for an opportunity to travel.\nEpisodes\nThe series aired on Fridays at 7:55pm. In line with the BBC's archival policy of the time, all five episodes were wiped and none are thought to survive.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! width=\"20\"| # !!
