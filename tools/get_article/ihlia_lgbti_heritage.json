IHLIA curates the largest LGBTI collection of Europe with over 100,000 titles on 1515 meters of shelf length – books, journals and magazines, films, documentaries, posters, photographs and objects such as T-shirts, buttons and condom packaging.\nHistory\nIHLIA was founded in 1999 by merging the Homodok (documentation on homosexuality of the University of Amsterdam), the Lesbian Archives of Leeuwarden hosted at the Anna Blamanhuis, and Lesbisch Archief Amsterdam (LAA). Since 2007, IHLIA has been located in the Public Library Amsterdam. IHLIA and the George Mosse Fund organize the annual Mosse Lectures. Over 95% of their annual budget, about 800,000 euros, comes from the national government.\nIHLIA has part-time staff and volunteers who help in their work. They provide access to archival materials on request, for instance to students of Gender Studies at the University of Amsterdam.\nFile:IHLIA depot.jpg|alt=Boxes of magazines in long rows of wooden racks.
