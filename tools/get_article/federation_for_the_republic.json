It was founded in November 2018, and registered on 12 March 2020.\nHistory\nOn 2 November 2018 Marek Jakubiak, poseł for the 8th Sejm, declared he will exit the Kukiz’15 parliamentary group, and his desire to found a federative right-wing organization. 13 days later he announced the creation of the Federation for the Republic.\nDespite initially trying to form a coalition with the Right Wing of the Republic, on 6 March, FdR joined the Confederation, which was then created for the 2019 European Parliament election. 16 days later, Jakubiak cofounded the Confederation parliamentary circle.\nThe Federation of the Republic hosted Marek Jakubiak as its candidate for the 2020 presidential election, with Marek Jakubiak gaining 33,652 votes (0.17%). In the second round, it endorsed incumbent President Andrzej Duda.\nIn May 2023, Jakubiak returned to Kukiz'15 as its general secretary.\nIn the 2023 parliamentary election, Marek Jakubiak was elected to the Sejm as a member Kukiz'15 from the lists of Law and Justice.\nIn the 2025 presidential election, Marek Jakubiak again ran for President, improving his result, and earning 150,698 votes (0.77%). In the second round, he endorsed Karol Nawrocki.\nIdeology\nFdR refers to Roman Dmowski. In the party's statue, it refers to itself as republican. The primary postulates of FdR are:\n* introduction of a presidential system,\n* introduction of single-seat constituencies in the Sejm,\n* introduction of elements of direct democracy,\n* introduction of \"citizens' retirement\",\n* increase of income tax threshold,\n* return of justice of the peace,\n* shortening the duration of economic matters,\n* liquidation of some offices,\n* moving some ministerial offices outside of Warsaw,\n* obligation of the removal of two laws to introduce one.\nIn 2019 FdR published a detailed program, \"Patriotism and freedom\" ().\nElection results\nPresidential\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" |1st round\n! colspan=\"2\" |2nd round\n|-\n! # of overall votes\n! % of overall vote\n! # of overall votes\n! % of overall vote\n|-\n! 2020\n| Marek Jakubiak\n| 33,652\n| 0.17%\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightgrey;\" |\n|-\n! 2025\n| Marek Jakubiak\n| 150,698\n| 0.77%\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:lightgrey;\" |\n|}\nReferences"
