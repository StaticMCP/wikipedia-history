      "text": "# Manitoba Book Awards\n\nManitoba Books Awards/Les Prix du livre du Manitoba was the premiere annual book awards for Manitoba, Canada from 1988 to 2023. Originating in 1988, an award gala was usually held in April in Winnipeg, Manitoba, celebrating the best of Manitoba writing and publishing from the previous year.\nDepending on the year, there were several awards conferred, as some of the awards were only bestowed biannually. The awards were co-produced by the Association of Manitoba Book Publishers and the Manitoba Writers' Guild. Awards include the Eileen McTavish Sykes Award for Best First Book, the Margaret Laurence Award for Fiction, the Carol Shields Award for best Winnipeg book, the Mary Scorer Award for Best Book by a Manitoba Publisher, the Alexander Kennedy Isbister Award for Non-Fiction, the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award and others. Past winners include Miriam Toews, David Bergen, Joan Thomas, W.P. Kinsella, Carol Shields and others.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Manitoba Book Awards winners\n!Year\n!Award\n!Author\n!Title\n!Ref.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"13\" |2007\n|Alexander Kennedy Isbister Award for Non-Fiction\n|\n|A Great Restlessness: the Life and Politics of Dorise Nielsen\n| rowspan=\"13\" |\n|-\n|Aqua Books Lansdowne Prize for Poetry\n|\n|Time out of Mind\n|-\n|Best Illustrated Book of the Year\n|\n|Early Masters: Inuit Sculpture 1949-1955\n|-\n|Carol Shields Winnipeg Book Award\n|\n|Winnipeg Modern: Architecture 1945 to 1975\n|-\n|Eileen McTavish Sykes Award for Best First Book\n|\n|A Great Restlessness: the Life and Politics of Dorise Nielsen\n|-\n|John Hirsch Most Promising Writer Award\n|\n|\n|-\n|le Prix littéraire Rue-Deschambault\n|\n|Manguiers têtus\n|-\n|Manuela Dias Award for Book Design\n|\n|Going Downtown: A History of Portage Avenue\n|-\n|Margaret Laurence Award for Fiction\n|\n|Beautiful Girl Thumb\n|-\n|Mary Scorer Award for Best Book by a Manitoba Publisher\n|\n|A Great Restlessness: the Life and Politics of Dorise Nielsen\n|-\n|McNally Robinson Book for Young People Award - Older\n|\n|Lost Treasures: True Stories of Discovery\n|-\n|McNally Robinson Book for Young People Award - Younger\n|\n|Raise a Little Stink\n|-\n|McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award\n|\n|A Great Restlessness: the Life and Politics of Dorise Nielsen\n|-\n! rowspan=\"11\" |2008\n|Alexander Kennedy Isbister Award for Non-Fiction\n|\n|''Canada's Wheat King: The Life and Times of Seager Wheeler\n|\n|-\n|Aqua Books Lansdowne Prize for Poetry\n|\n|Wolf Tree\n|\n|-\n|Best Illustrated Book of the Year\n| (design) and Ernest Mayer (photography)\n|Take Comfort: the Career of Charles Comfort\n|\n|-\n|Carol Shields Winnipeg Book Award\n|\n|A Glowing Dream: A Memoir\n|\n|-\n|Eileen McTavish Sykes Award for Best First Book\n|\n|Wolf Tree\n|\n|-\n|John Hirsch Most Promising Writer Award\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Manuela Dias Award for Book Design\n| (design) and Ernest Mayer (photography)\n|Take Comfort: the Career of Charles Comfort\n|\n|-\n|Margaret Laurence Award for Fiction\n|\n|The Penance Drummer and Other Stories\n|\n|-\n|Mary Scorer Award for Best Book by a Manitoba Publisher\n|\n|The North End: Photographs by John Paskievich\n|\n|-\n|McNally Robinson Book for Young People Award - Older\n|\n|Sandbag Shuffle\n|\n|-\n|McNally Robinson Book of the Year\n|\n|Be Wolf\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"13\" |2009\n|Alexander Kennedy Isbister Award for Non-Fiction\n|\n|Lord Selkirk: A Life\n|\n|-\n|Aqua Books Lansdowne Prize for Poetry\n|\n|this is a small northern town\n|\n|-\n|Best Illustrated Book of the Year\n| and Frank Reimer\n|The Harry Winrob Collection of Inuit Sculpture\n|\n|-\n|Carol Shields Winnipeg Book Award\n| Carol J.
