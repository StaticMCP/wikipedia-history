Each torch represents one Latin word of the school's motto: Vires, embodying moral, physical and intellectual strength; Artes, expressing an appreciation of aesthetics and the beauty of intellectual pursuits; and Mores, exhibiting respect for customs, character and tradition.\nHistory\nThe actual name of the award is Faculty Senate Torch Awards, established in 1996 as a means for the faculty to honor the friends of FSU who have made sustained and significant contributions to the university's ability to fulfill its academic mission. Initially, the Faculty Senate presented the awards at the Annual Faculty Awards Ceremony held at the end of the school year. A few years later, the event was moved to the Fall as part of the Fall Faculty Meeting. In 2012, the university administration suggested raising the prestige of the award by funding a special awards dinner including the Provost.\nCommittee\nCommittee membership consists of no more than 10, but at least 7 members, including Ex officio members. The President of the Faculty Senate appoints committee members. Appointees must be a combination of retired and active faculty. One or more members must be on the Faculty Senate Steering Committee (FSSC). The President of the FSU Foundation or their representative is Ex officio but has voting rights. Committee members serve a term of three years except for the FSSC member. Committee members may make recommendations to fill vacancies and recommend a chairperson for the Torch Awards Committee to the FSSC.\nThe committee accepts nominations and recommends recipients for the awards to the FSSC, which has final approval. The letter of nomination should document the nominee's contributions and accomplishments that support the university's ability to effectuate its academic mission. There need not be recipients for all categories of the award, but there may be multiple recipients for any or all categories in a given year. Current university employees are not eligible for a Torch Award.\nIn addition, the Torch Awards committee is responsible for recommending possible candidates for the Fred L. Standley Distinguished Service Professor award which is given for extraordinary service to Florida State University by a faculty member.  It is only given occasionally (not yearly) for exceptional candidates. As of 2025, it has been awarded five times.\nTorch Award recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Vires awards\n!
