He polled 1.08 per cent of the vote.\nAfter the 1985 elections, the Macabeo Chila Prieto's MRTK disappeared.\nIn 1985 Jenaro Flores Santos registered the Revolutionary Liberation Movement Túpac Katari (Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Katari de Liberacion, MRTKL).\nIt took part in 1985 elections, running Jenaro Flores Santos. He polled 2.11 per cent of the vote.\nWithin a year of its formation, divisions emerged within the MRTKL between Jenaro Flores Santos, on the one hand, and Víctor Hugo Cárdenas and Walter Reynaga Vásquez, the party's two deputies of the National Congress, on the other. In a 1988 party congress, Jenaro Flores Santos walked out with some of his supporters and formed the Katarist United Liberation Front (FULKA). Both parties lost support after the internal bickering became public. Jenaro Flores Santos's exit still did not achieve unity in the MRTKL: neither Víctor Hugo Cárdenas nor Walter Reynaga Vásquez would accept the second position in the new party hierarchy. Víctor Hugo Cárdenas eventually edged out his rival.\nThe MRTKL took part in 1989 elections, running Víctor Hugo Cárdenas. He polled 1.6 per cent of the vote.\nAlthough the indigenous candidates attracted large crowds, they found that many campesinos already were committed to the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement, the Revolutionary Left Movement, or other parties that had a better chance of winning.\nReferences"
