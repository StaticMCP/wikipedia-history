Situated on 15 acres, the cemeteries include an estimated 5,000 graves and represent at least 24 different nationalities.\nHistory\nShortly after coal was discovered in the nearby area, Roslyn, Washington was founded in 1886 by Logan M. Bullet, the Vice President of the Northern Pacific Coal Company. Many immigrants moved to the town seeking employment in the mines, and by 1890, the town had grown to a population of 1,481 residents. As the town's population grew, many local clubs were founded, in which upon membership was dependent on monthly fees and the applicant's ethnic background, religious beliefs, or cultural customs. These clubs were popular, as they offered their members a way to connect to the communities they had left behind in their native countries, while also making them active participants in their new community. Additionally, in many of the groups, a percentage of the monthly dues provided members with other perks, such as health insurance, disability, and death benefits, which the mining company did not.\nBeginning in 1887, the mining company began to either donate or sell land for the cemeteries to these local groups for their members to use. Most of the cemetery sections are privately owned by the groups they represent, although many of the clubs don't actually have deeds or any other paperwork that proves ownership, due to fires, mishandled records, or simply the passage of time. Additionally, some of the groups are no longer active in the area. The city of Roslyn owns Old City Cemetery, New City Cemetery, and the Memorial Gardens. In 1978, the cemeteries were entered into the National Register of Historic Places. In 1999, a city ordinance established the Cemetery Commission, which works as an advisory board to the City Council and Mayor about matters concerning the care and keeping of the city-owned cemeteries and the cemeteries which don't have active clubs. The commission is composed of seven appointees, who serve five-year terms. The main responsibilities of the commission include working on historical preservation of the cemeteries and handling any secretarial tasks concerning renovations or maintenance efforts. In February 2017, the Cemetery Commission was briefly disbanded by the City Council after it was discovered that members of the commission also worked with other groups who managed preservation efforts, the Roslyn Cemetery Beneficiary Committee and the Roslyn-Ronald-Cle Elum Heritage Club. This caused concern about potential conflicts of interest. After much public support, the commission was brought back a few months later in August 2017. In 2018, work began on a kiosk database, where visitor's can learn about the individual cemeteries and find specific grave sites. The development of the kiosk finished in 2021, with the grand-opening taking place over Memorial Day weekend.\nCemetery Sections\nCacciatori D'Africa\nDirectly translated from Italian, meaning \"Hunter of Africa\", Cacciatori D'Africa was an Italian hunting lodge formed on April 28, 1890.

Cemeteries at the time were still segregated, so Mt. Olivet was founded for the local black community.\nNational Croatian Society\nThis cemetery was founded in Roslyn in the early 1900s by local members of the National Croatian Society, who had formed their own social club in the nearby town of Ronald, WA.

They were also known for being supporters of the 18th Amendment, which prohibited the sale and consumption of alcohol during the 1920s and early 30's. As such, no bartenders or other bar workers were allowed to be buried in their cemetery. In addition to burial benefits, the club also provided members with sickness and accident insurance.
