Today, it undertakes voluntary work in 16 locations across Pune.\nThe organization was founded after Kishabhau retired from government service in 1979. Initially, it did not have a name, but after much deliberation with his colleagues, the organization formally began its work under the name 'Swa'-Roopwardhinee.\nThe primary aim of the organization was to identify and nurture the hidden talents of intelligent students from underprivileged and economically weaker sections of society by providing them with opportunities and support. The initiative began with just a few students in a factory shed in the Mangalwar Peth area of Pune. Over time, the work expanded into various educational and social initiatives, and today, the organization has branches at 16 different locations across Pune.\nNature of the Organization\n'Swa'-Roopwardhinee operates as an after-school initiative focusing on instilling core values necessary for shaping responsible and well-rounded citizens. The organization runs its programs outside regular school hours, targeting areas that formal education may not fully address.\nThe organizations activities include pre-primary (Balwadi) classes for children from economically weaker sections, daily classes and study centers for school-going children in slum areas, competitive exam coaching centers, and self-help groups and training centers for women, among others.\nThe overarching goal of the organization is to enhance the social, cultural, educational, physical, and economic standards of Indian citizens through sustained efforts and grassroots programs.\nFounder\nThe founder of 'Swa'-Roopwardhinee, the late Kishabhau Patwardhan, was a retired headmaster and a dedicated social worker. He is known for his innovative approach in the field of education and his strong commitment to the holistic development of students.\nKishabhau Patwardhan was deeply influenced by the teachings of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the thoughts of Dr. K. B. Hedgewar, and the philosophy of Dadarav Paramarth. Inspired by these great thinkers, he dedicated his life to the service of society and the nation, making this mission the guiding principle of his life's work.\nMotto of the Organization\nI do not seek credit for the work of this organization. I do not want to claim acknowledgement for its beauty and sweet fragrance. Let us devote ourselves to the cause of development like we dedicate sacred offerings to God. Let us become one with this devotion. This is the motto of this organization.\nDevelopment of the Organization\nBranches of the Organization\nActivities of the Organization\nPublications of the Organization\nAwards\nMore information\nRefer to the website of the organization:\nReferences and Notes"
