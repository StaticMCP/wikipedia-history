President Lee Gyu (李圭).\nIn addition to the above ten units, the Korean New People's Association dispatched Kim Seong-bae as a representative of the Korean New People's Association to Milsan in December to form the Korean Independence Corps, but there was no result.\nOrganization\nSeo Il (徐一) as president, Hong Beom-do (洪範圖) as vice president, Baek Soon (白純 and Kim Ho-ik) as advisors, Choi Jin-dong (崔振東) as foreign minister, Kim Jwa-jin (金佐鎭) as chief of staff, staff Lee Jang-nyeong and Na Joong-so as military advisers, Ji Cheong-cheon as a military advisor, Kim Gyu-sik as the 1st Brigade Commander, Park Yeong-hee as the Staff, Anmu as the 2nd Brigade Commander, and Staff Lee Dan-seung (李檀承), 2nd Brigade Cavalry Commander Kang Phillip, company commanders Kim Chang-hwan, Oh Gwang-seon (吳光鮮), and Jo Dong-shik (趙東植) were appointed.\nThere was a brigade as an upper unit under the corps, and under it, three battalions, nine companies, and 27 platoons were organized, and the total strength was about 3,500.\nParadoxically, the Korean Independence Corps became more desperate for support, including armament, clothing, and provisions, to maintain a large army.\nMarch to the Free City\nIn December of that year, They crossed the Heilong River and were stationed in the Russian Free City Srabske area. With the help of 500,000 Koreans and the Russian Red Army, they received weapons replenishment and sometimes participated in joint operations. Meanwhile, in February 1921, a military agreement was signed between the buffer government in Chita and the anti-Japanese independence army through the good offices of Ohamuk, a graduate of the Russian Military Academy who participated in the Russian Revolution. According to this military agreement, the independence army received weapons from them, established the Goryeo Revolutionary Military Academy (高麗革命軍官學校) to train the independence army, and participated in the subjugation of the Baekgye Army.\nKnowing this, Japan launched a robust diplomatic offensive against the Russian government and demanded that it disarm. Meanwhile, Russia, anxious about domestic civil war after the revolution, was wary of discord with Japan and promised to disarm the Korean Independence Army. Accordingly, on June 22, 1921, the Russian authorities issued an order to the Korean independence forces stationed in Free City to disarm and, at the same time, attack and defeat the resisting independence forces, causing the Free City Incident. At this time, the Independence Army units suffered many casualties and suffered untold hardships, causing the Korean Independence Corps to disintegrate.\nGathering of Free City by unit (January to March 1921)\nUnit that went to Free City\nPark Doo-hee (Bukrogunjeongseo): Misan → Iman → Jayusi\nLee Dong-hwi linked unit: Misan → Iman → Jayusi\nJi Cheong cheon Unit: Misan → Iman → Jayusi\nHong Beom-do Unit: Misan → Iman → Jayusi\nChoreography unit: Misan → Iman → Jayusi\nUnits that did not go to Free City\nKim Jwa-jin (North Korean military sentiment): Milsan → Iman → retreat to northern Manchuria\nOther units (Lee Beom-seok, Kim Hong-il, etc.): Withdraw from Misan\nReorganization\nWhile moving to Free City, the units that did not respond to disarmament returned to Manchuria from Iman, Primorsky Krai (now Dalnerechensk Province, Primorsky Krai, Russia). Units that moved to Free City suffered the Heihe Incident (Yiqing) in the integration process. After the Heihe Incident, the remaining troops in Free City were reorganized into the Koryo Revolutionary Army. Afterward, the Koryo Revolutionary Army moved to Irkutsk.\nAfter the Free City Incident in June 1921, the Korean Independence Corps was reorganized into several units as follows:\n* Koryo Revolutionary Army (Ohamuk): 1921.8 Irkutsk, Irkutsk Province → Attached to the 5th Red Army.\n* Korean Volunteer Military Association ( Use ): 1921.10 Iman-si, Primorsky Krai (Dalneretsensk) → Reorganized into the Red Army Special Infantry Battalion\n* Korean Independence Corps (Lee Beom-yoon, Kim Jwa-jin): 1922.8 Dongnyeong County, Heilongjiang Province - Reorganization of remaining troops\n* Jeokgidan (Choi Bongseol): 1923.1 Haesamwi, Primorsky Krai (Vladivostok) Shinhanchon\n* Goryeo Revolutionary Army ( Kim Gyu-sik ): 1923.5 Yanji County, Jilin Province\n* Korean Independence Military Statement ( Hyeon Cheon-muk ): 1924.3 Dongbin County, Heilongjiang Province (同賓縣)\nAfterward, the Korean Independence Corps was reorganized in August 1922 by representatives of the Korean Military Government, Uigunbu, Hyeolseongdan, National Association, Korean Liberation Association, Daejindan, Korean Uimindan, Korean New People's Union, and Korean Independence Corps. Lee Beom-yoon was appointed as president, and Kim Jwa-jin was appointed as commander-in-chief.\nEfforts to create an independent corps by integrating the units of the Anti-Japanese Independence Army continued. A preparatory meeting for the military federation was organized as part of these efforts in September 1924. Lee Beom-yoon (李範允) was appointed president, and Kim Jwa-jin was appointed commander-in-chief. Kim Gyu-sik, Choi Jin-dong, Hyeon Cheon-muk, Kang Guk-mo, Nam Sung-geek, Choi Ho, Park Doo-hee, Yoo Hyeon, Lee Jang-nyeong etc. actively Centering on Dongnyeong County in Manchuria, it expanded its influence along the Dongji line connecting Subunhe to Harbin.\nFinal dissolution\nThey expanded their power centering on Manchuria. At this time, several independent army units were officially integrated into the Korean Independence Corps. Still, complete integration was not achieved due to poor finances and dispersed military forces.\nAfterward, amid Japanese oppression of the independence Army, including the Mitsuya Agreement, the army reorganized its organization and continued the unification movement by establishing the Chamuibu, Jeonguibu, and Shinminbu. The Korean Independence Corps was an armed group that sought to unite the Korean community and simultaneously waged a desperate armed independence struggle against Japanese colonial rule, hoping to liberate the country through a war of independence. The Korean Liberation Army inherited this independence movement line. It was an energy source that drove the anti-Japanese movement during the Japanese colonial period.\nSee also\n* Korean Independence Movement\n** List of militant Korean independence activist organizations\n* Free City Incident\nReferences"
