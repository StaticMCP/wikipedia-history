He played his post school rugby for Grammar and made his Auckland debut in 1934.\nLockington, a loose forward, made an uncapped All Blacks appearance in 1936 against South Canterbury, a fixture taking place during the Bledisloe Cup. After scoring a first half try, he broke his hand, ruling him out of Test contention.\nSee also\n*List of New Zealand national rugby union players\nReferences"
