Suhrawardi is the author of the ʿAwārif al-Maʿārif, which is recognized as a masterpiece work in Tasawwuf.\nLife\nSuhrawardi traced his lineage back to Abu Bakr, the first Caliph. From an early age onwards, Suhrawardi studied Islamic jurisprudence, law, logic, theology, Quranic studies and Hadith studies. Suhrawardi quickly excelled in his studies and mastered, at an early age, the Shafi'i and Hanbali madhabs.  Suhrawardi was eventually designated as Shaykh al-Islam by Caliph al-Nasir under the Abbasids.\nThe ʿAwārif al-Maʿārif\nSuhrawardi wrote the ʿAwārif al-Maʿārif (translated as \"Benefits of Intimate Knowledge\", or other as \"The Knowledge of the Spiritually Learned\"). The ʿAwārif al-Maʿārif quickly became one of the most popular books on Sufism throughout the Muslim world. This book was allegedly translated into English by Henry Wilberforce-Clarke and published as \"A Dervish Textbook\" in 1891, although the Persian text which was the basis for this translation is likely to have been misattributed. It was reprinted by Octagon Press in 1980.\nGallery\nFile:مرقد ومقبرة الشيخ عمر السهروردي في بغداد.jpg|Umar Al Suhrawardi's tomb in Baghdad 1912\nFile:الباب الوسطاني قرب مرقد الشيخ عمر السهروردي.jpg|Umar Al Suhrawardi's tomb in Baghdad 1912\nSee also\n*Mausoleum of Umar Suhrawardi\n*Suhrawardy family\nReferences\nSources\n*\n* Ohlander, Erik, Sufism in an Age of Transition: Umar al-Suhrawardi and the Rise of the Islamic Mystical Brotherhood (Leiden, Brill, 2008) (Islamic History and Civilization, 71).\n* Huda, Qamar-ul, Striving for Divine Union: Spiritual Exercises for Suhrawardī Sūfīs (Psychology Press, 2003)\n*"
