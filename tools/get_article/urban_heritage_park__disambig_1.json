After conservation area status was obtained for the area in Castlefield, a conservation committee representing the area's stakeholders was formed three years later, with three objectives:\n*To preserve and interpret the area's history\n*To influence future planning applications\n*To attract allocations of funds for improvements specially related to recreation and tourism\nThe group declared the area an \"urban heritage park\" later that year, and the term was heavily marketed. 25 years later, the term has become accepted and appears in titles of academic courses.\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Bibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070806174407/http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1144041 Planning Policy Guidance Note 15: Planning and the Historic Environment],"
