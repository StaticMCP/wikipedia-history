It was the Hollies' last album to feature Graham Nash until 1983's What Goes Around, as well as the last to feature songs written solely by members Allan Clarke, Graham Nash and Tony Hicks.\nAs noted below, this album was really a Nash-led project, and he featured as the lead vocalist more than on any prior album.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;The Hollies\n*Allan Clarke – vocals, harmonica\n*Tony Hicks – lead guitar, vocals\n*Graham Nash – rhythm guitar, vocals\n*Bobby Elliott – drums\n*Bernie Calvert – bass, keyboards\nReferences"
