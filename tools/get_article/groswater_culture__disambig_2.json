The culture was of Arctic origin and migrated south after the decline of the Maritime Archaic people following the 900 BC Iron Age Cold Epoch. It is believed to have been replaced by or developed into the Dorset culture around 2000 BP. It is named after Groswater Bay, a bay in central Labrador.\nArchaeological Evidence\nRemains of animals found in Groswater sites imply a reliance on sea mammals, especially the Harp seal. Sea birds, small game, and caribou were also hunted. Sites were situated on headlands and their tools were focused on hunting sea mammals. They demonstrate fine craftsmanship with stone tools, creating lithic and bone tools that were small and finely chipped. They used tools made from finely cut chert, a rock used by the Paleo-Eskimo peoples of the North Atlantic. It is unclear why the Groswater Culture declined, although historians have hypothesized changes in climate and availability of marine animals as well as gradual replacement by the Dorset culture.\nTool Construction\nThey demonstrate fine craftsmanship with stone tools, creating lithic and bone tools that were small and finely chipped or ground. They used tools made from finely cut chert, a rock used by the Paleo-Eskimo peoples of the North Atlantic. Many of these tools are sourced from a chert outcrop in Cow Head, Newfoundland.\nSubsistence\nAs most Groswater lived coastally,  they mostly hunted marine mammals and other marine animals. Much of the evidence for their subsistence is related to seal hunting, specifically harp seals and harbour seals.  They also hunted caribou seasonally.  Their coastal dwellings also meant they could have subsisted on other marine animals, such as sea birds, shellfish, and fish.  Seasonal food availability likely influenced where the Groswater moved to. They were very mobile,  and they strategically focused on seasonal resources for subsistence.\nSee also\n* Early Paleo-Eskimo\n* Thule\n* Arctic Small Tool Tradition\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
