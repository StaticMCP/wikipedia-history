They were the leading audio book awards in Australia between 1989 and 1999, and were open to both commercial and non-commercial publishers.\nThe aims were: to improve the quality of Australian audio book production by recognising the achievements of the producers/publishers and narrators; to increase public awareness of books in this format; and to promote consumer access to a wide range of Australian audio books.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year !!
