The death of Prince Jeremi Wisniowiecki, who constantly insisted on the most energetic and ruthless tactics possible against the Zaporozhian Cossacks, delayed movement of the Crown Army until 23 August 1651, when it moved to the village of Trylisy, capturing the garrison of the Zaporozhian Cossacks numbered around 600 men in the next day.

A good mile ahead, the Zaporozhian Cossack’s and Crimean Tatar’s cavalry came out to engage us and I moved against them in a formation similar to that at the Battle of Berestechko in 28 June — 10 July, 1651, adhering to the information given by His Royal Majesty and attacked the enemy in a broad line. I committed the right flank to Prince Janusz Radziwiłł and the left flank to Hetman Marcin Kalinowski, together with Hetman Stanisław Potocki.  He ordered the vanguard regiment into battle and drove the enemy right into their camp, littering the field abundantly with the Zaporozhian Cossack’s and Crimean Tatar’s military corpses.\" On Sunday in 24 September 1651, the Zaporozhian Cossacks were building a rampart near a dike and Stanisław Potocki ordered our the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth’s forces to go into the field, our light cavalry skirmishers fought against the Zaporozhian Cossacks and Crimean Tatars who’s withdrew to the marshes\".
