      "text": "# List of Italian music awards\n\nThere are a great number of music competitions that offer prizes for performance and composition in both classical and popular music. Prizes may be monetary, but may also be in the form of less tangible things such as scholarships, recording contract, concert performances, a chance to have one's composition published or performed by an orchestra, etc. Some music festivals—even though there may be a \"winner\"—offer nothing more than exposure on television. That is important for musicians, but not technically a \"prize\" and those items are not included on this list. Nor are in-house conservatory prizes included—that is, competitions open only to students of the respective conservatory. This list includes competitions that are, generally speaking,  open to \"all-comers,\" although some of them impose age limits or residency (in Italy) requirements.  The list, below, divided by area of interest; that is, classical, jazz, opera, instrumental, etc. Most of the competitions listed are annual affairs. Where possible, the competition name is linked to an external site, or an email address is provided where further details should be available.\nPopular music\n* Italian Music Awards\n* Latin Music Italian Awards\nClassical music\npiano\n*'International Piano Competition 'Mauro Paolo Monopoli Prize'\nBarletta.
