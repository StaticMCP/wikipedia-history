Albert based his claim to the Swedish crown on his family ties: his mother, whose paternal grandfather was King Magnus Ladulås, positioned him as the first in line for the Swedish throne after the dethronement or deaths of all of Magnus Eriksson's children. Additionally, Albert traced his lineage through Princess Christina, a daughter of Sverker II, who was King of Sweden from 1196 to 1208.\nReign\nIn 1363, members of the Swedish Council of Aristocracy, led by Bo Jonsson Grip, arrived at the court of Mecklenburg. They had been banished from Sweden after a revolt against King Magnus Eriksson, Albert's uncle who was unpopular with the nobility. At the nobles' request, Albert launched an invasion of Sweden supported by several German dukes and counts and several Hanseatic cities in Northern Germany. Stockholm and Kalmar in Sweden, with large Hanseatic populations, also welcomed the intervention.\nAlbert was proclaimed King of Sweden on 18 February 1364. The ceremony took place at the Stones of Mora. A fragment still remains of the stone commemorating the occasion called the Three Crowns stone. This is one of the earliest known example of the use of the three crowns as a national symbol for Sweden.\nThe arrival of Albert led to eight years of civil war in Sweden between Albert's and Magnus's supporters. In a battle near Enköping in 1365 between Albert's German forces and those of King Magnus, supported by king Haakon VI of Norway, Magnus's surviving son, Magnus was defeated and taken prisoner by Albert. After the initial defeat, King Valdemar IV of Denmark, Haakon's father-in-law, intervened on Magnus's and Haakon's behalf, and Valdemar's forces were joined by Swedish peasants who supported Magnus. Apart from German strongholds like Stockholm, Albert was unpopular among Swedes who were discontent with Albert's policy of appointing Germans as officials in all the Swedish provinces.\nWith the help of Danish and Swedish allies, King Haakon managed to temporarily beat back Albert and lay siege on Stockholm in 1371. However, the siege was short-lived; with military help from the Swedish nobility in Stockholm, Albert was able to beat back the Norwegians and the Danes. A peace agreement was signed, with the condition that Magnus be released and allowed to travel freely back to Norway (where he had also been king until 1355 and now spent the rest of his life). Albert had secured the Swedish crown, but was also forced to make a belated coronation oath in which he agreed to extensive concessions to the Swedish nobility in the regency council. Bo Jonsson (Grip) used this power to personally usurp 1,500 farms and he soon became Sweden's largest landowner, controlling a third of the entirety of the Swedish territory and possessing the largest non-royal wealth in the country.\nDeposition\nAlbert kept the crown of Sweden for another 19 years, but most of western Sweden did not support his reign. When he attempted to introduce reduction of the large estates of the Swedish nobility, he lost his support in Stockholm. In 1389, facing a loss of landholdings and wealth, the Swedish regency council turned to Haakon's widow Margaret to plead for help in getting rid of Albert. Queen Margaret sent troops and in February 1389, they defeated Albert at the Battle of Åsle. Albert was captured, deposed and sent to Lindholmen Castle in Scania, where he spent the next six years imprisoned. He was released after 16 days of peace negotiations in 1395, during which he agreed to either give up Stockholm within three years, or pay large sums in retribution to Margaret. When the three years were up, Albert's (then) only son Erik had died after ruling Gotland in Sweden for a short time as instigated by his father, and Albert chose to give up Stockholm rather than pay the fine. In 1398 the agreement came into force, granting Margaret possession of Stockholm.\nAlbert returned to Mecklenburg, remarried (to Agnes of Brunswick-Lüneburg), had another son and reigned as Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin until his death, seven months before Margaret's in 1412. He had finally formally abdicated his Swedish throne in 1405, but until then he and his wife styled themselves King and Queen of Sweden. His tomb is in the Doberan Minster in Bad Doberan, Germany.\nMarriages and children\nAlbert married Richardis of Schwerin, daughter of count Otto of Schwerin, in a marriage contracted in Wismar on 12 October 1352. The King and Queen had two children:\n#Erik (died 1397), Swedish crown prince and ruler of Gotland\n#Richardis Catherine (died 1400), married in Prague in 1388 to Emperor Charles IV's fifth son John of Bohemia (1370–1396), Margrave of Moravia and Duke of Görlitz (Lusatia).\nQueen Richardis died in 1377 and was buried in Stockholm.\nIn February 1396 a double wedding was arranged in Schwerin. Albert married Agnes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, widow of Count Burkhard of Mansfeld (died 1389/1390) and Duke Bogislaw VI of Pomerania (died 1393), while his son Erik married Sophie, the daughter of Duke Bogislaw. Albert and Agnes had a son:\n#Albert V of Mecklenburg (died 1423), Duke of Mecklenburg and Schwerin\nQueen Agnes died in 1430/1434.\nReferences\nBibliography\nIn English\n*\n*\n*\nIn other languages\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  A good overall German source describing Albert's life.\n*\nExternal links\n*"
