The lead character is portrayed by Jason Gedrick; his best friend is portrayed by Donnie Wahlberg. The film premiered on March 12, 2007 on A&E.\nBackground\nThe film is loosely based on a true story about the exploits of Chris Paciello, a transplanted New Yorker who was involved with the Mafia back in his hometown.   He built a house of cards in South Beach, founded on models, money, and celebrity friends, including Madonna.\nAfter an intense undercover investigation, Paciello was arrested on racketeering and murder charges, and went on to testify against known members and associates of the Colombo and Bonanno crime families.\nCast\n* Donnie Wahlberg as Andy Burnett\n* Jason Gedrick as Chris Troiano\n* Ricardo Antonio Chavira as Enrique\n* Brian Goodman as Lt.
