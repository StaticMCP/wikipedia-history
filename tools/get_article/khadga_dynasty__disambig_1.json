Chronologically, the dynasty emerged as a powerful kingdom of Bengal between the fall of Gauda Kingdom and the rise of the Pala Empire. Their ascendancy may have been immediately preceded by the overthrow of a previously ruling Bhadra dynasty. While they did not assume imperial titles, the Khadgas retained sovereignty over the ancient kingdom of Vanga and later conquered Samatata. It was succeeded by the 8th-9th century Buddhist Deva dynasty.\nList of rulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:50%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Titular Name\n! style=\"width:9%;\"| Reign\n! style=\"width:9%;\"| Notes\n|-\n| Khadgodyama (খড়্গোদ্যম)\n| 625–640\n| Father of Jatakhadga\n|-\n| Jatakhadga (জাতখড়্গ)\n| 640–658\n| Father of Devakhadga\n|-\n| Devakhadga (দেবখড়্গ)\n| 658–673\n| Queen Prabhavati (প্রভাবতী)\n|-\n| Rajabhatta (রাজভট্ট)\n| 673–707\n| Son of Devakhadga\n|-\n| Balabhatta (বলভট্ট)\n| 707–716\n| Son of Devakhadga\n|-\n| Udirnakhadga (উদীর্ণখড়্গ)\n| ??\n|\n|}\nReferences"
