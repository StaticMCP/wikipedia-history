The ceremony was held on 2 June 2018 at the Hackney Empire theatre in Hackney, London, and was broadcast live for the first time on ITV and STV. The publicly voted categories were announced on 10 April 2018, with the vote opening that same day. This included a longlist for the Best Actress and Actor awards. The shortlist, including panel nominations, was released on 1 May 2018.\nITV soap Coronation Street won all three of the viewer-voted categories including Best British Soap, as well as taking home the most awards of the night. To commemorate it being the 20th British Soap Awards, they introduced a one-time award, Greatest Moment, which Emmerdale won for their 2016 Hotten bypass crash. Hollyoaks won four awards including Best Male Dramatic Performance and Best On-Screen Partnership, with Doctors actor Ian Midlane taking the Best Comedy Performance accolade. EastEnders actor Rudolph Walker won the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement for his role as Patrick Trueman. The 2018 ceremony also saw the first joint win, when Doctors and EastEnders both received the same number of votes for Scene of the Year.\nWinners and nominees\nPublicly voted\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
