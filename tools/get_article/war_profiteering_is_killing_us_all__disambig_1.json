The band broke up the following year while touring in support of the album. The album's artwork and many of its songs are critical of President George W. Bush's administration and the Iraq War. Musically, the album explores the ska punk and hardcore styles the band was known for, with short, aggressive songs dealing mostly with social and political topics. A music video was filmed for the single \"War Profiteering is Killing Us All\".\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by The Suicide Machines\nPersonnel\n*Jason Navarro – vocals\n*Dan Lukacinsky – guitar, backing vocals\n*Rich Tschirhart – bass, backing vocals\n*Ryan Vandeberghe – drums\nAlbum information\n*Record label: Side One Dummy Records\n*Produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore with The Suicide Machines\n*All songs written by The Suicide Machines\n*Recorded and mixed in April 2005 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado\n*Mixed by Jason Livermore and Bill Stevenson\n*Additional engineering by Andrew Berlin and Brian Kephart\n*Mastered by Brian Gardener at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood, California\n*Paintings by Jime Litwalk\n*Design by Steve and Rich Tschirhart\nReferences"
