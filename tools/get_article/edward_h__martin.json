Following his graduation from Annapolis, Martin entered flight training in Pensacola, Florida, and later in Kingsville, Texas.

His aircraft was hit and burst into flames. After ejecting safely from the plane, Martin was captured upon landing. During his captivity, both of Martin's shoulders were broken during rope torture and he was confined in both leg and wrist irons. He spent a lot of time in solitary confinement and was subjected to beatings. For the next five years and eight months Martin was held captive in the Hanoi area, until his release on March 4, 1973. Martin died at the age of 83 on December 23, 2014, at a hospital in San Diego, California, of a head injury sustained in a fall at his home.\nDecorations and medals\n{| style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"14\"|Naval Aviator Badge\n|-\n!1st Row\n|colspan=\"4\"|Navy Distinguished Service Medal with one gold award star\n|colspan=\"4\"|Silver Star\n|colspan=\"4\"|Defense Superior Service Medal\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|colspan=\"4\"|Legion of Merit with Combat V and award star\n|colspan=\"4\"|Distinguished Flying Cross\n|colspan=\"4\"|Bronze Star with Combat V and award star\n|-\n!3rd row\n|colspan=\"4\"|Air Medal with award star and bronze strike/flight numeral 2\n|colspan=\"4\"|Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat V and award star\n|Purple Heart with award star\n|-\n!4th Row\n|colspan=\"4\"|Combat Action Ribbon\n|colspan=\"4\"|Navy Unit Commendation\n|colspan=\"4\"|Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation\n|-\n!5th Row\n|colspan=\"4\"|Navy E Ribbon\n|colspan=\"4\"|National Defense Service Medal with one bronze service star\n|colspan=\"4\"|Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal with service star\n|-\n!6th Row\n|colspan=\"4\"|Vietnam Service Medal with three service stars\n|colspan=\"4\"|Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon\n|colspan=\"4\"|Vietnam Gallantry Cross with gold star\n|-\n!7th row\n|colspan=\"4\"|Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation\n|colspan=\"4\"|National Order of Merit (France), class unknown ''(France's fourth highest decoration)''\n|colspan=\"4\"|Vietnam Campaign Medal\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19980703165255/http://www.history.navy.mil/download/va-34-38.pdf Dictionary Of American Naval Aviation Squadrons—Volume I]"
