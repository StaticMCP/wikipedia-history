These peoples dwelt from west of the Tyras (Dniester) river and east of the Carpathian Mountains in the north, to the north coast of the Aegean Sea in the south, from the west coast of the Pontus Euxinus (Black Sea) in the east, to roughly the Angrus (modern South Morava) river basin, Tisia (modern Tisza) and Danubius (modern Danube) rivers in the west. This list is based in the possible ethnolinguist affiliation of these peoples – Geto-Dacians and Thracians, and not only on a geographical base (that includes other peoples that were not Dacians or Thracians like the Celts that lived in Dacia or in Thrace).\nAncestors\nas described in The Horse, the Wheel, and Language by David W.

Sapeia, a name derived from the Sapaei tribe, was Northern Thrace and Asteia, a name derived from the Astae or Asti tribe, was Southern Thrace.]]\nCertain tribes and subdivisions of tribes were named differently by ancient writers but modern research points out that these were in fact the same tribe. The name Thracians itself seems to be a Greek exonym and we have no way of knowing what the Thracians called themselves. Also certain tribes mentioned by Homer are not indeed historical.\n*Agrianes (it is also claimed that this tribe was Paeonian)\n*Apsynthii\n*Artacii / Artakioi\n*Astae / Asti, they appear in the 2nd century BC to 1st century BC\n*Beni\n*Bessi / Biessoi, they were among the enemies of the Romans in the Marcomannic Wars (166-180 AD), according to Julius Capitolinus\"\n*Bisaltae\n*Bistones\n*Bithyni or Bythini, migrated to Asia Minor or Anatolia\n*Brenae\n*Caeni / Kainoi\n*Cebrenii\n*Cicones (Kikones), mentioned by Homer in Odyssey\n*Coelaletae\n*Coreli / Coralli\n*Corpili / Corpillices\n*Crousi\n*Dersaei\n*Dentheletae\n*Derrones (it is also claimed that this tribe was Paeonian)\n*Digeri\n*Dii / Dioi\n*Diobesi\n*Dolonci\n*Edoni / Edones\n*Maduateni\n*Maedi\n**MaedoBythini, Maedi that migrated to Asia Minor or Anatolia\n*Melanditae\n*Melinophagi\n*Nipsaei\n*Odomanti / Odomantes (it is also claimed that this tribe was Paeonian)\n*Odrysae / Odrysians\n*Paeti\n*Pieres (They also may have been a Brygian tribe, related to the Phrygians and the Mygdones, and not a Thracian tribe)\n*Saii / Saioi / Saianes (Saians) - Thracian tribe that inhabited Thassos island before Phoenician and Greek colonization.\n*Samothraci / Samothrakoi - Thracian tribe that lived in the island of Samothrace after the Pelasgians and before the Greeks that came from Samos island.\n*Sapaei, close to Abdera, ruled Thrace after the Odrysians\n*Satrae / Satri\n*Scyrmiadae\n*Sintians\n*Sithones\n*Sycaeboae\n*Thyni, migrated to Asia Minor/Anatolia\n*Tilataei\n*Tralles\n*Tranipsae\n*Trausi\n*Treres\n*Triballi\nThracians mixed with other peoples\nThraco-Celts\n*Tricornenses / Tricornesii (Romanized Thraco-Celtic community, artificially created by the Romans, that replaced the Celtic Celegeri)\nThraco-Phrygians\nMixed tribes of Thracians and Phrygians, however Phrygians seem to have been a people ethnolinguistically closer to the Hellenic peoples, Greeks and ancient Macedonians, and not to the Thracians.\n*Mygdones\n*Pieres (They also may have been a Brygian tribe, related to the Phrygians and the Mygdones, and not a Thracian tribe)\nPossible Daco-Thracian peoples\nPaeonians (Paeones)\nThere are different views and still no agreement among scholars about the Paeonians' ethnic and linguistic kinship. Some such as Wilhelm Tomaschek and Paul Kretschmer claim that the language spoken by the Paeonians belonged to the Illyrian family, while Dimitar Dechev claims affinities with Thracian. Irwin L. Merker considers that the language spoken by the Paeonians was closely related to Greek (and ancient Macedonian if it was a distinct language from ancient Greek), a Hellenic language with \"a great deal of Illyrian and Thracian influence as a result of this proximity\".\ntribes (in yellow, north and northeast of Ancient Macedonians)]]\n*Agrianes (also, Agriani and Agrii) (it is also claimed that this tribe was Thracian)\n*Almopians (also Almopioi)\n*Derrones (also Derroni) (it is also claimed that this tribe was Thracian)\n*Doberes\n*Laeaeans (also Laeaei and Laiai)\n*Odomantes (also Odomanti) (it is also claimed that this tribe was Thracian)\n*Paeoplae\n*Siropaiones\nPhrygians\nSome scholars as Strabo believe that the Phrygians are Thracian tribe.\nCimmerians\n*Cimmerians could have been a people of Thracian-Dacian origin with an Iranian overlordship, a mixture of Thracians and Iranians or a missing link and a transitional people between Indo-Iranian peoples and Thracians and Dacians.\nSources\nAncient\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|last           = Herodotus\n|author-link= Herodotus\n|title          = Histories\n|url            = http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/\n|orig-date= c. 440 BC\n|language       = Ancient Greek\n}}\n*\n*\n|last           = Strabo\n|author-link= Strabo\n|title          = Geographica\n|trans-title=Geography\n|url            = https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/home.html\n|orig-date= c. 20 AD\n|language       = Ancient Greek\n}}\n*\nModern\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n|author         = Encyclopædia Britannica\n|title          = Dacia\n|date = 26 September 2023\n|url            = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149413/Dacia#ref=ref24738&tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Dacia%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia\n|publisher      = Encyclopædia Britannica\n}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n*Cimmerians\n*Dacians\n*Getae\n*Moesians\n*Paeonians\n*Prygians\n*Scythians\n*Thracians\n*List of ancient tribes in Thrace and Dacia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mnir.ro/publicat/damian/topo.html Dacian toponyms, hydronyms and tribe names]\n*[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html] - Source texts of ancient Greek and Roman authors.\n*[https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/home.html] - Strabo's work The Geography (Geographica).
