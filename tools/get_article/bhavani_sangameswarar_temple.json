It is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is 15&nbsp;km from Erode, 30&nbsp;km from Gobichettipalayam, 56&nbsp;km from Salem and 106&nbsp;km from Coimbatore.\nThe temple was built at the confluence of rivers Kaveri, Bhavani and the mystic Amutha (Agaya Gangai). The temple was praised in old Tamil literature as Thirunana. The place is also known as Dakshina Triveni Sangamam and Kooduthurai indicating the confluence of three rivers. Devotees perform last rites for ancestors on the riverbank and offer prayers at the Sangameshwarar temple.\nLegend\nKubera, son of Vishrava was gifted an aircraft to visit Shiva temples across the country in recognition of his devotion to Lord Shiva. While he was flying near the river Cauvery Kubera was surprised to see a deer, tiger, cow, elephant, snake, and rat drinking water near an Ilandhai tree on the river bank without enmity, to answer his wonder Kubera heard a voice from the sky saying it was a place where vedas visited, inhabited by Gandharvas and advised him to worship the shiva lingam under the iilanadhi tree. The temples Ilandhai tree gives fruit on all season and was used for everyday puja even today. The cow behind the Vishnu statue remains the harmony between Saivism and Vaishnavism. It was said that every inch under the temple has one shiva lingam. The presiding deity is believed to have been worshipped by Kubera and sages Vishvamitra and Parasara.\nDuring the period of Chera Chola and Pandya, there was a cave connection between the Chidambaram and Sangameshwarar temples and puja's are performed at same time in both temples.\nIn the year 1804, William Karo, a British Collector of Coimbatore district, visited Bhavani, camping in the Travellers' Bungalow. One night, a small girl woke him up and got him out of the Bungalow when he was asleep. Once they were out, the Bungalow collapsed. Shocked by this incident, the Collector turned to thank the girl but to find, she wasn't there. The next day, the priest on duty informed him that it was Bhavani Vedanaayaki Amman, who saved his life. He bore three holes in the temple wall opposite Vedanaayaki Amman shrine and torched these holes to pray the goddess. He offered a gold plate to the goddess with his signature dated 11/01/1804. The holes and the gold plate are present even now and are taken care of with caution.\nHistory\nThe temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nArchitecture\nThe temple is constructed on a  plot.
