Esper implements Event-driven programming and event-driven architecture.\nEsper was created in 2006 by EsperTech Inc. It offers a Domain-specific language for processing events called Event Processing Language (EPL). EPL is a Declarative programming language for analyzing time-based event data and detecting situations as they occur.\nEsper is a Java-based application but has been ported to the C# programming language and is available for the .NET Framework under the name NEsper.\nExample\nThis example illustrates a simple EPL query that outputs a row immediately when within a sliding window of 3 minutes the number of order events reaches 5 or more events.\nselect count(*) from OrderEvent#time(3 min) having count(*) >= 5\nRelated systems\n* [http://complexevents.com/stanford/rapide Rapide (Stanford)]\n* StreamSQL: StreamSQL is a query language that extends SQL with the ability to process real-time data streams.\nSee also\n* Complex event processing (CEP) - A related technology for building and managing event-driven information systems.\n* Data Stream Management System (DSMS) - A type of software system for managing and querying data streams\n* Event correlation\n* Event-driven architecture — (EDA)  is a software architecture pattern promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.\n* Event stream processing — (ESP) is a related technology that focuses on processing streams of related data.\n* Operational intelligence — Both CEP and ESP are technologies that underpin operational intelligence.\n* Pattern matching\n* Real-time business intelligence — Business Intelligence is the application of knowledge derived from CEP systems\n* Real-time computing — CEP systems are typically real-time systems\n* Real time enterprise\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=espertech Research Papers referencing Esper, by Google Scholar]\n* Analysis of Complex Event Processing with Esper by Eric Miller, a book on Esper and CEP.\n* Event Processing in Action by Opher Etzion and Peter Niblett, Manning Publications (), a book that provides Esper examples\n* Open Source SOA by Jeff Davis, Manning Publications (), a book that provides examples of Esper for monitoring web services\n* OSWorkflow: A guide for Java developers and architects to integrating open-source Business Process Management, by Diego Adrian Naya Lazo, PACKT ( ), a book with a chapter on Esper\n* [http://wiki.iao.fraunhofer.de/images/studien/marktuebersicht-real-time-monitoring-software-fraunhofer-iao.pdf Fraunhofer CEP Market Overview, by Fraunhofer, year 2010]"
