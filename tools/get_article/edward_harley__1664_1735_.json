He sat as Member of Parliament for twenty seven years supporting the group led by his brother, Robert Harley.  He was also Auditor of the Imprests. Because of this, and to distinguish him from other family members of the same name, is frequently known as Auditor Harley.\nCareer\nHe was second son of Edward Harley of Brampton Bryan, Herefordshire and the younger brother of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. He was educated at Westminster School and the Middle Temple (1681), where he was called to the bar in 1688.\nHe represented Droitwich in Parliament from 1695 to 1698, after which he was a member for Leominster, almost continuously until 1722. He was appointed Recorder of Leominster for 1692-1732 and joint Auditor of the Imprests for life in 1702. He was a solid supporter of his brother's government from 1710 to 1714. He strongly opposed the 1715 measure in the Commons to have Harley impeached, but this was unsuccessful and his brother was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two years.\nHe purchased the Eywood estate at Titley, Herefordshire and there around 1705 built a new house, which was demolished in 1958.\nFamily\nHe married Sarah Foley, third daughter of Thomas Foley.  Their eldest son (Edward) succeeded as 3rd Earl of Oxford on the death of his brother Robert's son Edward, the 2nd earl, without male issue.  Their second son Robert died in infancy, after which came a daughter named Abigail and finally another son Robert Harley, Recorder of Leominster and twice Member of Parliament for that town.\nSources\n*[https://www.thepeerage.com/p20753.htm#i207521 thepeerage.com]\n*\n*''Burke's Peerage (1851 edition).\n* Sarah Harley funerary monument, Brampton Bryan church, Herefordshire.\nBibliography\n* Rogers, Pat.
