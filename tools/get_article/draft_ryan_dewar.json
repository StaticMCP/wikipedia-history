He has also directed several stage productions and tours across Scotland, including collaborations with actors Grant Stott and Andy Gray.\nCareer\nDewar began his career in independent film before moving into broadcast and theatrical productions. His first self-funded narrative feature was Time Teens: The Beginning (2014), followed by directing Christmas in the Highlands (2019). His later work shifted toward television movies and large-scale theatre, directing for networks and distributors across Europe and North America.\nIn 2019, Dewar served as associate director and camera director on Tony Roper’s revival of The Steamie at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro Arena, produced by Neil Laidlaw Productions.\nThe production ran for six performances to audiences of around 20,000, with national reviews praising its visual design and scale.\nDewar continued collaborating regularly with performers Grant Stott and Andy Gray on a series of Edinburgh Festival and touring stage productions, including Tales from Behind the Mic.\nHe also directed Double Feature, written by Phillip Differ, creator of the long-running Scottish comedy series Only an Excuse?, which toured after its Edinburgh run.\nHe additionally worked with Gray and Stott on The Junkies in 2018.

His direction has been described as “tight”, “fizzy”, and “deft”, with reviewers frequently noting his focus on performance and pace. Coverage of the 2019 arena staging of The Steamie cited his projections and visual scale.\nDewar’s early feature work drew attention within the Scottish regional press. During development and production of Time Teens, local papers reported on location shoots and sponsorship: the Forfar Dispatch covered Angus locations used by the film, the Perthshire Advertiser reported on a Perth shoot, the Evening Telegraph suggested the sci-fi feature could boost local tourism, and the Forfar Dispatch and Herald noted a roof-truss sponsorship to help with post-production costs. Further pieces highlighted community backing, previews ahead of release, and potential international screenings. After the Perth Playhouse premiere, the Perthshire Advertiser called the event “a resounding success,” while The Courier wrote that the feature “enjoyed a much-applauded premiere.” Subsequent coverage noted festival recognition in the US, and Digital FilmMaker ran a four-page feature on the production. Around the same period, Dewar’s short The Wrong Man was profiled in the Perthshire Advertiser – Weekend Ticket supplement.\nReferences\nExternal links\n:Category:Scottish film directors\n:Category:Scottish theatre directors\n:Category:Living people\n:Category:People from Forfar\n:Category:People from Angus, Scotland\n:Category:21st-century Scottish people\n:Category:Television directors"
