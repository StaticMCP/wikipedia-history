The Crusaders, led by eighth-year head coach Homer Drew, played their home games at the Athletics–Recreation Center as members of the Mid-Continent Conference. Valpo finished atop the conference regular season standings and followed that success by winning the Mid-Con tournament to receive the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Playing as the No. 14 seed in the West region, the Crusaders were beaten by No. 3 seed Arizona in the opening round. The team finished with a record of 21–11 (13–5 Mid-Con) which was later adjusted to 22–10.\nThis season marked the first of five straight trips to the NCAA tournament and seven appearances in and eight-year period.\nRoster\n)\n|asst_coach=\n*\n|roster_url=https://www.valpoathletics.com/mbasketball/roster/1995-96/\n|accessdate=\n}}\nSchedule and results\n|-\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium\n| site_cityst  = Hilo, Hawaii\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 66–70\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 0–1\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium\n| site_cityst  = Hilo, Hawaii\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 84–65\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 1–1\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium\n| site_cityst  = Hilo, Hawaii\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 79–70\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 2–1\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = UIC Pavilion\n| site_cityst  = Chicago, Illinois\n| gamename     =\n| score        = 72–84\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 5–5\n}}\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| Mid-Con tournament\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = The MARK of the Quad Cities\n| site_cityst  = Moline, Illinois\n| gamename     = Quarterfinals\n| score        = 118–83\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 19–10\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = The MARK of the Quad Cities\n| site_cityst  = Moline, Illinois\n| gamename     = Semifinals\n| score        = 78–65\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 20–10\n}}\n| opprank      =\n| site_stadium = The MARK of the Quad Cities\n| site_cityst  = Moline, Illinois\n| gamename     = Championship game\n| score        = 75–52\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 21–10\n}}\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament\nSource\nRankings\nReferences"
