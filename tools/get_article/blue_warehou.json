Its length is up to about 75&nbsp;cm.\nThe blue warehou is not to be confused with the bluenose warehou (usually referred to simply as bluenose in New Zealand, and bonita, big-eye or Griffin's silverfish by others), which is a deepwater member of the warehou family.\nReferences\nWeb references\nBibliography\n*\n* Tony Ayling & Geoffrey Cox, Collins Guide to the Sea Fishes of New Zealand, (William Collins Publishers, Auckland, New Zealand 1982)"
