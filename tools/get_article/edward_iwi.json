He notably advocated for the Royal Family to adopt Prince Philip's surname of Mountbatten in lieu of Windsor, in order that any royal children born after Queen Elizabeth II's accession in 1952 would not bear their mother’s pre-marriage surname, which he termed \"the Badge of Bastardy\".\nBiography\nEdward Iwi was born on 28 November 1904 to a Jewish family in London and educated at John Bright Grammar School, Llandudno, north Wales.  In 1913 his widowed mother married Morris Wartski.\nIwi was admitted as a solicitor in 1927, and served as a Law Society examiner from 1938 to 1962.\nHe was a frequent writer to the editor of The Times, usually on anomalies in the law that had been overlooked.\nIn 1937 Iwi called for the creation of a Commonwealth Court, which would replace the judicial functions of the House of Lords and become the court of final appeal in UK cases rather than the Privy Council.  During World War II he was calling for each Dominion to create its own Judicial Committee.\nIn 1938 he was a co-author of ''The Courts of Justice: Volume 1 of Stephen's Commentaries on the laws of England''.\nHe sent a confidential letter to Herbert Morrison, Home Secretary in Winston Churchill's wartime government, suggesting that the then Princess Elizabeth be made \"Duke of Cymru\" to create a focus of loyalty for the people of north Wales, who were considered not entirely wedded to the British cause.  He also suggested the Princess be appointed Constable of Caernarfon Castle. Iwi pointed to a nationalist movement in north Wales that showed signs of emulating or even joining the Irish republican movement.  Indeed, some of the more extreme members were already calling for Wales to be given dominion status. Iwi's suggestions came to nothing.\nAfter World War II, Iwi helped with legal issues surrounding Jewish children who were in the custody of non-Jewish carers, and helped to return these children to the Jewish fold.\nIn 1947 Iwi chaired a pressure group that collected 50,000 signatures on a petition to be presented to Parliament pleading for women to be able to sit in the House of Lords. This petition was never presented, because in 1949, for the first time, the House of Lords voted in favour of a motion to admit female hereditary peers (although they did not finally gain the right until 1963), but he did participate in another petition that was presented to the House of Lords on 2 March 1948.\nIn the 1950s he called for Britain to adopt a new approach to the Commonwealth, to abandon her role as matriarch in favour of a sisterly role.\nIn 1956 he published a selection of essays titled Laws and Flaws: Lapses of the Legislators.\nRoyal surname\nOn 9 April 1952, two months after Princess Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth II, she had declared that the royal family would continue to be known as the \"House and Family of Windsor\", as it had been under her father King George VI.  This declaration was made on the urging of the then prime minister, Winston Churchill, who had long regarded the Duke of Edinburgh's uncle, Lord Mountbatten, as a dangerous and subversive rival who had sacrificed India, and did not want to see that name become the royal family's name.\nIn 1959 the Queen announced she was pregnant (with Prince Andrew) and was due to give birth in February 1960. This would be the first child born to the Queen since her 1952 declaration. In September 1959 Edward Iwi wrote to the then Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan and to Buckingham Palace, about the name of the Royal Family.  Iwi set out his concern as follows:\nThere was strong reaction to Iwi's letter. The Lord Chancellor Lord Kilmuir told Macmillan: \"This is in very bad taste. Iwi must be silenced... he might go quietly.\"\nSir George Coldstream, Lord Kilmuir's private secretary, advised 10 Downing Street:\nAccordingly, Macmillan attempted to rebuff Iwi:\nBut Iwi was not easily put off. He responded to Macmillan on 17 November 1959:\n(Here he may have had in mind a sermon latterly given by Thomas Bloomer, Bishop of Carlisle which, while not mentioning Iwi by name, seemed to give support to his cause.)\nThere were further exchanges between Macmillan and Iwi, with no resolution, until January 1960, when the Prime Minister was on an official visit to South Africa.  Rab Butler reported to Macmillan that at his first audience with the Queen in his capacity as acting prime minister, she had advised him that she had \"absolutely set her heart\" on a change to the royal surname.  On 8 February, the Queen made a new declaration saying that she had adopted \"Mountbatten-Windsor\" as the name for all her descendants who did not enjoy the style of Royal Highness. Iwi was vindicated.  Prince Andrew was born 11 days later, on 19&nbsp;February 1960.\nOn 18 March, The Law Journal contained an article by Iwi entitled \"Mountbatten-Windsor\", explaining something of the history of the royal family's surname and why it had been appropriate for the Queen to have made the declaration she had latterly made.\nPrivate life\nIn 1929 Iwi was engaged to Esther Sacker. Esther Iwi was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1949. In 1951 she resigned as a magistrate at her own request, and became involved in a dispute with the Lord Chancellor, which reached Parliament.\nIn 1955 he retired as a Member of the Council of the Anglo-Jewish Association. He was again elected, and retired in 1962.\nEdward Iwi died in an accident in Venice, Italy on 6 June 1966, aged 61.\nSee also\n* History of Plaid Cymru\nReferences"
