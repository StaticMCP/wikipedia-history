The protests were called over students at the university accusing the university's administration for misusing funding. The protests began on March 30 and ended on April 6, 2018.\nReactions\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education said that such a sit-in could lead to several other student sit-ins across the nation with students disgruntled at the university administration's handling of finances and social policy.\nReferences"
