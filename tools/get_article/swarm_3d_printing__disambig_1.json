A digital design is first divided into smaller chunks and components based on its geometry and functions, which are then assigned to different specialized robots for printing and assembly in parallel and in sequence based on the dependency of the tasks.\nThe robots typically move freely on an open factory floor, or through the air, and could carry different tool heads. Some common tool heads include material deposition tool heads (e.g., filament extruder, inkjet printhead), pick and place tool head for embedding of pre-manufactured components, laser cutter, welding tool, etc. In some cases, operations are managed by artificial intelligence algorithms, increasingly prevalent with larger swarms or more complex robots, which require elements of autonomy to work together effectively. While in its early stage of development, swarm 3D printing is currently being commercialized by startup companies. According to Additive Manufacturing Magazine, AMBOTS is credited with creating the first end-to-end solution for cooperative 3D printing. Using the Rapid Induction Printing metal additive manufacturing process, Rosotics was the first company to demonstrate swarm 3D printing using a metallic payload, and the only to achieve metallic 3D printing from an airborne platform.\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzbWV1sfZ-A Fully decentralized robotic swarm performing collective search and exploration -- Applied Complexity Group and Motion, Energy Control Lab at SUTD]\n* [http://www.swarm-bots.org/ Swarm-bots: Swarms of self-assembling artifacts -- EU IST-FET project (2001-2005)]\n* [http://www.aaaivideos.org/2007/morphogenesis/ Award-winning swarm-bot video at AAAI 2007]"
