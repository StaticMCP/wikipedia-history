The council stayed under no overall control.  Before the election the largest council party grouping, the Liberal Democrats, were two seats short of a majority.  The effect of the election was to make the Liberal Democrats four seats short, to remove their option of relying on the independent councillor and vacant seat where necessary and calling for issue-by-issue full council chamber support of either a third of the local Conservatives or most of the local Labour Party councillors.\nAfter the election, the composition of the council led by 35 councillors was:\n*Liberal Democrat 14\n*Conservative 12\n*Labour 7\n*Independent 1\n*Vacant 1\nThere were no boundary changes (by the Boundary Commission) to affect comparisons made between this election and that of four year's before for the same vacancies.  The council had had no single party overall control relatively frequently, for nine years of 25, since its creation in 1974.}}\nReferences"
