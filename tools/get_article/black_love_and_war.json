At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79 based on four reviews.\nAllMusic's Andy Kellman praised the album, stating: \"on Black Love & War, they channel love for one another and their people, vexation in the face of escalating tyranny, and seemingly inextinguishable positivity into some of their most determined and stimulating funk\". Matt Bauer of Exclaim! wrote: \"the couple's adoration for each other is every bit as potent as their social consciousness, on \"P.A.L\" and \"Fruitful\", two of the cosmic quiet storm cuts that comprise the album's second half. And when Aloe Blacc drops by on \"Smile\", something's seriously amiss if your body doesn't move\". Shannon J. Effinger of Pitchfork found \"Muldrow and Perkins root their work in the present by paying homage to the sound and radical spirit of their West Coast home\". Rich Wilhelm of PopMatters resumed: \"the album hits universal chords while specifically chronicling both the struggles and rewards of existing as an African American family in the 21st-century United States\".\nTrack listing\nReferences"
