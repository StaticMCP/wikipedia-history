The river descends , the majority of which is over the dam spillway, and then flows north into the Nepean River, north of the village of Warragamba, a course of approximately .\nPrior to the creation of Lake Burragorang, the Warragamba River would have been formed by the confluences of the Coxs, Nattai, and Wollondilly rivers in the Burragorang Valley. Downstream, the river flowed through a gorge that varied in width from  to , and was  in depth. It was this configuration which allowed a relatively short but high dam wall in the gorge to impound a large quantity of water.\nToday, the Burragorang Valley and most of the Warragamba River is submerged beneath the lake, and the remaining section of the river flows only the  north-east from the Warragamba Dam spillway to its confluence with the Nepean River.\nThe area surrounding Warragamba River is managed by Sydney Catchment Authority under the  that defines special zones and places restrictions and controls on land use, development and access in order to safeguard potable water.\nPopular culture\n* A popular phrase used throughout greater Sydney Australia is Warragamba Slammer. This refers to a glass of water, which is used in pubs and restaurants.\nSee also\n}}\n* List of rivers of New South Wales (L–Z)\n* List of rivers of Australia\n* Rivers of New South Wales\n* Warragamba Dam\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
