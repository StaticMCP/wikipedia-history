The company develops applications, utilities, and websites for businesses across various sectors. Its primary areas of focus include productivity tools, web-based interfaces, and internal-use enterprise software.\nAs of 2025, Talon Software operates with a small to mid-sized team of approximately 35 employees. It develops tools both for its own distribution and for third-party business clients. The company does not publicly disclose many internal details but maintains some of its codebase on GitHub, where it shares limited project documentation and examples.\nOverview\nTalon Software was established to address software needs within small to medium-sized businesses, particularly in the area of streamlined tools and internal process automation. Its development includes both client-facing websites and backend utilities intended for operational support. Most projects are developed on a contract basis, while others are released as general-use tools.\nThe company does not produce consumer-facing products at scale but focuses primarily on business environments. Its clientele is largely composed of companies seeking customized internal applications or lightweight productivity software. Talon Software’s approach generally includes full-cycle development, from initial consultation to deployment and support.\nProducts\nThe company's main public product is the Talon Word Processor, a desktop-based document editing application. It is intended for general document creation and editing, with basic formatting and file management capabilities. While it is not positioned as a full alternative to mainstream word processors, it serves as a lightweight option for internal use in certain business contexts.\nIn addition to the Talon Word Processor, the company creates customized software solutions tailored to specific business needs. These include scheduling systems, internal portals, inventory tracking applications, and client-facing websites. Many of these products are built on short-term contracts and are not made available to the public.\nDevelopment\nDevelopment at Talon Software is conducted using a mixture of web and desktop technologies. Projects are often written using HTML and CSS for interface layout and styling, while Java is used for backend logic and cross-platform compatibility. Visual Basic is also used for developing Windows-specific utilities and supporting clients with legacy systems.\nMost of the company's development follows an agile structure with small, collaborative teams. Talon Software publishes some of its tools and updates on GitHub, allowing for public visibility of select projects. While contributions from the wider developer community are not actively solicited, issue tracking and project descriptions are available in open repositories.\nTechnology\nTalon Software primarily works with languages and frameworks suited for business applications and traditional enterprise environments. HTML and CSS are used for front-end web interface development, while Java serves as the main language for building backend systems and desktop tools. Visual Basic is used for specific clients with legacy infrastructure needs, especially for internal Windows-based operations.\nThe company does not publicly share its internal development tools or frameworks but is known to use version control and issue tracking systems to manage releases. The choice of technologies reflects the company’s focus on compatibility, ease of maintenance, and the ability to support both modern and legacy business systems. The combination of these tools allows Talon Software to deliver products across a range of platforms and deployment environments.\nExternal links\n* [https://github.com/KnightMRod GitHub – Talon Software]\nReferences"
