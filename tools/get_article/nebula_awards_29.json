Selected SF authors, in short essays, bemoan the state of the genre, yet these stories and novellas (and even a poem or two) give the lie to any pessimism.\" She calls it \"Essential reading for anyone who enjoys science fiction, this collection goes a long way toward demonstrating that, now and then, those who engage in the sometimes thankless task of bestowing writing awards really do know how to pick winners.\" The pieces by Willis, Sheffield and Cady are singled out for particular comment, as are the tributes to Davidson, del Rey and Oliver.\nCarl Hays in Booklist notes that \"Nebula award winners perennially represent the best state-of-the-art imaginative fiction, and 1994's are not exceptions. Editor Sargent provides a superlative showcase for the recipients and several runners-up by interspersing among them biographical sketches, overviews of sf films and poetry, and short essays by sf veterans appraising the year's creative highlights.\" He observes that \"[a]lthough several of the pieces collected here appear in other year's-best anthologies, the Nebula gathering is, like its predecessors, an indispensable representation of the genre's best recent writing and a reliable indicator of its leading edge.\" He singles out the pieces by Haldeman, Sheffield and Cady for particular comment, as well as the excerpt from Robinson's novel.\nBarbara Hawkins, assessing the book for younger readers in School Library Journal, calls it a \"well-crafted collection\" in which a \"variety of styles and themes awaits readers,\" summing it up as \"[a]ll told, a bountiful excursion for Y[oung] A[dult] minds.\" She singles out the Haldeman, Cady, Sheffield and Chambers pieces for comment.\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Gary K. Wolfe in Locus no. 411, April 1995 and Gary Reger in The New York Review of Science Fiction, September 1995.\nAwards\nThe book placed tenth in the 1996 Locus Poll Award for Best Anthology.\nNotes"
