There are 134 graves. Most are  (air force) or  (navy) personnel. Fifty-three are identified, 28 are unknown. Six bodies are those of World War I prisoners of war held by the British. Forty-six were German civilian detainees who were being shipped from Britain to Canada for internment when their ship,  was torpedoed by a German U-boat, , off Tory Island, County Donegal, in July 1940. Dr Hermann Görtz, an Abwehr spy, is also buried there.
