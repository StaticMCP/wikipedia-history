He modeled The New American Academy's approach to education after Phillips Exeter Academy's methods.\nEarly life and education\nBorn Simón Bernardo Warren, Waronker was born to a non-Jewish Chilean mother and an American father. He grew up in Chile, Honduras, Uruguay and Guatemala. When Waronker was 11, his father died and his mother moved with Waronker and Waronker's two siblings to Rockville, Maryland. He graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a B.A. in 1990. He took the U.S. Military's basic course in military intelligence at Fort Huachuca, Arizona in 1991.

Mott School in the South Bronx, also known as Junior High School 22. He had success in taking the failing school in a tough neighborhood and turning it around. This drew attention because Waronker, a member of the Chabad-Lubavitch sect of Hasidic Judaism who wears a conservative suit, a beard, a black hat and a velvet yarmulke, had to overcome prejudice both in getting the job and in gaining the trust of the parents, teacher and students at the school. Waronker, a former intelligence officer in the United States Army, took over a school listed as one of the 12 most violent in New York. There were active gangs, attacks and fights that led to hospitalizations, drug use and alcohol on campus.\nWaronker's methods included expelling and suspending large numbers of students, adding guidance counselors, a psychologist, social  workers, and family workers to the staff and finding ways for more teachers to attend advanced educational seminars. Students got one-on-one or small group tutoring one to three times a week. There were frequent field trips and the school had books in every classroom, a new library, new science labs, and laptop computer carts.  The school was divided into eight small academies, so that small groups of teachers could focus on small groups of students.\nWaronker was awarded the French Ordre des Palmes Académiques on October 20, 2009, and was knighted by French Ambassador Pierre Vimont at the Tweed Courthouse, headquarters of the New York City Department of Education.\nIn the fall of 2010, Waronker opened a new public school, The New American Academy, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York.\nOn March 22, 2011, Waronker was recognized by the New York State Senate for his receipt of the Elementary School Principal of the Year Award from the Association of Orthodox Jewish Teachers with\nIn 2019, Waronker assumed leadership of the Yeshiva Beth Rivkah Ladies College in Australia.
