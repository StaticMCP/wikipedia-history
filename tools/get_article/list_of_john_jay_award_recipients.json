The dinner was cancelled in 1989, when alumni awardee Frank Lorenzo, then Chairman of Eastern Air Lines, was widely criticized for his treatment of Eastern Air Lines' striking machinists and for his controversial managing techniques.\nIn 2004, the award was given to American real estate businessman Peter Kalikow, who was serving as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and was the former owner and publisher of the New York Post. Kalikow's son graduated from the college in 2002 and he had been a major donor to the university. His selection marked the first time since 1979 that the award was given to a non-alumnus of the college. His receipt had generated controversy among professors and alumni, among them Professor Michael Rosenthal and former Alumni Association President Harvey Rubin, an independent publisher who is the father of college alumni James and Elizabeth Rubin. Since then, only alumni of the college are eligible for the award.\nSee also\n* List of Columbia College people\n* Columbia College, the undergraduate liberal arts college of Columbia University\nExternal links\n*\nReferences"
