      "text": "# Viking rock\n\nViking rock () is a rock music genre that takes much of its themes from 19th-century Viking romanticism, mixing it with elements of rockabilly, Oi! or street punk, and folk music. Frequent themes occurring in Viking rock include vikings and Norse mythology, as well as Sweden's King Karl XII and the Caroleans.\nViking rock is often linked to white supremacy. Many make no distinction between Viking rock and white power music, and there is debate whether Viking rock is essentially racist. Some viking rock bands, however,  disapprove of racism such as the Swedish band Hel.\nKuggnäsfestivalen is a music festival that caters to viking rock.\nList of notable Viking rock bands\n*Glittertind\n*Hel\n*Ultima Thule\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.vikingarock.se Vikingarock.se] - Sweden's largest homepage about Viking rock\nnl:Vikingarock"
