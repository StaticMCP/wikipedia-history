It collects 40 tracks spanning the band's career from 1983 to 1987, including B-sides, demos and live recordings, many of which are previously unreleased. All tracks have been remastered for this release and the album's booklet includes sleevenotes by Rolling Stone's David Fricke. The long version of \"Looking for Lewis and Clark\" from the 10-inch single release makes its first appearance on CD here.\nReception\n| rev2 = Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n|rev2score =\n}}\nAllMusic's Matthew Greenwald called it \"an excellent collection from one of the most honest and genuinely gifted bands of the period.\" He added, \"They were a great band, and should be remembered as such. The Long Ryders' Anthology accomplishes just that.\" No Depression magazine wrote, \"The uninitiated may find in this a new obsession, but old fans will recognize that the Long Ryders have aged pretty darn well for a band that looked and sounded worn to begin with.\" They felt, however, that the compilation wasn't without flaws, as some of the band's best tracks were omitted to make room for \"a dozen or so rarities and (occasionally clunky) demos.\"\nTrack listing\nDisc one\nDisc two\nPersonnel\nCredits are adapted from the album liner notes.\n;The Long Ryders\n*Sid Griffin – guitar, autoharp, harmonica, bugle, vocals\n*Steve McCarthy – guitar, steel guitar, banjo, mandolin, lap steel guitar, keyboards, vocals\n*Greg Sowders – drums, percussion, keyboards\n*Tom Stevens – bass, double bass, cello, acoustic guitar, vocals (except 10-5-60)\n*Des Brewer – bass, vocals (10-5-60)\n;Additional musicians\n*Gene Clark – additional vocals on \"Ivory Tower\"\n*Dave Pearlman – steel guitar on \"(Sweet) Mental Revenge\"\n*Steve Wickham – violin on \"If I Were a Bramble and You Were a Rose\"\n*Christine Collister – vocals on \"If I Were a Bramble and You Were a Rose\"\n*Debbi Peterson – vocals on \"I Want You Bad\"\n*Vicki Peterson – vocals on \"I Want You Bad\"\n*David Hidalgo – accordion on \"The Light Gets in the Way\"\n;Technical\n*Bill Inglot – compilation producer, mastering, mixing\n*Sid Griffin – compilation producer, mixing\n*John Strother – mixing\n*Dan Hersch – mastering\n*Ed Colver – cover photography\n*Glen Colver – booklet photos\n*Greg Allen – booklet photos\n*Henry Diltz – booklet photos\n*Wherefore Art? – design\n*David Fricke – liner notes\n*Terri Tierney – project coordinator\n*Catherine Ladis – project assistance\n*Bill Levenson – executive producer\n*All previously unreleased tracks (except \"I Can't Hide\") mixed at Penguin Studios, Los Angeles, March 1997\n*All tracks mastered at DigiPrep Studios, Hollywood\nReferences"
