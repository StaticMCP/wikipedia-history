It is the second novel published in The Nobles series, and was published in paperback in October, 1995.\nPlot summary\nWar in Tethyr is a novel in which a beautiful warrior leads a party of adventurers against her enemies, and unite the locals to their cause.\nReception\nGideon Kibblewhite reviewed War in Tethyr for Arcane magazine, rating it a 2 out of 10 overall. He starts the review by saying: \"Oh dear, oh dear. Victor Milan leaves almost no cliché unturned in this weak Forgotten Realms effort. From the book's corny beginning to its cheesy end, there is little of worth. A few background ideas may be found in its pages (there are a couple of good monsters, a take on body-snatching and some information about the city and people of Zazesspur) but you'll have to put up with an excruciating story.\" He criticizes the unoriginal plot, calling the heroes \"The A Team with swords\", and comments: \"All the old veterans are wheeled out; a dwarf that mutters and tears at his beard, a half-elven bard with a voice like a golden bell, the list goes on...\" Kibblewhite concludes the review by saying: \"Game tie-in novels are hard to recommend when, like this one, all they supply is a dodgy story filled with constant references to how lithe, flat-bellied and supple the heroine is. There is a talking horse, though. Unfortunately, its name is Goldie and comes out with lines like 'I sense trouble ahead, Randi Star.'\"\nReferences"
