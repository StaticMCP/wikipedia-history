First documented by linguist Carmel O'Shannessy of the University of Michigan, it is spoken in the Warlpiri community of Lajamanu, mostly by people under the age of 40. As of 2013, there were 350 native speakers of Light Warlpiri, although all of the speakers also knew traditional Warlpiri and many speak Kriol and English.\nCharacteristics\nLike other mixed languages, such as Gurindji Kriol, Michif and Medny Aleut, Light Warlpiri takes its nominal and verbal systems from different source languages.  Most nouns are from Warlpiri or English and take Warlpiri case-marking, but most verbs and the verbal inflection/auxiliary structure are both borrowed and significantly reanalyzed from Kriol and Australian Aboriginal English.\nThis language is written in Latin script.\nHistory\nLight Warlpiri appears to have originated in the 1980s as a codification and expansion of the Warlpiri/Kriol/English code-switching patterns used in speech directed to young children. The children processed the input they heard as a single system, and added innovations in the verb complex. Within the community, it is perceived as a variety of Warlpiri.\nSee also\n* Gurindji Kriol\nReferences\nCitations\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://doreco.huma-num.fr/languages/ligh1234 Light Warlpiri DoReCo corpus] compiled by Carmel O'Shannessy.
