It primarily produces simulation games for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, including the 18 Wheels of Steel and Truck Simulator series. The name is an initialism based on the surnames of the three founders, Pavel Šebor, Martin Český and Petr Šebor.\nGames\nBus Driver\nSCS released a bus driving simulator, Bus Driver, in 2007. Later in 2014, an iOS version of Bus Driver was released, Bus Driver – Pocket Edition.\nHunting Unlimited\nThe Hunting Unlimited series consists of games Hunting Unlimited, Hunting Unlimited 2, Hunting Unlimited 3,  Hunting Unlimited 4, Hunting Unlimited 2008, Hunting Unlimited 2009 and Hunting Unlimited 2010.\nHunting Unlimited 2 was released on 30 September 2003.\n18 Wheels of Steel\nThe 18 Wheels of Steel series primarily focuses on North America. The series was published by ValuSoft from 2002, with Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel, to 2011, with 18 Wheels of Steel: Extreme Trucker 2.\nTruck Simulator\nThe Truck Simulator series includes Euro Truck Simulator, published in 2008 and its sequel game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, which was released in 2012. Both games focus on truck/lorry driving in European countries, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Italy, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, and Switzerland. SCS Software has released a number of maps as downloadable content (DLC) for Euro Truck Simulator 2''. The first DLC, \"Going East!\" was released in late 2013, and includes a number of Eastern European countries; adding Hungary and expanding on the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. A further map expansion for Scandinavia; including Denmark, Norway and Sweden; was released on 6 May 2015. The update also included licensed Mercedes-Benz trademarks and branding. Further map DLCs included \"Vive la France\" on 5 December 2016 expanding further into France, and \"Italia\" on 5 December 2017 adding to the game's coverage of Italy. Released on 29 November 2018, \"Beyond the Baltic Sea\" expanded across Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and parts of Russia and Finland, and \"Road to the Black Sea\" added Romania, Bulgaria, and the Thrace region of Turkey on 5 December 2019. \"Iberia\", released 8 April 2021, added Spain and Portugal. Future plans as of 2023 include \"West Balkans\" and \"Heart of Russia\" DLCs, although the latter has been delayed indefinitely due to concerns over the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nFollowing the success of the Euro Truck Simulator series, SCS announced that the next game in the series would be American Truck Simulator, which was released on 2 February 2016. The game currently covers the entire western U.S. states in the lower 48, including part of the south central and midwestern regions of California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas, Missouri and Iowa. The game features licensed American conventional trucks; including models by Peterbilt, Kenworth, Volvo, International, Mack, Western Star, and Freightliner. The game originally released with California and Nevada, with the state of Arizona releasing as a free DLC to owners of the game in June 2016 and New Mexico releasing as paid DLC in November 2017. Almost a year later in October 2018, the state of Oregon was also released as a paid DLC. Then, on 11 June 2019, the state of Washington was added as paid DLC alongside the Forest Machinery cargo pack DLC, with Utah releasing on 7 November 2019, which allowed the base map to square up with the beehive state. The state of Idaho was released on 16 July 2020. The state of Colorado was released on 12 November 2020. Then the state of Wyoming was released on 7 September 2021.

Not long afterwards the US state of Texas was released on 15 November 2022. Almost 9 months later, the state of Oklahoma was released on 1 August 2023, which allowed Texas to square up with the sooner state. Nearly 4 months later, the state of Kansas along with the Farm Machinery cargo pack DLC was released on 30 November 2023. Nearly half a year later, the state of Nebraska along with the Sport Paint Jobs Pack DLC was released on 16 May 2024.
