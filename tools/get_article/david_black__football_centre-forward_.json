On 19 October, he made his debut in a heavy 8–2 defeat to Darwen. He scored his first goal for the club two days later, in a 5–4 victory over Liverpool at the Athletic Ground. However, after seven Second Division and two FA Cup appearances the club declared him to be \"a  too heavy\" and so he left by mutual consent in January 1896 and headed for Scotland.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Burslem Port Vale||1895–96||Second Division||7||1||2||0||0||0||9||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Total\n!7!!1!!2!!0!!0!!0!!9!!1\n|}\nReferences"
