Designed by Agustín Querol and located at the Plaza del Emperador Carlos V, it consists of a bronze statue of , a 19th century statesman noted for the authorship of the , put on top of a tall stone pedestal.\nHistory and description\nIn 1894  (Director–General for Public Instruction) resumed an earlier initiative to erect a statue to Moyano, giving a new impetus to the plan, that had failed to collect enough money up to that moment. The popular subscription (organised by the teachers of the Province of Zamora) proceeded then to collect funds from the teachers of all the Spanish provinces. The managing committee for the monument awarded the design to Agustín Querol in 1896.\nEach side of the lower part of the stone pedestal displays a bronze relief attempting to convey feats of the life of Moyano: the moment he reads his teaching project from the podium of the Congress of Deputies; the moment when Isabella II countersigns his famous 1857 Law; an allegory of an \"Angel of the Schools\", and the frontal relief, related to the inauguration, featuring an allegory of Pheme holding a cartouche that reads:  (\"To Mr. Don Claudio Moyano y Samaniego, for the great services rendered to public instruction, the Spanish teaching staff. Year 1990.\").\nThe bronze sculpture topping the tall pedestal represents a solemn Moyano in attitude of reading his laws to the people.\nThe monument was unveiled at its location at the plaza de Atocha on 11 November 1900. The retinue for the inauguration included  (Minister of Public Instruction),  (Rector of the Central University), , , Silverio Moyano (nephew of Claudio Moyano), the Mayor of Madrid, the civil governor, council members of the Ayuntamiento and the Provincial Deputation (of Madrid, but there was also representatives of the Deputation of Zamora), and a multitude of representatives of schools from locations all around the country. José Muro, Vital Aza an  were also reportedly seen among the attendees.\nThe monument endured many moves up and down the city along the tumultuous 20th century (including a first move to the plaza de Luca de Tena, and a second move to some gardens in front of a school). Mayor Enrique Tierno Galván decided to return the monument to its (rough) original location on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of the Moyano Law in 1982, completing the move on 28 March 1982. Municipal architect Joaquín Roldán managed the works pertaining the move.\nFile:1900-11-10, Blanco y Negro, Medalla conmemorativa.jpg|Relief with the commemorative cartouche and the allegory of Pheme\nFile:1900-11-10, Blanco y Negro, Bajorrelieve del pedestal.jpg|Relief with the allegory of the \"Angel of the Schools\"\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*"
