According to Wijnendaele, Aetius was lured into confronting Bonifatius by being appointed Consul in 432, where he was deposed and Bonifatius appointed by Galla Placidia. Aetius and Bonifatius then departed the court of Ravenna, gathered their bucellarii, and met five Roman miles outside of Rimini. Aetius had brought his own troops from the West where he had intended to confront the Sueves, while Bonifatius had brought part of his troops from Africa, most likely being composed of his personal bucellarii and local Italian troops. Allegedly, Aetius had a longer lance and utilized it to spear Bonifatius in personal combat during the battle. Bonifatius, though victorious, was mortally wounded during the battle and died several months later. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Sebastian, who tried to have the retired Aetius assassinated. Aetius fled to the Huns and returned possibly with a large army of Huns. Sebastian, who was unpopular with the army and the court, was exiled and Aetius quickly became the de facto manager of the Western Roman Empire.\nNotes"
