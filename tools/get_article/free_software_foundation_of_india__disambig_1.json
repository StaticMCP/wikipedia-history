It was founded in Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) (the capital of Kerala) in 2001  as a non-profit Company. The FSFI advocates to promote the use and development of free software in India. This includes educating people about free software, including how it can help the economy of a developing country like India. FSF India regards non-free software as not a solution, but a problem to be solved.  Free software is sometimes locally called swatantra software in India.\nIn 2003, after meeting with FSF founder Richard Stallman, the President of India Dr. Abdul Kalam urged Indian computer scientists and professionals to use free and open-source software in research and development.\nLogo\nThe left side of the FSF India logo resembles the famed Ashoka Chakra, that also appears on the Indian national flag, while its right half is a depiction of a compact disc. The combination of both symbols is intended to draw attention to the similarity between political freedom and free software, the latter of which the FSF promotes.\nThe Ashoka Chakra, in addition to being a long-standing Buddhist symbol depicting the wheel of time, also resembles Charkha of India's Freedom Struggle and thus in the current context, may symbolize the Indian independence movement which resulted in India's freedom from British occupation.\nSee also\n* Free Software Foundation\n* Free Software Foundation Europe\n* Free Software Movement of India\n* Free Software Movement\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190927223309/http://fsf.org.in/  Free Software Foundation of India]\n* [http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8675 A LinuxJournal interview with FSF-India team members]\n* [http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/01/2054254 Slashdot] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20040216002739/http://www.hindu.com/2004/02/01/stories/2004020104231000.htm Hindu] articles (dated 2002) regarding Stallman's visit to India.\n* [http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/02/182243 Slashdot] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20040805122346/http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/02/stories/2004070200991300.htm Hindu] articles (dated 2002) regarding Dr. Kalam's endorsement of free software.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011128/http://blue-gnu.biz/content/fsf_india_039_s_impact_far_reaching A Blue-GNU interview: FSF India's Impact Far-Reaching]"
