The ABE-EBA has strived to contribute to the creation of a standardised Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).\nThe EBA was instrumental in the establishment in June 1998 of EBA Clearing, to which it transferred projects that were under development at the time including EURO1, but has always been a separate organization.\nHistory and structure\nThe ABE-EBA was founded in Paris in 1985 by 18 commercial banks and the European Investment Bank. The European Commission as well as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) supported the founding of the ABE-EBA. Since then, the number of members has risen to almost 200. The institutions come from all member states of the European Union as well as from Norway, Switzerland, Australia, China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.\nIn its early years, the agenda of the ABE-EBA included the promotion of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the development and management of a private industry ECU clearing system stretching across Europe. This was transferred in 1999 to EBA Clearing.\nMember banks\nAs of end-2024 the following banks were members of ABE-EBA, with national classification as indicated on the association's website:\n*  Abanca\n*  ABN AMRO\n*  Aktia Bank\n*  Allied Irish Banks\n*  Alpha Bank\n*  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena\n*  Banca Popolare del Lazio\n*  Banca Popolare di Sondrio\n*  Banca Sella\n*  Banco BAI Europa\n*  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria\n*  Banco BPM\n*  Banco Comercial Português\n*  Banco Cooperativo Español\n*  Banco Sabadell\n*  Banco Montepio\n*  Banco Santander\n*  Bank für Tirol und Vorarlberg\n*  Bank GPB international\n*  Bank of America Europe\n*  Bank of China\n*  Bank of Finland\n*  Bank of Ireland\n*  Bank of Slovenia\n*  Bank of Åland\n*  Bankinter\n*  Banque et Caisse d'Épargne de l'État\n*  Banque Internationale à Luxembourg\n*  Banque Michel Inchauspé|fr|Michel Inchauspé}}\n*  Barclays\n*  Belfius\n*\n*\n*  BNP Paribas Fortis\n*\n*  BPCE\n*  BPER Banca\n*  bpost\n*  BRED Banque Populaire\n*\n*  CaixaBank\n*  Caja Laboral\n*  Cassa di Risparmio di Fermo\n*\n*  Central Bank of Savings Banks|fi|Säästöpankkien Keskuspankki}}\n*  Citibank Europe\n*  Commerzbank\n*  Credito Emiliano\n*  Crédit Agricole\n*  Crédit Mutuel Arkéa\n*  Danske Bank\n*  De Nederlandsche Bank\n*  Deutsche Bank\n*  Deutsche Bundesbank\n*  DnB Bank Helsinki branch\n*  DZ Bank\n*  Elavon Financial Services\n*  Erste Group Bank\n*  Eurobank Ergasias\n*\n*  Hellenic Bank\n*  HSBC Bank Plc\n*  HSBC Continental Europe\n*  ING Bank\n*  Intesa Sanpaolo\n*  Joh.
