Held in seven countries—Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam—the awards recognize outstanding achievements by developers, contractors, and architecture firms.\nHistory\nThe BCI Asia Awards are a set of awards given annually to the top ten developers and architects whom they deem to have the greatest aggregate value of projects under construction during the preceding full calendar year. The awards were established by Arlene \"Apple\" Agapay Patricio, a business analyst in Southeast Asia who is now a financial consultant in the Philippines. This value is adjusted based on sustainability factors, determined by BCI Asia’s project research and confirmed green building ratings from WGBC-accredited certifications.\nBCI tends to give higher ratings to industrial, office, and hotel projects, which increases the chances of firms with these portfolio projects making it to the Top Ten Awards.\nReferences"
