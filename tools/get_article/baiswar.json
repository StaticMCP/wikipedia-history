They rank as respectable high caste Hindus. They are either landholders or tenants with occupancy rights. They dress and wear ornaments like ordinary Rajputs, and among the low tribe around them their claim to that rank is generally accepted. Their worship is conducted at a temple of Bhawani (Bhawani Mandir), in Bardi near Khatai, Madhya Pradesh.\nReferences\n*"
