Lots of people, even if they don’t live in Pakistan, feel a cultural connect. They feel that it could be a story of their homes ... After all, our family values are the same. We are extremely brave when it comes to our content. We don’t show you just glamour. We will put up a mirror and show you reality.\" Seven Viewers Choice categories from Television, Music and Fashion were opened for voting on ceremony website and were announced on the basis of highest public votes given to an individual in each category.

Most media outlets overseen the ceremony as a positive step in encouraging talent in Pakistan and praised it progress and achievements in a time period of just three years. Media Poondi wrote that, \"For an award ceremony to cross the international border in its 3rd year where many other award shows of this age struggle with teething issues was a mammoth task which HUM Network was able to pull off owing to its worldwide popularity.\" Hamna Zubair of Dawn.com commented, \"the event held the promise of being a real entertainer, which it fulfilled\". Despite the ceremony started two and half-hours late, she explained that, \"It was well organised, with only a few moments where someone would walk on to the stage a bit late, or a microphone would stop working for a few seconds. Once the show began, it ran smoothly.\" Television critic Fatima Awan of Review.it quipped, \"Hamza Ali Abbasi and Sanam Jung were confident hosts and they did their job well but they were obviously expected to stick to the script.\" In addition she observed and criticized the usage of Indian songs for performances but praised the choreography, the set decoration and script of ceremony, Awan ended by saying that, \"Overall, the HUM Awards were a labour of love; very well put together indeed but next time we would all like to see Pakistani music being promoted on this forum since these awards pay tribute to everything that is Pakistani. The day that happens it will be a very proud moment for all of us.....what better way to say 'Pakistan Zindabad!'\"\nEmanuel Sarfraz from The Nation  also lauded the ceremony by saying, \"The event also marked the 10th Anniversary of HUM Network. The honour goes to HUM for holding first awards of a Pakistani TV channel to be held outside the country. It must have been a mammoth task which it was able to pull off owing to its worldwide popularity. It was one of the most organised events that this scribe has seen. Hats off to team HUM.\" The writer and reviewer Sadaf Haider of Dawn News also favored the Hum Awards commenting, \"this year's HUM TV awards, aired in full on the TV channel this weekend, showed an unprecedented level of organization and high production values from dances to lighting and sets.\" but she slated the length of ceremony and compared Lux Style Awards and ARY Film Awards with the event. She concluded with remarking that, \"overall, the HUM TV awards made for great viewing and will probably only improve with time.\"\nSee also\n* 14th Lux Style Awards\nNotes\n* A: When the nominations were announced Digest Writer and Sadqay Tumharay were still airing on TV and completed their broadcast on 14 March – 10 April 2015 respectively.
