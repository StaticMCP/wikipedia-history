It was proposed by Adolfo López Mateos, the President of Mexico, and promoted by the Mexican diplomats Alfonso García Robles, Ismael Moreno Pino and Jorge Castañeda  as a response to the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962). For his efforts in favour of the reduction of nuclear weapons, García Robles was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982.\nThe following year, López Mateos invited President of Bolivia Víctor Paz Estenssoro, President of Brazil João Goulart, President of Chile Jore Alessandri, and President of Ecuador Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy to make a public statement following the Crisis. They issued a Joint Declaration on 29 April 1963, announcing their intent to undertake a multilateral Latin American nuclear agreement. The presentation of the Joint Declaration at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) authorised Mexico to lead the treaty's drafting. The 18th session of the UNGA approved the Preliminary Meeting on the Denuclearization of Latin America (REUPRAL), held from 23 to 27 November 1964. During the first session, REUPRAL established the Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization of Latin America (COPREDAL).\nThe preparation of the text was entrusted to the COPREDAL, which established its headquarters in Mexico City and held four plenary sessions. The draft was approved on 12 February 1967. The treaty was opened for signature on 14 February 1967 and entered into force on 25 April 1969. It was the first treaty of its kind covering a populated area of the world, establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone stretching from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego.\nThe organisation in charge of monitoring compliance with the treaty is OPANAL (Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean).\nProvisions\nUnder the treaty, the states parties agree to  prohibit and prevent the \"testing, use, manufacture, production or acquisition by any means whatsoever of any nuclear weapons\" and the \"receipt, storage, installation, deployment and any form of possession of any nuclear weapons\".\nThe treaty requires its parties to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency and has a mechanism for states to request special inspections in case of suspected violations.  It formally entered into force when all states in zone brought those agreements into force.  It also has a provision allowing states to waive that entry into force requirement and bring the treaty into force on a national basis.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+ Overseas states' territories in Latin American and Caribbean NWFZ\n!Netherlands!!U.K.!!France!!U.S.\n|-\n|BonaireCuraçaoSint MaartenArubaSint EustatiusSaba\n|| AnguillaVirgin IslandsCaymans\nMontserratTurks & CaicosFalklandsSouth Georgia\n|French GuianaGuadeloupeMartiniqueSt.BarthélemySt.MartinClipperton Island||Puerto RicoVirgin IslandsUSMOI\n|}\nProtocols\nThere are two additional protocols to the treaty:\n* Protocol I binds those overseas countries with territories in the region (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands) to the terms of the treaty.\n* Protocol II requires the world's declared nuclear weapons states to refrain from undermining the nuclear-free status of the region in any way; it has been signed and ratified by the US, the UK, France, China, and Russia.\nHistory\nIn 1962, the Brazilian delegate to the United Nations General Assembly stated an interest in creating a denuclearized zone in Latin America. This engendered interest to create a draft treaty on nuclear disarmament.\nMeeting in the Tlatelolco district of Mexico City on 14 February 1967, the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean drafted this treaty to keep their region of the world free of nuclear weapons.\nWhereas Antarctica had earlier been declared a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone under the 1961 Antarctic Treaty, this was the first time such a ban was put in place over a large, populated area.\nCOPREDAL was the Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization of Latin America created after the Cuban Missile Crisis.  It consisted of four sets of sessions, all of them which held in Mexico City. The purpose of the sessions was to prepare a possible draft of the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\nThe United Nations Assembly authorised COPREDAL on 27 November 1963. The Preliminary Meeting on the Denuclearization of Latin America (REUPRAL) created the \"Preparatory Commission for the Denuclearization of Latin America\", COPREDAL.\nThere were four sets of COPREDAL's sessions. The first set of sessions took place from 15 to 22 March 1965, the second set of sessions from 23 August to 2 September 1965 and the third set of sessions from 19 April to 4 May 1965. The fourth set of sessions, also known as the Final Act, was divided into two parts. Part I started on 30 August 19 and Part II followed on  31 January to 14 February 1967.\nIn the first two sets of sessions, participants simply reported the activities that needed to be done in the following sets of sessions. The agreements made in the third set of sessions consisted of presenting a report of the previous changes to de Co-ordinating Committee and preparing the draft for the following Treaty of the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. At the end of the fourth session, the objective was to entry the treaty into force.\nPreparatory Commission created two working groups. Working group 1 was in charge of investigating control systems and predominant technical problems. Working group 2 dealt with legal and political questions. A Drafting Group was also created to prepare the final texts.\nList of parties\nThere were 13 initial signatories. To date, 33 parties have ratified the Treaty.\nThe following table lists the parties to the Treaty of Tlatelolco. All are also parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The table also indicates which ones had become parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) as of 17 July 2025.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n!Signature\n!Ratification\n!Entry into Force\n! scope=\"col\" | TPNW Status\n|-\n|\n|11 October 1983\n|11 October 1983\n|11 October 1983|| Party\n|-\n|\n|27 September 1967\n|18 January 1994\n|18 January 1994|| Non-Party\n|-\n|\n|29 November 1976\n|26 April 1977\n|26 April 1977|| Signatory\n|-\n|\n|18 October 1968\n|25 April 1969\n|25 April 1969|| Signatory\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1992\n|9 November 1994\n|9 November 1994|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|18 February 1969\n|18 February 1969|| Party\n|-\n|\n|9 May 1967\n|29 January 1968\n|30 May 1994|| Signatory\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|9 October 1974\n|18 January 1994|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|4 August 1972\n|6 September 1972|| Signatory\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|25 August 1969\n|25 August 1969|| Party\n|-\n|\n|25 March 1995\n|23 October 2002\n|23 October 2002|| Party\n|-\n|\n|2 May 1989\n|4 June 1993\n|25 August 1993|| Party\n|-\n|\n|28 July 1967\n|14 June 1968\n|14 June 1968|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|11 February 1969\n|11 February 1969|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|22 April 1968\n|22 April 1968|| Party\n|-\n|\n|29 April 1975\n|20 June 1975\n|20 June 1975|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|6 February 1970\n|6 February 1970|| Party\n|-\n|\n|16 January 1995\n|16 January 1995\n|14 May 1997|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|23 May 1969\n|23 May 1969|| Signatory\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|23 September 1968\n|23 September 1968|| Party\n|-\n|\n|26 October 1967\n|26 June 1969\n|26 June 1969|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|20 September 1967\n|20 September 1967|| Party\n|-\n|\n|15 February 1967\n|24 October 1968\n|24 October 1968|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|11 June 1971\n|11 June 1971|| Party\n|-\n|\n|26 April 1967\n|19 March 1969\n|19 March 1969|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|4 March 1969\n|4 March 1969|| Party\n|-\n|\n|18 February 1994\n|18 April 1995\n|14 February 1997|| Party\n|-\n|\n|25 August 1992\n|2 June 1995\n|2 June 1995|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1992\n|14 February 1992\n|11 May 1992|| Party\n|-\n|\n|13 February 1976\n|10 June 1977\n|10 June 1977|| Non-Party\n|-\n|\n|27 June 1967\n|3 December 1970\n|27 June 1975|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|20 August 1968\n|20 August 1968|| Party\n|-\n|\n|14 February 1967\n|23 March 1970\n|23 March 1970|| Party\n|}\nAdditional states also signed and ratified the two additional protocols.

International organisations were present as well, for example the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\nThe Latin American countries other than Cuba all signed the treaty in 1967, along with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, and all of these ratified the treaty by 1972.  The treaty came into force on 22 April 1968, after El Salvador had joined Mexico in ratifying it and waived the conditions for its entry into force in accordance with its Article 28.\nArgentina ratified in 1994, more than 26 years after signature, and was thus unprotected by the zone during the Falklands War.\nOther English-speaking Caribbean nations signed either soon after independence from the UK (1968, 1975, 1983) or years later (1989, 1992, 1994, 1995), all ratifying within four years after signing. However, as British territories they had been covered since 1969 when the UK ratified Protocol I.\nThe Netherlands ratified Protocol I in 1971; Suriname signed the Treaty in 1976 soon after independence from the Netherlands but did not ratify until 1997, 21 years after signing.\nThe US signed Protocol I applying to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1977 and ratified in 1981.\nFrance signed Protocol I applying to its Caribbean islands and French Guiana in 1979 but only ratified in 1992.\nAll five NPT-recognized nuclear weapon states ratified Protocol II by 1979\nCuba was the last country to sign and to ratify, in 1995 and on 23 October 2002, completing signature and ratification by all 33 nations of Latin America and the Caribbean. Cuba ratified with a reservation that achieving a solution to the United States hostility to Cuba and the use of the Guantánamo Bay military base for US nuclear weapons was a precondition to Cuba's continued adherence.\nThe Mexican diplomat Alfonso García Robles received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1982 for his efforts in promoting the treaty.\nDiplomatic consequences\nThe basic agreement for Latin America is the possession of nuclear weapons directly or indirectly is prohibited. With the intention of The Kingdom of the Netherlands desire to participate, COPREDAL's members decided not to include countries outside the region, including those which had territories in the region.\nThe regional territories belonging to countries outside the region would decide either to permit or deny the passage of nuclear weapons; countries such as United States and France recognised those transit agreements. The Soviet Union refused to recognise such transit agreements.\nSee also\n* Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons\n* British nuclear weapons and the Falklands War\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.opanal.org/texto-del-tratado-de-tlatelolco/ Treaty text]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924060736/http://www.opanal.org/english/ OPANAL website]\n* [http://www.opanal.org/zona-de-aplicacion/ Zone of Application map including oceans]\n* [http://www.opanal.org/en/member-states/ Status of Signatures and Ratifications]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=PSsxmXWChqIC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=falkland+tlatelolco The Official History of the Falklands Campaign: War and diplomacy] By Lawrence Freedman"
