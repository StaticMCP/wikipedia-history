The house was built in two sections.  The older section was built in the 1860s, and is a simple -story, frame structure that now forms the rear wing.  The two-story, Italianate style frame section was added in the 1880s.  It has a cross-gable roof with overhanging eaves and sits on a fieldstone foundation. It features windows with unique decorative pedimented hoods.\nIt was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nReferences"
