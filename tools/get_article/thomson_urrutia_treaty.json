Based on the terms of the agreement, the U.S. paid Colombia 25 million dollars in return for Colombia's recognition of Panama's independence.  This resolved the United States support of the separation of Panama from Colombia in 1903.\nIt was successfully negotiated and signed by the U.S. on April 6, 1914, and ratified by Colombia on June 9 of that year. It was ratified by the US Senate on April 20, 1921.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1365.html Thomson-Urrutia Treaty]\n*[http://www.bartelby.net/67/1674.html The Encyclopedia of World History (2001)]\n*[http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1921.htm Chronology 1921]"
