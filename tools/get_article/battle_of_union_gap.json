It began when a large force of about 700 American soldiers, under Major Gabriel J. Rains, discovered Chief Kamiakin's village of around 300 braves and several women and children, along the Yakima River. In the following two-day battle only one \"non-combatant\" was killed by accident and the Yakama men were forced to retreat with their women and children.\nSee also\n* Cayuse War\n* Whitman Massacre\nReferences\n*"
