The parish was established in 1927 and a church was built in 1928 to designs by Gustave E. Steinback.\nSchool\nA temporary school was begun in the church's rectory building in 1932, and plans were made for a permanent school building, but it was not built at the time because of the Great Depression. In 1934, however, an auditorium and temporary classrooms were built. A four-story school, also designed by Gustave E. Steinback, was built in 1949–50.\nFranciscan Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart originally staffed the school from 1932 until 1980. Since then, it has been staffed by lay teachers.\nReferences\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
