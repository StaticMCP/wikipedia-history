The by-election occurred following the death of MP James Hargest and was won by George Herron.\nBackground\nHargest, who was first elected to represent Awarua in 1935, was killed in action on 12 August 1944. His death instigated the Awarua by-election, which was contested by three candidates.\nGeorge Herron, a local official in the Farmers Union, was chosen to contest the seat for the National Party. The Labour Party chose local schoolteacher Leo Sylvester O'Sullivan as their nominee. Previously, Labour had attempted to secure Victoria Cross recipient Jack Hinton to stand as their candidate, who had previously signalled his interest in pursuing a career in politics, however he was unable to be contacted to confirm his candidacy. Robert Henderson, a local pensioner, stood for the Real Democracy Movement who advocated for monetary reform.\nResults\nThe following table gives the election results:\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*"
