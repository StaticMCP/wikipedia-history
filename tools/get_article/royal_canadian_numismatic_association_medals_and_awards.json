Working with the Toronto Coin Club as host, the first such convention was held in Toronto in 1954. The conventions offered an agenda of educational forums, bourse activity, competitive exhibits with awards to the winners, and a closing banquet, with the highlight being a special guest speaker. . It was also in 1954 that the association issued its first ever medal to commemorate the event. The tradition of an annual convention and a convention medal continues to this very day.\nThe Canadian Numismatic Association's official seal would eventually be used on many convention medals. The seal is an adaptation of Emmanuel Hahn's famous “Voyageur” design, which was used on Canadian Silver Dollars since 1935. The first year that this seal was eventually used was 1963. The original die was engraved by H.F. Sarson of Pressed Metal Products in Vancouver.\nThe Royal Canadian Numismatic Association's official seal would be used beginning with the 2009 convention medal, following the official name change of the organization in 2008.\nAnnual Convention Medals\nSince 1954, the Royal Canadian Numismatic Association has sponsored the striking of a convention medal as a way of commemorating the occasion. The concept was that these medals would be for those attending the event. Eventually, variations were used as awards for those competing in the many convention display exhibits. The annual convention was directed by a host club. Occasionally, the members of the club were responsible for the designing of the medal. The mintages have varied from year to year as the mintage is determined by the host club. The contributing factors will include projected attendance, the economic climate and location of the convention. Consequently, mintages for the medals vary from year to year.\n1954 CNA Annual Convention\nThe inaugural CNA Convention was held at Toronto’s King Edward Hotel on August 23 and 24, 1954. The Toronto Coin Club hosted the occasion and the guest speaker was Peter Seaby of London, England. To commemorate the event, a medal was issued for the attendees of the convention. The designer was P.S. Favro and it was struck with the participation of the H. Barnard Stamp & Stencil Company, from Hamilton, Ontario. Eventually, the dies were turned over to the Toronto Coin Club and given to the Royal Canadian Numismatic Association on permanent loan in 1981.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Specifications\n!Medal\n!Award\n|-\n|Catalogue No.\n|CNA-1\n|CNA-1A\n|-\n|Composition\n|Brass\n|Silver\n|-\n|Finish\n|Bright\n|Bright\n|-\n|Weight\n|11.1&nbsp;grams\n|13.5&nbsp;grams\n|-\n|Shape\n|Circular\n|Circular\n|-\n|Diameter\n|32.1&nbsp;mm\n|32.5&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|Die Axis\n|Upright\n|Upright\n|-\n|Edge\n|Plain\n|Plain\n|-\n|Issue Price\n|$1.00\n|See Note 1\n|-\n|Mintage\n|200\n|2\n|-\n|}\n* NOTE 1: The silver version was a duplicate of the brass version.

The issue price was $3.00 each.\n1955 CNA Annual Convention\nThe second CNA Convention was held at Ottawa's Chateau Laurier Hotel on September 5 and 6, 1955. The guest speaker was A.P. Williams, the Master of the Royal Canadian Mint. Pritchard-Andrews Co., based out of Ottawa, struck the medal. The obverse die featured the old arms from the City of Ottawa and had been previously used by Pritchard-Andrews for various commemorative medals. Pritchard-Andrews retained the design once more for the CNA's medal. The reverse die has been lost but featured the wording: “Canadian Numismatic Association – Chapter No. 1 - Ottawa Host to Convention – Sept 7 & 8, 1955.” Regrettably, the medals were struck from clashed dies and a cracked obverse die.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Specifications\n!Medal\n|-\n|Catalogue No.\n|CNA-2\n|-\n|Composition\n|Brass\n|-\n|Finish\n|Bright\n|-\n|Weight\n|23.4&nbsp;grams\n|-\n|Shape\n|Circular\n|-\n|Diameter\n|39.2&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|Die Axis\n|Upright\n|-\n|Edge\n|Plain\n|-\n|Issue Price\n|$1.00\n|-\n|Mintage\n|208\n|-\n|}\n1956 CNA Annual Convention\nThe third CNA Convention was held in London, Ontario on September 21 and 22, 1956.
