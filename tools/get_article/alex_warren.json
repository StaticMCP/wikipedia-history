He was a founding member of the collaborative TikTok group the Hype House from 2019 to 2022. He began independently releasing music in 2021 before getting signed to Atlantic Records the following year. His 2024 single \"Burning Down\" from his debut EP, ''You'll Be Alright, Kid (Chapter 1) (2024), was his first song to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. His 2025 single \"Ordinary\" peaked at the top of the Billboard'' Hot 100, where it remained for multiple weeks, and also topped the charts in several other countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\nEarly and personal life\nAlexander Warren Hughes was born on September 18, 2000, in Carlsbad, California, and grew up there. He has two sisters and one brother. His father died from kidney cancer when he was nine years old and his mother, an alcoholic, kicked him out of the house at age 18, leaving him homeless and frequently sleeping in friends' cars. She died in 2021. Warren began dating Kouvr Annon, a fellow former member of the Hype House whom he met on Snapchat, in 2018. She moved to California from her parents' home in Hawaii to live with Warren in his car. The couple were engaged on New Year's Eve in 2022 and they married on June 22, 2024, in Escondido, California. He was raised as a Catholic and said that his songs are inspired by worship music.\nCareer\nSocial media\nWarren started making YouTube videos at age 10 and began posting skateboarding-focused content to Instagram in May 2015. He was a co-founder and member of the Los Angeles–based TikTok collective the Hype House, the name of which he came up with, in November 2019. By then, he had accrued more than 600,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel, where he posted prank videos filmed in a first-person style, and 3.8 million followers on his TikTok account. In early 2020, social media users, particularly fans of YouTuber David Dobrik, widely accused Warren of copying Dobrik's video style, mannerisms, and laugh. He was nominated for the Streamy Award for First Person in 2020. Also in 2020, Warren became the host of AwesomenessTV's reality competition series Next Influencer on YouTube, wherein participants lived in a TikTok content house.\nWarren starred in Hype House, Netflix's reality series about the titular collective, which premiered in January 2022. His role on the show primarily revolved around his struggles to maintain his popularity on social media and his attempts to do so through his prank videos, including by staging a fake wedding with Annon. By early 2022, Warren's YouTube channel had more than 2.6 million subscribers, while his TikTok account had 14 million followers. He left the Hype House in 2022, which disbanded later that year. He reported there had been a \"falling out\" within the collective and he was not paid for his contributions. Also in 2022, he created the Locked in with Alex Warren podcast. By 2024, he had more than 16.3 million followers on TikTok.\nMusic\nWarren says that Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes have been inspirations and have influenced his decision to become a musician. Benson Boone and David Kushner are also among his influences. In June 2021, Warren independently released his debut single, \"One More I Love You\", which he began writing at age 13 about the death of his father. This was followed by the singles \"Screaming Underwater\", released in September of same year, and \"Remember Me Happy\".
