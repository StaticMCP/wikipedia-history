The show was originally part of Arkansas Outdoors, and featured many cooking segments from that series alongside new content.\nPhyllis Speer and John Philpot have co-hosted together for over 18 years, first on Arkansas Outdoors and then on Cooking on the Wild Side. Speer is known for her work in education, and a member of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's Hall of Fame. John Philpot is a \"longtime regular on Arkansas radio and television programs,\" known for his work in education and agriculture. He is also a member of the Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame.\nThere was a reunion episode of its hosts (with all new content) in 2013.\nSeries evolution\nArkansas Outdoors\nCooking on the Wild Side was originally part of Arkansas Outdoors, in which hosts Phyllis Speer and John Philpot played similar roles. Arkansas Outdoors began in 1991, and gained national exposure beyond AETN to include Versus Cable Television (previously known as Outdoor Life Network). Arkansas Outdoors was \"produced by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission with the intention of showcasing the natural beauty of Arkansas and the many sporting and nature activities available in the wild, each segment concludes with Speer sharing a recipe or two, using her cast iron cookery.\"\nArkansas Outdoors production stopped in early 2011, although Cooking on the Wild Side continued.\nSeries breakoff\nCooking on the Wild Side became its own series in 2006 as ''Cooking on the Wild Side: A Farmer's Market Tour with Phyllis'' in part \"as an answer to the requests the station received for Phyllis Speer's recipes,\" according to AETN.\nIt evolved into its modern format in 2012 and was distributed nationally in 2014.\nEpisodes\nEpisodes showcase Arkansas wild game, how to use a Dutch oven, and the interplay between the two hosts. According to Speer, the Dutch oven is underused because:\nPrevious recipes have included\n* Squirrel Tamales\n* Curried Goose\n* Venison Jerky\n* Dutch Oven Enchiladas\n* Venison Smoked Sausage\n* Venison Grillades and Grits\n* Squirrel and Dumplings\n* Dove Stroganoff\nEpisode List and Contents\nCooking on the Wild Side featured recipes sourced from the local area, and often featured local game. Showcasing these recipes allowed Cooking on the Wild Side, and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, to showcase local culture and history, as well as teaching Arkansans how to cook game hunted in their state.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Season 1\n|-\n!Season\n!Contents\n!Aired\n|-\n|S01E01\n|Hearty Venison Lasagna with Balsamic Tomatoes & Basil and Chocolate Turtle Cupcakes\n|August 1,
