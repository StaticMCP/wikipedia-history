Mark Fredriksen, leader of the ''Fédération d'action nationale et européenne (FANE), who was breaking with the New European Order, became co-director of the Cahiers européens-Notre Europe until May 1975.\nThe radical tendency of the National Front\nJean-Marie Le Pen called for GNR members to take membership in the National Front in June 1974. The GNR disappeared following the assassination of Duprat on March 18, 1978. GNR activists broke the same year with the FN, joined with parts of the FN (in particular Michel Faci \"Leloup\", former member of the Front national de la jeunesse, FNJ, the youth organization of the FN, and current member of the French and European Nationalist Party).\nNeo-nazi members relaunched the FANE and its newspaper, Notre Europe, while activists closer to the Third Position (Jacques Bastide and Patrick Gorre ) joined Jean-Gilles Malliarakis to found, on February 11, 1979, the  (Mouvement nationaliste révolutionnaire), which became in 1985 Third Way (Troisième Voie'').\nSee also\n*History of far-right movements in France\nReferences"
