During the show, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 1997. The ceremony, which was televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Billy Crystal hosted the show for the sixth time. He had first hosted the 62nd ceremony held in 1990, and most recently the previous year's awards. Nearly a month earlier in an event held at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California on February 28, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Ashley Judd.\nTitanic won 11 awards, including Best Picture, a number that is tied with Ben-Hur and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Other winners included As Good as It Gets, Good Will Hunting, and L.A. Confidential with two awards, and Character, The Full Monty, ''Geri's Game, The Long Way Home, Men in Black, A Story of Healing, and Visas and Virtue with one. The telecast garnered more than 57 million viewers in the United States, making it the most-watched Oscars broadcast in history.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 70th Academy Awards were announced on February 10, 1998, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Robert Rehme, president of the academy, and actress Geena Davis. Titanic led all nominees with fourteen nominations, tying the record for the most nominated film in Oscar history with All About Eve (1950)}}; Good Will Hunting and L.A. Confidential came in second with nine apiece.\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 23, 1998. With eleven awards, Titanic tied with Ben-Hur (1959) for the most Academy Awards in Oscar history.}} It also became the first film to win Best Picture without a screenwriting nomination since The Sound of Music (1965). Jack Nicholson became the fourth performer to win at least three acting Oscars. Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt won for their roles in As Good as It Gets, making it the seventh film to win both lead acting awards. Nominated for their performances as Rose DeWitt Bukater in Titanic, Best Actress nominee Kate Winslet and Best Supporting Actress nominee Gloria Stuart became the first pair of actresses nominated for portraying the same character in the same film.\nAwards\n, Best Picture and Best Film Editing co-winner and Best Director winner]]\n, Best Picture co-winner]]\n, Best Actor winner]]\n, Best Actress winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actress winner]]\nand Ben Affleck, Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen winners]]\n, Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published co-winner]]\n, Best Documentary Feature winner]]\n, Best Live Action Short Film co-winner]]\n, Best Animated Short Film winner]]\n, Best Original Dramatic Score winner and Best Original Song co-winner]]\n, Best Original Musical or Comedy Score winner]]\n, Best Makeup co-winner]]\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| class=wikitable\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Titanic – James Cameron and Jon Landau, producers'\n** As Good as It Gets – James L.

Cates explained his reason to bring back the veteran comedian saying, \"Billy's performance last year was spectacular. There is nobody like him.\" In an article published in USA Today he initially requested to Cates and AMPAS five months after the previous year's ceremony that he would like to take a break from hosting duties. However, pressure from the academy, Cates, and several friends and family members made him reconsider his decision. His sixth stint would make him second only to Bob Hope in number of ceremonies hosted.\nTo commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the Academy Awards, 70 actors who have received both competitive and honorary awards appeared seated onstage together during a segment called Oscar's Family Album. Each former winner was acknowledged by announcer Norman Rose with the films he or she won for. At the end of the segment newly minted winners Kim Bassinger, Helen Hunt, and Robin Williams joined them. This marked the largest gathering of former winners since the 50th ceremony held in 1978. The Academy also commissioned musician and composer Jerry Goldsmith to compose a new leitmotif for the Oscars telecast entitled \"Fanfare for Oscar\".\nSeveral others participated in the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as musical director for the telecast. Dancer Daniel Ezralow choreographed a dance number showcasing the nominees for Best Original Comedy or Musical Score. Bart the Bear made a surprise appearance during the presentation of the Best Sound Effects Editing award with Mike Myers.\nBox office performance of nominees\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 10, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees was $579&nbsp;million with an average of $116&nbsp;million per film. Titanic was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $338.7&nbsp;million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by As Good as It Gets ($92.6&nbsp;million), Good Will Hunting ($68.9&nbsp;million), L.A. Confidential ($39.7&nbsp;million), and finally The Full Monty ($38.7&nbsp;million).\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 40 nominations went to 15 films on the list. Only Titanic (1st), As Good as It Gets (16th), Good Will Hunting (20th), and In & Out (24th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were Men in Black (2nd), The Lost World: Jurassic Park (3rd), Air Force One (5th), My Best Friends Wedding (7th), Face/Off (9th), Con Air (12th), Contact (13th), Hercules (14th), The Fifth Element (25th), Anastasia (30th), and Starship Troopers (34th).\nCritical response\nThe show received a positive reception from most media publications. Television critic Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times lauded Crystal's performance writing that he \"would earn top billing as that unusual comedian as artful at doing musical comedy as jokes.\" San Francisco Chronicle columnist John Carman raved,\"It was the best Oscar show in two decades.\" He also gave high marks for the host, commenting, \"But last night, Crystal was back in razor form.\" The Seattle Times television editor Kay McFadden praised Crystal commenting that \"he possesses nearly impeccable timing and judgment.\" In addition, she noted that while the ceremony dragged on, \"Last night was one of television's smartest live ceremonies in recent memory.\"\nSome media outlets were more critical of the show. Ray Richmond of Variety complained that the ceremony proved to be a \"Yawner of an Oscarcast.\" He added that Crystal's \"off-the-cuff one-liners sank faster than the great ship herself.\" Boston Globe television critic Matthew Gilbert bemoaned,\"There was hardly a spontaneous moment during last night's Oscarcast.\" Film critic Carrie Rickey from The Philadelphia Inquirer lamented that the inevitable Titanic sweep \"sank a telecast loaded with montages of previous years' Oscar highlights.\"\nRatings and reception\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 57.25 million people over its length, which was a 29% increase from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 87.50 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also earned higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 35.32% of households watching over a 55.77 share. In addition, it garnered a higher 1849 demo rating with a 24.90 rating over a 44.30 share among viewers in that demographic. It was the most watched Oscar ceremony in television history since viewership figures were compiled beginning with the 46th ceremony in 1974.\nIn July 1998, the ceremony presentation received eight nominations at the 50th Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won five of those nominations for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program (Billy Crystal), Outstanding Directing for a Variety or Music Program (Louis J Horvitz), Outstanding Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries, or Movie (Bob Barnhart, Robert Dickinson, Matt Ford, Andy O'Reilly), Outstanding Music Direction (Bill Conti), and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Variety Series or Special (Patrick Baltzell, Robert Douglass, Edward J. Greene, Tommy Vicari).\n\"In Memoriam\"\nThe annual \"In Memoriam\" tribute was presented by actress Whoopi Goldberg.
