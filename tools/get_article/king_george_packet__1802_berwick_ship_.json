She sailed as a packet between Leith and London until 1825. Berwick smacks were sloops that could make the voyage between Berwick and London in two days. In late 1825, she became a Leith-based coaster. New owners then sailed her between London and the Continent. In 1826 she suffered a minor maritime mishap. Her crew abandoned her at sea in 1832; she was last listed in ''Lloyd's Register (LR), in the volume for 1833.\nCareer\nKing George Packet first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1802.\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n!
