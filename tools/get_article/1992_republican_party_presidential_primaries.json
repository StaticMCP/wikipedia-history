Bush\n}}\nThe 1992 Republican Party presidential primaries were the presidential primaries and caucuses of the Republican Party, which took place in all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., between February 18 to June 9, 1992, in which voters selected 2,277 delegates sent to the Republican National Convention, held in Houston, Texas, between August 17 and August 20, 1992. At the convention, Republican delegates nominated George H. W. Bush, the incumbent U.S. president, as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, and Dan Quayle, the incumbent vice president, as his vice presidential running mate.\nIn the presidential election held November 3, 1992, Bush and Quayle were defeated by Democrat presidential nominee Bill Clinton and Al Gore, his vice presidential running mate.\nPrimary race overview\nAlthough he briefly weighed forgoing a second term, President George H. W. Bush ultimately sought re-election and entered the 1992 Republican primaries as the incumbent frontrunner.\nBush was challenged for the Republican nomination by Pat Buchanan, a conservative author, commentator, and aides of Presidents Nixon, and Reagan. During early counting in the New Hampshire primary, it appeared that the president might actually lose. However, Buchanan faded by the end of the evening, and Bush won the rest of the primaries. Bush's margins in many of the primaries were not as large as expected, and helped led to the rise of Ross Perot as an independent candidate.\nRepublican Louisiana State Representative and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke also ran in a number of primaries, but he did not receive any delegates. Former Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota also made a quixotic bid for support in the Minnesota primary, winning enough votes to entitle him to one delegate, but was later denied his single vote by machinations at the Minnesota Republican Party's 1992 state convention.\nNew Hampshire primary\nAs Buchanan's candidacy relied heavily on a strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, President Bush made New Hampshire a focal point in his reelection bid. However, New Hampshire still remained a pivotal base for Buchanan's primary campaign.\nBecause Bush was widely perceived to have broken his \"read my lips\" pledge, Buchanan found support in the economically battered and conservative state of New Hampshire. Making Bush's tax-hikes a central theme of his campaign, Buchanan enjoyed healthy grass-roots support despite lagging behind the president in pre-primary polling.\nBush countered the threat posed by Buchanan by touring New Hampshire himself. He memorably told an audience at an Exeter town hall: \"Message: I care\". Some sources claim that this was the result of Bush mistakenly reading a cue card aloud.\nOn primary night, President Bush carried New Hampshire with 53% of the vote. Buchanan finished second with 38% of the vote.\nThe rest of the race\nDespite many in the Bush campaign attempting to push Buchanan out of the race, the strong showing made the Buchanan campaign hope for an outpouring of campaign contributions which galvanized the campaign into making efforts to pull out strong showings such as in the Georgia primary.\nDespite an impressive showing, Buchanan's campaign never attracted serious opposition to President Bush in most contests. Most of Buchanan's \"victories\" were larger-than-expected showings that were still considered landslide Bush wins by most of the media. Still, the fact that Buchanan received more than two million votes nationwide prognosticated trouble for Bush in the general election.\nCandidates\nNominee\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Candidate\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Most recent office\n!
