CKS is one of the five affiliate schools with the High Museum of Art in Atlanta.\nHistory\nCKS was established in 1937 by the Grey Nuns of the Sacred Heart. It is overseen by the Archdiocese of Atlanta.\nIn 1940, high school grades were added. However, these were discontinued in 1958 when St. Pius X Catholic High School opened. It is located at 46 Peachtree Way NE in Georgia.\nThe mission statement is: \"Christ the King School, a nurturing, Christ-centered environment based on the Catholic tradition, fosters academic excellence, individual responsibility, spirituality, and growth of the whole child.\"\nIn the fall of 2019, CKS opened a new building with science labs, a music room, a news room, and middle school classrooms. This was the result of a $30 million capital campaign.\nStudents and faculty\nIts student population is 85% White, 9% Hispanic, 2% Asian, 1% Black, and 3% two or more races. The total number of students for the 20021–21 school year is 570. Sixteen percent of the students receive financial aid.\nCKS has 35 classroom teachers. The student–teacher ratio is 15 to 1.\nMrs. Patricia Ward was the CKS principal in 2018. She was followed by Brian Newhall. The current principal is Melissa Lowry.\nAwards and honors\n* The U.S. Department of Education named Christ the King School a National Blue Ribbon School in 1987, 2007 and 2018.\n* CKS Serves, a family-based service outreach program, won national recognition from Today’s Catholic Teacher magazine in 2017.\nNotable alumni\n* Paul V.
