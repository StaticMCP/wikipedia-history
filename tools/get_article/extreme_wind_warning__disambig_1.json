As of 2024, it has only been used for the eyewalls of major hurricanes when they pass near-shore, and during and shortly after landfall, but it is also intended as a general \"short-fused\" warning for any immediate occurrence of such winds. Extreme wind warnings are issued for as precise of an area as possible, in like manner as a tornado warning, to provide guidance to the general public at the county and sub-county level when such winds pose a significant threat of casualties. They cannot be issued earlier than two hours before the onset of extreme winds.\nHistory\nThe extreme wind warning was created out of a need for an unambiguous bulletin of equivalent priority as a tornado warning for the extreme winds of a major hurricane's eyewall, particularly after Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Jeanne struck Florida in 2004. Prior to the advent of the warning, similar bulletins were often embedded in, and issued as tornado warnings to give them higher visibility and urgency. During the passage of Charley across the state, the National Weather Service weather forecast office in Melbourne, Florida, issued such an ad hoc \"tornado\" warning after the office's forecasters determined that the active hurricane warnings did not sufficiently convey the severity and imminence of Charley's eyewall over central Florida. The forecast office also issued similar \"tornado\" warnings as the strong winds of Jeanne moved ashore from the east later that year. The nonconventional usage of tornado warnings for extreme hurricane winds was praised by emergency management, citing it as an ingenious method of protecting lives. In December&nbsp;2004, the Melbourne forecast office briefed attendees at an annual NOAA Hurricane Conference on their use of the special tornado warning, advocating and eventually reaching consensus for a specialized official National Weather Service product for extreme winds.\nThe new warning was standardized in its experimental stages in 2005, so weather forecast offices continued to use special tornado warnings to broadcast the threat of severe wind during the landfalls of Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The wind and timing thresholds that eventually became the criteria of extreme wind warnings were also used as thresholds for these special tornado warnings in 2005. The warnings, termed Extreme Tropical Cyclone Destructive Wind Warnings, advised residents to take sturdy shelter in the interior portions of well-built structures. During Katrina, the weather services serving the Jackson and New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana forecast areas issued 19&nbsp;warnings. Public response to these warnings was mixed, praising their specificity but finding their placement within tornado warnings confusing, particularly when they were issued near traditional tornado warnings. The advice of taking interior low-level shelter given in the wind warnings also contradicted the advice given in Hurricane Local Statements of taking interior shelter in elevated floors for storm surge-prone areas. NOAA/NWS recommendations called for the development of an extreme wind warning independent from tornado warnings and increased outreach for the warning.\nThe following year, extreme wind warnings continued to be packaged within special tornado warnings for public evaluation, and the warning became its own official independent product by the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, though no hurricane would trigger an extreme wind warning for nearly another decade. Despite the newly independent warning system, until the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, the Emergency Alert System continued to broadcast EWWs as tornado warnings (using the TOR event code). On the morning of October&nbsp;7, 2016, the nearby passage of Category&nbsp;3 Hurricane Matthew just off Cape Canaveral prompted the first issuance of an extreme wind warning. In 2023, the National Weather Service in Guam was granted the ability to issue EWWs, and on May 24, 2023, the first extreme wind warning was issued in the Western Pacific, as a result of Typhoon Mawar.\nIssuances\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Extreme wind warnings issued by the National Weather Service\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" align=\"center\" data-sort-type=date|Date\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"10%\" align=\"center\" class=\"unsortable\"|Event\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" align=\"center\"|State / Territory\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"25%\" align=\"center\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" align=\"center\" |Weather Forecast Office\n|-\n|October 7, 2016\n|Hurricane Matthew\n|Florida\n|Brevard\n|MLB (Melbourne, FL)\n|-\n|August 25, 2017\n|Hurricane Harvey\n|Texas\n|Aransas, Calhoun, Nueces, San Patricio, Refugio\n|CRP (Corpus Christi, TX)\n|-\n|September 6, 2017\n|rowspan=4 | Hurricane Irma\n|U.S. Virgin Islands\n|Saint John, Saint Thomas\n|SJU (San Juan, PR)\n|-\n|rowspan=3 | September 10, 2017\n|rowspan=3 | Florida\n|Monroe (two separate warnings)\n|KEY (Key West, FL)\n|-\n|Collier (two separate warnings)\n|MFL (Miami, FL)\n|-\n|Lee\n|TBW (Tampa Bay Area–Ruskin, FL)\n|-\n|September 20, 2017\n|Hurricane Maria\n|Puerto Rico\n|Aguas Buenas, Bayamón, Canóvanas, Carolina, Cidra, Guaynabo, Río Grande, San Juan, Trujillo Alto\n|SJU (San Juan, PR)\n|-\n| rowspan=4 | October 10, 2018\n| rowspan=4 | Hurricane Michael\n| rowspan = 4 | Alabama, Florida, Georgia\n|Florida: Bay, Franklin, Gulf\n| rowspan=4 | TLH (Tallahassee, FL)\n|-\n|Florida: Jackson, Gulf, Bay, Calhoun, Liberty, Washington\n|-\n|Florida: Jackson, Gadsden, Holmes, WashingtonGeorgia: Decatur, Seminole\n|-\n|Alabama: HoustonFlorida: JacksonGeorgia: Decatur, Miller, Early, Seminole\n|-\n|August 26, 2020\n| rowspan=3 | Hurricane Laura\n| rowspan = 3 | Louisiana, Texas\n|Louisiana: Cameron, Jefferson Davis, Beauregard, Acadia, Calcasieu, Vermilion, AllenTexas: Jefferson, Newton, Hardin, Orange, Jasper\n| rowspan=3 | LCH (Lake Charles, LA) issued by BRO (Brownsville, TX)†\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | August 27, 2020\n|Louisiana: Cameron, Jefferson Davis, Beauregard, Calcasieu, AllenTexas: Newton, Orange\n|-\n|Louisiana: Cameron, Jefferson Davis, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Vernon, AllenTexas: Newton, Orange, Jasper\n|-\n|August 29, 2021\n|Hurricane Ida\n|Louisiana\n|Jefferson, Lafourche, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, Terrebonne, St. John the Baptist\n|LIX (New Orleans, LA)\n|-\n|September 28, 2022\n|Hurricane Ian\n|Florida\n|Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota, DeSoto, Manatee, Hardee, Highlands, Polk\n|TBW (Tampa Bay Area–Ruskin, FL)\n|-\n|May 24, 2023\n|Typhoon Mawar\n|Guam\n|Dededo, Yigo, Tamuning\n|GUM (Tiyan, GU)\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | August 30, 2023\n| rowspan=2 | Hurricane Idalia\n| rowspan=2 | Florida\n|Dixie, Lafayette, Madison, Taylor\n|TAE (Tallahassee, FL)\n|-\n|Suwannee\n|JAX (Jacksonville, FL)\n|-\n|September 26, 2024\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hurricane Helene\n|Florida, Georgia\n|Florida: Dixie, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Madison, Taylor, Wakulla\nGeorgia: Brooks, Lowndes, Thomas\n|TAE (Tallahassee, FL)\n|-\n|September 27, 2024\n|Georgia, Florida\n|Georgia: Echols\nFlorida: Suwannee, Hamilton\n|JAX (Jacksonville, FL) issued by LIX (New Orleans, LA)†&nbsp;\n|-\n|October 9, 2024\n|Hurricane Milton\n|Florida\n|Hillsborough, Manatee, Pinellas\n| TBW (Tampa Bay Area–Ruskin, FL)\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\" |†&nbsp;– Issued by an alternative WFO under continuance of operations; for example, a WFO under shelter or closed due to impending hurricane impacts.\n|}\nExample\nThe following is an example of an Extreme Wind Warning from the National Weather Service office in Ruskin, Florida (TBW) during the landfall of Hurricane Milton.\n404\nWFUS52 KTBW 092236\nEWWTBW\nFLC057-081-103-100130-\n/O.NEW.KTBW.EW.W.0001.241009T2236Z-241010T0130Z/\nBULLETIN - EAS ACTIVATION REQUESTED\nExtreme Wind Warning\nNational Weather Service Tampa Bay Area Ruskin FL\n636 PM EDT Wed Oct 9 2024\nThe National Weather Service in Ruskin has issued a\n* Extreme Wind Warning for...\nManatee County in west central Florida...\nPinellas County in west central Florida...\nHillsborough County in west central Florida...\n* Until 930 PM EDT.\n* At 635 PM EDT, National Weather Service Doppler radar indicated\nextreme winds, associated with the eyewall of Hurricane Milton,\nwere moving onshore along a line extending from 6 miles southwest\nof South Bradenton to 25 miles southwest of Anna Maria to 52 miles\nsouthwest of Saint Armands Key, moving northeast at 30&nbsp;mph.
