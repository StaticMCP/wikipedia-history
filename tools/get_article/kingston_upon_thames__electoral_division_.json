The constituency elected two councillors for a three-year term in 1964, 1967 and 1970.\nThe constituency was revised in 1973 and then elected one councillor for a four-year term in 1973, 1977 and 1981, with the final term extended for an extra year ahead of the abolition of the Greater London Council.\nHistory\nIt was planned to use the same boundaries as the Westminster Parliament constituencies for election of councillors to the Greater London Council (GLC), as had been the practice for elections to the predecessor London County Council, but those that existed in 1965 crossed the Greater London boundary. Until new constituencies could be settled, the 32 London boroughs were used as electoral areas which therefore created a constituency called Kingston upon Thames.\nThe new constituencies were settled following the Second Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies and the electoral division was replaced from 1973 by the single-member electoral divisions of Kingston upon Thames and Surbiton. The new Kingston upon Thames electoral division matched the boundaries of the Kingston upon Thames parliamentary constituency.\nFirst series\n|area              =\n|image             = |frame=yes|plain=yes|frame-align=center|frame-width=250|frame-height=245}}\n|caption           = Kingston upon Thames electoral division boundaries\n}}\nThe Kingston upon Thames constituency was used for the Greater London Council elections in 1964, 1967 and 1970.
