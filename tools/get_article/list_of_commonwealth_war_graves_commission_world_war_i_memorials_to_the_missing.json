The following list is of the CWGC memorials to the missing of the First World War erected elsewhere, both in the UK and other regions of the worlds, limited to those that list more than 1000 names each.\nThe total from the 'numbers' column below of those listed on these memorials is 138,062.\nList of memorials\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: auto auto\"\n|+ Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) World War I memorials\n!Article and reference!!class=\"unsortable\"|Picture!!Country!!class=\"unsortable\"|Location!!class=\"unsortable\"|Co-ordinates!!Number listed!!class=\"unsortable\"|Description of those listed!!class=\"unsortable\"|Dates covered!!class=\"unsortable\"|Major battles!!Date unveiled!!class=\"unsortable\"|Memorial designer!!class=\"unsortable\"|Memorial unveiled by\n|-\n| Basra Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/88400/BASRA%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || Iraq || Basra ||  || 40,625 || UK and British Empire forces || Autumn 1914 to end of August 1921 || Mesopotamia Campaign ||  || Edward Warren || Gilbert Clayton\n|-\n| Helles Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/76100/HELLES%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || Turkey || Cape Helles ||  || 20,884 || British, Indian and Australian forces || April 1915 to January 1916 || Gallipoli Campaign ||  || John James Burnet || not specified\n|-\n| India Gate\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/142700/DELHI%20MEMORIAL%20(INDIA%20GATE) CWGC]\n|  || India || New Delhi ||  || 13,216 || British Empire and Indian forces || entire war and to 1921 || North-West Frontier and Third Afghan War ||  || Edwin Lutyens || Lord Irwin\n|-\n| Tower Hill Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/90002/TOWER%20HILL%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || United Kingdom || London ||  || 12,210 || Mercantile Marine || entire war || naval transport and convoys ||  || Edwin Lutyens || Queen Mary\n|-\n| Portsmouth Naval Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/144703/PORTSMOUTH%20NAVAL%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || United Kingdom || Portsmouth ||  || 9,667 || Royal Navy || entire war || naval campaigns ||  || Robert Lorimer || Duke of York\n|-\n| Chatham Naval Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/142000/CHATHAM%20NAVAL%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || United Kingdom || Chatham ||  || 8,517 || Royal Navy || entire war || naval campaigns ||  || Robert Lorimer || Prince of Wales\n|-\n| Plymouth Naval Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/142001/PLYMOUTH%20NAVAL%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || United Kingdom || Plymouth ||  || 7,251 || Royal Navy || entire war || naval campaigns ||  || Robert Lorimer || Prince George\n|-\n| Lone Pine Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/78500/LONE%20PINE%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || Turkey || Gallipoli Peninsula ||  || 4,932 || Australian and New Zealand servicemen || mostly May to August 1915 || Battle of Lone Pine ||  || John James Burnet || no official unveiling\n|-\n| Port Tewfik Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/143800/HELIOPOLIS%20(PORT%20TEWFIK)%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || Egypt || Port Suez ||  || 3,727 || British Indian Army || 1915 to 1918 || Sinai and Palestine Campaign ||  || John James Burnet || Lord Lloyd\n|-\n| Tehran Memorial[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/142100/TEHRAN%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || Iran || Tehran ||  || 3,580 || UK, Indian and New Zealand forces || December 1914 to October 1918 || Persian Campaign || not specified || not specified || not specified\n|-\n| Jerusalem Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/142016/JERUSALEM%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || Israel || Jerusalem ||  || 3,308 || Egyptian Expeditionary Force || 1915 to 1918 || Sinai and Palestine Campaign ||  || John James Burnet || Lord Allenby and James Parr\n|-\n| Bombay 1914-1918 Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2111731/BOMBAY%201914-1918%20MEMORIAL,%20MUMBAI CWGC]\n| picture || India || Mumbai ||  || 2,206 || Indian, Adenese and East African sailors and Royal Indian Marine || entire war || naval campaigns and transport || not specified || not specified || not specified\n|-\n| Doiran Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/160000/DOIRAN%20MEMORIAL CWGC]\n|  || Greece || Doirani ||  || 2,171 || British Salonika Force || October 1915 to November 1918 || Salonika Campaign ||  || Robert Lorimer || George Macdonogh\n|-\n| Hollybrook Memorial\n[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/142019/HOLLYBROOK%20MEMORIAL,%20SOUTHAMPTON CWGC]\n| picture || United Kingdom || Southampton ||  || 1,897 || Land and air forces lost at sea || entire war || SS Mendi and other ships ||  || T.
