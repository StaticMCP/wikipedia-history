St. John's Church is the state's third-oldest Catholic church.\nHistory\nIn 1826 the congregation held its first meeting in the basement of Charles Durning's home. Construction of the current building began in 1827. Later renovations and additions took place throughout the 19th and 20th centuries and incorporated the original structure's walls. When the church was first built, it was the only Catholic church in northern New Jersey and was originally part of the Diocese of New York.  The church currently runs a soup kitchen, women's shelter, and art gallery for children. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nJohn Church Newark 1826 Parish jeh.jpg|School\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, New Jersey\nReferences"
