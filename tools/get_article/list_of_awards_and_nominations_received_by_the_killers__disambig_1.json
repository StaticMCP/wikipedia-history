After forming in late 2001 when Dave Keuning's advertisement in a music paper was answered by Brandon Flowers, Mark Stoermer and Ronnie Vannucci Jr., a Warner Bros. employee recommended them to Lizard King Records, who signed them. The band consequently went to England to record their 2004 debut album Hot Fuss, which earned them five nominations at the Grammy Awards and has sold over 5,000,000 copies.\nTheir second album, ''Sam's Town'' earned the band the BRIT Awards Best International Album at the 2007 BRIT Awards and two nominations at the Grammy Awards. The band's third studio album, Day & Age, was nominated for Best International Album at the BRIT Awards and was twice nominated at the 2009 NME Awards where the group won Best International Band. The fourth studio album, Battle Born, was released concurrent to the band winning its fourth NME Award for Best International Band.
