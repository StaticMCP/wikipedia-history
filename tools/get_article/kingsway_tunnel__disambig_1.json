It was built because the existing Queensway Tunnel was unable to cope with the rise in postwar traffic. The  tunnel carries the A59. Locally, it is often referred to as the \"new tunnel\", to distinguish it from the older Queensway Tunnel (1934), which serves Birkenhead and carries public transport services.\nHistory\nAnnual vehicle usage of the Queensway Tunnel had exceeded 11 million by 1959, causing severe traffic congestion at peak commute times, partially as a result of low toll costs. It was evident that a significant capacity increase was required, with considerations on various bridge and tunnel schemes ultimately concluding with a second tunnel as the favoured option, funded by tolls. In 1965, parliamentary powers granted construction of a new two-lane tunnel, approximately 1 mile downstream from the existing tunnel. A further bill for the tunnel's construction was promoted in 1967 with approval given in 1968, upon which construction started immediately.\nConstruction\n| repealing_legislation =\n| related_legislation   =\n| status                = amended\n| legislation_history   =\n| theyworkforyou        =\n| millbankhansard       =\n| original_text         = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1965/40/pdfs/ukla_19650040_en.pdf\n| revised_text          =\n| use_new_UK-LEG        =\n| UK-LEG_title          =\n| collapsed             = yes\n}}\n| repealing_legislation =\n| related_legislation   =\n| status                = amended\n| legislation_history   =\n| theyworkforyou        =\n| millbankhansard       =\n| original_text         = https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1968/12/pdfs/ukla_19680012_en.pdf\n| revised_text          =\n| use_new_UK-LEG        =\n| UK-LEG_title          =\n| collapsed             = yes\n}}\nThe project was authorised by the Mersey Tunnel (Liverpool/Wallasey) &c. Act 1965 (c. xl). Edmund Nuttall Limited. Construction took around five years to fully complete. The approach to the tunnel on the Wirral side uses the former railway cutting that carried the Seacombe branch line. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 June 1971. At first, only the southernmost tunnel was open for traffic, one lane in each direction. The northernmost tunnel was completed in 1974 and opened to traffic on 13 February 1974.\nMersey Tunnel 10k\nThere is an annual 10k run that passes through the Kingsway Tunnel, starting in Liverpool city centre with the finish line in New Brighton. This is the only time during the year when one can travel through the tunnel on foot. In 2024, more than 2,000 people registered to take part in the event.\nOperations\nKingsway comprises identical twin tunnels. Each has two  lanes. They carry on average 45,000 vehicles a day (almost 16.4 million per year). , a single car journey through the tunnel cost £2.10. Staffed and automatic tollbooths are located on the Wallasey side. Of the two tunnels crossing the River Mersey, Kingsway is the only one able to take heavy goods vehicles (HGVs).\nIn a study following the fire in the Mont Blanc Tunnel in 1999, inspectors from the European Union rated the Kingsway Tunnel as \"good\", one of fourteen to receive that rating in Europe.\nOver  of wiring was installed in the tunnel as part of a 2016 upgrade to the lighting, which saw the tunnel fitted with more energy efficient and longer-lasting LED lights.\nSee also\n* Mersey Tunnels Police\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
