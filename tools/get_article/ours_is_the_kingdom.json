      "text": "# Ours Is the Kingdom\n\nOurs Is the Kingdom is the fourth album by English metal band Forefather. Its title is a play on the line of the Lord's Prayer \"For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory\". The lyrics of the track are a statement against Christianity and a defiant will to reclaim the English kingdom from an alien God. The cover art depicts a dead crusader warrior, an image meant to symbolize Christian decay.\n\"Our hearts lie not in heaven,\nNor Eastern desert sands.\"\nTrack listing\n#\"The Shield-Wall\" – 4:10\n#\"Ours Is the Kingdom\" – 4:53\n#\"Proud to be Proud\" – 4:54\n#\"The Golden Dragon\" – 5:26\n#\"Smashed by Fate\" – 4:25\n#\"The Sea-Kings\" – 4:28\n#\"To the Mountains They Fled\" – 4:37\n#\"The Folk That Time Forgot\" – 4:55\n#\"Threads of Time\" – 6:18\n#\"Keep Marching On\" – 6:01\n#\"Rebel of the Marshlands\" – 4:03\n#\"Wudugast\" – 6:24\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Ours is the Kingdom\n\n#REDIRECT Ours Is the Kingdom"
