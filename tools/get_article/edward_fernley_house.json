A one-story rear extension dates from around 1890.\nIt was deemed \"architecturally significant for several reasons. First, it remains a well preserved example\nw of upper-middle class domestic architecture from Beaver's principal years of\nx growth, c. 1875–1900. Second, its central passageway plan documents one of\nseveral important dwelling types found in 19th century Utah. Finally, the\nlarge central cross gable with flanking wall dormers house design is unique to\nthe Beaver-Iron County area of Utah, a design which perhaps can be traced to\nthe work of the Beaver builder-architect, Thomas Frazer.\nReferences"
