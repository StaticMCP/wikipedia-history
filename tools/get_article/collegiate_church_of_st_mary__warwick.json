It is in the centre of the town just east of the market place. It is Grade I listed, and a member of the Major Churches Network.\nThe church has the status of collegiate church as it had a college of secular canons. In governance and religious observance it was similar to a cathedral (although not the seat of a bishop and without diocesan responsibilities). There is a Bishop of Warwick, but this is an\nepiscopal title used by a suffragan bishop of the Diocese of Coventry.\nHistory\nFoundation and early years\nThe church foundations date back nine hundred years, being created by Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick, in 1123. In addition to founding the church, de Beaumont established the college of dean and canons at the church. The only surviving part of the Norman church which de\nBeaumont had built is the crypt.\nThe chancel vestries and chapter house of the church were extensively rebuilt in the 14th century by a later Earl of Warwick, Thomas de Beauchamp (died 1369, later pronounced Beecham), in the Perpendicular Gothic style. Between  1370 and 1394, the chancel, transept, nave and aisles were rebuilt, then forming a basilica with wooden roofs. Thomas Beauchamp's descendants built the Chapel of Our Lady, commonly known as the Beauchamp Chapel. It contains the effigial monuments of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Buried in the chancel of the church is William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, the brother of queen consort Catherine Parr.\nSixteenth century onwards\nThe college was dissolved in 1546, and the church was granted by the Crown to the burgesses of Warwick. Before their destruction in the Civil War, Wenceslaus Hollar copied many of the stained glass windows in the Beauchamp Chapel, showing heraldry of the Beauchamp family.\nThe church, along with much of Warwick, was devastated by the Great Fire of Warwick in 1693. The nave and tower of the building were completely destroyed. In 1704, the rebuilt church was completed in a Gothic design by William Wilson\n(appointed by the Crown Commissioners). Sir Christopher Wren is also said to have contributed to the design, but that is disputed. The tower rises to the height of . The design was described by John Summerson as being \"as remarkable for its success as for its independence in style from other seventeenth-century English Gothic\".\nThe church has been undergoing significant maintenance for renovation since early 2023 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2023. At a cost of 1.4 million, the renovation was planned after a piece of masonry fell from the church's tower.\nDeans of the College\n*Robert Plesset, 1282\n*Thomas de Sodynton, 1290\n*William de Apperley, 1297\n*Robert Tankard, 1306\n*Richard de Alcester, 1313\n*Robert de Geryn, 1314\n*Robert de Lee, 1321\n*Thomas Lench, 1338\n*Robert de Endredeby, 1340\n*Nicholas Southam, 1361\n*Thomas Yonge, 1395\n*John Porter, 1432\n*Robert Cherbury, 1443\n*William Berkswell, 14\n*John Southwell, 1469\n*Edmund Albone, M.D., 1481\n*Richard Brackenburgh, 1485\n*William Stokedale, 1498\n*Edward Haseley, 1498\n*Ralph Colingwode, 1507\n*John Allestre, 1510\n*John Carvanell, 1515\n*John Knightley, 1542\nMusic\nOrgans\nThere are two organs in St. Mary's, the transept organ and one at the west end. The specifications of both organs can be found on the National Pipe\nOrgan Register.\nThe Transept Organ has been rebuilt several times since the 19th century.\nThe West End Organ is described as having been built in 1980. The NPOR does not give a date for the organ case with its gilt diapasons, which appears to predate the instrument itself.\nOrganists (prior to 1976)\n*William Witteney 1409\n*John Soursby 1432\n*John Skyrrowe 1562\n*Richard Charpe 1565\n*Thomas Dean 1719\n*William Dean 1744\n*Jonathan Hobbs 1773\n*Mary Hobbs 1787\n*Mrs R.

The Cambridge Quarters chime on the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 9th bells, and the hour strikes on the 10th. The clock movement is fixed in the ringing chamber in a glass-fronted case, the connection to the four dials at the higher level being by rods, level wheels, and universal joints, and there are small dials on the movement showing the time indicated by the outside hands. The clock is controlled by Lord Grimthorpe’s double three-legged gravity escapement, and the compensated pendulum was designed to provide less variation than two seconds each week. The hands of the clock are made of copper, gilded and counterposed inside the tower by adjustable balances. The clock was set going on 21 June 1902 by the Countess of Warwick.\nImage gallery\nFile:Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick.jpg|The tower in 2016\nImage:St Mary Warwick 3.jpg|From Northgate Street\nImage:St. Mary's Church Beauchamp Chapel.jpg|Beauchamp Chapel\nImage:Beauchamp Chapel 2.jpg|Beauchamp Chapel west wall\nImage:St. Mary's Church Nave Altar.jpg|Church Nave Altar\nImage:St. Mary's Church Crypts.jpg|The Crypt\nFile:Deans Chapel.jpg|Dean's Chapel\nImage:St Mary Warwick 1.jpg|Interior looking east\nImage:St Mary Warwick 2.jpg|Interior looking west\nImage:The Beauchamp chapel Warwick Collegiate Church.jpg|The view from within the Beauchamp Chapel\nImage:Entrance to the Beauchamp Chapel at St Mary's.jpg|The entrance to the Beauchamp family chapel in St Mary's\nFile:Ambrose Dudley 01 Warwick St Marys.JPG|Effigy of Ambrose Dudley on his tomb in the Beauchamp Chapel\nFile:Ambrose Dudley bear Warwick St Marys.JPG|Bear at feet of Ambrose Dudley on his tomb\nFile:Robert Dudley Lettice Knollys 01 Warwick St Marys.JPG|Effigies of Robert Dudley and Lettice Knollys on their tomb in the Beauchamp Chapel\nFile:Lettice Knollys 01 Warwick St Marys.JPG|Effigy of Lettice Knollys.\nFile:Dudley Knollys tomb lion Warwick St Marys.JPG|Lion rampant queue-fourché, emblem of the Dudley family, on the Dudley/Knollys tomb\nFile:Dudley Knollys tomb inscription Warwick St Marys.JPG|Inscription on rear panel of tomb of Robert Dudley and Lettice Knollys\nFile:Dudley Knollys tomb coat of arms Warwick St Marys.JPG|Coat of Arms of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester\nFile:Dudley Knollys tomb bear Warwick St Marys.JPG|Bear and ragged staff, emblem of the earls, city and county of Warwick.
