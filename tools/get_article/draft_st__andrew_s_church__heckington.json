The Anglican Parish church measures 164 feet long and 180 feet tall at the spire. It is perhaps best known for its Easter Sepulchre, intricate window tracery, and exterior carvings.\nSt. Andrew's church is made of Ancaster stone and features a clerestoried nave, aisles, and transepts. Window decoration varies throughout the church, mixing reticulated tracery with trefoils and quatrefoils.\nHistory\nSt. Andrew's is thought to have been built on the site of a previous church present in the Norman period but perhaps built earlier. The current church, dedicated to Saint Andrew, was founded in the early 14th century by Richard de Potesgrave, rector of the church and a Chaplain to King Edward II and later to King Edward III. King Edward II also appointed Henry de Beaumont to oversee the Heckington area and the construction of the church alongside Potesgrave. In 1345, the Church was acquired by Bardney Abbey.\nStained Glass\nWhile much has been replaced over the centuries, some medieval stained glass from the time of construction survives. According to Dr. Jim Cheshire of the University of Lincoln, only about 5% of authentic medieval stained glass has survived to the present day. Some of the original stained glass is known to have featured the Beaumont family coat of arms, referencing one of the two main construction overseers.\nReferences"
