The legitimacy of the Provisional Government has been recognised and succeeded by South Korea in the latter's original Constitution of 1948 and the current Constitution of 1988. Nine people have served twenty-four terms as heads of state (with varying titles) of the Provisional Government between September 1919 and August 1948.\nList of heads of state of the Provisional Government\nHeads of governments proclaimed after the March 1st Movement (1919)\nFollowing the March 1st Movement with the Declaration of Independence, several groups within Korea and the Korean diaspora proclaimed the establishment of republican governments, claiming to be the representation of the Korean people. Three of these proclaimed governments remained active in the months thereafter and amalgamated to form the unified Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.\nFour other governments were proclaimed in the aftermaths of the March 1st Movement but these did not have significant activity following the proclamation.\n* The Provisional Government of the Republic of Chosun (조선민국임시정부) proclaimed in Seoul on 19 April 1919: President (정도령) Son Byong-hi\n* The Government of the Republic of New Korea (신한민국정부) proclaimed in Northwestern Korea including Pyongyang on 17 April 1919: Consul (집정관) Lee Dong-hwi\n* The Government of the Korean Republic (고려공화국정부) proclaimed in Manchuria in early 1919\n* The Provisional Government in Gando (간도임시정부) proclaimed in Jilin in early 1919\nThere was a further plan to proclaim The Korean Civil Government (대한민간정부) on 1 April 1919 with Son Byong-hi as the President (대통령) in the anticipation of the success of the March 1st Movement; the planned proclamation was not distributed.\nConsul-President of the Great Korean Republic (Seoul Government)\nThe Great Korean Republic (대조선공화국) was proclaimed in Seoul on April 23, 1919, by 24 representatives gathered from 13 provinces of Korea. It is commonly known as the Seoul Government (한성정부). Syngman Rhee was elected by the assembled representatives as the Consul-President (집정관총재). Rhee sent letters to foreign heads of state including those of the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom notifying these countries of the proclamation of the Republic and his election as the President. It was agreed at the time of the amalgamation with the Governments of Shanghai and Vladivostok that the new unified Provisional Government is the successor government of the legitimacy of the Seoul Government.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n!align=left width=10 |\n!width=100 |Portrait\n!width=200 |Name\n!align=center colspan=2 width=40% |Term of Office\n!align=left width=30% |Deputy\n|-\n|align=center rowspan=2 |\n|align=center rowspan=2 |\n|align=center rowspan=2 |Rhee Syngman이승만\n|1919\n|1919\n|align=left | Premier-President Lee Dong-hwi\n|-\n|colspan=3 |\n|}\nPrime Ministers of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (Shanghai Government)\nThe Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (대한민국 임시정부) was established in Shanghai on 11 April 1919 as a result of the first meeting of the Provisional Assembly from the previous night (10 April 1919).
