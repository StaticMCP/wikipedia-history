Begun in the 1960s and the first volume published in 1975, the series was intended to supplant Emil Hübner's Monumenta Linguae Ibericae (1893). The volumes are largely the editorial work of Jürgen Untermann (1928–2013). The sixth volume, published in 2018, was edited posthumously from Untermann's notes. The series was completed in 2019 with the publication of a lexicon of the Iberian language.\nVolumes\n*  — Monetary legends\n* — Iberian language inscriptions of southern France\n* — Iberian language inscriptions of Spain\n** Band III.1: Literaturverzeichnis, Einleitung. — Bibliography and introduction\n** Band III.2: Die Inschriften. — Inscriptions\n*  — Tartessian, Celtiberian, and Lusitanian language inscriptions\n* — Glossary of the Celtiberian language\n* — Glossary of the Iberian language\n* — Toponymy of ancient Hispania\nReferences"
