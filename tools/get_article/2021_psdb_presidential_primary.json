In 2018, PSDB had its worst presidential election result ever, getting only 5% of the votes and losing only half of their deputies. In the runoff, PSDB declared neutrality and elected 3 governors, their smallest amount since 1990.\nBolsonaro's Administration\nIn 2019, PSDB declared itself to be an independent party, criticizing the more authoritarian agenda of Bolsonaro but endorsing most of the economic agenda. They were important for the passing of the pension reform.\nIn 2020, Jair Bolsonaro nominated Rogério Marinho, a PSDB politician, as Minister of Regional Development. While PSDB was initially supportive of the nomination, Rogério Marinho later had to leave the party due to PSDB wanting to distance themselves from Bolsonaro.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, PSDB became more overtly against Bolsonaro. João Doria, governor of São Paulo, and Eduardo Leite, governor of Rio Grande do Sul, ordered social distancing and lockdown. João Doria notoriously bought CoronaVac and São Paulo became the first state to start the vaccination.\nIn 2021, due to the democratic backsliding in Brazil, PSDB voted to become an opposition party and to open impeachment procedures against Bolsonaro. João Doria tried to be elected party president and become the presumptive PSDB candidate, but after criticism of power-grabbing, it was decided that PSDB would have a primary to elect its presidential candidate.\nElectoral system\nFor the 2021 presidential primary, PSDB decided to adopt a system where voters being part of different electoral colleges depending on their party position. There are 4 electoral colleges each with equal value:\n1- Registered members without elected position;\n2- Mayors and deputy mayors;\n3- City councilors and state deputies;\n4- Governors, Vice Governors, Senators, federal deputies and members of the National Executive;\nIf a candidate gets more than 50% of the votes in the first round, he wins, but if no candidate, there is a runoff election between the two most voted candidates.\nDoria proposed a universal system that every registered member had equal vote, but the PSDB executive rejected the proposal.\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PSDB primary candidates\n!Candidate\n!Born\n!Experience\n!State\n|-\n!\nJoão Doria\n| (age )\nSão Paulo, São Paulo\n|Governor of São Paulo (2019-2022)\nMayor of São Paulo (2017-2018)\nPresident of Embratur (1986-1988)\nSecretary of Tourism of São Paulo (1983-1986)\n|\nSão Paulo\n|-\n!\nEduardo Leite\n| (age )\nPelotas, Rio Grande do Sul\n|Governor of Rio Grande do Sul (2019-present)\nMayor of Pelotas (2013-2016)\nPresident of the City Council of Pelotas (2011-2013)\nCity Councillor of Pelotas (2009-2013)\n|\nRio Grande do Sul\n|-\n!\nTasso Jereissati\n| (age )\nFortaleza, Ceará\n|Senator from Ceará (2003-2011; 2015-2023)\nPresident of PSDB (1991-1994; 2005-2007)\nGovernor of Ceará (1987-1991; 1995-2002)\n|\nCeará\n|-\n!\nArthur Virgílio Neto\n| (age )\nManaus, Amazonas\n|Mayor of Manaus (1989-1993; 2013-2020)\nSenator from Amazonas (2003-2011)\nSecretary-General of the Presidency (2001-2002)\nFederal deputy from Amazonas (1983-1987; 1995-2003)\n|\nAmazonas\n|}\nCampaign\nJoão Doria\nJoão Doria announced his presidential campaign in June 15.\nIn the campaign declared support of the privatization of Petrobras and Banco do Brasil, but came out against the privatization of Caixa Econômica Federal.
