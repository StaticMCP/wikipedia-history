In the , the locality of Gregory had a population of 122 people.\nGeography\nThe town is situated on the banks of the perennial Gregory River. The Gregory River was named by explorer William Landsborough on 19 November 1861, after explorer Augustus Charles Gregory, the first Surveyor General of Queensland.\nGregory Downs is a pastoral station which breeds cattle on  of native grazing land. It carries approximately 30,000 Brahman cattle, a breed suitable for the Gulf Country. It has an  frontage to the Gregory River. It was one of the first pastoral stations established in the Gulf Country.\nHistory\nGregory Post Office opened on 2 May 1878 and closed in 1894.\nThe Gregory Downs pastoral station was established in 1876 by the Watson brothers (Harry F. Watson, Sidney Grandison Watson and Robert McGregor Watson)  who travelled overland with approximately 900 cattle. They liked the clear running water in the Gregory River and settled at a crossing point of the river with their cattle on the western bank and their homestead on the eastern bank. In the late 1800s they built the Gregory Downs Hotel and Store near the homestead (), but eventually decided that they found the travellers too much of a nuisance and so they relocated their homestead onto the western bank of the river (). There was a coach service from the hotel to Burketown. The hotel also served as a post for the mounted police.\nThe town had a population of 40 people in 2008.\nIn 2013, the town was renamed from Gregory Downs to Gregory.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Gregory had a population of 72 people.\nIn the , the locality of Gregory had a population of 122 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Gregory.
