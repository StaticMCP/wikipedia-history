The three footballers were deported after being held by the Cyprus police for several days. They left Sierra Leone to have professional football trials with a Russian football club, through the help of former Cameroon goalkeeper and former African footballer of the year, Thomas N'kono. But Kanu and the three others failed to impress, and were headed back to Freetown  when they received a called from a Cypriot national named Appolous who claimed he could find them a club. Unfortunately on their arrival in Cyprus Appolous did not meet them, and instead they were met by immigration officers in Cyprus.\nInternational\nKanu played in all seven games for the Sierra Leone National Team during the 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. He played 90 minutes in Sierra Leone's victory over South Africa in Freetown.\nPersonal\nKanu enjoys watching the NBA. His favorite movie is Full Metal Jacket; his  favorite musician is Bob Marley .
