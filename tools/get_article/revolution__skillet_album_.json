It was released on November 1, 2024, through the band's label Hear It Loud Records. It is the first Skillet album to be released independently.\nRegarding the title and theme, Skillet frontman John Cooper explained, \"the revolution we're talking about on this record is not a political revolution, [and] it is certainly not a militaristic one, which I've never supported. It's a revolution for love. It's a revolution to love your enemies\". and .}} On the album cover, the band flag Cooper holds has \"1 COR 13:13\" printed in the lower-right corner, referring to the First Letter of Paul to the Corinthians. The verse reads, \"But now faith, hope, love, abide these three; but the greatest of these is love.\" (NASB1995) Revolution is the shortest Skillet album to date.\nSingles\nThe first single for the album, \"Unpopular\", was released with an accompanying music video on August 9, 2024. Designed with \"tongue-in-cheek\" lyrics, Cooper stated the song is \"saying the world's gone so nuts that the things the world loves are so disgusting and so crazy—like, in a world gone mad, would you really want to be popular? That's kind of the joke of the song.\"\nThe third and last single for the album, \"Ash in the Wind\", was released on October 18, 2024. Cooper mentioned that \"'Ash in the Wind' reminds us of a mix of old Skillet and Linkin Park, which I’m a huge fan of. Korey produced it, and it definitely merges live performance with modern recording techniques.\"\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Jesus Freak Hideout\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Blabbermouth.net\n| rev3score = 8/10\n}}\nThe album received mixed reviews from critics. Alex Caldwell at Jesus Freak Hideout rated the album 2 out of 5 stars and said: \"Revolution finds the group treading water musically and thematically at best and pandering to an unknown demographic at worst with a few questionable theological lyrics and pseudo-political ramblings that (at times) sound just generic enough to be considered revolutionary by any side that wants to claim them.\" Anne Erickson at Blabbermouth.net rated the album 8 out of 10 and stated: \"Skillet certainly keep with their usual formula on Revolution, but the album still has a new life and should be exactly what fans want in a new Skillet set.\"\n| title1        = Showtime\n| length1       = 3:34\n| writer1       = Cooper, Seth Mosley\n| title2        = Unpopular\n| length2       = 3:05\n| writer2       =\n| title3        = All That Matters\n| length3       = 3:28\n| writer3       = John Cooper & Brian Howes\n| title4        = Not Afraid\n| length4       = 3:14\n| writer4       =\n| title5        = Revolution\n| length5       = 3:06\n| writer5       = Cooper, YOUTHYEAR, Carlo Colasacco\n| title6        = Ash in the Wind\n| length6       = 3:52\n| writer6       =\n| title7        = Fire Inside of Me\n| length7       = 3:53\n| writer7       =\n| title8        = Defector\n| length8       = 3:20\n| writer8       =\n| title9        = Happy Wedding Day (Alex's Song)\n| length9       = 3:58\n| writer9       = Cooper\n| title10       = Death Defier\n| length10      = 3:38\n| writer10      =\n| total_length  = 35:01\n}}\nPersonnel\nSkillet\n* John Cooper – lead vocals, bass, acoustic guitar\n* Korey Cooper – rhythm guitar, keyboards, programming, string arranger, synthesizer\n* Seth Morrison – lead guitar\n* Jen Ledger – drums, vocals, backing vocals\nAdditional personnel\n* Seth Mosley – additional guitar, additional vocals, keyboards, programming (1, 2, 8, 9, 10)\n* Chris Marvin – additional vocals (1, 5, 6, 10)\n* Brian Howes – additional vocals, additional guitar (3, 4, 7)\n* Youthyear –  keyboards, programming (5)\n* Carlo Colasacco – additional keyboards, programming (5)\n* Cara Fox – cello (9)\n* Eleanore Denis – violin (9)\n* Robin Diaz – percussion, additional vocals (3, 4, 7)\nProduction\n* Brian Howes – production (3, 4, 7)\n* Seth Mosley – production, audio engineer (1, 2, 8, 9, 10)\n* Korey Cooper – production, audio engineer (6, 9)\n* Youthyear – production, audio engineer (5)\n* Carlo Colasacco – production, audio engineer (5)\n* Chris Lord-Alge – mixing (3, 4, 7)\n* Neal Avron – mixing (1, 2, 8, 9, 10)\n* Scott Skrzynski – assistant mixing (1, 2, 8, 9, 10)\n* Nick Radovanovic – mixing, audio engineer (6), digital editing (all tracks except; 3, 4, 7)\n* Ted Jensen – mastering\n* Steven Servi – digital editing (all tracks except; 3, 4, 7)\n* Ethan Radtke – audio engineer (6)\n* Grayson Smith –assistant mixing (3, 4, 7)\n* Karl Dicaire – audio engineer, digital editing (3, 4, 7)\n* Brian Judd – assistant mixing (3, 4, 7)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Revolution\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Rock & Alternative Albums (Billboard)\n| 19\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
