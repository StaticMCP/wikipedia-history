The rest of the ward to the east consists of grassland and woodland.  The electoral ward is coterminous with the Port Talbot community boundaries.\nPort Talbot is bounded by the wards of Baglan and Bryn and Cwmavon to the north; Taibach and Margam to the south; and Aberavon to the west and is in the Senedd constituency of Aberavon and the UK constituency of Aberafan Maesteg.\nLocal council elections\n2022\nThe election scheduled for 5 May 2022 was delayed until 23 June in the Port Talbot ward, following the death of Independent candidate Andrew Tutton during the campaign. The two seats were eventually won by the Labour Party, re-electing Saifur Rahaman with 914 votes and Sharon Freeguard with 898 votes.\n2017\nIt was announced that for the 2017 Local Council Elections only three nominations were received in the ward. These were the current councillors Dennis Keogh, Saifur Rahaman and Sharon Freegaurd.

The results were: Cllr Rahaman became Neath Port Talbot's first Asian councillor.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!|Candidate\n!|Party\n!|Votes\n!|Status\n|-\n||Ian James ||Labour||831||Labour hold\n|-\n||Dennis Keogh ||Labour||782||Labour hold\n|-\n||Saifur Rahaman ||Labour||707||Labour gain\n|-\n||Andrew Tutton ||NPT Independent Party||592||\n|-\n||Marge Jones ||NPT Independent Party||528||\n|-\n||Stephen Griffiths ||NPT Independent Party||479||\n|-\n||Keith Miller ||Conservative||107||\n|}\nReferences"
