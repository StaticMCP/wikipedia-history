During the pursuit, he was joined by his foster brother Imai Kanehira and Tomoe Gozen.\nDuring the battle, they fought valiantly, holding off Noriyori's large force of thousands of men for a time. However, in the end, they both died in battle.\nYoshinaka was struck dead by a stray arrow when his horse became mired in a paddy field.  Kanehira committed suicide by leaping off his horse while holding his sword in his mouth.\nGallery\nFile:Toyoharu Awazu.jpg|Woodblock print of the battle of Awazu, by Utagawa Toyoharu, ca. 1760s.
