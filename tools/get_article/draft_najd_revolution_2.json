The revolution represented both resistance against Ottoman occupation and internal power struggles, as some local rulers sought to maintain Ottoman authority while others fought for independence. The movement was ultimately led by Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud, a grandson of Muhammad bin Saud, the founder of the first Saudi state.\nBackground\nFollowing the Wahhabi expansion into the Hijaz, the Wahhabi War commenced, resulting in the defeat of Saudi forces and the subsequent capture of their capital, Diriyah, by Ibrahim Pasha, son of Muhammad Ali Pasha. Members of the Al Saud dynasty were compelled to flee and conceal themselves from pursuing Egyptian troops. Following Diriyah's occupation, Ibrahim Pasha established regional princes to administer Najd, though these appointments led to internal conflicts as various factions competed for dominance.\nRebellion\nRise of Ibn Mu'ammar\nIbrahim Pasha left Najd in ruins and suffering from famine before returning to Egypt. Following his departure, Muhammad bin Mishari bin Muammar traveled from Uyayna to the destroyed city of Diriyah and began its reconstruction. Many former residents who had fled during Ibrahim Pasha's campaign returned, and Ibn Muammar established Diriyah as the capital of his emirate. His territory expanded to include Al-Kharj, Riyadh, Huraymila, and Al-Washm.\nIbn Muammar governed much of Najd under Ottoman suzerainty until the appearance of Mishari bin Saud Al Saud, brother of Abdullah bin Saud. Having escaped captivity near Yanbu, Mishari hid in Al Washm, gathered Al Saud loyalists from Al Qassim and Az Zulfi, and marched on Diriyah. Though Ibn Muammar initially swore allegiance, he later reconsidered and mobilized forces in Sadus with support from Huraymila's leaders. With additional backing from Mutayr tribal leader Faisal bin Watban Al-Duwaish, Ibn Muammar captured Diriyah and imprisoned Mishari bin Saud in Sadus.\nFollowing Mishari's capture, Ibn Muammar advanced on Riyadh where Turki bin Abdullah had taken refuge. Turki fled to Al-Ha'ir in southern Najd, prompting Ibn Mu'ammar to appoint his son Mishari as Riyadh's governor. Meanwhile, Muhammad Ali Pasha dispatched a 400-strong force under Abush Agha to capture Mishari. Learning of Turki bin Abdullah's presence in Dhruma, Ibn Muammar sent his son with 100 soldiers, but Turki defeated and captured them. Turki subsequently gained control of Diriyah and Riyadh, apprehended Ibn Muammar, and upon confirming Mishari's death in captivity, executed both Ibn Muammar and his son.\nSiege of Riyadh\nFaisal bin Watban Al-Duwish and Ghuboush Agha subsequently attempted to besiege Imam Turki bin Abdullah in Riyadh. Turki's forces resisted successfully, forcing the siege's abandonment. In response, Muhammad Ali Pasha ordered all Ottoman forces in Medina to march on Riyadh under Hussein Bey. The Ottoman column reached Riyadh unopposed and besieged Turki in the royal palace. Under cover of darkness, Turki and his supporters escaped to Al-Halwa in southern Najd. The remaining defenders surrendered, with Hussein Bey executing 70 of Turki's supporters and capturing Omar bin Abdulaziz along with his son Abdul Malik.\nArrival of Hassan Bey and Failed Campaigns\nFollowing Hussein Bey's withdrawal, Medina's governor Hassan Pasha dispatched an 800-strong cavalry force under Hassan Bey (Abu Zahir). This contingent ravaged Unaizah, Jabal Shammar, Al-Majma'ah, and Sudair, while attempts to collect zakat from Bedouins provoked widespread opposition across Najd.\nBattle of Al-Ha'ir\nMonths later, Ottoman forces from Riyadh and Manfuha under Ibrahim Kashif (brother of Musa Kashif), accompanied by local emirs Nasser bin Nasser Al-Aydhi and Musa bin Mazrou, attacked the Subaie tribe at Al-Bada' south of Riyadh. The Subaie, led by Sheikh Muhammad bin Daghim Al-Omani, routed the Ottomans, killing over 300 soldiers including Ibrahim Kashif and Nasser Al-Aydi.\nBattle of Majzal\nThe Ottoman garrison at Al Majma'ah, commanded by Musa Kashif, attacked the nearby Sahul tribe but suffered defeat with over 30 soldiers killed, including Kashif. Survivors retreated to Al Majma'ah alongside Unaizah's emir Abdullah Al Jami'i.\nUnayzah Revolution\nResidents of Unaizah revolted against their 600-strong Ottoman garrison led by Muhammad Agha, protesting oppressive taxation and misconduct. After besieging the troops in Al-Safa Palace and killing approximately seventy soldiers, a peace agreement allowed the Ottomans to withdraw, leaving only the Riyadh garrison in Najd.\nReturn of Turki\nFirst Attack on Riyadh\nDuring Ramadan 1823, Turki bin Abdullah returned with 30 men, secured support from Al-Mahmal, Jaljal, and Sudair leaders, and established Arqa as his base. His assault on the 600-strong Ottoman garrisons in Riyadh and Manfuha failed, forcing withdrawal to Arqa where he repelled an Ottoman counterattack.\nSubjugation of Najd\nIn late 1823, Turki advanced from Arqa to capture Dhurma, killing its emir. As conflict fragmented Najd, Turki defeated opposing leaders including Mazid bin Ahmed of Al Majma'ah and Hamad bin Mubarak of Huraymila. The rulers of Zulfi, Al-Ghat, Manikh, Sudair, and Shaqra surrendered without resistance. Manfuha capitulated after negotiations with Emir Ibrahim bin Salamah, who expelled its Ottoman garrison to join Riyadh's forces.\nCapture of Riyadh (1824)\nBy August 1824, Turki mobilized all forces from Manfuha to besiege Riyadh. After initial clashes forced Ottoman troops into the city, a month-long siege ensued. Turki temporarily withdrew when Faisal Al-Dawish reinforced the Ottomans, but resumed the attack after Al-Dawish's departure. Garrison commander Abu Ali Al-Maghribi negotiated safe passage before surrendering, marking the Ottoman withdrawal from Najd.\nAftermath\nWhile the Ottoman Empire focused on the Greek War of Independence, Turki expanded his authority through campaigns in Al-Kharj, Al-Qassim, and Jabal Shammar. By 1828, all Najd recognized his rule. After his son Faisal escaped Egyptian captivity, Turki dispatched him against the Bani Khalid Emirate. The subsequent Battle of Al Subia saw Faisal's forces from the Qahtan, Ajman, and Subay' tribes defeat Emir Majid bin Ariar (allied with Anazah). Majid's death precipitated Al Saud's conquest of Al Ahsa and Qatif.\nReferences"
