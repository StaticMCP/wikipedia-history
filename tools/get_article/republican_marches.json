French government officials estimated that the rallies were attended by up to 3.7 million people nationwide, making them the largest public rallies in French history. By their broad appeal, they were the first mass movement of their kind since 1944, when Paris was liberated from the Germans at the end of World War II.\nIn Paris, due to the expected number of people, three streets were planned for the march from Place de la République to Place de la Nation. It was estimated that between 1.5 and 2 million people marched down and nearby Boulevard Voltaire in Paris. The Paris marches were attended by over 80 world leaders, from both Europe and around the world, including President François Hollande. The presence during the marches of foreign leaders who are accused of not respecting freedom of speech in their own country has been criticised.\nIn other cities in France, more than 300,000 rallied in Lyon, about a quarter of its population. More than 100,000 marched in the streets of Rennes, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Montpellier and Marseille (within two days). Major rallies took place in Montreal, Brussels, Berlin, Amsterdam and Vienna.\nIn an interview prior to the Republican marches, cartoonist Luz, one of the survivors of the Charlie Hebdo attack, described the show of support for the magazine as \"wonderful\", but bemoaned a lack of diversity of views in the public discourse following the attacks, which he said served the purposes of politicians, as well the use of symbols, which he characterised as contrary to the values of the magazine. He noted that, following the attacks, \"La Marseillaise\" had been sung many times by the public, which his dead colleagues would have scorned. Also speaking prior to the marches, Willem, another surviving cartoonist, said that a demonstration in support of free expression would be \"naturally a good thing\", but rejected the support of far-right figures such as Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders: \"We vomit on those who suddenly declare that they are our friends\".\nMain places\nJanuary 10\nFrance\n, and Catholic communities of Albania, in Paris, 11 January 2015]]\n* Nantes: 75,000\n* Marseille: 45,000\n* Strasbourg: 45,000\n* Lille: 35,000–40,000\n* Besançon: 30,000\n* Nice: 30,000\n* Limoges: 30,000\n* Pau: 30,000\n* Orléans: 22,000\n* Agen: 13,000\n* Le Havre: 10,000\n}}\nInternational\n*  Brussels: 3,000\n*  Amsterdam: 18,000 (8 January)\n*  New York City: 2,000\n*  San Francisco: 500\n*  Boston: 1,000\nJanuary 11\nFrance\n* Montpellier: 100,000\n* Clermont-Ferrand: 70,000\n* Saint-Étienne: 70,000\n* Marseille: 65,000\n* Brest: 65,000\n* Nancy: 50,000\n* Strasbourg: 45,000\n* Toulon: 45,000\n* Angers: 45,000\n* Metz: 45,000\n* Aix-en-Provence: 40,000\n* Perpignan: 40,000\n* Tours: 35,000\n* Dijon: 35,000\n* Caen: 33,000\n* Lorient: 30,000\n* Nimes: 30,000\n* Saint-Brieuc: 30,000\n* Reims: 25,000\n* Cherbourg: 25,000\n* Mulhouse: 25,000\n* Quimper: 25,000\n* Angouleme: 20,000\n* Chambery: 20,000\n* Avignon: 20,000\n* Vannes: 20,000\n* Albi: 16,000\n* Alençon: 15,000\n* Bastia: 15,000\n* Bourg en Bresse: 15,000\n* Blois: 15,000\n* Carcassonne: 15,000\n* La Rochelle: 15,000\n* Laval: 15,000\n* Mâcon: 15,000\n* Perigueux: 15,000\n* Poitiers: 15,000\n* Saint-Malo: 15,000\n* Tarbes: 14,000\n* Belfort: 13,000\n* Cognac: 11,000\n* Charleville-Mézières: 12,000\n* Troyes: 12,000\n* Ajaccio: 10,000\n* Cannes: 10,000\n* Bergerac: 10,000\n* Tulle: 10,000\n* Colmar: 10,000\n* Ferney Voltaire: 10,000\n* Libourne: 10,000\n* Dammartin-en-Goële: 10,000\n* Narbonne: 10,000\n}}\nFile:Manif 11 janvier 2015 (2).JPG|Paris\nFile:Dimanche 11 janv 2015 Reims soutien à Charlie 05969.JPG|Reims\nFile:Rassemblement 11 janvier 2015 Dijon Place Darcy.jpg|Dijon\nFile:RennesEstCharlie MarcheDu11Janvier2015 1.jpg|Rennes\nInternational\nBuenos Aires: 1,000\n*  Sydney: 500–1,000\n*  Melbourne:\n*  Vienna: 12,000\n*  Brussels: 20,000\n*  Brasília: 300\n*  Rio de Janeiro: 250\n*  São Paulo: 300\n*  Bujumbura: 300\n*  Montreal:\n*  Ottawa:\n*  Quebec City:\n*  Toronto:\n*  Vancouver:\n*  Larnaca\n*  Pardubice: 100\n*  Helsinki\n*  Tbilisi\n*  Berlin: 18,000\n*  Bonn: 1,500\n*  Düsseldorf\n*  Hanover: 300\n*  Munich: 3,000\n*  Athens: 500\n*  Thessaloniki: 500\n*  Rhodes\n*  Jakarta\n*  Tehran\n*  Cork\n*  Dublin: 4,000\n*  Jerusalem: 1000\n*  Tel Aviv\n*  Bologna\n*  Milan\n*  Pisa\n*  Rome\n*  Venice\n*  Tokyo\n*  Beirut\n*  Luxembourg: 2,000\n*  Valletta: 60\n*  Guadalajara: 200\n*  Oslo: 500\n*  Gaza\n*  Ramallah\n*  Warsaw\n*  Lisbon\n*  Porto\n*  Cluj-Napoca: 500\n*  Moscow\n*  Cape Town\n*  Seoul\n*  Madrid: 500–1,000\n*  Gothenburg\n*  Stockholm: 3,000\n*  Geneva: 500\n*  Lausanne: 2,000\n*  Taipei\n*  Bangkok:500\n*  Pattaya:30\n*  Tunis\n*  Ankara\n*  Istanbul\n*  İzmir\n*  Birmingham\n*  Cambridge\n*  Cardiff: 1,000\n*  Edinburgh\n*  London: 2,000\n*  Kharkiv [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2015/01/10/7054594/ Kharkiv staged a march in memory of victims of the terrorist attack in Paris], Ukrayinska Pravda (10 January 2015) [http://www.sq.com.ua/rus/news/obschestvo/10.01.2015/u_pamyatnika_shevchenko_proshel_miting_s_protestom_protiv_terrorizma_vo_francii/ At the monument to Shevchenko rallied against terrorism in France (photos)], SQ (10 January 2015)\n*  Kyiv\n*  Chicago\n*  New York City\n*  San Francisco: 2,000\n*  Boston: 500\n*  Washington, D.C.: 3,000\n*  Caracas: 200\n*  Ho Chi Minh City\n}}\nFile:Je Suis Charlie -

Sigmundur Davíð was the only Western European head of government not to attend the march; instead Iceland was represented by the deputy head of mission at the Icelandic Embassy in Paris, Nína Björk Jónsdóttir. Sigmundur Davíð's absence was criticized in Iceland, and his office acknowledged that a high-ranking official should have attended the march.\n*  President of the United States Barack Obama did not attend the Paris march, citing the short notice and the logistics of providing the necessary security. The Secret Service said it was not consulted and an agency official acknowledged that the Secret Service had pulled off previous last minute trips. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that they \"should have sent someone with a higher profile\" than United States Ambassador to France Jane Hartley. United States Attorney General Eric Holder and United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas were in Paris for a security summit convened after the shootings, but did not attend the Paris rally. The lack of senior American officials was criticized.\nNational Front controversy\nDuring the organisation march, a controversy arose when Marine Le Pen was told she was not invited in the marches. This is due to the National Front reputation of divisiveness. François Lamy, one of the organisers, said it is not where the National Front should be; it is not where a political party which, for years, has divided French citizens because of their origin or their religion should be. The President closed this political issue declaring that \"every citizen can come...it is not controlled.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
