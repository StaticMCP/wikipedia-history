The first award was presented in 2011 for works published in 2010. Two awards were given, one for long form (40,000 words) and one for short form. Both the author and translator receive a trophy and a cash prize of US$350. The award was supported a number of ways including direct donations from the public, the Speculative Literature Foundation, prominent academics in particular staff at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), home of the Eaton Collection, one of the world’s largest collections of science fiction and fantasy literature. The last award was for 2013, and the award officially closed in October 2014.\nNominees and winners\nBlue Ribbon () = winner\n2011\nThe finalists were announced May 24, 2011.
