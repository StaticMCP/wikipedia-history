Final construction took place in the spring of 1952 with Tony Blake claiming the first official feature win on June 28, 1952.  Blake went on to capture six track championships.\nLawrence Craven began a decade long stretch promoting the facility in 1955, during which he added banking and shortened the track to a quarter-mile.  Multi-time track champion Fred Gibson then took over operations along with his brother Bud.  In 1967, Bud Gibson bought out his brother and also announced jointly with the Watertown Speedway a rule change to allow overhead valve V8 engines and to increase engine displacement from 250 to 310 cubic inches.\nThe facility continued operations with several other promoters, including Fred Gibson's return from 1971-1973, closing after the 1976 season when the property was sold to a neighboring limestone quarry.\nTrack Champions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Modified\n!Late Model\n!Mini Stock\n|-\n|1976\n|Doug  Carlyle\n|Jack  Theoret\n|Ken  Pugh\n|-\n|1975\n|Ovide  Doiron\n|Jack  Theoret\n|John  Kuipers\n|-\n|1974\n|Norm  Davey\n|Dan  Corcoran\n|Denzil  Coughlin\n|-\n|1973\n|Denzil  Billings\n|Danny  Reid\n|Denzil  Coughlin\n|-\n|1972\n|Walter  Pennock\n|\n|Al  Bissette\n|-\n|1971\n|Walter  Pennock\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"20\" |\n|-\n|1970\n|Tony  Blake\n|-\n|1969\n|Tony  Blake\n|-\n|1968\n|Barry  Poitras\n|-\n|1967\n|Fred  Gibson\n|-\n|1966\n|Gary  Reddick\n|-\n|1965\n|Fred  Gibson\n|-\n|1964\n|Tony  Blake\n|-\n|1963\n|Tony  Blake\n|-\n|1962\n|Fred  Gibson\n|-\n|1961\n|Woody  Van Order\n|-\n|1960\n|Tony  Blake\n|-\n|1959\n|Woody  Van Order\n|-\n|1958\n|Woody  Van Order\n|-\n|1957\n|Woody  Van Order\n|-\n|1956\n|Tony  Blake\n|-\n|1955\n|Woody  Van Order\n|-\n|1954\n|\n|-\n|1953\n|Ernie  Lindsay\n|-\n|1952\n|Andy  Rae\n|}\nReferences"
