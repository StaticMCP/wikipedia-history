The Conservative candidate won each election during its 112-year existence.\nHistory\nThe seated was created for the 1885 general election as a county division called Kingston equivalent to the northwest corner of the former two-seat Mid Surrey division. It became a borough constituency for the present purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer at the 1918 general election, when it was formally renamed Kingston-upon-Thames.\nIt was abolished for the 1997 general election. Its territory was then divided between the new constituencies of Kingston and Surbiton and Richmond Park.\nThe constituency's most high-profile MP was the Conservative Norman Lamont, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1990 to 1993.\nBoundaries\n1950–1955: The boroughs of Kingston upon Thames, and Surbiton.\n1955–1983: The boroughs of Kingston upon Thames, and Malden and Coombe.\n1983–1997: The London Borough of Kingston upon Thames wards of Burlington, Cambridge, Canbury, Coombe, Grove, Hill, Malden, Manor, Norbiton, Norbiton Park, St James, and Tudor.\nThe seat since 1950 omitted all southern wards of Kingston upon Thames. These fell into the 1950-established seat of Surbiton, which replicated its own borough that merged with Kingston's borough in 1965.\nMembers of Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election\n!Member\n!Party\n!Senior Frontbench positions\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1885 || Sir John Ellis || Conservative ||none\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1892 || Sir Richard Temple || Conservative ||none\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1895 || Thomas Skewes-Cox || Conservative ||none\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1906 || George Cave || Conservative ||Home Secretary (1916-1919)Later Lord (High) Chancellor\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1918 || John Campbell || Unionist ||none\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1922 || Sir Frederick Penny || Unionist ||none\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1937 b-e || Sir Percy Royds || Conservative ||none\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1945 || John Boyd-Carpenter || Conservative||Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1962-1964)\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n||1972 b-e || Norman Lamont || Conservative\n|Chief Secretary to the Treasury (1989-1990)Chancellor of the Exchequer (1990-1993)\n|-\n|\n|1997\n|colspan=\"2\"| constituency abolished\n|}\nElections\nElections in the 1880s\nElections in the 1890s\nT.
