On 28 March 2025, thousands demonstrated in the capital city, Kathmandu, in favor of restoring the monarchy with the former King Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah as its head.\nBackground\nOn 19 February 2025, a public holiday commemorating the 1951 Revolution, former King Gyanendra Shah delivered a video speech which discussed widespread frustrations with the ruling communist government, remarking that “the people are tired of endless instability and corruption” and urging citizens to “support us for the prosperity and progress of the country.” While he stopped short of explicitly calling for a restoration of the monarchy, his emphasis on unity and sacrifice was interpreted by some as hinting at a possible royal revival. Following this speech, there has been an uptick in pro-monarchy protests and activism.\nSome in Nepal have been frustrated with the current federal republic government. In the past 17 years from the abolition of the monarchy, there have been 13 government formations. The country continues to face challenges of governmental instability, corruption and struggling economy.\nIn the recent years, the popularity of the pro-monarchy sentiments has been increased gradually. According to a nationwide survey conducted by Himalmedia in 2024, suggests that nearly half of the people favour \"the reversal of the country’s secular status and reinstatement of the Hindu state\".\nTimeline\nOn 9 March 2025, thousands of supporters welcomed former King Gyanendra Shah as he arrived at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. A spokesperson for the pro-monarchy Rastriya Prajatantra Party stated the turnout \"shows how frustrated the people are with the present government, and they are in search of an alternative to the present system.\" The arrival of the former King in the city took place amidst of tight security.\nAfter the arrival of the former King Gyanendra Shah at the airport, thousands of supporters descended on the road of the capital city Kathmandu to escort him to his residence. Some estimates range from thousands to over ten thousand demonstrators present, monarchy supporters claimed that their number was around four lakhs (400,000). In the rally at least 1,000 police personnel and 400 traffic police were deployed to maintain law and order. No violence was reported in the rally.\nDuring the rally demonstrators were seen carrying Nepalese flags, and some were seen carrying posters of the chief minister Yogi Adityanath of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The display of the poster of Yogi Adityanath in the rally sparked controversy.\nSome pro-monarchy hacker groups had attacked several domestic websites in support of the protest. A group titled Hacktivist Nepal had defaced the official websites of Nepal's Survey Department (dos.gov.np) and Department of Customs (customs.gov.np), with the defaced pages displaying a photo of King Birendra, the former king of Nepal along with the text \"Raja Aau, Desh Bachau\" (Bring Back the King, Save the Nation) and an attached audio of Nepal's former national anthem Shriman Gambhir. Additionally the website of the District Forest Office of Sunsari was also hacked.\nImpact\nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) suspended its month-long campaign in the Teria-Madhesh region in response to the intensified activities of the pro-monarchy protestors in the capital. The current prime minister K. P. Sharma Oli as well as other top political leaders like Sher Bahadur Deuba have condemned and criticized the pro-monarchy movement. They have also challenged the former king Gyanendra Shah to take part in election and prove his popularity in the established democratic system of the nation.\nAfter the pro-monarchy demonstrations in the capital, the Kathmandu district administration office enforced a two-month prohibitory order in the key areas of the government. According to the order, public gatherings of more than five persons has been banned including hunger strikes, demonstrations, protests and rallies.\nOn 11 March 2025, the topic of the pro-monarchy movement in the capital was discussed at the House of Representatives.

Nabaraj Subedi was made the leader of the committee. The prime demand of the organization is the acceptance of the 1991 constitution by the government or amendments in the current constitution to feature a constitutional monarchy with a multi-party system of parliamentary democracy and recognition of Nepal as a unitary Hindu nation. The committee told the government they had one week to meet their demands.\n| image                    = राजा बादी मोर्चा घोषणा.png\n| caption                  = Monarchist leaders declaring for pro-monarchy movement in a press meet in Kathmandu\n| founder                  = Nabaraj Subedi,Durga Prasai\n| founding_location        = Kathmandu\n| purpose                  = Restoration of the constitutional Hindu monarchy in Nepal\n| headquarters             = Kathmandu\n| leader_title             = Convener\n| leader_name              = Nabaraj Subedi\n| leader_title2            = Secretary\n| leader_name2             = Rabindra Mishra\n}}\n28 March 2025 in Kathmandu\nOn 28 March 2025, the groups Joint People's Movement Committee and Socialist Forum separately organized public demonstrations to counter each other, and to demonstrate in the favor of restoration of the constitutional Hindu monarchy and to maintain the present federal republic system, respectively.
