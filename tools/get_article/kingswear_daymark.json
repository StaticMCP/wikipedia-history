It is octagonal and sharply battered with a truncated open top, and has a tall narrow pointed head arch on each side, forming eight stilted pillars.\nConstruction\nIn 1863, Charles Seale Hayne, owner of Brownstone at that time, became a founder member of the Dartmouth Harbour Commission whose main aim was to improve access and facilities to Dartmouth harbour. The following year, Seale Hayne leased land for the erection of this tower as a day beacon.\nSee also\n*Landmark\nReferences"
