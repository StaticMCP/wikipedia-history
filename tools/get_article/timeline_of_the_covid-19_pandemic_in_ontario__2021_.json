In response to the continued surge, the province announced that the Provincewide Shutdown would be extended in northern Ontario for an additional 14 days (aligned with the length of Provincewide Shutdown in the south), and that elementary schools in the south will not return to in-person class until January 25.\nOn January 8, Ontario again recorded a new record high of new infections with 4,249 new cases. Premier Doug Ford hinted at furthering restrictions on top of the already in place Provincewide shutdown.\nDue to the surge of new infections, Premier Ford issued a second declaration of emergency on January 12. Additional stay-at-home orders were announced, including the reduction of outdoor gatherings to five people, and a reduction of hours for non-essential businesses allowed to only operate between 7:00&nbsp;a.m. and 8&nbsp;p.m. These new restrictions begin on January 14. Also, students in Toronto, Peel, York, Hamilton, and Windsor-Essex will not return to in-person classes until February 10, 2021.\nResults of an inspection \"blitz\" over the weekend of January 15 on big-box stores revealed a compliance rate of 70 percent with 36 of 110 stores visited at random in violation of COVID-19 protocols.\nOn January 15, all LTC home residents and staff in Toronto had received at least first doses of the vaccine and on January 19, all LTC home residents and staff in COVID-19 hot spots had received at least first doses of the vaccine, ahead of the January 21 goal date set by the provincial vaccine taskforce.\nDue to manufacturing delays, it was also announced on January 19 that no new shipments of the Pfizer vaccine would be arriving in Ontario the following week, delaying first and second dose administration in the government's overall vaccination program.\nOn January 28, Peel Region's Medical Officer Lawrence Loh suggested that all online retail operating in the province be restricted from selling non-essential goods, in order to protect supply chains due to workplace outbreaks.\nOn January 29, 2021, the federal government announced new travel restrictions, including that individuals travelling on foreign flights would be required to take COVID-19 PCR test on arrival and quarantine in an approved hotel at their expense.\nFebruary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=3 | Hospitalizations\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

The order was first lifted on February 10 in Eastern Ontario's Hastings Prince Edward Public Health Unit, the Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Health Unit, and the Renfrew County and District Health Unit. The stay-at-home order is expected to be lifted in most of Ontario on February 16, excluding Peel, Toronto, and York, and any other area where the province believes it is not yet safe to lift the order. The stay-at-home order is expected to be lifted in Peel, Toronto, and York on February 22. The response framework will also allow non-essential retail to operate with a 25 percent capacity limit if a region is under the grey \"Lockdown\" tier.\nOn February 11, the Ontario government announced March Break would be postponed for a month, to the week of April 12 and renamed Spring Break. Also on the same day, the Minister of Health admitted that the province had not met its deadline to vaccinate all long-term care homes, after mistakenly announcing that it had.\nOn February 26, Health Canada approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine for use.\nMarch\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=1 | Active\n! colspan=3 | Hospitalizations\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

All regions were moved to a new sixth level of the response framework, \"Shutdown\" (white), re-imposing measures that were introduced during the first provincewide shutdown. On April 5,  Peel Medical Officer of Health Lawrence Loh issued an order under Section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act to close all area schools beginning April 6. Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health and Toronto Public Health made similar orders.\nOn April 7, in order to protect hospitals and the vaccination program, Premier Ford declared a third state of emergency and announced a second stay-at-home order that took effect at 12:01&nbsp;a.m. ET on April 8, with similar measures to the first stay-at-home order, but with exceptions for certain specialized retail outlets to operate by appointment only, prohibiting essential retail stores from selling non-essential goods, and schools tentatively remaining open. Ford explained that \"the situation is evolving rapidly, hour by hour. And as things change, as we learn more about these deadly new variants, as we see new problems arise, we need to adapt. We need to move quickly and decisively.\"\nThe province also announced that it would offer vaccinations to all adults within specific hotspot areas, identified by postal codes. The selection of the areas faced criticism over its methodology, including its inclusion of several sortation areas that did not actually have high rates of COVID-19 cases and/or hospitalizations, On April 11, the province recorded its single largest day of new cases to-date, at 4,456.  On April 12, Premier Ford announced that all schools province-wide would close to in-person classes following Spring break.\nOn April 16, Premier Ford requested assistance from Alberta, including access to health care workers. The office of Alberta Premier Jason Kenney declined the request, citing its own impact by the third wave. Ford reportedly made a similar request to Saskatchewan, although the province denied that this had happened. New modelling was released with a best-case scenario of less than 4,000 cases per-day by the end of May if strong health measures (such as the current stay-at-home order) were in place and at least 100,000 vaccine doses were administered per-day, with scenarios improving if the stay-at-home order were extended to six weeks, and vaccination increased to at least 300,000 per-day.\nIn a news conference, Premier Ford announced that the stay-at-home order will be extended through at least May 20, and that it would also include additional capacity restrictions for retail, the closure of all outdoor recreation amenities, and a prohibition of non-essential interprovincial land travel into Ontario. Solicitor General Sylvia Jones also announced that police had been granted the right to randomly stop and question any individual they suspect are violating the stay-at-home order, including compelling them to provide their home address and reason for travel, and issuing tickets for violating a public health order if they do not comply. The policy faced criticism for resembling the past practice of carding, having a disproportionate impact on BIPOC communities, and potentially violating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A number of municipal police departments announced that they would not perform random stops. On April 17, Jones announced that the measure would be \"refocused\", only allowing police to stop and ticket people they suspect are participating in a prohibited public event or gathering\nOn April 18, a spokesperson stated that Ontario has had supply issues with vaccines. Backpedaling from the NACI guidance, Ontario announced that it would expand availability of the AstraZeneca vaccine to those 40 and older. David Moscrop published an op-ed in the U.S. newspaper The Washington Post calling for Ford to resign, arguing that the pandemic had exacerbated his \"extraordinary capacity to alienate, divide and fail\", and criticizing him for the aforementioned police measures, restricting outdoor recreation despite many COVID-19 cases being attributed to crowded indoor workplaces such as factories, and repeatedly ignoring calls to implement paid sick leave (with Ford deeming it redundant to the federal, retroactive Canadian Recovery Sickness Benefit). On April 19, Ford was absent from the legislative session,\nOn April 20, Peel Public Health and Toronto Public Health both issued Section 22 orders mandating that businesses be closed for 10 days (with all employees required to self-isolate for the same period) if they are linked to five or more COVID-19 infections within the past 14 days.\nPremier Ford was accused by his opposition of \"hiding\" from the Legislature and the media since April 19, and organizing a virtual party fundraiser with tickets costing $1,000 each, amid increasing criticism of his management of the pandemic. The province issued a statement indicating that Ford was focusing primarily on procuring additional vaccine doses via international partners. On April 20, both the Ontario Liberal Party and NDP called for Ford's resignation; Ontario Liberal Party leader Steven Del Duca argued that Ford was \"missing in action, hiding from the people, and hiding from accountability\", and \"scared to face the people and acknowledge his stunning incompetence\". It was announced by the province that Ford was isolating due being a close contact of a positive case within his staff. Ford himself had tested negative.\nOn April 22, in his first media appearance since April 16, Premier Ford admitted that the government \"made a mistake\" and \"went too far\" with the measures they had announced on April 16. In a reversal of his prior stance, Ford also announced plans to introduce a provincial paid sick leave program, arguing that they needed to compensate for \"important improvements\" that were not included in the CRSB in the 2021 federal budget.\nMay\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=1 | Active\n! colspan=3 | Hospitalizations\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!
