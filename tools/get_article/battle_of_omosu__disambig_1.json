It is distinguished, however, as one of the very few naval battles to be fought in pre-modern Japan.\nThe battle took place off the coast of the Izu peninsula between the navies of Hōjō Ujimasa, the head of the Hōjō, and those of Takeda Katsuyori, the head of the Takeda.\nThe Fūma ninja led by Fūma Kotarō covertly infiltrated and attacked a camp of the Takeda clan forces at night, succeeding in causing severe chaos in the camp, which resulted in massive casualties among the disoriented enemies as they attacked each other.\nLater, while the navies faced off, the land armies of each family advanced towards one another.\nIn the end, the Hōjō were victorious.\nReferences"
