It operated as the upper house in a strict bicameral system, where both chambers held equal legislative powers. Laws required identical approval from both chambers, with the Chamber of Deputies taking precedence only in initiating financial legislation. However, the President of the Republic needed the Senate's consent to dissolve the lower house.\nPolitically, the Senate's creation was a compromise between monarchists (divided between Orléanists and Legitimists) and republicans in the National Assembly. Republicans agreed to a conservative upper house in exchange for monarchist support for the Republic.\nComposition\nThe Senate initially consisted of 300 senators, with a minimum age of 40. Of these, 225 were elected indirectly by departmental electoral colleges, comprising deputies, general councilors, arrondissement councilors, and one representative per municipal council. Their term lasted nine years, with one-third renewable every three years. The remaining 75 were \"life senators\" chosen from the National Assembly and later co-opted by the Senate upon vacancies. Before its dissolution on 31 December 1875, the National Assembly appointed these 75 life senators between 9 November and 21 December, predominantly selecting republicans (58 of 75) despite the chamber's monarchist leanings.\nThe first election occurred on 30 January 1876, coinciding with the Chamber of Deputies election campaign. Conservatives (Catholics, Bonapartists, and counter-revolutionaries) narrowly secured a majority with 151 seats against 149 for republicans and the far left. The Duke Gaston d'Audiffret-Pasquier was elected Senate President, but moderates from both sides soon collaborated to shape public policy, aligning with the framers' intentions.\nEvolution\nDuring the 16 May 1877 crisis, the Senate, consulted by President MacMahon, approved the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies on 22 June 1877 by a vote of 149 to 130, formalized by MacMahon on 25 June 1877.\nThe first partial renewal on 5 January 1879 was a significant defeat for conservatives, with republicans gaining a lead of over 40 seats (174 to 126). The new president, Louis Martel, was a moderate republican. The republican shift in both chambers pressured the Dufaure ministry to purge the civil service, contributing to MacMahon's resignation.\nThe 1884 constitutional revision abolished life senators (effective upon their deaths) and expanded the electoral college to favor urban communes. The last life senator, Émile de Marcère, died in 1918.\nIn the first two decades, radicals repeatedly proposed abolishing the Senate. However, its moderation helped counter Boulangism, leading radicals to abandon their calls for its suppression.\nConstitutional crisis\nUnder the Constitution, ministers were collectively accountable to both chambers. Until 1890, governments typically resigned only after no-confidence votes in the Chamber of Deputies. However, the Tirard government resigned after a Senate no-confidence vote in 1890, though this was more a pretext than a substantive rebuke.\nIn 1885, Jules Ferry argued: \"In all free nations and parliamentary constitutions, the power to make or break ministries belongs to only one of the two chambers.\" This issue divided jurists and politicians until 1896, when the Senate, hostile to the Bourgeois government for its left-leaning policies, refused to resign despite three adverse votes. The Senate then blocked military funding for repatriating the Madagascar expeditionary force, forcing Bourgeois's resignation. This precedent established the Senate's role in governmental instability, particularly after World War I.\nHigh Court\nThe Senate could serve as a High Court for cases involving treason or malfeasance by the President or threats to state security, inheriting this role from the Chamber of Peers. It judged cases against Paul Déroulède in 1899, Louis Malvy in 1918, and Joseph Caillaux in 1920.\nSenatorial elections\nExcept for the initial 1876 election, which selected the first 225 elected senators (with 75 life senators appointed by the National Assembly in December 1875), senatorial elections renewed one-third of the seats every three years. Due to World War I, Series B and C elections (scheduled for 1915 and 1918) were postponed by laws of 24 December 1914 and 31 December 1917. After the 7 July 1929 law, elections occurred in mid-October before the mandate's expiration, typically in January.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Senatorial Elections !!
