Established in 2025, the award is given to the composer of a film or television score for a short film based on two criteria: the effectiveness, appropriateness and emotional impact of the score in the context of the film for which it was written; and the technical and intellectual merit of the composition when heard as a standalone listening experience.\"  Short films of all genres are eligible, however; the film must be shorter than 50 minutes. The eligibility period runs January 1 through December 31 every year, and IFMCA members vote for the winner the following February.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the tables below, winners are marked by a light green background and a double-dagger symbol ().\n2020s\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!scope=col width=\"10%\" | Year\n!scope=col width=\"40%\" | Short Film\n!scope=col width=\"40%\" | Composer(s)\n!scope=col width=\"10%\" |\n|-\n!scope=rowgroup rowspan=5|2024\n|}}\n|}}\n|rowspan=\"5\"|\n|-\n|An Almost Christmas Story\n|\n|-\n|Carmen y La Cuchara de Palo}}\n|\n|-\n|The Ice Cream Man\n|\n|-\n|The Only Girl in the Orchestra\n|\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nReferences"
