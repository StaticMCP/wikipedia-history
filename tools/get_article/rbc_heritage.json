It is currently played in mid-April, the week after The Masters in Augusta, Georgia.\nThe venue for its entire existence has been the Harbour Town Golf Links at the Sea Pines Resort on Hilton Head Island. The Harbour Town course, which frequently appears on several \"Best Courses\" lists, was designed by famed golf course architect Pete Dye, with assistance from Jack Nicklaus. In 1972, the first two rounds were played on both the Harbour Town Golf Links and the Ocean course at Sea Pines, with the final two rounds at Harbour Town.\nOriginally played in late November, it moved to mid-September in 1973, March in 1974, and April in 1983. The inaugural champion in 1969 was forty-year-old Arnold Palmer, his first win in over a year. Course co-designer Nicklaus won in 1975,  two weeks before his fifth Masters win. Davis Love III leads with five victories in the event, Hale Irwin and Stewart Cink have three, while seven others have won twice.\nFrom 1987 through 2010, it was sponsored either by MCI (under both the \"MCI\" and \"WorldCom\" names) or its eventual purchaser, Verizon. The tournament operated without a title sponsor in 2011, and the Royal Bank of Canada has been the title sponsor of The Heritage since 2012. It is currently organized by The Heritage Classic Foundation.\nCourse\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

The other four tournaments with invitational status are the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Charles Schwab Challenge, the Memorial Tournament, and the Genesis Invitational.  Invitational tournaments have smaller fields, and have more freedom than full-field open tournaments in determining which players are eligible to participate in their event, as invitational tournaments are not required to fill their fields using the PGA Tour Priority Ranking System.  Furthermore, unlike full-field open tournaments, invitational tournaments do not offer open qualifying (aka Monday qualifying).\nFor the 2026 tournament, it will serve as the Tournament of Champions featuring all 2025 calendar year PGA Tour winners.\nField\nThe field consists of 70 or more invited using the following criteria:\n#  Top 50 in the previous year's FedEx Cup Standings. (BMW PGA Championship qualifiers)\n#  Top 10 in the current year PGA Tour FedEx Cup standings as of the Masters Tournament that were not in the previous year's Top 50.\n#  Aon Swing 5 (Puerto Rico Open, Valspar Championship, Texas Children's Houston Open and Valero Texas Open)\n#  Current year PGA Tour full FedEx Cup points tournament winners.\n#  Top 30 Official World Golf Rankings\n# 2026 Only – All 2025 calendar year winners on the PGA Tour (full field and opposite field events) will participate.\nPlaying history\nThe tournament has been played in the month of\n* November (1969–72)\n* September (1973)\n* March (1974–82) - usually two weeks before the Masters Tournament\n* April (1983– ) - usually the week after the Masters Tournament\n** Exception: In 2020, it was postponed until June due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Year!!Winner!!Score!!To par!!Margin ofvictory!!Runner(s)-up!!Purse($)!!Winner'sshare

David Frost breaks Mark Calcavecchia's record of 93 putts in a 72-hole tournament by hitting only 92 putts.\n* 2007 Boo Weekley chips in on the last two holes for his first ever PGA Tour victory.
