The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations.\nWhile many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed, not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties.\nIn 2004, the NHCP approved a marker for the Alberto House, Biñan for its historicity in relation to Teodora Alonso, José Rizal, and the city. However, the marker did not push through because the owner refused to follow preservation requests.\nOn March 18, 2015, a marker pertaining to the Jabidah massacre was installed in Corregidor, Cavite City. Despite referring to the said event, the marker was entitled \"Mindanao Garden of Peace, Corregidor Island\" and did not contain the name \"Jabidah.\"\nA marker, commemorating National Artist Vicente Manansala was moved from his house in Binangonan to Holy Angel University, Angeles City.\nThis article lists two hundred eighty-three (283) markers from the CALABARZON Region, including two (2) that are part of the Philippine Nationhood Trail markers series.\nBatangas\nThis article lists forty-five (45) markers from the Province of Batangas.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Marker title\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| English Translation\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Type\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Description\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Language\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Date Issued\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Image\n|-\n| Albino C.
