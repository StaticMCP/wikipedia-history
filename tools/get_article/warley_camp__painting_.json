In 1804 during the Napoleonic Wars a permanent Warley Barracks was established at the location.\nThe painter sketched a number of soldiers as preparation for the work. The paintings were commissioned by Lieutenant General Richard Pierson who commanded the troops taking part in the mock attack. He presented them both the George III as a gift. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1780 at Somerset House and was later hung by the king at Kew Palace.
