The Centre of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation recommended that a  radius around the volcano be evacuated. Seven villages were affected by the eruption. A larger eruption occurred on 7 November. On 8 November, the volcano erupted several times, one bearing an ash plume with a height reaching 10 km (6.2 mi). On 9 November, it erupted again, scrambling authorities to evacuate approximately 16,000 people from nearby villages. The volcano erupted twice on 7 July 2025, the first one occurring at 11:00 local time, sending a column of volcanic materials to height up to 18 km (11 mi) which was the volcano's highest since the 7 November 2024 eruption, the second eruption occurred at 19:30 local time, spewing lava and sending clouds of ash up to 13 km (8 mi), at least 24 international flights and 4 domestic flights were cancelled as a result of the eruptions on 7 July 2025.\n|-\n!style=\"background:#f90;\"|4\n|Mount Ruang\n|Indonesia\n|2024\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|23\n|\n|\n|Thousands of homes were destroyed. Volcanic ash was reported as far away as Manado and several areas in Gorontalo.  Airlines from West Malaysia and Singapore cancelled flights to Sabah and Sarawak on 18 April due to reduced visibility. The eruption also prompted the shutdown of Sam Ratulangi International Airport in North Sulawesi. All 843 residents of Ruang island were evacuated to Manado, while 12,000 residents of Tagulandang were relocated to Siau Island by ship. On 17 and 30 April, authorities raised the volcano's alert level to four, the highest in Indonesia and issued a tsunami alert which led to orders for 11,000 residents and evacuees in Tagulandang to be moved to Manado in mainland Sulawesi, citing the risk of the volcano collapsing into the sea.\n|-\n!style=\"background:#f90;\"|4?\n|Sheveluch\n|Russia\n|2023\n|style=\"text-align: center;\"|20\n|\n|\n|An eruption on 11 April ejected a cloud of volcanic gas and ash that reached a height of  and spread over an area of .

Satellite measurements recorded an eruption column of at least  into the atmosphere. The explosion was hundreds of times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and was heard as far as Fairbanks, Alaska, nearly 10,000&nbsp;km away. Fluctuations in air pressure were recorded all over the world as the pressure wave fully circled the world several times. Two people were killed in Peru by a 2-metre tsunami wave.
