Thomas Stackhouse, afterwards an Anglican clergyman and theologian, was headmaster of the school from 1701 to 1704. The school is in a multi-academy trust (Hadrian Learning Trust) with Hexham Middle School. The head of school is Neal Seaton, and Graeme Atkins is the Executive Headteacher, having previously headed Northwood School. The school currently uses one building, split into 4 sections; Causey, Leazes, Fellside and The Hydro.\nThe school received a £36 million investment from the government and Northumberland County Council to expand the \"Hydro\" building, while demolishing the old 'lower school' and adding state of the art facilities. The new building also incorporates Hexham Middle School, although the students do not mix. During this time, the school rebranded to a new design.\nThe work was completed in September 2021, after a short delay.\nAdmissions\nIt has approximately 1300 students, of whom 380 are in the Sixth Form. Northumberland LEA currently operates a three-tier system, so QEHS has students aged between 13 and 18.\nits catchment area is about  from west to east and  from north to south. It includes Hexham, Blanchland, Humshaugh, and Riding Mill.\nThe school is part of the Tynedale Virtual College, a collaboration between the four high schools in the Tyne Valley and Northumberland College.  The TVC seeks to provide vocational learning across the area.\nIt is just off Allendale Road (B6305) in the west of Hexham.\nAcademic performance\nOn 21 March 2019 an Ofsted inspection judged the school to be 'Good'.\nSport\nThe school has a rowing club called the Queen Elizabeth High School Rowing Club,\nAlumni\n* Matthew Wells (rower), British Olympic Rower\n* Charlie Mackesy, Artist\n* Joe Morris, Politician\n* Shaun Vipond, Footballer\n* Joe Grey, Footballer\n* Jonathan Higgs and Michael Spearman, members of Everything Everything\n* Alex Niven, writer, academic and former member of Everything Everything\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*  - Page 14 (PDF p. 15/61) has the image of the QEHS catchment (\"Hexham Partnership\") as seen within Northumberland, and page 36 (PDF p. 37/61) has the detailed catchment map of QEHS\n*  - Has a combined map of the catchments of QEHS and Haydon Bridge High School and compares the sum to the size of Greater London\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070925074109/http://ngfl.northumberland.gov.uk/default.htm Northumberland Grid for Learning]"
