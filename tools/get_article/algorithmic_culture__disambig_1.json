An early occurrence of the term is found in Alexander R. Galloway's classic Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture.\nOther definitions include Ted Striphas' work, where algorithmic culture refers to the ways in which the logic of big data and large-scale computation (including algorithms) alters how culture is practiced, experienced, and understood. Another perspective is offered by Diggit Magazine, which describes algorithmic culture as the influence of computational processes on cultural practices.\nA starting point for modern discussion of culture is attributed to Edward Burnett Tylor in his 1871 works on primitive culture.\nThe emergence and continuing development and convergence of computers, software, algorithms, human psychology, digital marketing and other computational technologies resulted in numerous AC variants including recommendation algorithms, AI generated stories and characters, digital assets (including creative NFTs, all of which can and should be considered as algorithmic culture artifacts. A similar process is occurring in strictly sociological interactions.\nAlgorithmic Culture and ChatGPT\nWith the flourishing of LLMs, and particularly ChatGPT, algorithmic culture is increasingly visible within the academic mainstream. Jill Walker Rettberg at the University of Bergenis exploration applications of in her works. Some of the examples she uses are: How to use ChatGPT to get past writer's block, and examining society's biases and cliches\nGenerative AI, is a now prominent and fast evolving component of modern algorithmic culture. It is currently entering a period of accelerating growth, acceptance and use, with specific algorithms and tools including Midjourney DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.\nChatGPT Plus, GPT-4 are increasing their sophistication in composing music, writing teleplays, fairy tales, stories, and poems. With user prompting also facilitating character specific speaking and writing styles. NovelAI, for example,  is an online AI-assisted story writer.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* [https://www.worldcat.org/title/1100454974 Jonathan Cohn,  The burden of choice: Recommendations, subversion, and algorithmic culture, Rutgers University Press, 2019]\n* [https://www.worldcat.org/title/1316708299 Fernández Rovira Cristina and Santiago Giraldo Luque.
