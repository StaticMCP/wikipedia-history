It was released in November 2010 internationally and January 2011 in Japan.\nPlot\nThe story is set in a once prosperous and fruitful kingdom, which is overtaken by a mysterious \"Darkness\" and thrown into disarray. While many citizens attempted to explore and find out what's going on, they were never to be seen again, and the decay continued. To cleanse this forsaken kingdom of the darkness, a young thief sets out to find and free the mythical Majin - an incredibly powerful mystical beast, to reclaim its power and restore the land to its former glory.\nGameplay\nThe game is an action-adventure game with puzzle elements thrown in at different intervals. Players control the thief, Tepeu, while the Majin, Teotl, is A.I. controlled. Though the player takes no direct control over Teotl, they can give him commands, which are often used for solving puzzles or during combat.\nAs the game progresses, Teotl will gain powers, such as the ability to produce electricity. These elements will be used both in combat and puzzle solving.\nThe game is intended to emphasize the differences in Tepeu and Teotl. For example, at certain points, the characters will be separated and Tepeu must dispatch enemies using stealth, as he does not have the strength Teotl does.\nDevelopment\nThe game was first announced during Namco Bandai's press briefing in Gamescom 2009 trade show. Takahiro Sasanoi, director for Tekken 6, also served as the director for this game. The original title was Majin: The Fallen Realm however, this was later changed during development. Although the game shares many conceptual similarities with Team Ico's The Last Guardian, Namco Bandai states that Majin and the Forsaken Kingdom \"was in development long before [The] Last Guardian was announced.\" In March 2010, Namco Bandai confirmed the game for a western release.\n| Edge_PS3 = 7/10\n| EuroG_PS3 = 7/10\n| EuroG_X360 = 7/10\n| GI_PS3 = 8/10\n| GI_X360 = 8/10\n| GamePro_X360 =\n| GameRev_PS3 = C\n| GameRev_X360 = C\n| GSpot_PS3 = 7/10\n| GSpot_X360 = 7/10\n| GT_X360 = 7.1/10\n| GameZone_X360 = 7/10\n| IGN_PS3 = 7/10\n| IGN_X360 = 7/10\n| Joystiq_PS3 =\n| OXM_X360 = 7.5/10\n| PSM_PS3 = 7/10\n| rev1 = The A.V.

Club gave the PS3 version a B− and said that while the game \"isn't overtly a kids' game, the translations and voice acting are almost comically silly.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.uk.namcobandaigames.eu/product/majin-and-the-forsaken-kingdom/playstation-3 Namco-Bandai Games European site]"
