After the fall of communism in Poland, the idea of building a worthy monument to the Home Army in Warsaw was established quickly in 1989.\nThe project for the monument was created as a result of two competitions announced by the Association of Polish Architects (Stowarzyszenie Architektów Polskich) in 1993 and 1997 at the request of the Committee of the Monument Building Mausoleum Army (Komitetu Budowy Pomnika Mauzoleum Armii Krajowej), which was established in 1990. After fundraising and choosing a location, the project was awarded to architect and graphic designer Jerzy Staniszkis.\nThe foundation stone was laid on August 2, 1994, and the unveiling took place on June 10, 1999. The ceremonial unveiling was made by the Speaker of the Sejm, Maciej Płażyński. The ceremony was preceded by Holy Mass celebrated by Polish Primate Cardinal Józef Glemp, and on June 11, the monument was dedicated by Pope John Paul II.\nThe monument is a place of celebration on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising and on Independence Day.\nDescription\nIt is an abstract design which takes the form of an obelisk 32 meters high, which is topped with light gray Italian granite slabs. The memorial is made from Polish Strzegom granite. On it are placed the names of all the institutions and leaders of the Polish Underground.\nInterpretation\nThe monument is a tribute to all veterans of the Home Army and is a special gift of the Polish nation, which is a reminder of the ethos and the heroism of the people that made up the structure of the Polish Underground State and the need to incur the greatest sacrifices for the good of the country. \"Monument (to the) Polish Underground State is a symbol of Polish statehood, the symbol of the Polish state from a time when it seemed that the Polish state was no longer\" - said the then Speaker of Parliament during the celebration of the 66th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising.\nThe location near the Parliament is supposed to symbolize the continuity of the Polish state whose most important institutions, despite the occupation, did not stop their activities for even one day. It also stresses the continuity of the ideals for which the Home Army fought.\nDue to the fact that the monument is an abstract form, its interpretation may vary - a wing of a bird symbolizing eternal desired freedom, or the bastion of a fortress. The form of the monument was \"derived from classical obelisk and, thanks to streamlined line architecture in this particular case is a traditional form of sculpture\".\nImage:Pomnik_Polskiego_Państwa_Podziemnego_i_Armii_Krajowej_-_01.JPG|The monument in front of parliament\nImage:Pomnik_Polskiego_Państwa_Podziemnego_i_Armii_Krajowej_-_06.JPG|Detail of the monument\nImage:Pomnik_Polskiego_Państwa_Podziemnego_i_Armii_Krajowej_-_05.JPG|Detail of the monument\nImage:Pomnik_Polskiego_Państwa_Podziemnego_i_Armii_Krajowej_-_04.JPG|Detail of the monument\nReferences"
