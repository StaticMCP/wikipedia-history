Mir Chakar's kingdom was short-lived because of a civil war between the Lashari and Rind tribes of Balochistan. Mir Chakar Rind and Mir Gwaharam Khan Lashari, head of the Lashari tribe, went to war that resulted in thousands dead, including Mir Chakar's brother. The war and the gallantry of the two tribe leaders continues to be a part of the Baloch peoples' history.  After the \"Thirty Years' War\" against the Lashari Tribe, Mir Chakar Rind left Balochistan and settled in the Punjab region in 1518 with other Rind tribes. These tribes are settled in southern central Punjab.\nReferences"
