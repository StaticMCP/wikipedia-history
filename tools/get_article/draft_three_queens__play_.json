Set over one night, the night before Lady Jane Grey is due to be executed for treason on 12th February 1554, it deals with a fictional encounter between Lady Jane Grey, Queen Mary I of England and Princess Elizabeth Tudor - the future Queen Elizabeth I of England - at Greenwich Palace. It also features Sir Robert Dudley, Kat Ashley and Cardinal Reginald Pole, who all have their own motivations to either help or hinder the three main protagonists. Its first full performance run took place at Barons Court Theatre, London, in 2024 for three weeks and was produced by Kibo Productions and Rosamund Gravelle.\nCharacters\n* Queen Mary I - Queen of England\n* Lady Jane Grey\n* Princess Elizabeth Tudor - heir to the English throne\n* Kat Ashley - first close friend/companion and ex-governess to Princess Elizabeth Tudor\n* Sir Robert Dudley - son of the executed Duke of Northumberland\n* Cardinal Reginald Pole - cousin to Queen Mary Tudor, Princess Elizabeth, Lady Jane Grey\nPerformance history\nThree Queens had its first full performance run at Barons Court Theatre, London, United Kingdom, between 23rd April 2024 and 11th May 2024. It was directed by Sharon Willems (Artistic Director of Barons Court Theatre and Arches Lane Theatre), and produced by Kibo Production and Rosamund Gravelle, with lighting design by Leo Bacica and music by composer Edward Dimitri Kennaway. The original cast included Becky Black as Queen Mary I of England, Martha Crow as Lady Jane Grey, Les Kenny-Green as Cardinal Reginald Pole, Sushant Shekhar as Sir Robert Dudley, Sally Sharp as Kat Ashley, and Eliza Shea as Princess Elizabeth Tudor.\nAwards and Honours\nIn 2024, Three Queens was nominated for two Off West End Awards - one for Martha Crow as Best Lead Performance and the other for Les Kenny-Green as Best Supporting Performance - along with a London Pub Theatres Standing Ovation 2024 nomination for Sharon Willems for Best Direction. It also received a Best Show of 2024 from theatre critic David Weir in London Pub Theatres Best Shows of 2024 list.\nHistorical Accuracy\nAlthough Rosamund Gravelle used historical people and events, Gravelle used dramatic license in her play. Here are the most prominent examples:\nLady Jane Grey did not meet Mary I and Princess Elizabeth at Greenwich Palace the night before her execution, nor did Cardinal Reginald Pole bring her there. Lady Jane Grey did, however, refuse a meeting with Queen Mary's priest and refused to recant her faith while she was a prisoner at the Tower of London.\nCardinal Reginald Pole was in Europe at the time of the events in the play; he did not come to England till later in 1558 with the offer of marriage to Mary from Philip of Spain.\nSir Robert Dudley was still a prisoner and under guard at the Tower of London and was not released until the next year with the King of Spain's help, not Queen Mary's, and was pardoned by Philip, but he was never allowed out of the Tower until then.\nPrincess Elizabeth was sent to the Tower of London as a prisoner in March, not February, of 1554.\nReferences"
