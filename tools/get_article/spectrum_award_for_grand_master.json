But (and this is the key) it fails to resonate. It is admired in the moment and immediately forgotten. A Grand Master's art, on the other hand, gets stuck in the viewer's heart and memory.\nArnie Fenner also states \"At the time of the designation is given the artist must be living. Recently, two GM honorees died prior to the announcement --Al Williamson and Ralph McQuarrie-- which confused a few people, but...both were still with us when the Board bestowed the honor.\"\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!2019\n!Donato Giancola\n!Spectrum 26\n!Ref\n!Spectrum Fantastic Art Live 6 - Kansas City, MO\n|-\n|2018\n|Claire Wendling\n|Spectrum 25\n|\n|Brookledge Theater - Los Angeles, CA\n|-\n|2017\n|Bill Sienkiewicz\n|Spectrum 24\n|\n|Spectrum Fantastic Art Live 5 - Kansas City, MO\n|-\n|2016\n|Mike Mignola\n|Spectrum 23\n|\n|Society of Illustrators - New York City, NY\n|-\n|2015\n|Scott Gustafson\n|Spectrum 22\n|\n|Spectrum Fantastic Art Live 4 - Kansas City, MO\n|-\n|2014\n|Iain McCaig\n|Spectrum 21\n|\n|Spectrum Fantastic Art Live 3 - Kansas City, MO\n|-\n|2013\n|Gerald Brom\n|Spectrum 20\n|\n|Spectrum Fantastic Art Live 2 - Kansas City, MO\n|-\n|2012\n|James Gurney\n|Spectrum 19\n|\n|Spectrum Fantastic Art Live - Kansas City, MO\n|-\n|2011\n|Ralph McQuarrie\n|Spectrum 18\n|\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Al Williamson\n|Spectrum 17\n|\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Richard Corben\n|Spectrum 16\n|\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|John Jude Palencar\n|Spectrum 15\n|\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|Syd Mead\n|Spectrum 14\n|\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|Jeffrey Jones\n|Spectrum 13\n|\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|H.
