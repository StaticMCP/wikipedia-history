The only candidate on the ballot who had not withdrawn was Donald Trump.\nThe Democratic Party held their Washington caucuses on March 26, and a non-binding primary in Washington on the same day as the Republican primary. No other primaries were scheduled for that day. Following Trump's victory in Washington and a surge in his support from unbound North Dakota delegates, the Associated Press (on May 26) announced that Trump had passed the threshold of 1,237 delegates required to guarantee his nomination.\nList of delegates\nThe Washington Republican State Convention was held May 19–21, 2016 in Pasco, WA. Delegates to the Republican National Convention were elected from among the approximately 3,000 delegates and alternates who had been elected to the Washington Republican State Convention.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Washington state delegates to the 2016 Republican National Convention (RNC)\n!Delegate\n!WA Congressional District\n|-\n|Janna Anderson\n|7th Congressional District\n|-\n|Maria Apodaca\n|6th Congressional District\n|-\n|David Barnes\n|5th Congressional District\n|-\n|Kenneth Barton\n|8th Congressional District\n|-\n|Michele Beckmann\n|5th Congressional District\n|-\n|Gina Blanchard-Reed\n|10th Congressional District\n|-\n|Richard Brantley\n|10th Congressional District\n|-\n|Bill Bruch\n|2nd Congressional District\n|-\n|Nancy C.
