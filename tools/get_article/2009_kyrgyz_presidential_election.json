The date was set after the constitutional court ruled that the extension of the presidential term from four to five years did not apply until the next presidential election, calling for elections by 25 October 2009; in response, a parliament committee proposed the July election date, which was then passed by the incumbent president Kurmanbek Bakiyev's Ak Jol-dominated parliament. Bakiyev had previously announced his intention to run for reelection. Bakiyev was re-nominated on 1 May 2009.\nOn election day the main opposition candidate Almazbek Atambayev withdrew from the contest, citing his belief that fraud was employed extensively and thus considers the election illegitimate.  The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) also claimed that Bakiyev had unfair advantages in terms of superior media coverage of his campaign, and vote rigging.  Eventually, Bakiyev was declared the winner of the election with 76% of the vote.  An opposition rally on election day was broken up by Kyrgyz police.\nCandidates\nOn 20 April 2009, the United Opposition announced its candidate &ndash; Almazbek Atambayev, the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan, the only opposition party represented in parliament. Another opposition politician, former defence minister Ismail Isakov, announced on 19 May 2009 that he would withdraw from the race to improve Atambayev's chances, reducing the field from 18 to 17 potential candidates.\nApart from Bakiyev and Atambayev, three more candidacies were approved: Those of Toktayym Ümötalieva (chairwoman of the Association of Nongovernmental and Nonprofit Organizations), physician Jengishbek Nazaraliev and Temir Sariyev.\nBakiyev's advertising campaign consisted primarily of television ads, billboards, and paper fliers in windows of stores, companies, and kiosks. Nazaraliev's advertising campaign consisted mainly of propaganda fliers and journals passed out to residences in Kyrgyzstan, as well as small paper advertisements stuck to walls and posts throughout Bishkek.  Atambaev held rallies and also had paper advertisements posted. Motuev had at least one billboard, near ZUM.\nElection day\nOn polling day Atambayev withdrew his candidacy claiming widespread fraud; he stated: \"Due to massive, unprecedented violations, we consider these elections illegitimate and a new election should be held.\" Independent candidate Jenishbek Nazaraliev also withdrew on election day. The OSCE stated that Bakiyev gained an \"unfair advantage\" and that the media bias \"did not allow voters to make an informed choice.\" Additionally, they found that the election was \"marred by many problems and irregularities\", citing ballot stuffing and problems with the vote counting.\nAn opposition rally of 1,000 people in Balykchy during election day was broken up by riot police.\nResults\nAs of 22:00 on 26 July 2009 (with 2,282 of 2,330 polling districts reporting), Bakiev was reported had won the election with 78% of the vote. Earlier in the day (00:40 local time), the results showed the same number of districts reporting, but the numbers were significantly different, showing that Bakiyev had won with 82.62% of the vote.\nThe day after the election the opposition said it planned to hold more protests.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://president.kg/ President of Kyrgyzstan]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090518082441/http://nazaraliev.info/ Nazaraliev's website]"
