This list also includes chancellors of the short-lived Zhou dynasty of the empress Wu Zetian within the Tang.\nOrigins\nOuyang Xiu, the author of the New Book of Tang, asserts that the Tang dynasty inherited its bureaucracy from its dynastic predecessor, the Sui, whose founder the Wen Emperor divided his government into five main bureaus (}}, ):\n* The Department of State Affairs (, )\n* The Chancellery (, )\n* The Legislative Bureau (, )\n* The Palace Library (, )\n* The Eunuch Bureau (initially , , but later changed to ,  by the Yang Emperor)\nUnder the Wen Emperor, the Department of State Affairs was regarded as the most important. He had his most honored officials such as Gao Jiong, Yang Su, and Su Wei lead it at various points. Its headsthe two  ()were generally regarded as the Sui chancellors. Ouyang further asserts, however, that the heads of the Legislative Bureau and Chancellery were also considered chancellors.\nDevelopment\nEmperor Gaozu, the founder of the Tang dynasty, initially followed the Sui's system of governance including the five-bureau organization. However, he established a single head for the Department of State Affairs, the  (), naming his second son Li Shimin to the post. Li Shimin became emperor in 626 (posthumously remembered as Emperor Taizong) but his former post of  had to be left vacant because none of his officials dared occupy it. The Department of State Affairs therefore reverted to its previous arrangement of being headed by two vice-directors, the . Around 626, probably by Emperor Taizong's orders, the institution of multiple chancellors was also formalized, treating the office as an additional honorific for the vice-directors of the Department of State Affairs, the palace attendant of the Chancellery, and the director of the Legislative Bureau (, ), whose Chinese name was changed to the  (). The Chancellery and the Legislative Bureau themselves often had more than one head, so that there were frequently more than four chancellors in any given year. After 705, however, the vice-directors of the Department of State Affairs were no longer considered chancellors by default, although some continued to separately received the status as an additional title.\nThe Tang government began to designate certain high-level officials as additional chancellors with titles such as the \"participator in administrative governance\" (, ). These positions were given a formal designation in 643, reckoned \"equivalent to the Legislative Bureau and Chancellery third-rank officials\" (, ). The 20th-century historian Bo Yang called such officials  chancellors (, ). The names of the Legislative Bureau and the Chancellery changed names multiple times, such that the Chinese phrasing of the chancellors \"equivalent to the Legislative Bureau and Chancellery third-rank officials\" also required frequent adjustment. Under Emperor Xuanzong, when the Legislative Bureau was briefly known as the  () and the Chancellery as the  (), the additional chancellors were known as  ((). A lesser designation with similar privileges was created in 682 under Emperor Gaozong, initially known as chancellors \"equivalent to the Legislative Bureau and Chancellery participators\" (, ). These were called  chancellors, second grade, by Bo. The last additional chancellor \"equivalent to the Legislative Bureau and Chancellery third-rank officials\" to be noted as such was Li Lin in the Chinese lunar year spanning late 757 and early 758. Lü Yin was also said to have carried such a title during his term as chancellor from 759 to 760 but he is not noted as such in the table of chancellors provided in the New Book of Tang. Meanwhile, following An Lushan's rebellion, the chancellors \"equivalent to the Legislative Bureau and Chancellery participators\" became very common.\nUntil the second reign of Emperor Ruizong began in 710, further variations on the \"participator in administrative governance\" continued to appear. These titles included the \"participator in important matters\" (, ), the \"participator in secret matters\" (, ), the \"participator in governance matters\" (, , and , ). These were grouped by Bo as  chancellors, third class.\nFunction\nUnder the Tang, officials designated as chancellors met periodically at the Hall of Matters of Governance (, ), originally located within the Chancellery. In 683, Pei Yan headed both the Chancellery and the Legislative Bureau and moved the hall to the Legislative Bureau. Under Emperor Xuanzong, the chancellor Zhang Shuo changed the hall's name to \"Area within the Legislative Bureau\" (, ), apparently employing a triple entendre as the terms could also refer to the combination of the Legislative Bureau () and the Chancellery (), Chinese often employing asyndeton, or to disciples or students of central affairs. Zhang also created five offices under the chancellors to oversee the civil service, state secrets, military matters, governance, and criminal law. Under Emperor Suzong, the chancellors begin to rotate their off days so that at least one would always be on duty, although, when submissions were made to the emperor, they were signed in the names of all the chancellors whether on duty or not. The name of the meeting place also changed back to the Hall of Matters of Governance.\nList\nThese lists includes chancellors of Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty but not various regional governors who were given the titles as honorifics. The chancellors under the pretenders Li Yun and Li Yu, Prince of De are listed, but not the chancellors under the pretender Li Chenghong. Li Chenghong was said to have had multiple chancellors but only Yu Kefeng () and Huo Huan ()) were named and their specific titles were not given.\nHeads of the Department of State Affairs\nThe

first and second grades, but did not regularly recur after 713. Liu Youqiu, who held the title as Zhi Junguo Zhongshi, was the last person to hold any variation of the title as chancellor as a regular title, although Pei Du would hold the title of Pingzhang Junguo Zhongshi () briefly in 830. Toward the end of the dynasty, Li Zhirou was briefly put temporarily in charge of the Office of the Chancellors in 895 with the designation Quanzhi Zhongshu Shi () and therefore could be regarded as a chancellor as well (and was listed in the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang); similarly, Lu Guangqi went through two similar titles.\n* Zhang Liang (643–646) (as Canyu Chaozheng ())\n* Chu Suiliang (644–647, 648) (as Canyu Chaozheng)\n* Xu Jingzong (645) (as Tongzhang Jiwu ())\n* Gao Jifu (645) (as Tongzhang Jiwu)\n* Zhang Xingcheng (645) (as Tongzhang Jiwu)\n* Cui Renshi (648) (as Canzhi Jiwu ())\n* Li Yifu (655–657) (as Canzhi Zhengshi ())\n* Lu Chengqing (659) (as Canzhi Zhengshi)\n* Le Yanwei (665) (as Zhi Junguo Zhengshi ())\n* Sun Chuyue (665) (as Zhi Junguo Zhengshi)\n* Liu Rengui (665–666) (as Zhi Zhengshi ())\n* Zhang Wenguan (667–669) (as Canzhi Zhengshi)\n* Li Dan (710) (as Canmou Zhengshi ())\n* Liu Youqiu (710–711 (as Canyu Jiwu ()), 713 (as Zhi Junguo Zhongshi ()))\n* Zhong Shaojing (710) (as Canyu Jiwu)\n* Xue Ji (710) (as Canyu Jiwu)\n* Cui Riyong (710) (as Canyu Jiwu)\n* Dou Huaizhen (712) (as Junguo Zhongshi Yigong Pingzhang ())\n* Pei Du (830) (as Pingzhang Junguo Zhongshi)\n* Li Zhirou (895) as Quanzhi Zhongshu Shi ()\n* Lu Guangqi (901 (as Quanju Dang Zhongshu Shi ()), 901–902 (as Canzhi Jiwu))\nSee also\n* Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet\n* Grand chancellor (China)\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n* Old Book of Tang, vols.
