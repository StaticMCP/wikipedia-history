Its real home is the Black Forest of Germany.\nScience and technology\nInside Sierra Diablo mountains (Texas), is being built the monumental 10,000 Year Clock based upon an idea of Daniel Hillis who in 1995 expressed as follows: \"I want to build a clock that ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. I want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10,000 years.\" Funded by Jeff Bezos, it is designed to run for ten millennia with minimal maintenance and interruption.\nIn 2016 Lego, as part of their Lego Mindstorms Remix Challenge, gave 48 hours to four company designers to come up with a new item by combining two different existing products, the Lego Mindstorms EV3 (31313) and the Lego Technic Heavy Lift Helicopter (42052) sets. The winner model was a cuckoo and alarm clock by Jørn Kristian Thomsen. The cuckoo bird pops out to ‘cuckoo’ every 15 minutes and the alarm function triggers a moving, shooting vehicle to get you out of bed.\nLiterature\nSince its popularization, from the mid-1850s on, it has been a common character in children's literature, comics and cartoons, for educational, comical and/or entertainment purposes. All this is due to children are usually enchanted by the \"magic\" of a happy bird which lives in a house-shaped clock and pops out to announce the hours. In literature for children examples include:\n* [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/molesworth/clock/clock.html The Cuckoo Clock], by Mrs. Molesworth and first published in Edinburgh in 1877, which is the best-known and one of her most celebrated novels for children.\n* The Story of a Cuckoo Clock (1887), by Robina F.

In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and peace. And what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\" This remark was not in the script by Graham Greene but was added by Welles. Greene wrote in a letter: \"What happened was that during the shooting of The Third Man it was found necessary for the timing to insert another sentence.\" Welles said the lines came from \"an old Hungarian play\". The painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler had said, \"The Swiss in their mountains... What more worthy people! Yet, the perverse and scornful will none of it, and the sons of patriots are left with the clock that turns the mill, and the sudden cuckoo, with difficulty restrained in its box!\" In This is Orson Welles'' (1993), Welles is quoted as saying \"When the picture came out, the Swiss very nicely pointed out to me that they've never made any cuckoo clocks.\"\n* Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), directed by Don Siegel.\n* Lampa (1959), directed by Roman Polanski.\n* Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), directed by Otto Preminger.\n* Eraserhead (1977), directed by David Lynch.\n* Blade Runner (1982), directed by Ridley Scott.\n* Out of Africa (1985), directed by Sidney Pollack.\n* Saraband (2003), directed by Ingmar Bergman.\n* It's Only the End of the World (2016), directed by Xavier Dolan.\nTelevision\nRegarding to television, it plays a meaningful role in the next episodes of different TV series such as:\n* Kraft Television Theatre, \"The Cuckoo Clock\" (1954).\n* Alfred Hitchcock Presents, \"Triggers in Leash\" (1955).\n* Alfred Hitchcock Presents, \"The Cuckoo Clock\" (1960).\n* The Prisoner, \"Hammer into Anvil\" (1967).\n* The Banana Splits (1968-1970), where a cuckoo clock was a secondary character.\n* Hogan's Heroes, \"The Antique\" (1969).\n* Jackanory, \"The Cuckoo Clock\" (five parts) (1971).\n* Are you being served?, \"The Clock\" (1974).\n* Sesame Street, \"The Cuckoo Clock\" (1985).\n* Twin Peaks, \"Realization Time\" (1990).\n* Married... with Children, \"The Wedding Show\" (1993).\n* Goosebumps (1995 TV series), \"The Cuckoo Clock of Doom\" (1995).\n* Bananas in Pyjamas, \"Cuckoo Clock\" (1996).\n* Martin, \"Auction\" (1997).\n* St. Bear's Dolls Hospital, \"The Shy Cuckoo Clock\" (1998).\n* My Name is Earl'', \"Randy's Touchdown\" (2005).\nIn the German quiz show Tick-Tack-Quiz (original show Tic-Tac-Dough) broadcast on ARD between 1958 and 1967, the loser received a cuckoo clock as a consolation prize.\nThe British comedy Dave Allen at Large has a sketch taking place in the American West, in which an outlaw loads his revolver and heads for a saloon just before noon, against the pleas and begging of his woman not to go through with it.
