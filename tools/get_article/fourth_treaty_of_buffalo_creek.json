When agents of the land companies came to claim the Tonawanda reservation land, the Tonawanda refused to leave. (On a related note, in 1848, the other Seneca tribes approved the establishment of an American-style republican government, which the Tonawanda also rejected; the Tonawanda opted to continue with the traditional Seneca model, thus formally codifying the split between the two Seneca tribes.)\nTo settle the issue with the Tonawanda sale, the U.S. signed a treaty with the Tonawanda Band in 1857 that was known as the Treaty with the Seneca, Tonawanda Band. The Seneca bought back most of their reservation with the money set aside for their removal to Kansas. At the same time, they seceded from the main Seneca nation and restored their traditional government of a Council of Chiefs, based on consensus.\nSee also\n*Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)\n*Treaty of Canandaigua\n*Treaty of Big Tree\n*First Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1788)\n*Second Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838)\n*Third Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1842)\n*List of treaties\n*Fellows v.
