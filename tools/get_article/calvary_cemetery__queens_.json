With about three million burials, it has the largest number of interments of any cemetery in the United States. Established in 1848, Calvary Cemetery covers  and is owned by the Archdiocese of New York and managed by the Trustees of St. Patrick's Cathedral.\nCalvary Cemetery is divided into four sections, spread across the neighborhoods of Maspeth and Woodside. The oldest, First Calvary, is also called \"Old Calvary\".  The Second, Third and Fourth sections are all considered part of \"New Calvary\".\nHistory\nEstablishment\nMap of Blissville from 1873, showing Calvary Cemetery, from the [[Greater Astoria Historical Society]]\nIn 1817, the Trustees of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral on Mott Street, Manhattan, realized that their original cemetery on Mulberry Street was almost full. In 1847, faced with cholera epidemics and a shortage of burial grounds in Manhattan, the New York State Legislature passed the Rural Cemetery Act authorizing nonprofit corporations to operate commercial cemeteries. On October 29, 1845 Old St. Patrick's Cathedral trustees had purchased  of land from John McMenoy and John McNolte in Maspeth and this land was used to develop Calvary Cemetery. The cemetery was named after Mount Calvary, where Jesus Christ was crucified according to the New Testament.\nThe first Calvary Cemetery burial occurred on July 31, 1848. The name of the deceased was Esther Ennis, who reportedly \"died of a broken heart.\" The cemetery was consecrated by Archbishop John Hughes in August 1848.\nOperation\nBy 1852 there were 50 burials a day, half of them poor Irish under seven years of age. In the early 20th century, influenza and tuberculosis epidemics caused a shortage of gravediggers, and people dug graves for their own loved ones. The entire number of interments from the cemetery's opening in August 1848 until January 1898, was 644,761. From January 1898 until 1907 there were about 200,000 interments, thus yielding roughly 850,000 interments at Calvary Cemetery by 1907.\nCalvary was accessible by ferryboats crossing the East River from 23rd Street in Manhattan. It cost an adult seven dollars to be buried there. Burial of children under age seven cost three dollars; children aged seven to fourteen cost five dollars. As development in Manhattan's East Village expanded, bodies buried in that neighborhood were transferred to Queens. In 1854, ferry service opened by 10th Street and the East River.\nThe original division of the cemetery, now known as First Calvary or Old Calvary, was filled by 1867. The Archdiocese of New York expanded the area of the cemetery, adding more sections, and by the 1990s there were nearly 3 million burials in Calvary Cemetery. The Cemetery continues to add plots and burial spaces can be purchased in advance.\nIn 1949, several hundred workers at the cemetery went on strike.\nDescription\nLong Island Expressway in 2009]]\nCalvary is split into four sections. The first section is known as First Calvary or Old Calvary, and is located to the west of the section of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway (I-278) that runs between the Long Island Expressway (I-495) interchange and Newtown Creek. The others are known collectively as New Calvary, and as a group to the east of the above-mentioned section of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway.\n# First Calvary Cemetery is bounded by the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, Review Ave and 37th Street.\n# Second Calvary Cemetery is in-between the Long Island and Brooklyn–Queens Expressways, and also bounded by 48th Street and 58th Street. The cemetery's offices are located here, at 49–02 Laurel Hill Boulevard.\n# Third Calvary Cemetery is north of the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway, and also bounded by Queens Boulevard, 49th Street and 58th Street.\n# Fourth Calvary Cemetery is south of the Long Island Expressway, and also bounded by 55th Avenue, 50th Street and 58th Street.\nThe cemetery's chapel is named for St. Callixtus and was designed by Raymond F. Almirall. Originally a frame structure, it was rebuilt using limestone in 1908.\nCalvary Veterans Park\nA small part of the Old Calvary section of the cemetery is a city-owned public park that serves as a burial ground, the Calvary Veterans Park.  It was purchased by the City of New York from the Trustees of St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1863, for use as a burial ground for Union soldiers who died in New York hospitals.  Twenty-one soldiers were ultimately buried there, with the final burial occurring in 1909.\nThe Calvary Monument in the park, erected in 1866, originally with bronze sculptures is located in the park. The monument honors the 69th Regiment.  It is by Daniel Draddy, one of the Draddy Brothers, who sculpted the obelisk to William James MacNeven. There is no signage from either entrance, nor any mention on the official web site's maps. It is located at . The monument was last renovated in 1929. A conservation effort was initiated in 2009, but  is not done.\nNotable burials\nEntertainers\n* Tony Bennett (1926–2023), singer\n* Nancy Carroll (1903–1965), actress\n* Ferruccio Corradetti (1867–1939), opera singer\n* Dom DeLuise (1933–2009), actor\n* Tess Gardella (1894–1950), actress who played Aunt Jemima\n* Patrick Gilmore (1829–1882), \"Father of the American Band\"\n* Texas Guinan (1884–1933), actress and saloon-keeper\n* Robert Harron (1893–1920), actor – \"Second Calvary\"\n* James Hayden (1953–1983), actor\n* Joseph E.
