The rebellion ended on 23 July 1849 with the military defeat of the last revolt and the capture of Rastatt Fortress by German Federal Army troops under Prussian leadership.\nHistorical overview\n(1811–1881), on the left]]\nAt the Hambach Festival of 1832 the signs of political upheaval, known as the  (\"pre-March\") were evident. Among the participants at the festival was Johann Philipp Becker. After the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848 in Paris and the proclamation of the Second Republic in France, the revolutionary spark initially jumped to Baden before the other countries of the German Confederation gave way to revolutionary unrest and uprisings.\nThe German March revolution not only started in Baden, but also ended there when Rastatt Fortress, the last bastion of the revolutionaries, was captured by Prussian troops on 23 July 1849.\nThe Baden Revolution had two phases: between the beginning of March 1848 and September 1848 there were two attempts to form a republic in southwestern Germany: the Hecker Uprising and the rebellion led by Gustav Struve in Lörrach. With the defeat of Friedrich Hecker and his followers at Kandern and his flight into exile, and the arrest of Gustav Struve in September, this first phase ended.\nThe second phase began—after the rejection of the Constitution of St. Paul's Church by most of the royal houses of the German Parliament—with the May insurrections of 1849, not only in Baden, but also in other German states (especially in the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate). They represented an attempt to enforce the constitution (the so-called Imperial Constitution Campaign). This second phase ended in Baden with the defeat of the rebels at the last battle in July 1849 in Rastatt.\nCharacteristic of the Baden Revolution, unlike other uprisings in the German Confederation, was the persistent demand for a democratic republic. By contrast, the revolutionary councils and parliaments of the other principalities of the Confederation favoured a constitutional and hereditary monarchy.\nRadical democratic and early socialist revolutionaries were strongly represented in Baden. Some of the most prominent leaders were Friedrich Hecker, Gustav Struve and his wife Amalie, Gottfried Kinkel, Georg Herwegh and his wife Emma. Furthermore, Wilhelm Liebknecht, who at that time was relatively unknown but later co-founded the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany (SDAP), the predecessor party of SPD (the socialist party in Germany), participated in September 1848 in the uprising in Lörrach and in May 1849 in the Baden Revolution as Struve's adjutant.\nThe socialist Friedrich Engels who, during the March revolution wrote for the Neue Rheinische Zeitung published in Cologne by Karl Marx, also took an active part in 1849 in the final phase of the Baden Revolution in the fighting against counter-revolutionary Prussian troops. Finally, the married couple Fritz and Mathilde Franziska Anneke from Cologne joined the Baden rebels.\nThe basis of the revolution in Baden was based on the  or popular associations.\nThe following table shows the connexion between the revolution in Baden, the events in the German Confederation and Europe.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9;\"\n! bgcolor=\"#FFDEAD\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Period\n! bgcolor=\"#FFDEAD\" style=\"width:30%;\" | Grand Duchy of Baden\n! bgcolor=\"#FFDEAD\" style=\"width:30%;\" | German Confederation\n! bgcolor=\"#FFDEAD\" style=\"width:30%;\" | Europe\n|-\n|1847\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|September\n|Offenburg Assembly\n|\n|\n|-\n|October\n|\n|Heppenheim Assembly\n|\n|-\n|November\n|\n|\n|Switzerland: Sonderbund War\n|-\n|1848\n|Baden Revolution\n|German revolutions\n|Italy: First Italian War of Independence (1848–1849); March 1848 to July 1849\nHungary: Hungarian Revolution/1849; March 1848 to August 1849\n|-\n|February\n|Mannheim Popular Assembly\n|\n|France: French Revolution\n|-\n|March\n|Heidelberg Assembly\n|March Revolution\nBerlin: Barricade Uprising; March Revolution victims; Vienna: Revolutions in the Austrian Empire; Revolution in Sigmaringen\n|\n|-\n|April\n|Hecker Uprising\nBattle on the Scheideck; Battle of Günterstal; Storming of Freiburg; Battle of Dossenbach\n|\n|\n|-\n|June\n|\n|Pentecost Uprising in Prague\n|France: June Uprising and Counter-Revolution\n|-\n|September\n|Struve Putsch\nBattle of Staufen\n|Rebellion in Frankfurt\n|Slovakia: Slovak Uprising to November 1849\n|-\n|October\n|\n|Vienna Uprising\n|\n|-\n|1849\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|April\n|\n|Storming of the Zeughaus in Prüm\n|\n|-\n|May\n|Baden Revolution (mutiny); to July 1849,\nBaden Revolutionary Government; Baden constitutional assembly; Battle of Waghäusel;\nRastatt Fortress;\n|Reichsverfassungskampagne; Kaiser Deputation\nDresden Uprising; Palatine Uprising; Iserlohn Uprising; Elberfeld Uprising\n|\n|-\n|}\nChronology\nwas put down]]\n* 12 September 1847: In the Offenburg Assembly of the key supporters of the constitution, Friedrich Hecker takes the 13 \"demands of the people in Baden\" for citizens' rights, social security and equality, which Gustav Struve consolidated into four \"pressing demands of the deputations in Carlsruhe\": 1.
