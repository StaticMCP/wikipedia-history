Musicians' accomplishments from the previous year were recognized. Norah Jones and her song \"Don't Know Why\" were the main recipients of the night, garnering six Grammys, including four major awards: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist, plus Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album. Songwriter Jesse Harris received the Song of the Year award for his work on \"Don't Know Why.\" Simon and Garfunkel reunited to open the show performing \"The Sound of Silence\".\nThe Bee Gees were presented with the \"Legend Award\", only 42 days after the sudden death of Maurice Gibb. The award was received by the surviving brothers, Barry and Robin. During Barry's speech, he made mention of Maurice's widow Yvonne and their children Adam and Sami, and in a heartfelt, gracious and tearful moment announced that he and Robin were presenting the award to Maurice. It was then accepted by Adam, at Barry's request, on behalf of his late father, his mother and his sister.\nPerformers\n* Simon and Garfunkel - \"Sound of Silence\"\n* Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band - \"The Rising\"\n* No Doubt - \"Underneath It All\", \"Hella Good\"\n* Eminem & Proof - \"Lose Yourself\"\n* Faith Hill - \"Cry\"\n* Dixie Chicks - \"Landslide\"\n* Nelly & Kelly Rowland - \"Hot In Herre\", \"Dilemma\"\n* Ashanti - \"Dreams\"\n* N'Sync - Tribute to Bee Gees\n* James Taylor\n* Coldplay - \"Politik\"\n* Sheryl Crow & Kid Rock\n* John Mayer - \"Your Body Is A Wonderland\"\n* Vanessa Carlton - \"A Thousand Miles\"\n* Norah Jones - \"Don't Know Why\"\n* Avril Lavigne - \"Sk8er Boi\"\n* Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, Tony Kanal, Little Steven, Bruce Springsteen, Pete Thomas - \"London Calling\" (tribute to Joe Strummer)\nPresenters\n* Dustin Hoffman - Introduces Simon & Garfunkel\n* Lou Reed & Dave Grohl - Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals\n* Tony Bennett & Joe Pantoliano - Introduces Norah Jones\n* Kylie Minogue & Justin Timberlake - Best Pop Vocal Album\n* Marc Anthony - Pays tribute to Tito Puente, a Lifetime Award recipient, and introduces Faith Hill\n* Paul Shaffer - Introduces Vanessa Carlton\n* Herbie Hancock, Martina McBride & Raphael Saadiq - Best Country Album\n* Kim Cattrall & P.
