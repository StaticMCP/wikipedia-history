The school, established in 1983, but with a timeline to 1589, is an amalgamation of the previous Gainsborough High School and Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School.\nHistory\nAlthough the details are unclear, Gainsborough appears to have had a small grammar school from the 15th century provided by the local clergy. Claims have been made that several of the Pilgrim Fathers received their early education in the school and among its alumni was John Robinson and John Smyth; there is no known historical evidence to support this claim, which was based on the mistaken assumption that there were no other grammar schools in the area. Lessons were first held in a room above the porch of the original All Saints church.\nIn 1589 Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter to Sir Robert Somerscale to establish Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for boys, with the express purpose of providing an education in the classics and divinity for the sons of the emerging middle class in the town. In 1828, the Chartist poet Thomas Cooper sought to set up a rival grammar school, but failed, and saw his school absorbed by Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School.\nFrom 1795 until 1940 Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School was located on Cox's Hill, at what is now the Hickman Hill Hotel. An equivalent grammar school for girls, Gainsborough High School, was founded in 1920. In 1940 both schools moved to the present Morton Terrace site, on which the local technical college was also based. Under the Tripartite System they became fully state grammar schools, having been fee-paying before then. The schools merged to form Queen Elizabeth's High School in 1982.\nBefore amalgamation Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School had 4 houses: Cox (red), Elliott (white), Hickman (Blue) and Marshall (green).\nOn 7 December 2012, the school was host to the BBC Radio 4 show 'Any Questions?', which was held in the Upper School Hall.\nIn 2013, following a lack of funding which affected most Grammar Schools, a £2&nbsp;million grant from the Local Authority and a £500,000 grant from central government was given in order to expand and renovate the school. This enabled the construction of a new sports hall, a two-storey teaching block and the refurbishment of College House.\nOn 7 March 2014 the Sixth Form Centre was relocated to the 1872-built College House building, as the previous centre had become crowded\nAdmissions from neighbouring counties\nBy 1986 10% of admissions came from Nottinghamshire; the wrong side of the River Trent. By 1988, seven in the first form were from Scunthorpe, described as a 'brain drain'. Scunthorpe's comprehensive schools were not popular. Scunthorpe parents also chose the secondary school in Epworth, Lincolnshire.\nAdmissions\nThe school annually admits 180 students into Year 7 and 125 into Year 12; around 1000 students make up the lower school (of those aged 11–16) and another 250 make up the sixth-form (16–18). Approximately 700 of those attending are girls and 500 are boys. A number of external pupils are also admitted to the sixth-form each year.\nCurriculum\nPupils at Queen Elizabeth's High School usually take ten or eleven GCSE examinations in Year Eleven, and dependent on satisfactory grades can enter the sixth-form to take four A-Level qualifications.\nMembers of Queen Elizabeth's High School and Gainsborough Choral Society perform in an annual Christmas carol concert, \"Carols for All.\" Phillip Ainsworth (previous Head of Music) conducts.\nMusic is historically important to QEHS, with the Anglican choral composer W. Stanley Vann being head of Music during the 1930s. Recent drama productions have included Return to the Forbidden Planet, Godspell and Disco Inferno.\nExtracurricular activities\nCricket, rugby, football, and athletics are the main boys' sports, and hockey, netball, tennis and athletics the main girls' sports.\nInter-school matches are played against other grammar schools in Lincolnshire, and a few public schools and secondary modern schools.\nDebating teams have won local competitions, including the Youth Speaks Competition, and have competed in a national competition.\nOfsted inspections and school performance\nAn Ofsted inspection in 2006 described the school as \"outstanding\". The 2021 inspection however described the school as \"requires improvement\".\nLeague tables for Lincolnshire released by the BBC rate Queen Elizabeth's High School overall 10th: ratings based on English Baccalaureate results place the school joint ninth, for A/AS-level points per pupil third, and adjusted for Value Added nineteenth. The BBC A-Level league tables rank the school second best in Lincolnshire.\nHeadteachers\n* E W Lockwood, 1940\n* L.A.
