On 9 October 2006, the Home Secretary John Reid announced the implementation of Operation Safeguard as the prison population had reached 79,843 leaving only 125 spaces.\nThe policy is supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers, it outlined a list of criteria for prisoners who should not be held in police station cells under Safeguard, including among others: women, juveniles and those with mental health problems or those involved in a Crown Court trial.\nAlternatives to Operation Safeguard\nThe government has considered several alternatives to Safeguard, including repatriating foreign prisoners to their home country, with a financial incentive. Other ways of reducing the prison population include:\n* Early executive release\n* Deportation of foreign prisoners\n* Use of a prison ship\nLord Phillips, the former Lord Chief Justice, also suggested a greater use of community sentences could reduce the pressure on prisons.\nSee also\n* United Kingdom prison population\n* Prison\n* Prison reform\n* List of prisons in the United Kingdom\n* Prison categories (UK)\n* Prison Officers' Association\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/ UK Government: Home Office]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040117025237/http://www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk/ UK Government: Prison Service]\n* [http://www.poauk.org.uk/ Prison Officers' Association]"
