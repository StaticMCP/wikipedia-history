The airfield was used by both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Air Force during its lifetime and was involved during the Battle of Britain, as well as other important aerial battles during the Second World War and the early stages of aerial usage in war in the First World War.\nHistory\nFirst World War\nDuring the First World War the airfield was called RFC Folkestone until 29 December 1916 and RFC Hawkinge later on. The only squadron present during this period was No. 25 Squadron RFC between 19 and 20 February 1916 with Vickers F.B.5, Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2B and Morane-Saulnier L.\nAn Aircraft Acceptance Park was in residence between 27 July 1917 and 12 October 1917 before being renamed to No. 12 Aircraft Acceptance Park which stayed until May 1919.\nInter-war years\nBetween the wars a number of squadrons were posted here:\n* 2 Squadron RAF between 30 November 1935 and 29 September 1939 with Hawker Audaxes, Hawker Hectors and Westland Lysander I .\n* 17 Squadron RAF reformed here on 1 April 1924 using Sopwith Snipes and Hawker Woodcock II before moving to RAF Upavon on 14 October 1926.\n* 25 Squadron RAF reformed here on 26 April 1920 with the Snipe before moving to Turkey on 28 September 1922. However the squadron returned on 3 October 1923 still with the Snipe but added the Gloster Grebe I, Armstrong Whitworth Siskin IIIA, Hawker Fury Mk I and II, Hawker Demon and the Gloster Gladiators before being posted to RAF Northolt on 26 September 1938. 25 Squadron returned again on 12 October 1938 and started using the Bristol Blenheim IF before the squadron returned to Northolt on 22 August 1939.\n* 38 Squadron RAF from 14 February 1919 until 4 July 1919 when it was disbanded as a cadre.\n* 56 Squadron RAF reformed here on 1 November 1922 with the Snipe before moving to RAF Biggin Hill on 7 May 1923.\n* 83 Squadron RAF between 14 February 1919 and September 1919 as a cadre.\n* 120 Squadron RAF between 20 February 1919 and 17 July 1919 with the Airco DH.9.\nSecond World War\nIt was from Hawkinge that air liaison was maintained between the Royal Air Force and the British Expeditionary Force during the fighting in France and the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940. As long as communications remained open targets were selected in accordance with requests from the BEF and Hawkinge was one of the advanced re-fuelling bases to provide maximum range for operations over France. It was a fighter airfield for squadrons of No. 11 Group, and was so severely damaged by German bombing and machine gun attacks during the Battle of Britain that it had to be abandoned temporarily.\nHawkinge Cemetery is near the site of the aerodrome and most of the 95 Second World War casualties buried there were airmen. About a quarter were killed during the Battle of Britain. Most of the war graves are in a special plot east of the chapel, including 59 German graves, which are together in a group at the south-eastern corner.\nA number of squadrons were posted here:\n* 1 Squadron RAF as a detachment between 18 June 1940 and 23 July 1940 with the Hawker Hurricane I.\n* 3 Squadron RAF as a detachment between 13 November 1939 and 28 January 1940 with the Hurricane I.\n* 16 Squadron RAF between 17 February 1940 and 13 April 1940 with the Lysander II.\n* 25 Squadron RAF returned during the Second World War on 10 May 1940 staying for two days still with the Blenheim IF.\n* 26 (South African) Squadron RAF between 6 October 1944 and 11 October 1944 with the Hurricane IIC.\n* 41 Squadron RAF initially between 30 June 1942 and 8 July 1942 with the Supermarine Spitfire VB then again between 12 April 1943 and 21 May 1943 with the Spitfire XII.\n* 65 (East India) Squadron RAF between 30 June 1942 and 7 July 1942 with the Spitfire VB.\n* 66 Squadron RAF between 8 October 1942 and 9 October 1942 with the Spitfire VB & VC.\n* 79 (Madras Presidency) Squadron RAF between 1 July 1940 and 11 July 1940 with the Hurricane I.\n* 91 (Nigeria) Squadron RAF reformed here on 9 January 1941 with the Spitfire IIA & VB versions until 2 October 1942, however the squadron returned 9 October 1942 this time staying until 23 November 1942. 91 Squadron returned again on 11 January 1943 still with the Spitfire and stayed until 11 January 1943.
