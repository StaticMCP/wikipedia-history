The town is located on the New England Highway between Warwick and Toowoomba.\nHistory\nGiabal (also known as Paiamba, Gomaingguru) is an Australian Aboriginal language.

Its name is believed to derive from an Aboriginal word \"gnarrallah\", meaning waterhole or swampy place.\nFollowing European settlement, the history of the area is entwined with two famous pastoral homesteads in the vicinity of Allora: Glengallan and Talgai. Both properties raised sheep.\nThe original \"Talgai\" run was taken up by E. E. Dalrymple in 1840. The creek that runs through Allora is named in his honour. Built in 1868 for the Clark family, Talgai Homestead stood on . The homestead is built of sandstone and covers sixty squares. It is now a bed and breakfast.\nAllora Post Office opened on 31 March 1863.\nIn 1866, a Wesleyan Methodist church was established in Allora. Improvements were made in 1875.

In 1914 it separated from the Clifton Shire to become a shire in its own right as the Shire of Allora, which was administered from the Shire's offices initially on the corner of Warwick and Forde Streets in Allora, and then at 78 Herbert Street in Allora. In 1994, the Shire of Allora was amalgamated into the Shire of Warwick.\nIn 1873 a permanent Presbyterian congregation was established with the arrival of Reverend Thomas Kingsford as a permanent minister. In November 1874, the congregation commenced fundraising to build a church. In September 1876, they were seeking to buy an acre of land for the church. In February 1879, they called for tenders to build the church. On Sunday 28 September 1879, the church was opened by Reverend W. Budge. It faced Forde Street opposite the town hall. In 1906, it was decided to build a new Presbyterian church facing Warwick Street opposite the Allora railway station. The foundation blocks were laid on Wednesday 25 July 1906 under the supervision of Reverend D. McLellan with over 300 people in attendance. The new church was officially opened on Wednesday 21 November 1906 by Dr Coulston, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Australia. The architect was Alexander Brown Wilson of Brisbane and the contractor was Henry William Stay of Allora. In October 1912, the 1879 church building was relocated to become the Presbyterian church in Goomburra, which is  east of Allora. The relocation of the church required two traction engines and took ten days to negotiate difficult terrain and other problems.\nIn 1886, the first fossil evidence of early human occupation in the area, the Talgai Skull, was found on Talgai Homestead, embedded in the wall of Dalrymple Creek. Radiocarbon dating suggests the Talgai skull is between 9,000 and 11,000 years old.
