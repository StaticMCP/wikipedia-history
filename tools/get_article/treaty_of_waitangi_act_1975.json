The tribunal is empowered to investigate possible breaches of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi by the New Zealand Government or any state-controlled body, occurring after 1975. It was also empowered to recommend, but not enforce, remedies.\nThe treaty had been a focus of Māori activism for several years, but many Māori were disappointed in the efficacy of the Waitangi Tribunal. Most of the significant breaches of the treaty, such as land confiscation in the New Zealand Wars, had occurred in the nineteenth century, and the tribunal was initially in 1975 powerless to investigate these. The act was amended in 1985 to enable it to consider claims dating back to 1840.\nPurpose\nOn 8 November 1974, Matiu Rata introduced the Treaty of Waitangi Bill in Parliament and stated: }}\nThe long title of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 states that it is:\n}}\nThe preamble to the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 states:\n}}\nAmendments\n1985 jurisdiction extended to 1840\nIn 1985 the act was amended to give the Waitangi Tribunal the authority to consider claims dating back to 1840, when the Treaty of Waitangi was signed. It also enlarged the tribunal's membership to enable it to handle the increased number of claims. It also required the tribunal to have a Māori majority, although this requirement was removed in 1988.\nThe 1985 amendment considerably broadened the scope of the tribunal's inquiries and led to ongoing debate over the appropriate response by the Crown to the findings and recommendations of the tribunal (see Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements). It was part of the Fourth Labour government's policy of giving greater acknowledgment to the treaty, as was the inclusion of references to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in other legislation, such as the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986. This amendment was one of the most important steps towards making the treaty relevant in New Zealand law and society.\n1988 tribunal membership and hearings\nThis amendment further expanded the tribunal's membership and abolished the requirement for a Māori majority. It also enabled different groups of tribunal members to investigate different claims simultaneously.\n1988 covenants on claimed State owned enterprise land\nThis amendment came about following a court case in which the government was found to be ignoring the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi by attempting to sell state-owned land which might be subject to treaty claims. The amendment enabled covenants to be placed on such land stating that it might be claimed back by the tribunal, even if in private hands. It also gave the tribunal the power to compulsorily acquire such land. This is the only instance in which the tribunal is able to issue legally binding orders.\n1993 prohibition on recommendations over private land\nThis amendment came about following the controversial recommendation in the Waitangi Tribunal's Te Roroa Report that the Crown purchase an area of private land for return to claimants in a settlement. The owners of the land argued that the recommendation devalued their properties. The amendment prohibits the tribunal from recommending the return or purchase by the Crown of any private land, other than that covered by the covenants noted above.\n2006 all historical claims to be lodged by September 2008\nThis amends section 6 of the Treaty of Waitangi Act to set a closing date of 1 September 2008 for submitting historical treaty claims, defined as those relating to acts or omissions of the Crown prior to 21 September 1992.  It allows existing claims to be amended and does not affect the settlement of historical claims that have already been lodged, or the ability to lodge claims relating to grievances relating to acts or omissions after September 1992.\nOther amendments\nLegislation implementing various historical treaty settlements amends section 6 of the Treaty of Waitangi Act to exclude the jurisdiction of the Waitangi Tribunal from further considering the historical claims of the group receiving the settlement.\n2014 Waitangi Tribunal findings\nIn response to the Te Paparahi o Te Raki (Wai 1040) inquiry, the Waitangi Tribunal concluded in 2014 that Māori never conceded their sovereignty in the 1840 treaty as part of Stage One of their inquiry. Stage Two of the inquiry will consider events after 1840.\n2025 review\nIn early May 2025, Minister of Māori Development Tama Potaka announced that an \"independent technical advisory group\" would review the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975, focusing on the scope of the Waitangi Tribunal. The  Sixth National Government had committed to reviewing the scope of the Waitangi Tribunal as part of its coalition agreements with the ACT and New Zealand First parties.\nParliamentary debates\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.395 (1974), pp.&nbsp;5725–9.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.401 (1975), pp.&nbsp;4342–6, 4495-500.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.402 (1975), pp.&nbsp;5406–8.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.460 (1984–85), pp.&nbsp;2702–13, 6059-83, 8626-31.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.485 (1987), pp.&nbsp;1715–34.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.488 (1988), pp.&nbsp;3970–81, 4017-28.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.489 (1988), pp.&nbsp;4560–86, 4775-91.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.492 (1988), pp.&nbsp;6611–16.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.494 (1988), pp.&nbsp;7927–33, 8217-24.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.495 (1988), pp.&nbsp;8525–35, 8861-72.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.632 (2006), pp.&nbsp;3951–69.\n*New Zealand Parliamentary Debates vol.636 (2006), pp.&nbsp;6965–84, 7021-33.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/towaa19851985n148306/ Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1985] at the NZLII database\n* [http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/towaa19881988n233306/ Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1988] at the NZLII database\n* [http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/towea19881988n105423/ Treaty of Waitangi (State Enterprises) Act 1988] at the NZLII database\n* [http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/towaa19931993n92306/ Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 1993] at the NZLII database\n* [http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/towaa20062006n77306/ Treaty of Waitangi Amendment Act 2006] at the NZLII database"
