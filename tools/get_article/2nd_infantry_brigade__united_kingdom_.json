In April 1943, during the fighting in Tunisia, Lieutenant Willward Alexander Sandys-Clarke of the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) was posthumously awarded the brigades' only Victoria Cross (VC) of the war.\nOrder of battle\nThe 2nd Infantry Brigade was constituted as follows during the war:\n* 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)\n* 2nd Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment\n* 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (left 7 March 1940)\n* 2nd Infantry Brigade Anti-Tank Company (formed 3 September 1939, disbanded 28 December 1940)\n* 6th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders (from 7 March 1940)\nCommanders\nThe following officers commanded 2nd Infantry Brigade during the war:\n* Brig.

Fletcher, and was reformed in October 1981.\nBy 1984 it was in South-Eastern District.\nIn the House of Commons on 8 January 2002 the Secretary of State for Defence said that \"The two light infantry brigade headquarters (52 Lowland) Brigade and 2 (South East) Brigade) are being re-roled from regional brigade headquarters to provide better command and control arrangements for the light infantry role battalions, all of which are currently deployable. Thus the reorganisation of the two brigades will not result in an increase in the number of deployable troops. The change will bring greater coherence to the way that these units prepare for operations, through improved co-ordination of training\".\nFollowing broad reorganisation under the Future Army Structures, 2nd Infantry Brigade was renamed 2nd (South East) Brigade in 2007. The name was in line with its revised role as a Regional Brigade, responsible largely for Territorial Army units. The brigade became part of the United Kingdom's Support Command as the 2nd (South East) Brigade. It was not listed under the Army 2020 plan. In December 2014 the Brigade merged with 145 (South) Brigade to form Headquarters 11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.army.mod.uk//structure/28215.aspx 2 (South East) Brigade] - on British Army official website\n* [http://www.army.mod.uk/pwrr Official site for the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (The Tigers)]\n* [http://www.army.mod.uk/103bnreme Official site for 103 Battalion REME (V)]\n* [http://www.army.mod.uk//infantry/regiments/24001.aspx Official site for the Royal Gurkha Rifles]\n* [http://www.army.mod.uk/operations-deployments/22792.aspx The British Army in Brunei] - official website\n*"
