It was released as part of the series America Undercover.\nSynopsis\nThe documentary painted a hopeless and pessimistic view of the violence in the city. At the time Little Rock was one of the most dangerous cities in the country. Sitting at the intersection of two major interstates from Los Angeles and New York, Little Rock had become a haven for drug trafficking. There were prominent gang presences of Bloods, Crips and Hoover's Folk Nation.\nPost release\nThe documentary brought much attention to the crime problems in Little Rock. Following documentary, the Little Rock Police force was quadrupled. As a result, the street gang problem was nearly eradicated.\nSteve Nawojczyk was the county coroner during the Gang War years, and was featured in the documentary. He continues to work in the intervention and prevention of youth gangs.  While ''Gang War: Bangin' in Little Rock'' followed Nawojczyk while he did his grim work as the county's chief coroner, it also showed his attempts at reducing the record-high homicide rate in Arkansas' capital city.\nBack in the Hood: Gang War 2 (2004)\nThere was a follow-up documentary released in 2004 called Back in the Hood: Gang War 2.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
