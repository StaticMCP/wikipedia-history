Since her death, various myths and legends surrounding her story have preserved her as a prominent figure in folklore, literature, music, film, games and toys.\nIn folklore and literature\nThe case of Countess Elizabeth Báthory inspired numerous stories and fairy tales. 18th and 19th century writers liberally added or omitted elements of the narrative. The most common motif of these works was that of the countess bathing in her victims' blood in order to retain beauty or youth. Frequently, the cruel countess would discover the secret of blood bathing when she slapped a female servant in rage, splashing parts of her own skin with blood. Upon removal of the blood, that portion of skin would seem younger and more beautiful than before.\nThis legend appeared in print for the first time in 1729, in the Jesuit scholar László Turóczi's Tragica Historia, the first written account of the Báthory case.\nWhen quoting him in his 1742 history book, Matthias Bel was sceptical about this particular detail, he nevertheless helped the legend to spread. Subsequent writers of history and fiction alike often identified vanity as the sole motivation for Báthory's crimes.\nModern historians Radu Florescu and Raymond T. McNally have concluded that the theory Báthory murdered on account of her vanity sprang up from contemporary prejudices about gender roles. Women were not believed to be capable of violence for its own sake.  At the beginning of the 19th century, the vanity motif was first questioned, and sadistic pleasure was considered a far more plausible motive for Báthory's crimes. In 1817, the witness accounts (which had surfaced in 1765) were published for the first time, demonstrating that the bloodbaths or blood seeker for vanity aspect of Báthory's crimes were legend rather than fact.\nVampire myth\nThe emergence of the bloodbath or blood seeker for vanity myth coincided with the vampire scares that haunted Europe in the early 18th century, reaching even into educated and scientific circles, but the strong connection between the bloodbath or blood seeker myth and the vampiric myth was not made until the 1970s. The first connections were made to promote works of fiction by linking them to the already commercially successful Dracula story. Thus, a 1970 movie based on Báthory and the bloodbath or blood seeker for vanity myth was titled Countess Dracula.\nSome Báthory biographers, McNally in particular, have tried to establish the bloodbath myth and the historical Elizabeth Báthory as a source of influence for Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, pointing to similarities in settings and motifs and the fact that Stoker might have read about her. This theory is strongly disputed by author Elizabeth Miller.\nMeanwhile, Báthory has become an influence for modern vampire literature and vampire films. The story, while retaining the essential facts, receives an imaginative interpretation in the horror novelist Syra Bond's Cold Blood.\nLiterature\n* The Dracula Archives (1971) by Raymond Rudorff is a vampire novel that features Báthory.\n* Our Lady of Pain (1974) by John Blackburn is a supernatural horror novel whose plot revolves around a play about Báthory being staged in modern Britain.\n* He Who Fights with Monsters 6: A LitRPG Adventure (2022) by Shirtaloon is a LitRPG adventure novel, which introduces a gold-rank vampire named Elizabeth, who along with other vampire of her power rank are awakened from centuries of slumber when Earth's levels of magic begin to rise and who sets out to establish a vampire kingdom throughout large swathes of Europe. Her power and cleverness allow her to deceive the protagonist Jason Asano and escape him when he attempts to betray and kill her and her fellows in an pocket dimension. She later establishes an empire in which humans are herded into camps and exsanguination centers, firmly denying that she was really Elizabeth Báthory (and killing anyone who continued to assert this) and managing to survive longer than most vampire lords - at least until Asano manages to return from his adventures in a parallel reality far more powerful than her.\nTelevision\n* A version of Báthory who has survived to the time of the French Revolution is the main antagonist in the 2023 Netflix series Castlevania: Nocturne.\nFilm\nThere have been numerous films about Countess Elizabeth Báthory:\n* 1970 – Necropolis (Franco Brocani), with Viva Auder as \"Countess Bathory\"\n* 1971 – Countess Dracula (Peter Sasdy), with Ingrid Pitt as \"Countess Elisabeth\"\n* 1971 – Daughters of Darkness (Harry Kümel), with Delphine Seyrig as \"Countess Bathory\"\n* 1973 – Legend of Blood Castle (Ceremonia sangrienta) (Jorge Grau), with Lucia Bosé as \"Erzebeth Bathory\"\n* 1973 – Curse of the Devil (Carlos Aured), with Maria Silva as \"Elizabeth Bathory\"\n* 1973 – Immoral Tales (Walerian Borowczyk), with Paloma Picasso as \"Elisabeth Bathory\"\n* 1979 – Thirst (Rod Hardy), starring Chantal Contouri as a lineal descendant of Elizabeth Bathory\n* 1980 – Mama Dracula (Boris Szulzinger), with Louise Fletcher as \"Mama Dracula\"\n* 1981 – Night of the Werewolf (Paul Naschy), with Julia Saly as \"Countess Elisabeth Bathory\"\n* 2004 - Eternal (Wilhelm Liebenberg and Federico Sanchez), with Caroline Néron as \"Elizabeth Kane\"\n* 2005 – Night Fangs (Ricardo Islas), with Marina Muzychenko as \"Countess Elizabeth Bathory\"\n* 2006 – Stay Alive (William Brent Bell), with Maria Kalinina as the \"Countess\"\n* 2006 – ''Demon's Claw (Lloyd A.
