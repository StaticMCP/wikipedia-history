The musical premiered in 1949 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950.  The show was a critical and box office hit and has since enjoyed many successful revivals and tours, also spawning a 1958 film and other adaptations.\nThe original Broadway production won ten Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Score and Best Libretto, and it is the only musical production ever to have won all four Tony Awards for acting.  The 2008 Broadway revival was a strong success, winning numerous theatre awards.  Its seven Tonys included Best Musical Revival.  Sher and Szot also won Tonys, and the production won in all four design categories, also receiving nominations for choreography and for the performances of O'Hara, Burstein and Ables Sayre.  It also won five Drama Desk Awards, including Outstanding Musical Revival.  The late Robert Russell Bennett was recognized that season for \"his historic contribution to American musical theatre in the field of orchestrations, as represented on Broadway this season by Rodgers and Hammerstein’s South Pacific.\"\nAwards and nominations\nOriginal Broadway production\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"20%\"| Award Ceremony\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"25%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" align=\"center\" | 1950\n|Pulitzer Prize\n| colspan=\"2\"| Drama\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\"| Tony Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n|\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\n| Ezio Pinza\n|\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical\n| Mary Martin\n|\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical\n| Myron McCormick\n|\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical\n| Juanita Hall\n|\n|-\n| Best Producer\n| Oscar Hammerstein II, Richard Rodgers, Leland Hayward and Joshua Logan\n|\n|-\n| Best Director\n| Joshua Logan\n|\n|-\n| Best Libretto\n| Oscar Hammerstein II\n|\n|-\n| Best Original Score\n| Richard Rodgers\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | 1949\n| Best Scenic Design\n| Jo Mielziner\n|\n|-\n| New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards\n| Best Musical\n| Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II and Joshua Logan\n|\n|}\n2001 London revival\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"20%\"| Award Ceremony\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"25%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2001\n| Laurence Olivier Award\n| Best Actor in a Musical\n| Philip Quast\n|\n|}\n2001 Television film\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"20%\"| Award Ceremony\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"25%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| 2001\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Emmy Award\n| Outstanding Music Direction\n| Paul Bogaev\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Single Camera Sound Mixing for a Miniseries or a Movie\n| Guntis Sics, Rick Ash, Joe Earle and Joel Moss\n|\n|}\n2008 Broadway revival\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"20%\"| Award Ceremony\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"25%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"27\" align=\"center\"| 2008\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Drama Desk Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Outstanding Revival of a Musical\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Actor in a Musical\n| Paulo Szot\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Actress in a Musical\n| Kelli O'Hara\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical\n| Danny Burstein\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Director\n| Bartlett Sher\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Set Design\n| Michael Yeargan\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Sound Design\n| Scott Lehrer\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Lighting Design\n| Donald Holder\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Outer Critics Circle Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Outstanding Revival of a Musical\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Actor in a Musical\n| Paulo Szot\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Actress in a Musical\n| Kelli O'Hara\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical\n| Danny Burstein\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Director of a Musical\n| Bartlett Sher\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Choreographer\n| Christopher Gattelli\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Set Design\n| Michael Yeargan\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Costume Design\n| Catherine Zuber\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| Tony Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Revival of a Musical\n|\n|-\n| Best Direction of a Musical\n| Bartlett Sher\n|\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\n| Paulo Szot\n|\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical\n| Kelli O'Hara\n|\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical\n| Danny Burstein\n|\n|-\n| Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical\n| Loretta Ables Sayre\n|\n|-\n| Best Choreography\n| Christopher Gattelli\n|\n|-\n| Best Scenic Design\n| Michael Yeargan\n|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n| Catherine Zuber\n|\n|-\n| Best Lighting Design\n| Donald Holder\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound Design\n| Scott Lehrer\n|\n|}\n2011 London revival\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"20%\"| Award\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"25%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| 2012\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Laurence Olivier Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical Revival\n|\n|-\n| Best Actor in a Musical\n| Paulo Szot\n|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n| Catherine Zuber\n|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\n*Nolan, Frederick.
