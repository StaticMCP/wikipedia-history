The song was certified gold in Australia in 2025.\nWhen asked about the themes behind the song, vocalist Fergus Lunacre told Triple J \"it's about that little dark voice inside your head… Because we're all creeps.\"\nThe song was voted in at number 48 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2016.\nAt the APRA Music Awards of 2018, the song was nominated for Rock Work of the Year.\nReception\nAM Rap via Community Broadcasting Association of Australia said \"The track lures you in with its opening, soothing, psychedelic guitar notes and Fergus Linacre's tender, soulful vocals, before its jaws close down around you in the form of thunderous drum rolls and a crunching, stadium-sized bass line.\"\nZanda Wilson from Music Feeds said \"The new track is a slow burner that builds as the lyrics profess the desire for a forbidden and unobtainable love. Moody guitar builds to a harder, grungy riff which peaks in a raucous guitar solo right in the tune's mid section.\"\nMusic video\nThe music video was direct by Alex Laksa and features Mietta Gornall, Olivia Paine, Kristy Lee Donovan, Georgia Taylor and Kalman Warhaft.\nCertifications\nReferences"
