Elizabeth was in fact better connected to powerful German rulers than her future husband: a descendant of earlier monarchs, for example Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, she was also a niece of the Bavarian dukes, Austria's important neighbors.\nDuchess and Queen\nElisabeth was married in Vienna on 20 December 1274 to Count Albert I of Habsburg, eldest son and heir of the newly elected Rudolf I, King of the Romans, thus becoming daughter-in-law of the King of the Romans and Emperor-to-be. After Rudolf had defeated his rival King Ottokar II of Bohemia in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, he invested his son Albert with the duchies of Austria and Styria at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg on 17 December 1282.\nAlbert initially had to share the rule with his younger brother Rudolf II, who nevertheless had to waive his rights according to the Treaty of Rheinfelden the next year. Duke Albert and Elizabeth solidified their rule in what was to become the Habsburg \"hereditary lands\", also with the help of Elizabeth's father Meinhard, who in his turn was created Duke of Carinthia by King Rudolf I in 1286.\nElizabeth was described as shrewd and enterprising, in possession of some commercial talents. The construction of the Saline plant in Salzkammergut goes back to her suggestion.\nUpon the death of Albert's father in 1291, the princes elected Count Adolf of Nassau German king, while Duke Albert himself became entangled in internal struggles with the Austrian nobility. Not until Adolf's deposition in 1298, Elizabeth's husband was finally elected King of the Romans on 23 June 1298. Two weeks later, Adolf was defeated and killed in the Battle of Göllheim. In 1299, Elizabeth was crowned Queen of the Romans in Nuremberg.\nLater life\nOn 1 May 1308 Albert was murdered by his nephew John Parricida near Windisch, Swabia (in modern Switzerland). Afterward Elisabeth had the Poor Clare monastery of Königsfelden erected at the site, where she also died on 28 October 1312 and was also buried. Today her bones rest at Saint Paul's Abbey in Carinthia.\nIssue\nElizabeth's and Albert's children were:\n# Anna (1275, Vienna &ndash; 19 March 1327, Breslau).\n## married in Graz ca. 1295 to Margrave Herman, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel (ca. 1275 &ndash; 1308);\n## married in Breslau 1310 to Duke Heinrich VI of Breslau (1294-1335).\n# Agnes (18 May 1281 &ndash; 10 June 1364, Königsfelden)\n## married in Vienna on 13 February 1296 to King Andrew III of Hungary (ca. 1265-1301).\n# Rudolf III (ca. 1282 &ndash; 4 July 1307), married but line extinct.
