Its collections are primarily intended for research and are, thus, not accessible to the public. A limited number of fossils from the collection is on display in the SUMPHG, and is one of the primary localities for storing fossils collected in Bulgaria. The original fossils, around which the current collection has grown, were those gathered by the first Bulgarian state geologist Georgi Zlatarski (1854 - 1909) and those purchased from Dr. A. Krantz.  Later specimens collected by doctoral students and as part of the Bulgarian geological surveys were added.\nFaculty\nMany notable Bulgarian paleontologists have worked at SUMPHG, including Peter Bakalov, Vassil Tzankov, Ivan Nikolov, Natalia Dimitrova, Milka Entcheva, Emilia Kojumdjieva, Nonka Motekova, Stoycho Breskovski, Angel Pamouktchiev et al.\nPublic access\nAdmission is free to the museum for all visitors. The museum is open 10 am - 12 am, 1 pm - 4 pm Monday to Friday.  It is closed on Saturdays and Sundays.  SUMPHG is an important venue for widening interest in paleontology, evolutionary biology and Earth sciences.\nThe museum logo is based on the Deinotherium skeleton displayed by the entrance.\nGallery\nFile:Deinotherium thraceiensis - SUMPHG.jpg|Deinotherium thraceiensis (Kovachev, 1964), Miocene, Ezerovo, Plovdiv District - The Entrance hall of the Sofia University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\" Museum of Paleontology and Historical Geology\nFile:Parapuzosia Doubreei (de Grossouvre, 1894), Santonian, Shumen - SUMPHG.jpg|Parapuzosia daubreei (de Grossouvre, 1894), Santonian, Shumen in the Main Hall of the Sofia  University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\" Museum of Paleontology and Historical Geology\nFile:Samples of the Krantz paleontological collection of the Sofia University 'St. Kliment Ohridski' Museum of Paleontology and Historical Geology.jpg|Samples of the Krantz paleontological collection of the Sofia University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\" Museum of Paleontology and Historical Geology\nExhibits of geologic eras and periods\nImage:The Neogene period at the SUMPHG.jpg|The Neogene period\nImage: Paleogenе - SUMPHG.jpg|The Paleogene period\nImage: The Upper Cretaceous period - SUMPHG.jpg|The Upper Cretaceous series/epoch - SUMPHG\nImage: Lower Cretaceous period - SUMPHG.jpg|The Lower Cretaceous series/epoch - SUMPHG\nImage: The Jurassic period - SUMPHG.jpg|The Jurassic period - SUMPHG\nImage: The Triassic period - SUMPHG.jpg|The Triassic period - SUMPHG\nImage: The Paleozoic era - SUMPHG.jpg|The Paleozoic era - SUMPHG\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\nSee also\n*\n* National Museum of Natural History, Bulgaria"
