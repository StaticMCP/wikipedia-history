He married Jane Maria Brooks; a son, Edward King Cox, would also serve in the New South Wales Parliament. Edward Cox inherited the semi-complete Fernhill at Mulgoa from his father, and also had a number of squatting properties. He was a non-elective member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1851 to 1855, and a member of the reconstituted Council from 1866 until his death in 1868.\nReferences"
