A revised version of the failed bill was passed the following year.\nSubsequent developments\nThe whole act, except for the preamble, was repealed by section 1 of, and the schedule to, the Statute Law Revision Act 1861 (24 & 25 Vict. c. 101).\nThe preamble, so far as unrepealed, was repealed by section 1 of, and part I of the schedule to, the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969.\nSee also\n*Prerogative\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*'Charles II, 1661: An Act declaring the sole Right of the Militia to be in King and for the present ordering & disposing the same.', Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628-80 (1819), pp.&nbsp;308–09.
