It is home to Yokangassi Airport, also known as Nkayi Airport.\nHistory\nSituated in the fertile Niari Valley, the town was named Jacob in 1887. That was the name of the French engineer who led the first mission to select the best route for the Congo-Ocean Railway. Then the city  began growing thanks to the thriving sugar cane plantations led by important agroindustries. In 1975, Jacob had a population of 25,000, and its name was changed to the native one of Nkayi.\nThe city is the fourth largest town in the Republic of the Congo since 1980.\nSee also\n* Railway stations in Congo\nReferences\n* Decalo S., Thompson V. & Adloff R. 1984.
