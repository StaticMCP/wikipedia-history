The Dutch saw this as an opportunity to attack Selangor as a response to Selangor's raids on Dutch Malacca. This enraged Sultan Ibrahim of Selangor who was still governing the sultanate. Both countries signed a peace treaty which later improved relations.\nBackground\nFollowing the Dutch takeover of Malacca in 1641, Sultan Ibrahim of Selangor began to see Dutch Malacca as a threat to Selangorian territory and began raiding the city. The Dutch reacted strongly to this and asked Dirk van Hogendorp to launch a full invasion against the Selangor. Sultan Ibrahim also sympathized with Johor in their war with the Dutch for attacking Dutch Malacca in 1783 where the Dutch almost lost.\nWar\nFirst phase (1784–1785)\nOn 13 July 1784, the Dutch commander Dirk van Hogendorp with 11 warships and help from the army of the Siak Sultanate led by Raja Muhammad Ali launched a full scale attack on Kuala Selangor. The Dutch army shelled Kuala Selangor and fought Selangor soldiers coming from Sungai Selangor and were fired upon by the cannons of Sultan Ibrahim's soldiers in the fort. The Selangor military was led by a warlord named Saiyid Jaafar.\nAfter two weeks of fighting, the Dutch captured Kuala Selangor and at the same time captured the whole fortress of the Selangorian civilians. Sultan Ibrahim and his followers retreated back to Pahang and were welcomed by Treasurer Abdul Majid. The Dutch also destroyed the fort and built a new one named it \"Fort Altingsburg\" for the Dutch Governor-general and \"Fort Utrecht\" as a Dutch warship.\nSecond phase (1785–1786)\nIn Pahang, Sultan Ibrahim organized a yearlong strategy to recapture Bukit Malawati from the Dutch. Abd Majid prepared and donated equipment for war. In 1785, Sultan Ibrahim with the people of Pahang moved towards Bukit Malawati to attack and recapture it. On the night of 27 June 1785, a surprise attack was launched on Bukit Malawati. Sultan Ibrahim, who was known as an aggressive person in accordance with the identity of the Bugis, fought through the night. Weaponry used by Sultan Ibrahim's forces included daggers, spears, maces and guns. Finally the Dutch soldiers retreated and escaped by boat back to Malacca and Sultan Ibrahim returned to the throne.\nFollowing that, Dirk van Hogendorp once again went to Kuala Selangor with a larger force of 17 warships. A siege around the Selangor River was launched in July 1785. The price of rice and other necessities in Selangor rose due to the siege. The siege ended inclusively as many soldiers died due to fighting. After a year of fighting, a peace treaty was signed. It later improved relationships against both countries.\nReferences"
