In it, he holds that religion in the United States is trivialized by American law and politics, and that those with a strong religious faith are forced to bend to meet the viewpoint of a \"public faith\" which is largely faithless. Carter argues that there is a place for faith in public life, while still adhering to the separation of church and state.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?75477-1/public-displays-religion Presentation by Carter on The Culture of Disbelief, September 27, 1996], C-SPAN"
