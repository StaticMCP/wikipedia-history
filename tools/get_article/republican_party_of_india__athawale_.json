The party is a splinter group of the Republican Party of India and has its roots in the Scheduled Castes Federation led by N. Sivaraj and B. R. Ambedkar. The president of the party is Ramdas Athawale.\nHistory\nRamdas Athawale was a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council from 1990 to 1995 and a cabinet member in the Government of Maharashtra. Subsequently, he was elected to the Parliament of India, representing Mumbai North Central in the 12th Lok Sabha in 1998 and 1999 and the Pandharpur constituency from 1999 to 2004. After the 2004 election, it had a small representation in the Lok Sabha and was a constituent of the ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA). Its presence is limited to Maharashtra.\nAll factions of the RPI, except Prakash Ambedkar's Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, have united to form the Republican Party of India (United).\nIn 2011, the party aligned itself with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\nIn June 2014, Bollywood actress Rakhi Sawant joined the party, and was made the chief of the party's state women's wing.\nIn September 2015, the RPI(A) was among 16 political parties in Maharashtra whose registrations were revoked for failing to submit audited balance sheets and income tax returns since 2005. As a result, the party lost its official election symbol.\nAthawale is a Member of Parliament in the Rajya Sabha.
