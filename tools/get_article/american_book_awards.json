According to the 2010 awards press release, it is \"a writers' award given by other writers\" and \"there are no categories, no nominees, and therefore no losers.\"\nThe Award is administered by the multi-cultural focused nonprofit Before Columbus Foundation, which established it in 1978 and inaugurated it in 1980. The Award honors excellence in American literature without restriction to race, sex, ethnic background, or genre. Previous winners include novelists, social scientists, philosophers, poets, and historians such as Toni Morrison, Edward Said, MacKenzie Bezos, Isabel Allende, bell hooks, Don DeLillo, Derrick Bell, Robin Kelley, Joy Harjo and Tommy J. Curry.\nNational Book Awards\nIn 1980, the unrelated National Book Awards was renamed American Book Awards. In 1987 it was renamed back to National Book Awards. Other than having the same name during this seven-year period, the two awards have no relation.\nRecipients\n1980s\n1980\n* Douglas Woolf for Future Preconditional: A Collection\n* Edward Dorn for Hello, La Jolla\n* Jayne Cortez for Mouth on Paper\n* Leslie Marmon Silko for Ceremony\n* Mei-mei Berssenbrugge for Random Possession\n* Milton Murayama for All I Asking for Is My Body\n* Quincy Troupe for Snake Back Solos\n* Rudolfo Anaya for Tortuga, a novel\n1981\n* Alta for Shameless Hussy\n* Alan Chong Lau for Songs for Jadina\n* Bienvenido N.
