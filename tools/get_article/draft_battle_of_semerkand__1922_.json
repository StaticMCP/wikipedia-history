You need a source to explicitly state, \"sources are limited,\" and then you cite that source. Please review WP:OR, and WP:SYNTH. Further, that statement alone makes me call the entire article into question.4. We haven't even covered the battle's notability or not. I would personally recommend merging this into an article like the aforementioned Basmachi movement (or whatever you feel is most-appropriate).
