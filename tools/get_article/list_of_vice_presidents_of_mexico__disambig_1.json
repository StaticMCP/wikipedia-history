In the proposal, it was proposed that the vice president would be a direct assistant of the president, and that the vice president could also assist the Senate with voice, but without vote.\nThe PRI proposal was launched in opposition to proposals of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on electoral reforms, leading to the 2024 elections.\nSee also\n*President of Mexico\n**List of heads of state of Mexico\nReferences"
