It was released by Decca Records in June 1969 and contained ten tracks. The project contained a series of cover tunes, along with new songs. Among the new recordings were three singles: \"I Still Believe in Love\", \"My Son\" and \"When We Tried\". \"My Son\" was a letter Howard put to music written to her son who was killed in the Vietnam War. The album was given positive reception by Cash Box and Record World magazines. The album made the US country albums and its three singles reached positions on the North American country songs charts.\nBackground, recording and content\nThe wife of country music songwriter Harlan Howard, Jan Howard had her own recording career through the assistance of her husband. In 1960, she had a top 15 country single with \"The One You Slip Around With\". It was not until the mid-1960s that her recording career gained momentum. In 1966 she reached the top ten with \"Evil on Your Mind\", followed by \"For Loving You\" (a duet with Bill Anderson) and \"My Son\". The latter recording was one of the singles featured on her 1969 eponymous studio album. The project featured liner notes by Bill Anderson and consisted of ten tracks. \"My Son\" was self-penned by Howard herself and was originally written as a letter to her son who was later killed in the Vietnam War. The album also contained several cover tunes, including \"Happy State of Mind\", \"Son of a Preacher Man\", \"When the Grass Grows Over Me\", \"Ribbon of Darkness\" and \"Until My Dreams Come True\".\nRelease and critical reception\nJan Howard was released by Decca Records in June 1969 and was her seventh studio album.
