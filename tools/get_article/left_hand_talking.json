      "text": "# Left Hand Talking\n\n}}\nLeft Hand Talking is the eighth studio album by the British singer-songwriter Judie Tzuke, released in 1991.\nDespite considerable promotion and featuring a re-recording of her best known song, \"Stay with Me till Dawn\", the album failed to chart. It was the last of Tzuke's albums to be released by a major record label. Her next album, Wonderland, was released on an independent label, and all subsequent albums have been released on her own home label, Big Moon Records.\nTrack listing\n;Side one\n# \"One Day I Will Live in France\" (Judie Tzuke, Paul Muggleton, Bob Noble) – 4:25\n# \"I Could Feel You\" (Muggleton, Noble) – 3:59\n# \"Liam\" (Tzuke, Noble) – 3:50\n# \"Left Hand Talking\" (Tzuke) – 4:38\n# \"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\" (Judee Sill) – 3:35 (Judee Sill cover)\n;Side two\n# \"Stay with Me 'till Dawn\" (Tzuke, Mike Paxman) – 3:49\n# \"God Only Knows\" (Brian Wilson, Tony Asher) – 2:49 (The Beach Boys cover)\n# \"Bailey's Song\" (Tzuke, Noble) – 3:41\n# \"Calling Me Back\" (Tzuke) – 4:21\n# \"Outlaws\" (Tzuke) – 3:59\nPersonnel\n;Band members\n*Judie Tzuke – lead and backing vocals, keyboards\n*Mike Paxman – guitar, keyboards, percussion, producer, engineer\n*Bob Noble – keyboards\n*John Giblin – bass guitar, fretless bass on track 8\n*Charlie Morgan – drums, percussion\n*Paul Muggleton – keyboards, percussion, backing vocals, producer, engineer\n;Additional musicians\n*Don Snow – keyboards, guitar, backing vocals\n*Phil Palmer – acoustic and slide guitar on tracks 5, 8\n*Andy Chamberlain – keyboards on tracks 5, 7\n*Bobby Paterson – bass guitar on track 3\n*Andy Sheppard – soprano saxophone on track 4\n*Nicolette L'Adventure – backing vocals on track 1\n;Production\n*Matt Howe, Heidi Cannavo, Craig Sullivan – assistant engineers\n*Stephen W Tayler – mixing\nSee also\n*Thomas Anders – Whispers (1991)\nExternal links\n*[http://www.tzuke.com/ Official website]\nReferences"
