The Hohe Warte is best known as the headquarters of GeoSphere Austria, the Federal Institute for Geology, Geophysics, Climatology and Meteorology, the former residence of the president, as well as for the Hohe Warte Stadium.\nGeography\nThe Hohe Warte final extension of the Vienna Woods.\nIn the 19th century, a villa district was established on the hill. Today, the hill is entirely surrounded by the city.\nThe Hohe Warte can be reached via the U4 metro line and tram lines 37 and D.\nHeadquarters of GeoSphere Austria\nIn 1872, the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics relocated from Wieden to the Hohe Warte. The new premises were designed by Austrian architect Heinrich von Ferstel and built between 1870 and 1872. The institute is responsible, among other things, for the daily Austrian weather report. In 1957, it was significantly expanded, and in 1967 and 1973, a radar, a weather balloon hanger, and a new office building were added to the institute's grounds. Today, this office building houses a large specialized library in the fields of meteorology and geophysics.\nHohe Warte Stadium\nHohe Warte Stadium is the home of First Vienna FC, the oldest football club in Austria. Uniquely built into the hillside, it features permanent seating only on the lower side. In the early 20th century, the stadium hosted Austrian national team matches, boxing events, and even operatic performances - including Aida, Pagliacci, and Cavalleria Rusticana - in front of crowds exceeding 80,000. Today, due to safety regulations prohibiting spectators from watching games from the grassy slopes, the stadium's capacity is limited to 4,500.\nReferences"
