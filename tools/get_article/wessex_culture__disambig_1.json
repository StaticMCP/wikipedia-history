It is prototyped with the Middle Rhine group of the Bell Beaker culture and commonly subdivided in the consecutive phases of Wessex I (2000–1650 BC) and Wessex II (1650–1400). Piggott attributes the origin of this culture to an \"actual ethnic movement\" from Northern France. Piggott describes the culture as composed of an underlying substratum, similar to the contemporary food vessel culture found further north, and an intrusive ruling class who opened trading networks with France and central and northern Europe, and imported bronze tools and probably also artisans.\nIt has been speculated that river transport allowed Wessex to be the main link to the Severn estuary. The wealth from such trade probably permitted the Wessex people to construct the second and third (megalithic) phases of Stonehenge and also indicates a powerful form of social organisation.\nHistory\nThe Wessex culture is typically split up into two periods - the first in 2000-1650 BC and the second in 1650-1400 BC.\nWessex I (2000-1650 BC)\nThe culture is related to the Hilversum culture, and consisted of Bell Beaker people from what is today the Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France. The people of the first Wessex culture, commonly known as Wessex I, were involved with a rebuilding of Stonehenge, and made weapons such as daggers and axes with bronze.\nWessex II (1650-1400 BC)\nThe Wessex II culture likely traded with Mycenaean Greece, as well as Crete and Egypt. They also had access to gold tools, found at their burial sites.\nClassification\nWhen the term 'Wessex Culture' was first coined, investigations into British prehistory were in their infancy and the unusually rich and well documented burials in the Wessex area loomed large in literature on the Bronze Age. During the twentieth century many more Bronze Age burials were uncovered and opinions about the nature of the early-mid Bronze Age shifted considerably. Since the late 20th century it has become customary to consider 'Wessex Culture' as a limited social stratum rather than a distinct cultural grouping, specifically referring to the hundred or so particularly richly furnished graves in and around Wiltshire. The culture group, however, is named as one of the intrusive Beaker groups that appear in Ireland.\nArtefacts\n. Bronze Age, about 1900–1600 BC. From Mold, Flintshire, North Wales]]The first phase, Wessex I, is characterised by rich depositions in the graves of chieftains, including gold artifacts, and crouched inhumations under barrows (e.g. the Bush Barrow). This period is closely associated with the construction and use of the later phases of Stonehenge. The second phase, Wessex II, is characterised by less rich grave goods without gold and a resurgence of cremations, believed to be a return to the previous funerary practices of the British Neolithic. They appear to have had wide ranging trade links with continental Europe, importing amber from the Baltic, jewellery from modern day Germany, gold from Brittany as well as daggers and beads from Mycenaean Greece and vice versa. They produced characteristic pendants in the shape of halberds, with handles made from gold or amber, or a combination of these materials.\nSee also\n*Bush Barrow\n*Bronze Age Europe\n*Únětice culture\n*Argaric culture\n*Nordic Bronze Age\n*Ottomány culture\n*Polada culture\n*Wietenberg culture\n*Sintashta culture\n*Nuragic culture\n*Helladic culture\n*Mycenaean Greece\n*Minoan civilization\nNotes\nSources\n* Piggott, S 1938.
