The battle was a part of the blockade that the Royal Navy maintained on the country from 1807 to 1814 during the Napoleonic Wars.\nCourse\nHMS Venus was in pursuit of four Dano-Norwegian merchant vessels that had sought refuge in the fjord leading to Grimstad. Among these vessels was the sloop Frau Maria, which was en-route from Bergen to Flensburg carrying fish, salt, and cod liver oil.\nVenus anchored outside the outer islands of Grimstad and deployed three small boats manned by Royal Marines. These boats made their way into Grimstad bay and boarded Frau Maria. Dano-Norwegian forces in Grimstad mobilized and engaged the British-controlled sloop using rifles and a few small cannons. Despite their efforts, the marines managed to set sail on Frau Maria but inadvertently sailed her into a narrow bay with no passage leading to the ocean. They were trapped and were forced to abandon the ship and retreated back to Venus. It was reported that several marines were killed or wounded in the engagement.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Bergwitz, Joh. K.: Grimstad 1800-1850: som type paa norsk smaaby.
