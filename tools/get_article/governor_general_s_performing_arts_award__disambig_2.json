Administered by the Governor General’s Performing Arts Awards Foundation in association with the National Arts Centre, they present lifetime achievement awards for work in all performing arts domains, including theatre, dance, film, television and radio broadcasting and both popular and classical music; the awards are, however, not necessarily presented exclusively to performers, and may also honour people who have had distinguished careers in the business side of cultural industries, such as film, television and theatre directors and producers.\nThe awards were created in 1992 under the patronage of then Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn and his wife Gerda Hnatyshyn.\nFrom 1992 to 2014, they typically honoured six figures per year; since 2015 they have honoured five. In addition to the lifetime awards, they also present the National Arts Centre Award to honour a figure who has had significant career achievements within the past year but is not yet considered to be at the \"lifetime achievement\" stage of their career, and the Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts to honour people who have been active in voluntary service to the arts.\nRecipients of the lifetime achievement and NAC awards receive $25,000 and a commemorative medallion; recipients of the RJH award receive a medallion, but are not given money. The awards are presented at a live gala at the National Arts Centre, and are typically recorded for broadcast by CBC Television at a later date.\nOnce inducted into one of the main \"lifetime achievement\" categories, a recipient is not honoured again in future years; however, a recipient of the NAC or RJH awards may be later named as a lifetime achievement recipient.\nIn 2025, the program also introduced a program which will see an emerging talent receive a year-long mentorship by a past award recipient.\nControversies\nIn 1994, Paul Gessell of the Ottawa Citizen criticized the foundation for honouring Neil Young, on the grounds that he had lived in the United States for many years and had, according to Gessell, \"turned his back\" on Canada, and Gilles Vigneault due to his support of the Quebec sovereignty movement. He further predicted, correctly, that Joni Mitchell would be an honoree in the near future, but opined that she was an inappropriate choice for the same reason as Young. In 2001 he criticized the awards for paying lip service to diversity in Canadian arts despite the fact that only two people of colour, pianists Oscar Peterson and Jon Kimura Parker, had ever been named as honorees as of that time.\nOne named honoree in 2005, singer-songwriter and poet Raymond Lévesque, declined the honour due to his support of the Quebec sovereignty movement. The awards proceeded that year with five lifetime honorees instead of six.\nIn 2018, Governor General Julie Payette faced controversy when she announced that she would not be presiding over the ceremony, the first time in the history of the awards that the sitting governor general did not attend. Payette offered little clarification of her reasons for not attending, but had faced some criticism since the beginning of her term around her apparently limited workload.\nOne past recipient, singer-songwriter Buffy Sainte-Marie, has had her honour rescinded.\nRecipients\n1990s\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\"\n!Year\n!width=\"45%\"|Recipient\n!width=\"45%\"|Discipline\n!Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=8| 1992\n| William Hutt\n| Theatre\n| rowspan=8|\n|-\n| Gweneth Lloyd\n| Dance\n|-\n| Dominique Michel\n| Broadcasting\n|-\n| Mercedes Palomino\n| Theatre\n|-\n| Oscar Peterson\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Léopold Simoneau\n| Classical music\n|-\n| Norman Jewison\n| Hnatyshyn Award\n|-\n| Gilles Maheu, Carbone 14\n| National Arts Centre Award\n|-\n| rowspan=8| 1993\n| Ludmilla Chiriaeff\n| Dance\n| rowspan=8|\n|-\n| Leonard Cohen\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Don Haig\n| Film\n|-\n| Lois Marshall\n| Classical music\n|-\n| Monique Mercure\n| Theatre\n|-\n| Gilles Vigneault\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Joan Chalmers\n| Hnatyshyn Award\n|-\n| Michel Marc Bouchard and Les Deux Mondes\n| National Arts Centre Award\n|-\n| rowspan=8| 1994\n| Frédéric Back\n| Film\n| rowspan=8|\n|-\n| Robert Charlebois\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Celia Franca\n| Dance\n|-\n| Frances Hyland\n| Theatre\n|-\n| Jean Papineau-Couture\n| Classical music\n|-\n| Neil Young\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Sandra Kolber\n| Hnatyshyn Award\n|-\n| Robert Lepage\n| National Arts Centre Award\n|-\n| rowspan=8| 1995\n| Denys Arcand\n| Film\n| rowspan=8|\n|-\n| Maureen Forrester\n| Classical music\n|-\n| Peter Gzowski\n| Broadcasting\n|-\n| Paul Hébert\n| Theatre\n|-\n| Anne Murray\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Jeanne Renaud\n| Dance\n|-\n| Arthur Gelber\n| Hnatyshyn Award\n|-\n| Ben Heppner\n| National Arts Centre Award\n|-\n| rowspan=8| 1996\n| François Barbeau\n| Theatre\n| rowspan=8|\n|-\n| Michel Brault\n| Film\n|-\n| Martha Henry\n| Theatre\n|-\n| Joni Mitchell\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Luc Plamondon\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Grant Strate\n| Dance\n|-\n| Martha Lou Henley\n| Hnatyshyn Award\n|-\n| Jon Kimura Parker\n| National Arts Centre Award\n|-\n| rowspan=8| 1997\n| Gilles Carle\n| Film\n| rowspan=8|\n|-\n| Nicholas Goldschmidt\n| Classical music\n|-\n| Monique Leyrac\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Gordon Lightfoot\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Betty Oliphant\n| Dance\n|-\n| Jean-Pierre Ronfard\n| Theatre\n|-\n| Maryvonne Kendergi\n| Hnatyshyn Award\n|-\n| Karen Kain\n| National Arts Centre Award\n|-\n| rowspan=8| 1998\n| Paul Buissonneau\n| Theatre\n| rowspan=8|\n|-\n| Bruce Cockburn\n| Popular music\n|-\n| Rock Demers\n| Film\n|-\n| Royal Canadian Air Farce\n| Broadcasting\n|-\n| Arnold Spohr\n| Dance\n|-\n| Jon Vickers\n| Classical music\n|-\n| Joseph H.
