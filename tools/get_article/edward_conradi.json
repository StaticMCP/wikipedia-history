Conradi received bachelor's and master's degrees from Indiana University Bloomington, and completed a Ph.D. in psychology from Clark University in 1904.\nHe moved to Florida in 1905, where he was principal of the Normal and Industrial School of St. Petersburg, Florida until he was appointed Dean of the Florida State College for Women, in 1909, by that school's president, Albert A. Murphree. Conradi only briefly held that office, as Murphree soon became President of the University of Florida, and Edward Conradi was named to replace him at FSCW. Conradi died in Tallahassee, Florida on 1 December 1944.\nThe old biology building at FSU is named in his honor, as is an endowed chair at the Department of Psychology.\nExternal links\n*[https://www.fsu.edu/about/history.html History of Florida State University]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080703195529/http://president.fsu.edu/pages/history.html Presidents of Florida State University]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060903044527/http://www.fsu.edu/~speccoll/conradi/conrcoll.htm Edward Conradi Papers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080906113320/http://diglib.lib.fsu.edu/findaids/FTaSU2004002.xml Conradi in FSU Digital Library]\n*"
