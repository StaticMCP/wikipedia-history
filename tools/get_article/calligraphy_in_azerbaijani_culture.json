In the Middle Ages, various examples of calligraphy were used in the writing of Azerbaijani manuscripts (naskh, nastaliq, taliq, shikaste, suls, reyhani, divani, ruga, muhaqqiq, tougi), and scientific works were written in the naskh line. In the 19th century, the works \"Inshai-Mirza Kazim\", \"Majmaul-khosh Khatih\" by Abdulqani Khalisagarizade Nukhavi and \"Khatti-taliq va nastalig\" by Abdussalam Akhundzadeh were written. Although calligraphy declined in Azerbaijan during the Soviet era, it is still used in modern times.\nHistory\nMiddle Ages\nIn the writing of Azerbaijani handwritten books, there are many methods of copying, nastaliq, taliq, shikaste, suls, reyhani, divani, ruga, muhaggiq, tougi, etc. line samples were used. Scientific works are mostly written in naskh line. In addition, examples of calligraphy can be found in mosque inscriptions, examples of coppersmithing, war items, kashkul and tabarzi used by Sufi dervishes.\nExamples of calligraphers who lived in the Middle Ages are Kishvari of Ghazvini, Muhammad Tahir Vahid Ghazvini, and Sadiq Bey Afshar, who are representatives of Azerbaijani literature. Medieval Azerbaijani manuscripts were copied by scribes and calligrapher: Khalil bin Ahmed, Shah Mahmud Nishapuri during the Safavid period, Muhammad ibn Huseyn Katib Nishati, Mahmud Shirazi, Osman ibn Mahmud Effendi of Shamakhi in the XVIII century, Kazim Garadonlu. The Oxford copy of Afsaheddin Hidayat divan from the 15th century stands out for its graphic-calligraphic uniqueness. The \"beautiful goldwork and calligraphy\" of the 16th-century Shah Ismail Khatai divan show its connection with the empire.\nIn 1591, Mahmud ibn Shahmohammed Ardabili copied Muhammad Fuzuli's divan in the taliq line. Currently, this book is stored in the Turkish manuscripts department of the Topkapı Palace Museum in Istanbul. In 1664, Muhammad Reza Ardabili copied Fuzuli's poem \"Leyli and Majnun\" in the line of nastalig. This copy, which is decorated with 22 miniatures and has a high artistic value apart from its literary significance, is preserved in the Turkish-language manuscripts department of the British Library.\nIn his poem, Muhammad Fuzuli used the incantation \"to make the hand a pen\" for calligraphers who write badly, make punctuation and spelling mistakes. This shows that the mistakes of calligraphers in writing lead to differences in meaning.\nImage:Efsehetdin Hidayet diwan6.png| Afsahaddin Hidayat's divan\nImage:Khatai-7.png|Ismayil's divan\n19th-early 20th century\nreads his poems to Friedrich Bodenstedt. Illustration from Bodenstedt's 1850 book 1001 Days in the East]]\nIn Azerbaijan, master Baba (18th century, Baku), master Abuzar Badalov (18th-19th centuries, Shahbuz), master Zeynal Naqgash (19th century, Ordubad), master Ahmed (19th century, Lankaran), master Muhammad (19th century), Ganja) artists were engaged with calligraphy. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, rich houses in Azerbaijan used qatas (a work of art consisting of Quranic verses written in golden script and framed) hung on carpets.\nIn the northwestern region of Azerbaijan, the most beautiful examples of calligraphy can be seen on tombstones and manuscripts. The 18th-19th centuries are the period when the art of calligraphy reached its peak in the region. The most common type of writing is naskh, and the regional type is called \"Naskh-i Tala\". Ashiq Huseyn Mashlashi dedicated each stanza of his poem \"You look like Alif\" to an Arabic letter. Another tradition belonging to the Jar-Balakan region is the Kahf juzü tradition. Surah Kahf of the Holy Qur'an is written in the form of juz and is read on Fridays. Juzs were written by famous calligraphers of the time, as well as by people who could write and write (madrasa students, common people, even women). More than a hundred examples of this tradition are preserved in the Zagatala Museum of History and Geography.\nCalligraphers such as Mirza Muhammadkarim bey Kabirli, Haji Mirza Aligulu Yusifzadeh, Molla Ali Karabagi, Mirza Ismayil Mehshun, Mirza Huseyn bey Salar, Mir Mohsun Navvab, Hasanali Khan Garadaghi worked in Shusha, one of the cultural centers of 19th century Azerbaijan. Molla Ali's student Mirza Kazim published his writings under the name \"Inshai-Mirza Kazim\" and this book was used as an example of calligraphy in madrasahs. Hasanali Khan Garadaghi copied Mir Mehdi Khazani's book \"Kitabi-tarikhi-Karabagh\" in shikaste-nastalig script. Mirza Kadym Irevani wrote fragments of poetry from Saadi in the erasing line in a folder-shaped gift kept in the Hermitage Museum. Mirza Ismayil Gasir, secretary of Lankaran region court, was a master of naskh, taliq and nakhun lines.\nGerman orientalist Friedrich Bodenstedt described Mirza Shafi Vazeh, who taught calligraphy in Ganja and Tiflis: \"Mirza Shafi wrote very beautifully and at the same time brought beauty and variety: he adapted the letters to the content of the text. If he had to write about ordinary things, then he , dressed them in festive clothes for ordinary, fancy things, wrote letters to women in a special thin script\".\nIn the middle of the 19th century, special attention was paid to calligraphy lessons in madrasas in Azerbaijan. One such madrasah was the madrasah of Abdulqani Khalisagarizadeh Nukhavi (1817–1879), the author of \"Majmaul-Khosh Khati\" in Nukha. Nukhavi's handwritten books were composed with artistic aesthetic taste, mostly using naskh and nastalig lines. Abdussalam Akhundzadeh, the 5th Shaykh al-Islām of the Caucasian Muslims, published the textbook \"Khatti-taliq and Nastaliq\" in Tbilisi in 1894. In the surrounding villages of Baku city, the art of calligraphy was mostly taught in schools near mosques along with religious lessons, and this is how skilled masters of this art were trained. Mirza Asadullah from Surakhani was the calligrapher of the hadiths of the \"Ismailiyya\" building facade. Handicrafts of his student Ahmed Alizade are stored in the Institute of Manuscripts of ANAS.\nImage:Bedii elyazma numunesi.

In modern times, artists such as Seyfeddin Mansimoglu, Haji Eldar Mikayilzade, Yavar Asadov, Gulkhan Baydemir use calligraphy in their works. Combining calligraphy with woodcarving, Seyfeddin Mansimoglu dedicated works to personalities such as Muhammad Fuzuli, Shah Ismayil Khatai, and Maulana Jalaladdin Rumi. Haji Eldar Mikayilzade created a synthesis of artistic calligraphy with botanical and Islamic patterns in the restoration of the Taza Pir Mosque.\nCalligraphers\nMiddle Ages\n* Abd al-Qadir Maraghi.
