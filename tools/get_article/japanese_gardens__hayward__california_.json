The gardens  are maintained by the recreation and park district  of Hayward.\nHistory\nThe site formerly housed the Hayward High School agricultural studies program, from 1913 to 1962. The land was designated as a future park site in 1962, with HARD beginning the acquisition process in 1972. The park's current area was fully acquired by 1976, and the park was dedicated in 1980.\nDesign\nThe garden was designed by Kimio Kimura.  It follows Japanese garden design principles, using California native stone and plants.\nThe garden contains over 70 plant species including mondo grasses, Japanese black pine,  cedar, juniper, and rhododendron.  No stains were used on the wood constructions.  Nails and fasteners are recessed, and all wood was notched, and aged, to simulate the appearance of a traditional Japanese garden.\nActivities\nThe Japanese Gardens are open to the public daily  except Christmas.\nThe site hosts weddings.\nReferences"
