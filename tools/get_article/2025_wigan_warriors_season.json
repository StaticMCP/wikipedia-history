They competed in the 2025 Super League season, and the 2025 Challenge Cup.

Following Penrith's victory in the Grand Final, thus qualification for the tournament, it was revealed that 15 or 16 February would be the latest they would play the tournament, leaving time for travel back to Australia then out to the United States, while also maximising their pre-season, citing player welfare as in issue. However, with this weekend being the opening weekend of the 2025 Super League season, the date was unlikely.\nOn 9 October 2024, Penrith confirmed to the NRL that they would not play the match before the start of the domestic seasons citing player welfare as the issue stating that their players were delaying their mandated leave to play in the 2024 Rugby League Pacific Championships and 2024 Samoa rugby league tour of England thus not allowing players to have an adequate preseason before the World Club Challenge. The club stated that it was open to working with the NRL for a solution to play the match, but would not as things stand currently.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2024 Super League Grand Final, Wigan Warriors captain Liam Farrell confirmed the champions' commitment to the 2025 World Club Challenge and stated that the club would be working to ensure the game goes ahead. These words later confirmed by CEO Kris Radlinski.\nOn 16 October, Radlinski contacted the NRL and Penrith about playing the game during Magic Round (requiring the NRL to schedule one of Penrith's byes for this round), an idea proposed on social media by Penrith's Nathan Cleary two days prior. However this idea never came to fruition with Penrith facing Brisbane in Magic Round.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n!Date and Time!!Versus!!H/A!!Venue!!Result!!Score!!Tries!!Goals!!Attendance!!TV!!Report\n|- style=\"background:#c0c0c0;\"\n| Not scheduled\n| Penrith Panthers\n| A\n| Western Sydney Stadium\n| Cancelled\n| N/A\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nWigan remain world champions by virtue of their victory in the competition in 2024, however did not receive a separate title for 2025 in lieu of Penrith's withdrawal.\nSuper League\nRegular season\nOn 9 July 2024, the club announced they would be part of the 2025 Rugby League Las Vegas event, playing their home match against Warrington Wolves at the Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada. Wigan's matchweek 1, 2, and rival Round fixtures were confirmed on 20 November 2024, with the rest coming the following day. Wigan's opening round match set a record for the highest attendanced opening game of Super League, it also is the only game to have ended 0-0 after 80 minutes in the summer era.\nFixtures\n{| class=\"wikitable defaultleft col4center col7center col10right col12center\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n!Date and Time!!Round!!Versus!!H/A!!Venue!!Result!!Score!!Tries!!Goals!!Attendance!!TV Exact TV channels can be sourced by using [https://web.archive.org/ WayBack Machine] on [https://www.rugbyleagueontv.com/ RugbyLeagueOnTV].NB Not all games were broadcast on Sky Sports TV (advertised as \"Sky Sports Exclusives\"), with the remainder being broadcast using Sky Sports+, their on demand services accessible online or via red button.

This was in spite of Wigan's ticket allocation to Leigh being over double the minimum 10% of ground capacity required by the RFL at 5,400 in a 25,000 capacity stadium. Wigan stated that their allocation was the maximum they could give under the rules of the independent Safety Advisory Group and the club's Ground Safety Officer in addition to a police consultation.\nBeaumont alleged that Wigan's statement on the issue was factually incorrect and an intentional attack on character, in addition to accusing Wigan of sharing private WhatsApp messages between the two clubs' CEOs and passing them off as formal correspondence. He further stated that threats to boycott the game came after Wigan cancelled a number of Leigh fans' tickets that were bought in the home stands and that the further ticket allocation was for these fans' safety to ensure these fans were segregated. This was in spite of him downplaying Wigan's safety concerns by citing the absence of safety issues between the two sides in previous games of the season. Beaumont claimed there was an agreement in place for Leigh to have a block in the East and West stands allocated to them if Leigh sold out the North Stand, and claimed he received no reasonable explanation as to why this was no longer the case. He further cited his side's deservace of extra allocation due to Wigan's allocation still being on sale and their previous season's semi-finals not selling out. He also stated his club was preparing for the semi-final as normal.\nOn the Monday following the tie, Leigh Leopards made an official complaint to the RFL over the aforementioned build up and Wigan's stewarding before and during the game.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n!Date and time!!Round!!Versus!!H/A!!Venue!!Result!!Score!!Tries!!Goals!!Attendance!!TV!!Report\n|- style=\"background:#ddffdd;\"\n| 3 October; 20:00\n| Semi-finals\n|  Leigh Leopards\n| H\n| Brick Community Stadium\n| W\n| 18–6\n| French (2), Walters\n| Keighran (2/3 + 1 pen.)\n| 18,523\n| Sky Sports+\n|\n|- style=\"background:#ffdddd;\"\n| 11 October; 18:00\n| Grand Final\n|  Hull KR\n| N\n| Old Trafford\n| L\n| 6–24\n| Smith\n| Keighran (0/1 + 1 pen.)\n| 68,853\n| Sky Sports Main Event\n|\n|}\nChallenge Cup\nOn 25 June 2024, the RFL announced a change to the Challenge Cup format totalling 7 rounds compared to the previous 9, and Super League teams entering at round 3.
