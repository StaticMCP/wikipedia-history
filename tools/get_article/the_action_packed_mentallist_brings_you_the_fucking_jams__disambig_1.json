It was released in 2002 through Violent Turd as a compact disc and a double LP set. Kid606 composed the album by splicing together songs he had downloaded from P2P devices. Artists sampled include Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Eminem, Yello, Ozzy Osbourne, Radiohead, The Bangles, The Buggles, The Prodigy, and Kylie Minogue.\nThe double LP edition omits the track \"Sometimes I Thank God I Can't Sing Because Then No One Can Blame Me for Anything\".\nReception\n| rev2 = Pitchfork\n| rev2score = 7.0/10\n| rev3 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n| rev3Score =\n}}\nCam Lindsay of Exclaim! described The Action Packed Mentallist Brings You the Fucking Jams as \"a record that is so extreme and blatantly illicit that you have to wonder how enormous this guy's nads really are\". David M. Pecoraro of Pitchfork wrote that the album \"offers a gimmick that just can't be beat\" and praised tracks such as \"MP3 Killed the Radio Star\" and \"Never Underestimate the Value of a Holler (Vipee-Pee Mix)\", but felt that others such as \"Kiddy Needs a New Pair of Laptops\" and \"Smack My Glitch Up\" did not offer significant variations on their source material. AllMusic critic Tim DiGravina opined that it was \"a fun album, though it seems rushed, perhaps because Kid606 wanted to stake his claim in the genre.\"\nTrack listing\n| title3 = Kiddy Needs a New Pair of Laptops\n| length3 = 9:47\n| extra3 =\n| title4 = Never Underestimate the Value of a Holler (Vipee-Pee Mix)\n| length4 = 14:19\n| extra4 =\n| title5 = Rebel Girl\n| length5 = 3:41\n| extra5 =\n| title6 = Smack My Glitch Up\n| length6 = 6:30\n| extra6 =\n| title7 = This Is Not My Statement\n| length7 = 13:03\n| extra7 =\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.whosampled.com/album/Kid606/The-Action-Packed-Mentallist-Brings-You-The-Fucking-Jams/ whosampled.com page that includes a list of samples used on this album]"
