The institute has the stated goal of honouring God and the sanctification of priests in the service of the Catholic Church and souls. An integral part of the institute's charism is the use of the traditional liturgy, namely the 1962 Missale Romanum for Mass, the Breviary of John XXIII for the Divine Office, and the Rituale Romanum and Pontificale Romanum for other sacraments. The society has undertaken the restoration of a number of historic church buildings.\nThe institute's rule of life is based generally on that of the secular canons. Its stated mission is the defence and propagation of the reign of Christ the King in all areas of human life, both private and social.\nEarly years\nThe institute was canonically erected on 1 September 1990 by Gilles Wach and Philippe Mora in Gabon, Africa, where the Institute still has missions, notably in the capital Libreville. Its canonical status was of diocesan right until 7 October 2008. On that date, it was granted the status of pontifical right by decree, titled Saeculorum Rex, of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, on the occasion of the visit of Camille Perl, the vice-president of the commission. Deacons and priests are incardinated into the institute, whose prior general has the right to call to orders.\nThe institute is based in Gricigliano, Italy, in the Archdiocese of Florence. Its international seminary of Saint Philip Neri is also located there, and the institute's ordinations and other major masses are held at the church of San Gaetano in Florence.\nWach serves as prior general and Mora as rector of the seminary. Both received their priestly formation under Cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genoa.\nAs of 2023, the institute has 147 priests, as well as clerical oblates who go through formation but may only be ordained up to the permanent diaconate, working instead for the several apostolates of the institute.\nThe charism of the institute is based on the example of its three patron saints:\n*Francis de Sales, who emphasized teaching the Catholic faith with patience and charity, encouraging all Catholics to a life of holiness through the ordinary means of the Church, such as devout attendance at Mass and frequent confession.\n*Benedict of Nursia, with his love for the solemn celebration of the liturgy, his emphasis on work and prayer, \"Benedictine hospitality\", and role in laying the groundwork for an integral Christian civilization in medieval Europe.\n*Thomas Aquinas, with his emphasis on the harmony between faith and reason.\nThe institute also honors as its primary patroness the Virgin Mary under the title \"of the Immaculate Conception, to Whom it is consecrated.\" Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus is the patroness of its African missions.\nApostolates\nIn the United States, the institute is headquartered in Chicago, with presences in Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Ohio, New York and Massachusetts. By 2025, apostolates had been added in Nevada andFloridaIn Chicago, the institute is restoring the historic Saint Clara/Saint Gelasius Church on Carmelite Way, which is also the site of the headquarters for the American Province of the institute. Upon completion, it will become the Shrine of Christ the King.\nIts oldest United States apostolate is the Saint Mary Oratory in Rockford, Illinois, and its newest is St. Mary of the Assumption Parish & Shrine in Oswego, New York. In Kansas City, Missouri, Bishop Robert Finn established an oratory (a public church where Mass and other rites may be celebrated) in 2005 for the institute at a historic church otherwise in danger of being closed. Also in 2005 St. Francis de Sales Church in Saint Louis, Missouri was established as an oratory under care of the institute, to serve the city and region. It is leading efforts to restore the church and has installed a new organ. The superior for the United States is Matthew Talarico.\nIn England, the Institute is active in the Diocese of Shrewsbury, where they have apostolates in New Brighton and Shrewsbury, in the Diocese of Lancaster, where they have two churches in Preston and the Diocese of Plymouth, where they have a church in Torquay.\nIn 2011 the Bishop of Shrewsbury invited the institute to re-open the Church of Saints Peter, Paul, and Philomena in New Brighton.\nSince Saint Patrick's Day, 17 March 2006, the institute has had a presence in the Diocese of Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. In Limerick City, they purchased Sacred Heart Church, Since May 2010, the institute has expanded into the Irish diocese of Galway, where weekly Mass is offered at Saint Mary's College school; monthly Masses are offered by priests of the institute in Ennis. The institute is also closely involved in the annual Catholic Voice conference held in Limerick, which features amongst its regular speakers Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke and John Hunwicke. Since December 2019 the institute has had an established apostolate in Belfast (Diocese of Down and Connor) following the purchase of the former Fortwilliam & Macrory Presbyterian Church. In April 2021, the Institute purchased a convent in Ardee, County Louth for use by a community of its female religious, the Sisters Adorers.\nIn addition to its oratories in the United States and missions in Africa, the institute also has apostolates in France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

They are also based in Gricigliano. The sisters are non-cloistered contemplatives, and their way of life is based on the Benedictine tradition.\nThe community celebrates Mass and the Divine Office using the traditional form of the Roman Rite, celebrated according to the pre–Vatican II rubrics. Needlework and embroidery projects form an important part of their daily Ora et Labora (\"Pray and Work\").\nWhen the number of sisters has increased sufficiently, the community plans to plant convents near the institute's churches, where the sisters will perform apostolic work such as teaching. , the sisters numbered 42, increasing to 60 by 2022. The sisters now have nine convents in seven countries.

They alleged that superiors, especially Msgr. Wach, engage in humiliating and manipulating seminarians and nuns into obedience, forcing them to act oblivious and claim there are no problems in the Institute. Seminarians were alleged to have been forced to work as servants for Institute superiors and visiting prelates.\nIn a February 2014 report, Sister Chantal-Marie Sorlin, of the Bishops' Conference of France office against sectarian deviations, relayed testimonies allegedly describing a cult of personality around the Msgr. Wach, criticism of the modern Church, isolation from the outside world, and inconsistent evangelical behavior among leaders within the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest. In 2023, Bishop Jean-Luc Brunin of Le Havre, head of the BCF’s group on sectarian influence, referred to the ICRSP as a “serious case” with “numerous dysfunctions,” and alleged signs of sectarian drift.\nThe allegations were denied by Institute superiors, including Msgr. Wach, claiming that the journalist failed to research the topic adequately, and that the articles are biased, saying, \"... many questions which you have asked me... seem more like a copy-pasted pamphlet than a serious inquiry. \".\nSee also\n*Consecrated life\n*Institutes of consecrated life\n*Religious institute (Catholic)\n*Secular institute\n*Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.institute-christ-king.org/ Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]\n* [https://www.institute-christ-king.org/sisters/ Sisters Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus]\n* [https://www.society-sacred-heart.org/ Society of the Sacred Heart]\n;International links\n*[http://www.icrsp.org/ France]\n*[http://www.institut-christus-koenig.de/ Germany]\n*[http://www.institute-christ-king.ie/ Ireland]\n*[http://www.icrss.it Italy]\n*[https://icrss.es/ Spain]\n* [https://www.icksp.org.uk/ United Kingdom]\n*[https://icrss.pl/ Poland]"
