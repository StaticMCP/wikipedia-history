Present-day Westchester, Bronx, New York, Richmond, Kings, Queens, Nassau, and Suffolk counties were part of York Shire from 1664-August 1673 and again from February 1674 until 1683 at which point the Province of New York was divided into counties. From August 1673 to February 1674 New York was under Dutch control and English political units were suspended, then restored under English rule. York Shire was divided into three divisions called ridings, the East, West, and North ridings. In 1683 the colony of New York eliminated shires and ridings in favor of counties, the East Riding becoming Suffolk County, West Riding the counties of Richmond and Kings, while the North Riding became the counties of Westchester (including present-day Bronx), New York, and Queens (including present-day Nassau).\nNew York experimented with different types of municipalities before settling upon the current format of towns and cities occupying all the land in a county, and all previous forms were transformed into towns (or divided into multiple towns) in 1788 when all of the state of New York was divided into towns. Some early forms of government in earlier years included land patents with some municipal rights, districts, precincts, and boroughs. Though originally intended to be mere “…involuntary subdivisions of the state, constituted for the purpose of the more convenient exercise of governmental functions by the state for the benefit of all its citizens” as defined by the courts in 1916 (Short v. Town of Orange), towns gained home rule powers from the state in 1964, at which time towns became \"a municipal corporation comprising the inhabitants within its boundaries, and formed with the purpose of exercising such powers and discharging such duties of local government and administration of public affairs as have been, or, maybe [sic] conferred or imposed upon it by law.”\nThe following time-line shows the creation of the current towns from their predecessors stretching back to the earliest municipal entity over the area. It represents from which old town&nbsp;(s) a particular new town was created, but does not represent annexations of territory to and from towns that already existed. All municipalities are towns unless otherwise noted as patent, township, borough, district, or city.\nWestchester and Bronx counties\nin 1839, which included the future Bronx County.]]\n|Bedfordpt=Bedford [B] Patent1704&ndash;1788|Bedford=Bedford [B]1788 |boxstyle_Cortlandt=background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_Peekskill=background-color: #cef2e0}}\n|Chester=Eastchester [B]1788|Rochelle=New Rochelle [B]City 1899|boxstyle_Rye=background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_Wheat=background-color: #cef2e0}}\n|Westchester=Westchester [C]1788&ndash;1895|Farms=West Farms [C]1846&ndash;1874 |Morrisania=Morrisania [C]1855&ndash;1874 |White=White Plains [B]City 1915|boxstyle_Kingsbridge =background-color: #faf5ff}}\n|Yonkers=Yonkers [B]City 1872-1898|boxstyle_Breucklandt=background-color: #d1e231|boxstyle_Brooklyn=background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_City=background-color: #cef2e0}}\n|Lots=New Lots [C]1852&ndash;1886 |boxstyle_Midwout=background-color: #f2e0ce|boxstyle_Flatbush=background-color: #cef2e0|boxstyle_Lots=background-color: #cef2e0}}\nNotes\n*All towns and cities in Kings County were annexed to the City of Brooklyn starting in 1854 with Bushwick and Williamsburgh and ending with the last remaining town- Flatlands in 1896.
