Following in his mother's footsteps, Deddy Mizwar has been involved in theatre arts since 1973 and film since 1976. Recently, he and his wife Giselawati have devoted themselves to Islamic da'wah films.

These dramas should not be limited to the month of Ramadan.\nSelected filmography\n#Naga Naga Naga (2021)\n#Bidadari Mencari Sayap (2020)\n#Sejuta Sayang Untuknya (2020)\n#Bangun Lagi Dong Lupus (2013)\n#How Funny (This Country Is) (2010)\n# Ketika Cinta Bertasbih II (2009)\n# Ketika Cinta Bertasbih (2009)\n# Nagabonar Jadi 2 (2007) (actor and director)\n# Ketika (2005) (actor and director)\n# Kiamat Sudah Dekat (2003) (actor and director)\n# Gema Kampus 66 (1991) (actor)\n# Jual Tampang (1990) (actor)\n# Irisan-Irisan Hati (1988) (actor)\n# Ayahku (1987) (actor)\n# Bilur-bilur Penyesalan (1987) (actor)\n# Cintaku di Rumah Susun (1987) (actor)\n# Kerikil-Kerikil Tajam (1987) (actor)\n# Nagabonar (1987) (actor)\n# Kejarlah Daku Kau Kutangkap (1986) (actor)\n# Arie Hanggara (1986) (actor)\n# Menumpas Teroris (1986) (actor)\n# Sunan Kalijaga & Syech Siti Jenar (1985) (actor)\n# Hati yang Perawan (1984) (actor)\n# Sunan Kalijaga (1984) (actor)\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
