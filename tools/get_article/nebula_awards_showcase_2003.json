It was first published in trade paperback by Roc/New American Library in April 2003.\nSummary\nThe book collects pieces that won or were nominated for the Nebula Awards for best novel, novella, novelette and short story for the year 2002, various other nonfiction pieces related to the awards, and the two Rhysling Award-winning poems for 2001, together with an introduction by the editor.

Still, the two big anthologies are better bargains.\"\nRoland Green, writing in Booklist, rates the book \"[a]s always, an honorable entry among the year’s anthologies. He notes that \"[i]n this year’s selection, the short fiction often uses biology for scientific grounding,\" but singles out the non-fiction offerings for praise: \"Terry Bisson’s essay on making a living with humorous fantasy is itself a humorous fantasy, and the other essayists on fantasy assimilate the boom in fantasy in both print and visual media.\" As the end of his assessment, the journal's young adult reviewer calls the book \"a terrific collection for genre fans and YAs new to sf.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Sandra Lindow in SFRA Review #263-4, Gary K. Wolfe in Locus, #507, April 2003, and Patrick J. Swenson in Talebones #26, Summer 2003.\nNotes"
