The ethnic groups arrested and detained in internment camps were Austro-Hungarians (mostly Ukrainians) and Germans.  Austro-Hungarian Prisoners were mainly residents of Canada from Ukraine, part of Serbia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia. Since Ukraine, part of Serbia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were then provinces of the empire of Austria-Hungary, many still had Austro-Hungarian citizenship and were considered to be resident enemy aliens. William Dostock, for example, who immigrated to Canada in 1910 from Austria-Hungary and was not yet naturalized was interned from 1915–1920 as an enemy alien.\nGerman prisoners were mainly residents of Canada from Germany. Germans formed a large proportion of the detainees since Canada served as a place of detention for German prisoners of war on behalf of the British.\nThe prisoners were given various tasks; many worked in the forests as logging crews. In addition to the main camps, there were branch camps and labour camps.\nList\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sticky-header\" style=text-align:left;\n!Camp\n!Location\n!Province\n!Type of Buildings\n!Period\n|-\n|Amherst Internment Camp\n|Amherst\n|Nova Scotia\n|Malleable Iron Foundry\n|April 1915 to September 1919\n|-\n|\n|Beauport\n|Quebec\n|The Armoury\n|December 1914 to June 1916\n|-\n|Castle Mountain Internment Camp\n|Banff & Castle Mountain\n|Alberta\n|Dominion Park\n|July 1915 to July 1917\n|-\n|\n|Brandon\n|Manitoba\n|Exhibition Building\n|September 1914 to July 1916\n|-\n|\n|Edgewood\n|British Columbia\n|Bunk Houses\n|August 1915 to September 1916\n|-\n|\n|Fernie & Morrissey\n|British Columbia\n|Rented premises\n|June 1915 to October 1918\n|-\n|\n|Halifax\n|Nova Scotia\n|Halifax Citadel\n|September 1914 to October 1918\n|-\n|\n|Jasper\n|Alberta\n|Dominion Park\n|February 1916 to August 1916\n|-\n|\n|Kapuskasing, Ontario\n|Ontario\n|Bunk Houses\n|December 1914 to February 1920\n|-\n|\n|Kingston, Ontario\n|Ontario\n|Fort Henry\n|August 1914 to November 1917\n|-\n|\n|Lethbridge\n|Alberta\n|Exhibition Building\n|September 1914 to November 1916\n|-\n|\n|Monashee & Mara Lake\n|British Columbia\n|Tents and Bunkhouses\n|June 1915 to July 1917\n|-\n|\n|Montreal\n|Quebec\n|Immigration Hall\n|August 1914 to November 1918\n|-\n|Eaton Internment Camp\n|MunsonEaton\n|AlbertaSaskatchewan\n|Railway Cars\n|October 1918 to March 1919\n|-\n|\n|Nanaimo\n|British Columbia\n|Provincial government building\n|September 1914 to September 1915\n|-\n|\n|Niagara Falls\n|Ontario\n|The Armoury\n|December 1914 to August 1918\n|-\n|\n|Petawawa\n|Ontario\n|Militia Camp\n|December 1914 to May 1916\n|-\n|\n|Revelstoke & Field & Otter\n|British Columbia\n|Bunk Houses\n|September 1915 to October 1916\n|-\n|\n|Sault Ste.
