Diplomatic relations and the Turkish Embassy in Prague were established on January 4, 1993.\nBoth countries are full members of Council of Europe and of NATO.\nHistory\nRelations between Czechoslovakia and Turkey had been excellent until 1948, when relations rapidly deteriorated because of disagreements over the compensation for the nationalization of the property owned by Turkish businesses.\nTrade relations were modest but limited because of Turkey's refusal to participate in a trade agreement until the claims of nationalized businesses were settled.\nRelations were also tense because of Czechoslovakia's alignment against Israel in the Middle East, which was Turkey’s closest ally in the region.\nIn 1993, Turkey formally recognized both the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic as separate, sovereign states.
