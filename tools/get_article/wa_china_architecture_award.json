It aims to recognize built works in China that demonstrate innovative approaches aligned with local conditions while contributing to global architectural discourse. The award has gained recognition as one of China's most influential non-governmental architectural accolades and has increasingly shaped international perceptions of Chinese architectural practice.\nHistory\nFounded by Professor Wang Lu, former editor-in-chief of World Architecture Magazine, the award initially focused on experimental design. In 2014, it underwent a major reform to expand its categories and emphasize diversified values, including social equity, technological innovation, and urban regeneration. Milestones include:\n2002: Inaugural edition with a focus on experimental architecture.\n2014: Introduction of six subcategories.\n2023: Record-breaking 426 submissions evaluated by a jury chaired by academicians and renowned architects.\nAward categories\nWAACA comprises six sub-awards:\n* WA Achievement Award：\nRecognizes projects demonstrating enduring spatial value (e.g., Wang Shu's Ningbo Museum).\n* WA Design Experiment Award：\nCelebrates pioneering design explorations, such as OPEN Architecture’s “Chapel of Sound” (2021).\n* WA Social Equality Award：\nHonors projects advancing social equity, like the revitalization of Beijing’s Yu’er Hutong community (2020).\n* WA Technological Innovation Award：\nAwards technical breakthroughs, exemplified by the modular construction of Shenzhen’s Water Cube Talent Apartments (2018).\n* WA City Regeneration Award：\nFocuses on urban renewal, such as the transformation of Shanghai’s Yangpu Riverside (2022).\n* WA Housing Award：\nHighlights innovative residential solutions, including co-living spaces in Guangzhou’s Zini Community (2023).\nSelection criteria\n*Eligibility: Built projects within specified timeframes (e.g., 2016–2018 for the 2020 cycle).\n*Judging Process: Multi-stage review by panels chaired by academicians and featuring international jurors.\n*Core Values: Emphasis on contextual relevance, technical rigor, and social impact.\nNotable recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
