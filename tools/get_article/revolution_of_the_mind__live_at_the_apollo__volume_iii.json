As its subtitle suggests, it is Brown's third album recorded at the Apollo Theater, following the original Live at the Apollo (1963) and Live at the Apollo, Volume II (1968).\nAfter a triple album project recorded in France was cancelled because Brown had signed with a new label, Polydor, Brown instead recorded his shows at the Apollo in July 1971. Revolution of the Mind documented Brown during his full immersion into funk music with his revamped backing band, the J.B.'s.\nThe album is notable as the first of Brown's live albums to include a spoken introduction by his longtime master of ceremonies, Danny Ray.\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto; width:60%; background:#eee;\"\n|-\n| I'd like to know, are you really ready for some super dynamite soul?
