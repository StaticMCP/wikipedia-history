The Viltrumites are a genetically advanced humanoid race known for their immense strength, flight, near-invulnerability, and a mission to conquer and dominate other planets.\nThe empire was first mentioned in \"Invincible\" #7, published in 2003, and appeared when Omni-Man (Nolan Grayson) reveals to his son, Mark Grayson (Invincible), his origins. He describes the Viltrumites as a powerful alien race from the planet Viltrum, intent on controlling worlds, including Earth.\nViltrum, the homeworld of this warlike alien race, is the origin of key characters like Omni-Man, Conquest, Thragg, and Anissa, who are central to the empire’s expansion and enforcement. The planet’s society was initially shaped by Social Darwinism, where only the strongest survived, leading to internal conflicts and a purge that left only the most powerful Viltrumites. Under leaders like Argall and later Grand Regent Thragg, the survivors established an authoritarian empire ruling numerous worlds.\nThough Viltrum suffered significant damage in a battle with the Coalition of Planets, it retained symbolic and strategic importance. In some comic continuities, the planet’s atmosphere and structure are shown as hostile to weaker species, reflecting the harsh conditioning of Viltrumite physiology.\nOrigins and Culture\nThe Viltrumites are a genetically engineered humanoid species from the planet Viltrum, developed for superior strength, stamina, survivability, and longevity. Their abilities stem from a centuries-long eugenics program and advanced genetic manipulation, often called a “global transhumance” due to intentional enhancements and selective breeding, granting them near-invulnerability, flight, and lifespans of millennia. Their society once adhered to a strict Darwinian philosophy, purging the weak to strengthen the race, a principle set by their former ruler Argall and later upheld by Thragg, the strongest Viltrumite. The empire grew through conquest, with Viltrumites infiltrating and dominating other civilizations to integrate them into their rule.\nIn their planet’s history, the assassination of Emperor Argall sparked a brutal civil war led by General Thaedus, who aimed to halt their imperial aggression. The aftermath involved a violent campaign, known as the Great Purge, which killed about half the population to eliminate the weak, leaving only the strongest Viltrumites. This was presented as a step to rebuild a “perfect civilization,” marking Viltrum’s shift into a militant empire.\nAfter the purge, the surviving Viltrumites, under leaders like Thragg, consolidated power and pursued galactic conquest. Their strategy blended diplomatic control, offering technology and stability, with military force against resistance, aiming to unify the galaxy under Viltrum’s rule.\nDespite their immense power, the Viltrumite Empire’s population was never large. By the time of the main \"Invincible\" storyline, fewer than fifty pure-blooded Viltrumites remained, including some aliens. This small population became a critical vulnerability during the Scourge Virus pandemic, which killed over 99% of their numbers and severely weakened the empire.\nReferences"
