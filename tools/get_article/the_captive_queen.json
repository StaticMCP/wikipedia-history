The piece, which is a setting of the Finnish author Paavo Cajander's Finnish-language poem of the same name, is chronologically the fifth of Sibelius's nine orchestral cantatas.\nThe Captive Queen was first performed in Helsinki on 12&nbsp;May 1906 by the Orchestra of Helsinki Philharmonic Society, conducted by the composer; however, it premiered under the title \"There Sings the Queen\" (\"\") in order to avoid the attention of the imperial censors. Sibelius arranged the piece for male choir in 1910; this version was first performed on 28&nbsp;November 1913 by the Choir of the Students' Union, with  conducting.\nInstrumentation\nThe Captive Queen is scored for the following instruments and voices, organized by family (vocalists, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and strings):\n*Mixed choir () or male choir ()\n*2&nbsp;flutes (one doubling piccolo), 2&nbsp;oboes, 1&nbsp;clarinet (in B), 1&nbsp;bass clarinet (in B), and 1&nbsp;bassoon\n*4&nbsp;horns (in F), 2&nbsp;trumpets (in F), and 3&nbsp;trombones\n*Timpani, bass drum, cymbals, This is clearly an accidental omission, as the score indicates \"\" at marker&nbsp;L.}}  and triangle\n*Violins (I&nbsp;and II), violas, cellos, and double basses\nHistory\n) wrote the text for Sibelius's cantata The Captive Queen.\n|image2=Snellman medal.png\n|width2=160\n|height2=\n|caption2=A medal commemorating the 1906 centennial of Snellman's birth\n}}\nSibelius composed the cantata for the centennial festivities that marked the birth (12&nbsp;May 1806) of Johan Vilhelm Snellman, a philosopher and statesman who was an important contributor to the Fennoman cause.').|name=Flag day}}\nThe Finnish composer Oskar Merikanto also contributed a new piece for the occasion, the Cantata in Memory of J.&nbsp;V. Snellman (, OM100; text by A.&nbsp;V. Koskimies). This premiered two hours before The Captive Queen, albeit at a different venue: the Finnish National Theatre.\nDiscography\nThe Finnish conductor Jorma Panula and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra made the world premiere studio recording of The Captive Queen in September 1987 for Ondine; they were joined by a mixed choir credited as the \"Academic Choir of Helsinki University\" (\"\"). , in his 2003 catalogue of Sibelius works, however, connects this ensemble to , which was founded in 1953 as the mixed choir of the Student Union of the University of Helsinki.
