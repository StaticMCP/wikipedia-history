He participated in the pogrom of 843 against the Paulicians, and distinguished himself in the border wars against the Arabs and their Paulician allies. He also founded the monastery of Saint Elizabeth in his native Charsianon, where he was probably buried. He had at least one son, the general Eustathios Argyros.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
