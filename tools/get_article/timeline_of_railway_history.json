Measuring between 6 and 8.5&nbsp;km, remaining in regular and frequent service for at least 650&nbsp;years, and being open to all on payment, it constituted even a public railway, a concept that, according to Lewis, did not recur until around 1800. The Diolkos was reportedly used until at least the middle of the 1st century AD, after which no more written references appear.\n16th–18th century\n* Mid 16th century (1550) – Hand propelled mining tubs known as \"hands\" were used in the provinces surrounding/forming modern day Germany by the mid-16th century having been improved use since the mid-15th century. This technology was brought to England by German miners working in the Minerals Royal at various sites in the English Lake District near Keswick (now in Cumbria).\n* c.1594 – The first overground railway line in England may have been a wooden-railed, horse-drawn tramroad which was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, around 1600 and possibly as early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about half a mile away.\n* c.1600 – A funicular railway was made at Broseley in Shropshire some time before 1605 to carry coal for James Clifford from his mines down to the river Severn to be loaded onto barges and carried to riverside towns.\n* 1604 – Huntingdon Beaumont, partner of landowner Sir Percival Willoughby, built the Wollaton Wagonway, running from mines at Strelley to Wollaton in Nottinghamshire. It was approximately two miles in length. Beaumont built three further wagonways shortly afterwards near Blyth, Northumberland, to service the coal and salt trades.\n* 1722 – The Tranent – Cockenzie Waggonway was built by the York Buildings Company of London, to transport coal from the Tranent pits to the salt pans at Cockenzie and the Harbour at Port Seton, in Haddingtonshire, now East Lothian. This wooden waggonway was replaced in 1815 with an iron fish bellied edgeway to Cockenzie Harbour by the new owners, the Cadell family. This was Scotland's first railway of any kind, with one section of it remaining in constant use until 1962. Some in situ stone sleeper blocks survive at the Robert Stevenson designed Cockenzie Harbour, and the entirety of the route is a way marked footpath.\n* 1725 – The Tanfield Wagonway was constructed to lead coal from pits around Tanfield to the Tyne at Redheugh (Gateshead). It was the first railway built on a large scale – 5 miles of double wooden track with massive civil engineering works including deep cuttings, huge embankments and the world's first large masonry railway bridge, the Causey Arch. Each 2.5 ton capacity waggon (with flanged wooden wheels) was hauled by a horse, up to 60 waggons per hour at peak times. Two miles of the wagonway route are still in use by the Tanfield Railway, making this the oldest operational railway in the world.\n* 1758 – The Middleton Railway, the first railway granted powers by an Act of Parliament, carried coal cheaply from the Middleton pits to Leeds. The line was privately financed and operated, initially as a wagonway using horse-drawn wagons. Around 1799, the wooden tracks were replaced with iron edge rails at a gauge of 4&nbsp;ft 1 in (1,245&nbsp;mm). In 1812 the Middleton Railway became the first commercial railway to successfully use steam locomotives: the Salamanca, which used John Blenkinsop's patented design for rack propulsion.\n*1760s – Iron production in Britain began to rise dramatically, followed by a similar rise on the European continent.  This was the result of the use of coke for smelting and refining pig iron and cast iron and the application of the steam engine and cast iron blowing cylinder to providing pressurized air for blast furnaces.\n* 1768 – The Wagon Way was constructed by the Erskines of Mar in Alloa, to carry coal from the Clackmannanshire coalfields of central Scotland to the Port of Alloa. Initially using wooden rails, these were later clad in Swedish iron (1785), and carried horse-drawn wagons. Some of the Wagon Way route still exists, although the tracks are long gone.\n* 1783 – Henry Cort patented the grooved rolling mill for rolling hot iron to expel molten slag.  Rolling was 15 times faster than hammering.\n* 1783 – Henry Cort patented the puddling process for making wrought iron.  This was the first large scale process for making a structural grade of iron and was also much less expensive than previous methods.  Puddled iron production came into widespread production after 1800.\n* 1784 – William Murdoch demonstrated a steam carriage powered by a high-pressure engine. He would later show it to his neighbour Richard Trevithick who would go on to build locomotives.\n* 1789 – The Charnwood Forest Canal, sometimes known as the \"Forest Line of the Leicester Navigation\" uses railways to supplement the canal between Nanpantan and Loughborough, Leicestershire. William Jessop had constructed a horse-drawn railway for coal wagons. He successfully used an iron edge-rail, in contrast to his partner Benjamin Outram, who preferred the traditional iron L-shaped flange-rail plateway.\n* 1793 – The Butterley Gangroad or the \"Crich Rail-way\" was built by Benjamin Outram, to connect the Warner Limestone Quarry to the Cromford Canal a mile away at Bullbridge. This railway included the oldest known railway tunnel located at Fritchley.\n* 1798 – The Lake Lock Rail Road, arguably the world's first public railway, opened in 1798 to carry coal from the Outwood area to the Aire and Calder navigation canal at Lake Lock near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, a distance of approximately 3 miles. The load of three wagons was hauled by one horse. The track used edge rails with a gauge of 3&nbsp;ft 4 3/4 in (1,035&nbsp;mm). The use of the line gradually declined and was closed in 1836.\n1800 to 1849\n* 1800 – The Boulton & Watt steam engine patent expired, allowing others to build high-pressure engines with high power-to-weight ratios, suitable for locomotives.\n*1802 – The Carmarthenshire Railway or Tramroad, a horse-drawn goods line, located in south west Wales, was established by an Act of Parliament. This line was used for coal transportation. It was a plateway of about 4 foot gauge, and using a pair of horses for power.\n*1802 – Unable to construct a canal similar to the nearby Cyfarthfa Ironworks, three of the four principal ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil, Wales: Dowlais, Plymouth and Penydarren, collaborated in building the 9.5-mile Merthyr Tramroad between Merthyr Tydfil and Abercynon. It was a single-track plateway with a gauge of 4&nbsp;ft 4 in over the flanges of the L-shaped cast-iron plate rails. The plates were 3&nbsp;ft long. One horse pulled about five trams.\n*1803 – The Surrey Iron Railway, London opened. It linked the towns of Wandsworth and Croydon via Mitcham on the south of the Thames. It was double track plateway throughout with a spacing of about 5 feet. The rails were of the Outram pattern and were L-shaped in cross-section and 3 feet 2 inches long. The line was closed in 1846. A part of the route is now used by Tramlink between Wimbledon and West Croydon.\n*1804 – First steam locomotive railway using a locomotive called the Penydarren or Pen-y-Darren was built by Richard Trevithick. It was  used to haul iron from Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon, Wales. The first train carried a load of 10 tons of iron. On one occasion it successfully hauled 25 tons. However, as the weight of the locomotive was about 5 tons the locomotive's weight broke many of the cast iron plate rails.\n*1805 – The Croydon Merstham & Godstone goods railway opens. It was the first commercial railway and was connected to the Surrey Iron Railway.\n*1807 – First fare-paying, horse-drawn passenger railway service in the world was established on the Oystermouth Railway in Swansea, Wales. Later this became known as the Swansea & Mumbles Railway although the railway was more affectionately known as \"The Mumbles Train\" (). The railway was laid in the form of a plateway, with the rails being approximately 4&nbsp;ft (1,219&nbsp;mm) in width.\n*1808 – The Kilmarnock & Troon Railway was the first railway in Scotland authorised by an Act of Parliament. It was a plateway, using L-shaped iron plates as rails. In 1817 it was also the first railway in Scotland to trial a steam locomotive. It was the Blücher that George Stephenson had used at the Killingworth Colliery. This locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at 4&nbsp;mph (6.4&nbsp;km/h). It was used to tow coal wagons along the wagonway from Killingworth to Wallsend. It was subsequently withdrawn from service because of damage to the cast iron rails.\n*1808 – Richard Trevithick sets up a \"steam circus\" (a circular steam railway using the locomotive Catch Me Who Can) in London for some months, for the public to experience for 1 shilling each.\n*1809 – Thomas Leiper constructed a 60&nbsp;ft long test railway in Philadelphia to show that one horse could haul ten times more weight on a railed road than on an earthen road. The railway was constructed with stone sleepers and wooden rails.\n*1810 – Thomas Leiper constructed a 3/4 mile long railroad to transport gneiss from his quarry in Avondale Pennsylvania to Ridley Creek.\n*1812 – First commercial use of a steam locomotive on the Middleton Railway, Leeds. Matthew Murray of Fenton, Murray & Wood, located in Holbeck, designed a locomotive with a pinion that meshed with a rack. Murray's design was based on Richard Trevithick's locomotive, Catch Me Who Can, adapted to use John Blenkinsop's rack and pinion system, and was called Salamanca. It was the first two-cylinder locomotive.\n*1813 – Wylam Waggonway started commercial operation. The wagonway was used to haul coal chaldron wagons from the mine at Wylam to the docks at Lemington-on-Tyne in Northumberland using the steam locomotive Puffing Billy.  Puffing Billy was constructed by coal viewer, William Hedley, enginewright, Jonathan Forster, and engineer Timothy Hackworth for Christopher Blackett, the owner of Wylam Colliery. The wagon way was used for hauling coal for 50 years .\n*1814 – George Stephenson constructs his first locomotive, Blücher for the Killingworth wagonway. The locomotive was modelled on Matthew Murray's. It could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at 4&nbsp;mph (6.4&nbsp;km/h) but was too heavy to run on wooden rails or iron rails which existed at that time.\n*1822 – Stephenson's Hetton colliery railway was the first purpose built railway not to use animal power, instead using stationary engines, inclines and purpose built steam locomotives.\n*1825 – Stephenson's Stockton & Darlington Railway was the first publicly subscribed railway to use steam locomotives.  It carried freight from collieries near Shildon to Darlington and Stockton-on-Tees in County Durham. The line opened on 26 September 1825. The following day, 550 passengers were hauled, making this the world's first steam-powered passenger railway, contrary to Liverpool's claims five years later.\n*1825 John Stevens of Hoboken, New Jersey built a 1/2 mile circular test railroad track and also built a steam locomotive, the first in America. The locomotive had a pinion and the track had a rack.\n*1826, January – The first section of the Springwell Colliery Railway, later to be known as the Bowes Railway, opened. This section was the first six miles of what would become a 15-mile railway, using a mix of locomotive and rope (cable) haulage. Part of the original line is now a British scheduled monument.\n*1827, 30 June – The first railway in France opened  between Saint-Etienne and Andrézieux (horse-drawn carriage).  Tests had been run from 1 May 1827.\n*1827, January to May – Construction of the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway to transport anthracite from mines in the mountains of Pennsylvania to the Lehigh River. It started operations in 1828.\n*1828 – The Bolton & Leigh Railway opened on 1 August with the locomotive Lancashire Witch pulling wagons loaded with approximately 150 passengers. However, regular passenger services did not start until 1831.\n*1828 – Railway (horse-drawn carriage) České Budějovice – Linz, first public railway in continental Europe, with length 120&nbsp;km and rail gauge 1,106&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;ft 7 1⁄2 in), section České Budějovice – Kerschbaum put into operation on 30 September 1828.\n* 1828 – The Hot blast technology was patented by James Beaumont Neilson. It was the most important development of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron.  Hot blast also dramatically increased the capacity of blast furnaces and improved the quality of iron made with coke (fuel).\n*1828 –  From 4 July the Baltimore & Ohio (B&O) began constructing a track.  The South Carolina Railroad Company commenced construction a few months later.\n*1829 - George and Robert Stephenson's locomotive, Rocket, sets a speed record of 47&nbsp;km/h (29&nbsp;mph) at the Rainhill Trials held in between Liverpool and Manchester, UK.\n*1829, 8 August – Delaware & Hudson Railroad, constructed using 16 miles of wood rails capped by strap iron, conducts the first test of Stourbridge Lion steam engine built in England.\n*1830 – The Canterbury & Whitstable Railway opened in Kent, England on 3 May, three months before the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Built by George Stephenson, this was a 5¾ mile line running from Canterbury to the small port and fishing town of Whitstable, approximately 55&nbsp;miles east of London. Traction was provided by three stationary winding engines, and Invicta which was a 0-4-0 locomotive, built by the Stephenson company, but only able to operate on level sections of track because the locomotive only produced a meagre 9&nbsp;horsepower.\n*1830 – The first public railway in the United States, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, opened with 23 miles of track, with mostly hardwood rail topped with iron. The steam locomotive, Tom Thumb, was designed and built by Peter Cooper for the B&O, the first American-built steam locomotive.  Trials of the locomotive began on the B&O that year.\n*1830 – The Liverpool & Manchester Railway opened. It marked the beginning of the first steam passenger service which was locomotive-hauled and did not use animal power. The line had the first timetables for passengers and proper stations (with ticketing offices and platforms) and went on to prove the viability of rail transport.\n*1830 – The first portion of the Saint-Étienne–Lyon railway opened between Givors and Rive-de-Gier on 1 July 1830. The rest of the line opened on 1 October 1832 for passenger use only, accepting freight a few months later. It used iron rails on dice stones. The line was 58&nbsp;km long with 112 bridges and three tunnels. The locomotives were based on George Stephenson's Locomotion, but with a tubular boiler that produced six times more power.\n*1831 – First railway in Australia, for the Australian Agricultural Company, a cast iron fish belly gravitational railway servicing the A Pit coal mine.\n*1831 – First passenger season tickets issued on the Canterbury & Whitstable Railway.\n*1832 – The Leicester and Swannington Railway opened in Leicestershire.
