      "text": "# Global Wars Mexico\n\nGlobal Wars Mexico was a 2025 professional wrestling event co-promoted by the American promotion Ring of Honor (ROH) and the Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). It is the 19th Global Wars event. The event took place on June 18, 2025 at Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico, and was aired on Honor Club on June 26, 2025. This is the second Global Wars event in 2025, after Global Wars Australia in February, as well as ROH's debut in Mexico.\nProduction\nBackground\nGlobal Wars is a professional wrestling event held sporadically by the American promotion Ring of Honor (ROH) since 2012. Originally named \"Border Wars\" and co-produced with the Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling Noah, the event was renamed Global Wars in 2014 after ROH announced a partnership with New Japan Pro-Wrestling.\nUnder the new name, the event became a supershow co-produced by the two promotions. In 2019, ROH announced a three-event tour with the Mexican promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre as the new partner for the series, renamed \"Global Wars Espectacular\". The Global Wars Espectacular tour marked the last Global Wars event held by ROH under the ownership of Sinclair Broadcast Group.\nOn June 13, 2025, ROH announced that it would bring back the \"Global Wars\" name a second time this year in 2025 for a co-promoted event with professional wrestling Mexican company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), to take place in Mexico City, Mexico at Arena México on June 18.\nThe previous event was Global Wars Australia in February 2025; it is the first time since 2019 that ROH has hosted two Global Wars events in the same calendar year.\nStorylines\nGlobal Wars Mexico featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Storylines were produced on ROH's streaming program Honor Club TV and CMLL events.\nAthena has been feuding with Thunder Rosa as of late in ROH, as on the June 6, 2025 episode of ROH Thunder Rosa came to the aid of Rachel Armstrong as Athena carried on the attack after defeating her. Afterwards Rosa held up Athena's ROH Women's World Championship indicating that she is after the ROH Women's title. Which leads up to Global Wars Mexico as both women have their female allies team up with them for the event. The ROH Women's World Television Champion Red Velvet will be in Athena's corner, while Persephone (fellow female CMLL Mexican wrestler and ally of Thunder Rosa) is in Thunder Rosa's corner. Also on June 17, 2025 Athena called Thunder Rosa irrelevant further leading up to their feud for the event.\nResults\n| times =\n| match1 = Persephone and Thunder Rosa defeated Athena and Red Velvet\n| stip1 = Tag team match\n| time1 = 7:16\n| match2 = Nick Wayne (c) vs. Titán ended in a time limit draw\n| stip2 = Singles match for the ROH World Television Championship\n| time2 = 10:00\n| match3 = Bandido (c) defeated Máscara Dorada by pinfall\n| stip3 = Singles match for the ROH World Championship\n| time3 = 19:31\n| match4 = Blue Panther defeated Lee Moriarty (with Carlie Bravo, Shane Taylor, and Shawn Dean)\n| stip4 = Singles match\n| time4 = 11:17\n}}\nSee also\n* Grand Slam Mexico\n* CMLL vs. AEW & ROH\n* FantasticaMania Mexico\nReferences"
