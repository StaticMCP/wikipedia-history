The magazine describes itself as \"a big tent for liberal right of centre discourse\".\nIn October 2016, it acquired OpIndia; in 2018, it became an independent entity. In 2018, Swarajya launched its Hindi edition.\nReception\nThe website has misreported news on multiple occasions, according to fact-checkers including Alt News and Boom.}} Columnists working for Swarajya have allegedly engaged in a variety of trolling over Twitter.}} Journalists working for Swarajya have propagated communally charged fake news via their personal accounts.
