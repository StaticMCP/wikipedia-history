They were replaced with 80 new wards for the second general election in 1999.\nThe Highland Council (Comhairle na Gaidhealtachd in  Gaelic) had become a local government authority in 1996, when the two-tier system of regions and districts was abolished and the Highland region became a unitary council area, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994. The first Highland Council election, however, was one year earlier, in 1995. Until 1996 councillors shadowed the regional and district councils and planned for the transfer of powers and responsibilities. Elections to the council are normally on a four-year cycle, all wards being contestable at each election.\nFor the periods 1995 to 1999 each ward elected one councillor by the first past the post system. The first past the post system continued in use when new wards were introduced in 1999, but the increased number of wards meant an increase in the number of councillors.\nThe wards used from 1995 to 1999 were subdivisions of eight council management areas, with councillors elected from each area forming an area committee. The wards created in 1999, however, were not exactly subdivisions of the management areas, management area boundaries were not adjusted to take account of new ward boundaries and, therefore, area committees ceased to be exactly representative of areas for which they were named and for which they took decisions.\nLists of wards, 1995 to 1999\nWards are listed by management area, and are numbered as well as named.\nBadenoch and Strathspey wards\nThe Badenoch and Strathspey management area consisted of five wards:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
