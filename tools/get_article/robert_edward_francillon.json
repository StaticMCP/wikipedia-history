      "text": "# Robert Edward Francillon\n\nRobert Edward Francillon (1841–1919) was an English journalist and author. He was active in the later decades of the 19th century, and rose to be managing editor of The Globe.\nLife and career\nBorn in Gloucester, Francillon trained as a barrister but turned to journalism. He was at various times a contributor to ''Blackwood's Magazine and an editor of Tatler. He contributed for many years to the Christmas numbers of The Gentleman's Magazine, and sold many short stories to newspapers. (Most of those that were published in Australia can be read online thanks to the Trove service of the National Library of Australia.) His novel Jack Doyle's Daughter'' lets a Lincolnshire gentleman loose in Bohemian London. It has been called an \"incoherent\" tale involving an \"heiress with six possible fathers\".\nFrancillon's review \"George Eliot's First Romance (1876)\" defends Daniel Deronda from early critics. He notes that as a romance, it differs in kind from Adam Bede or Middlemarch: \"It lies so far outside George Eliot's other works in every important respect as to make direct comparison impossible.\"\nIn 1890, Francillon was reported to be the managing editor of the London newspaper The Globe''.\nAlong with Swinburne, Francillon belonged to Thomas Purnell's literary club \"Decemviri\", and was an early member of the neo-Jacobite body known as the Order of the White Rose.\nFrancillon married a daughter of the composer John Barnett, who was also a goddaughter of Franz Liszt.\nSome works by Francillon\n;Short stories and novelettes, published in Australian newspapers\n*Olympia\n*A Queen of Trumps\n*Queen Cophetua\n*A Bad Bargain\n*''Esther's Glove\n*The Seal of the Snake\n*The Way of the Wind, first published in the London Almanac in 1888\n*Golden Rod\n*No Conjuror\n*Fad and Her Fetish\n*The Luck of Luke Parris\n*Veni, Vidi, Vici\n*A Learned Lady\n*Silver and Gold\n*Double Sixes\n*M or N\n*Owen Murtagh's Girl\n*An Obstinate Blockhead''\n;Songs\n*\n*\n*\n;Books\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links"
