DNA evidence enabled the identification of his remains.\nThe centre opened on 26 July 2014 on the site of the then recently excavated Greyfriars, the medieval friary where the King was buried in 1485 following his death at the Battle of Bosworth Field.\nLocation\nThe Centre occupies a former school, Alderman Newton's School, next to the original Social Services car park where King Richard's remains were found during Philippa Langley and the Richard III Society's excavation project, which was started by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) on 25 August 2012 (the remains were found on the first day).\nBecause of worldwide interest in the discovery, Leicester City Council converted the Victorian school building into a visitor centre.\nThe project includes a covered area over the original grave site, which was in the choir of the friary, alongside a section of the choir floor of the church. The centre cost £4 million, and was designed by Paul East of Maber Architects.\nAccess and conservation\nThe burial site is part of a scheduled monument. In December 2017, Historic England scheduled a significant part of the site of the former friary. While the associated buildings had long been demolished, the site was assessed as having archaeological potential.\nAwards\nIn October 2018, the Visitor Centre was awarded \"Best Museum\" in the Group Leisure and Travel Awards, after being nominated in the same category as the British Museum and the National Railway Museum.\nGallery\nFile:Original grave of Richard III.jpg|The original grave of Richard III, under the then choir of Greyfriars, Leicester.
