Many of her over forty novels were written for children.\nBiography\nPilkington was born in Cambridge, England. Her father died when she was 15 years old and she went to live with her grandfather. The man who had taken over her father's medical practice eventually became her husband in 1786. While he was away working as a naval surgeon, she took work as a governess.\nPilkington's portrait, painted by Joseph Slater Jr., is held by the Royal Collection Trust. An engraving of her by James Hopwood the Elder is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London, and another by Isaac Slater is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum.\nShe published over forty novels in the years leading up to 1825, many of them for children.
