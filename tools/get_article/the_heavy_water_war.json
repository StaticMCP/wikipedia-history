Among concerns have been Heisenberg's involvement in the development of nuclear weapons and allusions to his homosexuality.\nPrevious versions\nThe same story was covered in the 1948 Franco-Norwegian film Kampen om tungtvannet (also known as ''La bataille de l'eau lourde or Operation Swallow: The Battle for Heavy Water). Quite faithful to real events, it even had many of the original Norwegian commandos starring as themselves.\nThe 1965 British film The Heroes of Telemark, starring Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris, was another version of the story.\nRay Mears presented a documentary called The Real Heroes of Telemark'' in 2003.  Despite mainly sticking to the factual evidence, some scenes in the documentary were partly dramatised, focusing on the survival skills involved in the operation.\nSee also\n* Norwegian heavy water sabotage\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
