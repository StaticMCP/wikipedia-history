Soon after, construction of a variety of private and public buildings commenced, many of which were built with Aboriginal convict labour and which remain today. This is a list of extant colonial buildings of Rottnest Island, constructed between 1830 and 1896.\nThe first European settler on the island was Robert Thomson, who established a modest farm for hay production, as well as a salt collection enterprise.\nIn August 1838, a Corporal Welch was sent to Rottnest with ten Aboriginal prisoners. The following year, Thomson had his whaleboat stolen, supposedly by several of the inmates, and after complaints, Governor John Hutt decided to resume all land grants previously made on the island. Henry Vincent, a gaoler at the Fremantle prison was subsequently sent to the island as its first superintendent. Vincent went on to personally build or oversee the construction of many of the buildings listed.\nBuilding materials were mostly locally quarried limestone as well as timber from the local pine (callitris preissii) and featured distinctive rough plastered walls.\nFirst Superintendent's House\nBuilt around 1841.\nSituated immediately above the Visitors Centre off the main jetty, the structure was built as the residence for the Superintendent of Rottnest Island. It was closed in 1904 and in 1913 divided into two cottages for use by government officials.\nMilitary Barracks\nBuilt around 1844. ( Cottages E, J, and H.)\nPilot Crew's Quarters\nBuilt 1846-1853.\nPilot's Quarters\nBuilt 1847.\nSecond Superintendent's House\nBuilt 1848.\nSchool and Chapel\nBuilt 1856–57.\nThe school and chapel were built in 1856 and 1857. Between the two World Wars the chapel was used as accommodation for domestic staff from the island's hotel.\nMill and Hay Store\nBuilt 1857.\nGovernor's Residence\nBuilt 1858-64.\nIn 1848 Governor Charles Fitzgerald expressed an interest in a summer residence on Rottnest. He resided temporarily in the First Superintendent's House. His successor, Sir Arthur Kennedy authorised funding for the construction of an official residence and works commenced in 1858. Architect Richard Roach Jewell as Superintendent of Public Works and Towns, designed the two-storey building, which was completed and occupied in 1864.\nBetween 1909 and 1913 Governor Strickland attempted to extend the grounds of the Governor's Residence forward to the sea-front and behind to Government House Lake. This would have prevented the residents of the settlement from walking in front of the Residence to get to the chapel, and so the extension was not permitted. After this the summer-time residence of the Governor was moved to Albany.\nThe Residence was converted to holiday accommodation in 1919 and in 1953 it opened as a hotel with a liquor licence.  It has been known variously as the \"Rottnest Hotel\", \"Quokka Arms\" and as of 2015 \"Hotel Rottnest\".\nMajor modifications and extensions to the buildings have been made over the years, including the addition of several short-stay units for tourists and a modern bar/restaurant facility. The major architectural features of the Residence are still clearly prominent.\nPilot Boathouse\nBuilt 1858.\nNative Prison\nBuilt 1863-64.\nRottnest was used as a penal establishment for Aboriginal people between 1838 and 1931, except for the period 1849 to 1855. The Quod ( meaning , ) replaced an earlier structure that was destroyed by a major fire in 1856. The only entrance faced east, towards to the superintendent's office. Rooms on either side of the entrance housed prison warders.\nIn 1883 a commission was set up to look at conditions for Aboriginal prisoners. The superintendent William Dockwrey Jackson gave evidence to this commission as to the conditions of the prisoners: \"There are 36 cells[…]. I have had five natives in a 6 x 10 [] cell, but as a general rule there are only four.\"\nFrederick Vosper, owner of the local Sunday Times newspaper visited the prison in 1899 and described it as follows:\n]. in extent, which are lighted only by a grating in the cell door, and one in the wall over it. The cubic air space must be very small not more than 300ft []. I should think and in there, black prisoners sleep on the bare boards, having a rug provided to cover them. ... I was informed by Dr. Hope that the rule is to put three men in a cell.}}\nThe prison closed in 1904 and in 1911 it was modified for holiday accommodation. Further modifications were made in 1986 when it became the Rottnest Lodge.\nHay Store\nBuilt 1863-64.\nPilot Crew's Kitchen\nBuilt 1867.\nSalt Store\nThe Salt Store was built prior to 1880 for storage and bagging of the output of the Salt Works (situated on the eastern shore of Pearse Lakes, now demolished). The extant building is the second salt store, the first having been built in 1839 to the north of the First Superintendent's House. The building is about  and built into the hillside. It was originally one large room, but when converted for use as the post office in 1913 two internal walls were added, and modifications made to the east parapet. A toilet annex is attached to the southern rear corner, on a higher level. In the 1980s this building was occupied by the island engineer and ranger.\nCoxswain's Cottage\nBuilt 1871.\nLomas' Cottage\nBuilt 1871. For John Lomas. Later used to house the Rottnest telephone exchange (the east wall was removed to aid the installation of this).\nBoy's Reformatory\nBuilt 1880-81.\nThis is one of the few colonial buildings on Rottnest Island not constructed by Henry Vincent. John Watson built the structure and became the reformatory superintendent for all of its 20-years of operations to 1901.\nThe reformatory buildings are now used as holiday accommodation as part of the Rottnest Lodge.\nAboriginal boys and boys in trouble with the law were sent to this reformatory. Here they were taught carpentry, gardening and joinery.\nWadjemup Lighthouse\nBuilt 1849 and 1896.\nThe current lighthouse stands on the site of a much smaller lighthouse built in 1849. Foundations of the original structure are nearby.\nReferences\nGeneral references\n*\n*\n*\nSources\n*\n*"
