This claim attributes China's beating to its technological backwardness. It is a slogan used by the Chinese government to \"guide\" Chinese people to understand the modern Chinese history.\nDefinition\n\"Backwardness brings on beatings by others\" literally means that if you are backward, you will be beaten. This phrase is mostly for countries, it implies that backward countries are naturally subject to invasion and exploitation.\nEvaluations\nSome Chinese scholars have questioned the statement that \"backwardness brings on beatings by others\". Zhu Weizheng argued that the backwardness of political civilization was the fundamental reason why the late Qing China was beaten by the Western powers. According to Hu Haiou, the real reason why the late Qing China was beaten was because of its backward concept.\nReferences"
