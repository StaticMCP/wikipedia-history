World Abu Dhabi is the world's second largest indoor theme park in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, owned and developed by Miral at a cost of $1 billion. The park features characters from Warner Bros.'s franchises (including ones from its DC Comics and Turner Entertainment Co. subsidiaries), such as Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Batman and Scooby-Doo. The park is located on Yas Island near Ferrari World, Yas Waterworld and CLYMB Abu Dhabi, and is the third Warner Bros. theme park.  The WB Hotel is the first Warner Bros. themed hotel and is located adjacent to the theme park. The park contains 29 rides, and several shows.\nHistory\nPlans for the park began in 2007, but were halted by the Great Recession. Warner Bros. had signed a development contract with Aldar Properties in that year.\nIn May 2015, Miral signed the general construction contract with Belgian contractor Six Construct, thus resuming construction that year. On April 19, 2016, Miral and Warner Bros. announced plans for the park's first phase to open in 2018.\nMiral announced in February 2017 that ride delivery and installation had begun with many of the 29 rides being tested. On April 25, 2017, Warner Bros. Consumer Products and Miral announced that the park was on schedule at 60% completion, and revealed information about its twelve themed lands.\nOn July 24, 2018, the park was inaugurated by Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and the then Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan now the UAE president.\nOn November 10, 2022, a Harry Potter themed land was announced to be coming to the park.\nDesign\n, the world's first Warner Bros. themed hotel, located next to the park.]]\nThe theme park is indoor and fully air-conditioned, as is typical of most major theme parks in the region due to the extreme heat in the summer. Standing at , Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi was named the world's largest indoor theme park by Guinness World Records in 2019, though this has since been surpassed by Chimelong Spaceship in Hengqin, Zhuhai, China.\nThe facade features a  tower inspired by the iconic Warner Bros. Water Tower in Burbank, California. The theme park was designed by Thinkwell Group.\nLayout\nWarner Bros. World Abu Dhabi features six themed lands; Gotham City, Metropolis, Cartoon Junction, Bedrock, Dynamite Gulch, and Warner Bros. Plaza.
