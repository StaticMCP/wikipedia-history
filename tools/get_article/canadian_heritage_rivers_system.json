      "text": "# Canadian Heritage Rivers System\n\nThe Canadian Heritage Rivers System (CHRS; ) is a joint program administered by the federal, provincial, and territorial governments to conserve and protect the best examples of Canada's river heritage, to give them national recognition, and to encourage the public to enjoy and appreciate them. It is a cooperative program of the governments of Canada, nine provinces, and the three territories. A 14-member national board, created under the Parks Canada Agency Act, administers the program and approves the designation of specific rivers.\nIndividual jurisdictions can co-nominate and co-designate their respective rivers or river segments in accordance with guidance from the program Charter, and Strategic Plan, and the Principles, Procedures and Operational Guidelines (PPOG).\nHistory\nThe Canadian Heritage Rivers System was established in 1984. The first Canadian Heritage River was the French River in Ontario, designated in 1986.\nBy 1996 there were 29 designated rivers.\nQuebec withdrew its participation in 2006. There are currently 42 designated, and one nominated river or river segments; with rivers designated in every province and territory except for Quebec.\nThe most recent designation under the Canadian Heritage Rivers System has been a 718-kilometre segment of the North Saskatchewan River in Alberta, which was originally nominated by Smoky Lake County in 2021, and finally designated in 2024 and extends the 49-kilometre portion within Banff National Park which was originally recognized in 1989.\nDesignated rivers\nThe rivers currently designated as a Canadian Heritage River are:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n!

The province withdrew its participation in the Canadian Heritage Rivers System in 2006.\nQuebec's lack of participation affects nominations and designations for rivers shared with other provinces. In 1998, the New Brunswick portion of the Restigouche River was designated (as \"Upper Restigouche\"), while the Quebec portion was not. The Ottawa River was nominated in 2007 and designated in 2016, but only the Ontario portion of the river was included. The federal government says it's working with Quebec \"to establish recognition of the heritage value of Quebec's stretch of the Outaouais River\".\nRecent program updates\nChanges to the program's Principles, Procedures and Operational Guidelines, and the latest Strategic Plan have aimed to modernize the system.\nSpecifically, the 2020-2030 Strategic Plan identifies four priorities:\n* Advancing Reconciliation on Canadian Heritage Rivers\n* Strengthening the Canadian Heritage Rivers Network\n* Excellence in River Management and Conservation\n* Engaging Canadians in Celebrating and Stewarding Heritage Rivers\nAwards\nThe organization has two awards, the Heritage River Award and the Canadian River Stewardship Award.
