The ceremony was held on May 5, 2019, at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California. Actors and television hosts Mario Lopez and Sheryl Underwood hosted the ceremony for the third consecutive time.\nThe drama pre-nominees were announced on January 24, 2019, and the standard nominations were announced on March 20, 2019.\nRule changes\nChanges were made to the Daytime Emmys rules and procedures to avoid a repeat of the previous year when the NATAS had to rescind the awarding of the Outstanding Guest Performer in a Digital Daytime Drama Series Emmy to Patrika Darbo, after it was determined that she appeared in a prior season of The Bay and entered scenes from multiple episodes for judging, both violations of the submission guidelines. The four network daytime dramas (The Bold and the Beautiful, Days of Our Lives, General Hospital, and The Young and the Restless) had threatened a boycott if no changes to the rules were made.\nWinners and nominees\n, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series winner.]]\n, Outstanding Game Show Host winner]]\n, Lifetime Achievement Award winner]]\n, Lifetime Achievement Award winner]]\nNominations were announced on March 20, 2019.
