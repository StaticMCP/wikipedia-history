This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district, while Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district. This landowner requirement would be abolished before the next election\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! District\n! colspan=\"2\" | Assemblyman\n! Party\n! colspan=\"2\" | Councillor\n!
