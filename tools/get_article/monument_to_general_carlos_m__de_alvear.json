It was raised in honor of Carlos María de Alvear (1788-1852).\nIt is a work by French sculptor Antoine Bourdelle. It is considered by the author as his masterpiece in the great monuments.\nIn 1912, Rodolfo Alcorta, a friend of Bourdelle, invited the sculptor to participate in a concours for the realization of this monument. He received the commission in 1913. The author took nearly ten years to complete the sculpture. Once finished the monument was shipped to Buenos Aires from France in 1925.\nThe sculpture and the pedestal of polished pink granite adorned with additional bronzes by the artist, stands in its current location since 12 October 1926.\nLocation\nLocated on the Plaza Julio de Caro, next to the Palais de Glace, located across Avenida Alvear, right next to the Plaza Intendente Alvear, exactly opposite the work that honors her son Torcuato de Alvear.
