Their original purpose was to collect underwater acoustical information using the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS), a towed array passive sonar.\nStalwart, Indomitable, and Capable were modified to support narcotics interdiction by removing SURTASS equipment and adding an air-search radar and tactical data link equipment.[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_print.asp?cid=4500&tid=300&ct=4&page=1 The US Navy]\nUnits\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ship Name\n!Hull No.\n!Delivery-Stricken\n!Fate\n!Link\n|-\n|Stalwart||1||1984–2002||State University of New York Maritime College|| [http://www.navsource.net/archives/09/66/6601.htm NavSource]\n|-\n|Contender||2||1984–1992||T/V General Rudder, flagship and training vessel of the Texas A&M University at Galveston|| [http://www.navsource.net/archives/09/66/6602.htm NavSource]\n|-\n|Vindicator||3||1984–1993||NOAA ''Hi'Ialakai (R-334)|| [http://www.navsource.net/archives/09/66/6603.htm NavSource] [http://www.moc.noaa.gov/hi/index.htm NOAA]\n|-\n|Triumph||4||1985–1995||Stricken, to be disposed of in support of Fleet training exercise|| [http://www.navsource.net/archives/09/66/6604.htm NavSource]\n|-\n|Assurance||5||1985–1995||Transferred to Portugal as NRP Almirante Gago Coutinho (A523)|| [http://www.navsource.net/archives/09/66/6605.htm NavSource]\n|-\n|Persistent||6||1985–1995||T/S State of Michigan, Great Lakes Maritime Academy, Traverse City, Michigan|| [http://www.navsource.net/archives/09/66/6606.htm NavSource] [http://www.nmc.edu/maritime/vessels/state-of-michigan/ NMC]\n|-\n|Indomitable||7||1985–2002||NOAA McArthur II (R-330)|| [http://www.navsource.net/archives/09/66/6607.htm NavSource] [http://www.moc.noaa.gov/mt/index.html NOAA]\n|-\n|||8||1986–||Reclassified as Unclassified miscellaneous vessel Prevail (IX-537)||  [http://www.navsource.net/archives/09/66/6608.htm NavSource]\n|-\n|Assertive||9||1986–2004||Transferred to NOAA to be converted FY 2007 and to replace NOAA David Starr Jordan''.
