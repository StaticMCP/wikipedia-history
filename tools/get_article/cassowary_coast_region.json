It was created in 2008 from a merger of the Shire of Cardwell and the Shire of Johnstone.\nThe Regional Council, which administers the region, has an estimated operating budget of A$64 million.\nIn the , the Cassowary Coast Region had a population of 29,157 people.\nHistory\nPrior to the 2008 amalgamation, the Cassowary Coast Region consisted of the entire area of two previous local government areas:\n*Shire of Cardwell\n*Shire of Johnstone\nThe Hinchinbrook Division was created on 11 November 1879 as one of 74 divisions around Queensland under the Divisional Boards Act 1879. On 28 October 1881, the Johnstone Division split away from it. On 18 January 1884, the Cardwell Division also split away. With the passage of the Local Authorities Act 1902, both Cardwell and Johnstone became shires on 31 March 1903.\nIn July 2007, the Local Government Reform Commission released its report and recommended that Cardwell and Johnstone merge. Cardwell was in particular opposed because Johnstone was rated as \"financially distressed\" and its council had just been sacked by the state government. On 15 March 2008, the two shires formally ceased to exist, and elections were held on the same day to elect six councillors and a mayor to the Regional Council.\nMayors\n* 2008–2016: Bill Shannon\n* 2016–2020: John Kremastos\n*2020–2024: Timothy Mark Nolan\n*2024-present: Teresa Millwood\nWards and councillors\n|border=silver}} Independent (7)}}\n}}\n| last_election1 = 28 March 2020\n| next_election1 = 16 March 2024\n}}\nAlthough the commission recommended the council be undivided with six councillors and a mayor, the gazetted form was that of six divisions each electing a single councillor, plus a mayor.\nBelow is the current council, elected in 2024:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
