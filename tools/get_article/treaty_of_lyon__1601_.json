      "text": "# Treaty of Lyon (1601)\n\nThe Treaty of Lyon was signed on 17 January 1601 between France and Savoy, to bring an end to the Franco-Savoyard War of 1600–1601. Based on the terms of the treaty, Henry IV of France relinquished Saluzzo to Savoy, while Savoy kept Pont de Gresin, Valserine, and was required to pay France 150,000 livres. In return, Henry acquired Bugey, Valromey, Gex, and Bresse.\nEventually, the territory of Bresse was attached to the French military government of Burgundy.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061230101036/http://www.regione.piemonte.it/lingue/english/pagine/cultura/approfondimenti/12_saluzzo_eng.pdf Saluzzo]\n*\n*[http://www.cnn.com/almanac/9801/17/ Almanac - January 17]\n*[http://p2.www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9016368 Encyclopædia Britannica - Bresse]"
