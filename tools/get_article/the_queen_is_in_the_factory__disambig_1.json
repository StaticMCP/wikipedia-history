The domestic distribution of the mobile was forbidden by Turkish authorities due to \"moral incabbalities\".\nPlot\nYağmur (Dicle Kartal) is a young woman with very strict boundaries. She lives in Istanbul and works as a fashion editor. Yağmur doesn't accept the fact that her brother Bulut (Çağrı Aslan) is gay. Bulut, wishing to be a play writer someday created himself a world in his home where he can play Andy Warhol. And he named it Factory.\nLife is a struggle for these two high-class children. While Yağmur is fighting against her boyfriend's (Fatih Günaydın) marriage expectations, Bulut is trying to fall in step with his boyfriend's life (Şenol Demir). While these two different relationships have their own battles trying to survive in some way, a death will change everything.\nCast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  Actor !!
