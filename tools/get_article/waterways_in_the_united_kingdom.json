The beginning of the 19th century saw a move from roads to waterways, (i.e. canals, rivers, firths, and estuaries).\nRivers in the United Kingdom\nMajor navigable rivers include the Humber, Mersey, Yorkshire Ouse, Severn, Thames and Trent.  Some minor navigable rivers may be classified as canals.  Others include the Warwickshire Avon, the Bristol Avon.\nThere are also the subterranean rivers of London, and the Jubilee River, which, although man-made, was designed to look and act like a natural river rather than a canal.\nCanals in the United Kingdom\nTyle Mill Lock (Kennet & Avon Canal).]]\nThe canals of the United Kingdom are a major part of the network of inland waterways. They are used for irrigation and transport and were a key part of the Industrial Revolution. Today, they are also used for recreational boating.\nStatistics\nSee also\n*British Waterways Waterscape\n*Canal & River Trust\n*Inland Waterways Association\n*Falkirk Helix\n*Geography of the United Kingdom\n*List of navigation authorities in the United Kingdom\n*List of waterway societies in the United Kingdom\n*World Canals Conference\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
