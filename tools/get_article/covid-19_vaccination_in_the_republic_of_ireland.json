Ireland's vaccination rollout has been praised as one of the most successful rollouts in the world and was ranked number one in the European Union in terms of its percentage of adult population fully vaccinated, and was also ranked number one in the EU for the number of booster vaccines administered.\nAs of 20 February 2023, 12,744,694 vaccine doses have been administered, of which 4,107,865 people have received at least one dose, 3,819,227 have received their second dose and 4,817,602 have received a booster dose.\nBackground\nPreparations\nOn 1 December 2020, the Government of Ireland approved an advance purchase agreement for 875,000 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.\nOn 15 December, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly announced the Government's National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, which outlined the country's high-level plan for safe, effective and efficient vaccination of the Republic of Ireland, while safeguarding continued provision of health and social care services.\nOn 17 January 2021, the Government requested early deliveries of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as discussions to secure early delivery of the vaccine got underway.\nVaccines on order\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Vaccine\n!Approval\n!Deployment\n|-\n|Pfizer–BioNTech\n|\n|\n|-\n|Moderna\n|\n|\n|-\n|Oxford–AstraZeneca\n|\n|\n|-\n|Janssen\n|\n|\n|-\n|Novavax\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nCOVID-19 booster campaign\nThe Health Service Executive (HSE) announced on 24 September that immunocompromised people aged over 12 would be notified of an appointment for a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine from Wednesday 29 September, as Ireland's COVID-19 booster vaccination campaign would commence. In addition, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee recommended additional vaccines be given to elderly people aged over 80 and to anyone over 65 in a long-term care facility.\nOn 19 October, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) approved vaccine boosters for people aged 60 and over.\nOn 1 November, following new advice from NIAC, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly authorised the use of booster vaccines for healthcare staff, while boosters were extended to people aged 50 to 59, those aged 16 to 59 with an underlying condition and all long-term healthcare facility residents on 16 November.

The card contains the recipient's name, the dates on which the two doses were administered, the name of the vaccine, and its batch number. The vaccine record card, along with the EU Digital COVID Certificate, were used as proofs of vaccination in restaurants, hotels and bars to gain access to indoor hospitality, as well as in nightclubs, indoor live entertainment, cinemas, theatres and gyms.

The first full meeting of the task force took place on 23 November 2020 and was chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith.\nMembers of the High-Level Task Force on COVID-19 Vaccination are made up of senior representatives from the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the Office of Government Procurement, IDA Ireland, the Dublin Airport Authority, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of the Taoiseach.\nThe National Immunisation Advisory Committee (an independent body outside of the HSE) provides expert, evidence-based and impartial guidance about the COVID-19 vaccines to the Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health.\nProgress to date\n|width=\n|align=none\n|caption=Total eligible population vaccinated\n}}\n|border=no\n|mode=\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"800\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:98%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |Uptake by age group\n|-\n!Age group\n!Third booster\n!Second booster\n!First booster\n!Primary course\n!At least one dose\n!Not vaccinated\n|-\n|80+ years\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|60+ years\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|50–59 years\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|25–49 years\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|18–24 years\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

On 19 March, the NIAC recommended that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine could continue to be used in Ireland following approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 18 March.\nOn 8 April, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) began an investigation after the first case of a very rare blood clot in the brain of a person after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine was confirmed in a 40-year-old Dublin woman.\nOn 12 April, following a lengthy meeting, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommend that only people over 60 years of age should get the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and that a second dose of the vaccine should not be given to anyone who developed unusual blood clots with low platelets after the first dose.\nOn 17 August, a 23-year-old man from Waterford died five days after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. In September 2024, an inquest into his death was told that he had suffered convulsions at home and was rushed to hospital where he was put on a life support machine. He died after a large haematoma in his brain caused a catastrophic intercranial bleed. The inquest heard he was a \"perfectly healthy young man before the vaccine\" who was a \"keen soccer player\" for Waterford F.C. and a \"natural leader\". Medics at Janssen gave evidence at the inquest and concluded there was \"insufficient evidence” to link the haemorrhage to the vaccine.\nHospitals\nOn 26 March 2021, the Labour Party leader Alan Kelly called for the chief executive of the Beacon Hospital to resign after it gave 20 leftover COVID-19 vaccines to a number of teachers and staff at a private secondary school in Bray, County Wicklow on 23 March. One day later on 27 March, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly requested the Health Service Executive (HSE) to suspend vaccine operations at the Beacon Hospital following the controversy. On 19 July, four months after the controversy, an independent report found that the decision by the hospital to provide vaccines to 20 teachers at the Bray school was incorrect, but was made in good faith.\nOn 1 April, an independent review of the COVID-19 vaccination programme at the Coombe Hospital found that a consultant brought two leftover vaccine doses home to administer them to two family members.\nOpposition to age-based overhaul of vaccines\nOn 30 March 2021, a decision by the Government to overhaul the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines to an age-based system sparked anger and concern among teachers' unions and key workers. The new change meant that key workers in essential jobs and the education sector who couldn't avoid a high risk of exposure to the virus would lose vaccine prioritisation. Ireland's largest teaching union, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO), strongly criticised moves to change the vaccination rollout plan stating it was \"extremely concerned\" by the news, while the Teachers' Union of Ireland (TUI) echoed concerns and called for urgent engagement with the Department of Education. The Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland (ASTI) stated it was \"shocked and dismayed\" by the changes and claimed the decision was \"totally at odds\" with the objective to keep schools open, while the president of the Garda Representative Association (GRA) described the change as \"a sucker punch\" to their members, and that the decision \"downgraded\" the work of Gardaí and disregarded the risks they took while policing the pandemic. On 7 April, the three teacher unions voted for an emergency motion backing industrial action, up to and including strike action, if they were not prioritised for vaccination.\nHealth Service Executive ransomware attack\nOn 14 May 2021, the COVID-19 vaccination registration portal was made offline after the Health Service Executive (HSE) shut down all of its IT systems after a major ransomware attack, but was later restored in the evening.\nAnti-vaccine protests\n]]\nOn 24 July 2021, around 1,500 protestors gathered in Dublin city centre to protest against vaccines, new legislation allowing for the reopening of indoor dining and the EU Digital COVID Certificate.\nOn 27 November, thousands of people attended a protest against COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine passports at the GPO on Dublin's O'Connell Street.\nSee also\n*Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland (2020)\n*Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland (2021)\n*Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland (2022)\n*Deployment of COVID-19 vaccines\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/199e6-covid-19-vaccine/ Gov.ie – COVID-19 Vaccine]\n* [https://covid19ireland-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/pages/vaccinations Ireland's COVID-19 Data Hub – Vaccinations]"
