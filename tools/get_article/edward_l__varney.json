His firm would continue designing buildings into the 1990s.\nLife and career\nEdward Leighton Varney Jr. was born on October 11, 1914, in Alameda, California, the son of Edward Leighton, and Frances Deane, Varney. He attended the University of California at Berkeley before transferring to the University Southern California where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in architecture in 1938. That same year he moved to Phoenix and took a job with O.A. Bell Architects working as a draftsman on the Arizona Capital addition. In 1941, he partnered with Charles Gilmore and started the firm of Gilmore & Varney. In 1946 after Charles Gilmore unexpectedly died of a heart attack, Varney reorganized his firm into, Edward L. Varney Associates. He was soon joined by Reginald Sydnor, and Robert Sexton and in 1965 the firm was reorganized into Varney, Sexton, Sydnor Associates.  Varney's firm specialized in designing industrial facilities such as those for Motorola, General Electric, Sperry Rand and Emerson Electric. The firm also specialized in educational structures designing several buildings on the Tempe campus of Arizona State University as well as many schools for the local school districts. Varney is credited with mentoring some influential architects in Arizona, including Ralph Haver, Richard E. Drover, and Frederick P. Weaver. in 1971, Varney was made a fellow in the American Institute of Architects. In 1980, Reginald Sydnor, a partner in the firm, took early retirement. The firm was subsequently reorganized into Varney, Sexton, Lunsford, Aye Associates with John C. Lunsford and Khin Aye becoming partners. Varney retired in 1985 and died on June 30, 1998.
