The prize is awarded for results that contribute to the prestige of the Institute in international comparison, and which have been published at most five years prior with an affiliation of the Institute. At the award ceremony, the laureate gives a lecture and receives a diploma.\nEstablished and awarded since 2009, the prize honours exceptional achievements among early-career scientists. It promotes and encourages young scientific talent, offering visibility and recognition for junior researchers in astronomy. Such a recognition of high-impact work in astronomy, ranging from exoplanets to star cluster physics, makes it both an important motivator and a prestigious mark of within the Czech and global astronomy community.\nJan Ludvík Frič\nThe Jan Frič Award is named after the younger of the Frič brothers, who did not live to see their shared dream of building an observatory in Ondřejov. Since 2009, the premium has always been awarded on the date close to the sudden death of Jan Frič, i.e. on 21st January. The Astronomical Institute of the CAS also uses this opportunity to honours Frič's memory. [https://www.asu.cas.cz/cz/veda-a-vyzkum/oceneni]\nJan Frič (13 February 1863, Paris – 21 January 1897, Prague) was a physicist, chemist and an entrepreneur. He and his brother Josef Frič founded the factory for the production of optical-mechanical instruments \"Josef and Jan Frič\". They also devoted time and effort to astronomy, especially astronomical photography. However, only Josef Frič founded the observatory in Ondřejov in 1898, because his younger brother died in 1897 at the age of 34 from complications after surgery.\nLaureates\n* 2009 - Adéla Kawka, Ph.D.\n* 2010 - Mgr.
