A nature trail and outdoor classroom area was constructed adjacent to the campus in 1990 with help from the International Paper Company. In 2006, a new Fine Arts building was constructed to house the Big Blue Band and Choral programs. As of 201920 the school reported 1,331 students enrolled.\nExtra-curricular activities\nThe school hosts a variety of extra-curricular activities such as Mock Trial, National Honor Society, FIRST Robotics, Quiz Bowl, Future Teachers of America, Red Cross, First Priority, Beta Club, Mu Alpha Theta, 4-H, FBLA, NorseStar (student newspaper), Valhalla (yearbook), GIVE (Gentlemen of Integrity, Valor and Excellence), and others.\nAthletics\nWCHS' athletic teams are known as the Vikings (men's) and Lady Vikes (women's).
