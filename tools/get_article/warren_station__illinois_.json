Located at the intersection of Railroad Street and Burnett Avenue in Warren, the station served the Black Hawk from February&nbsp;13, 1974, to September&nbsp;30, 1981. The station consisted of one side platform with a depot, which has since been demolished. Prior to Amtrak, the station served trains operated by the Illinois Central Railroad, which began service on January&nbsp;9, 1854, when service was extended  northwest from Freeport. Service continued until April&nbsp;30, 1971, when the Hawkeye (Waterloo&ndash;Chicago) was discontinued on the day before Amtrak began passenger service.\nBibliography\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.trainweb.org/usarail/warren.htm Warren, Illinois– TrainWeb]"
