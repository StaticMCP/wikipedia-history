It is the result of an early experiment in electronic content delivery via the Internet. The journal publishes commentary and criticism on a wide range of concerns including literary theory, politics, and contemporary society. Occasionally, the journal will feature special issues centered on a specific theme within the arena of postmodernism. It is published three times a year in September, January, and May by the Johns Hopkins University Press. The current editor is Eyal Amiran (University of California-Irvine).\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/ Postmodern Culture] at Project MUSE"
