The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since.\nAs of 2025, Nigeria ha submitted three films, but none of them were nominated.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Nigeria for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\nIts first submission, Lionheart (2019), was disqualified as the majority of the film's dialogue was in English. However, the following year, the Nigerian Oscar Selection Committee announced that AMPAS would allow films that are primarily in Pidgin English to be eligible for submission.\nIn 2022, Nigeria's Oscar Selection Committee announced they received three Yoruba-language submissions: Aníkúlápó, ''Elesin Oba, The King's Horseman and King of Thieves. They determined they would not enter because a majority of the selection committee voted that all three films were \"non-eligible.\"\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
