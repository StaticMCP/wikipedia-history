Although the United States Virgin Islands will not participate in the 2024 presidential general election because it is a U.S. territory and not a state, it equally participated in the U.S. presidential caucuses and primaries. The caucus took place the same day as the Nevada caucuses.\nThe caucus was won by former President Donald Trump, defeating former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. Trump won with 187 votes, winning all of the territory's convention delegates. The Republican Party in the Virgin Islands selected nine delegates, although the number of delegates seated by the convention may be reduced to as few as four due to alleged violations of national Republican rules.\nProcedure\nUnder RNC Rule No. 16(c)(2), any caucus held prior to March 15 must allocate its delegates proportionally to the number of votes for each candidate. The RNC alleged that using ranked-choice voting before March 15, 2024, was a violation of RNC rules.\nControversy\nThe number of delegates for the U.S. Virgin Islands may be reduced due to a Republican National Convention (RNC) rule violation.\nThe Republican Party in the Virgin Islands scheduled its caucus before March 15 and used ranked-choice voting instead of a proportional system. Party leaders attempted to oust chairman Gordon Ackley due to the disagreement, though RNC Chief Counsel Matt Raymer ruled that the meeting was not held in compliance with \"party rules\".\nCandidates\n*Donald Trump\n*Nikki Haley\n*Chris Christie (withdrawn)\n*Ron DeSantis (withdrawn)\n*Perry Johnson (withdrawn)\n*Vivek Ramaswamy (withdrawn)\nResults\nThe Republican Party in the U.S. Virgin Islands awarded all delegates to Trump.\nSee also\n* 2024 U.S. Virgin Islands Democratic presidential caucuses\n* 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* 2024 United States elections\nReferences"
