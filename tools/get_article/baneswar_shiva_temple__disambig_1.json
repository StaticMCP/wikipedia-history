All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map.\nThe temple\nThe beginning of Baneswar Shiva temple is mired in mythology. According to popular belief the legendary Raja Banasura, an ardent devotee of Shiva had made the latter agree to come down to earth. When Shiva was following Raja Banasura, the latter suddenly stopped at Baneswar (earlier name Gordasandara), which was a breach of agreement. Shiva instantly disappeared and later established a Shiva-linga on the banks of the Bangti River. Many believe that the place was named after the Raja. However, there is no mention of the temple in the legend.\nAccording to some, the temple was built by Raja Jalpeswar, who built the Jalpesh temple. He is believed to have ruled in the second or third century and is mentioned in ‘Jalpesh Mahatya’. Some others think that Raja Nilambar of the Khen dynasty had built it. Yet others think that Maharaja Nara Narayan of the Koch dynasty established it and Maharaja Pran Narayan of the Cooch Behar State subsequently revamped it.\nThe present structure is squarish with a dome and a slightly curved cornish. It has two entrances -one on the west and the other in the east. The temple has a Shiva linga and a ‘Gouripat’ in the garbhagriha,  below the plinth level. The temple was slightly tilted on the east during an earth-quake in 1897. It has a height of  and the base measures  square. The walls are  thick. There are some decorated narrow strips on the walls. It has a raised platform in the front. There is a bull made of cement on the right. On the northern side there is a tin shed housing idols of Shiva and ‘ardhanariswar’. There are some other idols also, including a Kali idol in another shed.\nThere is a big pond nearby 'Shiv pukur' which is a habitat of many Black softshell turtle, a critically endangered species of turtle. The turtles are locally known as 'Mohan' and are sacred.\nA week-long fair is held during Shiva Chaturdashi. This temple is under the Cooch Behar Debuttor Sangstha.\nBaneswar Shiva temple is a state protected monument.\nBaneswar Shiva temple picture gallery\nFile:Baneshwar Shiva Temple at Cooch Behar District in West Bengal 12.jpg\nFile:Baneshwar Shiva Temple at Cooch Behar District in West Bengal 16.jpg\nFile:Baneshwar Shiva Temple at Cooch Behar District in West Bengal 17.jpg\nReferences"
