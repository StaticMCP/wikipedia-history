The clash occurred at the mountain fortress of Kakavaberd (also known as Kegh), located in modern-day Gegharkunik Province, Armenia.\nThe fortress was first recorded by the 10th‑century historian Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi in his History of Armenia as part of the noble Bagratuni holdings.\n| strength1         = Small garrison (unknown)\n| strength2         = Several thousand (unknown)\n| casualties1       = Heavy\n| casualties2       = Heavy\n}}\nBackground\nAfter the defeat of Arab forces at the Battle of Sevan  in 921, Emir Beshir launched a retaliatory campaign into Bagratuni-held territories. The mountain stronghold of Kakavaberd (Kegh) became a key target due to its strategic location in the Gegharkunik highlands.\nBattle\nAccording to Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi, Beshir's forces attacked Kakavaberd but were met by a small garrison under Gevorg Marzpetuni. Despite being outnumbered, the Armenians launched a sortie that inflicted severe losses. Beshir was reportedly wounded during the encounter and forced to withdraw.\nIssaverdens describes the clash similarly, noting that after the engagement, local populations abandoned several fortresses out of fear of renewed Arab raids.\nAftermath\nThe battle reinforced the reputation of Kakavaberd as a critical defensive site in medieval Armenia. The Bagratuni control of the fortress continued through the 10th century, though the region remained contested in the Arab–Armenian frontier wars.\nSee also\n* Bagratuni dynasty\n* Arab–Byzantine wars\n* Battle of Sevan\nReferences"
