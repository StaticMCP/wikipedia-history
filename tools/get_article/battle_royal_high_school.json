At the same time, unbeknownst to him, he is the prophesied vessel of Lord Byōdo, demon king of the Dark Realm, who learns his dark energy is empowering Hyōdo through a dimensional gate to produce a legendary warrior. Wanting to investigate this, Byōdo travels to Earth and supernaturally freezes the school to challenge Hyōdo. The boy defeats the demon's spirits, but is easily submitted himself by Byōdo, who reveals they are both the same being and, suspecting the prophecy to be a trap, fuses them together in Hyōdo's body to absorb his power. Hyōdo believes the whole ordeal to be just a dream.\nShortly after, Space-Time Continuum Inspector Zankan arrives to Earth after detecting demonic activity, and he witnesses a young man with spiritual powers, Toshimitsu Yūki, fighting and destroying man-possessing monsters. Next day, Yūki ambushes Hyōdo, feeling the dark energy inside him and wrongly believing him to be the master of the demons, and it takes Byōdo's power to stop him. Byōdo has deduced the culprit is his own demon lieutenant, Fairy Master Kain, who has secretly betrayed him, and proposes Yūki to team up in order to defeat her and her servants. Meanwhile, Kain deceives Megumi Koyama, a girl with an unrequited love for Hyōdo, and uses her emotions to create a demon and attack Hyōdo's close friend Ryōko Takayanagi. Zankan saves Takayanagi and interrogates her about Hyōdo, after which the latter uses his power to make her forget the encounter.\nZankan meets Hyōdo and allies temporally with him after a friendly spar, while Kain visits Yūki in his shrine and possesses him. During a school event, Hyōdo saves Megumi from demon-possessed students, but she is also infected by a demon and he is forced spend a lot of energy to destroy and resurrect her. At the same time, Zankan is attacked by Yūki-Kain, who defeats him and is about to kill him before Hyōdo intervenes. Hyōdo and Kain face off, wrecking the school in the process, and although Kain has the upper hand, Byōdo manages to take over momentarily and destroy her. After the battle, with Zankan's memory of the events erased, everything returns to normal.\nCredits\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Cast\n|-\n!Character\n!Japanese\n!English\n|-\n!Riki Hyōdo\n|Kazuki Yao\n|Michael Granberry\n|-\n!Byōdo\n|Kazuki Yao\n|Michael Granberry\n|-\n!Toshihiro Yūki\n|Kazuhiko Inoue\n|Michael Granberry (as G.
