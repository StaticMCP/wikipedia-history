Sonski won the ASP primary and nomination of the party for President of the United States on June 3, 2023. The primary was conducted by an online members' vote. The vice presidential nominee, Lauren Onak, was selected by Sonski before the national convention in early July in Plano, Texas, and she was formally nominated. The party was on the ballot in Arkansas, Alaska, Florida, Ohio, Hawaii, Louisiana and Mississippi and was a registered write-in option in a further 36 states.\nBackground\nThe American Solidarity Party, founded in 2011, first contested a presidential campaign in 2016 getting ballot access to one state and earning 6,697 votes. In 2020 they were on the ballot on 8 states and received 42,305 votes. For their 2024 attempt it was announced on June 2, 2023, that Peter Sonski had won their party's online primary, which lasted from May 24 to June 1 of that year, in which all ASP members could vote. Sonski was nominated in the first round of ranked-choice voting with 52%. Sonski then selected Lauren Onak as his vice president, who was then officially nominated via unanimous consent of the delegates at the national convention.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable tpl-blanktable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|+ American Solidarity Party presidential nomination\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Votes\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Percentage\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#F37120\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Peter Sonski\n| 328\n| 52.5%\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Jacqueline Abernathy\n| 207\n| 33.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Joe Schriner\n| 50\n| 8.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Larry Johnson\n| 24\n| 3.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Erskine Levi\n| 16\n| 2.6\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#eee;\"\n!Total:\n!625\n!100.00%\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Source:\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable tpl-blanktable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|+ American Solidarity Party vice presidential nomination\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Votes\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Percentage\n|-\n|-style=\"background:#F37120\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Lauren Onak\n|colspan=\"2\"|Nominated via Unanimous Consent\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Source:\n|}\nSonski and Onak\nPeter Sonski (born July 11, 1962) is an American former radio host, who served as an elected member of Connecticut's Regional School District 17 Board of Education and as director of the Knights of Columbus Museum.\nCampaign\nIn September 2023 Crossview Podcast interviewed Sonski with a discussion of \"faith, the duopoly and third parties, government's role in handling covid, immigration, foreign policy, moral issues, education, and more.\"\nIn December 2023 Fr. Dwight Longenecker published an interview on The Stream in which Sonski explained that \"third parties provide thoughtful alternatives and allow other voices to be heard, and this is important in a democratic system.\"\nIn January 2024 Catholic News Agency interviewed Sonski in which he said that he wants to \"provide a means for Catholics to vote in accord with the conscience, rather than just for the 'lesser of two evils.'\" Crisis Magazine also published an interview, conducted by Fr. Dwight Longenecker, which describes how Sonski \"was born into a blue-collar Catholic family and went on to work in agriculture, insurance, journalism, and public relations.\"\nIn April 2024, Christianity Today reported that Evangelicals disaffected with the two main parties were beginning to get their support.\nIn June 2024, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Church were the first major Protestant organization to give them coverage with a four-part series that looked at the various parties in the election.\nIn July 2024, soon after the Republican National Convention, the National Review characterized the Solidarity Party as the only current anti-abortion party,  contrasting with the Democratic and Republican parties; the latter especially so because of a perceived softening of their stance on abortion in their platform which they released at their convention.\nAleteia published an interview of Sonski in which he described the American Solidarity Party as \"predominantly centrist – a little right on social issues, a little left on fiscal issues.\"\nAlso that month, EWTN's News In Depth interviewed Sonski in which he said, \"My faith informs all my decisions.\"\nIn August 2024, the American Reformer magazine acknowledging that evangelicals critical of Donald Trump were \"flocking to the American Solidarity party\" wrote a critical assessment of the campaign urging evangelicals to think twice before voting for Sonski, stating that \"stakes are too high too high and the country on the brink\" and that \"at the presidential level votes should not be wasted on quixotic schemes\"\nLater in August, New Jersey Republicans successfully launched a legal challenge against Sonski's position on the New Jersey ballot, claiming some of his ballot access signatures were invalid. Sonski ultimately did not appear on the ballot in that state.\nAgain in August, the Gospel Coalition, an evangelical group, published an article comparing the Democratic, Republican, Solidarity, and Constitution parties' stances on key social issues.\nThat same month, The Pillar, a Catholic news agency, profiled the campaign, conducting an interview with Sonski.\nNCR did a piece on how difficult it was for the Sonski campaign to get Ballot access during the election.\nBallot access\nCorrect as of Sept 17, 2024:\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Total Possible\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|2024\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|2020\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|2016\n|-\n!States & DC (inc Write in)\n|align=center|51\n|align=center|7 (45)\n|align=center|8 (39)\n|align=center|1 (26)\n|-\n!Electoral Votes (inc Write in)\n|align=center|538\n|align=center|74 (480)\n|align=center|66 (397)\n|align=center|9 (323)\n|-\n!Percent of EVs (inc Write in)\n|align=center|100%\n|align=center|13.8% (89.2%)\n|align=center|12.3% (73.8%)\n|align=center|1.7% (60%)\n|Alabama\n|align=center|9\n|align=center|write-in\n|align=center|write-in\n|align=center|write-in\n|-\n|Alaska\n|align=center|3\n|style=\"text-align:center;
