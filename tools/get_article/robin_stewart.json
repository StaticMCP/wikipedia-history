He was best known for playing Mike Abbott, the son of Sid James' character Sid Abbott in the 1970s sitcom Bless This House.\nEarly life\nStewart was born Robin Guy Henry Steuer in Calcutta, British India to a Jewish father, Maximilian Steuer (1902–1978) and British mother, Dorothy Evelyn Beer (1906–1966).\nCareer\nStewart acted on television and in feature films in both the UK and Australia. Some of his British film roles include Tamahine, The Haunted House of Horror, Cromwell, Adventures of a Private Eye, and The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires as Leyland Van Helsing.\nHe played the role of Mike Abbott in sit-com series Bless This House during its entire 1971–76 run; due to prior commitments he did not feature in the film version of the series. After being asked to go to New Zealand for a telethon and subsequently taken back to host his own show, Stewart ended up being asked to relocate where he became involved with such soaps as The Young Doctors as a villainous character trying to silence a blind patient who had overheard his criminal acts, and Sons and Daughters as the villainous doctor Ross Newman.\nOther roles in Australia included a lead role in sex comedy feature film Pacific Banana (1981), and an appearance in prison based soap opera Punishment. He was also one of the main characters in The Timeless Land, playing the role of John MacArthur. He played one of the supporting roles in the rock series Sweet and Sour for ABC; co-hosted Good Morning Sydney with Maureen Duval. Briefly he was the advertising executive for Rolling Stone magazine. He briefly co-produced weekly magazine program Midweek Live for DDQ TV in Toowoomba with presenter Craig Berkman in early 1990. For 18 months Stewart was the senior producer for FNQTV in Cairns.\nPersonal life\nAfter two brief earlier marriages (the second to magazine fashion editor, Fiona Partridge), he married Roberta \"Bertie\" Daler in 2012 and they had one daughter. Stewart suffered a stroke in 2003 and, having been a 60 cigarettes a day smoker, also developed emphysema.\nHis death on 22 November 2015 was announced on his official website. He was 69 years old.\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|1961\n|Greyfriars Bobby\n|Jodie Ross\n|Uncredited\n|-\n|1962\n|H.M.S.
