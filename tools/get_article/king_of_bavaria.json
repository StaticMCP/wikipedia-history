It was the second time Bavaria was a kingdom, almost a thousand years after the short-lived Carolingian kingdom of Bavaria.\nHistory\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Pressburg concluded 26 December 1805 between French Emperor Napoleon and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, several principalities allied to Napoleon were elevated to kingdoms. One of the staunchest of these had been the prince-elector of Bavaria, Maximilian IV Joseph, and on 1 January 1806, he assumed formally the title King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. He was a member of the Wittelsbach branch Palatinate-Birkenfeld-Zweibrücken.\nMaximilian's successors resisted German nationalism, and Bavaria became the protector of smaller states whose leaders felt threatened by Prussia or Austria in the German Confederation. Religious ties and the Upper German language linked the state more to Austria until their defeat in the Austro-Prussian War. King Ludwig II signed an alliance with Prussia on 22 August 1866, effectively relinquishing Bavarian independence.\nWith the treaty of 23 November 1870 Bavaria was integrated into the new German Empire, but permitted a relatively large degree of self-determination. The Kings of Bavaria maintained their titles, and maintained separate diplomatic and military corps. When the German Empire was abolished in November 1918 after the end of World War I, the last king of Bavaria, Ludwig III, was deposed.\nKings of Bavaria\n* Maximilian I Joseph 1805–1825\n* Ludwig I 1825–1848 (d. 1868)\n* Maximilian II 1848–1864\n* Ludwig II 1864–1886\n* Otto 1886–1913 (d. 1916)\n** Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, Regent 1886–1912\n** Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, Regent 1912–1913\n* Ludwig III 1913–1918\nThe title King of Bavaria is sometimes used in reference to Carolingian kings ruling over Bavaria.

In the course of these events, Bavaria once again became an ally of France, and Maximilian IV Joseph abandoned his Electoral title — as there would soon be no Emperor to elect — for the title of King of Bavaria, becoming Maximilian I Joseph on 1 January 1806.\n|- style=\"background:#fff\"\n| Ludwig I\n|\n| King of Bavaria\n| 1825 || 1848\n| Wittelsbach\n| His Majesty Ludwig, King of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia and in Swabia, Count Palatine of the Rhine.\n| Son of Maximilian I Joseph.\nAbdicated in the Revolutions of 1848.\n|- style=\"background:#fff\"\n| Maximilian II Joseph\n|\n| King of Bavaria\n| 1848 || 1864\n| Wittelsbach\n| His Majesty Maximilian, King of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia and in Swabia, Count Palatine of the Rhine.\n| Son of Ludwig I.\n|- style=\"background:#fff\"\n| Ludwig II\n|\n| King of Bavaria\n| 1864 || 1886\n| Wittelsbach\n| His Majesty Ludwig, King of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia and in Swabia, Count Palatine of the Rhine.\n| Son of Maximilian II Joseph.\nLudwig II was called the Märchenkönig (fairy-tale king).

In 1999 Duke Franz, with the agreement of the other members of the house, amended the house laws further to allow the succession of the sons of any princes who married with the permission of the head of the house.\nFranz has never married. The heir presumptive to the headship of the House of Wittelsbach is his brother Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria. Because Max has five daughters but no sons, he is followed in the line of succession by his and Franz's first cousin (and second cousin in the male line) Prince Luitpold.Genealogie des Hauses Wittelsbach.
