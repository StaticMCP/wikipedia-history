The senior commander surviving, Lord Lucan, was not present; the newspaper account suggests that he was not invited.\nIn the article, there were reproduced the recollections of a number of the survivors including those of Edward Richard Woodham.  The Hussars' museum has confirmed that Edward Richard Woodham had enlisted in the 11th Hussars in June 1847 and that after the \"Charge\" he had spent a short period in hospital. The Bristol Town Council archive office has confirmed that Edward Richard Woodham was born on 20 February 1831 and his father (a cooper) was born on 18 November 1798.  Both were born in Bristol and were baptised at St. Paul's Church in Bristol.\nHe died on 12 December 1886, aged 55.\nReferences\n^ Dutton, Roy (2007).
