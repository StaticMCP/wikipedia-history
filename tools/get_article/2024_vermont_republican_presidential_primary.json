The contest was held on Super Tuesday alongside primaries in 14 other states. Nikki Haley won the primary against Donald Trump, making her the first woman to win a state in a Republican presidential primary, and first nonwhite woman to win a presidential primary of a major party. Haley was awarded nine delegates and Trump was awarded eight delegates. Haley won Chittenden County, Grand Isle County, Lamoille County, Washington County, Addison County, Windsor County, and Windham County. Trump won Franklin County, Orleans County, Essex County, Caledonia County, Orange County, Rutland County, and Bennington County.\nThis was the first Republican primary since 2000 in which Vermont did not vote for the winner of the nomination.\nThe Vermont primary was the only state primary, and one of only two primaries along with the District of Columbia primary, of the 2024 Republican presidential primaries that Donald Trump lost. The state has an open primary system, which allows any registered voter to vote in the Republican nominating contest.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates filed:\n* Donald Trump\n* Nikki Haley\n* Ryan Binkley (withdrew on February 27, 2024)\n* Ron DeSantis (withdrew on January 21, 2024)\n* Vivek Ramaswamy (withdrew on January 15, 2024)\n* Chris Christie (withdrew on January 10, 2024)\nEndorsements\n*Jim Douglas, former Governor of Vermont (2003–2011)\nState Representatives\n*Patricia McCoy, Minority Leader of the Vermont House of Representatives (2019–present) from Rutland-1 (2015–present)\n*Ashley Bartley, (2023–present) from Franklin-1\n}}\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!
