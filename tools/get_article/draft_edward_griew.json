He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and studied law at University College London (UCL), graduating with an LL.B. of high distinction. He later completed an M.A. in legal studies.\nCall to the Bar and early practice\nGriew was called to the Bar at Gray’s Inn in 1950. He practiced as a barrister in criminal law and contributed early writings to the Criminal Law Review. He remained a member of Gray’s Inn and was appointed Queen’s Counsel in the late 1960s. He also served part-time as a Recorder from the early 1970s.\nAcademic career\nGriew lectured at UCL before joining the University of Leicester, where he became Professor of Law, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (1976–1987), and Public Orator (1977–1979). In the late 1980s, he moved to the University of Nottingham as Professor of Law and later Emeritus Professor.\nHis teaching and research focused on theft, dishonesty, jury directions, recklessness, and defences.\nJudicial education\nGriew was a key adviser to the Judicial Studies Board, helping draft the Specimen Directions to the Jury (1984) and later editions of the Crown Court Bench Book. He advocated simplicity and neutrality in judicial summing-up, notably in Criminal Law Review (1989) 768.\nEditorial work\nGriew served on the Editorial Board of the Criminal Law Review and was Editor from 1964 to 1966. He remained on the Board until his death. The June 1997 issue described his influence as “great, and sorely missed.”\nPublications\nBooks\n* The English Legal System in a Nutshell (Sweet & Maxwell, 1957)\n* The Elements of Criminal Law (Sweet & Maxwell, 1962; 2nd ed 1964; 3rd ed 1967; 4th ed 1970)\n* The Theft Act 1968 (Sweet & Maxwell, 1970)\n* The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978 (Sweet & Maxwell, multiple editions 1978–1995)\n* The Criminal Law Act 1977: Commentary and Analysis (Sweet & Maxwell, 1977)\n* Dishonesty and the Jury: Inaugural Lecture (Leicester University Press, 1974)\nMajor journal articles\n* “Diminished Responsibility and the Trial of Lunatics Act 1883” [1957] Crim LR 521\n* “Imputations on the Character of the Prosecutor or the Witnesses for the Prosecution—A Restatement” [1961] Crim LR 142 and 213\n* “Compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence” [1962] Crim LR 801\n* “What the Butler Said He Saw” [1965] Crim LR 91\n* “The Behaviour of the Jury—A Review of the American Evidence” [1967] Crim LR 555\n* “The Order of Defence Evidence” [1969] Crim LR 347\n* “Directions to Convict” [1972] Crim LR 204\n* “Offences Against the Person: Non-Fatal Offences and Self-Defence” [1977] Crim LR 91\n* “Reckless Damage and Reckless Driving: Living with Caldwell and Lawrence” [1981] Crim LR 743\n* “Common Assault and the Statute Book” [1983] Crim LR 710\n* “Dishonesty—The Objections to Feely and Ghosh” [1985] Crim LR 341\n* “Stealing and Obtaining Bank Credits” [1986] Crim LR 356\n* “The Future of Diminished Responsibility” [1988] Crim LR 75\n* “Summing-Up the Law” [1989] Crim LR 768\n* “Case Comment: R v Holden” [1991] Crim LR 478\nIntellectual contribution\nGriew’s work combined breadth and depth of scholarship with clarity.
