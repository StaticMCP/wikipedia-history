The DCCS is a financial cooperative established by his uncle Elden Kingston in 1935.\nKingston studied at the University of Utah Law School and was admitted to the Utah State Bar in 1990.\nKingston succeeded his father John Ortell Kingston as the Trustee-in-Trust of the DCCS upon his father's death in 1987. During his tenure, some members have continued the practice of plural, and intra-family marriage, although neither is practiced by the majority of members and the practice is not required to gain status in the group.\nPlural marriage is practiced by some members of the DCCS, and members make their own choice in who they marry. Plural marriages for individuals under 18 in the group are not allowed. For more than a decade, the group has publicly spoken out against child-bride marriages and the DCCS has a policy encouraging its members to marry within the legal age of consent.  Members generally seek the blessing of parents and religious leaders before choosing to marry. Many consider Kingston the top man in the group.\nRecords show he signed as a witness on 4 lawful teenage marriages over a 20 year period. There are thousands of members in the group.\nHe is believed to have practiced polygamy in the past, potentially accruing as many as 40 wives and fathering up to 300 children.\nReferences\n-\n}}"
