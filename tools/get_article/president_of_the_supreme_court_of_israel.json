As a successor was not selected, Deputy President Yitzhak Amit served as acting President of the Supreme Court. He was selected by the Judicial Selection Committee as president of the Supreme Court in January 2025.\nSelection Process\nIn accordance with section 4(a) of the Basic Law: The Judiciary, the president of the Supreme Court is appointed by the president of Israel, according to the selection of the Judicial Selection Committee. Per law, the president of Israel does not have independent legal authority in this area, but rather he is obliged to follow the decision made by the committee. By convention, the selection is made in order of seniority, by which the longest-serving judge is designated when the outgoing president completes his or her term. Accordingly, judges appointed at a young age have a relatively higher likelihood of eventually serving as president. Several justice ministers, including Haim Ramon, Daniel Friedmann, Ayelet Shaked, and Yariv Levin have attempted to end the seniority discipline but the practice has remained unchanged.\nThe length of tenure as a judge in Israel is limited: section 13 of the Courts Law mandates that a judge's term concludes at the mandatory retirement age of 70. In an amendment to the courts law, approved in 2007, it was determined that the tenure of a Supreme Court president is seven years from the date of appointment, with no possibility of reappointment.\nAlso in the amendment to the Courts Law approved in July 2007, passed at the initiative of Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann, it was enacted that a Supreme Court president should not be appointed within three years of retirement age. However, in January 2012, the Knesset amended the law and annulled that limitation, at the initiative of MK Ya'akov Katz. The decision was known as the \"Grunis Law,\" as it made possible for the appointment of Asher Grunis to Supreme Court president soon after its passage.\nPowers\nThe Courts Law of 1984 designates the following unique powers to the President of the Supreme Court:\n# Various appointments of judges, such as appointment of a judge to preside in a higher position, are taken under the authority of the Justice Minister, but with the approval of the President of the Supreme Court. In some other cases it is also required for the minister to consult with the president of the court.\n# The President of the Supreme Court determines the size and composition of the Disciplinary Tribunal of Judges.\n# The Supreme Court typically hears cases as a panel of three judges, however, at the discretion of the President in specific cases the court may sit as a panel of a larger uneven number of Judges.\n# The judge or judges presiding over a specific matter brought to the court are determined by the President of the Supreme Court.\n# The President of the Supreme Court can disqualify a judge from ruling on a particular case, if the president believes there may exist a conflict of interest.\nOther powers were established in the Basic Law: The Judiciary:\n* The President of the Supreme Court serves as one of the members of Israel's Judicial Selection Committee.\n* The President of the Supreme Court and the Chair of the Judicial Selection Committee can initiate proceedings to remove a judge from the court.\n* The permanent transfer of a judge from one court to another requires the approval of the President of the Supreme Court or the Disciplinary Tribunal of Judges.\n* The activities of a judge in outside employment or in a public role are permitted only by law or with the approval of the President of the Supreme Court and the Justice Minister.\n* If a judge is the subject of a complaint before the Disciplinary Tribunal of Judges, or the under criminal investigation or a criminal charge, the President of the Supreme Court may suspend the judge for a length of time at his or her discretion.\nIn accordance with the Commissions of Inquiry Law of 1968, after the decision is made to form a State Commission of Inquiry, the President of the Supreme Court determines its composition.\nList of presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |No.\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Name\n! colspan=\"2\" |Dates of term\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Length of service\n|-\n!Start date\n!End date\n|-\n|1\n|Moshe Smoira\n(1948–1954)\n|14 September 1948\n|1 August 1954\n(Retired)\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Yitzhak Olshan\n(1954–1965)\n|1 August 1954\n|19 February 1965\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Shimon Agranat\n(1965–1976)\n|18 March 1965\n|5 September 1976\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Yoel Zussman\n(1976–1980)\n|8 September 1976\n|29 February 1980\n(Retired)\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Moshe Landau\n(1980–1982)\n|5 March 1980\n|29 April 1982\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Yitzhak Kahan\n(1982–1983)\n|30 April 1982\n|15 November 1983\n|\n|-\n|7\n|Meir Shamgar\n(1983–1995)\n|27 November 1983\n|13 August 1995\n|\n|-\n|8\n|Aharon Barak\n(1995–2006)\n|13 August 1995\n|16 September 2006\n|\n|-\n|9\n|Dorit Beinisch\n(2006–2012)\n|17 September 2006\n|28 February 2012\n|\n|-\n|10\n|Asher Grunis\n(2012–2015)\n|28 February 2012\n|17 January 2015\n|\n|-\n|11\n|Miriam Naor\n(2015–2017)\n|17 January 2015\n|26 October 2017\n|\n|-\n|12\n|Esther Hayut\n(2017–2023)\n|26 October 2017\n|15 October 2023\n|5 years, 355 days\n|-\n|13\n|Yitzhak Amit\n|26 January 2025\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nIn accordance with the seniority rule, the next Supreme Court presidents are expected to be:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!#\n!Judge\n!Start of Term\n!End of Term\n|-\n|14\n|Noam Sohlberg\n|20 October 2028\n|22 January 2032\n|-\n|15\n|Daphne Barak-Erez\n|22 January 2032\n|2 January 2035\n|-\n|16\n|Ofer Grosskopf\n|2 January 2035\n|12 October 2039\n|}\nDeputy president\nIn 1953, President of the Supreme Court Moshe Smoira fell ill, and Justice Minister Pinchas Rosen initiated the position of a permanent Acting President of the Supreme Court who could step in should Judge Smoira's condition prevent him from discharging his duties. Indeed, in December 1953, when Smoira ceased working, Yitzhak Olshan was appointed the first Acting President by the Selection Committee.\nIn 1984, at the initiative of Meir Shamgar, who had been appointed a judge a year earlier, the Judges Law was amended and the title \"Permanent Acting President of the Supreme Court\" was replaced by \"Deputy President of the Supreme Court.\" The first person to hold the new title was Miriam Ben-Porat.\nThe Deputy President of the Supreme Court is subject to similar restrictions to those that fall on the appointment of the President of the Supreme Court: the term ends at the mandatory retirement age of 70; and in accordance with Amendment 45 to the Courts Law in 2007, the length of term as Deputy President is seven years without possibility of reappointment.\nWhile the position of President of the Supreme Court is vacant and until the new president begins to serve, or if the President is out of the country, or if the President is temporarily incapacitated from fulfilling his or her duty, the Deputy President carries out the functions of the President.\nThe President of the Supreme Court is permitted to delegate his or her responsibilities to the Deputy President.\nList of Deputy Presidents and Acting Presidents of the Supreme Court\nswears in President of the Supreme Court Esther Hayut.
