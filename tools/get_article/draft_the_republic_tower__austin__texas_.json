Designed by Paine Architects and developed by Lincoln Property Company in partnership with Phoenix Property Company, the tower broke ground in January 2022 and is scheduled for completion in late 2025. Upon completion, it will rise 710 feet (216 m) with 48 stories, making it one of the tallest buildings in Austin and in Texas outside of Houston and Dallas.\nHistory and development\nThe Republic site at 401 West 4th Street had long been a surface parking lot before redevelopment. Austin civic leaders viewed the parcel as a prime candidate for a transformative downtown skyscraper due to its proximity to Republic Square Park, the Austin Central Library, and Shoal Creek.\nIn 2018, Lincoln Property Company and Phoenix Property Company unveiled plans for the tower. Their vision was to create a next-generation office tower blending Class-A workspace with public-oriented design. The project officially broke ground in January 2022 with DPR Construction serving as general contractor and Thornton Tomasetti as structural engineer.\nDesign and architecture\nThe Republic was designed by Duda|Paine Architects, noted for skyline-defining projects in major U.S. cities. The tower’s glass curtain wall is distinguished by a faceted crown, angled roofline, and stepped terraces that maximize views of Lady Bird Lake, the Texas State Capitol, and the Hill Country.\nA signature element is its 20,000-square-foot outdoor terrace, marketed as the \"Sky Garden,\" located mid-tower with landscaping, seating, and collaboration areas. The design integrates 10,000 square feet of retail at street level, activating the pedestrian corridor along Republic Square Park. Sustainability goals include LEED Gold certification, energy-efficient systems, and cyclist facilities.\nProject management and ownership\n* Developer: Lincoln Property Company (Austin office) and Phoenix Property Company\n* Project Management: Lincoln Property Company (Austin)\n* Architect: Duda|Paine Architects (lead), HKS (associate)\n* Structural Engineering: Thornton Tomasetti\n* Civil Engineering: WGI\n* Contractor: DPR Construction\n* Owner: Jointly owned by Lincoln Property Company and Phoenix Property Company\nFuture outlook\nScheduled to complete in late 2025, The Republic will add 833,000 square feet of Class A office space to downtown Austin. The building is expected to attract technology and financial tenants, corporate relocations, and Fortune 500 firms. Its location and design have positioned it as a potential hub in Austin’s rapidly growing office market.\nRope swing incident\nIn April 2025, The Republic drew attention when an individual illegally climbed a construction crane attached to the tower and performed rope swings from the crane’s jib. The stunt, filmed and shared online, was condemned by developers and city officials due to safety risks. The man left before authorities arrived, and no injuries were reported.\nComparative chart: Austin’s tallest towers\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Rank !! Tower !! Height !! Floors !!
