It took place on 21 September 1706 and formed part of the War of the Spanish Succession.  It took part in the El Albujón district of the Spanish town of Cartagena and ended in a Bourbon victory. With the victory at the battle of Murcia, it led to the reconquest of Cartagena and evidenced the failure of the Austrian campaign in the kingdom of Murcia, a region of Castile.\nBibliography\n*Albareda Salvadó, Joaquim (2010).
