His main spell as a professional was at Aberdeen where he featured regularly, though not always a first choice, between 1931 and 1939 when he moved on to Dundee; however, the outbreak of World War II meant he never made an official competitive appearance for the Dens Park club.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! colspan=\"3\" |League\n! colspan=\"2\" |Scottish Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |Aberdeen\n|1930–31\n| rowspan=\"9\" |Scottish Division One\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|1931–32\n|14\n|2\n|1\n|0\n|15\n|2\n|-\n|1932–33\n|12\n|2\n|1\n|0\n|13\n|2\n|-\n|1933–34\n|30\n|6\n|4\n|0\n|34\n|6\n|-\n|1934–35\n|20\n|3\n|2\n|0\n|22\n|3\n|-\n|1935–36\n|18\n|9\n|3\n|0\n|21\n|9\n|-\n|1936–37\n|8\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|8\n|3\n|-\n|1937–38\n|13\n|8\n|0\n|0\n|13\n|8\n|-\n|1938–39\n|18\n|6\n|6\n|1\n|24\n|7\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!133\n!39\n!17\n!1\n!150\n!40\n|-\n|Dundee\n|1939–40\n|Scottish Division Two\n|4*\n|2*\n| –\n| –\n|4*\n|2*\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career total\n!137\n!41\n!17\n!1\n!154\n!42\n|}\nGames played before league season was suspended\nReferences"
