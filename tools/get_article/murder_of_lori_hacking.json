She was reported missing by her husband, and the search gained national attention before her husband confessed to the crime.\nBiography\nLori was the adopted daughter of Thelma and Eraldo Soares, formerly of Fullerton, California. Eraldo Soares was a Spanish and Portuguese teacher at Sunny Hills High School and was a native of Piracicaba, Brazil. He met Thelma when they both served as missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Rio de Janeiro. Lori's parents divorced in 1987, and Thelma and Lori moved to Orem, Utah the following year. Lori and Mark both attended Orem High School, about 40 miles (about 64 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City.\nDisappearance\nAt 10:49 a.m. on July 19, 2004, Mark Hacking called 911 to report his wife Lori missing. She was 27 years old at the time. Mark told police she had left home early for a customary jog in the Memory Grove and City Creek Canyon area northeast of downtown Salt Lake City, but had not returned home or arrived at work. A woman said she had seen Lori near the grove that day, but later withdrew her claim.\nAccording to family members, Hacking was about five weeks pregnant when she vanished. She was planning a move to North Carolina, where her husband had said he was about to start medical school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, police say Mark had lied to friends and family about his academic accomplishments and had never actually completed an undergraduate degree at the University of Utah. The medical school had no record of his having applied.\nShortly after his wife's disappearance, Mark was found running naked through the streets, and was admitted to hospital for mental evaluation. While in the hospital, Mark engaged D. Gilbert Athay, a prominent defense attorney in the community.\nMark Hacking arrested\nOn August 2, 2004, Mark was arrested on suspicion of the aggravated murder of his wife. Police said they believed that he acted alone, killing Lori in their apartment with a .22-caliber rifle while she was asleep and disposing of her body in a dumpster.\nInvestigators found blood in several places in the couple's apartment, including on a knife found in the bedroom, on the headboard of the bed, and in Lori's car.\nIn addition, Scott and Lance Hacking, Mark's brothers, claimed that Mark confessed to murdering his wife after they confronted him on July 24, 2004. First-degree murder charges were filed against Mark Hacking on August 9, 2004.\nOn October 1, 2004 at approximately 8:20 a.m. searchers found human remains in the Salt Lake County landfill. By that afternoon, police had confirmed that the remains were those of Lori Hacking. Searchers found the carpet that Mark admitted to rolling her body into before placing it in the dumpster.\nOn October 29, 2004, Mark pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder despite pleas from Paul Soares, the victim's brother, to \"save your family the grief and cost [and] plead guilty to murder.\"\nAccording to investigators, on the night of July 18, Lori wrote Mark a note telling him that she planned to leave him after discovering that virtually everything Mark had told her about his background was false. She had learned that he never graduated from the University of Utah and never applied to medical school. Rather than divorce, Hacking killed her.\nGuilty plea\n| birth_place = United States\n| death_date =\n| death_place =\n| alias =\n| charge = First-degree murder\n| conviction = April 15, 2005 (pleaded guilty)\n| conviction_penalty = Life with 30 years minimum\n| conviction_status = Utah Department of Corrections number 167809, incarcerated at Central Utah Correctional Facility in Gunnison, Utah; earliest possible release 2035\n| occupation =\n| spouse = Lori Soares (1999-2004, her death)\n| parents =\n| children =\n}}\nOn April 15, 2005, Hacking pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for prosecutors dropping other charges. On June 6, 2005, Hacking was sentenced to six years to life in prison, the maximum possible sentence under Utah law at the time. In Utah, prison sentences are indeterminate, with a minimum and maximum time frame. The offender must serve the entire sentence unless the Utah Board of Pardons releases him sooner. Normally, those convicted of first-degree murder were required to serve a minimum of five years before they can be considered for parole. However, because Hacking killed Lori with a firearm, the minimum was increased by one year.\nIn July 2005, the Utah Board of Pardons declared that Mark Hacking would not be considered for parole until at least 2035, meaning that Hacking will have to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison. Board chairman Mike Sibbett stressed that a hearing was not a guarantee of a release date. He stated that there were a number of aggravating factors in Hacking's case that merited a later date. He stressed that Hacking obstructed justice by disposing of Lori's body and falsely claiming she was missing. Upon hearing this news, Lori's mother Thelma Soares issued this statement: \"While it is a terrible waste of his life, [the decision] lifts a great burden from my mind and heart. The six-year minimum imposed by law is an insult not only to Lori and the baby, but to me and my family as well. I thank the members of the State Board of Pardons and Parole for their diligence and sense of justice in dealing with this tragic case. My faith in our justice system has been upheld.\"\nAfterward\nThe Soares family removed the name Hacking from Lori's headstone. \"We just felt that Mark obviously didn't want her anymore\", said her mother. Lori's married name was replaced with the Portuguese word , which translates to \"little daughter.\"\nThe initial sentence caused a widespread public outcry, with many expressing alarm at the possibility Hacking could be released after six years. Sibbett noted that most inmates convicted of murder have to wait between 18 and 35 years for a parole hearing, and Hacking's actions pushed it to \"the higher level\" of the spectrum. According to the Deseret News, the great majority of inmates convicted of murder serve far more than the five-year minimum, and it is unheard of for a convicted murderer to serve less than 15 years. Several are denied parole and forced to wait 22 years for another hearing, while others receive parole dates that require them to serve an average of 20 more years before being released. A few have been ordered to spend the rest of their lives in prison. Nonetheless, Paul Boyden, the executive director of the Utah Statewide Association of Prosecutors, urged the Utah Sentencing Commission to raise the minimum sentence for first-degree murder to 15 years. Boyden said most people didn't understand Utah's indeterminate sentencing scheme and added that it caused \"a public perception problem\" for the state. State sentencing commission member Sy Snarr agreed, saying that it was \"appalling\" that Hacking even theoretically had a minimum six-year sentence. On March 20, 2006, Utah House Bill 102, also known as \"Lori's Law\", was signed into law. It stipulates that people convicted of first-degree murder in Utah must serve at least 15 years before they can be considered for parole.\nOn June 6, 2005, Mark Hacking's father read a statement from his family that he said would be their final statement to the press about the murder. The statement clarified several events leading to Mark's confession and conviction. The statement ended by quoting Mark:\n\"I know prison is where I need to be. I will spend my time there doing all I can to right the many wrongs I have done, though I realize complete atonement is impossible in this life. I have a lot of healing and changing to do, but I hope that some day I can become the man Lori always thought I was. To the many people I have hurt, I am more sorry than you could ever know. Every day my soul burns in torment when I think of what you must be going through. I wish I could take away your pain. I wish I could take back all the lies I have told and replace them with the truth. I wish I could put Lori back into your arms. My pain is deserved; yours is not. From the bottom of my heart, I beg for your forgiveness. There is no such thing as a harmless lie no matter how small it is. You may think a lie only hurts the liar, but this is far from the truth. If you are traveling a path of lies, please stop now and face the consequences. Whatever those consequences, they will be better than the pain you are causing yourself and others.\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080408120337/http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,600139562,00.html Deseret Morning News | Hacking family statement]\nIn June 2006, prison officials in Utah discovered that Hacking was selling personal items, including autographs, a hand tracing, various prison forms, and magazines, on an online site called Murder Auction.
