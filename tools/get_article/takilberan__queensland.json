It meanders south through Gaeta and Wonbah Forest before entering the locality of Takilberan from the south-west and then flows north, exiting the locality to the north near the Bruce Highway. It ultimately flows into Lake Monduran.\nThe land use is almost entirely grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe locality presumably takes its name from the Mount Takilberan, which is derived from the Koreng Goreng language, meaning a hanging rock or stone.\nTakilberan Rock Provisional School  opened on 17 September 1917 and closed on 20 September 1922.\nDemographics\nIn the , Takilberan had a population of 21 people.\nIn the , Takilberan had a population of 47 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Takilberan.
