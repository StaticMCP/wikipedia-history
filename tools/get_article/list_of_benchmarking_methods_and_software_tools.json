With evaluation it means the level of achieving the target for a particular evaluation item. There are general \"methods\", approaches as well as IT-supported \"software tools\" that respectively enable an effective and efficient work.\nThe following is a list of notable methods and benchmarking software tools.\nBenchmarking methods\nThere are many benchmarking methods each having different analytical focus. The methods are mostly known and will be shown in the following summary.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Methods\n!
