The formations were the first landmark in Kansas chosen by the U.S. Department of the Interior as a National Natural Landmark. The chalk formations reach a height of up to  and include formations such as buttes and arches. The carbonate deposits were laid down during the Cretaceous Period in what was then the Western Interior Seaway, which split the continent of North America into two landmasses. They are estimated to have been formed 80 million years ago.\nHistory\nOn January 29, 2008, Monument Rocks, 25 miles south of Oakley, Kansas, and Castle Rock, 31 miles to the east, were jointly named as one of the 8 Wonders of Kansas.\nGallery\nFile:A328, Monument Rocks National Natural Landmark, Gove County, Kansas, 2011.JPG|Wide view of largest formation and arch\nFile:MonumentRock.JPG|Southernmost rock in the early 1890s\nFile:Monument rocks view.jpg|Wide view from the west\nFile:MonumentRock car.jpg|With car for scale\nFile:Milky Way over Monument Rocks, Kansas, USA.jpg|alt=Milky Way over Monument Rocks, Kansas, USA|Night view with Milky Way\nSee also\nOther geological formations in Kansas:\n*Castle Rock (Kansas)\n*Little Jerusalem Badlands State Park\n*Mushroom Rock State Park\n*Rock City, Kansas\n*Big Basin Prairie Preserve\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kansastravel.org/monumentrocks.htm Monument Rocks (Chalk Pyramids)]\n*[http://www.washburn.edu/cas/art/cyoho/archive/KStravel/bigrocks/pyramids.html Monument Rocks/Rock Pyramids]\n*[http://www.naturalkansas.org/monument.htm Monument Rocks]\n*[http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/county-pdf/gove.PDF Gove County Map], KDOT"
