It gained its name from a breed of cow that was supposedly farmed there.  It has been swallowed up by the urban growth of Aylesbury, but a pub of the same name remains.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=481815&y=214740&z=3&sv=481815,214740&st=4&ar=Y&mapp=newmap.srf&searchp=newsearch.srf Map at streetmap.co.uk, with the arrow pointing to the location of New Zealand]"
