He married Dorothy Irene Deakin at the United Reformed Church in Belmont, Lancashire in 1941, and they lived in Egerton, near Bolton.\nDetails\nSandys-Clarke was a 23-year-old lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), British Army during the Second World War when he was awarded the VC.\nOn 23 April 1943 at Guiriat El Atach, Tunisia, Lieutenant Clarke's company was counter-attacked and almost wiped out, he being the sole remaining officer. Although wounded in the head, he gathered a composite platoon together and advancing to attack the position again met heavy fire from a machine-gun post. He manoeuvred his men to give covering fire and then tackled the post single-handed, killing or capturing the crew and knocking out the gun. He dealt similarly with two other posts and then led his platoon to the objective, but was killed when he later went forward to tackle two sniper posts single-handed.\nFurther information\nSandys-Clarke was related to four other recipients of the award:\n* Gen. Walter Congreve (Colenso)\n* Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts (Khudaganj)\n* Lt. Frederick Roberts (Colenso)\n* Maj. William Congreve (Somme)\nThe medal was retained by his family and was not on public display. However, on 6th July 2025, the Daily Telegraph reported that the medal had been put up for auction at Spink & Son with an estimate of £300,000 to £500,000.\nhttps://spink.com/lot/25002000167\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2197007 Commonwealth War Graves Commission for Willward Alexander Sandys-Clarke]\n*"
