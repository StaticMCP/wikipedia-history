His father was commissioned to work with the Church Army. Edwards was educated at James Ruse Agricultural High School and the University of Technology Sydney, then worked as an executive in the finance and banking sector for a time, before training for the ministry at Moore Theological College. In 1994 Edwards was ordained and became a curate at St George's, Engadine.\nEdwards was appointed to the staff of Holy Trinity Church, Adelaide, and later founded its church plant in the Adelaide Hills, during which time its congregation grew more than tenfold under his leadership. He then accepted a rector's position at St Paul's Tervuren in Belgium (in the Diocese in Europe). and chaired the associated primary school. His most recent position prior to his ordination as bishop was as Director of Mission at Anglican Retirement Villages (now Anglicare), Sydney.\nEpiscopal ministry\nOn 11 November 2013, Edwards was appointed by Archbishop Glenn Davies and endorsed by the diocese's Standing Committee as the next Bishop of North Sydney (Bishop of the Northern Region). Edwards was to succeed Davies in that position, following his appointment as archbishop earlier that year. The diocese spoke of Edwards' leadership in parishes in Sydney, Adelaide and Belgium, the Arrow Leadership program in South Australia, African Enterprise in Belgium, a British Primary School in Belgium, a mission society (RETRAK) in Belgium, and Anglican Retirement Villages as some of the reasons for his appointment.\nEdwards was consecrated bishop by Davies in St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney on 29 March 2014, and commenced working in the position from 5 May 2014.\nAs Bishop of North Sydney, Edwards oversees 64 parishes north of Sydney Harbour, including some of the diocese's largest churches and multicultural ministries.\nEdwards was one of four nominees to replace Glenn Davies as Anglican Archbishop of Sydney at a special election Synod in May 2021. He was eliminated in the first round of voting.\nPersonal life\nEdwards is married to Belinda and has 2 children.\nReferences"
