Polish forces consisted of the 1st Cavalry Division commanded by Juliusz Rómmel, while Russian consisted of the 45th Rifle Division commanded by Iona Yakir and the 14th Cavalry Division commanded by Alexander Parkhomenko. The battle was fought in the area around the village of Chołojów (currently Vuzlove, Ukraine).\nThe goal of Polish forces was to stall the Russian forces and give infantry time to prepare for the defense on the Bug river. Eventually, the 1st Cavalry Division had retreated and the area had fallen into Russian control.\nBibliography\n*  Samhorodek – Komarów 1920.
