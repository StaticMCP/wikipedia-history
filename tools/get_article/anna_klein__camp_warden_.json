She was tried for her role in the Holocaust, but acquitted due to lack of evidence.\nAtrocities in Nazi concentration camps\nOn 14 September 1939, she arrived in Ravensbrück. In August 1943, she was promoted to the highest rank of Chef Oberaufseherin (Chief senior supervisor), with control and the responsibility of monitoring all of Ravensbrück camp, including slave labor, medical experiments, and death of inmates, the majority of whom were female political prisoners.\nKlein reached the highest rank that the Nazis allowed a woman in a camp; she received a higher salary, better housing, better food (which was not cooked by detainees, but by other Schutzstaffel (SS) women), the best clothes, more power, and this hierarchical title of honour. She oversaw all guards at Ravensbrück until the SS assigned her to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in September 1944. There, she served as a supervisor, with the same rank until the liberation of the camp by the Allies in April 1945.\nTrial and acquittal\nFor the period of August 1943 to August 1944, in Ravensbrück, Klein was charged with mistreatment of inmates and participation in the selection of inmates for the gas chamber in the seventh Ravensbrück Trial in Hamburg. This trial lasted from 2 July to 21 July 1948. She was acquitted on 21 July 1948 due to lack of evidence.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
