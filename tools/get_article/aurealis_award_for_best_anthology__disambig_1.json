To qualify, a work must have been first published by an Australian citizen or permanent resident between 1 January and 31 December of the corresponding year; the presentation ceremony is held the following year. It has grown from a small function of around 20 people to a two-day event attended by over 200 people.\nSince their creation in 1995, awards have been given in various categories of speculative fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's fiction told primarily through words, children's fiction told primarily through pictures, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have attracted the attention of publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has identified the award as an honour to be taken seriously.\nThe results are decided by a panel of judges from a list of submitted nominees; the long-list of nominees is reduced to a short-list of finalists. The judges are selected from a public application process by the Award's management team.\nThis article lists all the short-list nominees and winners in the best anthology category. The award for best anthology was first awarded in 2008 along with two other categories: best collection and best illustrated book or graphic novel. These replaced the discontinued Golden Aurealis Awards. Jonathan Strahan has since won the award seven times (7), while Alisa Krasnostein and Julia Rios have won it twice (2). Strahan holds the record for most nominations, having received 24 nominations. This is as of the 2021 awards, in which the winners were announced in late May 2022.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of the book's eligibility; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\" article. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list.\nWinners and joint winners\nNominees on the shortlist\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"95%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"8%\"|Year\n! width=\"22.5%\"|Editor(s)\n! width=\"46.5%\"|Anthology\n! width=\"18%\"|Publisher\n! width=\"5%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Viking Children’s Books ||\n|-\n|  & Michelle Marquardt || ''Year's Best Australian Science Fiction and Fantasy, Fourth Annual Volume || MirrorDanse Books ||\n|-\n|  || Dreaming Again || HarperVoyager ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || Eclipse 3 || Night Shade Books ||\n|-\n|  & Jonathan Strahan ||  || Harper Eos ||\n|-\n|  & Tehani Wessely || New Ceres Nights || Twelfth Planet Press ||\n|-\n|  || X6 || Coeur de Lion Publishing ||\n|-\n|  || Eclipse 2 || Night Shade Books ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * & Marianne S.
