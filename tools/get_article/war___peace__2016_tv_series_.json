It is a six-part adaptation of the 1869 novel War and Peace by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, written by Andrew Davies and directed by Tom Harper. War & Peace aired on A&E, Lifetime and History Channel in the United States as four two-hour episodes, beginning on 18 January 2016. The serial stars Paul Dano, Lily James and James Norton in the leading roles.\nPlot\nThe saga begins in the Russian Empire in 1805. When Pierre, Natasha and Andrei are first introduced to viewers, their youthful ambition, despite their privileged circumstances, is to find meaning in their lives. Kind-hearted but awkward Pierre, the illegitimate son of Russia's richest man, wants to change the world for the better. The spirited Natasha is searching for true love, while handsome and gallant Andrei, frustrated with the superficiality of society, seeks a higher purpose.\nAt the same time, the French army under Napoleon edges ever closer to Russia's borders. Natasha's older brother Nikolai joins the Imperial Russian Army immediately and matures during the war against Napoleon. Like Pierre, Natasha and Andrei, he also experiences romantic vicissitudes: despite his childhood love for his cousin Sonya, his impoverished parents insist he marry a rich bride like the superficial Julie Karagina or the religious Marya Bolkonskaya.\nHaving begun with Napoleon's military campaign against Russia and Austria in 1805, the story concludes in 1812 after Napoleon's invasion of Russia has failed and he has retreated and withdrawn from Russian territory. The families at the centre of the saga have undergone major changes and lost members, but those remaining have experienced a transformation and a new life, with new growth and new families started.\nCast\nPrincipal\nSupporting\nEpisodes\n|country=UK\n|episodes=\n|Viewers         = 9.33\n|ShortSummary    = The series opens in Russia in 1805. Napoleon Bonaparte's French army has invaded Austria and now threatens Russia. Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count, is a kindhearted but awkward recent university graduate whose outspoken political views, supportive of the French emperor, are less than fully welcomed by polite society. His social status changes however when he unexpectedly inherits his father's vast wealth and numerous estates. Andrei Bolkonsky, Pierre's close friend and the heir to one of Russia's noblest families, seeks glory and advancement in the Tsar's army opposing Napoleon. Natasha Rostova, from a minor noble's family, is a joyous and yet thoughtful girl, still seeking her future place in society.\n|LineColor       = 610B21\n}}\n|Viewers         = 7.72\n|ShortSummary    = Pierre marries the beautiful and seductive Hélène via her father's machinations, but he soon realises that she is an unloving and mercenary wife. She cuckolds him with his erstwhile friend Dolokhov, whom Pierre then challenges to a duel. Hélène's father also tries, unsuccessfully, to engineer a union between his son Anatole and Andrei's religious sister Marya. The Russian army holds off the French for a while, and Natasha's brother Nikolai returns from the army to his family. The Battle of Austerlitz leaves Andrei badly wounded; he is however finally able to get home in time to see his wife Lise give birth to a son, but she dies in childbirth.\n|LineColor       = 610B21\n}}\n|Viewers         = 7.33\n|ShortSummary    = Although nervous, Pierre defeats Dolokhov in the duel and afterwards separates from Hélène, who demands a fortune from him and begins affairs with other men, including the opportunistic Boris Drubetskoi. A Freemason persuades Pierre to resolve his troubles by joining Freemasonry and by devoting himself to helping others. Pierre's efforts to improve the welfare of his serfs are, however, largely ineffectual. When Nikolai returns home on leave, his army friend Denisov accompanies him and soon proposes to Natasha, who awkwardly declines. Dolokhov stays briefly with the Rostovs and proposes to Natasha's cousin Sonya, who turns him down, confessing her love for Nikolai. Afterwards, in a lengthy card game, Dolokhov wins a huge sum of money from Nikolai, which plunges the Rostov family into enormous debt. Napoleon signs a peace treaty with Russia in 1807. The story moves to the spring of 1809: Andrei has quit the army and has been living a reclusive life out of remorse for neglecting his late wife, but when he meets Natasha while visiting the Rostovs, she and Andrei are mutually smitten.\n|LineColor       = 610B21\n}}\n|Viewers         = 7.40\n|ShortSummary    = Andrei's curmudgeonly father forces him to travel abroad for a year to gain approval for marrying Natasha, which she reluctantly accepts. Despite his financially strapped parents' insistence, Nikolai refuses to marry the wealthy but superficial heiress Julie Karagina, maintaining instead his lifelong love for his cousin Sonya.  After failing in his attempt to court Andrei's sister Marya for her fortune, Boris successfully woos Julie with the mournful poetry she likes. After a very awkward meeting with Andrei's father and sister, Natasha feels strongly that they do not like her. Heartbroken and tired of waiting for nearly a year, she is vulnerable when Hélène introduces her to her scoundrel brother Anatole, who tries to secretly  elope with her, thus ruining her reputation. Pierre chases Anatole out of Moscow and informs Natasha that Anatole already has a wife in Poland. Natasha is devastated.\n|LineColor       = 610B21\n}}\n|Viewers         = 7.25\n|ShortSummary    = 1812: France again breaks the peace with Russia and invades, striking towards Moscow. Andrei, back from his travels abroad, returns all of Natasha's letters and mementos and is unwilling to forgive or speak of her, in spite of Pierre's attempts to soften his heart. Meanwhile, Pierre forces himself to avoid Natasha because he is secretly in love with her but is a married man. After Andrei returns to the army to help defend Russia from the invasion, his erratic father is increasingly difficult for Marya to cope with, and as the French threaten their estate the household is eventually forced to flee after the old prince has a fatal series of strokes. Without her father, Marya is unable to control her rebellious serfs in order to escape the French, but Nikolai Rostov, leading an army detachment, rescues her when he passes through the area; this chance meeting and rescue sparks romance for both of them. Pierre and Andrei meet again prior to the crucial Battle of Borodino. Pierre experiences the gruesome Battle of Borodino as an on-site observer and helper, and gets a true taste of the horrors of war and the courage of soldiers facing death. Andrei fights on the front line and is mortally wounded; at the infirmary he meets the likewise mortally wounded Anatole, whom he had pledged to kill out of revenge, and forgives him instead.\n|LineColor       = 610B21\n}}\n|Viewers         = 7.39\n|ShortSummary    = As the French advance into Moscow, Natasha and her family flee their home for the countryside. They take wounded soldiers with them, and eventually Natasha discovers that Andrei is among them. Natasha begs Andrei for forgiveness and he confesses that he still loves her. Andrei dies, with Natasha, his sister Marya and his son by his side. Back in Moscow, which is being burned and looted, Pierre is carrying a concealed weapon and is captured by the French, almost shot, and then imprisoned instead. He is befriended by Platon Karataev, a peasant who has a profound effect on his outlook on the deepest of levels—teaching him about gratitude, simple happiness, and giving and receiving love. Hélène, by now pregnant, is unable to reach Pierre to gain consent for an annulment and she seeks an abortion after being snubbed at a society party. An abortionist gives her a bottle of liquid of which she is to take only a few drops, but she swallows the lot, and dies alone of haemorrhage during the induced labour. Napoleon, with no supplies left for him in Moscow or anywhere else, orders all of his troops to retreat and leave Russia—thus a Russian victory is secured. After the terrible hardship of a lengthy imprisonment and march through the Russian winter with the French retreating from Moscow,  Pierre is rescued by a guerilla group of Russian soldiers led by Dolokhov and Denisov. The Rostovs' younger son, Petya, is killed in the skirmish, and after hearing this his father, already in shock from the loss of all his property and the burning of Moscow, dies of a broken heart. Sonya releases Nikolai from their engagement, and he instead becomes engaged to, and later marries, Marya. Pierre finally proposes to, and marries, Natasha and starts a family, and their extended family includes the Rostovs, Sonya, and Andrei's son.\n|LineColor       = 610B21\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nThe series, a British-American co-production, was announced by Danny Cohen on 18 February 2013 and was commissioned by him and Ben Stephenson, the controller of BBC Drama.
