The school is also recognised for its annual musical production, which was once held at the Shedley Theatre in Elizabeth, but is now held in the King's community chapel.\nHistory\nConstruction of the Wynn Vale site began in November 1988, as part of the Golden Grove development. On 7 February 1989, King's opened on its Wynn Vale Campus with 300 students. The oval and library are shared with the government Keithcot Farm Primary School.\nThe school's most recent addition was a new science and performing arts building (completed at the end of 2004) including four specialist laboratories, four instrumental teaching rooms, a keyboard lab, and amphitheatre, as well as an extension to the Design and Technology building, dedicated to CAD.\nIn 2013, 950 students were enrolled at the school.\nFacilities\nThe school's arts program is a popular extra-curricular activity amongst students. The school competed in the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge until 2003, after which it began producing and performing its own musical productions.\nIn 2011, the school completed construction on a new gymnasium. This facility contains two basketball courts, two classrooms, a weights room, change rooms and plenty of storage space. In the same year, the school also completed construction on a library upgrade, pulling the once outdated building into a 21st-century building. The new library contains ample space for students to read and work, as well as computers, tablets and laptops.\nNotable alumni\n* Daniel Menzel: Australian rules footballer with the Geelong Football Club\n* Troy Menzel: Australian rules footballer with the Adelaide Football Club\n* Guy Sebastian: Australian Idol winner\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
