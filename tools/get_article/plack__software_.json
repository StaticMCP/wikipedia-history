Plack allows for testing of Perl web applications without a live web server.\nPlackup is a command line utility to run PSGI applications from the command line.\nPSGI\nPSGI or Perl Web Server Gateway Interface is an interface between web servers and web applications and frameworks written in the Perl programming language that allows writing portable applications that can be run as standalone servers or using CGI, FastCGI, mod_perl, et al. It is inspired by the Web Server Gateway Interface for Python, Rack for Ruby and JSGI for JavaScript. A PSGI application is a Perl subroutine that accepts arguments as a single hash reference and returns a reference to an array of three elements: an HTTP status code, a reference to an array of HTTP headers and a reference to an array of HTTP body lines (usually a generated HTML document) or a filehandle-like object.\nSupported backends\nPlack supports the following server backends:\n* CGI\n* SCGI\n* FastCGI\n* mod_perl under Apache 1.3 and 2.0\n* Standalone HTTP server included in Plack\n* HTTP::Server::Simple\n* Corona\n* Starman\n* Twiggy\n* AnyEvent::HTTPD\n* AnyEvent::ReverseHTTP\nExamples\nUsing the default standalone HTTP server:\n$ plackup app.psgi\nHTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/\nRunning as a FastCGI daemon listening on a Unix socket, ready to be used by any Web server with FastCGI support:\n$ plackup -s FCGI -listen /tmp/fcgi.sock app.psgi\nFastCGI: manager (pid 3336): initialized\nFastCGI: manager (pid 3336): server (pid 3337) started\nFastCGI: server (pid 3337): initialized\nA working Hello world application run as a one-liner:\n$ plackup -e 'sub { [200, [\"Content-Type\" => \"text/plain\"], [\"Hello, world!\"]] }'\nHTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/\nThe command above starts an HTTP server listening on port 5000 of every local interface (IP address) and returns this 200 OK response to every HTTP request:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 19 Mar 2010 23:34:10 GMT\nServer: HTTP::Server::PSGI\nContent-Type: text/plain\nContent-Length: 13\nHello, world!\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://plackperl.org/ PSGI and Plack website]\n* [https://metacpan.org/module/Plack Plack documentation]\n* [https://metacpan.org/module/plackup plackup manual]"
