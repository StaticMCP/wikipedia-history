It is presented to employees of State, USAID and Marine guards assigned to diplomatic and consular facilities in recognition of acts of courage or outstanding performance under unusually difficult or dangerous circumstances, whether or not in connection with the performance of assigned duties.\nThe award consists of a silver medal set and a certificate signed by an assistant secretary, an official of equivalent rank or the Chief of Mission.  Due to the location and dangerous nature of their work, the majority of the recipients have been Foreign Service Special Agents of the Diplomatic Security Service.\nThe Award for Heroism is a replacement for the former Award for Valor.  The basic difference between the two medals is that the Valor Award was issued in 10K gold whereas the Heroism Award is issued in sterling silver.  The ribbon reflects this; the designs are almost identical, but the color scheme indicates the precious metal issued with the respective awards.\nCriteria\nThe following criteria are applicable to granting an Award for Heroism:\n* Sustained superior performance while under threat of physical attack or harassment; or\n* An individual act of courage or exceptional performance at the risk of personal safety.\nNominating and approval procedures\nNominations for State and USAID employees are submitted on Form JF-66, Nomination for Award, through supervisory channels to the Joint Country Awards Committee for review and recommendation to the Chief of Mission for final action.\nNominations initiated in Washington are submitted to the appropriate area awards committee for final action. For USAID, nominations initiated in Washington are reviewed by the USAID bureau/office with final approval by the appropriate assistant administrator or office head.\nMilitary use\nUpon authorization, members of the U.S. military may wear the medal and ribbon in the appropriate order of precedence as a U.S. non-military personal decoration.\nRecipients\n• Diplomatic Security Contractors who responded to a coordinated attack on Camp Sullivan in December 2016, protected a 150 foot gap in the perimeter of the US Embassy Support Center and rescued American's trapped in one of many collapsed buildings.\n* [https://www.voanews.com/a/a-year-after-us-exit-from-afghanistan-some-frustrated-at-lack-of-lessons-learned/6698140.html A team of Consular Officers] who were on the ground at Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA) in Kabul to assist with the largest NEO airlift in US history, relocating 124,000 people from Kabul in August 2021, including American citizens, legal permanent residents and tens of thousands of Afghan allies.
