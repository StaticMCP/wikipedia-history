According to frontman Steve Austin, the intent of the album was to simply be \"honest and raw\". In an interview with NPR, Austin described their mindset during the writing process of the album as \"make up an idea, keep it, make the next idea and then connect it all together.\"\nLyrically, the album was inspired by the 2008 financial crisis which, according to Austin in a video interview, nearly caused him and his family to go into poverty. The track \"Remember to Forget\" was written about Austin's mother, who at the time was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The album's title was inspired from a conversation Austin had with his son.\nTrack listing\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0 1em 1em 0;\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Publication\n!Country\n!Accolade\n!Rank\n!class=unsortable|\n|-\n|align=center|2011    ||Terrorizer    ||United Kingdom\n| \"Albums of the Year\"    ||align=center|11    ||\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| colspan=\"6\"  style=\"font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"|\"*\" denotes an unordered list.\n|}\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the Pain Is a Warning liner notes.\nToday Is the Day\n*Steve Austin&nbsp;– vocals, guitar, production\n*Ryan Jones&nbsp;– bass guitar, backing vocals\n*Curran Reynolds&nbsp;– drums\nProduction and additional personnel\n*Kevin Baker&nbsp;– backing vocals\n*Kurt Ballou&nbsp;– mixing, recording; guitar on \"This Is You\"\n*Alan Douches&nbsp;– mastering\n*Nate Newton&nbsp;– backing vocals\n*Mike Wohlberg&nbsp;– design\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
