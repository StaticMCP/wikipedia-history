The ensemble was established by Gordon and Sharon Lehany in 2018, and specialises in 17th-century music and performance practices using period instruments and techniques to recreate the sound and spirit of early Baroque music. Their aim is to present early music in ways that follow the performance practices of the era in which it was composed, and make this music engaging for audiences. The group is a live performance ensemble and emphasises the social experience between the performers and their audience. Gordon Lehany is the artistic and musical director, and Sharon Lehany is the manager and producer.\nThe name chosen for the ensemble makes a link with the resurgence of colour and creativity following the 17th-century restoration of the English monarchy.  The Queen's Closet is the name of a room in the 17th-century Ham House, near London. This room was redecorated during the restoration period, and illustrates the exuberance of the period.\nThe group uses reproductions of original instruments from the restoration period, and aims for performance practices that are representative of the era. Instruments include the natural trumpet, and the hoboy – a double reed woodwind instrument that is a predecessor of the modern oboe. The performances are supported by scholarship including the study of surviving instruments, and locating and interpreting sources from 300 to 400 years ago.\nTheir first concert, titled Restoration, was held in Wellington's City Gallery on 1 June 2019. A further concert, titled All The Pleasures, was held in Prefab Hall on 3 November 2019. The ensemble has also performed at Old Saint Paul's, St Andrew's on The Terrace, St Peter's on Willis Street, the Hannah Playhouse, the Public Trust Hall, at the CupaDupa festival, and as part of the Classical on Cuba events programme.\nIn November 2022, The Queen's Closet performed Cloverton: In Love & In Wine, a work that blended the music of Henry Purcell with a contemporary story written by Dave Armstrong especially for the performance. The work follows a tradition from the Restoration period of mixing spoken drama with operatic music.\nIn May 2024, Orchestra Wellington opened their 2024 season with a programme including The Queen's Closet performing works by Giovanni Pergolesi.\nThe Queen's Closet is supported by a charitable trust named QCT – a registered charity in New Zealand.\nRecognition and awards\nThe Queen's Closet received two nominations at the Fringe Festival Awards 2020, for Most Promising Emerging Company and Outstanding Ensemble Performance for their show, Quanto Dolce: Musick for the Passions. The ensemble received a further nomination at the 2022 Fringe Awards, for Outstanding Ensemble, for their performance of their own new edition of The Judgment of Paris.\nList of performances\nAll venues are in Wellington, unless stated otherwise.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
