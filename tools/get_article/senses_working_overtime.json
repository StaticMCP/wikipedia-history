He based the song on Manfred Mann's \"5-4-3-2-1\" (1964). The album and single became the highest-charting records XTC would ever have in the UK, peaking at number five and number 10, respectively.\nAt the suggestion of its director, the song's music video was filmed at double-speed and then slowed down, to make the musicians appear \"more graceful\". Partridge recalled: \"That one was done really quickly, in Shepperton Studios while we were rehearsing for the English Settlement tour. And so that's us rehearsing. ... [The half-speed idea has] been used a hell of a lot since then, but I think we were the first ones to do it.\"\nTrack listing\n#\"Senses Working Overtime\" (Andy Partridge)\n#\"Blame the Weather\" (Colin Moulding)\n#\"Tissue Tigers (The Arguers)\" (Partridge)\nOn the 12\" release, \"Egyptian Solution (Thebes in a Box) (Homo Safari #3)\" (Partridge) was added to the A-side as track 2; the B-side comprised \"Blame the Weather\" and \"Tissue Tigers\" on both 7\" and 12\".\nPersonnel\nXTC\n*Terry Chambers – drums, drum synthesiser\n*Dave Gregory – electric 12–string guitar, percussion\n*Colin Moulding – fretless bass, backing vocals\n*Andy Partridge – lead and backing vocals, acoustic guitar\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Chart (1982)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Ireland (IRMA)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1982)\n!Rank\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|97\n|}\nMandy Moore version\n|header=Audio video}}\n}}\n\"Senses Working Overtime\" was the third single released from Moore's third studio album Coverage (2003) as its opening track.
