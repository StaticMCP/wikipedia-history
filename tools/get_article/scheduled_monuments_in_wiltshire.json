Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. There are about 20,000 scheduled monument entries on the list, which is maintained by English Heritage; more than one site can be included in a single entry.\nWhile a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, English Heritage considers listed building status as a better way of protecting buildings than scheduled monument status. If a monument is considered by English Heritage to \"no longer merit scheduling\" it can be descheduled.\nList\nWiltshire has over 1,000 scheduled monuments.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Image\n!Name and reference\n!Feature\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Adam's Grave\n|Barrow\n|Alton Barnes\n|A Neolithic long barrow\n|-\n|\n|Bulford Kiwi\n|Monument\n|bulford\n|A chalk figure of a kiwi constructed by the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in 1919\n|-\n|\n|Caen Hill Locks\n|Structure\n|Devizes\n|A series of lock gates up a hill\n|-\n|\n|Grovely Castle\n|Castle\n|Steeple Langford\n|An Iron Age fort\n|-\n|\n|Stonehenge\n|Monument\n|Amesbury\n|A prehistoric monument\n|-\n|\n|Swanborough Tump\n|Barrow\n|Pewsey\n|A bowl barrow\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
