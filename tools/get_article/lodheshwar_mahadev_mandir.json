Pandav after the Mahabharata had performed the Mahayagya at this place, a well exists even today by the name Pandav-Kup. It is said in the vedas that the water of the well is having spiritual qualities and those who drink this water get cured of a number of ailments.  When Parshurama was cleansing the earth of kshatriyas, the surviving lodhis went to their Kuldevta Lodheshwar Mahadev to help them. He then asked them to drop their weapons thus their warrior lineage and pick up agricultural tools. Hence, many of them were the large landowners and zamindars till to date.\nFair\nThere are two fairs held at Mahadeva:\n* Fair in the Month of March–April: During this fair, held on the occasion of Mahashivratri at Mahadeva millions of devotees throng the place.\n* Local Fair: This fair is held in November–December.
