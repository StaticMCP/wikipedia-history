He was a tutor and then reader at New College London, from 1935 to 1959, when he became Professor of Ancient History at King's College London, retiring in 1970.  He nonetheless remained active in retirement and notably wrote chapters for the re-edition of The Cambridge Ancient History, but his contributions to volumes VII and VIII were published posthumously.\nPerhaps his most widely known work is From the Gracchi to Nero: A History of Rome from 133 B.C. to A.D. 68, a text widely used by students studying Rome in the late republic, as well as Rome under the Julio-Claudians.\nBooks\nAuthor:\n* , a Thirlwall Prize essay.\n* , reprinted.\n* .\n* , reprinted.\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\n* .\nEditor:\n* , 1939, with H.E.
