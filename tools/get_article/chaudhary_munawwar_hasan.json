One of his ancestors converted to Islam around the turn of the 1900s and the branch of his family which remained Hindu, which include Hukum Singh, are now political rivals. He had four brothers and three sisters, was married to Begum Tabassum Hasan, and had one son (Nahid Hasan) and one daughter (Iqra Hassan).\nPolitical life\nMunawwar was elected to the State Legislative assembly from Kairana Assembly constituency in 1991 and 1993 by defeating Hukum Singh. Hasan then elected to Lok Sabha in 1996 on a Samajwadi Party ticket. He was again elected on a Samajwadi Party ticket from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh in 2004, but rebelled at the time of 22 July trust vote. He was expelled by the Samajwadi Party, which also filed a petition seeking his disqualification from the House. The petition was pending with the Lok Sabha Speaker. He later joined the Bahujan Samaj Party. SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav sent Hasan to Rajya Sabha in 1998 after he lost the lok sabha election to Virendra Verma.\nDeath\nHe was killed in a road accident near Palwal in the state of Haryana in 2008.\nPositions held\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
