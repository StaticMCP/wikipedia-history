Syria left the union on 28 September 1961 following the 1961 Syrian coup d'état. Egypt would continue to use the name and symbols of the United Arab Republic until 1972. The flag would be readopted by Ba'athist Syria in 1980, leading to its use as a symbol of Neo-Ba'athism.\nThe flag still remains in use outside of Syria by modern Nasserist political groups such as the Iraqi Nasserist Socialist Vanguard Party.\nDesign\n]]\nThe flag consisted of a horizontal triband of red, white, and black, with two green five-pointed stars centred on the white band. The colors were taken from the Arab Liberation Flag that was used in Egypt since the 1952 Egyptian revolution. The black stood for the experience of colonial oppression endured by Arabs, the red symbolized the sacrifices and bloodshed in the fight for liberation from colonial rule, and white signified peace and bright future envisioned for independent Arab states. The two stars represented Egypt and Syria, and their green color represented Islam.\nLater use\nEgypt continued to use the flag of the United Arab Republic until 1972, after it changed its official name to the Arab Republic of Egypt. It was briefly used by North Yemen between 27 September and 1 November 1962 during the North Yemen civil war and was used as the flag of the Syrian Arab Republic under Ba'athist rule between 1980 and 2024. In 1963, Iraq adopted a flag that was similar but with three stars, representing the hope that Iraq would join the United Arab Republic.\nFile:Flag of the United Arab Republic (1958–1971), Flag of Syria (1980–2024).svg|The UAR flag was readopted by the Ba'ath Party of Syria as the flag of Syria used from 1980 to 2024\nFile:Flag of Iraq (1963–1991).svg|The flag of Iraq used from 1963 until 2008 and still remains in use as a symbol of various movements in the country, a similar 1:2 version was also briefly used in Syria\nFile:Flag of Iraq.svg|The flag of Iraq after 2008 retains the basic layout and colors of the previous flag\nFile:Flag of the Yemen Arab Republic.svg|Flag of North Yemen used from 1962 until reunification, was based on the UAR flag due to North Yemen's former position in the United Arab States\nFile:Flag of Khuzestan.svg|Flag of the Iraqi-backed Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan in Iran, first used during the Iran–Iraq War\nArmed forces flags\nFile:Army flag of the United Arab Republic.svg|Army flag of the United Arab Republic (1958–1961) and Egypt (1961–1972)\nFile:Naval Ensign of the United Arab Republic.svg|Naval Ensign of the United Arab Republic (1958–1961) and Egypt (1961–1972)\nFile:Airforce Ensign of the United Arab Republic.svg|Air Force Ensign of the United Arab Republic (1958–1961) and Egypt (1961–1972)\nGallery\nFile:Flag of Egypt (1922-1958).svg|Egyptian flag before 1958\nFlag of Syria (1930–1958, 1961–1963).svg|Syrian flag before 1958\nFlag of the United Arab Republic.svg|Egyptian flag after 1961 (Egypt used the UAR name and symbols until 1972) and Syrian flag after 1980 until 2024\nFlag of Syria (1930–1958, 1961–1963).svg|Syrian flag from 1961 to 1963\nSee also\n*Coat of arms of the United Arab Republic\n*Coat of arms of Ba'athist Syria\n*Walla Zaman Ya Selahy\n*Flag of Egypt\n**List of Egyptian flags\n*Flag of Syria\n**List of Syrian flags\n*Flag of the Federation of Arab Republics\nReferences"
