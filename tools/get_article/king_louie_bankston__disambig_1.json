Associated early on with garage rock, he abandoned the genre in 1998 and focused on Louisiana swamp pop, boogie woogie, boogie rock, and power pop. He was best known for his work in the Royal Pendletons, The Persuaders, The Exploding Hearts, and The King Louie One Man Band. Bankston toured Europe and the United States,  since the early 1990s. He released 53 records in the vinyl format. Bankston later played music based out of Oakland, California. He lived in New Orleans, Portland, Oregon, and Memphis, Tennessee.\nHistory\nRoyal Pendletons\nKing Louie helped found the Royal Pendletons in 1991 along with Michael Hurtt on guitar/vocals, J. Matthew Uhlman on guitar/vocals, and G. Thomas Oliver on organ. The band achieved in the pre-internet years what is now known as a \" Buzz Band \" status today. Not concentrating on the studio or recording side of their set the band has little to show for their efforts. The RP's were known to have over 100 songs and usually played from open to close at New Orleans venues Checkpoint Charlie's, Benny's and Barristers (Memphis). The Royal Pendletons put out their first 7-inch on Goner Records in 1995, and in 1998 put out a full-length LP on Sympathy for the Record Industry with producer Alex Chilton entitled Oh Yeah, Baby.\nTerry and Louie\nTerry and Louie is a return to Louie's Exploding Hearts writing and playing with bandmate Terry. After over a decade of no communication the two had reformed and were making records and touring throughout the year. The band has been active since 2013. They are on the Tuff Break record roster and were based out of Oakland. It was Louis' only project of new music.\nThe Persuaders\nKing Louie Bankston formed the garage rock band, The Persuaders in 1996, along with Jason Panzer on guitar, and Shaggy on drums. In The Persuaders, Louie and Jason Panzer both sang and played Gibson Flying V guitars and were the first to use them visually with the crossed aerial logo.\nBad Times\nBad Times were a one-off band which also included Eric Oblivian and Jay Reatard. The band recorded an album's worth of material after only one practice session in 1998, releasing a self-titled LP in 2001. the members returned to their respective solo commitments. Eric and Louie have been positive about trying to re-issue the out-of-print LP.\nThe Exploding Hearts\nIn 2000, Louie moved to Portland, Oregon. In 2001 he joined The Exploding Hearts, where he co-wrote and played keyboards on their only LP, Guitar Romantic. After 11 months with the group, Louie declined to move into a management/lead role. Plans were in the works to continue as a writer only, while the band continued to play as a four-piece. After a show in San Francisco, the band's van overturned on the way home in the early hours of July 20, 2003. Three members of the group were killed, thus precluding any future work together.\nKing Louie and the Loose Diamonds\nFormed in 2003 as Rat Tail, in 2007, Empty Records released Memphis Treet by King Louie and the Loose Diamonds. The Loose Diamonds are: King Louie Bankston (until 2022), Jack Oblivian (of the Oblivians, The Cool Jerks, and the Tennessee Tearjerkers), Harlan T. Bobo (Viva L'American Deathray Music), Adam Woodard (Tennessee Tearjerkers), and Chad Booth (Kajun SS). In 2009 Julian Fried joined as guitar player.\nThe King Louie One Man Band\nKing Louie started his One Man Band in 1999. In the King Louie One Man Band, Louie sang, played drums, guitar, cowbell, and harmonica. The King Louie One Man Band has released several 7-inch records on various labels, and put out a full-length LP on Goner in 2004.\nKing Louie's Missing Monuments\nIn 2009, King Louie along with longtime friend and collaborator, revered lead guitarist Julien Fried formerly of Seattle, recruited drummer Aaron Hill and bassist Bennette Bartley to form the power pop group King Louie's Missing Monuments. Benny Divine (Wizzard Sleeve) later joined the band after Bartley's departure and the band changed their name to The Missing Monuments. Devine left the band and was replaced by Gary Mader (Eyehategod). They have released two LP's and 4 singles/E.P.'s. They have toured the US and Europe.  In February 2016 the band once again for the third time changed the name to reflect the latest lineup and ever changing sound to King Louie and The Missing Monuments. A new album BADFINDER is forthcoming with no set completion or release date.\nOther bands\nKing Louie Bankston has played in a number of bands in the past 20 years.
