It was published in 2004.\nIn the book, Rampton and Stauber argue that a right-wing political machine, in the form of the Republican Party and its functionaries in the media, lobbying establishment and electoral system, is undermining dissent and squelching pluralistic politics in the United States.\nIn writing Banana Republicans, Rampton and Stauber experimented with collaborative research, inviting Disinfopedia users to contribute their own research and analysis while the book was being written.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040609182052/http://bananarepublicans.org/ Banana Republicans website]\n* [http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Banana_Republicans Banana Republicans] at SourceWatch"
