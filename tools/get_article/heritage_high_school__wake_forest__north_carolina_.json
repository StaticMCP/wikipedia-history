A part of the Wake County Public School System, Heritage High School is home to over 1,900 students  in 9th–12th grade.\nHistory\nHeritage High School opened in 2010 in response to rapid population growth throughout Wake Forest. During the 2009–2010 school year, the campus was used by the students and staff of Wake Forest-Rolesville High School while their campus underwent renovations. When Heritage opened, educators from a variety of surrounding high schools were brought in, including former Wakefield High School principal Mark Savage.\nWhen Heritage first opened, it was only occupied by students in 9th and 10th grades. In this first year, Heritage trotted out varsity teams in every sport with the exception of football. In the 2011–2012 school year, the building was three-fourths occupied due to the addition of another freshman class. The school was finally filled with all four classes in the 2012–2013 school year. The 2012&ndash;2013 year also marked Heritage's first-ever graduating class.\nStarting in the 2013-2014 school year, the Heritage High School Game Art and Design Academy was formed in efforts to bring a STEM specialization to Heritage. The program spanned the course of three freshman cohorts, the first being the only to fully complete the program.\nIn the 2017-2018 school year, the program was suddenly abandoned after program coordinator Leonard Bullock resigned from his position with the school. Qualifying members of the second cohort were given an opportunity to complete the program via an internship with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services as IT assistants.\nOn July 19, 2016 the Wake County Public School System announced that Heritage principle Mark Savage would be promoted to the Western Area Superintendent and former Enloe principal, Scott Lyons would be moved to Heritage to become the school's second principal. In the 2024-2025 school year, Mr. Lyons left and Jo Ellen Newhouse, previously the principal of Heritage Middle School, became the new principal.\nEarly accolades\nAfter the first graduating class, Mark Savage was named WCPSS Principal of the Year in 2013, an impressive accomplishment for a new high school. The following year, Heritage teacher Allison Reid was named the Wake County Teacher of the Year for her outstanding ability to integrate technology into instruction. In 2016, Miles Macleod, another Heritage educator, was named Wake County Teacher of the Year for his work in establishing a culture of service and global knowledge at the school through the creation of Project Wisdom organization. Heritage became the first Wake County school to ever have two different educators win the award in three years.\nAthletics\n}}\nAs a public high school, Heritage is a member of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association. Due to its large population, Heritage is classified into the 4A division, the highest classification. Ever since opening in 2010, Heritage has been a member of the CAP-8 conference, a Raleigh-based conference made entirely up of 4A schools. In May 2016, the NCHSAA passed a new set of conferences that, when placed into effect for the 2017–18 school year, moves Heritage into the Northern Athletic Conference, which is made up of six 4A schools to the east of Raleigh. Until then, Heritage will remain in the CAP-8 for one more season.\nSports teams\nSource:\n* Baseball\n* Basketball (men's and women's)\n* Cheerleading (men's and women's)\n* Cross country (men's and women's)\n* Football\n* Golf (men's and women's)\n* Lacrosse (men's and women's)\n* Soccer (men's and women's)\n* Softball\n* Swimming (men's and women's)\n* Stunt\n* Track and field (indoor and outdoor; men's and women's)\n* Tennis (men's and women's)\n* Volleyball\n* Wrestling\nConference championships\n*Softball: 2015 (co-champions), 2016\n*Women's Golf: 2013, 2014, 2019\n*Men's Diving: 2018, 2019\nState championships\n*Cheerleading: 2015–16, 2016–17 (Division 1)\n*Women's Soccer: 2018&ndash;2019\nSchool organizations\nNotable student organizations include: Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Science Olympiad, Queer Inclusivity Organization, Student Government Association, Key Club, National Achievers Society, Art Club, International Club,  and National Honor Society.
