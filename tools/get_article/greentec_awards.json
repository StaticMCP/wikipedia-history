Founded in 2008 by the Berlin-based consultancy VKP engineering GmbH, the prize honors projects, products, and people contributing to the protection of the environment. The GreenTec Awards were formerly known as the Clean Tech Media Awards.\nIn 2017, Canada was the partner country of the GreenTec Awards; Norway is official partner for 2019. In 2018, the GreenTec Awards opened the IFAT, the world's biggest trade fair for environmental technologies, for the third time.\nContest\nThe GreenTec Awards are awarded annually in varying categories. Additionally, there are \"Special Prizes\".\nCertification\nThe competition of the GreenTec Awards is supervised by TÜV Nord in order to ensure fairness and transparency in the selection of the laureates. The award process received the certificate \"Certified process of competition\" by TÜV Nord.\nJury\nCurrently, a 75-member jury with independent representatives from business, media, and science chooses two of the three finalists per category – the third finalist is determined via a public online voting. In an annual jury meeting, the top three projects are presented and discussed, and the winners are chosen in a secret vote.\nIn 2013, the dual fluid nuclear reactor design won the public vote for the Galileo Knowledge Prize, but the award committee presiding over the awards changed the rules to exclude all nuclear designs before announcing the winner. The DFR participants successfully sued in response to this.\nAward ceremony\nThe GreenTec Awards are awarded at an annual gala event with 1000 guests from business and industry, science, politics, media, and showbiz. The event alternately takes place in Berlin and Munich and is organized in collaboration with partners from different social sectors, such as Fraunhofer, Wilo, and the Germany Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA). With music acts, media partners like Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, WirtschaftsWoche and ProSieben, and a \"Green Carpet\", the GreenTec Awards seek to make the topic of environmental protection more appealing to the broad public.\nLaureates\nFormer laureates (selection)\nPeople\n* Dr. Auma Obama\n* Bob Geldof (The Boomtown Rats)\n* Clark Datchler (Johnny Hates Jazz)\n* Elon Musk (Tesla)\n* Morton Harket (A-ha)\n* NENA\n* Nico Rosberg (Formula One World Champion, 2016)\n* Rea Garvey\nProjects and products\n* Alstom with the hydrogen train Coradia iLint\n* BMW i8\n* car2go\n* Continental with dandelion rubber production\n* JouleX\n* Little Sun\n* Showerloop\n* Skysails\nCurrent laureates\nIn 2018, there were nine categories and three special prizes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Laureates GreenTec Awards 2018\n!Category\n!\n|-\n|Construction & Living\n|DAW SE – Sustainable Wood Care Products based on Camelina\n|-\n|Energy\n|MWK Bionik GmbH – BioSol: Efficiency-Increasing Coating for PV Plants\n|-\n|Lifestyle\n|aha Zweckverband Abfallwirtschaft Region Hannover – Hannoccino, the reusable cup\n|-\n|Galileo Wissenspreis\n|BioLab Eberswalde – Mushroom-Based Plastic Alternatives\n|-\n|Mobility by Schaeffler\n|Alstom – Hydrogen Train Coradia iLint\n|-\n|Resources & Recycling by Veolia\n|Association of Lady Entrepreneurs of India (ALEAP) – Women against Waste\n|-\n|Sports by Jack Wolfskin\n|VAUDE Sport GmbH & Co.
