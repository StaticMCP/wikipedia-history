The bell tower is found at the intersection of Strada Macedonio Melloni, Borgo del Parmigianino, and Strada Cavour in central Parma, Italy.\nHistory and description\nBell-tower\nThe adjacent church had been rebuilt in a late-Renaissance style from 1584 to 1604, but the Baroque renovation of the bell-tower was not started until 1690 with designs by Domenico Valmagini. Restoration took decades to complete.\nMonument\nIn 1961, the Monument to those fallen in all wars (Monumento dedicato ai caduti di tutte le guerre) was installed on the side of the tower facing via Cavour. It is notable that the monument did not honor those of any specific war, although the bronze relief with the grim visages of five soldiers, framed by barbed wire, recalls soldiers of the wars in the first half of the twentieth century. The design was by the architect Mario Monguidi with the sculptures by Renato Brozzi and Luigi Froni. In a niche above the soldiers is a bronze kneeling figure in Ancient Roman battle uniform, representing the Italian lineage, with arms hanging straight down at sides, with a sword draped in front of his groin. In 1961, the plaque was inaugurated by the Italian president Giovanni Gronchi. It reads in the verses by Parmesan poet Jacopo Bocchialini (1878–1965); (in all capital letters and in a Sans-serif script, which recalls the script used by the fascists):\nThe monument is the site for wreath-laying on 4 November, the day memorializing the Italian armed forces: Giornata dell’Unità Nazionale e delle Forze Armate.\nReferences"
