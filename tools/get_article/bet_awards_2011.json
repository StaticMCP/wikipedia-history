Rapper Trina, who released her fifth studio album Amazin'' in 2010, felt snubbed that she was not included among the nominees for the Best Female Hip-Hop Artist category, taking to her Twitter account to post \"f*ck BET......\". Two of the artists who were nominated—Nicki Minaj and Diamond— also criticized the nominations via Twitter. Singer Keyshia Cole also felt snubbed for not receiving any nominations, and took to her Twitter account, saying \"its like this. Been on the scene 7 years. I was 21 when I got signed. 7 # 1 records. No awards 4 none of them/still touring. It is Wht it is.\" She also tweeted, \"These types of thing R the way they R. I'm not upset about any of it in any way. I hope everyone that goes has a wonderful time.\"\nBET's president of programming, music and specials, Stephen Hill, spoke about the matter in an interview with Billboard.com's The Juice. In response to criticism over Trina for not getting any nominations, Hill said she did not submit a music video during the eligibility period of April 1, 2010 to March 30, 2011. Although she was featured in LoLa Monroe's music video for \"Over Time\" in November 2010, Hill said being a featured act \"doesn't make you eligible\". He also responded to Cole's nominations snub, stating \"we simply had to go, as we always do, with the artists who got the most votes in that [best female R&B artist] category. The nominations consist of the artists that got the top votes in that category when put to our voting academy. If there is six nominations in a category that means there was a tie.\"\nThere was criticism that Beyoncé received a nomination, despite the fact that her last album I Am... Sasha Fierce was released in 2008. Hill stated, \"Beyoncé submitted a video for \"Why Don't You Love Me\" early May of 2010. She submitted one video remaining from her I Am... Sasha Fierce project. That was the last video she submitted and it was submitted during this year's eligibility period. She was voted on the strength of that one video even though the bulk of that project was the year before.\"\nAlso, on the night of the award show ceremony, R&B artist Lloyd criticized the show. Feeling snubbed, Lloyd cited on his Twitter page how upset he was that his video, along with his record label mates, Lil Wayne and Young Money had the first R&B single of the Lil Wayne's career to reach number 1 on BET's 106 and Park, for the song \"Bedrock\", yet were not nominated for an award.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110521002042/http://www.bet.com/shows/bet-awards/2011.html 2011 BET Awards]"
