The ward has existed since the creation of the borough on 1 April 1965 and was first used in the 1964 elections. It returns councillors to Havering London Borough Council.\nThe ward was subject to boundary revisions in 1978, 2002 and 2022. The revision in 1978 increased the number of councillors from two to three. The ward has covered western parts of the London County Council-built Harold Hill estate that was completed in 1958. It has been dominated by the Labour Party throughout its existence. Notable councillors have been Michael Ward, who was MP for Peterborough and Keith Darvill, who was MP for Upminster.\nList of councillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Term\n!
