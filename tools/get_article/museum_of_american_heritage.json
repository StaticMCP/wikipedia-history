It is dedicated to the preservation and display of electrical and mechanical technology and inventions from the 1750s through the 1950s. The museum has a large collection of artifacts that are generally not accessible to the public. Selections from the collection are displayed in a historic house at 351 Homer Ave, Palo Alto, California. MOAH is a 501 (c)(3) non profit organization and a member of the American Alliance of Museums.\nHistory\nThe Museum of American Heritage was originally opened to the public on September 20, 1990. Prior to that it was the private collection of Frank Livermore (1919–2000). The museum was originally located at 275 Alma Street in Palo Alto (from September 1990 through November 1994). From 1995 through 1998 the museum occupied a former BMW dealership at 3401 El Camino Real in Palo Alto. The current location on Homer Avenue was opened to the public in 1998.\nAt the time of his death, the Livermore Collection of consisted of approximately 1,000 artifacts.

The museum accepts donated artifacts that meet these criteria for inclusion in the collection.\nThe MOAH collection is housed in a remote warehouse and is seldom open to the public. Categories typical to the collection include: sewing machines, mechanical typewriters, cameras, radios and televisions, clocks, toys, adding machines and mechanical calculators, and kitchen appliances. There are over 8,000 accessioned artifacts in the collection and many more that are display items, extras, or permanent loan items. It is reported to be one of the largest collections of its kind in the United States.\nItems from the collection are used for MOAH permanent and rotating exhibits. Other museums and institutions are able to borrow items from the MOAH collection for their exhibits or other displays. Organizations that have borrowed exhibit materials from MOAH include the San Francisco International Airport museum, the Los Altos History Museum, San Jose State University theater department, and the Stanford Federal Credit union.\nThe museum collection database is currently only accessible during public hours at the main museum location in Palo Alto.\nHouse\nFormer home of Dr. Thomas Williams\nThe Museum of American Heritage is currently open to the public in the Williams House on Homer Avenue in Palo Alto. This house was custom built in 1907 by Dr. Thomas Williams for his residence and private medical practice. Dr. Williams is noted for having opened the first doctor's office in the Palo Alto area, which eventually grew to become the Palo Alto Medical Clinic. The house is a Tudor Revival design, and the architect was Ernest Coxhead. The house was owned by the Williams family until the death of the last living daughter of Thomas and Dora Williams, Rhona Williams. The house was bequeathed to the City of Palo Alto to be used for the community benefit.\nHome for the Museum of American Heritage\nIn 1997, Palo Alto asked for request for proposals of how to use the property. The city selected the Museum of American Heritage proposal, and after a significant restoration the museum opened its doors to public in 1998. Significant features of the Williams house include:\n*Two story portion for the family living quarters with extensive built in cabinetry (the upstairs is currently not open to the general public)\n*Single story section designed specifically for Dr. Williams medical practice including an operating room with a large skylight for illumination\n*A large detached garage which housed one of the first automobiles in Palo Alto (this building was substantially altered during the 1997 restoration).\nThe Williams house is currently on the Palo Alto Historic Inventories list as a Category II on the Palo Alto Historic Building Inventory. The building behind the main house (named the \"Livermore Learning Center\") is a new structure and is located where a small family orchard was originally located.\nWilliams House Gardens\nEarly photographs of the Williams' property show an open vista with an unobstructed view of the house, the beginnings of landscape, and only a few native trees. But Dora Williams' interest and proficiency in gardening developed along with her garden until it reached a height of complexity in the 1920s and 1930s. Her extensive notes on the garden document the garden development over the years, and have allowed the garden to be restored to its original state.\nUnlike many public specimen gardens, this garden was (and remains) representative of an early 20th Century residential landscape. Featuring \"outdoor rooms\" delineated by rock walls and border plantings and punctuated by ornamental fountains and ponds.\nAt the same time the garden area served the more utilitarian functions required by the Williams family, such as a vegetable garden, a medicinal plants garden, clothes drying, and composting. It is attributed to be the only historically preserved landscape in Palo Alto, and one of the few in California.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.moah.org/ Museum of American Heritage] - official website"
