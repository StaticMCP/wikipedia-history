It was founded by John Woodward in 1728 under the title of Professor of Fossils. Woodward's will left to the University a large collection of fossils and also dictated that the professor should be elected by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Ely, the President of the Royal Society, the President of the Royal College of Physicians, the Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, and the University Senate.\nIncumbents of the Woodwardian Professorship of Geology\n*Conyers Middleton, 1731\n*Charles Mason, 1734 (died 1770 and described on his [http://www.druidic.org/camchurch/churches/orwell.htm tomb in Orwell church] as \"Woodwardian Professor of Fossils\")\n*John Michell, 1762\n*Samuel Ogden, 1764\n*Thomas Green, 1778\n*John Hailstone, 1788\n*Adam Sedgwick, 1818\n*Thomas McKenny Hughes, 1873\n*John Edward Marr, 1917\n*Owen Thomas Jones, 1930\n*William Bernard Robinson King, 1943\n*Oliver Meredith Boone Bulman, 1955\n*Harry Blackmore Whittington, 1966-1983\n*Ian Nicholas McCave, 1985-2008\n*David A.
