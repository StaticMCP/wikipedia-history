Established in 2007 along with the other wards, it currently elects three Councillors.\nThe ward covers an area in the far west of the city, bounded generally by Corstorphine Hill, the Queensferry Road (A90), Maybury Road (A902) and Edinburgh City Bypass (A720) roads, and the Glasgow–Edinburgh via Falkirk line railway; it includes the Bughtlin, Clermiston, Clerwood, Craigmount, Drumbrae, East Craigs, Gogarloch, Maybury, North Gyle, Parkgrove, South Gyle and West Craigs neighbourhoods, as well as the Edinburgh Park commercial district. A minor boundary change in 2017 caused the loss of the Wester Broom neighbourhood and the addition of Forrester with a negligible effect on the population, which in 2019 stood at 23,534.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Colin Keir(SNP)\n|rowspan=4; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|Robert Aldridge(Liberal Democrats)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Jenny Dawe(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1|Ron Cairns(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Karen Keil(Labour)\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=1|Claire Bridgman(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Mark Brown(Conservative)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=1|Euan Hyslop(SNP)\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Edward John Thornley(Liberal Democrats)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 election\n2017 election\n2017 City of Edinburgh Council election\nOn 17 July 2018, SNP councillor Claire Bridgman resigned from the party for undisclosed reasons and became an Independent.\n2012 election\n2012 City of Edinburgh Council election\n2007 election\n2007 City of Edinburgh Council election\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/scotland/drum-braegyle-ward-city-of-edinburgh#.YGRO-VPTVkw Listed Buildings in Drum Brae/Gyle Ward, City of Edinburgh] at British Listed Buildings"
