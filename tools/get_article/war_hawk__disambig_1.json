Hawkish individuals are the opposite of war doves, who advocate negotiations and peaceful settlements to resolve disputes and view the option of going to war as one to be avoided by any means unless absolutely necessary. The terms are derived by historical analogy with the birds of the same name: hawks are predatory birds that attack and eat other animals, whereas doves eat seeds and fruit and are a symbol of peace.\nVariations of the term include chicken hawk, referring to a person who supports waging war but previously avoided or is actively avoiding military service (i.e., cowardice); and liberal hawk, referring to a person who adheres to passive liberalism in domestic politics while simultaneously having a militaristic and interventionist foreign policy.\nHistorical group\n, a \"guiding spirit\" of the 19th-century war hawks]]\nThe term \"war hawk\" was coined in 1792 and was often used to ridicule politicians who favored a pro-war policy in peacetime. Historian Donald R. Hickey found 129 uses of the term in American newspapers before late 1811, mostly from Federalists warning against Democratic-Republican foreign policy. Some antiwar Democratic-Republicans used it, such as Virginia Congressman John Randolph of Roanoke.  There was never any \"official\" roster of War Hawks; as Hickey notes, \"Scholars differ over who (if anyone) ought to be classified as a War Hawk.\" However, most historians use the term to describe about one or two dozen members of the Twelfth Congress. The leader of this faction was Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina was another notable War Hawk. Both of these men became major players in American politics for decades, despite failing to win the presidency themselves. Other men traditionally identified as War Hawks include Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky, William Lowndes of South Carolina, Langdon Cheves of South Carolina, Felix Grundy of Tennessee, and William W. Bibb of Georgia.\n, another Southern politician famous for being a war hawk]]\nPresident James Madison set the legislative agenda for Congress, providing committees in the House of Representatives with policy recommendations to be introduced as bills on the House floor. Nevertheless, he was regarded as a \"timid soul\" and tried to restrain the martial zeal of the War Hawks.\nVariations of the term\nThe term has also been expanded into \"chicken hawk\", referring to a war hawk who avoided military service.\nThe term \"liberal hawk\" is a derivation of the traditional phrase, in the sense that it denotes an individual with socially liberal inclinations coupled with an aggressive outlook on foreign policy. The term \"neoconservative\" is also used to denote an individual with conservative inclinations coupled with an aggressive outlook on foreign policy.\nIn modern American usage, \"hawk\" refers to a fierce advocate for a cause or policy, such as \"deficit hawk\" or \"privacy hawk\". It may also refer to a person or political leader who favors a strong or aggressive military policy, though not necessarily outright war.\nIn the Philippines, a war hawk is usually referred to, in slang, as \"war freaks\". The term is used to describe people who are belligerent or prone to arguments.\nSee also\n* Animal epithet\n* Hardline\n* Jingoism\n* Warmonger (disambiguation)\nReferences\nBibliography\n* History, Significance, & Facts  Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/War-Hawk |access-date=2024-04-20 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}\n*"
