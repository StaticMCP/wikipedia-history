While playing as defensive stalwart at Harbour View, his club won the Jamaica National Premier League in 2000 and CFU Club Championship in 2004. In February 2005, he had a trial with Darlington, following which he was due to sign for the rest of the 2004–05, until his move was blocked by the Home Office.\nBradford City\nHe returned to England in the summer with Bradford City and signed a season long loan for the 2005–06 season. He made his Bradford debut as a half-time substitute in a 2–0 defeat to Southend United on 9 August 2005. His first start came on 12 November 2005 when he was substituted after just 27 minutes. He scored his first goal in a 1–0 victory over AFC Bournemouth to help ease Bradford's relegation worries. In total, he played 23 league games during his loan spell as Bradford came 11th in League One.\nQueens Park Rangers\nBradford manager Colin Todd had hoped to keep Stewart on, but his form earned him a six-figure transfer to Championship side Queens Park Rangers. After a shaky start to life in the Championship, Stewart hit form after the arrival of Danny Cullip from Nottingham Forest. He soon cemented his place in the Queens Park Rangers side and played more than 80&nbsp;games in the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons. In the 2007–08 season, Stewart scored five goals, but was also sent off twice. He memorably scored the only goal as QPR knocked Aston Villa out of the 2008–09 League Cup with a 1–0 victory at Villa Park.\nBristol City\nHe joined Bristol City on a three-year contract, in July 2010, for an undisclosed fee. He made his Championship debut for City against Millwall on 7 August and was booked twice, resulting in a red card. He scored his first goal against Doncaster a week later. He was released on 31 August 2012.\nLoan to Notts County\nOn 5 January 2012, Damion joined Notts County on a loan until the end of the season.\nNotts County\nDamion signed a short-term contract with Notts County on 2 November 2012.\nPahang FA\nOn 5 April 2013, Pahang FA confirmed that had secured the services of 32-year-old Jamaican defender, Damion Stewart. The former Notts County and Queens Park Rangers player was impressive in friendly matches against Police PDRM FA and Kuala Lumpur at the Temerloh Stadium. The lanky Stewart, who has 55 caps, has great leadership qualities and formed a formidable partnership with Jalaluddin Jaafar, Zaiza 'The Lord' Zainal Abidin, Razman Roslan and Saiful Nizam Miswan in defence. On 3 November 2013, Stewart assisted Pahang to win the Malaysian Cup, which the last time Pahang did it was 21 years ago (1992).\nPerlis FA\nAfter a successful time with Pahang FA, Stewart was confirmed by Perlis FA coach, Dollah Salleh on July that he was signed by the team during the second transfer window to strengthen the team in order to face the remaining matches in the 2016 Malaysia Premier League. In July 2017, he was released from Perlis FA.\nInternational career\nStewart played for the Jamaica Under-20 and Under-23 youth national teams. He made his international debut for Jamaica National Football Team in 1999 against Ghana. He has played in the 2003, 2005, and 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cups and numerous World Cup qualification matches since his senior team debut.\nManagerial career\nIn 2019, Stewart was named head coach of Harbour View FC.\nHonours\nClub\n*Jamaica National Premier League:\n** Winners (1): 2000\n*JFF Champions Cup:\n** Winners (2): 2001, 2002\n** Runner-up (2): 2003, 2005\n*Malaysia Cup: 2\n** Winners (2): 2013, 2014\n*Malaysia FA Cup: 1\n** Winners (1): 2014\n* Malaysia Charity Shield\n** Winners (1): 2014\nInternational\n*CFU Club Championship:\n** Winners (1): 2004\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.sinarharian.com.my/ultras/liga-malaysia/stewart-sedia-layan-serangan-trw-1.215988 Stewart sedia 'layan' serangan TRW]\n*[http://www.hmetro.com.my/myMetro/articles/Stewarttaksabaraksifinal/Article/index_html Stewart tak sabar aksi final]\n*[http://utusan.com.my/utusan/Sukan/20131018/su_07/PBNP-sasar-32000-tiket-dijual PBNP sasar 32,000 tiket dijual]\n*[http://www.goal.com/en-my/slideshow/3581 Top 5 Foreign Signings of the MSL]\n*[http://www.sinarharian.com.my/ultras/liga-malaysia/stewart-mahu-pahang-menang-di-shah-alam-1.207267 Stewart mahu Pahang menang di Shah Alam]\n* [http://www.hmetro.com.my/myMetro/articles/Stewartyakinkefinal/Article/index_html Stewart yakin ke final]\n*[https://archive.today/20130703035847/http://football.thestar.com.my/2013/04/27/new-signings-conti-and-stewart-inspire-pahang-to-win-over-felda/ New signings Conti and Stewart inspire Pahang to win over Felda]\n*[https://archive.today/20130629080147/http://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/m-league/news/detail/item961694/Conti,-Stewart-tipped-to-boost-Pahang-title-bid/ Conti, Stewart tipped to boost Pahang title bid]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130412042236/http://www.nst.com.my/sports/soccer/pahang-turn-to-stewart-1.252865 Pahang turn to Stewart]\n*[http://www.qpr.co.uk/page/ProfilesDetail/0,,10373~33769,00.html Damion Stewart player profile] at qpr.co.uk\n*"
