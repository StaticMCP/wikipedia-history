He was a chief Polish representative of contemporary religious lyrics. He wrote short, simple poems, humorous, which often included colloquialisms. He joined observations of nature with philosophical reflections.\nThe Father Jan Twardowski Monument in [[Warsaw, Poland.]]\nBiography\nJan Twardowski was born on 1 June 1915 in Warsaw, Congress Poland. His parents were Jan Twardowski and Aniela Maria Konderska. Several weeks after his birth, due to the events of World War I, his family moved to Russia. After 3 years, they returned to Warsaw. He finished middle school in 1935.\nIn 1932, he began working with the youth newspaper \"Kuźnia Młodych\" (\"Forge of the Young\"). He had his own column there, for which he wrote poems, short stories, and interviewed various writers.\nAfter middle school, he began studying literature at the Józef Piłsudski University (University of Warsaw). In 1937 he published his first book of poetry.\nDuring World War II he took part in various operations organised by the Armia Krajowa and fought in the Warsaw Uprising.\nAfter the war, he joined a seminary and began studying theology at the Warsaw University. He became a priest in 1948. In 1959 he became a provost of the Visitationist Church. His writings were published in a popular Polish Catholic magazine, Tygodnik Powszechny. He gained fame in 1960 after publishing his first poetry book, \"Znak Ufności\" (\"The Sign of Trust\"). In 1980 he received the PEN Club and Robert Graves lifetime achievement awards, and, in 1996, the Order Uśmiechu (The Order of the Smile). In 2000, Twardowski won the IKAR prize, and was rewarded with the TOTUS prize a year later.\nJan Twardowski died on 18 January 2006 in Warsaw. He was buried within the crypts of the Temple of Divine Providence on the outskirts of the Polish capital, despite the fact that he wanted to be buried at the Powązki cemetery in Warsaw.\nWorks\n, Warsaw]]\nPoetry:\n* 1959: Wiersze, (\"Verses\"); Warsaw\n* 1970: Znaki ufności, (\"Signs of Trust\"), Kraków: Znak\n* 1980: Niebieskie okulary, (\"Blue Sunglasses\"), Kraków: Znak\n* 1983: Który stwarzasz jagody (\"Who Made the Blueberry\"), Kraków: Wydawnictwo literackie\n* 1986: Nie przyszedłem pana nawracać.
