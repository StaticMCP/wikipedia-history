Iranians in the United Kingdom are referred to by hyphenated terms such as British-Iranians, British-Persians, Iranian-Britons, or Persian-Britons.\nAs of the 2021 United Kingdom census, the British-Iranian population was approximately 114,432 people. The vast majority of British-Iranians arrived after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, with an estimated 8,000 Iranian asylum seekers arriving in the United Kingdom in the following five years. Due to intensifying religious and political persecution, particularly of Iranian Christians, the numbers of Iranian asylum seekers arriving at UK soil has significantly risen in the last decade.\nHistory\nThe vast majority of Iranians in the UK arrived after the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In the following five years, an estimated 8,000 Iranian asylum seekers arrived in the country. The 1981 census showed 28,617 persons born in Iran (18,132 men, 10,485 women). Iranians were not separately distinguished in the 1991 census. The 2001 census recorded 42,494 persons born in Iran. In the 2011 census, 79,985 Iranian-born people were recorded in England, 1,695 in Wales, 2,773 in Scotland and 282 in Northern Ireland. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, in 2017, 70,000 Iranian-born people were living in the UK. In 2004, the Iranian embassy in London estimated that as many as 75,000 Iranians might reside in the country. Most adults are themselves immigrants; the second generation are quite young, and so there are relatively few adults of Iranian background born and raised in the UK.\nIn the six-year period between 2018 and 2023, 21,565 Iranian nationals entered the United Kingdom by crossing the English Channel using small boats – the most common nationality of all small boat arrivals.\nReligion\nIran is a primarily Shia Muslim country with Jewish, Baháʼí, Christian and Zoroastrian communities, a fact reflected in the migrant population in the UK. However, there is an increasing number of Iranian atheists and agnostics. Some Iranians in the UK have converted from Shi'ism to various sects of Christianity. There are also active Jewish and Christian communities among British Iranians.\nSee also\n* List of British Iranians\n* Iranian diaspora\n* Iran–United Kingdom relations\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00gkqpm The Flight from Tehran: British-Iranians 30 Years On], a series of radio programmes from the BBC\n*[http://www.iranianassociation.org.uk Iranian Association], Iranian Association was established as a registered charity in 1985 providing information and advice.
