With a two-to-one superiority in numbers and even more in artillery, the Chilean army under the command of Colonel Estanislao del Canto was unable to destroy the little Peruvian army of General Cáceres, and withdrew to the town of Pucará leaving the Peruvian army to continue its strategic retreat.\nNotes"
