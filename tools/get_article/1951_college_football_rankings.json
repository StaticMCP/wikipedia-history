Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nAP poll\nThe final AP poll was released on December 3, at the end of the 1951 regular season, weeks before the major bowls.
