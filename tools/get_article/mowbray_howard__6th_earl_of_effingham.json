He was educated at Lancing College.\nIn October 1932, Howard was charged with manslaughter after an inquest found that he had knocked down an agricultural labourer in his car. However, the case was dismissed when it came to the magistrates' court at Maidenhead.\nHe served in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War, succeeding his father as Earl of Effingham on 7 July 1946.\nHis first wife, Hungarian-born Maria Malvina Gertler, was under suspicion by MI5, and in fact was interned for three months in 1941 on the grounds that she was involved in the \"preparation of acts prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm\" and held in Holloway prison. They were divorced in 1946.\nIn 1952 he married Gladys Irene Freeman; they were divorced in 1971. His third wife was (Mabel) Suzanne Mingay Le Pen (1919–2008), whom he married in 1972. He had no children and was succeeded by his nephew David Howard.\nIn return for £10 per week, Effingham agreed to serve on the board of Esmeralda's Barn, the gambling club operated by the Kray twins in the early 1960s.\nReferences and sources\n;References\n;Sources\n*[http://thepeerage.com/p3452.htm#i34519 thepeerage.com Mowbray Howard, 6th Earl of Effingham]\nExternal links\n*"
