Two tributaries of the Tate River, the Sandy Tate River and the Rocky Tate River, also rise in the locality.\nThe Kennedy Highway enters the locality from the east (Gunnawarra) and exits to the south-east (Minnamoolka), where it becomes the Kennedy Developmental Road at the intersection with the Gulf Developmental Road. The Gulf Developmental then enters Forty Mile from the south-east (Minnamoolka) and exits to the south (Mount Surprise).\nOotann Road crosses the northern part of the locality, entering from the north-east (Gunnawarra) and exiting to the north-west (Barwidgi).\nForty Mile has the following mountains (from north to south):\n* Dicky Hill ()\n* Wandoo Hill ()\n* Mount Mist ()\n* Lost Pinnacle ()\nThe Forty Mile Scrub National Park is in the south-east corner of the locality, extending into neighbouring Minnammolka.
