Here Mary is conjured just by speaking her name, and starts to target the descendants of the five people responsible for her death; she was killed as part of a failed kidnapping attempt at prom 1969, over three decades previously.\n* Bloody Mary, a 2006 film set in a psychiatric hospital.\n* Dead Mary, a 2007 film based on a screenplay titled Bloody Mary.\n* The Legend of Bloody Mary, a 2008 film by director John Stecenko, includes a character, Amy, who goes missing for good after playing the game \"Bloody Mary\".\n* Bloody Mary, a 2011 horror film by director Charlie Vaughn in which a group of filmmakers awaken a seductive version of Bloody Mary.\n* Ghost Killers vs. Bloody Mary, a 2018 Brazilian horror-comedy film about a group of ghost hunting YouTubers that are called by a school to calm down the students after Bloody Mary appears.\nStage\n* In 2008, for their annual \"Halloween Horror Nights\" event, Universal Studios Florida developed a new variation of the legend. In their version, \"Mary Agana\" was a doctor who studied fear by exposing her patients to it. But as time went on she became more and more twisted until she herself became the ghost Bloody Mary that twisted legend and lore into something dark and sinister.\nTelevision\n* A season two episode of Charmed (\"Chick Flick\") involves a demon who makes killers from different horror movies come to life. One of these killers is Bloody Mary.\n*  In the Ghost Whisperer TV series' third season, an episode (\"Don't Try This at Home\") involves the Bloody Mary legend.\n* Supernatural, the paranormal TV series, had an episode titled \"Bloody Mary\" during its first season, involving a ghost that attacked those who were looking into a mirror while her name was repeated, although she was only capable of \"leaping\" into mirrors within a certain range of the mirror that she killed herself in front of. In the course of the investigation, it is revealed that the original \"Bloody Mary\" was an aspiring actress named Mary Worthington (portrayed by Jovanna Burke) who was found dead in front of her mirror of an apparent suicide, but she wrote the first few letters of a name on the glass before she died. The detective responsible for investigating the case noted that Mary was said to be having an affair with a doctor named Trevor Sampson, speculating that he was the actual killer, but there was no actual evidence to prove that theory. Due to her death, Mary's ghost would only attack people who looked in a mirror while her name was being invoked if they had some secret relating to their role in the death of someone else, whether or not the person speaking the name was the person who had the secret. However, becoming a vengeful spirit corrupts Mary's judgement, with the result that she goes after people with any kind of secret relating to the death of someone else; as an example, one of her first victims was a man who killed his wife and made it look like a suicide, and another is a girl who killed a boy in a hit-and-run accident and never told anyone about it, but a later \"target\" is a girl whose obsessive boyfriend killed himself because she left him, even though in the last case the girl didn't actually kill her boyfriend herself. The Winchester brothers were able to defeat her by drawing her out of her mirror and then showing her her own reflection, causing her to 'judge' herself. In \"Moriah\" going into Season 15, Mary Worthington is among the condemned spirits in Hell that were unleashed on Earth by God as part of his attack on the brothers.\n* \"Syzygy\", an episode of The X-Files, concerns her legend.\n* The two-part season 1 finale of the horror anthology show The Haunting Hour: The Series is called \"Scary Mary\", and mirrors, much like the Bloody Mary tale, play a major role in the episode, as Mary and her minions transport themselves through them and she can talk through them. However, she is described as being vain, dying from being inside a burning farmhouse, and her spirit is a face-stealer, as all of her minions are girls who have given their faces to her.\n*Episode 2 of Gary and his Demons involves Bloody Mary as an informant who helps the demon hunter Gary to go after the latest mirror monster.\n*\"Jinxed\", an episode of Regular Show, involves a parody of Bloody Mary where Rigby, having been jinxed by Mordecai, locks himself in a dark bathroom, writes his name on the mirror and repeats his name three times to break the jinx. However, when he does so, a demonic version of himself appears and starts terrorizing the town. In order for the demon to go away, Rigby had to say his name in reverse three times.\n*The South Park episode \"Hell on Earth 2006\" sees Butters Stotch summoning the ghost of rapper Biggie Smalls by saying his name three times in front of the bathroom mirror with the lights off, a clear reference to Bloody Mary.\n*The American Horror Stories anthology (Season 2, episode 5,  Bloody Mary).
