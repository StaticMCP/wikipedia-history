Campbell became Premier in 1936 following the death of his predecessor Walter Lea. This election was the first to see a government re-elected to a second term since the 1915 election.\nThe Conservatives, led by former Premier William J.P. MacMillan were able to win back three districts and return an Official Opposition to Legislature. Following the lead of the federal Conservatives in 1942, the party changed its name to the \"Progressive Conservatives\" (or PCs), which remains the party's name today.\nParty standings\n{| style=\"width:55%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:#EA6D6A; width:90.00%;\" | 27\n| style=\"background:#9999FF; width:10.00%;\" | 3\n|-\n| Liberal\n| Conservative\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1935\n!Elected\n!Change\n!#\n!%\n!Change\n|Liberal\n|Thane Campbell\n! align=right|30\n! align=right|27\n| align=right|-3\n! align=right|40,201\n! align=right|53.0%\n| align=right|-4.9%\n|\n|William J.

This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district, while Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
