An advertisement for the platform was played multiple times throughout the show, which caused some uproar within viewers. Some said that the ads were promoting adult content to children, while others were criticizing the lack of age-verification on the platform.\nQTCinderella's boyfriend, Ludwig Ahgren, who had also taken Fansly sponsorships in the past, would respond to the controversy by stating \"I don't cater my content directly towards kids. I do a lot of gambling, I do a lot of drinking, I do a lot of swearing. I wouldn't say that if you're a kid, I'm necessarily a channel you should watch.\"\nIn the third edition of the awards, QTCinderella would reference the controversy in her opening monologue stating: \"Last year I was accused of selling porn to children after taking a Fansly sponsorship. So to avoid the same accusations this year, I had to turn down some sponsorships.\"\nNotes\nReferences"
