Created in 2017, the ward elects four councillors using the single transferable vote electoral system and covers an area with a population of 13,461 people.\nThe area has produced strong results for the Conservatives who have held at least half of the seats since the ward was created in 2017.\nBoundaries\nThe ward was created by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland following the Fifth Statutory Reviews of Electoral Arrangements ahead of the 2017 Scottish local elections. Five of the 13 multi-member wards in Dumfries and Galloway were abolished as a result of the review and replaced by four new ones. Mid Galloway and Wigtown West encompasses an area represented by the former Mid Galloway, Wigtown West and Dee wards. The ward takes in an area in the west of the council area from the boundaries with East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire to the Machars peninsula between Luce Bay and Wigtown Bay in the Irish Sea. It is situated within Galloway and takes in the western part of the historic county of Wigtownshire. The ward's name is a reference to the historic county and not the town of Wigtown which is wholly included within the ward. The ward also includes the towns of Newton Stewart, Creetown and Whithorn as well as villages including Castle Kennedy, Dunragit, Kirkcowan, Kirkinner, Whauphill, Port William and the Isle of Whithorn.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=8|Councillors\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|rowspan=3|David Inglis(Conservative)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|Graham Nicol(Conservative)\n|rowspan=3; style=\"background-color: \"|\n|rowspan=3|Katie Hagmann(SNP)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|Jim McColm(Ind.)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=2|Jackie McCamon(Conservative)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|Sandy Whitelaw(Labour)\n|-\n!2022by-election\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|Richard Marsh(Conservative)\n|}\nElection results\n2022 by-election\nSandy Whitelaw resigned after a few months for personal reasons.
