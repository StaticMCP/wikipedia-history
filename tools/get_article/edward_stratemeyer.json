Stratemeyer (; October 4, 1862&nbsp;– May 10, 1930) was an American publisher, writer of children's fiction and founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate. He is one of the most prolific writers in the world, having penned over 1,300 books and selling more than 500 million copies.\nStratemeyer created many well-known children's fiction book series, including The Rover Boys, The Bobbsey Twins, Tom Swift, The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew, many of which sold millions of copies and remain in publication. On his legacy, Fortune wrote: \"As oil had its Rockefeller, literature had its Stratemeyer.\"\nEarly life\nStratemeyer was born the youngest of six children in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to Henry Julius Stratemeyer, a tobacconist, and Anna Siegel. They were both from Hanover, Germany, immigrating to the United States in 1837. The siblings were educated in English and spoke it to each other.\nGrowing up, Stratemeyer read the works of Horatio Alger and William T. Adams, writers who penned rags-to-riches tales of the hardworking young American, which greatly influenced him.\nAs a teenager, Stratemeyer operated his own printing press in the basement of his father's tobacco shop, distributing flyers and pamphlets among his friends and family. These included stories called ''The Newsboy's Adventure and The Tale of a Lumberman''. After he graduated from high school, he went to work in his father's store. At the age of 26, he sold his first story, ''Victor Horton's Idea'', to the children's magazine Golden Days for $76, over six times the average 1888 weekly paycheck.\nCareer\nStratemeyer moved to Newark, New Jersey, in 1890 and opened a paper store. He ran his shop while continuing to write stories under pseudonyms. He was able to write for many genres including detective dime novels, westerns and serials that ran in newspapers.\nIn 1893, Stratemeyer hired the popular dime-novel writer Gilbert Patten, according to Patten's own autobiography, ''Frank Merriwell's 'Father': An Autobiography by Gilbert Patten (Burt L. Standish)'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1964). Patten writes that he did not like Stratemeyer. (A less-reliable source says that Stratemeyer was hired by Patten to write as an editor for the Street & Smith publication Good News.)\nIn 1894, he published his first full-length book, ''Richard Dare's Venture, which was the first in his Bound to Succeed'' series. It contained autobiographical content and was similar to Alger's rags-to-riches story formula.\nIn 1899, Horatio Alger wrote Stratemeyer as editor of the Good News, asking him to finish one of his manuscripts. Alger was in poor health at the time. When Alger died later the same year, Stratemeyer continued to edit and finish several of Alger's other books. That same year, after Alger died, Stratemeyer wrote and published The Rover Boys, which became a tremendously popular series in the vein of the classic dime novel. The Rover Boys was described as \"The first highly successful series by Edward Stratemeyer; each volume had a preface from Edward Stratemeyer himself, thanking his readers and touting the other books. It's generally accepted that Stratemeyer wrote all of the books.\" He said this series was his personal favorite.\nStratemeyer formed the Stratemeyer Syndicate in 1905 and hired journalists to write stories based on his ideas. He paid them a flat rate for each book and kept the copyrights to the novels.\nPersonal life\nStratemeyer married Magdalena Van Camp, the daughter of a Newark businessman, on March 25, 1891. The couple had two daughters: Harriet Stratemeyer Adams (1892–1982) and Edna C. Squier (1895–1974), both of whom would later take over the future Stratemeyer Syndicate.\nStratemeyer enjoyed the outdoors and often took annual summer trips to the Great Lakes, Lake George and Lake Champlain with his family. They traveled as far as the west coast and Yosemite.  A humble man, he never sought public attention and preferred living a private and quiet life with his family at their home on N. 7th Street in the Roseville section of Newark. His relationships with his daughters were warm and Harriet recalled a lively atmosphere growing up.\nStratemeyer was a member of the Roseville Athletic Club and the New Jersey Historical Association.\nStratemeyer died at age 67 in Newark, New Jersey on May 10, 1930, of lobar pneumonia and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Hillside, New Jersey. On May 12, 1930, two days after his death, the New York Times reported that his Rover Boys series \"had sales exceeding 5,000,000 copies\".\nAccomplishments\nStratemeyer pioneered the book-packaging technique of producing a consistent, long-running series of books using a team of freelance writers. All of the books in the series used the same characters in similar situations. All of the freelance writers, including Mildred Benson, who developed the character of Nancy Drew, were published under a pen name owned by his company.\nThrough his Stratemeyer Syndicate, founded in 1906, Stratemeyer employed a massive number of editors, copy writers, stenographers, cowriters and secretaries. They greatly contributed to a new genre of juvenile fiction and helped launch several series, including\n* (1899) The Rover Boys\n* (1904) The Bobbsey Twins\n* (1905) Dave Porter\n* (1910) Tom Swift\n* (1912) Baseball Joe\n* (1927) The Hardy Boys\n* (1930) Nancy Drew\n* (1934) The Dana Girls\nFictional depictions\nEdward Stratemeyer appears in the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. In the series, Stratemeyer is the father of the fictional Nancy Stratemeyer, who dates Indiana Jones in high school. Indiana is a  fan of Tom Swift and gives Stratemeyer advice for one of his stories.\nSee also\n* List of children's literature authors\n* List of people from New Jersey\n* List of people from New York City\n* List of publishers\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Loh, Sandra Tsing (October 2005).
