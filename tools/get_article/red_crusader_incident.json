Instead of heading towards Tórshavn, as instructed by Niels Ebbesen, Red Crusader headed for Scotland. The frigate pursued the trawler, and fired warning shots to no avail. Niels Ebbesen then fired an aimed shot, damaging Red Crusader. The commander of the frigate was E. Sølling and the captain of the trawler was a Mr. Wood.\nCommission\nOn 15 November 1961, the British and Danish governments established an adversarial international commission of inquiry into the incident under the auspices of the Permanent Court of Arbitration. This was the first international commission since the Tavignano inquiry in 1922.\nProceedings were divided into a written and an oral stage.\nThe commission delivered its report in March 1962 and found no evidence of illegal fishing. Further, the commission found that the Niels Ebbesen had used excessive force, beyond that justified by international law in firing on the trawler.\nSee also\n* Cod Wars, a series of fishing disputes between the United Kingdom and Iceland in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
