The West Derby Leyfield ward was created as a single-member ward from parts of the former Knotty Ash, West Derby, and Yew Tree wards.\nThe ward boundaries follow Town Row, Leyfield Road, Yew Tree Road, behind St Vincent's School, around but not including Stanier Close, behind Kingsheath Avenue, East Prescot Road and Eaton Road. The ward is part of the West Derby district of Liverpool, and includes Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School, Broughton Hall High School and the Zoe's Place Baby Hospice.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
