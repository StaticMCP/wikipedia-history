The cemetery is approximately 0.3 hectares in size. The Kemmel Number 1 French Cemetery, also a First World War burial ground assigned to the United Kingdom, is located approximately 50 m to the east.\nFoundation\nThe cemetery was founded in January 1917 by fighting units and field ambulances.\nIt was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Within the cemetery is a Cross of Sacrifice.\nIt was used after the Armistice to concentrate battlefield burials from Ferme Henri Pattyn Vanlaeres and Mont-Vidaigne Military cemeteries. An American soldier was buried here, but his body was later moved to Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery.\nAmong those buried here is the children's writer L. A. Hayter.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid=2159893 Klein-Vierstraat British Cemetery] at Find a Grave"
