Following years may have nominations but as per of first ceremony only solo win and solo nomination was being made. The year shown is the one in which the film first released; normally this is also the year before the ceremony at which the award is given; for example, a film exhibited theatrically during 2005 was eligible for consideration for the 2005 Best Film ARY Awards, awarded in 2006. The number of the ceremony (1st, 2nd, etc.) appears in parentheses after the awards year, linked to the article on that ceremony/ Each individual entry shows the title followed by the production company, and the producer. Till from 2013, the Best Drama Serial award has given to producer rather than to Production company.\nAs of the first ceremony, only one winner was announced during the ceremony which was Jury decision based winner. This category is among four Jury Awards in ARY Film Awards that has only one win and one nomination.\nFor the first ceremony, the eligibility period spanned full calendar years.
