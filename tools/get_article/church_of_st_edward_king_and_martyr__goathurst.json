The dedication to Edward the Martyr is unusual; Edward was a young Saxon king who was murdered by his stepmother Elfrida in 978 at Corfe Castle in Dorset so that her own son would become king.\nThe church includes a 19th-century monument to three-year-old Isabella Kemeys, showing the child lying on a pillow holding a broken flower, and monuments to the Kemeys-Tynte family of Halswell House.\nSee also\n* List of Grade I listed buildings in Sedgemoor\n* List of towers in Somerset\n* List of ecclesiastical parishes in the Diocese of Bath and Wells\nReferences"
