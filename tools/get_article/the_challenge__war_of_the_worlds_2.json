This season features alumni from The Real World, The Challenge, Are You the One?, Big Brother, Celebrity Big Brother UK, Love Island UK, Survivor Turkey, American Ninja Warrior, Vanderpump Rules, Geordie Shore, Ex on the Beach (U.S. and UK), Shipwrecked, Survival of the Fittest, and BKCHAT LDN competing for a share at a $1 million prize. The season premiered on August 28, 2019 and concluded its run on December 18 of the same year with a two-hour reunion special.\nFormat\nFor War of the Worlds 2 the players are divided into two teams (Team USA and Team UK) with teams initially based on the participants' respective home country. The main elements of the game are as follows.\n*Daily Missions: Each round the teams compete in the daily challenge. The winning team gains the power to elect the speaker of the Tribunal among themselves, the speaker then selects two other teammates (one male and one female) to form the Tribunal, while the losing team must participate in Nominations.\n*Nominations: Following the daily challenge, the players from the losing team must nominate one player of the designated gender to compete in the elimination round. The team is given a chance to discuss the nominations, with players allowed to name potential nominees before voting between them publicly.\n*Tribunal: Each round a Tribunal consisting of three players from the winning team of the daily challenge is formed. The Tribunal players are the only players completely safe from entering the elimination. No player is allowed to be part of two consecutive Tribunals. The Tribunal witnesses the Nominations and then interrogates the Losing Team's nominee.\n*Eliminations (The Proving Ground): At \"The Proving Ground\", the members of the Tribunal each vote for the second player to enter the Proving Ground - this nominee may come from either team. The two nominees then must face each other in the Proving Ground. The loser is eliminated from the game while the winner stays in the game and is given the opportunity to change allegiance and swap team. However, once a player swaps, they may not swap back.\nAt the end of the game, those who remained competed in their teams in the Final Challenge. A Purge was held during the Final Challenge, leaving only 4 players from each team to compete for the Grand Prize. The winning team equally split the $1,000,000 grand prize.\nTwists\n*The Reinforcements: Four Reinforcements (Chris \"CT\" Tamburello, Dee Nguyen, Natalie \"Ninja\" Duran, and Turabi \"Turbo\" Çamkıran) arrived following the first challenge. The winning team of the first daily challenge will have first picks on one male and one female to join their team, with the remaining players joining the losing team.\n*Double Elimination: Episode 8 featured a Double Elimination Round in which both a male and a female player were eliminated. The losing team had to nominate a male and female player, and the Tribunal also nominate a male and female player.\n*Purge:  Some challenges are designated as a Purge challenge - sudden death challenges where the losers are immediately eliminated.\n** The \"Puzzling Swim\" daily challenge was a Purge challenge. The slowest pairing in the swimming portion of the challenge was instantly eliminated.\n**  As the final leg of the Final Challenge only allowed for four members on each team, the players competed in a mid-final purge to narrow each team to four players.\n* Instant Elimination: Following the \"Mine The Cart\" challenge, the players participated in instant nominations for an Elimination Round to be held immediately following the challenge.\nContestants\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n!Male contestants!!Original season!!Finish\n|-\n|Chris \"CT\" Tamburello\n|The Real World: Paris\n|Winner\n|-\n|Jordan Wiseley\n|The Real World: Portland\n|Winner\n|-\n|Rogan O'Connor\n|Ex on the Beach UK 2\n|Winner\n|-\n|Paulie Calafiore\n|Big Brother 18\n|Runner-up\n|-\n|Zach Nichols\n|The Real World: San Diego (2011)\n|Runner-up\n|-\n|Leroy Garrett\n|The Real World: Las Vegas (2011)\n|Finalist\n|-\n|Josh Martinez\n|Big Brother 19\n|Episode 13\n|-\n|Joss Mooney\n|Ex on the Beach UK 1\n|Episode 13\n|-\n|Theo Campbell\n|Love Island UK 3\n|Episode 11\n|-\n|Turabi \"Turbo\" Çamkıran\n|Survivor Turkey 8\n|Episode 10\n|-\n|Idris Virgo\n|Love Island UK 4\n|Episode 9\n|-\n|Kyle Christie\n|Geordie Shore 8\n|Episode 8\n|-\n|Stephen Bear\n|Celebrity Big Brother UK 18\n|Episode 7\n|-\n|Johnny \"Bananas\" Devenanzio\n|The Real World: Key West\n|Episode 5\n|-\n|Wes Bergmann\n|The Real World: Austin\n|Episode 3\n|-\n|Sean Lineker\n|nowrap|Shipwrecked: Battle of the Islands\n|Episode 1\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n!Female contestants!!Original season!!Finish\n|-\n|Dee Nguyen\n|Geordie Shore 17\n|Winner\n|-\n|Cara Maria Sorbello\n|The Challenge: Fresh Meat II\n|Runner-up\n|-\n|Natalie \"Ninja\" Duran\n|American Ninja Warrior 8\n|Runner-up\n|-\n|Ashley Mitchell\n|Real World: Ex-Plosion\n|Finalist\n|-\n|Kam Williams\n|Are You the One? 5\n|Finalist\n|-\n|Tori Deal\n|Are You the One? 4\n|Finalist\n|-\n|Nany Gonzalez\n|The Real World: Las Vegas (2011)\n|Episode 14\n|-\n|Kayleigh Morris\n|Ex on the Beach UK 2\n|Episode 13\n|-\n|Jennifer \"Jenny\" West\n|Survival of the Fittest\n|Episode 12\n|-\n|Georgia Harrison\n|Love Island UK 3\n|Episode 10\n|-\n|Esther Falana\n|BKCHAT LDN\n|Episode 8\n|-\n|Nicole Bass\n|Ex on the Beach UK 6\n|Episode 6\n|-\n|Laurel Stucky\n|The Challenge: Fresh Meat II\n|Episode 4\n|-\n|Tula \"Big T\" Fazakerley\n|Shipwrecked: Battle of the Islands\n|Episode 2\n|-\n|Faith Stowers\n|Vanderpump Rules\n|Episode 2\n|-\n|Zahida Allen\n|Ex on the Beach UK 6\n|Episode 2\n|}\n|}\nGameplay\nChallenge games\n*Trench Warfare: Teams must race through a hallway, grab their national flag at the opposite end, reach the other side of their sandbag walls and plant the flags.
