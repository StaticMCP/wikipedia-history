Ward played in all seven games played by Albany during the 2008 Calder Cup playoffs, including the longest game in AHL history which occurred on April 24, 2008 during game five of the East Division Semifinals against the Philadelphia Phantoms, which continued 2:58 into the fifth overtime period before Philadelphia scored to end the marathon game.\nWard went on to play seven seasons of professional hockey in North America, including 55 regular-season and playoff games in the AHL, and 372 regular-season and playoff games in the ECHL. From 2010 to 2013, Ward played with the Alaska Aces, helping his team capture the Brabham Cup three times as the ECHL regular-season champion, and also winning the 2011 Kelly Cup in as the ECHL playoff champions.\nFollowing the 2013–14 spent with the Brampton Beast of the Central Hockey League, Ward signed with the Nottingham Panthers to play the 2014–15 season in the Elite Ice Hockey League. However, due to health issues that flared up before his first training camp in the EIHL, he was forced to retire from professional hockey.\nCareer statistics\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
