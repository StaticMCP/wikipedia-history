He was earlier expected to withdraw and endorse Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani after he registered, but he returned to the race after Hashemi's disqualification. The symbol of Rouhani's campaign was a key and his slogan was \"Government of Prudence and Hope.\" On 15 June, he was elected as the president with 18,613,329 votes.\nCampaign staff and policy team\n*Mohammadreza Nematzadeh, Campaign chair.

He admitted with proper planning, production units can be activated and jobs can be created, but this needs stability because sometimes economic regulations of the country have changed 50 times in a single month.\nNuclear program\nRohani defended his track record as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator from October 2003 to August 2005. He said he moved war, sanctions, and the UN Security Council (resolutions) away from Iran. About his view on nuclear program and its relationship with economical problems due to sanctions he said:\nRouhani has pledged more transparency about what he says is Iran's peaceful nuclear enrichment program, aimed at producing fuel for nuclear reactors to generate electricity. He told Alsharq Alawsat:\n}}\n}}\nDiplomacy with the United States\nHassan Rouhani promised more effective diplomacy with the West. Rouhani said, in Asharq Al-Awsat:\nTreatment of Political Prisoners\nRouhani has promised to attempt to heal the severe rift between Green Movement liberals and Khomeinist hard liners by getting Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, leaders of the 2009 protest movement, released from house arrest. He said\n\"I was Iran’s national Security Advisor for sixteen years during the administrations of Rafsanjani and Khatami. Therefore, I know how to deal with sensitive issues. If elected, I will do my best to secure the release of those who have been incarcerated following the regrettable events of 2009. I know that the constitutional powers of the president in Iran do not extend to the areas outside the realm of the executive branch of the system. However, I am quite optimistic that I can muster the necessary domestic consensus to improve the present situation of Mr. Mousavi and Mr. Karrubi.\"\nDisqualification rumors\nAs Mehr news agency reported Rouhani might get disqualified prior to the upcoming presidential elections. The news agency announced that an anonymous source had told it that the reasoning of a possible disqualification was the disclosure of confidential information related to Iran's nuclear program during the televised debates. Another reason for a possible disqualification of Rouhani was the slogans that his supporters chanted, according to the source. The disqualification was thereafter denied by the Guardian Council.\nConsensus of Reformists for Rouhani\n}}\nThree days before the presidential election, Iranian moderates and reformists coalesced behind Hassan Rouhani; Including Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Molavi Abdul Hamid. This Consensus happened after the withdrawal of the only reformist candidate Mohammad Reza Aref. Aref withdrew on the advice of Mohammad Khatami so the electorate would all stand behind Rouhani, so there wouldn't be a split in the vote between the two\nand to greatly limit the chance of a conservative victory. This showed that the moderates and reformists had united together and had thrown all their support behind Rouhani, which the conservatives failed to do with a single conservative candidate.\nObservers views on candidacy\n]]\n*Nader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver:\n*Farideh Farhi, Iran expert at the University of Hawaii:\nEndorsements\n* Moderation and Development Party\n* Association of Combatant Clerics\n* Islamic Iran Participation Front\n* Coordination Council for the Reformist Front\n* Assembly of Qom Seminary Scholars and Researchers\n* Executives of Construction Party\n* Freedom Movement\n* Labour Coalition\n* Democracy Party\n* Nationalist-Religious movement\n* Iranian Call and Reform Organization\n* Mohammad Khatami\n* Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani\n* Ali Motahari\n* Ahmad Montazeri\n* Mohsen Hashemi Rafsanjani\n* Yousef Saanei\n* Mohammad-Reza Aref\n* Hassan Khomeini\n* Hadi Khamenei\n* Gholamhossein Karbaschi\n* Mostafa Malekian\n* Mostafa Tajzadeh\n* Mostafa Moin\n* Ali Akbar Nategh Nouri\n* Asadollah Bayat-Zanjani\n* Mohammad-Reza Khatami\n* Ali Mohammad Dastgheib Shirazi\n* Mohammad Shariatmadari\n* Pegah Ahangarani\n* Abdolhossein Mokhtabad\n* Bahareh Rahnama\n* Jafar Towfighi\n* Peyman Ghasem Khani\n* Shahram Nazeri\n* Elaheh Koulaei\n* Masoumeh Ebtekar\n* Ghodratollah Alikhani\n* Hassan Ghafourifard\n* Eshaq Jahangiri\n* Mostafa Moeen\n* Ahmad Khorram\n* Behdad Salimi\n* Sahar Dolatshahi\n* Amir Jafari\n* Reza Kianian\n* Mostafa Tajzadeh\n* Tannaz Tabatabaei\n* Masoud Jafari Jozani\n* Leyli Rashidi\n* Arya Aramnejad\n* Arash Sadeghi\n* Mohsen Mirdamadi\n* Majid Barzegar\n* Saeed Laylaz\n* Hesameddin Seraj\n* Mohammad Sattarifar\n* Abbas Abdi\n* Habibollah Peyman\n* Mohsen Safaei Farahani\n* Abdollah Ramezanzadeh\nSee also\n* Hassan Rouhani 2017 presidential campaign\n* Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani 2013 presidential campaign\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130607053004/http://www.davataz.ir/fa/page/index Official campaign website]"
