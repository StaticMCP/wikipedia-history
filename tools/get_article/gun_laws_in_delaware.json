While deadly force is allowed, it is only to be used when all other options have been exhausted, and the person feels they are in immediate danger.

This takes effect on November 16, 2025. Buyers must be at least 18 years old to purchase shotguns; muzzle-loading rifles; and deadly weapons other than firearms, and 21 years old for handguns and rifles. 18-20-year-olds who are either a member of the armed forces, are a qualified law enforcement officer, or hold a concealed-carry permit are exempt from the general ban on the purchase of handguns and rifles.\nDelaware was voted the 5th easiest state to purchase a gun. There are about 5.6 registered gun owners per 1000 people in the state of Delaware, and over 1000 firearms dealers within the state. There are also gun shows that allow you to buy antique guns, and guns that are not currently being made or are rare.\nFirearm definition\nDelaware law classifies a \"firearm\" as any weapon from which a shot, projectile, or other object may be discharged by force of combustion, explosive, gas, and/or mechanical means, whether operable or inoperable, loaded or unloaded. It does not include BB guns.\nHandguns and long guns (other than shotguns)\nThe basic requirements to purchase a handgun or a non-shotgun long-gun are as follows: Buyers must be 21 or older, possess a state-registered ID, and pass a Federal background check. 18-20-year-olds who are either a member of the armed forces, are a qualified law enforcement officer, or hold a concealed-carry permit are exempt from the general ban on the purchase of handguns and rifles.\nShotguns\nThe basic requirements to purchase a shotgun are as follows: Buyers must be 18 years or older, possess a state-registered ID, and pass a Federal background check.\nRestrictions and requirements\nIndividuals that are barred from possessing firearms are those who have felony convictions. This also extends to misdemeanor violent offenses, along with all convictions that include narcotics and controlled substances. Another restriction that prevents people from obtaining firearms is if you have a mental instability or a mental illness. A background check is not needed to buy antique guns.\nBackground checks\nDelaware requires a background check for all transfers of firearms to private citizens.\n:§ 1448B. Criminal history record checks for sales of firearms – unlicensed persons.\n::(a) No unlicensed person shall sell or transfer any firearm, as defined in § 222 of this title, to any other unlicensed person without having conducted a criminal history background check through a licensed firearms dealer in accordance with § 1448A of this title and 24 Del.C. § 904A, as the same may be amended from time to time, to determine whether the sale or transfer would be in violation of federal or state law.\nAn adult-record check is also required. In 2016, the Delaware General Assembly passed legislation that required all gun purchasers to have a federal background check, however, if the government takes more than 3 days for the check the seller of the firearm is allowed to go forward with the sale.  In the state of Delaware, people are permitted to buy a shotgun with a background check being sent to the firearm dealer. The average cost of a state background check in Delaware is $52.\nExtreme risk protection order\nIf the patient of a mental health professional makes an explicit or imminent threat to kill or injure someone, the professional must report this to the police.  If the police verify that the person is a risk to themselves or to others, they may get an order from a judge to seize the person's firearms for up to 30 days. The Delaware Department of Justice can request that this period be extended.\nConcealed carry\nTo be able to carry a concealed weapon you must first have a CDW permit. In order to get this permit, you must publish your full name, address, and intention apply for a permit in a local newspaper, at least 10 days before filing. You must then obtain and attach an affidavit which shows that the publication was met. After that you must also submit 5 reference questionnaires completed by citizens of the county in which you reside. Lastly, you must have the application notarized. If denied for your application you are allowed to appeal. If accepted you will have 90 days to complete the approved gun course, only then will you be allowed to carry a concealed weapon. After your first three years you will need to reapply for your permit. If you are granted another permit this one will now last for five years, not three. Delaware permits are honored in 28 states. Open carry is allowed without a permit.\nRestricted areas\nLegal gun owners can bring their firearms almost anywhere in the state of Delaware. Gun owners are legally allowed to openly carry handguns in the state without a permit. The only places where firearms are prohibited by law are courthouses, police stations, and a few additional areas. Public parks were prohibited area until the state Supreme Court found their inclusion unconstitutional and prohibited enforcement of a carry ban on state park lands. Shortly thereafter, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control and Department of Agriculture promulgated regulations to forbid carrying a firearm without a permit in several places including camping areas and lodges, exempting permit holders if they show their permits when asked without probable cause. The Superior Court found these to be unconstitutional as well.\nReferences"
