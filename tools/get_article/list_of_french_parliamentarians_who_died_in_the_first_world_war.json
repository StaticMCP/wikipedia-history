Some 1,400,000 French men, including colonial soldiers, were killed in the war during the conflict.\nThe political regime in France was that of the Third Republic, and Raymond Poincaré (Democratic Republican Alliance) was  President of the Republic in 1913, indirectly by the National Assembly. Legislative elections were held in April and May 1914, producing the center-left coalition  led by Prime Minister René Viviani (Republican-Socialist Party). On 26 August, due to the war, René Viviani took over the leadership of a new government, the Sacred Union, in which all parties participated.\nEnlisted in the armed forces or as civilians, sixteen members of the Chamber of Deputies and one senator were killed in the war and recognized as having died for their country. In addition, two senators died after being held hostage by German forces. The following is the list of them:\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Name\n! scope=\"col\" |Parliamentarian\n(dates)\n!Party\n!Regiment\n!Date of birth\n!Death\n!Notes\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |\n|\n|Deputy of Ain since April 1910.\n|\n|Second lieutenant in the\n|31 August 1875\n|25 August 1914, at the age of 38.
