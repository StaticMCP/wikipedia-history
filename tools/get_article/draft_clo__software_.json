The software is used by a majority of fashion businesses and digital costume designers. It creates digital clothing on a virtual model, changes the model's proportions, and displays how the clothes flow as the model moves. Then, it can create a pattern from the digital design for clothing manufacturers. There is also a market for selling CLO designs, tools for managing manufacturing, and other services.\nCLO Virtual Fashion was founded by its two co-CEOs, computer programmer Seungwoo Oh and venture capitalist Bu Jeong-hyeok, in 2009. At the time, Oh was working on digital clothing design at the KAIST Department of Computer Science in Korea. Initially, the software was developed for designing clothes for video games, but over time it was adopted by fashion designers. The company acquired India-based fashion consulting firm GoVise Technologies in 2022. Epic Games and CLO both purchased equity in each other in 2023. It had three rounds of venture capital funding, including a 50 billion won series C funding in 2024. As of 2024, CLO Virtual Fashion has 14 offices and 400 employees. CLO Virtual Fashion also develops Marvelous Designer, for designing clothes in video games and movies, as well as Jinny, a 3D fashion design tool for non-professionals.\nFurther reading\n* [https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/at-clo-virtual-fashion-digitising-the-design-process-to-drive-transformation/ Q&A Interview]\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
