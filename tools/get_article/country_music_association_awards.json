The televised annual presentation ceremony features performances and award presentations by popular country music artists, with occasional appearances from pop and rock artists. The CMA Awards were first presented in 1967, and televised for the first time the following year.\nHistory\nThe first CMA awards were presented at an untelevised ceremony at the Nashville Municipal Auditorium on October 20, 1967; the Entertainer of the Year award went to Eddy Arnold that night. The second annual CMA awards were presented in October 1968; NBC taped the ceremony and televised it a few weeks later. Since then, the awards have been televised live, usually in October or November, by NBC from 1969 through 1971, by CBS from 1972 through 2005, and by ABC beginning in 2006. Starting in 1968 they were held at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry (initially at Ryman Auditorium, and from 1974 through 2004 at the new Grand Ole Opry House).\nIn 2005, the awards show was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Since 2006, they have been held at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 54th CMA Awards were held at Nashville's Music City Center.\nSince 2024, the ceremony has been held on the third Wednesday of November. From 2017-2023, it was held on the second Wednesday of November. Prior to 2017, the awards were generally held on the first Wednesday of November.  However, since then the awards have been rescheduled for later in the month to avoid conflict with a possible game seven of Major League Baseball's World Series, since the 2016 ceremony aired the same night as Fox’s eventual telecast of game seven of the 2016 Series, which beat the CMA Awards in the ratings..]]In June 2021, the Country Music Association announced that they would extend its broadcast contract with ABC through 2026.\nFollowing the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Country Music Association announced that the 55th CMA Awards on November 10, 2021, would require ticketed audience members to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and to wear appropriate face coverings.\nEligibility and voting\nAlbums and songs released between July 1 of the previous calendar year and June 30 of the award show's year are eligible for consideration. More than 7,300 individuals from the Country Music Association trade group vote for the nominees and winners through three rounds of balloting.\nAwards\nAnnual awards are given in the following twelve categories: Entertainer, Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, New Artist (previously known as the Horizon Award until 2008), Vocal Group, Vocal Duo (introduced in 1970), Single, Album, Song, Musical Event (split off from the Vocal Duo award in 1988 as Vocal Event), Music Video (introduced in 1985), and Musician. The distinction between the Duo and Event awards is that the former is presented to two artists who normally perform together, while the latter was specifically created to honor one-off collaborations. Nine awards are also given to radio broadcasters for Station of the Year and Personality of the Year (divided into four categories each, based on market size), as well as National Personality of the Year to the host of a nationally syndicated show. Since 2012, the ceremony features a Lifetime Achievement Award. Vince Gill, and Alan Jackson are the only individuals to win Entertainer of the Year, Male/Female Vocalist of the Year or Group/Duo of the Year, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year all in the same year.\nCategories\n*Entertainer of the Year\n*Male Vocalist of the Year\n*Female Vocalist of the Year\n*Vocal Group of the Year\n*Vocal Duo of the Year\n*New Artist of the Year\n*Musician of the Year\n*Album of the Year\n*Single of the Year\n*Song of the Year\n*Musical Event of the Year\n*Video of the Year\n*International Achievement Award\nDefunct categories\n*Comedian of the Year (1967–1970)\n*Instrumental Group of the Year (1967–1986)\nIndustry Honors\n*Award of Excellence\n*Humanitarian Award\n*J.

When he saw that John Denver had been chosen, Rich pulled out his lighter and burned the envelope, sarcastically declaring that the winner was \"my friend, Mr. John Denver\". Many saw Rich's actions as a protest towards pop artists crossing over into country music and it remains one of the most discussed moments in CMA history.\nKathy Mattea's AIDS speech\nDuring a time when the rest of the entertainment industry were wearing red ribbons to signify solidarity and promote awareness of the AIDS epidemic, in an attempt to steer clear of controversy, the CMA instead encouraged guests to wear green ribbons to signify environmental awareness. This did not sit well with Kathy Mattea, who had lost several friends to the disease, and she requested the CMA's help in drafting a short speech on the issue, but they ignored her request and she took matters into her own hands. At the 1992 ceremony while presenting an award, Mattea wore three red ribbons and one green ribbon and announced the names of her friends who had succumbed to AIDS and delivered an impassioned speech that created a discussion and elevated AIDS awareness among the Nashville community. Mattea went on to become a staunch advocate for the cause, releasing the album Red Hot + Country two years later to raise funds for AIDS charities.\nAlan Jackson's 1999 performance\nOn May 8, 1999, George Jones released \"Choices\", a song written by Mike Curtis and Billy Yates, that featured an accompanying music video which depicted his struggles with substance abuse. The song subsequently became a Top 30 hit for Jones and was nominated for Single of the Year at the 1999 CMA Awards, with the CMA inviting him to perform a shortened version at the ceremony. Jones felt insulted that the CMA requested he remove part of the song and declined the invitation. Alan Jackson, who was slated to perform his current single \"Pop a Top\", was offended that the CMA had denied Jones the opportunity to sing the full song, and so during his performance, he stopped his own band mid-song and proceeded to sing the chorus of \"Choices\", which went on to earn a standing ovation from the audience.\nBeyoncé 50th anniversary performance\nAt the 50th CMA Awards in 2016, Beyoncé, along with The Chicks, performed a medley of \"Daddy Lessons\" from her 2016 Lemonade album and The Chicks’ 2002 hit \"Long Time Gone\". While many viewers and critics praised the performance, it garnered criticism from some country traditionalists, who stated that Beyoncé, a pop/R&B artist, had no place at a country music awards show. The comments polarized opinions, with some noting that they could be seen as a racist attack, as previous collaborations with non-country artists had not received the same amount of criticism and some suggesting that old grudges against the Chicks had fueled the extreme responses to their performance, after their first performance since their comments about George Bush resulted in them being blacklisted from the industry. Many artists including Dierks Bentley and Karen Fairchild defended the performance while others did not, including Alan Jackson who reportedly left the arena.\nAccusations of bias against black artists\nOver the years numerous publications, websites, and magazine on country music have accused the association of discriminating African-American country artists, and particularly black female artists in the selection of nominations and award winners. Through the years US nonprofit civil rights organization Color of Change president Rashad Robinson has accused the ceremony of not recognizing African American country musicians and the history of the genre. At the 58th CMA Awards, the nominating committee was accused of purposefully snubbing Beyoncé's eighth studio album, Cowboy Carter, as well as the lead single, \"Texas Hold 'Em\", even though it’s not clear if any of her works were submitted to the nominating committee that year.\nSee also\n* Inductees of the Country Music Hall of Fame\n* CMA Music Festival, a CMA-produced summer event which is part of the CMA broadcast contract with ABC\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cmaawards.com Official site]\n* [https://sites.google.com/view/cmaawards2023agrandcelebration/home CMA Awards 2023: A Grand Celebration of Country Music Excellence]"
