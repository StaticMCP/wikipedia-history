It is the first album to feature new drummer Michael Jerome following the departure of former drummer Travis McNabb in February 2009 after 13 years with Better Than Ezra. Album art and packaging were designed by Lorin Brown at [http://oneanddonestudio.com One & Done Studio].\nSongs\nBetter Than Ezra vocalist Kevin Griffin co-wrote nine of the twelve songs on Paper Empire. Griffin co-wrote four songs with songwriter busbee, who also wrote the Rascal Flatts single \"Summer Nights\". The track \"Hey Love\" was co-written by Griffin and country music songwriter Monty Powell.\n\"Absolutely Still\", the album's first single, was co-written with Val Emmich, whose version of the song appears on the Emmich's album \"Sunlight Searchparty\". However, Emmich departed his label, Epic Records, before \"Sunlight Searchparty\" was released. Griffin decided that \"Absolutely Still\" had potential and re-recorded it with Better Than Ezra for the album.\n\"Just One Day\" and \"Fit\" were also co-written with singer-songwriter Jeremy Lister. Lister's versions of the songs appear on his 2007 debut album, Just One Day EP, released by Warner Bros. Records.\nThe track \"All In\" was written by James Bourne, a former member of the guitar-pop band Busted (which also performs back-up vocals on the track).\nTrack listing\nAll lyrics and music by Kevin Griffin, except where noted.\nPersonnel\n* Kevin Griffin – Guitar, Piano, Vocals\n* Tom Drummond – Bass\n* Michael Jerome – Drums\n* Tim Palmer – Mixing\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.betterthanezra.com/ Better Than Ezra official website]\n* Better Than Ezra Wiki\n* [http://oneanddonestudio.com One & Done Studio]"
