One of the Pilkington Report's main conclusions was that the British public did not want commercial radio broadcasting, and it offered criticism of the existing commercial television licensees.\nPilkington Committee\nThe members were:\n*Sir Harry Pilkington\n*Harold Collison\n*Elwyn Davies\n*Joyce Grenfell\n*Richard Hoggart\n*E. P. Hudson\n*J. S. Shields\n*R. L. Smith-Rose\n*Elizabeth Whitley\n*W. A. Wright\n*Professor F. H. Newark (from March 1961)\n*John Megaw (resigned 5 January 1961)\n*Peter Hall (resigned 27 January 1961)\n*Sir Jock Campbell (resigned 2 February 1961)\nPilkington Report\nFor consideration\n* renewal of the BBC Charter;\n* licence fee funding;\n* extending radio hours;\n* adult education broadcasting;\n* a third television channel;\n* colour television on 625 lines;\n* local broadcasting; and\n* better commercial television regulation.\nTelevision conclusions\nThe report, published on 27 June 1962, recommended the introduction of colour television licences and that Britain's third national television channel (after the BBC Television Service and ITV) should be awarded to the BBC. BBC2 was launched two years later. It also criticised the populism of ITV by attacking its American-originated acquired programming such as Westerns and crime series.\nThe committee recommended that the Independent Television Authority (ITA) should plan programming and sell advertising while the television programme companies should sell programmes to the ITA and not receive advertising money.\nThe report suggested that press interest in television programming companies should be reduced. This impacted newspaper groups with television interests, including Thomson Organization, Associated Newspapers and the Daily Mirror.\nThe report recommended the introduction of 625 lines television transmission without delay to replace the UK's 405-line television system.\nRadio conclusions\nThe report recommended that the BBC should extend its activities to the creation of local radio stations in order to prevent the introduction of commercial radio.\nConsequences\nAfter the report, ITV increased to 37% its programs that ITA classified as \"serious\".\nIn deciding that the British public did not want commercial radio, it rejected requests for licences that were being sought by over 100 British registered commercial radio companies. Its immediate result was historic in nature because it inspired both the creation of a trade lobby group for commercial radio, and the establishment of ship-based pirate radio stations operating in international waters outside the jurisdiction of the British government. The best known of these was Radio Caroline whose transmissions began in 1964.\nReferences"
