Pearson Award, is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's most outstanding player in the regular season as judged by the members of the NHL Players' Association. First awarded in 1971, it is a companion to the Hart Memorial Trophy, which is awarded to the League's Most Valuable Player, as judged by members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association. The award was renamed in 2010 after Ted Lindsay of the Detroit Red Wings.\nHistory\nThe award was first handed out at the conclusion of the 1970–71 NHL season. It was named in honour of Lester B. Pearson, who was Prime Minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968, the recipient of the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize, and a former player and coach for the University of Toronto Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team.\nOn April 29, 2010, the National Hockey League Players' Association announced that the award would be reintroduced as the Ted Lindsay Award to honor Hall of Famer Ted Lindsay for his skill, tenacity, leadership, and role in establishing the original Players' Association.  The voting for the trophy is conducted at the end of the regular season by the members of the NHL Players Association.\nWayne Gretzky won the award five times during his career. Members of the Edmonton Oilers have won the award 11 times, while members of the Pittsburgh Penguins won the award ten times. The Lindsay Award is considered to be the companion of the Hart Memorial Trophy—the trophies have been won by the same player for the same season 35 times (of the 52 seasons both have been awarded) by 22 players: Bobby Clarke, Phil Esposito, Guy Lafleur (x2), Gretzky (x5), Mario Lemieux (x3), Mark Messier (x2), Brett Hull, Sergei Fedorov, Eric Lindros, Dominik Hasek (x2), Jaromir Jagr, Joe Sakic, Martin St. Louis, Sidney Crosby (x3), Alexander Ovechkin (x2), Evgeni Malkin, Carey Price, Patrick Kane, Connor McDavid (x3), Nikita Kucherov (x2), Leon Draisaitl, Auston Matthews, and Nathan MacKinnon. 13 of those players have also won the Art Ross Trophy for the same season a combined 23 times and completed a Hart-Pearson/Lindsay-Art Ross sweep: Esposito, Lafleur (x2), Gretzky (x5), Lemieux (x3), Jagr, St. Louis, Crosby (x2), Ovechkin, Malkin, Kane, McDavid (x3), Kucherov and Draisaitl. Hasek and Price are the only goaltenders to win the Hart and Pearson/Lindsay in the same year. Bobby Orr won the Norris, Pearson and Art Ross in 1974-75 and is the only defenceman to win the Pearson/Lindsay. Lafleur, Lemieux (x2) and Gretzky (x5), Ovechkin and McDavid have also all led the league in goal scoring in the years they won the Hart, Pearson/Lindsay and Art Ross; though only Ovechkin and McDavid won the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy which was introduced in 1998–99. Brett Hull, Ovechkin and Auston Matthews have also led the league in goals in years they won the Hart and Pearson/Lindsay (but not the Art Ross).\nWinners\n, record five-time winner.]]\n, four-time winner.]]\n, three-time winner.]]\n, three-time winner.]]\n, three-time winner.]]\n, four-time winner.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Positions key\n| C || Centre\n| D || Defence\n| RW || Right wing\n| LW || Left wing\n| G || Goaltender\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Season\n!Winner\n!Team\n!Position\n!Win #\n|-bgcolor=\"eeeeee\"\n| colspan=5;|\n|-\n| 1970–71\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1971–72\n|\n| New York Rangers\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1972–73\n|\n| Philadelphia Flyers\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1973–74\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n| C\n| 2\n|-\n| 1974–75\n|\n| Boston Bruins\n| D\n| 1\n|-\n| 1975–76\n|\n| Montreal Canadiens\n| RW\n| 1\n|-\n| 1976–77\n|\n| Montreal Canadiens\n| RW\n| 2\n|-\n| 1977–78\n|\n| Montreal Canadiens\n| RW\n| 3\n|-\n| 1978–79\n|\n| Los Angeles Kings\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1979–80\n|\n| Los Angeles Kings\n| C\n| 2\n|- bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\"\n| 1980–81\n|\n| St. Louis Blues\n| G\n| 1\n|-\n| 1981–82\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1982–83\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 2\n|-\n| 1983–84\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 3\n|-\n| 1984–85\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 4\n|-\n| 1985–86\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1986–87\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 5\n|-\n| 1987–88\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| C\n| 2\n|-\n| 1988–89\n|\n| Detroit Red Wings\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1989–90\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1990–91\n|\n| St. Louis Blues\n| RW\n| 1\n|-\n| 1991–92\n|\n| New York Rangers\n| C\n| 2\n|-\n| 1992–93\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| C\n| 3\n|-\n| 1993–94\n|\n| Detroit Red Wings\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1994–95\n|\n| Philadelphia Flyers\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 1995–96\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| C\n| 4\n|-\n| 1996–97\n|\n| Buffalo Sabres\n| G\n| 1\n|-\n| 1997–98\n|\n| Buffalo Sabres\n| G\n| 2\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\"\n| 1998–99\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| RW\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\"\n| 1999–2000\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| RW\n| 2\n|-\n| 2000–01\n|\n| Colorado Avalanche\n| C\n| 1\n|-\n| 2001–02\n|\n| Calgary Flames\n| RW\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\"\n| 2002–03\n|\n| Vancouver Canucks\n| LW\n| 1\n|-\n| 2003–04\n|\n| Tampa Bay Lightning\n| RW\n| 1\n|-\n| 2004–05\n| colspan=4 align=\"center\" |Season cancelled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\"\n| 2005–06\n|\n| New York Rangers\n| RW\n| 3\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECEC\"\n| 2006–07\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| C\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2007–08\n|\n| Washington Capitals\n| LW\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2008–09\n|\n| Washington Capitals\n| LW\n| 2\n|-bgcolor=\"eeeeee\"\n| colspan=5; |\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2009–10\n|\n| Washington Capitals\n| LW\n| 3\n|-\n| 2010–11\n|\n| Vancouver Canucks\n| LW\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2011–12\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| C\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2012–13\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| C\n| 2\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2013–14\n|\n| Pittsburgh Penguins\n| C\n| 3\n|- bgcolor=\"#FBCCE7\"\n| 2014–15\n|\n| Montreal Canadiens\n| G\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2015–16\n|\n| Chicago Blackhawks\n| RW\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2016–17\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2017–18\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 2\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2018–19\n|\n| Tampa Bay Lightning\n| RW\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2019–20\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2020–21\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 3\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2021–22\n|\n| Toronto Maple Leafs\n| C\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2022–23\n|\n| Edmonton Oilers\n| C\n| 4\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2023–24\n|\n| Colorado Avalanche\n| C\n| 1\n|- bgcolor=\"#CFECED\"\n| 2024–25\n|\n| Tampa Bay Lightning\n| RW\n| 2\n|}\nSee also\n*List of National Hockey League awards\n*List of NHL players\n*List of NHL statistical leaders\nReferences\n;General\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090623001955/http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=24944 Ted Lindsay Award] at NHL.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085902/http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/silver_splashlesterbpearson.htm Ted Lindsay Award history] at Legends of Hockey.net\n;Specific"
