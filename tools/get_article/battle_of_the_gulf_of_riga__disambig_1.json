The operation's objective was to destroy the Russian naval forces in the Gulf in preparation for landing German troops to facilitate the fall of Riga in the later stages of the Central Powers' offensive on the Eastern Front in 1915. The German fleet, however, failed to achieve its objective and was forced to return to its bases; Riga remained in Russian hands until it fell to the German Army on 1 September 1917.\nPrelude\nIn early August 1915, several powerful units of the German High Seas Fleet were transferred to the Baltic to participate in the foray into the Riga Gulf. The intention was to destroy the Russian naval forces in the area, including the pre-dreadnought battleship , and to use the minelayer  to block the entrance to Moon Sound with mines. The German naval forces, under the command of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper, included the four  and four s, the battlecruisers , , and , and a number of smaller craft.\nBattle\nOn 8 August, the first attempt to clear the gulf was made; the old pre-dreadnought battleships  and  kept Slava at bay while minesweepers cleared a path through the inner belt of mines. During this period, the rest of the German fleet remained in the Baltic and provided protection against other units of the Russian fleet. However, the approach of nightfall meant that Deutschland would be unable to mine the entrance to the Suur Strait in time, and so the operation was broken off.\nIn the meantime, the German armored cruisers  and  were detached to shell the Russian positions on the Sõrve Peninsula in the south of the island of Saaremaa. Several Russian destroyers were anchored off Sõrve, and one was slightly damaged during the bombardment. The battlecruiser Von der Tann and the light cruiser  were sent to shell the island of Utö.\nOn 16 August, a second attempt was made to enter the gulf. The dreadnoughts  and , four light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats breached the defenses to the gulf. On the first day of the assault, the German minesweeper T46 was sunk, as was the destroyer . On 17 August, Nassau and Posen engaged in an artillery duel with Slava, resulting in three hits on the Russian ship that prompted her withdrawal. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the gulf on 19 August, but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the gulf the following day.\nThroughout the operation, the German battlecruisers remained in the Baltic and provided cover for the assault into the Gulf of Riga. On the morning of 19 August, Moltke was torpedoed by the British E-class submarine ; the torpedo was not spotted until it was approximately  away. Without time to manoeuver, the ship was struck in the bow torpedo room. The explosion damaged several torpedoes in the ship, but they did not detonate themselves. Eight men were killed, and  of water entered the ship. The ship was repaired at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg, between 23 August and 20 September.\nFour large, flat-bottomed barges loaded with German troops attempted to land at Pernau on 20 August, but were repelled by small Russian warships. The Russian gunboat  was destroyed in an engagement with the German light cruiser  and eight destroyers.\nOrder of battle\nRussia\n* Battleship:\n* Cruiser:\n* Gunboats: , , ,\n* Minelayer:\n* Flotilla of 16 destroyers\n* Submarines: , , , ,\nGermany\n* Battleships: , , ,\n* Battlecruiser: , ,\n* Cruisers: , , , , ,\n* Minelayer:\n* Flotilla of 56 destroyers\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.neva.ru/EXPO96/book/chap11-2.html Account of Russian WWI naval operations in the Baltic Sea]"
