Concepts have been proposed for both chickens and cattle. Others have explored the idea of using virtual reality with humans to kill animals or perform other slaughterhouse work remotely. Both uses are controversial\nTimeline\nIn 2014, a proposal was made of a \"virtual free range\" chicken farm with special googles adapted to chickens. The proposal was partly serious and partly a critique of living conditions on chicken farms alongside critiques of humans living more of their lives virtually.\nIn 2019, a story over a Russian dairy farm testing VR on cows went viral, thought it is not fully clear if this occurred as shown in viral photos. The reported aim was to decrease stress by showing images of pasture in the VR googles. They claimed milk yields increased. Many researchers in the area are skeptical of ther claims. They noted that the pressure from googles themselves would likely increase stress. Cattle vision optics are different to humans, making headsets unlikely to work without modification. They also argued that many of the cows had never seen pasture making it unlikely for them to have an emotional response to the visual alone without the other sensory input.\nIn 2022, following the story of the Russian dairy farm, a Turkish dairy farm mirrored the concept, and used two VR headsets per cow instead of one. They claimed milk yields were higher among two cows with the goggles.\nCriticism\nOn farm animals\nThe concept has faced criticism from researchers, members of the general public, and animal rights and animal welfare groups. Many researchers are skeptical of the claimed benefits, the lack of scientific rigor or study details in previous attempts, and argue it may increase stress. Members of the public on social media alongside groups such as world animal protection have compared the practice to the matrix, with some satirically calling it \"the Mootrix\".\nFor slaughterhouse work\nMercy for Animals has criticized the potential uses of VR in slaughterhouses. They said it would \"turn butchering animals into a kind of gruesome video game\" and that it wouldn't make conditions any better for farm animals.\nReferences"
