As a result, the first targeted city was Hecatompylos, located about 160 km from Carthage.\nThe expedition was carried out smoothly thanks to the diplomatic skills of Hanno II the Great. The soldiers were welcomed as guests rather than conquerors, but the Carthaginian general nevertheless demanded 3,000 hostages.\nTheveste remained under Carthaginian control for only 50 years; afterwards, it came under the authority of King Syphax.\nReferences"
