Treaty negotiations with several Western countries were made possible by the completion of this initial Japanese overture.\nIn 1882, the Americans concluded a treaty and established diplomatic relations, which served as a template for subsequent negotiations with other Western powers.\nTreaty provisions\nThe British and Koreans negotiated and approved a multi-article treaty with provisions similar to other Western nations.\nMinisters from the United Kingdom to Korea were appointed in accordance with this treaty; and these diplomats were:  Sir Harry Parkes, appointed in 1884; Sir John Walsham, appointed in 1885; Sir Nicholas O'Conor, in 1892; Sir Claude Maxwell, in 1896; John Jordan in 1898.\nThe treaty remained in effect even after the Japanese protectorate was established in 1905, and only came to an end in 1910 when Japan annexed Korea.\nUnder the treaty, the United Kingdom obtained extraterritorial rights in Korea and from 1883 to 1910, British subjects in Korea were not subject to the jurisdiction of Korean courts, but instead were tried or had civil cases brought against them in British consular courts or the British Supreme Court for China and Japan which was called the Supreme Court for China and Korea between 1900 and 1910.\nSee also\n* List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to North Korea\n* List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to South Korea\nNotes\nReferences and further reading\n* Han, Seunghoon. \"The Endeavour to Revise Unequal Treaties in East Asia in the Early 1880s.\" International Journal of Korean History 23.1 (2018): 87–115.
