Representing a local variant of Usatove culture, it was contemporary with the Ottomány culture and Unetice culture and was replaced by the Noua culture. Its name was coined after the eponymic Wietenberg Hill near Sighișoara.\nPeople of this culture traded with the Mycenaeans. Burial sites contain bronze battle axes and maces with stone heads. Pottery consists of amphorae with spiral and meandric ornament.\nBy 1964, about 200 settlements of this culture were discovered.\nGallery\nFile:Wietenberg culture axes at National Museum of Transylvanian History 2007.jpg|Battle axes from Valea Chioarului, Maramureș County (National Museum of Transylvanian History in Cluj)\nFile:Wientenberg gold bracelet 2.jpg|Gold bracelet (from pre-WWI book plate)\nFile:Wietenberg gold bracelet 1.jpg|Gold bracelet from Biia, Alba County, c. 1600 BC (from pre-WWI book plate)\nFile:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic6Pipea.JPG|Gold bracelet (Natural History Museum, Vienna)\nFile:Bracelet1a.jpg|Gold armring (Natural History Museum, Vienna)\nFile:Bronze sword - National History Museum of Romania 15914.jpg|Hajdúsámson-Apa-type sword, from Apa, Satu Mare, 17th century BC\nFile:Alba Iulia National Museum of the Union 2011 - Pottery, Bone and Bronze Artefacts of the Wietenberg Culture.JPG|Pottery, bone and bronze artefacts (National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia)\nFile:Età del bronzo, tesoro di smig, parure, XVII-XVI sec. ac..JPG|Gold treasure from Șmig, Sibiu County, 17th-16th c.
