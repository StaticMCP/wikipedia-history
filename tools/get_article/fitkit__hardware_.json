Students were expected to create an FPGA interpreter design of a simple programming language (such as Brainfuck) as part of the Design of Computer Systems course.\nThe FITKit was obsoleted sometime around 2021 mainly due to the software obsolescence.\nLicensing\nThe project was developed as an open-source (software) and open-core (hardware), under the BSD license.\nRelated projects\n* QDevKit, multiplatform development environment for FITkit (Linux, BSD and Microsoft Windows operating systems)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://merlin.fit.vutbr.cz/FITkit/en/uvod.html Official website]\n* [http://merlin.fit.vutbr.cz/FITkit/en/tym.html FITkit team]\n* [http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/index.php.en Faculty of Information Technology] (Brno University of Technology)\n* [https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/courses/INP Design of Computer Systems course website]"
