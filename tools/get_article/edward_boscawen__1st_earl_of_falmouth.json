He was educated at Eton College and served briefly as an Ensign in the Coldstream Guards.\nCareer\nIn the General Election of 1807, Falmouth was elected Member of Parliament for Truro, standing as a Tory on the day before his 20th birthday. On the death of his father the following year, he resigned both his seat and his commission and took up his place in the House of Lords. He used his patronage to appoint his potential brother in law William John Bankes as his successor as MP for Truro. In 1821, on the coronation of George IV, he was created Earl of Falmouth.\nAs a member of the Ultra-Tory faction, he was vehemently opposed to parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation. In 1829 he acted as second to Lord Winchilsea in his famous duel with the Duke of Wellington over the latter issue. He always insisted that he persuaded Winchelsea to fire into the air, and he had certainly prepared an apology, which Wellington accepted.\nHe was the last Recorder of Truro and the author of a pamphlet on the subject of stannary courts.\nFamily\n(Kingston Lacy)]]\n]]\nLord Falmouth was married to Anne Frances Bankes (1790–1864), elder daughter of Henry Bankes of Kingston Lacy estate on 27 August 1810. She was from the old and prominent Bankes family, her brothers were \"the exiled\" William John Bankes and George Bankes.\nHe died at Tregothnan in December 1841, aged 54, and was succeeded by his only son, George.\nAfter his death, his widow came to stay periodically at Kingston Lacy to help her exiled brother, William John Bankes (1786-1855) in the reorganisation of their family home. Lady Falmouth lived at 3 Whitehall Gardens, Westminster, until her death in 1864. A philanthropist, she endowed almshouses at Brimpton and a village school at Woolhampton, both in Berkshire.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
