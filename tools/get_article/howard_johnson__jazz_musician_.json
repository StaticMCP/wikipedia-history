He is known to have expanded the tuba’s known capacities in jazz.\nJohnson was known for his extensive work as a sideman, notably with George Gruntz, Hank Crawford, and Gil Evans. As a leader, he fronted the tuba ensemble Gravity and released three albums during the 1990s for Verve Records; the first Arrival, was a tribute to Pharoah Sanders.\nBiography\nHoward Lewis Johnson was born on August 7, 1941 in Montgomery, Alabama, United States, but from the age of two was raised in Massillon, Ohio. A self-taught musician, he began playing baritone saxophone and tuba while still in high school. After graduating in 1958, he served in the U.S. Navy before moving to Boston, where he lived with the family of the drummer Tony Williams. He then spent time in Chicago, where he met Eric Dolphy, before moving to New York City in 1963.\nIn the 1960s he worked with Charles Mingus, Hank Crawford, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Archie Shepp, and Hank Mobley on the album A Slice of the Top. He also began a long association with Gil Evans in 1966. He was arranger of a horn section that backed Taj Mahal on Mahal's 1971 live album, The Real Thing, which featured three other tubists/multi-instrumentalists, Bob Stewart, Joseph Daley and Earl McIntyre. Johnson also played with the Band on their Rock of Ages live album, The Last Waltz and into the new millennium with Levon Helm's band.\nDuring the 1970s, he was the live band conductor of the Saturday Night Live Band; he can be seen in several musical numbers, including playing bass saxophone in the \"King Tut\" sketch and leading his all-tuba band Gravity in a featured performance on Season 3, Episode 17. Gravity was perhaps his best-known band.\nJohnson led three tuba bands, collaborated with Tomasz Stańko, Substructure, Tuba Libre, and Gravity. He has recorded frequently. In 1981, he performed at the Woodstock Jazz Festival, held in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Creative Music Studio. He had a minor role in the 1983 film Eddie and the Cruisers as Wendell's replacement. He has also appeared in episodes of Matlock and Hill Street Blues. In 1984, he appeared as part of the Gil Evans Orchestra, accompanying Jaco Pastorius at the Live Under the Sky festival in Japan.\nJohnson played saxophone on The Muddy Waters Woodstock Album (1975) with Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, Paul Butterfield, Bob Margolin and Pinetop Perkins.\nJohnson accompanied James Taylor in a performance of \"Jelly Man Kelly\" on Sesame Street in 1983, and also on tin whistle when Taylor sings to Oscar the Grouch.\nPersonal life and death\nJohnson was father to David and Nedra. David (1964–2009) was an actor in New York, and lived in Brooklyn. Nedra is a blues singer and musician. Johnson died on January 11, 2021, \"in his New York home\".\nDiscography\n(2013)]]\nAs leader\n*Arrival: A Pharoah Sanders Tribute (Verve, 1994)\n*Gravity!!! (Verve, 1996)\n*Right Now!
