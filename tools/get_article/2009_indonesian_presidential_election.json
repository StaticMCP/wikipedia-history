The elections returned a president and vice president for the 2009–2014 term. Incumbent President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, elected with a 20% margin in the 2004 election, sought a second term against former President Megawati Sukarnoputri in a rematch of the 2004 election, as well as incumbent Vice President Jusuf Kalla. Securing a majority of the votes in a landslide victory in the first round, Yudhoyono was re-elected without the need to proceed to a second round. Yudhoyono was officially declared the victor of the election on 23 July 2009, by the General Election Commission (KPU). At the time of his re-election victory, Yudhoyono, with nearly 74 million votes in his favour, held the record for the highest number of votes for a single person in any democratic election in history, surpassing Barack Obama's total of 69.5 million votes in the 2008 United States presidential election. His record was surpassed by his respective successors Joko Widodo who won more than 85 million votes in 2019 and Prabowo Subianto  who won more than 96 million votes in 2024.\nBackground\nThis was the second election in which Indonesians elected their President and Vice President directly. In 2004, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono defeated incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in a run-off election. Polls through early January 2009 saw Yudhoyono leading a large field of potential presidential candidates.\nIncumbent vice president Jusuf Kalla announced in February 2009 that he would not be returning as a vice presidential candidate with Yudhoyono. Instead, he was ready to challenge Yudhoyono should Golkar, the party which he chaired, nominate him as a presidential candidate. Other individuals interested in becoming presidential candidates included former President Abdurrahman Wahid, former People's Representative Council (DPR) Speaker Akbar Tandjung, Yogyakarta Sultan Hamengkubuwana X, and former Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso.\nOn 17 February the Constitutional Court ruled that independent candidates would not be allowed to run in the election.\nCoalition talks\nFollowing legislative elections held on 9 April, coalitions of political parties began to emerge in order to nominate candidates for President and Vice President. Under the 2008 Presidential Election Law, the candidates must be nominated by a party or coalition that won at least 25% of the popular vote or 112 (20%) of 560 seats of the DPR. Indonesia's Constitutional Court also ruled that independent candidates would not be allowed to run. Candidates had to officially register with the KPU by midnight of 16 May in order to appear on the ballots.\nIt initially appeared that Golkar, the party of incumbent Vice President Jusuf Kalla, would enter into a coalition with the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) of former president Megawati Sukarnoputri to challenge President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's Democratic Party. However, talks were broken off on 13 April 2009, with Golkar reportedly more interested in continuing the coalition with Yudhoyono rather than risk being cut off from power completely. Yudhoyono was also in talks with Islamist parties in a bid to form a coalition controlling more than half the seats in parliament.\nBy late April 2009, Golkar was in talks with smaller parties to gain the votes it lacked to be able to nominate Kalla as a presidential candidate. A ten-party coalition was formed on 1 May, consisting of Golkar, PDI-P, the Gerindra Party, the People's Conscience Party (Hanura), the Prosperous Peace Party (PDS), the Reform Star Party (PBR), the Ulema National Awakening Party (PKNU), the National People's Concern Party (PPRN), the Labor Party and the Indonesian Nahdlatul Community Party (PPNUI). Two parties who had been considering joining the coalition, the National Mandate Party (PAN) and the United Development Party (PPP), in the end, decided not to join. Shortly after the ten-party coalition was announced, incumbent Vice President Kalla announced a joint ticket with former Indonesian military leader Wiranto.\nThe PDI-P selected former president Megawati as its presidential candidate on 7 May but did not immediately announce a running mate. The possibility of Gerindra leader Prabowo Subianto becoming Megawati's running mate had been favoured by PDI-P leadership, but the two parties had yet to come to an agreement two days before the 16 May candidate registration deadline. After plans to announce the pair's candidacy were postponed to allow for continuing negotiations, both parties eventually declared on 15 May the nomination of Megawati and Prabowo as candidates for president and vice president.\nIn the scenario that either Kalla or Megawati would have lost his or her bid for the presidency in the first election round, one candidate would have supported the other in the second round, as agreed upon by the grand coalition formed to oppose incumbent President Yudhoyono.\nOn 12 May 2009, Yudhoyono chose Boediono, the governor of Bank Indonesia (Indonesia's central bank), as his running mate. Four parties which had planned to form a coalition with Yudhoyono's Democratic Party (PAN, PPP, the National Awakening Party (PKB), and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS)) had expected that the vice presidential nominee would come from one of their parties. Although they threatened to form their own coalition with Gerindra and present their own candidate, PKB became the first party in the coalition to support Yudhoyono's decision. The remaining three parties eventually agreed to support the Yudhoyono–Boediono ticket and attended the nomination ceremony in Bandung on 15 May.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Political party\n! colspan=\"2\" |Supporting\n|-\n!For President\n!For Vice President\n|-\n|Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=center|Megawati Sukarnoputri(PDI-P)\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=center|Prabowo Subianto(Gerindra)\n|-\n|Gerindra Party (Gerindra)\n|-\n|Sovereignty Party (Partai Kedaulatan)\n|-\n|Functional Party of Struggle (PKP)\n|-\n|Indonesian National Party Marhaenism (PNI Marhaenisme)\n|-\n|Labor Party (Partai Buruh)\n|-\n|Indonesian Nahdlatul Community Party (PPNUI)\n|-\n|Indonesian Unity Party (PSI)\n|-\n|Freedom Party (Partai Merdeka)\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Democratic Party (PD)\n| rowspan=\"23\" align=center|Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono(Demokrat)\n| rowspan=\"23\" align=center|Boediono(Independent)\n|-\n|Prosperous Justice Party (PKS)\n|-\n|National Mandate Party (PAN)\n|-\n|United Development Party (PPP)\n|-\n|National Awakening Party (PKB)\n|-\n|Crescent Star Party (PBB)\n|-\n|Prosperous Peace Party (PDS)\n|-\n|Concern for the Nation Functional Party (PKPB)\n|-\n|Reform Star Party (PBR)\n|-\n|National People's Concern Party (PPRN)\n|-\n|Indonesian Justice and Unity Party (PKPI)\n|-\n|Democratic Renewal Party (PDP)\n|-\n|Indonesian Workers and Employers Party (PPPI)\n|-\n|Archipelago Republic Party (PRN)\n|-\n|Patriot Party (Partai Patriot)\n|-\n|Indonesian National Populist Fortress Party (PNBK)\n|-\n|Indonesian Youth Party (PPI)\n|-\n|National Sun Party (PMB)\n|-\n|Pioneers' Party (Partai Pelopor)\n|-\n|Indonesian Democratic Party of Devotion (PKDI)\n|-\n|Prosperous Indonesia Party (PIS)\n|-\n|New Indonesia Party of Struggle (PPIB)\n|-\n|Indonesian Democratic Vanguard Party (PPDI)\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Golkar\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=center|Jusuf Kalla(Golkar)\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=center|Wiranto(Hanura)\n|-\n|People's Conscience Party (Hanura)\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Source: Tempo\n|}\nCandidates\nNominees for president and vice president registered their candidacy at the central KPU office in Jakarta on 16 May.

The candidates were officially announced on 28 May and drew their ballot numbers at the KPU building on 31 May. Megawati–Prabowo drew number 1, SBY–Boediono number 2 and Kalla–Wiranto number 3.\nThe presidential election campaign began on 2 June and ran until 4 July, with mass rallies allowed from 12 June onwards. Those participating in the campaign were not allowed to question the basis of the Indonesian state, insult the race or religion of candidates, use threats or violence or give financial or material incentives to voters. There were a series of debates between 18 June and 2 July that were carried live on Indonesian television, three between the presidential candidates and two between the vice-presidential candidates. The topics for these two-hour debates were agreed in advance, and by common consent, did not explicitly include human rights issues.\nAfter a two-day \"silent period\", voting took place on 8 July. National election results are due to be announced between 27 and 29 July. Following a period to allow for legal challenges, the final results will be announced between 1 and 12 August. If the election goes to a second round, the second campaign period will run from 15 July – 7 September, with the vote on 8 September. The final result is due to be announced on 8 October, with the president and vice-president being sworn before the general session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in 20 October.\nResults\nBy province\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size: 0.9em;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" |Province\n! colspan=\"2\" |Yudhoyono\n! colspan=\"2\" |Megawati\n! colspan=\"2\" |Kalla\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:;\" |\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|Aceh\n|2,093,567\n|93.25\n|53,835\n|2.40\n|97,717\n|4.35\n|-\n|align=left|North Sumatra\n|4,234,116\n|71.36\n|1,395,532\n|23.52\n|303,684\n|5.12\n|-\n|align=left|West Sumatra\n|1,828,155\n|79.93\n|134,662\n|5.89\n|324,336\n|14.18\n|-\n|align=left|Riau\n|1,502,684\n|64.07\n|555,564\n|23.69\n|287,067\n|12.24\n|-\n|align=left|Riau Islands\n|481,795\n|64.36\n|198,364\n|26.50\n|68,417\n|9.14\n|-\n|align=left|Bangka Belitung Islands\n|267,914\n|48.74\n|211,984\n|38.56\n|69,796\n|12.70\n|-\n|align=left|Jambi\n|927,038\n|59.41\n|455,239\n|29.17\n|178,223\n|11.42\n|-\n|align=left|South Sumatra\n|2,075,451\n|54.07\n|1,518,648\n|39.57\n|244,245\n|6.36\n|-\n|align=left|Bengkulu\n|545,327\n|64.14\n|197,566\n|23.24\n|107,338\n|12.62\n|-\n|align=left|Lampung\n|2,803,691\n|70.23\n|963,228\n|24.13\n|225,426\n|5.65\n|-\n|align=left|Jakarta\n|3,543,472\n|70.36\n|1,028,227\n|20.42\n|464,257\n|9.22\n|-\n|align=left|West Java\n|14,385,202\n|65.08\n|5,793,987\n|26.21\n|1,925,533\n|8.71\n|-\n|align=left|Central Java\n|9,281,132\n|53.06\n|6,694,981\n|38.28\n|1,514,316\n|8.66\n|-\n|align=left|Yogyakarta\n|1,219,187\n|61.71\n|555,071\n|28.10\n|201,389\n|10.19\n|-\n|align=left|East Java\n|11,732,298\n|60.32\n|5,916,628\n|30.42\n|1,801,836\n|9.26\n|-\n|align=left|Banten\n|3,350,243\n|65.06\n|1,389,285\n|26.98\n|410,270\n|7.97\n|-\n|align=left|Bali\n|822,951\n|43.03\n|992,815\n|51.92\n|96,571\n|5.05\n|-\n|align=left|West Nusa Tenggara\n|1,693,864\n|74.63\n|188,705\n|8.31\n|387,257\n|17.06\n|-\n|align=left|East Nusa Tenggara\n|1,125,592\n|52.73\n|881,761\n|41.30\n|127,441\n|5.97\n|-\n|align=left|West Kalimantan\n|1,235,144\n|54.03\n|848,603\n|37.12\n|202,459\n|8.86\n|-\n|align=left|Central Kalimantan\n|491,319\n|48.32\n|430,087\n|42.30\n|95,305\n|9.37\n|-\n|align=left|South Kalimantan\n|1,106,775\n|64.02\n|376,941\n|21.80\n|245,142\n|14.18\n|-\n|align=left|East Kalimantan\n|833,059\n|51.89\n|443,323\n|27.61\n|328,990\n|20.49\n|-\n|align=left|North Sulawesi\n|691,954\n|54.82\n|393,147\n|31.15\n|177,174\n|14.04\n|-\n|align=left|Central Sulawesi\n|669,413\n|50.53\n|110,627\n|8.35\n|544,758\n|41.12\n|-\n|align=left|South Sulawesi\n|1,335,115\n|31.62\n|167,970\n|3.98\n|2,719,701\n|64.41\n|-\n|align=left|Southeast Sulawesi\n|499,075\n|45.61\n|87,536\n|8.00\n|507,504\n|46.38\n|-\n|align=left|West Sulawesi\n|293,778\n|50.75\n|26,815\n|4.63\n|258,336\n|44.62\n|-\n|align=left|Gorontalo\n|241,222\n|44.22\n|35,225\n|6.46\n|269,057\n|49.32\n|-\n|align=left|North Maluku\n|214,757\n|38.94\n|112,173\n|20.34\n|224,583\n|40.72\n|-\n|align=left|Maluku\n|423,165\n|53.70\n|192,978\n|24.49\n|171,842\n|21.81\n|-\n|align=left|Papua\n|1,377,384\n|74.05\n|104,593\n|5.62\n|378,119\n|20.33\n|-\n|align=left|West Papua\n|313,577\n|73.95\n|44,484\n|10.49\n|65,982\n|15.56\n|-\n|align=left|Overseas\n|235,146\n|69.08\n|47,521\n|13.96\n|57,743\n|16.96\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n|align=left|Total\n|73,874,562\n|60.80\n|32,548,105\n|26.79\n|15,081,814\n|12.41\n|- class=sortbottom\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|- class=sortbottom\n|align=left colspan=7|Source: [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131225095757/http%3A//mediacenter.kpu.go.id/images/mediacenter/pilpres2009/rekapitulasi_nasional.pdf General Elections Commission]\n|}\nQuick count results\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:right\n!
