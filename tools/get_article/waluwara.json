They were on the Georgina River, northwards from Roxborough Downs to Carandotta and Urandangi. Their territory took in Moonah Creek and the area in the vicinity of Rochedale. Their southwestern frontier was around Pituri Creek.\nSocial organization\nThe Waluwara were composed of several hordes of which the following are known:\n* Didjadidja (Roxborough)\n* Kapula (Carandotta)\n* Panggara (Moonah Creek)\nForeign impressions\nJ. G. Edge, reporting on some words in their language, thought the Waluwara 'poor specimens of the dark race', citing as an illustration of their backwardness a lack of knowledge of the sea. He was also under the impression that native lore attributed the rites of subincision in their Miki ceremony of initiation as originating in a lack of water sufficient to provide enough food to sustain their numerous children, so that a ceremony of emasculation was established.\nAlternative names\n* Walugara\n* Walukara\n* Elookera\n* Wollegarra\n* Waloo-kera\n* Warluwara\n* Wallawarra\n* Wolga (toponym)\n* Walgra\n* Didjadidja\n* Kapula\n* Panggara/Pangara\n* Paringgara ('creek dwellers')\n* Yannalinka (? horde name at Carandotta)\n* Maula\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n}}"
