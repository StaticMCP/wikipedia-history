It publishes all laws, decrees, and official decisions adopted by the President of Algeria, the People's National Assembly, and other state institutions. It is issued by the Secretariat-General of the Government and made available both in Arabic and French. Only legal texts published in the Official Journal are considered legally binding in Algeria.\nHistory\nBefore Algeria's independence, the publication of legal texts concerning the territory, such as laws, decrees, and ordinances, was handled by the Recueil des actes administratifs de la Délégation générale du gouvernement. This publication had replaced the Journal officiel de l’Algérie, which was first established on 7 January 1927.\nFollowing the proclamation of independence on 5 July 1962, the Official Journal of the Algerian State (JOEA) was issued for the first time on 6 July 1962, one day after independence. Its first twelve-page issue was mainly devoted to the declaration of independence, publishing the results of the self-determination referendum of 1 July 1962 (with a typographical error showing “15 July”), as well as the letters exchanged between President Charles de Gaulle and Abderrahmane Farès, head of the Provisional Executive. On 26 October 1962, the publication officially became the Official Journal of the Algerian Democratic and Popular Republic (JORA).\nReferences"
