Some unorthodox methods can include warmed potatoes, uncooked rice, and hard-boiled eggs. The most common warm compress is a warm, wet washcloth.\nUses\nWarm compresses are a common non-pharmacological therapy used in the treatment of things such as sports injuries, dental pain, post-operative wound healing, and ophthalmic conditions. They are believed to improve blood flow, increase oxygenation in tissues and help manage inflammation.\nFor eye problems\nWarm compresses are commonly used for the treatment of certain ocular conditions such as:\n* dry eyes\n* pinkeye (conjunctivitis)\n* stye or chalazion\n* swollen eyelids (blepharitis)\n* meibomian gland dysfunction\n* muscle spasms or pain\nFor injury to muscle or joint\nFor both muscle and joint injuries, it is common to alternate both cold and warm compresses to manage inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids may also be used in conjunction.\nReferences"
