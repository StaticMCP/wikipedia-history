The Library is governed by the Library Board of Queensland, which  draws its powers from the Libraries Act 1988. State Library is responsible for collecting and preserving a comprehensive collection of Queensland's cultural and documentary heritage, providing free access to information for all Queenslanders and for the advancement of public libraries across the state. The Library is at Kurilpa Point, within the Queensland Cultural Centre on the Brisbane River at South Bank.\nHistory\nThe Brisbane Public Library was established by the government of the Colony of Queensland in 1896, and was renamed the Public Library of Queensland in 1898. The library was opened to the public in 1902.\nIn 1934, the Oxley Memorial Library (now the John Oxley Library), named for the explorer John Oxley, opened as a centre for research and study relating specifically to Queensland. The Libraries Act 1943 established the Library Board of Queensland to manage the Public Library of Queensland; three years later, under the terms of The Oxley Memorial Library of Queensland Act, it took over management of the Oxley Memorial Library as well.\nIn March 1947, James L. Stapleton was appointed Queensland's first State Librarian. Stapleton advocated for a new building for the library and that library services should be free to the public.\nIn 1971, the \"Public Library\" became the \"State Library\". The following year, the Public Library Service was established to liaise with Queensland local governments regarding their public libraries; a subsidy for employing qualified staff in public libraries was also established. A few years later the Country Lending Service was established to provide book exchange and other services to public libraries in Queensland's smaller local government areas. Under the new name of Rural Libraries Queensland, the service is still going strong today.\nIn 1988, the State Library relocated from the old State Library building in William Street in the Brisbane CBD to its present location in the Queensland Cultural Centre in South Brisbane.\nIn 2003, the State Library began a new mission of establishing Indigenous Knowledge Centres (IKCs) in the Cape York and Torres Strait areas. There is now a network of 22 IKCs in remote and regional communities: across Cape York, the islands of the Torres Strait, Central Queensland and at Cherbourg in South East Queensland.\nBetween 2006 and 2009, the library was extensively renovated both internally and externally, including the addition of a fifth floor, a large addition facing the river, and a new entrance. In 2010, the neighbouring riverside building housing the Fountain Room restaurant and an auditorium became part of the library and following some modifications was redesignated as \"The Edge\" and used to hold workshops, creative activities, events and exhibitions.\nIn early 2011, the library donated 50,000 pictures to Wikimedia Commons.\nIn 2022 State Library [https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/blog/back-future-1 celebrated its 120th birthday].\nArchitecture\nThe Brisbane Public Library moved into the Old State Library Building in William Street, Brisbane in 1899. This building had formerly been occupied by the Queensland Museum.\nThe Library originally shared accommodation in the building with an art gallery. In the late 1950s, an extension, with a distinctive tiled mural by Lindsay Edward on the exterior, was built onto the building to provide more space.  The mural was the winning design in a national competition held in 1958.\nIn 1988, the year of Brisbane's World Expo 88, State Library of Queensland moved to a new home within the Queensland Cultural Centre at South Bank, near the Queensland Museum and the original Queensland Art Gallery, on the site of the former St Helen's Methodist Hospital, South Brisbane. This new building, a C-shaped edifice of straight-faced concrete and glass built around a mature Poinciana tree overlooking the Brisbane River, was the work of architectural firm, Robin Gibson and Partners, and marked the completion of Gibson's ambitious Queensland Cultural Centre project.\nIn 2004, work began on the Millennium Library Project - a major  redevelopment of the existing State Library building. After three years of extensive redevelopment, the South Bank building officially re-opened on 25 November 2006.\nThis major redevelopment was the work of Brisbane-based architecture firms Donovan Hill and Peddle Thorp. Their work earned them several awards: the RAIA Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture, 2007 (award for best public building in Australia); the RAIA Emil Sodersten Award for Interior Architecture, 2007; the RAIA Queensland Architecture Award for Brisbane Building of the Year 2007; the RAIA FDG Stanley Award for Public Buildings Architecture 2007; and the AIB Queensland Award for Project of the Year + Sustainability Commendation, 2007.\nThe Donovan Hill/Peddle Thorp additions transformed the State Library building, reconfiguring the entrance, adding another level and doubling its size with an additional 12,000 sqm of new space.  Although the elements of the original Gibson scheme were preserved in the renovation, the building was deemed too altered to be included in the 2015 State Heritage Listing of the Cultural Centre.\nThe State Library building has since been described as an \"open, generous knowledge place\", and one of Australia's \"most cherished public living rooms\".\nThe building faces the Brisbane River and overlooks Stanley Place between the Queensland Art Gallery and the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art.\nCollection and services\nState Library holds general collections, including books, journals and magazines, newspapers, audio-visual items, family history, maps, music, ephemera, Internet and electronic resources.

Since 2014 the QBLHOF has also awarded an annual fellowship, to recipients working on a research project that utilises the resources of the John Oxley Library to produce new interpretations of Queensland's business history.\nQueensland Memory Awards\nThe Queensland Memory Awards recognise contributions to the documentation, preservation, and celebration of Queensland’s memory – past and present – through fellowships and awards.\nFellowships support researchers and creatives of all kinds to interpret the significant collections of the John Oxley Library.\nJohn Oxley Library Awards\nThe John Oxley Library Awards recognise outstanding contributions of individuals and organisations for outstanding contributions to documenting, preserving, and enhancing our understanding of Queensland’s cultural heritage. Some notable past recipients include: Robert (Uncle Bob) Anderson, Jackie Huggins, Richard Stringer, and Matthew Condon.\nblack&write! Writing Fellowships\nTwo black&write! Writing Fellowships are awarded each year to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander writers living anywhere in Australia, based on unpublished manuscripts. Each winner is awarded $15,000 cash prize, plus editorial development with the black&write! team, as well as the opportunity to be published by the University of Queensland Press. Six writers are shortlisted on the basis of a specific manuscript. The fellowships, awarded since 2011, have been awarded to writers including  Dakota Feirer, Jacob Gallagher, Susie Anderson, Tylissa Elisara, Carl Merrison, Lystra Rose, Nardi Simpson, Claire G. Coleman, Alison Whittaker, Jannali Jones, Jane Harrison, Jared Thomas, Tristan Savage, Teagan Chilcott, Sue McPherson, Ali Cobby Eckermann, Tori-Jay Mordey, and Jillian Boyd.\nThe award made headlines in 2025, when, just hours before the ceremony in Brisbane on 20 May, the library rescinded the fellowship to Martu author K. A. Ren Wyld (formerly known Karen Wyld), who is based in Adelaide, South Australia, on the instruction of Queensland Minister for the Arts John-Paul Langbroek. The decision was based on a 2024 tweet by Wyld about the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israel. She later said that she was not fully aware who Sinwar was at the time, and thought that she had deleted the tweet afterwards. The premier, David Crisafulli, had also been involved in the decision. Following the announcement, several panel judges for the Queensland Literary Awards resigned, including Jeanine Leane and writer and critic Nigel Featherstone. A statement published on the library website by State Librarian and CEO Vicki McDonald on 22 May 2025 said the library had complied with the Minister's decision to rescind the fellowship, and \"committed to undertake an independent review of the suite of awards and fellowships we administer\", with a \"specific focus on how we balance our strong commitment to freedom of expression and our role as a Queensland Government funded cultural institution\". The Australian Society of Authors issued a statement condemning the action of the government, calling it \"another alarming instance of the undermining of freedom of expression and arms-length arts funding\".  An open letter addressed to State Library and the arts minister, signed by many notable First Nations writers as well as non-Indigenous allies, demanded \"an immediate apology be offered to Ren Wyld and to the black&write! team, and for the fellowship to be reinstated in full\".\nOther fellowships\nFellowships support researchers and creatives of all kinds to interpret the significant collections of the John Oxley Library. Through deep engagement and interaction with the collections, these interpretations provide new insights into the collection and contribute new knowledge about Queensland's history.\nThe premier fellowship, the John Oxley Library Fellowship, has been awarded since 2004.\nOther fellowships with a historical focus include:\n* Monica Clare Research Fellowship (First Nations history)\n* Rainbow Research Fellowship (LGBTIQA+ history)\n* Queensland Heritage Register Fellowship (built heritage)\n* Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame Fellowship (business and economic history)\n* Digital collections catalyst (use of digital collections and data)\n* Christina Boughen OAM Fellowship (use of the Robert Boughen OBE and Christina Boughen OAM Collection)\n* Letty Katts Fellowship (music history)\n* Royal Queensland Show (Ekka) Fellowship\nResearch outcomes are published on the John Oxley Library blog.\nSee also\n*State Library donation of images to Wikimedia Commons in December 2010\n*Walker, Paul.
