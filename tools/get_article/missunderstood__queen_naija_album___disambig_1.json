Kellman said \"While Queen Naija has excelled with singles, the longer format allows her diaristic songwriting to truly flourish, and there's more poise and nuance in her lithe vocals without sacrificing the power of her rawest expressions.\" He also praised her work saying that \"Queen Naija could have rushed her debut album. Instead, she took her time with Missunderstood, and it shows.\" Ultimately, Kellman gave the album a rating of 4 stars out of 5.\nCommercial performance\nMissunderstood debuted at number one on the US Top R&B Albums chart, earning 34,000 album-equivalent units in its first week, according to MRC Data.
