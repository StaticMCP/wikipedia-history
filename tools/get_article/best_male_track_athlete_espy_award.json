Beginning in 2007, this award was combined with the parallel Best Female Track Athlete ESPY Award into the single Best Track and Field Athlete ESPY Award.\nBetween 1993 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter was exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.\nThrough the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter were conferred in June and reflected performance from the June previous.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Athlete\n!Nation represented\n!Event(s) contested\n|-\n|1993\n|Kevin Young\n|\n|400-metre hurdles\n|-\n|1994\n|Michael Johnson\n|\n|200 metres, 400 metres, 4 × 400-metre relay\n|-\n|1995\n|Dennis Mitchell\n|\n|100 metres, 4 × 100-metre relay\n|-\n|1996\n|Michael Johnson\n|\n|200 metres, 400 metres, 4 × 400-metre relay\n|-\n|1997\n|Michael Johnson\n|\n|200 metres, 400 metres, 4 × 400-metre relay\n|-\n|1998\n|Wilson Kipketer\n|\n|800 metres\n|-\n|1999\n|Maurice Greene\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100-metre relay\n|-\n|2000\n|Michael Johnson\n|\n|200 metres, 400 metres, 4 × 400-metre relay\n|-\n|2001\n|Maurice Greene\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100-metre relay\n|-\n|2002\n|Maurice Greene\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100-metre relay\n|-\n|2003\n|Tim Montgomery\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres, 4 × 100-metre relay\n|-\n|2004\n|Tom Pappas\n|\n|Decathlon\n|-\n|2005\n|No award presented\n|\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|Justin Gatlin\n|\n|100 metres, 200 metres\n|-\n|2007\n|Jeremy Wariner\n|\n|400 metres\n|}\nSee also\n*Best Female Track Athlete ESPY Award\n*European Athlete of the Year Award\n*IAAF Athlete of the Year Award\n*IAAF Golden League\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.espn.com/espn/news/story?id=3493330 2008 ESPY results]"
