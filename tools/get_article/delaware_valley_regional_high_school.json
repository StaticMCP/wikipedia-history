As a Type II school district, the board's trustees are elected directly by the voters in the constituent municipalities to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with three seats up for election each year held (since 2012) as part of the November general election. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the district's day-to-day operations and a business administrator to supervise the business functions of the district. The nine seats on the board are allocated based on population so that three members are elected from Holland Township, two each from both Alexandria Township and Kingwood Township, and one each from both Frenchtown and Milford.\nThe district is funded based on the equalized valuation of real property in all of the constituent municipalities. Representatives from Alexandria Township, Kingwood Township and Milford had argued that the each municipality should pay taxes commensurate with the district's cost per pupil multiplied by the number of students sent from each community.\nNotable alumni\n* Mary DeChambres, film and television editor\n* Billy Pauch Jr. (born 1987), professional stock car racing driver\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.dvrhs.org/ Delaware Valley Regional High School]\n*\n*[https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_list.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=3403750 Data for Delaware Valley Regional High School], National Center for Education Statistics"
