Green dots represent natural sites, the red dot is a cultural site.|float=right|width=250}}\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Cameroon accepted the convention on December 7, 1987, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. , Cameroon has three World Heritage Sites, one of them Sangha Trinational it's shared with the countries of Central African Republic and Republic of the Congo.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Dja Faunal Reserve\n|\n|East Region, South Region\n| 407; ix, x (natural)\n|1987\n|This is one of the largest and best-protected rainforests in Africa, with 90% of its area left undisturbed. Almost completely surrounded by the Dja River, which forms a natural boundary, the reserve is especially noted for its biodiversity and a wide variety of primates. It contains 107 mammal species, five of which are threatened.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF|Sangha Trinational\n|\n| East Region\n| 1380rev; ix, x (natural)\n|2012\n|Situated in the north-western Congo Basin, where Cameroon, Central African Republic and Congo meet, the site encompasses three contiguous national parks totalling around 750,000 ha. Much of the site is unaffected by human activity and features a wide range of humid tropical forest ecosystems with rich flora and fauna, including Nile crocodiles and goliath tigerfish, a large predator. Forest clearings support herbaceous species and Sangha is home to considerable populations of forest elephants, critically endangered western lowland gorilla, and endangered chimpanzee. The site’s environment has preserved the continuation of ecological and evolutionary processes on a huge scale and great biodiversity, including many endangered animal species.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Diy-Gid-Biy Cultural Landscape of the Mandara Mountains\n|\n| Far North Region\n| 1745; iii (cultural)\n| 2025\n|Located in the Far North Region of Cameroon, the property includes sixteen archaeological sites across seven villages. Known as Diy-Gid-Biy (meaning “Ruin of the Chief’s Residence” in the Mafa language), these dry-stone architectural structures were likely built between the 12th and 17th centuries. While their original builders remain unknown, the area has been inhabited by the Mafa people since the 15th century. The surrounding landscape features agricultural terraces, homes, tombs, places of worship, and artisan activities, reflecting a long-standing cultural and spiritual connection between the people and their environment.\n|}\nTentative List\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Cameroon has listed sixteen properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Boumba Bek and Nki National Parks Complex\n|\n|East Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|vii, ix, x\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bouba Njida National Park\n|\n|North Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Campo Ma'an National Park\n|\n|South Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|vii, viii, ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Waza National Park\n|\n|Farth North Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |The Bahut chiefdom\n|\n|Northwest Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|i, iii, v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Tower of Goto Goulfey\n|\n|Farth North Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|i, iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bidzar petroglyphs\n|\n|North Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|i (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Megaliths of Djohong\n|\n|Centre Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|i, iv, v (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Megaliths of Saa\n|\n|Centre Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|iii, iv, v (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Njock Rail Tunnels\n|\n|Centre Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|iv, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Palace of Rey Bouba\n|\n|North Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|i, ii, iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lobé Falls Cultural Landscape\n|\n|South Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|v, vi, vii (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Shum Laka Archaeological Site\n|\n|Northwest Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|iii, iv, v (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |“Grandes Cases” of the traditional chiefdoms of the Grassfields region\n|\n|North Region,  Northwest Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|ii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lake Chad cultural landscape\n|\n|Far North Region\n| align=\"center\" |2018\n|ii, iii, vii, ix (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Cross River-Korup-Takamanda\n|\n|Southwest Region\n| align=\"center\" |2020\n|ix, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Bimbia and associated sites\n|\n|Southwest Region\n| align=\"center\" |2020\n|iii, vi (cultural)\n|\n|}\nReferences"
