Jaguar also kidnapped a young woman named Cynthia. Mike and Jackie must fight through parts of New York City (including Chinatown, Manhattan) to return peace to New York City, and defeat Jaguar to save Cynthia.\nGameplay\nIn Gang Wars, up to two players can control two different characters with different fighting styles. The movements are composed of two attack types—punch and kick—to fight against enemies, plus jumping to overcome obstacles. Players have access to a repertoire of techniques by pushing these buttons individually or in combination. The characters can also pick up weapons for hitting, throwing projectiles and firearms. At the end of each stage the players can customise the characters' three fighting statistics (Power, Speed and Guard) depending on the number of points they have. Higher-end stage scores grant more customisation points.\nReception\nIn Japan, Game Machine listed Gang Wars on their July 15, 1989, issue as being the third-most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles like Golden Axe.\nSee also\n*Ninja Combat\n*Ninja Commando\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/dettaglio_mame.php?game_name=gangwars&search_id=2 Gang Wars] at Arcade Database\n*\n*[http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=gang-wars&page=detail&id=929 Gang Wars] at arcade-history"
