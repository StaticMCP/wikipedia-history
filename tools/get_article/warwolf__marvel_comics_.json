The first was a one-time enemy of Deathlok, while the second and third, Vince Marcus and Martin Reyna, are werewolves and members of S.H.I.E.L.D.\nPublication history\nThe Cybertek incarnation of Warwolf first appeared in Deathlok (vol. 2) #1 and was created by Dwayne McDuffie, Gregory Wright, Denys Cowan, and Mike Manley.\nThe Vince Marcus incarnation of Warwolf first appeared in Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos #1 and was created by Richard Buckler.\nThe Martin Reyna incarnation of Warwolf first appeared in S.H.I.E.L.D. (vol. 3) #9 and was created by Al Ewing and Stefano Caselli.\nFictional character biography\nCybertek version\nWarwolf was created by Billy Hansen and others at Cybertek Systems Inc. (a cybernetic research division of Roxxon) by placing a wolf's brain in a cyborg body. From his imprisonment, Harlan Ryker remotely activates Warwolf and sends it to attack his former superiors, who may testify against him for the creation of Deathlok. Warwolf kills Hansen before breaking into an NSA facility and destroying all records pertaining to Ryker's investigation. Deathlok subdues the Warwolf and euthanizes it after learning that it is undergoing a system failure and that its organic components will fail in six hours.\nVince Marcus\nVince Marcus is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Howling Commandos Monster Force. He infiltrated the Lords of Lightning cult and led the assault on Stonehenge when Merlin threatened to invade Earth.\nMartin Reyna\nMartin Reyna is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and the head of Area 13's S.T.A.K.E. (short for Special Threat Assessment for Known Extranormalities), a division that deals with supernatural events. Reyna also works with Dr. Paul Kraye on secret projects, which he fears will be discovered by Dum Dum Dugan. Both decide that they have to get rid of Dugan before he discovers them.\nSimon Ryker\nAfter surviving a Doombot attack, Simon Ryker encounters Thunderbolt Ross at Project Alpha and now possesses the ability to become a Warwolf.\nPowers and abilities\nThe Cybertek incarnation of Warwolf possesses immense strength, durability, and speed, being able to run at 317&nbsp;mph. It also has eye socket-mounted plasma projectors that release highly destructive beams, but leave it blind when in use and can overload if overused.\nThe Vince Marcus and Martin Reyna incarnations of Warwolf are werewolves who possess superhuman strength, durability, and senses. Marcus' transformations are tied to Mars rather than the Moon, while Reyna can transform at will.\nOther versions\nAn original incarnation of Warwolf from Earth-7484 appears in Astonishing Tales. This version is a cybernetic werewolf created by Simon Ryker from an unidentified human. It battles Deathlok, who ultimately kills it.\nIn other media\n* The Martin Reyna incarnation of Warwolf appears in Hulk: Where Monsters Dwell'', voiced by Edward Bosco.
