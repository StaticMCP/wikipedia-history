Some 25 or 30 Spaniards were killed outright during their initial onslaught. After ransacking the town, they departed with a number of hostages on March 29, 1660. Several hundred Dominican militia cavalrymen had in the interim managed to rally from throughout the district, and prepared an ambush ahead of the French column. The leading two buccaneers were shot dead and a two-hour firefight ensued, before the Dominicans finally broke.\nSee also\n* Battle of Sabana Real\n* Dominican-French War\nReferences\n*"
