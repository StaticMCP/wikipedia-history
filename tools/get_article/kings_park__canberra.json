The park has a number of community and heritage spaces located within it. Kings Park is located adjacent to Commonwealth Park, which lies to its west, with the two parks separated by a red gravel assembly area at the base of Anzac Parade. The area is federally owned, and cared for by the National Capital Authority.\nBlundells Cottage is located within the Kings Park precinct, having been constructed before the parkland was developed.\nSeveral spaces designed for community engagement and enjoyment exist within the Park. The National Carillon, which conducts regular free musical programs, is located on Queen Elizabeth II Island, just off the shore of Kings Park. Boundless, a children's play ground designed to allow easier access for people with disabilities, is located closely to the Police and Workers Memorials.\nMemorial spaces\nKings Park is home to a number of public memorial spaces including the National Police Memorial, National Workers Memorial, National Emergency Services Memorial, Australian Merchant Navy Memorial, Indian Ocean Tsunami Memorial and the HMAS Canberra Memorial.\nThe lake edge includes part of the R G Menzies Walk.

The memorial walk stretches along the northern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, between the Commonwealth and Kings Bridge.\nBoundless Playground\nInstalled for the Centenary of Canberra in 2013, Boundless Playground is designed as an all ability play space for families.
