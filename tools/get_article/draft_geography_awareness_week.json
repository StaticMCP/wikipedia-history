Geography Awareness Week is celebrated during the third week of November and includes public calls for participation in events such as educational programs, community events, poster sessions, talks, and map quizzes. Geography Awareness Week promotes what geography is, why it is important, and preparing citizen to understand the current challenges facing our world.\nHistory\nGeography Awareness Week was created In the 1980s, after several world wide surveys and studies including a 1988 National Geographic Survey   and reports showed that students and young adults in the United States lacked basic geography knowled and ranked near the bottom in international geography tests. Educators and policymakers increased efforts to promote geogrpahic literacy.\nStarted as National Geographic's first public awareness campaign and part of a large scale effort by the National Geographic Society, the American Association of Geographers (AAG), the National Council for Geography Education (NCGE), and the American Geographical Society (AGS) to increase public awareness of and support for geography education continues to be one of the most significant geography education events.  The first Geography Awareness Week event was a year long collaboration in which two schools on opposite sides of the United States, one in Washington, D.C. and one in Los Angeles, exchanged pen pal letters about life and home or 'sense of place'. This event culuminated in a celebratory balloon release with a note to contact National Geographic Association if found. This effort led to President Ronald Reagan and The U.S. Congress designating the week of November 15 through November 21, 1987, as ``Geography Awareness Week' through proclamation by Public Law 100 - 78.   The event has grown over the years into an international celebration of geography such as in 2013 when the Royal Canadian Geographical Society displayed giant floor maps of Canada to promote geography education and create future Canadian explorers. The significance for geography education continued throughout the 1990s and 2000s with continue collaborations between he National Geographic Society, the Association of American Geographers (AAG), the National Council for Geography Education (NCGE), and the American Geographical Society (AGS)  such as the RoadMap for 21st Century Geography Education Project supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF).\nThemes\nThe National Geographic Society, Association of American Geographers, and affilliated organizations select educational themes for Geography Awareness Week to cohesively promote geography awareness, provide educators with geography education and outreach materials, and encourage participating by schools and communities. These themes often align with or shape the celebration of related events such as GIS Day! an annual celebration of geographic information systems (GIS) which falls midweek during Geography Awareness Week and promotes geography and geospatial technologies awareness.
