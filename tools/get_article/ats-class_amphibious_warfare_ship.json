More details will be released in the B-letter, which is expected in 2025. With the D-letter following in 2027, after which contract signing will take place. The first ship is planned to be in service by 2032, with the next five being commissioned with one year intervals. The intended builder was announced to be the Damen Group.\nUK-Dutch cooperation\nIn June 2023, the Netherlands and British governments announced that the two countries would \"explore opportunities\" to jointly develop new specialist amphibious warships.\nHowever, in March 2024, this effort was reportedly abandoned as the two countries identified that their requirements and budgets were too different for a single design. Instead they would focus on Anglo-Dutch coordination on subsystems, landing craft, and aviation. With the British continuing with their MRSS program. One key difference was the ships' ability to operate independently without an escort. This was a British preference which would require more substantial self-defence capability.\nSee also\n* Future of the Royal Netherlands Navy\n*\n*\nCitations\nFurther reading\n*"
