She is the eldest daughter of actress Lakshmi and Bhaskaran.\nCareer\nAishwariyaa's first film was Oliyampukal (1991), followed by Mamagaru (1991), Rasukutty (1992) and Meera (1992). She played a double role in Butterflies (1993) and also made her Hindi debut in Gardish (1993), which was a remake of the Malayalam movie Kireedam. Early in her career, she turned down opportunity to work with Mani Ratnam in Thiruda Thiruda (1993).\nFollowing her marriage in 1994, Aishwariyaa quit the film industry and chose to prioritise bringing up a family. However her marriage fell apart and she became addicted to drugs as a result of her husband's addiction, which made it difficult for her to re-enter the film industry after her divorce in 1996. After undergoing a rehabilitation process, she chose to continue her education in computer science and joined to work with the NIIT in 1997 and prioritised her work as a software engineer. She then accepted an offer to be a part of a television show produced by Suresh Chandra Menon, after being convinced by her friend, actress Revathi. After a four-year sabbatical from films as a result of her marriage, childbirth and divorce, Aishwariyaa made a comeback in R. Parthiban's House Full (1999) portraying an inspector-in-charge of the bomb disposal squad. She continued to portray supporting roles in films such as Suyamvaram (1999), Sathyameva Jayathe (2000) and Narasimham (2000) during the turn of the century.\nPersonal life\nAishwariyaa was born as Shanta Meena to Bhaskaran and actress Lakshmi. She has a stepsister (Samyuktha) from her mother's third marriage with Sivachandran.\nShe was married to Tanveer Ahmed in 1994 and later divorced him in 1996. The couple have a daughter born in 1995.\nFilmography\n;As actress\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Film !! Role !!
