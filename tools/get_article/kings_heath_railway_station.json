It was originally opened in 1840 before being closed to passengers in 1941.\nHistory\nThe station was built on the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway's mainline (now the Camp Hill line) on the border of Kings Heath and Moseley, adjacent to Highbury Park. Upon opening it was called Moseley station, however in 1867 the opening of a new upline station of the same name closer to the centre of Moseley caused the station to be renamed 'Kings Heath'.\nThe station finally closed to passengers on 27 January 1941 due to the Second World War, although it was used as a goods station and coal yard into the late 1960s. It was demolished at some point thereafter. The site of the goods facilities is now a small industrial estate and retail park.\nStation masters\n*G. Potter 1860—1872\n*W. Sibley 1872—1874\n*A. Nowell 1874—1875\n*H. Wells 1875—1877\n*George Stroud 1877—1904\n*John H. Brayne 1904—1914(formerly station master at Selly Oak)\n*J.W. Varty 1930—1936\n*Harry Snary 1937—1941(also station master at Hazelwell from 1937)\nReopening\nSince the late 2000s, proposals have been made to re-open the station, along with others on the Camp Hill line, for passenger use.\nIn 2019, the project to re-open the stations at Moseley, Kings Heath, and Hazelwell received £15 million in Government funding, with construction due to start in 2020 and aimed for completion in time for the 2022 Commonwealth Games, though this was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. In March 2021 it was announced that funding had been found for the project, with an opening date expected in 2023.\nConstruction work on the three new stations started in late 2022. The reopening of the line has been hit by delays and the West Midlands Combined Authority is now aiming to reopen the station for passenger use by early 2026.\nIt was announced in the Birmingham Mail that the station would receive the running-in board that was removed from the old station's signal box when the goods facilities were closed and the box switched out.\n|next=|route=Birmingham andGloucester Railway|col=99998D}}\n|next=|route=Midland RailwayCamp Hill line|col=}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://www.tfwm.org.uk/who-we-are/what-we-do/rail-projects/camp-hill-line-stations/ Camp Hill Line Stations Webpage]"
