To read about the background to these events, see History of India. Also see the list of governors-general of India, list of prime ministers of India and list of years in India.\nPre-historic India\nPre-90th century BCE (BC)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n|4,000,000 – 100,000 BCE\n| || Tools crafted by proto-humans that have been dated back two million years have been discovered in the northwestern subcontinent. The earliest archaeological site in the subcontinent is the palaeolithic hominid site in the Soan River valley. Soanian sites are found in the Sivalik region across what are now India, Pakistan, and Nepal. Some of the Bhimbetka rock shelters were inhabited by Homo erectus more than 100,000 years ago.\nEvidence suggested that occupation of the Indian subcontinent by hominins was sporadic until circa 700,000 years ago, and was geographically widespread by around 250,000 years ago.\nMadrasian culture sites have been found in Attirampakkam (Attrambakkam=13° 13' 50\", 79° 53' 20\"), which is located near Chennai (formerly known as Madras), Tamil Nadu. Thereafter, tools related to this culture have been found at various other locations in this region. Bifacial handaxes and cleavers are typical assemblages recovered of this culture. Flake tools, microliths and other chopping tools have also been found. Most of these tools were composed of the metamorphic rock quartzite. The stone tool artifacts in this assemblage have been identified as a part of the second inter-pluvial period in India.\nEvidence for presence of Hominins with Acheulean technology 150,000–100,000 BCE in Tamil Nadu.\n|-\n|74,000 – 30,000 BCE\n|\n|Technology similar to contemporary artifacts found used by Homo sapiens in Africa found in Jwalapuram around 74,000 BCE.\nPaleolithic industries in South India Tamil Nadu 30,000 BCE.\n|}\n90th–50th century BCE\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event\n|-\n|9,000 BCE\n| || Early Neolithic culture with first confirmed semi-permanent settlements appeared 11,000 years ago in the Bhimbetka rock shelters in modern Madhya Pradesh, India.
