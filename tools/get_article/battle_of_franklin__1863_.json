It was a minor engagement in about the same location as that of the more famous Battle of Franklin (November 30, 1864), which was part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign.\nBattle\nThe 1863 engagement at Franklin was a reconnaissance in force by Confederate cavalry leader Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn, coupled with an inept response by Union Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger. Van Dorn advanced northward from Spring Hill, Tennessee, on April 10, making contact with Federal skirmishers just outside Franklin. Van Dorn's attack was so weak that when Granger received a false report that Brentwood to the north was under attack, he believed it and sent most of his cavalry northward thinking that Van Dorn was undertaking a diversion.\nWhen the truth became known&mdash;there was no threat to Brentwood&mdash;Granger decided to attack Van Dorn, but was surprised to learn that a subordinate had already done so, without orders. Brig. Gen. David S. Stanley, with a brigade from the 4th U.S. Cavalry, had crossed the Harpeth River at Hughes's Ford, behind the Confederate right rear. Stanley attacked and captured Freeman's Tennessee Battery on the Lewisburg Road, but lost it when Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest counterattacked. This incident in his rear caused Van Dorn to cancel his operations and withdraw to Spring Hill, leaving the Federals in control of the area.\nBattlefield today\nFort Granger, named after Gordon Granger, is located in Franklin in Pinkerton Park on Murfreesboro Road.\nSee also\n*Battle of Franklin (1863) order of battle\nReferences\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516174018/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/tn016.htm National Park Service battle description]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108210848/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/TennesseeBattlefieldProfiles/Fort%20Pillow%20to%20FranklinII.pdf CWSAC report update]"
