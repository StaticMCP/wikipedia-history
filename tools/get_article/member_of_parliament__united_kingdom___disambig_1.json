Since the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, Parliament is automatically dissolved once five years have elapsed from its first meeting after an election.\nIf a vacancy arises at another time, due to death or resignation, then a constituency vacancy may be filled by a by-election. Under the Representation of the People Act 1981 any MP sentenced to over a year in jail automatically vacates their seat. For certain types of lesser acts of wrongdoing, the Recall of MPs Act 2015 mandates that a recall petition be opened; if signed by more than 10% of registered voters within the constituency, the seat is vacated and a by-election is held.\nEligibility\nIn the past, only male adult property owners could stand for Parliament. In 1918, women acquired the right to stand for Parliament, and to vote.\nTo be eligible to stand as an MP, a person must be at least 18 years old and be a citizen of the UK, a Commonwealth nation, or Ireland. A person is not required to be registered to vote, nor are there any restrictions regarding where a candidate is a resident.\nThe House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 outlaws the holders of various positions from being MPs. These include civil servants, regular police officers (but not special constables), regular members of the armed forces (but not reservists), and some judges. Members of the House of Lords were not permitted to hold Commons seats until the passing of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014, which allows retired or resigned members of the House of Lords to stand or re-stand as MPs. Members of legislatures outside of the Commonwealth are excluded, with the exemption of the Irish legislature. Additionally, members of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) or the Northern Ireland Assembly are also ineligible for the Commons according to the Wales and Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts respectively, passed in 2014 (but members of the Scottish Parliament are eligible).\nPeople who are bankrupt cannot stand to be MPs. The Representation of the People Act 1981 excludes persons who are currently serving a prison sentence of a year or more. People in respect of whom a bankruptcy restrictions order has effect are disqualified from (existing) membership of the House of Commons (details differ slightly in different countries).\nMembers are not permitted to resign their seats. In practice, however, they always can. Should a member wish to resign from the Commons, they may request appointment to one of two ceremonial Crown offices: that of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or that of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. These offices are sinecures (that is, they involve no actual duties); they exist solely to permit the \"resignation\" of members of the House of Commons. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is responsible for making the appointment, and, by convention, never refuses to do so when asked by a member who desires to leave the House of Commons.\nTitle\nMembers of Parliament are entitled to use the post-nominal initials MP. MPs are referred to as \"honourable\" as a courtesy only during debates in the House of Commons (e.g., \"the honourable member for ...\"), or if they are the children of peers below the rank of marquess (\"the honourable [first name] [surname]\"). Those who are members of the Privy Council use the form The Right Honourable (The Rt Hon.) Name MP.\nResponsibilities\n)}}\nTheoretically, contemporary MPs are considered to have two duties, or three if they belong to a political party. Their primary responsibility is to act in the national interest. They must also act in the interests of their constituents, where this does not override their primary responsibility. Finally, if they belong to a political party, they may act in the interests of that party, subordinate to the other two responsibilities. In practice, however, the third responsibility takes precedence during voting due to a strong whipping system.\nSee also\n* Constituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom\n* List of MPs elected in the 2024 United Kingdom general election\n* List of MPs elected in the 2019 United Kingdom general election\n* Member of the Scottish Parliament\n* Member of the Senedd\n* Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
