The princes, who controlled the entire maritime coast, imposed an economic blockade on Imereti, leading to a famine which affected Kutaisi, the royal capital. Meanwhile, the high noble Paata Tsulukidze, a close ally of King George III, betrayed his overlord and joined Mingrelia, where he became the vizier of Levan II.\nTo put an end to this rebellion, King George III in turn gathered his troops and launched an offensive against Levan in winter 1623. On December 9, the troops clashed near the village of Gochouri, where the royal forces were defeated. Following his defeat, George III returned to his capital, while many Imeretians soldiers were taken hostage by the rebels until a ransom was paid by the king. While a common practice amongst the Mongols and Seljuks, Levan was the first in the Caucausus to extensively take hostages for ransom, making raiding a profitable venture and reintroducing it on Georgian battlefields as a lucrative practice, a practice that would be used during the 17th century.\nAftermath\nShortly after the victory of Mingrelia, Levan II Dadiani continued his military expansion by confronting his western allies, the Abkhazians. He accused his wife, Tamunia Sharvashidze, of adultery with his vizier Paata Tsulukidze and had her nose and ears cut off, before sending Tsolukidze under the supervision of the Prince of Guria. With his army, Dadiani escorted Tamunia into Abkhazia and devastated the territories of his father-in-law, while imprisoning his two sons.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
