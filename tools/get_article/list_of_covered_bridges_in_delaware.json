There are only three authentic covered bridges in the U.S. state of Delaware of which two are historic.  A covered bridge is considered authentic not due to its age, but by its construction. An authentic bridge is constructed using trusses rather than other methods such as stringers, a popular choice for non-authentic covered bridges.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n! class=unsortable |Image\n!
