It received positive reviews from critics.\nSummary\nThe film documents the life of songwriter Howard Ashman, who wrote the lyrics for the songs in the Disney animated films The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, as well as the stage musical, Little Shop of Horrors, and died from his HIV/AIDS positive diagnosis in 1991.\nThe film uses the same interview presentation as Hahn's previous documentary, Waking Sleeping Beauty, where rather than \"talking heads\", audio interviews are used with \"speech bubbles\" indicating who is speaking.\nMusic\nAlan Menken composed the score for the film, while Chris Bacon adapted it. Menken, who worked with Ashman on several projects until the latter's passing, first became involved with the project during the 2017–18 Christmas season; when Hahn showed a reel of the movie to Menken, he told Hahn that \"[he has] to score this movie\". Hahn originally opposed, as the budget wouldn't allow him to pay Menken, but agreed once Menken told Hahn that he saw the project as his opportunity to create a musical homage to Ashman. According to Hahn, Menken composed the score during the holiday season, and describe his score as \"one of the most personal and touching scores that [he had heard] from him\". Menken said that he wanted to \"find a motif that simply expressed [his] feelings about Howard\". Menken also said that the score has \"a childlike quality to it, certainly, a simplicity to it. There's a certain shimmering and anticipation of a door opening and what happens just before it's revealed - this thing [Hahn has] created\".\nRelease\nHoward premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival and was nominated for the Best Documentary Award at the 2018 Heartland Film Festival. It had a limited theatrical run beginning on December 18, 2018.\nStreaming\nHoward was released on Disney+ on August 7, 2020. On May 18, 2023, it was announced that Disney+ would be removing nearly 60 original films and series from the platform on May 26 to \"cut costs,\" with this film being one of them. The news sparked widespread backlash from both Disney fans and the LGBTQ+ community, especially with the move coming on the eve of Pride Month and the release of the live-action remake of The Little Mermaid on the same day as its intended removal. Disney+ announced the following day that the film will remain on the service.\nReception\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 94% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of .
