He competed in the men's 100 metres and the men's 200 metres at the 1936 Summer Olympics.\nMcPhee was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, but moved to Vancouver when he was less than a year old.\nHe represented Canada at the 1936 Olympics, and he was heralded by the Canadian press as \"the fastest runner in Canada after Percy Williams,\" who won the men's 100 metres and men's 200 metres dashes at Amsterdam in 1928. McPhee competed in the 100-metre and 200-metre sprints, making it to the semi-finals in both events. His failure to qualify for the finals was attributed to his inability to adjust to the difference in climate.\nMcPhee graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1936. He was a physical education instructor at Grand Forks High School, and he also played rugby for Vancouver. During a Vancouver English rugby game in 1939, \"McPhee ran 106 yards for a score, believed by Rugby officials to be a world record.\"\nIn August 1940, he married Lillian Brown of Vancouver. He died on the evening of Friday, November 29, 1940, following \"a complete breakdown\" brought about by what may have been a brain aneurysm\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
