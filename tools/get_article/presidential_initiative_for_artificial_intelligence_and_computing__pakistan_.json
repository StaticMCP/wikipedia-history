However, students need to be present for exams onsite in order to enroll into the program and for examinations throughout the course of study The program has an initial target to enroll as many as 100,000 students within a year. After a successful launch in Karachi with 12,000 students enrolling, PIAIC have started registering students in other major cities like Islamabad and Faisalabad and soon plan on offering programs in Lahore, Quetta, and Peshawar.\nJavaid Laghari has lamented standards of IT education in Pakistan, including the PIAIC, for not being on par with the developed world. He argues that this has led to low IT exports, especially in high-tech services. While praising the PIAIC as a \"good start\" for \"training a large number of coders\", he criticises it as providing too little instruction per week and getting poor reviews.\nThis initiative is a privately funded not-for-profit educational program that has partnership with non-profit and for-profit organizations like Panacloud, Saylani Welfare International Trust, and Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX)\nReferences"
