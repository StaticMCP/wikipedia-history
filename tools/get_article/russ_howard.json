He lived in Moncton, New Brunswick, from 2000 to 2019. Known for his gravelly voice, Howard has been to the Brier 14 times (8 as Ontario, 6 as New Brunswick), winning the title twice (both as Ontario).  He is also a two-time world champion, winning in 1987 and 1993. He has also won three TSN Skins Games in 1991, 1992, and 1993, and participated in two Canadian Mixed Curling Championships in 2000 and 2001. He won gold at the 2006 Winter Olympics. He played in two Canadian Senior Curling Championships in 2008 and 2009 finishing with a silver medal both of those years. Russ Howard was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. He is currently a curling analyst and commentator for TSN’s Season of Champions curling coverage.\nCareer\nIn 2005, he joined team Gushue to call the shots for Brad Gushue's team at the Canadian Olympic Trials, while he played second. Howard, along with Gushue (who throws last rocks), lead Jamie Korab and third Mark Nichols, went on to win the trials, giving them the right to represent Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics, where they won the gold medal, defeating Finland 10–4 in the final match. It was the first time that a Canadian team had won the gold medal for men's curling. Howard, who turned 50 during the Olympics, is also the oldest Canadian to win an Olympic gold medal. The oldest person ever to win a gold medal was Robin Welsh, aged 54, who won gold in curling at the 1924 Winter Olympics.\nAs a skip (captain), Howard has been in three previous trials (in 1987, 1997, and 2001), but never went on to the Olympics. Howard is also the innovator of the \"Moncton Rule\", which evolved into the \"free guard zone\", part of international and Olympic rules. This makes his 2006 medal particularly significant, as it is likely that without the excitement this rule adds to the sport it would not have become an Olympic event in the 1990s.\nIn the 2009-10 curling season, although he played in bonspiels throughout the year, Howard did not curl in the New Brunswick Tankard due to his broadcasting commitments with The Sports Network (TSN).  Howard has been commentating curling events for TSN since 2001.\nIn 2006, he was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame. In 2013, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada and inducted into the WCF Hall of Fame in 2015.\nBrier records\nAt the end of the 2009 Brier, Howard had appeared in more Briers than any other player (14), and played more games at the Brier than any other player (174). The 2012 Brier saw his brother Glenn Howard tying his record for Brier appearances and breaking his record for most career games played at the Brier. As of 2017, Russ had appeared in the second most Brier games ever, behind his brother Glenn.\nBroadcasting career\nHoward stepped into the broadcast booth for the first time in 2001, serving as an analyst for TSN’s coverage of the Brier. Since 2008, he has been a mainstay analyst on the network, also providing colour commentary for TSN’s Season of Champions curling.\nHoward handled colour commentating duties for Canada’s Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium during the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games.\nPersonal life\nHoward's grand-aunt, Jean Thompson, was an Olympic runner. His brother, Glenn Howard, is also a well known curler. Howard's daughter, Ashley Howard, is a competitive curler and the executive director of CurlSask, the governing body of curling in Saskatchewan.\nOutside of curling, Howard worked as a real estate agent for Royal LePage Atlantic, in addition to his commentator work with TSN, and as a curling coach in Switzerland. He moved to Regina, Saskatchewan in 2019 to be closer to his children.\nTeams\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Season\n! scope=\"col\"| Skip\n! scope=\"col\"| Third\n! scope=\"col\"| Second\n! scope=\"col\"| Lead\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1979–80\n| Russ Howard || Larry Merkley || Robert Ruston || Kent Carstairs\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1985–86\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Tim Belcourt || Kent Carstairs\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1986–87\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Tim Belcourt || Kent Carstairs\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1988–89\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Tim Belcourt || Kent Carstairs\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1989–90\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Wayne Middaugh || Peter Corner\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1990–91\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Wayne Middaugh || Peter Corner\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1991–92\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Wayne Middaugh || Peter Corner\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1992–93\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Wayne Middaugh || Peter Corner\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1993–94\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Wayne Middaugh || Peter Corner\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1994–95\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Peter Corner || Ken McDermot\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1995–96\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Peter Corner || Noel Herron\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1996–97\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Scott Patterson || Phil Loevenmark\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1997–98\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard || Noel Herron || Steve Small\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1998–99\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard  Wayne Tallon || Peter Corner  Rick Perron || Neil Harrison  Grant Odishaw\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 1999–00\n| Russ Howard || Glenn Howard  Wayne Tallon || Peter Corner  Rick Perron || Neil Harrison  Grant Odishaw\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2000–01\n| Russ Howard || James Grattan || Rick Perron || Grant Odishaw\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2001–02\n| Russ Howard || James Grattan || Marc LeCocq || Grant Odishaw\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2002–03\n| Russ Howard || James Grattan || Marc LeCocq || Grant Odishaw\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2003–04\n| Russ Howard || James Grattan || Marc LeCocq || Grant Odishaw\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2004–05\n| Russ Howard || James Grattan || Grant Odishaw || Marc LeCocq\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2005\n| Russ Howard || Mark Dobson || Steven Howard || Grant Odishaw\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2005–06\n| Brad Gushue (fourth) || Mark Nichols || Russ Howard (skip) || Jamie Korab\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2006–07\n| Russ Howard || Grant Odishaw || Mark Dobson || Steven Howard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2007–08\n| Russ Howard || Grant Odishaw || Mark Dobson || Steven Howard\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2008–09\n| Russ Howard || James Grattan || Jason Vaughan || Peter Case\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2009–10\n| Russ Howard || James Grattan || Jason Vaughan || Peter Case\n|}\nPublications\nHoward has released two books: Hurry Hard: The Russ Howard Story (2007), an autobiography that vividly describes his journey to becoming an Olympic gold medallist, and Curl to Win (2008).\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
