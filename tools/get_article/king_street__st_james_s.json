It runs south-west to north-east from St James's Street to St James's Square.\nHistory\nKing Street was probably named after Charles II, and is first mentioned in ratebooks in 1673, having been known before as Charles Street.\nThe 1200-seat St James's Theatre on the corner with Duke Street opened in 1835, but was demolished in 1957, despite widespread protests.\nNotable occupiers include the principal London premises of the auctioneers Christie's, and Palamon Capital Partners.\nReferences\nExternal links"
