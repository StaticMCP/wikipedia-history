Article 67 of the Constitution of India provides that the vice president of India shall remain in office for a period of five years. According to Clause 2 of Article 68 of the Constitution, an election to fill a vacancy in the office of the vice president occurring due to his death, resignation or removal, or otherwise shall be held \"as soon as possible\" from the date of the vacancy. This is the first early election for the office since 1987.\nAt around 19:30 IST, returning officer Pramod Chandra Mody declared NDA candidate C. P. Radhakrishnan elected. He won by a margin of 152 votes, the narrowest in a vice presidential election since 2002.\nElectoral system\nThe Vice President is elected by an electoral college which includes members of the Rajya Sabha and of the Lok Sabha using instant-runoff voting. The nominated members of the upper house are also eligible to vote in the election process.
