When the Soviet Union disintegrated, the Mari ASSR became the Mari El Republic, a federal subject of the Russian Federation.\nHistory\nThe Mari Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed on 5 December 1936, according to the USSR Constitution of 1936 as a result of the transformation of the Mari Autonomous Oblast (region), created on 4 November 1920, as an autonomous territorial entity for the Mountain Mari and Meadow Mari people. The Mari people initially welcomed the creation of this autonomous oblast because they believed it would lead to the Soviet Union protecting their language and pagan way of life from Christian encroachment. However, under Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union enforced Russian as the official language on the Mari ASSR and marginalised their religious practices. Stalin also implemented collective farming in the 1930s and forced Maris to leave their villages to work on them to further erode Mari culture.\nOn 22 October 1990, by decision of the , it was transformed into the Mari Soviet Socialist Republic (MSSR). On May 24, 1991, the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR approved this decision, amending the Constitution of the RSFSR of 1978.\nOn 9 December 1992, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation renamed the Mari SSR into the Republic of Mari El, amending Article 71 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. This amendment entered into force from the moment of publication in the \"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\" on 12 January 1993.\nAdministrative divisions\nThe Mari ASSR included 14 regions.\nOn the territory of the Mari ASSR there were three cities (Yoshkar-Ola, Volzhsk, Kozmodemyansk) and 14 urban-type settlements.\nNational composition\nAccording to the 1970 census:\n*Russians – 321,000 (46.9%)\n*Mari – 299,000 (43.6%)\n*Tatars – 40,000 (5.8%)\n*Chuvash – 9,000 (1.3%)\n*Ukrainians – 5,000 (0.7%)\n* Others – 11,000 (1.7%)\nSee also\n*Mari Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\nReferences"
