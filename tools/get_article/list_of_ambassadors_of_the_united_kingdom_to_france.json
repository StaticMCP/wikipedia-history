The official title is 'His Majesty's Ambassador to France'.\nTraditionally, the Embassy to France has been the most prestigious posting in the British foreign service, although in past centuries, diplomatic representation was lacking due to wars between the two countries and the Nazi occupation.\nFor the period before the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801, see List of ambassadors of the Kingdom of England to France (up to 1707) and List of ambassadors of Great Britain to France (from 1707 to 1800).\nThe Paris embassy also covers remotely the French overseas territories (including French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Réunion, French Polynesia, Mayotte, Wallis and Futuna, New Caledonia, Saint-Barthélemy) and Monaco.\nBesides the embassy, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office maintains consulates in Bordeaux and Marseille in southern France.\nBritish ambassadors and ministers to France\nby François Gérard, 1814.
