His parents were Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, (1272–1315), Warwick) and Alice de Toeni, later Countess of Warwick, who had seven children, including John. Towards the end of his life he resided in the parish of St. Andrew, near Baynard's Castle, City of London. He bequeathed his house to the King, who had it converted for use as his great wardrobe. A bachelor, he died without issue and his barony expired.  His remains were interred, between two pillars, before the image of the Virgin, on the south side of the nave of Old St Paul's Cathedral, where there was a monument to his memory, incorrectly later known as ''Duke Humphrey's Tomb'', because of the mistaken belief that it was the tomb of Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester. The grave and monument were destroyed along with the old cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666. A modern monument in the crypt lists Beauchamp as one of the important graves lost.\nEarly naval career\nJohn de Beauchamp KG. He displays the arms of Beauchamp on his tabard, with a crescent sable for difference.\nHe attended King Edward III into Flanders in 1338, was in the array at Buironfosse in 1339, and shared the glory of the great naval victory off Sluys in 1340. He carried the Royal Standard at the Battle of Crécy in 1346 and was present at the siege and surrender of Calais, of which town he was appointed captain in 1348 a post he held for two years before his first appointment to a senior command role.\nSenior command\nArms of Sir John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp KG -- gules, a fess between six cross crosslets or, a mullet for difference\nIn 1350, he was appointed Admiral of the Fleet off Calais also known as the Southern Fleet; five years later on 5 March 1355 he was given command of the Western Sea's Fleet, a post he held till 1 March 1356. He was appointed 'Admiral of the King's Southern, Northern and Western Fleets' on 18 July 1360. The appointment gave the command of the English navy to one person for the first time; the post would evolve into the post of Admiral of the Fleet; he also held the posts of Constable of the Tower of London and Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was summoned to Parliament as a baron in 1350.\nMonument in St Paul's Cathedral\nHis chest tomb and recumbent effigy was situated by the tenth column at the west end of Old St Paul's Cathedral and was drawn in 1658 by Wenceslas Hollar, 8 years before its destruction in the Fire of London. The engraving was published in William Dugdale's 1658 work History of St Pauls Cathedral and states that the monument was positioned inter ecclesiae navim et alam australem (\"between the nave of the Church and the south aisle\").\nReferences\nSources\n*  Archives, National The.
