The award was structured to be egalitarian allowing for anyone to nominate a story including readers, authors, editors and publishers; prize money was donated by readers and writers; and the winners were selected by public vote from a short-list of entries selected by judges.\nOverview\nThe Million Writers Award was founded by author Jason Sanford in 2003 at a time when the literary establishment \"didn't believe online magazines were legitimate places to publish fiction,\" seeing it as a fad. Sanford set out to honor and highlight online only publications and stories with the award.\nStories eligible for the award include those first published in online literary journals, magazines, and e-zines that have an editorial process. The award had a variable cash prize, in 2011 for example it was $600 for the winner, $200 for the runner-up and $100 for third place. Prize money was raised through donations from writers, editors and readers and thus fluctuates each year. Anyone could nominate up to one story, while editors and publishers can nominate three stories. Stories must be at least 1000 words.\nThe award became one of the premier online literary awards and was named a Hot Site by USA Today. The award was profiled in a six-page feature interview with editor Jason Sanford in the ''2005 Novel and Short Story Writer's Market and mentioned in ''The 100 Best Trends, 2006: Emerging Developments You Can't Afford to Ignore as an example of the emerging online literary movement.\nIn 2012 Spotlight Publishing released two anthologies of stories from the Million Writers Award, with one focused on literary stories and the other on science fiction and fantasy stories.\nWinners\nPrevious winners.\n2003\n*Top 10 stories:\n2004\n*Best story: Randa Jarrar, \"You Are a 14-Year-Old Arab Chick Who Just Moved to Texas\" (Eyeshot)\n*Best online publication: Eclectica\n*Best publisher of novella-length fiction: The King's English\n*Best new online magazine or journal: Narrative Magazine\n2005\n*Best story: Alicia Gifford, \"Toggling the Switch\" (Narrative Magazine)\n*Best story runner-up: Terry Bisson, \"Super 8\" (Scifiction.com)\n*Best story runner-up: Anjana Basu, \"The Black Tongue\" (Gowanus)\n*Best online publication: Strange Horizons\n*Best publisher of novella-length fiction: The King's English\n*Best new online magazine or journal: Anderbo''\n2006\n*Best story: Richard Bowes, \"There's a Hole in the City\" (Scifiction.com)\n*Best story runner-up: Michael Croley, \"Two Lives\" (Blackbird)\n*Best online publication: Storyglossia\n*Best publisher of novella-length fiction: Narrative Magazine (co-winner)\n*Best publisher of novella-length fiction: ''The King's English (co-winner)\n*Best new online magazine or journal: Menda City Review (co-winner)\n*Best new online magazine or journal: Clarkesworld Magazine (co-winner)\n2007\n*Best story: Catherynne M.
