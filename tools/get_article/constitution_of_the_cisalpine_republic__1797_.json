      "text": "# Constitution of the Cisalpine Republic (1797)\n\nThe Constitution of the Cisalpine Republic (), was the first constitution of the Cisalpine Republic, a sister republic of France under Napoleon Bonaparte, roughly comprising the modern-day northern regions of Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. It came into effect on 20 messidor V (8 July 1797).\nIt established a directorial republic, which effectively was a French puppet. The parliament had an upper house of 60 aldermen and a lower house of 120 members, both appointed by Napoleon. The territory was divided in French-like departments and municipalities. Every noble title was abolished.\nThis constitution did not survive even a year since Napoleon left Italy towards Egypt in 1798.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=GvhBAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA3 Constitution des républiques française, cisalpine et ligurienne] (1799)"
