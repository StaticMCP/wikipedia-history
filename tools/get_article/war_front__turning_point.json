      "text": "# War Front: Turning Point\n\n| genre     = Real-time strategy\n| modes     = Single-player, multiplayer\n| platforms = Microsoft Windows\n}}\nWar Front: Turning Point is a real-time strategy video game set in an alternate World War II. It was developed by Hungarian studio Digital Reality, and published by CDV and released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows.\nThe game is set in a fictional, alternate World War II in which Adolf Hitler is assassinated in the early days of the war, and under the new chancellor, Germany occupies Great Britain. Eventually, Nazi Germany is defeated, but this allows the Soviet Union to advance into Western Europe. The game features both real life and fictional \"experimental\" war machines and units.\nGameplay\nWar Front: Turning Point is a real-time strategy game featuring units going from World War II weaponry such as Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter aircraft and M4 Sherman and T-34 tanks, to real-life units that were not present during that war such as Northrop YB-49 jet bomber, to entirely science fictional units like Exoskeleton mechs, freeze rays and shield generators, while all can build a \"Bridging\" tank unit capable of building bridges over bodies of water. Each faction can also build three heroes: individual characters with unique abilities, both passive and active to benefit the player's own units and act against the foe's units. The longer heroes and units remain on the battlefield, destroying units and buildings in the process, the more they can rank up, increasing their abilities, yet lose them if they are killed and re-built. The player can also use aerial support such as calling in paratrooper reinforcements, scouting runs and bomb strikes.\nWar Front: Turning Point however has an unconventional RTS feature, being the abilities to manually control pill boxes and turrets to fire upon enemies, like that of a first-person shooter. The camera can also be ordered to follow other units in a third-person perspective, where orders can still be given, but the units not be directly controlled like the turrets.\nAlong with the time of day changing dynamically in each game, random weather can affect effectiveness of units and interference. Storms, for example, can damage airplanes, and radars (mini-map view) can become distorted or even temporarily knocked out.\n| 1UP = C\n| EuroG = 7/10\n| GamePro =\n| GSpot = 7.5/10\n| GSpy =\n| GameZone = 7.5/10\n| IGN = 7.8/10\n| MaxPC = 7/10\n| PCGUS = 77%\n| XPlay =\n}}\nThe game received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. X-Play found that the \"alternate history stuff keeps the stale setting interesting without getting completely wacky\", while GameSpot commented on the balance of real-life and fictional units, being a \"good thing because battles remain grounded in real-world combat and don't go overboard with high-tech gadgetry\", going on to say: \"Digital Reality strikes an almost perfect balance here between real history and 'what if?' ruminations\".\nMany reviewers however felt the RTS gameplay was still too conventional, regardless of the subject matter. IGN found that, \"while War Front isn’t anything particularly new, it does traditional very solidly and creates a decent action atmosphere\". PC Gamer similarly agreed by concluding: \"War Front is a solid and entertaining game, though far less original than it purports to be\". Because of the game's traditional RTS formula, Eurogamer reviewed the title while at the same time satires reviews in general by outlining the traditional conventions in most reviews, such as concluding: \"Lazy conclusion? Wrap things up with a witty line that leaves readers grinning. Or, just stop writing in the middl...\"\nGameSpy criticised the first-person shooter aspect for being \"useless in a game that moves so fast\" and even \"may also cause lesser computers to slow to a crawl\". Graphically, GameSpot felt: \"The dark, gritty look of the game makes most levels a treat for the eyes when you're simply gawking at the scenery\" yet at times can be \"so dark and dense with detail that units are obscured\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
