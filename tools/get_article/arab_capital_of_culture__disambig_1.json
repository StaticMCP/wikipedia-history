Jerusalem was unilaterally designated as the capital of the State of Palestine (), officially simply Palestine, by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1988, and again by the Palestinian Legislative Council in May 2002. Palestine is a member of the Arab League and then Secretary-General Amr Moussa supported the Arab ministers' decision that Jerusalem be designated the Arab Capital of Culture for 2009. The city's final status awaits the outcome of future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20060514191731/http://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/IPPP/Fall97Report/negotiating_jerusalem.htm \"Negotiating Jerusalem\", University of Maryland] and Positions on Jerusalem for more information). In the context of the Arab Capital of Culture, the organising committee is Palestinian and the Israeli authorities have discouraged the holding of events in Jerusalem itself.\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141217004645/http://cultureldjazair2007.com/ Algiers Arab Capital of Culture 2007 - Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110805132907/http://damascus.org.sy/ Damascus Arab Capital of Culture 2008 - Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141214024440/http://www.alquds2009.org/ Al-Quds Arab Capital of Culture 2009 - Official website]\n*[http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-476/_nr-1141/i.html East Jerusalem: \"Capital of Arab Culture 2009\"]\n*[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120228152538/http://www.manamaculture2012.bh/en/ Manama Arab Capital of Culture 2012 - Official website]"
