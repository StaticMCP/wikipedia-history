He played for Essex between 1967 and 1972. He later represented Argentina.\nWard played seven seasons for Essex, usually as an opening batsman. He made his highest score against Nottinghamshire in 1970, when he batted five and three-quarter hours for 164 not out and added an unbroken 208 for the third wicket with Keith Fletcher. His most successful season was 1971, when he scored 968 first-class runs at an average of 27.65. Wisden commented at the time that he had made a \"notable advance\" and \"served the side well by patient methods\". After the 1972 season, when he \"was responsible for some stern but nevertheless helpful displays\", he left first-class cricket.\nLater Ward spent some time in Argentina, coaching and playing cricket. He represented the country at the inaugural ICC Trophy in England in 1979, but without personal or team success. He married an Argentine woman and moved to Uruguay.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
