Due to a lack of coordination, difficult terrain, adverse weather conditions, and stiff German resistance, the attack was forced to retreat in late June 1915. Another assault on the capital would not be conducted until later that year.\nReferences\n* Burg, David F., and L. Edward. Purcell. Almanac of World War I.
