The system consists of approximately 14,000 independently owned and operated franchised broker offices in 86 countries and territories worldwide with over 147,000 sales professionals. Century 21 Real Estate is headquartered in Madison, New Jersey.\nHistory\nCentury 21 Real Estate (Century 21) was founded in 1971 by two real estate agents, Art Bartlett and Marsh Fisher, in Orange County, California.\nHere Bartlett reveals how they decided on the name:\n]]\nCentury 21 was acquired by Trans World Corporation in 1979, when Trans World Corporation decided to focus on hospitality and housing. In 1985, MetLife acquired Century 21 from Trans World Corporation. When MetLife decided to leave the housing business, Century 21 was sold to Hospitality Franchise Systems (later Cendant) in 1995. When Cendant split in 2006, Century 21 became part of Realogy, now Anywhere Real Estate.\nThe Joy of Home Campaign\nIn November 2024, Century 21 Real Estate launched \"The Joy of Home,\" a global marketing campaign. Century 21 cited shifts in consumer decision making towards community and connection as motivators behind the campaign, which features \"more humanized\" messaging and visual media.\nLegal cases\nIn 2019, Century 21's parent company Realogy was named as a co-conspirator in multiple class-action lawsuits alleging that it artificially inflated commissions paid by home sellers. In September 2023, it agreed to pay $83.5 million to settle two of the lawsuits. One of the cases, Burnett v. National Association of Realtors, went to trial the following month, where a federal jury found that the parent company did participate in the commissions conspiracy. The settlement agreement removed the requirement for Century 21 real estate agents to belong to the National Association of Realtors.\nSee also\n*Real estate broker\n*Real estate trends\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.century21thailand.com Century 21 Thailand]\n* [https://www.century21.com.au/ Century 21 Australasia]\n* [https://www.century21uk.com/ Century 21 UK]\n* [https://www.century21gibraltar.com/ Century 21 Gibraltar]"
