He served as the 11th bishop of the Diocese of Buffalo in New York from 1973 to 1995. He previously served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York from 1970 to 1973.\nEarly life\nEdward Head was born on August 5, 1919, in White Plains, New York, and was raised in the South Bronx. His parents were Charles and Nellie Head, immigrants from England and Ireland, respectively. Head had two brothers, Charles and Daniel.\nBoth Head attended Catholic parochial schools, then earned a mathematics degree from Columbia University. He entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York, in 1939.\nPriesthood\nHead was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of New York on January 27, 1945 by Cardinal Francis Spellman at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, New York City. Head earned a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work in 1948.\nHead served in many capacities, including as an educator, prior to being appointed auxiliary bishop. He taught sociology at Notre Dame College on Staten Island before serving as assistant pastor at both Sacred Heart Parish in the Bronx and St. Roch's Parish on Staten Island.\nIn September 1947, Head became a staff member of the archdiocesan Catholic Charities Family Service Department. He served an assistant pastor at St. Veronica's Parish in Greenwich Village, New York City, for 17 years while he worked at Catholic Charities.\nHead was named associate director of Family Services in March 1948, serving in that capacity until he became director of social research for Catholic Charities in 1956. Pope John XXIII honored Head in July 1962 by naming him a papal chamberlain. In 1964, Head went to minister at St. Monica's Parish in Manhattan. In May 1966, Head was given the title of domestic prelate by Pope Paul VI.\nIn October 1966, Head was appointed executive director and secretary of Catholic Charities in the archdiocese by Cardinal Terence Cooke. In these capacities Head oversaw nearly 1,000 employees, and administered an annual budget of millions of dollars. Head became a parochial assistant at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1967.\nAuxiliary Bishop of New York\nOn March 19, 1970, Head was consecrated an auxiliary bishop of New York and as titular bishop of Ard Sratha at St. Patrick's Cathedral by Cardinal Terrence Cooke.  Head served, among other assignments, as executive director of Catholic Charities in the archdiocese.\nBishop of Buffalo\nOn January 23, 1973, Head was named as the 11th bishop of Buffalo by Pope Paul VI; and he was installed on March 19, 1973.\nFundraising for Catholic Charities increased by an extreme degree under Head's leadership in the Diocese, including the year of his retirement.\nHead was involved in many activities as bishop of Buffalo. Under his leadership, many institutes and offices were created in the diocese. Many of these endeavors include the Religious Education Coordinators Council; the Priests' Retirement Board; the Center for Church Vocations; the Western New York Catholic Hospital Health Care Council; the Peace and Justice Commission; the Office of Vicar for Religious; and the Permanent Diaconate Program.\nAdditional efforts included the Office of Vicar for Campus Ministry; the Organist Enrichment Program; the Diocesan Marian Commission; the Office of Vicar for the Central City; Daybreak Productions; the Catholic Charities Parish Outreach Program; the Little Portion Friary; the Pope John Paul II Residence; the Agenda for the 80's; the Diocesan Radio Studio; and the Lay Ministry Advisory Board.\nFurther endeavors created and/or supervised by Head included the consolidation of the Catholic Education Department; the Renew Program; the Office of Church Ministry; the relocation and consolidation of Diocesan Offices in the Catholic Center; the Office of Black Ministry; the Hispanic Apostolate; the Commission on Women in the Church and Society; the Department of Pro-Life Activities; the New Visions Commission for Pastoral Planning; the reorganization of 10 Central City parishes; and others.\nIn 1995, on the 50th anniversary of his ordination, Head reflected on his appointment as bishop of Buffalo:\n: In 1973, Pope Paul, VI, could have sent this church of Buffalo a wiser bishop, a holier bishop, a bishop more astute in administration, or a bishop more gifted in public speaking. But, I don't think Pope Paul could have sent the Diocese a bishop who had tried harder to love you and to serve you.\nHead ordained 124 men to the priesthood during his time as bishop of Buffalo. Head reportedly confirmed 50,000 young people in Buffalo.\nRetirement and later life\nPope John Paul II accepted Head's petition to retire as bishop of Buffalo in April 1995. He continued to be active in health care and other ministries throughout his retirement. Prior to his death, Head was honored with the naming of a retirement home for priests, the Bishop Edward D. Head Residence in Lackawanna, New York.\nEdward Head died on March 29, 2005, in Kenmore, New York, at age 85. Bishop Edward Kmiec was quoted in a March 30, 2005, Buffalo News article:\n: This is a day of tremendous sadness for the family of the Diocese of Buffalo. Bishop Head had a tremendous impact on the faith lives of Catholics in the eight counties of Western New York.\nHead is buried in the crypt of St. Joseph Cathedral in Buffalo. He was the first bishop of Buffalo to have retired in Buffalo.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204156/http://www.buffalodiocese.org/bishopofbuffalo/NewsReleases2005/BishopHeadDies.aspx Bishop Head Dies]"
