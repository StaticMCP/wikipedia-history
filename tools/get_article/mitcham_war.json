Some accounts characterize the conflict as resulting from the 1892 elections that left rural whites disenfranchised and angry and resulting in racial violence.\nAround 1890, a group of young rural men formed a secret society called \"Hell-at-the-Breech\" that believed their local economy was being controlled by a small group.  On December 25, 1892, the gang entered Coffeeville and murdered a prominent businessman.\nSoon a vigilante mob of 500 formed to seek the Hell-at-the-Breech murderers, and eventually killed 5 men.\nDifferent sources have the violence continuing until fall of 1893 after the Hell-at-the-breech disbanded or when the mob of Clarke County men publicly shot a prominent member of the Hell-at-the-Breech gang.\nFurther reading\n*Brown, Jerry Elijah.
