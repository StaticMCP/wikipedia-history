In 1917 he became president of the newly created Moldovan school commission; on March 20 – the president of the National Moldavian Party, and on May 16 – the president of the Moldovan Cultural Society. During this period, he substituted the deputy commissioner of Bessarabia, C. A. Mimi. He was the first resident of Chișinău to hoist the flag of Romania to his residence. On June 7, 1919 he was elected honorary member of the Romanian Academy. He was the author of the works Plebiscite in Bessarabia (1919), Population of Bessarabia by nationalities according to Russian official sources (in collaboration with P.

Gheorghe Bezviconi testified that \"Pavel Gore was the first but also the last knight of Bessarabia. By studying the past he came to a medieval and uplifting conception of chivalry, of the nation and of the blazon. Thus, he became the only herald of Bessarabia, even of all Romania\".\n, which is also the coat of arms of the Republic]]\nUnder the conditions of the establishment of the National Moldovian  Party in Chișinău, on April 3, 1917, Paul Gore (as president) has edited a research that was done in Russian language entitled \"National colors of Romanians from Bessarabia\" (remaining in the manuscript). It aims to demonstrate that the Bessarabians should use the Romanian tricolor by default:\nTo this extent, the heraldist Silviu Andrieș-Tabac considers Gore the moral author of the coat of arms and flag of the Moldavian Democratic Republic, mainly due to the fact that \"Paul Gore had the real opportunity to influence the opinion of the revolutionary and public elite. [...] Only a professional heraldist of his waist could find a formula to expresses in heraldic language the liberation of the Moldovan province [...] under the domination of Romanov emperors and, at the same time, he knew (was familiar) how  the old  coat of arms of the Principality of Moldova was looked like.\nIn 1922, the Heraldic Advisory Commission was set up, under the chairmanship of Dimitrie Onciul. Paul Gore was among the first members. Being the member he proposed several designs of the coat of arms of Greater Romania. The weapons adopted were based on his idea. But also in 1922, Gore was named the director of the museum and chairman of the Chișinău State Archives Commission, and because of the tasks imposed he missed several meetings of the Heraldic Advisory Commission. After his death, in 1928, George D. Florescu has replaced him in the Commission.\nWorks\n* Note on those of good faith from Bessarabia  (1908);\n* The Boyars rights (1911);\n* Album of Moldovan carpet ornaments (1912);\n* Plebiscite in Bessarabia (1919);\n* Self-administration and Zemstvo (1920);\n* The chrysanthemum at the border, in the Interwar prose of Bessarabia, ingr. and pref.
