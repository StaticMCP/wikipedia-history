It is  outside Shrewsbury. In 1931 the parish had a population of 176. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Montford.\nEtymology\nIts name is locally pronounced Shray-den, and was often spelt \"Shraydon\" in old documents; it is otherwise pronounced Shray-war-dine. The placename originates from Old English worðign \"enclosed settlement\" combined with either scraef \"cave\"  or screawa \"shrew\", the latter used as a byname for an individual.\nLandmarks\nThe village's landmarks include Shrawardine Castle and St Mary's Church. The castle, known as Castell Isabella by the Anglo-Normans, was built in the reign of Henry I of England, and dismantled during the English Civil War in 1645. It had been held since 1644 by the Royalist commander Sir William Vaughan, whose aggressive tactics earned him the nickname \"the Devil of Shrawardine\".\nLittle Shrawardine\nThe River Severn passes to the west of the village. On the other side of the river is a hamlet called Little Shrawardine. It lies within the civil parish of Alberbury with Cardeston.\nNotable residents\n*Henry Bromley (died 1615), Elizabethan and Jacobean politician, owned Shrawardine Castle where he died.\n*Rev Dr Nevil Maskelyne FRS FRSE , the fifth Astronomer Royal, was Rector of the parish 1775 to 1782.\n*Jane Gray (stained glass artist), b.1931–d.2024, had a workshop in Shrawardine.\nTransport\nShrawardine once had a railway station with a single platform, which finally closed in 1933.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Montford, Shropshire\nReferences\nExternal links"
