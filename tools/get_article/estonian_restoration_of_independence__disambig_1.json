On that day at 23:02 local time, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia, in agreement with the Estonian Committee (the executive organ of the Congress of Estonia), declared the illegal Soviet occupation and annexation of the country terminated, and proclaimed the full restoration of the independence of Estonia.\n1990\nOn 30 March 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR adopted a resolution on the state status of Estonia. The resolution declared that the Soviet occupation of 17 June 1940 did not de jure interrupt the existence of the Republic of Estonia, the Supreme Soviet declared the state power of the Estonian SSR illegal from the moment of its establishment and proclaimed the start of a transitional period to full de facto independence pending the restoration of the constitutional bodies of state power of the Republic of Estonia. On 8 May the same year, the Supreme Soviet of the ESSR adopted a law invalidating the name \"Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic\". Also, according to this law, the use of the coat of arms, flag, and anthem of the Estonian SSR as state symbols was terminated and the 1938 Constitution of the independent Republic of Estonia was restored. The name of the Supreme Soviet is thereafter translated as the \"Supreme Council\". A week later the law on the principles of the interim order of administration of Estonia was adopted, according to which the subordination of public authorities, public administration, court bodies was terminated and the prosecutor's office of the republic to the relevant authorities of the USSR, and they separated from the corresponding system of the USSR. It was announced that relations between the republic and the USSR are now based on the Tartu Peace Treaty, concluded between the Republic of Estonia and the RSFSR on 2 February 1920.\nIndependence referendum of 3 March 1991\nOn 3 March, a referendum was held on the independence of the Republic of Estonia, which was attended by those who lived in Estonia before the Soviet annexation and their descendants, as well as persons who have received the so-called \"green cards\" of the Congress of Estonia. 77.8% of those who voted supported the idea of restoring independence.\nDenmark recognized Estonia's independence on 11 March.\nThe 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt\nThe August Coup or August Putsch took place on 19–22 August 1991 and was an attempt by members of the Soviet Union's government to take control of the country from the Soviet President and General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.\n19 August 1991\nAs the coup attempt was taking place in Moscow and with that the military and political attention of the Soviet Union otherwise occupied, various republics of the Soviet Union took the opportunity to declare their independence. On the evening of 19 August, delegates from the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia and the Estonian Committee started negotiations to confirm the independence of the Republic of Estonia. The main debate was a crucial one: should Estonia declare independence as a new Republic or continue with the juridical continuation of the Republic of Estonia established in 1918 and occupied in 1940.\n20 August 1991\nAt 23:02 on the evening of 20 August 1991, during a live broadcast carried out by Estonian Television, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia voted on the confirm of its Restoration of Independence.\nOut of the 105 delegates of the Supreme Council 70 were present, 69 voted in favour of the restoration.
