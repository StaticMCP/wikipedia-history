A cryptosystem is plaintext-aware if it is difficult for any efficient algorithm to come up with a valid ciphertext without being aware of the corresponding plaintext.\nFrom a lay point of view, this is a strange property.  Normally, a ciphertext is computed by encrypting a plaintext.  If a ciphertext is created this way, its creator would be aware, in some sense, of the plaintext.  However, many cryptosystems are not plaintext-aware.  As an example, consider the RSA cryptosystem without padding.  In the RSA cryptosystem, plaintexts and ciphertexts are both values modulo N (the modulus).  Therefore, RSA is not plaintext aware: one way of generating a ciphertext without knowing the plaintext is to simply choose a random number modulo N.\nIn fact, plaintext-awareness is a very strong property.  Any cryptosystem that is semantically secure and is plaintext-aware is actually secure against a chosen-ciphertext attack, since any adversary that chooses ciphertexts would already know the plaintexts associated with them.\nHistory\nThe concept of plaintext-aware encryption was developed by Mihir Bellare and Phillip Rogaway in their paper on optimal asymmetric encryption, as a method to prove that a cryptosystem is chosen-ciphertext secure.\nFurther research\nLimited research on plaintext-aware encryption has been done since Bellare and Rogaway's paper.  Although several papers have applied the plaintext-aware technique in proving encryption schemes are chosen-ciphertext secure, only three papers revisit the concept of plaintext-aware encryption itself, both focussed on the definition given by Bellare and Rogaway that inherently require random oracles.  Plaintext-aware encryption is known to exist when a public-key infrastructure is assumed.\nAlso, it has been shown that weaker forms of plaintext-awareness exist under the knowledge of exponent assumption, a non-standard assumption about Diffie-Hellman triples.\nFinally a variant of the Cramer Shoup encryption scheme was shown to be fully plaintext aware in the standard model under the knowledge of exponent assumption.\nSee also\n* Topics in cryptography\nReferences"
