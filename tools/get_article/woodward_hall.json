It was built in 1931–1932, and is a two-story, rectangular building, five bays wide and two bays deep, with Tudor Revival and Colonial Revival style design elements in a somewhat eclectic design.  It has fieldstone walls and a cross-gable slate roof and sits on a poured concrete foundation.  It has a small, two-bay garage attached to the main block.  It was built for Earl Woodward (1891-1956), who reinvented Adirondack tourism in the Lake George region through the introduction of dude ranch style resorts during the 1920s.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.\nReferences"
