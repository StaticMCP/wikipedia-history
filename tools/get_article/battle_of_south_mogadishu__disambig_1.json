This was the first battle in that city after Somalia had made the effort to elect a new president in January 2009, and this embryonic return to democracy means that this is considered a starting point of the Somali Civil War (2009–present) within the longer civil war.\nThe battle, fought mainly in the south of the city, left at least 87 people dead and 90 more injured.  Rebels fired volleys of mortar bombs at the presidential palace, located on a hilltop in the Wardhigley district. A base for African Union and government troops in the Hodan district was also fired upon as was the nearby Howlwadag district. The recently elected President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was said to be within his palace at the time of the incident.\nAt least 11 civilians were amongst the dead, with workers at the main Madena Hospital indicating that at one stage approximately 45 wounded had been admitted. 15 Al-Shabab and Hizbul Islam fighters and 6 Transitional Federal Government Policemen were killed in the fighting.\nSheikh Omar Iman, the chairman of Hizbul Islam condemned the attacks on AMISOM, but admitted that 'some members' of the group had been involved.\nSee also\n*Somali Civil War\n*War in Somalia (2006–2009)\n*Battle of Mogadishu (1993)\n*Battle of Mogadishu (2006)\n*Fall of Mogadishu (2006)\n*Battle of Mogadishu (March–April 2007)\n*Battle of Mogadishu (November 2007)\n*Battle of Mogadishu (2008)\n*Battle of Mogadishu (2009)\n*Battle of Mogadishu (2010–11)\nReferences"
