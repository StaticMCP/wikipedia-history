Johnson and the election of 1968, leading up to the election of Richard Nixon, delivered in the style of Biblical verse.\nProduction\nThe album's script was written by Myron Roberts, Lincoln Haynes and Sasha Gilien, and was simultaneously published by Ballantine Books. The album was produced by Mediarts Records, a small record label co-founded by former Capitol Records executive Alan W. Livingston, and was Mediarts' second release, after Dory Previn's On My Way to Where.\nOrson Welles was selected as the deadpan narrator due to his already being an established narrator, including on Biblical epics such as King of Kings (1961). Luchi de Jesus provided the album's incidental music.\nTrack listing\nSide 1\n# L. B.

It has been suggested by several Welles biographers that the tax audit was prompted by the Nixon administration in retaliation for The Begatting of the President. This claim is difficult to verify, though – on the one hand, the Nixon administration did indeed keep an \"enemies list\", of left-wingers in the media and politics. On the other hand, Welles did not appear on any known version of the list, he had long maintained a highly unorthodox series of tax arrangements, and a 1973 report by the Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation concluded that people on the \"Enemies\" list had not been subjected to an unusual number of tax audits.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://archive.org/details/begattingofpresi00robe The Begatting of the President], Internet Archive\n* [https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16675252 The Begatting of the President], WorldCat\n* [http://bsnpubs.com/la/mediarts/mediarts.html Mediarts album discography and history]"
