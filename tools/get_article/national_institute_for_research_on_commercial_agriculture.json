Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) took over the control of functioning the institute in 1965. It is situated at Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh, India.\nHistory\nIn 1945, Government of India constituted Indian Central Tobacco Committee (ICTC) to improve the research activities and production of tobacco in India. To improve research activities, quality control and production of Tobacco, the institute is established in 1947 which was later undertaken by ICAR.\nDivisions\n* The institute has six regional research stations at Guntur, Kandukuru, and Jeelugumilli in Andhra Pradesh, and at Hunsur, Karnataka, Vedasandur, Tamil Nadu and Dinhata, West Bengal.\n* Burley Tobacco Research Centre (BTRC) at Kalavacharla, East Godavari, Andhra Pradesh.\nPublications\n* Arvind Kumar Srivastava, Achila Singh, D.
