In summer 2009 Doncaster Rovers Belles beat competition from other Premier League clubs to secure Ward's signature, but she experienced a \"change of heart\" and returned to Lincoln after a few weeks. When Lincoln were accepted into the new FA WSL, Ward moved to Sheffield FC, initially on loan.\nIn November 2017, club captain Ward left Sheffield FC after more than 200 appearances and over 100 goals.\nManagerial career\nSheffield United\nIn November 2017, Ward joined Sheffield United in the FA Women's Premier League Midlands Division One as player-assistant manager.

Ward was named to WSL Manager of the Year shortlist at the end of the season, steering the team away from relegation as Birmingham finishing 11th of 12 teams.
