The track was co-written by band members, Luke Steele and Nick Littlemore with Jonathan \"Donnie\" Sloan. The full Sam La More remix was made available as a free download on the band's official website.\nOn the Australian ARIA Charts, it reached number&nbsp;ten, and was certified double platinum to indicate shipment of over 140,000 units. It was listed at number&nbsp;four in the 2008 Triple J Hottest 100 popularity poll. \"Walking on a Dream\" won the category for Single of the Year at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, and, in the following year, it won Dance Work of the Year at the APRA Awards. Although the single was originally due for release in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2009, the date was postponed until 6 July. In Europe, it reached number&nbsp;eight in both Belgium and Ireland; and peaked in the top&nbsp;100 on the  UK Singles Chart. The song was made the Single of the Week on the iTunes Store for the week of 21 April 2009. The song was featured in the 2011 movie Hall Pass. The song was also featured in the 2012 racing video game Forza Horizon and later in the 2016 Honda Civic \"The Dreamer\" commercial, which helped revive the song in the charts, with the song debuting on the US Billboard Hot 100 after more than seven years of release, peaking at number 65. In 2025, the song placed 24 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of Australian Songs. The song was sampled a year after its release on The Thrill by Wiz Khalifa.\nBackground\nLuke Steele (of The Sleepy Jackson) and Nick Littlemore (of Pnau) formed Empire of the Sun as an electronic duo in 2007. Their debut release, \"Walking on a Dream\", appeared as a single on 30 August 2008 ahead of the album of the same name on 3 October. Steele had assisted on tracks, \"With You Forever\" and \"Freedom\", for Pnau's self-titled album, which was issued in December 2007. As Empire of the Sun, the duo recorded material for Walking on a Dream, including the title track, at Soundworks Music Studio and Linear Recording in Sydney during various sessions throughout the latter part of that year. The track was co-written by Littlemore and Steele with Jonathan Sloan. Sloan also co-produced the album with the duo and Littlemore's bandmate, Peter Mayes of Pnau.\nSam Littlemore (Nick's older brother) aka Sam La More remixed the track, which was made available as a free download on the album's official website until December 2008.\nComposition\nThe song is composed in the key of F minor, with a tempo of 127 bpm.\nMusic video\nraises a sphere to create a blue beam in the video for \"Walking on a Dream\".]]\nThe music video for the song was shot by Josh Logue on location along the Bund in Shanghai, China, in July–August 2008, just prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. It features Steele and Littlemore wearing Eastern costumes and makeup, inspired by Peking Opera.\nChart performance\ncommercial]]\nThe song was in a Honda Civic commercial in the U.S. in 2016, more than seven years after its original release.
