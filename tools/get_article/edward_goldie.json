He was the son of George Goldie.\nLife\nHe was born in Sheffield in 1856. His father was the ecclesiastical architect George Goldie. Edward was the great-grandson of architect Joseph Bonomi, through his paternal grandmother, Mary Anne Bonomi Goldie.\nHe went to school at Ushaw College in County Durham, as his father had previously done. In 1875, he was articled to Goldie & Child. It was an architectural firm which his father ran with Charles Edwin Child.

In 1913, he was joined by his son, Joseph Goldie, and the firm became Edward Goldie & Son until 1953.\n, Haywards Heath]]\nEdward is perhaps best known for designing St James's, Spanish Place, whose original chapel had been designed by his great-grandfather, Joseph Bonomi.
