The society's original stated aim was \"the promotion of the study and knowledge of the antiquities and objects of interest in the county and surrounding districts.\"\nIt was founded in 1891 in a meeting at Palmerstown House, Straffan, which was at that time the home of the Earl of Mayo; it claims to be the oldest society in Ireland to have continued under the same name.\nSee also\n* List of historical societies in Ireland\nReferences"
