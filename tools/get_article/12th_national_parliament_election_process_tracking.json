Presented at a press conference on 17 January, 2024, the report highlighted the election's one-sided nature and lack of competitiveness, neither free nor inclusive, posing a threat to the country's democracy. The Bangladesh Election Commission played a catalytic role in advancing the one-sided 'agenda,' with other state institutions, including law enforcement agencies and the administration, supporting the same 'agenda.' While independent candidates from the government party were assigned roles to foster competitiveness, most constituencies lacked true competition, with 241 out of 300 having no contests. A total of 41.8 percent polling, including 15.43 percent polling in the last hour of the election, sparked controversy. Despite technical success, the report suggests enduring questions about political integrity, democratic values, and ethical standards. The election failed to meet the prerequisites for fairness, participation, impartiality, and equal competition. The results indicate consolidated institutional dominance and a continued path of unchecked power and responsibility-free implementation in the political and governance system.\nReception\nKazi Habibul Awal, the Chief Election Commissioner of Bangladesh, acknowledges the lack of inclusivity in the election but distances himself from advancing the government's agenda. He emphasizes the erosion of public faith in the electoral process due to political leadership. The Awami League rejects the report as one-sided, anti-government, absurd, and full of nonsense, while the BNP welcomes it, considering it a reflection of public opinion. Awami League leaders such as Obaidul Quader, Hasan Mahmud, and Mohammad A. Arafat share this sentiment, asserting that TIB aligns with BNP's perspective. The report, endorsed by the BNP, is embraced by leaders like Nazrul Islam Khan, Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku, Abdul Moyeen Khan, and Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, who assert that it has revealed the truth.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20240121042340/https://ti-bangladesh.org/articles/video/6896 Video of 12th National Parliament Election Process Tracking]"
