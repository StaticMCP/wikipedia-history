The DuterTen ticket endorsed by Vice President Sara Duterte and former President Rodrigo Duterte outperformed pre-election surveys and gained seats in the upper chamber. Meanwhile, the KiBam tandem, having run as an independent opposition aligned with former Vice President Leni Robredo, were both elected, each ranking high in the final tally in upset victories.\nCandidates\nExpressed interest\nThe following individuals have expressed interest in holding the role.\n* Francis Escudero (NPC), elected in 2022, incumbent Senate president\n** On May 16, 2025, Escudero conceded his retention in the Senate presidency to his colleagues in the 20th Congress. While he will not campaign for the position, he would accept the role if elected.\n* Tito Sotto (NPC), elected in 2025\n** Following the midterm election, Sotto, who served as Senate president from 2018 to 2022, told media outlets that he was open to returning to his former role if he had sufficient support to elect him back to the position. He had previously been approached by four other Senators urging him to run for the position.\nEvents leading up to the election\nOn July 1, Joel Villanueva told reporters that Escudero would likely remain Senate president on the convening of Congress.\nElection of the Senate president\nMedia outlets, including Rappler, have regarded the election for the Senate presidency as being closely tied to the impeachment of Sara Duterte. Leading up to the opening of Congress, senators and media outlets identified several groups forming around the leading contenders for the chamber's leadership.\nIn a press briefing on July 9, Ronald dela Rosa named seven Senators, including himself, as part of the \"Duter7\" bloc, a grouping aligned with former President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Sara Duterte. Dela Rosa affirmed the bloc's support for Escudero's retention as Senate president and has signed a resolution for his reelection.\nFormer Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri has identified a \"veteran bloc\", composed of himself, Loren Legarda, and Panfilo Lacson, who were dissatisfied with Escudero's leadership and would back Sotto for Senate president.\nIn a radio interview, Senate President pro tempore Jinggoy Estrada said that Bam Aquino and Kiko Pangilinan would likely support Escudero's retention to secure committee leadership positions.\nReferences"
