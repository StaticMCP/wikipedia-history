The Progressive and Popular Revolution is named after the Democratic and Popular revolution, a name given to the Revolution and social upheaval of the Sankarist era by Thomas Sankara. According to Traoré and supporters, the Progressive and Popular Revolution seeks to build a Pan-African coalition to combat what its supporters call French Neo-Colonialism and Imperialism. It places emphasis on connecting with the Sankara era of Burkina Faso. Its main ideological futures are nationalism and a state-led economy.\nPolicies\nDomestic\nTraoré's policies include nationalization, social welfare programs and opposition to liberalization reforms, particularly the policies of the IMF and the World Bank, which Traoré calls Imperialist.\nTraoré also announced that the perpetrators of the killing of Thomas Sankara would be put on trial. The former dictator of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore and 13 other members of the 1987 Coup were sentenced to life in prison in absentia by a military tribunal.\nThe Ministers of the government lowered their salaries by large amounts, up to 50%. The government also launched large public works programs, leading to constructions of roads, nearly doubling the total amount of roads in Burkina Faso.\nBurkina Faso also became the first former French Colony to produce Tomato Concentrate. Additionally, Burkina Faso nationalized large swaths of agricultural land, with the eventual goal of total state takeover.\nThe Burkinabe Government further stated a goal of Food self-sufficiency, and started agricultural programs and subsidies to work towards food sovereignty by the end of 2025\nThomas Sankara's body was re-interned in a newly constructed mausoleum in a ceremony overseen by Traoré\nIn May 2025, the leaders of Burkinabe ministry of sports and his counterparts from Mali and Niger announced the formation of three youth groups, the Federation of Students of the AES, the Coordination of Student Communicators of the AES and the National Coordination of Student and School Monitoring. The goal they stated was to \"be direct channels for youth engagement and revolutionary thinking.\"\nIn June 2025, the Burkinabe government launched an anti desertification program to encourage tree-planting campaigns.\nThe Burkinabe Government also launched an anti Malaria Campaign by distributing mosquito nets.\nInternational reactions\nThe declaration of the Progressive and Popular Revolution was met with vastly differing reactions. In the west, France and the United States expressed condemnation and concern.\nThe Burkinabe diaspora was mixed in its response.\nReferences"
