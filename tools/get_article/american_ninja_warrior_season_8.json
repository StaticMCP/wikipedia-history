its own finals course instead of sending competitors to Japan.\nStage 1\nDuring the first episode of Stage 1, Jessie Graff became the first woman ever to successfully complete Stage 1 and advance to Stage 2. She placed 5th overall with a time of 2:07.61. She is the first woman in ANW history to make it to Stage 2. During the second episode of Stage 1, Jake Murray placed 1st overall with the fastest time of 1:45.25. Dan Polizzi, Nick Hanson, and Nick Kostreski cleared all the obstacles, but ran out of time before they could hit the buzzer at the end of Stage 1. Brent Steffensen, Travis Rosen, Ryan Stratis, James McGrath, Jamie Rahn, Mike Bernardo, Kevin Bull, Ian Dory, Jo Jo Bynum, and Geoff Britten surprisingly went out early on Stage 1 this season. Only a record-low 17 finishers have successfully completed the course.\nStage 1 featured four new obstacles, Snake Run, the Giant Log Grip, the Broken Bridge and the Flying Squirrel.\nCompetitors who completed Stage 1 are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
