He won a record 40 races at the old Harold Park Paceway prior to its closure. Koala King won a total of seventy eight races.\nHe was a bay colt foaled in 1972 that was sired by Koala Frost from  by U Scott (USA) from Jacinta by Protector from Cavatina by Arion Axworthy (USA) from Dilworth by Travis Axworthy (USA) from Muriel Dillon by Harold Dillon (USA) from Muriel Madison (USA) by James Madison from Dolly by Memo from Marguerite by Speculation. The future champion was purchased from the sales in the early 1970s for the modest sum of $1,300.\nRacing record\nKoala King was owned and trained by a South Coast trainer Ray Wisbey and his wife. Koala King was driven in the early part of his career by Kevin Robinson before Brian Hancock took the reins for many of his feature race wins.\nOn 28 July 1978 at Harold Park Koala King, the race favourite, was in the centre of major error when his driver Kevin Robinson mistook the laps in the main event. Robinson thought there was another lap to the finish when the field was in fact already at the finish. The crowd jeered the driver, but the stewards said it was an honest mistake but they suspended Robinson for six months.\nKoala King contested the national hero and sentimental favourite Paleface Adios in the 39th Inter Dominion held in 1980 at Sydney. Paleface Adios was already a winner of over 100 races and eight Inter Dominion heats, but was denied victory in the championship final by a brilliant Koala King.\nDuring his racing career Koala King competed and defeated some of the best pacers ever in Gammalite, Pure Steel and Michael Frost (also a son of Koala Frost)\nKoala King's total race earnings were $680,110.\nStud record\nThe most notable of Koala King's progeny were:\n*Brunei Achilles, won $23,450\n*Copper Regent 1:58.8 $88,749\n*Jilliby Diamond 1987 F 2:07.7 $5,852; dam of Jilliby Spirit (won $415,382)\n*Koala Sunrise (US)$308,396\n*Palais Queen $6,328\nSee also\n* Harness racing in Australia\nReferences"
