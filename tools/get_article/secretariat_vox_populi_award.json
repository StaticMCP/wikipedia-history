After Chenery's death in 2017, the voting procedure changed; , six nominees are chosen by a committee of \"several distinguished personalities from within and outside the racing industry who all share a keen interest and affection for the sport\". Online voting is then turned over to the general public, who can write in their own choices. Voting closes on November 30, with the winner announced in December.\nTwo horses, California Chrome and Cody's Wish, are the only ones to date that have received the Secretariat Vox Populi Award twice. In 2023 Cody's Wish became the first winner of the award in consecutive years.\nReferences"
