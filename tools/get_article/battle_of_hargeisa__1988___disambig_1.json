Hargeisa, being a strategic and symbolic city, became a focal point for SNM operations.\nThe Battle\nOn 31 May 1988, SNM forces, led by Col. Ahmed Mire Mohamed, initiated a coordinated assault on Hargeisa. The operation was meticulously planned, with prior reconnaissance missions conducted to assess government defenses. SNM fighters infiltrated the city from multiple directions, targeting key military installations and government facilities. The surprise attack led to the swift capture of significant portions of the city, although some areas, including the airport, remained under government control.\nAftermath\nThe SNM's incursion into Hargeisa prompted a fierce response from government forces, led by Gen. Mohamed Said Hersi Morgan. The Somali National Army (SNA) launched counter-offensives involving heavy artillery and aerial bombardments, resulting in widespread destruction and significant civilian casualties. The battle caused a mass exodus of residents, with many seeking refuge in neighboring regions and countries. Despite initial successes, SNM forces eventually withdrew from Hargeisa due to the overwhelming firepower of government troops.\nSignificance\nThe Battle of Hargeisa was a turning point in the Somaliland War of Independence. It demonstrated the SNM's capability to challenge the Somali government's control over major urban centers. The extensive destruction and humanitarian crisis resulting from the battle drew international attention to the conflict. The events of 31 May 1988 are commemorated in Somaliland as a symbol of resistance and the struggle for self-determination.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [Gudo-galkii SNM ee Hargeysa 31 May 1988](https://hargeisapress.com/gudo-galkii-snm-ee-hargeysa-31-may-1988/)\n* [Gudogalkii Xoogagii SNM ee Hargaysa 31-5-1988](https://bandhige.com/maqaallo/gudogalkii-xoogagii-snm-ee-hargaysa-31-5-1988-wq-cali-cabdi-coomay)\n* [Daawo: Barnaamij Taariikheed Dagaalkii Qadhaadhaa ee ka Qarxey Hargeysa 1988 iyo Dhibkuu ka Tagey](https://gabiley.net/2017/07/daawo-barnaamij-taariikheed-dagaalkii-qadhaadhaa-ee-ka-qarxey-hargeysa-1988-iyo-dhibkuu-ka-tagey-3/?amp=1)"
