World War II, the deadliest war in history, started in 1939 and ended in 1945. In accordance with the Nazi–Soviet Pact, Nazi Germany and the USSR jointly attacked Poland in September 1939, marking the start of the war, but Germany later broke the pact and attacked the USSR in June 1941. The USSR lost 26.6 million people during the war. The war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945 with the capitulation of Germany to the allied (including Soviet) forces. About 80-90% of losses during the entire war the German armed forces suffered on the Soviet (Eastern) front, whose contribution to the victory was decisive. From 1941 to April 1945, the Soviet Union had produced 19.83 million rifles; 98.3 thousand tanks and self-propelled guns; 525.5 thousand guns and mortars; 122.1 thousand combat aircraft; 70 combat ships.\nHelmets\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Type\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Origin\n!
