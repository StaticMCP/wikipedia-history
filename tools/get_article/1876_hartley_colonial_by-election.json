Coal was mined at the property and William Pitt was the colliery manager. In October 1875 Thomas Brown responded to a tender for the supply of coal to the railway, however no contract was awarded. In December 1875 a fresh tender was called and William Pitt personally submitted a tender which was accepted. Samuel Gray said in the Legislative Assembly that Thomas Brown leased the colliery to William Pitt and that the only connection between them was one of landlord and tenant.\nThe Committee found that Thomas Brown was the owner of the Eskbank Colliery, the coal supplied by William Pitt was taken from the Eskbank Colliery and that Thomas Brown had a \"direct interest in a contract entered into with the Government by the said William Pitt for the supply of engine coal for the Great Southern and Western Railways\" and was therefore disqualified from being a member of the Legislative Assembly.\nAfter the Committee report was tabled Thomas Brown attempted to resign, however the Legislative Assembly adopted the report of the Committee and declared the seat was vacant.\nThe question of whether Hugh Taylor had an interest in a contract for the supply of meat to the government asylum at Parramatta was referred to the Committee on the same day as Thomas Brown. Taylor resigned after the report on Thomas Brown had been tabled, but before the Committee had reported on whether he too was disqualified, and the resulting by-election was held on Thursday 20 April.\nResult\n}}\nThe Committee of Elections and Qualifications found that Thomas Brown had an office of profit under the crown and declared that his seat was vacant.\nSee also\n*Electoral results for the district of Hartley\n*List of New South Wales state by-elections\nReferences"
