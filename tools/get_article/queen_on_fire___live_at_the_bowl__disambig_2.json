It was recorded live at the Milton Keynes Bowl, Buckinghamshire, England, on 5 June 1982 during the Hot Space Tour. A DVD was also released with the complete concert and bonus material, such as band interviews and tour highlights.\nIn 2005, the album was also released as an LP. In the UK, the DVD made No. 1 and CD, No. 20 in the DVD and CD chart respectively. In the US, neither the DVD nor album charted.\nNotes\nDuring the concert, lead guitarist Brian May had a few minor problems with his homemade Red Special guitar. During both the fast version of \"We Will Rock You\" and \"Dragon Attack\", two of the strings broke and he had to change to his Birch Red Special backup for most of \"Action This Day\" and for the entire second half of \"Dragon Attack\" and the entire duration of \"Now I'm Here (Reprise)\".\nBefore playing \"Love of My Life\", May played a snippet of the intro to \"Las Palabras de Amor\" calling it \"a little fiddle around\".\nDuring May's guitar solo, the pickup switches of his guitar were switched off and May's guitar solo stopped for 20 seconds (the full 20 seconds is on the DVD, but the album version of the performance contains only 3 seconds). His guitar tech, Brian Zellis, helped May to get his guitar going again by simply turning back on the switches.\nDrummer Roger Taylor and bass guitarist John Deacon performed impromptu solos during \"Dragon Attack\" and before \"Under Pressure\", respectively when May switched guitars during \"Dragon Attack\" and was getting his guitar fixed following his solo.\nDuring \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", Freddie Mercury's voice very briefly slipped into an off-key falsetto during the lyric \"in this locality\" (the original error could be heard on the original BBC TV, Channel 4, MTV, an audience recording, and radio broadcasts of the concert) but the error was fixed for the release of the DVD and CD.\nDuring the first verse of \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", instead of singing the original line \"you made a bad boy out of me\", Mercury sang \"you made an asshole out of me\".\nMercury performed without his trademark bottomless microphone stand for \"We Will Rock You (Fast)\", \"Now I'm Here\" and \"The Hero\" (shown on the Live in Japan bonus footage on DVD). This allowed Mercury to more freely scale and walk along the raised wings on either side of the stage.\nThroughout the concert a member of the crowd can be heard using an air horn. The \"air horn man\" is thanked in the album's liner notes.\nDue to censorship laws the Hong Kong and China release of the CD removed \"Get Down, Make Love\" and \"Fat Bottomed Girls\".\nTrack listing\nDisc 1\nDisc 2\n| title11 = We Are the Champions\n| title12 = God Save the Queen\n| length11 = 3:28\n| length12 = 1:24\n| writer1 = Mercury\n| writer2 = May\n| writer4 = May\n| note4 = not included on the China or Hong Kong release\n| length10 = 2:08\n| writer5 = Mercury\n| writer6 = Mercury\n| writer7 = May\n| writer8 = Deacon\n| writer9 = Taylor\n| writer10 = May\n| writer11 = Mercury\n| total_length = 47:29\n| title10 = We Will Rock You\n| title1 = Get Down, Make Love\n| note1 = not included on the China or Hong Kong release\n| title5 = Crazy Little Thing Called Love\n| length1 = 3:39\n| title2 = Guitar Solo\n| length2 = 6:22\n| title3 = Under Pressure\n| length3 = 3:47\n| title4 = Fat Bottomed Girls\n| length4 = 5:25\n| length5 = 4:15\n| length9 = 3:25\n| title6 = Bohemian Rhapsody\n| length6 = 5:38\n| title7 = Tie Your Mother Down\n| length7 = 4:09\n| title8 = Another One Bites the Dust\n| length8 = 3:49\n| title9 = Sheer Heart Attack\n| writer12 = Traditional; arranged by May\n}}\nDVD bonus material\n* MK Bowl backstage interview\n* Freddie Mercury interview\n* Brian May and Roger Taylor interviews\n* Songs from concert at Stadthalle, Vienna, Austria on 12 May 1982\n*# \"Another One Bites the Dust\"\n*# \"We Will Rock You\"\n*# \"We Are the Champions\"\n*# \"God Save the Queen\"\n* Songs from concert at Seibu Lions Stadium, Tokorozawa, Japan on 3 November 1982\n*# \"Flash / The Hero\"\n*# \"Now I'm Here\"\n*# \"Impromptu\"\n*# \"Put Out the Fire\"\n*# \"Dragon Attack\"\n*# \"Now I'm Here (Reprise)\"\n*# \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\"\n*# \"Teo Torriatte (Let Us Cling Together)\"\n* Photo gallery (Calling All Girls)\nPersonnel\n;Queen\n*Freddie Mercury – lead vocals, piano, acoustic rhythm guitar on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\"\n*Brian May – harmony and backing vocals, guitars, piano on \"Save Me\"\n*Roger Taylor – harmony and backing vocals, drums, percussion, co-lead vocals on \"Action This Day\" (verses) and \"Sheer Heart Attack\"\n*John Deacon – bass guitar, rhythm guitar on \"Staying Power\", additional backing vocals on \"Somebody to Love\" and \"Back Chat\"\nwith:\n*Morgan Fisher – keyboards, piano\n;Technical\n*Justin Shirley-Smith – mix producer\n*Kris Fredriksson – Pro Tools HD\n*Reinhold Mack – recording engineer\n*Mick McKenna – second recording engineer\n*Tim Young – mastering\n*Richard Gray – artwork\n*Denis O'Regan – photography\nCharts and certifications\nCharts\nAlbum\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2004)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Austrian Top 75 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|23\n|-\n|Belgium (Flanders) 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|60\n|-\n|Belgium (Wallonia) 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|80\n|-\n|French Top 200 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|75\n|-\n|German Albums Chart\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|-\n|Italian Top 20 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n|-\n|Netherlands Top 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|74\n|-\n|Portuguese Top 30 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n|Scottish Albums\n|align=\"center\"|22\n|-\n|Swiss Top 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|52\n|-\n|UK Albums Chart\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2005)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Spanish Top 100 Albums\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|73\n|}\nDVD\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2004)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Australian Top 40 DVDs\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|Austrian Top 10 Music DVDs\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Norwegian Top 10 DVDs\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n|Swedish Top 20 DVDs\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2005)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Belgium (Wallonia) Top 10 Music DVDs\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n|Hungarian Top 20 DVDs\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n|}\nCertifications\nAlbum\nDVD\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Official YouTube videos: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o9teXFYt7k \"Guitar Solo\" (Live at the Bowl)], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPt3cwyFz-E Queen + Paul Rodgers – \"Guitar Solo\"]\n* [http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/fire-live-bowl/ Queen official website: Discography: On Fire Live At The Bowl] (includes no lyrics)\n*"
