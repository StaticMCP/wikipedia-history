It debuted at No.&nbsp;6 on the ARIA album chart on 9 July 2007, while the DVD debuted at No.&nbsp;2 on the DVD chart. On the US Billboard Top Christian Albums Chart, it debuted at No.&nbsp;5.\nMaking of the album\nSaviour King was recorded live at the Acer Arena on 18 March 2007 by Darlene Zschech and the Hillsong team after the annual Hillsong Colour Conference. After many years at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, Hillsong Church moved the annual live album recording to the Acer Arena. This was also the last official album to feature Steve McPherson as a vocalist. McPherson is still a part of Hillsong Church as a publisher. Also, this was the last album in which Zschech appeared as a worship pastor.\nThe front cover depicts Hillsong Church congregation and the Hillsong Live logo, while the inverse side depicts Darlene Zschech, Reuben Morgan, Joel Houston and Marty Sampson.\nWriting and composition\nThe album contains songs written and used in Hillsong Church from early 2006 to March 2007. Songs such as \"I'm Not Ashamed\" and \"Here in My Life\" were written earlier in 2006, while songs like \"Lord of Lords\", \"In the Mystery\" and \"One Thing\" were written around the time of the album recording. \"Break Free\", \"Hosanna\" and \"Saviour King\" were released on the Hillsong United album All of the Above.\nThe majority of songs were written by Marty Sampson, Reuben Morgan, Joel Houston, Brooke Fraser, Mia Fieldes and Ben Fielding. Matt Crocker from Hillsong United youth, who wrote songs on the Hillsong United EP In a Valley by the Sea, contributed to two songs.\nTrack listing (CD)\nTrack listing (DVD)\n# \"Saviour King\" [introduction] (Marty Sampson)\n# \"I'm Not Ashamed\" (Marty Sampson)\n# \"Break Free\" (Joel Houston)\n# \"Hosanna\" (Brooke Fraser and Darlene Zschech)\n# \"Here in My Life\" (Darlene Zschech)\n# \"You Are Faithful\" (Darlene Zschech)\n# \"In Your Freedom\" (Marty Sampson)\n# \"To Know Your Name\" (Jad Gillies)\n# \"In the Mystery\" (Joel Houston)\n# \"God of Ages\" (Darlene Zschech and Reuben Morgan)\n# \"You Are My Strength\" (Reuben Morgan)\n# \"One Thing\" (Darlene Zschech)\n# \"Lord of Lords\" (Brooke Fraser)\n# \"You Saw Me\" (Reuben Morgan)\n# \"Saviour King\" (Marty Sampson)\nPersonnel\n* Darlene Zschech – worship pastor, executive producer, producer, senior worship leader, senior lead vocal\n* Phil Dooley – creative director, executive producer\n* Andrew Crawford – producer\n* Joel Houston – producer, United worship leader, acoustic guitar\n* Reuben Morgan – producer, worship leader, acoustic guitar, music director & arranger\n* Marty Sampson – worship leader, acoustic guitar\n* Jad Gillies – worship leader, acoustic guitar\n* Brooke Fraser – worship leader, acoustic guitar\n* Nigel Hendroff – electric guitar\n* Ben Fielding – electric guitar\n* Steve McPherson – other vocals\n* Paul Andrew – other vocals\n* Scott Bakken – other vocals\n* Julie Bassett – other vocals\n* Damian Bassett – other vocals\n* Debbie-Ann Bax – other vocals\n* Julie Cowdroy – other vocals\n* Kathryn De Araujo – other vocals\n* Jonathan Douglass (J.D) – other vocals\n* Katie Elmore – other vocals\n* Deborah Ezzy – other vocals\n* Mia Fields – other vocals\n* Karen Horn – other vocals\n* Sam Knock – other vocals\n* Kelista Puddle – other vocals\n* Katie Restivo – other vocals\n* Barry Southgate – other vocals\n* Katrina Tadman – other vocals\n* Marcus Temu – other vocals\n* Aaron Watson – other vocals\n* Holly Watson – other vocals\n* Ryan Watts Thomas – other vocals\n* Peter Kelly – percussion\n* Jason Blackbourn – percussion\n* Timon Klein – electric guitar\n* Nigel Hendroff – electric guitar\n* Raymond Badham – electric guitar\n* Dylan Thomas – electric guitar\n* Matthew Tennikoff – bass guitar\n* Gian Peipman – bass guitar\n* Ntando Mpofu – bass guitar\n* Ben Whincop – bass guitar\n* Dane Charles – drums\n* Rolf Wam Fjell – drums\n* Simon Kobler – drums\n* Paul Mabury – drums\n* Peter James – keyboards\n* Kevin Lee – keyboards\n* Peter King – keyboards\n* Autumn Hardman – keyboards\n* Hillsong Church Choir – choir\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QuP6o6Dwfw Video Preview]\npt:Saviour King"
