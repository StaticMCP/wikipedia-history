The southern half is bisected by the Cleveland railway line with the locality served by Ormiston railway station ().\nEmpire Point lies on the coast () adjacent to Tolston Terrace.\nThe border in the west roughly aligns with Hillards Creek ().\nHistory\nThe Koobenpul lived on the mainland coastal strip stretching from Talwarrapin (Redland Bay) to the mouth of the Mairwar (Brisbane River), including the area now known as Ormiston. Canoe trees and a bora ring from pre-settlement days still remain along Hilliards Creek.\nOriginally part of the township of Cleveland, early industry included a brickworks established by James Maskell on the eastern bank of Hilliards Creek in 1852 and fellmongery (wool scour) owned by a Thomas Blacket Stephens until the early 1860s. Joseph Clark raised cattle in the district from 1855 until he relinquished the lease in 1858.\nLand around Ormiston was bought in 1853 by Captain Louis Hope, a Scottish aristocrat and a founder of the Queensland sugar industry.

It has an ornamental garden that dates from the building of the house. Hope continued with his plantation until 1875, until he lost a dispute over access to his sugar mill and decided to dismantle it. Since the 1960s the house has been a museum.
