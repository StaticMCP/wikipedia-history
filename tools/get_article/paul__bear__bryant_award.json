There are two awards. One of them—the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Coach of the Year Award—has been given annually since 1986 to NCAA college football's national coach of the year. The Award was named in honor of longtime Alabama coach Bear Bryant after he died of a heart attack in 1983, just four weeks after he retired as the Alabama Crimson Tide coach. The award is voted on by the National Sports Media Association (formerly the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association) and proceeds from the awards ceremony benefit the Houston chapter of the American Heart Association, which is the organizing sponsor—since 1986, at the request of the Bryant family—and which obtains a \"presenting sponsor\" (currently Marathon Oil Corporation). The College Football Coach of the Year Award began in 1957 and was renamed for Bryant in 1986. Bryant himself won the AFCA Coach of the Year award in 1961, 1971, and 1973.\nAccording to the official website:\nThe Paul Bear Bryant College Football Coaching Awards is an exclusive event that honors a college football coach whose great accomplishments, both on and off the field, are legendary.  The award recognizes the masters of coaching and allows them to take their deserved place in history beside other legends like Bear Bryant.\nUnlike many college football head coaching awards, it is presented after each season's bowl games.\nIn 2000, the AHA began presenting a second award, the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Lifetime Achievement Award. A third award, the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Newcomer Coach of the Year Award, was added in 2023, honoring the top coach in his first season as a head coach in Division I FBS.\nWinners\n:Note: The year indicates the season for which the award was presented. The award is presented in January of the following year.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
