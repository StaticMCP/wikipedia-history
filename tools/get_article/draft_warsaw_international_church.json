According to the church's historical account, it was the first English-language church to worship publicly in the city after the fall of communism. The church is located at 21B Miodowa Street, on the edge of Warsaw's Old Town.\nWIC is registered as a church in Poland and as a not-for-profit corporation in the U.S. Its congregation is composed of worshippers from various countries and continents. A 1994 report noted the church included around 70 families from nations such as the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, Korea, Finland, and the Netherlands, alongside Polish citizens.\nLocation and Worship\nWIC worship services are held in the headquarters building of the Polish Lutheran Church, located at Miodowa 21B, 00-246 Warszawa. Services take place every Sunday at 11:00 AM on the second floor, with the entrance on Schillera Street. A fellowship hour with refreshments follows the worship service.\nHistory\nWarsaw International Church was established on June 15, 1984, and celebrated its fortieth anniversary on June 15, 2024.\nFounding in Communist Poland (1984–1989)\nThe church's first service was held on October 28, 1984, during a period of political tension in Warsaw following the lifting of martial law. The political context included the government of General Wojciech Jaruzelski and the murder of activist priest Jerzy Popiełuszko that same month.\nThe first worship service took place in the U.S. Embassy cafeteria and was attended by approximately 25 expatriates. The founding was initiated by U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission David Swartz, who stated his own need for religious worship as a motivating factor. Due to political sensitivities, WIC's founders discouraged local Poles from attending, and Swartz personally drove Polish clergy to the embassy to prevent potential harassment by security forces.\nIn the fall of 1985, the congregation voted to seek a resident pastor, using the Moscow Chaplaincy as a model for seeking financial support from American churches.\nCurrent Pastorate (Harry Irrgang)\nThe current pastor, Harry Irrgang, began his tenure in November 2017.\nIrrgang was born in Birmingham, England, in 1951 to German parents who had lived in Poland before World War II. He holds a Ph.D. from the University of Wales on the medieval theologian Meister Eckhart. After reporting a call to become a pastor, he came to Poland to learn the Polish language from 1978 to 1980. He and his wife, Ania, moved to Poland permanently in 1986.\nIn 2013, he was asked by the Polish Lutheran pastor to teach English Christmas carols, which led to the formation of an English-language fellowship group. In 2017, the WIC Church Council invited him to become pastor, which Irrgang described as the fulfillment of his earlier calling.\nCommunity and Governance\nThe church serves an international congregation that includes long-term residents, visitors, students, and business travelers. Due to the transient nature of its expatriate members, the congregation has historically experienced a high turnover, with many members staying in Warsaw for only a few years on special work projects.\nOutreach and Mission\nCurrent activities include Sunday School, coffee hours, and fellowship meetings. The church is also involved in community support; historically, this has included fundraising events such as a 1991 auction to support a local orphanage. More recently, members of the congregation have assisted Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nChurch Council\nThe Church Council is elected by the congregation to manage financial, program, and other church matters. It also appoints the pastor.\nPastoral Leadership\n*   Rev. Greg Seeber (United Church of Christ) became WIC's first resident pastor in 1986. His tenure coincided with the 1989 Round Table talks that began the process of dismantling communism.\n*   Rev. Richard E. Lake assumed his duties on September 1, 1989, for a three-year term. His appointment was jointly sponsored by a consortium of churches, including the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Reformed Church in America. During his four years, attendance grew from around 20 to over 100, and in 1991 the church moved its services to the Polish Lutheran Church headquarters.\n*   Pastor Jack Hustad (1993–1994) organized the first Inter-faith Thanksgiving Worship in Warsaw.\n*   Pastor Bill Anderson (1994–1999) led WIC to become financially self-sufficient by 1998.\n*   Pastor Mark Atkinson arrived in September 1999 but resigned in the spring of 2000.\n*   Pastor Gene Preston served as an interim pastor from 2001–2002 and again from 2007–2008.\n*   Pastor Kerry Purselle (United Methodist Church) served from 2002–2004. She was WIC's first female pastor and the first ordained woman in Poland to assume full pastoral duties.\n*   Pastor Beth Huwiler served from 2005–2007.\n*   Pastor Murray Gow from New Zealand served from 2008 to 2010, becoming the church's first non-American pastor.\n*   Young Osawaru served as pastor from 2010 until October 2017.\nReferences"
