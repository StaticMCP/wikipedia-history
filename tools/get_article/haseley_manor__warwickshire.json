It has walls of rock-faced stone and plain tile roofs, and is in the Gothic and Elizabethan styles, including a Gothic turret. It has been Grade II listed since January 1987, giving it legal protection from unauthorised alterations or demolition.\nUses\nIn 1930, the house was acquired by the Birmingham Society for the Care of Invalid Children, and put to use as a convalescent home and hospital school for girls. It was then purchased by Birmingham Education Authority and, from 1941, became Haseley Hall Residential Open-Air School For Boys, and was used as a children's home and orphanage.\nAt some subsequent point it was owned by W & T Avery. By the mid-1960s, it was being used as staff college by the British Motor Corporation, and its nationalised successor, British Leyland. It was next used as a business and conference centre.\nIt was acquired subsequently by Spitfire Bespoke Homes who subdivided and converted it into a number of private residences, completed circa 2018, including thirteen one, two and three-bedroom apartments. An additional nine residences, including three garden villas and five terraced houses, were created in its grounds. The project architect was Mike Lapworth.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.facadeexperts.co.uk/case_studies/haseley-manor-warwick/ Haseley Manor, Warwick] – includes aerial footage"
