The Odessa Soviet's governing body was the Rumcherod, formed in May 1917 shortly after the February Revolution. After its Second Congress, the OSR's Soviet was chaired by Vladimir Yudovsky. He had been installed after a pro-Bolshevik coup d'état organized by the Narkom Nikolai Krylenko.\nIn January 1918, Yudovsky was appointed Chairman of the local Council of the People's Commissars and formed a government that included Bolsheviks, anarchists and members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The government proclaimed Odessa a free city and pledged allegiance to the Bolshevik government in Petrograd. The following month, the government was liquidated by Mikhail Muravyov and merged with the regional Central Executive Committee Rumcherod.\nPolitical instability meant that the OSR was not recognized by any other government, including Russian Bolsheviks, during its brief existence. The Republic failed to stop the Romanian occupation of Bessarabia, a region to which it laid claim. It ceased to exist altogether when it was sacked by German and Austro-Hungarian troops on 13 March 1918, two months after its creation, following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Central Powers, Ukrainian People's Republic and Petrograd Sovnarkom. The government and army evacuated first to Nikolayev, then to Sevastopol and finally to Rostov-on-Don.\nSee also\n*Mishka Yaponchik, sponsor of the city and anti-bourgeoisie fighter.\n*Special Odessa Army\n*Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919\n*Rumcherod, the governing body of the Odessa Soviet Republic.\n*Iona Yakir\n*Iași–Don March\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://odesskiy.com/chisto-fakti-iz-zhizni-i-istorii/odesskaja-sovetskaja-respublika-bylo-i-takoe-gosudarstvo.html Odesa Soviet Republic on odesskiy.com]\n* [http://leksika.com.ua/14360106/legal/odeska_radyanska_respublika Odesa Soviet Republic on leksika.com.ua]"
