In 1952, during the visit of President Dwight Eisenhower, General Motors Peron gave him a Cadillac convertible that would be used in all ceremonies of inauguration, to Néstor Kirchner. The vehicle is equipped with advanced equipment for its time, with up power windows, leather upholstery and telephone. Raúl Alfonsín, for his part, used a Renault 25. The car was spacious in the back and had a computer that interacts with the driver in a Spanish accent (a kind of GPS for the 1980s). It reported the amount of fuel in the tank and the opening of doors, among other data. Today, old cars gave way to a new breed of imported cars. Cristina Fernández de Kirchner used different models of the Volkswagen Group (Audi A6 (mostly), a Volkswagen Passat CC, and a Volkswagen Vento (Volkswagen Bora/Jetta IV)). All of them are armored and are matte black.\nHistory\nDuring the presidency of Perón it was used a Cabriolet.
