In July, they crossed the Danube and invaded the Austrian Banat. It was only in mid-August that Emperor Joseph II was able to send a corps of 20,400 soldiers to Banat.\nThe Ottoman defeats at the Battle of Focșani and the Bodza Pass seemingly had a detrimental effect on the Turks' willingness to advance into the Zsupanek Valley. The commander there, Mehemed Pasha, withdrew his forces, leaving only Mehadia occupied. Upon hearing this news, Fieldzeugmeister Clerfayt decided to act immediately. On August 17, he set out from Caransebeș, drove away the Ottoman vanguard stationed at Bolvasnitzabach, captured Mehadia in the afternoon, and fortified the surrounding hills.\nIn the following days, reconnaissance patrols reported that Mehemed Pasha had not evacuated Banat but was advancing towards Mehadia. However, due to his lack of numerical superiority, Clerfayt decided to halt the enemy's advance Mehadia.\nBattle\nOn the evening of August 27, the Ottomans approached Teplen (*Hungarian: Toplec) and Chaplija Mountain, preparing to attack Clerfayt's Austrian positions near Mehadia.\nOn the morning of August 28, the Ottomans occupied the elevated Lasmar Plain and launched an attack. A 2,000-strong cavalry force struck the right flank of the Austrian positions, while **3,000 Janissaries** with **five cannons deployed in the valley and attacked the central earthworks. However, the Ottoman vanguard's attack was not supported by the main force and was repelled. The Ottomans then began building fortificationsaround their positions.\nSeeing the enemy's indecisiveness Clerfayt decided to counterattack. He sent five battalions and 22 squadrons, supported by artillery, to strike the Ottoman position  on thLasmar Heights. Thanks to effective artillery fire and an infantry assault, the enemy was thrown into disarray. Clerfayt then reinforced the attack with his entire cavalry force, which completely shattered the Ottoman ranks.\nThe Ottomans attempted to counterattack the Austrian right flank to halt the advance in the center, but they were cut off and driven into the mountains\nThe Austrian cavalry pursued the fleeing Ottomans as long as the terrain allowed. The Ottoman army suffered around 1,000 casualties, lost all of its cannons and five banners. Austrian losses were 29 killed and 79 wounded.\nAftermath\nAs a result of the Austrian victory at Mehadia Banat was reclaimed  and the Austrian army proceeded with the Siege of Belgrade (1789)\nReferences\n:Category:Austro-Turkish Wars\n:Category:1789 in the Ottoman Empire\n:Category:Conflicts in 1789\n:Category:History of Banat\n:Category:Military history of the Habsburg monarchy\n:Category:Military history of the Ottoman Empire\n:Category:1789 in Europe"
