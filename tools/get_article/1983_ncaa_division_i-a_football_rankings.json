Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a national championship, instead that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px
