Afghanistan's culture is historically strongly connected to nearby Persia, including the same religion, as the people of both countries have lived together for thousands of years. Its location at the crossroads of Central, South and West Asia historically made it a hub of diversity, dubbed by one historian as the \"roundabout of the ancient world\".\nAfghanistan is a mostly tribal society with different regions of the country having their own subculture. Despite this, nearly all Afghans follow Islamic traditions, celebrate the same holidays, dress the same, consume the same food, listen to the same music and use Persian as the inter-ethnic lingua franca to a certain extent. Its culture is strongly tied with elements of Central Asia, which can be seen in the likes of language, cuisine and classical music.\nAfghan culture is increasingly becoming a dynamic realm of academic study. In more recent history, Afghan culture has been threatened and fragmented due to the prolonged conflict in the country.\nHistory\nMusic and dance\n.]]\nTraditionally, only men have been involved in theater acting. Recently, in theater arts, women have begun to take center stage.\nSince the 1980s, the nation has witnessed several wars so music has been suppressed and recording for outsiders minimal. During the 1990s, the Taliban government banned instrumental music and much public music-making. Many musicians and singers continued to play their trade in the cities of other countries. Pakistani cities such as Peshawar, Quetta are important centers for the distribution of Afghan music. Kabul has long been the regional cultural capital, but outsiders have tended to focus on the cities of Herat and Mazar-e-Sharif with its Qataghani style. Lyrics across the country are typically in both Dari-Persian and Pashto, Uzbeki, Hazaragi, Hindi, and western style songs and music are also very popular in Afghanistan.\n]]\nAfghans enjoy music by playing many types of instruments. They also enjoy performing the Attan, which is considered the national dance of Afghanistan. What is typically heard in the country are folk songs or ballads. Many of the songs are known by almost everyone and have been around for many years. The main traditional Afghan music instruments include:\n* Harmonium\n* Santur\n* Chang\n* Rubab\n* Tabla\n* Sitar\n* Zurna\n* Flute\n* Dayereh\n* Tanbur\n* Dambura\nLanguage and literature\nDari and Pashto are both the official languages of Afghanistan, although Dari (Afghan Persian) serves as the lingua franca for the majority. People in the northern and central areas of the country usually speak Persian/Dari, while those living in the south and east speak Pashto. Afghans living in the western regions of Afghanistan speak both Dari and Pashto. Most citizens are fluent in both languages, especially those living in major cities where the population is multi-ethnic. Several other languages are spoken in their own regions, which includes Uzbek, Turkmen and Balochi. English is gradually becoming popular among the young generation. There are smaller number of Afghans who can understand Russian, mainly among the northern Tajik, Uzbek and Turkmen groups.\nPoetry\nPoetry in Afghanistan has long been a cultural tradition and passion. It is mainly in Persian/Dari and Pashto languages, although in modern times it is also becoming more recognized in Afghanistan's other languages. Classic Persian and Pashto poetry plays an important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include Khushal Khan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Massoud Nawabi, Nazo Tokhi, Ahmad Shah Durrani, and Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi. Some of the famous Persian-language poets and authors from the 10th to 15th centuries are Rumi, Rabi'a Balkhi, Khwaja Abdullah Ansari, Jami, Alisher Navoi, Sanai, Abu Mansur Daqiqi, Farrukhi Sistani, Unsuri, and Anvari. Contemporary Persian language poets and writers include Khalilullah Khalili and Sufi Ashqari.\nProverbs\nAfghans prize wit and cleverness in speech.  \"Zarbul Masalha\" (pronounced zar-bull mah-sal-HAA) means \"proverbs\" in Dari, and these zarbul masalha deeply reflect Afghan culture.  U.S. Navy Captain Edward Zellem pioneered the use of Afghan proverbs as a positive relationship-building tool during the war in Afghanistan, and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections of Afghan proverbs in Dari and English.\nNaming customs and honorifics\nPet keeping\ns in cages at a farm in Nangarhar Province, used for the pleasure of the site's farmers]]\nBirds are the most popular animals that are kept as pets in Afghanistan. In Kabul there is a dedicated daily market selling a wide variety of birds from around the world.\nArchitecture\nin the western Afghan city of Herat]]\nThe important architectural sites are found in Herat, Mazar-I-Sharif, Ghazni, Qandahar, and Firuzkoh in Ghor Province.\nThe region has made major contributions to the world's architecture. UNESCO has acknowledged Afghanistan's role by declaring the Minaret of Jam and the Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed in 2001, World Heritage Sites.\nHousing\nHouses in rural Afghanistan historically have been made of mudbricks and mud, and have a series of rooms located around a private rectangular courtyard where women and children can move around without being seen by the public. In recent years, however, Afghans living in rural areas began building their homes using cement and bricks, similar as those built in the big cities. In the north and west they are typically in fortified villages called qalahs (\"fortresses\"), whereas in the mountainous northern and eastern regions they differ, for example wooden multistoried dwellings in Nuristan.\nMarried sons often share houses with their parents, but with separate quarters. Afghan houses contain a special room where men socialize with each other known as a hujra. In the major cities, many Afghans live in modern houses or apartments. The nomadic kuchi people live in large tents because they are constantly on the move from one part of the country to another. The nomads of Turkic or Mongol origin in the north tend to live in yurts.\nAfghanistan_hill_houses.jpg|A mud brick house on a mountainside - a common sight in the hilly areas of the Afghan countryside\nTraditional houses outside Herat, Afghanistan - 4111438627.jpg|Traditional brick homes common in the lower elevated regions in the north and west\nMoutain Villa - Flickr - philmofresh.jpg|Nested homes in the forest region\nAfghan Nomads from the early 20th century.jpg|A yurt, most likely in north-eastern Afghanistan\nArt, weaving, ceramics\n.]]\nThe lands of Afghanistan have a long history of art, with the world's earliest known usage of Buddha's oil painting found in cave murals in the country.

The Afghanistan women's national football team was formed in 2007. The Ghazi Stadium, which was built during the reign of King Amanullah Khan, was once used for a venue for public executions by the Taliban government. The stadium is currently used mostly for football matches between teams from different provinces of the country as well as neighboring countries. Basketball has existed in Afghanistan since at least the 1970s, and is slowly becoming popular again. It is played by both Afghan men and women.

The Ahmad Shah Baba High School and Zarghuna Anna High School are two of the oldest schools in Kandahar.\nSince the country has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, the United States began establishing a number of Lincoln learning centers to help with this problem and promote American culture in Afghanistan. They are set up to serve as programming platforms offering English language classes, library facilities, programming venues, Internet connectivity, educational and other counseling services. A goal of the program is to reach at least 4,000 Afghan citizens per month per location. The military and national police are now provided with mandatory literacy courses. In addition to this, Baghch-e-Simsim (based on the American Sesame Street) was launched in late 2011 to help Afghan children learn from preschool onward.

Some of the most important include Eid al-Fitr (end of Ramadan), Eid al-Adha, Ashura, and Mawlid, while the religious minorities of Afghanistan celebrate holidays unique to their respective religion.\nTraditional\nFarmer's Day, also known as Nauruz (Nowruz), is an ancient annual Afghan festival which celebrates both the beginning of spring and the New Year. The observances usually last two weeks, culminating on the first day of the Afghan New Year, March 21, and corresponds to the first day of the Persian Calendar.\nNauruz is related to a religion called Zoroastrianism which was in practice in ancient Persia before the emergence of Islam. This festival is to celebrate the arrival of spring as plants, trees, and flowers start to bloom making the weather pleasant. On the day of Nauruz, families usually celebrate the festival by cooking food and going out for a picnic. Families cook various kinds of meals, Samanak, and Haft-mewah or dry fruits that start with the letter (س) or (S) which represents the arrival of spring season. Haft-mewah contains seven dry fruits which families place in warm water two to three days before Nauruz. Samanak is another type of dessert made from wheat and sugar. Women usually get together days before Nauruz to prepare Samanak. They pour the ingredients into a big pot placed on an open fire and take turns to stir the wheat and sugar in the pot before it turns into a thick paste. Once prepared, the dessert is then served on the day of Nauruz.\nNational\n*Afghan Independence Day (19 August 19)\n*Mujahideen Victory Day (April 28)\nOther\n* International Women's Day (March 8)\n* Remembrance Day for Martyrs and Disabled (September 9)\nSee also\n* Bacha Bazi\n* Demography of Afghanistan\n* Postage stamps and postal history of Afghanistan\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n;Folktale collections:\n*\n*\n**  (partial translation of the above)\n*\n* Mills, Margaret A.
