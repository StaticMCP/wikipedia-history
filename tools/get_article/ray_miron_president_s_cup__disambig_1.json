The trophy was known as The William \"Bill\" Levins Memorial Cup''' from 1992 until 2000, when the honour was renamed the Ray Miron Cup. (Bill Levins and Ray Miron being the co-founders of the CHL). From 1997-2001, the WPHL's playoff champion was awarded the \"President's Cup\", so when the CHL and the Western Professional Hockey League merged following their 2000-01 seasons, the CHL combined the traditions of the two leagues by renaming the trophy the \"Ray Miron President's Cup\".\nThe \"Playoff Most Valuable Player\" award was also given out as part of the Ray Miron President's Cup Championship ceremonies. Ron Handy is the only player to win the award on multiple occasions.\n14 different franchises won the CHL Championship, with six of them (Wichita, Oklahoma City, Memphis/Mississippi, Laredo, Colorado and Allen) winning twice. The five franchises hold the record for most championships won with two. Current possession of the trophy belongs to the Allen Americans, who won it in 2014 with a 4–1 victory over the Denver Cutthroats becoming only the third CHL team to win back-to-back championships.\nList of Central Hockey League Champions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=5 |The William \"Bill\" Levins Memorial Cup (1992–2000)\n|-\n!Season\n!Winning team\n!Score\n!Losing team\n!MVP\n|-\n| 1992–93 || Tulsa Oilers  || align=center| 4–1|| Oklahoma City Blazers || Tony Fiore\n|-\n| 1993–94 || Wichita Thunder  || align=center| 4–0|| Tulsa Oilers || Ron Handy\n|-\n| 1994–95 || Wichita Thunder  || align=center| 4–2|| San Antonio Iguanas || Ron Handy\n|-\n| 1995–96 || Oklahoma City Blazers  || align=center| 4–3 || San Antonio Iguanas || Jean-Ian Filiatrault\n|-\n| 1996–97 || Fort Worth Fire  || align=center| 4–3|| Memphis RiverKings || Steve Plouffe\n|-\n| 1997–98 || Columbus Cottonmouths  || align=center| 4–0|| Wichita Thunder || Mike Martens\n|-\n| 1998–99 || Huntsville Channel Cats  || align=center| 4–2|| Oklahoma City Blazers || Derek Puppa\n|-\n| 1999–00 || Indianapolis Ice  || align=center| 4–3|| Columbus Cottonmouths || Jamie Morris\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=5 |Ray Miron Cup (2000–2001)\n|-\n!Season\n!Winning team\n!Score\n!Losing team\n!MVP\n|-\n| 2000–01 || Oklahoma City Blazers  || align=center| 4–1|| Columbus Cottonmouths || Rod Branch\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=5 |Ray Miron President's Cup (2001–2014)\n|-\n!Season\n!Winning team\n!Score\n!Losing team\n!MVP\n|-\n| 2001–02 || Memphis RiverKings  || align=center| 4–1|| Austin Ice Bats || Don Parsons\n|-\n| 2002–03 || Memphis RiverKings  || align=center| 4–1|| Austin Ice Bats || Kahlil Thomas\n|-\n| 2003–04 || Laredo Bucks  || align=center| 4–3|| Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs || David Guerrera\n|-\n| 2004–05 || Colorado Eagles  || align=center| 4–1|| Laredo Bucks || Chris Hartsburg\n|-\n| 2005–06 || Laredo Bucks  || align=center| 4–1|| Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs || Jeff Bes\n|-\n| 2006–07 || Colorado Eagles  || align=center| 4–2|| Laredo Bucks || Greg Pankewicz\n|-\n| 2007–08 || Arizona Sundogs  || align=center| 4–0|| Colorado Eagles || Rob McVicar\n|-\n| 2008–09 || Texas Brahmas  || align=center| 4-1|| Colorado Eagles || Jason Deitsch\n|-\n| 2009–10 || Rapid City Rush  || align=center| 4-3|| Allen Americans || Les Reaney\n|-\n| 2010–11 || Bossier-Shreveport Mudbugs  || align=center| 4-3|| Colorado Eagles || Jeff Kyrzakos\n|-\n| 2011–12 || Fort Wayne Komets  || align=center| 4-1|| Wichita Thunder || Mike Vaskivuo\n|-\n| 2012–13 || Allen Americans  || align=center| 4-3|| Wichita Thunder || Brian McMillin\n|-\n| 2013–14 || Allen Americans  || align=center| 4-1|| Denver Cutthroats || Jamie Schaafsma\n|}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.intotheboards.net/hockey2/playoffs/chl-playoffs-2009.html Intotheboards.net Playoffs]"
