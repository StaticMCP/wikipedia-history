Spain acceded on 7 May 1669.\nTerms of the treaty\nThe treaty was mediated and guaranteed by the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden at the First Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle. By the terms of the treaty, Louis XIV returned three cities, Cambrai (Kamerijk), Aire (Ariën aan de Leie), and Saint-Omer (Sint-Omaars) to Spain. He also returned the province of Franche-Comté. On the other hand, he kept Armentières (Armentiers), Bergues (Sint-Winoksbergen), Charleroi, Courtrai (Kortrijk), Douai (Dowaai), Furnes (Veurne), Lille (Rijsel), Oudenarde (Oudenaarde, Audenarde), and Tournai  (Doornik). Lille, Armentières, Bergues and Douai were considered essential to reinforce France's vulnerable northern border and remain French to this day, while the retention of Tournai, Oudenarde, Courtrai, Veurne, Binche, Charleroi and Ath were deemed necessary to facilitate future offensives in the Spanish Netherlands and the Dutch Republic.\nThe treaty left to France all its conquests in Flanders in 1667. This was a vague provision; after the Peace of Nijmegen (1679), Louis XIV took advantage of it to occupy a number of villages and towns he adjudged to be dependencies of the cities and territories acquired in 1668.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\n*Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n* Also  and\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192313/http://www.ieg-mainz.de/likecms/index.php?site=transliteration.htm&dir=&treaty=225 Transcription of the treaty (in French, IEG Mainz)]\n*"
