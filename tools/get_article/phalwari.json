When it rains, the village offers a stunning view of the beautiful Kashmir mountains.\nPhalwari has a unique characteristic where every fourth man from the village resides abroad. The village graveyard is situated towards the northern side.There are 4 mosques in village.

They believe in the power of sports and education to shape a brighter future for their community.\nOur grandmother often told us that there used to be a princess living in her palace here, but then a flood came and washed everything away. After that, for a long time, when the land was being leveled near the graveyard, farmers would find many things, like buried treasures.\nMost Important: The Phalwari's girls are exceptionally talented, surpassing the boys in their abilities.\nReferences\n*"
