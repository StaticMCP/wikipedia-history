It is located on the southwest corner of Strathcona Avenue and Blake Street, directly adjacent to the Eastview Neighbourhood Community Centre, home of the Eastview Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada.\nThe park has a variety of outdoor amenities, including a baseball diamond, an outdoor wading pool and a playground.  The park's primary use is for baseball games, and has a wired field screen as a part of the baseball diamond, open year-round for the public. The baseball diamond is listed under the Classification C type, given its relatively small size and unirrigated turf.\nHistory\nThe park's original name was Eastview Park, however, after a tragic slaying of a local youth worker in December 2003, the park was renamed in his honour. The official renaming of the park took place on May 11, 2007, with a local councillor, as well as several community and family members of the slain worker in attendance. This park has since been adopted as a playground not only for the youth in the Boys & Girls Club, but for the kids and youth of the Blake/Boultbee community as well. Kempton Howard (whom the park was named after) was an active staff member of the Boys & Girls Club before his death.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.torontohistory.org/Pages_JKL/Kempton_Howard_Park.html Toronto's Historical Plaques: Kempton Howard Park]"
