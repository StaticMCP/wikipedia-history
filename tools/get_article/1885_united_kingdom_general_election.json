The first general election after an extension of the franchise and redistribution of seats, it saw the Liberals lose their majority.\nThe election saw the Liberals, led by William Gladstone, win the most seats, but not an overall majority, so a minority government was necessary. The Irish Nationalists held the balance of power between the Liberals and the Conservatives who sat with a large number of allied Unionist MPs (their name referred to their support for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland). The pressure of minority government status exacerbated divisions within the Liberals over Irish Home Rule. This led to a Liberal split that caused another general election the following year.\nThe 1885 election saw the first socialist party participate, with the Social Democratic Federation led by H. M. Hyndman standing three candidates. None were elected.\nResults\n|gain       =\n|loss       =\n|net        = &minus;33\n|votes      = 2,071,868\n|votes %    = 47.65\n|seats %    = 47.61\n|plus/minus = &minus;7.3\n|government = yes\n|vps        = 6,894\n}}\n|}\nElectorate: 5,708,030 (5,429,708 in contested seats)Turnout: 81.2%}}\nVoting summary\n|47.65}}\n|43.00}}\n|6.88}}\n|1.28}}\n|0.38}}\n|0.29}}\n|0.19}}\n|0.15}}\n}}\nSeats summary\n|47.61}}\n|36.87}}\n|12.84}}\n|1.64}}\n|0.60}}\n|0.30}}\n|0.15}}\n}}\nSee also\n*List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election\n*Parliamentary franchise in the United Kingdom 1885–1918\n*Representation of the People Act 1884\n*Redistribution of Seats Act 1885\n*1885 United Kingdom general election in Ireland\n*1885 United Kingdom general election in Scotland\n* Hawarden Kite, Gladstone announces for Home Rule and wins over the Irish\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n* Roberts, Matthew. \"Election Cartoons and Political Communication In Victorian England.'
