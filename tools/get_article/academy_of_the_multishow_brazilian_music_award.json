Composed of professionals connected to the music industry, the Academy has played a fundamental role in the nomination and selection of winners in various categories over the years, constantly being improved to reflect the diversity of Brazilian music.\nOrigin and Formation\nThe idea for the Academy arose from the need to balance the criteria for choosing the award, which had previously been largely defined by popular voting. Starting in 2019, a specialized jury was created, made up of journalists, music critics, representatives from streaming platforms, event promoters, curators from concert venues, record labels, radio hosts, and industry entrepreneurs. The general director of Multishow, Tatiana Costa, highlighted at the time:\n\"We understood that we needed to balance market perception with public voting. We invited experts from all regions of the country to ensure representativeness and technical quality in the process. The intention is that both the industry and the fans help us choose the highlights of the Brazilian music scene from the past year.\"\nSince then, the Academy has established itself as one of the cornerstones of the Prêmio Multishow, being recognized for its representativeness and diversity. The members were selected based on criteria that include gender, race, color, region, and music genres, ensuring broad plurality in the analysis and selection of nominees and winners.\nStructure and Evolution\nThe Academy was initially formed to act as a technical jury responsible for nominating and awarding the highlights of Brazilian music. Over the years, its role and structure have expanded, bringing significant changes to the award format.\n2011-2012: Creation of the Superjury\nIn 2011, the Multishow Jury was introduced, a technical group created to bring more credibility to the process of choosing the winners. This jury was formed by journalists and music critics, with the goal of making more technical choices, less influenced by fanbases.\nIn the 2012 edition, the jury was divided into two instances: the Specialized Jury, which nominated the finalists, and the Superjury, responsible for deciding the winners of some of the main award categories, such as Song of the Year and Album of the Year.  This structure aimed to provide greater transparency and credibility, avoiding the influence of fan club votes or choices made without further discussion. The Superjury was made up of 11 specialists, who met live during the awards ceremony to decide the winners of the most important categories. The debate among them was broadcast live on the internet, with flashes on TV, until, at the end of the ceremony, they announced their choices to the public.\n2013-2017: Consolidation of the Superjury and Live Debate\nBetween 2013 and 2017, the award format continued with the three main juries: the Public Jury (voting via the internet), the Specialized Jury (formed by over 100 critics, journalists, musicians, and professionals from the music industry), and the Superjury (composed of 10 personalities from the music market). During these editions, the Specialized Jury nominated the winners of some categories, such as Best Music Video and Cover of the Year, while the Superjury was responsible for categories like Best New Artist, Best Album, and Best Show. The New Song category was the only one voted on by all three juries.\nThe Superjury debates were broadcast live on Canal Bis, allowing the public to follow the experts' arguments before the winners were decided. This structure aimed to provide a more in-depth technical evaluation while maintaining the democratic and participatory nature of the award.\n2019-2021: Creation of the Academy and New Format\nThe Academy debuted by being responsible for nominating the finalists in 15 categories of the award. With the establishment of the Multishow Music Award Academy in 2019, the Superjury was composed of the Academy members, who were professionals from the music industry. Thus, the debates about the winners and the selection of the categories began to be done internally, reflecting the technical knowledge and opinions of industry professionals. The voting process was further deepened, with greater transparency in the selection of finalists and winners.\nThe debates about the categories, which were previously broadcast live on Canal Bis, continued to be held, but with a format more integrated into the Academy's decision-making process.\n2022: Nominations and Decisions\nThe Academy maintained its role of nominating finalists in 13 categories and selecting winners in three of them, while the other ten categories continued to be decided by public voting and the superjury. This structure ensured a balanced division between technical perception and public involvement.\n2023: Expansion and dilution of the superjury\nIn 2023, with the expansion of the Multishow Award Academy to over 900 members and the reformulation of the award format, the Superjury was dissolved. The Academy became responsible for selecting the winners in almost all categories, while only a few categories remained open to public voting. With this change, the parallel voting process between the public and the Superjury was eliminated, and the Academy consolidated itself as the main decision-making body of the Award.\n* The group became responsible for nominating the finalists in 23 categories and deciding the winners in 17 of them. The other categories remained under public voting.\n* The composition of the jury reinforced diversity in gender, race, color, region, and music genres, consolidating the Academy as a reflection of Brazilian plurality.\n2024: Consolidation of Representativity\nIn the 2024 edition, the Academy maintained its structure with around 900 members. They were responsible for selecting the finalists and winners in 18 categories, while the public vote determined the winners in the remaining categories.\nFunctions and Impact\nThe Academy plays two main roles in the process of the Multishow Award:\n# Finalists Selection: Since 2019, the Academy has been responsible for selecting the artists who stood out in their respective categories. In 2023, this responsibility was expanded to 23 categories.\n# Winner Decision: In addition to selecting, the Academy determines the winners of most categories. Over time, the number of categories under its responsibility has grown, reaching 17 in 2023 and 19 in 2024.\nThe introduction of the Academy and its integration with the Superjury brought new evaluation formats, promoting greater representativeness and credibility to the process.\nDiversity and Representativity\nOne of the greatest strengths of the Academy is its diverse composition. The members are selected to represent the diversity of Brazilian music, including professionals from all regions of the country and from a wide range of musical styles. This commitment to ethnic, cultural, and regional diversity has been fundamental in ensuring that the Multishow Award continues to be a comprehensive and inclusive celebration of Brazilian music.\nLegacy and relevance\nSince its creation, the Prêmio Multishow Academy has been a landmark of credibility and innovation in the Brazilian music scene. Its presence introduced a new dynamic to the award, balancing technical and popular voting while promoting greater representativeness. The success of the model implemented by the Academy is reflected in its acceptance by both the industry and the public, solidifying the Prêmio Multishow as the leading celebration of music in Brazil.\nReferences"
