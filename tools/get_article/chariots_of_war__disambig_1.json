It is set in the ancient Near East.\nGameplay\nThe strategic layer of Chariots of War is turn-based, though unlike Civilization, the focus is almost entirely on real-time tactical combat. The game is similar to Slitherine's earlier wargame Legion, and uses the same graphics engine.\nThere are 58 different civilizations to play, all divided into the following ethnic groups:\n* Assyrian\n* Bedouin\n* Egyptian\n* Hittites\n* Mitanni\n* Nubian\n* Skythian (Scythian)\n* Summerian (Sumerian)\n* Syrian\n* Tribal\nThere are nine different resources to collect (food, building materials, copper, tin, wood, gold, gems, incense, and horses), which are used to construct buildings and units. While trade and diplomacy do feature in the game, they are of lesser importance, as conquest is the only way to attain victory.\nThe battles themselves take place on a separate deployment screen. The player's forces are positioned across one third of the battlefield, and the player alters their formations and gives certain orders. As in Legion, the actual fighting is automated, so the initial orders are the only input in the battle until it is over.\nThe game features both campaign and non-campaign modes of play.\nReception\n| CGW =\n| GSpot = 6/10\n| GSpy =\n| GameZone = 7.4/10\n| IGN = 5/10\n| PCGUK = 24%\n| PCGUS = 58%\n| PCZone = 47%\n}}\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
