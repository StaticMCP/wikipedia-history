It is situated on the Zürich–Winterthur railway line, which was built by the Swiss Northeastern Railway ().\nThe route towards  leads over the Wipkingen viaduct (Wipkinger Viadukt). Immediately at the northern end of the station, the Wipkingen Tunnel starts and connects it to Zürich Oerlikon.\nService\nWipkingen station is served only by S-Bahn-style regional trains. As of December 2022, the station is served half-hourly by line S24 of the Zürich S-Bahn.\n*\nHistory\nThe station lies on the oldest of several rail routes from the city center to the northern part of Zürich. Although the Zürich–Winterthur railway line opened in 1856, Wipkingen did not get its own railway station before 2 October 1932. Between 1908 and 1968, a tram (line 4) connected Escher-Wyss Platz with Röschlibachplatz adjacent to Wipkingen station. Urban transport has since been replaced by trolleybus services (lines 33 and 46).\nPrior to the opening of the Weinberg Tunnel on 14 June 2014, this station was served by Zürich S-Bahn lines S2, S8 and S14. These lines now run via the new tunnel route, and the half-hourly S24 was extended from Hauptbahnhof further north in order to ensure that Wipkingen did not lose rail service.\nInterCity, EuroCity or RegioExpress services to/from destinations to the north or northeast that use the surface tracks of  (most with Zürich HB as their terminus) still use this line, but they do not call at Wipkingen station.\nThe station was refurbished in 2024. Its island platform was replaced by two side platforms. During the construction phase, the entire section between Zürich HB and Wipkingen was out of service between 10 December 2023 and 14 December 2024. During this time, trains of S24 service operated only between Wipkingen and Thayngen/Weinfelden and between Zürich HB and Zug.\nGallery\nFile:Zürich Wipkingen railway station2.jpg|Tracks and side platforms of the refurbished station in 2025\nFile:NordbrWipkingenI.jpg|View from the former island platform towards the portal of the Wipkingen Tunnel.\nFile:StatioWipkingenI.jpg|View from the former island platform towards South.\nFile:StatioWipkingenII.jpg|Track 1 of the station and former island platform.\nFile:Zuerich Nordbruecke.jpg|IC train of SBB emerging from the Wipkingen tunnel\nFile:SBB Historic - F 122 01246 003 - Zuerich Wipkingen Stationsgebaeude Bahnseite.jpg|Wipkingen station building.\nFile:All roads heading to Zürich - panoramio.jpg|Zürich S-Bahn RABe 514 EMU on the Wipkinger Viadukt (the closed line to  was repurposed as a pedestrian/bicycle route).\nFile:Aussersihler Viadukt - 2013-12-17 - Weihnächtliche Beleuchtung - Bild 6.JPG|Illuminated Wipkinger Viadukt with shops (Im Viadukt).\nSee also\n* List of railway stations in Zurich\n* Public transport in Zurich\n* Rail transport in Switzerland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
