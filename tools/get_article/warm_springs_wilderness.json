The Black Mesa is the southernmost section of the Black Mountains of western Mohave County, in northwest Arizona. The region is in the east and southeast of the Mojave Desert of Arizona, southern Nevada, and California.\nThe wilderness is  southwest of Kingman, Arizona and  east of Mohave Valley, Arizona and Needles, California. Oatman, AZ lies on its northwest perimeter, adjacent to the Boundary Cone landmark; Yucca, AZ is on its east in the south-central Sacramento Valley on Interstate 40 in Arizona which traverses due-south from Kingman, then turns due west of the Black Mesa and Warm Springs Wilderness perimeter to meet Needles, California, on the Colorado River.\nThe wilderness is one of the many wilderness areas located in the Lower Colorado River Valley. The Mount Nutt Wilderness is adjacent north across Sitgreaves Pass, just east of Oatman.\nDescription\nThe wilderness covers the 10&nbsp;mi long mesa, the stretch of the southern Black Mountains, about  in elevation,  and the mesa is bisected by a central southwest-flowing wash, a tributary of the Sacramento Wash, that flows into Topock Marsh at the Colorado River.\nThe wilderness has volcanic plugs to the north in the Mount Nutt Wilderness. One example offset on the Warm Springs border northwest, 4&nbsp;mi south of Oatman, Arizona is Boundary Cone, a major landmark in Mohave Valley's northeast.\nThe various springs located on the mesa's perimeter are highest in water volume following wet winters, or periods of high summer monsoonal weather.\nFlora and fauna\nOne of the major fauna elements is the Desert Bighorn Sheep.\nSee also\n*List of U.S. Wilderness Areas\n*List of Arizona Wilderness Areas\n*Wilderness Act\n*Black Mountains (Arizona)\n*Boundary Cone\n*Mohave & Sacramento Valleys\nReferences\nExternal links\nBLM\n*[https://www.blm.gov/visit/warm-springs-wilderness Warm Springs Wilderness at Bureau of Land Management]\n----\nTrails\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=YagjFX4q5YwC&dq=%22warm+springs+wilderness%22+coordinate&pg=PA130 Arizona Trails West Region, (coordinates)]\n----\n*[http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm?fuse=NWPS&sec=wildView&wname=Warm%20Springs Warm Springs at wilderness.net]\n*[http://www.publiclands.org/graphics/maps/az/az_q12.jpg area map]; [http://www.publiclands.org/explore/site.php?id=643&PHPSESSID=23cfeb7c9 Warm Springs at Public Lands]\n*[http://www.blm.gov/az/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/wildareas/nutt.html Mount Nutt Wilderness, BLM]"
