They combined the results from the previous polls with a new preliminary poll to determine the 18 most admired people. The 1999 final poll produced an ordered list of 18 people, 12 of whom were males and 12 of whom were American citizens; the highest ranked non-American and non-male was (Saint) Mother Teresa, at #1.\nAs of , at , Bill Clinton is the only surviving person on the list. Previously, Ronald Reagan, John Paul II, Margaret Thatcher, Nelson Mandela, and Billy Graham (the longest living person at 99) were all still living by the time the list was published, but they have since died.\nList\nSource: [https://news.gallup.com/poll/3367/mother-teresa-voted-american-people-most-admired-person-century.aspx]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center\";\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" | Rank\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Portrait\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Percentage\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| 1\n|\n| (1910–1997)\n| 49%\n|\n|-\n| 2\n|\n| (1929–1968)\n| 34%\n|\n|-\n| 3\n|\n| (1917–1963)\n| 32%\n|\n|-\n| 4\n|\n| (1879–1955)\n| 31%\n|\n|-\n| 5\n|\n| (1880–1968)\n| 30%\n|\n|-\n| 6\n|\n| (1882–1945)\n| 26%\n|\n|-\n| 7\n|\n| (1918–2018)\n| 26%\n|\n|-\n| 8\n|\n| (1920–2005)\n| 25%\n|\n|-\n| 9\n|\n| (1884–1962)\n| 22%\n|\n|-\n| 10\n|\n| (1874–1965)\n| 20%\n|\n|-\n| 11\n|\n| (1890–1969)\n| 18%\n|\n|-\n| 12\n|\n| (1929–1994)\n| 18%\n|\n|-\n| 13\n|\n| (1869–1948)\n| 18%\n|\n|-\n| 14\n|\n| (1918–2013)\n| 17%\n|\n|-\n| 15\n|\n| (1911–2004)\n| 17%\n|\n|-\n| 16\n|\n| (1863–1947)\n| 15%\n|\n|-\n| 17\n|\n| ( 1946)\n| 10%\n|\n|-\n| 18\n|\n| (1925–2013)\n| 9%\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Gallup's most admired man and woman poll\nReferences"
