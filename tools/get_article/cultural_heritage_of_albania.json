It reflect the influences of various civilizations, including the Illyrians, Romans, Byzantines, and Ottomans, which can be seen in monuments, architecture, music, and folklore. This heritage shows itself in ancient buildings, castles, churches, folk songs, dances, and traditional clothing.\nAncient heritage\n* Illyrian heritage: The foundation of Albanian culture lies in Illyrian and Dardanian traditions, which had unique pagan beliefs and ways of life. The Illyrians are known as the ancestors of the Albanians, with deep influences on the culture and language of the country.\n* Ancient Greek and Roman Influences: With the arrival of ancient Greeks and Romans, Albania and Albanians adopted distinctive architectural styles, evident in Roman amphitheaters and the city of Apollonia. These influences continue to be visible in the country's archaeological sites.\nIntangible heritage\n* Iso-Polyphonic Folk Music: This UNESCO-recognized tradition is a unique vocal music style characterized by complex harmonies and layered melodies. Often sung at festivals and celebrations, it's a powerful expression of Albanian cultural identity. You can find variations like the Labëri style from southern Albania and the Toskëri style from central Albania.\n* Epic Ballads: Albanian folklore thrives on epic poems (Kângë Kreshnikësh) sung by men called \"lahuta players,\" accompanying themselves on a one-stringed instrument called a lahuta. These ballads narrate tales of bravery, historical events, and legendary heroes, keeping traditions alive for generations.\n* Traditional Costumes: While Western styles dominate cities, rural areas showcase a vibrant display of traditional dress. Colorful embroidery, headwear with unique styles like the \"plis\" (folded hat) in southern Albania, and regional variations in clothing styles all contribute to the richness of Albanian attire.
