      "text": "# Beyond World War III\n\nBeyond World War III is an album by the Jamaican musician Mikey Dread, released in 1981. It was the second album to be released by Heartbeat Records and is a slightly different version of 1980's World War III; it was picked up in America due to Dread's increased popularity after working with the Clash. Beyond World War III was reissued in 1997.\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Dread. He was backed by members of the Roots Radics Band, including Style Scott on drums, Bingy Bunny on guitar, and Flabba Holt on bass. \"The Jumping Master\" praises the band as well as fellow producer Scientist, who mixed the album. \"World War III\" warns of a coming warfare apocalypse.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = Lincoln Journal Star\n|rev2score =\n|rev3 = MusicHound World: The Essential Album Guide\n|rev3score =\n|rev4 = Oakland Tribune\n|rev4score =\n|rev5 = Reggae & Caribbean Music\n|rev5score = 7/10\n|rev6 = Rolling Stone\n|rev6score =\n|rev7 = The New Rolling Stone Record Guide\n|rev7score =\n|rev8 = Spin\n|rev8score = 8/10\n|rev9 = The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\n|rev9score =\n}}\nThe Boston Globe said that \"the excellent [Roots Radics Band] thumps out a deliberate riff and sticks to it, while Dread chant-sings along in his good-natured, slightly goofy way.\" The Lincoln Journal Star noted that, compared to Big Youth and Linton Kwesi Johnson, \"Dread has the lightest sound and the catchiest beat\". Rolling Stone praised the \"echoing drums and bass\" and \"smooth yet biting vocals\". The Oakland Tribune called \"Israel (12 Tribe) Stylee\" \"easily one of the strongest dubs ever recorded\".\nIn 1986, the Santa Cruz Sentinel deemed Beyond World War III \"a classic reggae work.\" AllMusic said, \"Dread's vocals are poised and self-assured; he sings when he feels like it, and lets his ping-ponging freestyle raps carry the track when he doesn't.\" Spin noted that Scientist had found \"the Spike Jones in King Tubby.\" Peter Shapiro, in Modulations: A History of Electronic Music, called Beyond World War III a landmark \"in the use of space and effects.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
