R. Narla, was a  Telugu writer, journalist, and politician from Andhra Pradesh, India. He served two terms as a Member of the Rajya Sabha from 3 April 1958 to 2 April 1970. Rao authored a satakam in Telugu along with numerous other literary works.\nEarly life and career\nRao was born in Sagar, Madhya Pradesh, on December 1, 1908. He had a sister known as Laxmi Bai had two brothers, Narla Gowri Shankar Rao and Narla Tata Rao.[citation needed]He moved to Hyderabad in the late 1960s, and the city eventually became the primary publishing center for the Andhra Jyothi daily newspaper.\nCareer\nJournalism\nRao began his journalism career as the editor of Andhra Prabha, under the Indian Express Group. He wrote a notable series on Suryadevara Sanjiv Dev from Tummapudi village in Guntur district.\nHe played a leading role in opposing Chief Minister Brahmananda Reddy’s attempt in 1969 to restrict press freedom by introducing a bill aimed at curbing the independence of Andhra Jyothi.\nEditorial work\nRao was profoundly disturbed when the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution were suspended during The emergency of 1975-1977 imposed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In protest, he proposed leaving the editorial column of Andhra Jyothi blank. However, the newspaper's  management overruled his proposal, citing concerns about potential government retaliation and the risk of the newspaper's closure.\nDisillusioned, Rao relocated to the United States to spend time with his seven children and their families. After the Emergency ended, he returned to India and resigned from his position as editor of Andhra Jyothi.\nEarlier, in the late 1940s, he had also attempted to resign from Andhra Prabha in solidarity with journalists protesting Ramnath Goenka decision to disperse the newspaper’s staff to evade government pay regulations. Goenka, however, persuaded him to stay.\nOver time, Rao grew increasingly disenchanted with the Indian National Congress criticizing its demagogic approach to politics. His experiences in the Rajya Sabha exposed him to widespread political corruption, which further deepened his cynicism toward public life.\nPublic speaking\nNarla authored a Telugu play, Seetha Josyam (the prophecy of Seetha), published by the Sahitya Academy. The play garnered considerable attention in religious and literary circles. However, Narla strongly opposed the criticism of the play by the official journal of the Sahitya Academy, contending that as the mouthpiece of the publishers, the journal should not engage in criticism of literary works. This stance also underpinned his decision to decline the Sahitya Academic Award, a move which created a significant impact within literary communities. Narla's monographs on Vemana, Veerasalingam, and Gurajada Appa Rao were translated into several Indian languages.\nPlaywright\nAfter  resigning from his position as newspaper editor, Narla took to writing plays on serious topics, often incorporating extensive prefaces in a manner similar to  George Bernard Shaw's works. One such play, Narakam lo Harischandra (Harischandra in Hell), was dedicated to his longtime friend and journalist Innaiah Narisetti. Another play, based on the mythological story of Draupadi - the common wife of the five Pandava princes - was originally titled Panchali (wife of five persons). However, Narla was unable to complete his characteristic lengthy preface for this work.\nPaatha Kotha, (Old and New), a collection of essays by Narla, was selected as one of the best books in modern Telugu literature. It was also published posthumously by his family members through the New Student Book House, Vijayawada. The volume houses an incomplete essay on Purana Vairagyam. Finally, Narla was working on a project of one thousand verses in Telugu – Narla Maata (Narla's word). Each verse ended with the refrain \"Navayugaala Baata Naarla Maata\" (\"the path of the new age and Narla's word\"). These verses were satirical, critiquing society and stressing human values.\nPersonal life\nRao married Sulochana Devi in 1938. Their eldest son, Mohan Das (politician), became a professor of cell biology in New York City. Two other sons, Durga Das and Lakshman Das, both pursued careers in medicine in the United States. Despite his family’s relocation abroad, Rao chose to stay in India.\nAfter his death on 13 March 1985, his wife donated his personal library to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Open University in Hyderabad, which continues to hold annual memorial lectures in his honor.\nAward in his name\nAn award, Narla Venkateswara Puraskar, was instituted in his name by B.R. Ambedkar Joshua Phule Periyar Literature Foundation. He participated in many debates in the parliament.\nReferences"
