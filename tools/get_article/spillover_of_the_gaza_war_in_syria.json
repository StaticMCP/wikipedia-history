The conflict, originating in the Gaza Strip, has triggered regional tensions and violence, drawing Syria in through direct and indirect confrontations involving Israeli  defense forces, Syrian state actors, and armed groups operating in Syrian territory.\nBackground\nThe Gaza war began when Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which involved a rocket barrage and a few thousand militants breaching the Gaza–Israel barrier, attacking Israeli civilian communities and military bases. During this attack, 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, including 815 civilians. In addition, 251 Israelis and foreigners were taken captive into Gaza, with the stated goal to force Israel to release Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Hamas stated that its attack was in response to Israel's continued occupation, the blockade of Gaza, the expansion of settlements, disregard for international law, as well as alleged threats to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the general plight of Palestinians.\nFollowing the attack, Israel launched one of the most destructive bombing campaigns in modern history and invaded Gaza on 27 October 2023 with the stated objectives of destroying Hamas and freeing hostages. The war resulted in widespread devastation and loss of life, with over 40,000 Palestinians killed as of February 2024. The ongoing war has had significant regional repercussions, including attacks by groups aligned with Hamas on U.S. military bases and vessels, and Israel's invasion of Lebanon on 1 October 2024 after an escalation with Hezbollah.\nThe conflict has also spilled over into Syria, a country already devastated by its ongoing civil war and host to numerous proxy conflicts.\nIsraeli airstrikes on Syria\nThere have been numerous attacks claimed by or blamed on Israel since the start of the war in Gaza. In roughly the first year of the war, Israel struck Syria more than 220 times, killing 296 people. On 10 October 2023, Israel exchanged rocket and mortar fire with forces in southern Syria.\nFrom 12 to 22 October 2023, Israel launched at least three attacks on airports in Syria, including Damascus International Airport and Aleppo International Airport, ahead of a visit to Syria by Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. Two workers from the Syrian meteorology service based at Damascus International Airport were killed.\nOn 24 October 2023, Israeli airstrikes in Daraa Governorate reportedly resulted in the death of eight Syrian soldiers and injuries to seven others, as per Syria's state-run news agency SANA. The IDF acknowledged the airstrikes, stating they were a response to two rockets fired from Syria into Northern Israel.\nSince 2024, Israel has continued to launch airstrikes at targets in Syria, including in Damascus and Aleppo. On 20 January 2024, Brigadier General Sadegh Omidzadeh, an intelligence officer with the IRGC Quds Force in Syria, along with four other IRGC officers, were reportedly killed in an Israeli airstrike in Damascus. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an Israeli missile strike targeted a four-story building in the Mezzeh district. The attack resulted in the death of thirteen individuals, including five Iranians, and the complete destruction of the building where leaders aligned with Iran were having a meeting.\nIsraeli bombing of the Iranian embassy in Syria\nOn 1 April 2024, senior Quds Force commander of the IRGC, Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, was killed by a suspected Israeli airstrike that targeted the consulate annex building adjacent to the Iranian embassy in the Syrian capital Damascus. Between five and seven people were killed in the airstrike according to Iranian ambassador, Hossein Akbari. The strike caused \"massive destruction\" to the consulate building as well as damage to neighboring buildings, according to Syrian state media. Zahedi is the most senior IRGC officer who has been killed since the assassination of Qasem Soleimani by the U.S. in January 2020.\nOn 13 July 2024, one soldier was killed and three other people were injured in Israeli strikes in and around Damascus. On 27 September 2024, Israeli forces struck the Lebanon-Syria border, killing five Syrian soldiers. On 30 September, several people including a state television presenter were killed in an Israeli strike on Damascus. On 4 October, two Israeli soldiers were killed and 24 were wounded in a drone attack by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq on an Israeli base in the Golan Heights. However, the group denied responsibility for the attack. On 8 October an Israeli airstrike on Damascus killed 13 people. On 14 October, two Israeli tanks crossed into Syria, positioning themselves south of Quneitra. On 20 October, a guided missile attack on a car killed two people near the Golden Mazzeh hotel in Damascus. On 31 October, SANA reported that Israeli strikes hit a number of residential buildings in Al-Qusayr, damaging its industrial zone and killing 10 people, including civilians. Israeli Army Radio reported that the strikes targeted assets and headquarters of PIJ. PIJ confirmed the death of two of its leaders and a group of its cadres. The IDF said that it struck Hezbollah command centers and weapon depots. On 14 November, Israeli strikes on Damascus killed at least 15 people.\nOn 20 November 2024, Syrian state media reported that Israeli airstrikes targeted sites in the vicinity of Palmyra, in Homs Governorate. According to the Syrian Arab News Agency, the strikes hit \"residential buildings and the industrial zone\". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor, claimed the attacks killed four non-Syrian nationals, identified as members of Iranian-backed militias.\nAttacks on American bases\nAl-Tanf garrison\nOn 18 October 2023, a drone strike by an Iranian proxy on the al-Tanf garrison resulted in over 20 injuries. A minor strike followed on 1 November.\nAl-Omar field\nOn 4 February 2024, a drone struck a training ground in Al-Omar field in Deir ez-Zor, eastern Syria, which houses US troops, according to the Syrian Democratic Forces. Though no casualties were reported among US forces, at least seven Kurdish fighters were killed and 18 injured. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attack. The SDF condemned the attack, and said it had \"every right to respond\".\nOther attacks in Syria\nThe Islamic Resistance of Iraq has claimed responsibility for multiple drone strikes on US bases in eastern Syria, notably al-Omar oil field in Deir ez-Zor Governorate and al-Shaddadi in the Al-Hasakah Governorate on 24 October 2023, Tal Baidar base in November 2023, and Hemo base in northern Hasakah province on 10 January 2024. As a result of this attack, the US withdrew from the base, evacuating 350 US soldiers and relocating them to Tal Baidar base.\nIn the first major attack since early February, five rockets were fired from Zummar, Iraq towards the Kharab al-Jir base on 21 April 2024. No US personnel were injured. The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights blamed the attack on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. Iraqi authorities launched a search in Nineveh province, locating and burning the vehicle used in the attack.\nOn 9 August 2024, a kamikaze drone struck the US military base Rumalyn Landing Zone in eastern Syria, injuring eight US soldiers. On 13 August 2024, six rockets targeting an US airbase in Deir ez-Zor Governorate fell near the facility. As a response to the strike, US-led coalition launched artillery strikes.\nIranian attacks on Israel\nOn 1 October 2024, Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at targets in Israel, in at least two waves, the largest attack during the ongoing Iran–Israel conflict. Iran's codename for the attack was Operation True Promise II It was the second direct attack by Iran against Israel, the first being the April 2024 strikes.\nIran claimed that the attack was an act of \"self-defense\" in retaliation for Israel's assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and IRGC general Abbas Nilforoushan. The attacks, while more successful at saturating Israeli air defenses than in April, did not appear to cause extensive damage. Israel said it had shot down most of the missiles and there had been no harm to its Air Force's capabilities. The US Navy and Jordan also reported intercepting missiles. The two fatalities caused by the attacks were a Palestinian man killed directly by missile debris and an Israeli man indirectly. Four Palestinians, two Israelis and two Jordanians sustained minor injuries.\nThe area of the Nevatim Airbase in the Negev was hit by 20 to 32 missiles, which damaged a hangar and taxiway. Several other missiles hit the Tel Nof Airbase, a school in the nearby town of Gedera, and an area north of Tel Aviv around the headquarters of the Israeli intelligence services Mossad and Unit 8200, damaging homes and a restaurant. Israeli media were barred from publishing the exact locations of impacts. Analysts suggested that Israel had deprioritized protecting Nevatim since \"the cost of repairing a damaged hangar or runway is far lower than the cost of using an Arrow interceptor.\" Iran used the Fattah-1 and Kheibar Shekan.\nGround incursions into Syria\nFor the first time during the war, Israeli forces carried out a ground operation in Syria, capturing Ali Soleiman al-Assi, a Syrian citizen allegedly involved in Iranian operations targeting the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. According to the Israeli military, al-Assi had been under surveillance for months. The operation, which occurred in southern Syria near Saida, was announced on 3 November 2024, although the exact timing of the raid remains unclear. Israel released body camera footage showing the apprehension of the individual, who has since been brought to Israel for interrogation. This announcement marked a significant shift in Israel’s strategy in Syria.\nIsraeli ground operations also extended into Lebanon, with naval forces reportedly capturing a senior Hezbollah operative in a raid on a northern Lebanese town. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that these operations aim to curb Hezbollah’s armament through Iranian supply lines passing through Syria.\nDemilitarized buffer zone violations\nThe United Nations has reported that Israeli construction along the demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights has led to violations of the 1974 ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria. Satellite imagery and field observations indicate that new trenches and earth berms have been constructed along the Area of Separation , with some reportedly crossing into the zone. UNDOF, the UN force monitoring the region, confirmed multiple incursions by Israeli military vehicles into the Area of Separation.\nIsraeli officials stated that these defenses are intended to prevent infiltration by Iran-backed militias. However, Syrian authorities have strongly protested the construction activities, which they claim exacerbate tensions along the frontier. The UN has raised concerns with Israeli authorities multiple times regarding these violations.\nThe Israeli military has intensified activities along the demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights, known as the \"Alpha Line,\" in what it describes as defensive measures. Satellite imagery analyzed by the Associated Press in September 2024 revealed significant construction projects, including new trenches, paved roads, and barriers along more than 7.5 kilometers of the boundary. These actions have sparked criticism from the United Nations for violating the terms of the 1974 ceasefire agreement, which established the Area of Separation under UNDOF supervision.\nIsraeli officials have defended the construction, citing the need to counter potential infiltrations by Iran-backed militias operating in southern Syria.\nThe Israeli military has also emphasized its operational readiness along its \"seven active fronts\", with Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff Amir Baram personally inspecting the border defenses in November 2024. Baram toured the 210th Division, which oversees the Golan front, and highlighted the creation of a \"dynamic and advanced defensive zone\" to counter threats from Hezbollah and other Iran-aligned groups.\nResponse by the Syrian government\nDuring the Ba'athist regime\nDespite frequent Israeli airstrikes and ground operations targeting Iranian and Hezbollah-linked assets in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad’s government has largely avoided direct involvement in the broader Israel–Hezbollah conflict. This restraint highlights Damascus's focus on stabilizing its own territories following years of civil war and combating opposition forces that challenge its authority.\nMeanwhile, Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan has accused Syria of daily violations of the ceasefire agreement, including the presence of armed militias within the Area of Separation. In a formal complaint to the UN Secretary-General, Erdan stated that such actions \"only heighten tensions in an already volatile region.\"\nAfter the Ba'athist regime's fall\nImpact on 2024 rebel offensives\nHezbollah, which was a major ally of the Syrian government during the civil war, was severely weakened during its war with Israel. The deaths of Hassan Nasrallah and much of its military leadership, combined with the redeployment of Hezbollah fighters in Syria back to Lebanon, left a large power vacuum. Analysts attributed the significant pressure imposed on Syrian-ally Iran was a significant factor in the government's defeats, precipitated by Israel's attacks on it and its allies.\nIsraeli invasion of Syria\nDuring the decisive battle of Damascus and subsequent fall of the Assad regime on 7–8 December 2024, Israeli forces initiated military operations in Syria's Quneitra Governorate. Armored units advanced into the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force buffer zone in between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and targeting the central countryside of the Quneitra Governorate with artillery fire.\nSee also\n* Israel–Syria relations\n* United Nations Disengagement Observer Force\n* Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus\n* Iran–Israel conflict during the Syrian civil war\nReferences\nNotes"
