After a brief fight, the North Korean minelayer was sunk with a loss of all crew and no South Korean casualties were reported.\nAfter the minelayer's sinking, PC-703 discovered that the sunken vessel had laid a mine field at the mouth of the Haeju Man and then reported to base the location of the sea mines. Two days later on September 12, PC-703 encountered three small transports and sank them. The three supply vessels were most likely unarmed.\nSee also\n*List of border incidents involving North Korea\nReferences\n*Montross, Lynn.
