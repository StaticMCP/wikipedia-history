The label is currently home to music artists Dynamic Duo, Sole, Thama, Snzae and Huh, and to music producer Padi. The label's former artists include Supreme Team, Zion.T, Crush, Primary, Rhythm Power and Ha:tfelt.\nAmoeba Culture had the third largest sales among South Korean record labels in 2015.\nHistory\nAmoeba Culture was founded in August 2006 by Dynamic Duo members Gaeko and Choiza, as well as current CEO Go Kyung-min. The label held open auditions in late 2007 in order to expand its roster. In 2008, composer and producer Primary and hip hop duo Supreme Team joined the company.\nIn 2011 the label released a series of toy figurines and started the \"AMOEBAHOOD\" project to promote exhibits and other cultural art projects. They also established the Amoeba Culture recording studio in October 2011. In 2012 the label held the first \"Amoebahood Concerts\" at Daegu Exco and KBS Busan Hall in February, as well as the House of Blues in LA and the Showbox at the Market in Seattle in April with Kero One. Zion.T also announced that he had signed with the label that summer.\nIn 2013 all of the label's artist participated in the 'NOWeekend' project which culminated in an album. The group also held the \"2013 Amoebahood Concerts\" on March 16 and 17. On July 19, 2013, Supreme Team disbanded when member E-Sens's contract ended. That summer E-Sens released tracks alleging the company had offered him a slave contract and that they had stolen money which the label denied. In January 2014 the other former Supreme Team member, Simon D, left the label as well.\nIn November 2017, CJ E&M acquired Amoeba Culture. CJ E&M official stated that, \"We are investing to support the development of hip-hop music and free creative activities by artists\".\nOn July 7, 2023, it was announced that Go Kyungmin had died on July 6 at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital.\nControversies\nPlagiarism accusations against Primary\nFor the 2013 Infinity Challenge Music Festival, Primary collaborated with Park Myeong-su and label mate Gaeko (Dynamic Duo) for the song \"I Got C\". Later, netizens noticed similarities between \"I Got C\" and Dutch singer Caro Emerald's \"Liquid Lunch.\" Rumors of plagiarism later followed.\nIn an interview by Seoul Shinmun NTN's \"Dispatch,\" Caro Emerald's production team member David Schreurs said, \"[Primary] uses our music as a template to create his own, which is an honor but on some songs he’s just going too far with it. I would like to say he should start trusting his own talent, because he sure is a good producer.” As a result, Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), the network behind \"Infinity Challenge,\" as well as KT Music, the publisher of the album and songs from the \"2013 Infinity Challenge Music Festival,\" ceased online sales of \"I Got C.\"\nAnother Primary composition, Park Ji-yoon's Mr. Lee (featuring San E) was also later accused of plagiarism.\n2013: \"The Control Diss Phenomenon\"\n* July 19 – E-Sens (Supreme Team) left Amoeba Culture.\n* August 12 – American hip hop artist Big Sean released a promotional single called \"Control\", with a verse from Kendrick Lamar that called on all hip hop artists to \"step up and save hip hop\".\n* August 21 – Swings, the Korean American rapper affiliated with Illest Konfusion, UPT and Overclass, released the diss track \"King Swings\" through the YouTube channel of his agency at the time, Brand New Music.
