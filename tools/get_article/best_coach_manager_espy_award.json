      "text": "# Best Coach/Manager ESPY Award\n\nThe Best Coach/Manager ESPY Award has been presented annually since 1993 to the head coach or manager of a team contesting play in a professional North American or collegiate sports league adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year.\nBetween 1993 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.\nThrough the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in July and reflect performance from the June previous. The award wasn't awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Coach\n!Team\n!League or Competition\n!Sport\n|-\n|1994\n|Jimmy Johnson\n|Dallas Cowboys\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|1995\n|George Seifert\n|San Francisco 49ers\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|1996\n|Gary Barnett\n|Northwestern Wildcats football\n|NCAA Division I-A\n|American football\n|-\n|1997\n|Joe Torre\n|New York Yankees\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|1998\n|Jim Leyland\n|Florida Marlins\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|1999\n|Joe Torre (2)\n|New York Yankees\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2000\n|Joe Torre (3)\n|New York Yankees\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2001\n|Joe Torre (4)\n|New York Yankees\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|-\n|2002\n|Phil Jackson\n|Los Angeles Lakers\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2003\n|Jon Gruden\n|Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2004\n|Larry Brown\n|Detroit Pistons\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2005\n|Bill Belichick\n|New England Patriots\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2006\n|Bill Cowher\n|Pittsburgh Steelers\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2007\n|Tony Dungy\n|Indianapolis Colts\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2008\n|Pat Summitt\n|Tennessee Lady Vols basketball\n|NCAA Division I\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2009\n|Phil Jackson (2)\n|Los Angeles Lakers\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2010\n|Phil Jackson (3)\n|Los Angeles Lakers\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2011\n|Rick Carlisle\n|Dallas Mavericks\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2012\n|Tom Coughlin\n|New York Giants\n|National Football League\n|American football\n|-\n|2013\n|Rick Pitino\n|Louisville Cardinals men's basketball\n|NCAA Division I\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2014\n|Gregg Popovich\n|San Antonio Spurs\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2015\n|Steve Kerr\n|Golden State Warriors\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2016\n|Tyronn Lue\n|Cleveland Cavaliers\n|National Basketball Association\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2017\n|Bob Hurley\n|St. Anthony High School\n|High school basketball\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2018\n|Aaron Feis, Scott Beigel, Chris Hixon\n|Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\n|High school\n|Various\n|-\n|2019\n|Jim Calhoun\n|Saint Joseph\n|NCAA Division III\n|Basketball\n|-\n|2020\n| colspan=4 align=center|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n|2021\n|Tara VanDerveer\n|Stanford\n|NCAA Division I\n|Basketball\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Jack Adams Award\n*MLS Coach of the Year Award\n*Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award, The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award\n*National Basketball Association Coach of the Year Award\n*National Football League Coach of the Year Award\n*Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award, Henry Iba Award, Naismith College Coach of the Year Award (collegiate basketball)\n*Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award, Walter Camp Coach of the Year Award, Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award (collegiate football)\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
