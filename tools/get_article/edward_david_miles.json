He was the District Grand Master of the District Grand Lodge of North Queensland, the Grand Superintendent of the Royal Arch under the Scottish Constitution, and also Sovereign Grand Inspector-General for the Supreme Council of Scotland in Queensland, holding the position until ill-health forced his retirement. Holding the rank of 33rd degree, he had conferred upon him the title of Most Worshipful Past Grand Master.\nHe was also prominent in Friendly Societies, and held the role of Past Provincial Grand Master of the Charters Towers District of the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows. As early as 1876, Miles had been secretary of Star of the North Lodge, holding the position for many years.\nPersonal life\nMiles married Eliza Jane Herring in 1876 but did not have any children.
