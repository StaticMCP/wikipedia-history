It is an Aboriginal community. In the , the locality of Yarrabah had a population of 2,505 people.\nGeography\nThe town is about  by road from Cairns CBD on Cape Grafton. It is  by direct-line distance, but is geographically separated from Cairns CBD by the Murray Prior Range and Trinity Inlet, an inlet of the Coral Sea.\nHistory\nGunggay (also known as Gunggandji, Kongandji, Kongkandji, Gungganyji, Idindji and Yidiny) is an Aboriginal language of Far North Queensland. The Gunggay language region of Cape Grafton includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Cairns Regional Council and Yarrabah Council.\nAn Anglican church missionary, Ernest Gribble (1868–1957) in 1892 began to regularly visit an Aboriginal group who inhabited the Yarrabah area living a very traditional lifestyle. These visits by Gribble were to encourage the tribe to move to a mission settlement he was setting up. With the help of the tribe's leader, Menmuny, the tribe moved to the mission now known as Yarrabah Community. The mission was settled in 1893. Over time, many people (including some South Sea Islanders) were relocated from homelands in the surrounding area to Yarrabah.\nYarrabah State School was opened on 1 January 1892. In 2017, Yarrabah State School celebrated its 125th anniversary.\nIn 1957, the Yarrabah residents staged a strike to protest poor working conditions, inadequate food, health problems and harsh administration. The church expelled the ringleaders and many others left voluntarily, never to return. A few years later, the Government of Queensland assumed control of the mission.\nIn 1965, an advisory council was set up which allowed Aboriginal people to give \"advice\" to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but it had no actual power and the government continued to control all aspects of local people's lives. In 1979, several community members joined a union but were stood down.\nEventually, on 27 October 1986, the community received Deed of Grant in Trust land tenure, making it subject to the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984, which allowed for self-governing Aboriginal Community Councils with a range of powers and controls over the land. With the passage of reforms in 2005, the Council became an \"Aboriginal Shire\" and gained the authority of a legal local government.\nFollowing the 2001 Cape York Justice Study findings, Yarrabah became one of many indigenous communities in Queensland to be subject to an alcohol management plan.  Restrictions on alcohol possession commenced on 6 February 2004, with a review by 2006.  A 2012 survey for another review showed the community was divided on easing restrictions.\nIn 2002, the first Indigenous Knowledge Centres (IKCs) were developed in partnership with then Aboriginal Community and Island Councils across Queensland, with the State Library of Queensland.  The Indigenous Knowledge Centre opened in 2015. The $1.9 million facility was built both for and by the people of Yarrabah, offering learning opportunities even during its construction. Funding for the Centre was secured in 2012 by Treasurer and Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships Curtis Pitt, who officially opened the Yarrabah Knowledge Centre on 19 November. Leeanne Enoch, Minister for Science and Innovation, was also in attendance.\nOn 23 July 2007, Yarrabah hosted the Cabinet of the Queensland Government in the first ever Cabinet meeting to be held in an indigenous Australian community.\nOn 1 October 2007, the Howard Coalition Government chose Yarrabah as the first recipient of what was said to be a 'landmark housing and welfare reform agreement'.\nIn 2009 as part of the Local Government Reform Agenda in Queensland, the Council gained recognition as a local government council.\nDemographics\nThe population of community was given to be about 630 indigenous persons in 1952.\nIn the , the locality of Yarrabah recorded a population of 2,559 people, but some people may not have been counted due to language barriers and the transient nature of residence at the outstations. Of those recorded, 97.4% identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The median age of Yarrabah residents was 23, compared with 38 nationally. The majority of the Yarrabah workforce was engaged as either labourers or as community and personal service workers, and worked in local government administration or social assistance services. The median individual income was $224 per week compared with $534 per week for the Cairns statistical district. 84.8% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Kriol at 6.7%. The most common responses for religion were Anglican 84.6% and No Religion 7.4%.\nIn the , the locality of Yarrabah had a population of 2,505 people.\nThe town is home to a creole language known as Yarrabah Creole though it is still considered a dialect of English.\nEducation\nYarrabah State School is a government primary and secondary (Early Childhood-10) school for boys and girls.  It includes a special education program. In 2018, the school had an enrolment of 443 students with 46 teachers (44 full-time equivalent) and 41 non-teaching staff (29 full-time equivalent). In 2022, the school had 465 students with 43 teachers (41 full-time equivalent) and 54 non-teaching staff (39 full-time equivalent), of whom 29 staff (21 full-time equivalent) are Indigenous.The school operates from three sites:\n* the Early Childhood and Prep campus at Workshop Street ()\n* the primary school (Years 1-6) campus at Gribble Street ()\n* the secondary campus (Years 7-10) campus at Back Beach Road ()\nThe nearest government school for students continuing on to senior years (Year 11–12) is Gordonvale State High School in Gordonvale to the south-west.\nFacilities\nYarrabah's medical needs are serviced by a multi-disciplinary primary health care centre, which handles emergencies and general practice care, but does not have inpatient facilities. It is staffed 24&nbsp;hours a day by staff who mostly commute from Cairns.\nThere is a police station in the town.  Issues of concern include violence, alcohol/substance abuse, domestic violence, and high unemployment. Previously youth suicide was higher than surrounding areas.\nAmenities\nThe township has had a brass band since 1901 to the 1950s, until resurrected in 2013, making their debut at the inaugural Yarrabah Band Festival.  The festival itself is now held annually around October, drawing a crowd of about 4000 persons.\nYarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council operates an Indigenous Knowledge Centre (IKC) library service located at Lot 207 Noble Drive which opened in 2015. The $1.9 million facility was built both for and by the people of Yarrabah, offering learning opportunities even during its construction. Funding for the centre was secured in 2012 by Treasurer and Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships Curtis Pitt, who officially opened the Yarrabah Knowledge Centre on 19 November. Leeanne Enoch, Minister for Science and Innovation, was also in attendance. Yarrabah has a long history of providing a library service to the community. Before the establishment of IKCs, the then-Yarrabah Aboriginal Council operated a Country Lending Service (CLS) as far back as 1984. In 2003, the council asked the State Library of Queensland to transform the CLS into an IKC and lobbied for funds for a new building. The CLS was operational until it suffered irreparable damage during Cyclone Yasi in 2011.\nAttractions\nThe Yarrabah Menmuny Museum, opened in 1996, is in the Jilji suburb.  The museum's name comes from the local tribe leader of the late 1800s, Menmuny, who was given the title 'King John' Menmuny, and died circa 1919.  A later elder was 'King' Albert Maywee.\nEvents\nThe Yarrabah Band Festival is  held annually around October, drawing a crowd of about 4,000 people.\nGallery\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Trinity Forest Reserve road to Yarrabah.jpg|Driving towards Yarrabah township\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah-Pine Creek Yarrabah Road.jpg|Driving through Trinity Forest Reserve\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Trinity Forest Reserve track.jpg|Track to Mount Yarrabah\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Trinity Forest Reserve stream.jpg|Mountain creek\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Point Road to boat ramp.jpg|Looking towards the Point Road boat ramp\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah boat ramp towards old mission.jpg|Looking from the boat ramp towards the main township\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Point Road beach to old mission.jpg|Along the Point Road beach\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah main beach towards boat ramp.jpg|From the main beach towards the boat ramp\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Stanley Street.jpg|Residential area along Stanley Street\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Workshop Road.jpg|Residential area along Workshop Road\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Sawmill Road toilet block.jpg|Decorative art on toilet block\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah large cemetery.jpg|The larger of two town cemeteries\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah brumbies.jpg|Brumbies grazing on the roadside\nFile:AU-Qld-Yarrabah Wungu beach.jpg|Wungu beach area (Gunggandji country)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/dls06p/alma99183642819602061 Jabu Birriny (land + sea): contemporary stories by Yarrabah artists], State Library of Queensland\n* [https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/tqqf2h/alma99184104175202061 Brian Cassey Yarrabah community photographs], State Library of Queensland\n* [https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/blog/yarrabah-cls-ikc Yarrabah: CLS to IKC], State Library of Queensland blog"
