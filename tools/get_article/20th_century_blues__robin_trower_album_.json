When asked to create a cover for the album, Olsen presented transparencies of a batch of paintings, intending for the photos to be a starting point. However, Trower picked a specific one that he wanted. Afterwards, Olsen researched the original design, and discovered he had actually created the basic design in 1974, yet had not painted it until 1990. Ironically, it was originally an alternative he had done for the Long Misty Days cover, but had never shown to Trower because he preferred the autumn leaf design. Therefore, Trower had unknowingly selected a design that was meant for him almost twenty years earlier.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Robin Trower, except \"Reconsider Baby\".\nPersonnel\n*Robin Trower&nbsp;– guitar\n*Livingstone Brown&nbsp;– bass, vocals, keyboards\n*Mayuyu&nbsp;– drums\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.trowerpower.com/ TrowerPower.com]&nbsp;– Official website"
