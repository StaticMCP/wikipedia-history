Covering approximately , it is among Florida's most distinctively shaped lakes, often nicknamed the \"Silver Dollar Lake\" for its near-perfect roundness. The lake sits atop Florida's ancient Trail Ridge at approximately  above sea level, among the state's highest natural elevations.\nLocation data\nKingsley Lake is centered at .\nAdditional coordinate reference systems:\n* Decimal degrees: 29.96472°N, −81.99806°W\n* UTM: 17R 403703 3315295\n* MGRS: 17R MP 03703 15295\n* GARS: 197KZ11\n* GEOREF: GHJQ 057\nGeological formation\nKingsley Lake occupies a steep-sided sinkhole formed by the dissolution of underlying limestone bedrock, a process characteristic of Florida’s extensive karst topography. Limestone, composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), readily dissolves when exposed to slightly acidic rainwater and groundwater, creating depressions and caverns that can collapse into sinkholes. Kingsley Lake’s sandy bottom slopes gently along its perimeter before dropping sharply into a central basin reaching  deep.\nThe lake lies within a low point on the Trail Ridge, a Pleistocene-era coastal dune system that forms one of Florida’s oldest emergent landforms.\nHydrology\nKingsley Lake is classified as an Oligotrophic lake, characterized by very low nutrient concentrations, high water clarity, and minimal algal growth. The lake sits on a perched aquifer system within the sandy Trail Ridge formation, receiving recharge primarily from rainfall and shallow surficial aquifer seepage through its sandy bottom. No significant spring inflows exist. Outflows occur primarily through limited seepage into underlying aquifers and seasonal discharge into the North Fork Black Creek, which ultimately joins the St. Johns River.\nSeismic reflection studies by the USGS confirm that Kingsley Lake occupies a solution-collapse sinkhole within the Trail Ridge sands, with underlying limestone karst features. While some potential subsurface breaches exist, current hydrologic assessments indicate that the lake bottom remains largely sealed by sand, limiting any active connection with the deeper Floridan aquifer system.\nHydrologic monitoring data demonstrate Kingsley Lake’s unusual long-term stability, with only minor water-level fluctuations recorded from 1945 to 1995 (USGS site 02245700). The St. Johns River Water Management District continues periodic monitoring today.\n2024 water quality data include:\n* pH ≈ 5.9 (acidic)\n* Dissolved oxygen ≈ 8.5 mg/L\n* Secchi depth ≈ 7.2 ft\n* Turbidity ≈ 0.9 NTU\n* Trophic State Index: 35 (oligotrophic)\nEcology\nAquatic vegetation is sparse except near the shoreline. The deeper basin lacks vegetation due to light limitation, steep bathymetry, and low nutrients.\nWildlife includes:\n* Fish: Largemouth bass (noted for trophy-sized catches), Bluegill, Crappie, Catfish.\n* Reptiles and Birds: Alligators, turtles, ospreys, herons, egrets, kingfishers.\n* Upland species: Gopher tortoise, indigo snake, Red-cockaded woodpecker, Florida black bears.\nThe Kingsley Lake watershed includes designated critical habitat for the federally protected Black Creek crayfish (Procambarus pictus), which inhabits nearby tributaries and is highly sensitive to water quality degradation.\nHuman history\nThe Kingsley Lake basin has seen continuous human activity for centuries. The area was inhabited by Timucuan-speaking Native Americans prior to European contact.\nThe lake’s name likely derives from Zephaniah Kingsley, an English-born slave trader and planter active in early 19th-century Florida.\nFrom 1946 to 2002, Strickland’s Landing operated as a popular lakeside resort on the north shore, offering swimming beaches, water slides, boat rentals, bathhouses, and a snack bar. Initially charging only 25 cents for admission, Strickland’s Landing became a major recreational attraction for Clay County and Jacksonville residents until closing in 2002 due to rising insurance costs and declining attendance.\nRecreation and access\nPublic access is very limited. Roughly half the shoreline lies within Camp Blanding, a Florida National Guard installation; the remainder consists of private residential properties with ~180 private docks.\nThere are no public boat ramps or beaches. A small Clay County park (Kingsley Lake Park) offers a playground and basketball courts but no water access.\nMilitary lodging and recreation within Camp Blanding include:\n* [https://finnegan-lodge.edan.io/ Finnegan Lodge], a hotel-style facility with standard rooms and suites.\n* [https://campgrounds.rvlife.com/regions/florida/camp-blanding-joint-training-center/james-e-johnson-memorial-rv-park-12298 James E. Johnson Memorial RV Park], offering full hookup RV sites on-post.\n* Additional MWR-managed sites offering RV pads, cabins, primitive camping, boat launches, pavilions, and picnic areas.\nBecause of its restricted public access and protective management, Kingsley Lake remains one of Florida's few large natural lakes to avoid significant shoreline overdevelopment or nutrient impairment.\nMilitary significance\nSince 1939, Kingsley Lake has been integral to the development of Camp Blanding, which now occupies approximately  of uplands surrounding the lake. During World War II, Camp Blanding expanded to nearly  and trained approximately 800,000 soldiers as one of the Army's major infantry training centers.\nDuring World War II, Kingsley Lake hosted officer housing, hospital facilities, and parade grounds along its western shoreline.\nToday, Camp Blanding remains the primary training site for the Florida National Guard, hosting Army and Air National Guard units, U.S. Army Reserve, ROTC, and allied military training missions. Specialized schools include air assault, counterdrug operations, leadership development exercises, and joint interagency training.\nKingsley Lake continues to support limited water-based military training (e.g., small-craft handling, water survival) and serves as a recreational resource for authorized military personnel. Because much of the lakefront falls within secured military property, public access is restricted.\nResearch and monitoring\nKingsley Lake has been studied for its geology, hydrology, and ecology:\n* Geophysical surveys: High-resolution seismic profiling by the USGS.\n* Hydrology: Long-term water quality monitoring by USGS and Florida LAKEWATCH.\n* Fisheries research: Telemetry and population studies by FWC.\n* Water management: Designated high-quality water body under St. Johns River Water Management District basin classification.\nSee also\n* Camp Blanding\n* Procambarus pictus\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/ofr94616 USGS Open-File Report 94-616: High-resolution seismic reflection surveys of Kingsley Lake]\n* [https://exploreclay.com/blog/kingsley-lake-hidden-adventures/ Kingsley Lake – Explore Clay County Tourism]\n* [https://wateratlas.usf.edu/AtlasOfLakes/Florida/Lake.aspx?wbodyid=1001096 Kingsley Lake – Florida Atlas of Lakes]\n* [https://campblandingmuseum.org/history Camp Blanding Museum]"
