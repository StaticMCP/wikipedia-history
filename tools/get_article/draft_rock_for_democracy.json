Formed in , the group brings together singers and musicians to promote civic engagement and political activism through live music. The band blends genres such as classic rock, hip hop, punk, reggae, funk, and country in stage performances that emphasize themes of multiculturalism, diversity, and social justice.\nHistory\nRock For Democracy originated in Sacramento in early 2025 as a “musical messaging” project designed to reach audiences with performances that combined political activism with entertainment. The concept grew from the idea of using music as a catalyst for inspiring civic action and community participation.\nHowever, the phrase \"Rock for Democracy\" resonates with a long-standing tradition of musicians and bands using their platforms to promote democratic values and civic engagement. For instance, organizations like Rock the Vote have been instrumental in encouraging voter participation among young people through music and media partnerships. This connection situates Rock For Democracy in a lineage of politically active musical efforts, comparable in spirit to Rock Against Racism in the 1970s and large-scale benefit concerts such as Live Aid in 1985.\nThe group debuted on April 5, 2025, with a performance at the California State Capitol in Sacramento. They soon became a fixture at local rallies and protest events, performing for organizations such as Indivisible, Hands Off, and 50501. On April 19, 2025, during a rally at Southside Park, Texas Congressman Al Green made a surprise appearance, which drew significant attention from attendees. Rock For Democracy performed again at the California State Capitol for the “No Kings” rally on June 14, 2025, which the band later described as a defining and inspirational moment in their early history.\nThe ensemble has frequently performed on the “Big Red Stage Truck,” a mobile stage and sound system built by a Sacramento community member to support public gatherings. The stage has been used for both Rock For Democracy’s concerts and other political resistance events in the city.\nStyle and vision\nRock For Democracy describes its mission as combining music with activism, seeking to make rallies “informative yet entertaining” in order to motivate attendees to engage in political action. Performances typically feature a wide range of genres in a single setlist, from classic rock covers to hip hop collaborations, in what the group characterizes as a versatile stage show.\nThe group also emphasizes inclusivity and representation. Among its collaborators is singer-songwriter and guitarist Kelly Rogers, whose performances have added another dimension to Rock For Democracy’s sound and increased LGBTQ visibility. The collective has also featured local hip hop artists including Calogeno and VQ.\nMembers\nThe core lineup of Rock For Democracy consists of four permanent members:\n* Pauli Infantino – vocals, harmonica\n* James Yokoi – bass guitar, vocals\n* Chris Tracy – drums\n* John \"Gumby\" Goodwin – guitar, vocals\nCollaborators and guest performers have included:\n* Kelly Rogers – vocals, guitar\n* Calogeno – hip hop artist\n* VQ – hip hop artist\nDiscography\nAs of , Rock For Democracy has not yet released a studio album. The collective primarily performs live at rallies, community events, and fundraising concerts.\nSee also\n* Music and politics\n* Protest songs\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
