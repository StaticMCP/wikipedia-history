It is named in honor of American evolutionary biologist David Hillis. It is unlikely that any previous studies had analyzed populations of this species.\nDistribution\nIt is found throughout the southern half of Alabama outside of the Mobile Bay region, and ranges east into mid-central Georgia and south to the central Florida Panhandle.\nReferences"
