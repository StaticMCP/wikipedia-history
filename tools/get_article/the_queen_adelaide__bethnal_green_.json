Its current incarnation as an LGBTQ+ venue began in 2015 when the George and Dragon gay pub in Shoreditch closed, and the owners moved many of its furnishings to the Queen Adelaide venue on Hackney Road.\nThe pub's name changed to The Hop Picker by 1983, and was later Tantrums, Images, and Keelys before being renamed The Queen Adelaide.\nIn 2019 GQ Magazine described the venue as “the last survivor of a long dynasty of London gay bars”.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
