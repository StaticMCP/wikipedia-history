Directed by Worawit Khuttiyayothin and Thanawat Panyarin, the romantic fantasy series was released on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10 July to 8 August 2024, on Channel One 31, and globally on major OTT platforms such as Netflix and GagaOOLala.\nSynopsis\nSan, a Chinese immigrant, fell in love with Khun Wat, the daughter of a Thai aristocrat. Their romance began when she helped him recover after he was severely injured, healing him with the \"five-colored stone\" at a temple dedicated to a goddess. Tragically, as star-crossed lovers, Khun Wat died. San attempted to use the mystical stone's power to save her, but it was in vain. The only way for them to be together again was for San to enter a century-long contract of immortality with the temple goddess, agreeing to wait for Khun Wat to be reborn. The catch was that he would be tormented every night; if he failed to reunite with her, he would also face a tragic death for eternity. After patiently waiting for 100 years, San met Vee, who is believed to be Khun Wat's reincarnation. However, Vee is also a man.\nCast and characters\nMain\n* Pittaya Saechua as San\n* Kantapon Jindataweephol as Vee\nSupporting\n*  as Khun Wat/Watfah\n* Ponlawit Ketprapakorn as Mom Chao Trai/Third\n* Koravich Sarasin as Tao\n* Pornsroung Rouyruen as Ju\n*  as Chong\n* Trungta Kositchaimongkol as Rat\n* Natpongpon Suddee as Suchat\n*  as Grandma Jam\n* Parattakorn Kaiyanan as Ton\n* Penpetch Benyakul as Mr. Chen\nEpisodes\n| ShortSummary        = Even though San doesn't believe that Vee is the person he's been searching for, several signs begin to make his heart waver.\n| LineColor           = 654321\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = San takes Vee back to a place filled with past meanings, and he sees another side of Vee that others don't know.\n| LineColor           = 654321\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = San is forced to propose to Vee, and Vee learns who San really is.\n| LineColor           = 654321\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Vee moves into San's house, as he begins to search for the five-color stone.\n| LineColor           = 654321\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = With Vee's life in peril, San confronts the enigmatic foe behind their troubles and soon finds himself in a rivalry with a familiar face from his past.\n| LineColor           = 654321\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = San and Vee begin to develop a stable relationship, but strange visions gradually appear to San.\n| LineColor           = 654321\n}}\n| ShortSummary        =  San questions his spiritual connection to Vee after meeting a woman who resembles a figure from his past.
