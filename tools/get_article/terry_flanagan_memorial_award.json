Flanagan has another award named in his honor that is given out by the American Hockey Coaches Association to a coach for his career body of work. The first recipient of that award was Terry Flanagan himself in 1997.\nThe Terry Flanagan Memorial Award was first awarded in 1993 and every year thereafter until 2013 when the CCHA was dissolved as a consequence of the Big Ten forming its men's ice hockey conference.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School\n|-\n| 1992–93 || Wes McCauley|| Defenceman || Michigan State\n|-\n| 1993–94 || Craig Lisko || Goaltender || Ferris State\n|-\n| 1994–95 || Chuck Thuss || Goaltender || Miami\n|-\n| 1995–96 || Jon Gaskins || Defenceman || Michigan State\n|-\n| 1996–97 || Steve Noble || Center || Notre Dame\n|-\n| 1997–98 || Bryan Adams || Left wing || Michigan State\n|-\n| 1998–99 || Ernie Hartlieb || Left wing || Miami\n|-\n| 1999–00 || Sean Peach || Defenceman || Michigan\n|-\n| 2000–01 || Doug Schueller || Defenceman || Bowling Green\n|-\n| 2001–02 || Scott Titus || Defenceman || Ohio State\n|-\n| 2002–03 || Brian Maloney || Left wing || Michigan State\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Year !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winner !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School\n|-\n| 2003–04 || Aaron Voros || Right wing || Alaska-Fairbanks\n|-\n| 2004–05 || Jordan Sigalet || Goaltender || Bowling Green\n|-\n| 2005–06 || Steve McJannet || Center || Lake Superior State\n|-\n| 2006–07 || Tom Fritsche || Left wing || Ohio State\n|-\n| 2007–08 || Dan VeNard || Defenceman || Notre Dame\n|-\n| 2008–09 || Erik Condra || Right wing || Notre Dame\n|-\n| 2009–10 || Aaron Lewicki || Left wing || Ferris State\n|-\n| 2010–11 || Kevin Petovello || Left wing || Alaska\n|-\n| 2011–12 || Domenic Monardo || Forward || Lake Superior State\n|-\n| 2012–13 || Joe Rogers || Goaltender || Notre Dame\n|}\nWinners by school\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| School !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n|Michigan State || 4\n|-\n|Notre Dame || 4\n|-\n|Alaska || 2\n|-\n|Bowling Green || 2\n|-\n|Ferris State || 2\n|-\n|Lake Superior State || 2\n|-\n|Miami || 2\n|-\n|Ohio State || 2\n|-\n|Michigan || 1\n|}\nWinners by position\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Position !! style=\"background:#e5e5e5;\"| Winners\n|-\n| Center || 2\n|-\n| Right wing || 2\n|-\n| Left wing || 6\n|-\n| Forward || 1\n|-\n| Defenceman || 6\n|-\n| Goaltender || 4\n|}\nSee also\n*CCHA Awards\n*Terry Flanagan Award\nReferences\nGeneral\n*\n*\nSpecific"
