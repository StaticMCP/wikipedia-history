Organized chronologically by Tech Level, the book avoids becoming a dry inventory by interspersing chapters with contextual insights into weapon development and usage. The introduction focuses on Imperial procurement, and the book quickly shifts into offering optional rules for weapon malfunctions, environmental effects, and special combat mechanics. It details everything from grenades and smart guns to advanced powered armor known as Battle Dress, which evolves into remote-controlled \"Battle Pods.\"\nReception\nJim Swallow reviewed Emperor's Arsenal for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall, and stated that \"Equipment lists are never very interesting, but this is at least well-put together, and in some cases actually quite thought-provoking.\"\nReviews\n*Shadis (Issue 37 - Jun 1997)\n*AAB Proceedings'' (Issue 36)\nReferences"
