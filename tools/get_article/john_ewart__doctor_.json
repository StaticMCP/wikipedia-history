He studied surgery under Joseph Lister the British surgeon who developed antiseptic surgery. Ewart worked in hospitals in England and Wales before emigrating in search of a better climate to New Zealand in 1887 on the ship Waimate.\nFrom 1887 to 1889 he was surgeon at Timaru Hospital and was then appointed medical superintendent of Wellington Hospital. He held this post for 20 years though he remained honorary surgeon to the hospital from 1909 when he took up a private practice. He oversaw the expansion of the hospital and was known as an able administrator who also improved the standards of aseptic treatment and expanded training for nurses. The tuberculosis hospital, which opened in 1930 (later Ewart Hospital) was named after him.\nEwart retired in 1922, and died in Wellington on 5 August 1939.\nFamily\nEwart's family emigrated from Scotland before him in 1885. Two of his brothers were doctors: David Ewart of Chichester, England and William Ewart of Wellington. He had four sisters one of whom, Jessie Ewart, was matron of Invercargill Hospital.\nIn 1889 Ewart married Grace Brandon and they had two daughters and one son, Ian Ewart, who was also a doctor.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Obituary New Zealand Medical Journal 1939; 38: 425-26.\nExternal links\n* [https://natlib.govt.nz/records/23049841 Photo of John Ewart (1909) in Alexander Turnbull Library]"
