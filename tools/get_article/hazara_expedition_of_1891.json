General Roberts observed that  the Black Mountain tribes, [having been] quite unsubdued by the fruitless expedition of 1888, had given trouble almost immediately afterwards. [The second expedition] was completely successful in political results as in its military conduct. The columns were not withdrawn until the tribesmen had become convinced that they were powerless to sustain a hostile attitude towards us, and that it was in their interest, as it was our wish, that they should henceforth be on amicable terms with us.\nBritish and Indian Army forces who took part in this expedition received the India General Service Medal with the clasp of Hazara 1891 (as had been done similarly in the 1888 expedition). The Royal Welch Fusiliers were one of the British regiments that took part in the expedition.\nAllan James Macnab was one of the soldiers who was awarded the clasp of Hazara for his role in the night attack on Ghazikot.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.britishbattles.com/north-west-frontier-of-india/black-mountain-expedition-1891/ Black Mountain Expedition 1891]\n* [https://collection.nam.ac.uk/detail.php?acc=1961-12-147-3 India General Service Medal 1854-95, with clasp, 'Hazara 1891', awarded to Havildar Biaz, Queen's Own Corps of Guides, Punjab Frontier Force]\nReferences"
