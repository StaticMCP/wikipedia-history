A Royalist force led by Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, under command of Glencairn, repulsed an attack by the numerically superior Commonwealth forces of Robert Lilburne.\nPrelude\nAfter the English Commonwealth defeated King Charles II of England and his Scottish allies at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, the Parliament of England moved to bring Scotland into the Commonwealth. In Scotland, there was significant resistance to being governed by the Commonwealth, particularly in the Highlands where there remained considerable support for the exiled King.\nIn early 1653, King Charles made William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn the temporary commander of Royalist forces in Scotland until Major-General John Middleton could arrive from the Dutch Republic. As the commander of the Scottish Royalists, Glencairn worked to build support among clan leaders in the Scottish Highlands and organized a guerrilla campaign against the Commonwealth.\nBattle\nSupporting Glencairn in the campaign against the Commonwealth was Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, the Scottish Highland chief of the Clan Cameron. At that time, Glencairn was in the Eastern Highlands campaigning against Commonwealth occupational troops. Ewen and his clansmen were encamped at Tullich protecting Glencairn’s army against a surprise attack by Commonwealth forces.\nDuring this time, a Commonwealth army commanded by General Robert Lilburne was in pursuit of Glencairn and found their way to Tullich. When the Commonwealth troops approached, Ewen sent a warning to Glencairn and prepared to defend the pass. The fighting started shortly thereafter and the Cameron clansmen stopped the Commonwealth advance, fending off several attacks. As the battle continued, Lilburne's troops also attempted to flank the Royalists but failed.\nAfter many hours of fighting and having inflicted heavy losses on the Commonwealth troops, Ewen was ordered to retreat, leaving the pass open. The Commonwealth army, however, were depleted and unable to continue their offensive in the harsh terrain. As the Commonwealth troops fell back and attempted to return to Inverness, the Royalists went on the offensive, taking advantage of the situation to pursue and harass them for several miles.\nAftermath\nEwen returned in triumph to report back to Glencairn and was hailed as \"The Deliverer of the Highland Army.\" Later, Ewen received a letter of praise for his courage in battle from Charles II. Ian Mitchell's book On the Trail of Queen Victoria in the Highland is dedicated \"to the Unknown Soldiers of Cromwell's Republic who fell in the Battle of Tullich near Ballater in 1654, overcoming bands of Royalist bandits under Locheil.
