Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Yemen ratified the convention on 7 October 1980.\n, Yemen has five sites on the list. The first site, the Old Walled City of Shibam, was designated in 1982. The most recent site listed was Landmarks of the Ancient Kingdom of Saba in Marib in 2023. The Socotra Archipelago was listed in 2008, and it is the only natural site in Yemen, while the other four are cultural. All four cultural sites are listed as endangered. The Historic Town of Zabid was listed in 2000 because of the deteriorating state of the historic buildings. Shibam and the Old City of Sana'a were listed in 2015 and Marib in 2023 due to Yemeni Civil War threats. Yemen has nine sites on its tentative list. The country served as a member of the World Heritage Committee in the years 1985–1991.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (governorate)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color: #FFE6BD\"| Old Walled City of Shibam\n|\n| Hadhramaut\n| 1982\n| 192; iii, iv, v (cultural)\n| The 16th-century walled city of Shibam is located on the edge of a giant flood wadi between the mountains on an important caravan trade route. The city has several multi-storey mudbrick houses, representing one of the oldest examples of high-rise urban planning. It is also a prominent example of the traditional architecture of the Hadharem between the 16th and 19th centuries. Floods pose a risk to the city as traditional water management systems have been gradually abandoned. Furthermore, installing a modern water supply with inadequate drainage and changes in livestock management have contributed to the deteriorating city condition. The site has been listed as endangered since 2015 due to the threats posed by the Yemeni Civil War.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color: #FFE6BD\"| Old City of Sana'a\n|\n| Sanaa\n| 1986\n| 385; iv, v, vi (cultural)\n| The city of Sana'a has been inhabited for more than 2500 years. It played a crucial role in Islam's early years, with the Great Mosque being the first mosque constructed outside Mecca and Medina. The city is one of the original centres from which the faith spread. The walled city comprises many traditional multi-storey houses built of rammed earth and burned brick, decorated by patterns made in brick and white gypsum.

It was an important centre of learning during the early Islamic period from the 7th century on, with a large number of mosques and madrasas. The architecture, in particular the Tihamah-style courtyard house, is typical for the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. The historic character of the town is threatened by new concrete and steel constructions and overhead electrical cables. The site has been listed as endangered since 2000 because of the deteriorating state of the historic buildings.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Socotra Archipelago\n|\n| Socotra\n| 2008\n| 1263; x (natural)\n| The Socotra Archipelago comprises four islands and two rocky islets. Both land and marine area are exceptionally rich in biodiversity. The islands are home to many endemic plant species (Dracaena cinnabari pictured), as well as endemic reptile and land snail species.

They include the Barran Temple, the Awam Temple (pictured), the ancient city of Marib, Old Marib Dam, and the ancient city of  Sirwah.

Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Yemen has listed 35 properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (governorate)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The Historic City of Thula\n|\n|'Amran\n| 2002\n| i, iii, iv (cultural)\n| The city of Thula dates to the Himyarite Kingdom period.
