By August 26, 1881, he was serving as a seaman on the tugboat . On that day, while Leyden was near Boston, Massachusetts, Landsman Michael Drennan jumped overboard because he was \"temporarily insane\". Thornton jumped in after him and kept him afloat until they could be rescued. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor three years later, on October 18, 1884.\nThornton's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\nFor jumping overboard from the U.S. Tug Leyden, near Boston, Mass., 26 August 1881, and sustaining until picked up, Michael Drennan, landsman, who had jumped overboard while temporarily insane.\nSee also\n*List of Medal of Honor recipients during peacetime\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
