All of the Native Alaskan dialects have been found to be influenced by Russian language. Especially as a result of the Russian fur traders as well as the Russian Orthodox.

Relying heavily on trading and sharing between families for survival, especially to prevent food from spoiling. Pre-contact with the Russian fur traders, the natural world and spiritual were seen as one, including people, animals, places, oceans, and more.
