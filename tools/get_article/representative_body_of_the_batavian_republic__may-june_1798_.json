It was a continuation of the Constituent Assembly of the Batavian Republic after the adoption of the new constitution, the Staatsregeling 1798. The term ended after the coup d'état of 12 June 1798 and was replaced by the Intermediary Legislative Body, which prepared the 1798 election for a new Representative Body.\nMembers\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=width:16em | Name\n!
