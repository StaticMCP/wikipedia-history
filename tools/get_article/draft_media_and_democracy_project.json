MAD, a 501(c)(4) organization based in New York City, was founded in 2020. MAD describes itself as nonpartisan. The Capital Research Center describes MAD as left-of-center. MAD is entirely run by volunteers.\nFCC petition\nIn July, 2023, MAD petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deny the broadcast license renewal application of FOX affiliate WTXF-TV in Philadelphia. The petition argued that the owners of WTXF failed to meet the minimum standards of character and the obligation to operate in the public interest required by the Communications Act of 1934, to an extent \"so egregious as to shock the conscience.\" The petition cited as evidence the judicial record of the Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit against Fox News, which found that WTXF knowingly and repeatedly aired false narratives about the 2020 presidential election. Comments supporting the petition were filed by founding president of Fox Broadcasting Jamie Kellner; former Fox executive Preston Padden; former FCC chair Alfred Sikes, a Republican; and former FCC commissioner Ervin Duggan, a Democrat. Fox characterized the petition as a frivolous assault on its First Amendment rights. The FCC took the unusual step of requesting comments on the license renewal, but eventually denied MAD's petition in January, 2025. MAD has appealed the denial.\nFCC Chair Brendan Carr has referred to MAD's suit as precedent for an investigation into CBS regarding a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\nOther activities\nMAD believes that American democracy is under attack and that the media undermines democracy by misinforming voters and understating the threats to democracy.\nIn 2022, MAD joined news organizations in a demand that the Pulitzer Prizes \"require transparency in diversity reporting in order for news organizations to be eligible to receive awards.\"\nIn 2024, MAD advocated for The PRESS Act, a journalistic freedom bill supported by the Society of Professional Journalists. During the 2024 U.S. election campaign, MAD issued guidelines for pro-democracy reporting practices.\nAlso in 2024, MAD joined GLAAD in demanding changes in how the New York Times covers transgender people, and called on the Times to hire a public editor, a position the Times had previously eliminated. The public editor is an ombudsperson who helps the newspaper uphold high ethical standards.\nIn May 2025, MAD cofounder Jonathan Reiss suggested news organizations stop using the word \"conservative\" to describe the Trump administration's policies: \"If fascist is a bridge too far, autocratic, corrupt and dictatorial would all be more appropriate terms than 'conservative.'\"\nMAD makes available to the public a list of over 2,000 community-focused local news outlets across the U.S.\nReferences\nExternal Links\n* [https://www.mediaanddemocracyproject.org/ website of The Media and Democracy Project]\n* [https://www.mediaanddemocracyproject.org/journalism-directory The Media and Democracy Project's local journalism directory]\n* [https://thedemlabs.org/2024/03/29/media-and-democracy-project-local-journalist-map/ MAD's local journalism directory shown as a map]"
