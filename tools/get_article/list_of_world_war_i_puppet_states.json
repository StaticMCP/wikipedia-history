Some of these countries were subsequently given new names and new government leaders loyal to the conquering country. These countries are known as puppet states. Germany and the Ottoman Empire were the two countries with puppet states. The Allies had many more puppet states than all the Central Powers collectively: the United Kingdom had the largest empire in the world.\nIn addition, several countries captured land in the years leading up to the war, which then became puppet states; those states which are immediately relevant to the war are also included here.\nCentral Powers\nGerman Empire\nThe German Empire had a number of puppet states during World War I. All the states were previously under Russian control and had long been of interest to the regime.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=8.5%|Created!!Disestablished\n!width=15%|Puppet State\n!Flag\n!Country/territory!!Notes\n|-\n|-\n|6 December, 1917\n|17 July, 1919\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|Finland\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\n|\n|Poland\n|The Central Powers' forces occupied Russian Congress Poland in 1915 and in 1916 the German Empire and Austria-Hungary created a Polish Monarchy in order to exploit the occupied territories in an easier way and mobilize the Poles against the Russians (see Polish Legions).
