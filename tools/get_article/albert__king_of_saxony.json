His first experience of warfare came in 1849, when he served as a captain in the First War of Schleswig against Denmark.\nWhen the Austro-Prussian War broke out in 1866, Albert, then Crown Prince (German: Kronprinz), took up the command of the Saxon forces opposing the Prussian Army of Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia. No attempt was made to defend Saxony, and the Saxons fell back into Bohemia and effected a junction with the Austrians. They took a prominent part in the battles by which the Prussians forced the line of the Jizera and in the Battle of Jičín. The Crown Prince, however, succeeded in effecting the retreat in good order, and in the decisive Battle of Königgrätz (3 July 1866), he held the extreme left of the Austrian position. The Saxons maintained their post with great tenacity but were involved in the disastrous defeat of their allies.\nDuring the operations, the Crown Prince won the reputation of a thorough soldier. After peace was made and Saxony had entered the North German Confederation, he gained the command of the Saxon army, which had now become the XII army corps of the North German army, and in that position, he carried out the necessary reorganisation. He proved a firm adherent of the Prussian alliance. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, he again commanded the Saxons, who were included in the 2nd army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, his old opponent. At the Battle of Gravelotte, they formed the extreme left of the German army, and with the Prussian Guard carried out the attack on St Privat, the final and decisive action in the battle.\nIn the reorganisation of the army which accompanied the march towards Paris, the Crown Prince gained a separate command over the 4th army (Army of the Meuse) consisting of the Saxons, the Prussian Guard corps, and the IV (Prussian Saxony) corps. He was succeeded in command of the XII corps by his brother Prince George, who had served under him in Bohemia.\nAlbert took a leading part in the operations which preceded the battle of Sedan, the 4th army being the pivot on which the whole army wheeled round in pursuit of MacMahon; and the actions of Buzancy and Beaumont on 29 and 30 August 1870 were fought under his direction. In the Battle of Sedan itself (1 September 1870), with the troops under his orders, Albert carried out the envelopment of the French on the east and the north.\nAlbert's conduct in the engagements won for him the complete confidence of the army, and during the Siege of Paris, his troops formed the north-east section of the investing force. During the siege, he blocked French attempts to break out of the encirclement at Le Bourget and Villiers. After the conclusion of the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871), he was left in command of the German army of occupation, a position which he held till the fall of the Paris Commune. On the conclusion of peace, he was made an inspector-general of the army and a field marshal.\nKing\nPortrait of Albert by Alfred Diethe, 1878\nOn the death of his father, King John on 29 October 1873, the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne as King Albert. His reign proved uneventful, and he took little public part in politics, devoting himself to military affairs, in which his advice and experience were of the greatest value, not only to the Saxon corps but also to the German army in general.  During his reign, the Saxon monarchy became constitutional.\nIn the 1870s, Albert initiated the construction of a Dresden suburb, the Albertstadt. It was then the largest garrison in Germany. Near the former suburb other buildings and places still bear his name: the Albertbrücke, the Alberthafen, the Albertplatz and the Albertinum.\nIn 1879, he initiated the reconstruction of the Saint Afra School in Meissen. In 1897, he was appointed arbitrator between the claimants for the Principality of Lippe.\nMarriage and succession\nIn Dresden on 18 June 1853, Albert married Princess Carola, daughter of Gustav, Prince of Vasa and granddaughter of Gustav IV Adolf, the second to last king of Sweden of the House of Holstein-Gottorp. The marriage was childless although Carola miscarried many times. They included:\n* A miscarriage of a daughter in the 4th month of pregnancy (19 December 1853).\n* A miscarriage of a daughter in the 6th month of pregnancy (16 August 1854).\n* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (22 January 1855).\n* A miscarriage of a son in the 4th and a half month of pregnancy (17 January 1856).\n* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (4 December 1856).\n* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (30 January 1857).\n* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (30 March 1857).\n* A miscarriage of a son in the 5th and a half month of pregnancy (11 January 1858).\n* A miscarriage of a son in the 4th and a half month of pregnancy (20 March 1859).\n* A miscarriage in the 1st month of pregnancy (30 March 1860).\nAlbert died at his Sibyllenort Palace on 19 June 1902 and was succeeded by his brother, who became King George. He was buried in Dresden on 23 June, among the mourners present were both the German Emperor Wilhelm II and the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I.\nHonours, decorations and awards\nThe King of Saxony bird-of-paradise was named in Albert's honour; the Queen Carola's parotia was named for his wife.\nGerman honours\n:\n** Knight of the Rue Crown, 1831\n** Knight of the Military Order of St. Henry, 22 April 1849; Grand Cross, 16 July 1866\n** Grand Cross of the Albert Order\n*  Prussia:\n** Knight of the Black Eagle, with Collar, 21 September 1844; with Collar, 1861\n** Pour le Mérite (military), 21 June 1849; with Oak Leaves, 6 December 1870; with Crown, 15 July 1899\n** Iron Cross, 1st and 2nd Classes; Grand Cross, 22 March 1871\n** Grand Commander's Cross of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern, 6 September 1876\n*    Ernestine duchies: Grand Cross of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order, June 1846\n* : Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order, 1849\n* : Grand Cross of the White Falcon, 1 February 1850\n* :\n** Knight of St. Hubert, 1850\n** Grand Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph, 14 April 1871\n** Grand Cross of the Military Merit Order, with Swords\n*  Hesse and by Rhine:\n** Grand Cross of the Ludwig Order, 9 June 1851\n** Military Merit Cross, 9 July 1871\n* :\n** Knight of the House Order of Fidelity, 1853\n** Grand Cross of the Zähringer Lion, 1853\n** Grand Cross of the Military Karl-Friedrich Merit Order, 1871\n*  Hesse-Kassel: Knight of the Golden Lion, 6 October 1854\n* : Knight of the Gold Lion of Nassau, November 1858\n* :\n** Grand Cross of the Württemberg Crown, 1864\n** Grand Cross of the Military Merit Order, 30 November 1870\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of Duke Peter Friedrich Ludwig, with Golden Crown and Swords, 18 January 1871\n*  Anhalt: Grand Cross of Albert the Bear, 1879\n}}\nForeign honours\n:\n** Grand Cross of St. Stephen, 1849\n** Knight of the Golden Fleece, 1850\n** Knight of the Military Order of Maria Theresa, 1866\n*  Kingdom of Sardinia:\n** Knight of the Annunciation, 11 April 1850\n** Grand Cross of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, 1850\n* :\n** Knight of St. Andrew, 20 July 1851\n** Knight of St. Alexander Nevsky, 20 July 1851\n** Knight of St. George, 2nd Class, September 1870 – for his defeat of McMahon at the Battle of Beaumont on 30 August\n* : Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold, 25 May 1853\n* : Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III, 4 March 1856; with Collar, 8 October 1883\n*  French Empire: Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, August 1867\n*   Sweden-Norway:\n** Knight of the Seraphim, 2 June 1875\n** Grand Cross of St. Olav, 19 July 1888\n* : Knight of the Elephant, 14 June 1878\n* : Grand Cross of the Military William Order, 9 July 1878\n* : Stranger Knight Companion of the Garter, 20 February 1882\n* : Grand Cordon of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, 27 November 1882\n*  Siam: Knight of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri, 24 August 1897\n}}\nAncestry\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Konrad Sturmhoefel: König Albert von Sachsen.
