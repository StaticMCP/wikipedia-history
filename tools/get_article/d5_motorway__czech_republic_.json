It runs from Prague through Plzeň into Germany. D5 is  long; a bypass of Plzeň includes the  Valík Tunnel and the  bridge over the River Úhlava.\nFrom the Rozvadov-Waidhaus border crossing, the D5 continues as the A6, West, to the border with France. The D5 is part of European route E50. All of D5 is the Czech part of Via Carolina; the motorway from Nuremberg to Prague.\nChronology\nConstruction of the D5 began in 1976, with the first 5.8 km long segment opening in 1982. In 1985, another part, to Beroun was opened. The  of the planned  was already in use in 1989 from Prague to Bavoryně.\nThe bypass Plzeň, in planning since 1988, faced various challenges. In 1991, the bypass' northern variant was changed to the southern variant that was supposed to use deep notch through the hill of Valík. This started court proceedings that lasted until November 2001, and the construction of the bypass including the tunnel under the hill Valík began after the disputes concluded. The last remaining  long section around Plzeň, including the Valík tunnel opened on 6 October 2006, and is controlled by a Reliance SCADA system.\nThis was the last part of the motorway to be constructed as the rest from Plzeň to the Rozvadov-Waidhaus border crossing was already in use since 1997. The final part was opened on 6 October 2006.\nFuture developments\nThe section between Prague and Beroun is planned to be widened to three lanes in each direction.\nGallery\nBeroun, dálniční most II.JPG|Bridge over Beroun\nRozvadov, dálnice D5, k hranicím.jpg|Near borders with Germany\nRudná, dálnice D5 (16).jpg|Near Rudná\nExit list\n|notes=Kilometrage starting point\n----\nStart of the electronic toll section\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Kilometrage end point\n----\nRoad continues as the German A6\n}}\nReferences\nContent in this edit is translated from the existing Czech Wikipedia article at :cs:Dálnice D5; see its history for attribution.\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20130630184829/http://www.rsd.cz/doc/Information-service/tunnel-valik-the-key-to-the-bypass-of-plzen Official information about the D5 / Valík at ŘSD]\n*[http://www.rsd.cz/rsd/rsd.nsf/38fd1ebb511a4facc1256c22002f8f54/bf0c63edfb277e64c125733f00354a64?OpenDocument&Highlight=0,D5* Opening of the D5 motorway literally saved the traffic in Plzeň]"
