He was the Federal Minister of Food, Agriculture and Forestry from 1959 to 1965.\nLife\nWerner Schwarz was born in 1900 as the son of a merchant in Hamburg-Uhlenhorst. After attending high school in Hamburg-Bergedorf, he went to trade school in Hamburg in 1917. In 1918, he participated in World War I as a soldier. From 1918 to 1922, he completed agricultural training and studied agriculture from 1922 to 1925. From 1926 onwards, he was a self-employed farmer at Gut Frauenholz. From 1948 to 1959, Schwarz was the second state chairman of the Schleswig-Holstein Farmers' Association and simultaneously a member of the presidency of the German Farmers' Association.\nWerner Schwarz is the father of Schleswig-Holstein state minister Henning Schwarz (1928–1993), who was acting Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein from 1987 to 1988, and thus the grandfather of politician Sabine Sütterlin-Waack (born 1958). Through his son Günther (1928–2014), who was mayor of the municipality of Rethwisch from 1987 to 1994, he is also the grandfather of the farmers' association official and politician Werner Schwarz (born 1960). Two of his grandchildren are thus simultaneously Schleswig-Holstein state ministers in the Second Günther cabinet.\nFrom 1953 to 1965, Schwarz was a Member of the Bundestag (MdB). He was always directly elected as the representative of the Stormarn constituency in the Bundestag.\nAfter Heinrich Lübke was elected Federal President, Schwarz was appointed Federal Minister of Food, Agriculture and Forestry on 14 October 1959 as his successor in the federal government led by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. He retained this position initially under Chancellor Ludwig Erhard and then left the federal government on 26 October 1965 after the 1965 West German federal election.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* .\n* [https://www.kas.de/de/web/geschichte-der-cdu/personen/biogramm-detail/-/content/werner-schwarz-1 Biography of Werner Schwarz] on the [https://www.kas.de/de/web/geschichte-der-cdu History of the CDU] website of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.&nbsp;V."
