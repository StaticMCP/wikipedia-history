The house consists of two sections, the -story kitchen wing, dating from the early 18th century, and the -story living room wing, dating from about 1820. It is a good illustration of the incorporation of an early house into a later structure without the loss of the earlier building's identity.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*, including photo from 1974, at Maryland Historical Trust"
