It is supported by the world’s leading beer, wine, and spirits producers; a relationship which has been the subject of significant scrutiny and criticism from groups such as the International Organization of Good Templars.\nHistory\nIARD was launched in January 2015 and builds on two decades of research, policy analysis and programs by the International Center for Alcohol Policies (ICAP), as well as the efforts of the Global Alcohol Producers Group (GAPG).\nProducers' Commitments\nThe 11 (at the time) CEO signatories and their companies are part of the Producers' Commitments to reduce harmful drinking. IARD was the secretariat to the Beer, Wine and Spirits Producers’ Commitments to Reduce Harmful Drinking. IARD’s formation was driven by the companies’ keenness to increase momentum around the Commitments and, in general, to step up action to meet the target on harmful drinking agreed by governments.\nReferences"
