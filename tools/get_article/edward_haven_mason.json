His books include: Essays for United States Postage Stamps, published in 1911; The Proofs and Essays for the U.S. Envelopes, also in 1911, and More Essays for United States Postage Stamps, in 1912.\nMason's listings of proofs and essays were the basis for their listing in Scott U.S. Specialized Catalogue of Stamps.\nPublication restraints\nAt the time Mason performed his studies and wrote, it was illegal in the United States to publish illustrations of United States postage stamp material. As a result, his works have no illustrations.\nHonors and awards\nEdward Mason was named to the American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame in 1949.\nLegacy\nOnly ten copies of Mason's books, with photographs interleaved by the New England Stamp Company, were especially printed. Copies of these interleaved books are located at the Collectors Club of New York and at the Smithsonian Institution, in the library of the National Postal Museum.\nPersonal life\nMason was born in Newton, Massachusetts on June 8, 1849, the son of United States Attorney David H. Mason and the brother of attorney and football coach Frank A. Mason.\nHe married Lelia Sylvina Nickerson on February 1, 1877, and they had three children.\nHe died at his home in Boston on March 21, 1917.\nSee also\n* Philately\n* Philatelic literature\nReferences"
