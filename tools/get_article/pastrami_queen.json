The kosher restaurant opened in 1956. They've since opened (2020) a location on the Upper West Side considered their flagship location. They took over the former Fine & Schapiro, a long-time kosher deli in the space.\nReviews\nIn 2016, Anthony Bourdain said: \"If I'm away from New York long enough, I need a correct pastrami sandwich from either Pastrami Queen or Katz's. And you're not getting that anywhere else, as far as I'm concerned.\"\nSee also\n* List of Ashkenazi Jewish restaurants\nReferences"
