      "text": "# Heritage structures in Hyderabad, India\n\nThe Heritage Conservation Committee under HUDA was formed by state government in 1981 to retain architectural, historical and social value of buildings. Hyderabad Urban Development Authority has listed almost 160 buildings in Hyderabad in Telangana state as heritage structures. Almost 70% of heritage buildings are in private hands. Heritage structures include buildings, monuments, rock structures etc.\nBy notifying such structures, Heritage Conservation Committee in collaboration with  (INTACH) works to retain their architectural, historical and social importance and tries to convince the owners not to destroy the listed heritage structures lured by the commercial potential of their properties. The buildings are graded as Grade I, Grade II & Grade III. However, experts feel due to lack of support from the state government it has become difficult to preserve the status of these buildings. Various buildings such as Ravi Bar, Adil Alam Mansion, Central Building Division & Devdi Ranachand – Ahotichand have been demolished but the names of these buildings are still being retained in the list.\nList of heritage buildings as per HUDA\nFollowing are the list of the heritage buildings in Hyderabad recognized by HUDA. This list is constantly upgraded by HUDA. The buildings proposed by HUDA are to be approved by the state government.()\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Sl. No !! Building !! Location !!
