Cree fighters began a series of attacks on Canadian settlements on April 2. On April 15, they captured Fort Pitt from a detachment of North-West Mounted Police.\nBackground\nIn the Canadian North-West, a period of escalating unrest immediately preceded the rebellion as Ottawa refused to negotiate with its disaffected citizens. While the Métis under Louis Riel declared a provisional government and mobilized their forces, Cree chief Big Bear was not planning any militarization or violence toward the Canadian settlers or government. Rather, he had tried to unify the Cree into a political confederacy powerful enough to oppose the marginalization of native people in Canadian society and renegotiate unjust land treaties imposed on Saskatchewan natives in the 1860s.\nThis nominally peaceful disposition was shattered in late March by news of the Métis victory over government forces at Duck Lake. Support for Riel was strong among First Nations people. On April 2, Big Bear's warriors attacked the small settlement of Frog Lake, killing nine officials and civilians. Big Bear, against his wishes, was drawn into the rebellion.\nOther attacks then took place, with Cree fighters pillaging the towns of Lac La Biche, Saddle Lake, Beaverhill Lake, Bear Hills, Lac St. Anne and Green Lake. These events prompted the mobilization of the Alberta field force under Thomas Bland Strange and two other columns of government milita units.  Cree fighters defeated units of the Alberta Field Force at the Battle of Frenchman's Butte.\nBattle\nOn April 15, 1885 Cree fighters descended on Fort Pitt. They intercepted a small police scouting party, killing a constable, wounding another, and captured a third. Surrounded and outnumbered, garrison commander Francis Dickens (son of famed novelist Charles Dickens) capitulated and agreed to negotiate with the attackers. Big Bear released the police officers under Dickens's control but kept the townspeople as hostages and destroyed the fort.\nInspector Dickens and his men eventually reached safety at Battleford, having walked six days. Dickens's decision not to fight to defend the townspeople was later criticized.\nLegacy\nIn the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck lake, that \"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\"\nFort Pitt, the scene of the Battle of Fort Pitt, is a Provincial Park and National Historic site where a National Historic Sites and Monuments plaque designates where Treaty six was signed.\nSee also\n* List of battles won by Indigenous peoples of the Americas\nReferences"
