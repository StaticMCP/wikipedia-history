Traditionally, prisoners are pardoned on religious holidays such as Vesak and Christmas following a review by the Ministry of Justice. In the past Presidential Pardons have been criticized, and in the case of the pardon issued to Jude Shramantha Jayamaha was overturn by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka.\nThe scandal started when it came to light that a former financier W.H. Athula Tilakaratne, who was convicted for misappropriating Rs. 4 million was released under a presidential pardon granted on Vesak day in May 2025, after having only served 10 days of his term. Initaly the Prisons Department spokesperson stated that Tilakaratne had been included as he met the eligibility criteria for the pardon, while the President’s media office had claimed that the inmate’s name was not included in the list of inmates pardoned. Ananda Wijepala, Minister of Public Security stated that the Tilakaratne was released outside the list of inmates approved by the president. President Dissanayake on May 7 ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to conduct a formal investigation. The investigation resulted in the arrest of the Deputy Commissioner of Anuradhapura. Following a decision of the cabinet of ministers to suspend the Commissioner General of Prisons, Thushara Upuldeniya on May 9, Upuldeniya was arrested by the CID and remanded by the Colombo Magistrate’s Court. This was followed by the resignation of the Prisons Department spokesperson on June 12.\nReferences"
