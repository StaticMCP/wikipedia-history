Employing over 50 staff and over 100 volunteers; it includes the Idaho State Historical Museum, the official state museum; the Idaho State Archives, which provides public access to state archives, for which it is responsible, in addition to a variety of other reference material; the State Historic Preservation Office, which maintains records of historic places and archaeological sites in the state; and the Historic Sites Program, which oversees a number of historic sites including the Old Idaho State Penitentiary.\nHistory and organization\nThe ISHS was established in 1881, eighteen years after the Idaho Territory was established, and nine years before statehood in 1890. Initially named the Historical Society of Idaho Pioneers, its goal was to discover and preserve Idaho's heritage. Early efforts of the Historical Society led to the establishment of the Idaho State Historical Society as a state agency in 1907.\nThe ISHS is charged with responsibility of preserving Idaho's rich history and prehistory in accordance with Chapters 41 and 46 of Title 67 of the Idaho Code, and other statutory capacity assigned by Titles 14, 31, 33, 58, and 63. A board of trustees has statutory authority for setting policy for the society.\nFrom its original \"library and cabinet\" meant to preserve \"literary and scientific objects\" the Society has evolved to include the Idaho State Historical Museum, the Public Archives and Research Library, the State Historic Preservation Office, the Historic Sites Program, and the Administration unit. The ISHS has a seven-member Board of Trustees appointed by the governor to represent Idaho's seven judicial districts.  The Society now directly reaches more than 100,000 people annually and serves an additional 700,000 on its web site. http://www.history.idaho.gov\nIdaho State Historical Museum\nThe Idaho State Historical Museum, located in Idaho's capital city of Boise, is the official state historical museum. From its origin as a \"cabinet of curiosities,\" the Idaho State Historical Museum has become the largest and most visited museum in the state.  Its many interactive programs educate visitors in the historical value of its diverse and comprehensive collections. It is the official repository of artifacts relating to Idaho's and regional history.\nThe museum's collection is made up of over 250,000 objects.  The collection includes a comprehensive permanent exhibit on Idaho's history, and exhibits on the state's varied cultures, occupations, and experiences.

Curtis Earl Exhibit at the Old Idaho State Penitentiary, featuring one of the nation's largest collections of historic arms and military memorabilia. The museum also developed and maintains the adjacent Pioneer Village, which includes some of the oldest buildings in Idaho: the Isaac Coston log cabin (1863), Thomas Logan adobe house (1865), and the Richard Adelmann house (1870-80s). Currently under construction in the village is the Lewis and Clark Discovery Trail, an outdoor, hands-on interpretive area focused on the scientific legacy of the Voyage of Discovery.\nThe Idaho State Historical Museum was one of the first western institutions, and the first in the state of Idaho, to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). The museum strictly follows the professional standards and procedures set by the AAM. It hosts over 30,000 visitors each year, including approximately 12,000 schoolchildren.

The staff also provide technical assistance on records management issues to governmental agencies in Idaho and general workshops on research methodology and other topics for the public.\nPublic archives\nOn March 12, 1947, the Idaho Legislature enacted legislation assigning state archival authority to the ISHS (Idaho Session Laws, C.161'47, pp.&nbsp;416–417).  The Society was charged with establishing a unified state archive \"in order to preserve and protect the historically important state, county, city, and village archives, and thus facilitate the use of Idaho records for official reference and historical research.\" The law further authorized and empowered custodians of records not in current use, but of historical significance to the state, or any county, city, or village, to deliver the records to the ISHS for permanent preservation. The law provided for the certification of such records by the ISHS and authorized the ISHS to require and supervise the collection of historically important archives. These powers and duties are captured in Idaho Code 67–4126.  The archives has been part of PARL since 2006.\nThe archive serves as a focal point for public records management standards guidelines, procedures, and educational offerings covering:\n* essential records protection\n* file classification and maintenance\n* electronic records management\n* microfilm preparation and transfer\n* non-current records storage and retrieval\n* security storage of microfilm copies of essential records\n* disaster preparedness and recovery information\n* records retention and disposition\n* archival records transfer procedures\nResearch Library\nThe Research Library provides access and reference, both in person and digitally, to any patron who submits a query.
