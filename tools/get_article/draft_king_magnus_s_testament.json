It takes the form of a fictitious testament attributed to King Magnus Eriksson of Sweden, who reigned as King of Sweden and Norway during the 14th century, and vaged an unsuccessful crusade against Novgorod in 13481351. The text serves as a cautionary tale, warning Sweden and Norway against waging war on the Russians.\nContent and narrative\nThe Testament is presented as a first-person monologue by King Magnus Eriksson. In this pseudo-autobiographical account, Magnus recounts his disastrous crusade against Novgorod in 1347–1351. The narrative emphasizes the idea that God punishes those who attack Rus' (the old East Slavic lands). The text begins with Magnus urging his \"children, brothers and the whole Swedish land\" never to violate the \"cross-kissing\" (an oath on the cross, signifying a peace treaty) by attacking Rus', stating \"we do not succeed with this\". Magnus then provides a brief historical overview of Swedish–Russian relations, highlighting previous failed Swedish military attempts:\n* The 1240 raid led by Birger Jarl (referred to as Prince Berger or kniaz' Berger') on the Neva River at the Izhora River's mouth, where he was defeated by Aleksander Nevsky. Aleksander earned his epithet \"Nevsky\" after this victory. The Testament is the sole source explicitly naming Birger as the leader of this expedition.\n* Tyrgils Knutsson's attempt in 1300 to establish the Landskrona Fortress (Venec zemli) at the Okhta River's mouth on the Neva, which was subsequently conquered by Novgorodians led by Aleksander Nevsky's son Andrey. In the Testament, Tyrgils is elevated to \"my brother, Prince\" (brat moi kniaz), unlike other chronicles that simply call him \"agent of the king\".\n* The conclusion of the 1323 Treaty of Nöteborg, where Sweden is represented by a collective \"we\" who \"concluded eternal peace with Prince Iurii on the Neva\".\nAbove from [Isoaho 2006]\nThe narrative then focuses on Magnus's violation of the 1323 treaty through his crusade of 1347–1351 against Novgorod. This violation, a central motif, is detailed through several episodes:\n* Magnus conquering Nöteborg (Orekhov), stationing his men there, and departing overseas.\nNovgorodians retaking the fortress.\n* A year later, Magnus returning to Nöteborg, but upon learning it was lost, proceeding to Koporye.\n* Magnus fleeing Koporye after hearing Novgorodians were near.\n* A storm drowning his army at the Narva River estuary, while Magnus himself escaped. The Testament is the only source explicitly stating Magnus undertook two separate expeditions during this crusade, with details of the second confirmed by other sources.\nThe Testament deviates significantly from historical accounts after Magnus's encounters with Rus'. The author portrays the remainder of Magnus's life as a series of disasters. Sweden suffers from floods, plague, hunger, and civil war. God takes away Magnus's sanity, and he is imprisoned for a year, chained to a wall. His son, Hakon (\"Sakun\"), then takes him to Norway. There, Magnus is shipwrecked, and his men drown.\nHowever, instead of drowning, the Testament claims Magnus miraculously survived: \"I managed to sail for three days and three nights fixed by the edge of my sword to the bottom of the ship. And God brought me under the monastery of the Holy Saviour in the Polna River; and monks took me from the planks and carried me into the monastery, tonsured me in monkhood and schema\". Magnus is said to have lived three more days and nights, during which he wrote his Testament, explaining that God punished him for his \"self-conceit\" in attacking Rus'. He repeats his admonition to his people, warning them against similar actions.\nDate of composition and sources\nThe Testament was written between the late 14th and mid-15th centuries. The author was well-informed about the Swedish-Novgorodian war and conditions in Sweden.\nThe earliest surviving manuscripts containing the Testament are copies of the First Sofia Chronicle (SIL), the Fourth Novgorod Chronicle (N4L), and the Novgorod Karamzin Chronicle (NK), generally dated to the second half of the 15th century. These chronicles are believed to have been compiled in the first half of the 15th century. As the chronicle compiler was likely not the author, the Testament itself was probably composed no later than the first quarter of the 15th century.\nFor the initial part of the narrative (up to the end of the 1347–1351 campaign), the author primarily relied on Novgorod chronicles. The ability to name Birger as the leader of the 1240 raid and describe Magnus's second expedition suggests the author had access to a now-lost chronicle.\nRegarding Swedish history after 1351, the Testament incorporates elements of Magnus's real life, though with inaccuracies that suggest reliance on oral tradition rather than written sources. For example, while Sweden did experience plague, hunger, and civil war, and Magnus was imprisoned (1365–1371) and taken to Norway by his son Hakon before his death by shipwreck in 1374, the Testament's claim of Magnus's insanity and a one-year imprisonment (instead of seven) are not fully corroborated by Swedish sources.\nHowever, historian John Lind argues that the Testament shares parallels with the Visby Chronicle, a Swedish source completed by 1412. The Visby Chronicle mentions a one-year imprisonment for Magnus (in 1360–1361), and connects his release and transfer to Norway with his subsequent death, without detailing intervening events. An interesting detail in the Visby Chronicle, where Magnus is pulled ashore by his servants after jumping overboard, may have inspired the Testament's version of Magnus being rescued by Russian monks. Lind also notes the motif of Magnus's alleged insanity appears in both the Testament and certain Swedish sources, such as Förbindelsedikten. These similarities suggest a connection between the Russian text and Nordic sources, possibly through oral tradition.\nThe Monastery of the Holy Saviour in the Polna River and Valamo\nThe author's invention of King Magnus's final journey to a Holy Saviour's Monastery in the Polna River and his entrance into monkhood there provides insight into the text's intentions. The desire to prevent Swedes from violating the 1323 Treaty and the stress on events in the Neva region suggest the author's concern for the defense of the Lake Ladoga region.\nThe Valamo Monastery, located on an island in the Valamo archipelago in northern Lake Ladoga, is the only Holy Saviour's Monastery known in that region. By the late 16th century, Valamo became associated with the defense of the Neva region against the Swedes. The name \"Polna River\" is enigmatic, appearing in medieval Russian sources in various Fenno-Scandian regions, often difficult to identify with specific rivers. Lind theorizes that \"Polna River\" may have described the complex system of archipelagos characteristic of Finland and its inner lake system, including the Valamo archipelago. A 16th-century text, The Tale of the Valamo Monastery, describes the Gulf of Bothnia as linked to the Baltic Sea by a \"Great Polna River,\" supporting the idea that \"river\" could denote such water systems.\nThe Valamo Monastery's foundation, dating between 1388 and 1415, coincided with a new phase in Swedish-Russian relations, marked by Swedish expansion into uninhabited border areas near Lake Ladoga. This prompted Novgorodian authorities to establish the monastery as a countermeasure, turning it into a state affair aimed at converting Karelians to Orthodoxy and countering Swedish influence. This context likely renewed interest in King Magnus's Crusade, especially during a peak in Novgorodian chronicle writing and copying.\nPurpose and interpretation\nThe Testament is generally considered a polemical text with a political message: divine punishment awaits those who attack Rus'. By having King Magnus, a crusader against Novgorod, convert to Orthodoxy and urge his people not to violate peace treaties, the author symbolically turns the king into a defender of Novgorod's territorial integrity. This act can be seen as a \"refined revenge\" on the part of the Novgorodian author, especially in light of King Magnus's initial attempt to debate faith with the Novgorodians during his crusade, a proposal seen as baffling and unbelievable by Russian historians but consistent with Birgitta's program for a crusade.\nThe Testament's self-condemnation and repentance by Magnus, along with the theme of divine retribution, align with other Old Russian texts, such as the Pouchenie Vladimira Monomacha. The use of a first-person monologue by a ruler to lament mistakes and misfortunes, perceiving suffering as both divine punishment and mercy, also finds parallels in Nordic rhymed chronicles like the Danish Rhymed Chronicle and the Small Rhymed Chronicle. This suggests a possible cultural commonality or Scandinavian influence on Russian medieval culture.\nThe Testament shares features with hagiographical texts, particularly in Magnus's miraculous journey and salvation through Orthodox monasticism, resembling a type of Russian saint. The discovery of saints' graves was crucial for the institution of their cults. Monks in the resurrected Valamo Monastery (after 1715) claimed King Magnus was buried there, a legend initially dismissed as an 18th-century invention based on the Testament. However, later evidence suggests this legend was not directly based on the Testament itself but on a local tradition dating back to the original monastery before its discontinuation in 1611. This implies that monks in the original Valamo Monastery may have identified a grave as King Magnus's, possibly intending to establish a cult linked to him as a convert to Russian Orthodoxy and a defender of Novgorodian territory. This raises the question of whether the Testament was intended as a hagiographical text or acquired that function over time. However, there is no evidence in Russian medieval sources to suggest that King Magnus was worshipped as a saint in Russia.\nThe Testament also resembles the icon \"The Miracle of the Icon of God's Mother of the Sign\" (Znamenie ot ikony Bogoroditsy) or \"The Battle between the Novgorodians and the Suzdalians,\" created in the mid-15th century to bolster resistance against Moscow's threat to Novgorod's independence. Both the icon and the Testament aimed to strengthen the Novgorodians' resolve against their adversaries, turning figures associated with those adversaries (Aleksandr Nevskii in the icon, King Magnus in the Testament) into champions for Novgorod.\nManuscript versions and translations\nThe Testament is found in several Russian chronicles, including the First Sofiia Chronicle, Fourth Novgorod Chronicle, and Novgorod Karamzin Chronicle. Scholars identify different redactions, such as the Sofiia type (Moscow redaction) and the Novgorod type (Novgorod redaction), with further variants like the Nikon redaction. The Moscow redaction typically presents an all-Russian perspective, while the Novgorod redaction offers a more local, Novgorodian view of history.\nThe Testament has been translated into Nordic languages. Matthias Akiander published a Swedish translation in 1849 based on the Nikon Chronicle. John Lind later published a Danish translation based on the Novgorod Karamzin Chronicle.
