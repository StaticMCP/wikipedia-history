The former Rockingham Demesne, which included Rockingham House, covered much of the area that now makes up Lough Key Forest Park.\nHistory\nIn 1771, the King family moved from King House, their house in the town of Boyle, to the newly built Kingston Hall on what later became the Rockingham Estate. The footprint and walled gardens of this house still exist and indicate its substantial size. It was later referred to as Kingston Lodge or the Steward's Lodge.\nRockingham House was later developed for the 1st Viscount Lorton and it was designed by one of the preeminent architects of the day, John Nash,  around 1809–10. The planned gardens were designed by John Sutherland around the same time and included servant's tunnels, follies, lodges and miniature castles.\nIn 1822, a third story was added to the house and the grand dome was removed significantly distorting Nash's original design.\nA number of other notable structures were also built on the estate around the same time including stables (1845) and a later gothic lodge and entrance gate.\nThe house was severely damaged in a fire in 1860 and was at that stage largely rebuilt.\nIn 1903, Rockingham House was leased by the 2nd Earl of Dudley, who served as the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 11 August 1902 to 11 December 1905.\nIn 1918, the house was raided by Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) members in order to procure arms.\nRockingham House again burned down in a fire started by an electrical fault in 1957.\nWhat remained of the estate was sold by Sir Cecil Stafford-King-Harman to the Irish Land Commission in May 1959. The Land Commission officially took control of the estate in November 1959.\nThe remains of the house were finally demolished in 1971.\nIn 1973, a brutalist concrete viewing tower known as the Moylurg Tower was built on the site of Rockingham House.\nSee also\n*McDermott's Castle\nExternal links\n*[https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/photos/rockingham-house-boyle?assettype=image&family=editorial&phrase=rockingham%20house%20boyle&sort=mostpopular 15 Getty Images views of the house in 1954]\nReferences"
