In 1761, he was also elected for Killyleagh and in 1768 for Bangor, however, chose not to sit both times. Ward was further honoured in 1781, when he was created Viscount Bangor, of Castle Ward, in the County of Down.\nFamily\n, 1785.]]\nIn December 1747, he married Lady Ann Magill, daughter of John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley, and his wife Theodosia Bligh, 10th Baroness Clifton (the widow of Robert Magill of Gill Hall), and had by her four sons and four daughters:\n*Nicholas Ward, 2nd Viscount Bangor (1750–1827)\n*John Ward, died young\n*Hon. Edward Ward (1753–1812)\n*Hon. Robert Ward (1754–1831)\n*Hon. Anna Catharine Ward\n*Hon. Sophia Ward\n*Hon. Amelia Ward, married Rev. Hugh Montgomery\n*Hon. Harriet Ward\nWard died, aged 61, at his seat Castle Ward. He was succeeded in his titles by his oldest son Nicholas, later placed under disability due to insanity. Both his third son, Edward, and fourth son, Robert, sat in the Parliament of Ireland.\nWard undertook the reconstruction of Castle Ward in the early 1760s, blending elements of both classical and Gothic architectural styles. This design was a reflection of a compromise between the viscount's preference for classical architecture and his wife's affinity for the Gothic style. Additionally, Ward expanded the estate by acquiring adjoining land and transformed it into a more spacious layout, incorporating features like a deer park.\nReferences"
