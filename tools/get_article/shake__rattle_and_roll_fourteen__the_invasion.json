Their uncle's butler told them if one of them dies within a month, his/her inheritance goes to the others. Each of them were given the responsibility of taking care of a comic book written by their uncle. The cousins show no interest to their comic books, except Donald, and throw it away. Meanwhile, Benedict is killed by Filomena, a malakat from one of his uncle's comics.\nThey return to their uncle's house only to find out the butler had died. At the strike of midnight, the characters in the comics came to life. Donald, with the help from Rosalda, a ghostly pianist, discovers there is an even stronger character, Buboy ang Munting Diablo. Buboy kills them one by one, leaving only Myra and her daughter, Gladys, as the survivors. They rush out of the house and board a taxi. Buboy, disguised as Myra's stepson, Filemon, gives her four cheques worth 5 million pesos each. As they leave, the taxi driver activates his cab's sound system to news broadcasts as nearby residents do the same on their own radios wherein they hear a reporter announcing the imminent arrival of the plane carrying Benigno Aquino, Jr.\n\"Lost Command\"\nMembers of the Philippine Army's Special Unit 21 led by 1Lt. Bert Garces and MSgt. Martin Barrientos are sent on a mission to against rebels in the remote jungles of Mindanao perpetrated by a certain Kapitan Baltog, leader of a lost command squad now known as Alsa Puersa.\nFollowing the insurgents' trail, the group goes to Barangay Pototan where Barrientos meets Bunag, a villager who claims \"undead soldiers\" were \"recruiting\" his father. An unexpected encounter leaves a third of the platoon missing including Garces as the insurgents abduct them. Barrientos decides to rescue Garces and the others, despite Corp. Upaon's suggestion to notify base and get back-up. Bunag volunteers to become a guide.\nThe group encounters a blind girl, Linda, in the forest and offers to lead them to her father, leader of a group fighting what she confirms to be zombies. Upaon voices his doubts, and could neither radio base nor convince Barrientos to go back. 1Pvt. Conde, meanwhile, supports Barrientos' decision so they push on ahead to a part of the forest that not even Bunag is familiar with.\nLinda's father turns out to be a zombie, and has been using his daughter to bring in the unsuspecting new \"recruits\". An undead Garces shows up, revealing he has retained his intellect and urges the remaining soldiers to join the \"new army\". Barrientos and his men put up a short-lived stand before they are captured.\nUpaon finally manages to radio for back-up before being dragged away by a zombie as Barrientos regains consciousness and meets a zombified vigilante named Col. Rolando Palma, revealing himself to be Kapitan Baltog. He formed the Alsa Puersa, aiming to replace the current army starting with the zombified Special Unit 21. Palma also explains he was zombified somehow due to tainted food provisions. Refusing to accept defeat after being surrounded by the undead, Barrientos manages to rescue Upaon after detonating a nearby cache. However, he is forced to euthanize Upaon who has begun to change after being forced to consume tainted meat.\nMeanwhile, Conde narrowly escapes his zombified platoon and finds Barrientos. The two try to escape but get separated along the way. Conde ends up encountering a soldier who can seemingly change into a normal human, and the outcome is left unknown. Barrientos, on the other hand, encounters Linda's father who offers to help him escape in exchange for getting Linda out of the forest. He explains the zombies are somehow unable to cross bodies of water, so he pushes Barrientos into a nearby river before being mauled by the zombified soldiers. Barrientos is found and rescued by an Army helicopter due to Upaon's earlier distress call.\nAs Barrientos recuperates in a military hospital ward, the nurse informs him that he is not the only survivor of his unit. Garces and Upaon are seen in the beds next to his, revealing that they too can morph. The ending scene shows a zombified soldier attacking a nurse.\n\"Unwanted\"\nOn December 21, 2012, Hank and his pregnant girlfriend Kate go to the mall to retrieve a gift for their parents to announce their engagement. Hank leaves Kate outside the gift shop to get their gift. As Hank was about to retrieve the gift, a sudden explosion hits the mall.\nHank soon finds himself trapped in the mall's wreckage along with other survivors: Neil, Tom, and his niece Ming. Hank is worried about Kate being separated and due to the fact that she's pregnant. The four survivors begin to search for other survivors.\nAfter encountering an electric eel-like alien electrocuting anything on its path, they begin to speculate that a group of sea creature-like aliens caused the explosion. Soon after, they encounter a lobster-like alien, which kills Neil.\nThe trio begin to make their way through the wreckage, and after some time, finds Kate, injured and traumatized by what she saw earlier. Ming then hears many survivors in the corner. When a survivor runs towards them, he tells them an unknown alien is chasing him before fleeing as the alien appears. Tom tries to fight it off, but is killed when it jumps on top of him. The alien's body unsuccessfully chases Hank, Kate, and Ming. They encounter a barber who knows the emergency exits and soon see a teenager crying. When they approach it, they realize he is being used by a lobster alien as bait for luring survivors. The alien kills Ming and the teenager while Hank and Kate flee.\nA small lobster alien chases them, but is killed when Rex, a thief who was being hauled away by security guards at the time of the explosion, shoots it with a shotgun. The four see a hooded figure in the dark and discover it to be the leader of the aliens. The aliens' mothership tries to suck everyone into it, starting with the barber. Rex tries to shoot the leader, who only clones into many as the trio flee.\nInside an arcade, they encounter the lobster aliens and the Alpha Lobster alien who is bigger and covered in spikes. Rex stays behind to buy Hank and Kate some time. Rex kills as many as he can but is eventually killed by the Alpha. Hank and Kate make their way outside the mall, only to stumble upon the chaos and destruction brought upon the city of Metro Manila, including SM Mall of Asia, the whole mall complex and the Mall of Asia Arena which has become infested with aliens. The deceased survivors: Neil, Tom, Ming, the barber, and Rex, all turned aliens, appear behind the couple. The transformed aliens tells them that Hank and Kate are the only ones left of their kind, and that they will start a new world, a new generation, infested with aliens.\nCast\nPamana\n* Herbert Bautista as Donald\n* Janice de Belen as Myra\n* Arlene Muhlach as Faye\n* Dennis Padilla as Benjie\n* Snooky Serna as Rosalda\n* Dimples Romana as Filomena\n* Lou Veloso as Katiwala\n* Empress Schuck as Cynthia\n* Ivan Dorschner as Emerson\n* Gerald Pesigan as Filemon\n* Eri Neeman as Benedict\n* Anna Vicente as Gladys\n* Fabio Ide as Konde Nado\n* Rain Pogi Quite as Buboy\n* Alex Bolado as Tiyanak\n* Johnny Barnes as Uncle Lando\nLost Command\n* Dennis Trillo as Master Sgt.
