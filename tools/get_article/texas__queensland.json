The land in the area was first settled by the McDougall brothers, who found squatters there on returning from the goldfields.

The tobacco industry had begun to be important in the late 1800s.  In the 1870s, Chinese workers began to be employed on the Texas Station to grow the crop for local use.  \"They were employed because they had grown their own tobacco before, so you use somebody who can already grow something instead of reinventing the wheel,\" local historian Robyn Griffin explained.  \"Smoking had become quite fashionable, and they would've also sold some of it to manufacturers.\" Later, during the 1900s, much of the region's tobacco was grown in the Dumaresq Valley beside the Dumaresq River.\nThe current Texas Library was opened in 2010 with minor refurbishment in 2011.\nDemographics\nIn the , the town of Texas had a population of 693 people.\nIn the , the locality of Texas had a population of 1,159 people.\nIn the , the locality of Texas had a population of 843 people.\nIn the , the locality of Texas had a population of 790 people.\nGeography\nThe town is located just  from Queensland's southern border with New South Wales, close to Bonshaw, New South Wales.
