His father Beryl Rubinstein was a musician.\nTo escape McCarthyism and as inspired by a trip he took around Europe, Rubinstein moved to England in 1952 to pursue a PhD at London School of Economics, where he completed a doctoral thesis on The decline of the Liberal Party 1880–1900 under the supervision of Richard Greaves. After graduating, Rubinstein joined the Labour Party, became a naturalised British citizen in 1964, and began teaching social history the University of Hull the following year. He also joined The Ramblers and was a campaigner for Palestinian rights and better transport.\nIn 1956, Rubinstein married Shirley Livingstone, with whom he had three children. They later divorced, and Rubenstein remarried writer and researcher Ann Holt in 1974. Rubinstein and Holt later became members of the Religious Society of Friends.\nAfter leaving Hull in 1988, Rubinstein, a Francophile, taught at French universities in Tours, Angers, and Boulogne. Back in England, he worked in local government in Tower Hamlets and Maidstone as a council and Labour Party adviser. Rubenstein and Holt retired to York in 1997, where he was an honorary fellow of the University of York. He continued to write about Quakers, York, and the history of the Labour Party. He traveled frequently and refused to own a car, relying solely on public transport and protesting rural service cuts.\nHe specialized in the 19th and 20th centuries and wrote approximately 20 books.\nHe died in 2019.\nPublications\nA selection of Rubinstein's work:\n* 1969: The Evolution of the Comprehensive School, 1926-1966 (Authored with Brian Simon.
