The state legislature chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. The vote in the legislature was 40 Republicans to 9 Democrats.\nFlorida voted for the Republican nominee, Ulysses S. Grant.\nAs a result of the status of Reconstruction, the state's three electoral votes were allocated by the State Legislature to Grant. This was the only time in the state's history that the popular vote did not decide the election in the state, as well as one of only two times nationally after the American Civil War (along with Colorado in 1876).\nResults\nReferences"
