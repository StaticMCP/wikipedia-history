At first, Ōta was not thrilled to team up with Saitō. The name Jungle Pocket is named after the famous racehorse Jungle Pocket by Saitō who was a fan of the horse. Saito has gone on to own one of Jungle Pocket's last crops, a filly that he named Omataseshimashita, as well as making cameo appearances in the anime adaptation of Umamusume, which feature an anthropomorphized version of the horse.\nJungle Pocket made several appearances on King of Conte for their conte and M-1 Grand Prix and The Manzai for their manzai. They reached the semi-finals for King of Conte 6 years in a row until 2015, when they made it to the finals for the first time. Since then, the group gained popularity and make frequent appearances on television.\nYoshimoto Kogyo announced on October 7, 2024, that Saito would be dismissed from his job, after being found out that he was arrested for having committed sexual assault in July against a 20-year old woman in a bus at a filming location in Tokyo. Saito himself confirmed the action. The remaining members will continue as a duo.\nSaito later made news for starting a business selling Baumkuchen which was criticized for being another store's products resold at a higher price.\nAchievements\nKing of Conte\n* 2008 - 2nd Round\n* 2009 - Semi-Finalist\n* 2010 - Semi-Finalist\n* 2011 - Semi-Finalist\n* 2012 - Semi-Finalist\n* 2013 - Semi-Finalist\n* 2014 - Semi-Finalist\n* 2015 - Finalist (4th Place)\n* 2016 - Finalist (Runners-up)\n* 2017 - Finalist (4th Place)\n* 2018 - Semi-Finalist\nM-1 Grand Prix\n* 2007 - 2nd Round\n* 2008 - 3rd Round\n* 2009 - Semi-Finalist\n* 2010 - Quarter-Finalist\n* 2015 - Quarter-Finalist\nThe Manzai\n* 2011 - 2nd Round\n* 2012 - Certified Manzai Comedian\n* 2013 - 2nd Round\n* 2014 - Certified Manzai Comedian\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://profile.yoshimoto.co.jp/talent/detail?id=2534 Official Profile on Yoshimoto]"
