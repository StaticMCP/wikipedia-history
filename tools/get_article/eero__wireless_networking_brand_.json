Eero aims to offer complete home Wi-Fi coverage through the use of multiple interconnected wireless nodes. Eero systems automatically route connected devices between nodes depending on signal strength. The first generation Eero router was released in February 2016, and since then, several generations have been released.\nHistory and name\nThe original Eero system was announced on February 23, 2016, and made available for purchase that same day.\nThe name Eero was chosen as a tribute to FinnishAmerican architect Eero Saarinen.\nAmazon acquired Eero in 2019 for $97 million.\nProducts\nThe first generation Eero router was pitched as the world's first home mesh Wi-Fi system. It featured 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) connectivity with 2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz bands, 2x2 MIMO antennas, and beamforming support. Each first-generation Eero node offered a range of 1,000 square feet, and the nodes were designed to wirelessly connect to each other, forming an expandable mesh network capable of providing coverage to entire homes. The original Eero stopped receiving guaranteed feature and security updates on September 30, 2022, making it the only Eero model that doesn't receive guaranteed software updates.\nIn June 2017, Eero introduced the 2nd Generation Eero, which was later retroactively branded as Eero Pro (2nd Generation), along with the Eero Beacon. The Pro was a tri-band system with support for dedicated wireless backhaul, while the Beacon was a compact plug-in extender without Ethernet ports, designed to expand coverage within existing networks.\nFollowing Amazon’s acquisition in 2019, the company launched a new dual-band system under the name Eero (2nd Generation). This model was positioned as a lower-cost alternative to the Pro line, with simplified hardware and fewer radio bands.\nThe Eero 6, Eero Pro 6, and Eero 6 Extender were announced in October 2020 and released the following month, marking the adoption of Wi-Fi 6 across the lineup. The Pro 6 added tri-band support and higher throughput, while the Extender was physically identical to the standard Eero 6 but lacked Ethernet ports and could not be used to start an Eero network, serving only to extend coverage.\nIn March 2022, Eero released the Eero 6+ and Eero Pro 6E. The Eero 6+ was a dual-band system that introduced 160 MHz channel support on the 5 GHz band, increasing available throughput compared to the Eero 6. The Pro 6E was a tri-band system that added compatibility with the 6 GHz band under Wi-Fi 6E.\nThe Eero PoE 6 and Eero PoE Gateway, released in September 2022, were designed for structured installations. The PoE 6 functioned as a ceiling or wall-mounted access point powered by Ethernet, while the Gateway acted as a central router with multiple wired ports.\nIn September 2023, the company introduced the Eero Max 7, its first Wi-Fi 7 system. It featured tri-band radios and multi-gigabit wired networking, including support for 10 Gb/s Ethernet.\nIn October 2024, Eero launched the Eero Outdoor 7, a weather-resistant Wi-Fi 7 access point intended for exterior installation, capable of extending coverage across large outdoor areas.\nIn February 2025, the company announced the Eero 7 and Eero Pro 7. The Eero 7 was a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 system, while the Pro 7 added tri-band capability and higher overall throughput.\nAt IFA 2025, Eero introduced the Eero PoE 7, continuing the PoE line with Wi-Fi 7 hardware and multi-gigabit backhaul. At the same event, the company announced Eero Signal, a USB-C cellular backup dongle with a built-in eSIM that provides failover connectivity. Eero Signal is available in both 4G LTE and 5G RedCap models; both require an annual Eero Plus subscription to enable cellular failover, which includes up to 10 GB of backup data per year. Eero also offers an Eero Plus 100 plan, which provides up to 100 GB per month of backup data. Eero PoE is slated for release in November 2025 in the US and Canada, while Eero Signal will be released in 2026.\nSoftware and services\neeroOS\nEero devices run eeroOS, the company's proprietary operating system. eeroOS regularly receives OTA updates, which, according to the company, typically include performance improvements, new features, and security enhancements. Users can manually update eeroOS from the Eero app, which is the sole method by which end users are able to set up, manage, and monitor Eero mesh Wi-Fi systems.\nEero app\nThe Eero app is a mobile application designed to facilitate the setup, management, and monitoring of Eero mesh Wi-Fi systems. It is available for iOS and Android devices. Features of the Eero app include guided network setup, real-time monitoring of the internet connection and Eero nodes, and the ability to add or remove devices to expand or modify the network as needed.\nEero Plus\nEero Plus (formerly known as Eero Secure) is a subscription service offered by Eero that provides additional networking and security features to subscribers' Eero networks.\nSome Eero Plus features include:\n; Historical data\nEnables more detailed tracking of network data usage, providing access to real-time upload and download activity.\n; Eero Internet Backup\nConfigures the Eero network to automatically connect to a nearby mobile hotspot or external Wi-Fi network as a fallback in the event that the Eero system's primary connection fails. The Eero system will remain connected to the fallback network until the issue with the primary connection is resolved.\n; Ad blocking\nEero Plus features a DNS-level ad blocker that automatically filters out most types of ads across the subscriber's Eero networks.\n; Advanced security\nThe Eero Plus advanced security suite offers active threat protection to guard against viruses, spyware, trojans, and phishing attacks. It continuously monitors for potential threats and blocks them as needed to protect connected devices.\nEero for Service Providers\nIn November 2020, Eero began collaborating with internet service providers (ISPs) to integrate its mesh Wi-Fi systems into their service offerings. ISPs can deploy and manage Eero systems via Eero for Service Providers, a suite of hardware and software tools.\nSome of the tools offered by Eero for Service Providers include:\nEero Insight\nProvides ISPs with real-time insights into customer networks. It includes tools such as network topology views, historical speed tests, bandwidth usage analytics, RF diagnostics, alerts, audit logs, outage detection, fleet analysis, and network health assessments. These capabilities aim to enable ISPs to proactively identify and address potential issues, reducing troubleshooting time and improving customer satisfaction.\nEero Secure deployment\nEero for Service Providers allows ISPs to deploy the Eero Plus subscription service with Eero Wi-Fi systems. Eero has stated that deploying Eero Secure with the company's devices has led to a 40% increase in ISP customer retention.\nCo-branded app\nCustomers are able to self-install ISP-provided Eero systems using a co-branded Eero app, which displays the ISP's branding along with Eero's. This feature indicates the provider of the broadband service within the user-facing app.\nEero for Business\nEero for Business is a subscription service designed specifically for small businesses. It utilizes Eero's hardware with software features intended to meet business needs. It's designed to support businesses with up to 100 connected devices, up to 50 employees, and spaces up to 7,500 square feet.\nFeatures include:\nMulti SSID\nEnables the creation of up to four separate SSIDs to segregate traffic for customers, business-critical operations, point-of-sale systems, and IoT devices.\nCaptive portal\nAllows businesses to customize branded captive portals, which are commonly used to present guests with a terms of service, login, or other landing page before they access the network.\nBandwidth limit\nAllows for network performance management by allocating specific bandwidth limits to different SSIDs. This feature is intended to prevent any single user or device from consuming excessive bandwidth.\nInternet Backup\nAutomatic failover to a backup internet connection, such as a secondary Wi-Fi network or hotspot, in case of primary service disruption.\nAdvanced security\nIncludes features like malware and phishing threat blocking, ad blocking, content filtering, and connected device security for both business and customer data.\nHistorical data\nAllows businesses to access historical network performance data to monitor usage patterns and identify potential issues.\nHardware specifications\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Model\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Introduced\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Wi-Fi (802.11)\nStandard\n! colspan=\"2\" | Ethernet Ports\n! colspan=\"2\" | Memory\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Range\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Thread\nSupport\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Matter\nSupport\n|-\n!
