They are located  south-east of  and  east of  town.\nThe falls formed when water erosion by streams created gorges through layers of basalt and resistant trachyte. The falls are currently retreating as large blocks at the bottom of the falls were not evident in photos taken in the 19th century. Facilities at the falls include toilets, tables and fireplaces.\nFour other waterfalls are located in the area surrounding Killarney, including the Teviot Falls, Daggs Falls, Browns Falls and Upper Browns Falls.\nSee also\n}}\n* List of waterfalls\n* List of waterfalls in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.queenslandholidays.com.au/things-to-see-and-do/queen-mary-falls-circuit/index.cfm Queen Mary Falls Circuit]\n*"
