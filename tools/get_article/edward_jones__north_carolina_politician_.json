He served for 30 years as a state trooper with the North Carolina Highway Patrol and after his retirement served as chief of police in Enfield, North Carolina.\nPolitical career\nJones entered local politics when he was elected Mayor of Enfield. In 2005, he was appointed to the North Carolina House of Representatives to fill the vacancy caused by the death of state Rep. John D. Hall. He was elected by voters in the 7th district (Halifax and Nash counties) to a regular term in November 2006. But between his election to a full term and the opening of the legislative session in January 2007, state senator Robert L. Holloman died. Local Democratic Party leaders nominated Jones to fill Holloman's seat on January 18, 2007. Jones immediately resigned his House seat and was appointed by Governor Mike Easley to the Senate on January 23. Easley then appointed Angela R. Bryant to Jones's seat in the House. Jones was elected and re-elected to the Senate in 2008, 2010, and 2012. But one month after winning a new term in the 2012 election, Jones died at the age of 62, after suffering from pancreatic cancer. He died in Halifax County, North Carolina. A five-mile portion of US Highway 301 from the Edgecombe/Halifax County line through the Town of Enfield was renamed the \"Senator Edward W. Jones Highway\" in March 2018.\nFamily\nJones was married to Mary Ann Holden of Wendell, North Carolina; they had two daughters.\nReferences\n*[https://archive.today/20130414101158/http://capitolwords.org/date/2012/07/11/E1225-4_honoring-north-carolina-state-senator-edward-jones/] Remarks on the House Floor by Rep.
