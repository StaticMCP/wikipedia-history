Originally located in the temple of Ramesses II at Abydos in Egypt, it was built in the 13th century BC. The list is similar to the one inscribed in the temple built at the site by Ramesses' father and predecessor, Seti I, but with the addition of Ramesses' own throne name and nomen. The list was found by William John Bankes in 1818 and the surviving fragments were removed in 1837 by the French consul in Egypt, dismantled and the blocks sold to the British. Severely damaged, it is now on display at the British Museum.\nRamesses' list is in fragments, so that only some of the kings' names survive. Originally, the list was believed to have consisted of four rows of 26 cartouches (borders enclosing the name of a king) in each row. The upper three rows would have contained names of the kings (76 ancestors plus Ramesses prenomen and nomen for a total of 78), while the fourth would have row merely repeats Ramesses II's prenomen and nomen. The original top row was lost in antiquity, leaving the current 3 rows with 32 cartouches of different pharaohs surviving.\nThis list omits the names of many earlier pharaohs who were apparently considered illegitimate — those were Sobekneferu, pharaohs of the Ninth Dynasty, pharaohs of the Tenth Dynasty, the Hyksos, pharaohs of the Second Intermediate Period, Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, Smenkhkare, Neferneferuaten, Tutankhamen, and Ay.\nContents\n, but had disappeared by 1842 are included here, along with reconstructions of some of the cartouches.]]\nThe names are listed in reverse chronological order from the upper right to the bottom left, as they were meant to be read.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 90%; border: 2px solid gray;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Upper row\n! colspan=\"3\" | Middle row\n|-\n! width=\"3%\" | No.\n! width=\"15%\" | Pharaoh\n! width=\"32%\" | Name written in the list\n! width=\"3%\" | No.\n! width=\"15%\" | Pharaoh\n! width=\"32%\" | Name written in the list\n|-\n| 1-8\n| Names destroyed\n| style=\"color:#999\" |Names destroyed\n| 27-34\n| Names destroyed\n| style=\"color:#999\" |Names destroyed\n|-\n| 9\n| Name destroyed\n| style=\"color:#999\" |Name destroyed\n| 35\n| Amenemhat II\n| Nebukaure\n|-\n| 10\n| Name destroyed\n| style=\"color:#999\" |Name destroyed\n| 36\n| Senusret II\n| Khakheperure\n|-\n| 11\n| Name destroyed\n| style=\"color:#999\" |Name destroyed\n| 37\n| Senusret III\n| Khakaure\n|-\n| 12\n| Name destroyed\n| style=\"color:#999\" |Name destroyed\n| 38\n| Amenemhat III\n| Nimaatre\n|-\n| 13\n| Merenre Nemtyemsaf II\n| Merenre Saemsaf\n| 39\n| Amenemhat IV\n| Maakherure\n|-\n| 14\n| Netjerkare\n| Netjerkare\n| 40\n| Ahmose I\n| Nebpehtyre\n|-\n| 15\n| Menkare\n| Menkare\n| 41\n| Amenhotep I\n| Djeserkare\n|-\n| 16\n| Neferkare II\n| Neferkare\n| 42\n| Thutmose I\n| Aakheperkare\n|-\n| 17\n| Neferkare Neby\n| Neferkare Nebseneb\n| 43\n| Thutmose II\n| Aakheperenre\n|-\n| 18\n| Djedkare Shemai\n| Djedkare Shemai\n| 44\n| Thutmose III\n| Menkheperre\n|-\n| 19\n| Neferkare Khendu\n| Neferkare Khendu\n| 45\n| Amenhotep II\n| Aakheperure\n|-\n| 20\n| Merenhor\n| Merenhor\n| 46\n| Thutmose IV\n| Menkheperure\n|-\n| 21\n| Neferkamin\n| Sneferka\n| 47\n| Amenhotep III\n| Nebmaatre\n|-\n| 22\n| Nikare\n| Nikare\n| 48\n| Horemheb\n| Djeserkheperure Setepenre\n|-\n| 23\n| Neferkare Tereru\n| Neferkare Tereru\n| 49\n| Ramesses I\n| Menpehtire\n|-\n| 24\n| Neferkahor\n| Neferkahor\n| 50\n| Seti I\n| Menmaatre\n|-\n| 25\n| Neferkare Pepiseneb\n| Neferkare Pepiseneb\n| 51\n| Ramesses II\n| Usermaatre Setepenre\n|-\n| 26\n| Neferkamin Anu\n| Sneferka Anu\n| 52\n| Ramesses II\n| Ramesses Meryamun\n|}\nSee also\n* Abydos King List (Seti I)\n* Manetho King List\n* Karnak King List\n* Palermo Stone\n* Ramesseum king list\n* Saqqara Tablet\n* Turin King List\n* Medinet Habu king list\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*"
