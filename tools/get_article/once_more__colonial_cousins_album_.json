The two have had three successful career albums, with their last work in 2001 with the release of 'Aatma' post which they went on to explore and flourish in their own individual careers.\nNow, 11 years later, they have come together to release their brand new album Colonial Cousins 'Once More' In a first of its kind event, to launch their latest album, the duo took to the jostling promenade of Carter Road in the busy suburb of Bandra, Mumbai, in a musical ensemble that worked its way from Otters Club to the amphitheater, all along performing music from their new album on top of a 40-foot canter. The performance brought out fans galore from all around who came to watch the legends. The event concluded with the official unveiling of album Colonial Cousins 'Once More'.\nTrack listing\nFrom in.com.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121114050607/http://www.in.com/music/album/colonial-cousins-once-more-95158.html COLONIAL COUSINS ONCE MORE]\n* [http://www.glamsham.com/movies/scoops/12/oct/29-news-colonial-cousins-launches-new-album-once-more-after-a-decade-101204.asp Colonial Cousins launches new album 'Once More' after a decade]"
