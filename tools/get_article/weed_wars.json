The series premiered on the Discovery Channel on December 1, 2011. The series has since been cancelled.\nIn regards to their intentions by allowing their business to be documented for television, Steve DeAngelo has said, \"We wanted to be a model to other dispensaries, most of [which] have a media phobia. We wanted to tell our story and we gave Discovery complete access so that people could make up their own minds... There are a lot of stereotypes about who comes to these dispensaries, but viewers will see our customers cover a huge cross-section of the population&nbsp;– age, race and economic classes. They will also see how Harborside treats cannabis as a medicine, and we have a high standard of medical care.\"\nPremise\nThe series is mainly focused on the employees of the marijuana dispensary and the day-to-day aspects of running the business. It also chronicles the various customers to the store, as well as both large-scale growers and smaller, patient cannabis growers who are allowed to grow a limited number of plants.\nEpisodes\n| ShortSummary=\n| Viewers=1.359\n| LineColor=71C671\n}}\n| ShortSummary=\n| Viewers=0.979\n| LineColor=71C671\n}}\n| ShortSummary=\n| Viewers=1.044\n| LineColor=71C671\n}}\n| ShortSummary=\n| Viewers=1.328\n| LineColor=71C671\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/weed-wars/ Weed Wars on Discovery.com]\n*[http://www.harborsidehealthcenter.com/index.html Harborside Health Center]"
