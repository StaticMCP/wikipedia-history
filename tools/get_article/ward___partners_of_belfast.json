It was founded by Francis Edward Ward, with both him and William J. Douglas being key people in the company. Douglas left in 1918 to start his own business, and the company became defunct some time between 1925 and 1930, when Ward also left to became the head of Clokey's stained glass division.\nThey were the principal competitors in Northern Ireland of Clokey Studios, founded by Walter Francis Clokey.\nWorks\n*Robert Johnstone Memorial Stained Glass Window (c.1918) in First Presbyterian Church of Carrickfergus, Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Northern Ireland\nReferences"
