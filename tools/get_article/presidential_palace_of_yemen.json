The palace area was a heavy security zone, guarded by the Presidential Defense Forces (formerly the Republican Guard) and was not open to the public.\nOn June 3, 2011, during the 2011 Yemeni Revolution, the Presidential Palace was subject to an assassination attack on President Saleh and many government and state officials by opposition tribesmen. It left Saleh injured and seven other top government officials wounded. Saleh, the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, the parliament chief, the governor of Sana'a and a presidential aide were wounded while they were praying at a mosque inside the palace compound. Four presidential guards and Sheikh Ali Mohsen al-Matari, an imam at the mosque, were killed.\nOn January 20, 2015, the palace was taken over by the Houthis rebel group. President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi was present but was not harmed.\nOn May 7, 2018, targeted airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition left the palace \"completely flattened\" and damaged surrounding buildings. At least six fatalities and thirty injuries are reported.\nOn August 24, 2025, in retaliation for Houthi-fired rockets toward Israel, the Israeli government launched a series of missiles at Sanaa. Israeli military said the targets of the strikes included a military compound housing the presidential palace, two power plants and a fuel storage site.\nNotes"
