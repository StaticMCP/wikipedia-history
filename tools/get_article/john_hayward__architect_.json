His son, Pearson Barry Hayward, worked under him, but died before his father in 1888; their practice was known as Messrs Hayward & Son.\nWork\nWork, including restoration, undertaken by John Hayward and his practice includes:\nIn Cornwall\n*All Saints, Herodsfoot\n*All Saints, Tuckingmill, Camborne\n*Holy Trinity, Carnmenellis\n*St Cleder, St Clether\nIn Devon\n*St Andrew, Exwick\n*St Mary, Bickleigh\n*St Mary, Bicton\n*St Michael, Sowton\n*St Mark, Dawlish\n*St David, Exeter\n*St Mary Arches, Exeter\n*St Andrew, Halberton\n*St Gregory, Harpford\n*St John the Baptist, Holcombe Burnell\n*St Thomas of Canterbury, Kingswear\n*St Mary Magdalene, Monkton\n*St Michael, Mumsbury\n*St Michael, Beer\n*St Mary, Appledore, Northam\n*St Mary, Rockbeare\n*St Mary, Whimple\n*St Mary the Virgin, Woolfardisworthy, Mid Devon\n*St Swithun, Sandford\n*St Peter, Uplowman\n*St Thomas the Apostle, Exeter\n*St John The Evangelist, Tipton St John\n*Holy Trinity, Ilfracombe\n*St Philip and St James, Ilfracombe\n*Paschoe House, Crediton\n*All Saints, Okehampton\n*St Bridget, Bridestowe\n*Holy Trinity, Buckfastleigh\n*Holy Trinity, Burrington\n*St Eustachius' Church, Tavistock\n*St Peter, Twitchen\n*St Mary, Uffculme\n*Crediton Parish Church\n*St Michael and All Angels, Alphington\n*St Luke's College, Exeter University\n*The Exeter Diocesan Training School, now part of St. Luke's Campus\n*All Hallows on the Wall, Exeter (since demolished)\n*Queen Elizabeth School, Crediton\n*Hele's School, Exeter\n*The New Buildings, Blundell's School, Tiverton\n*Blundell's School chapel, Tiverton\n*The High School for Girls, Exeter.
