The buildings have elements of Federation Free Style architectural design such as asymmetry and use of two contrasting building materials of brick and cement render.\nReplacing a single storied bungalow structure that faced York Street, the Empire theatre was designed by architect Tom Anthoness and was built by J. Ashman and Warner. Initially the building held a theatre and shops. The theatre was able to hold 1,000 people. The theatre cost £5,000 and was owned and operated by West's Picture Company. It boasted refreshment stalls, a winter garden for ladies and a spacious dress circle.\nFeatures of the two storey building include a corner entrance, asymmetrical facade, parapet wall concealing roof, informal groupings of windows, gabled pediment and decorative skyline features.\nIn 2000 a portion of the building was converted to a nightclub. It was closed for some time and reopened to include a bar on the ground floor in 2006.\nSee also\n* List of places on the State Register of Heritage Places in the City of Albany\nReferences"
