When the production decided to make it into a drama, they planned 12 episodes like the twelve hours of the Chinese zodiac, but they were eventually reduced to eight to keep a fast pace. The script was rewritten about 90 times by Lee Byoung-hak over the course of three and a half years.\nThe production teamed up with historians for the costumes and makeup, and referenced Goguryeo murals for the hairstyles.\nJung Se-kyo explained that he wanted to dramatize Queen Woo's story because he was fascinated by the fact that she chose the king to be crowned with her own hands, instead of remaining helpless in the palace, and by the motive that pushed her to become queen twice. The titular character is played by Jeon Jong-seo, in her first costume drama, who said that she was attracted to Woo Hee \"because she is an ambitious, honest and progressive woman,\" and that she was honored to portray an important figure who had played a key role in Korean history. Kim Mu-yeol was directly approached by the director for the part of Eul Pa-so after having worked together in 2011 in War of the Arrows; Lee Soo-hyuk was instead offered the role of Noe-eum, but the actor insisted on playing Go Bal-gi.\nReception\nCritical response\nUpon the release of the first promotional photos, the clothing, hairstyles, and accessories of the main characters were criticized as anachronistic and historically inaccurate for resembling styles from the Chinese Qin dynasty and Warring States period. For instance, the appearance of Eul Pa-so was noted to closely resemble a character from The Qin Empire. Hong Seok-kyung, a professor of journalism and information at Seoul National University, defended the series, stating that some similarities could be plausible and that, since there is no extensive contemporary evidence, the production team was entitled to take creative liberties.\nThe first part of the series was met with mixed reviews. While some appreciated the female-led narrative, the fast pace, the sets and the fight scenes, others criticized the acting, the low volume of the voices and the gratuitous use of intimate scenes, claiming that they often felt out of place and interrupted the storyline. Reviews have noted an excessive amount of degrading violence against women: an often cited scene is when the king's younger brother, Go Bal-gi, bends his wife over a table and, while having intercourse, impales her in the back with his sword. A few minutes later, he stabs a wall in frustration, accidentally killing a woman on the other side, and orders his guards to chop off the heads of all the remaining maids in the palace. The second part was appreciated for its greater content of action scenes, but the open ending left viewers and critics perplexed. For Pierce Conran of South China Morning Post, the series is dull, dry and confusing.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Award ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | APAN Star Awards\n| style=\"text-align:center\" | 2024\n| Male Acting Award\n| Park Ji-hwan\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
