Narre Warren South recorded a population of 30,909 at the 2021 census.\nHistory\nSince the mid-1990s, Narre Warren South has become a booming suburb, taking over what was once was a rural area with few farms or rural areas remaining. In the last 10 years, many subdivisions have been developed, including Berwick Springs estate, which was launched in 1999, and Cypress Hill estate/Hillsmeade, which was launched around the same time.\nThere are now other estates in the area, such as Golden Grove estate, Camden Greens Estate, Berwick Springs and Silverleaf.\nEducation\nNarre Warren South is home to Narre Warren South P-12 College, a public school catering for students from Prep to Year 12. The college has one of the largest student enrolments in Victoria, with nearly 2000 students and more than 150 staff members. Narre Warren South is also serviced by Hillsmeade Primary School, a public school, Trinity Catholic Primary School, a co-educational Catholic school, and Strathaird Primary School, which has grown to be one of the top public primary schools in Melbourne.\nAs of November 2010, ICA Casey, a private school in Narre Warren South, was placed in voluntary administration.\nThe campus of the former ICA Casey is now occupied by Waverley Christian College.\nRetail\nNarre Warren South has two shopping centres. Casey Central Shopping Centre, located on Narre Warren-Cranbourne Road, is and has been anchored by a Coles Supermarket, Woolworths Supermarket, Aldi Supermarket and a Target Department Store since March 2016.
