The conference provides an archival source for important reuse papers. The conference is also meant to provide reuse information and education to practitioners, and to be an  ongoing platform for technology transfer.\nSoftware reusability, the use of knowledge or artifacts from existing systems to build new ones, is a key software engineering technology important both to engineers and managers. Reuse research has been very  active. Many organizations have reported reuse successes, yet there are still important research issues in  systematic reuse. There is a need for reuse solutions that can be applied across domain and organization boundaries. The conference consists of technical presentations, parallel working groups, plenary sessions, demonstrations, and tutorials.\nTopics include  reuse metrics, case studies and experiments, copyright and legal issues, current issues in reuse libraries, distributed components, formal methods, design and validation of components, domain analysis and engineering, generators, and Integration frameworks.\nList of conferences:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Conference\n!Location\n!Dates\n|-\n|ICSR 22\n|Ottawa, Canada\n|April 27, 2025\n|-\n|ICSR 21\n|Limasson, Cyprus\n|June 19-20, 2024\n|-\n|ICSR 20\n|Montpellier, France\n|June 15-17, 2022\n|-\n|ICSR 19\n|Hammamet, Tunisia\n|December 2-4, 2020\n|-\n|ICSR 18\n|Cincinnati, USA\n|June 26-28, 2019\n|-\n|ICSR 17\n|Madrid, Spain\n|May 21-13, 2018\n|-\n|ICSR 16\n|Salvador, Brazil\n|May 29–31, 2017\n|-\n|ICSR-15\n|Cyprus\n|June 5–7, 2016\n|-\n|ICSR-14\n|University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL\n|January 4–6, 2015\n|-\n|ICSR-13\n|Pisa, Italy\n|June 18–21, 2013\n|-\n|ICSR-12\n|Pohang, South Korea\n|June 13–17, 2011\n|-\n|ICSR-11\n|Falls Church, VA, USA\n|September 27–30, 2009\n|-\n|ICSR-10\n|Beijing, China\n|May 25–29, 2008\n|-\n|ICSR-9\n|Turin, Italy\n|June 12–15, 2006\n|-\n|ICSR-8\n|Madrid, Spain\n|July 5–9, 2004\n|-\n|ICSR-7\n|Austin, TX, USA\n|April 15–19, 2002\n|-\n|ICSR-6\n|Vienna, Austria\n|June 27–29, 2000\n|-\n|ICSR-5\n|Victoria, B.C., Canada\n|June 2–5, 1998\n|-\n|ICSR-4\n|Orlando, FL, USA\n|April 23–26, 1996\n|-\n|ICSR-3\n|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n|1994\n|-\n|IWSR-2\n|Lucca, Italy\n|1992\n|-\n|IWSR-1\n|Dortmund, Germany\n|1991\n|-\n|WISR3\n|Syracuse University\n|June 13–15, 1990\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://wfrakes.wordpress.com/ ReNews]"
