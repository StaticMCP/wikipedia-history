The salinity level of the King River at discharge is 800&nbsp;mg/L.\nHistory\nThe river was named after an early explorer of the Australian and Patagonian coasts, Phillip Parker King, by Thomas Braidwood Wilson while exploring the region in December 1829.\nThe estuarine zone of the river is from the mouth to  upstream to where Mill Brook joins the river.\nThe area around Lower King was a known haunt for sealers in 1831. It was settled later in the 1830s but the townsite was not gazetted until 1959.\nThe Lower King River Bridge was constructed in 1898 and washed away during a storm in 1900. Both the upper and lower bridges were damaged during storms in 1902. In 1944 and 1947 parts of the lower bridge collapsed and rebuilt.\nIn January 2019 the Upper King Bridge was burned by a deliberately lit fire causing 300,000 in damage.\nTributaries\nThe main tributary of the King River is Mill Brook which joins the King about  north-west of the Upper King Bridge.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Muirden, Peter: Pen, Luke and Marnie Leybourne (2003) Stream and catchment hydrology in South West Western Australia Perth, W.A.
