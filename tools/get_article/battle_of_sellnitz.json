The Saxons were led by Frederick II of Saxony. On his journey to Saxony from Bohemia was accompanied by czech noble Jakoubek of Vřesovice, the former hussite leader (hetman) of the Union of Žatec and Louny, now hetman of the region Litoměřice and Žatec. During their journey they clashed with the hussite army of the Union of Žatec and Louny led by several nobles strengthened by 300 Polish cavalrymen. Jakoubek tried to negotiate with his former companions, but failed. The Saxons won the battle; about 2,000 Hussites were killed, and again as many taken prisoner.\nAccording to the Želenice Chronicle, the battle took place at the foot of Želenice Hill. The chronicle states, among other things, that in 1923 a farmer found several relatively well-preserved weapons and coins from that time while ploughing. However, the location of the battle is disputable, because according to Palacký Jakoubek \"pulled ... beyond the Bílina\", i.e. the battle could have taken place on the other side of the river.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Schlesinger, Ludwig.
