The platform targets industries such as retail, hospitality, healthcare, and manufacturing, where employees typically do not work at desks.\nBlink was founded in 2018 in London, United Kingdom by Sean Nolan. The company began with the goal of providing a mobile-first solution to improve organizational communication, with an emphasis on enabling businesses to better connect with their workforce outside the traditional office environment. In 2021, Blink raised $20 million at a $100 million valuation in a Series A round led by Next47. It grew its US side of the business by 159% in the fiscal year concluding February 2024. In 2025, Blink announced its partnership with McDonald's to provide the platform to crew members globally.\nReferences"
