From 1920 to 1971 these horses constituted a separate population – the Moravian Warmblood – but from 1971 they were registered in the stud-book of the Czech Warmblood, which also held many cross-breeds of Czechoslovak warmblood horses with imported foreign breeds such as the Trakehner.\nEfforts to re-establish the Moravian Warmblood as a separate breed began in 1996. A breed society, the Society of Breeders and Friends of the Moravian Warmblood (), was officially approved by the Czech ministry of agriculture in 2004, and a stud-book was opened in the same year.\nA total of 150 mares and 12 stallions had been identified as suitable for inclusion in the new stud-book; of these, 67 mares and 10 stallions were registered in 2004. By 2011 the total registered stock had grown to 280 head, including 167 brood-mares and 22 stallions at stud. In 2025 there were 600 horses in all, with a breeding stock of 36 stallions and 266 mares; the conservation status of the breed was listed as 'at risk/critical'.\nIn 2018 the Moravian Warmblood was found to be genetically more distant from the Czech Warmblood than was the Kinsky Horse, which had had its own stud-book since 2005.\nCharacteristics\nHeights at the withers are in the range  for mares and about  for stallions and geldings. The coat is usually bay; chestnut, black and grey also occur.\nUse\nThe horses may used both for riding and in harness.\nReferences\n. Archived 23 June 2020.\n}}"
