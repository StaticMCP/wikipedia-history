Armand de Breze employed a hitherto unknown tactic to attack the Spanish convoy from both sides. The Spanish lost a galleon and a small vessel but the convoy completed its journey and delivered most of its cargoes including its silver bullion. French losses are unknown.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
