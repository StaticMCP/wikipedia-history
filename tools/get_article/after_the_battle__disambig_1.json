The editor-in-chief since 1973 was Winston Ramsey, assisted by his co-author Gail Parker Ramsey, and editor Karel Margry.\nThe magazine dealt with World War II in a \"then and now format\". Articles were illustrated by historical photographs matched with a modern-day photograph of the identical scene to show how much (or how little) things have changed. Most issues featured a major article on a specific subject, with several smaller articles. All areas of the world were written about.\nThere were also occasional features on related subjects such as war films, vehicle preservation, war memorials.\nPen and Sword Books took over the title, but have not produced new issues since No. 195, labelled the final issue.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
