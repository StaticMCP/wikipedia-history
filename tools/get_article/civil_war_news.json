The set featured colorful painted artwork and was characterized by vivid colors, graphic depictions of violence, death and blood (base card #21 \"Painful Death\" being a prime example) and exaggerations of warfare, in a similar tone to the 1938 Gum Inc.'s Horrors of War, which was equally popular.\nOverview\nThe complete set consists of 88 cards, including a checklist, and was first printed for the United States market in 1962 to coincide with the centennial of the American Civil War.
