      "text": "# Good King Bad\n\nGood King Bad is the thirteenth studio album by American guitarist George Benson featuring performances recorded in 1975 and released by CTI Records in 1976.\nReception\nThe Allmusic review states \"The R&B elements get stronger, the sound and mix are more attuned to the dancefloor, yet this brings out the best in George Benson's funky side. Thanks in part to the more rigid beat, Benson pares down his style to its rhythmic essentials, refusing to spray notes all over the place at random, and as a result, the record cooks and dances\".\n|rev2 = The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nTrack listing\n# \"Theme from Good King Bad\" (David Matthews) – 6:03 Grammy Award for Best R&B Instrumental Performance 1977\n# \"One Rock Don't Make No Boulder\" (Matthews) – 6:50\n# \"Em\" (Philip Namanworth) – 4:56\n# \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\" (Vince Guaraldi) – 7:00\n# \"Siberian Workout\" (Matthews) – 6:45\n# \"Shell of a Man\" (Eugene McDaniels) – 5:17\n# \"Hold On!
