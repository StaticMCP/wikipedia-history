The Tokugawa troops received reinforcements from Niwa Nagashige and Horio Tadaharu, whose forces included a number of arquebusiers. They brought orders from the Tokugawa commander, Tokugawa Ieyasu, that Uesugi Kagekatsu should withdraw from the battle and take a rest; Kagekatsu insisted that this was an affront to his honor, as the Uesugi traditionally would not retire from a battle in progress.\nReferences\n*Turnbull, Stephen (1998).
