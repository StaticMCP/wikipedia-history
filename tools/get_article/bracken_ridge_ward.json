It was established for the 1985 Brisbane City Council election, and is one of only eight wards to have been contested at every election since 1985.\nThe ward has been represented by the Liberal Party, and subsequently the Liberal National Party, since its creation. It has been represented by Sandy Landers of the Liberal National Party since October 2019.\nHistory\nThe Bracken Ridge Ward was established for the 1985 Brisbane City Council election, as part of increasing the number of wards in the City of Brisbane was increased from 21 to 26. The ward was created from the western half of the abolished Bramble Bay Ward – covering the suburbs of  Bracken Ridge, Bald Hills, and Fitzgibbon – and a small part of the retained (but significantly altered) Chermside Ward – covering parts of the suburbs of Aspley, Carseldine, Zillmere. It has since largely maintained these boundaries; losing a small section of Zillmere and gaining the rest of Carseldine.\nAt the 1985 election, Keith Murray was elected for the Liberal Party, contributing to the party's defeat of the incumbent Labor Party after twenty-four years in office. Murray was re-elected at the 1988, 1991, and 1994 elections.\nCarol Cashman succeeded Murray for the Liberal Party at the 1997 election, and was re-elected in 2000 and 2004. Cashman resigned in 2007, and Amanda Cooper was appointed to the casual vacancy. Cooper retained the ward for the Liberal Party at the 2008 election, which merged with the Nationals to form the Liberal National Party in July of that year. She was re-elected at the 2012 and 2016 elections, and represented the ward until October 2019, when she resigned to (unsuccessfully) contest the District of Aspley in the 2020 Queensland state election for the Liberal National Party.\nSandy Landers was appointed in October 2019 to fill the casual vacancy caused by Cooper's resignation. She retained the ward at the 2020 election, and was re-elected at the 2024 election.\nCouncillors for Bracken Ridge Ward\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Image\n!Member\n!Party\n!Term\n!Notes\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Keith Murray\n| Liberal\n| 30 March 1985 – 15 March 1997\n|Ward established for 1985 election.\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Carol Cashman\n| Liberal\n| 15 March 1997 –\n| Resigned.\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Amanda Cooper\n| Liberal\n|  –\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Appointed to fill vacancy.
