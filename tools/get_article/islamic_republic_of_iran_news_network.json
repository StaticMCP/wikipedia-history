The main programs are political, but sports, science and medical news programs also exist. Its language is mainly in Persian; Although, in the early years of its launch, programs in English and Arabic were also broadcast on this network.\nFrom August 2022, with the launch of the second channel of the IRINN network for live broadcasting of news events, various events in Iran and the world will also be broadcast live on this channel for the audience.\nDuring the Iran–Israel War, the channel's studio at the IRIB headquarters was hit by an Israeli strike on June 16 2025 on live TV, killing the channel's editor-in-chief Nima Rajabpour and IRIB secretary Masoumeh Azimi.\nNotable publications\nJune 22, 2021\nOn June 22, 2021, the US Department of Justice seized 33 Iranian websites, which they claimed were \"spreading disinformation\". A statement by IRINN said, the move appeared to be part of a larger-scale crackdown by the U.S. on news websites linked to the “Axis of Resistance”.\nOctober 10, 2022\nDuring the 2022 Iran Protests, a Hacktivist group called \"Edalaat-e-Ali\" hacked the News Network, targeting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and showing 4 women who were victims of allegedly not covering their hair, especially Mahsa Amini, who were featured in the hacked footage scene during the news bulletin.\nAttack on IRINN studio during the 2025 Israeli airstrike\nOn June 16, 2025, the IRINN studio complex in Tehran was struck by an Israeli missile while broadcasting live. According to a live feed, a loud explosion was heard while the presenter Sahar Emami was on air, with the incident resulting in the death of two IRIB staff members, Nima Rajabpour, editor-in-chief of IRINN, and Masoumeh Azimi, secretary at IRIB.\nThe Israeli Defense Forces later confirmed they were responsible for the attack, claiming to target a secret Iranian military communication center. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz defended the strike, describing IRINN as a propaganda outlet.\nThe International Federation of Journalists condemned the Israeli strike, saying \"under international law, journalists are civilians, and deliberate attacks against them constitute war crimes\". The Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the strike.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.telewebion.com/live/irinn IRIB News Network Channel 1 Live streaming]\n*[https://www.telewebion.com/live/irinn2 IRIB News Network Channel 2 Live streaming]"
