For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n17 & 18 Geo. 5\nThe third session of the 34th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 8 February 1927 until 22 December 1927.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 17 & 18 G. 5.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  as amended by subsequent Acts.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  with a view to facilitating the provision of an Indian Navy, and to make consequential amendments in the Naval Discipline Act.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  as are necessary to give effect to a certain resolution adopted by an Imperial Conference held in London in the year nineteen hundred and twenty-six.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and to provide for the registration and inspection of maternity homes, and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  with respect to the time for the appointment of a Statutory Commission thereunder.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  with regard to the power of the Secretary of State to refer a case, or any point arising therein, to the High Court of Justiciary.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1907.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  to be applied to certain Protected States and Mandated Territories.}}\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Montrose Burgh and Harbour.|note4=|po1=Montrose Burgh and Harbour Order 1927|Provisional Order to authorise the provost magistrates and councillors of the burgh of Montrose to levy a special rate in respect of Montrose Harbour and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|  and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  to confer further powers on the Company and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|po2=Chorley Order 1927|Provisional Order for partially repealing certain Local Acts.\n|po3=Kingston-upon-Thames Order 1927|Provisional Order for partially repealing a Local Act.\n|po4=Lancaster Order 1927|Provisional Order for altering the Lancaster Corporation Act 1918.\n|po5=Shrewsbury (Markets and Slaughter-houses) Order 1927|Provisional Order for altering and amending certain Local Acts.\n|po6=West Kent Joint Hospital Order 1927|Provisional Order for altering certain Confirmation Acts.}}\n|  and 1889.\n|po3=Newport (Monmouthshire) Order 1927|Provisional Order to enable the Newport Corporation to put in force the Compulsory Clauses of the Lands Clauses Acts.\n|po4=Newtown and Llanllwchairn Order 1927|Provisional Order for altering the Newtown Water Act 1898.\n|po5=Surbiton Order 1927|Provisional Order for partially repealing altering or amending the Surbiton Improvement Act 1855.\n|po6=Tees Valley Water Order 1927|Provisional Order for altering the Tees Valley Water (Consolidation) Act 1907. }}\n-\n|  and 1924.|note4=|po1=St. Mary Llanfairisgaer Order|po1short=n}}\n|  }}\n| |po1=Scheme for the Application or Management of the Charity known as the Fuel Allotment in the Ancient Parishes of Feltwell St. Mary and Feltwell St. Nicholas in the County of Norfolk comprised in an Award dated the Eighth day of September One thousand eight hundred and fifteen made under the Inclosure Act 53 Geo.
