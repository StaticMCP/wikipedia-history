It was made in Rome by Giuseppe Ciochetti and presented to the city by Newark's Italians in 1927. The statue was removed by the city (with pedestal left in place) in June 2020 to prevent its toppling in a Black Lives Matter protest.\nA second statue of Columbus in Newark, also ordered removed by Mayor Ras Baraka, was subsequently re-erected in Sussex County, New Jersey.\nThe pedestal of the statue was removed in 2022 in preparation for the installation of A Shadow of a Face, a memorial to Harriet Tubman. The outline of the statue's plinth is inscribed on the ground as part of the new monument. As of October 2020, the statue was being stored on a vacant city lot in Newark's North Ward. In April 2024 the city made an arrangement to loan the statue to St Lucy's church in Newark for the statue to be displayed there for a period of 20 years.\nSee also\n* List of monuments and memorials to Christopher Columbus\n* List of monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests\n* List of public art in Newark, New Jersey\nReferences"
