He and others are said to have observed the light condense into a female form.\nMary supposedly appeared above the middle dome of the church. The reported apparition is then said to have moved between the domes and on to the top of the church gate between its two twin towers in front of the central church building. Many local residents reported seeing the alleged apparition of Mary.\nA representative of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria has approved the apparitions.\nPress coverage\nThis event was widely covered by Egyptian newspapers, Arabic TV channels and by the international press.\nThe news about the apparitions appeared in multiple newspapers, including the Egyptian Watani,\nAmerican Los Angeles Times,\nEgyptian Al-Ahram,\nItalian AsiaNews,\nEgyptian Almasry Alyoum,\nand Egyptian Bikya Masr.\nA December 24, 2009 Agence France Presse (AFP) article recounted nightly gatherings bringing crowds of up to 10,000 people to watch the tower in anticipation of the \"mysterious light over the church tower,\" which upon its appearance each night \"jolt[ed] the gathering into a frenzy of cries an ululations.\" This article was duplicated by several news agencies, including the Assyrian International News Agency,\nSudan Vision Daily,\nDaily Star (Lebanon),\nand British Middle East Online.\nSee also\n* Our Lady of Zeitoun\n* Our Lady of Assiut\n* Marian apparition\n* Coptic Orthodox Church\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
