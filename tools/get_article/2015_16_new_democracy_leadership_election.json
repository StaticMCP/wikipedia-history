The first round was held on 20 December 2015 and the second round was held on 10 January 2016. Kyriakos Mitsotakis was elected as the new president.\nProcedure\nWhilst the election had originally been expected to be held on 30 August 2015, 57 MPs called for interim leader Vangelis Meimarakis to stay on until spring 2016, postponing the leadership election. However, following ND's election loss in the early September 2015 elections, leadership elections were planned to be held before year's end.\nThe central electoral committee of the party met on 24 September at the request of interim leader Vangelis Meimarakis, to begin the electoral process. They set out a timetable as follows:\n* 1 October - end of candidate registration period\n* 4 October - end of objection period\n* 5 October - final approved list of candidates\nTechnical issues\nOn 21 November, when testing the electronic voting system, the Central Electoral Committee found a number of issues, which meant that the election could not start at the scheduled time of 07:00 on 22 November. Furthermore, another issue arose on the evening of the 22 that caused the Central Electoral Committee to replace 50 electoral delegates. They then took a unanimous decision to postpone the election.\nMitsotakis issued a statement saying: \"We owe a big apology to all the New Democracy supporters, and also to all Greek citizens. Unfortunately the election process can no longer take place today. This is no time to be seeking who is responsible. The time for that will come later.\" Meimarakis threatened to withdraw his candidacy if the election was not postponed, and Georgiadis called the failure a \"fiasco\" and asked for the resignation of all the members of the Central Electoral Committee.\nBoth Mitsotakis and Tzitzikostas called for Meimarakis to step down as interim leader and appoint a new interim leader. On 24 November, Meimarakis appointed Ioannis Plakiotakis, the secretary of the parliamentary group, as a Vice President of New Democracy. Later that day, Meimarakis resigned as the interim President, appointing Plakiotakis as the new interim President.\nCandidates\n{| class =\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Candidate !! Image !! Constituency !!
