She was best known for her eclectic mix of various musical genres, including soul, jazz, rock and roll and R&B. Winehouse released two albums of original music: Frank (2003) and Back to Black (2006). Frank was originally released by Island Records in October 2003 in the United Kingdom and in November 2007 in the United States. Because of the success of her second album, Frank was later re-issued in the UK in May 2008 and in the US in June 2008. Back to Black was issued under Island Records in Europe, Asia, South America and Australia, and under Universal Republic in the US. Several of Winehouse' singles have charted worldwide, including \"Rehab\", \"You Know I'm No Good\", \"Back to Black\", \"Tears Dry on Their Own\", and \"Valerie\".\nOverall, Winehouse received 29 awards from 76 nominations. Her debut album earned several awards and recognitions, including an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song (\"Stronger Than Me\"), a BRIT Award nomination for Best Female Solo Artist, and an inclusion in Robert Dimery's 2006 book, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Back to Black produced numerous nominations, including two from the BRIT Awards (Best Female Solo Artist and Best British Album), six from the Grammy Awards, four from the Ivor Novello Awards, four from the MTV Europe Music Awards, three from the MTV Video Music Awards, one from the Southbank Awards (Best British Female Artist), three from the World Music Awards, and one each from the Mercury Prize (Album of the Year) and MOBO Awards (Best UK Female). In 2025, Back to Black was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nBRIT Awards\nThe BRIT Awards are the British Phonographic Industry's (BPI) annual pop music awards.
