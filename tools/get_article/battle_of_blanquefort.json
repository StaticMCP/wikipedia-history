The Anglo-Gascon infantry suffered heavy losses, and the battle resulted in a decisive French victory. The battle was known locally as La Male Journade or in French\nMauvaise Journée and marked the beginning of a campaign to drive the English from Gascony.\nThe Battle\nAt the first engagement, at a place called Jallepont, the first French lines slipped away on purpose and led the Anglo-Gascons in pursuit until they reached a cul-de-sac closed by the banks of the Jalle. It was a trap: Robin Petit-Loup’s archers were hidden in the surrounding woods and decimated the pursuers in nearly an hour of heavy fire. Meanwhile, Arnaud-Amanieu d'Albret, seigneur d'Orval, closed his lines with a pincer movement which took the English from the flanks.\nThe survivors, overcome by panic, fled towards Bordeaux. A French chronicler, Jean Chartier, called into question the cowardice of Gadifier Shartoise, the English mayor of Bordeaux, whom he accused of abandoning all his soldiers on foot to flee towards Bordeaux.\nThe French knights pursued the fugitives for several kilometres, and killed all those from whom no ransom could be expected. Only the nobles and the rich bourgeois escaped the massacre.\nThe magnitude of the losses sounded the death knell for the last hopes of the English to resist the French in southwestern France.\nReferences\n*Castex, Jean-Claude , Répertoire Des Combats Franco-anglais de la Guerre de Cent Ans (1337-1453), Les Éditions du Phare-Ouest, 2012, 384 p.\n*Nicolle, David.
