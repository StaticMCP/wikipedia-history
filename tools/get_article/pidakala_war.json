At one point, villagers supporting Bhadrakali began throwing cow dung at Virabhadra, and villagers supporting Virabhadra responded with cow dung as well. The fight lasted for about an hour before the leaders of the village settled the situation and the marriage between the two gods was held.\nRecent years\nIn 2012, about 15 people were injured, but no complaints were filed. In 2022, a local official reported that up to 50 people sustained injuries, but the police received no complaints.
