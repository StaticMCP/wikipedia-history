      "text": "# List of burials in the Valley of the Kings\n\nThe following is a list of burials in the Valley of the Kings, in Thebes (modern Luxor, Egypt) and nearby areas.\nThe numbering system was established by John Gardner Wilkinson in 1821. Wilkinson numbered the 21 tombs known to him (some of which had been open since antiquity) according to their location, starting at the entrance to the valley and then moving south and west. Tombs that have been discovered since then have been allocated a sequential KV number (those in the Western Valley are known by the WV equivalent) in the order of their discovery.\nSince the mid 20th century, Egyptologists have used the acronym \"KV\" (standing for Kings' Valley) to designate tombs located in the Valley of the Kings. Additionally, the acronym \"WV\" is also used to designate tombs located in the West Valley (of the Kings).\nMap\nTable legend\n* |border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n*\n* |border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nEast Valley\nMost of the open tombs in the Valley of the Kings are located in the East Valley, and this is where most tourists can be found.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
