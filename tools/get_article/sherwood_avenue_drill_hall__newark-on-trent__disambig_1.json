The battalion was mobilised at the drill hall in August 1914 before being deployed to the Western Front and was still based there at the start of the Second World War.\nThe battalion amalgamated with 5th (Derbyshire) Battalion, to form 5th/8th Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment) in 1961. Following the cut-backs in 1967, the presence at the drill hall was reduced to a single company, E (Nottinghamshire Foresters) Company, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Battalion, The Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment in 1971. After the infantry presence in Newark was reduced to a single platoon in the early 1990s, the drill hall was decommissioned and converted for use as offices: it is currently occupied by RPS Planning and Development, planning consultants.\nReferences\ncategory:Drill halls in England"
