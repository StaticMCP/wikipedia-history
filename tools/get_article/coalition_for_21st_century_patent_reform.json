They are opposed to various provision of the Patent Reform Act of 2007, including its limitations for damages due to patent infringement, and the \"second window\" post-grant review.\nPrinciples\nThe CFCPR believes that the following principles should drive patent reform\n*\"Provide the USPTO with adequate resources to assure quality examination of all patent applications.\"\n*\"Significantly limit 'subjective elements in patent litigation.  These include the 'inequitable conduct' defense to a patent's enforceability, awarding punitive damages based upon 'willful infringement', and the 'best mode requirement.\"\n*\"Enact the NAS-recommended harmonizing changes to the U.S. patent laws, i.e., adopt the first-inventor-to-file principle and eliminate the \"best mode\" requirement.\"\n*\"Provide an \"open review\" (post-grant opposition) procedure that facilitates challenging questionable patents in the USPTO.\"\nMembership\nThe membership of the Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform includes nearly 50 companies from 19 different industries, including:\n*3M\n*Caterpillar Inc.\n*Eli Lilly and Company\n*General Electric\n*Johnson & Johnson\n*Procter & Gamble\nSteering committee\n* Steven Miller, Procter & Gamble Vice President and General Counsel Intellectual Property\n* Gary Griswald, 3M\nSee also\n* Coalition for Patent Fairness who were strongly in favor of the Patent Reform Act of 2007 and its successors\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.patentsmatter.com/index.php Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform web site]"
