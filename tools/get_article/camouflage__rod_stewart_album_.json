Records. The four singles from the album were \"Infatuation\", \"Trouble\", a cover of The Persuaders hit  \"Some Guys Have All the Luck\", and a cover of the Free hit, \"All Right Now\". The album marked a reunion of sorts between Stewart and Jeff Beck, who plays guitar on several tracks, as the two had been members of the influential 1960s group The Jeff Beck Group.\nAlbum information\nAll the tracks were recorded at Lion Share Studio in Los Angeles, California. Grammy Award-winning producer Michael Omartian produced all the songs except \"Bad for You\", which was self-produced by Stewart. In the liner notes, a disclaimer alludes to the reason behind this (specifically mentioning that Omartian was recently \"born again\").\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = Record Mirror\n|rev2score =\n|rev3 = The Rolling Stone Album Guide\n|rev3score =\n| rev4 = Sounds\n| rev4Score =\n}}\nThe album received similar reviews to its predecessor, Body Wishes, although Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic retrospectively called it \"relatively better\", due to a couple of strong singles in \"Infatuation\" and \"Some Guys Have All the Luck\". A review was not given in Rolling Stone magazine, but in the review for the album's successor, Every Beat of My Heart, they called the album \"overly slick\".\nTrack listing\n# \"Infatuation\" (Rod Stewart, Duane Hitchings, Rowland Robinson) – 5:13\n# \"All Right Now\" (Andy Fraser, Paul Rodgers) – 4:41\n# \"Some Guys Have All the Luck\" (Jeff Fortang ) – 4:33\n# \"Can We Still Be Friends\" (Todd Rundgren) – 3:46\n# \"Bad for You\" (Stewart, Kevin Savigar, Jim Cregan) – 5:17\n# \"Heart Is on the Line\" (Stewart, Jay Davis) – 4:02\n# \"Camouflage\" (Stewart, Savigar, Michael Omartian) – 5:19\n# \"Trouble\" (Stewart, Omartian) – 4:42\nPersonnel\n* Rod Stewart – vocals\n* Kevin Savigar – keyboards\n* Michael Omartian – keyboards, percussion, backing vocals, horn arrangements\n* Jeff Beck – guitar solo (1, 4, 5)\n* Jim Cregan – guitars\n* Michael Landau – guitars\n* Robin Le Mesurier – guitars\n* Jay Davis – bass\n* Tony Brock – drums\n* Jimmy Zavala – harmonica\n* Gary Herbig – saxophone solos\n* Kim Hutchcroft – horns\n* Charlie Loper – horns\n* Chuck Findley – horns\n* Gary Grant – horns\n* Jerry Hey – horns\nProduction\n* Michael Omartian – producer (1–4, 6–8)\n* Rod Stewart – producer (5)\n* John Guess – engineer, mixing\n* Tom Fouce – second engineer\n* Steve Hall – mastering at Future Disc (Hollywood, California)\n* Jeff Ayeroff – art direction\n* Paula Greif – art direction\n* Michael Hodgson – art direction, design\n* Steven Meisel – cover photography\n* Arnold Stiefel – management\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for Camouflage\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1984)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n| 34\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+1984 year-end chart performance for Camouflage\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1984)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n| 55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums (OCC)\n| 97\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200\n| 87\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.rodstewartfanclub.com/about_rod/disco/album_detail.php?album_id=8 Rod Stewart fan club album detail]"
