Each season culminates with an awards ceremony.\nThe Barrymore Awards was founded by the Performing Arts League of Philadelphia (PALP) in 1994 and was named after the Barrymore family. PALP was renamed the Theatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia in 1997 and presided over the awards until 2012. Theatre Philadelphia has handled the awards since 2012.\nHistory\nTheatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia (1994–2012)\nNamed in honor of the famed American theatrical family, the Barrymore family, the Barrymore Awards for Excellence in Theatre have served as Philadelphia's professional theatre awards program since the 1994–1995 season. It was founded by the Performing Arts League of Philadelphia (PALP) in September 1994. PALP was renamed the Theatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia in 1997. The group used the Helen Hayes Awards (Washington, D.C.) and Joseph Jefferson Awards (Chicago) as guidelines in devising the structure of the Barrymore Awards. The program cost $95,000 in its first year. In 1995, there were 40 members of the nominating committee.\nThe awards ceremony was held at the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts for the first two years in 1995 and 1996, the Walnut Street Theatre in 1997 and 1998. and the Irvine Auditorium starting in 1999. The awards ceremony moved to the Independence Seaport Museum in 2001, and it returned to the Annenberg Center in 2002. The ceremony took place at the Academy of Music in 2004, and the Merriam Theater in 2005. The Barrymore Awards moved to Wanamaker's for the 2007 ceremony. The ceremony was held at the Walnut Street Theatre in 2009 in honor of the theatre's 200th season.\nIn December 1999, the Walnut Street Theatre, the largest theatre in the region, announced it would withdraw from consideration from the Barrymore Awards, in protest for one of their shows being deemed ineligible for an award. By January 2000, the Walnut agreed to rejoin after the Alliance of Greater Philadelphia instituted an appeals process in their system. The appeals process was removed for the 2000–2001 season, and the Walnut again withdrew from consideration from 2003 through 2006, citing a perceived bias against the theatre by nominators. The Media Theatre also withdrew during the 2002–2003 season, its first season submitting shows for consideration, but returned for the 2002–2003 season. The Walnut Street Theatre began submitting again for consideration in 2007.\nThe Theatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia folded on June 30, 2012, due to funding issues. It still announced nominations for the Barrymore Awards for the 2011–2012 season in August 2012. Many of the 2011–2012 awards were announced via email in September, with the top three awards (the lifetime achievement award, Brown Martin Philadelphia Award, and F. Otto Haas Award) given at the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, at an event called \"Theatre Philadelphia: A Celebration\" in October 2012.\nTheatre Philadelphia (2013–present)\nBy November 2013, 11 theatre administrators and artistic directors formed Theatre Philadelphia to replace the Theatre Alliance of Greater Philadelphia. The awards with cash prizes attached to them were handed out for the 2012–2013 season, with category-specific awards resuming for the 2013–2014 season.\nThe first full awards ceremony under Theatre Philadelphia in 2014 was held at the Merriam Theater. The awards moved to the Bok Building for 2018. The Media Theatre and Walnut Street Theatre did not submit for consideration starting with the 2014 awards. Media returned and submitted a show for the 2017–2018 season.\nIn June 2018, Theatre Philadelphia announced the removal of gender identifiers from performance categories. In 2018, the awards included an adjudication of twenty-four categories, including five cash awards totaling up to $118,000 for artists and organizations each year.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, a Barrymore Awards ceremony was not held from 2020 to 2022. It returned in 2023.\nNotable awardees\nOutstanding Production of a New Play\n* 1995: Master Class (Philadelphia Theatre Company, Terrence McNally)\n* 1999: The Chosen (Arden Theatre Company)\n* 2002: Yellowman (Wilma Theater)\n* 2006: Opus (Arden Theatre Company, Michael Hollinger)\nOutstanding Direction of a Play\n* 1995: Blanka Zizka (Road, Wilma Theater)\n* 1998: Aaron Posner (''A Midsummer Night's Dream, Arden Theatre Company)\n* 2000: Blanka Zizka (The Invention of Love, Wilma Theater)\n* 2004: Blanka Zizka (Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train, Wilma Theater)\n* 2005: Maria Mileaf (The Story, Philadelphia Theatre Company)\n* 2006: Terrence J.
