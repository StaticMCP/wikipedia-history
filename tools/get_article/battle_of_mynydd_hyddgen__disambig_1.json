And fifteen hundred men from the lowland of Ceredigion and Rhos and Pembroke assembled there and they came to the mountain to try to capture Owain. And on Hyddgant Mountain was the encounter between them, and as soon as the English host turned their backs to flee, two hundred of them were killed. And then great praise came to Owain, and there rose up with him a great part of the youth and the wicked men from every region of Wales until there was a great host with him.\"\nSome historians have raised doubts as to whether this battle happened as per the above account, noting the lack of corroborative evidence in muster roles, records of payments or other accounts. Yet Historians agree that this battle explains a deterioration in the security situation in Wales, and the sudden change of posture from Henry IV towards the rebellion, lending credence to a significant victory for Glyndŵr.\nArmies\nThe English forces comprised Anglo-Fleming settlers from West Wales. The settler lands had previously been pillaged by Glyndŵr, so the force gathered to oppose Glyndŵr in his Mid Wales stronghold. The settlers were reinforced by a large force of English soldiers and Flemish mercenaries. Historians have doubted the relative size of the forces of ten to one, although there would have been several hundred in the Anglo-Flemish force. Alternatively, the author and antiquarian, Thomas Owen Morgan, proposed that the 120 in Glyndŵr's forces were supplemented by archers at a typical rate at the time of three to one, giving approaching 500 on his side. This number has been adopted by some later accounts. In any case, Glyndŵr is described as heavily outnumbered. Writers following Morgan's thesis, propose Glyndŵr's force would have been made up mostly of archers mounted on hill ponies that would have been well suited for travelling across boggy or mountainous regions.\nThe Anglo-Flemish army meanwhile would have probably consisted of infantry with some light cavalrymen supporting them. Despite having decent equipment, the English-Flemish soldiers lacked military experience, and their rout may suggest a general lack of discipline within their army, although an alternative proposal is that they succumbed to a flanking tactic.\nLocation\nThe precise location of the battle is not known, and little is known of the course of the battle. Mynydd Hyddgen lies between the Hyddgen and Hengwm rivers in the Ceredigion uplands of Elenydd. The rivers meet at the southern end of the mountain ( means \"mountain\" in Welsh). One tradition places the battle close to the Hyddgen river, and associated with two white quartz blocks on the opposing bank, to the south of the summit, known as ''Glyndŵr's Covenant Stones''. A battle at the summit is also possible, but across the Hyddgen river from the Covenant Stones lies an exposed knee of rock, . A spring creates a natural draw up this slope, and a commanding view across both river valleys and unimpeded sight lines across the Elenydd uplands to the south. The attack came from the south, and as the location is strategically superior to the alternatives, and in sight of the Covenant Stones, this has also become a proposed location of the battle.\nBattle\nThere is no detailed account of the battle. It is known that Glyndŵr's army was able to fight back these attackers (despite being outnumbered and on the low ground), killing 200, chasing the main force away and taking prisoners from the rest. Owain's success may have laid in the maneuverability of his light troops. The English army (being more heavily laden) would have had more trouble traversing the marshy ground of the valley, and Glyndŵr's forces had ponies able to do so.\nAnother theory is proposed by historian Michael Livingston. He surveyed the proposed battle location of Banc Lluestnewydd and observed a flat area about the size of a sports pitch that lies out of sight from the land below, and on which a reserve force might be concealed. Noting Glyndŵr's known tactics in other battles, and his familiarity with the location, Livingston posits that Glyndŵr may have allowed half his forces to be seen on the low land, perhaps near the covenant stones, and this force allowed themselves to be pursued up Banc Lluestnewydd. This would account for the historical association of the stones with this battle. The exposed rocks of Banc Lluestnewydd create a natural rampart, and required the pursuit to follow the force, and not encircle them. Then, the reserve force would be able to reveal themselves and close the trap, encircling the English attackers.\nAftermath\nThis first major victory for Glyndŵr prompted Henry IV to at last take the Welsh Revolt seriously. On 18 September he sent out calls to raise an army at Worcester, seeing the Welsh threat as a clear and present danger. This army then entered Wales to engage with Glyndŵr. Meanwhile the victory gave the rebellion new impetus, and allowed Glyndŵr to move south. He made his way to the Tywi valley, where he was \"enthusiastically received\". Henry was unable to bring the rebellion to a swift end, failing to engage in more than skirmishes until November saw them engage at Caernarfon in the indecisive Battle of Tuthill. Glyndŵr was also able to open negotiations with the French, Scots and Irish. The Welsh Revolt was not finally brought to an effective end until 1409, and Glyndŵr was never captured.\nMemorial\nIn 1977 a memorial was erected and unveiled at the Nant y Moch reservoir dam to commemorate the battle and to remember those killed. The memorial was unveiled by Gwynfor Evans, Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire and then president of Plaid Cymru.\nFile:Banc Lluestnewydd.jpg|The natural rock rampart at Banc Lluestnewydd\nFile:Banc Lluestnewydd looking south.jpg|The view south from Banc Lluestnewydd\nFile:View South from Banc Lluestnewydd.jpg|The view south from the foot of Banc Lluestnewydd\nFile:Carn Gwilym, Mynydd Hyddgen.jpg|Carn Gwilym on the summit of Mynydd Hyddgen\nNotes\nReferences\n-->\n}}\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
