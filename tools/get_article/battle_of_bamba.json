A raid in retribution the following day killed JNIM leader Abu Yahya al-Jizari.\nBattle\nPrior to the battle, residents of Bamba stated JNIM militants were riding around the town on motorbikes, and setting up positions in preparation for the attack. The attack was launched at 5:15am on April 6, with the fighters attacking an old inn that Malian troops were using as a military base. After destroying and seizing equipment from the base, the jihadists retreated. The attack was claimed four days later, on April 10, by JNIM.\nCasualties and aftermath\nOn the day of the attack, local elected officials stated that at least twenty Malian soldiers were killed in the attack. Both civilians and the elected officials stated that JNIM only targeted the Malian base, and no civilians were harmed. In the following days, after Malian operations to recover bodies and the captured weaponry, it was assessed that 25 Malian troops were killed and six wounded, with around a dozen JNIM fighters sustaining casualties during the battle. JNIM claimed in its statement admitting its involvement in the attack that around 30 Malian troops were killed.\nIn late April, it was reported that Abu Yahya al-Jizari, the leader of JNIM and commander in the battle at Bamba, succumbed to injuries sustained during combat in Bamba. He was later replaced by Talha al-Libi.\nReferences"
