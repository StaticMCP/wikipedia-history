The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado.\nSeason nine stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Gordon Thomson as Blake and Alexis' eldest son Adam; Heather Locklear as Krystle's niece Sammy Jo; Michael Nader as Alexis's husband Dex Dexter;  Emma Samms as Blake and Alexis' daughter Fallon; John James as Fallon's ex-husband Jeff Colby; Leann Hunley as Adam's wife Dana; Stephanie Beacham as Alexis' cousin Sable Colby; Tracy Scoggins as Sable's daughter Monica; and Joan Collins as Alexis Colby, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Adam, Fallon, Steven, and Amanda.\nDevelopment\nDavid Paulsen joined Dynasty as Executive Supervising Producer for its ninth season, and took over the plotting of the series. In a money-saving move, Evans appeared in only six episodes early in the season as an ailing Krystle seeks brain surgery in Switzerland but is left in an offscreen coma. Similarly to cut costs, Collins was contracted for only 13 out of the season's 22 episodes.

Iger cancelled Dynasty, making the last episode of season nine the series finale.
