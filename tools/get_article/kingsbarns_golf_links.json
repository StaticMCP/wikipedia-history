It opened in 2000 and has been rated as one of the best courses in Scotland. It has also been ranked as one of the top 100 courses in the world, and received numerous media and industry awards.\nThe course was designed by Kyle Phillips and the original developers were Mark Parsinen (1948-2019) and Art Dunkley.

The Kingsbarns Golfing Society was established in 1815 and its members played on the original 9-hole Kingsbarns course until it closed in 1850.\nThe course was re-established in 1922 and the golfing society was reformed as Kingsbarns Golf Club which remains in existence today. Willie Auchterlonie laid out the course in 1922 which closed again at the onset of the Second World War. Land mines were installed on the course site as part of the national security defence effort and the ground reverted to rough pasture.\nConstruction of the current Kingsbarns Golf Links began in November 1997 under the direction of architect Kyle Phillips and the course opened in July 2000. The course has no membership and welcomes visitors.\nTournaments hosted\nRicoh Women's British Open\nIn 2017, the Ricoh Women’s British Open was held at Kingsbarns Golf Links; the winner was South Korean In-Kyung Kim.\nAlfred Dunhill Links Championship\nThe Alfred Dunhill Links Championship is played over three courses – the Old Course at St Andrews, the Championship Course, Carnoustie Golf Links and Kingsbarns Golf Links.
