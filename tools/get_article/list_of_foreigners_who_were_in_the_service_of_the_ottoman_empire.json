This may be militarily, as a diplomat, a spy, or any other way. Foreigners employed by the Sublime Porte were often renegades, slaves and refugees. They were diverse in their ethnic origins, generally hailing from aristocratic families.\nItalian historian Giancarlo Casale posits that it was the ability of the Ottomans to \"accommodate diversity\" and \"embrace it fully as their own\" which attracted foreigners to the country. Those who converted to Islam in general, but especially while in the service of the Ottoman state, were considered by Christendom to have 'turned Turk'.\nThe increased prevalence of foreign military officers in the Ottoman Empire after the mid-1800s is owed to the fact that non-Muslims were no longer required to convert to Islam to serve in the Ottoman army after the passing of the 1856 Reform Edict. However, there are numerous notable cases before the Edict where conversion to Islam was not required. An example is Sinan 'The Great Jew', regarded as the right-hand man of famed Grand Admiral, Hayreddin Barbarossa.\nby Johann Theodor de Bry, 1590s]]\nList of notables\nThis is a list of noteworthy foreigners who were in the service of the Ottoman Empire.
