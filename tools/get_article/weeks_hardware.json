The ceiling is high, made of elaborately patterned tin and in need of paint. The freight elevator in the back of the store is powered by hand.\nA tall, darkly stained plywood case that holds bolts and screws in its dozens of drawers, was built, according to a little brass label on one corner, by A.R. Brown on May 7, 1901.\nThe founder's grandson, Joseph C. Weeks, worked in the store since childhood, and took over the business after returning from naval service and graduating from the University of Florida. Mr. Weeks, aged 82, was honored by the Brooksville City Council as \"the 2009 Great Brooksvillian.\"\nThe building was owned by John Weeks, the first President of the First Federal Bank.\nThe historic J.M. Rogers Department Store built in 1912 is located across the street at 120 North Main.\nWeeks House\nThe Weeks House is a historic home at 118 South Brooksville Avenue. It was built circa 1900 and was the original home of the founder of Weeks Hardware.\nOld Weeks House\nThe Old Weeks House is a historic residence at 122 West Fort Dade.
