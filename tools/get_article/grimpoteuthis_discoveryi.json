It was described in 2003, but specimens have been found as early as 1910. The type species was found at  49°35'N, 14°01'W.\nDescription\nAt maximum, Grimpoteuthis discoveryi's mantle is 58 millimeters in length, and its body in total reaches 370 millimeters.\nIts arms are long. G. discoveryi, like other cirrates, has a web covering its arms to some degree; this species' web reaches 2/3 of its arm length.  The suckers on its arms number between 56 and 61. The suckers of female specimens are smaller than the suckers of males, and are also differently shaped. The range in mantle size are larger in females (32-58mm) than males (25-52mm). The [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554399/ posterior salivary glands] and radula are both absent in this species, however, its [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554399/ anterior salivary glands] are present. The species' body is white, and its eyes are dark grey or black when preserved. It's possible that G. discoveryi is actually two separate species.\nHabitat and population\nThis species has been found in the bathyal zone (also called the midnight zone), specifically from 2,600 to 4,870 meters below the surface. It lives in the Porcupine Seabight of the northeast Atlantic Ocean. G. discoveryi may be a demersal species, occupying both rocky and soft seafloor. While its population is unknown, the species is classified as Least Concern because it lives at such depths, where human activity is unlikely to affect it.\nExternal links\n[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Distribution-of-Grimpoteuthis-discoveryi-in-bottom-trawl-stations_fig10_233313510 A map of the mid-Atlantic ridge showing where specimens have been found]\nReferences\n}}"
