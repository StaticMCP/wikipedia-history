The ideas he portrayed, such as crowdsourcing of ideas, utilization of available lower-cost design and manufacturing tools, and reviewing options to outsource capital-intensive manufacturing were highlighted in the February 2010 Harvard Business Review article, \"From Do It Yourself to Do It Together\".\nOverview\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/07/makers-chris-anderson-review Review in The Guardian]\n*[http://www.thelongtail.com/ Chris Anderson's blog]\n*"
