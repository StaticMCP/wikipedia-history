In the , Tallebudgera had a population of 3,826 people.\nGeography\nTallebudgera Creek forms a part of the western and eastern border of Tallebudgera.\nHistory\nThe traditional owners were the Tulgigin clan of Australian Aboriginals, but in the 2011 Census, Indigenous Australians accounted for just 0.9% of the population of Tallebudgera (around one third of the national average of 2.5%).\nThe village was originally called Maybree, perhaps after the name of a tree that grew locally, while Tallebudgera was the name of the creek and was an Aboriginal word meaning good fish. Another theory is that the name refers to a property called \"Mayberry\" owned by pioneers Stephen Tobin and his wife Mary. Tobin was known for his hospitality and it is possible that Mayberry was shortened to Maybree and became well known as a place to stay when travelling through or to Tallebudgera.\nTallebudgera State School opened on 17 October 1877.\nTallebudgera Presbyterian Church was opened in August 1888 by Reverend James Ewen.\nIn 1904, 10,000 acres subdivided in to 36 dairy farms known as \"Tallebudgera and Currumbin Estate\" were advertised for sale by auction by Isles, Love and Co. auctioneers. Blocks from 72 acres up to 557 acres were advertised as available for purchase.\nTallebudgera Upper State School opened in 1923 and closed circa 1942. It was on the western side of Tallebudgera Creek Road (approx ), now within Tallebudgera Valley.\nSt Andrew's Lutheran College opened in 1993.\nDemographics\nIn the , Tallebudgera had a population of 3,667 people.\nIn the , Tallebudgera had a population of 3,826 people.\nHeritage listings\nTallebudgera has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* 17 Trees Road: former Tallebudgera Post Office\nWhile not heritage listed, the single lane Coplicks wooden bridge which crossed Tallebudgera Creek along Tallebudgera Connection Road was a visible sign of the rural nature of the valley. Up until the 1980s, this bridge was the only crossing of the creek along Tallebudgera Connection Road and being one way, drivers had to give way to everyone heading north. The road has now been upgraded with a large 2 lane bridge. The old timber bridge remained until June 2019 when it was replaced with a concrete structure due to safety concerns, much to the disappointment of local residents. The bridge can be accessed from Scotty Logan Lane.\nEducation\nTallebudgera State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at 492 Guineas Creek Road ().
