The station had been constructed by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in the hope that the area would attract residential development, but this did not happen. The LSWR had purchased an area of land far larger than that what was actually used, as they hoped to construct a large station and goods yard. A primitive halt with a single platform opened some months after the line's opening, consisting merely of a nameboard, noticeboard, lamp and seat.\nDeclining passenger traffic and reduced military activities at Bordon after the Second World War saw the line's closure to regular services in 1957. Kingsley Halt was demolished soon after closure, and nothing now remains except the shape of the trackbed, now used as a farm track.\nSee also\n* List of closed railway stations in Britain\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.subbrit.org.uk/sb-sites/stations/k/kingsley_halt/index.shtml Kingsley Halt on Subterranea Britannica]"
