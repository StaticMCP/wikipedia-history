In the story, Issaqueena and her lover either die together or they land on a ledge out of sight of hostile tribesmen and eventually live happily ever after.\nThe waterfall is close to another notable local landmark, Stumphouse Tunnel, and a park provides access to both.\nSee also\n* List of waterfalls\nReferences"
