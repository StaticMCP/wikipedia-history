He and his girlfriend Lisa Prince (Kiele Sanchez) struggle with keeping their gym, Navy St. financially stable, while Alvie's youngest son Nate (Nick Jonas) prepares for an upcoming fight. Nate goes home where he lives with his brother and Alvey's oldest son Jay (Jonathan Tucker), who has a drug and alcohol problem. Jay used to fight but let his addictions get in the way. Meanwhile, Lisa's ex-fiance Ryan Wheeler (Matt Lauria) is released on parole from prison and is sent to a halfway house. He used to be an excellent fighter until he was arrested and imprisoned for four years. Alvey knows how good Ryan is and how having Ryan as a fighter for his gym can earn him good publicity, so he goes to give him a proposition about fighting again, something that Ryan is reluctant on. Nate has his first fight and wins, his opponent is played by Current UFC Featherweight contender Cub Swanson. On his way home from the fight he is jumped by two thugs that Alvey had beat up out of self defense earlier that week.

The family reels at the news of Nate's attack and Alvey wants answers as to who would do this to his son. Nate says he doesn't remember anything that happened or who jumped him, but that's not the truth. He is left with a huge scar on his head and is left to do physical therapy. He is told that he can start fighting inside six months if everything goes well. Mac (Mac Brandt), Alvey’s HGH supplier, shows up at the gym to train and to also set up Nate with pain killers.

His roommate Keith tells him when he was 10 years old, his father murdered his mother with a hammer before shooting himself in the backyard. Alvey goes to meet with Ryan's parole officer to try to get him out of killing rats and to get a job at the gym so he can start training. Much to his dismay, Ryan's parole officer declines Alvey's request and says that killing rats is a better job than working at a gym where he might get angry which is what put him in jail in the first place. Nate begins physical therapy with Tatiana (Meaghan Rath), a young physical therapist that is attracted to Nate. Jay goes to visit his mother, Christina (Joanna Going) while she's working as a hooker on the streets. He gives her money and tries to get her to come have dinner with her but she refuses. Lisa bails Jay out of jail and he goes to pay Christina's pimp, Terry (Jamie Harris) a visit. He \"buys\" his mom for the night, not letting Terry know that he's her son. Jay gives her a phone with his number programmed into a speed dial, and he tells her to call if she ever needs help. By the end of the night, she calls Jay to meet him for lunch. She apologizes for her reaction to him showing up the other night, not wanting him to see her like that.

He also puts bars on his bedroom window. Jay then meets his mother for lunch, where she admits that she needs to change her life. Jay offers his place for her to stay out while she figures things out but she declines, to have her stay with him and Nate, she thinks about moving somewhere else to get a clean slate. It’s just an idea she had. When they walk out to his car, he puts Christina in a sleeper hold, ties her hands together and put her in his trunk. He brings her back to his house and places her in the room with the newly acquired door and locks her in there, effectively forcing her into detox. He goes to her apartment to get her some of her clothes and runs into Terry. Jay takes Terry's gun from him, takes off his shirt and beats Terry, also hurting his right hand. Lisa starts making calls to try to get Jay the fight she promised him. She finally gets in touch with Bucky DeMarco (Jamie Kennedy), a promoter who's willing to take a chance on Jay.

At the lunch, her father says that Alvey is too old for Lisa, questions what they would do if she wants to have kids when Alvey doesn't. Nate and Tatiana start sleeping together, but is resistant to letting her get too close, he also blows her off the next night to keep an eye on his mother who is still locked in Jay's room. There is a photographer at the gym to get a look at Navy St., and he was told by Lisa to not get in Ryan's face which is exactly what he does. Ryan starts to get angry and threatens the photographer. Alvey puts Jay in the ring with Ryan, just to see how well they do together and notices that Jay isn't throwing his right hand. Jay's plan is to get through the fight then claim he hurt his hand in the fight, therefore making Bucky pay for it. By the time the fight happens, Jay gets beaten badly in but somehow comes back and gets his opponent in a submission and chokes him unconscious to win the fight. Bucky is notorious for not paying his fighters so Lisa steals a wheel off of Bucky’s car in exchange for the $700 he owes Jay.\n|LineColor= 000000\n}}\n|ShortSummary= Lisa goes with Ryan to visit his parents for the first time since he was released from prison.
