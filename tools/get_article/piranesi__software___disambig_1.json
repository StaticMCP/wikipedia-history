For every pixel, additional information is stored, such as distance from the viewer and material settings. EPix files can be rendered from 3D scenes using a fixed viewpoint by Piranesi's companion software, Vedute.\nSee also\n* Matte painting\nExternal links\n* [http://www.piranesi.co.uk/downloads/literature/beyond_photorealism_white_paper.pdf Beyond Photorealism] - White paper describing the idea behind the software written by one of the software's original authors.\nReferences"
