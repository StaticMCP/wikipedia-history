There was above-normal activity during the season,|group=\"nb\"}} with nearly all its activity occurring during a three-month period, August–October. The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2000 and ended on November&nbsp;30, 2000. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical systems form. Although two tropical depressions formed in June, the first named storm, Alberto, did not arise until August&nbsp;4. The season's final storm, an unnamed subtropical storm, became extratropical on October&nbsp;29.\nThe 2000 season produced 15&nbsp;cyclones of at least tropical (14) or subtropical (1) storm strength. Four of the tropical storms became hurricanes, of which three developed into major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} There were also four depressions that failed to reach tropical storm strength. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of loss of life and damage, were Hurricanes Gordon and Keith. Gordon made land fall in the eastern Yucatán Peninsula, traversed the Gulf of Mexico, and made landfall along the Gulf Coast of the United States. Keith made landfall in Belize, crossed the Yucatán, moved over the Gulf, and made landfall in northeastern Mexico. Following the 2000 season, the name Keith was retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC). In this time line, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective local time included in parentheses.\nTimeline\nJune\nJune 1\n* The 2000 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nJune 7\n* 21:00&nbsp;UTC (4:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT) near Tropical Depression One develops in the southern Gulf of Mexico roughly 450&nbsp;mi (720&nbsp;km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas and simultaneously attains its peak intensity with winds of 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1008&nbsp;mbar (hPa;
