It was fought between the Duchy of Greater Poland led by Bolesław the Pious and the Duchy of Pomerelia led by prince Mestwin II against the Margraviate of Brandenburg led by Otto IV. It resulted in a Polish victory.\nPrelude\nThe Polish had lost Santok and Drzeń to the Margraviate of Brandenburg in the early 70s of the 13th century. These were two important border towns, so recovering them was a priority for Bolesław.\nTaking advantage of the involvement of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in other areas, primarily in the rivalry between the Habsburgs and the Přemyslids in the Reich, Bolesław, aided by the troops of the Duchy of Pomerelia prince Mestwin II, attacked and devastated the disputed areas on the Noteć.\nBattle\nIn the battle, Polish troops defeated the troops of Otto IV.\nAftermath\n]]\nAfter the battle, Otto IV's troops went to Gorzów, sheltering behind the city walls. Following the victorious expedition, Santok was reclaimed.\nLegacy\nIt was Bolesław the Pious's last ever campaign before his death a year later.\nThe Battle of Myślibórz is also confirmed to have happened by local tradition preserved in the history of the city from 1732.\nSee also\n* List of wars involving Poland\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Edward Rymar: The Warta River Historical and Archival Yearbook (nr. 21), p. 65–72, 2014."
