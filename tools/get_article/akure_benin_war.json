The origins of this conflict can be traced to the complex history of the region, with Akure being a place of ancient settlements, some dating back to the early Ife kingdom. The Akure Kingdom emerged when these communities were consolidated under the rule of Prince Omoremilekun, who was a descendant of Oduduwa, a revered figure in Yoruba history. Historically, the relationship between Benin and Akure had been marked by peace and mutual respect due to shared cultural heritage and ancestry.\nHowever, this harmony was disrupted when Chief Osague, a Benin emissary, was killed by the Deji of Akure, Arakale. This incident, along with other conflicts and provocations, triggered the Benin invasion of Akure. The invasion involved military manoeuvres, with the Benin army led by Chief Erebo the Ezomo, General Ologbosere the Ologbosere, and the Imaran. They encountered resistance from the Akure army, led by the Deji himself. The Benin army strategically advanced through various routes, eventually capturing Akure after the destruction of the Deji's palace. This victory led to the establishment of Akure as a vassal state under Benin's control.\nThe consequences of the war were profound. For Akure, it marked a defeat, resulting in the loss of independence and submission to Benin's rule. The Deji of Akure had to pledge allegiance to the Oba of Benin, Osemwende, and pay tribute. In contrast, for Benin, the war demonstrated its power and expanded its territorial influence, with the Oba amassing greater wealth through tribute and plunder. The conflict had a lasting impact on the history and culture of both Akure and Benin, commemorated through various means, including oral traditions, festivals, monuments, and art.\nBackground\nThe Akure Kingdom, with its origins linked to the revered figure of Oduduwa, was established by Omoremilekun, a prince from Ile-Ife and a skilled elephant hunter. His journey led to the unification of various autonomous communities in the region, culminating in his crowning as the first Ajapada of Akure. The kingdom's early history was marked by resistance to centralised rule, similar to the early Ife kingdom, but Omoremilekun's leadership brought stability and unity, establishing a royal dynasty that would last for centuries.\nRelations between the Akure Kingdom and the Benin Empire were historically peaceful, rooted in shared cultural heritage and common ancestry. Akure acknowledged the authority of the Oba of Benin, with tributes and reverence, while the Oba maintained friendly relations through envoys and gifts. This harmony was disrupted by an incident that led to the Akure–Benin War, highlighting the delicate balance of power and respect between the two kingdoms.\nCauses\nThe Akure–Benin War of 1818 erupted from a cascade of events that began with the assassination of a Benin diplomat and escalated with subsequent violent acts. Chief Osague, an esteemed member from the Iwebo Chancellery of the Benin Palace, was dispatched to Akure in 1818 with the Chalk of Good Tidings, signifying Oba Osemwende's ascension in 1816.}} The Deji of Akure, Arakale, envious of Chief Osague's attire, instigated a confrontation resulting in Osague's death.\nOther accounts suggest Chief Osague's mission was punitive, tasked with disciplining Akure for appointing a Deji without Benin's consent. Concurrently, a Benin merchant named Ogonto was assaulted in Akure's market, sparking riots that led to the death of several Bini individuals. A similar event at Igbara-Odo resulted in the massacre of many Bini and the destruction of their property.\nAdorned in the regalia befitting a Benin chief, Chief Osague, accompanied by his entourage, presented the Chalk of Good Tidings to Arakale, who coveted Osague's coral bead regalia. A dispute later arose in Akure between one of Chief Osague's wives and a local tobacco seller, a conflict Arakale had incited, which escalated into a brawl. In the ensuing melee, as Chief Osague attempted to defend his wife, he was slain. Arakale then claimed Chief Osague's coral beads for himself. The news of these events reached Benin City, reporting the murder of the Oba's emissary. This incited Osemwende to declare a punitive expedition to avenge his emissary's death and subjugate Akure.\nCourse\nThe punitive expedition was orchestrated by a cadre of Benin's military elite, comprising three war commanders and two front commanders, each overseeing distinct contingents and strategic routes. The esteemed positions of Ezomo, Ologbosere, and Imaran were held by Erebor, General Ologbosere, and a valiant warrior respectively, signifying their high military ranks within the Benin hierarchy. Imadiyi and Oyodo, as front commanders, played pivotal roles in the campaign.\nAs the Benin forces advanced, they encountered staunch resistance from the Akure army, led by the Deji himself. The Benin commanders, employing strategic maneuvers through various routes, converged upon Akure. Their military campaign was marked by attacks on Akure, Ilawe, and Igara-Odo, driving these regions northwards along with the towns of Ewi. The success of the Benin military operation was attributed to a strategic encirclement, countering Akure's preparations for defense against any threats from Benin.\nThe Benin military launched an assault and successfully captured the town. The Deji of Akure, Arakale, was apprehended, executed, and his son, Adésọ́rọ̀ (Osupa), was taken prisoner to Benin. This decisive action by the Benin forces quelled the rebellion in Akure. They took numerous captives and seized cattle and valuables, imposing a heavy annual tribute on Akure, consisting of three slaves, as well as ivories and corals, all payable to the Oba of Benin. Consequently, Akure was relegated to a vassal state under Benin, marking a significant loss of its independence and stature.\nConsequences\nThe aftermath of the conflict had profound and lasting effects on Akure and Benin. In Akure, the war culminated in a crushing defeat, stripping away its autonomy and prosperity. The town fell under Benin's dominion, leading to a period of subjugation and humiliation. The Deji was coerced into swearing fealty to the Oba of Benin, committing to a regular tribute and acts of homage.\nFor Benin, the war was a demonstration of its military might and reaffirmed its status as a formidable power. The Oba's influence extended over Akure and the surrounding territories, enhancing Benin's control over the region. The Oba solidified his supremacy, amassing wealth and resources through the tributes and spoils collected from Akure.\nThe victory in the war was bolstered by additional support from allied forces, including troops and supplies from the Ikerres in eastern Yorubaland and the Esan chiefdom of Irrua. The Onojie of Uromi's assistance during the conflict was acknowledged by the Oba of Benin, who granted him the right to inherit the belongings of childless individuals in Uromi. Following Akure's reconquest, the Benin army's leading commanders, Imadiyi and Oyodo, established a strategic base at Otun, facilitating further military operations in the Ekiti region and other eastern Yorubaland areas. Their conquests brought numerous towns and chiefdoms under Benin's sway, compelling Ekiti princes to acknowledge the Oba's imperial authority through annual tributes.\nLegacy\nIn 1834, years after the Akure conquest, the Oba of Benin released Adésọ́rọ̀, the son of Arakale, from captivity and was then appointed as the Deji of Akure. He assumed the title of Osupa I (Osupa lati Ado wa) and was tasked with safeguarding Benin's interests in the Ekiti region. Notably, a man named Orhuon (Orhuonkedo), (likely the king named \"Osuon\", in Akure history, a son of Oba Ausi), who had proclaimed himself Deji of Akure, committed suicide upon learning of Osupa I's arrival with the Oba's messengers.\nThe conflict left a lasting legacy in the history and culture of both Akure and Benin. It is a testament to its role in shaping their identity and destiny, commemorated through various means, including oral traditions, festivals, monuments, and art. A cannonball at the Benin Museum which may have been used in the destruction of the Deji's palace is recorded by Jacob Egharevba.\nSee also\n* Igala–Benin War\nExplanatory notes and references\nExplanatory notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  |last1=Olugbadehan |first1=Oladipo Joseph |date=2006 |title=Owo: A frontier Yoruba kingdom}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*"
