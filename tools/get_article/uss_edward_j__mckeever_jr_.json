McKeever Jr. performed patrol, minesweeping, towing, and transport duties for the rest of World War I.\nOn 21 May 1919, Edward J. McKeever Jr. was decommissioned and sold to the Wilcox Fertilizer Company of Mystic, Connecticut.\nOn 1 September 1919 the fishing steamer went ashore on Sea Flower Reef near Fishers Island, New York.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
