The film was directed by Peter Berg from a script by brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber and stars Taylor Kitsch, Alexander Skarsgård, Brooklyn Decker, Rihanna in her feature film debut, Tadanobu Asano, Hamish Linklater and Liam Neeson. Filming took place in Hawaii and on . In the film, the crews of a small group of warships are forced to battle against a naval fleet of extraterrestrial origin in order to thwart their destructive goals.\nBattleship premiered in Tokyo on April 3, 2012, and was released by Universal Pictures in the United States on May 18, 2012. The film received generally negative reviews and underperformed at the box-office, grossing $303 million worldwide against a production budget of $209–220 million, losing both Universal and Hasbro $150 million.\nPlot\nIn 2005, potentially habitable \"Planet G\" is discovered, and in 2006, a communications array to reach any extraterrestrial life is built in Oahu. There, a slacking Alex Hopper is arrested while attempting to impress  Samantha \"Sam\" Shane, daughter of Admiral Terrance Shane. Alex’s brother, Commander Stone Hopper, furiously forces Alex to join the U.S. Navy.\nSix years later, Alex is a lieutenant aboard the  and in a relationship with Sam, a physical therapist working with wounded veterans. While Stone is a model officer commanding the , the rebellious Alex, despite showing plenty of potential, is facing a disciplinary discharge.\nDuring the 2012 RIMPAC exercise, five alien spacecraft arrive. Their communications ship hits a satellite and crashes through the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, while the others plunge into the waters off the coast of Hawaii. Sampson, John Paul Jones, and Japanese destroyer JDS  discover a floating structure that generates an impenetrable force field isolating the Hawaiian Islands and the three destroyers from the rest of the world, and jamming all radar and communications inside.\nThree alien warships surface, and first contact devolves into a battle after the humans decide to fire a warning shot across the aliens' bow; Myōkō is destroyed, Sampson is lost with all hands including Stone, and John Paul Jones’ command personnel are killed, leaving Alex to reluctantly take charge as the next highest-ranking sailor on board after the executive officer is also lost. John Paul Jones disengages to recover Myōkō’s survivors, including Captain Yugi Nagata, while alien drones destroy Oahu’s military bases.\nHiking near the communications array, Sam and retired US Army lieutenant colonel and double amputee Mick Canales discover the aliens' presence. They encounter scientist Cal Zapata, who reveals the aliens have taken over the array to re-establish communications with their home planet. The John Paul Jones’ crew captures an alien, which telepathically shows Alex images of alien conflict and planetary destruction.\nMore aliens board and retrieve their comrade while one starts sabotaging the ship. Its armored suit proves impervious to small-arms fire but it is obliterated by the destroyer’s 5-inch gun, and the captured alien's helmet reveals their eyes are sensitive to sunlight. Ashore, Sam, Mick, and Cal recover his spectrum analyzer, using it to radio John Paul Jones that the aliens will contact their planet and most likely call for reinforcements when the facility’s satellite is in position in four hours.\nAs night falls, Hopper realises they have no visibility. Nagata suggests using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tsunami warning buoys around Hawaii to track the warships without radar; this plan works and allows John Paul Jones to destroy two of them. The third proves too elusive, so they lure it into facing east as the sun rises. Alex and Nagata shoot out its bridge windows with sniper rifles, blinding its crew with sunlight and allowing John Paul Jones to destroy it. The destroyer then attempts to target the communications array, but is sunk by drones launched from the alien structure emitting the force field; Alex, Nagata, and several other sailors barely escape.\nThe survivors commandeer the decommissioned World War II battleship  with the aid of retired Navy veterans. The floating structure is revealed to be a giant mothership, but Missouri disables the force field, allowing Admiral Shane to scramble fighter jets from the aircraft carrier . The battleship’s turret carrying the ship’s last shell is disabled, forcing the sailors to carry the shell by hand to the ship's last functioning turret. Sam, Mick, and Cal stall the aliens at the array, where Mick kills an alien soldier. Alex uses the final shell to destroy the array, rendering the Missouri defenseless, but the mothership’s drones are destroyed by Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18 fighter jets, as reinforcements carpet bomb the mothership, eliminating the alien threat.\nAlex is promoted to lieutenant commander and presented with a Silver Star and his brother's posthumous Navy Cross. Admiral Shane promises Alex will soon have a ship of his own, while he is also recommended to become a Navy SEAL. Alex asks him for Sam’s hand in marriage; the admiral initially refuses, but invites Alex to lunch. In a post-credits scene, some people in Scotland are scared off by an alien that emerges from something that fell from the sky.\nCast\n* Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Alex Hopper, a highly spirited but undisciplined U.S. Navy Weapons Officer on .\n* Alexander Skarsgård as Commander Stone Hopper, Alex's older brother, commanding officer of .\n* Rihanna as Gunner's Mate Second Class Cora Raikes, on .\n* Brooklyn Decker as Samantha Shane, a physical therapist and Alex's girlfriend.\n* Tadanobu Asano as Captain Yugi Nagata, JMSDF, Commanding Officer of  and Alex Hopper's rival turned friend.\n* Liam Neeson as Admiral Terrance Shane, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and father of Samantha Shane.\n* Hamish Linklater as Cal Zapata, a scientist working on O'ahu.\n* Jesse Plemons as Boatswain's mate Seaman Jimmy \"Ordy\" Ord, who is sarcastic and doubtful of Alex, on .\n* John Tui as Chief Petty Officer Walter \"Beast\" Lynch, a crew mate of .\n* Joji Yoshida as Chief Engineer Hiroki, a crew mate of JDS Myoko.\n* Gregory D.

Universal at one point considered canceling the film, which would have resulted in a $30 million loss. However, new chairman Adam Fogelson decided the studio would lose less money if they increased the budget of the film instead of outright cancelling it. Filming was set to take place in Australia's Gold Coast in 2010, but changed location due to a lack of Australian government tax incentives and a high estimated budget of $220 million.\nFilming took place in the United States on the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Oahu, as well as on the mainland where they had to film a few apartment scenes in Sherman Oaks, California. A driving scene and a shootout were filmed in Playa del Rey, California. Some scenes were filmed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nFurther filming was done on the decommissioned Iowa-class battleship . Featured in the film were the real-life guided missile destroyers USS Benfold (DDG-65), USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53), and USS Sampson (DDG-102) all of which are active members of the US Navy Pacific Fleet. The JS Myōkō (DDG-175) a  of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force also appeared in the film.\nThe Science & Entertainment Exchange provided science consultation for the film.\nCasting\nJeremy Renner was originally considered for the role of Hopper. In April 2010, it was reported that Taylor Kitsch had been cast as Alex Hopper, Alexander Skarsgård played his brother Stone Hopper, Brooklyn Decker stars as Sam, Hopper's fiancee and Liam Neeson as Admiral Shane, Sam's father and Hopper's superior officer. Barbadian R&B singer Rihanna makes her acting debut in the film, as a sailor. In an interview with GQ, Berg explained how he came up with the idea to cast her. He realized she could act after her appearance on Saturday Night Live. She accepted the role because she wanted \"to do something badass\" and also because it wasn't a role too big for her to play.\nTadanobu Asano has a role in the film as the commander of the Japanese Kongō-class destroyer Myōkō. Double amputee U.S. Army Colonel Gregory Gadson, who had never acted before, plays LTC Mick Canales. He was cast after Berg saw a picture of him in National Geographic.\nThe film marks the reunion between former co-stars Kitsch and Jesse Plemons, who previously worked together on Berg's television series Friday Night Lights. Berg said he loves working with friends and explained he knew how comfortable Kitsch was with Plemons, \"I know that he’s really good for Taylor and he makes Taylor better. So, I wrote that whole part for Jesse.\" He added, \"I never thought of it as a Friday Night Lights reunion. I thought of it as protection, bringing a trusted family member in.\"\nU.S. Navy sailors were used as extras in various parts of this film. Sailors from assorted commands in Navy Region Hawaii assisted with line handling to take  in and out of port for a day of shooting in mid 2010. A few months later, the production team put out a casting call for sailors stationed at various sea commands at Naval Station Mayport, Florida to serve as extras. Sailors were also taken from various ships stationed at Naval Station Mayport, Jacksonville, Florida, namely ,  and  were some of the ships that provided sailors.\nMusic\nDue to his success with the Transformers franchise, composer Steve Jablonsky was chosen to score the official soundtrack. The soundtrack features original compositions from Jablonsky and features rock guitarist Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine. Director Peter Berg stated:\n}}\nRelease\nThe film was originally planned to be released in 2011, but was rescheduled to May 18, 2012, in the United States. The film's world premiere took place in Tokyo on April 3, 2012. The event was attended by director Peter Berg, actors Taylor Kitsch, Brooklyn Decker, Alexander Skarsgård and Rihanna. Later on they initiated a Press Tour visiting Madrid, London and Cartagena de Indias to promote the film.\nHome media\nBattleship was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 20, 2012, in the United Kingdom, and on August 28 in the United States and Canada. Its revenue was $32.4 million. Battleship was released on 4K Blu-Ray on January 17, 2017. It received a novelization written by Peter David.\nReception\nBox office\nBattleship grossed $65.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $237.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $303 million, against a production budget of $209 million. In May 2012, The Hollywood Reporter estimated that Universal would lose $150 million on the film.\nThe film opened in several territories on Wednesday, April 11, 2012, five weeks before its North America release, grossing $7.4 million. Through April 13, the film had earned a three-day total of $25 million. By the end of its opening weekend, it earned $55.2 million from 26 markets, ranking second behind the 3D re-release of Titanic. In its second weekend, it topped the box office outside North America, with $60 million. In South Korea, it achieved the highest-grossing opening day for a non-sequel and the third-highest overall ($2.8 million). In comparison to other Hasbro films, Battleship opening in the United Kingdom (£3.76 million) was behind the first Transformers (£8.72 million), but did better than G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (£1.71 million).\nIn the United States, Battleship grossed $8.8 million on its opening day, with $420,000 from midnight showings. It went on to debut to $25.5 million, finishing in second place behind ''Marvel's The Avengers''.\nCritical response\nRotten Tomatoes reports that 34% of 225 critics gave the film a positive review and an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"It may offer energetic escapism for less demanding filmgoers, but Battleship is too loud, poorly written, and formulaic to justify its expense – and a lot less fun than its source material.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nMegan Lehmann of The Hollywood Reporter thought that the \"impressive visual effects and director Peter Berg's epic set pieces fight against an armada of cinematic clichés and some truly awful dialogue.\" Empire magazine's Nick de Semlyen felt there was a lack of character development and memorable action shots, and sums up his review of the movie in one word: \"Miss.\"\nMany reviews criticized the \"based on a board game\" concept driving the film, although some, such as Jason Di Rosso from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National, claimed the ridiculousness of the setup is \"either sheer joy or pure hell – depending on how seriously you take it\", while de Semlyen \"had to admire [the film's creators] jumping through hoops to engineer a sequence that replicates the board game.\" Several compared the film to Michael Bay's Transformers film series in terms of quality and cinematic style, with Giles Hardie of The Sydney Morning Herald claiming that the movie \"finds the same balance between action-packed imagination and not taking the premise seriously that made Michael Bay's original Transformers such a joyride.\"\nAndrew Harrison of Q magazine called the film \"crushingly stupid\". Film critic Kenneth Turan, in a review written for the Los Angeles Times, also expressed disappointment, criticizing the film's \"humanoid aliens\", stating that they are \"as ungainly as the movie itself, clunking around in awkward, protective suits.\" He called the content \"all very earnest\", but added \"it's not a whole lot of fun\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film one out of four stars, and he commented \"Battleship is all noise and crashing metal, sinking to the shallows of Michael Bay's Armageddon and then digging to the brain-extinction level of the Transformers trilogy.\"\nOther critics were less harsh for Battleship: Writing for Time, Steven James Snyder was somewhat positive because he had low expectations of the film. He wrote, \"The creative team behind this ocean-bound thriller decided to fill the narrative black hole with a few ingredients all but absent from today’s summer tent poles – namely mystery, nostalgia and a healthy dose of humility\" and described it as \"an unlikely mix of Independence Day, Pearl Harbor, Jurassic Park and The Hunt for Red October\".\nGiving it a B+ grade, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said, \"For every line of howler dialogue that should have been sunk, there's a nice little scene in which humans have to make a difficult decision. For every stretch of generic sci-fi-via-CGI moviemaking, there's a welcome bit of wit.\" The Washington Post gave the film a three-star rating out of four commenting it is \"an invigorating blast of cinematic adrenaline\".\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, praising the climax as \"an honest-to-God third act, instead of just settling for nonstop fireballs and explosions, as Bay likes to do. I don't want to spoil it for you. Let's say the Greatest Generation still has the right stuff and leave it at that.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"99%\"\n|-\n|+ List of awards and nominations\n|-\n! Award\n!
