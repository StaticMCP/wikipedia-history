The event, held at East London's Waltham Forest Town Hall on June 27, 2014, and was organized by Ben TV in collaboration with the Nigeria High Commission.\nCriticism of the awards\nThe Nigeria Centenary Awards faced criticism, with concerns raised about the selection process and the inclusion of individuals in the honoree list. Critics suggested that political correctness influenced the choices, questioning the automatic reverence bestowed upon anyone who had led Nigeria, equating leadership with instant recognition as a national hero. There were reservations about the selection of awardees from a pool of over 160 million people, highlighting the challenge of condensing recognition to only 100 individuals. Some critics noted discrepancies in categories, citing an imbalance in the representation of academics versus artists. The composition of certain categories was questioned, with surprise expressed over the absence of certain individuals and the inclusion of others in seemingly incongruous groups. Specifically, criticism targeted the omission of notable figures such as Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi and sports pioneers like Hogan Bassey and Emmanuel Ifeajuna.\nThere were also calls for the inclusion of influential traditional rulers and pioneer political leaders, whose absence was deemed conspicuous. Also, concerns were raised about factual inaccuracies within the documentation. Errors in categorization, citations, and historical details led to skepticism about the thoroughness of the selection process and the credibility of the document itself. Some citations seemed to focus on personal details unrelated to the individuals' merits, raising questions about the intent behind such inclusions. Critics argued that the document failed to adequately represent Nigeria's diverse history and achievements, emphasizing the importance of meticulousness and accuracy in compiling such prestigious records for posterity and international recognition.\nThe family of the late M.K.O Abiola, Gani Fawehinmi, and late afrobeat maestro, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, rejected the posthumous awards on their patriarchs.\nSee also\n*Order of the Federal Republic\nReferences"
