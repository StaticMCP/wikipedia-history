The AD/BC notation does not use a year zero; however, astronomical year numbering does use a zero, as well as a minus sign, so \"2&nbsp;BC\" is equal to \"year&nbsp;–1\". 1st century AD (Anno Domini) follows.\nIn the course of the century, all the remaining independent lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea were steadily brought under Roman control, being ruled either directly under governors or through puppet kings appointed by Rome. The Roman state itself was plunged into civil war several times, finally resulting in the marginalization of its 500-year-old Roman Republic, and the embodiment of total state power in a single man—the Roman emperor.\nThe internal turbulence that plagued Rome at this time can be seen as the death throes of the Roman Republic, as it finally gave way to the autocratic ambitions of powerful men like Sulla, Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and Octavian. Octavian's ascension to total power as the emperor Augustus is considered to mark the point in history where the Roman Republic ends and the Roman Empire begins. Some scholars refer to this event as the Roman Revolution.\nIn the eastern mainland, the Han dynasty began to decline and the court of China was in chaos in the latter half of this century. Trapped in a difficult situation, the Xiongnu had to begin emigration to the west or attach themselves to the Han.\nEvents\n90s BC\n's march on Rome in 88 BC was an early step in the Crisis of the Roman Republic.]]\n* 97 BC: Ariarathes VIII is forced out of Cappadocia by Mithridates VI of Pontus, and dies soon afterwards.\n* 96 BC: Cyrene is left to the people of Rome by its ruler Ptolemy Apion.\n* 96 BC: King Alexander Jannaeus of Judea wins the Siege of Gaza.\n* 95 BC: Tigranes the Great becomes king of Armenia\n* 93 BC: Ariobarzanes I Philoromaios becomes king of Cappadocia with Roman backing.\n* 91 BC: The assassination of Marcus Livius Drusus leads to the Social War (91–87 BC) in Italy\n* 91 BC: Crown Prince Ju Revolt in China.\n80s BC\n]]\n]]\n]]\n* 89 BC: Mithridates VI of Pontus's invasion of Cappadocia leads to the First Mithridatic War with the Roman Republic.\n* 89 BC: Valagamba of Anuradhapura gains control of all of Sri Lanka\n* 88 BC: 80,000 Roman civilians killed in the Asiatic Vespers in Asia Minor\n* 87 BC: Emperor Wu of Han dies and is succeeded by his eight-year-old son Zhao, with Jin Midi, Shangguang Jie and Huo Guang as regents.\n* 88 BC: Sulla becomes the first Roman general in history to march on Rome\n* 87 BC: Civil war between the Roman consuls Cornelius Cinna and Octavius\n* 86 BC: Siege of Athens ends with Roman conquest of Athens.\n* 86 BC: the death of the regent of China Jin Midi unleashes the rivalry of his co-regents Shangguang Jie and Huo Guang.\n* 85 BC: Sulla defeats the forces of Mithridates VI in Greece at the Battle of Orchomenus\n* 85 BC: Aretas III of the Nabataeans conquers Damascus.\n* 83 BC: Sulla makes peace with Mithridates VI and marches on Rome.\n* 83-81 BC: Lucius Licinius Murena wages the Second Mithridatic War.\n* 82 BC: Sertorius flees from Sulla to North Africa via Hispania\n* 82 BC: The Dacian king Burebista comes to power and unites the Dacian tribes\n* c.83 BC: Tigranes of Armenia takes control of Syria after the implosion of the Seleucid dynasty.\n* 81 BC: Sulla is appointed dictator of the Roman state, and brings about major reforms.\n* 80 BC: Sertorius invades Hispania and sets up his own regime, beginning the Sertorian War (80-72).\n* 80 BC: conflict between the regents Shangguang Jie and Huo Guang results in the destruction of the Shangguang clan and Huo Guang becoming the de facto ruler of China.\n* c.80 BC: Maues, King of the Sakas, conquers Gandhara and Taxila.\n70s BC\n]]\n]]\n* 77 BC: Fu Jiezi assassinated the king of Loulan on behalf of the Han dynasty.\n* c.75 BC: Kanva dynasty replaces the Shunga dynasty in Magadha.\n* 74 BC: Mithridates VI of Pontus disputes Nicomedes IV of Bithynia's bequest of his kingdom to the Roman Republic, beginning the Third Mithridatic War.\n* 74 BC: Emperor Zhao of Han dies and is succeeded by the unsuitable Prince He of Changyi and then by Xuan.
