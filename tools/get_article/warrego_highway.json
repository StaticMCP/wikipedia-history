It connects coastal centres to the south western areas of the state, and is approximately 715&nbsp;km in length. It takes its name from the Warrego River, which is the endpoint of the highway. The entire highway is part of the National Highway system linking Darwin and Brisbane: formerly National Highway 54, Queensland began to convert to the alphanumeric system much of Australia had adopted in the early-2000s and this road is now designated as National Highway A2.\nState-controlled road\nWarrego Highway is a state-controlled road, divided into seven sections for administrative and funding purposes. Six of the seven sections (numbers 18A to 18F) are part of the National Highway, while section 18G is a regional road. The sections are:\n* 18A – Ipswich to Toowoomba\n* 18B – Toowoomba to Dalby\n* 18C – Dalby to Miles\n* 18D – Miles to Roma\n* 18E – Roma to Mitchell\n* 18F – Mitchell to Morven\n* 18G – Morven to Charleville\nState-controlled roads that intersect with the highway are listed in the main article.\nRoute description\nThe highway commences at the end of the M2 Ipswich Motorway, near Ipswich and runs to Helidon Spa, at the foot of the Great Dividing Range. From there it follows the Toowoomba Bypass to Charlton, west of Toowoomba. The Warrego then crosses the Darling Downs, bypassing the town of Oakey and then passing through the towns of Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles, in the Western Downs.  The highway continues through the towns of Roma and Mitchell in the Maranoa Region of South West Queensland.  After Morven, the A2 Route continues north–west along the Landsborough Highway, with the western turnoff continuing the Warrego Highway down to its terminus at Charleville.\nThe section of highway between Ipswich and Charlton is mostly motorway grade; a four lane divided highway with motorway-style on-ramps and off-ramps.  At a point between Charlton and Oakey the highway merges from 4 to 2 lanes (however, throughout 2017–2019, the highway was planned to be duplicated up until Oakey)  Then, the highway mostly continues in a straight line with minimal turns.  At Dalby, the highway briefly returns to 4 lanes (where a longer stretch of the highway was planned to be duplicated in 2017).  The Warrego then continues as a rural 2 lane highway, until Charleville.\nTerrain\nThe Warrego Highway's lowest point along its length is 3.69&nbsp;m just east of where it crosses the Bremer River near Ipswich, and its highest elevation is at the top of the Great Dividing Range on the Toowoomba Bypass.\nSpeed zones\n*Ipswich Motorway – Blacksoil 100&nbsp;km/h\n*Blacksoil – Toowoomba Bypass merge 100&nbsp;km/h, with a drop to 80&nbsp;km/h and/or 60&nbsp;km/h through some towns\n*Great Dividing Range (Toowoomba Bypass to Charlton) 80&nbsp;km/h to 100&nbsp;km/h\n*Charlton – Kingsthorpe 90&nbsp;km/h\n*Kingsthorpe – Dalby 100&nbsp;km/h except through Jondaryan, which is 80&nbsp;km/h.\n*Dalby – 60&nbsp;km/h\n*Dalby – Chinchilla 100&nbsp;km/h except running through towns, which speeds can drop to 60&nbsp;km/h\n*Chinchilla – Charleville 110&nbsp;km/h except running through towns, which speeds can drop to 60&nbsp;km/h\nTowns along the route\nFrom east to west, the highway passes through or close to the cities and major towns of:\n* Ipswich (Bypassed)\n* Gatton (Bypassed)\n* Toowoomba (Bypassed)\n* Oakey (Bypassed)\n* Dalby\n* Chinchilla\n* Miles\n* Roma\n* Mitchell\n* Morven\n* Charleville\nGallery\nFile:Warrego Highway Haigslea.jpg|Highway at Haigslea, 2014\nFile:Light Shining Through Clouds.jpg|Stretch of Highway between Ipswich and Toowoomba\nFile:Signpost on Warrego Highway -Australia-1Aug2009.jpg|A signpost\nHistory\nIn January 2011, the former highway was extensively damaged where it crossed the Toowoomba Range.  This included land slips, shoulder and embankment erosion, the erosion of drains and damaged rock fall netting.  The road wasn't fully repaired with all four lanes open until September 2011.\nThe Toowoomba Bypass was completed in September 2019 and bypasses the urban area of Toowoomba and provides a better crossing of the Great Dividing Range. Warrego Highway (A2) was rerouted via the bypass between Helidon Spa (in the east) and the interchange at Charlton (in the west). The bypass continues as the Gore Highway (A39) and is 41&nbsp;km in length. The original section of Warrego Highway through Toowoomba was renamed Toowoomba Connection Road (A21).\nThe highway was closed for several days at North Tivoli in May 2025 after an overpass was struck during the transport of a wind turbine.\nMajor works\n* 1957 – Helidon bypass. New road built to bypass Helidon including a steel and concrete bridge over Lockyer Creek.  Construction started in 1954, and the bypass was opened by the end of June 1957.\n* 1959 – Ipswich bypass. New 8 mile long bypass including a steel and concrete bridge over the Bremer River built to bypass Ipswich City, shortening the highway by 2 miles.  Also completed this year was the first bridge over Laidley Creek at Crowley Vale.\n* 1966 -  Lockyer Creek deviation.  3.6 mile section of road bypassing a series of sharp curves between Gatton and Grantham, including a steel and concrete bridge 370 ft long over Lockyer Creek was completed and a  was opened to traffic. The old alignment followed Wells Road and Armstrongs Road.\n* 1970 - Construction of a four-lane section, 1.7 miles in length, from Withcott to join with the four-lane section on the Toowoomba Range was completed.\n* 1971 – Marburg bypass. 1.9 miles (3.1 km) of new road built to bypass Marburg, including bridges over Queen Street and Black Snake Creek.\n* 1971 – Blanchview deviation. 5.15 miles (8.3 km) of new road that replaced the old twisting route built in the late 1920s. The deviation opened to traffic in December of that year.\n* 1973 - Tenthill Creek bridge.  New new prestressed concrete girder bridge over Tenthill Creek to replace the old truss structure known as Robinson's Bridge.\n* 1974 – Minden Range deviation. 2.6 km of new road built to bypass a sub-standard section of road over the Minden Range.\n* 1976 – Hattonvale to Laidley Creek duplication. 8 km of road widened to four lanes at a cost of $870,000.\n* 1982 - Construction to four lanes on an improved alignment was completed for 2.8 km from the Brisbane Valley Highway junction to the Walloon turnoff.\n* 1986 - Glenore Grove to Gatton duplication Stage 1.  5.6 km of road between Glenore Grove and the Queensland Agricultural College was duplicated, and the second bridge over Laidley Creek at Crowley Vale was constructed.\n* 1987 - Glenore Grove to Gatton duplication Stage 2.  3.9 km between the Queensland Agricultural College and the Gatton-Esk Road was completed.\n* 1989 – Gatton bypass. Single carriageway 20 km long bypass of Gatton, Grantham and Helidon constructed at a cost of $20 million opened in November 1989.\n* 1991 - Helidon Spa to Withcott Duplication opened on 21 October 1991.\n* 1993 - Bremer River Bridge Duplication.

A grade-separated interchange at River Road was also built.\n* 1994 - Construction of overtaking lanes on the Gatton Bypass.\n* 1996 - 2.8 km section between Greenwattle Street and Nugent Pinch Road in Toowoomba duplicated to relieve traffic congestion at a cost of $2.5 million.\n* 1997 - Oakey Bypass.\n* 2002 – Yaralla Deviation. 18.5 km realignment built to bypass a notorious section prone to flooding west of Dalby.\n* 2003 - Gatton Bypass duplication completed, removing the final single carriageway section of the Warrego Highway between Ipswich and Toowoomba.\n* 2017 – Toowoomba to Oakey Duplication Stage 1. Highway duplicated from Nugent Pinch Road to Charlton.\n* 2018 – Toowoomba to Oakey Duplication Stage 2. Highway duplicated from Charlton to Kingsthorpe including an interchange at Kingsthorpe–Haden Road\n* 2019 – Toowoomba Second Range Crossing – Helidon Spa to Charlton (Northern concurrency terminus with Gore Highway)\nRecent developments\nDalby Eastern & Western Access\nThese projects began in 2017 to fully duplicate the highway to four lanes, between Cecil Plains Road and Black Street. Four new traffic signals were added at Black Street, Jandowae Road, Orpen Street and a pedestrian signal near Owen Street. Both projects were completed in November 2018, at a combined cost of $115 million.\nRoads of Strategic Importance\nThe Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, last updated in March 2022, includes the following project for the Warrego Highway.\nPriority section projects\nA project to upgrade priority sections of the Toowoomba to Ipswich corridor, including the Warrego Highway and surrounding state and council roads, at an estimated cost of $75 million, was in planning in May 2020.\nOther projects\nBrimblecombe Road intersection\nA project to upgrade the Brimblecombe Road intersection between Toowoomba and Dalby, at a cost of $2,75 million, was completed in December 2021.\nGatton heavy vehicle decoupling facility\nA project to provide a heavy vehicle decoupling facility at Gatton was completed by November 2021.\nMaster plan Ipswich to Toowoomba\nA master plan for the upgrade of the highway between Ipswich and Toowoomba has been developed at a cost of $6.78 million.\nHaigslea–Amberley Road intersection\nA project to plan the upgrade of the Haigslea-Amberley Road intersection, at a cost of $799,000, was in progress in May 2022.\nMount Crosby Road intersection\nA project to plan the upgrade of the Mount Crosby Road intersection, at a cost of $5 million, was in progress in July 2021.\nOther items of interest\nDarren Lockyer Way\nOn 28 September 2011 the Queensland Main Roads Minister, Craig Wallace, announced that an 85&nbsp;km stretch of the Warrego Highway was to be renamed Darren Lockyer Way, in honour of the retired Brisbane Broncos, Queensland and Australian rugby league captain. The section of road renamed is from Riverview to the bottom of the Toowoomba Range at Withcott. Special signage including \"Welcome to Darren Lockyer Way\" has been erected.\nMajor intersections\nIpswich Motorway (National Route&nbsp;M2) – east&nbsp;– Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast  Cunningham Highway (National Highway M15) – west — Dinmore\n|notes=South–eastern end of Warrego Highway (State Route M2 / National Highway A2)\n}}\nMount Crosby Road (State Route 37) – north – Mount Crosbysouth – Tivoli\n|notes=Modified diamond interchange.Part of Chuwar is in the Brisbane LGA.\n|location=}}\nFernvale Road (State Route 38) – south – BrassallPine Mountain Road – north – Pine Mountain\n|notes=Modified diamond interchange.The road changes to National Highway A2 from this point.\n|location=}}\nBrisbane Valley Highway (National Route A17) – north – FernvaleWulkuraka Connection Road – south – Wulkuraka\n|notes=Modified diamond interchange.\n|location=}}\nEastern Drive (State Route 80) – south–west – Gatton Gatton–Esk Road – north – Esk\n|notes=Modified diamond interchange.\n}}\nToowoomba Connection Road (A21) – west – Toowoomba\n|notes=No entry from Toowoomba Connection Road eastbound and no exit to Toowoomba Connection Road westbound (except via a U-turn facility further east on the Warrego Highway)Warrego Highway runs north–west on the Toowoomba Bypass\n}}\nNew England Highway (A3)\n|notes=Bridges over the bypass.
