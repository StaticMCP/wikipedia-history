He wrote an Analysis of Welsh Orthography and an English and Welsh Dictionary.\nLife and writings\nAt the age of 14, Edwards was apprenticed to a saddler named Birch, in whose family he cultivated his taste for Welsh-language literature. He married in 1801 or 1802. He moved to London and became a secretary to Nathaniel M. Rothschild.\nIn 1838, Edwards was appointed with five others to improve Welsh orthography, in connection with the Abergavenny Eisteddfod. In 1845 he published his Analysis of Welsh Orthography. For many years he was a member of the Cymmrodorion and delivered several lectures there. One of them, entitled \"Currency\", later appeared in print.
