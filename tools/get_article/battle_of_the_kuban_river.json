The attack was repelled with heavy Russian losses.\nHistory\nAfter their failed military operations in Circassia, the Russian detachment, led by General Ratiev, made its way to the Caucasus line.\nWhile going along the Kuban River, the Kazan infantry Regiment was sent forth for the safety of the remaining army, as there could be potential ambushes and traps on the River Gorge. In the night of 25 September, Mansur's forces, numbering between 300 and 400 fighters, under the cover of darkness, launched a surprise attack on the Kazan Infantry Regiment, which formed the rear guard of the Russian army.\nMansur almost managed to crush the regiment, but his forces were poorly equipped, with most being armed with bows and arrows instead of firearms. After a two-hour long battle, Mansur's fighters retreated.\nShortly after, the Russian army received the order to withdraw their forces and retreat beyond the Kuban, due to the failure of the campaign and the large amount of losses suffered by the Russians. Up to 200 were killed, several hundred were wounded.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://runivers.ru/conflicts/actions/boy_na_kubani/ Battle of the Kuban (in Russian)]\n*"
