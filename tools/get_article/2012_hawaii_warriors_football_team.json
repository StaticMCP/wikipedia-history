They were led by first-year head coach Norm Chow and played their home games at Aloha Stadium. They were first year members of the Mountain West Conference. They finished the season 3–9, 1–7 in Mountain West play to finish in a tie for ninth place.\nNew head coach\nIn December 2011, the university hired Norm Chow, a native Hawaiian who had most recently served as the offensive coordinator at Utah, as its head coach to replace the retiring Greg McMackin. With Chow's hiring, the Warriors abandoned the run and shoot offense that McMackin's predecessor June Jones installed and instead ran a pro-style offense.\nSchedule\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n}}\nGame summaries\n@ USC\nLamar\nNevada\n@ BYU\n@ San Diego State\nNew Mexico\n@ Colorado State\n@ Fresno State\nBoise State\n@ Air Force\nUNLV\nSouth Alabama\nReferences"
