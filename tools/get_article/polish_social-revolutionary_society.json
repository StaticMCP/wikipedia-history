The program, recognizing the \"right to independence and national development\", proclaimed the slogan \"Long live a free, socialist and democratic Poland!\" It also emphasized that \"Poland exists only where the people recognize and want to be Polish, and it ends where this people, not wanting to belong to the Polish union, joins a free union of another nationality.\"\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
