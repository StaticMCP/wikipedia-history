Self-taught, he acquired a vast knowledge of the Sperrin Mountains through experience, experimentation, observation, and traditional lore. He discovered many prehistoric sites, although he is best known for his discovery of the Beaghmore stone circles, and developed the theory that they were an ancient lunar observatory. This theory was expressed in his poem, The Beaghmore Stone Circles.\nThe Beaghmore Stone Circles\nCeremonial occasions they often had there,\nThey knew every day, aye, and week in the year,\nFor fifty-two weeks they had stones in a ring,\nThirteen in a line for the time the call Spring.\nThe same for Summer, that time of great joy,\nTwenty-six for the Autumn and Winter stands nigh,\nFour stones that are bigger stand up in a line,\nFor midsummer sunrise and midwinter time.\nOne stone by the circle's a day it appears,\nAnother convenient makes out the leap years,\nYou can soon make them out, if you look the place o'er,\nTwixt the eastern circle and mighty big four.\nField work\nWell known to academics for his extensive local knowledge and experience of the Sperrins, he assisted many field expeditions, and is recognised in the published findings. Upon his death, Professor E.E. Evans, Ireland's first professor of Geography, wrote:\nPen name\nIn the 1920s, he used the pen name G.B. M'Keown (M'Keown being his mother's maiden name), when writing notes for the weekly column 'Nature and Antiquarian Notes' in the Northern Whig Newspaper. On 19 November 1927 his real identity was revealed to the public.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232634/http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/barnett.html Ulster History Circle: George Barnett]\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*"
