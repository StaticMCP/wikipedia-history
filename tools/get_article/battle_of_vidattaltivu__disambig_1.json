The battle took place on July 16, 2008, part of the Northern Theatre of Eelam War IV during the Sri Lankan civil war. The 58 Division victory in the battle marked the first time the Army had been in control of the town in 21 years. According to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence, the town had been the primary base used by the LTTE for its maritime operations and had also served as their logistics hub, making the taking of the town by the Army a \"fatal blow\" to the LTTE.\nSee also\n* List of Sri Lankan Civil War battles\nReferences"
