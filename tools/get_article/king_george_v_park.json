The stadium was built in 1925 as the National stadium of Newfoundland. It is the oldest surviving soccer specific stadium in North America, and hosts the Memorial Sea-Hawks soccer teams.\nHistory\nThe most famous game played at King George V was on 14 September 1985 when over 13,000 people witnessed Canada's 2–1 victory over Honduras to win the 1985 CONCACAF Championship; the match also qualified Canada for their first World Cup (Mexico, 1986). It was a momentous occasion and is considered to be the first high point of Canadian soccer history.\nThe stadium played host to the 1987 FIFA U-16 World Championship.\nIn 2005 construction began on a major renovation involving widening and lengthening the field surface, installing an underground irrigation system, constructing new locker room facilities as well as expanding the bleacher seating. In 2006, the natural grass playing surface was replaced with a FieldTurf pitch. It seats 6,400 for soccer.\nIn 2008, KGV played host to the Challenge Cup and the Jubilee Trophy.\nSee also\n* Royal eponyms in Canada\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=18&ll=47.577684,-52.701287&spn=0.002211,0.004726&t=k&om=1 Satellite view of King George V Park on Google Maps]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150429041110/http://www.sjsoccer.ca/photos/index.php?category=1 Pictures of King George V Park]"
