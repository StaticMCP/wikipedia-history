It formed part of the South African Army Infantry Formation as well as the South African Territorial Reserve.\nHistory\nOrigin\nOperations\nWith the SADF\nDuring this era, the unit was mainly used for area force protection, search and cordones as well as stock theft control assistance to the rural police.\nWith the SANDF\nDisbandment\nThis unit, along with all other Commando units was disbanded after a decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki to disband all Commando Units. The Commando system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 \"because of the role it played in the apartheid era\", according to the Minister of Safety and Security Charles Nqakula.\nUnit Insignia\nLeadership\nReferences\nSee also\n* South African Commando System"
