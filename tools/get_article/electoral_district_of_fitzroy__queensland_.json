It included the towns of Baralaba, Blackwater, Duaringa, Dysart, Mount Morgan and Wowan as well as some of Rockhampton's outer suburbs. The electorate was first contested in 1992. An earlier district based in the same region was also called Fitzroy. It was first contested in 1888 and abolished in 1960.\nIn 2008, Fitzroy was abolished—with effect at the 2009 state election—as a result of a redistribution undertaken by the Electoral Commission of Queensland. Its former territory and voters were divided between the districts of Callide, Gregory, Mirani and Rockhampton.\nMembers for Fitzroy\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|First incarnation (1888–1960)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Robert Lyons\n| Conservative\n| 1888–1889\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Albert Callan\n| Independent\n| 1889–1902\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|rowspan=2| Henri Cowap\n| Labor\n| 1902–1907\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Kidstonites\n| 1907–1909\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|rowspan=2| James Crawford\n| Labor\n| 1909–1911\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Independent\n| 1911–1912\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Kenneth Grant\n| Liberal\n| 1912–1915\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Harold Hartley\n| Labor\n| 1915–1929\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| William Carter\n| Country and Progressive National\n| 1929–1932\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Jens Peterson\n| Country and Progressive National\n| 1932–1935\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Jim Clark\n| Labor\n| 1935–1960\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|Second incarnation (1992–2009)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Jim Pearce\n| Labor\n| 1992–2009\n|-\n|}\nElection results\nSee also\n* Electoral districts of Queensland\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly by year\n* :Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly by name\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/qld/2006/guide/fitz.htm ABC profile]"
