After attending Sydney Grammar School and the University of Sydney (BA 1886, MA 1888), he was articled to the solicitors' firm Allen & Allen, qualifying but not seeking admission as a solicitor. In 1891, he married Jane Rosa Marshall, with whom he had five children.\nLoxton was called to the Bar in 1892 and practised in the Equity Court. In the late 1910s, he became active in political campaigns, strongly supporting conscription and six o'clock closing of public bars. He was elected in 1920 to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as an independent Nationalist member for Ryde, but joined the Nationalist Party in 1922, serving in parliament until 1925. He died in Sydney in 1935.\nReferences\n&nbsp;"
