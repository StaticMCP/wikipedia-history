It is centred on the townlands of Courtlough, Malheney and Palmerstown which lie in the civil parish of Balrothery. It is located about 24 kilometres north of Dublin city, between the towns of Skerries, Lusk and Balbriggan.\nMan of War area is noted for its public house and restaurant which has a preserved tree inside the establishment and also shares the name Man of War. The building has existed for centuries, with deeds mentioning it at least as far back to 1595.\nIn 1732, an Act of Parliament established the tolled Coach Road called the Dublin to Dunleer Turnpike (1732—1855) and a turnpike (toll booth) was situated at the Man O'War Pub. The toll booth has since been removed.\nThe Gaelic football team of the same name, Man-O-War GFC, was founded in 1946. It fields teams from Juvenile, Adult Men and Adult Ladies levels. The club's achievements include winning the Men's Dublin Junior Football Championship in 1979 and 2023, and winning the Ladies Dublin Junior A Football Championship in 2019.\nReferences"
