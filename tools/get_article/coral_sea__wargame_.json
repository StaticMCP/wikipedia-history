First the opposing fleets must be located. While aircraft on the map can always be seen by both players, fleets are hidden, and players use the numbered hex grid system to track their fleet movements. Fleet locations are only revealed when spotted by aircraft, reconnaissance ships or coast watchers. Once a fleet has been spotted, the opposing player can send airplanes to attack. There are also rules to cover air craft maintenance, coast-watchers, and amphibious invasions,\nPublication history\nIn 1974, Marc W. Miller designed Coral Sea, and it was published by GDW as a ziplock bag game with artwork by Rodger B. MacGowan. A second edition with slightly revised rules was published by GDW in 1976.\nReception\nIn the 1977 book The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming, Nick Palmer thought the combination of open air movement and hidden sea movement was unusual. He noted the \"highly detailed ship and air descriptions\" and that \"90% of the ship and air counters are interchangeable with [companion game] Battle for Midway.\" Palmer concluded with a warning about the complexity of the game, saying, \"noted for realism, but rules require concentration.\"\nIn The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training, Martin Campion commented that \"the antiaircraft ought to be toned down and a fully secret movement and search system used.\"\nIn Issue 1 of Command, Dennis Agosta warned that \"Aircraft are not universally available, but require maintenance between flights. Thus each side builds up its available strength over several turns, and then makes a bold, swift strike.\"\nOther reviews and commentary\n*Strategy & Tactics #29, #38 and #65\n*Fire & Movement #7, #12 and #67\n*Phoenix #4\n*Panzerfaust Magazine #68\nReferences"
