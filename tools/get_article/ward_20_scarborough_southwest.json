The seat was temporarily vacant between July 26, 2023 and November 30, 2023 following the resignation of Gary Crawford to run in the 2023 Scarborough—Guildwood provincial by-election. It covers the area of the City of Toronto bounded by  Eglinton Avenue East to the north, Lake Ontario to the south, Victoria Park Avenue to the west, and Markham Road to the east. It contains the neighbourhoods of Birch Cliff, Birch Cliff Heights, Clairlea, Cliffcrest, Cliffside, Fallingbrook, Hunt Club, Oakridge, Scarborough Junction, and the western half of Scarborough Village.\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model.\nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election.\nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018.\nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model.\nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency.\nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\nFrom 2000 to 2018, Scarborough Southwest was represented on city council by Wards 35 (northern half) and 36 (southern half). From 1998 to 2000 the area generally corresponded to Ward 13 (Scarborough Bluffs) on City Council, and returned two members. From 1988 to 1997 Scarborough Bluffs was represented on Metropolitan Toronto Council until Scarborough's amalgamation into the city.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Council term\n! colspan=\"2\" |Member\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Scarborough Bluffs (Metro Council)\n|-\n|1988–1991\n|colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\"|Brian Ashton\n|-\n|1991–1994\n|-\n|1994–1997\n|-\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ward 13 Scarborough Bluffs\n|-\n|1997–2000\n| colspan=\"2\" |Brian Ashton, Gerry Altobello\n|-\n!\n!
