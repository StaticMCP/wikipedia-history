It was fought in Hato Mayor, at the junction of the Iguamo and Guamira rivers. Genaro Díaz was in charge of this battle, entering at dawn on May 4, 1864. The restorers sent a column to the center of the savannah to bombard the Spanish. (Genaro, who was known for his skillful handling of the saber during the long since concluded Dominican War of Independence, led a force of machete-wielding soldiers). In the end, the Dominicans defeated the Spanish, in which they acquired one of the two Spanish cannons.\nReferences"
