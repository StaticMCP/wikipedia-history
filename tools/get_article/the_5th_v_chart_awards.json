Due to time restraints, EXO only performed two out of the initially planned four songs which brought displeasure to the crowds. At the last 20 minutes of voting for the \"Most Popular Artist Of The Night\" award, girl group ATF had an abrupt spike of votes, turning the tables on EXO which caused much disorder among the audience present.\nIn April 2023, Yinyuetai posted an apology letter to EXO and EXO-Ls for rigging EXO’s awards.\n\"On the voting night, EXO has always been the leader in the most anticipated 'Most Popular Artist of  The Night' at that time. But in the last few minutes, several account represent a certain girl group invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in an instant. Override the result.\"\nReferences"
