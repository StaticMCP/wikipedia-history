The Old Swan West ward was created as a single-member ward from the western part of the former Old Swan ward and a portion of the former Kensington & Fairfield ward covering Liverpool Innovation Park. The ward boundaries follow the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, Innovation Boulevard, behind the Littlewoods Pools building, Edge Lane, the Canada Dock Branch railway line, behind Brelade Road, Menstone Road, Portlet Road and Stoneville Road, Derby Lane, Edge Lane Drive, and Mill Lane. The ward covers part of the Old Swan district of Liverpool.}}\nNotes\nReferences"
