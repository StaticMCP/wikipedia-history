It comes with a number of preset scenarios, including the Battle of Arbela (331 BC), the Battle of Lepanto (1571), the Battle of Blenheim (1704), and the American Civil War battles of Antietam and Shiloh (1862).\nReception\n| rev1 = Computer Game Review\n| rev1Score = 84/89/85\n}}\nPC Gamer reviewed the game, giving it a 63/100, and argued that it is \"the most powerful, flexible, wargame construction set ever published\", but ultimately criticized how complex and badly documented it was, calling the game \"one of the biggest disappointments in years\". Next Generation gave the PC version two stars out of five, and compared it unfavorably with the original game, ultimately calling it \"a disappointment\". Computer Game Review dubbed the game a \"solid job on a project of this magnitude\".\nReviews\n* [https://www.oldgames.sk/en/mag/level-14/page/31/ Level #31] (in Czech)\n* Computer Gaming World (December 1995)\n* PC Player (November 1995)\n* Australian Realms #28\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.mobygames.com/game/empire-ii-the-art-of-war Empire II: The Art of War] at MobyGames"
