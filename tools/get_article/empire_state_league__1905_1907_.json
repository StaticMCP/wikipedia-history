The 14 different league franchises were based exclusively in New York (state). The league name was succeeded by the 1913 Empire State League based in Georgia and Empire State League (1987) based in New York (state).\nHistory\nOn March 22, 1905, the Empire State League was formed at a meeting held in Syracuse, New York. The teams were selected and R.C. Mayor of Rome was elected secretary and treasurer. Salaries were set at $600.00 per month for each team.\nThe 1905 Empire State League began play as an eight–team independent league on May 26, 1905. Seneca Falls won the championship with a 42–26 record and several teams folded or relocated during the 1905 season.\nIn 1906, the Empire State League reduced to six teams, beginning the season on May 26, 1906 and becoming a Class D level minor league. With a record of 48–26, Seneca Falls again won the championship.\nIn its final season of play, the 1907 Empire State League continued play as a six–team Class D level league and crowned a new champion. The Oswego Starchmakers finished 1.0 game ahead of second place Seneca Falls to win the league championship.\nM.T. Roche served as president of the Empire State League for all three seasons of play.\nCities represented\n*Auburn, NY: Auburn 1906–1907\n*Canandaigua, NY: Canandaigua 1905\n*Cortland, NY: Cortland 1905\n*Fulton, NY: Fulton 1905–1907\n*Geneva, NY: Geneva 1905–1907\n*Ilion, NY: Ilion 1905\n*Lyons, NY: Lyons 1905, 1907\n*Oneida, NY: Oneida 1905\n*Oswego, NY: Oswego Starchmakers 1905–1907\n*Palmyra, NY: Palmyra 1905\n*Penn Yan, NY: Penn Yan 1906\n*Rome, NY: Rome 1905\n*Seneca Falls, NY: Seneca Falls 1905–1907\n*Syracuse, NY: Syracuse 1906\nStandings & statistics\n1905 Empire State League\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Team standings!!W!!L!!PCT!!GB!!
