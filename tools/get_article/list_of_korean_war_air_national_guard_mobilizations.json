Truman issued federalization orders, bringing ANG units under federal control.  Eventually, some 45,000 Air Guardsmen, about 80 percent of the force, were mobilized.  Initially mobilized units were deployed to Far East Air Forces (FEAF) for combat operations in Korea.  Other mobilized units were deployed to Europe to reinforce United States Air Forces in Europe.\nBeginning in Feb 1951, mobilized units were assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC), Strategic Air Command (SAC) and Tactical Air Command (TAC), replacing or augmenting active-duty units.  Later many ANG personnel and equipment were redeployed from their active-duty units as individual filler replacements to FEAF as required, being assigned to various combat units as replacements.  Guardsmen began to be demobilized in Jul 1952, with their units being inactivated by the active-duty air force.   Subsequently, the individual state Air National Guard bureaus re-activated and re-formed the units beginning in Jan 1953.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|- bgcolor=cccccc\n!Width=225|Unit\n!Width=100|State\n!Width=175|DeploymentLocation\n!Width=50 |Mobilized\n!Width=50 |Demobilized\n!Comments\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 101st Fighter-Interceptor Wing || Maine || Dow AFB, MEGrenier AFB, NHLarson AFB, WA || 1 Feb 1951 || 6 Feb 1952 || ADC; Consisted of: 101st FIS, 132d FIS, 133d FIS, 136th FIS; assigned to EADF; moved to Grenier AFB, NH, in May 1951; moved to Larson AFB, WA on 2 Aug 1951, transferred to WADF.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 101st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron || Massachusetts || Dow AFB, ME || 1 Apr 1951 || 1 Nov 1952 || 101st FW (ADC): F-80C Shooting Star\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 102d Bombardment Squadron || New York || Mar AFB, CA || 1 Mar 1951 || 1 Dec 1952 || 106th BG (SAC), B-29 Superfortress; mission was to train reservists to backfill rotating B-29 combat crews serving in Korea.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 103d Bombardment Squadron || Pennsylvania || Fairchild AFB, WA || 1 Apr 1951 || 15 Nov 1952 || 111th SRW (SAC), RB-29 Superfortress\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 103d Fighter-Interceptor Wing || Connecticut || Brainard Field, CTSuffolk County AFB, NY || 1 Mar 1951 || 6 Feb 1952 || ADC: 118th FIS, assigned to EADF; moved to Suffolk County AFB, NY, by 1 Jun 1951\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 105th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron || Tennessee || Berry Field, TNMcGhee-Tyson AFB, TN || 1 May 1951 || 1 Dec 1952 || Initially allocated to TAC as 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, transferred to ADC. re-designated as the 105th Fighter Interceptor Squadron.
