On June 16, 2007, Mayor Thomas M. Menino dedicated the new square marking the completion of the current phase of the project. The centerpiece of the project, a statue by Laura Baring-Gould of a giant Clapp Pear (a variety of pear that was developed in Dorchester in the nineteenth century) now sits at the corner of East Cottage Street and Columbia Road.\nThe James Blake House\nThe James Blake House is a historic house at 735 Columbia Road near the square.
