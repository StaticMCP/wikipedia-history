The music on their first three official full-length releases, Sinthetic, Intoxicate O.S. and Zero Nexus, bears a melodic sort of black metal, featuring the usage of both electronic and symphonic elements. Their lyrics are mainly in English, except for one song that has lyrics in Finnish, \"...Ja Pimeys Laskeutui\", the title of which can be translated as \"...And Darkness Descended\" (the last word \"Laskeutui\" can also be translated as \"Fell\", \"Came\" or \"Landed\").\nThe third demo CD of the band, Essence of Pain, raised the interest of the Italian label Avantgarde Music. As a result, their debut album Sinthetic was released on 29 March 2004, under the aforementioned label.\nIn 2006, the band signed with the Finnish label Dynamic Arts Records. The same year, their second album, Intoxicate O.S., was released on May 24, 14 days after the release of the single \"Slitwrist Ecstasy\". Intoxicate O.S. had moderate success, reaching number 25 in weekly Finnish album sales.\nAfter releasing the album, Shade Empire continued playing at several events such as Jörisrock and Qstock, mainly beside other Finnish artists. They also performed on a series of independent gigs. The same year, Shade Empire played their first official concert outside of Finland, in the encompassment of the Popkomm trade show in Berlin at the Kulturbrauerei (Culture Brewery). The band released their fourth album in the 6 May 2013. Called Omega Arcane, it was released via Candlelight Records.\nOn 11 April 2017 the band announced that their long-time vocalist Juha Harju has been dismissed from the band, to be replaced by Henry Hämäläinen. Their fifth album Poetry of the Ill-Minded would still feature Juha on vocals. Both that album and their 2023 album Sunholy (their first album with Henry on vocals) displayed the band moving further into melodic death metal and discarding their industrial roots while maintaining the symphonic black metal sound they have been known for.\nGallery\nShade Empire Dark Troll 2018 09.jpg|Bassist Eero Mantere\nShade Empire Dark Troll 2018 01.jpg|Guitarist Juha Sirkkiä\nShade Empire Dark Troll 2018 11.jpg|Keyboardist Olli Savolainen\nShade Empire Dark Troll 2018 23.jpg|Drummer Erno Räsänen\nShade Empire Dark Troll 2018 03.jpg|Guitarist Aapeli Kivimäki\nShade Empire Dark Troll 2018 08.jpg|Singer Henry Hämäläinen\nMembers\nPresent\n*Eero Mantere – bass (1999–present)\n*Juha Sirkkiä – guitars (2000–present)\n*Erno Räsänen – drums (2006–present)\n*Aapeli Kivimäki - guitars (2013–present)\n*Henry Hämäläinen – vocals (2017–present)\nPrevious members\n*Tero Liimatainen – guitars (1999-2000)\n*Antti Makkonen – drums (1999–2006)\n*Janne Niiranen – guitars (1999-2013)\n*Juha Harju – vocals (2000-2017)\n*Olli Savolainen – keyboards (2000–2021)\nTimeline\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1999\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1999\nLegend     = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\nColors =\nid:vocals  value:red       legend:Vocals\nid:guitar    value:green     legend:Guitar\nid:bass    value:blue      legend:Bass\nid:keys    value:purple    legend:Keyboards\nid:drums   value:orange    legend:Drums\nid:bars    value:gray(0.95)\nid:studio   value:black     legend:Studio_Album\nid:other   value:gray(0.5) legend:Demos/EPs\nBackgroundColors = bars:bars\nLineData =\nat:05/01/2000 color:other layer:back\nat:06/01/2001 color:other layer:back\nat:05/01/2002 color:other layer:back\nat:03/29/2004 color:black layer:back\nat:05/24/2006 color:black layer:back\nat:03/12/2008 color:black layer:back\nat:05/06/2013 color:black layer:back\nat:06/30/2017 color:black layer:back\nBarData =\nbar:Juha     text:\"Juha Harju\"\nbar:Henry     text:\"Henry Hämäläinen\"\nbar:Tero     text:\"Tero Liimatainen\"\nbar:Juha2  text:\"Juha Sirkkiä\"\nbar:Janne  text:\"Janne Niiranen\"\nbar:Aapeli  text:\"Aapeli Kivimäki\"\nbar:Eero     text:\"Eero Mantere\"\nbar:Olli       text:\"Olli Savolainen\"\nbar:Antti    text:\"Antti Makkonen\"\nbar:Erno     text:\"Erno Räsänen\"\nPlotData =\nwidth:11\nbar:Juha     from:02/01/2000 till:04/11/2017 color:vocals\nbar:Henry    from:04/11/2017 till:end color:vocals\nbar:Tero      from:01/01/1999 till:02/01/2000  color:guitar\nbar:Juha2   from:02/01/2000 till:end  color:guitar\nbar:Janne   from:01/01/1999 till:08/01/2013  color:guitar\nbar:Aapeli   from:08/01/2013 till:end  color:guitar\nbar:Eero      from:01/01/1999 till:end  color:bass\nbar:Olli        from:02/01/2000 till:10/05/2021  color:keys\nbar:Antti     from:01/01/1999 till:08/01/2006  color:drums\nbar:Erno      from:08/01/2006 till:end  color:drums\n}}\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n*Sinthetic (2004)\n*Intoxicate O.S.
