While in the region, it reportedly engaged in agricultural activity and launched a military campaign against the Circassians. Later that year, due to crop failure and worsening conditions, the Horde moved closer to the Kabarda frontier, into the Pyatigorye area. However, several major Tatar tribal groups chose instead to migrate toward the Volga River, prompting the Horde’s leadership to follow.\nReports from contemporary sources, including Muscovite envoys in Crimea, described the Great Horde as suffering from famine and the loss of livestock, indicating a significant internal crisis.\nThat same year, a Crimean military unit attacked a Circassian diplomatic mission traveling to the leadership of the Great Horde. According to correspondence from Khan Meñli I Giray to Ivan III of Russia, the Crimean detachment seized gifts and detained the envoys. Soon after, Muscovite service Cossacks intervened and took control of the prisoners and their belongings. The Crimean Khan later requested that Moscow return both the captives and the confiscated goods.\nReferences"
