He trained at Cuddesdon College and was ordained priest in 1925.\nAfter a curacy at Ashford, Kent, he returned to New Zealand where he was Vicar of Ross and South Westland and then Waimate. While at Cuddesdon he had met Doreen Eda Laws when she was visiting the college; they married on 3 October 1928. From 1937 he was successively Archdeacon (1937–1944), Dean (1940–1951) and Bishop (1951–1966) of Christchurch.\nHis period of office as dean was interrupted by war service as a Chaplain to the Forces (Fourth Class) in the New Zealand Military Forces in 1944–45 during the Italian Campaign of World War II.  On 13 December 1945 he was awarded the Military Cross for sustained gallantry in ministering to the men of the 2nd New Zealand Division Cavalry Battalion and particularly for arranging and assisting in the evacuation of many casualties (under fire) on 17 April 1945 during the crossing of the Gaiana River. He was later wounded in the foot by German shellfire; this wound would trouble him for the rest of his life. In Christchurch, in addition to improving the decoration of the cathedral, he was involved in the civic life of the city, particularly the Rotary Club and the Order of Saint John. In 1956 he was appointed officer of the order, and in 1961 he was promoted to chaplain. In 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.\nLater life and death\nWarren's retirement as bishop was precipitated by Doreen suffering a stroke in 1964 which left her paralysed and unable to speak. He cared for her for the rest of her life.\nIn the 1967 New Year Honours, he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He died on 27 May 1988 in Christchurch.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://mp.natlib.govt.nz/detail/?id=24345&l=mi Photo of Warren]\n|-"
