It was conducted in nine single-member constituencies, four two-member constituencies, and three three-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to men who owned property. The electorates were also malapportioned to favour pastoral districts. This was the first election after the separation of Queensland in December 1859.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election; instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system. Members of the ministry generally identified as \"Squatter Conservatives,\" and the opposition was liberal in nature, and loosely led by the Liberal Association. Premier Robert Herbert was conservative and consistently supported by a majority of the Legislative Assembly, many of whom were graziers.\nKey dates\nDue to problems of distance and communications, it was not possible to hold the elections on a single day.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
