Owned and operated by EnergyAustralia, the station is the first of its type in New South Wales and produces electricity for the state during periods of high demand. It is located on the western shore of Lake Illawarra.\nThe power station comprises a  gas turbine and a  steam turbine unit and a separate 320 MW gas turbine, and has a total capacity of . It uses many of the previous power station's structures including the cooling system channels from Lake Illawarra. The power station is connected to the state grid via a 132&nbsp;kV switching station maintained by Endeavour Energy.\nHistory\nTallawarra originally operated as a coal-fired power station beginning in 1954 and reaching full operation by 1961. At its peak, it had a capacity output of . 'A' station had four  Thomson-Houston 2 stage (HP+LP) turbo generators. Steam was supplied by four Simon Carves pulverised fuel boilers at  at a pressure of  and a temperature of . In 1960 \"B\" station was built having two  English Electric 3-stage turbo generators (No. 5+6). The generators were hydrogen-cooled but didn't have any stator water cooling. Steam was supplied by 2 ICAL pulverised coal burning boilers at a rate of  at a pressure of  and a temperature of . The station closed in 1989, and stood abandoned by the foreshore of Lake Illawarra. It was demolished over a ten-year period.\nIn early 2003 the site was sold by Pacific Power to TRUenergy and construction of the gas-fired combined cycle plant began in November 2006. The plant consists of a gas turbine of  and a 3-stage steam turbine of  with a single 500 MVA generator. A unique feature is the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (waste heat boiler) with super heater and reheater sections for the HP, IP and LP stages of the turbine. Overall thermal efficiency is 60%. It was opened by Premier Nathan Rees on 18 March 2009.\nIn 2021 construction began on Stage B, a $300 million project with a 320 MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine Power Plant. It was commissioned in June 2024.\nReferences"
