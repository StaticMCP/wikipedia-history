A company of Texas Rangers under Lt. James O. Rice had pursued the Mexican agent Manuel Flores and his party of Mexicans and Indians, following their murder of four surveyors working between Seguin and San Antonio, Texas. Battle was commenced on the north San Gabriel River, after the 2 day pursuit. In the first charge, Flores was killed and his company fled, abandoning a supply train intended to equip the Indians of East Texas for a revolt against the Texians. In the captured baggage, Rice discovered letters between Flores and Vicente Córdova as well as instructions from Mexican general Valentín Canalizo, detailing the Córdova Rebellion. These letters contradicted The Bowl's previous denials of involvement with Córdova's revolt and led to the Cherokee War.\nA marker was placed near the site in 1936.\nSee also\n* Timeline of the Republic of Texas\n* Córdova Rebellion\n* Battle of the Neches\n* Mathew Caldwell\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* [http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/indian/early/page4.html \"Foreign Influences,\"] including Córdova's letter.
