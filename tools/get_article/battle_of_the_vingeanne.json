It occurred near the river of Vingeanne. It was one of the major battles of the Gallic Wars and was won by the Romans.\nPrelude\nGiven his losses after defeat in the Battle of Gergovia, Caesar ordered a retreat. In the wake of the battle, Caesar lifted the siege of Gergovia and retreated from the Arverni lands northeastwards in the direction of Aedui territory. Vercingetorix pursued Caesar's army, intent on destroying it. Meanwhile, Labienus had finished his campaign in the north and marched back to Agedincum, Caesar's base in the centre of Gaul. After linking up with Labienus's corps, Caesar marched his united army from Agedincum to confront Vercingetorix's victorious army.\nHe ordered to an attack against Gallia Narbonensis by leading his forces east through Lingones territory towards Sequani territory, probably marching down the Vingeanne valley. He had also recently recruited (or hired) German cavalry, and they would prove decisive.\nBattle\nThe Gallic army held a very strong position guarded by high slopes, easy to defend.\nIt was protected by the Vingeanne on the right, and the Badin, a small tributary of the Vingeanne, on its front.\nIn the space between these two streams and the road from Dijon to Langres was an area  across, slightly uneven in some parts, almost flat everywhere else, mainly between the Vingeanne and the hillock of Montsuageon. Near the road, and to the west, rise hills which dominated the ground, as well as the whole country, up to the Badin and the Vingeanne.\nThe Gauls thought the Romans were retreating towards Italy and decided to attack. One group of Gallic cavalry blocked the Roman advance while two groups of cavalry harried the Roman's flanks. After hard fighting, the Roman cavalry broke the Gallic cavalry on the right and chased them back to the main Gallic infantry force.\nAftermath\nThe remaining Gallic cavalry fled, and Vercingetorix was forced to retreat to Alesia, where he was besieged by the Romans. The Battle of Alesia decided the war in the Romans' favor and led to the capture and execution of Vercingetorix.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
