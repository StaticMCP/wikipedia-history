It is a standalone expansion of MechWarrior 4: Vengeance, based on the BattleTech/MechWarrior game universe. The game was developed by Cyberlore in tandem with FASA Studio. This studio would also be responsible for MechWarrior 4's previous expansion, Black Knight - as well as both the InnerSphere and Clan Mech Packs.\nMechwarrior 4: Mercenaries and Clan and Inner Sphere expansions were re-released for free. By April 22, 2010 Microsoft had cleared its free release and on April 30, MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries was released to the general public by MekTek as a free download. However, due to the massive influx of 100,000 downloads and web site accesses, MekTek.net and related services crashed. MekTek recovered the MekMatch match making service on May 1 and the forum was restored the next day.\nIn the following years, MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries was no longer available free. MekTek expressed their intent to move away from the BattleTech franchise, and a new group interested in maintaining free versions appeared but encountered difficulties securing permission to continue offering the game as a free download.\n| CGW =\n| GI = 9.5/10\n| GSpot = 7.8/10\n| GSpy =\n| GameZone = 9/10\n| IGN = 9.1/10\n| PCGUK = 83%\n| PCGUS = 85%\n| PCZone = 82%\n| XPlay =\n}}\nMercenaries received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot nominated the game for its annual \"Best Sci-Fi Simulation Game on PC\" award, which went to Star Trek: Bridge Commander. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, Mercenaries received a nomination for \"Computer Simulation Game of the Year\" by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  (archived)\n*\n* [https://archive.org/details/Mechwarrior4MercenariesDemo Demo version] at Internet Archive"
