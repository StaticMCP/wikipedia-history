It initially consisted of 43 (Wessex) Signal Squadron, 53 (Welsh) Signal Squadron and 57 (City & County of Bristol) Signal Squadron. In 1969, 67 (Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry) Signal Squadron joined the regiment.\nIn 1992, under Options for Change, 43 (Wessex) Squadron transferred to 21st (Air Support) Signal Regiment, 57 (City and County of Bristol) Squadron transferred to 71 Signal Regiment and 93 (East Lancashire) Squadron transferred from 38 Signal Regiment. In addition to squadron changes, the regimental title was changed when the regiment dropped the 'Wessex and Welsh' subtitle following the above changes. Therefore, it became known as the 37th Signal Regiment.\nIn 2006, 93 (East Lancashire) Squadron transferred back to 38 Signal Regiment.\nIn 2009, under a further re-organisation, 67 (Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry) Squadron was reduced to a troop (867 Troop) and 48 (City of Birmingham) Squadron joined the regiment on the disbandment of 35 (South Midlands) Signal Regiment. At the same time, 33 (Lancashire) Squadron was formed on the disbandment of 33 (Lancashire and Cheshire) Signal Regiment.\nIn 2014, under Army 2020, 53 (Welsh) Signal Squadron transferred to 39 (Skinners) Signal Regiment.\n2016 - Army Reserve 2020 plans detail the restructuring to Royal Signals Reserve units, with the Leeds Troop transferring to 64 Signal Squadron.\n2022 – Future Soldier programme saw the Regiment move from a UK Ops role and reduce its establishment to 409 (including the Royal Signals (Northern) Band; The Regiment is currently paired with 2nd Signal Regiment supporting 1st (United Kingdom) Division.\nStructure\nThe current structure of the regiment is as follows.\n* Regimental Headquarters, in Redditch\n**The Royal Signals (Northern) Band, at Bradford Armoury, Darlington\n* 33 (Lancashire and Cheshire) Signal Squadron, in Liverpool\n** 842 (City of Manchester) Signal Troop, in Manchester\n* 48 (City of Birmingham) Signal Squadron, in Birmingham\n** 896 (City of Coventry) Signal Troop, in Coventry\n** 898 Signal Troop\n** 897 (Staffordshire) Signal Troop, at MOD Stafford, Stafford\n* 50 (Northern) Signal Squadron, in Darlington\n** 834 (Northern) Signal Troop\n** 875 (City of Durham) Signal Troop\n** Kohima Troop, at Imphal Barracks, York\n* 64 (City of Sheffield) Signal Squadron, in Sheffield\n** 849 (City of Leeds) Signal Troop, in Leeds\n** 864 (City of Sheffield) Signal Troop\n** 887 (City of Nottingham) Signal Troop, in Nottingham\n* 54 (Queen's Own Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry) Support Squadron, in Redditch\n** 867 (Capability Development) Signal Troop\nSee also\n* Units of the Royal Corps of Signals\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.army.mod.uk/signals/25280.aspx 37 Signal Regiment] - on British Army official website"
