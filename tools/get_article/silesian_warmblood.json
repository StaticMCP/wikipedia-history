It originates in the historic region of Silesia in south-western Poland and is the heaviest of the Polish warmblood breeds. It has been influenced mainly by the Oldenburger, and to some extent also by the East Friesian, the Hanoverian and the Thoroughbred.\nHistory\nThe Silesian Warmblood originates in the historic region of Silesia, which lies mostly in the south-west of modern Poland. It is the heaviest of the Polish warmblood breeds, and also one of the largest of all European warmbloods. It derives from cross-breeding – particularly in the years after the Second World War – of the mares of the region with stallions of the Oldenburger of north-western Germany, with some input also from East Friesian, Hanoverian and Thoroughbred stallions.\nRecords of this type of horse have been kept since the late nineteenth century; the stud-book dates from 1961. In 1993 there were approximately  of the horses, but numbers declined sharply. In 2023 the total number for the old type of the breed was reported at  head, with  brood-mares and 318 stallions at stud. For the new type, the total number was given in 2022 as , with  brood-mares and 270 active stallions. The conservation status of both types was \"at risk\".\nCharacteristics\nTwo types are recognised within the breed, an old and a new; the old type is more heavily built, the new type somewhat lighter and taller. At 3 years old, stallions of the old type stand some  at the withers, mares about  less; the girth is , and the cannon-bone circumference some . The new or racing type is taller and lighter, stallions standing  at the withers and mares about  less; the girth measures  and the cannon-bone ; weights average about  for stallions and some  for mares.\nUse\nIt is a large horse with considerable pulling power. It may be used for riding, as a coach horse, or in cross-breeding to conserve coach horse breeds or strains.\nReferences\n. Archived 23 June 2020.\n}}"
