Connected by a short causeway and bridge, Lennox Island is home to the Lennox Island First Nation, of the Mi'kmaq people. The Mi'kmaq name for the island is ''L'nui Minegoo, and it has been informally known by European settlers as Indian Island''.\nLennox Island is approximately 520 hectares in area.\nMost of the trees on the island are spruce, with some groves of birch trees and many different types of berries.\nThe historic St. Anne Catholic Mission is located on the island.\nAs of 1988, the population on the island was 239 and the largest commercial activities were peat moss and blueberry production.\nAccording to the Canadian census, the island's population was 323 in 2016 and 308 in 2021.\nThe Minigoo Fishery (located on Lennox Island) was the first Lobster processing plant owned and operated by indigenous people in Canada in 2010. It later closed its doors and sought bankruptcy protection. It reopened in May 2013.\nDue to erosion from rapidly rising ocean levels, it has been estimated that half of Lennox Island will disappear by approximately 2065.\nReferences"
