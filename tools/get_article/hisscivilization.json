It has been retroactively praised as his most experimental, ambitious and elaborate output. It is also almost entirely sung in English, like his previous album Plastic Soda.\n\"Exactly\" was re-recorded for his subsequent collaborative album with Bibmo, Bitter.\nComposition\nOn Hisscivilization, Basso was influenced by the early output of Pink Floyd and particularly Syd Barrett, the Canterbury scene—especially Soft Machine member Kevin Ayers and his 1970 album Shooting at the Moon—and Stereolab, the latter of whom maintained an influence on psychedelic indie acts in the turn of the millennium. It is characterized by the inclusion of electronic instrumentation, absent in Jupiter Apple's previous two releases, in a move that polarized critics and fans alike.\nCritical reception\nThe album was well-received upon its release, but many critics did not gravitate towards its heavily experimental sonority and long length. Writing for AllMusic, François Couture gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying it is \"filled with catchy hooks, intriguing twists and self-indulgent stretches\", and comparing Jupiter Apple with Cornelius and Beck. However, he also said that \"the album's only flaw is its duration – problem is, it's a big one. Not only does Hisscivilization clock in at 78 minutes, but most of its 13 tracks could have been substantially shortened\". Matheus Donay of O Notório Abacaxi praised the album for its \"Futuristic and Surrealist artfulness\", but also criticized it for its length and stated that it requires \"lots of patience\" to listen to.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Jupiter Apple – vocals, electric guitar, classical guitar, percussion, Moog, production, mixing\n* Thomas Dreher – production, mixing, mastering\n* Fernando Sanches – engineering\nReferences"
