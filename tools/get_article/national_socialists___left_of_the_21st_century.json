In the year 2012, the party had two representatives in the 200-seat Chamber of Deputies, Paroubek and Jiří Šlégr (ex-ČSSD).\nThe party name was a reference to the historical popular-socialist Czech National Social Party, founded in 1897, and as such they did not advocate for German Nazism. National Socialists wanted to follow up the tradition of the left-wing Czechoslovak independence movement in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Nevertheless, in the 2017 Czech legislative election, LEV 21 allied with the Czech Neo-Nazi party,  Workers' Party of Social Justice.\nIn 2011, the Paroubek's National Socialists wanted to merge with the Czech National Socialist Party, so that Paroubek's party would have historical succession with the original Czech National Social Party, but the parties ultimately did not legally merge, only some Czech National Socialist Party members switched to the Paroubek's National Socialists.\nOn 28 May 2022, the National Socialists, and also the Czech National Socialist Party, \"merged\" into the original Czech National Social Party (the party dissolved and its members re-registered as members of the original Czech National Social Party).\nElection results\nChamber of Deputies\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Date\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Leader\n! colspan=\"2\"| Votes\n! colspan=\"2\"| Seats\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Position\n|-\n! #\n! %\n! #\n!
