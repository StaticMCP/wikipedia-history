Stromatolites are found offshore of the island.\nA map of 1823 shows it was actually named, “Leeward Stocking Island”. In the days before Google Earth, map makers drew it as a stocking. Upwind towards the predominant South East Tradewinds was “Windward Stocking”. Later in 1898, the name was noted as “Leonard Stocking Island”.\nReferences"
