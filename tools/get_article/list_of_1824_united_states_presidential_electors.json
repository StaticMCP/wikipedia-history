      "text": "# List of 1824 United States presidential electors\n\nThis is a list of electors (members of the Electoral College) who cast ballots to elect the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the 1824 presidential election.\nOf the 261 electoral votes cast, 99 went to Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, 84 to John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, 41 to William H. Crawford of Georgia, and 37 to Henry Clay of Kentucky. All were members of the Democratic-Republican Party.\nFor the second time in United States history, no presidential candidate won a majority of the Electoral College, throwing the race to a contingent election in the U.S. House of Representatives. (Vice presidential candidate John C. Calhoun did win a majority in the Electoral College and did not face a similar contingent election in the U.S. Senate.) While Andrew Jackson had led in both the popular and electoral vote, the House of Representatives voted to name John Quincy Adams president.\nIn the contingent election, seven states' House delegations voted for a candidate who had not won all or most of their state's electoral votes. Illinois, Louisiana, and Maryland each went for Jackson in the Electoral College, but Adams in the House. North Carolina gave all 15 of its electoral votes to Jackson, but its House delegation voted for Crawford. Kentucky, Missouri, and Ohio all favored Clay in the Electoral College but Adams in the House. (The rules for contingent elections allowed only the top three in the electoral vote to advance, leaving Clay out. He threw his support to Adams, who later named Clay his secretary of state. Jackson partisans labeled this a \"corrupt bargain.\")\nJackson's plurality was a result of the Three-fifths Compromise, which let slave states count 60% of its enslaved population in calculating its House representation, thus inflating their share of Electoral College votes. If only the free population of states had been counted, Adams would have edged Jackson 83 to 77.\nUnusually, two candidates — Jackson and Clay — received electoral votes for both president and vice president.\nThe two vice presidential votes for Martin Van Buren meant this Electoral College cast votes for the sixth (Adams), seventh (Jackson), and eighth (Van Buren) presidents. Jackson, angered at having been denied the 1824 election, ran again against Adams in 1828 and defeated him handily. He won reelection against Clay in 1832, with Van Buren as his running mate. Van Buren was then elected president in 1836 before losing reelection to William Henry Harrison in 1840.\nAlabama\nAll 5 of Alabama's electors voted for Andrew Jackson for president and John C. Calhoun for vice president.\n#Henry H. Chambers\n#William Fleming\n#James Hill\n#John Murphy\n#Reuben Saffold\nConnecticut\nAll 8 of Connecticut's electors voted for John Quincy Adams for president and Andrew Jackson for vice president.\n#David Hill\n#Rufus Hitchcock\n#David Keyes\n#John Swathel\n#Moses Warren\n#Lemuel White\n#Calvin Willey\n#Oliver Wolcott Jr.\nDelaware\nTwo of Delaware's electors voted for William H. Crawford for president, while one voted for John Quincy Adams. For vice president, Henry Clay received two electoral votes — the only ones he received for vice president — while John C. Calhoun received one. There is no known record indicating which electors voted for which. However, a news account describing the three men's selection by the Delaware General Assembly listed Rowland as an Adams supporter, Tunnell as a Crawford supporter, and Caldwell as a Clay supporter.\n#John Caldwell\n#Joseph G. Rowland\n#Isaac Tunnell\nGeorgia\nAll 9 of Georgia's electors voted for William H. Crawford for president and Martin Van Buren for vice president. These were the only electoral votes Van Buren received.\n#Elias Beall\n#Thomas Cumming\n#John Floyd\n#John Harden\n#Warren Jourdan\n#John MacIntosh\n#William Matthews\n#John Rutherford\n#William Terrell\nIllinois\nTwo Illinois electors, Henry Eddy and Alexander Pope Field, voted for Andrew Jackson, while William Harrison voted for John Quincy Adams. (Harrison should not be confused with future president William Henry Harrison, who was an 1824 elector from Ohio.) All three voted for John C. Calhoun as vice president.\n#Henry Eddy\n#Alexander Pope Field\n#William Harrison\nIndiana\nAll five Indiana electors voted for Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun.\n#John Carr\n#Jonathan MacCarty\n#Elias McNamee\n#Samuel Milroy\n#David Robb\nKentucky\nFor president, Kentucky's 14 electors voted for Henry Clay.

Osborn, Thomas Post, William Tyler, and George Winchester — voted for Andrew Jackson for president. Three — Henry Brawner, Littleton Dennis, and John C. Herbert — voted for John Quincy Adams. One, James Sangston, voted for William H. Crawford. For vice president, 10 of the 11 electors voted for John C. Calhoun, with the 11th choosing Andrew Jackson. There is no known record indicating which elector chose Jackson for vice president, though Herbert is described in contemporary news coverage as a Jackson/Calhoun supporter who was elected from an Adams-majority district as a result of two Adams candidates splitting the vote.\n#Henry Brawner\n#William Brown\n#Dennis Claude\n#Littleton Purnell Dennis\n#John C. Herbert\n#Thomas Hope\n#Samuel G. Osborn\n#Thomas Post\n#James Sangston\n#William Tyler\n#George Winchester\nMassachusetts\nAll 15 Massachusetts electors voted for John Quincy Adams and John C.

Crawford, 4 votes for Henry Clay, and 1 vote for Andrew Jackson. For vice president, they cast 29 votes for John C. Calhoun and 7 for Nathan Sanford. (There were two different electors named Isaac Sutherland — one from Dutchess County and one from Genesee County.\nThere is no known record indicating which electors voted for which candidate in either race, but in news coverage before the vote, the men's preferences were listed as follows: Adams supporters (25): Blanvelt, Coffin, Coon, Clark Crandall, Edward Crandall, Dorr, James Drake, John Drake, Hicks, Lawyer, Mooers, Patterson, Sage, Savage, Azariah Smith, Benjamin Smith, Burnham, St. John, Stagg, Strong, Sutherland (Dutchess), Sutherland (Genesee), Townsend, Walsh, and Willet; Clay supporters (7): Barker, Bentley, Brooks, Porter, Russell, Sibley, and Thompson; Crawford supporters (4): Bailey, Cady, Lansing, and Samuel Smith.\nMost records list Ebenezer Sage and Timothy H. Porter as electors, but contemporary news reports say neither one appeared on the day of the state's Electoral College vote. Sage sent a letter stating that \"through age and ill health, he was unable to attend\" the proceedings. The other electors selected John Taylor and William Mann to fill their positions, and the two men cast votes in Sage's and Taylor's place.\n#Benjamin Bailey\n#Pierre A.
