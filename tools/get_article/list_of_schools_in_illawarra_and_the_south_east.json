The New South Wales education system traditionally consists of primary schools, which accommodate students from Kindergarten to Year 6 (ages 5–12), and high schools, which accommodate students from Years 7 to 12 (ages 12–18).\nPublic schools\nPrimary schools (K–6)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

rural district, covers Kindergarten to Year 12. An additional class of high schools has emerged in recent years as a result of amalgamations which have produced multi-campus colleges consisting of Junior and Senior campuses.\nWhile most schools are comprehensive and take in all students of high school age living within the defined school boundaries, some schools are either specialist in a given Key Learning Area, or selective in that they set examinations or other performance criteria for entrance. In the Illawarra and South East regions, Karabar (in Queanbeyan) and Smith's Hill (in Wollongong) are selective, whilst Wollongong High School of the Performing Arts and Illawarra Sports High School are specialist.\nApproximately 2,000 New South Wales students attend schools in the Australian Capital Territory. The Territory has its own education system separate from the New South Wales system. Students who take this option may still apply to enrol in a New South Wales university through the University Admissions Centre upon completing year 12.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

New South Wales, Catholic primary schools are usually (but not always) linked to a parish. Prior to the 1970s, most schools were founded by religious institutes, but with the decrease in membership of these institutes, together with major reforms inside the church, lay teachers and administrators began to take over the schools, a process which completed by approximately 1995. The Catholic Education Office (CEO), located in the Canberra-Goulburn and Broken Bay dioceses of the Church, is responsible for coordinating administration, curriculum and policy across the Catholic school system. Preference for enrolment is given to Catholic students from the parish or local area, although non-Catholic students are admitted if room is available.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Name\n!
