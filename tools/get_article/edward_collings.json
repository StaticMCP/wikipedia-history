He was born at Lichfield, Staffordshire and died at Combe Down, Bath, Somerset.\nCollings was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler. It is not known what his bowling style was, but in his two matches in 1925, he opened the bowling for Somerset. His only bowling success came in the match against Essex at Leyton: he took two for 125, his wickets being top-order batsmen Laurie Eastman and John Freeman, but Essex amassed a total of 433 and won by an innings. His batting was negligible, and his highest score was just 16, made in the match against Leicestershire in 1921.\nReferences"
