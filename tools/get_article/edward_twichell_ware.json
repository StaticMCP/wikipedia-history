Ware graduated from Yale College in 1897, and returned to Atlanta University to help in fundraising efforts. Students perceived Ware as being different from other white people, because he extended common courtesies to black students. His father was Edmund Asa Ware, the first president of Atlanta University.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
