It honours soap operas and their cast members. Since 2024, the majority of the awards are voted for by a panel of industry professionals, while certain awards including Best Soap and Best Actor are voted for by the general public.\nBackground\nOn 1 November 2023, it was announced that for only the third time in their 24-year history, The British Soap Awards would not be taking place in 2024, (twice previously due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\nA month later, the inaugural RadioTimes Soap Awards were launched, despite having been previously awarded in 2020, also in response to the cancellation of that year's British Soap Awards.The 2024 award categories precisely mirrored those of the postponed British Soap Awards, but resurrected the Best Exit Award which was last conferred by the latter in 2013.\nWinners\n2020\nIn response to the cancellation of the British Soap Awards due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Radio Times launched its own soap awards in May of this year. It consisted of just five categories, all of which were decided by public poll and awarded online as in-person ceremonies were largely prohibited. Australian soap opera Neighbours took all five awards when the results were announced in June of that year.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Award !! Winners !!
