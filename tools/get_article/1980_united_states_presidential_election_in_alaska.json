Voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nAlaska was easily won by Ronald Reagan (R&ndash;CA) with 54.3% of the popular vote over incumbent President Jimmy Carter (D&ndash;GA)'s 26.4%.  Alaska has only voted Democratic once in its history, in 1964 amidst a national Democratic landslide. With Reagan overwhelmingly winning the national election in 1980, the state fell safely into the Republican column.\nLibertarian candidate Ed Clark had his strongest showing in Alaska and set the record for the best performance of a Libertarian presidential candidate on a statewide level.  He also beat independent candidate John B. Anderson in this state, despite Anderson winning more votes than Clark nationally. In part due to the strong showings of both Clark and Anderson, Carter's vote share remains the lowest for any Democrat in Alaska history. Reagan was the first Republican to ever win without Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area, Northwest Arctic Borough, and Dillingham Census Area.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1980 United States presidential election in Alaska\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Ronald Reagan\n| align=\"right\" | 86,112\n| align=\"right\" | 54.35%\n| align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Jimmy Carter (inc.)\n| align=\"right\" | 41,842\n| align=\"right\" | 26.41%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FFCC00; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Libertarian\n| Ed Clark\n| align=\"right\" | 18,479\n| align=\"right\" | 11.66%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#DDDDDD; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent\n| John B.
