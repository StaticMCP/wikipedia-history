The Communist Party of Venezuela also denounced surveillance by the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service on their headquarters in Puerto Cabello.\nThe parties that have formed the APR claim that the difficulties the Venezuelan economy is going through are due to the structural crisis of capitalism, intensified by the \"economic asphyxiation of US imperialism.\" The coalition denounces high costs of living, low salaries, and the rampant speculation & corruption in Venezuela currently, as well as opposing the adoption of unpopular measures by the \"social-democratic\" government that leads the PSUV. The APR stands for a \"revolutionary way out\" of the crisis in the country.\n2020 parliamentary elections\nWithin the framework of the 2020 elections to the National Assembly, the Popular Revolutionary Alternative will be using the electoral ticket of the Communist Party of Venezuela, the only ticket which the government has authorized to run legally.\nDuring the campaign, various candidates and leaders of the APR have been subject to arrests and death threats.\nCoalition parties\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto\"\n!
