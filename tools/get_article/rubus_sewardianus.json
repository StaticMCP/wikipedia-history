      "text": "# Rubus sewardianus\n\nRubus sewardianus is a rare North American species of brambles in the rose family. It has been found only in the state of Virginia in the eastern United States.\nThe genetics of Rubus is extremely complex, so that it is difficult to decide on which groups should be recognized as species. There are many rare species with limited ranges such as this. Further study is suggested to clarify the taxonomy.\nReferences"
