On April 25, 2022, the FCC announced the suspension of the awards citing fears of \"unintentionally\" violating the city's National Security Law, leading to the resignation of 8 members from the organization's Press Freedom Committee and public criticism.\nAfter the FCC announcement, US-based nonprofit The Campaign for Hong Kong's President Samuel Chu announced his organization would step in to honor the 2022 winners in a virtual ceremony on May 10, 2022.\nContent\nPast recipients have been from all over the world, have worked for various international media organizations, and have covered various countries, mostly in Southeast Asia and China. These include local journalists from the South China Morning Post, regional media like Radio Free Asia  and The Far Eastern Economic Review, and international media like the Wall Street Journal.\nWorks are not restricted to those from or about Hong Kong, though the awards do emphasize Hong Kong's place as a model of free speech in the area.\nGuests speakers have included activists like John Kamm, who works with China to improve its human rights record, and Cardinal Joseph Zen, the highest-ranking Catholic prelate in greater China.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.humanrightspressawards.org Hong Kong Human Rights Press Awards]\n* [http://www.fcchk.org Foreign Correspondents' Club, Hong Kong]\n* [https://www.amnesty.org.hk Amnesty International Hong Kong]\n* [http://www.hkja.org.hk Hong Kong Journalists Association]"
