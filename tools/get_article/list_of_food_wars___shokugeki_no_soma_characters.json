The series primarily takes place at the Totsuki Saryo Culinary Institute, an extremely competitive culinary school. it appears to be about 1%, as Dean Senzaemon says in his opening speech that in the last year, of 812 entering freshman, only 76 made it to the second year, and that the number of students who graduate each year can be counted on one hand.}} Students are judged on their cooking in events such as shokugeki (food war), a cooking duel.\nThe story follows teenage transfer student Soma Yukihira. Some students start as rivals and antagonists, especially Erina Nakiri, but later become allies in the 16th tankōbon volume with the arrival of Azami Nakiri. After the 30th tankōbon volume, a group of chefs called Le Cuisine Noir are introduced. It also includes characters from the epilogue chapters of Le Dessert.\nDevelopment\nWhen asked at Anime Expo about the diversity of characters, series creator Yuto Tsukuda said, \"That was very important to me. I wanted the younger readers experiencing this manga to learn about different types of food and culture from different countries. I thought it would be great if kids reading the manga could grow up, travel the world, see unique dishes and remember, 'I saw that in Food Wars! when I was a kid.'\"\nThe concept of the clothes falling off originated from \"the idea of a girl eating food, and she expresses herself about the food with 'ecstasy',\" but Tsukuda also realized early on that it meant they could also portray the male characters with clothes removed.\nAt Crunchyroll Expo 2019, Tsukuda said that he originally wanted to end the series soon after the central arc, since it had shown the growth of the key characters, citing \"Soma's mental growth, Megumi's achievement of independence and Erina's development.\" However, he had doubts with have to resolve the relationship between Soma and Erina, so he rewrote the epilogue chapter for that several times before settling with the final.\nMain characters\nSoma Yukihira\n:\nis a 15-year-old chef who has been working at his father Joichiro's diner, Yukihira Family Restaurant, since he was a young child.

Her shyness and stage fright causes her to perform poorly. Tsukuda said that \"Megumi Tadokoro is probably from some area in Tohoku Prefecture and has a slight Tohoku dialect, but I purposefully obscured it. This is because I don't necessarily want her to be seen as a stereotype. I actually got a comment from someone living in Tohoku who mentioned that her Aomori dialect is not right.\".\nSupporting characters\nPolaris Dormitory\nPolaris Dormitory is a student residence within Totsuki, intended to house less affluent students.
