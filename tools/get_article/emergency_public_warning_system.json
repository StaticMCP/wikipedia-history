      "text": "# Emergency Public Warning System\n\nThe Emergency Public Warning System was a system used in the province of Alberta, Canada until June 28, 2011, whereby local or provincial authorities could warn the public about impending or current emergencies affecting their area. The system was proposed by the provincial government after an F4 tornado ripped through Edmonton, Alberta on July 31, 1987, killing 27 people and causing millions of dollars in damage.\nThe EPWS could be activated by local police, fire, and environmental agencies; by Environment Canada; and by other provincial and local authorities as required. It could be activated for any of the following reasons:\n*Severe weather\n*Flood\n*Wildfire\n*Hazardous material release\n*Terrorist threat\n*Water contamination\n*Amber alert\n*Other threats to life, property and safety.\nThe EPWS was originally operated by the CKUA Radio Network, but was later operated by Black Coral Inc., a private company headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario. It was rebroadcast through various television and radio stations and cable systems provincewide.\nIn 2011, it was replaced by Alberta Emergency Alert.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516201541/http://www.ckua.com/epws/onscreen.htm Emergency Public Warning System Website] at CKUA Radio via the Internet Archive as of May 2008\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111202022810/http://www.aema.alberta.ca/ps_emergency_public_warning_system.cfm EPWS Website] at the Government of Alberta via the Internet Archive as of December 2011"
