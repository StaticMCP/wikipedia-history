He served as Grand Chancellor of Northern Song at its fall in 1127. He was also a general and a famous poet, having written over 1600 literary works.\nBiography\nHe claimed to be descended from Emperor Ai of Tang, the last Emperor of Tang through a son named Li Xizhao (李熙照).\nIn 1127, Emperor Qinzong appointed the Li Gang to lead the Song military to fend off the Jurchens, but Qinzong removed Li Gang from his appointment in the hope of starting peace talks with the Jurchens and sent his younger brother Zhao Gou to negotiate. The negotiation worked but not before Zhao Gou was taken hostage, ransomed, and released. Despite this, the Jurchens renewed their war again due to Emperor Qinzong's decisions. Since Emperor Qinzong sent his generals to other parts of the country, Li Gang himself included, he was not captured during the Jingkang Incident but Emperor Qinzong was captured.\nZhao Gou later became Emperor Gaozong in June 1127.\nLi Gang became Emperor Gaozong's chancellor and was responsible for pressuring him to execute Zhang Bangchang because Li Gang opposed diplomatic action with the Jurchens.\nWhen one of Li Gang's guerrilla forces, the Red Scarf Army, scored a major victory against the Jin troops and almost captured their commander-in-chief, Gaozong dismissed the minister. The dismissal of Li Gang is seen as implying that Gaozong did not really want to win this battle.\nReferences"
