It was located within a squatted building on the Old Kent Road in the London Borough of Southwark during the mid-1980s, and was set up by the experimental music group Bourbonese Qualk.\nHistory\nThe building, designed by W. E. Riley, was built as a fire station by London County Council between 1903 and 1904. It replaced an older engine-house from 1869. The council acquired the neighbouring buildings to this older station and demolished them all to make space for the new one. Once constructed, it was in use by the Fire Brigade until 1969, when it was closed after a new station was built on Cooper's Road. It is Grade II listed.\nAnarchist music group Bourbonese Qualk set up The Ambulance Station in the then abandoned five-story building at 306 Old Kent Road. The top two floors of the squat were converted into artist studios. There were living quarters on the middle floor. The first floor included a cafe and meeting places for local anarchist groups. The ground floor was a large performance space, a recording studio, and print workshops.\nCanadian hardcore punk band D.O.A played a benefit for anarchist prisoners there on 29 February 1984.\nThe 1984 Stop the City demonstration was planned in a meeting at the building. The squat also organised a benefit gig which raised £300 and saw performances by Flux of Pink Indians, Kukl (featuring a teenaged Björk) and Flowers in the Dustbin.\nScottish post-punk band The Jesus & Mary Chain played there on 23 November 1984, often given as an example of their early gigs ending with tension, \"riots\" or violence. Also playing that night were The June Brides and Revolving Paint Dream. It was the first time seeing the Mary Chain for Geoff Travis after which he signed them to Blanco y Negro. Members of The Go-Betweens were present.\nC86 band Stump played their first gig there on 24 August 1985.\nOther bands to play included The Television Personalities, Chumbawamba, Pulp, The Mekons, The Wedding Present, Felt, Conflict, Crass, The Butthole Surfers, Primal Scream, The Boo Radleys, Swans, Antisect, Biff Bang Pow!, Jasmine Minks, The Revolving Paint Dream, and King Kurt.\nReferences"
