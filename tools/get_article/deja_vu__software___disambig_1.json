It facilitates database-supported translation.\nDevelopment and marketing of this translation environment tool (TEnT) is handled by Atril, which has its international headquarters in Paris, France.\nThe latest major release of the software is Déjà Vu X3, released in July 2015, with [https://atril.com/download-and-install/ Déjà Vu X3 9.0.807] being the most recent point release, released in March 2022.\nHistory\nThe first version of Déjà Vu was published in 1993 and used the Microsoft Word interface. In 1996, this approach was abandoned, and the software was given its own program interface.\nIn 2004, the founder Emilio Benito died and his son, Daniel Benito, Head of R&D and Déjà Vu co-creator, continued running the company. Beginning in March 2009, PowerLing became the exclusive distributor for Déjà Vu in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. They began operating in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in April, and in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the US and Canada in July. In January 2011, Powerling increased ATRIL's capital by taking out a controlling stake.\nDéjà Vu has been one of the leading CAT (Computer Assisted Translation) tools for many years along with SDL Trados, Wordfast and others.\nSupported source document formats\nDéjà Vu can process many file formats: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, also embedded objects, and Access), Help Contents (CNT), FrameMaker (MIF), Adobe PageMaker, QuarkXPress, QuickSilver/Interleaf ASCII, Java Properties (.properties), HTML, HTML Help, XML, RC, C/Java/C++, IBM TM/2, Trados Workbench, Trados BIF (old TagEditor), Trados TagEditor, JavaScript, VBScript, ODBC, TMX, EBU, InDesign (TXT, ITD, INX, IDML), GNU GetText (PO/POT), OpenOffice, OpenDocument SDLX (ITD), ResX, XLIFF (XLF, XLIF, XLIFF, MQXLIFF, unsegmented and segmented SDLXLIFF), Visio (VDX), PDF, Transit NXT PPF, WordFast Pro TXML, SubRip, TIPP, YAML.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://atril.com/ Company website]"
