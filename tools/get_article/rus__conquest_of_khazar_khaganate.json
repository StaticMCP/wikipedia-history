Having learned of this, the Khazar Khagan, together with his army, went to meet Svyatoslav, but the Rus' defeated him and took Sarkel. After Svyatoslav besieged Itil and took it, the Jews living there decided to make a sortie, but were completely defeated by the army of Kievan Rus'. Afterwards Svyatoslav moved to the Terek, to the city of Semender, having defeated it, he took the spoils and went across the Don to Rus'.\nAftermath\nAs a result of this campaign, the Khazar Khaganate ceased to exist, and the Jews who lived there began to settle in other territories. Rus' became independent from the Khazar Khaganate and the largest cities of the Khazars have been looted. But it is noted that the centers of the Khazar state remained until the 11th century.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
