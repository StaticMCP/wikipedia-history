While Gordon became a household name among NASCAR fans for his driving career in the Cup Series, he has introduced the sport to a wider audience, largely through the media of the United States.\nTopics\nArt\nThroughout his NASCAR Cup Series career, Gordon had a partnership with artist Sam Bass. They met in 1992, when DuPont chose a rainbow design Bass created to become Gordon's primary paint scheme. Bass designed several paint schemes for Gordon, including fantasy designs used on die-cast. Bass also worked on the designs of the No. 24 team's racing suits and haulers. Bass' first painting of Gordon, Rookie Sensation!, was made in 1993.\nGordon has been featured in several paintings by [http://www.garryhill.com Garry Hill], notably Brickyard Thunder, based on Gordon's victory in the 1994 Brickyard 400. Gordon is included in some of Hill's All-Star Race painting series, which Hill began in 1987. Hill has also designed cover art for race programs. Gordon is listed as a collector of Hill's work on the artist's website.\nGordon's colorful No. 24 DuPont Chevrolet Monte Carlo is featured in several paintings by [http://marclacourciere.com Marc Lacourciere].\nGordon is the subject of a 1998 painting by LeRoy Neiman.\nFrom 1999 to 2012, designer Aaron Decarlo worked with Gordon on special paint schemes and program cars.\nIn 2007, Daytona International Speedway officials hired a local sand sculptor to create a NASCAR-themed depiction of Mount Rushmore in the fanzone, featuring the faces of Dale Earnhardt Jr.; Gordon; Jimmie Johnson; and Tony Stewart. In 2008, NASCAR Illustrated recruited Brooklyn-based artist [http://www.jimcookeart.com Jim Cooke] to create a Hendrick Motorsports-themed illustration of Mount Rushmore for the magazine's October issue. The cover art features the faces of HMS' 2009 driver lineup: Gordon; Johnson; Earnhardt Jr.; and Mark Martin.\n[https://www.billpattersonart.com Bill Patterson], who has been live painting races at Phoenix Raceway since 2006, created two pieces based on Gordon's 2007 victory at the track: his late race pass on Tony Stewart and his victory lap tribute to Dale Earnhardt.\nTuscaloosa, Alabama-based artist [https://rickrushart.com Rick Rush] created a painting titled Finishing Strong (2008), which was presented to the United States Sports Academy's American Sport Art Museum & Archives in 2017. The piece features the vehicles of Johnson; Gordon; and Earnhardt Jr.\nA floral version of Gordon's rainbow No. 24 car–along with Richard Petty's blue No. 43 and Dale Earnhardt's black No. 3–will be featured in a NASCAR-themed float at the 134th Rose Parade on January 2, 2023 in Pasadena, California. Titled \"Always Forward\", and described as a nod to its parade's theme–\"Turning the Corner\", the display will be used to celebrate NASCAR's 75th anniversary and promote the 2nd running of the Busch Light Clash at The Coliseum on February 5, 2023.\nFilmography\nGordon has made cameo appearances as both himself and fictional characters in films and television series.\nFilm\nWhen asked about plans to star in a film in 2001, Gordon responded \"Heck no.\"|group=N}} He was reportedly attached to Race Jam, a cancelled film which would have been a NASCAR-themed spin-off to Space Jam. Gordon ultimately signed with Warner Bros. and made his feature film debut through a cameo appearance in Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003). He shot his Back in Action scene in Las Vegas a day after his victory at Kansas Speedway in 2002. His #24 Dupont Chevrolet Monte Carlo also makes an appearance in the film where it gets stolen by Yosemite Sam, Nasty Canasta, and Cottontail Smith in an attempt to chase down Damian Drake, Kate Houghton, Bugs Bunny, and Daffy Duck who have recently won a playing card. Gordon made an uncredited cameo appearance in Taxi (2004), in which his girlfriend at the time  Ingrid Vandebosch played a bank robber, while he appears in the end of the film, shown challenging the protagonist Belle Williams to a race.\nGordon was interested in a role for the film Talladega Nights (2006), but declined an offer to participate due to concerns from his sponsors. However, Gordon invited actor Will Ferrell, who plays Ricky Bobby in the film, to accept his 11th-place reward at the 2005 Nextel Cup Series banquet at Waldorf Astoria New York, as Gordon was in Paris to compete in that year's Race of Champions.\nGordon voices the Cars character Jeff Gorvette in Cars 2 (2011) and Cars 3 (2017). Based on the Chevrolet Corvette C6.R, Gorvette is a primarily yellow racing car with the stars and stripes of the American flag painted on his sides. Like his voice actor, Gorvette uses the No. 24 in competition. Pixar has called Gordon a major inspiration for Cars 3. Gordon and his former crew chief Ray Evernham also served as story consultants for Cars 3.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:250px;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5px;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Role\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:500px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 2em;\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=row| Looney Tunes: Back in Action\n| 2003\n| Himself\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cameo\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| Taxi\n| 2004\n| Himself\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Uncredited cameo\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| Herbie: Fully Loaded\n| 2005\n| Himself\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cameo\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| Cars 2\n| 2011\n| Jeff Gorvette|group=N}}\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Voice role\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| Cars 3\n| 2017\n| Jeff Gorvette\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Voice role\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| Logan Lucky\n| 2017\n| Himself\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cameo\n|\n|}\nTelevision\nAs a child racer, Gordon was featured in segments on Kids Are People Too and PM Magazine, and was the subject of an episode for a series titled Super Kids. Gordon was featured on ESPN's SpeedWeek in 1985, making his first appearance on the network at age thirteen. He subsequently became a media sensation through the network's Thursday Night Thunder program, using his appearances in Thunder races to establish a national following.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:275px;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Role\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Network\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:500px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 2em;\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n!scope=row| A Current Affair\n| 1995\n| Himself (guest)\n| Syndicated\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|\n|-\n!scope=row| Late Show with David Letterman\n| 1995–2008\n| Himself (guest)\n| CBS\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Frequent appearances as guest\n|  He was subsequently interviewed by Letterman in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2001.
