The fleet, which had destroyed Portuguese fisheries, bombarded towns and cut off supplies in one month as part of its onslaught, proceeded to storm the fort on the Berlengas. The fort was destroyed and the entire garrison were captured.\nAfter the attack the repair of the fort was initiated, being concluded in 1678 by João de Mascarenhas, 1st Marquess of Fronteira.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Darwin Porter, Danforth Prince, ''Frommer's Portugal (2010)\n* Abigail Hole, Charlotte Beech, Portugal'' (2005)\n* Fernández Duro, Cesáreo: Armada española desde la unión de los reinos de Castilla y de León, Vol.5.
