On March 8, 1919, students from various high schools in the area secretly assembled and rallied down this alleyway — at the time a pine forest — and its 90-step stairs during the March 1st Independence Movement. The road is located near many other historical sites relevant to the March 1st Independence Movement and overarching independence struggle, including the new building of the Daegu First Presbyterian Church, the homes of the Christian missionaries from the U.S., and the home of Seo Sang-don, the leader of the National Debt Repayment Movement, which aimed to gain back Korean autonomy. Today, pictures from the March 1st Independence Movement and taegukgis (Korean flags) decorate the walls all along the road, and it is included in many Daegu tourist courses due to the road's significance.\n__TOC__\nBackground\nMarch 1st Independence Movement\nKorea had been under Japanese rule from 1910-1945. One of the earliest demonstrations of resistance occurred in 1919 with the March 1st Independence Movement.\nThe March 1st Independence Movement started on March 1, 1919, by which millions of Koreans assembled and marched, declaring Korean independence from Japan. These demonstrations occurred mostly in the capital Seoul, but also all throughout Korea, reaching all the way south to Busan. One of the active cities in this movement was Daegu of the Gyeongsang Province, with its own branch of the Independence Club as well as a women-led group called The Patriotic Women's Educational Society. On March 8, 1919, about 23,000 people protested in four major demonstrations across Daegu against the Japanese colonization of Korea, shouting “Mansae!\" or \"Long live Korean independence!\" and reading out the Declaration of Independence of Korea from Japan. These demonstrations were met with harsh violence from the Japanese police, with many citizens being injured and murdered.\nRevolt in Daegu\nImportant Actors\nChristians\nChristians played a considerable role in the March 1st Movement. This was true of the movement in Daegu as well, with many of its leaders and activists of Protestant faith. Churches were an active force in the independence movement, which explains the significance of the proximity of the Independence Road with the new building of Daegu First Presbyterian Church as well as the original homes of Christian missionaries.\n* Man-jip Lee was a minister at the First Presbyterian Church of Daegu, and the first president of Kyonam YMCA, where many Daegu youth organized campaigns for independence. He received the Declaration of Independence from a messenger from Seoul, and played a leading role during the protest on March 8. He was arrested by Japanese police for his involvement.\n* Tae-ryun Kim worked closely with missionaries and Man-jip Lee as the first manager of Kyonam YMCA. Kim received the Declaration of Independence from Lee and made copies in his home. He initiated the protest on March 8 by reading the Declaration of Independence, and his undying spirit even while being arrested ignited the passion of the remaining protesters. His son Yong-hae Kim was also arrested for his active involvement and became the first victim of the independence movement in Daegu after being tortured and killed by Japanese police.\nHigh School Students\nThe independence movement in Daegu was nicknamed \"the student movement\" for its significant participation of students. Of the nearly 1,000 people who protested on March 8, the majority were students from Keisung, Shinmyung, and Daegu high schools. Students left school early that day to come participate in the protest, some hiding as marketers in West Gate Market and some hiding from Japanese surveillance on the stairwell in the nearby pine forest, now known as the March 1st Independence Movement Road. The students were a crucial part in the longevity of the protest, as they continued on after the original leaders had gotten arrested, allowing the movement to spread to neighboring cities. Currently, there are monuments built at Shinmyung and Keisung schools to commemorate the students' involvement in the movement.\nSeo Sang-don\nSeo Sang-don was the leader of the National Debt Repayment Movement, which he started in the efforts to gain back Korean autonomy after Japan supplied a massive loan in the attempts to strengthen its control over Korea. Seo started the movement in Daegu, and it spread to the rest of the country as part of the larger independence movement. Seo's house is located near the March 1st Independence Movement Road, and is included along with the road in many tourist courses about the independence movement in Daegu.\nWomen\nWomen were particularly active in the Daegu efforts of the independence movement through the Patriotic Women's League, Korean Patriotic Women's Society, and the National Debt Repayment Movement. Shinmyung High School, of which students took an active part in the March 8 protest, was also an all-girls' school. The Patriotic Women's League and Korean Patriotic Women's Society were underground groups actively resisting Japanese colonization by mobilizing community members, raising money for campaigns, and organizing the March 1st movement, and were active in Daegu as well. Women were also key players in the National Debt Repayment Movement started by Seo Sang-don in Daegu. While Seo encouraged men to save money by giving up smoking, women contributed by donating jewelry.\n* Aengmu was a Kisaeng who initiated women's participation in the National Debt Repayment Movement. She donated her own jewelry and cash despite belonging to a lower class, and encouraged her peers to do the same. Many Kisaeng, as well as other women, followed in her footsteps, inspired by her boldness during a time when it was rare for women to be involved socially.\nTimeline\n*January 28 - February 28, 1919: Planning in Seoul\n**Earliest actors of support were Christians and practicers of Ch'ondogyo.\n**Declaration of Independence drafted.
