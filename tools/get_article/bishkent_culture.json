      "text": "# Bishkent culture\n\nThe Bishkent culture or Beshkent culture is a Bronze Age archaeological culture of southern Tajikistan, recently dated to c. 2800 – 2400 BC. It is primarily known from its cemeteries, which appear to have been used by mobile pastoralists, but currently considered to be a small group of people moving towards Tajikistan from Swat valley or Baluchistan, just as it was found in the early necropolis of Tulkhar.\nAccording to J. P. Mallory, \"the Bishkent culture has been seen as a possible contributor to the Swat culture, which in turn is often associated with early Indo-Aryan movements into northwest India.\"\nSee also\n* Vakhsh culture\n* Chust culture\n* Yaz culture\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
