      "text": "# Somogyvár-Vinkovci culture\n\nThe Somogyvár-Vinkovci culture was an Early Bronze Age archaeological culture in the Central Danube Carpathian Region.\nThis culture occurred in parallel with the Makó-Kosihy-Čaka cultural group. The period of its development covers the entire Early Bronze Age, from 2300/2200 BC to 1700/1600 BC (calibrated years). This culture occurs throughout most of Transdanubia, stretching beyond the Sava River in the south, encompassing a large part of Serbia and South Moravia, eastern Bosnia and Montenegro, reaching as far as the Adriatic coast. It was preceded by the Vučedol culture.\nThe end of this culture is not clear. According to N. Tasic, its decline would fall in the early stage of the development of the Encrusted Pottery culture and the Vatin culture. This is based on the presence of pottery typical of the population of the Somogyvár-Vinkovci culture in the inventories of the groups mentioned.\nGenetic profile\nAt Balatonkeresztúr-Réti-dűlő necropolis only one burial can be associated with this archaeological culture according to its 14C date (2560-2290 cal BCE).  The individual buried there was lying on his back and with the knees and head on the left side, oriented North/Northeast to South/Southwest. His Y-DNA belonged to halplogroup R-M417. Further examination confirmed negative placement under haplogroup R1a-V2670. The sample now on Y-Full is confirmed basal. His mitochondrial DNA matched haplogroup K1a3a.  His autosomal DNA composition was 17% hunter-gatherer, 40% European farmer, and 43% steppe ancestry. Some of his phenotypical traits were blond hair and blue eyes.\nBibliography\n*  [https://indo-european.eu/proto-indo-european-and-proto-uralic-dialects-and-peoples/ A Game of Clans], Carlos Quilles, Academia Prisca, 2019\n* Kultury z przełomu eneolitu i epoki brązu w strefie karpackiej, Jan Machnik, Zakład narodowy imienia Ossolińskich, Wydawnictwo Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Wrocław 1987\n* Stary i nowy świat (Od „rewolucji” neolitycznej do podbojów Aleksandra Wielkiego), pod red.
