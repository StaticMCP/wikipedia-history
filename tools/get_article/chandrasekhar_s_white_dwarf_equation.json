The equation reads as\n\\frac 1 {\\eta^2} \\frac d {d\\eta}\\left(\\eta^2 \\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\eta}\\right) + (\\varphi^2 - C)^{3/2} = 0\nwith initial conditions\n\\varphi(0)=1, \\quad \\varphi'(0)=0\nwhere \\varphi measures the density of white dwarf, \\eta is the non-dimensional radial distance from the center and C is a constant which is related to the density of the white dwarf at the center. The boundary \\eta=\\eta_\\infty of the equation is defined by the condition\n\\varphi(\\eta_\\infty) = \\sqrt{C}.\nsuch that the range of \\varphi becomes \\sqrt{C}\\leq\\varphi\\leq 1. This condition is equivalent to saying that the density vanishes at \\eta=\\eta_\\infty.\nDerivation\nFrom the quantum statistics of a completely degenerate electron gas (all the lowest quantum states are occupied), the pressure and the density of a white dwarf are calculated in terms of the maximum electron momentum p_0standardized as x = p_0 / mc, with pressure P = A f(x) and density \\rho = B x^3, where\n\\begin{align}\n& A = \\frac{\\pi m_\\text{e}^4 c^5}{3h^3} = 6.02\\times 10^{21} \\text{ Pa}, \\\\\n& B = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}m_p\\mu_\\text{e}\\left(\\frac{m_\\text{e} c}{h}\\right)^3 = 9.82\\times 10^8 \\mu_\\text{e} \\text{ kg/m}^3, \\\\\n& f(x) = x(2x^2-3)(x^2+1)^{1/2} + 3 \\sinh^{-1} x,\n\\end{align}\n\\mu_\\text{e} is the mean molecular weight of the gas, and h is the Planck constant.\nWhen this is substituted into the hydrostatic equilibrium equation\n\\frac 1 {r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{\\rho}\\frac{dP}{dr}\\right)=-4\\pi G \\rho\nwhere G is the gravitational constant and r is the radial distance, we get\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2\\frac{d\\sqrt{x^2+1}}{dr}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi G B^2}{2A}x^3\nand letting y^2 = x^2 + 1, we have\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2\\frac{dy}{dr}\\right)=-\\frac{\\pi G B^2}{2A}(y^2-1)^{3/2}\nIf we denote the density at the origin as \\rho_\\text{o} = B x_\\text{o}^3 = B (y_\\text{o}^2-1)^{3/2} , then a non-dimensional scale\nr = \\left(\\frac{2A}{\\pi G B^2}\\right)^{1/2} \\frac{\\eta}{y_\\text{o}}, \\quad y = y_\\text{o} \\varphi\ngives\n\\frac{1}{\\eta^2} \\frac{d}{d\\eta}\\left(\\eta^2 \\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\eta}\\right) + (\\varphi^2 - C)^{3/2} = 0\nwhere C=1/y_\\text{o}^2. In other words, once the above equation is solved the density is given by\n\\rho = B y_\\text{o}^3 \\left(\\varphi^2 - \\frac 1 {y_\\text{o}^2}\\right)^{3/2}.\nThe mass interior to a specified point can then be calculated\nM(\\eta) = -\\frac{4\\pi}{B^2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{\\pi G}\\right)^{3/2}\\eta^2\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\eta}.\nThe radius–mass relation of the white dwarf is usually plotted in the plane \\eta_\\infty–M(\\eta_\\infty).\nSolution near the origin\nIn the neighborhood of the origin, \\eta\\ll 1, Chandrasekhar provided an asymptotic expansion as\n\\begin{align}\n\\varphi = {} & 1 - \\frac{q^3} 6 \\eta^2 + \\frac{q^4}{40} \\eta^4 - \\frac{q^5(5q^2+14)}{7!} \\eta^6 \\\\[6pt]\n& {} + \\frac{q^6(339q^2 + 280)}{3\\times 9!}\\eta^8 - \\frac{q^7(1425q^4 + 11346q^2 + 4256)}{5\\times 11!}\\eta^{10} + \\cdots\n\\end{align}\nwhere q^2 = C-1. He also provided numerical solutions for the range C = 0.01 - 0.8 .\nEquation for small central densities\nWhen the central density \\rho_\\text{o} = B x_\\text{o}^3 = B (y_\\text{o}^2-1)^{3/2}  is small, the equation can be reduced to a Lane–Emden equation by introducing\n\\xi = \\sqrt{2}\\eta, \\qquad \\theta = \\varphi^2-C= \\varphi^2-1+x_\\text{o}^2 + O(x_\\text{o}^4)\nto obtain at leading order, the following equation\n\\frac{1}{\\xi^2}\\frac{d}{d\\xi}\\left(\\xi^2\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\xi}\\right) = - \\theta^{3/2}\nsubjected to the conditions \\theta(0)=x_\\text{o}^2 and \\theta'(0)=0. Note that although the equation reduces to the Lane–Emden equation with polytropic index 3/2, the initial condition is not that of the Lane–Emden equation.\nLimiting mass for large central densities\nWhen the central density becomes large, i.e., y_\\text{o}\\rightarrow \\infty or equivalently C\\rightarrow 0, the governing equation reduces to\n\\frac{1}{\\eta^2}\\frac{d}{d\\eta}\\left(\\eta^2\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\eta}\\right) = - \\varphi^{3}\nsubjected to the conditions \\varphi(0)=1 and \\varphi'(0)=0. This is exactly the Lane–Emden equation with polytropic index 3. Note that in this limit of large densities, the radius\nr = \\left(\\frac{2A}{\\pi G B^2}\\right)^{1/2} \\frac{\\eta}{y_\\text{o}}\ntends to zero. The mass of the white dwarf however tends to a finite limit\nM\\rightarrow - \\frac{4\\pi}{B^2}\\left(\\frac{2A}{\\pi G}\\right)^{3/2}\\left(\\eta^2 \\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\eta}\\right)_{\\eta=\\eta_\\infty}=5.75 \\mu_\\text{e}^{-2}M_\\odot.\nThe Chandrasekhar limit follows from this limit.\nSee also\n* Emden–Chandrasekhar equation\n* Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation\nReferences"
