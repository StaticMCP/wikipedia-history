The project was developed by Tacit Development Polska.\nThe tower includes 252 apartments ranging from , with a net total area of above-ground floors of as much as . Four penthouses are planned to be situated on the top floor. Its ground floor along Twarda Street is to provide commercial space for shops and services and its underground part has been designed to accommodate a 300-vehicle car park.\nThe first plans of building developed on this plot were revealed in 2006 when Foundation Shalom appointed leading Polish architect Stefan Kuryłowicz to design a tower. Soon after the Foundation was forced through lack of funds to sell the plot to Tacit Development. A new design was prepared by German architect Helmut Jahn. Up to 2011 Hines was the developer of the scheme, but Tacit, the investor behind the scheme, took it over.\nCosmopolitan Twarda 2/4 was the tallest completed residential building in Warsaw, and second in Poland (after Sky Tower in Wrocław). It fell to third place upon Złota 44's completion.\nSee also\n* List of tallest buildings in Poland\n* List of tallest buildings in Warsaw\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150105151245/http://www.hines.pl/hines_inwestycje_detail.php?select=twarda&lang=gb&city=warszawa Project on the Hines webpage]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120414222612/http://www.murphyjahn.com/RTW.html Project on architects' webpage]"
