Muslim personnel of the regiment were transferred to the Pakistan Army to form the Governor General's Bodyguard in Pakistan. The rest of the regiment,  comprising the Sikhs, Jats and Rajputs remained with the Indian Army. The Viceroy's gold-plated buggy was coveted by both India and Pakistan. Its fate was decided by a coin toss between Colonel Thakur Govind Singh (India) and Sahabzada Yaqub Khan (Pakistan) and India won the buggy.\nThe regiment would be renamed the President's Bodyguard when India became a republic on 26 January 1950.\nNames\nThe name of the regiment has changed throughout its history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Name\n|-\n| 1773 || Governor's Troop of Moghuls\n|-\n| 1784 || Governor-General's Bodyguard\n|-\n| 1859 || Viceroy's Body Guard\n|-\n| 1944 || 44th Divisional Reconnaissance Squadron\n|-\n| 1946 || Governor-General's Bodyguard\n|-\n| 1950 || President's Bodyguard\n|}\nStrength and ethnic composition\nThe President's Bodyguard is open to only Jats, Rajputs and Jat Sikh castes which are taken in equal numbers 33.3 percent from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The basic height requirement for enlistment is . The regiment also has an operational role and has small unit on rotation to high altitude area, such as, Siachin, East Ladakh and Sikkim. The NCOs, JCOs and Officers of the regiment are trained tank-man, paratroopers, and horse-riders. There are 100 horses in the regiment.\nBattle honours\nThe President's Bodyguard has inherited the following battle honours:\n* Java\n* Ava\n* Maharajpoor\n* Moodkee\n* Ferozeshah\n* Aliwal\n* Sobraon\nall of which, except for \"Java\", are considered to be repugnant and cannot be carried on regimental colours.\nOperational history\nThe President's Bodyguard has seen action in all of independent India's major wars. It rendered yeoman service in the capital and helped reinstate confidence in the general public in the aftermath of the Partition of India.\nAfter independence, Humber and Daimler armoured cars formed the mounts of the regiment and were deployed in the defense of Chushul at heights above 14,000&nbsp;ft during the 1962 Sino-Indian War.\nThe regiment participated in Operation Ablaze in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. The regiment served in Siachen glacier, where it has been serving till date with a section (6-20 troops) led by a JCO. A detachment of the regiment was a part of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka during 1988–89, and Indian contingents to the UN Peace Keeping Forces in Somalia, Angola and Sierra Leone.\nStandards, guidons & banners\nEach successive viceroy presented a banner to the Bodyguard upon assuming office; the banners of previous viceroys being kept in the custody of the regiment. The practice continues in effect until the present day with each President of India presenting a silver trumpet to the regiment - although the coat-of-arms of the Viceroy is replaced by the monogram of the President.\nThe first trumpet with banner of the President was presented by Rajendra Prasad on 14 May 1957. It had a maroon background with the emblem and crest in gold thread. The design incorporated the initials of Rajendra Prasad in Devanagri script in the centre and four emblems in gold in all four corners of the banner, from the Presidential Standard of India. Prasad's personal standard was presented to the regiment on 18 January 1958 by the President himself. In November 1958, President Prasad presented a new Regimental Standard to the regiment, the previous Regimental Standard having been laid up after India became a republic. The old regimental standard rests in the Regiment Officer's mess.\nThe second president of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan presented his banner to the regiment on 21 October 1962. His banner, with a grey background with emblem and crest in gold thread, incorporated his initials in Devanagari script in the center and four emblems in gold in the four corners, from the presidential standard. The new President's Standard of the Body Guard and the Regimental Standard were awarded by President Radhakrishnan on 11 November 1963. The Regimental Standard is dark blue in colour with the regimental crest in the centre surrounded by lotus flowers and Ashoka leaves. Five scrolls on either side of the crest record the regiment's Battle Honours and the standard bears the motto \"Bharat Mata ki Jai\".\nPresent status\nvisiting Parliament House]]\nIn 2003, the President's Bodyguard had an establishment of 7 officers, 15 JCOs, and 140 enlisted men, for a total strength of 180. Throughout its history, the Bodyguard has varied in size from 50 men, when first raised, to 1929 men in 1845. However, it was usually around squadron size, or about 130 men.\nBy tradition, the commanding officer has always been a brigadier or colonel. Recruitment to the regiment in India is now 1/3 each from Sikh Jats, Hindu Jats, and Rajputs, with officers and administrative staff from all over India. Its current commanding officer is Colonel Anoop Tiwari and the second-in-command is Lieutenant Colonel Ramakant Yadav.\nGallery\nFile:Indian President`s Bodyguard at Rashtrapati Bhavan.jpg|Guard-changing ceremony outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's House)\nFile:Presidents' Body Guard.jpg|President's Bodyguard in summer ceremonial uniforms during changing of the guard\nFile:PBG (my own photo).JPG|President's Bodyguard coming out of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in their winter ceremonial dress\nFile:Col T S Mundi.jpg|Colonel T.
