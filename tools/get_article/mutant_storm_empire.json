The game also features online multiplayer through Xbox Live.\nGameplay\nThe game features 4 worlds, each divided into 4 levels playable on 5 difficulty levels or \"belts\" that the player can play through more or less seamlessly. There are no bombs, lives as such, if the player loses a life, one of 6 granted per world, it immediately is lost without losing energy giving a temporary repulsion to the enemies. Higher points can be reached by playing on more difficult settings and attaining combo bonuses by stringing together kills of the same enemy colour, which is made difficult as one needs to allow other enemy types to populate the screen to achieve this.\nMultiplayer\nThe game features a two-player cooperative mode that is playable locally and on Xbox Live.\nReception\n| EuroG = 7/10\n| GSpot = 7/10\n| IGN = 7.7/10\n| TX = 8.8/10\n}}\nMutant Storm Empire received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release. On Metacritic, the game holds a score of 77/100 based on 20 reviews.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120106201603/http://pompomgames.com/mutantstormempire.htm Mutant Storm Empire on PomPom Games' official website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAU-7NODelU YouTube video of Mutant Storm Empire]\n*"
