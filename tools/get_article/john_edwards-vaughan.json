John Edwards senior died in 1818, and his son inherited his estate, and took the additional name of Vaughan in 1829 as a beneficiary of the will of William Vaughan of Glanelai, Glamorgan.\nEdwards-Vaughan was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glamorganshire at the general election in 1818, but when he stood as a Whig at the 1820 general election, he was defeated by the Tory candidate.\nHe was appointed High Sheriff of Glamorgan for 1823–24 and was elected to the House of Commons as a Tory at the 1830 general election, when he was elected as the MP for Wells, having stood unsuccessfully in 1826. He was re-elected unopposed in 1831, but was defeated at the 1832 general election.\nEdwards-Vaughan married twice: firstly Ann, the daughter and heiress of Thomas Williams of Court Herbert, Glamorgan and secondly Sarah, the daughter and heiress of Daniel Parkin and his wife Sarah Barwis of London, and widow of James Dalton of Russell Square, Middlesex, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Their daughter Jessie married his fellow MP at Wells, John Lee Lee and their son Vaughan Hanning Vaughan-Lee sat as an MP after serving in the Crimean War.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
