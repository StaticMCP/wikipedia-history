The Franks' victory resulted in their conquest of Gallia Aquitania and the death of Alaric II.\n.]]\nBackground\nAfter Clovis's victories over the Alemanni east of the Rhine and over the Burgundians in the Rhone Valley, the Franks' growing power posed a threat to Alaric II's territory in Aquitaine and Hispania. Despite Theodoric the Great's attempts to broker a peace between the factions, Clovis began a campaign to seize Aquitaine and Alaric's center of power in Toulouse. Alaric, his army, and a force of Auvergnants militia commanded by Apollinaris of Clermont marched north and met the Frankish army in Gaul.\nBattle\nClovis's army was slowed by a rain-swollen Vienne River, yet his forces were able to engage the Visigoths south of Vouillé. With his missile troops stationed at the rear of his army, Clovis sent the rest of the army forward to fight hand-to-hand with the Visigoths. Despite being in a superior army in size and equipment, Alaric's soldiers wavered as all of the Auvergnat commanders except Apollinaris were killed. During the melée Clovis allegedly killed the Visigothic king Alaric, whereupon the Visigothic army broke and fled. Clovis's army proceeded south and plundered Alaric's treasure at Toulouse.\nAftermath\nAfter Clovis's success in this battle, Byzantine Emperor Anastasius made him an honorary consul and patrician. The battle forced the Visigoths to retreat to Septimania, which they continued to hold, and the Franks' success at Vouillé allowed them to control the southwestern part of France and to capture Toulouse. Alaric's illegitimate son Gesalec tried to organise a counterstrike at Narbonne, but he was deposed and ultimately killed when Narbonne was taken by Burgundian allies of the Franks. Clovis eventually drove the Goths out of Angoulême and his son, Theuderic I, defeated the Goths in Hispania.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Bernard S.
