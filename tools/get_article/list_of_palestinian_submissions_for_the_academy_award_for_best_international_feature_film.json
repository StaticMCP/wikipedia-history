The Palestinians had also attempted to submit a film in 2002.\nThe Foreign Language Film award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The award was created for the 1956 Academy Awards, succeeding the non-competitive Honorary Academy Awards which were presented between 1947 and 1955 to the best foreign language films released in the United States.\nAs of 2025, Palestine has submitted eighteen films and received two nominations. The first for Paradise Now, and the last for Omar, both films were directed by Hany Abu-Assad.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Palestine for review by the academy for the award by year. All films were primarily spoken in Arabic.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n! Year(Ceremony) !! English title !! Arabic title !! Director !!

The decision to bar the country on the basis of nationality proved controversial, especially since other entities without international recognition, including Hong Kong, Puerto Rico and Taiwan had long participated in the competition, receiving several Oscar nominations. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences relented a year later, and allowed the film to compete.\nName of the country\nWhen AMPAS announces their \"longlist\" of eligible foreign films each year, the Palestinian submission is designated as the representative of \"Palestine\". However, when Paradise Now succeeding in getting an Oscar nomination under this moniker, pro-Israeli groups in the United States objected to the name. After intense lobbying from Jewish groups, the academy decided to designate Paradise Now as a submission from the Palestinian Authority, a move that was decried by the film's director Hany Abu-Assad. As a compromise, the film was eventually announced as a submission from the Palestinian Territories. Subsequent to this, Salt of this Sea was once again recognized on AMPAS' official website as the representative of Palestine.\nIn 2014, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences named Palestine as the place of origin for Hany Abu-Assad's Omar, rather than the Palestinian territories, the designation used for Hany Abu-Assad's earlier work Paradise Now.\nSee also\n*List of Academy Award winners and nominees for Best International Feature Film\n*List of Academy Award-winning foreign language films\n*List of Israeli submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080707023727/http://www.oscars.org/awardsdatabase/ The Official Academy Awards Database]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080622050250/http://www.oscars.org/impc_site2/index.html The Motion Picture Credits Database]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/ IMDb Academy Awards Page]"
