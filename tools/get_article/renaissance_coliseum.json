Adjacent to the arena is the men's basketball practice facility. In addition to hosting Bradley Athletics events, the facility hosts concerts, speakers, commencement, IHSA competitions, and other events local to Central Illinois.\nHistory\nRenaissance Coliseum was originally intended to be completed in 2009, but construction delays pushed back the opening to the 2010–11 academic year.\nAfter the demolition of Robertson Memorial Field House, the 4,200-seat arena was needed to host sports that don't require the larger Carver Arena. Because of the delays, the Bradley teams moved to Lorene Ramsey Gymnasium at nearby Illinois Central College for the 2009–2010 season.\nTwo cul de sacs (Haussler Lane and Robertson Court) flank each side of Renaissance Coliseum, paying tribute to two prominent campus names. A.J. Robertson was athletics director at Bradley from 1920 to 1948.\nThe Coliseum opened on August 27, 2010. The official dedication took place on October 15, 2010.\nEvents\nConcerts\nConcerts the arena has hosted over the years include:  Weezer, Jason Derulo, Mike Posner, Taking Back Sunday, Girl Talk, The Band Perry, Plain White T's, The Fray, and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.\nSports\nIn 2012, the Bradley University Men's Basketball team played its first regular season home game on campus since 1982. The team has continued to schedule at least one regular season home game at the arena since then. Bradley played two home games of the CIT postseason tournament at the Coliseum, defeating both the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and Tulane.\nSee also\n* List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080915185201/http://www.bubraves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3400&ATCLID=1414611&KEY=&DB_OEM_ID=3400&DB_LANG=&IN_SUBSCRIBER_CONTENT= Stadium information]\n*[http://www.bradleybraves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3400&KEY=&ATCLID=204974281&SPID=1510&SPSID=19449 Bradley University Arena]"
