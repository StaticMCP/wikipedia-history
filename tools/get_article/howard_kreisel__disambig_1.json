He received his B.A. (summa cum laude with honors in philosophy) at Brandeis University in 1972 and went on to complete his M.A. (1976) and Ph.D. (1981) at Brandeis in the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies. His doctoral dissertation, Theories of Prophecy in Medieval Jewish Philosophy was written under the supervision of Alfred Ivry. He taught medieval Jewish studies for three years at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (Wyncote, Pennsylvania) before moving to Israel in 1983. He has taught at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev from 1983 till 2019 and held the Miriam Martha Hubert Chair in Jewish Thought. In 1995-1996 he served as a visiting professor at the University of Calgary in the departments of religion and philosophy. Among his administrative positions he served as the first chair of the newly formed Goldstein-Goren department of Jewish thought at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (1998–2002) before assuming the position of directing the Goldstein-Goren International Center for Jewish Thought (2003–2022) and editor of the series he founded, Goldstein-Goren Library of Jewish Thought (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev Press). He is also the founder and editor-in-chief of the new annual journal sponsored by the center, Jewish Thought (the first volume appeared in 2019). To date, 5 volumes have appeared.\nScholarship\nKreisel’s research covers the gamut of medieval Jewish philosophy. His particular interests lie in the areas of prophecy, medieval Jewish ethical and political philosophy as well as philosophical exegesis of the Bible. Over the past decade he has devoted most of his scholarly activity to producing critical annotated editions of important Jewish medieval treatises that have survived only in manuscript form, most notably works by Nissim of Marseilles, Moses Ibn Tibbon and Levi ben Avraham. All four volumes have appeared of the latter’s monumental encyclopedia, Livyat Hen. Together with a theme of researchers, all former students of his, Kreisel subsequently completed a project to publish the five earliest supercommentaries on Abraham Ibn Ezra’s commentary on the Torah. More recently he published Judah Moskoni's lengthy supercommentary. He is the author of 11 books and over 50 scholarly articles. He has also edited or co-edited 7 books.Eight students completed their Ph.D. dissertations under his supervision, and three of the dissertations were subsequently published.\nBooks\nDissertation\n#\nAuthored books\n#Maimonides’ Political Thought: Studies in Ethics, Law and the Human Ideal (New York: SUNY Press, 1999) 360 pages.\n#Ma`aseh Nissim by R.
