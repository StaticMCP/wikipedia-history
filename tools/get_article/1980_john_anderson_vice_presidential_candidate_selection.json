Anderson chose former Wisconsin Governor [[Patrick Lucey as his running mate in 1980.]]\nThis article lists running mates considered by John B. Anderson during his 1980 independent candidacy for President of the United States. Anderson, a Republican representative from Illinois, launched an independent candidacy after dropping out of the Republican primaries. On August 26, 1980, Anderson announced his selection of former Democratic Governor Patrick Lucey of Wisconsin as his running mate. Anderson had previously stated that he wanted to choose a liberal Democrat such as Arizona Representative Mo Udall as his running mate. Anderson also seriously considered naming a black or female candidate, but ultimately went with the safer choice of Lucey. The Anderson–Lucey ticket took 6.6% of the popular vote in the 1980 presidential election.\nOther potential candidates\nFile:Hugh Carey LOC (cropped).jpg|alt=|}}\nFile:Boston Mayor Kevin H White (1).jpg|alt=|\nFile:Barbara Jordan, Congresswoman, 1972-78 (cropped).tif|alt=|\nFile:Shirley Chisholm (3).jpg|alt=|\nFile:Edward brooke senator (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nSee also\n*1980 United States presidential election\n*John Anderson presidential campaign, 1980\nReferences"
