He was educated at the King's School, Canterbury until the war saw him evacuated to St Austell in Cornwall. He performed National Service with the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry. Afterwards he studied at the Royal College of Music with Patrick Hadley and later Herbert Howells. While there he won the Lionel Tertis prize for his folk-song influenced Suite for viola and piano (1952). It was later broadcast on BBC Radio by Watson Forbes.\nHarris was married in 1956 and the couple had two sons and a daughter. But the marriage ended in divorce and Harris became a single parent of three children, working as a music and piano teacher in various London and Kent schools. He maintained his Cornish roots from his mother's side of the family, frequently returning to Cornwall and becoming friendly with another Cornish composer of operas, Inglis Gundry. He was made a Cornish bard in 2002 in recognition of his support for Cornish music.\nHe died in a London nursing home on 17 August 2013, aged 84. His memoirs, Knocking on a Bolted Door, were edited by his son Steven and published in 2014. Steven Harris has also written a memoir about his time working as a piano tuner at the Harrods department store in the late 1970s.\nSelected works\nHarris composed operas, song cycles and orchestral music as well as chamber music. His operas include: The Woman on the Hill (1980), based on a short story by Eleanor Inglefield (a relative of Delius); The Sunken City (1992), his largest opera, telling the story of the mythical submerged city of Ker-ys off the Breton coast; The Shining Ones (2000), set in London's East End of the 1930s; and Rescorla Variations (2001, premiered in 2006 by the Cornwall Chamber Orchestra), about the Cornish national hero Rick Rescorla, who died saving lives at the Twin Towers on 9/11.\nThe seven song A Cycle of Love and Death, setting Ezra Pound, was composed in 1967 and premiered in 1973 at a Wigmore Hall recital featuring the composer as pianist. The same recital included Stanzas for a Drowned City and the piano duo Sonatina patetico. The orchestral works include three substantial pieces: Dance of Life (1982), Celtic Triptych (1983, for chamber orchestra) and the 20 minute symphonic suite My Country (1987) also arranged for two pianos.\nThe Camerata Ensemble has recorded the Quintet for recorder and string quartet, which was dedicated to recorder soloist John Turner.
