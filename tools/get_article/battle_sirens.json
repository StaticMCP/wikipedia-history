The devastating grooves, monster drops and insane tension that are a hallmark of both Knife Party and Rage Against the Machine are elevated to a crazy level with this jam.\"  The single is featured as the opening track on Morello's solo album The Atlas Underground.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016-2017)\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=row|US Billboard Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales\n|43\n|-\n|}\nBattle Sirens EP\n#\"Battle Sirens\"  – 4:05\n#\"Battle Sirens\" (Ephwurd Remix) – 3:56\n#\"Battle Sirens\" (Brillz remix) – 3:57\n#\"Battle Sirens\" (Live Version) – 4:05\nRemixes\nApart from the remixes included in the EP, American duo RIOT made a remix of the track.
