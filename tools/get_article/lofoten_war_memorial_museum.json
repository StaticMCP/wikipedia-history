Many of these artifacts are linked to well-known figures and events during the war, such as a peaked cap belonging to Siegfried Wolfgang Fehmer and a jacket belonging to Ernst Weiner, both of whom worked for the Gestapo in Oslo. In addition, the museum showcases peaked caps belonging to General Carl Gustav Fleischer and Birger Eriksen, Reichkommissar Josef Terboven's letter file, lanterns and a compass from Leif Larsen's boats, a lamp from the German battleship Tirpitz, and a case believed to have belonged to Eva Braun.\nFurthermore, the museum exhibits curiosities and rare items from everyday life during the war, including cigarette packages and condoms, and even Christmas decorations adorned with Nazi swastikas.\nIn 2008, Hakvaag acquired a painting that may have been created by Adolf Hitler, with the frame concealing four sketches of Disney cartoon characters signed \"A. H.\"\nThe museum also has a library of books, printed materials, and photographs from the war.\nFile:German, Norwegian, British WW2 uniforms-weapons-equipment, NSU SS bike, Gestapo, Polarfront 1940-45, civil, mil. items, rare objects, etc. Lofoten Krigminnemuseum, Norway (War Memorial Museum) Distorted panorama 2019-05-08 IMG 8486.jpg|The Lofoten War Memorial Museum exhibits militaria and civilian artifacts related to German-occupied Norway 1940–1945.
