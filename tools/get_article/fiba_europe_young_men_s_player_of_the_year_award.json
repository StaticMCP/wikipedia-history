The inaugural award was given out in the year 2005 to Nikos Zisis of Greece. The vote was decided upon by a panel of basketball experts and also by fan voting.\nThe candidates included all European basketball players aged 22 and under in the world, regardless of whether they played in Europe, or anywhere else in the world. Also, the candidates included all players, from both professional sports leagues such as the NBA or the EuroLeague, etc. (including from both senior and junior level sports clubs) and amateur status, such as the NCAA's college basketball competitions, etc. The FIBA Europe Young Men's Player of the Year Award was the junior European Player of the Year award (only for players aged 22 and under) that was given by FIBA, and is not to be confused with the senior men's award, which was the FIBA Europe Men's Player of the Year Award.\nThe award was a calendar year by calendar year award, and was not a season by season award.\nAward winners\nNikos Zisis\n| mostwins      =  Ricky Rubio (3)\n| mostrecent    =  Dario Šarić (2014)\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
