In later life he converted to Protestantism.\nOn the death of his father he became possessed of the estate of Brent Hall, but being a man of a very liberal disposition he contrived \"to squander it mostly away on poets, flatterers (which he loved), in buying of curiosities (which some called baubles), on musicians, buffoons, &c.\" (Wood).\nHe often gave his bond for the payment of debts contracted by his friends, and on one occasion, being unable to meet the obligation he had incurred, was committed to prison at Oxford.\nTo his niece at her marriage, he granted a handsome portion, and many poor scholars experienced his bounty.\nWhen he left Cambridge he made a valuable donation of books to St. John's College.\nAmong his friends, he numbered many distinguished men.\nIn 1638, Phineas Fletcher dedicated to him The Purple Island.\nSir William Davenant, Francis Quarles, Payne Fisher, and others, dedicated works to him or complimented him in epigrams.\nBenlowes spent the last eight years of his life at Oxford, studying much in the Bodleian Library, and enjoying \"conversation with ingenious.\"\nHe died, in great poverty, after he marched off in a cold season, on 18 December 1676, at eight o'clock at night.\nWorks\nBenlowes' chief work is entitled ''Theophila, or Love's Sacrifice, a divine poem. Written by E. B. Esq. Several parts thereof set to fit aires, by Mr. J. Jenkins, 1652, fol. It deals with mystical religion, telling how the soul, represented by Theophila, ascends by humility, zeal and contemplation, and triumphs over the sins of the senses.\nThe poem is divided into thirteen cantos, most of which are preceded by large plates of Hollar and others.\nPrefixed to the first canto, which is entitled the Prelibation to the Sacrifice,'' is an engraving of a full-length figure (presumably the author) seated at a writing-table.\nThe volume is greatly valued for the engravings.\nLater writers, including Samuel Butler, Alexander Pope and William Warburton, were exceedingly severe on Benlowes's poetry.\nReferences\nAttribution:\n*\n*\n*"
