The United Nations has expressed concern about Iran's treatment of detained protesters and said that authorities were refusing to release some of the bodies of those killed.\nThe theft of bodies has occurred throughout the regime's history, but has been seen more often in the wake of protests.\nDescription\nThe practice is seen as a way of denying dignity and respect to the victims and their families, as well as a way of concealing crimes against humanity. The practice also violates international human rights law and Islamic law, both of which require proper burial and respect for the dead. The practice also deprives the families of their right to truth, justice and reparation for their losses.\nBy taking away the bodies of the slain protesters, the authorities are trying to prevent their families from holding funerals and mourning ceremonies, which could fuel more protests and public outrage. They are also trying to conceal the evidence of their crackdown and the true number of casualties.\nHistory\nThe practice of stealing bodies is not new in Iran, as it has been used by the authorities in various protests or conflicts, such as the 2019 Bloody November protests or the 1988 mass executions of political prisoners.\nThe Bloody November protests in 2019 in Iran were a series of nationwide demonstrations that erupted after the government announced a sudden increase in fuel prices, which caused hundreds of casualties due to hard crackdowns, the authorities have interacted with the families of the victims in various ways, such as withholding their bodies or directing them to bury them in unmarked graves. Human Rights Watch has reported several cases of families who signed statements that they would not communicate with the media or hold public funerals for their loved ones in exchange for the bodies.\nDuring the 2021 protests, Iranian authorities were accused of stealing the bodies of protesters who were killed by security forces during the demonstrations. The protests erupted over various issues such as water shortages, power cuts, economic hardship and political repression. The authorities have also harassed and intimidated the families of the victims, and in some cases, refused to hand over their bodies or forced them to bury them in unmarked graves. The families have been denied the opportunity to say goodbye to their loved ones and to hold funerals and mourning ceremonies, which could fuel more protests and public outrage. Human rights groups and activists have called for justice and accountability for the victims of the repression.\nThe authorities have also been accused of hiding or manipulating the death certificates of the Mahsa Amini protestors, making it difficult for their families to obtain them or to verify the cause of death. According to Iran Human Rights, a Norway-based NGO, some families have been asked to pay large sums of money to receive the bodies or the death certificates of their loved ones. Some families have also been told that their relatives died of natural causes or accidents, rather than gunshot wounds or torture. Some families have not been able to find their relatives' bodies at all, despite searching in various hospitals and morgues.\nAftermath\nAn independent inquiry, called the Iran Atrocities Tribunal, opened in London in November 2021 to investigate allegations of mass killings of protesters by the Iranian government in November 2019. The tribunal will hear evidence from witnesses, experts and victims’ families, who claim that the Iranian authorities used excessive force to suppress the protests, which erupted over a fuel price hike and turned into a broader expression of dissent. The tribunal will also examine allegations that the Iranian authorities stole the bodies of some of the protesters who were killed, in order to conceal the extent of the violence and prevent their families from holding funerals and mourning ceremonies.\nSee also\n* Killing of Kian Pirfalak\n* Mahshahr massacre\n* Political repression in the Islamic Republic of Iran\nReferences"
