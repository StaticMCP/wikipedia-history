Architecture up to 1914 is commonly included in this style.\nIt can also be used to mean various styles in middle-class housing, including relaxed versions of Arts and Crafts architecture.\nDescription\nEdwardian architecture is generally less ornate than high or late Victorian architecture, apart from a subset – used for major buildings – known as Edwardian Baroque architecture.\n, Scotland built in 1910.]]\nThe Victorian Society campaigns to preserve architecture built between 1837 and 1914, and so includes Edwardian as well as Victorian architecture within its remit.\nCharacteristics\nThe characteristic features of the Edwardian Baroque style were drawn from two main sources: the architecture of France during the 18th century and that of Sir Christopher Wren in England during the 17th—part of the English Baroque (for this reason Edwardian Baroque is sometimes referred to as \"Wrenaissance\"). Sir Edwin Lutyens was a major exponent, designing many commercial buildings in what he termed 'the Grand Style' during the later 1910s and 1920s. This period of British architectural history is considered a particularly retrospective one, since it is contemporary with Art Nouveau.\nTypical details of Edwardian Baroque architecture include extensive rustication, usually more extreme at ground level, often running into and exaggerating the voussoirs of arched openings (derived from French models); domed corner rooftop pavilions and a central taller tower-like element creating a lively rooftop silhouette; revived Italian Baroque elements such as exaggerated keystones, segmental arched pediments, columns with engaged blocks, attached block-like rustication to window surrounds; colonnades of (sometimes paired) columns in the Ionic order and domed towers modelled closely on Wren's for the Royal Naval College in Greenwich. Some Edwardian Baroque buildings include details from other sources, such as the Dutch gables of Norman Shaw's Piccadilly Hotel in London.\n, Greater London, England]]\n, Newbury, design by H. Launcelot Fedden (1869&ndash;1910), as seen in The Building News, July 31, 1908.]]\nOther characteristics include:\n* Colour: lighter colours were used; the use of gas and later electric lights caused designers to be less concerned about the need to disguise soot buildup on walls compared to Victorian era architecture.\n* Patterns: \"Decorative patterns were less complex; both wallpaper and curtain designs were more plain.\"\n* Clutter: \"There was less clutter than in the Victorian era. Ornaments were perhaps grouped rather than everywhere.\"\nArchitectural influences\n* Victorian\n* Art Nouveau\n* Georgian\n* Arts and Crafts\n* Federation\nNotable examples\n, built for Lloyds Bank during 1915.]]\n, built during 1910.]]\nUnited Kingdom\n* Admiralty Arch, London (1912)\n* Albert Hall, Manchester (1910)\n* Albert Hall, Nottingham (1910)\n* Arding & Hobbs, London (1910)\n* Ashton Memorial, Lancaster, by John Belcher (1909)\n* Asia House, Manchester (1909)\n* Australia House, London (1918)\n* Belfast City Hall, Belfast, by Brumwell Thomas (1906)\n* Blythe House, London, by Henry Tanner (1903)\n* Bridgewater House, Manchester (1912)\n* Cardiff City Hall, Cardiff, by Henry Vaughan Lanchester, Edwin Alfred Rickards & James A.
