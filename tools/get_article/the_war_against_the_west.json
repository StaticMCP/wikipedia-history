It describes German National Socialism as diametrically opposed to the [classical] liberal, democratic, Constitutional, and free-enterprise \"Western\" tendencies found mainly within Britain and the United States.\nOverview\nDuring the twenties and thirties, Kolnai, who converted to Catholicism under the influence of G.K. Chesterton, read extensively in the German language fascist and national socialist literature.  The book compiles and critiques the anti-Enlightenment works of national socialist writers themselves. Kolnai's study was the first comprehensive survey in English of German national socialist ideology as a counter-revolution against what German thinkers saw as the materialistic, rootless civilizations dominated by comfort-addicted, money-and-security-centered, liberal bourgeois and rootless cosmopolitan Jews; the antithesis of the heroic model of more vital civilizations, prepared to risk their lives, to die for ostensibly \"higher\" ideals. Kolnai argues that national socialist ideology is not only alien to the West, but profoundly disturbing and dangerous.\nKolnai described the German national socialists' war against the West as, in essence, a war of paganism against Christian civilization. In citations from Hitler, Goebbels, and others, Kolnai sought to expose what he saw as \"the obsessive German national socialist effort to replace Christianity with a crude and barbaric form of pagan religion, to twist the cross of Christ into a swastika.\"\nContents\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background: #dcdcdc;\" align=\"left\"\n!Chapter\n!Section\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n| Preface\n|Define's German national socialist totalitarianism as a conscious, deliberate revolt of \"Germanism\" against the freedom of the human personality alike in its religious, social, and political forms. It [German national socialism] is the onslaught of a reborn pagan barbarism upon the spirit and ethics of [classical] liberal Christendom.\n|-\n|\n| Author's Foreword\n| Identifies the two outstanding figures who have contributed to the rise of National Socialism as a creed, as Friedrich Nietzsche (\"perhaps the greatest Satanist of all times\") and Stefan George.\nNotes the similarities between German national socialism and Italian fascism as anti-democratic, hostile to Western Constitutionalism, paganistic, and totalitarian.\nNotes the inheritance of Central European Imperialism from the Middle Ages as a feature \"beyond even the ideological identity\" along with a correlation to \"degenerate\", (i.e. neo, non-classical) liberalism's cult of \"relativism\" and \"indifferentism\".\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | Chapter I.\nThe Central Meaning of the National Socialist Attitude\n| 1.

The Call for Mythology.\n| Alfred Rosenberg's calls for a \"future church\", a Volkskirche [People's Church] that is intended to be a \"nucleus\" protected by the National Socialist State; in due course the \"new church\" will drain away the influence of the \"Roman Haruspex\" as well as of the \"Old Testament Superintendents\" of the fossil called Protestantism.\n|-\n| rowspan=6 | Chapter VI.\nMorals, Law and Culture\n| 1.

The Socialist Phrase.\n| Among others, Sombart's \"essentially regulated planned economy\" as a definition for the German \"blood and soil\" socialism characterized by anti-capitalism and stark opposition to the classical liberalism of life, liberty, and property found primarily in Great Britain before WW II.\n|-\n|| 2. The Revival of Class-Rule.\n|\n|-\n|| 3. Inequalitarian Socialism.\n|What remains of socialism is an essentially vague ideology of \"planning\", discipline instead of liberty, dictatorial state interference instead of economic freedom, and a generous grant of \"honour\" to workers, or more especially to \"work\".\n|-\n|| 4. The Economics of State-Power.\n|It is a feature of Fascism that \"Capitalism\" no longer fends for itself on the open battlefield of economic argument, but takes a concealed stand behind the showy and new-fangled hierarchy of popular dictatorship, which is at one a hireling in its pay and its overlord taking toll from it.\n|-\n|| 5. The Servile Society.\n|The notion of a \"new ethic\" of commerce in which the business owner issues orders of work to his henchmen workers, while both operate together as one cell of an organic economy. The power of these cell is counterbalanced by public factors such as Labor Trustees and appointed (national) socialist party organizers.\n|-\n| rowspan=8 | Chapter VIII.\nNation and Race\n| 1.
