The organization marked the reunification of the Canadian section of the Fourth International and had a membership of several hundred people. The group published a monthly newspaper in English, Socialist Voice, as well as a French-language publication, La Lutte Ouvrière.\nThe RWL was heavily influenced by the Socialist Workers Party of the United States. When the SWP moved away from Trotskyism in the early 1980s, a faction fight broke out in the RWL between supporters of the SWP and supporters of a Trotskyist position over the issue of Leon Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution and the nature of the Cuban Revolution. While the Trotskyists argued that Cuba was a deformed workers' state, the supporters of the SWP argued that Cuban Revolution was a full workers' revolution and that the Cuban state was a genuine workers' state. The Trotskyists were expelled beginning in the early 1980s and formed what became Gauche Socialiste in Quebec and Socialist Challenge in English Canada. In 1990, the RWL left the Fourth International and changed its name to the Communist League.\nSee also\n* Revolutionary Workers League (in Manitoba)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.marxists.org/history/canada/socialisthistory/Docs/docs.htm#RWL Canada Socialist History Project documents on Revolutionary Workers League, 1977-1988]"
