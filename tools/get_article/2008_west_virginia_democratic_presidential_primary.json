It was open to Democrats and Independents. The primary determined 28 delegates to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, who were awarded on a proportional basis. West Virginia's Democratic delegation also included 11 unpledged \"superdelegates\".  The primary came late in the nomination race. Hillary Clinton won by a very wide margin, but her opponent Barack Obama maintained a substantial lead in the overall number of pledged delegate votes. Despite Clinton's landslide win in this primary she would receive more votes in this primary than in the 2016 United States presidential election in West Virginia as the Democratic nominee.\nPolls\nAs of May 4, 2008, opinion polling showed Sen. Hillary Clinton holding a 56% to 27% lead over Sen. Barack Obama, with 17% undecided.\nSome of West Virginia's superdelegates also endorsed a candidate prior to the primary.  By February 20, more than a month before the election, three superdelegates had announced support for Sen. Hillary Clinton (DNC Members Marie Prezioso, Pat Maroney, and Belinda Biafore), while three had endorsed Sen. Barack Obama (Rep. Nick Rahall, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, and Sen. Robert C. Byrd).\nResults\nPrimary date: May 13, 2008\nNational pledged delegates determined: 28\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|Key: || align=\"center\" bgcolor=#FFE8E8| Withdrewprior to contest\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:right;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | West Virginia Democratic presidential primary, 2008\n|-\n! style=\"width: 17em\"| Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\"| Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\"| Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\"| Delegates\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Hillary Clinton\n|240,890\n|66.93%\n|20\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| Barack Obama\n| 92,736\n| 25.77%\n| 8\n|-bgcolor=#FFE8E8\n| align=\"left\"| John Edwards\n| 26,284\n| 7.3%\n| 0\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| Total\n| 359,910\n| 100.00%\n| 28\n|}\nSee also\n* Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008\n* West Virginia Republican caucuses, 2008\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100306114153/http://www.sos.wv.gov/elections/historyresource/Pages/ElectionReturns.aspx WV Secretary of State - Election Returns]"
