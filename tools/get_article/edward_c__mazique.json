He graduated from Natchez College before leaving Mississippi to pursue an undergraduate degree and graduated from Morehouse College in Georgia, later serving on its board of trustees. He received a master's degree in education from Atlanta University, then was a teacher and administrator at the old State A&I College in Forsyth, Ga., before moving here. He received his medical degree from Howard University in 1941 and served an internship and a residency in internal medicine at the old Freedmen's Hospital.\nCareer\nMazique was president of the District Medico-Chirurgical Society, a Black medical organization, in 1952, when he became one of the first five Blacks admitted to the District Medical Society. In 1954, he was one of the first two Blacks chosen in more than 60 years to be accepted on the medical staff of Georgetown University Hospital. He also became an attending physician at Providence Hospital.  In 1956, he chaired a special committee of the Washington NAACP branch dealing with the desegregation of the District school system. He also had served as an officer of campaign committees for Del. Walter E. Fauntroy (D-D.C.).\nIn the early 1950s, Mazique served on the old D.C. Commissioners' Citizens Advisory Council. Over the years, he also chaired the interracial practices committee of the 12th Street Branch of the YMCA and, in the early 1950s, led the fight to integrate all area YMCA facilities.

Jeffrey was the first black child to attend kindergarten at the Sidwell Friends School in 1956.
