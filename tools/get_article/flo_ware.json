She pressed school officials in the Central Area schools to improve the academic programmes, and later became an organizer of the Central Area School Board. She called for quality care for aged people and led the Meals on Wheels program in the city. She also called for more employment support for the poor.\nWare was involved with the Foster Parent Association and raised 20 foster children in her home. From 1968 to 1979 she hosted a radio talk show on Seattle station KRAB. In 1968 she led a group of around 50 indigenous and black people in a convoy of buses to Washington, D.C., to voice grievances about their living conditions; the group became known as the Poor People's Campaign. In the 1970s she sat on the King County Equal Opportunity Board and was involved in the Model Cities Program.\nIn 1982, a Seattle park was named for her.
