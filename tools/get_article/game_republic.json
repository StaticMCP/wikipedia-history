The company, which employed just under 300 individuals before its closure, was founded on July 1, 2003 by Yoshiki Okamoto after his departure from Capcom. He began working at rival game developer and publisher Konami in the 1980s, and was responsible for such arcade games as Gyruss and Time Pilot. He then moved to Capcom, where he worked on many renowned video games; he worked on the Resident Evil series and helped produce Street Fighter II.\nWhile Game Republic was a completely independent developer able to produce titles for any publisher and/or platform they desire, during the company's early years it had enjoyed a close relationship with Sony Computer Entertainment, with many of their early titles funded by and produced in conjunction with the publisher. Later projects were mostly funded and published by Namco Bandai Games. In June 2011 reports surfaced of Game Republic shutting down its website and vacating its offices. Many of the former Game Republic developers have been hired by Tango Gameworks.\nGames\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Publisher\n!Platform(s)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2005\n|Shadow Hunters\n|Game Republic\n|Board game\n|-\n|Genji: Dawn of the Samurai\n|Sony Computer Entertainment\n|PlayStation 2\n|-\n|Every Party\n|Microsoft Game Studios\n|Xbox 360\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2006\n|Brave Story: New Traveler\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Sony Computer Entertainment\n|PlayStation Portable\n|-\n|Genji: Days of the Blade\n| rowspan=\"4\" |PlayStation 3\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2007\n|Folklore\n|-\n|Dark Mist\n|-\n|Toy Home\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2008\n|SBI Group Kanshuu: Hajime You!
