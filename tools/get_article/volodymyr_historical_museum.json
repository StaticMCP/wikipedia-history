The community of Volodymyr (formerly Volodymyr-Volynskyi) established the museum collection in order to preserve the history of the region and to promote scientific research. At the beginning of the 20th century, the museum collection included a diverse range of cultural items, including blackletter books, manuscripts (including a 16th century New Testament), icons, and coins. The museum was headed by the local nobleman and ethnographer enthusiast, O. Dvernytsky (1838–1906), the Head of the St. Volodymyr Fellowship.\nDuring World War I many items were moved to museums of Kharkiv. In the period between World War I and World War II the museum moved to the buildings of a Dominican monastery, an architectural monument active during the 15th-18th century period.\nCollection\nThe museum collection consists of more than 18,000 items, including archeological finds, numismatic and ethnographic items, objects of arts and crafts, icons, documents, blackletter books, and photographic materials.\nCurrent status\nMuseum researchers attend ethnographic conferences, archeological and ethnographic expeditions, investigate the history of Volhynian land and educate local students. The museum also exhibits the works of local artists.\nThe museum joined the international project \"Via Regia\". The museum cooperates with other museums in Volyn Oblast and Rivne Oblast, Stefanyk Library of Lviv, and the museum of Kozłówka Palace (Poland).\nAs of 2011, the Museum Director was Vladimir Stemkovsky\nReferences\nExternal links"
