And it is a small railway station on the Bina–Katni line.\nHistory of Ishurwara Railway Station\nThe Ishurwara Railway Station, officially named Kishanpura Railway Station, is a modest yet historically significant stop along the Bina–Katni railway line in Sagar district, Madhya Pradesh. The station lies approximately 3.5 kilometers from the village of Ishurwara (also known as Isarwara or Isurwara, Village ID 460845).\nWhile the name might suggest direct proximity, the station was strategically located in Kishanpura to serve not only Ishurwara but also several surrounding villages. In the mid early of 19th century, railways were rapidly expanding across Central India under the Great Indian Peninsula Railway network, but remote areas like Ishurwara still lacked direct access to rail transport.\nThe Role of the Khemariya Family\nA turning point came in 1902, when Ishurwarchand Khemariya, a respected member of the Khemariya Brahmin family of Ishurwara, recognized the immense benefits a railway link could bring to the agrarian economy and mobility of the region. Understanding that the British Indian Railway authorities were more likely to approve stations if land was made available at minimal or no cost, Ishurwarchand Khemariya personally approached the then Railway Minister (under the British colonial administration) with a formal proposal.\nTo demonstrate the seriousness of the village’s commitment, the Khemariya family donated approximately 6.8 acres of prime agricultural land to the Indian Railways. This land became the foundation for the station’s construction, sidings, and approach roads.\nEstablishment and Early Years\nConstruction of the railway siding and passenger platform began soon after the land transfer. By the mid-1900s, the station was operational, initially functioning as a halt station where trains stopped on request. The name “Kishanpura” was officially adopted due to its location, but the people of the region continued to refer to it informally as Ishurwara Railway Station, in honor of the donors and the nearby village that championed its creation.\nThe first trains served primarily for freight—transporting grain, oilseeds, and pulses from local farmers to larger markets in Bina, Sagar, and Katni. Passenger services soon followed, allowing residents better access to employment, education, and trade in nearby towns and cities.\nGrowth and Regional Importance\nOver the decades, the station became a lifeline for surrounding villages including Kishanpura, Ishurwara, Khiriya, and Bhangarh. During the mid-20th century, it played an important role in moving essential supplies during times of drought and economic hardship.\nEven today, while it remains a small rural station with basic facilities, Kishanpura (Ishurwara) Railway Station stands as a symbol of community initiative and public spirit. The Khemariya family’s act of generosity more than a century ago continues to benefit thousands of villagers, connecting them to the rest of the state and country.\nReferences"
