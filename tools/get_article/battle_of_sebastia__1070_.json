Initially, Manuel achieved some success in Kayseri, but then the emperor, out of envy, ordered him to withdraw a large portion of his army against the city of Manbij. By then, Manuel learned of a group of Seljuks led by Arisiaghi, who was launching a raid into Byzantine territory.\nArisiaghi, called in Byzantine sources Chrysoskoulos, and Erbasagn in Turkish sources. Arisiaghi was the brother-in-law of the Seljuk Sultan, Alp Arslan and openly revolted against him. Alp Arslan defeated him, and Arisiaghi was forced to retreat with his men into Byzantine territory in Cappadocia. There, he encountered the Byzantine force led by Manuel near the vicinity of Sevastia (modern-day Sivas).\nManuel Komnenos rushed his small force to repel the Seljuk invaders. Following an initial battle close to Sevastia, the Turks staged their withdrawal and fled. After approaching the deserted enemy camp with ease and ignorance, the Byzantines were ambushed, and many of their troops were killed. The general himself, Manuel Komnenos, was captured.\nDuring his captivity, Manuel managed to convince Arisiaghi to join the Byzantines, which he did, as the Seljuk Sultan dispatched a force under Afshin, who was chasing him. Both of them set off for Constantinople, and the Seljuk defector was honored by the Byzantine emperor.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
