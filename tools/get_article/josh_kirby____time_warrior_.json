Time Warrior! is a direct-to-video film series in six installments which formed one story arc, with the first five films ending with a cliffhanger.\nThe series produced by Charles Band's Moonbeam Entertainment in association with The Kushner-Locke Company and released by Paramount between 1995 and 1996, featuring the fictional character Josh Kirby played by Corbin Allred. The series was described as in the \"tradition of Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and Captain Marvel\".\nPremise\nIn the 25th century, humans discover an alien device dubbed the \"Nullifier\". This device is said to be capable of controlling, or worse, destroying the universe. Irwin 1138 (Barrie Ingham), the second-greatest mind of his time splits the Nullifier into six pieces, which are subsequently dispersed through time. Dr. Zoetrope (Derek Webster), Irwin's rival and the greatest mind of his time, seeks to retrieve and reassemble the device with the help of his time traveling power armor, with Irwin following in his \"time pod\" to beat his rival to the pieces.\nThe chase leads them both to 1995, where they encounter 14-year-old Josh Kirby. After a brief conflict, Zoetrope flees into the time stream with a piece of the Nullifier that landed in Kirby's garden, and Irwin gives chase, only to bring Josh along for the ride by accident. Irwin explains the Nullifier is an indestructible weapon he scattered across time to prevent Zoetrope from using it to wipe out the universe. Unable to return to his home era, Josh accompanies Irwin, his alien companion Prism and later, half-human warrior Azabeth Siege (Jennifer Burns), in the race to collect the Nullifier pieces.\nChapters\nThe story unfolds over the course of six films:\n|ShortSummary=In the 25th century mankind has found a device capable of destroying the universe.
