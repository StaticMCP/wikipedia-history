The battle stopped an attempt by the Indonesian Navy to land 150 soldiers in Kaimana in Dutch New Guinea for sabotage and to incite the local population against the Dutch government. Commodore Yos Sudarso was in charge of the operation at sea, while Colonel Murshid commanded the infiltrators.\nBattle\nThree Indonesian torpedo boats left the Aru Islands in the middle of the night but were intercepted near the New Guinea coast by a Dutch Neptune reconnaissance plane, as the Dutch had anticipated the action for weeks. The torpedo boats responded to the flares sent off by the plane by shooting at it. The Dutch destroyer HNLMS Evertsen then joined the scene and sank RI Matjan Tutul, commanded by Sudarso. The other two ships, RI Matjan Kumbang and RI Harimau, fled, but one hit a reef, and the other was hit by gunfire and disabled. Evertsen was able to save most of the crew of Matjan Tutul, but at least three sailors died, among whom was Commodore Sudarso while the other two Indonesian vessels managed to escape unharmed.\nAftermath\n, Jakarta]]\nThe Indonesian action itself was an abject failure and General Nasution even refused to relay the bad news to President Sukarno, forcing Colonel Murshid to do this in person. However, the small battle was partially responsible for the subsequent involvement of the Soviet Union and United States in the Western New Guinea dispute, and it is honored in Indonesia by \"Oceanic Duty Day\" (Hari Dharma Samudera), an annual nationwide day of remembrance. Twelve years after his death, Yos Sudarso was officially added to the register of Indonesian heroes of the Revolution, while RI Harimau is now preserved at the Purna Bhakti Pertiwi Museum in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBxZk9mqQsQ/ The Dutch New Guinea Dispute—Operation Trikora 1961–1962]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtFO0n8pfCc/ The Dutch New Guinea Dispute 1949–1962]"
