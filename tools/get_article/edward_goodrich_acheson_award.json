      "text": "# Edward Goodrich Acheson Award\n\nThe Edward Goodrich Acheson Award was established by The Electrochemical Society (ECS) in 1928 to honor the memory of Edward Goodrich Acheson, a charter member of ECS. The award is presented every 2 years for \"conspicuous contribution to the advancement of the objectives, purposes, and activities of the society (ECS)\".\nRecipients of the award receive a gold medal, wall plaque, and cash prize, ECS Life membership, and a complimentary meeting registration.\nHistory\nThe Edward Goodrich Acheson Award is the first and most prestigious award of The Electrochemical Society. The award was established by a gift of $25,000 from past president (and namesake of the award) Edward Goodrich Acheson. Originally, recipients were presented with a prize of $1,000, a gold medal, and a bronze replica, with the intention that the gold medal would \"find its way to the safe deposit box,\" while the replica was reserved for \"everyday use\". The Acheson family later agreed to have the medal be electroplated gold in order to keep the award fund in balance. Thanks to continuous donations from the Acheson family between 1942 and 1991, the endowment fund has allowed the monetary prize to be increased 3 times since its establishment.\nRecipients of the award\nAs listed by ECS:\n* 2018 Tetsuya Osaka\n* 2016 Barry Miller\n* 2014 Ralph J.
