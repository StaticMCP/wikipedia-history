This award is available across several different program areas and can be earned more than once.\nHistory\nIn 1927 the Boy Scouts of America began to recognize Scoutmasters who completed specific training and performance goals over a five-year period of service with the Scoutmaster's Key. In 1932 the award was opened up to other Scouters with the Scouter's Training Award. The original award was a medal suspended from a green ribbon with the universal emblem superimposed over a \"V\", representing the five years of service requirement.\nIn 1948, the award was renamed Scouter's Award and the period of service was changed from five years to three years. The emblem was then changed from a \"V\" to the current design of an \"A\". The name reverted to Scouter's Training Award in 1954. A redesign of the ribbon in 1956 added a thin white stripe to the center of the ribbon, bringing the design of the award to the current appearance.\nPrior to 1988 the award could be earned by Cub Scouting leaders until the introduction of the Cub Scouting leader awards.  Those separate awards were discontinued in 2012 and the Scouter's Training Award for Cub Scouting was restored.\nIn 2013, requirements for a District Committee Scouter's Training Award was released.  By adding this award and revising the requirements for the District Committee Key, it brings these awards' requirements in line with the equivalent unit leader awards.\nAward\nThe medal consists of a pendant suspended from a green ribbon with a thin white vertical stripe. The pendant is the BSA universal emblem superimposed on an \"A\", all of a brass colored metal. The square knot insignia is an embroidered green square knot on a cloth khaki patch. Multiple awards are denoted by the wear of program devices, worn on the square knot award and the ribbon of the award medal.\nRequirements\nRequirements vary, depending on position, but all requirements basically amount to creation and/or maintenance of a quality Scouting program. The award may be earned as the Scouter's Training Award for Cub Scouts, Scouter's Training Award for Boy Scouts, Varsity Scout Leader Training Award, Venturing Leader Training Award, Sea Scout Leader Training Award or Roundtable Staff Training Award.\n'''Scouter's Training Award for Cub Scouts is for all Cub Scout leaders.
