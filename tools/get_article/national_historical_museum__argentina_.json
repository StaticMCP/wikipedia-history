The museum was initially located on government property located at 3951 Santa Fe Avenue (now occupied by the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden). It was relocated to its present location in the San Telmo ward after the land's purchase by the Municipality of Buenos Aires in 1897. The land later occupied by the Botanical Garden was thus transferred to the municipal government, and the museum to the national government.\nThe mansion was originally built for an English merchant, Daniel Mackinlay. In 1845, it was sold by his widow to the American businessman Charles Ridgley Horne in 1846, who enlarged the house and the gardens. Allied to the paramount Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Ridgley Horne was forced into exile after the strongman's 1852 overthrow, and the land was sold to José Gregorio Lezama. Following his 1894 death, his widow, Ángela Álzaga de Lezama sold the property to the city, which converted the mansion into the museum, and most of the surrounding land into Lezama Park.\nExhibits\nThe museum houses over 50,000 items. Portions of the collection were gathered from donations of relatives of important figures in the May Revolution and the wars of independence. Other objects were part of the collection of the Public Museum (Museo Público) created in 1822 by Bernardino Rivadavia.\nIts displays include regalia, belongings, furnishings and documents belonging to José de San Martín, María de los Remedios de Escalada, Manuel Belgrano, William Carr Beresford, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Bartolomé Mitre, Juan and Eva Perón, and other Argentine, as well as foreign, statesmen, lawmakers, and military figures who played key roles in the nation's history up to 1950.\nIts collection of history paintings includes works by Esteban Echeverría, Cándido López, and Prilidiano Pueyrredón, among others.\nGallery Building\nFile:Residencia de don Gregorio Lezama Actual sede del Museo Histórico.JPG|\nFile:Flickr_-_bastique_-_front_of_El_Museo_Historico_National.jpg|\nFile:Fachada_Museu_Histórico_Argentina.JPG|\nFile:MHN002.JPG|\nFile:MHN001.JPG|\nFile:MHN004.JPG|\nGallery Collection\nFile:San Martin related objects.JPG|\nFile:Uniforme de Uriburu.JPG|\nFile:Mariano_Moreno_related_objects.JPG|\nFile:Placa de la Primera Junta.JPG|\nFile:Partitura del Himno Nacional Argentino.JPG|\nFile:Flickr - bastique - Pistola a chispa.jpg|\nGallery of Paintings\nFile:Cabildoabierto-Subercaseaux-edit.jpg|\nFile:Cabildo abierto.jpg|\nFile:Himno Nacional Argentino.jpg|\nFile:José de San Martín (retrato, c.1828).jpg|\nFile:Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo.jpg|\nFile:Cornelio Saavedra - 1810.jpg|\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110307231711/http://www.mhnvirtual.cultura.gob.ar/mhn_360/ Virtual tour] (archived)\n* [https://turismo.buenosaires.gob.ar/es/otros-establecimientos/museo-hist%C3%B3rico-nacional Museum] at the GCBA"
