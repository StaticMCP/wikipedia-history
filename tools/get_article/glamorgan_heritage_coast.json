There is a Heritage Coast Centre located at Dunraven Park, Southerndown, at the western end of the coast, providing an information point and education centre.\nThe coast includes the Southerndown Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest at its heart, a  section from Ogmore-by-Sea, particularly interesting for its exposed Triassic alluvial fan deposits of carboniferous limestone. There is an Iron Age promontory fort (as well as a 19th-century lighthouse) at Nash Point and an ancient cairn or cromlech at Cwm Marcross.\nThe stretch of coast made the news in 2014 when coastal erosion left a towering stack of limestone \"about five times the height of a house\" separated from the main cliffs near Dunraven Bay.\nIn 2016 four large sculptures were to be created by artist Howard Bowcott, to be placed at strategic points along the coastline.\nSee also\n* Heritage coast\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/enjoying/visit_the_vale/llantwit_major_and_coast/heritage_coast.aspx Glamorgan Heritage Coast], Vale of Glamorgan Council"
