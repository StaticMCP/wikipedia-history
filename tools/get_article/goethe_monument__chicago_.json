It depicts a larger-than-life, neoclassically-styled hero in undress with a draped cape, peering far into the distance, with a bent leg perched on a rock and a hunting eagle perched on his knee.  The allegorical statue is not a portrait sculpture of the German philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but rather seeks to embody the \"spirit of Goethe\"; a low wall behind the statue shows a bas-relief of Goethe and a quote from his play Faust in German and English. The inscription on the statue reads: \"To / Goethe / The Master Mind of the / German People / The Germans of Chicago / 1913\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
