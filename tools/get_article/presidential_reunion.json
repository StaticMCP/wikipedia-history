The skit was released onto the Funny or Die website on March 3, 2010, and received negative reviews.\nPlot\nAs President Barack Obama prepares for bed he is too concerned about a problem with the banks and credit card companies in America. Michelle convinces him to retire for the evening, but as soon as he does, former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush enter the room. Clinton and Bush come to offer Obama advice as to how to handle the situation, reminiscing on their past duties. George H. W. Bush then exits the bathroom and offers his advice to the Obamas: to forget about approval rates. Jimmy Carter then enters the room (with a toolbox and begins fixing a random object on the wall) and is ridiculed by the other former presidents. Carter tells Obama to establish a consumer finance agency, stating people are becoming frustrated with being conned by banks and credit card companies. Ronald Reagan then appears before the group, surprising Carter (since Reagan is dead).\nReagan tells Obama to grow some balls in order to take on the banks and credit companies. Gerald Ford too enters the room (tripping over a table, spoofing himself slipping on a set of stairs exiting Air Force One) and Chase breaking character, assuming it is another episode of SNL, only to be informed he's on Funny or Die. Ford suggests the only way to stop the banks is to pardon Richard Nixon (which he did). Carter interprets what Ford really means, but Ford is shocked to see Carter, thinking he was dead, only to be informed he was dead. The group ask Obama if their suggestions helped, but Obama dismisses them, saying they were the reason the mess was created. Reagan then quotes a false George Washington statement, saying Obama's it and the group begins taunting Obama until he wakes up and realizes that he does need to be the one to establish a CFA, rushing off to gather his cabinet.\nCast\n* Fred Armisen as Barack Obama\n* Darrell Hammond as Bill Clinton\n* Will Ferrell as George W.
