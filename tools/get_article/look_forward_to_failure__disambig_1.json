This was the first album released to feature fan favorite \"San Dimas High School Football Rules\", a song that would later appear on Blue Skies, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits.  The band also intended on putting the song \"That Special Girl\" on Blue Skies, Broken Hearts as well but it didn't make the cut. The song features Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 on backing vocals. The version of \"My Hotel Year\" that appears on this EP is the electric version and contains an extra verse at the end. The version that ended up on Blue Skies was acoustic and shortened.\n}}\nTrack listing\nBand members\n* Kris Roe – vocals, guitar\n* Patrick Riley – guitar\n* Michael Davenport – bass\n* Chris Knapp – drums\nAdditional personnel\n* Backup vocals were provided by Mark Hoppus and Chad Price.\n* Tracks 2, 3, 4, and 6 were recorded and mixed at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, CO on September 14–18, 1998.
