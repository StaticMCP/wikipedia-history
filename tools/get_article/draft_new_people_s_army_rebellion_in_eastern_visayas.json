Due to hardship for peasants and chaos in the country, citizens formed the group Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon (), shortened as Hukbalahap, in a small barrio in Pampanga. The group attempted to resist the Japanese occupation through warfare, to protect the citizens from soldiers, and to control a portion of the Philippines. The group started a rebellion after World War II ended, causing President Ramon Magsaysay to create the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP); the group eventually surrendered in 1954. After the formation of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) on December 26, 1968, a military wing was formed from the party; the New People's Army (NPA). The group was made on March 29, 1969. The same year of the formation, the army started another rebellion. In the 1970s, the army eventually affected Eastern Visayas.\nEarly insurgence\nThe first CPP interaction in Eastern Visayas was in 1970 when a movement for a CPP organization was formed at a university in Catarman, Northern Samar. Jose Maria Sison, the leader of the CPP, dispatched one of his officials into Eastern Visayas to form a guerilla front; they found the thick jungle terrain of Samar ideal for guerilla warfare. In 1971, small groups of three to seven people started organizing a network of mass supporters for communism. When Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, communists from Samar regrouped in Catubig. Supporters from Eastern Samar crossed the mountains to join them. The CPP divided Samar into six districts. The NPA launched their first operation in Calbiga in 1974, ambushing an Army patrol and seizing weapons. Communists from Manila and Cebu were sent to Samar in 1975. More communists arrived in 1977. A few years later, the group gained support from citizens in Samar due to their stance against cattle rustling gangs. The group expanded their organization in the region by setting up committees and sub-secretariats. They also fought government troops in a series of armed fights. A \"shadow government\" was put and Samar was regarded as one of the most authoritative CPP strongholds.\nIn the mid-1980s, communism gained more support in the region as the coconut industry declined in Samar from alleged suppression by the Marcos government. When Corazon Aquino became president, the regional NPA froze operations in support of the Aquino government. The AFP used this break to gain information to NPA soldiers while Aquino declared \"all-out war\" on the NPA. During the Presidency of Fidel V. Ramos, the government attempted to solve the conflict by negotiation causing the regional NPA to split groups into smaller units.\nTactics\nMost of Samar has mountainous and forested areas. According to a journal, the forested areas make it easier to conduct an insurgency since these areas are barely accessible to military. The low density of Samar also aids the NPA, making it more difficult for the AFP to find them. The regional NPA hires young students from universities in the archipelago due to them being \"idealists\" who \"head to the hills\" in a controlled government. The NPA also hires people raised in poverty to present one of the \"few livelihood opportunities\". The parts where the NPA stay are regarded as poverty stricken. Due to this, the NPA can easily find new recruits. Another tactic used for recruitment is landlessness. According to multiple studies, the effectiveness of land reform in Samar is \"low-to-medium\", with many being murdered for this reason. The regional NPA uses this for recruitment purposes. The NPA also uses government abuses to their benefit. According to a journal, the counter-insurgency movement from the local AFP gives a \"killing field\" reputation to Samar. Due to these counter-insurgency movements, non-governmental organizations sympathize with the CPP. The NPA also aid the areas where it has a strong presence, providing services to communities and acting as \"social police\" when the AFP is not there. Due to this, the NPA assumes an important role into poor farmers lives. To survive in the jungle, platoons have backpacks containing personal items, food, and cooking utensils.\nContemporary incidents\n2000s\n2010s\n2020s\nIn August 2021, an operation in Barangay Osmena, Dolores led to the infiltration and death of 16 communist rebels. The operation started a few weeks earlier when reports mentioned a group of rebels visiting houses in the area. Informants tipped police about the group, which led to the police infiltrating the area. Drones were sent due to landmines. A firefight then ensued until evening which lasted for 13 hours. On August 30, 2024, illegal bombs were found Antipolo, Llorente. Soldiers carefully dug the mines; the operation was successful. The bombs were thought to be from the Apoy platoon, which surrendered shortly after.\nDecline\nStructure\nGovernment response\nLegacy\nReferences\nBibliography\n* }}\n*  |via=ResearchGate}}"
