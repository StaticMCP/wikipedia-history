Disagreements between largely developed and developing economies emerge during this conference over four issues initiated by this conference, which led to them being collectively referred to as the \"Singapore issues\".\n*May 18, 1998 &ndash; May 20, 1998 - Second Ministerial Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.\n*September 1, 1999 - Mike Moore becomes director-general.

The conference itself ends in failure, with massive demonstrations and riots (At least 30,000 protesters disrupt the summit) drawing worldwide attention.\n*November 9, 2001 &ndash; November 13, 2001 - The Fourth Ministerial Conference takes place in Doha, Qatar.  WTO members agree on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA or just Doha Round), the ninth trade round which is intended to open negotiations on opening markets to agricultural, manufactured goods, and services.

An alliance of 22 southern states, the G20 (led by India, People's Republic of China and Brazil), resisted demands from the North for agreements on the so-called \"Singapore issues\", on competition policy and on public procurement in trade talks. Instead, they called for an end to agricultural subsidies within the EU and the US. The talks broke down without progress,  although trade facilitation, one of the Singapore issues, re-emerged with the support from both developed and developing countries in later Doha trade round discussion.\n*December 2003 - WTO rules that duties imposed by the US on imported steel are illegal. US President George W. Bush repeals the tariffs to avoid a trade war with the EU.\n*August 2004 - Geneva talks achieve a framework agreement on the Doha round.
