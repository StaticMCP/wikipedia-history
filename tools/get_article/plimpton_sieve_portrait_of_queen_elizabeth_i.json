It is one of three near-identical portraits of Elizabeth I by Gower that represent the queen holding a symbolic sieve. It was acquired by George Arthur Plimpton in 1930, hence the name. His son, Francis T. P. Plimpton, willed it to the Folger.\nIconographic description\nThree-quarter length portrait of Queen Elizabeth I holding a sieve, with a globe in the left background and the royal coat of arms on the right. The sieve represents her self-identification as the \"Virgin Queen\" by association with Tuccia, the Roman Vestal Virgin who proved her virginity by carrying water in a sieve.\nInscriptions\nThe painting has three areas of text in yellow uppercase letters:\n* \"TVTTO VEDO & MOLTO MANCHA\" at upper left, on two lines, with the last two letters joined; Italian for \"I see everything and much is lacking.\"\n* \"E R\" at upper right, with a gap between the letters; abbreviation for the Latin \"Elizabeth Regina\" meaning \"Elizabeth the Queen.\"\n* \"STANCHO RIPOSO & RIPOSATO AFFANO 1579\" near the upper right, on three lines, with the second and third letters superimposed to form one character; a line from Petrarch's ''Trionfo D'Amore'', IV, 1.145, followed by the year the painting was executed; Italian for \"Weary, I have rested, and having rested, am breathless.\"\nOther versions\nThere are at least two other versions of Gower's Sieve Portrait. One is known only through an 18th-century description by George Vertue. The other measures 34 x 24 inches and is now in a private collection in Florida.\nReferences"
