Together with his History of the Renaissance in Italy (Die Geschichte der Renaissance in Italien; 1867) it is counted among the classics of Renaissance historiography.  An English translation was produced by S.G.C. Middlemore in two volumes, London 1878.\nContent\nAccording to Denys Hay:\n:Burckhardt sought to capture and define the spirit of the age in all its main manifestations. For him ‘’Kultur’’ was the whole picture: politics, manners, religion...the character that animated the particular activities of a people in a given epoch, and of which pictures, buildings, social and political habits, literature, are the concrete expressions.\nIts scholarly judgements are considered to have been largely justified by subsequent research according to historians including Desmond Seward and art historians such as Kenneth Clark.\nThe Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy is divided into six parts:\n# Part One: The State as a Work of Art\n# Part Two: The Development of the Individual\n# Part Three: The Revival of Antiquity\n# Part Four: The Discovery of the World and of Man\n# Part Five: Society and Festivals\n# Part Six: Morality and Religion\nEditions\n*1878.
