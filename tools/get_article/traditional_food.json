Pasta is considered one of the traditional foods of Italy]]\nTraditional foods are foods and dishes that are passed on through generations or which have been consumed for many generations. Traditional foods and dishes are traditional in nature, and may have a historic precedent in a national dish, regional cuisine or local cuisine. Traditional foods and beverages may be produced as homemade, by restaurants and small manufacturers, and by large food processing plant facilities.\nSome traditional foods have geographical indications and traditional specialties in the European Union designations per European Union schemes of geographical indications and traditional specialties: Protected designation of origin (PDO), Protected geographical indication (PGI) and Traditional specialties guaranteed (TSG). These standards serve to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.\nThis article also includes information about traditional beverages.\nDifference between traditional and typical\nin Milan, the oldest restaurant in Italy and the second in Europe]]\nAlthough it is common for them to be used as synonyms, the truth is that \"traditional\" cuisine and \"typical\" cuisine are considered two different concepts according to culinary anthropology; The first refers to culinary customs that are invariably inherited orally, on a small scale in the family, and a large scale in a community as part of its culture and identity. On the other hand, when we speak of typical (or \"popular\") cuisine, it is one that most people in a place like and is massively replicated. Therefore, a traditional dish may be typical and vice versa, but not all the typical dishes are traditional nor all the traditional ones typical.\nMost traditional dishes are originated from the skill of housewives who creatively and sensibly combined the techniques and ingredients they had on hand to create new recipes. If people like that recipe, it becomes worthy of being imitated. In other words, it is spread and replicated so many times that it becomes a classic recipe. For this reason, the culinary tradition is made up of a vast variety of classic recipes, which are necessarily linked to a land of origin, specific products, and specific local habits. There are classic recipes that can fall into oblivion and disappear forever, but if they are consumed massively, they become part of the typical cuisine of a place. The Mexican culinary anthropologist Maru Toledo adds a third concept to this process, which is that of \"typical commercial\" cuisine, something that did not exist until the commercialization of cuisine (a process that has occurred very recently, if we observe the complete chronology of food history).\nCommercialized cuisine\nThe commercialized cuisine appropriates the characteristics of the traditional (even the same adjective \"traditional\", on numerous occasions) but the aim is none other than economic profit. For this reason, it does not want to delve into the origin, nor in the context, much less the diversity around the dishes, it sells. Finally, the mainstream population, generally without much culinary knowledge, believe that the food they are buying is their own, thus happening a kind of food acculturation and simplifying the diversity of products, techniques, recipes and other culinary aspects of the tradition.\nBy continent\nAfrica\ns]]\n* Bambara groundnut – a traditional food crop in Africa\nEurope\nTraditional food products have been described as playing \"an important part of European culture, identity, and heritage\".\nSouth America\ns being cooked]]\n* Humita – a traditional food in Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru\nBy country\nCanada\n* Country food refers to the traditional diets of Aboriginal people (known in Canada as First Nations, Metis, and Inuit), especially in remote northern regions where Western food is an expensive import, and traditional foods are still relied upon.\n* Thanksgiving dinner\nQuébec\n* Poutine  is made with french fries, cheese curds and gravy.]]\n* Tourtière\n* Sucre à la crème\n* Pâté chinois\n* Pouding chômeur\n* St. Catherine's taffy\n* Spruce beer\n* Maple syrup\n* Cretons\nAcadia\n* Poutine râpée\n* Fricot\nChina\ns on the day of Lichun in a restaurant]]\n* Ciba cake\n* Dim sum\n* Fuling jiabing – a traditional snack food of Beijing and an integral part of the city's culture.
