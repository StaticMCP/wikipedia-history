The managing committee of the monument was appointed in 1925. The monument was funded via popular subscription. The design of the monument was awarded to Mariano Benlliure.\nBuilding works started on 2 October 1928. Benlliure reportedly used a horse from the regiment of Hussars of La Princesa as model for the equine figure.\nThe front side of the pedestal features a coat of arms of Spain and an inscription reading:  (\"to the illustrious jerezano, restorer of order, Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja, Peacemaker of Morocco and Marquis of Estella. The grateful homeland\").\nA winged Victory emerges ahead of the front side of the pedestal, grabbing a laurel branch with her right hand and a Pickelhaube general's helmet with her left arm. Both lateral sides of the pedestal feature sculptural compositions. The right-hand one, with the  inscription (\"studying the ultimate breakthrough plan\"), consists of a meeting of generals around Primo de Rivera, also attended by Sanjurjo, Despujols, Fernández Pérez, Saro and Admiral Guerra. The left-hand side of the pedestal features an sculptural ensemble with five moors working the land with two oxen, reading  (\"the point of victory\").\nThe backside of the monument incorporates an allegory of Peace or Plentifulness, holding cereal spikes, with two cornucopias at her feet, as well as a bronze relief consisting of an effigy of Miguel's brother Fernando—fallen in Monte Arruit in 1921—put inside a medallion bordered by laurel wreaths, with an inscription below reading  (\"honoring its heroes\").\nIt was unveiled on 29 September 1929, during a ceremony attended by the dictator himself.\nFile:Monumento a Miguel Primo de Rivera (Jerez de la Frontera).jpg|Lateral side, featuring the meeting of generals\nFile:Monumento Miguel Primo de Rivera.jpg|Closer view of the monument featuring the winged victory\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*\n*"
