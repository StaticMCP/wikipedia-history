Guitarist Neil Harris joined the band as a session musician shortly before their American tour in 2008.\nThe band's self-titled debut album was released in the UK in 2006. Tracks from the album also formed part of their debut American release, Businessmen & Ghosts, which came out in November 2007. The band cites a wide array of influences, including artists as disparate as Bill Evans, Devo, The Grateful Dead, and Yes. WFANFC's sound has been described as \"a flawless lucid-dream trip through a thousand fantastical influences\" and \"as fresh as morning rain on Piccadilly Gardens\". Regarding their importance, major media outlets such as the BBC have stated: \"it’s the way that [WFANFC and The Longcut, another British music group] have distilled Manchester’s history into an exciting future brew that makes them important.\"\nWFANFC's releases have won them praise from a variety of media outlets, including Spin, the BBC, Stylus, and Citylife magazine; their song \"Rocket\" was featured on National Public Radio in June 2007.\nThe band performed on the Topman Unsigned Stage at the Carling Weekend's Leeds Festival in 2007.\nIn 2009 the band was approached by the development team for the video game Infamous to create the song that plays at the end of the game. The song is called \"Silent Melody\".\nThe band released their third album, Jojo Burger Tempest, in October 2010, and in January 2011 the band opened a YouTube channel, uploading snippets of a fourth album, Apoptosis. No record label was named. In 2011, the band released the single \"Turning Shadow\" via their Bandcamp.\nIn 2013, guitarist Gary McClure released his solo record, Wreaths, on AED Records. In celebration of this release, the band's Facebook page shared an unreleased 52-minute-long album titled Odds and Sods posted to member Phil Kay's SoundCloud.\nIn 2014, producer and keyboardist Phil Kay released his solo record, Zoetrope as King of the Mountains on Melodic Records.\nGary McClure currently records under the name American Wrestlers, and released his debut album, American Wrestlers, in 2014. During promotion for the album, he noted the band had broken up. A new album, however, entitled What Do People Do All Day was released in 2016.\nIn April of 2023, WFANFC announced (on their Facebook page) a one-off show at the Mercury Lounge in NYC, on Friday July 21st, 2023.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n* Working for a Nuclear Free City (2006)\n* Businessmen & Ghosts (2007)\n* Jojo Burger Tempest (2010)\n* Odds and Sods (unreleased, 2013)\n* What Do People Do All Day?
