At the present time, the excavations show that the city is located on the India-Nepal border. There is also a municipality by the same name in Nepal.\nThe archaeological site is currently split between Bara district in Nepal in the north and East Champaran in Bihar, India in the south, both falling within the Mithila cultural region.\nHistory\n, a member of the Tughluq court and an ambassador to Iran.

The Tughlaq army invaded Bengal and on his way back to Delhi, The sultan heard about the Simraungarh which was flourishing inside the jungle. The last king of the Karnata dynasty, Harisingh Dev didn't show his strength and left the fort as he heard the news of approaching army of the Tughlaq Sultan towards the Simraungarh. The Sultan and his troop stayed there for 3 days and cleared the dense forest. Finally on day 3, the army attacked and entered the huge fort whose walls was tall and surrounded by 7 big ditches.\nThe remains are still scattered all over the Simroungarh region.
