It never asked for votes; rather, it promoted its activist message by including its shocking logo into the electoral ballots and getting media visibility.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/another-democracy-possible Another Democracy is Possible] Quim Gil, 4 July 2003, Mute Vol. 1, Nº 26 (Summer-Autumn 2003)\n\n---\n\n## Another democracy is possible\n\n#REDIRECT Another Democracy is Possible"
