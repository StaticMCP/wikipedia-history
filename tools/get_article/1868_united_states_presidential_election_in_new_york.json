Voters chose 33 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nNew York voted for the Democratic nominee, former Governor of New York Horatio Seymour, over the Republican nominee, General Ulysses S. Grant. Seymour won his home state by a very narrow margin of 1.18%, making him the first Democratic candidate since Franklin Pierce in 1852 to win the state. Seymour also became the first losing Democratic presidential candidate to win New York.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in New York\nReferences"
