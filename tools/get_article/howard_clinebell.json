He pioneered a counseling approach that combined psychotherapy and religion.\nEarly life and education\nHoward Clinebell was born in Springfield, Illinois, on June 3, 1922, to Howard J. and Clem (Whittenberg) Clinebell. He graduated from DePauw University in Indiana and Garrett Theological Seminary in Illinois, and he received a doctorate from Columbia University. In addition he studied psychotherapy at the William Alanson White Institute in New York City.\nCareer\nIn the mid-1950s Clinebell joined the staff at the First United Methodist Church in Pasadena. He went on to become counselor at Methodist Hospital in Arcadia. In 1959 he joined Claremont School of Theology as a professor of pastoral psychology.

With his book on counseling of alcoholics Clinebell introduced the concept to view alcoholism as a disease rather than a character deficiency in religious circles. Clinebell also wrote an influential book on the spiritual aspects of environmentalism in 1996, \"Ecotherapy: Healing Ourselves, Healing the Earth.\"\nAs one of the fathers of the  pastoral counseling movement Clinebell was an early advocate of training in psychotherapy for seminarians aiming to work as counselors. He was a founding member of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors, along with the group Pastoral Counselors for Social Responsibility. He was also the founding director of the Institute for Religion and Wholeness at Claremont and the Clinebell Institute. In addition, he was a licensed marriage, family, and child counselor.\nBesides pastoral counseling, Clinebell addressed topics like personal problems in the context of relationships, the effects of social systems on individual lives, parapsychology, and the relationship of human beings to the environment.\nPersonal life and death\nClinebell was married to Charlotte Clinebell for almost 60 years, and had three children. He died April 13, 2005, of complications from Parkinson's disease at Vista del Monte Retirement Community in Santa Barbara.\nReferences\nWorks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://pid.emory.edu/ark:/25593/gk3j5 Howard John Clinebell papers, 1949-2002] at Pitts Theology Library, Candler School of Theology\n*"
