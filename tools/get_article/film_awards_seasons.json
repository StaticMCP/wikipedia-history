      "text": "# Film awards seasons\n\nFilm awards season is an annual time period between November and February every year, in the United States, where a majority of significant film award events take place. In October ballots are sent out to voters, to collect nominations for the first award ceremonies, which are usually the Governors Awards or the independent Gotham Awards, to begin awards season in November. The season usually culminates in the Academy Awards in late February or early March (the latter in Winter Olympics years). In 2021, the season ended with the delayed Academy Awards ceremony on April 25, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with many other ceremonies and film festivals moving up their dates, in return.\nThough they only cover film scores and soundtrack albums/songs within their honors, several music awards, including the American Music Awards and Grammy Awards, are also presented during the same film awards season to provide television networks additional event programming.\nList of film awards ceremonies\nOctober\n* Location Managers Guild Awards\n* Saturn Awards\nNovember\n* Gotham Awards\n* Governors Awards\n* People's Choice Awards\n* Hollywood Film Awards\nDecember\n* National Board of Review\n* New York Film Critics Circle\n* Los Angeles Film Critics Association\nJanuary\n* National Society of Film Critics\n* Critics' Choice Movie Awards\n* Golden Globe Awards\n* Producers Guild of America Awards\n* Screen Actors Guild Awards\nFebruary and March\n* Annie Awards\n* Directors Guild of America Awards\n* Satellite Awards\n* British Academy Film Awards\n* Writers Guild of America Awards\n* Independent Spirit Awards\n* Golden Raspberry Awards\n* USC Scripter Awards\n* Academy Awards\n* Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards\nList of film awards seasons\n* 2006–07 film awards season\n* 2007–08 film awards season\n* 2008–09 film awards season\n* 2009–10 film awards season\n* 2010–11 film awards season\n* 2011–12 film awards season\n* 2012–13 film awards season\n* 2013–14 film awards season\n* 2014–15 film awards season\n* 2015–16 film awards season\n* 2016–17 film awards season\n* 2017–18 film awards season\n* 2018–19 film awards season\n* 2019–20 film awards season\n* 2020–21 film awards season\n* 2021–22 film awards season\n* 2022–23 film awards season\n* 2023–24 film awards season\n* 2024–25 film awards season\n* 2025–26 film awards season\n* 2026–27 film awards season\n* 2027–28 film awards season\n* 2028–29 film awards season\n* 2029–30 film awards season"
