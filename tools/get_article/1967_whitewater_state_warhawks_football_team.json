In their 12th season under head coach Forrest Perkins, the Warhawks began the year as the favorite to win the WSUC championship. They compiled an 8–1 record and won the WSUC championship. The team set WSUC records for fewest points allowed (72 points in eight conference games), fewest rushing yards (379), and fewest total yards (1,184).\nSix Whitewater players received first-team honors on the WSUC all conference team: halfback Greg Jones; offensive guard Jim Perkins; defensive end Jerry Mahoney; defensive tackle Larry Dickerson; linebacker Al Equi; and defensive halfback Neil Hansen. End Barry Wojtak and cornerback Jim Olmstead were selected as the team's most valuable seniors.\nSchedule\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Stevens Point, WI\n| score = 13–19\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Hamilton Field\n| site_cityst = Whitewater, WI\n| score = 18–7\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Hamilton Field\n| site_cityst = Whitewater, WI\n| score = 27–19\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = Superior, WI\n| score = 24–0\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Hamilton Field\n| site_cityst = Whitewater, WI\n| score = 13–6\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Hamilton Field\n| site_cityst = Whitewater, WI\n| score = 43–0\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = River Falls, WI\n| score = 26–13\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium =\n| site_cityst = La Crosse, WI\n| score = 6–0\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Hamilton Field\n| site_cityst = Whitewater, WI\n| score = 23–14\n| attend = 7,651\n| source =\n}}\n}}\nReferences"
