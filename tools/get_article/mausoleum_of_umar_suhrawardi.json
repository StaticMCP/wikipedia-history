The complex dates from the Abbasid Caliphate and features a unique conical dome built in the Seljuk architectural style. The mosque is situated near the Sheikh Umar Cemetery.\nArchitecture\nThe mosque was completed in the 12th-century in the Abbasid style, and the mosque was named after Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi who was buried in the nearby cemetery. The mosque was renovated by the Ismail Pasha in 1902 and in 1926; and again in 1964 by the Sunni Endowment Office. In 2010, it was reported that the conical tower was in danger of collapse.\nThe dome was constructed in , as indicated by the inscriptions in Thuluth script above the entrance. The dome's design is similar to structures like the Dome of Ezekiel in Babylon. It has ten layers, the lower six consisting of 16 convex niches with rectangular projections, transitioning through octagonal motifs to a ribbed conical cap. The dome and its inscriptions were reportedly renewed by Jamal al-Din Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd al-Mahmud, as inferred from historical texts. Modern renovations focused on structural stability and preservation following the 2003 Iraq War.\nThe interior features twelve alcoves (three on each wall) with central alcoves adorned by pointed arches supported by plaster columns. Qur'anic inscriptions surround the walls, transitioning to a 16-sided star pattern leading to the hemispherical dome. The square base is approximately  wide and  high. The dome sits atop a drum with intricate muqarnas detailing and is crowned with a ribbed conical structure, tapering into a polygonal peak.\nInscriptions\nThe main entrance of the mausoleum includes the following inscriptions:\n\"}}\nThe conical dome's inscriptions:\n}}\nGallery\nجامع ومرقد الشيخ عمر السهروردي.jpg|The mosque\nمرقد ومقبرة الشيخ عمر السهروردي في بغداد.jpg|The mausoleum in 1924\nSee also\n}}\n* Islam in Iraq\n* List of mosques in Baghdad\nReferences\nExternal links"
