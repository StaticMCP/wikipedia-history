District of Columbia voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson won Washington, D.C. by an overwhelming margin, receiving over 85% of the vote. This was the first presidential election in which the District of Columbia had the right to vote. The District of Columbia has voted Democratic by overwhelming margins every time since this election.\nThis was one of only two elections where Washington, D.C. wasn't the largest margin for either candidate along with 1972, this time being second to a 74.28% margin for Goldwater in Mississippi.\nResults\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in the District of Columbia\nReferences"
