      "text": "# Fujiwara no Hamanari__disambig_1\n\nwas a Japanese noble and poet of the Nara period. He was the son of Fujiwara no Maro, and, according to the genealogy book Sonpi Bunmyaku, his mother was Uneme of Yakami no Kōri, Inaba Province, who is probably the same person who had a famous affair with Aki no Ōkimi. The collection of Japanese poems ''Man'yōshū does not include his works. With an unknown woman he had a son , among other children with other women. The footnote of Sonpi Bunmyaku, however, notes that Toyohiko is actually the grandson of Hamanari. Hamanari achieved the court rank of  and the position of sangi''.\nLife\nAs the heir of his father Maro, the founder of the Kyōke, Hamanari was a central figure of that clan. However, he was almost a generation younger than the second heads of the Nanke, Hokke, and Shikike, and this left him always a step behind their advancement.\nHamanari was conferred the rank of  in 751. Under Empress Kōken, he held high-level positions in various ministries, but his promotion stagnated at this rank until Fujiwara no Nakamaro's rebellion in 764. He supported Empress Kōken's side in the conflict, and was promoted to  a month later. He held a position as director of the gyōbu-shō, and in 772 was promoted to  and sangi, joining the ranks of the kugyō.\nIn 773, Emperor Kōnin's heir  was disinherited, and according to the rekishi monogatari Mizukagami, Hamanari opposed Fujiwara no Momokawa's candidate Prince Yamabe, the future Emperor Kanmu, in favor of his brother by another mother, on the grounds that Yamabe's mother was descended from immigrants from Baekje.\nStill, Hamanari was steadily promoted in Kōnin's court: in 774 to , in 775 to , and in 776 to .\nIn 781, after Emperor Kanmu assumed the throne, Hamanari was assigned away from the capital as director of the Dazaifu. Two months later, he was demoted within that body, had his retainers reduced from ten people to three and his stipend reduced by two-thirds, and was commanded to stop performing his actual duties and leave them to his supposed subordinate. This was likely intended by Kanmu to set an example for his opposition, and perhaps also as retribution. In 782, Hamanari's son-in-law Higami no Kawatsugu rebelled, and Hamanari was implicated and stripped of his high position as sangi. He was never able to return to the center of government. Hamanari died in the Daizaifu in 790, at the age of 67.\nPersonality\nHamanari was well-read, and practiced divination and onmyōdō. He held positions in various ministries, but was unable to produce any impressive results. According to the Shoku Nihongi, this brought suffering to his subordinates and the people.\nFor poetics, he is best known for Kakyō Hyōshiki, the oldest extant piece of Japanese poetic criticism. In it, he attempts to apply phonetic rules of Chinese poetry to Japanese poetry.\nSee also\n* 8th century in poetry\n* Japanese poetry\nReferences\n*\n*  |issue=74 |language=Japanese }}\n*  |volume=27 and 28 |issue=12 and 1 |language=Japanese }}\n*  |language=Japanese }}\n*  |issue=1|language=Japanese }}\nFurther reading\n*[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2719287 JSTOR] Wasp Waists and Monkey Tails: A Study and Translation of Hamanari's Uta no Shiki (The Code of Poetry, 772), Also Known as Kakyo Hyoshiki (A Formulary for Verse Based on The Canons of Poetry) - Judith Rabinovitch - Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 51, No. 2 (Dec., 1991), pp.&nbsp;471–560 -  (Fujiwara no Hamanari is mentioned in the first sentence of the first of the 90 pages of this article.
