The city of , also called Asterisk, has six academies where the Genestella participate in tournaments called |Fesuta}}. Battle performances at , the city's fifth top-ranking academy, are falling significantly and the academy's incumbent student council president, Claudia Enfield, is determined to find a solution to the problem. Kirin Toudou is the academy's top fighter, but Claudia, as well as Lieseltanian princess Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld, are close behind.\nMeanwhile, Ayato Amagiri investigates the disappearance of his sister, Haruka, a former student at Seidoukan. During his first day at the academy, Ayato is forced to fight Julis after discovering her half-dressed when returning her handkerchief to her. Claudia voids their duel and enrolls Ayato in Seidoukan. After rescuing Julis from a plot to cripple the Phoenix Festa, he sets out to become her protector and close friend. Eventually, Ayato wins against Kirin and is named the new top student at the academy. After Ayato participates in the Phoenix Festa with Julis to solve Seidoukan's performance crisis, they continue to participate in various Festas and also fight threats outside of the academy.\nCharacters\nSeidoukan Academy\n;\n:\n: Ayato is the top-ranked fighter at Seidoukan Academy. Transferring to Seidoukan at the recommendation of Claudia Enfield, Ayato searches for his sister Haruka's whereabouts. Afterward, he comes across one of the Four-Colored Runeswords, |Seru Beresuta}}, which was once wielded by Haruka. After rescuing Julis when she was attacked by Silas, Ayato decides that his new goal is to protect Julis. Eventually, after dueling with Kirin Toudou, he becomes the academy’s top student and earns himself the alias of . Partnering up with Julis, they take on the Phoenix Festa together.\n;\n:\n: Julis is the pink-haired fifth top-ranking fighter at Seidōkan Academy, known by the alias of |Gryūen Rōzu}} and is the First Princess of Lieseltania, a small country located in the western Czech Republic. Her full name is Julis-Alexia Marie Florentia Renate von Riessfeld, according to Eishirō. She wields a rapier-type lux called «Aspera Spina» which she uses during the Phoenix tournament and bears the image of a flower for her power - control over flames. Her wish is to achieve what is known as a Grand Slam, a feat that involves rising to take the trophy in each of the three Festa, the Phoenix, the Gryps, and the Lindvolus. Teaming up with Ayato allowed her to achieve victory in the Phoenix and she joins Claudia's Team Enfield to participate in the Gryps.

At the beginning of the series, Claudia recommends Ayato's transfer into the academy. She has held the position of Student Council President since junior high and wants to win the Gryps to make her wish come true because her powers are more geared towards team battles and as such, are not practical in the Phoenix and the Lindvolus. She uses the «Pan-Dora», an extremely powerful Orga Lux with the ability of precognition at the cost of reliving a different way of dying every night in her dreams.\n;\n:\n: The blue-haired daughter of Soichi and Kaya Sasamiya, Saya is Ayato's childhood friend and as such, was taught by Ayato the basics of the Amagiri Shinmei Style. She moved abroad six years ago due to her father's career as a Lux manufacturer and researcher. She seems to be an air-headed stoic who has trouble waking up in the morning and is directionally-challenged. Her main weapons are Luxes that her father made for her, including a Type 38 Lux Grenade Launcher: Helneklaum, a Type 39 Laser Cannon: Wolfdora, and a Type 41 Lux Twin Blaster: Waldenholt.\n;\n:\n: Kirin is a silver-haired student in the junior high branch of Seidoukan Academy.

Well known as a member of the academy's newspaper club, he's also a member of the Shadow Star, a secret police force that works for the Integrated Enterprise Foundation (which is essentially the world government).\n;\n:\n: Lester is the ninth highest-ranking fighter at Seidoukan Academy, his alias being |Koruneforosu}}. Before the beginning of the series, he is ranked 5th but after losing to Julis, his rank drops. His Lux is an ax named «Bardiche-Leo».\n;\n:\n: First introduced as a sidekick of Lester's, Silas is actually the mastermind behind the attacks Phoenix participants. After being defeated by Ayato, he was given a deal by Galaxy, the Integrated Enterprise Foundation, backing Seidoukan Academy, and is put to use as an operative of Shadowstar, as shown in Volume 9.\n;\n:\n: Randy is another sidekick of Lester's and was his partner in the Phoenix before their team was defeated by Irene Urzaiz.\n;\n:\n: Kyouko is the homeroom teacher of Ayato's class. Before becoming a teacher, she was the former second top-ranking fighter of Le Wolfe who led a team to victory in the Gryps Festa, being the only team from Le Wolfe to be victorious. As a student, her alias was |Makiaverusu}} but it is unknown if she kept the alias after graduating (although this seems to be the case as Claudia addresses her by her alias).\nSt. Gallardworth Academy\n;\n:\n: The student council president of St. Gallardworth Academy, Ernest Fairclough is the top-ranked student as well as the bearer of the alias, |Pendoragon}}, a title granted to him because of his wielding of the Orga Lux, also, one of the Four-Colored Runeswords, |Reiguremu}}. He is the leader of Team Lancelot.\n;\n:\n: The Vice-President of St. Gallardworth Academy, Laetitia Blanchard is ranked #2 in her school, known as  and |Guroriāra}}. She is a member of Team Lancelot and seems to harbor feelings of deep affection towards Ernest.\n;\n:\n: Elliot Forster, like Kirin Toudou, is a junior high student and is an exceptionally skilled swordsman, rising to the rank of #12 despite the controlled society of St. Gallardworth. His alias is |Kurau Sorasu}}.\nJie Long Seventh Institute\n;\n:\n: Despite only being nine years of age, Fan Xinglou is the inheritor of the title  and is the student council president of Jie Long Seventh Institute, considrered to be the most powerful Genestella as stated by Commander Helga Lindwall.\n;\n:\n:  Shenyun Li is the ninth-ranked fighter in Jie Long and the brother of Shenhua. He is a very capable fighter, having forced Ayato to break the second layer of the seal placed on him by Haruka. He is a member of Team Huanglong (Team Yellow Dragon).\n;\n:\n:  Shenhua Li is the tenth-ranked fighter in Jie Long and the sister of Shenyun. Shenhua's illusionary techniques are among the most powerful in all of Asterisk. She is a member of Team Huanglong (Team Yellow Dragon).\n;\n:\n:  Hufeng Zhao is the fifth-ranked fighter in Jie Long and one of the main disciples of Xinglou. He is the leader of the Wood Faction and is a member of Team Huanglong (Team Yellow Dragon).\n;\n:\n;\n:\nAllekant Académie\n;\n:\n: A student from Allekant Academy and leader of Pygmalion (Sculptor Faction). Her ultimate goal is to have her puppets gain equal rights to those of humans.\n;\n:\n: A student from Allekant Academy and the leader of Ferrovious (Lions Faction). Her right arm and leg were destroyed in a war, leading Ernesta to give her prosthetics. Her ultimate goal is to create a Lux universally compatible with anyone.

Not much else is known about him.\n;\n:\n: The puppet robot piloted by Ernesta, who displays incredible defenses.\n;\n:\n: The puppet robot piloted by Camilla, who specializes in absolute offense.\n;\n:\n: Known as Magnus Opus, she is the mad scientist behind Ophelia The strongest Strega in Asterisk\nLe Wolfe Black Institute\n;\n:\n: The student council president of Le Wolfe Black Institute, Dirk Eberwein is the first non-Genestella to rise to the position of student council president with wits alone. He is so infamous, he has earned the alias of |}}.\n;\n:\n: The «Tyrant»'s secretary, Korona is a Strega with the ability to predict the future using tarots.\n;\n:\n: Le Wolfe's third-ranking student, Irene Urzaiz is a problem child who owes a huge debt to Dirk Eberwein. She is known as |}} due to her wielding of the Orga Lux, |}}.\n;\n:\n: Irene's younger sister, Priscilla Urzaiz is a Strega with the much-coveted ability of self-regeneration and Irene uses her, much to her reluctance, as a power source for the Gravisheath, whose cost to wield it is to offer it blood.\n;\n:\n: A childhood friend of Julis, Orphelia Landlufen was collateral in the paying off of the orphanage's debt. She was sold to Frauenlob, the Integrated Enterprise Foundation backing Allekant Académie where she was used in an experiment by Hilda Jane Rowlands in order to artificially create Genestella. However, an anomaly in the experiment resulted in Hilda creating one of the world's strongest Strega. Through a series of covert dealings, Dirk Eberwein got his hands on Orphelia and she became a student at Le Wolfe. Her sheer power alone has allowed her to become the two-time champion of the solo tournament, the Lindvolus, defeating even the Sigrdrífa, Sylvia Lyyneheym. She is the top-ranked student in the official charts of Le Wolfe as well as the unofficial ranking websites. Her alias is |}}.\n;\n:\n;\n:\nQueenvale Academy for Young Ladies\n;\n:\n: Sylvia Lyyenehym is the student council president of Queenvale Academy for Young Ladies and is the top-ranked student. Her alias is |}}. She is the world's top idol and is one of the strongest Strega in the history of Asterisk, the runner-up of the previous Lindvolus, losing only because Orphelia Landlufen was in the competition. Due to her popularity, she usually goes out in disguise. She is also in love with Ayato, the first of the five main heroines to realize that fact.\n;\n: Another childhood friend of Ayato's, Yuzuhi reunited with Ayato in the seventh light novel volume. She is also an adept practitioner in the Amagiri Shinmei Style, although her exceptional skill lies in the bow, to the point that Ayato admits that he cannot hope to match Yuzuhi using the bow.\nMedia\nLight novels\nThe series is written by Yū Miyazaki and illustrated by Okiura.
