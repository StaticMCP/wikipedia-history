      "text": "# Timeline of the University of Idaho\n\nOn January 30, 1889, Governor Edward Stevenson of the Idaho Territory signed the territorial legislature's Council Bill No. 20, championed by attorney Willis Sweet and legislator John W. Brigham, which officially established the UI as the upcoming state's land-grant institution.  Nearly four years later, the university opened for classes on October 3, 1892.\nThe choice of location for the University of Idaho was an \"Olive Branch of Peace\" by Gov. Stevenson for his actions in stymieing the nearly successful effort to detach the north Idaho Panhandle and join the state of Washington.[http://www.ucm.uidaho.edu/default.aspx?pid=86022 About the UI - A Brief UI History]\n1800s\n* 1889 – Beta Sigma established as first sorority\n* 1892 – University opens, first day of classes on October 3\n* 1896 – first four undergraduate degrees awarded to:\n** Stella Maude Allen, Florence May Corbett, Charles Luther Kirtley, and Arthur Prentis Adair.  – [http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/pics/2-122-1.jpg photo]\n* 1898  – first graduate degree awarded\n** UI Alumni Association established\n* 1899  – UI opens first summer school in Northwest  – June 21 – [http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/pics/2-110-2.jpg photo]\n1900s\n* 1901 – College of Agriculture established\n** original Engineering Building opens (originally Applied Science, then Mines, then Engineering) – ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/Mines.jpg photo 1]) – ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/Engineer.jpg photo 2]) – demolished in 1951 (unsafe), on site of present Niccolls Building (Home Economics, opened 1952)\n* 1902 – Ridenbaugh Hall completed – ([http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/pics/67-17.jpg photo 1]) – ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/Ridenbau.jpg photo 2])\n** Department of Domestic Science (later Home Economics) established; first in Pacific Northwest – June 11 ([http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=pg1&CISOPTR=2404&action=2&DMSCALE=45&DMWIDTH=512&DMHEIGHT=478&DMX=0&DMY=0&DMTEXT=&DMROTATE=0 photo])\n* 1904 – present Art and Architecture South building completed; originally a gymnasium & armory – ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/1921_Campus_04_AAS.jpg photo]) became Women's Gym in 1928, remodeled for Art and Architecture in 1976\n* 1905 – First National Greek organization in Idaho (Kappa Sigma), arrives on September 30\n* 1906 – original Administration Building ([http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/pics/10-092.jpg photo 1]) ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/Adm_1907.jpg photo-2]) burns down – March 30  – ([http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/pics/1-51-24.jpg photo]) – remains later dynamited – ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120325060212/http://contentdm.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2Fspec_uihp&CISOPTR=10&CISOBOX=1&REC=6 photo])\n** Metallurgical Lab completed, became Mines (1950), Psychology (1961), Art and Architecture (2001) – Pine St. – ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/Morril.jpg photo, left]) – ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/LSS_Admin_Psych_40s.jpg photo, right])\n** Assay Building completed – (later Geology), 1955-84 gallery & museum, demolished in 1984 for Life Sciences North (Gibb Hall)\n* 1907 – Morrill Hall completed – ([http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/pics/73-36.jpg photo 1]) – ([http://www.tomandrodna.com/Morril.jpg photo 2]) – financed with insurance funds from destroyed Administration Building – (originally for Agriculture, then Forestry in 1950) – Idaho Ave. at Pine St.\n** College of Engineering established in cooperation with the College of Mines[http://www.engr.uidaho.edu/100/1907-1957/ 1907-1957 Historical Events, Centennial 1907 – 2007 College of Engineering, University of Idaho]\n** construction of new Administration Building begins\n* 1908 – Olmsted Brothers develop master plan for UI campus\n* 1909 – new Administration Building opens (Tudor Gothic) – ([http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/special-collections/pics/1-52-049.jpg later photo])\n* 1910 – Arboretum begun by Charles H.
