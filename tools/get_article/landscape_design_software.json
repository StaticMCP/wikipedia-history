The former is usually aimed at simple visualization of a garden design, whilst the latter provides tools that allow stylistic representations of a design to be accurately labelled and dimensioned for contractors to interpret and land authorities or local government to sight and approve or otherwise. Since the advent of the personal computer, several software packages have come into existence. The main professional software being:\n* Idea Spectrum's Realtime Landscaping Architect\n* CS Design Software's CS Artisan\n* LANDWorksCAD\n* Keysoft Solutions' KeySCAPE LandCADD\n* Landmark, PRO Landscape\n* Structure Studio's VizTerra\n* VisionScape's VirtualProperty Architect\n* Visual Impact's Earthscapes\n* Asuni's Lands Design\n* Dynascape\n* Vectorworks\n* SketchUp\n* AutoCAD\nProfessional landscape design software requires detailed information to be produced for contract documentation, typically including drawings, specifications, and reports (schedules/bills of quantity). More advanced software automates the generation of such reports from intelligent data in the drawing; this data is usually embedded in labels (annotations) that, in the case of planting, automatically calculate the number of plants based on spacing per area or length. When labelled areas or lengths are modified, the corresponding labels and reports are recalculated simultaneously.\nFeatures\nBelow is a list of some features provided by such software:\n* Video Tutorials\n* Digital Photo Import\n* 3-D View creation\n* Plant Encyclopaedia\n* Plant Selector\n* Growth Zones & Hardiness Maps\n* Images of Plants and Objects\n* Print Shopping Lists\n* Print Design\n* Visualize Plant Growth\n* Outdoor Lighting\n* Irrigation Design\n* Outdoor Furniture\n* Reports/Schedules/Bills of Quantity\n* Labels/Annotation\n* Photorealistic Design Presentations\n* Generating Quotes, Invoices, Reports, Plant Information\nSee also\n* List of 3D terrain generation software\nNotes\nReferences"
