Co-founded by María Cano, it was one of the first stable Marxist political parties in Colombia. It was the predecessor to the modern Colombian Communist Party, formed in 1930.\nHistory\nIt was founded in 1926 during the Third National Worker's Congress, with origins in the Confederation of Workers of Colombia, as well as peasant, tenant, and indigenous groups. Its leadership was composed mostly of peasants with intellectuals, workers, and small landowners as well.\nIn 1927, its first National Convention was held in La Dorada, Caldas. Its entire leadership, being arrested by the police prior to the Convention, ended up instead holding a meeting in the municipality's prison.\nAmong its members were María Cano, Tomás Uribe Márquez, , , Gilberto Vieira White, and .\nThe failure of the 1928 banana strike in Ciénaga, Magdalena combined with the 1930 recession plunged the party into a deep crisis that led to its practical division. Although PSRC co-founder María Cano was not present, she was charged with conspiracy and imprisoned for the strike.\nOn 17 July 1930, the expanded plenary of the party's Central Committee officially renamed the party the Colombian Communist Party, now a member of Communist International. This initiated a campaign of  \"Bolshevikzation\", from which María Cano and Tomás Uribe Márquez would emerge as party leaders.\nSee also\n* Colombian Communist Party\n* Communism in Colombia\n* Santa Marta Massacre\n* María Cano\nReferences\n*"
