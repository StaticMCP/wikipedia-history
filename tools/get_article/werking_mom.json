Club gave the episode a B+ ranking, stating \"'Werking Mom’ is written by Carolyn Omine, who’s been credited with some of the most grounded and surprising (in that good way) Simpsons episodes in recent years...Alongside first-time co-writer Robin Sayers, whose only other IMDb credit is for a Jerky Boys project unpromisingly enough, Omine has penned a spiritual sequel to ‘Homer's Phobia’ that might not equal one of the show’s most groundbreaking and enduringly funny episodes, but is still so locked onto the core of the show’s heart that it provides a blueprint for the show going forward, should anyone in The Simpsons’ hierarchy care to listen.\"\nTony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 3 and a half out of 5 points ranking, stating \"'Werking Mom' is a sweet episode, not unlike mille-feuille pastry. Everyone gets what they want. Lisa finds a place to eat her lunch. Marge is reassured. Homer both regains the will to drink and a place to store his pot. Such is the power of dinner party salespersonship and inclusion, at least of an exciting beat. The jokes work playfully but softly without subversive rancor or larger social commentary. It is a family episode in other people's homes.\"\nSee also\n* Victor/Victoria, a film about a woman who gains notoriety by purporting to be a female impersonator\n* Cross-dressing in film and television\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
