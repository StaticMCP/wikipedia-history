The album features two instrumental tracks \"Born Unto Fire and Passion\" and \"Pulsation\", and a track inspired by the series Xena: The Warrior Princess, entitled \"The Warrior Princess\". Some melodies that can be heard in the song \"Beware the Heavens\" were sampled from a song called \"Translucent image\" by IneartheD (now known as Children of Bodom); the song is featured on IneartheD's 1995 demo Ubiquitous Absence Of Remission. This is the only album where Jesper Strömblad (In Flames guitarist) plays guitar alongside Alexi Laiho; his position was filled in by Roope Latvala on all subsequent albums.\nTrack listing\n*All lyrics by Kimberly Goss.
