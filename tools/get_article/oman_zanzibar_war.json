Zanzibar, a colony of Oman, rebelled with the support of African forces from Mombasa and Pemba Island. Oman had to retake Zanzibar by force, capturing it in a short war. The Omani force was dispatched by Hilal bin Ahmad, eldest son of Sultan Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi.\nReferences\n* A History of the African People.
