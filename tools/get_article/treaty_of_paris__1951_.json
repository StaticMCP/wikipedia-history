The treaty came into force on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002, exactly fifty years after it came into effect.\nThe treaty was intended to bring diplomatic and economic stability in western Europe after the Second World War.  Some of the main enemies during the war were now sharing production of coal and steel, the key resources which previously had been central to the war effort.\nThe Europe Declaration, issued by the representatives of the six nations, declared that the Treaty had given birth to Europe. The Declaration emphasised that the supranational principle was the foundation of the new democratic organisation of Europe. The supranational concept was opposed by Charles de Gaulle.\nEU evolution timeline\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:11951K/TXT Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community] on Eur-Lex\n* [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/collection/eu-law/treaties/treaties-overview.html Treaties overview on EUR-Lex]\n* [http://www.cvce.eu/obj/treaty_establishing_the_european_coal_and_steel_community_paris_18_april_1951-en-11a21305-941e-49d7-a171-ed5be548cd58.html ECSC Treaty (Paris, 18 April 1951)] on CVCE.eu\n* [http://www.historiasiglo20.org/europe/anteceden2.htm History of the European Union 1945–1957]"
