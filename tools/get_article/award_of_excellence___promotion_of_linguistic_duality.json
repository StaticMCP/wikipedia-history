It is given to groups or individuals which are not bound to the Official Languages Act, but whose leadership helped promote Canadian Linguistic Duality, in Canada or abroad, or helped the development of Official Language Minority Communities. The prize was first awarded in 2009 by Commissioner Graham Fraser, and its first recipient was Linda Leith.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nRecipients of the Award of Excellence – Promotion of Linguistic Duality\n!Year\n!Recipient\n!Commissioner\n|-\n|2009\n| Linda Leith\n|Graham Fraser\n|-\n|2010\n| Claudette Paquin\n|Graham Fraser\n|-\n|2011\n| Festival du voyageur\n|Graham Fraser\n|-\n|2012\n| Bernard St-Laurent\n|Graham Fraser\n|-\n|2013\n| Justin Morrow\n|Graham Fraser\n|-\n|2014\n| The Frye Festival\n|Graham Fraser\n|-\n|2015\n| Mariette Mulaire\n|Graham Fraser\n|-\n|2016\n| Canadian Parents for French\n|Graham Fraser\n|}\nThe prize was not awarded in 2017 because there was no permanent Commissioner of Official Languages in office that year.
