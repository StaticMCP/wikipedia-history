Corymbia was created from land formerly within Bellmere and Rocksberg.\nThe locality is named after the tree genus Corymbia; several of the species grow in the Caboolture area.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Corymbia. The nearest government primary school is Bellmere State School in Bellmere to the east. The nearest government secondary school is Tullawong State High School in Caboolture to the north-east.\nReferences"
