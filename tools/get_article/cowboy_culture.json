The term can describe the content or stylistic appearance of an artistic representation, often built on romanticized impressions of the wild west, or certain aspects of people's lifestyle, such as their choices in recreation (including enjoyment of Western movies and music), apparel, and western or southwestern cuisine.\n]]\nOrigins\nThe origins of cowboy culture go back to the Spanish vaqueros who settled in Santa Fe de Nuevo México and Spanish Texas, bringing cattle. By the late 1800s, one in three cowboys were Mexican, and brought to the lifestyle its iconic symbols of hats, bandanas, spurs, stirrups, lariat, and lasso. With westward movement brought many distinct ethnicities all with their own cultural traditions. Welsh Americans, as one example, had a history in Wales of cattle and sheep droving, that incorporated well into ranch work.\nMythologizing\nIn the late 19th century, folk tales about cowboys and attempts to commercialize on cowboy life by selling exaggerated ideas of it in novels and fashion became popular.\nDime novels\nBeginning in the 1860s, dime novels began sharing erroneous and highly romanticized tales of the West, feeding the public's interest in the trade and life West of the Mississippi.\nRadio, film and television\nThroughout the 20th century, radio, film and television had a profound effect on the fashion and mannerisms that built the foundation of what it meant to be living a western lifestyle, however most of this was more Hollywood glitz and glamour than historical narrative.\nRevival\nIn the 1980s, following the urbanization of much of the Texas population, there was a marked revival of cowboy culture with the creation of a number of organizations devoted to its preservation, among them the American Cowboy Culture Association.\nNotable people\nThe following is a list of notable people who lived or are living a western lifestyle post to its technological and societal change at the beginning of the 20th century. This list does not include those of whom lived during the 19th century who were living in what was considered the Old West and preoccupied with the western norms of the day.\nFile:Gene Autry.JPG|\nFile:Roy Rogers in The Carson City Kid.jpg|\nFile:John Wayne in The Star Packer 2.jpg|\nFile:Lynn Anderson on stage April 2011.jpg|\nFile:WesStudi.jpg|\nArt\n*Joe Beeler\n*Albert Bierstadt painter\n*Elsa Spear Byron, photographer\n*George Catlin painter\n*Evelyn Cameron, photographer, writer\n*Deborah Copenhaver Fellows, sculptor\n*Edward S.
