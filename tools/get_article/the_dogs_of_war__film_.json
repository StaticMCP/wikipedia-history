Based on the 1974 novel of the same name by Frederick Forsyth, it follows a small mercenary unit of soldiers privately hired to depose the president of a fictional African country modeled on Guinea-Bissau, Guinea-Conakry, Equatorial Guinea and Angola (as they were in the late 1970s), so that a British tycoon can gain access to a platinum deposit.\nThe title is based on a phrase from William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar: \"Cry, 'Havoc!', and let slip the dogs of war.\"\nPlot\nHaving escaped from Central America with his comrades Drew Blakeley, Derek Godwin, Michel-Claude, Terry, and Richard, mercenary Jamie Shannon gets an offer from Endean, a British businessman working for a tycoon. Endean's company is interested in \"certain resources\" in the small African nation of Zangaro, which is run by the brutal dictator, President Kimba.\nShannon goes on a reconnaissance mission to Zangaro's capital of Clarence and meets British documentary film maker Alan North, who fills him in on the political situation in Zangaro. Shannon's activities arouse the suspicions of the police (especially a suspected dalliance with Gabrielle Dexter, a woman who turns out to be one of Kimba's mistresses), and he is arrested, severely beaten and imprisoned. His wounds are treated by Dr. Okoye, a physician and prisoner who was formerly a moderate political leader. North agitates for Shannon's release, and two days later he is deported.\nWhen Shannon tells Endean that there is no chance of a coup, Endean offers him $100,000 to overthrow Kimba by invading Zangaro with a mercenary army. Endean's employer intends to install a puppet government led by Colonel Bobi, Kimba's greedy former ally, allowing Endean's employer to exploit the country's newly discovered platinum resources, an agreement guaranteed by Colonel Bobi. Shannon refuses the offer and instead proposes to his estranged girlfriend Jessie that they start a new life in the Western U.S. When she refuses his proposal, he accepts Endean's contract on condition that he will have control of the military operation.\nProvided with a million dollars for expenses, Shannon contacts some of his associates from Central America and they meet in London to plan the invasion. The group illegally procures a supply of Uzi submachine guns, ammunition, rocket launchers, mines, and other weapons from arms dealers. North encounters Shannon by chance in London and suspects him of being a CIA agent. Shannon asks Drew to scare North away without hurting him, but North is killed by a hitman hired by Endean to follow Shannon and his crew. Drew captures the assassin, and when a furious Shannon learns that Endean had sent the hitman but that the hitman had killed North on his own initiative, he kills the assassin in turn and leaves the body at Endean's house during a dinner party held for Colonel Bobi.\nTo transport the group and equipment to the coast of Zangaro, Shannon hires a small freighter and crew. At sea, the team is joined by a force of Zangaran exiles trained as soldiers by a former mercenary colleague. Once ashore in a night attack, the mercenaries and their troops use their array of weapons to attack the military garrison where Kimba lives. Drew bursts into a shack in the barracks' courtyard and finds only a young woman with a baby; when he turns to leave without harming them, she shoots him in the back with a pistol. After the mercenaries storm the burning, bullet-scarred ruins of the garrison, Shannon blasts his way into Kimba's mansion. There he finds Kimba stuffing packs of bills into a briefcase; when a whimpering Kimba offers Shannon some of the money to spare his life, Shannon kills him.\nThe following morning, Endean arrives by helicopter with Colonel Bobi and they enter the presidential residence, where they find Shannon and Dr. Okoye awaiting their overdue arrival. Shannon introduces Dr. Okoye as Zangaro's new president, who tells Colonel Bobi that he is under arrest, and when Endean protests (\"This whole country's bought and paid for!\"), Shannon tells him, \"You're going to have to buy it all over again,\" and silences him by shooting Bobi. Shannon, Derek, and Michel load Drew's body onto a Land Rover, in line with the toast they drank on planning the operation \"Everyone comes home\". The film concludes with the mercenaries driving through the deserted streets of Clarence until they are out of frame.\nCast\n* Christopher Walken as Jamie Shannon\n* Tom Berenger as Drew Blakeley\n* Colin Blakely as Alan North\n* Hugh Millais as Endean\n* Paul Freeman as Derek Godwin\n* Jean-François Stévenin as Michel-Claude\n* JoBeth Williams as Jessie\n* Maggie Scott as Gabrielle Dennis\n* Robert Urquhart as Captain Lockhart\n* Winston Ntshona as Dr. Okoye\n* Pedro Armendáriz Jr. as Captain\n* Harlan Cary Poe as Richard\n* Ed O'Neill as Terry\n* Shane Rimmer as Dr. Oaks\n* George Harris as Colonel Bobi\n* David Schofield as Endean's Man\n* Terence Rigby as Hackett\n* Olu Jacobs as Immigration officer\n* Hugh Quarshie as Zangoran Officer\n* Alan Beckwith as Mercenary\n* Randy Quaid as Cameraman\n* Jim Broadbent as Film Crew\n* Ilario Bisi-Pedro as President Kimba\nProduction\nUnited Artists bought rights to the novel in 1974. Don Siegel was going to direct but did not like the screenplay. Wendell Mayes had written a draft, however, Mayes's script failed to gain any interest. Norman Jewison was then attached to produce and direct the film, and Abby Mann wrote a new draft, Jewison was unhappy with Mann’s screenplay, and pre-production stalled. Jewison decided to step down as director, but would stay on as producer, Michael Cimino was hired to write another draft and direct, with Clint Eastwood and Nick Nolte starring, but Cimino dropped out of the film in order to work on ''Heaven's Gate'', and Jewison would hire John Irvin as director.\nGeorge Malko was then hired to write a new draft, Malko went to London and spent 2 1/2 months working on the script with Irving and producer Larry DeWaay, after United Artists greenlit the project, Gary DeVore was hired to rewrite the script.\nPrincipal photography began on February 18, 1980. The opening Central American scene was filmed at the Miami Glider Port southwest of Miami, Florida. Later African country scenes were filmed in Belize City, Belize, and the surrounding area, since Irwin decided shooting the scenes in Africa in real-life would be too risky. The manually-turned swinging bridge shown during the attack is one of the largest of its kind in the world. The film features several weapons that were prominent in popular culture during the 1980s. The Uzi submachine guns used in the film (changed from the German Second World War vintage Schmeissers of the novel) were a mix of real Uzis and set-dressed Ingram MAC-10s. Shannon's grenade launcher, depicted in the promotional poster, dubbed the \"XM-18\" in the film, is a Manville gun – a design later used by the MM-1 grenade launcher. Shooting also took place in New York City and London.\nThis was only the second international feature for director John Irvin, who had worked as a documentary maker during the Vietnam War. He went on to direct stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger (Raw Deal), Don Cheadle (Hamburger Hill) and Michael Caine (Shiner). Cinematographer Jack Cardiff had previously directed an account of mercenaries in Africa entitled Dark of the Sun. Composer Geoffrey Burgon concludes the film with A. E. Housman's Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries sung over the end titles.\nRelease\nThe Dogs of War had its world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 December 1980 before opening to the public the following day. It was released to DVD by MGM Home Video on 20 November 2001 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and later on by Twilight Time (under license from MGM) as a multi-region Blu-ray disc.\nNorman Jewison wrote in his memoirs:\nThe Dogs of War is one film I would rather have directed than produced, but I was proud to be associated with it in any capacity. It had modest success in North America but was well received in Europe, where there is more interest in African politics and a better understanding of the underside of corporate power in poor countries.\nReception\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 70% from 20 reviews.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
