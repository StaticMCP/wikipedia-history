The US$110 million plant, launched by President Hakainde Hichilema, positions Zambia as the third producer of glucose and starch in Africa, following Egypt and South Africa. The facility is designed to process 126,000 tonnes of maize annually, producing glucose, starch, maltodextrin, and animal feed by-products. This development aims to reduce Zambia’s reliance on imports, bolster local agriculture by sourcing maize from local farmers, and create over 1,000 direct jobs, contributing significantly to the nation’s industrialization and economic transformation.\nHistory\nTrade Kings Group was founded in 1995 by Mohamed Iqbal Patel, originally operating from a small garage in Lusaka, Zambia, where it produced Blue Boom Detergent Paste. The company's early years saw it diversify into toilet soaps in 1997 and confectionery by 1998.\nIn 2005, Trade Kings expanded into South Africa by establishing a subsidiary that initially imported confectionery before setting up a manufacturing plant in Johannesburg in 2009. By 2006, it had launched multiple food brands—including Amazon confectionery, Swiss Bake, Big Tree Brands, Yoyo snacks, and Nyama Soya—broadening its FMCG footprint.\nA major vertical integration milestone occurred in 2008 with the commissioning of the Kafue Steel Mills (UMCIL), Zambia's first fully integrated facility converting iron ore into finished steel.\nIn 2018, Trade Kings commissioned a US $40 million detergent manufacturing plant in the Lusaka South Multi-Facility Economic Zone—the largest of its kind in Sub‑Saharan Africa—aimed at curbing cheap imports and boosting local production.\nBy the early 2020s, the group had grown into a region-wide FMCG leader with over 90 brands, manufacturing operations in Zambia and Zimbabwe, and exports to multiple countries, including Malawi, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Africa.\nTrade Kings has been recognized by independent publications as a leader in Africa’s industrial growth, with particular emphasis on its manufacturing scale and regional economic contributions.\nReferences"
