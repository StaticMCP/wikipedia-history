Reproductive rights are a sub-set of human rights pertaining to issues of reproduction and reproductive health.  These rights may include some or all of the following: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to birth control, the right to access quality reproductive healthcare, and the right to education and access in order to make reproductive choices free from coercion, discrimination, and violence. Reproductive rights may also include the right to receive education about contraception and sexually transmitted infections, and freedom from coerced sterilization, abortion, and contraception, and protection from practices such as female genital mutilation (FGM).\n17th century–19th century\n*End of 16th century – In England Sir Edward Coke formulated the \"born alive rule\" in common law, which holds that various criminal laws, such as homicide and assault, apply only to a child that is \"born alive\".\n* 1765 – In England post-quickening abortion is no longer considered homicide in England, but William Blackstone confirms the \"born alive rule\" and calls it \"a very heinous misdemeanor\".\n* 1778 – In Sweden, the first Infanticide Act granted mothers the right and the means for an anonymous birth.\n* 1793 – In the French First Republic, Article 326 of the Code Civil legalized both anonymous and confidential births.\n* 1803 – The United Kingdom enacted ''Lord Ellenborough's Act'', making abortion after quickening a capital crime, and providing lesser penalties for the felony of abortion before quickening.\n* 1810 – The 1810 Napoleonic Code of the First French Empire punished any person who procured an abortion with imprisonment.\n* 1821 – A Connecticut law targeted apothecaries who sold \"poisons\" to women for the purpose of inducing an abortion.\n* 1827 – An Illinois law prohibited the sale of drugs that could induce abortions.

Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), was a landmark decision of the U.S Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects the liberty of married couples to buy and use contraceptives without government restriction. The case involved a Connecticut \"Comstock law\" that prohibited any person from using \"any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception\". The court held that the statute was unconstitutional and that its effect was \"to deny disadvantaged citizens&nbsp;... access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control\".  By a vote of 7–2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the \"right to marital privacy\", establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices.

Republican Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller signed the bill into law the next day. The 1970 law did several things. First, it added a consent provision requiring a physician to obtain the woman's consent before performing an abortion. Second, it permitted physician-provided elective abortion services within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy or to preserve the woman's life. Third, it permitted a woman, when acting upon the advice of a duly licensed physician, to perform an \"abortional act\" on herself within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy or to preserve her life.\n* 1970 – Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970 , which established the Public Health Service Title X program in the United States, provided family planning services for those in need.\n* 1970 – The U.S. Congress removed references to contraception from federal anti-obscenity laws.\n* 1971 – In a 1971 case, Trust Territory v.

Wade, declared all individual state bans on abortion during the first trimester to be unconstitutional, allowed states to regulate but not proscribe abortion during the second trimester, and allowed states to proscribe abortion during the third trimester unless an abortion is in the best interest of the woman's physical or mental health. The Court legalized abortion in all trimesters when a woman's doctor believes the abortion is necessary for her physical or mental health and held that only a \"compelling state interest\" justified regulations limiting the individual right to privacy.\n* 1973 – Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court overturning the abortion law of Georgia. The Supreme Court's decision was released on 22 January 1973, the same day as the decision in the better-known case of Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Doe v. Bolton challenged Georgia's much more liberal abortion statute.\n* 1973 – Denmark granted its permanent residents the right to legal abortion up to the end of the 12th week of pregnancy.\n* 1973 – In South Korea the abortion law was amended by the Maternal and Child Health Law of 1973, which permitted a physician to perform an abortion if the pregnant woman or her spouse suffered from certain hereditary or communicable diseases, if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, or if continuing the pregnancy would jeopardize the woman's health. Any physician who violated the law was punished with two years imprisonment. Self-induced abortions were illegal, and punishable by a fine or imprisonment.\n* 1974 – In Ireland McGee v. The Attorney General [1974] IR 284 was a case in the Irish Supreme Court in 1974 that referenced Article 41 of the Irish Constitution. It concerned Mary McGee, whose condition was such that she was advised by her physician that if she would become pregnant again, her life would be endangered. She was then instructed to use a diaphragm and spermicidal jelly that was prescribed to her. However, Section 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 prohibited her from acquiring the prescription. The Supreme Court ruled by a 4 to 1 majority in favor of her, after determining that married couples have the constitutional right to make private decisions on family planning.\n* 1974 – Emergency legislation was passed by the House of Lords to allow medical staff stationed at Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus to perform emergency abortions for raped women and girls following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.\n* 1974 – Kentucky adopted a law preventing public hospitals from performing abortion procedures except to protect the life of the mother.\n* 1975–1980 – France (1975), West Germany (1976), New Zealand (1977), Italy (1978), and the Netherlands (1980) legalized abortion on demand in the first trimester.

The court ruled that a seven-month-old fetus killed by the man during an attack on his wife could not be defined as a person under the Model Penal Code.\n* 1984 – In July the California Courts of Appeal overturned Superior Court of Los Angeles County judge Eli Chernow, ruling that fetuses could not be buried as human remains in the Los Angeles fetus disposal scandal.\n* 1985 – The Wisconsin law \"Wisconsin Stat. § 940.15\", enacted in 1985, made abortion a crime only after viability, and allowed abortion after viability \"if the abortion is necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman, as determined by reasonable medical judgment of the woman's attending physician.\"\n* 1985 – Article 12's May 1986 supplement to the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Constitution stipulated that \"the abortion of the unborn child during the mother's pregnancy is prohibited by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, except as provided by law.\" The measure was adopted in 1985.\n* 1985 – A directive from the American Samoa Attorney General stated that elective abortions were unconstitutional and such procedures could not occur at public hospitals.\n* 1985 – In Honduras, abortion became completely illegal.\n* 1985 – In Ireland, the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985 allowed the sale of condoms and spermicides to people over 18 without having to present a prescription.\n* 1985 – The British Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 made female genital mutilation a crime throughout the UK.

Physicians performed a Caesarean section upon patient Angela Carder (née Stoner) without informed consent in an unsuccessful attempt to save the life of her baby.  The case stands as a landmark in United States case law establishing the rights of informed consent and bodily integrity for pregnant women.\n* 1990 – The Legislature of Guam enacted a law prohibiting abortion in all cases except when there was \"substantial risk\" to the woman's life or continuing the pregnancy would \"gravely impair\" her health. This law was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union and struck down by the ninth circuit court of Guam in a case called Guam Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists v.

Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U.S. 753 (1994), was a United States Supreme Court case where petitioners challenged the constitutionality of an injunction entered by a Florida state court prohibiting anti-abortion protesters from demonstrating in certain places and in various ways outside a health clinic that performs abortions. The Madsen'' majority sustained the constitutionality of the Clinic's thirty-six-foot buffer zone and the noise-level provision, finding that they burdened no more speech than necessary to serve the injunction's goals. However, the Court struck down the thirty-six-foot buffer zone as applied to the private property north and west of the clinic, the \"images observable\" provision, the three-hundred-foot no-approach zone around the clinic, and the three-hundred-foot buffer zone around residences. The Court found that these provisions \"[swept] more broadly than necessary\" to protect the state's interests. Thus, the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court was affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n* 1994 – The Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act was passed by the United States Congress, forbidding the use of force or obstruction to prevent someone from providing or receiving reproductive health services.\n* 1994 - In re Baby Boy Doe, 632 N.E.2d 326 (Ill.

A second referendum was eventually held nine years later, in which voters approved the legalization of abortion with the same time restrictions.\n* 1998 – The Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring clinics to have an Abortion Clinic License if they wanted to operate. Part of this was a requirement for a transfer agreement between the clinic and a hospital and ambulance.\n* 1999 – In the United States, Congress passed a ban on intact dilation and extraction, which President Bill Clinton vetoed.\n* 1999 - Pemberton v. Tallahassee Memorial Regional Center, 66 F. Supp. 2d 1247 (N.D. Fla. 1999), is a case in the United States regarding reproductive rights. Pemberton had a previous c-section (vertical incision), and with her second child attempted to have a VBAC (vaginal birth after c-section). When a doctor she had approached about a related issue at the Tallahassee Memorial Regional Center found out, he and the hospital sued to force her to get a c-section. The court held that the rights of the fetus at or near birth outweighed the rights of Pemberton to determine her own medical care. She was physically forced to stop laboring, and taken to the hospital, where a c-section was performed. Her suit against the hospital was dismissed. The court held that a cesarean section at the end of a full-term pregnancy was here deemed to be medically necessary by doctors to avoid a substantial risk that the fetus would die during delivery due to uterine rupture, a risk of 4–6% according to the hospital's doctors and 2% according to Pemberton's doctors. Furthermore, the court held that a state's interest in preserving the life of an unborn child outweighed the mother's constitutional interest of bodily integrity. The court held that Roe v. Wade was not applicable, because bearing an unwanted child is a greater intrusion on the mother's constitutional interests than undergoing a cesarean section to deliver a child that the mother affirmatively desires to deliver. The court further distinguished In re A.C. by stating that it left open the possibility that a non-consenting patient's interest would yield to a more compelling countervailing interest in an \"extremely rare and truly exceptional case.\" The court then held this case to be such.\n21st century\n2000s\n* 2000 – In Stenberg v. Carhart, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned a Nebraska state law that banned intact dilation and extraction.\n* 2000 – The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of the United States ruled that companies that provided insurance for prescription drugs to their employees but excluded birth control were violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n* 2001 – The ten-week limit on abortion in France was extended to the twelfth week.\n* 2001 – Minors are no longer required to have parental consent for abortion in France.

This law was repealed in 2007.\n* 2003 – The U.S. enacted the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and President George W. Bush signed it into law. After the law was challenged in three appeals courts, the U.S. Supreme Court held that it was constitutional because, unlike the earlier Nebraska state law, it was not vague or overly broad. The court also held that banning the procedure did not constitute an \"undue burden\", even without a health exception (see also Gonzales v. Carhart).\n* 2003 – Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, 537 U.S. 393 (2003), was a United States Supreme Court case involving whether abortion providers could receive damages from protesters under the RICO Act.  The National Organization for Women (NOW) obtained class status for women seeking the use of women's health clinics and began its court battle against Joseph Scheidler and PLAN et al. in 1986. In this particular case, the court's opinion was that extortion did not apply to the defendants' actions because they did not obtain any property from the respondents (NOW and the class of women).\n* 2003 – The Indiana Supreme Court recognized the medical malpractice tort of \"wrongful pregnancy\" when a woman became pregnant after a failed sterilization procedure. The court decided that the damages may include the cost of the pregnancy but may not include the ordinary cost of raising the child, as the benefits of rearing the child could not be calculated.\n* 2005 – The U.S. Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (implemented in January 2007) prevented college health centers and many health care providers from participating in the drug pricing discount program, which formerly allowed contraceptives to be sold at a low cost to students and women of low income in the United States.\n* 2005 – South Dakota's legislature passed five laws curtailing the legality of abortion in 2005.\n* 2006 – Governor Kathleen Blanco of Louisiana signed into law a ban on most forms of abortion (unless the life of the mother was in danger or her health would be permanently damaged) once it passed the Louisiana State Legislature. The bill would only go into effect if the United States Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. Louisiana's measure would allow the prosecution of any person who performed or aided in an abortion. The penalties include up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $100,000.\n* 2007 – The New Hampshire Parental Notification Prior to Abortion Act, \"an act requiring parental notification before abortions may be performed on unemancipated minors,\" was repealed.\n* 2007 – The Parliament of Portugal voted to legalize abortion during the first ten weeks of pregnancy.

Modeled after a law passed earlier in Texas, it required that any doctor performing abortions also have admittance privileges at an authorized hospital within a 30-mile radius of the abortion clinic, among other new requirements. At the time the law was passed, only one doctor had these privileges, effectively leaving only one legal abortion clinic in the state.\n* 2014 – Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, , was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court allowing closely held for-profit corporations to be exempt from laws its owners religiously object to if there is a less restrictive means of furthering the law's interest. It is the first time that the court has recognized a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief, but it is limited to closely held corporations. }} The decision is an interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and does not address whether such corporations are protected by the free-exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution. For such companies, the Court's majority directly struck down the contraceptive mandate, a regulation adopted by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requiring employers to cover certain contraceptives for their female employees, by a 5–4 vote. The court said that the mandate was not the least restrictive way to ensure access to contraceptive care, noting that a less restrictive alternative was being provided for religious non-profits, until the Court issued an injunction three days later, effectively ending said alternative, replacing it with a government-sponsored alternative for any female employees of closely held corporations that do not wish to provide birth control.\n* 2014 – McCullen v. Coakley, , was a United States Supreme Court case. The Court unanimously held that Massachusetts' 35-feet fixed abortion buffer zones, established via amendments to that state's Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act, violated the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it limited free speech too broadly.\n* 2014 – A bill banning abortion after twelve weeks that was passed by the Arkansas Senate in 2013 was struck down by federal judge Susan Webber Wright, who described the law as unconstitutional.\n* 2014 – The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 ( was signed into law on 30 July by Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland; it commenced on 1 January 2014. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 Act No.35 of 2013; previously Bill No.66 of 2013) is an Act of the Oireachtas which defined the circumstances and processes within which abortion in Ireland could be legally performed. The Act gave effect in statutory law to the terms of the Constitution of Ireland as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the 1992 judgment in the X Case. That judgment (see above events in 1992) allowed for abortion where pregnancy endangers a woman's life, including through a risk of suicide.\n2015\n* 2015 – In 2015, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a decision to strike down the admitting privileges requirement of Wisconsin's Act 37, passed in 2013.\n* 2015 – Until 2015, the law in France imposed a seven-day \"cool-off\" period between the patient's first request for an abortion and a written statement confirming her decision (the delay could be reduced to two days if the patient was getting close to 12 weeks).

The law was later struck down by the Kansas Court of Appeals in January 2016 without ever having gone into effect.\n* 2015 – Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed into law in April 2012 abortion restrictions that prohibited the procedure after 20 weeks. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this law in January 2015.\n* 2015 – California's FACT Act, which mandated that crisis pregnancy centers provide certain disclosures about state services, was passed. The law required that licensed centers post visible notices that other options for pregnancy, including abortion, are available from state-sponsored clinics. It also mandated that unlicensed centers post notice of their unlicensed status. The centers, typically run by Christian non-profit groups, challenged the act on the basis that it violated their free speech. After prior reviews in lower courts, the case was brought to the Supreme Court, asking \"Whether the disclosures required by the California Reproductive FACT Act violate the protections set forth in the free speech clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the states through the 14th Amendment.\" The Court ruled on 26 June 2018, in a 5–4 decision that the notices required by the FACT Act violate the First Amendment by targeting speakers rather than speech.\n2016\n* 2016 – The FACT Act of New York state made patients aware of state-sponsored services that are available at crisis pregnancy centers, rather than what crisis pregnancy centers did or did not offer. The law went into effect 1 January 2016.\n* 2016 – South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley signed legislation that brought into effect a 20-week abortion ban.\n* 2016 – ''Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , was a United States Supreme Court case decided on 27 June 2016, when the Court ruled 5–3 that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. It has been called the most significant abortion rights case before the Supreme Court since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992.\n* 2016 – The Obama administration issued guidance informing states that ending Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood or other healthcare providers that performed abortions might be against federal law. The administration contended that Medicaid law permitted states to ban providers from the program only if the providers could not perform covered services or bill for those services. The Trump administration repealed this guidance in 2018.\n* 2016 – Zubik v. Burwell was a case before the United States Supreme Court on whether religious institutions other than churches should be exempt from the contraceptive mandate, a regulation adopted by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that requires non-church employers to cover certain contraceptives for their female employees. Churches are already exempt under those regulations. On 16 May 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a per curiam ruling in Zubik v. Burwell that vacated the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals and remanded the case \"to the respective United States Courts of Appeals for the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits\" for reconsideration in light of the \"positions asserted by the parties in their supplemental briefs\". Because the Petitioners agreed that \"their religious exercise is not infringed where they 'need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception'\", the Court held that the parties should be given an opportunity to clarify and refine how this approach would work in practice and to \"resolve any outstanding issues\". The Supreme Court expressed \"no view on the merits of the cases.\"  In a concurring opinion, Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ginsburg, noted that in earlier cases \"some lower courts have ignored those instructions\" and cautioned lower courts not to read any signals in the Supreme Court's actions in this case.\n* 2016 – In June, the Women's Rights Foundation in Malta filed a judicial protest requesting access to emergency contraception. In early October, a joint parliamentary committee recommended that oral contraceptives should be sold with a prescription, but that the decision was up to the Malta Medicines Authority. On 17 October, the Malta Medicines Authority approved the sale of emergency contraception without a prescription in all pharmacies in Malta and Gozo, basing its decision to make it available without a prescription on ensuring efficacy of treatment. In December 2016 emergency contraception was available for sale in pharmacies across the Maltese islands.\n* 2016 – An Alabama law is passed banning dilation & evacuation (D&E).

The Obama administration had contended that Medicaid law permitted states to ban providers from the program only if the providers could not perform covered services or bill for those services.\n* 2018 – The Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which recognized \"the unborn\" as having a right to life equal to that of \"the mother\", was repealed by referendum.\n* 2018 – National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra was a case before the Supreme Court of the United States addressing the constitutionality of California's FACT Act, which mandated that crisis pregnancy centers provide certain disclosures about state services. The law required that licensed centers post visible notices that other options for pregnancy, including abortion, are available from state-sponsored clinics. It also mandated that unlicensed centers post notice of their unlicensed status. The centers, typically run by Christian non-profit groups, challenged the act on the basis that it violated their free speech. After prior reviews in lower courts, the case was brought to the Supreme Court, asking \"Whether the disclosures required by the California Reproductive FACT Act violate the protections set forth in the free speech clause of the First Amendment, applicable to the states through the 14th Amendment.\" The Court ruled on 26 June 2018, in a 5–4 decision that the notices required by the FACT Act violate the First Amendment by targeting speakers rather than speech.\n* 2018 – On 4 May, governor Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that would ban abortion in Iowa after a fetal heartbeat is detected, starting 1 July 2018.\n2019\n* 2019 – On 1 January, a law came into force in Arizona that required women to provide detailed medical information that was to be submitted to the state before they were allowed to have an abortion. Among the information the law required abortion providers to collect was whether the abortion was elective or therapeutic, the number of abortions they have had in the past and information on any medical complications they have as a result of the abortion. This information is then collected by the Department of Health Services, which provides the state with an annual report on abortions, along with information on how abortions are paid for.\n* 2019 – The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (Act No. 31 of 2018; previously Bill No. 105 of 2018) came into effect; it is an Act of the Oireachtas which defines the circumstances and processes within which abortion may be legally performed in Ireland. It permits terminations to be carried out up to 12 weeks of pregnancy; or where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman; or where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of the pregnant woman in an emergency; or where there is a condition present which is likely to lead to the death of the fetus either before or within 28 days of birth.\n* 2018 – On 4 May, governor Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that would ban abortion in Iowa after a fetal heartbeat is detected, starting 1 July 2018.

Wade provision that banned third-trimester abortions except in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy endangered a pregnant woman's life. The law said: \"The legislature finds that comprehensive reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion, is a fundamental component of a woman's health, privacy, and equality.\" The bill also allowed qualified health practitioners to perform abortions, not just licensed medical doctors.\n* 2019 – Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. (Docket 18-483) was a United States Supreme Court case dealing with the constitutionality of a 2016 anti-abortion law passed in the state of Indiana. Indiana's law sought to ban abortions performed solely on the basis of the fetus' gender, race, ethnicity, or disabilities. Lower courts had blocked enforcement of the law for violating a woman's right to abortion under privacy concerns within the Fourteenth Amendment, as previously found in the landmark cases Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The lower courts also blocked enforcement of another portion of the law that required the disposal of aborted fetuses through burial or cremation. The per curiam decision by the Supreme Court overturned the injunction on the fetal disposal portion of the law, but otherwise did not challenge or confirm the lower courts' ruling on the non-discrimination clauses, leaving these in place.\n* 2019 – In the United States in June, the Trump administration was allowed by a federal court of appeals to implement, while legal appeals continue, a policy restricting taxpayer dollars given to family planning facilities through Title X.

The Act requires public state universities to offer mifepristone, the abortion pill, to female students at zero cost by 1 January 2023; funding for the program will be paid for through insurance and private grants with $200,000 to each University of California and California State University health clinic for training and equipment. University clinics also have to set aside an additional $200,000 each to set up a student hotline to provide information to women seeking advice and assistance. The bill was approved by both the California State Assembly and California State Senate as amended on 13 September 2019, was enacted by Governor Gavin Newsom on 11 October 2019, and went into effect on 1 January 2020.\n* 2019 – Illinois passed bills, known as the Illinois Reproductive Health Act, that provided statutory protections for abortions, and rescinded previous legislation that banned some late-term abortions and a 45-year-old law that had made performing such abortions a criminal offense.

The new law made several changes to existing abortion laws in the state of Nevada, including decriminalizing the performing of abortion procedures, and removing informed consent laws that said doctors needed to tell women of the \"emotional implications\" of having an abortion and what women should do after the procedure to avoid post-op complications; the latter was changed to require doctors to \"describe the nature and consequences of the procedure\" of abortion to women getting abortions. The law also meant doctors no longer had to collect data about women getting abortions related to their marital status and age.\n* 2019 – U.S. District Judge William Osteen formally struck down North Carolina's 'life of the mother only' 20-week abortion ban in 2019. His judgement pushed the date of which abortions could be performed to the date of viability, which is later for many women.\n* 2019 – The Reproductive Privacy Act banned Rhode Island from restricting \"an individual person from preventing, commencing, continuing, or terminating that individual's pregnancy prior to fetal viability\" or after fetal viability \"to preserve the health or life\" of the pregnant individual. It also forbade state restrictions on contraceptives in Rhode Island, repealed bans on partial-birth abortions in Rhode Island, forbade medical professionals from being charged with felony assault for performing abortions in Rhode Island, and repealed requirements for abortion providers to notify a husband before giving his wife an abortion in Rhode Island.\n* 2019 – Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed the Human Rights and Heartbeat Protection Act, which bans abortion in the state after a fetal heartbeat is detectable.

Gee) (591 U.S. ___ (2020)) was a U.S. Supreme Court case which ruled that a Louisiana state law placing hospital-admission requirements on abortion clinics doctors, which had mirrored a Texas state law previously found unconstitutional under ''Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (579 U.S. ___ (2016)) (WWH), was also unconstitutional.\n* 2020 – A law was enacted in Mississippi banning abortions based on the sex, race, or genetic abnormality of the fetus.\n* 2020 – The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of the United States tried to require employers to offer health-insurance plans that paid for contraceptives. The law specifically exempted churches, but not faith-based ministries. Due to that, religious non-profits like Little Sisters of the Poor were fined if they did not comply. On 6 October 2017, Health & Human Services issued a new rule with an updated religious exemption that protected religious non-profits. But federal judge Wendy Beetlestone issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of that exemption. As well, following the new rule announcement, the state of Pennsylvania sued the federal government to take away the exemption. Pennsylvania asked a judge to order that the Little Sisters of the Poor must comply with the federal mandate or pay tens of millions of dollars in fines.

As the infrastructure was not in place for these new requirements, the two abortion clinics operating in Kentucky had to shut down, making abortion de facto illegal in the state. In response, abortion-rights activists sued the state to challenge the law, with Planned Parenthood and the ACLU stating that the law unconstitutionally bans abortion by introducing requirements that can't be followed or are too arduous to comply with and that it violates patient privacy protections; this led to the law being blocked in federal court later in 2022.\n* 2022 – On 17 June 2022, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution does not protect the right to an abortion.

Both clinics in the state temporarily stopped providing abortions.\n* 2022 – Jefferson County Circuit Judge Mitch Perry issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of Kentucky's abortion-banning trigger law pending further hearings to determine if the ban violates the Kentucky Constitution.

HB 4327 is modeled after the Texas Heartbeat Act and is enforced solely through civil lawsuits brought by private citizens, making it exceedingly difficult for abortion providers to challenge the constitutionality of the statute in court. Oklahoma thus became the first state to ban abortion from the moment of fertilization since Roe v. Wade.\n* 2022 – Wisconsin banned abortion immediately after the 2022 Supreme Court decision ''Dobbs v.

The ruling defined \"woman\" as all persons who require access to safe abortion, along with cisgender women, thus including transpersons and other gender-diverse persons as well as cisgender women.

The Supreme Court of the United States ruled unanimously on 13 June 2024, that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine (AHM) did not have association standing under Article III to bring a case, since neither AHM nor the groups it represented had shown injury.

United States, 603 U.S. ___ (2024), was a United States Supreme Court case about whether an Idaho abortion law conflicted with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).
