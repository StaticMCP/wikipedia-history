There were 11 of the 30 seats of the council up for election, being the usual third of the council plus a by-election in Hoe Valley ward. The election took place at the same time as other local elections across England.\nPrevious council composition\nThe Liberal Democrats have had a majority of seats on the council since 2022, winning a further additional four seats in this election to strengthen their hold. The Conservatives have lost seats in every Woking Borough Council election from 2018 onwards and the Labour Party has now been reduced to just one seat. With the exception of Labour’s single seat and the five independent councillors, no other political party has a seat on the council.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | After 2023 election\n! colspan=\"3\" | Before 2024 election\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Party\n!
