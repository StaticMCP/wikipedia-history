Situated in the desert southwest, for millennia the area was home to a series of Pre-Columbian peoples. By 1 AD, the dominant groups in the area were the Hohokam, the Mogollon, and the Ancestral Puebloans (also known as the Anasazi).  The Hohokam dominated the center of the area which is now Arizona, the Mogollon the southeast, and the Puebloans the north and northeast. As these cultures disappeared between 1000 and 1400 AD, other Indian groups settled in Arizona.  These tribes included the Navajo, Apache, Southern Paiute, Hopi, Yavapai, Akimel O'odham, and the Tohono O'odham.\nThe first European presence in the state were the Spanish. In 1539 Marcos de Niza explored the area, followed by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado the following year. Spanish missionaries began to settle in the southern portion of the state, near present-day Tucson, around 1700, but did not move further north.  With the construction of the Presidio San Augustin del Tucson, on August 20, 1775, Tucson became the first European city in what would become Arizona. In 1822, Arizona became part of the state of Sonora, Mexico, but most of current Arizona was transferred to the United States as a result of the Mexican–American War, with the rest transferring with the completion of the Gadsden Purchase in 1853.  During the American Civil War, both sides laid claim to Arizona, although the North and South split the New Mexico/Arizona area differently: the South split the territory into north and south divisions, creating Confederate Arizona, while the northern section remained part of the United States as the New Mexico Territory; while the North in 1863, after driving Confederate forces from the Tucson area, created the Arizona Territory from the New Mexico Territory by splitting off the western section. Prescott became the territory's first capital, which would transfer to Tucson in 1867, then back to Prescott in 1877, before settling finally in Phoenix in 1889.\nArizona achieved statehood in 1912, becoming the 48th state, with Phoenix remaining the capital of the new state.  In the 1900s, the state, particularly the Phoenix Metropolitan area, has seen tremendous population growth.  Phoenix currently ranks as the 6th most populous city in the nation.\nPre-Columbian and Spanish eras\nPre-Columbian\n* ca. 9,000 BC – Paleo-Indians arrive in the southwest, including Arizona, known as the Clovis culture, they were hunter-gatherers.\n* ca. 4,500 BC – Maize is introduced into the southwest United States, including Arizona.\n* ca. 1,500 BC – Pre-Columbian Indians begin developing irrigation systems.\n* 1,250 BC – Las Capas, slightly north of present-day Tucson, settled by pre-Columbian peoples, centered on an irrigation system.\n* 600 BC–550 AD – Ancestral Puebloans begin to settle on the Four Corners area.\n* 1–300 AD – Hohokam establish several villages along the Gila River.\n* 200 AD – The Mogollon culture begins to appear in the southeast area of Arizona.\n* 300 AD – Ceramics appear in the Hohokam culture.\n* ca. 450 AD – Pueblo Grande settled.\n* 600–1300 AD – Hohokam build large network or irrigation canals throughout the area.\n* 875 AD – Patayan peoples appear along the Colorado River.\n* 899 AD – Major floods along Salt River disrupt Hohokam irrigation systems.\n* 1000 AD – The Kayenta tradition of the Ancestral Puebloans develops in northern Arizona.\n* 1100 AD – The Hopi found the village of Oraibi, the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in North America.\n* 1276–99 AD – Severe drought hits the Colorado Plateau.\n* 1276–99 AD – Grasshopper Pueblo founded by the Mogollon and Ancestral Puebloans.\n* 1300 AD – Ancestral Puebloans abandon their communities in north Arizona.\n* 1300 AD – Hohokam have largest population in the southwest.\n* 1300 AD – Awatovi founded by the Hopi.\n* 1300 AD – The Yavapai, descended from the Patayan, begin settling in Arizona near the southern extent of the Colorado Plateau.\n* 1370s AD – Drought hits the Hopi areas.\n* 1300–1450 AD – Periods of drought alternate with flooding in the Salt River area.\n* 1400 AD – The Athabaskan ancestors of the Navajo enter Arizona.\n* 1430s AD – Drought hits the Hopi areas.\n* 1440s AD – Drought hits the Hopi areas.\n* ca. 1450 AD – Pueblo Grande abandoned due to drought.\n* 1455–65 AD – Drought hits the Hopi areas.\nArrival of the Spanish\n* 1539 – Marcos de Niza, a Franciscan missionary, leads an expedition which passes through eastern Arizona.\n* 1540–42 – Francisco Vázquez de Coronado leads an expedition, part of which explores Arizona.\n* 1583 – Antonio de Espejo's explores eastern Arizona, discovers mines near present-day Jerome.\n* 1598 – Juan de Ornate leads an expedition into Arizona, explores the Verde Valley.\n* 1687 – Jesuit priest Eusebio Kino establishes missions among the Tohono O'odham people along the Santa Cruz River.\n* 1691 – Kino establishes the Mission Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi.\n* 1694 – Kino explores Arizona, discovers the ruins of Casa Grande.\n* 1732 – Mission San Xavier del Bac founded by Jesuits near present-day Tucson.\n* 1736 – Silver discovered on the ranch of the Basque settler, , near the Guevavi mission.
