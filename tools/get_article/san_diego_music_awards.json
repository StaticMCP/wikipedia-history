The awards show benefits the San Diego Music Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting San Diego music education programs.\nThe show has featured awards in a variety of categories covering nearly every genre of music, and featured live performances by such major-label recording artists as Blink-182, Switchfoot, Jason Mraz, P.O.D., Pierce the Veil, as well as lesser known up-and-coming artists, such as Schizophonics, The Beat Farmers, Gilbert Castellanos, Whitney Shay and others.\nThrough 2025, the annual awards have raised over $915,000 for its Guitars for Schools program, which has provided free instruments and lessons for more than 75,000 students across San Diego County over the past three decades.\nCountry Dick Montana Lifetime Achievement Award\nEach year the San Diego Music Awards honors an outstanding musician with the Country Dick Montana Lifetime Achievement Award.
