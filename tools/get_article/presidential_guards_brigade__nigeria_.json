The members of the brigade are a group of Nigerian soldiers who guard the residence of the President and his guests, as well as perform ceremonial duties. Also referred to as the Brigade of Guards, this unit, according to AllAfrica with reference to a senior army official, \"does not answer to Army Headquarters or to the Chief of Army Staff in any operational matters and its commander is completely integrated into the President's security team.\"\nComposition\nIt is composed of the following smaller units:\n* Headquarters\n*3 Guards Battalion\n*4 Guards Battalion\n*7 Guards Battalion (Lungi Barracks, Maitama)\n*26 Guards Battalion\n*102 Guards Battalion (Suleja)\n*176 Guards Battalion (Gwagwalada)\n*177 Guards Battalion (Keffi)\n*Guards Brigade Medical Centre (Yakubu Gowon Barracks, Mambilla, Asokoro)\n*Guards Brigade Band\n**Presidential Pipe Band\n*Silent Drill Platoon\nHistory\nand General Olusegun Obasanjo at a welcoming ceremony performed by the Guards Brigade.]]\nThe Presidential Guard Brigade of the Nigerian Army was formed in September 1962 as the Federal Guards. It was created for the purpose of carrying out ceremonial and security duties in Lagos and Abuja similar to the role of the British Household Division in London. In May 1966, Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, who was the leader of the Nigerian military junta, renamed the Federal Guards to the National Guards. The soldiers who killed Ironsi on 29 July 1966, were drawn from the National Guards unit in Lagos. This operation lead to significant controversy over the area of responsibility and chain of command within the brigade.\nIn late 2018, the brigade was accused of carrying out a massacre in the capital of Abuja against Shia Muslims who were members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria. The protesters of the IMN who were at the scene were protesting the imprisonment of Ibrahim Zakzaky, a Shia cleric who is the leader of the IMN and has stayed in detention since December 2016. At least 45 IMN protesters were killed in the massacre.\nProtective duties\nThe Guards Brigade provides security for the following individuals in the Nigerian presidential line of succession and with relevance to the President:\n*President of Nigeria\n*First Lady of Nigeria\n*Vice President of Nigeria\n*President of Senate\n*Speaker House of Representatives\n*Chief Justice of Nigeria\nIt works with the Nigeria Police Force in securing any area in the Federal Capital Territory.\nCeremonial actions and other traditions\ninspecting the Guards Brigade during a visit to Nigeria in June 2009.]]\nMembers of the brigade stand at the Presidential Villa in Aso Rock and also raise and lower the national flag at ceremonies and parades.
