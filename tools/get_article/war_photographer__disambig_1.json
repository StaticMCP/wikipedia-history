As well as telling the story of an iconic man in the field of war photography, the film addresses the broader scope of ideas common to all those involved in war journalism, as well as the issues that they cover.\nThe documentary won a 2003 Peabody Award, and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2002 and an Emmy Award in 2004. It also won or was nominated for more than 40 other awards internationally.\nSynopsis\nOne of the main themes of the documentary is the level to which a journalist should become involved in the events that they are there to document. James Nachtwey credits the intimacy of his photography to his emphasis on establishing a rapport with his subjects, often despite a significant language barrier. Des Wright, a cameraman with Reuters, describes the problem of being too far removed from what is happening.  Discussing a video reel of President Suharto's resignation and a police crackdown on protestors, he notes: \"[Some journalists] say, 'I'm sorry, I'm a journalist, I'm not a part of this.' And I say, but you are a part of it. I think a lot of people would be quite happy for that man to be killed so they can get the particular picture that they want.\"\nThe documentary uses footage filmed with a small \"microcam\" video camera mounted on Nachtwey's SLR cameras. This allows the viewer to see the events from the perspective of the photographer.\nEvents and locations depicted in the film\n* Post-war Kosovo\n* Poverty and riots in Jakarta, Indonesia\n* Ramallah, the West Bank\n* A sulfur mine at Ijen in East Java, Indonesia\n* New York City, New York, United States\n* Hamburg, Germany\n* Thokoza, South Africa\nAwards\n*2003 Peabody Award\n*Nominated for an Academy Award, 2002\n*Nominated for an Emmy Award, 2004\nReception\nWar Photographer has an approval rating of 80% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 25 reviews, and an average rating of 6.92/10.
