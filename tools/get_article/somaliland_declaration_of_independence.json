The following day, on 27 June 1960, the newly convened Somaliland Legislative Assembly approved a bill that would formally allow for the union of the State of Somaliland with the Trust Territory of Somaliland on 1 July 1960.\nMuhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, who had previously served as an unofficial member of the former British Somaliland protectorate's Executive Council and the Leader of Government Business in the Legislative Council, became the Prime Minister of the State of Somaliland during its planned transition to union with the Trust Territory of Somaliland under Italian Administration, the former Italian Somaliland.\nDuring its brief existence, the State of Somaliland received international recognition from 35 countries, including China, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Israel, Libya, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which sent a congratulatory message:\nThe United Kingdom signed several bilateral agreements with Somaliland in Hargeisa on 26 June 1960,}}\nThere were also fears of clashes with populations in Ethiopia.\nOn 1 July 1960, five days after the former British Somaliland protectorate obtained independence as the State of Somaliland, the territory united as scheduled with the Trust Territory of Somaliland to form the Somali Republic (Somalia). ♦♦♦ -->\nA government was formed by Abdullahi Issa, with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister, later to become President (from 1967 to 1969). On 20 July 1961, and through a popular referendum, the Somali people ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960. The constitution was widely regarded as unfair in the former Somaliland, however, and over 60% of the northern voters were against it in the referendum. Regardless, it was signed into law. Widespread dissatisfaction spread among the north's population, and British-trained officers attempted a revolt to end the union in December 1961. Their uprising failed, and Somaliland continued to be marginalized by the south during the next decades.\nSomaliland peace process\nof the Dhulbahante who tabled the case for succession]]\nAfter the SNM was able to exert control over Somaliland, the organisation quickly opted for a cessation of hostilities and reconciliation with non-Isaaq communities. A peace conference occurred in Berbera between 15 and 21 February 1991 restore trust and confidence between Somaliland communities whereby the SNM leadership had talks with representatives from the Issa, Gadabursi, Dhulbahante and Warsangeli clans. This was especially the case since non-Isaaq communities were said to have been largely associated with Siad Barre's regime and fought on opposing side of the Isaaq.\nThis conference laid the foundation for the \"Grand Conference of the Somaliland Clans\" which occurred in Burao between 27 April and 18 May 1991 which aimed to bring peace to Somaliland. After extensive consultations amongst clan representatives and the SNM leadership, it was agreed that Northern Somalia (formerly State of Somaliland) would revoke its voluntary union with the rest of Somali Republic to form the \"Republic of Somaliland\". Although there were hopes amongst of Somaliland communities for succession as early as 1961, the SNM did not have a clear policy on this matter from the onset. However, any nationalistic objectives amongst SNM members and supporters was abruptly altered in light of the genocide experienced under the Barre regime. As a result, strengthening the case for succession and reclamation of independence to the territory of State of Somaliland. Garaad Cabdiqani Garaad Jama who led the Dhulbahante delegation was first to table the case for succession.\nSigning of the declaration\nThe signing of the Somaliland Declaration of Independence occurred on 5 May resolution of the Burao grand conference. At the second national meeting on 18 May, the SNM Central Committee, with the support of a meeting of elders representing the major clans in Somaliland, declared the restoration of the Republic of Somaliland in the country short-lived independent Government of Somaliland and formed a government for the sovereign country.\nContents of Declaration\n# In Woqooyi gaar isu taago oon la raacin Koonfur (The North should stand up and not follow the South)\n# In lagu dhaqmo shareecada Islaamka (Practice Islamic law)\n# In la sugo nabadgelyada Woqooyi (Secure the security of the North)\n# In si dhakhso ah loo dhiso dawlad Woqooyi (Quickly establish the Northern government)\n# In golayaasha ururka iyo dawladda si caddaalad ah loogu qaybiyo beelaha Woqooyi (That the councils of the organization and the government be fairly distributed among the northern communities)\n# Arrinta nabadgelyada Sanaag in si gaar ah wax looga qabto oo gudi loo Saaro (The security issue in Sanaag should be dealt with separately and a committee should be established)\nList of signatories\nSeventeen Somali Sultans from Sool, Sanaag, Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed and Togdheer signed the Declaration of Independence of Somaliland.\n.]]\n, Sultan Mahamed Sultan Abdiqadir, was one of the signatories of the Somaliland Declaration of Independence.]]\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!Order of Signatures!!Name!!Somali Name!!Area\n|-\n|Top||Sultan Mohamed Sultan Farah||Suldaan Maxamed Faarax ||Woqooyi Galbeed\n|-\n|1||Sheikh Ibrahim Sheikh Yusuf Sheikh Madar||Shiikh Ibraahim Sh.

Many former SNM members were key in the formation of the government and constitution. The official proclamation of independence from the Government of Somalia is dated to the week ending 8 June 1991.\nIn May 1993 the Borama Conference took place to elect a new president and Vice President. The conference was attended by 150 elders from the Isaaq (88), Gadabursi (21), Dhulbahante (21), Warsengali (11) and Issa (9) communities and was endorsed by the SNM. As a result, the conference granted the government of Somaliland local legitimacy beyond the realms of the Isaaq dominated SNM, especially since the town of Borama was predominantly inhabited by the Gadabursi.\nAt this conference, the delegates agreed to establish an executive president and a bicameral legislature whereby Somaliland's second president Muhammad Haji Egal was elected. Egal would be re-elected for a second term in 1997.\nSomaliland constitutional referendum\n]]\nOn 31 May 2001, a referendum was held on a draft constitution that affirmed the independence of Somaliland from Somalia.
