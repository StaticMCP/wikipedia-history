Set in 1966, the film chronicles the story of a young woman who is institutionalized after setting fire to a house and who finds herself haunted by the ghost of a former inmate at the psychiatric ward. The Ward would be John Carpenter's last directorial project until his return with Suburban Screams in 2023.\nThe film was shot on location at the Eastern State Hospital in Medical Lake, Washington.\nPlot\nIn rural Oregon, at the North Bend Psychiatric Hospital in 1966, a young patient named Tammy is killed by an unseen force at night.\nKristen, a troubled young woman, sets fire to an abandoned farmhouse and is arrested. The local police take her to North Bend, where she meets the other patients in the ward: artistic Iris, seductive Sarah, wild Emily, and child-like Zoey. Kristen is taken to a room previously occupied by their friend, Tammy, and meets therapist Dr. Stringer. She reveals that she is unable to recall anything about her past. She is attacked by a horribly deformed figure that had been staring at her earlier, but upon telling the nurse this, she is drugged and put through intense electroshock therapy.\nDr. Stringer uses hypnotherapy to unlock Iris's hidden memories. After the session, Iris is killed by transorbital lobotomy by the deformed figure. Kristen finds Iris' sketch of her attacker with the name 'Alice Hudson', a former patient at the hospital. That night, Kristen and Emily attempt to find Iris and escape. However, Kristen is thwarted by Alice and loses consciousness while Emily is caught.\nAlice kills Sarah. Kristen discovers that all the girls had killed Alice together because Alice constantly hurt them. Now she is after the girls for revenge. Kristen tries to talk Emily down from attempting suicide but Alice kills her by slitting her throat with a scalpel. Kristen plans to escape again by holding Zoey as a pretend hostage but is drugged and placed in a straitjacket. She escapes it and she and Zoey try to get out. Zoey is killed by Alice off-screen. After a lengthy chase, Kristen seemingly manages to destroy Alice. She finds Alice's file in Dr. Stringer's office, which has each of the girls' names, including Kristen herself.\nDr. Stringer, catching her in his office, reveals that Kristen is actually one of many personalities of the real Alice Hudson, who was kidnapped at age eleven, eight years earlier, and left chained for two months in the basement of the same farmhouse Kristen burned down. In order to survive the trauma, she developed Dissociative Identity Disorder, creating each one of the girls from the ward as a different personality. Over time, Alice's own personality became so overwhelmed by the others that she became lost. Dr. Stringer attempted experimental techniques to bring Alice's own personality back, resulting in the manifestation of Ghost Alice, who destroyed the individual personalities one by one. Her treatments were working until 'Kristen' appeared, as an attempt of Alice's mind to protect the other personalities so she wouldn't need to face her trauma.\nAs the Kristen personality tries to come to terms with all this, Ghost Alice appears before her and the two begin to fight, each determined to emerge as the dominant personality. During this hallucinatory altercation, \"Kristen\" falls out the window and hits the ground several stories below. Alice manages to survive the incident, and the Kristen personality finally fades away, reverting Alice to her true self. While being treated for her injuries, Alice is visited by her parents, whom her other personalities had originally written off as strangers. She tells Dr. Stringer that she remembers what happened and finally accepts that she has to face her trauma, resolving not to run from it anymore.\nAt the end of the movie, Alice, who has seemingly been rehabilitated, packs her belongings as she prepares to leave the hospital. But, when she opens the medicine cabinet above her sink, Kristen lunges out at her, suggesting that the personality is still strong and refuses to be destroyed.\nCast\n*Amber Heard as Kristen.

According to Carpenter, \"I was burned out...I had fallen out of love with cinematic storytelling\". Despite this, in the meantime he had done two episodes for the anthology TV show  Masters of Horror. Carpenter said that the series reminded him of why he fell in love with the craft in the first place. Carpenter said that the script \"came along at the right time for me\", and he was particularly fascinated by how the film took place within a single location.\nThe film was shot on location in Spokane, Washington, and at the Eastern State Hospital in Medical Lake, Washington. The outside of the hospital is based on the real life, now demolished, McAuley hospital set in the adjacent town of Coos Bay, OR. The film was shot at a real operating mental hospital, and the crew was caged in to prevent patients from intervening.\nRelease\nThe first footage revealed from the film was on the French channel Canal+. The film premiered on September 13 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. The Ward was released in the UK on January 21, 2011. After its debut in a handful of film festivals in late 2010, The Ward was released in a few US theatres on July 8, 2011, where it grossed $7,760. The worldwide gross was $5.3 million. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the US on August 16, 2011, and in the UK on October 17, 2011.\nReception\nThe Ward received generally negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 34% of 73 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.5/10. The site's consensus states: \"Lacking the hallmarks of his best work, The Ward proves to be a disappointingly mundane swan song for director John Carpenter.\" Metacritic rated it 38/100 based on 18 reviews.\nDennis Harvey of Variety wrote, \"As usual Carpenter uses the widescreen frame with aplomb, but pic suffers from too little character detailing (even if a late twist explains that), rote scares, and emphasis on a hectic pace over atmosphere.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"an atmospheric supernatural thriller that has been stripped of the filmmaker's later excesses\". Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote, \"Tight as a drum and plenty of fun, John Carpenter's first film in nine years is hardly a groundbreaker, but when the execution is this expert, why complain?\" Film Journal International wrote, \"Genre veteran John Carpenter's sleekly professional ghost story is well-acted and directed but sadly derivative. Horror fans have seen it all before.\" The Guardian's Phelim O'Neill also considered the film to be unoriginal, but nevertheless \"a well-made film, with some finely crafted shocks\".\nJeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote that the film \"continues the painful decline of a director who seems more nostalgic for past glories than excited about new ideas\".  Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \"feels like a foot-wetting exercise rather than a full-bodied romp in familiar waters\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it B− and wrote, \"While he does bring his trademark craftsmanship to this snake-pit mental-asylum thriller, the picture has too many old-movie bits rattling around in it.\" Adam Nayman of Fangoria wrote, \"The problem with The Ward is not so much its lack of style as the fact that the director doesn't seem to have much interest in the material\".  David Harley of Bloody Disgusting rated it 1/5 stars and wrote, \"If someone other than Carpenter had been at the helm of The Ward, then no one would be talking about it.\" Serena Whitney of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \"''John Carpenter's The Ward'' is a mediocre thriller that lacks any true original scares and blatantly rips off a twist ending from a far better film.\"\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
