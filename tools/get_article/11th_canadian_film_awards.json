Several production companies had been established, sound stages had been built; it was an encouraging atmosphere in which to recognize the previous year's filmmakers. The ceremony was hosted by W. J. Sheridan, the president of the Canadian Public Relations Society.\nWinners\n*Film of the Year: Not awarded\n*Feature Film: No entries submitted\n*Theatrical Short: The Tall Country — Parry Films, Lew Parry producer, Osmond Borradaile director\n::Money Minters — Crawley Films, Ted De Wit producer and director\n::The Quest — National Film Board of Canada, Nicholas Balla producer, Stanley Jackson director\n*Arts and Experimental: Not awarded\n*TV Information: 'Winter Crossing at L'Isle-Aux-Coudres — National Film Board of Canada, Pierre Perrault producer, René Bonnière and Pierre Perrault, directors\n::One Day's Poison — National Film Board of Canada, David Bairstow producer, Donald Wilder director\n::Blood and Fire' — National Film Board of Canada, Wolf Koenig and Roman Kroitor producers, Terence Macartney-Filgate director\n*Films for Children: Not awarded\n*Travel and Recreation: 'Grey Cup Festival '58 — Chetwynd Films, Arthur Chetwynd producer and director\n::Quetico — Christopher Chapman and Bill Mason producers, Christopher Chapman director\n*General Information: The Living Stone — National Film Board of Canada, Tom Daly producer, John Feeney director\n*Public Relations: Saskatchewan, Our University — Crawley Films, Edmund Reid producer and director\n*Sales Promotion: Beauty to Live With — Crawley Films, Edmund Reid director\n*Training and Instruction: Fire in Town — National Film Board of Canada, Peter Jones producer, Julian Biggs director\n*Filmed Commercial: Du Maurier Cigarettes — Omega Productions, Richard J.
