The color scheme used for the insignia's chevron design was defined as golden olive drab chevrons on a dark blue-black wool background for wear on \"winter\" uniform dress coats and dress shirts or silvery-khaki chevrons on a dark blue-black cotton background for wear on the various types of field jackets and \"winter\" uniform fatigue shirts. An unauthorized variant that nevertheless saw wide use was olive drab chevrons on a khaki cotton background for wear on the \"summer\" uniform dress coats (introduced in 1929 and discontinued for issue in 1938) and dress shirts. This scheme of rank insignia was established by War Department Circular No. 303 on 5 August 1920 and would see two significant changes in 1942. The usage of this style of insignia was ended by Department of the Army Circular No. 202, dated 7 July 1948, which provided for significant changes in both rank and insignia design.\nPay grades, 1920-1942\nEnlisted men\nIn 1920, the United States Army pay grade system was modified so the enlisted ranks were completely separated from the officer ranks. Previously, the grades of pay were numbered from 1 (general or admiral) to about 21 (private or apprentice seaman). Military budgets had previously paid servicemen by their military occupation rather than their rank, leading to 134 different trades with an array of insignia and no clear authority. Trades were now grouped in seven \"grades\" of pay separated by rank. The \"7th grade\" indicated the lowest enlisted grade (i.e., private) and the \"1st grade\" signified the highest (i.e., master sergeant). Three major permanent changes to enlisted men's pay during the interwar period were made, as a result of the National Defense Act of 1920, the Pay Readjustment Act of 1922, and the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, while temporary economy measures were taken during the Great Depression.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ U.S. Army enlisted monthly base pay scales, 1920-1942\n!

The additional pay, in addition to the maximum percentage of ratings allowed when compared to the total number of men in the sixth and seventh grades, was defined in the National Defense Act of 1920. Specialist rating pay was increased as a result of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Specialist class\n! Additional pay per month\n!

To indicate their specialty, a trade badge was sometimes inset between the chevron and the first rocker. These were often identical to the abandoned trade badges used before the reforms of 1920.[http://usarmyinsigniahomepage.110mb.com/wwii_era.html Second World War Era]\nRank insignia, 1920–1942\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

The base pay of enlisted men was increased twenty percent, and the base pay of officers was increased ten percent, when they were stationed on sea duty or on any place outside the continental United States to include Alaska.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ U.S. Army enlisted monthly base pay scales, 1942-1948\n!

The existing specialist ranks were abolished effective 1 June 1942 by War Department Circular No. 204, and all personnel ranked as such were disrated and reappointed as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Old specialist rank\n!

Initially, the technician ranks used the same insignia as staff sergeant, sergeant, and corporal, respectively, but on 4 September 1942, Change 1 to Army Regulation 600-35 added a \"T\" for \"technician\" underneath the standard chevron design that corresponded with that grade. A technician was generally not addressed as such, but rather as the equivalent noncommissioned rank in its pay grade (T/5 as corporal; T/4 as sergeant; T/3 as sergeant or staff sergeant). Initially, technicians held the same authority as noncommissioned officers of their grade, but the Army declared in late 1943 amid a surplus of ranking noncommissioned officers in certain units originating from this policy that only technicians who were appointed prior to 1 December 1943 would continue to keep the authority of their respective grades; men appointed after would still draw the pay of their equivalent noncommissioned officer rank, but would only have the authority of privates.\nThe technician ranks were removed from the rank system in 1948. The concept was brought back with specialist ranks in 1955.\nFirst sergeant\nOn September 22, 1942, in Change 3 to Army Regulation 600–35, the rank of first sergeant was increased from the 2nd grade to the 1st grade in pay. The insignia was changed to add a third rocker to match the other 1st grade rank, master sergeant.[https://web.archive.org/web/20150113122159/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=9168&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services History of Enlisted Ranks]\nAbbreviations\nAs seen in the comparative chart below, the U.S. Army ranks during World War II were not abbreviated the same as they currently are today having all letters capitalized. Rather, only the first letter was capitalized, followed by the rest of the abbreviated word in the lower case, and a period to indicate it as being an abbreviation. In some cases, two or more letters were capitalized with a slash mark after the first letter to indicate that there was more than one word in the full title of the rank. See the comparative chart below.\nComparative chart\nSome ranks are not included in the chart for a proper comparison.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Full title !! Currentabbreviation !!
