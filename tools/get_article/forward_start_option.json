This is because a company commits to granting at-the-money options to employees in the future.\nForward Start Options Series\nA series of consecutive forward start options creates a cliquet option.\nValuation\nIn a Black–Scholes model, the value of the forward-start option is proportional to the asset price.\nTherefore, the value of the forward-start option is a multiple of the current asset price, with that multiple depending on forward volatility.\nReferences"
