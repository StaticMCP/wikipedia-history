He was born in Pawas (a humble village) at about 20 km from Ratnagiri. His keen interest in religious scriptures was evident from childhood and was fostered by his teachers at the Aryan Education Society at Bombay. He graduated from the Tilak Maharashtra University, Pune.\nWhether through his participation in Indian independence movement, his contributions as an educationist, or his relentless pursuit of the metaphysical, Swamiji embodied a higher calling—one that sought to transcend the limitations of the material world and attain the blissful state of Sat-Chit-Ananda (absolute existence, consciousness, and bliss).\nBiography\nIn his childhood, he was very active, inquisitive, and intelligent. He was born and brought up in a well-cultured family. He completed his primary education at pawas and higher secondary education at Ratnagiri. Later, he moved to Mumbai's Aryan education society for further studies. In 1923, he had been initiated into the Nath Sect by his Guru, Baba Maharaj Vaidya.\nDuring college, the thoughts of nationalistic leaders Lokmanya Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi influenced him greatly. He participated in the Indian independence movement, where he was arrested and kept in Yerawada Jail for some time. He used this time for his spiritual development. After his release from jail, his Guru authorised him to lead the Sect, naming him \"Swaroopanand\".\nAfter a few years in 1934, he fell sick and suffered from illness. This near-death experience brought about a complete change in him and his life style. In the next forty years (1934-to-1974), he focussed on making the treasures of Marathi Literature. His literary work helped many common people in their spiritual advancement. Many people visited pawas to meet him in these years.\nPublished works\nSwamiji's literary contributions are as profound as his spiritual presence. His Bhashyas (commentaries) in Abhanga meter on Sant Dnyaneshwar's Dnyaneshwari and Amrutanubhava are treasures of 20th-century Marathi literature. He translated the Marathi book  Dnyaneshwari, which Saint Dnyaneshwar wrote. The language used in original Dnyaneshwari was ancient marathi and complex for people to understand. So, he translated this book into simple Marathi as Abhang  Dnyaneshwari. His own compositions, including:\n* Sanjivani Gatha (a collection of Abhangas),\n* Swaroopa Patra Manjusha (a collection of his letters), and\n* Amrut Dhara, a deeply evocative spiritual work,\n* Bhavartha Gita\n* Abhanga Dnyaneshwari\n* Abhang Amrutanubhava\n* Three Discourses\nSamadhi\n'''Swamiji's final journey to the 'Abode of the Self''''\nAfter some years, he realized that he needed to leave this material body. Therefore, he decided to take Samadhi. Swamiji gave away his existence to the elements (accepted Samadhi) on 15th August 1974. This samadhi place is in Pawas, next to his birthplace. There is a huge, beautiful and extremely clean temple at the same spot.\nSee also\n* nath sampradaya\n* Dnyaneshwar\n* स्वामी स्वरूपानंद सेवा मंडळ (पावस) - the work of swami swaroopanand seva mandal in marathi language\n* रामचंद्र विष्णु गोडबोले - Biography of swami swaroopanand in marathi language\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://swamiswaroopanandpawas.org/en/home.php official website of Swami Swaroopanand sevamandal, pawas]\n* [https://www.ganpatipule.co.in/Eng/OtherVisitingPlaces6 Shri Swami Swaroopanand Shrine Temple - (\"Samadhi Mandir\")]\n* [https://www.indianphilatelics.com/stamps/commemorative-stamps/2002-2003/item/13732-swami-swaroopanandji-click-for-stamp-information.html Swami swaroopanandji's commemorative stamp on indianphilatelics website]\n* [https://hinduismfacts.org/swami-swarupananda/ Swami swarupanandaji's biography on hinduismfacts.org website]\n* [https://swamisamarth.com/meeting-with-shree-swami-swaroopanand-at-pawas/ Meeting of Shree Maharaj and Swami Swaroopanand at Pawas]\n* [https://swamiswaroopananda.tripod.com/ Swami Swaroopananda - one of the premier poet - saint of India a lumineries of the celebrated Nath Sampradaya]\n* [https://www.esamskriti.com/e/Spirituality/Philosophy/Sanatan-Dharam-Shibir-at-Swami-Swaroopanand-Samadhi-Mandir,-Pawas,-Ratnagiri-1.aspx Camp at Swami Swaroopanand Samadhi Mandir, Pawas, Ratnagiri]\n* [https://www.maayboli.com/node/46384 Studying Dnyaneshwari (part 2) article is in marathi]\n* [https://www.maayboli.com/node/51909 Studying Nityapath - a selection of 108 verses from dnyaneshwari (article is in marathi)]"
