He opposed the entry of the transitional government's special investigation committee into the province and claimed that the \"operations room\" led the so-called \"decisive battle\" against the Assad regime and contributed to the \"liberation of the province\".\nComposition\n*  Saraya al-Jabal\n*  Shahid Wahid al-Balous Brigade (since 2025)\n*  Suleiman Abdul Baqi's groups (since 2025)\n*  Two groups of Anti-Terrorism Force (since 2025)\n*  Al-Jabal Brigade (until 2025)\n*  Men of Dignity (until 2025)\n*  Sheikh al-Karama Forces (until 2025)\n*  Tajammu‘ Abna’ al-Jabal (Gathering of the Mountain's Sons, until 2025)\n*  Faz‘at Shabab al-Jabal (Mountain Youth Relief, until 2025)\nSee also\n* Southern Operations Room\n* National Guard (Suwayda)\nReferences"
