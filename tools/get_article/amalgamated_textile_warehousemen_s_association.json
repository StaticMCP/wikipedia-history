These branches were in Blackburn, Burnley, Bury, Colne and Nelson, Great Harwood and Padiham.  Early in the 1900s, these branches established greater co-ordination and the organisation was renamed the General Amalgamation of Clothlookers and Warehousemen'.  New district associations were established in other towns in Lancashire and Cheshire on the initiative of the amalgamation, and by 1910 it had 21 branches with 2,790 members.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

By the 1970s, it was losing members rapidly due to redundancies in the industry.  It changed its name again to the Amalgamated Textile Warehouse Operatives Association, and developed strong links with the Amalgamated Textile Workers Union, the two sharing a general secretary.\nMost of the association's branches amalgamated or left the association in the early 1980s.  The Amalgamated Textile Workers' Union itself merged into the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union (GMBATU) in 1985, and the Warehouse Operatives was dissolved the following year.  Two remaining affiliates, in Bolton and Hyde, then merged into GMBATU, while Colne merged into GMBATU only in 1990, Nelson dissolved in 1991, and Padiham continued in existence.\nGeneral Secretaries\n:1896: W.
