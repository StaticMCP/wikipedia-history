ATL is the current Eclipse M2M solution.\n* Bonita Open Solution: A Business Process Management solution which contains a studio based on EMF and GMF to edit BPMN diagrams.\n* Borland Together: A Java and UML modeling IDE with QVT integration.\n* KM3: A metamodeling language; Metamodels written in KM3 may be automatically converted in a number of other metameta models.\n* Acceleo: A code generator implementing the OMG MOFM2T specification.\n* VIATRA2: A graph-based transformation language.\n* GEMS: A bridge between Generic Modeling Environment (GME) and the Eclipse Modeling Project (EMP).\n* Xtext: A framework for the development of domain-specific languages and other textual programming languages.\n* Sirius: Technology for creating custom graphical modeling workbenches by leveraging the Eclipse Modeling technologies, including EMF and GMF.\nList of tools that may use Eclipse EMF but are available on private source-forges or others development repositories\n* SmartQVT: An open source implementation of the QVT-Operational language. This tool compiles QVT transformations into EMF-based Java programs.\n* Kermeta: A multi-purpose tool made by IRISA and based on EMF for model development, model constraint checking, model exploration, model transformation and much more.\n* Papyrus: A MDE UML modeler based on EMF.\n* Rational Software Modeler: A UML modeler that uses the EMF-based UML2 model.\nReferences"
