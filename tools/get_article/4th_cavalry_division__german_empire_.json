Kavallerie-Division) was a unit of the German Army in World War I. The division was formed on the mobilization of the German Army in August 1914. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.\nCombat chronicle\nIt was initially assigned to II Cavalry Corps, which preceded the 1st and 2nd Armies on the Western Front. In November 1914, it was transferred to Russia. In March 1918, it returned to the Western Front, where it served in Alsace until the end of the war. It was dismounted in October 1916 and restructured to form the 4th Cavalry Schützen Division. By the end of the war, it was serving under 64th Corps (z.b.V.), Armee-Abteilung B, Heeresgruppe Herzog Albrecht von Württemberg on the Western Front.\nA more detailed combat chronicle can be found at the German-language version of this article.\nOrder of Battle on mobilisation\nOn formation, in August 1914, the component units of the division were:\n*3rd Cavalry Brigade (from II Army Corps District)\n**2nd (Pomeranian) Cuirassiers “Queen”\n**9th (2nd Pomeranian) Uhlans\n*17th Cavalry Brigade (from IX Corps District)\n**17th (1st Grand Ducal Mecklenburgian) Dragoons\n**18th (2nd Grand Ducal Mecklenburgian) Dragoons\n*18th Cavalry Brigade (from IX Army Corps District)\n**15th (Hannover) Hussars \"Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands\"\n**16th (Schleswig-Holstein) Hussars \"Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, King of Hungary\"\n*Horse Artillery Abteilung of the 3rd (1st Brandenburg) Field Artillery \"General-Feldzeugmeister\" Regiment\n*2nd Guards Machine Gun Detachment\n*Pioneer Detachment\n*Signals Detachment\n**Heavy Wireless Station 18\n**Heavy Wireless Station 19\n**Light Wireless Station 10\n**Light Wireless Station 12\n*Cavalry Motorised Vehicle Column 4\nSee: Table of Organisation and Equipment\n4th Cavalry Schützen Division\nThe 4th Cavalry Division was extensively reorganised in the course of the war, culminating in its conversion to a Cavalry Schützen Division, that is to say, dismounted cavalry. Here, the cavalry brigades were renamed Cavalry Schützen Commands and performed a similar role to that of an infantry regiment command. Likewise, the cavalry regiments became Cavalry Schützen Regiments and allocated the role of an infantry battalion (and their squadrons acted as infantry companies). However, these units were much weaker than normal infantry formations (for example, a Schützen squadron had a strength of just 4 officers and 109 NCOs and other ranks, considerably less than that of an infantry company).\n*3rd Cavalry Brigade became independent on 30 November 1914\n*17th Cavalry Brigade became independent on 1 February 1917\n*18th Cavalry Brigade transferred to 1st Cavalry Division on 12 December 1916\n*28th Cavalry Brigade joined from 6th Cavalry Division on 1 February 1917.
