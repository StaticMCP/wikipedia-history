Stewart House is a historic house at 41 Montvale Road in Newton, Massachusetts.  The -story stucco-clad house was built in 1909 for Frank H. Stewart, a lawyer.  It is located in an Olmsted-designed subdivision, and is one Newton's finest large Classical Revival houses.  It has a green tile hipped roof with exposed rafter ends, pierced by three hip-roofed dormers.  The main facade has a front porch that merges into two flanking single-story projecting bays, all also topped by a green tile roof.  There are flanking side sections fronted by porches.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Newton, Massachusetts\nReferences"
