      "text": "# Ancient Egyptian magic\n\nAncient Egyptian magic, known as heka (; ; Coptic:  [https://coptic-dictionary.org/entry.cgi?tla=C6471 hik];), was a central component of religious and daily life in ancient Egypt. The term heka refers to both the divine power that gods and pharaohs wielded, as well as the practical use of ritual, spells, and amulets to influence the world. It was believed that heka was a force created by the gods to maintain cosmic order and ensure the prosperity of the kingdom. The term ḥk3 was also used to refer to the god Heka, the deification of magic and medicine. According to Egyptian literature (Coffin text, spell 261), Heka existed \"before duality had yet come into being.\"\nMagic in ancient Egypt was utilized for a variety of purposes, including healing, protection, and summoning divine powers. It was also integral to funerary practices, with the dead often receiving spells to help them navigate the afterlife. For instance, spells from the Book of the Dead were commonly written on papyri, cartonnage, and tomb walls to guide the deceased through the dangers of the underworld.\nPractitioners of heka used specific rituals, prayers, and symbols to invoke divine assistance. These included the use of symbolic items such as amulets, which were believed to carry protective powers, and the recitation of specific spells to affect change in the physical world.\nAncient Egyptian magic is also associated with the practice of divine embodiment, wherein gods could be invoked into physical forms through rituals or iconography, enabling their power to manifest in the world. This magical thinking pervaded the culture, influencing everything from the creation of magical texts to the performance of rituals in temples and at royal courts.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
