The town's economy rested on the rail industry and with the winding down of the railways the population declined. In the , the locality of Bowenville had a population of 219 people.\nGeography\nJust north of the Warrego Highway east of Dalby, Bowenville has the basic requirements for the traveler, including fuel, a post office, barbecues, a hotel and public telephone. It is a short drive from two major tourist attractions in the region, the historic Jondaryan Woolshed and the New Acland Coal Mine.\nThe Western railway line passes through the locality with Bowenville railway station () serving the town. Further west of the town are three other railway stations on the line:\n* Auchmah railway station, now closed ()\n*Koomi railway station ()\n* Kommamurra railway station ()\nHistory\nBowen Provisional School opened on 21 June 1898. It became Bowenville State School on 1 January 1909. In 1921, the school was located south-west of the railway line near Blaxland Road (approx ). In 1951, a site of just over  on the corner of Irvingdale and Grant Streets was reserved as a new site for the Bowenville school. A new school was built in 1953, opening in 1954 (this is the current school).\nIn September 1906, Major William Grant of the Bowenville pastoral station donated land next to the railway line on the corner of Railway Street and Cockburn Street () for a Presbyterian church as well as £20 towards the building costs. John Nicholson of Blaxlands pastoral station donated a further £10. The construction of the church was completed in September 1909. The church was officially opened on Friday 22 October 1909 by Eveline Grant, wife of William Grant. The church was designed by Alexander Brown Wilson of Brisbane and built by D.A. Mever of Toowoomba. It had a cedar pulpit and leadlight windows. The first divine service was held on Sunday 24 October 1909 by Reverend George Tulloch.\nBowenville Post Office opened by June 1908 (a receiving office had been open from 1878).\nIn March 1916, a severe storm blew the roof off the Presbyterian church as well as damaging the Bowenville railway station and many houses. The remains of the church were auctioned off and the church rebuilt at a cost of £200 by carpenter Thomas Hodge of Dalby. Many suppliers and tradesmen donated their goods and services. The Dalby Presbyterian Church provided a new organ. On Sunday 13 August 1916 the re-built church was officially re-opened by the Reverend Richard Glaister, the principal of Emmanuel College at the University of Queensland.\nThe Bowenville Public Hall was built in 1925. It was a popular venue for dancers as its floor was made of Crow's Ash (Flindersia australis) which is very resistant to impact, making it an excellent surface for dancing. The hall was later extended with materials recycled from the public hall at Irvingdale when it closed. The hall hosts a wide variety of local events, including meetings, classes, dances, concerts, and receptions. The local branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association met in this hall.\nSt Luke's Anglican Church was dedicated on 30 March 1952 by Venerable Frank Knight. It had been relocated from Ducklo. It closed on 31 March 1982.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Bowenville had a population of 250 people.\nIn the , the locality of Bowenville had a population of 219 people.\nEducation\nBowenville State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 2 Irvingdale Road ().
