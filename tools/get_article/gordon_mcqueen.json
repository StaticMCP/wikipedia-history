He was a central figure during the 1973–74 campaign, during which the Leeds team were undefeated for the first 29 matches and won the title. McQueen scored three times during the club's European Cup campaign the following season, but was suspended for the final, which Leeds lost. After a controversial move to Leeds' arch-rivals Manchester United, he won the 1983 FA Cup Final. McQueen joined Seiko in Hong Kong for one season in 1985, before retiring and moving into coaching; in that capacity, he managed Airdrieonians and St Mirren for periods in the 1980s.\nMcQueen played thirty times for Scotland, scoring five goals and winning the 1976–77 British Home Championship.\nClub career\nMcQueen was a goalkeeper (the position in which his father Tom had played professionally) as a schoolboy but later switched to centre-back. He was signed at the age of 18 by St Mirren from Ayrshire Junior team Largs Thistle. He soon had scouts from other clubs monitoring his progress and it was Leeds United who finally offered £30,000 (£ today) in the 1972 close season, seeing him as a long-term replacement for the ageing Jack Charlton. Charlton played for some of the 1972–73 season but had decided to retire as the season was drawing to a close. McQueen played on six occasions in his first season at Leeds, including a\nsubstitute appearance in the 1973 European Cup Winners' Cup final, which Leeds lost to A.C. Milan.\nWith Charlton retired and Madeley playing in many positions, McQueen was in the team for most of the 1973–74 season. Leeds won the League Championship, with a run of 29 matches without a defeat from the start of the season with McQueen playing alongside Norman Hunter as Leeds' first-choice centre back pairing. Known for his heading, his  stature and his stubborn attitude, McQueen played a significant role in the team's success. McQueen and Hunter excelled at the back the following season, notably in Leeds' campaign in the European Cup, during which McQueen scored three goals. He was suspended for the 1975 European Cup Final after being sent off in the semi-final versus Barcelona. Leeds went on to lose 2–0 in the final versus Bayern Munich.\nIn February 1978, McQueen moved from Leeds to their arch-rivals Manchester United for £500,000 (£ today). On signing, he said that \"99% of players want to play for Manchester United and the rest are liars.\" He had declared only weeks earlier in Shoot magazine that he wanted to stay at Elland Road for his entire career. He played in the 1979 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, scoring United's first of two goals in the 86th minute, but again finished on the losing side.\nMcQueen finally gained an FA Cup winner's medal in the 1983 FA Cup final, which United won after a replay versus Brighton & Hove Albion. Earlier that season he was also in the team defeated by Liverpool in the League Cup final, in which he was used as a centre-forward because he was injured and United had already made their only permitted substitution. He left Old Trafford in the 1985 close season, having suffered from persistent knee injuries. After one season with Seiko in the Hong Kong First Division, he retired from playing.\nInternational career\nAt the end of the 1973–74 season McQueen was called up to the Scotland squad and made his international debut versus Belgium. He was selected for the 1974 World Cup squad, but did not play. He soon became a regular for Scotland, and he captained the team and also scored his first international goal in a 1–1 draw against Romania on 1 June 1975. He achieved great success with Scotland in 1977, as he scored goals against Northern Ireland at Hampden then England at Wembley as the Scots won the British Home Championship and later that year he helped the team qualify for the 1978 World Cup by beating Wales at Anfield. Although he was selected for the 1978 World Cup squad, he could not play due to injury. McQueen played his last match for Scotland in 1981, having gained thirty caps and scored five goals.\nPost-playing career\nMcQueen coached abroad before managing Airdrieonians from 1987 to 1989, before coaching at his first club St Mirren. When McQueen's friend and former team-mate Bryan Robson was appointed the manager of Middlesbrough, McQueen joined him as reserve-team coach. He held this position for five years, and was then a first-team coach for two years. McQueen left the Teesside club in June 2001, following the departure of Robson and the appointment of Steve McClaren. McQueen then joined Sky Sports as a pundit, working on their Soccer Saturday results show.\nOn 29 April 2008, McQueen returned to Middlesbrough as assistant scout, alongside David Mills.\nPersonal life\nAfter coaching Middlesbrough, McQueen and his wife lived in the village of Hutton Rudby, North Yorkshire. The couple had a son and two daughters, including Hayley, who is a sports journalist. Politically, McQueen was a Labour supporter.\nIn October 2011, McQueen was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and started treatment at the James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough. In January 2021, he was diagnosed with vascular dementia. This highlighted the issue of injuries caused to footballers by persistent heading of a ball. He died from complications of dementia at home on 15 June 2023, at the age of 70.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by national team and year\n|-\n!National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"8\"|Scotland\n|1974||2||0\n|-\n|1975||7||1\n|-\n|1976||2||0\n|-\n|1977||6||2\n|-\n|1978||6||1\n|-\n|1979||6||1\n|-\n|1980||colspan=\"2\"|–\n|-\n|1981||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total!!30!!5\n|}\n:''Scores and results list Scotland's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each goal.''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ List of international goals scored\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|No.\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Venue\n!scope=\"col\"|Opponent\n!scope=\"col\"|Score\n!scope=\"col\"|Result\n!scope=\"col\"|Competition\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|1 || 1 June 1975 || Stadionul 23 August, Bucharest ||  || style=\"text-align:center\"|1–1 || style=\"text-align:center\"|1–1 || UEFA Euro 1976 qualifying\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|2 || 1 June 1977 || Hampden Park, Glasgow ||  || style=\"text-align:center\"|3–0 || style=\"text-align:center\"|3–0 || 1976–77 British Home Championship\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|3 || 4 June 1977 || Wembley Stadium, London ||  || style=\"text-align:center\"|1–0 || style=\"text-align:center\"|2–1 || 1976–77 British Home Championship\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|4 || 20 September 1978 || Praterstadion, Vienna ||  || style=\"text-align:center\"|1–3 || style=\"text-align:center\"|2–3 || UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|5 || 7 June 1979 || Ullevaal Stadion, Oslo ||  || style=\"text-align:center\"|4–0 || style=\"text-align:center\"|4–0 || UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying\n|}\nHonours\nLeeds United\n*First Division: 1973–74\n*European Cup runner-up: 1974–75\n*European Cup Winner's Cup runner-up: 1972–73\nManchester United\n*FA Cup: 1982–83; runner-up: 1978–79\n*League Cup runner-up: 1982–83\n*FA Charity Shield: 1983\nIndividual\n*PFA Team of the Year: 1974–75 First Division, 1977–78 First Division\n*Leeds United Player of the Year: 1974–75, 1976–77\n*Scottish Football Hall of Fame: 2012\nSee also\n*List of Scotland national football team captains\n*List of Scottish football families\nReferences\n}}\n}}"
