She was the Queen of Joseon from 1469 until her death in 1474.\nBiography\nHan Song-yi was born November 17, 1456, into the Cheongju Han clan, as the second daughter and fifth child of Han Myŏnghoe and his wife, Lady Min of the Yeoheung Min clan. Through her mother, Lady Han Song-yi was a second cousin of Queen Jeongsun. Through her father, Lady Han was also a third cousin twice removed of Queen Ansun, the second wife of King Yejong.\nIn 1460, her third older sister, Han Naeng-yi, who was 15 years old, married Yi Hwang, Crown Prince Haeyang and became the Crown Princess of Joseon. Her mother become \"Internal Princess Consort Hwangryeo\" (), and her father was granted the title of \"Internal Prince Sangdang\" (). However, she died in 1461, due to postpartum illness, five days after giving birth to Yi Bun, Grand Prince Inseong. Posthumously, she was honoured as Queen Jangsun.\nOn January 12, 1467, when Han Song-yi was 10 years old, she married Yi Hyeol, Prince Jalsan, the youngest son of Crown Prince Uigyeong. She was granted the title of \"Princess Consort Cheonan\" (), and her parents kept the same royal titles.\nIt was said that Jalsan's grandfather, King Sejo, intended to have Lady Han as a concubine for Jalsan, but Crown Princess Consort Han, the biological mother of the Prince, had sought to make Song-yi her daughter-in-law after seeing her through a window of Heo Gye-ji's house ().\nIn 1470, with her father's influence, Jalsan became King Seongjong, the 9th ruler of the Joseon Dynasty and Lady Han's status changed from Princess Consort to Queen. Her mother-in-law, now honoured as Queen Insu, was strict with her, but she taught the young Queen thoroughly in accordance with Confucian ethics such as having her read The Story of Yeolnyeo ().\nWhen the Queen couldn't get pregnant, King Seongjong had started to take concubines. Without despising the women, Song-yi prepared and presented the clothes to them. She also gave jewelry and pieces of clothing as gifts to the concubines.\nIn 1473, she moved to her hometown, where the home of her parents were at, because of an illness and Seongjong made sure to visit her in order to check on her condition. The Queen recovered and moved back into the palace, but within the last months of the same year, her illness reappeared. Because her health didn't improve, Song-yi requested to move her residence to Changdeokgung, and the three Queen Dowagers (Jaseong, Insu and Inhye), as well the King, tended to her. Her parents were also granted permission to enter the palace and take care of their youngest daughter, but the Queen's sickness didn't seem to go away.\nLady Han's parents did not eat as she was in bad health, but she urged them to eat as they have been starving for days while staying by her side.\nShe died a couple of days later in Changdeok Palace's Guhyeonjeon Hall, at the age of 17 on May 9, 1474.\nFor her posthumous title, Seongjong used \"Gong\" (공,恭) to praise her for docilely serving her in-laws, and \"Hye\" () for her generosity, tenderness, and kindness. Her title became Queen Gonghye ().\nHer Neungho was called Sunhon (), and later became Sunneung. The Jeonho was set as Sogyeongjeon.\nIn the 4th year of Yeonsangun's reign (1498), she was honoured with Hwiuishinsuk () to her posthumous title.\nThe Queen's memorial tablet is enshrined in Jongmyo's main hall and her tomb is located in Samneung, Bongilcheon-ri, Jori-eup, Paju, Gyeonggi Province.\nFamily\nParents\n* Father − Han Myŏnghoe (26 November 1415 – 28 November 1487)\n* Mother − Internal Princess Consort Hwangryeo of the Yeoheung Min clan (; 1414–1479)\nSibling(s)\n* Older brother: Han Bo, Prince Namseong (; 1437–1522).
