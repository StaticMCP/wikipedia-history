Grant\n| after_party = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\nThe 1868 United States presidential election in Oregon took place on November 3, 1868, as part of the 1868 United States presidential election. Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nOregon voted for the Democratic nominee, Horatio Seymour over the Republican nominee, Ulysses S. Grant. Seymour won the state by a narrow margin of 0.74%.\nAs a result of his win, Seymour became the first Democratic presidential candidate to ever win Oregon. Another Democrat would not win Oregon again on a presidential level until Woodrow Wilson won the state in 1912. Democrats wouldn't again win a majority in Oregon until Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state in 1932.\nThis was the only time a Republican would win a presidential election without Oregon until 1988, 120 years later; every Republican since then has lost the state.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Oregon\nReferences"
