It was first introduced during the 1970–71 season, with the inaugural winners being Fullerians.  It is the most important rugby union cup competition in Hertfordshire, ahead of the Hertfordshire presidents' Tankard and Hertfordshire presidents' Trophy.\nThe presidents' Cup is currently open to the first teams of club sides based in Hertfordshire that play in tier 6 (London 1 North) of the English rugby union league system, as well as the 2nd teams of higher ranked clubs in the region (tiers 3–5).  The format is a knockout cup with a first round, semi-finals and a final to be held at Allianz Park (Saracen's home ground) in April–May on the same date and same venue as the Tankard and Trophy finals.\nHertfordshire presidents' Cup winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"|\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"|\n| style=\"border:0;\"|'''Hertfordshire presidents' Cup Finals'''\n|  style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"|\n|}\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Season\n!  style=\"background:#efefef\"|Winner\n!  style=\"background:#efefef\"|Score\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Runners–up\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Venue\n|- align=left\n|-\n| 1970–71 || Fullerians ||\n|-\n| 1971–72 || Bishop's Stortford ||\n|-\n| 1972–73 || Old Verulamian ||\n|-\n| 1973–74 || Fullerians ||\n|-\n| 1974–75 || Hemel Hempstead ||\n|-\n| 1975–76 || Fullerians ||\n|-\n| 1976–77 || Letchworth Garden City ||\n|-\n| 1977–78 || Letchworth Garden City ||\n|-\n| 1978–79 || Bishop's Stortford ||\n|-\n| 1979–80 || Fullerians ||\n|-\n| 1980–81 || Hertford ||\n|-\n| 1981–82 || Hertford ||\n|-\n| 1982–83 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 1983–84 || Fullerians ||\n|-\n| 1984–85 || Cheshunt ||\n|-\n| 1985–86 || Hertford || 12–6 || Letchworth Garden City ||\n|-\n| 1986–87 || Letchworth Garden City || 18–3 || Hertford ||\n|-\n| 1987–88 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 1988–89 || Cheshunt ||\n|-\n| 1989–90 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 1990–91 || Cheshunt ||\n|-\n| 1991–92 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 1992–93 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 1993–94 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 1994–95 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 1995–96 || Bishop's Stortford ||\n|-\n| 1996–97 || Cheshunt ||\n|-\n| 1997–98 || Old Albanian || 15-13 || Old Verulamian ||\n|-\n| 1998–99 || Cheshunt ||\n|-\n| 1999-00 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 2000–01 || Tabard ||\n|-\n| 2001–02 || Tabard || 20–0 || Letchworth Garden City ||\n|-\n| 2002–03 || Tabard || 27–3 || Fullerians ||\n|-\n| 2003–04 || Hertford || 14–9 || St Albans || War Memorial Sports Ground, Northwood, London\n|-\n| 2004–05 || Hertford || 45–12 || Letchworth Garden City ||\n|-\n| 2005–06 || Hertford || 41–12 || Stevenage Town ||\n|-\n| 2006–07 || Hertford || 10–3 || Stevenage Town || War Memorial Sports Ground, Northwood, London\n|-\n| 2007–08 || Hertford || 26–5 || Stevenage Town || War Memorial Sports Ground, Northwood, London\n|-\n| 2008–09 || Bishop's Stortford || 22–16 (aet) || Old Albanian || War Memorial Sports Ground, Northwood, London\n|-\n| 2009–10 || Old Albanian || 37–19  || Bishop's Stortford || Croxley Guild of Sport, Croxley Green, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2010–11 || Hertford || 40–15 || Tring || Redbourn Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2011–12 || Tring || 40–0 || Hertford II || Redbourn Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2012–13 || Bishop's Stortford Blues || 34–8 || Letchworth Garden City || Chaulden Lane, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2013–14 || Letchworth Garden City || 22–15 || Bishop's Stortford Blues || Boggymead Springs, St Albans, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2014–15 || Letchworth Garden City || 33–16 || Old Albanian Romans || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2015–16 || Bishop's Stortford Blues || 38–18 (aet) || Hertford II || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2016–17 || Bishop's Stortford Blues || 44–14 || Tring II || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2017–18 || Bishop's Stortford Blues || 8–3 || Fullerians || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2018–19 ||Fullerians\n|64-20\n|Old Albanian Romans\n|Redbourn Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire\n|-\n|2019-20\n| colspan=\"4\" |Competition was not held due to COVID-19\n|-\n|2020-21\n| colspan=\"4\" |Competition was not held due to COVID-19\n|-\n|2021-22\n|Letchworth Garden City\n|47-30\n|Fullerians\n|Redbourn Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire\n|-\n|2022-23\n|Hemel Hempstead\n|24-10\n|Hitchin\n|Andrews Lane, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire\n|}\nNumber of wins\n*Tabard (11)\n*Hertford (9)\n*Bishop's Stortford (8)\n*Fullerians (6)\n*Letchworth Garden CIty (6)\n*Cheshunt (5)\n*Old Albanian (2)\n*Hemel Hempstead (2)\n*Tring (1)\n*Old Verulamian (1)\nNotes\nSee also\n* Hertfordshire RFU\n* Hertfordshire presidents' Tankard\n* Hertfordshire presidents' Trophy\n* English rugby union system\n* Rugby union in England\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hertsrugby.co.uk Hertfordshire RFU]"
