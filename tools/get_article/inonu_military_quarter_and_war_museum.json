İnönü ilçe is   west of Eskişehir.\nBackground\nDuring the Turkish War of Independence, the commander of Western Front was İsmet Pasha. He fought in the First Battle of İnönü (9-11 January 1921) and in the Second Battle of İnönü (26–31 March 1921) against the invading Greek Army around the town of İnönü. In both engagements, he was successful. Thus, after the enactment of the Surname Law in 1934, İsmet Pasha chose the surname İnönü.\nThe building\nThe museum building served as the military headquarters of İsmet Pasha during the battles. In 1987, the Ministry of Culture bought the building and converted it into a war museum. It was opened in 2001, on the 80th anniversary of the victories.\nThe exhibits\nIn the museum, there are photographs of the battles, the copies of the correspondence between the commanders, the weapons and other military tools, the uniforms and some ethnographic items. The most important piece of correspondence is the telegram of Mustafa Kemal Pasha (later Atatürk) after the Second Battle of İnönü . The first paragraph of the telegram is \"It is not so often the world history sees a commander as you, who have taken a huge responsibility in the İnönü battlefields. The independence and existence of our nation depended on the courageousness and patriotism of your commanders and fellow soldiers, who have been doing their honorable duties under your genius conduct. You did not only beat the ill fortune of the enemy but also that of the nation\".\nReferences"
