This complex, built by the Hopewell culture between 100 BCE and 400 CE, contains the largest earthen enclosures in the world, and was about  in total extent. Less than 10 percent of the total site has been preserved since European-American settlement; this area contains a total of . Newark's Octagon and Great Circle Earthworks are managed by the Ohio History Connection.  A designated National Historic Landmark, in 2006 the Newark Earthworks was also designated as the \"official prehistoric monument of the State of Ohio.\"\nThis is part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, one of 14 sites nominated in January 2008 by the U.S. Department of the Interior for potential submission by the United States to the UNESCO World Heritage List. It was officially designated a World Heritage Site in September 2023 together with the earthworks at Hopewell Culture National Historical Park and Fort Ancient.\nHistory\nBuilt by the Hopewell culture between 100 BCE and 400 CE, the earthworks were used by the indigenous Native Americans as places of ceremony, social gathering, trade, worship, and honoring the dead. The primary purpose of the Octagon earthwork was believed to have been scientific. Scholars have demonstrated that the Octagon Earthworks comprise a lunar observatory for tracking the Moon's orbit during its 18.6-year cycle.\nWhile limited, the Newark Earthwork site is the largest surviving Hopewell earthwork complex in North America. The culture built many earthen mounds.  Over decades, they built what is the single largest earthwork enclosure complex in the Ohio River Valley.\nThe complex was one of hundreds of Native American ancient monuments identified and surveyed for the Smithsonian Institution in the mid-nineteenth century by Ephraim G. Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis, from 1837 to 1847.  The work that was published by a nascent Smithsonian Institution was titled Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley.   This study of the prehistoric Mound Builders of North America was a landmark in American scientific research and the early development of archaeology as a scientific discipline. The book was the first volume of the Smithsonian Institution's Contributions to Knowledge series and the Institution's first publication.  Squier and Davis' detailed and measured plan of the site is shown on this page.\nGreat Circle Earthworks\nThe -wide Newark Earthworks Great Circle (located in Heath, OH) is one of the largest circular earthworks in the Americas, at least in construction effort. A  deep moat is encompassed by walls that are  high; at the entrance, the dimensions are even more grand.\nResearchers have used archaeogeodesy and archaeoastronomy to analyze the placements, alignments, dimensions, and site-to-site interrelationships of the earthworks.  This research has revealed that the prehistoric cultures in the area had advanced scientific understanding which they used as the basis of their complex construction.\nOctagon Earthworks\nThe Octagon Earthworks consists of an Observatory Mound (connected at the southwestern edge of Observatory Circle), Observatory Circle , and the connected Octagon . The Octagon has eight -long walls, from  to  high. The Octagon is joined by parallel walls to Observatory Circle .\nIn 1982 researchers from Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana concluded that the complex was a lunar observatory, designed to track motions of the moon, including the northernmost point of the 18.6-year cycle of the lunar orbit. When viewed from the observatory mound, the moon rises at that time within one-half of a degree of the octagon's exact center. The earthwork is twice as precise as the complex at Stonehenge (assuming Stonehenge is an observatory, which is a disputed theory).\nFrom 1892 to 1908, the state of Ohio used the Octagon Earthworks as a militia encampment. Immediately after this, the Newark Board of Trade owned the property, until 1918. In 1910, the property was leased to Moundbuilders Country Club (MBCC), which developed the site as a golf course. As a result of a Licking County Common Pleas Court case, a trustee was named to manage the property from 1918 to 1933.\nIn 1997 the Ohio Historical Society (now the Ohio History Connection) signed a lease until 2078 with the country club. MBCC maintains, secures, and provides restricted public access to the land. Some citizens believe the country club is an inappropriate use of the sacred site. There has been increasing public interest in the earthworks. Activists have pressed for more public access to the site to witness the moonrise, which observance was planned in the design and construction by the original native builders.\nIn 2022 the Ohio Supreme Court had ruled that the historical society could use eminent domain to buy out the lease from the Moundbuilders Country Club. On August 2024 a deal was reached and the Country Club left from the site on 1 January 2025.\nWright Earthworks\nThe Wright Earthworks consist of a fragment of a geometrically near-perfect square enclosure and part of one wall that originally formed a set of parallel embankments, which led from the enclosure to a large oval yard. The Newark square's sides formerly ranged from about  to  in length, enclosing a total area of about .\nMuch of the square enclosure and its associated mounds was destroyed during nineteenth-century European-American development: construction related to building the Ohio Canal, as well as the streets and houses of the city of Newark. Clearing and cultivation of fields for farming also destroyed much of the monument. The remaining segment of one wall of the square is less than  long.\nThe Wright Earthworks are named in honor of Mrs. Frances Rees Wright, who donated the site in 1934 to the Ohio Historical Society.\nGallery\nColor photos are of the Great Circle, located in Heath. The black-and-white photos of the Octagon Earthworks in Newark were taken from the air in the 1980s, showing the interposition of country club golf sand traps and greens with the surviving parts of the ancient circles, walls, Observatory Circle and Octagon.\nFile:Ohio Newark Great Circle01 02.jpg|Panoramic view from within the Great Circle, the wall of which can be seen in the background.\nFile:Newark Great Circle Central Mound.jpg|Man on top of the central mound at the Great Circle in 2024\nFile:TouristsAtGreatCircleEarthworks.jpg|Tourists at Great Circle Earthworks, Heath\nFile:Newark Mounds, Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks, Newark - small ancient walled circle\nFile:Newark Mounds,10 Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks - walls of ancient causeway\nFile:Newark Mounds,11 Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks - small ancient circle and other walls\nFile:Newark Mounds,13 Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks\nFile:Newark Mounds,14 Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks - Observatory Circle in lower right; part of straight walls of Octagon in left center\nFile:Newark Mounds,15 Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks\nFile:Newark Mounds,17 Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks\nFile:Newark Mounds,20 Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks - Observatory Circle in upper right, and part of Octagon visible below that after short causeway\nFile:Newark Mounds,21 Newark, Ohio, USA.jpg|Octagon Earthworks - walls of Observatory Circle\nSee also\n* Earthwork (archaeology)\n* Fort Ancient\n* Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks\n* Hopewell Culture National Historical Park\n* List of Hopewell sites\n* Mound builder (people)\n* List of National Historic Landmarks in Ohio\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.ancientohiotrail.org/sites/newark Newark Earthworks, The Ancient Ohio Trail]\n* [https://www.ohiohistory.org/visit/browse-historical-sites/newark-earthworks/ Official website] from the Ohio Historical Society\n* [https://earthworks.osu.edu/ The Newark Earthworks Center], The Ohio State University\n* [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1689 Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks UNESCO World Heritage Site]\n* [http://jqjacobs.net/archaeo/newark.html The Great Circle Earthwork, Newark, Ohio]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160406052054/http://www.copperas.com/octagon/ The Octagon Earthworks: A Neolithic Lunar Observatory]"
