The Charter demands public control of the banks, along with energy, water and transport, ensuring that there is an investment in these services instead of money being creamed off to corporate shareholders. It also calls for a fairer tax system, with the wealthy and big business paying their way, investment not cuts in public services, the creation of millions of new homes, and sustainable jobs with decent wages.\nPoints covered by the Charter\nUsing the six demands of the People's Charter of 1838'' as a template, the demands of the People's Charter are:\n# A fair economy for a fairer Britain\n# More and better jobs\n# Decent homes for all\n# Save and improve our services\n# Fairness and Justice\n# A better future starts now\nEndorsements\nThe People's Charter has been endorsed by the following Trade Unions: the RMT, the CWU, the FBU, the PCS, the NUT, the NUJ, the BFAWU POA (Scotland), the UCU, and the TUC.\nThe People's Charter attracted support from various high-profile politicians including Jeremy Corbyn, Tony Benn and John McDonnell, and a number of personalities from the arts world including Billy Bragg, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Mark Thomas and Ken Loach.\nIt has also been endorsed by the Communist Party of Britain, Labour Representation Committee, the Scottish Campaign for Socialism, and the Socialist Party.\nCriticisms\nThe People's Charter has been criticised by some parties on the left, particularly Workers' Liberty, for being too limited in its scope, and for being social democratic rather than revolutionary.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140203093529/http://thepeoplescharter.org/ Archive of the official website]"
