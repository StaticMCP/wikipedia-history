It is served by the Orange and Green lines.\nHistory\nThe BART Board approved the name \"South Hayward\" in December 1965. The station opened as part of the first segment of the BART system on September 11, 1972. Due to a national strike that year by elevator constructors, elevator construction on the early stations was delayed. Elevators at most of the initial stations, including South Hayward, were completed in the months following the opening.\nConstruction of transit oriented development near the station began in 2015. Two buildings with a total of 357 residential units opened in 2017. , BART anticipates soliciting a developer between 2029 and 2033 for a second phase of TOD.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bart.gov/stations/shay/BART BART - South Hayward]"
