A song called \"Get Yourself a Phonograph\" had been recorded for the film but was eventually omitted. Crosby had previously recorded \"I Kiss Your Hand, Madame\" on May 24, 1929 with a trio giving support but this time he has the benefit of a full orchestral backing.  The song \"The Kiss in Your Eyes\" was adapted from a slow waltz called \"Im Chambre séparée\" (\"Separate Rooms\") written by Richard Heuberger. \"Friendly Mountains\" was arranged by Joseph J. Lilley based on original Swiss airs and the music for \"Emperor Waltz\" was written by Johann Strauss the younger in 1888. Johnny Burke wrote the lyrics for the last three mentioned tunes.\nReception\nThe album reached the No. 2 spot in the Billboard best-selling popular record albums chart on August 7, 1948. It was 9th in the year's top-selling popular record albums listing.\nTrack listing\nThese songs were featured on a 2-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. A-620.\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|+The Emperor Waltz (album) track listing\n|-bgcolor=#D3D3D4\n| Side / Title || Writer(s) || Recording date || Performed with || Time\n|- bgcolor=#F2F0E6\n| colspan=5|Disc 1 (24204):\n|-\n| A. \"Friendly Mountains\" || Johnny Burke || March 17, 1947 || Victor Young and His Orchestra || 3:04\n|-\n| B. \"The Kiss in Your Eyes\" || Richard Heuberger, Johnny Burke || January 17, 1947|| Victor Young and His Orchestra || 3:01\n|- bgcolor=#F2F0E6\n| colspan=5|Disc 2 (24170):\n|-\n| A. \"I Kiss Your Hand, Madame\" || Sam M.
