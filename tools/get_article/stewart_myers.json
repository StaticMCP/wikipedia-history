Merton Professor of Financial Economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management.\nHe is notable for his work on capital structure and innovations in capital budgeting and valuation, and has had a \"remarkable influence\" on both the theory and practice of corporate finance. Myers, in fact, coined the term \"real option\". He is the co-author with Richard A. Brealey and Franklin Allen of Principles of Corporate Finance, a widely used and cited business school textbook, now in its 11th edition. He is also the author of dozens of research articles.\nCareer\nHe holds an A.B. from Williams College and a Ph.D. and MBA from Stanford University. He began teaching at MIT Sloan School of Management in 1966.\nHis contributions are seen as falling into three main categories:\n*Work on capital structure, focusing on \"debt overhang\" and \"pecking order theory\".\n*Contributions to capital budgeting that complement his research on capital structure. He is notable for the adjusted present value (or APV) approach as well as for recognizing the \"option-like\" character of many corporate assets.\n*Work on estimating fair rates of return for public utilities.\nRecent projects include the valuation of investments in R&D, risk management, and the allocation of capital in diversified firms, and the theory of corporate governance.\nAs of 2010, he was a principal of economic consulting firm The Brattle Group. He is a past president of the American Finance Association, a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a director of the Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance.\nWorks\n*Stewart C.
