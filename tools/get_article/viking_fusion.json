Content on the site is exclusively authored and produced by Berry College students. The views expressed on Viking Fusion are not necessarily those of Berry College's board of trustees, the administration, or the department of communication.\nViking Fusion is powered by concrete5, an open-source content management system.\nAwards\n* 2009 National Student Production Awards [http://www.askcbi.org/?p=711 Winner]\n* 2010 College Broadcasters, Inc.
