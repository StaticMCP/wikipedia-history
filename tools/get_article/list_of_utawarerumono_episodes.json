Yuzuha tells Eruru that she reminds her of Tusukuru in every way. Meanwhile, Oboro told Hakuowlo that it was actually Yuzuha's idea to come to their aid. Oboro does not seem to like that idea but he still agrees because he believes that this is the first time he saw Yuzuha requests and that she may be right. After hearing Oboro's story, Hakuowlo told Oboro of his plans that they are currently seeking help from the nearby villages to aid them on battle. Even if they know that most people wouldn't want to get involve with them, they would still try since there might be few people who will help and that every people counts.

Benawi also asked for Hakuowlo's name and retreated. After the battle, Hakuowlo once again blames himself for putting their village in a predicament and for taking advantage of the villagers. Oboro told Hakuowlo that he shouldn't think that way because he will just betray the trust that the villagers have given to him. Back on his feet, Hakuowlo assumed that Benawi isn't the one who put the nearby village into ruin. Since he assumed that Benawi isn't a person who will use underhanded tactics.

The first one is to defend their country against Shikeripechim while the second one heads directly to the camp where Niwa is located and kill him. But before they could initiate their plan, another group of soldiers from Shikeripechim attacks a village.

With just a few minutes, Karulau was able to kill all three of them, focusing on killing one of them at a time. Inside the palace, they are greeted by Niwe. Niwe ordered undead soldiers that he captured from different countries to attack them. These undead soldiers keep on getting up as they keeps on slashing them. After cathching up with Hakuowlo and the others, Karulau dismembered an undead and told them to do what she does. After finding an opening, Hakuowlo went after Niwe until they reached the throne room. There, they had a conversation. Niwe issued an order to burn his own country and put the blame on Hakuowlo, telling him that everything happened because they are meant to be sacrifice for Hakuowlo in order to awaken the beast inside him. Hakuowlo couldn't accept Niwe's illogical thinking and started to fight him. As they continue on their battle, the beast inside Hakuowlo awakens and devoured Niwe. After gaining control of his body, Hakuowlo saw the aftermath of his battle against NIwe and seems to not like the outcome. He met up with Eruru and the others telling them that they have won the war.

Hakuowlo told them to abandon their land and relocate their country because their land might remind them of the bad things NIwe has done to their country. At night, Hakuowlo is being haunted by what Niwe said to him and has nightmares about it. He walks around the palace and met with Touka who joins him in his walks. At the storeroom, they saw Aruru, and Mukkuru getting food while Karulau grabs bottles of sake. The next day, a duel between Benawi and Oboro takes places to see how strong each is. Oboro may have improved his skills but Benawi still won the battle. At night, Hakuowlo is still haunted by Niwe in his dreams and went around the palace again. This time, he stumbled at Camyu drinking a lot of water and seems not to look well. When Hakuowlo asked for her condition, Ulthury came to help Camyu return to her room and told Hakuowlo that Camyu will be fine. The next day, the people of Shikeripechim had an audience with Hakuowlo and told him that they don't want to relocate their country because they still wanted to live in the place where they born. After considering their pleas, Hakuowlo and the others went to see the current state of Shikeripechim. In Shikeripechim, the mark of war still lingers around the place. There are burnt houses everywhere and no trees and grass to be seen. Eruru dragged Hakuowlo somewhere in Shikeripechim where she has planted plant seeds a month ago. They saw that the seeds are growing. Eruru showed Hakuowlo the seeds to tell him that as long as they have the will to start anew, they will be able to leave their past behind and move on towards tomorrow. Hakuowlo understood what Eruru meant and decided to let the people of Shikeripechim to rebuild their nation in their homeland. During the night, Hakuowlo went to see Camyu as she flies and dances around orbs of light above the lake. Upon seeing Camyu, Hakuowlo is amazed to see that something believed to be out of this world exists. Then, in the shadows, a bulky old man with an eye patch from the clan of Evankulga appeared to him and introduces himself as Genjimaru. Genjimaru told Hakuowlo that his master wishes to see him.

Kuuya asked Hkuoro how he who once a nobody is able to rise in his current state. Hakuowlo simply told Kuuya that he is only doing the best he can for others. Hakuowlo asked why Kuuya asked him such question. Kuuya replied to Hakuowlo that Hakuowlo might be a Kunneietai, people who are under same divine protection of the Great God Onvitaikayan as the Shakukopolu clan. Kuuya asked Hakuowlo if he believes in Onvitaikayan as his god, the same god that Kuuya believes. Hakuowlo never heard of the name and told Kuuya if Onvitaikayan is Witsalnemitea in a different name. Kuuya felt offended by hearing Witsalnemitea and told Hakuowlo not to mention that name to him again. Kuuya explained to Hakuowlo that Witsalnemitea is a god of misfortune who overthrows Onvitaikayan, who is the original creator, in his throne and since then to be believed to be a “savior” in some clan. Kuuya wonders where Hakuowlo got the name. Hakuowlo told him that a clan held a mass In his country who believes that Witsalnemitea as their god. After a while, Kuuya and Hakuowlo's conversation ended. Kuuya told him that he will come to meet him again.

Oboro asked them to give him the mikyuum but Aruru and Yuzuha refused him upon learning that he will use its liver to cure Yuzuha since Yuzuha never wanted his brother to take someone's life to cure her illness. Then Aruru began to name it. Upon catching up, Hakuowlo and the trader heard the news from Oboro. The trader told them that the mikyuum will consider those who named it as its master. It left them no choice but to buy it. At night, Hakuowlo has yet another private discussion with Kuuya where he discovers that the masked emperor Kuuya is in fact a young girl. The reason why Kuuya always wears a mask is because people will think less of her, seeing that a little girl is an emperor of a country. After that, Kuuya proceeds to tell Hakuowlo another tale. She told him that the reason they have war is because Onvitaikayan is no longer in his throne and that her country is currently suffering because there are clans who are jealous of the divine protection that Onvitaikayan bestowed to her and her people who are from the Shakukopolu clan.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = While Hakuowlo and the others are having their meal in the palace, a messenger came to deliver news to them.

When the night came, Karulau, wearing a formal wear, begged Hakuowlo to send reinforcements to help the rebel army. According to Karulau, if Hakuowlo agrees, she will give herself to him. Hakuowlo can't decide what to do because he can't risk his country to engage war with another country again but he did say that he will find a way. Karulau assumed that Hakuowlo agreed and started to give herself to him in advance. Eruru went to see Hakuowlo, and misunderstood what Hakuowlo and Karulau are doing so she walked away. The next day, Eruru ignored Hakuowlo all day. Later, a messenger came and told them the condition of the rebel army. Upon hearing the news, Hakuowlo told Karulau that it is impossible to send reinforcements, breaking his deal with Karulau. At night, Karulau went to Hakuowlo's room and forces Hakuowlo to go on a journey with her as she carries Hakuowlo in his futon. As Hakuowlo and Karulau went out of the palace, Eruru, Aruru, Mukkuru, Yuzuha, Ulthury, Camyu, and Touka also joined them on their journey. The next day, Oboro, Benawi, Kurou, and Munto came looking for Hakuowlo and the others who went on a journey without telling them. Meanwhile, while they are travelling, Hakuowlo explained to Eruru that nothing happened between him and Karulau the other day and that their deal never happened.

The enemy soldier killed the man and started attacking the rebels. After eliminating the soldiers, Derihourai bad mouthed the dead rebel who betrayed them. Karulau beat Derihourai and told Derihourai that he should try to understand the point of view of the weak and shouldn't look down on them. Karulau told him the reason that the strong Giriyagiya clan, the clan of Karulau and Derihourai, almost got wiped out is because of their arrogance in their strength. In the end, the rebel army accepted help from Hakuowlo and the others.

Before they initiate the plan, Derihourai asked Hakuowlo to give Karulau to the rebel army. Hakuowlo asked him why he has taken interest to Karulau. Derihourai, without knowing that Karulau is his sister, told Hakuowlo that Karulau reminded him of his sister, although a polar opposite of her when it comes to attitude. After that, Hakuowlo had a conversation with Karulau. He told her if it is ok for her not to return to her people and abandoned her past. Karure replied to him and said that it is fine with her and that with or without past doesn't change who she is. Executing their plan, Hakuowlo and the others successfully infiltrate the palace. In the throne room, they saw human slaves used as fertilizers to produce the most beautiful flowers. Then, Suonkasu with some soldiers appeared.

Karulau promised him that she will return after he announced their victory to their allies outside the palace. After Derihourai went out, Karulau planned to break her promise to her brother from the start and told Hakuowlo and the others that they should immediately return to Tusukuru.

Then, Kuuya told Hakuowlo that she wanted to start a war with the countries that opposed them. Hakuowlo told her if she and her country of Kunnekamun will be okay. Kuuya told him that he shouldn't underestimate her country because they have been given great power as a blessing from their god, Onvitaikayan. The next day, Camyu sucked Aruru’s blood and went missing. Everyone went to look for her, even Aruru. Hakuowlo found her but she didn't want to come back because she thinks that Aruru don't want to become friends with her anymore. She told Hakuowlo that in their clan, she is the only one who has black wings and people told her that it is because she has a blood that has a close relation to their ancestors. Furthermore, she is treated differently in their clan and has no friends until she met Aruru and Yuzuha. Hakuowlo told her that Aruru wouldn't severe their friendship by just sucking her blood and he also told her how worried they are looking for her. When Aruru came, she told Camyu that she forgives her and still wanted to be friends with her. Camyu returned to the palace as tears of joy dropped on her cheeks knowing that everyone in the palace treat her as a friend. After a few days, they heard a report from their soldier that Kuuya has waged war with Nosechesuka, one of the great three countries alongside Onkamiyamukai and Kunnekamun, and defeated them in just 3 days and still plans to defeat other countries that opposes her.

Kuuya hesitates on doing it and instead listen to Genjimaru's suggestion of solidifying their country first. While solidifying their country, their people who are living at the borderline of their country were attacked. The people begged Kuuya to wage war to all countries and unify the nation. Having trouble on making her decisions, Kuuya went to meet Hakuowlo and had a conversation with him. Hakuowlo knew the problems that Kuuya is facing right now and told her that she shouldn't just rely on herself when making decisions because she is not alone. At Kunnekamun, more and more people wanted Kuuya to unify the nation. Hauenkua and Hien use this opportunity to once again convince Kuuya to wage war and unify the nation. Kuuya asked for Genjimaru for his opinion but Genjimaru is not present. Knowing that she must make haste in making her decision, even without Genjimaru's opinion, Kuuya has decided to follow the suggestion of her people. She started waging war to many countries. After winning every war, Kuuya decided to take over Onkamiyamukai. Genjimaru tried to stop Kuuya because waging war with Onkamiyamukai will guarantee that every country will be their enemy. Kuuya told him that they have gone too far to stop. On their way to Onkamiyamukai while inside their Avu-Kamuu, Kuuya and her army were trapped and were being crush on the great seal cast by the elders of Onkamiyamukai. However, with the help of Dii, the army of Kunnekamun was able to break through the great seal and successfully took over Onkamiyamukai. At Tusukuru Palace, Hakuowlo and the others heard the news that Onkamiyamukai has been taken by Kunnekamun. Furthermore, an army of Kunnekamun are already on their way to Tusukuru.

While thinking of a plan, Hakuowlo knows how powerful the Avu-Kamuu of the Kunnekamun as this is the great power that the Kunnekamun's god, Onvitaikayan bestowed upon them. He then made a decision and told everyone to evacuate the capital while he and some others hold off the Kunnekamun. Oboro and the others told him to evacuate and let them handle the Kunnekamun since the Kunnekamun's objective is Hakuowlo. Hakuowlo agreed and he told everyone to meet later and make sure that they don't die.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = As the forces of Emperor Kuuya led by Hauenkua and Hien descended upon Tusukuru's capital, Oboro and the others tries to hold them off as Hakuowlo and the people of Tusukuru are evacuating. But Oboro and the others weren't able to stop the Kunnekamun from advancing towards the capital which resulted to numerous casualties and Kurou got injured as well. Then Hakuowlo went back for them, as he realize that the evacuation is going to take longer than they have, and decided to sacrifice himself to draw the Kunnekamun forces’ attention away, ordering Benawi and the others to go and evacuate as well. Hakuowlo went and successfully all of the Kunnekamun force except for Hien because Hien was blocked by Karulau and Touka as they disobeyed Hakuowlo. As Hakuowlo continues to lure the enemies, Hauenkua eventually caught up with him and got him. However, Aruru isn't prepared to let this happen, and shows up riding Mukkuru. The immortal Mutikapa is able to attack Hauenkua's Avu-Kamuu without being hurt, but Aruru got hit with a single blow and died. However, the pool of blood growing behind Aruru begins to bring back Hakuowlo's memories, as he despairs Aruru’s death. In his memories, he saw that he is once a scholar who stumbled upon a monster in a futuristic lab. Then an old scientist saw him and told him that the monster is the key on humanity's evolution who are once a monkey. After that, the scientist shoots him because he found out about the monster which is kept secret. Hakuowlo's blood got spilled on the monster, reviving it. Back in the present, Eruru went to look for Aruru and saw Hakuowlo holding the dead Aruru in his arms. While enjoying Hakuowlo's despair, Hauenkua stepped on Hakuowlo and Aruru. Suddenly, a black aura came from Hakuowlo and he transformed into the monster from his memories. He went on a rampage, destroying all of the Kunnekamun's Avu-Kamuu. Hauenkua barely escapes death as he went out of his Avu-Kamuu, begging for his life and calling her mommy. Eruru looked at the monster's face and remembered that she once met the monster in the forest when she and Aruru are picking herbs. During that time, Aruru also died. Eruru told the monster that she will give herself to him in exchange for reviving Aruru. The monster granted her wish and told her that she will be forever bound to him. Back at the present, the monster revived Aruru again. Aruru opened her eyes and calls the monster, father, meaning its Hakuowlo. Hakuowlo reverted to being human and loses consciousness. Back at the palace, Hakuowlo woke up. He asked Eruru what happened after he loses consciousness. Eruru told him that the enemy retreated and that Aruru is alive and in a good condition. Unable to hold her thoughts about what happened at the battlefield, Eruru went out of Hakuowlo's room. Alone in his room, Hakuowlo asked himself who he is.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = After hearing about their defeat in battle against Tusukuru, Kuuya hold off the invasion for now. Hien told him that they mustn't stop and must continue on unifying all countries so that no one will ever oppose them. Genjimaru told Kuuya to stop invading the other countries because every nation will hate them and that they are only going on a path of destruction. Kuuya denied Genjimaru's suggestion and assured Hien that she vowed to herself that she will unify all countries. After that, Genjimaru followed Dii, a mysterious Onkami who is thought to be dead a long time ago. Dii felt Genjimaru's presence and reminded Genjimaru of the old days, telling him that he is still alive. Furthermore, he told Genjimaru that it is time for them move. Meanwhile at the palace, Hakuowlo is still thinking about what happened at their previous battle because he doesn't recall what happened after he became a monster. Suddenly, he once again remembered a part of his past. In his past, he is confined in his room at some unknown futuristic facility being assisted by Number 3510, a girl who looks like Eruru. At that time, he is already wearing his mask and doesn't have any memories just like he is in the present. Then a hologram of a man called Mizushima appeared to him and calls him Iceman. Mizushima asked if he remembered something especially about his mask. Hakuowlo told him that he is not. Then Mizushima asked him if 3510 is a troubling him. Hakuowlo told him that she isn't and that if there is, he is feeling unpleasant calling her 3510. Mizushima told him that experiments are forbidden to be named according to the rules. He added that if Hakuowlo wants, he can name him since their superiors won't mind if it is him. After a lot of thinking, Hakuowlo named 3510, Mikoto. After that, his recollection had ended. Eruru went to see him to treat his wounds. Eruru told Hakuowlo that treating his wounds reminds her of the first time they meet. Hakuowlo asked if she can stay by his side forever. Eruru can't answer him because she is reminded of the pact she has made with the monster in the forest. At night, Genjimaru and Sakuya went to Hakuowlo's side and asked him to stop Kuuya from continuing on the path of destruction because instead of coexisting with other countries, Kuuya decided to rule over them, making them bear the hate of all countries. Genjimaru also added that he will offer his assistance in leading Hakuowlo's army inside Kunnekamun. Hakuowlo questioned Genjimaru's loyalty to Kuuya. Genjimaru told Hakuowlo that he is doing this, not to betray his master but as a duty of putting his master to the right path. Hakuowlo understood what Genjimaru said to him and accepted him and Sakuya to their side and plan a course of action to stop Kunnekamun. In the meeting room, they decided that they need to unite all the factions that oppose Kunnekamun and that they will need Ulthury and Camyu's father, the high priest (Oruyankuru) to do that. Genjimaru told the high priest is being held at Saharan Island. The next day, Oboro and the others went to rescue the high priest. After everyone said their goodbyes to Oboro and the others, Eruru assisted Yuzuha in her room. Yuzuha felt that Eruru is feeling depressed through Eruru’s cold hands. Yuzuha told her that she shouldn't get worried too much and that she can depend on someone who has a warm heart like Hakuowlo to cheer her up at her times of need. Eruru somehow felt relieve and went back to her room. She is visited by Ulthury and told her that she knew what happened to Hakuowlo at their last battle. She told that the monster inside Hakuowlo is their god, Witsalnemitea. Ulthury told her not to worry about being bound in the contract with Witsalnemitea because a contract with a god doesn't bound her from being with others. Eruru thanked Ulthury and she went to see Hakuowlo again. She answered Hakuowlo's question last night and told him that she will always stay by his side. At night, Oboro and the others successfully rescued the high priest. Ulthury and Camyu happily greeted their father. The high priest told Hakuowlo and the others that he is no longer the high priest and declared Ulthury to be the new high priest.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = With the help of the rebels and Genjimaru's military command the Tusukuru empire stops Kunnekamun and soon turns the tables of the war. Dii teleported Hakuowlo, Genjimaru, and Eruru directly at the throne room of the Kunnekamun Palace. Kuuya confronted them. Hakuowlo asked why she is still continuing the invasion when they could co-exist with the other countries. Kuuya replied that her race of Shakukopolu clan can't co-exist with others because her people had enough abuse from other countries and that they could either ruled or be ruled with other countries. Kuuya then went inside her Avu Kammu and started fighting Hakuowlo. With the help of Genjimaru, telling Hakuowlo the Avu Kammu's weak point, Hakuowlo destroys Kuuya's Avu Kammu. Kuuya went out of her Avu Kammu and brought out her dagger to kill Hakuowlo. Hakuowlo knew that Kuuya can't kill and told Kuuya to kill him while she has a chance. Kuuya resolve herself to kill Hakuowlo but she was unable to do it. She asked Hakuowlo if she can trust him and leave her country to him. Hakuowlo accepted her request and Kuuya accepted her defeat. After that, Oboro and the others made it to the palace. Dii along with Hauenkua and Hien in their Avu Kammu appeared in front of them. Dii greeted Hakuowlo and saw that Hakuowlo has chosen Eruru to be bound by him. Hakuowlo asked who Dii is. Ulthury explained to him that Dii is a philosopher of the Onkamiyamukai who went missing a long time ago during his journey. Dii asked Genjimaru why he keeps on resisting him when he is bound to a contract with him. Genjimaru replied that he just wanted to save Kunnekamun from the verge of destruction and told Dii that he is still grateful to him for being bound in a contract with him after he had committed a crime. Genjimaru asked Hauenkua and Hien why they are siding with Dii when being with Dii will only bring them destruction. They replied that they are bound to their contract with him and that he is their true master, not Kuuya who they only think as a decoration. Having no room for reasoning, Dii ordered Hauenkua and Hien to attack. Ulthury told Hakuowlo to there is no need to hold back in releasing his powers because she will teleport everyone outside. Hakuowlo wondered how much Ulthury knows about him. After Ulthury teleported everyone, Hakuowlo is surprised that Genjimaru who is carrying the unconscious Kuuya are still there. Genjimaru told him that he has unfinished business to deal with. Hakuowlo transform in his monster form and fought against Hauenkua and Hien. With his power, he easily killed Hauenkua and Hien. Meanwhile, after witnessing Hakuowlo's battle, Dii told to himself that as Hakuowlo's other half, he cannot fight him and to stand on an equal footing, Dii called Camyu and awaken her daughter, Mutsumi inside Camyu. Mutsumi is the same as Eruru who is also bound herself to their contractor. Then Genjimaru proceeds to asked Dii to allow Kuuya to live and be freed from the contract that her ancestors made to obtain the Avu Kammu in exchange for his life. Dii fulfilled his wish. With the contract fulfilled, Kuuya will be secured with Genjimaru's death. So Genjimaru made a futile resistance against Dii and got torn into pieces by the latter. After that, Kuuya regains consciousness and saw Genjimaru's remains. Dii told her that she is no longer bound to the contract and that she is allowed to live. But since the Genjimaru's sacrifice only applies to Kuuya, Mutsumi burned down Kunnekamun in frustration of leaving Kuuya alive. After that, Dii and Mutsumi flew out of the palace. As the palace burns down, Hakuowlo carried the broken Kuuya outside the palace and meet up with the others.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = After the loss of Kunnekamun, Ulthury told Hakuowlo that Dii and Mutsumi will be in the mausoleum of Onkamiyamukai. Hakuowlo asked Ulthury who he and Dii really are and what have become of Camyu. Ulthury told him that Hakuowlo and Dii each possessed the other half of Witsalnemitea. Furthermore she told Hakuowlo that Camyu is the reincarnation of their ancestor who reincarnates from time to time in order to be with Witsalnemitea. Knowing that they will be facing Camyu in the future, Ulthury asked Hakuowlo to save Camyu. The next day, Hakuowlo called Oboro and asked him to be the next emperor if something happens to him. After that, Eruru called Hakuowlo and told him that Kuuya regained consciousness and wanted to see him. When he arrived in Kuuya's room, he noticed that Kuuya still haven't recovered from her shock at the destruction of her country. Her mind has reverted to her childhood days as a self-defense to escape the heavy burden that the reality has showed her and she can only remember Hakuowlo. Hakuowlo apologized to her for not being able to save her country. At night, Eruru and Aruru went to see Hakuowlo and asked him to come with him to Onkamiyamukai tomorrow as they are bound to serve him according to contract he made with the two. The next day, Oboro and the others waited for Hakuowlo, Eruru, and Aruru at the palace gate. They also asked to come with him. Arriving at the mausoleum of Onkamiyamukai, they were engaged by red slimes and Mutsumi. As he tries to bring back Camyu, Hakuowlo speaks to Mutsumi to come back with them. Mutsumi said that it is impossible because Camyu is just one of her persona. She also said to Hakuowlo that he shouldn't be here because he will remember the truth. After that, Mutsumi went deep within the ruins. While Oboro and the others are fighting against the slimes, Hakuowlo, Eruru, and Aruru went after Mutsumi. Awaiting them there is a blocked path. Mutsumi is on the other side of the blocked path. With Eruru’s silver ring hair accessory, the door that blocks their path opens. Seeing what is beyond the door, Hakuowlo once again remembered a part of his memories. At that time, Mizushima told Hakuowlo that his superiors ordered him to put Hakuowlo to cold sleep because they don't have the technology to gain information in his existence. But instead, Mizushima asked Hakuowlo to escape the facility with Mikoto and the other test subjects. Hakuowlo asked Mizushima why he had a sudden change of heart. Mizushima told him that he fears that if he further experiments on the test subjects, it will make him emotionally numb. After that, Hakuowlo and the test subjects have escaped the facility. Back in the present, they saw Mutsumi beyond the door and tried to convince her again. Upon seeing Aruru, Camyu is regaining her consciousness within Mitsumi, recalling the days she spent with Aruru. Then, Dii appeared. He asked Hakuowlo to leave because Hakuowlo has no reason to be in the ruins and since Dii lost his battle after his ace, Kunnekamun's defeat against Hakuowlo, Dii will be sleeping until the time that they could fight each other again. Hakuowlo asked him why he let the people wage war with each other. Dii told him that it is a way to show his love to them because he deemed war necessary in order for the people to progress, sacrificing those who are weak. Hakuowlo didn't like Dii's way of doing things and wanted to settle their fight now. Hakuowlo breaks his contract with Eruru and transform into his monster form. Dii transformed as well. Both Hakuowlo and Dii went outside the ruins. Outside the ruins, Oboro and the others found out about Hakuowlo's true. Then, the battle between two Gods began.\n| LineColor           =\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = While Hakuowlo and Dii are fighting against each other in their monster form, Dii keeps on reminding Hakuowlo of his past. Dii revealed to Hakuowlo his urge of fighting him is because he wanted to become whole after he killed Hakuowlo. Then, Hakuowlo regained the final piece of his memory. In this memory, Hakuowlo and Mikoto have been living together and had a child. Hakuowlo gave his child a ring as a keepsake. The ring is the same hair accessory that Eruru has meaning that Hakuowlo and Mikoto are Eruru and Aruru’s ancestor. After that, soldiers from the facility found Hakuowlo, Mikoto, and their child. The soldiers captured them and taken them back at the facility. After regaining consciousness, he saw that he is shackled and back in the facility. Hakuowlo asked the scientist about the whereabouts of Mikoto. The scientist told him that they had Mikoto dissected because Mikoto is the first of the test subjects to bear a child. Furthermore, the scientist showed Hakuowlo a replica of his mask and now that they have him in their hands, they will be able to achieve immortality very soon. With the loss of Mikoto, Hakuowlo had succumbed to his rage, breaking the shackles that binds him, and granted the scientist their wish of becoming immortal by turning them into red slimes, cursing them for eternity. As Hakuowlo continues to rampage, a part of him wanted to stop what he is doing but he can't. As Hakuowlo asks for help, Mutsumi appeared to him and sealed him in the earth, splitting his spirit into two. Back at the present, Hakuowlo regained the rage he felt a long time ago and was able to kill Dii, beheading him. After the battle, Hakuowlo can no longer return to his human form. He also cannot suppress his rage and might attack the others, now that his horrible memories, the source of his rage have returned. He asked Ulthury to seal him. Ulthury feels reluctant of sealing their god. Mutsumi told her that she is not the only one who will bear the sin and so Mutsumi awakens Camyu's persona to help Ulthury in sealing Hakuowlo. After the sisters chanted the seal, Eruru and the others were surrounded by white light. In there, Hakuowlo's spirit appeared to them to say his farewell to each one of them. Before Hakuowlo go, Eruru said her true feelings and confessed her love to Hakuowlo as she told him that she doesn't want him to go and that she loves him. Eruru went and kissed Hakuowlo. As he disappears, Hakuowlo promise Eruru that he will return to them someday. Then, a flash of light shines again and returned everyone back in outside the ruins. After a few months, Oboro became the new emperor of Tusukuru. He went to visit Yuzuha, who have already died, in her grave. He gave her the bell that she likes and told her that he will be going on a journey for a while because he believes that he isn't ready to take the throne and that he needs to learn many things first.

But before he could tell the man's name, he got interrupted by Kamuchatāru whereas Eruru has already made a conclusion that the man is Benawi. After that, Eruru asked Nopon and Kamuchatāru to get her materials and some ingredients at the palace. Kamuchatāru asked her to stop doing it because helping her will hurt her pride. Then, she told Eruru that she was once a princess of their country, the daughter of Inkara. She got betrayed by the people of their country and sought revenge against their new empire, Tusukuru. She, Nopon, and Gomuta were captured and were supposed to be executed. The man she fell in love pardoned them out of compassion. She told her that she doesn't want to trouble that person anymore. Eruru told Kamuchatāru that she won't stop. Furthermore, she told Kamuchatāru that she mustn't deceive her heart because a medicine for one's heart is better than a medicine for the body. Meanwhile, at the palace, news of Eruru’s disappearance has spread. After finding a lead, Benawi told Hakuowlo that he will be handling the case. After gathering the things they need at Eruru’s room and were about to return, Nopon and Gomuta were seen by Aruru, Camyu, and Yuzuha. They told them that Eruru is with them and is helping them to make a medicine for their mistress. After that, they successfully return to Kamuchatāru's place.

While fishing, Hakuowlo told Touka, stories about the spirit of the river, who swims in the river in the form of a fish. After a while, Benawi found where they are fishing. Benawi dragged Hakuowlo back to the palace to continue his royal duties. Before he goes, Hakuowlo told Touka to catch the spirit of the river. With that said, Touka waited for the spirit of the river to take her bait. Then suddenly a huge fish grab her bait. Touka pulled her fishing rod as best as she can, struggling against the fish. Aruru got caught in their struggle and fell down in the river. The current dragged Aruru away and got lost. After she saw what happened to Aruru, Touka pulled her fishing rod even harder and finally caught the huge fish. With its size, Touka assumed that it is the spirit of the river. Then, she quickly went to look for Aruru while carrying the fish. Touka searched for Aruru for several hours. It's at night time that she found Aruru sleeping within the forest. Touka camped there for the night and vowed to her sword that she must protect Aruru, grabbing the sword that was supposed to be with her. She remembered that she left her sword with Mukkuru from where she and Hakuowlo went to fish earlier during the day. The huge fish gained consciousness and is going to return to the river. Touka saw it and knock it out again. Touka is surprised that it is still alive after staying at land for several hours, making her believe that the fish is really the spirit of the river. The next day, at the palace, Hakuowlo and the others are having their breakfast. He knew that Touka and Aruru are still catching the spirit of the river but he felt that there is still someone missing on the table. He noticed that Oboro and one of the twins who serve Oboro are gone.  He asked one of the twins, Gurā, of their whereabouts. Gurā told him that they are out to search for Touka and Aruru in the forest. Camyu told everyone present at the table that there is a huge monster reported to be seen roaming the forest according to a newspaper and hoped that everyone in the forest are okay. At the forest, it didn't take long for Oboro and Dorī to found Touka and Aruru. Instead of meeting with them, Oboro asked Dorī to observe what they are doing for now. Touka went to fish for breakfast. She went for a dive in the river and miserably fell head first on the shallow river. Oboro laugh at Touka's blunder. In the end Touka failed to get any fish and went back to Aruru. She saw Aruru eating some edible worms in the forest. Aruru gave her one to eat but her appetite can't take it and humorously passed out. After regaining consciousness, she went to gather mushrooms. Pretty sure that the mushrooms she gathered are not poisonous, she ate them. Moments later, she felt the effects of the mushrooms’ poison. Aruru quickly searched for an antidote and gave it to her. After that, they are on their way to return home. Touka leads the way and with every obstacle they found, she always fails to get by while Oboro gets to laugh at her. While taking their break, Touka said to Aruru that Aruru seems to be good at adapting in the forest. Aruru told her that she and Eruru were trained by their grandmother because it is necessary for them to gather herbs in the forest. As she got depressed, Touka apologized for being useless. Aruru got up and urged her that they should return to the palace. At night, they are almost out of the forest, when they heard someone screamed. They went to look for the source of the noise. They found Dorī and a huge monster, who Touka believe to be the real spirit of the forest, swallowing Oboro. Touka helped Oboro got out of the monster. After they helped him, Oboro emitted a foul smell that came from the monster. Without her sword, Touka is having a hard time fighting the monster. Mukkuru suddenly appeared and helped them. It gave Touka her sword. Before she attacks, she told to herself that even if the monster is the real spirit of the forest, such malicious being should not be presented to her master, Hakuowlo. In four strikes, Touka defeated the monster. The monster retreated to the river. Touka, Aruru, and the others have finally returned to the palace. Hakuowlo met up with them, relieved to see them okay. Touka reported to him that she failed to catch the spirit of the river and instead present to him the fish that may somehow be also called the spirit of the river.

She introduces herself as Kuon and takes the man to a nearby village where she is going to deliver medicine. As the man cannot give his name, Kuon names him Haku, mentioning that the name has a long history. Haku helps Kuon with jobs in the village, and is sent to work a broken grindmill. Rather than waste effort grinding grain manually, he fixes the broken water wheel so he can sleep. A man named Ukon discovers he has fixed the grindmill, but Haku asks him not to tell anyone so he won't be requested to do more repair work. Later that night, a group of villagers that have left the village are attacked and killed by an unknown entity.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Kuon and Ukon enjoy their Amamunii at the inn whilst Haku is astonished at Kuon's insatiable appetite. The inn keeper finds Haku and in return for fixing the watermill, which we learn was a week ago, adds bonus to his pay. Haku's remarkable aptitude is hinted when he correctly calculates his pay without effort surprising the inn keeper and Kuon. Intrigued, Kuon tests Haku's arithmetic abilities which he passes with ease. Thus Kuon concludes that Haku is more suited with tasks involving his mind rather than physical labour. Shortly, the villagers gather around a group of injured field workers who were attacked by insects called Gigiri. Kuon tends to their wounds which catches Ukon's attention. Later, Ukon informs Kuon that he was instructed to get rid of Gigiris by the village elders and invites her to act as a healer in his group. Kuon accepts under the condition that Haku is allowed to tag along. Ukon obliges then the group sets off on their quest. Maroro, a scholar and a noble, is then introduced who is also part of the expedition. Upon arriving at their destination, the group begins laying traps to lure the Gigiris. As swarms of Gigiris fall for the trap, Maroro finishes them off using thaumaturgy (magic). The group then slays the remaining Gigiris when suddenly, a larger Gigiri (Boro-Gigiri) appears and slays one of Ukon's men. The group are forced to retreat as more Gigiris start appearing. With Maroro collapsing in fear and almost killed during the process, Haku pulls him to safety. As the group rests and regroup, they decide the Boro-Gigiri must be slain for the safety of their village. Ukon orders the wounded to return to the village whilst Kuon, Maroro and the reluctant Haku are asked to stay. With no other choice, Haku comes up with a plan to lure the tatari from where he first encountered it in order to use it against the Boro-Gigiri. Although he remains skeptical of his own plan, the effervescent Kuon agrees and sets of to lure the tatari leaving Haku, Ukon and Maroro to lure the Boro-Gigiri. The trio successfully lures the Boro-Gigiri however Ukon is forced to fight it while the helpless Maroro and Haku are forced to watch. With Ukon disarmed and his both hands battling against the monstrous clutches of the Boro-Gigiri's mandibles, Haku remembers the flash bang that Kuon had entrusted to him earlier. He then launches it at the Boro-Gigiri but it fails to activate. Nevertheless, the adept Ukon is able to activate it with his feet and is able free himself as a result. Meanwhile, Kuon is able to lure the tatari and the group is successfully able to force the tatari to devour the Boro-Gigiri. The tatari peacefully retreats, seemingly recognising Haku.

But the misunderstanding is soon cleared when Ukon welcomes Rurutie, princess of Kujuuri, who was hiding behind the beast, Kokopo, and talking with Haku the entire time. Her motive to visit the village is revealed after Ukon explains to Haku and Kuon that he and his group were tasked to escort Rurutie to the capital, Yamato, and invites the duo to join him. Soon the group, Maroro included, leaves and Kokopo appears to have taken a liking to Haku surprising Rurutie. As night falls, the group sets up camp and as Kuon is about to fetch water inviting Rurutie along, Haku offers help and asks the girls to stay in an attempt to impress them. He soon regrets his short-lived bravado as he struggles to carry the buckets now filled with water. Maroro appears and offers help but to no avail with Kokopo having to save the \"damsels\" in distress in transporting the buckets. Back at camp, a relaxed Kuon and Rurutie enjoy their hot baths when Kuon notices a presence lurking in the shadows. Immediately, grabbing a wooden bucket, she darts towards the forest and tosses it towards the intruder, whom appears to be in sight, but the projectile is blocked by a tree. In the midst of the commotion, a nonchalant Haku appears in front of a nude Kuon but appears unfazed by the situation while Kuon shudders in embarrassment. The next day, the group continues their journey and Haku notices there are fewer people in it. Then in middle of the road, they encounter a woman whose cart has been stuck in a rut. As the group help her, they are ambushed by bandits whilst the woman, armed with a knife, suddenly points it at towards Ukon's neck whose expression remains relatively calm. Since the group is outnumbered and surrounded, they are forced to surrender. The woman, Nosuri, is applauded by her partners in crime who begin looting the cargos. With ulterior motive, one of the bandits, Mozunu, taunts Rurutie and Kuon but is warned by Nosuri that their deal was to only loot cargos and if breached, their alliance is called off. The bandits leave but the group remains calm, having seemingly anticipated the commotion. As Haku asks Ukon what he plans to do, a cool-headed Ukon admits it was all a plot to capture the bandits while at the meantime, the 'missing bunch' from the group have already started making their move. As the bandits reach their hideout, an optimistic Mozunu, who appears to be the leader of his gang that partnered with Nosuri and her guard, begins to plan their future together to reign terror. However, immediately, Nosuri calls off the alliance along with her guard, having transpired that Ukon's group have used the Trojan Horse strategy to invade the hideout. The guard let loose the cargo and Ukon's men begin flooding the scene. Haku, Kuon, and Maroro stay with Rurutie and Kokopo whilst Ukon leads his group to join the battle to liberate the bandits. As Maroro worries about the safety of his comrades, Rurutie asks Haku how he is able to trust Ukon so easily admitting jealousy. Back at the battlefield, the bandits are easily overwhelmed by the opposition whilst the helpless Mozunu escapes from a secret passage along with two of his men as Nosuri and her guard looks on. Remarkably, the exit of the secret passage appears to be behind where Haku and his group are. Mozunu decides to take the group hostages so that they can escape. With Maroro knocked out from unsuccessfully trying to cast a spell and Kuon and Rurutie apprehended, Mozunu begins taunting Haku. However, his master plan is soon foiled by the enraged Kokopo who forces the three bandits to flee towards an unidentified masked man with a brigade of troops. The masked man, who appears to be the Royal General of the Right called Oshutoru, orders his troops to arrest the bandits then congratulates Haku and Kuon for protecting Rurutie and bids farewell remarking that they will meet at the capital, Yamato, again.

Nekone approaches Ukon and as she interrogates him, Haku is dumbfounded to find out they are siblings. After the siblings briefly catch up, Ukon suggests it is time to try out the inn's famous baths which electrifies Kuon. At the bath, Nekone questions Kuon's relationship with Ukon whilst Rurutie is happy Kuon considers her as a friend. On the other side of the bath, Ukon asks Haku what he is going to do now that he has reached the capital but Haku is lax about the whole situation and instead jokes if Nekone is really his sister. Then Maroro reveals that Nekone is actually a genius who was refused the title of scholar due to her young age. With the conversations on both sides intensifying, the topic turns to the relationship between Haku and Kuon but the two hints their relationship is platonic with Kuon being nothing more and nothing less of a guardian for Haku. The next morning, Nekone offers to guide Haku, Kuon and Rurutie around the capital. As the group tour the capital, it is revealed Yamato was built by the emperor centuries ago who is still alive and rules the country. The group reach a lively bazaar when all attention turns to the arrival of Oshutoru who appears to have the people of Yamato in his favour. The group then decide it is time to move on to the main event: finding Haku a job since he is living off Kuon ever since they first met. Immediately, Haku is forced to work at a restaurant and, to his dismay, straight away has to deal with rowdy customers. However, Haku is able to keep the customers at bay surprising Nekone. Later on, with Kuon and Rurutie having returned, Haku is confronted by Nekone on how he is able to trusts others so easily; Nekone's solitary past is unveiled with Ukon being the only person beside her the entire time, which explains why she is so affectionate of him. Haku explains to Nekone venturing to the unknown is exciting and that it is a waste to not enjoy it, which coincidentally is exactly what Ukon had told Nekone in the past. Later on at night, having completed his shift, Haku reunites with the group and surprises everyone when he is not able to read an invitation letter sent to him by Ukon. The group accompanies Haku to the meeting point but is surprised to find Oshutoru instead. Oshutoru informs Haku that he wishes to be his patron, on account of Maroro's highest recommendation. He then removes his mask revealing to be Ukon all along with Oshutoru being his actual identity. Haku is unable to respond to what he just witnessed. The episode ends with Kuon, Rurutie and Nekone enjoying the inn's famous bath.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = On a clear bright morning, the people of Yamato gather to watch a parade while the kvetching Haku is tasked to clean gutters with a cheerful Kuon helping beside him. Haku's attention is turned to the sudden appearance of a masked individual, armed with a bow, on a hot pursuit. As Haku questions what he just witnessed, Ukon greets and invites him to his place along with Kuon. They later enjoy their baths and it is revealed Ukon invited the duo earlier in order to bestow them the honour of protecting the capital in his stead. Whilst the inexperienced and laid back Haku wasn't keen on the proposal, Kuon appeared to be rather level-headed and enthusiastic about the whole ordeal, especially when Ukon pulled out a huge pile of cash in an attempt to encourage the duo. Back at the inn, Haku and Kuon go over their first mission which appears to be ordinary tasks involving carpentry, manning stalls and handling cargos. Haku asserts, instead of having to work, they can live off from the cash Ukon had offered to them earlier. However to his dismay, Kuon reveals that it has all been used up in order to establish a base of their operation at the inn. Nekone joins the conversation and supports Kuon's decision by adding that staying at an inn like Hakuroukaku guarantees confidentiality and security but in reality, Haku discovers they are there just for the inn's famous baths. Haku is then given heaps of book in order to learn to read and write and the days pass with him working on his ‘missions’ by day and studying till late at night. He eventually manages to finish all the study materials and Kuon finally allows him to take a day off. The next day, Kuon is approached by Ukon to discuss an urgent matter meanwhile Haku's day off is interrupted by a mysterious girl who suddenly bumps into him whilst running away from a masked pursuer. Unintentionally, Haku also becomes the target of the pursuer when the girl blatantly affirms her affiliation with Haku who is forced to run away with her as a result. They arrive at an alley and it appears the girl is actually running away from home to live in freedom and that the pursuer was actually sent to retrieve her by her dad. But more importantly, the girl reveals that she is looking to fall in love and forces Haku to assist her. On the other hand, Kuon and Nekone begin to search for a specific person with Rurutie remaining on stand-by at the inn while Haku and the girl begin visiting best spots in the capital for couples. With the sun about to set, Haku and the girl are confronted again by their pursuer but the situation take a turn for the better when Haku jokingly questions the authenticity of the pursuer who refuses to take off his mask and reveal his true intentions for his action. Just then, Kuon and Nekone arrive at the scene which forces the pursuer to take off his mask and reveal his identity as Kiuru, thanks to Nekone's presence.
