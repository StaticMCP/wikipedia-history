This engagement was part of a broader campaign launched by the SNM across multiple fronts, including Hargeisa and Burco, to destabilize the Somali government’s control in the northern regions.\nBackground\nIn 1988, the SNM intensified its guerrilla warfare operations against the Somali regime, transitioning into large-scale offensives aimed at liberating strategic towns. The SNM's leadership strategically planned simultaneous attacks on key locations, with Cadaadley, located approximately 90&nbsp;km east of Hargeisa, being a focal point due to its military significance.\nThe Battle\nThe SNM launched a surprise attack on the SNA garrison in Cadaadley using three brigades led by commanders such as Colonel Xuseen Dheere. Their assault targeted SNA positions, leveraging extensive reconnaissance and coordination. The SNA defended the garrison with a full division commanded by General Kaahiye, but the SNM’s strategic advantage and determination overwhelmed the government forces.\nAftermath\nThe SNM emerged victorious, inflicting heavy casualties on the SNA and seizing critical assets. The defeat demoralized the SNA leadership, and General Kaahiye, reportedly unable to reconcile with the loss, took his own life shortly after the battle. This victory bolstered the SNM's momentum, enabling subsequent successes in Hargeisa and Burco, and further weakening the Somali regime's grip on Somaliland.\nReferences\n* [https://www.oodweynemedia.com/2024/05/29/maanta-oo-kale-cadaadley-29-may-1988/ \"Maanta oo Kale: Cadaadley 29 May 1988\"] - Oodweyne Media, 29 May 2024\n* [https://hadhwanaagnews.ca/articles/16084/Qiimeynta-Guud-Guda-Galkii-SNM-Ee-Sadexda-Aag-Ee-Cadaadley-Hargeysa-Iyo-Burco-1988-Qeybta-4aad \"Qiimeynta Guud Guda Galkii SNM Ee Sadexda Aag Ee Cadaadley Hargeysa Iyo Burco 1988 Qeybta 4aad\"] - Hadhwanaag News\n* [https://bandhige.com/maqaallo/guda-galkii-snm-cadaadley-29-may-1988-mujaahid-janan-oogo-iyo-guda-galkii-snm-ee-burco-saamaynta-uu-ku-lahaa-wq-sulaymaan-yuusuf-dhakhtar \"Guda Galkii SNM: Cadaadley 29 May 1988, Mujaahid Janan Oogo iyo Guda Galkii SNM ee Burco Saamaynta uu ku lahaa WQ, Sulaymaan Yuusuf Dhakhtar\"] - Bandhige\n* [https://www.araweelonews.com/qubanaha/xusuusta-1988-gen-gacantiisa-isku-a-markii-uu-garwaaqsan-waayay-guul-darada-uu-kala-kulmay-gulufkii-dagaal-ee-snm-by-carraale-m-jama/ \"Xusuusta 1988: Gen.
