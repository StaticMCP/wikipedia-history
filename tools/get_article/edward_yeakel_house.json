It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nIt is Queen Anne in style.  It is two-and-a-half-stories tall, and has a three-story tower.  It was built for Edward Yeakel, a merchant in Brandenburg.  It was bought in 1920 by a Dr. Baxter, who used it for a medical office and as a residence.  The property was deemed \"architecturally significant as the outstanding example of the Queen Anne style in Brandenburg.\"\nThe listing included a second contributing building, which might be either a one-story root cellar built of limestone and brick, or a one-story frame carriage house.\nReferences"
