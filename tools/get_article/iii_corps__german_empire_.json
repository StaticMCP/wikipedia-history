Its headquarters was in Berlin and its catchment area was the Province of Brandenburg.\nIn peacetime, the Corps was assigned to the IV Army Inspectorate, joining the 1st Army at the start of the First World War. It was still in existence at the end of the war in the 7th Army, Heeresgruppe Deutscher Kronprinz on the Western Front. The Corps was disbanded with the demobilisation of the German Army after World War I.\nWar of the Sixth Coalition\nIn 1813 the III Corps fought at the battles of Luckau, Grossbeeren, Dennewitz, Leipzig and Arnhem. In 1814, the corps fought at Hoogstraten and Laon.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%;\"\n|+Nov. 1813–Jan. 1814 organization of the Corps\n! Corps\n!

Each consisted of two divisions with usually two infantry brigades, one field artillery brigade and a cavalry brigade each. Each brigade normally consisted of two regiments of the appropriate type, so each Corps normally commanded 8 infantry, 4 field artillery and 4 cavalry regiments. There were exceptions to this rule:\n:V, VI, VII, IX and XIV Corps each had a 5 infantry brigades (so 10 infantry regiments)\n:II, XIII, XVIII and XXI Corps had a 9 infantry regiments\n:I, VI and XVI Corps had a 3 cavalry brigades (so 6 cavalry regiments)\n:the Guards Corps had 11 infantry regiments (in 5 brigades) and 8 cavalry regiments (in 4 brigades).\nEach Corps also directly controlled a number of other units.
