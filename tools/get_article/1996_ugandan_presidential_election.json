They were the first direct presidential elections in Uganda's history, following the adoption of the 1995 constitution. Conducted under the \"no-party\" or \"Movement System,\" candidates ran as independents due to a ban on political party activities, though affiliations with groups like the National Resistance Movement (NRM) and Democratic Party (DP) influenced campaigns. Incumbent president Yoweri Museveni won a landslide victory with 74% of the vote, defeating Paul Ssemogerere and Kibirige Mayanja. Voter turnout was 73%. While international observers described the election as largely valid, opposition candidates alleged irregularities, including voter intimidation and unfair campaign practices.\nBackground\nThe elections followed decades of political instability, including Idi Amin's regime (1971–1979) and Milton Obote's second term (1980–1985). Museveni, who seized power in 1986 through the National Resistance Army (NRA), introduced the \"Movement System\" to curb ethnic-based politics, arguing multiparty systems fuelled division. The 1995 constitution formalised this no-party framework, allowing political parties to exist but prohibiting their campaign activities. The Electoral Commission of Uganda, established in 1995, managed the election amid challenges like the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency in the north, testing Museveni's reforms.\nCandidates\nThree candidates competed. Museveni, backed by the NRM, campaigned on his record of stabilising Uganda and driving economic growth. Paul Ssemogerere, a former Foreign Affairs Minister under Museveni and Democratic Party leader, ran under the Inter-Party Forces Cooperation (IPFC) banner, advocating for multiparty democracy. Kibirige Mayanja, affiliated with the Justice Forum (JEEMA), had limited resources. Other potential candidates, including Aggrey Awori and Francis Bwengye, were mentioned but did not appear on the ballot, reflecting organisational barriers under the no-party system.\nCampaign\nThe campaign, monitored by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) from April to June 1996, was constrained by the no-party system, limiting traditional party rallies. Museveni’s campaign highlighted achievements like economic recovery and HIV/AIDS initiatives, bolstered by NRM's access to state resources and media. Ssemogerere pushed for democratic reforms but faced supporter harassment and limited media exposure. Mayanja's campaign struggled for visibility. A controversial NRM advert featuring skulls from the Luweero war, where Museveni's NRA fought, was condemned by Electoral Commissioner Steven Owor for exploiting past atrocities. Reports of voter intimidation and media bias further tainted the process.\nConduct\nInternational observers, including IFES and USAID-funded missions, found the election procedurally valid within the no-party framework but identified flaws. Issues included voter register inaccuracies, limited voter education, and isolated intimidation incidents. The U.S. Department of State documented opposition rally disruptions and press restrictions, with journalists facing arrests under sedition laws. Domestic observer Steven Owor noted \"fundamental flaws\" in the electoral process,\n}}\nAftermath\nMuseveni was sworn in on 12 May 1996 at Kololo Airstrip in Kampala, solidifying his rule. The parliamentary elections on 27 June 1996 saw NRM supporters secure 156 of the 276 seats, entrenching the Movement System. Ssemogerere, discouraged by the defeat and opposition constraints, largely withdrew from politics, retiring by 2005. The election set precedents for Uganda’s electoral process but highlighted opposition challenges under the no-party system. The Movement System continued until a 2005 referendum restored multiparty politics, though electoral fairness debates persisted in later elections.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ec.or.ug/sites/Elec_results/Nat_Res_1996.pdf 1996 Presidential Election Results] Electoral Commission of Uganda\n*[https://www.ifes.org/publications/uganda-long-term-observation-1996-presidential-and-legislative-elections-may-july-1996 Long-Term Observation Report] IFES"
