Shuhei and Mizuki thought that they were not ordinary people because of each other's murderous intent, but they soon realized that it was meaningless and did not fight. Osamu gave Mizuki rice balls, and the parents and children began to eat. Shuhei, who was hungry, was envious of him, but silently sat down in a corner of the warehouse and took a rest. Then, in order not to let Mizuki go to Nishimura-gumi, 7 or 8 Higashida-gumi members appeared and attacked Mizuki. Mizuki mercilessly beats up the gang members, cuts them down and throws them away, but Osamu is taken hostage. When Shuhei sees it, he comes to the rescue and uses destructive punching and kicking techniques to defeat the rest of the gang and take Osamu back safely. As a thank you for helping, Shuhei received a rice ball. Mizuki told Osamu, \"Don't rely on others,\" and left this place with Osamu. Shuhei, who was traveling aimlessly, was wandering around this town, but because he took an injured person involved in a conflict between yakuza in the city to the town doctor, Tachibana, the conflict between the Higashida group and the Nishimura group. I know that the townspeople are crying. Sakata, who smelled the money, jumped into the yakuza conflict over one-billion yen of drugs, but there was a fateful confrontation with Mizuki.\nCast\n*Sonny Chiba\n*Isao Natsuyagi\n*Akiko Koyama\n*Akane Kawasaki\n*Hideo Murota\n*Eiji Gô\n*Bin Amatsu\n*Nenji Kobayashi\n*Yayoi Watanabe\n*Tatsuo Umemiya\nRelease\nIn 1991, when 14 fighting movies starring Chiba were revived in Los Angeles, this work was also screened.\nOn November 20, 2007, BCI Eclipse released the film in their Sonny Chiba Collection DVD set, which also includes Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon, The Bullet Train, Dragon Princess, Karate Kiba, and Sister Street Fighter.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
