Red deer on Exmoor National Park are larger than red deer in Scotland owing to their diet.\nThe deer was given its nickname by photographer Richard Austin.  Its body was reportedly discovered near the A361 road between Tiverton and Barnstaple in Devon, during the annual rutting season. It was reportedly killed by a licensed hunter, and an unnamed man reported hearing two shots.  Within a few days, other local observers reported having seen the animal alive, leading to the suggestion that this may be a manufactured story. Few of the reported facts can actually be verified. The Guardian called the story \"a myth\".\nThe animal was believed to be around 12 years old at the time of the claim, but healthy. Older animals are sometimes culled, particularly when their incisor teeth are worn, making it difficult for them to survive the winter, but a former worker in deer management stated that \"The Emperor was starting to get past his best, but he was definitely not at that stage yet.\"\nThe same observer stated, on the topic of stalking during rut, \"... we should maintain a standard and stop all persecution during this important time of the year\", but the practice is legal and the importance of hunting, both in species management and to the local economy, is asserted by the national park authority.\nDeer stalking is legal in Britain under the Deer Act 1991, although hunters must seek permission from the landowner. The heads can fetch over £1000. The possible death of the Emperor of Exmoor prompted several MPs to sign an Early Day Motion with the intent to ban hunting of wild animals in Britain.\nA head said to resemble the Emperor's was hung in the Hartnoll Hotel in Bolham, Devon in December 2011. The head was removed after the hotel received threats.\nReferences"
