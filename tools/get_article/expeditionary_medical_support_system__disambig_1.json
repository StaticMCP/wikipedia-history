The EMEDS team is equipped and staffed to provide forward stabilization, primary care, dental services, and force health protection.\nIn late September 2014, the U.S. military sent 4,000 troops to Africa to establish treatment centers to support the medical campaign to defeat the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa in an operation called Operation United Assistance. The troops are tasked with building EMEDS modular hospitals. Plans included building a 25-bed hospital for health care workers and 17 treatment centers with 100 beds each.\nReferences"
