The truce was signed on 10 August 1583 at the Plyussa River north of the city of Pskov. The truce was set to expire in 1586, but was extended in 1585–1586.\nAccording to the truce, Sweden kept the annexed Russian towns of Ivangorod (Ivanslott), Jamburg, Koporye (Kaprio) and Korela (Kexholm/Käkisalmi) with their uyezds, holding control over Ingria. Russia kept a narrow passage to the Baltic Sea at the estuary of the Neva River, between Strelka and Sestra Rivers.\nUpon the expiration of the truce in 1590, Russia resumed the war against Sweden. In 1593, Russia and Sweden resumed peace negotiations, which would last for two years. Finally, the two countries signed the 1595 Treaty of Teusina (Tyavzino).\nThe aftermath was Sweden annexing northern Livonia.\nSee also\n*Swedish Ingria\n*List of treaties\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110930042457/http://www.ieg-mainz.de/likecms/index.php?site=site.htm&dir=&nav=&siteid=133&treaty=690&page=2&lastsiteid=77&sq=&is_fts=1&filter_select=&filter_wt=&filter_id=&filter_l=&filter_p=&searchlang=de&searchstring=1583&date=&year_from=&year_till=&location= Scan of the treaty (IEG Mainz)]"
