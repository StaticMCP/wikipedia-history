The facility included a semi-circular roundhouse, a turntable, and associated servicing structures; it served DL&W locomotive operations in the Utica yard area through much of the 20th century. 0\nHistory\nThe locomotive servicing facility at Utica was associated with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W), a Class I railroad that operated in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The site became an important local service point for steam—and later diesel—locomotives serving DL&W traffic in the Mohawk Valley region. According to surviving accounts from railroad records and railroad-enthusiast research, an original turntable associated with the facility was installed in 1906 when the roundhouse and service complex was sited at the \"new\" yard location behind Potter Street. 1\nThe facility reportedly contained locomotive stalls (the roundhouse), a transfer table in the earlier shop complex, a coaling facility, fueling and sanding structures, and offices where engine crews reported for duty. Some accounts note that the Utica facility assembled locomotives in its shops and had been modified over time to accommodate larger motive power. 2\nDescription\nContemporary descriptions and aerial/roadside observations indicate the roundhouse backed directly against Oriskany Boulevard and occupied the rail-side yard area west/northwest of the Oriskany village/Utica city boundary. The structure and turntable were accessible from what later became Conrail and successor freight trackage serving the Binghamton–Utica corridor. In some accounts the turntable was enlarged in the late 1920s (reportedly replaced or lengthened to about 90 ft) to handle larger locomotives. 3\nDecline and demolition\nLike many steam-era service facilities, the Utica roundhouse lost significance with the dieselization and rationalization of railroading in the mid-20th century. Enthusiast accounts and local-history threads indicate the roundhouse building itself was taken down in August 1980; the turntable pit and some foundations remained visible and overgrown for years afterward, and the table saw infrequent use into the early 1980s under Conrail and later briefly under New York, Susquehanna & Western (NYSW / NYSW) operations. 4\nBy the 1990s–2000s the site was described as neglected and overgrown; visitor and railfan photographs show the pit and some concrete foundations or partial yard structures still visible but the roundhouse building itself gone. Local historic and rail-enthusiast sources record the site as one of several former Utica roundhouse/turntable locations (other railroads such as the New York, Ontario & Western and the New York Central also had facilities in the broader Utica yard area). 5\nRemains and legacy\nAs of the most recent online reports and railfan field notes, the turntable pit and/or foundations at the DL&W Utica site remain traceable in aerial imagery and by on-site observation, though overgrown and not in active rail service. The site is of local interest to railroad historians, photographers, and heritage researchers documenting the DL&W and other Mohawk Valley rail facilities. Oneida County historical organizations are resources for further research into the yard and shop complex histories. 6\nResearch and archival sources\nPrimary archival records for DL&W facilities (including drawings and yard plans that reference Utica and the Utica division) are held in railroad archives and finding aids (for example, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Records finding aid maintained by the National Museum of American History / Smithsonian). Secondary documentation of the Utica roundhouse in public online form is largely in rail-enthusiast forums, regional roundhouse lists, and local history walking-tour materials. Additional verification from contemporaneous local newspapers, Oneida County archives, and DL&W corporate records is recommended for expansion and for meeting Wikipedia sourcing standards. 7\nReferences"
