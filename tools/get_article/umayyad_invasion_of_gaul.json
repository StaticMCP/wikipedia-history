The Umayyad invasion occurred in two main phases, from AD 719 and from 732. Although the Umayyads secured control of Septimania, their incursions beyond this region into the Loire and Rhône valleys failed. In 759, Muslim forces lost Septimania to the Christian Frankish Empire and retreated to the Iberian Peninsula which they called al-Andalus.\nThe 719 Umayyad invasion of Gaul was the continuation of their conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania. Septimania, in southern Gaul, was the last unconquered province of the Visigothic Kingdom. Muslim armies began to campaign in Septimania in 719. After the fall, in 720, of Narbonne, the capital of the Visigothic rump state, Umayyad armies composed of Arabs and Berbers turned north against Aquitaine. Their advance was stopped at the Battle of Toulouse in 721, but they sporadically raided the southern half of Gaul as far as Avignon and Lyon.\nA major Umayyad raid directed at Tours was defeated in the Battle of Tours in 732. After 732, the Franks asserted their authority in Aquitaine and Burgundy, but only in 759 did they manage to take the Mediterranean region of Septimania, due to Muslim neglect and local Visigothic disaffection.\nAfter the fall of the Umayyad Caliphate and the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate in 750, internal conflicts within al-Andalus, including revolts and the establishment of the Emirate of Córdoba under Abd al-Rahman I, shifted the focus of Andalusi Muslim leaders towards internal consolidation. However, sporadic military expeditions were still launched into Gaul. Some of these raids resulted in temporary Muslim settlements in remote areas, but they were not integrated into the emirate's authority and soon vanished from historical records.\nA Muslim incursion into Gaul in the ninth century resulted in the establishment of Fraxinetum, a fortress in Provence that lasted for nearly a century.\nUmayyad conquest of Septimania\nBy 716, under the pressure of the Umayyad Caliphate from the south, the Kingdom of the Visigoths had been rapidly reduced to a rump state in the province of Narbonensis (Septimania), a region which corresponds approximately to the modern Languedoc-Roussillon. In 713 the Visigoths of Septimania elected Ardo as king. He ruled from Narbonne. In 717, the Umayyads under al-Hurr ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Thaqafi crossed the Pyrenees for the first time on a reconnaissance mission. The following campaign of conquest in Septimania lasted three years. Late Muslims sources, such as Ahmad al-Maqqari, describe Musa ibn Nusayr (712–714) as leading an expedition to the Rhône at the far east of the Visigothic kingdom, but these are not reliable.\nThe next Umayyad governor, al-Samh, crossed the Pyrenees in 719 and conquered Narbonne (Arbuna to the Arabs) in that year or the following (720). According to the Chronicle of Moissac, the inhabitants of the city were slaughtered. The fall of the city ended the seven-year reign of Ardo and with it the Visigothic kingdom, but Visigothic nobles continued to hold the Septimanian cities of Carcassonne and Nîmes. Nevertheless, al-Samh established garrisons in Septimania in 721, intending to incorporate it permanently into the territories of al-Andalus.\nHowever, the Umayyad tide was temporarily halted by the large-scale Battle of Toulouse (721), when al-Samh (Zama in the Christian chronicles) was killed by Odo of Aquitaine. Despite the defeat at Toulouse, the Umayyads still controlled Narbonne and had a strong military presence in Septimania. The Umayyads were far from their core territory in Iberia and needed local support so they offered the local Gothic nobles favorable terms and some autonomy in exchange for tribute and recognition of Umayyad authority. The Visigothic resistance was fragmented and weakened after years of war and the loss of their king. For many Gothic nobles, the agreement was preferable to continued war or subjugation by the Franks or Aquitanians, who were also regional rivals. As a result, many of the Gothic nobles of the Visigothic rump state in Septimania aligned themselves with the Muslims.\nIn 725, al-Samh's successor, Anbasa ibn Suhaym al-Kalbi, moved against Gothic nobles resisting surrender. The city of Carcassonne was besieged and its Gothic ruler forced to cede half of his territory, pay tribute, and make an offensive and defensive alliance with Muslim forces. The Gothic rulers of Nîmes and the other resisting Septimanian cities also eventually fell under the sway of the Umayyads. In the 720s the savage fighting, the massacres and destruction particularly affecting the Ebro valley and Septimania unleashed a flow of refugees who mainly found shelter in southern Aquitaine across the Pyrenees, and Provence.\nSometime during this period, the Berber commander Uthman ibn Naissa (\"Munuza\") became governor of the Cerdanya (also including a large swathe of present-day Catalonia). By that time, resentment against Arab rulers was growing within the Berber troops.\nRaid into Aquitaine and Poitou\n]]\nUthman ibn Naissa's revolt\nBy 725, all of Septimania was under Umayyad rule. Uthman ibn Naissa, the Pyrenean Berber ruler of the eastern Pyrenees, detached himself from Cordova and established a principality based on a Berber power base in 731. The Berber leader allied with the Aquitanian duke Odo, who was eager to stabilize his borders, and is reported to have married Odo's daughter Lampegia. Uthman ibn Naissa went on to kill Nambaudus, the bishop of Urgell, an official acting on the orders of the Church of Toledo.\nThe new Umayyad governor in Cordova, Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi, mustered an expedition to punish the Berber commander's insubordination, surrounding and putting him to death in Cerdanya, according to the Mozarabic Chronicle, a just retribution for killing the Gothic bishop.\nUmayyad expedition over Aquitaine\nEmboldened by his success, Al-Ghafiqi attacked Uthman ibn Naissa's Aquitanian ally Duke Odo, who had just encountered Charles Martel's devastating offensive on Bourges and northern Aquitaine (731). Still managing to recruit the necessary number of soldiers, the independent Odo confronted al-Ghafiqi's forces that had broken north by the western Pyrenees, but could not hold back the Arab commander's thrust against Bordeaux. The Aquitanian leader was beaten at the Battle of the River Garonne in 732. The Umayyad force then moved north to invade Poitou in order to plunder the Basilica of Saint-Martin-de-Tours.\nBattle of Tours (732)\nOdo still found the opportunity to save his grip on Aquitaine by warning the rising Frankish commander Charles Martel of the impending danger against the Frankish sacred city of Tours. Umayyad forces were defeated in the Battle of Tours in 732, considered by many the turning point of Muslim expansion in Gaul. With the death of Odo in 735 and after putting down the Aquitanian detachment attempt led by duke Hunald, Charles Martel went on to deal with Burgundy (734, 736) and the Mediterranean south of Gaul (736, 737).\nExpansion to Provence and Charles Martel\nto Pépin le Bref, in 759, after 40 years of occupation.]]\nNevertheless, in 734 Umayyad forces (called \"Saracens\" by the Europeans at the time) under Abd el-Malik el Fihri, Abd al-Rahman's successor, received without a fight the submission of the cities of Avignon, Arles, and probably Marseille, ruled by count Maurontus. The patrician of Provence had called Andalusi forces in to protect his strongholds from the Carolingian thrust, maybe estimating his own garrisons too weak to fend off Charles Martel's well-organised, strong army made up of vassi enriched with Church lands.\nCharles faced the opposition of various regional actors. To begin with the Gothic and Gallo-Roman nobility of the region, who feared his aggressive and overbearing policy. Charles decided to ally with the Lombard King Liutprand in order to repel the Umayyads and the regional nobility of Gothic and Gallo-Roman stock. He also underwent the hostility of the dukes of Aquitaine, who jeopardized Charles' and his successor Pepin's rearguard (737, 752) during their military operations in Septimania and Provence. The dukes of Aquitaine in turn largely relied on the strength of the Basque troops, acting on a strategic alliance with the Aquitanians since mid-7th century.\nIn 737, Charles captured and reduced Avignon to rubble, in addition to destroying the Umayyad fleet. However, Charles' brother, Childebrand, failed in the siege of Narbonne. Charles attacked several other cities which had collaborated with the Umayyads, and destroyed their fortifications: Beziers, Agde, Maguelone, Montpellier, Nîmes. Before his return to northern Francia, Charles had managed to crush all opposition in Provence and Lower Rhone. Count Maurontus of Marseille fled to the Alps.\nMuslim loss of Septimania\nMuslims maintained their authority over Septimania for another 15 years, but shifted the focus of their efforts towards the internal divisions within al-Andalus, that had been caused by the collapse of the Umayyad Caliphate in 750. In 752, the newly proclaimed Frankish king Pepin, the son of Charles, launched an invasion of Septimania to take advantage of the internal troubles of the Muslims in al-Andalus and the growing disaffection of the Gothic nobility with their Muslim rulers. That year, Pepin conquered Nimes and went on to subdue most of Septimania up to the gates of Narbonne. In his quest to subdue the region, Charles met the opposition of Waiffer the Duke of Aquitaine. Waifer, aware of Pepin's expansionist ambitions, is recorded as attacking the Frankish rearguard with an army of Basques during the siege of Narbonne.\nIt was ultimately the Frankish king who managed to take Narbonne in 759, after vowing to respect Gothic law and earning the allegiance of the Gothic nobility, thus marking the end of the Muslim presence in southern Gaul. Furthermore, Pepin directed all his war effort against the Duchy of Aquitaine immediately after subduing Roussillon.\nPepin's son, Charlemagne, fulfilled the Frankish goal of extending the defensive boundaries of the empire beyond Septimania and the Pyrenees, creating a strong buffer zone  known as the Spanish March between the Frankish Empire and the Umayyad Emirate. The Spanish March would in the long run become a base, along with the Kingdom of Asturias, for the eventual Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula.\nLegacy\nArabic words were borrowed, such as tordjman (translator) which became drogoman in Provençal, and is still in use in the expression \"par le truchement de\"; charaha (to discuss), which became \"charabia\". Some place names were also derived from Arabic or in memory of past Muslim inhabitance, such as Ramatuelle and Saint-Pierre de l'Almanarre (from al-manar i.e. 'the lighthouse').\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
