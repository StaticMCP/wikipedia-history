      "text": "# Working cat\n\nA working cat, also known as a mouser, is a type of domestic cat that \"works\" for its keep by hunting vermin, such as rodents. They are commonly employed where pest control is needed, such as barns, farms, factories, warehouses, stores, restaurants, shipyards, churchyards, and private property. Types of working cats include the bodega cat, farm cat, ship's cat, and library cat. A benefit of using a working cat is that they alleviate the need for harmful pesticides. Working cats are often placed in their environment as a part of a working cats program.\nThe resident cat at the British Prime Minister's home at 10 Downing Street has been given the title Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office.\nWorking cats programs\nA working cats program is designed to place cats in safe environments where they are valued for their hunting skills as working cats. These programs are typically offered by animal shelters who will use otherwise unadoptable cats in the program as an alternative to euthanasia. The cats may not be suitable for adoption because they are feral cats or did not acclimate to living in close quarters with humans. Working cats programs usually provide cats that are spayed or neutered and fully vaccinated, and any adoption fee is often waived. In exchange for their services, the cats are to receive a place to live, food, water, and vet care.\nSee also\n* Bodega cat, inhabits a convenience store.\n* Farm cat\n* Library cat\n* Ship's cat\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://ontariospca.ca/adopt/working-cat-program/ Ontario SPCA and Humane Society - Working Cat Program]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML9jSIr8a4Y&ab_channel=OntarioSPCAandHumaneSociety Ontario SPCA's new \"working cats\" pilot program in action!]"
