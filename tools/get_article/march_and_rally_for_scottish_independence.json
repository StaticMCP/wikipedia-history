It was originally set to take place again in 2014, shortly before the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, but it was called off as \"the focus [in 2014] has got to be on persuading the many undecided voters all over Scotland, crucially in their own communities, and that will call for different types of events\".\nThe March and Rally was organised by Jeff Duncan, Allan Hendry and Anne McMillan and was part of the official Yes Scotland campaign.\n2012 March and Rally\nThe March and Rally on 22 September 2012 gathered in The Meadows before moving to Princes Street Gardens, where a crowd of between 9,000 and 10,000 people listened to speakers including First Minister Alex Salmond, comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli, lawyer Aamer Anwar, and writer Alan Bissett.\nPat Kane of Hue and Cry hosted the event and Dougie McLean was the main attraction serenading the crowd with Caledonia\n2013 March and Rally\nThe March and Rally on 21 September 2013 gathered on Edinburgh's High Street (part of the Royal Mile) before moving to Calton Hill.
