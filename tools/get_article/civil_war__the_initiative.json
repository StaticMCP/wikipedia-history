Running through a number of Marvel's then-ongoing monthly series, as well as numerous tie-in books, the story, which was initiated by an eponymous one-shot, serves as an epilogue to Marvel's \"Civil War\" storyline and as a launch point for new series such as the Mighty Avengers, New Avengers, Omega Flight, and Thunderbolts.\nThe one-shot is written by Brian Michael Bendis and Warren Ellis, with pencil art by Marc Silvestri. Centered on Iron Man, its story is divided into three segments.

The third and final segment shows a meeting between Ms. Marvel, a staunch ally of Iron Man, and Spider-Woman, one of Captain America's Secret Avengers.\nIn addition to the main story, the comic includes promotional previews for other titles linked to Civil War – Iron Man, Captain America, Mighty Avengers, Omega Flight and Avengers: The Initiative.\nList of comics\nThe following is a list of comic books that carry The Initiative banner:\n*Avengers: The Initiative #1–3\n*Black Panther (vol. 4) #26–30\n*Captain America (vol. 5) #25–30\n*Fantastic Four #544–550\n*Iron Man (vol. 4) #15–18\n*Mighty Avengers #1–6\n*Moon Knight (vol. 5) #11–13\n*Ms. Marvel (vol. 2) #13–17\n*New Avengers #28–31\n*New Warriors (vol. 4) #1–8\n*Nova (vol. 4) #2–3\n*Omega Flight #1–5\n*The Order #1–4\n*Punisher War Journal )vol. 2) #6–11\n*Sub-Mariner (vol. 2) #1–6\n*Thunderbolts #112–115\nReferences"
