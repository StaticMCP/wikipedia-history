      "text": "# Schwarzwaldmädel__disambig_1\n\n' (Black Forest Girl) is a 1917 operetta in three acts by German composer Leon Jessel. The libretto is by August Neidhart, and the operetta premiered on 25 August 1917 at the old Komische Oper Berlin. It is the most popular operetta written in Germany.\nPerformance history\n' premiered at the Komische Oper in Berlin in August 1917. The opera's touching libretto, appealing melodies, and elegant instrumentation proved immensely popular. It ran in Berlin for 900 performances, and within the next 10 years was performed approximately 6,000 times in Germany and abroad. The work is by far Leon Jessel's greatest success as an operetta composer, and it catapulted him to the height of the world of European operetta.\nWith the rise of Nazism in the late 1920s, Jessel, who had converted to Christianity in 1894 but was Jewish by birth, had his music boycotted in Germany as early as 1927. The last Nazi-era performance of Schwarzwaldmädel in Germany was in 1936, and recordings and distribution of Jessel's works were then banned outright within the entire Third Reich by the Reichsmusikkammer in 1937 through the end of World War II. Jessel died in 1942.\nNevertheless,  has retained its popularity among Germans. It was quickly revived in 1945 and 1946 and remains the most popular operetta composed in Germany. According to Andrew Lamb in 150 Years of Popular Musical Theatre, \" represented all that was best in continental operetta.\"\nRoles\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n!Voice type\n!Premiere cast,25 August 1917(Conductor: )\n|-\n| Blasius Römer, organ master of the cathedral in the fictional Black Forest village of St. Christoph\n| baritone\n| Gustav Charlé\n|-\n| Hannele, ''Römer's daughter\n| soubrette\n|\n|-\n| Bärbele, Römer's maidservant, an orphan\n| soubrette\n|\n|-\n| Jürgen, landlord of the 'Blue Ox' inn, in the village of St. Christoph\n| basso buffo\n|\n|-\n| Lorle, Jürgen's daughter, in love with Theobald\n| soprano\n|\n|-\n| Malwine von Hainau, a Berliner visiting the village of St. Christoph for the festival of St. Cecilia\n| soprano\n|\n|-\n| Hans, a Berliner fleeing from the possessive Malwine\n| tenor buffo\n|\n|-\n| Richard, Hans's best friend\n| tenor\n|\n|-\n| Old Woman Traudel, Bärbele's impoverished aunt, mocked as a \"witch\" by the village children\n| non-singing\n|\n|-\n| Schmussheim, a comical vacationer from Berlin\n| no set range\n|\n|-\n| Theobald, a village boy\n| tenor\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Musicians and country folk (chorus)\n|}\nSynopsis\ngirl, in traditional dress (Schwarzwälderin'' by Rudolf Epp, ca. 1890)]]\nThe picturesque opera takes place in a village in the Black Forest in 1815.
