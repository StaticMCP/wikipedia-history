Candi is one of two Dutch war cemeteries in Semarang, the other being Kalibanteng War Cemetery.\nThe cemetery was constructed by soldiers from the T-Brigade of the Royal Netherlands Army who came ashore in Java on 12 March 1946, during the Indonesian National Revolution. Only Dutch servicemen are buried in this cemetery, resting in more than 1,000 graves. Initially, only war dead of the revolution incurred in Central Java were buried at Candi, but they were soon joined by Dutch casualties of the preceding Pacific War.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [https://oorlogsgravenstichting.nl/begraafplaatsen/nederlands-ereveld-candi-te-semarang Candi War Cemetery] on the website of the Netherlands War Graves Foundation (OGS)\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20030428110150/http://www.ogs.nl/docs/222030_Ereveld%20Candi.pdf OGS leaflet about Candi War Cemetery]\n*  [https://issuu.com/oorlogsgraven-stichting/docs/ogs_brochure_zo_azie_eng?fr=xKAE9_zU1NQ OGS brochure about Dutch war graves in Southeast Asia]"
