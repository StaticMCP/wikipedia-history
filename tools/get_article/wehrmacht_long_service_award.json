The forty-year special class was introduced on 10 March 1939.\nRecipients of the higher-level awards wore the decoration simultaneously with one lower-level award. The manner they were worn was:\n*3rd Class with 4th Class (gold medal with silver medal)\n*2nd Class with 4th Class (silver cross with silver medal)\n*1st Class with 3rd Class (gold cross with gold medal).\nThe Long Service Award was retroactive throughout a service member's career, encompassing Reichswehr service as well as service dating during and before World War I. As such, there were a handful of forty-year awards presented, even though the Nazi era only lasted 12 years (1933–1945).\nThe awards were worn on the left chest, immediately before the medals commemorating the annexation of Austria, Sudetenland, and Memel.\nDesign\nThe awards were designed by Professor Dr Richard Klein.\nApart from their finish (gilt or silver), the third and fourth-class medals have a common obverse. Both are 30mm in diameter and bear the German eagle clutching a swastika, surrounded by the words Treue Dienste in der Wehrmacht (Loyal service in the armed forces). The reverse shows the number of years of service, either '4' or '12', surrounded by a wreath.Likewise, the design of the first and second class crosses are similar. Both bear the German eagle on the obverse center, with the years of service, '18' or '25', on the reverse. The first class is gilt and 38mm wide – the second silver and 35mm. The forty-year award is identical to the first class, with the addition of a gilt oakleaf cluster to the ribbon.\nWehrmacht Long Service Awards were among Nazi era awards reauthorised for wear in 1957, redesigned to remove the now-banned swastika symbol.\nRibbons\nThe medal used the cornflower blue ribbon of the pre-1918 . The recipient's arm of service was indicated by an emblem on the ribbon: a spread eagle and swastika for the army and Kriegsmarine, and a flying eagle and swastika for the Luftwaffe, the emblem corresponding in color with the metal of the award.\n{|align=center class=wikitable width=100%\n!colspan=6 align=\"center\"| Ribbon bar \"Long Service Award of the Wehrmacht\"\n|- align=center\n!

The Nazi Party and German Police had similar service awards. The Nazi Party Long Service Award was given in grades of ten, fifteen, and twenty-five years. The Police Long Service Award was given in grades of eight, eighteen, twenty-five, and forty years (though the last class was never awarded).\nIn the early 1960s, the West German Bundeswehr considered creating a new long service award in line with previous Imperial and Wehrmacht models. However, it never made it past the prototype phase. In 1980, the Badge of Honour of the Bundeswehr was established, which, along with meritorious achievement, also recognizes long service in various grades.\nSee also\n*Orders, decorations, and medals of Nazi Germany\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
