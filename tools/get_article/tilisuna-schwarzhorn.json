It has elevation , with a long ridge from north to south and wide scarps east and west. Besides the main summit, there is a second summit called Kleines Schwarzhorn. Both summits are separated by the col Fürkele. The alpine club hut Tilisunahütte (2208&nbsp;m) is located near the Tilisuna-Schwarzhorn.\nThe first ascensionists of Tilisuna-Schwarzhorn were land surveyors in 1853. Nowadays there are two common routes to the summit:\n* Easiest route: From south starting at Tilisunahütte via the saddle Schwarze Scharte in 45 to 75 minutes; some parts UIAA grade II, mostly grade I. This route was opened by J. S. Douglass and Chr. Zudrell in 1883.\n* North ridge: From upper station of cable car Grabs via Alpe Alpila and Schwarzhornsattel (2166&nbsp;m) in 2–2½ hours; UIAA grade II. This route was opened by A. Remann, G. Gaßner and B. Hemmerle in 1886.\nNaturfilm Schwarzhorn Cinedoku Vorarlberg.jpg|The two summits of the Tilisuna-Schwarzhorn\nTilisunahütte Sonnenaufgang 1.JPG|Alpine club hut Tilisunahütte in front of the Tilisuna-Schwarzhorn\nReferences"
