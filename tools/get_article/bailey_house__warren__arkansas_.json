The  story Victorian house is one of the most elaborately styled houses in Bradley County.  It was built around the turn of the 20th century by James Monroe Bailey, an American Civil War veteran and a local druggist.  The house he built originally occupied (along with all of its outbuildings) an entire city block near the Bradley County Courthouse; the estate has since been reduced to just the house.  Its dominant features are an octagonal cupola and a two-story porch with delicate turned balusters and bargeboard decoration.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Bradley County, Arkansas\nReferences"
