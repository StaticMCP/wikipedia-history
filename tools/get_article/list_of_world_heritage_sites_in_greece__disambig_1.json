Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Greece ratified the convention on 17 July 1981, making its natural and cultural sites eligible for inclusion on the list.\nGreece has 20 properties in Greece inscribed on the World Heritage List, 18 of which are cultural sites and two (Meteora and Mount Athos) are mixed, listed for both their natural and cultural significance. The first site added to the list was the Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae, in 1986. The next two sites listed were the Archeological site of Delphi and the Acropolis of Athens, in the following year. Five sites were added in 1988, two in 1989 and 1990 each, one in 1992, one in 1996, two in 1999, and one in 2007. The most recent site added was the Minoan Palatial Centres, in 2025. In addition, there are 12 sites on the tentative list, all of which were nominated in 2014.\n__TOC__\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae\n|\n| Peloponnese\n| 1986\n| 392; i, ii, iii (cultural)\n| The temple, dedicated to Apollo Epicurius, was built in the 5th century BCE in the mountains of Arcadia. It is considered by UNESCO to be one of the best preserved monuments of classical antiquity. It is the earliest monument that features all three classical orders, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. After falling out of use, the temple was forgotten for nearly 1700 years. It was rediscovered in the 18th century, attracting the attention of scholars and artists.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Archeological site of Delphi\n|\n| Central Greece\n| 1987\n| 393; i, ii, iii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| Delphi, located at the foot of Mount Parnassus, was the site of the Temple of Apollo, a Panhellenic sanctuary, and in Greek view the \"navel of the world\" (the Omphalos).

Originally a fortification, it gradually developed into a religious sanctuary, associated with the cult of the goddess Athena. In the 5th century BCE, following their victory over the Persians, the Athenians under Pericles constructed a large number of monuments including the Parthenon, the Erechtheion, the Propylaia, and the Temple of Athena Nike.
