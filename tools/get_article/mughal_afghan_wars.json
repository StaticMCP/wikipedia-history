The Afghans struggled to protect their independence and resisted Mughal expansion while the Mughals worked to enlarge their empire and take control of the area.\nBackground\nThe Afghan-Mughal Wars had their roots in the complex political and military history of the Indian subcontinent in the 16th century. The Mughal Empire, under the leadership of Emperor Babur, had established its rule in northern India\nthe Delhi Sultanate in 1526. However, the Mughals faced constant threats from various regional powers, including the Afghans, who controlled parts of present-day Afghanistan.\nThe Afghans, particularly the Pashtuns, were a tribal people who had a long history of resistance to foreign rule. They had previously fought against the Persian Safavids and the Uzbek Shaybanids, and were now opposed to Mughal expansionism. The Afghans had also suffered a major defeat against the Mughals in the Battle of Panipat in 1526 and had been forced to pay tribute to the Mughals.\nHowever, the Mughal Empire was not immune to internal strife and conflict. In the 16th century, the Mughal Emperor Akbar faced rebellions from various regional governors and religious sects. This provided an opportunity for the Afghans to launch raids into India and destabilize Mughal rule.\nHistory and phases\nFirst Phase\nBetween Babur's fledgling Mughal Empire and the Delhi Sultanate's Lodi dynasty, there was a significant conflict known as the first phase Mughal-Afghan War that started in 1526. At the time, a substantial portion of northern India had been governed by the Delhi Sultanate, a strong Muslim monarchy. However, internal conflicts and disagreements among the nobles made it weak and exposed to outside dangers.\nThe founder of the Mughal Empire and a descendant of Genghis Khan, Babur saw a chance to extend his realm and launched an invasion of India. On April 21, 1526, he led his army across the Hindu Kush mountain passes and overcame the Lodi dynasty's armies at the first Battle of Panipat.\nThe Mughal army's superior firepower and discipline, as well as its access to cutting-edge weapons like muskets and artillery, rendered the Lodi forces helpless against them. In the conflict, the Lodi Sultan Ibrahim Lodi was killed in action, and Babur took control of Delhi and parts of northern India.\nBabur continues his military campaign by raiding western Punjab in 1520 and subduing Lahore in 1524.\nLater in 1529, the usage of Musket barrages used by Babur with good effect, at the battle on the Ghagara river against the remnants of the Afghan resistance.\nSecond Phase\nThe second phase of the Mughal–Afghan Wars composed of Mughal and Surid conflicts. The Sur Empire was a short-lived Afghan Empire that ruled over India from 1540 to 1556. The Sur Empire was founded by Sher Shah Suri, who had risen to power after defeating the Mughal Emperor Humayun in the Battle of Chausa in 1539 and again in the Battle of Kanauj in 1540.\nThird Phase\nThe first major conflict between the Sur Empire and the Mughal Empire occurred during the reign of Akbar, the third Mughal emperor. In 1555, Akbar launched an invasion of the Sur Empire and defeated the Sur forces in the Battle of Sirhind.\nThe Sur-Mughal conflict would continue for several years, with both sides experiencing victories and defeats. However, the Mughals were ultimately able to prevail due to their superior military technology, organization, and resources. In 1556, Akbar's forces defeated the Sur army in the Battle of Machhiwara, and the Sur Empire collapsed soon after.\nThe Sur-Mughal conflict was a significant chapter in the history of northern India, as it marked the transition from the Sur Empire to the Mughal Empire and the consolidation of Mughal power over much of the subcontinent.\nFourth Phase\nDuring the reign of Emperor Akbar, the Mughal Empire launched several military campaigns against the Karrani dynasty in an effort to expand its territory and assert its authority over Bengal. In 1575, the Mughals under the command of the governor of Bihar, Todar Mal, marched into Bengal and engaged the Karrani forces in a series of battles.\nThe Karranis, under the leadership of their king Daud Khan Karrani, put up a fierce fight against the Mughal forces and were able to cause significant casualties in the Mughal army. However, in the end, the Mughals were able to defeat the Karranis and capture their capital, Gaur.\nThere are also rebellions from the Roshani movement, as in 1570, a deviant Sufism movement which preaching Wahdat al-Wujud grow in Peshawar, which founded by their charismatic leader Pir Roshan. The Roshani movement played an important part in politically in resisting the increasing influence of Mughals in Afghan region as they gained popular supports from the Afghanis. Pir Roshan spent his life in  conflict with  the Mughals until his death in 1572. His  successors continued  his  struggle  against the Mughals, and even captured Ghazni city at one point, prompting emperor Jahangir to deal with the rebellion more seriously, which after constant battles against the sect, the movement eventually  weakened  and  ended.\nThe Karrani-Mughal conflicts were not limited to Bengal, as the Karranis and other Afghan groups also resisted Mughal rule in other parts of the empire, such as the northwest frontier region in 1612 At the time of the Mughal invasion of the Greater Sylhet region, Bayazid Karrani II, a member of the Karrani dynasty of Bengal, was among the most powerful leaders of the Eastern Afghani Confederates, independently ruling its eastern half with his capital in Pratapgarh. continuing the struggle against Mughal expansion of the previous generation under Isa Khan. Bayazid was among those who had been granted lands as part of the maintenance of this alliance by the latter's son, Musa Khan. Bayazid formed alliance with Khwaja Usman from Usmangarh (and Taraf) and Anwar Khan of Baniachong. It was in light of this close alliance that Islam Khan I, the Mughal governor of Bengal,  dispatched an imperial force against Bayazid so as to prevent the latter from providing aid. Ghiyas Khan was appointed to lead the expedition, though due to his diffidence, command was later entrusted to Shaikh Kamal. He was assisted by officers such as Mubariz Khan, Tuqmaq Khan, Mirak Bahadur Jalair and Mir Abdur Razzaq Shirazi. Mir Ali Beg was made the bakhshi (paymaster) of this Mughal command. The host consisted of four thousand matchlock-men, one thousand picked cavalry of Islam Khan I, one hundred imperial war elephants and the fleet of Musa Khan and his confederates, who had surrendered to the Mughals the previous year. Bayazid's side consisted of the forces sworn to him and his brother Yaqub, as well as several hill-tribe chieftains (likely Kukis). The host consisted of four thousand matchlock-men, one thousand picked cavalry of Islam Khan I, one hundred imperial war elephants and the fleet of Musa Khan and his confederates, who had surrendered to the Mughals the previous year. The intense conflict rages between the alliance with the Mughal force,  until Khwaja Usman slain in one of clashes. The death of Khwaja Usman greatly demoralized the Afghan, prompting Bayazid to surrender. Soon after, Anwar Khan also submitted, thus bringing Sylhet for the first time under the control of the Mughal empire.\nFifth Phase\nDuring the reign of Akbar King, Akbar was willing to invade one of the Yousufzai country \"Afghania\". Akbar laid a siege to invade the Yousafzai country but Mughals army was failed. The siege took more than two months. The Akbar than sent one of his most intelligent and closest Minister whose name was Raja Birbal. But the Yousufzai tribesmen defeated the Mughal forces led by Birbal and Shujat Khan. This was the biggest Disaster to Mughal Empire in the reign of Akbar. According to Mughal historian Khafi Khan, more than 40,000 Mughals soldiers and officers were killed by Yousufzai Afghans while Abd al-Qadir Badayuni claims more than 8,000 Mughal soldiers and officers were killed at the Karakar and Malandari Pass. It was considered one of the greatest military losses to Akbar and in Mughal History. Due to this disaster, Akbar fell into grief and did not eat or drink for two days.\nAkbar learned about the disaster two days later and an army under Rajah Todar Mal set off on 19 February to exact retribution against the Yusufzais, killing a large number of them and selling many survivors to Turan and Persia, as \"the countries of Swat, Bajaur and Buner were cleansed of evildoers.\"\nSixth Phase\nA territorial dispute over the Punjab region, which was strategically significant due to its location on the border between the two empires, started the conflict between the Durrani Empire and the Mughal Empire. Ahmad Shah Durrani and his forces invaded India in 1748 and 1752 and captured Lahore from Mughals.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
