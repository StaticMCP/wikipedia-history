It exposed Brunei's complete weakness and would eventually cause the fall of the Bruneian Sultanate.\nPrelude\nIn July 1774, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien I had promised the island of Labuan to Great Britain in exchange for protection against the Pirates. However, the offer came to nothing, with Brunei instead fighting the Sulu Sultanate in order to weaken it in the Twenty Years' War.\nBy the 1800s, several foreign powers had started to come to Southeast Asia, starting with the Portuguese conquest of Malacca in 1511 and the Dutch conquests of Java and Southern Borneo made possible by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. In this context, Labuan became more important to the foreign powers as they began to venture into Borneo from Labuan.\nThe expansion of other western powers in the region caused Britain to realise the need for a permanent harbour in northwestern Borneo to prevent further foreign interference. The British worried that the Sultan might seek the assistance of other foreign powers who, at that time, were active in Southeast Asia, such as the Americans. Nevertheless, Labuan was considered a safe shelter, strategically situated to protect British interests in the region, especially the trade route with China. With the assistance of James Brooke, Britain now sought to take over Labuan.\nArmies\nThe British though never deployed any infantry foot soldiers, not including the Sarawakian forces, they did deploy squadron of from six to nine ships and white officers from the British Army commanded the forces of Sarawak. Relying local volunteers and the armies of Brooke aligned chiefs. But nonetheless were way more modernised than the Bruneians and Marudu armies.\nBrunei, in contrast, were less modern than their British adversaries but were not as technologically and organisation lacking as the Chinese in the First Opium War. Their forces did not depend on bows and arrows but rather old but effective traditional cannons and already had acquired muskets before the war. With their only issue being their armies were smaller than the Sarawakians and British and their navy being completely outdated, relying on traditional boats which were outmatched by the British steamships.\nDespite Syarif Osman making alliances with other Syarifs in Sabah. Marudu collapsed as they were disorganised, easily frightened without Osman and later were resorting to fight in guerilla warfare having less manpower and British firepower supremacy lead to Marudu's demise and Syarif Osman's fall.\nWar\nIn 1843, an open conflict between Brooke and the Sultan ended in the latter's defeat. The Sultan recognised Sarawak's independence.\nFrom 1843, Brooke actively suppressed piracy on the coasts of western and northern Borneo together with Captain Henry Keppel in . After talks with Serib Sahib, who controlled the Sadong River, Keppel and Brooke's native forces attacked three rivers in the Saribas; the Padi, Paku and Rimbas. After which, Keppel was called away on orders, but returned in August 1844 along with EIC steamer Phlegethon. By this time Serib Sahib had abandoned the Sadong and retreated to Patusan. Keppel and Brooke's native forces once again overwhelmed all opposition in Patusan and the Undop, but were ambushed by the Sea Dayak on the river Skrang at Karangan Peris, resulting in the death of Datu Patinggi Ali. Shortly after this punitive expedition Brooke heard that Mahkota, the former administrator of the Kuching area, had taken shelter at the Lingga, and managed to capture him and send him back to Brunei.\nAccording to the account of Captain Henry Keppel, on 4 June 1843, Brooke and Keppel organised a war expedition to attack the Iban Dayak of Saribas to take the land along the coast.\nOKP Dana Bayang's longhouse at Nanga Padeh was the strongest and most important, defended by two forts and a barrier of fallen trees that blocked the Batang Saribas River from being easily entered by their enemies. Brooke's forces took and burnt this longhouse on 11 June 1843. Dana Bayang, who was already old, had delegated the fighting to his three sons: Nanang, Luyoh, and Aji.\nBrooke's forces proceeded up the Saribas to Karangan Pinggai and on 14 June attacked the fort of Linggir Mali Lebu, a chief mentored by Dana Bayang. They then attacked the Sungai Rimbas river forts at Sungai Tawai belonging to chiefs Rekaya Antau \"Linggang Neneri\" and Rekaya Gun \"Mangku Bumi\".\nThe defeated chiefs in Saribas and Linggi from Skrang went onboard Brooke's ship to sign the peace treaty of Saribas. However, the treaty forced them to stop headhunting ( in the Iban language), and they refused to sign it.\nOn 19 August 1844 at Karangan Peris in the Skrang area, Rentap first fought against Brooke's forces. He ambushed the advance trackers of Brooke's reconnoitring troop with a formidable array of war boats and thousands of men on either bank of the river, placed to effectively use spears and blowpipes. With boats and bamboo rafts blocking their retreat, the troop's white leader Mr Stewart, a Malay chief Datuk Patinggi Ali and 30 of his men were killed, and 56 others were wounded. This was the first time the Brooke officers saw how devastating the fighting and war by the Iban were.\nOn 26 August, a Skrang chief arrived, deputed by the other chiefs of Skrang to assure Captain Keppel of their submission and desire for peace.\nBrooke hoped to reform the administration of the Sultanate and establish a pro-British government through Hashim and his brother Pengiran Badruddin. In October 1844, Brooke with the aid of Captain Sir Edward Belcher in  and the EIC steamer Phlegethon returned the two brothers to Brunei. The vessels anchored at the Sultan's audience chamber, demanding Pengiran Yusof's position as Bendahara be replaced by Hashim and asking the Sultan to pledge to suppress piracy in his dominions, as well as to transfer the ownership of the island of Labuan to the British (although the British government had not asked for this). The status of Brooke as a Rajah and consul for the British at the time also remained controversial in the United Kingdom as he was not recognised by the British government to represent the British subjects. Indirectly, Brooke had become involved in an internal dynastic dispute of Brunei.\nin August 1845, Rear-Admiral Thomas Cochrane who previously arrived at Brunei in July, reappeared with a handful ships to release two Lascar seamen who were believed to be hidden there. Badruddin accused Yusof of being involved in the slave trade due to his close relations with a notable pirate leader Sharif Usman in Marudu Bay and the Sultanate of Sulu. Denying the allegation, Yusof refused to attend a meeting with Cochrane, and escaped after being threatened with force by Cochrane before regaining his own force in Brunei's capital. Cochrane then sailed away to Marudu Bay in pursuit of Usman, while Yusof was defeated by Badruddin. Hashim managed to establish a rightful position in Brunei Town to become the next sultan after successfully defeating the pirates led by Yusof who fled to Kimanis in northern Borneo, where he was executed. Yusof was the favourite noble to the Sultan and with Hashim's victory, this upset the chances of the son of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II becoming the next leader. Mahkota, after his capture in Sarawak in 1844 became the Sultan's adviser in Yusof's absence. He prevailed on the Sultan to order the execution of Hashim, whose presence had become unwelcome to the royal family, especially due to his close ties with Brooke that were favourable to English policy. Beside that, an adventurer}} named Haji Saman, who was connected to Yusof, played upon the Sultan's fear of Hashim taking his throne.\nBy the order of the Sultan, Hashim and his brother Badruddin together with their family were assassinated in 1846. One of Badruddin's slaves, Japar, survived the attack and intercepted , which brought him to Sarawak to inform Brooke. Enraged by the news, Brooke organised an expedition to avenge Hashim's death with the aid of Cochrane from the Royal Navy with Phlegethon. On 6 July 1846, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II complained through a letter about the discourtesy of HMS Hazard and invited Cochrane to ascend the capital of Brunei with two boats.\nHEICS Phlegethon, HMS Spiteful and  then moved up to the river on 8 July where they were fired on from every position with slight damage. Mahkota and the Sultan retreated upriver while most of the population fled upon their arrival at Brunei's capital, leaving the brother of the Sultan's son, Pengiran Muhammad, who was badly wounded and Pengiran Mumin, an opponent of the Sultan's son who despised the decision of his royal family to be involved in conflict with the British. The British destroyed the town forts and invited the population to return with no harm to be done to them while the Sultan remained hiding in the jungle. Another expedition was sent to the interior but failed to find the Sultan. Brooke remained in Brunei with Captain Rodney Mundy and  along with the Phlegethon and HMS Hazard while the main expedition continued their mission to suppress piracy in northern Borneo.\nUpon finding that Haji Saman was living in Membakut and that he was involved in the plotting that caused Hashim's death, HEICS Phlegethon and HMS Iris departed there destroyed Haji Saman's house and captured the town of Membakut although Saman managed to escape. Brooke returned again to Brunei and finally managed to induce the Sultan to return to the capital where the Sultan wrote a letter of apology to Queen Victoria for the killings of Hashim, his brother and their family. Through his confession, the Sultan recognised Brooke's authority over Sarawak and mining rights throughout the territory without requiring him to pay any tribute as well granting the island of Labuan to the British. Brooke departed Brunei and left Mumin in charge together with Mundy to keep the Sultan in line until the British government made a final decision to acquire the island. Following the ratification agreement of the transfer of Labuan to the British, the Sultan also agreed to allow British forces to suppress all piracy along the coast of Borneo.\nIt was on 24 December 1846 when Captain Mundy, commanding , took possession of Labuan, \"in the Name of Her Majesty Victoria Queen of Great Britain and Ireland under the Direction of His Excellency Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane, C.B., Commander-in-Chief\".\nIn 27 May 1847, the Sultan signed the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with the British, officially ceding Labuan and establishing a British foothold in the north of Borneo to counterbalance the Dutch presence.\nAftermath\nThe loss of Labuan was a big blow to Brunei, as Labuan was considered as its only gateway through the sea to the outside world. It was after the loss of Labuan that Brunei began to lose most of its territories, mainly to the Brooke Regime in Sarawak and British North Borneo Chartered Company in North Borneo. However thanks to the assassination of Muda Hashim by Pengiran Muhammad Yusof, it sabotaged any chances of the United Kingdom and James Brooke of putting a Pro-British sultan in the Bruneian throne as the Muda Hashim line was destroyed by the last ruling sultan, Sultan Hashim Jalilul.\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
