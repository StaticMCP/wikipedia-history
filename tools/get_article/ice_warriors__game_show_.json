It had a similar format to Gladiators, except that the games were played on an ice rink installed at the Manchester Arena. The show's sponsor was 7 Up.\nAlthough the series won a Bronze Rose for Light Entertainment at the 1998 Rose d'Or Festival, it was not successful with critics and viewers, receiving bad reviews and poor ratings. The show came to an end after one series.\nFormat\nIn the narrative of the show, the Ice Master (Philip Ferrentinos) would set challenges for teams of ice skaters and athletes representing different UK cities and award \"credits\" for those who performed best. Each episode was a competition between two teams, the one with the most credits advancing to a further round. In each challenge skaters competed against one of the eponymous Ice Warriors, who would attempt to stop them completing the challenge.\nIce Warriors\nThe show attempted to create backstory and lore for the characters drawn from elements of fantasy fiction. Some of those who appeared as the warriors were professional winter athletes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Alias !! Real name !!
