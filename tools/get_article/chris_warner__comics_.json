He worked extensively on their mid-1990s line of Comics' Greatest World and Dark Horse Heroes.

He is listed as the creator of Barb Wire and the developer of the setting of Steel Harbor for these lines. His work on this line includes writing and penciling the mini-series Barb Wire: Ace of Spades (#1–4), penciling issues #10–12 of X, being the image illustrator (i.e., the visual creator) of characters like Ghost and is given creator credit on [https://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/93-151/Comics-Greatest-World-Wolf-Gang Wolf Gang], Pit Bulls and Motorhead. He also worked on Will to Power (issues #4–6 as writer & #10–12 as penciler) and the second volume of Ghost, on which he acted as writer and later co-writer for the majority of that title's run.
