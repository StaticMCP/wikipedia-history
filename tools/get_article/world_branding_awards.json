The World Branding Forum, based in London, organises the awards.\nThere are three tiers of awards. A Global Award is presented to international brands, a Regional Award is presented to brands that are the top in several countries in a particular geographic region, and a National Award is presented to brands from participating countries. The awards trophy is on display at the Museum of Brands, Packaging & Advertising in London. The award's Brand of the Year logo is a registered trademark.\nThe 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 award ceremonies took place at Kensington Palace in London.\nIn 2017, the first Animalis Edition, an award ceremony dedicated to pet and animal branding, was held in the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. It is the world's largest animal and pet branding awards ceremony. The second Animalis Edition was held at the same venue in 2019.\nIn 2018, the Americas Edition of the awards, dedicated to the Americas and the Caribbean, was held at The Plaza on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\nNominations, judging, and scoring\nNominations for the awards can be made by brands' owners, custodians, agencies, or the public. There are three tiers of awards: a Global Award is presented to international brands that have a presence in ten or more countries, on three or more continents, limited to the top 100 global brands in any particular year; a Regional Award is presented to brands that are the top in several countries in a particular geographic region; and a National Award, which is presented to the top brands in participating countries at the awards. Brands that are global winners are not awarded again on a national level.\nWinners of the awards are judged through three streams: brand valuation, consumer market research, and public online voting. There are also other awards for individuals voted for by the World Branding Forum Advisory Council. Winners go through an assessment process to determine the level of work put in by a brand for their branding activities. The level of trust that the brands' customers and the public have for the brand is also taken into account.\nTrophy\nin London]]\nThe award trophies are made in Stratford-upon-Avon.
