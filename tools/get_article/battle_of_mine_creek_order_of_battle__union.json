      "text": "# Battle of Mine Creek order of battle: Union\n\nOf the brigades listed below, only Philips' and Benteen's brigades, and a small part of Sanborn's brigade from the Union Army of the Border fought in the Battle of Mine Creek of the American Civil War. The Confederate order of battle is listed separately.  The entire organization of the Army of the Border is shown.\nCommand disputes\nBy order of MG James G. Blunt (General Field Orders No. 2) the militia regiments of William H. M. Fishbeck, Brigadier General of Militia, were placed under the command of Charles W. Blair, Colonel of Volunteers; Fishbeck was infuriated that his command had been subordinated to a volunteer officer.  Because Kansas law stated that militia should be kept under the command of militia officers, Fishbeck disregarded Blunt's order.  Blunt had Fishbeck arrested and held until released by order of MG Samuel Curtis.  Upon his release, Fishbeck resumed command of the Kansas Militia regiments, with orders to obey directives that came from MG Blunt.  This rather cumbersome arrangement had BG Fishbeck in direct command of the militia units attached to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, and Col Charles Blair in overall command of the brigade.  Howard N. Monnett describes the arrangement as a \"brigade within a brigade\".  Blair and Fishbeck led the militia into action at Westport (accompanied onto the field by MG George W. Dietzler), and then in the subsequent pursuit of Price until MG Curtis ordered the militia to return home.\nAbbreviations used\nMilitary rank\n* MG = Major General\n* BG = Brigadier General\n* Col = Colonel\n* Ltc = Lieutenant Colonel\n* Maj = Major\n* Cpt = Captain\n* Lt = 1st Lieutenant\n* 2Lt = 2nd Lieutenant\nArmy of the Border\nMG Samuel Ryan Curtis\nEscort:\n* 2nd Kansas Cavalry (battalion): Maj Henry Hopkins\n* Company G, 11th Kansas Cavalry: Cpt C.
