The event took place on January 4, 2024, at the Tokyo Dome, in Tokyo, Japan. It was the 33rd January 4 Tokyo Dome Show and the 18th promoted under the Wrestle Kingdom name. Wrestlers from NJPW partner promotions All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and Pro Wrestling Noah (Noah) were featured at the event. This was the first Wrestle Kingdom event to feature Hiroshi Tanahashi as the new president of New Japan Pro-Wrestling. This was the first Wrestle Kingdom since Wrestle Kingdom 13 to have a one-night format, as the previous Wrestle Kingdoms had been held across multiple nights in a row.\nEleven matches were contested at the event, with one taking place on the pre-show. In the main event, G1 Climax winner Tetsuya Naito defeated Sanada to win the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship. In other prominent matches, Kazuchika Okada defeated Bryan Danielson, David Finlay defeated Will Ospreay and Jon Moxley to become the inaugural IWGP Global Heavyweight Champion and Hiroshi Tanahashi defeated Zack Sabre Jr. to win the NJPW World Television Championship.\nThe event was also notable for appearances by former WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler, now known using his real name Nic Nemeth, and his brother Ryan Nemeth who were in the front row.\nProduction\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|Kevin Kelly\n|-\n|Chris Charlton\n|-\n|Gino Gambino\n|-\n|Rocky Romero\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Japanese Commentators\n|Shinpei Nogami\n|-\n|Milano Collection A.T.\n|-\n|Katsuhiko Kanazawa\n|-\n|Kazuyoshi Sakai\n|-\n|Togi Makabe (Guest)\n|-\n|Masahiro Chono (Guest)\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Ring announcers\n|Hidekazu Tanaka\n|-\n|Kimihiko Ozaki\n|-\n|Makoto Abe\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Referees\n|Norio Honaga\n|-\n|Kenta Sato\n|-\n|Yuya Sakamoto\n|-\n|Marty Asami\n|-\n|Red Shoes Unno\n|-\n|Tiger Hattori\n|-\n|}\nBackground\nThe January 4 Tokyo Dome Show is NJPW's biggest annual event and has been called \"the largest professional wrestling show in the world outside of the United States\" and the \"Japanese equivalent to the Super Bowl\". The show has been promoted under the Wrestle Kingdom name since 2007.\nWrestle Kingdom 18 was announced on July 5, 2023 at Independence Day.\nStorylines\nWrestle Kingdom 18 featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nOn August 19 2023, Tetsuya Naito won the G1 Climax, thus earning an IWGP World Heavyweight Championship match. On October 9, 2023 at Destruction in Ryōgoku, Sanada successfully defended the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship against Evil in a Lumberjack match, officially setting up himself and Naito for the world title as the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 18.\nOn June 25, 2023, at the AEW and NJPW partnered event, Forbidden Door, Bryan Danielson defeated Kazuchika Okada in the main event, despite Danielson suffering a broken arm midway through the match. On the October 25, 2023 episode of AEW Dynamite, Okada teamed with Orange Cassidy in a losing effort against Danielson and Claudio Castagnoli; towards the end of the match, Danielson suffered a broken orbital bone. On November 4, 2023 at Power Struggle, Okada, Hiroshi Tanahashi, and Tomohiro Ishii successfully defended the NEVER Openweight Six-Man Tag Team Championship against TMDK (Zack Sabre Jr., Mikey Nicholls and Shane Haste). After the match, the lights went off and Danielson appeared on the titantron to challenge Okada to a rematch at Wrestle Kingdom, which Okada accepted, making the rematch official.\nAt the same Power Struggle event, Hiromu Takahashi successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Taiji Ishimori. After the match, Takahashi challenged El Desperado for the title, which Desperado accepted. The match was then made official for Wrestle Kingdom 18.\nAlso at Power Struggle, Will Ospreay defeated Shota Umino in the main event to retain the IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship (though referred to by Ospreay as the IWGP United Kingdom Heavyweight Championship with his own custom belt). After showing respect to Umino, Ospreay called out Umino's former mentor, AEW's Jon Moxley, and both men were attacked from behind by Bullet Club leader David Finlay, who took a mallet and smashed both the U.S. and Ospreay's custom UK belt. It was then announced that Ospreay, Moxley, and Finlay would fight a three-way match at Wrestle Kingdom 18. At a press conference on November 6, 2023, NJPW chairman Naoki Sugabayashi announced that a new championship would replace the U.S./U.K. championship. On December 11, 2023, Sugabayashi revealed the name of the new championship as the IWGP Global Heavyweight Championship with the winner becoming the inaugural champion.\nFrom October 21 2023 until November 2 2023, the 2023 Super Junior Tag League tournament matches took place during the Road to Power Struggle Tour. Catch 2/2 (Francesco Akira and TJP) defeated Intergalactic Jet Setters (Kushida and Kevin Knight) in the semi-finals to advanced to the finals while House of Torture (Sho and Yoshinobu Kanemaru) defeated El DespeWato (El Desperado and Master Wato) to also advance. Both teams finished the tournament with a record of six wins and three losses, setting up the finals of the tournament. In the finals Catch 2/2 defeated House of Torture to win the Super Junior Tag League, thus earning an IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship match against Bullet Club War Dogs (Drilla Moloney and Clark Connors) at Wrestle Kingdom 18.\nAt Fighting Spirit Unleashed, Shingo Takagi defeated Tama Tonga to win the NEVER Openweight Championship. At Lonestar Shootout, Takagi defeated Trent Beretta to retain the NEVER Openweight title. After the match, Takagi called out anyone to challenge him for the title. Tonga then came out and said that he wanted a rematch for the title. Takagi accepted and said that the match will take place at Wrestle Kingdom.\nAfter successfully defending his NJPW World Television Championship against Mike Bailey at Lonestar Shootout, Zack Sabre Jr. called out Hiroshi Tanahashi and challenged him to a match at Wrestle Kingdom. NJPW then announced that Sabre Jr. will defend his title against Tanahashi at Wrestle Kingdom 18.\nIn the 2023 edition of the World Tag League, IWGP Tag Team Champions Bishamon (Hirooki Goto and Yoshi-Hashi) won in Block A, while Strong Openweight Tag Team Champions Guerrillas of Destiny (Hikuleo and El Phantasmo) won in Block B, leading them to face each other in the finals. In the finals on December 10, Bishamon won for a third year in a row, allowing them to use their champion's privilege to choose their opponents for Wrestle Kingdom. Bishamon challenged the G.O.D. to a rematch for both sets of titles.\nResults\nNew Japan Pro-Wrestling|url=https://www.njpw1972.com/tornament/155710?showCards=1|access-date=2023-11-04|website=New Japan Pro-Wrestling}}\n|times  =\n|match1 = Great-O-Khan, Taiji Ishimori, Toru Yano and Yoh won\n|stip1  = New Japan Ranbo to determine who will challenge for the Provisional KOPW 2024 Championship at New Year Dash!!\n|time1  = 32:40\n|note1  = pre\n|match2 = Catch 2/2 (TJP and Francesco Akira) defeated Bullet Club War Dogs (Drilla Moloney and Clark Connors) (c) by pinfall\n|stip2  = Tag team match for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship\n|time2  = 9:38\n|match3 = Hiroshi Tanahashi defeated Zack Sabre Jr. (c) by pinfall\n|stip3  = Singles match for the NJPW World Television Championship\n|time3  = 8:53\n|match4 = Yuya Uemura defeated Yota Tsuji by pinfall\n|stip4  = Singles match\n|time4  = 10:57\n|match5 = House of Torture (Evil and Ren Narita) defeated Shota Umino and Kaito Kiyomiya by pinfall\n|stip5 = Tag team match\n|time5  = 7:06\n|match6 = Tama Tonga defeated Shingo Takagi (c) by pinfall\n|stip6  = Singles match for the NEVER Openweight Championship\n|time6  = 12:56\n|match7 = Guerrillas of Destiny (El Phantasmo and Hikuleo) (Strong Openweight) defeated Bishamon (Hirooki Goto and Yoshi-Hashi) (IWGP) by pinfall\n|stip7  = Winners Takes All tag team match for the IWGP Tag Team Championship and Strong Openweight Tag Team Championship\n|time7  = 8:56\n|match8 = El Desperado defeated Hiromu Takahashi (c) by pinfall\n|stip8  = Singles match for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship\n|time8  = 14:19\n|match9 = David Finlay defeated Will Ospreay and Jon Moxley by pinfall\n|stip9  = Three-way match for the inaugural IWGP Global Heavyweight Championship\n|time9  = 22:15\n|match10 = Kazuchika Okada defeated Bryan Danielson by pinfall\n|stip10  = Singles match\n|time10  = 23:30\n|match11 = Tetsuya Naito defeated Sanada (c) by pinfall\n|stip11  = Singles match for the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship\n|time11  = 25:43\n}}\nNotes\nSee also\n*2024 in professional wrestling\n*List of NJPW pay-per-view events\n*Professional wrestling at the Tokyo Dome\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.wrestlekingdom.jp/en/ Official website]"
