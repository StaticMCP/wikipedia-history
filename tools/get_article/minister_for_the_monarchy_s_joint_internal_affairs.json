Following this, a number of institutions from the Ministry of Finance was transferred to the ministry, including the Postal Service, and the Colonial Central Board. From the Ministry of the Interior, the new ministry took over cases such as citizenship cases.\nThe ministry was abolished by Royal proclamation of 1 August 1858, and all its resources were placed under Ministry of Finance.\nList of ministers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! rowspan=2| Name(born-died)\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2| Political party\n! rowspan=2| Government\n! rowspan=2|\n|-\n!
