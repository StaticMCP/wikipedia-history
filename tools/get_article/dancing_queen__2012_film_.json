They burned up the screen in the 2005 hit All for Love, with Uhm playing a stuck-up divorced doctor and Hwang playing a foul-mouthed detective; the chemistry between the two boosted ticket sales back then. They again starred together in Five Senses of Eros.\nReception\nThe film is lauded for reflecting social issues, as The Korea Times in its review said \"What makes the film interesting is that it opts to examine the psychology behind the precarious situation, when a couple's individual interest is at odds with the other\". While The Hollywood Reporter said \"Dancing Queen is polished entertainment with a subtle message, anchored by an engaging (if physically awkward) performance by Uhm...and a suitably pulsating empowerment anthem\".\nAccording to data provided by Korean Film Council (KOFIC) it was the second most-watched film in South Korea in the first quarter of 2012, with a total of 4 million admissions. It ranked first and grossed  in its first week of release and grossed a total of  after seven weeks of screening.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
