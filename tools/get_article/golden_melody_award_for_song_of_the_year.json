The Song of the Year award is one of the most prestigious categories at the awards presented annually since the 1st Golden Melody Awards in 1990. The award was presented for additional years until being discontinued in 1997, and was then revived in 2006. It is awarded to a single or for a track from an album, and goes to the performing artist for that song.\nRecipients\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Performing
