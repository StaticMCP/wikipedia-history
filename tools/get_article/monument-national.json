With a capacity of over 1,600 seats, the venue was erected between 1891 and  and was originally the cultural centre of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society.\nThe building was designed by Maurice Perrault, Albert Mesnard, and Joseph Venne in the Renaissance Revival style and utilizes a steel frame—a building technique that was innovative for its time.\nYiddish theatre\nThe first performance of a Yiddish play was held there in what is now the theatre's Ludger-Duvernay room in the winter of 1896. The Monument-National was a key cultural landmark in Montreal's historic Jewish quarter, and it continued to host productions from touring and local Yiddish theatre companies until the 1940s.\nRenovations and current status\nThe theatre was declared a historic monument by the Ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec in 1976 and a National Historic Site in 1985.\nA major restoration project of the theatre was completed in June 1993 in time for the theatre's centennial celebration. The 1,620-seat theatre has been owned by the National Theatre School of Canada since 1971, and it is the venue used for its productions.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://ent-nts.ca/en/monument-national-history History of the Monument-National]"
