Promoter Fritz Von Erich held two \"Wrestling Star Wars\" events, one in March and one in August as well as a special \"Christmas Star Wars\" on December 25 of that year. The driving storyline behind both the second and third Star Wars show of 1982 was Von Erich's son Kerry Von Erich's quest to defeat Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, a quest that was ultimately unsuccessful due to the Fabulous Freebirds turning on the Von Erich family, starting the most well known storyline in WCCW as the Von Erichs and the Freebirds fought for years following the December Christmas Star Wars.\nWrestling Star Wars (March)\n| venue=The Convention Center\n| city=Ft.

Some of the matches on the show were taped and later shown on television as part of WCCW's weekly shows. The focal point of the show was promoter Fritz Von Erich's son Kerry Von Erich challenging Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. The fifth and the eight match of the night were both shown on WCCW television programs on December 27, 1982 and the main event match between Von Erich and Flair was the focus of the WCCW television show on December 28, 1982. These episodes were later made available as part of the WWE Network. One of the undercard matches was a six-man tag team match to determine the first ever holders of the WCCW Six-Man Tag Team Championship as the team of the Fabulous Freebirds (Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts) were slated to take on the team of Tom Steele Mike and Ben Sharpe representing Canada in the tournament. Prior to the match Michael Hayes announced that due to bad winter weather Buddy Roberts was not in the building. Following that announcement David Von Erich came to the ring and offered to team with the Freebirds. Von Erich and the Freebirds won the match and the championship, after which Von Erich relinquished his part of the championship to Buddy Roberts.\n|match6=Kevin Von Erich (c) defeated King Kong Bundy by disqualification\n|stip6=Singles match for the NWA American Heavyweight Championship\n|time6=07:30\n|match7=Ric Flair (c) defeated Kerry Von Erich\n|stip7=No Disqualification Steel Cage match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship\n|time7=18:43\n|match8=Ken Mantel defeated the Spoiler, Checkmate, Frank Dusek, Ben Sharpe, Tom Steele, King Kong Bundy, \"Wild\" Bill Irwin, Mike Sharpe, Bugsy McGraw, Al Madril, Jose Lothario, David Von Erich, Brian Adias, and Magic Dragon.\n|stip8=$10,000 on a pole battle royal\n|time8=11:06\n}}\n;Battle Royal order of elimination\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=50%\n!#\n!Eliminated\n!Way of elimination\n!Reference\n|-\n| || David Von Erich || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n| || King Kong Bundy || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n| || Ben Sharpe  || Pinned ||\n|-\n| || Jose Lothario || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n| || The Checkmate || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n| || Frank Dusek || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n| || The Spoiler || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n| || Bill Irwing || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n| || Bugsy McGraw || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n|10 || Magic Dragon || Pinned ||\n|-\n|11 || Bob Steel || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n|12 || Al Madrill || Over the top rope ||\n|-\n|13 || Brian Adias, Johnny Mantell and Mike Sharpe || Survivors ||\n|}\nReferences"
