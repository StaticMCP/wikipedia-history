He currently holds several directorial positions at non-governmental organizations and consults with the UN Development Programme. He has been a visiting professor at the Universities of Torino, University of Geneva, Paris Dauphine, Sciences Po Caen, National University of Colombia, Kazakh National University and lectured at the University of St. Gallen, University of Edinburgh, University of Buckingham, and is the author of multiple books and articles on sustainability and ecological economics.\nBackground\nShmelev has worked as a Senior Researcher at the Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford (2008–2009), and as a Senior Visiting Research Associate at the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford. The main focus of his work is on the theory of ecological economics, macroeconomic assessments of sustainability, sustainable cities, business models and investing, corporate sustainability, and other environmental issues. He has been a visiting professor in ecological economics and lectured at various universities.\nAs the founder and CEO of Environment Europe Limited, and founder and CEO of Environment Europe Foundation Stichting, he has started an executive education programme in Ecological Economics in Oxford. Run under the supervision of Environment Europe, it has been attended by participants from numerous countries.\nWorks\nGreen economy\nStanislav Edward Shmelev edited the widely used 'Green Economy Reader'. This was responsible for bringing  together works by leading ecological economists and sustainability experts.

The book officially launched in 2012.\nMacro sustainability Assessment\nStanislav Edward Shmelev developed a novel method of sustainability assessment that uses the potential of multi-criteria decision aid tools (MCDA) and applies them to the dynamic sets of sustainability criteria. This research developed from a series of lectures he gave at European universities on sustainability in Russia, where social and environmental aspects of economic development have been neglected. This methodology is particularly important for defining sustainability, assessing the progress towards sustainability of a given society or system. Several applied cases have been published now:\n*Shmelev S. (2017), ed.

The report has been published in Shmelev (2012).\nIn 2009, the United Nations Environment Programme invited Shmelev to be a reviewer for The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) Report\nIn 2018, Stanislav Shmelev published a photography album entitled 'Ecosystems', which hoped to show the futility of measuring ecological worth with monetary value.\nIn 2021, Stanislav Shmelev was selected as one of the world's 120 top contemporary artists and exhibited at the Arte Laguna Prize exhibition in Venice.\nSustainable energy\nThe innovative paper published in Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews adopts a multi-criteria perspective and extends the UK decarbonisation scenarios by dimensions that are often overlooked, namely, employment, land use, water use and diversity of the energy mix *\nIn 2009, Shmelev was interviewed for the European Union Euronews Channel on the issues of renewable energy and sustainable development\nSustainable waste management\n*\nSustainable cities\nThe issue of sustainable cities has been dealt with by Shmelev in the context of the interdisciplinary linkages in the development of large cities. He co-organized two international workshops on sustainable cities at the University of Oxford and Saint Petersburg State University.\nThe first workshop resulted in a book:\n*Shmeleva I. A. and Shmelev S. E. (Eds) (2007) Sustainable Urban Development: Interdisciplinary Approach, St Petersburg State University, 265 pp.\nThe second workshop produced a special issue of the International Journal of Sustainable Development entirely devoted to sustainable cities:\nThe issues of multidimensional benchmarking for megacities have been analysed in detail in the recent book, Green Economy Reader: Lectures in Ecological Economics and Sustainability\nNew peer-reviewed publications exploring the subject of smart and sustainable cities include:\n*Shmelev.
