The Colonel is called back into service as a Military Governor to enforce the Reconstruction Acts against the former Confederates of the State. The cavalrymen assigned to the Colonel are all military criminals who use the opportunity to loot and terrorise the people for their own benefit. Roy attempts to convince the Colonel his men are acting unfairly. The Colonel's response is to remove the right of firearm ownership from the Texans with his men confiscating their weapons. The Colonel's men murder the Colonel and further attempt to tyrannise the population until Roy is able to get the population's firearms back.\nCast\n*Roy Rogers as Roy\n*Lynne Roberts as Ellen Denbigh\n*George 'Gabby' Hayes as Gabby Whitaker\n*Wade Boteler as Colonel Denbigh\n*Arthur Loft as Captain Jeffries\n*Lane Chandler as Jim Crawford\n*Tom London as Union sergeant\n*Charles R.
