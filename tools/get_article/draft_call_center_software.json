These solutions are used in customer service, technical support, telemarketing, sales, and business process outsourcing (BPO). Modern call center software may be deployed on-premises or as a cloud-based service and often integrates with customer relationship management (CRM) systems.\nHistory\nThe origins of call center software trace back to early telephony systems including Private Branch Exchange (PBX) and Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) technologies. Over time, developments like computer-telephony integration (CTI) allowed tighter linkages between call systems and business applications. The 2000s saw wider adoption of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and cloud computing for hosted call center platforms. In the 2020s, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, omnichannel communications, and cloud-based contact center as a service (CCaaS) became increasingly important.\nFeatures\nCommon features of call center software include:\n* Automatic Call Distribution (ACD): Routes incoming calls to agents based on availability, skills, or other rules.\n* Interactive Voice Response (IVR): Enables automated menus and self-service before a human agent is involved.\n* Call recording and monitoring: Used for compliance, training, and quality assurance.\n* Analytics and reporting: Tracks KPIs like call volume, wait time, abandonment rates, and agent performance.\n* Dialers: Including predictive or power dialers for outbound calls.\n* CRM integration: Links call center operations with customer data for better service continuity.\n* Workforce management: Scheduling and forecasting of agent workloads to meet service level goals.\nTypes\nSoftware may be categorized by deployment model:\n* On-premises: installed & managed within a company’s own infrastructure.\n* Cloud-based / SaaS: hosted by a provider, accessed over the internet.\n* Hybrid: mixtures of both models.\nIndustry applications\nCall center software is used in various sectors including:\n* Customer service / BPO\n* Sales and telemarketing\n* Healthcare (e.g., patient appointment scheduling, support)\n* Financial services (e.g., account inquiries, fraud detection)\n* Retail and e-commerce (order tracking, returns, customer support)\n* AI-driven systems for chatbots and self-service support.\nMarket overview\nThe global contact center software market was valued at USD 43.39 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 50.67 billion in 2025. Other forecasts suggest the market could reach USD 342.54 billion by 2034, growing at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 24%. Industry analysts highlight cloud adoption, omnichannel communication, and artificial intelligence as the primary drivers of this growth.\nSee also\n* Contact center\n* VoIP\n* Cloud telephony\n* Customer relationship management\n* Business process outsourcing\nReferences"
