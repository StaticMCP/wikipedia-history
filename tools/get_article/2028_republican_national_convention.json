It is scheduled to be held at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.\nFollowing the victory of Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, the Republican Party is controlling the White House from 2025 to 2029, and therefore, the Republican National Convention will be expected to be held sometime after the Democratic National Convention due to the modern convention of the incumbent presidential party holding its convention later than the opposition party's convention.\nSite selection\nUnder the leadership of then-Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee changed their rules in the summer of 2022 to allow for the party to select their 2028 convention location even before the 2024 presidential election had taken place. By January 2023, the Republican National Committee was already taking preliminary steps in its site selection, including visits to some potential host cities.\nCities that courted the 2028 convention included Houston, Texas (the past host of the 1928 Democratic and 1992 Republican conventions); Miami, Florida (whose metro area was host to the 1968 Republican, 1972 Republican, and 1972 Democratic conventions); and Nashville, Tennessee. Another city that received consideration was Jacksonville, Florida, (which was briefly planned to host the 2020 Republican National Convention, but ultimately did not).\nOn August 25, 2023, the Republican National Committee chose Houston as the site of their 2028 convention. This is an uncommonly early selection of a convention site. The general sessions of the convention will take place at the city's Toyota Center arena.\nPreparations\nAs this was the first time that a presidential convention host city had been selected in advance of the preceding convention, Houston had the unprecedented luxury of watching the 2024 conventions while preparing for their own 2028 convention. A delegation from Houston attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to gain a better understanding.\nReferences"
