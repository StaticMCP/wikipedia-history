These invasions were part of the broader Mongol invasions and conquests and marked the first major encounter of European peoples with the Mongol armies.\nBackground\nThe Alans descended from the Sarmatians, who settled along the shores of the Sea of Azov and Caspian Sea in the 2nd millennium BCE. Sarmatians and Scythians were considered by ancient Greeks as ethnically related, speaking similar languages. In the North Caucasus, Sarmatian tribes became known as Alans. Following the arrival of the Huns in the 2nd century CE, many Alans migrated westward, while some remained in the Caucasus valleys under the protection of mountain terrain, forming the Alanian kingdom or Alania. Alania was one of the strongest political entities in the region and partially Christianized by the 10th century.\nMedieval Arab and Persian sources describe Alania as a densely populated region with strong fortifications and an organized army. The Alanian capital, Maghas, and other mountain fortresses such as Bab-al-Lan were heavily defended by aristocratic cavalry and feudal levies. Alania maintained alliances with the Byzantine Empire and later with the Kingdom of Georgia, reinforced through dynastic marriages, including that of David Soslan, a prince of Alania, to Queen Tamar of Georgia.\nThe Alanian army relied on a combination of heavily armored cavalry drawn from noble families and infantry drawn from allied tribes and local militias. Estimates suggest a total fighting force of up to 30,000, including a core of 3,000 elite shock cavalry. Alanian heavy cavalry was highly regarded by contemporary observers, including Chinese, Mongol, Iberian, and Rus’ chronicles.\nBy the late 12th and early 13th centuries, Alania experienced political fragmentation. The central authority of the Alanian kings had weakened due to feudal infighting, while nomadic Kipchaks expanded into the Alanian plains. Feudal decentralization and internal disputes eroded economic cohesion, leaving Alania vulnerable to external invasions. Christianity, introduced in the 10th century, coexisted with pagan traditions, but weakening central power allowed the revival of tribal and ancestral cults. The Alans maintained alliances with neighboring states, particularly the Kingdom of Georgia, where dynastic marriages reinforced political and military ties.\nMongol invasion (1220–1223)\nIn 1220, following the conquest of Khwarezm, Genghis Khan dispatched a 30,000-strong expeditionary corps under Jebe and Subutai to conduct reconnaissance and military operations in the South Caucasus and North Caucasus regions. The Mongols advanced through Shirvan and surrounding territories, encountering numerous peoples, including Lezgins and Alans.\nFirst Alanian encounter (1222)\nAccording to Ibn al-Athir, the Alans formed an alliance with local Kipchak groups to resist the Mongols. The first battle was indecisive. The Mongols then employed diplomatic manipulation, offering the Kipchaks gifts and appealing to ethnic and religious distinctions. The Kipchaks accepted the bribes and withdrew, leaving the Alans isolated. The Mongols then decisively defeated the Alans, looting, killing, and taking captives. The main Kipchak leaders, Yuri Konchakovich and Danilo Kobyakovich, were later killed while attempting to flee.\nMongol raids in Crimea (1222–1223)\nThe Mongols extended their campaign into the Crimean Peninsula, targeting the city of Sudak (Sugdya), a major trading center of the Kipchaks. Contemporary Greek sources, including a Sinaxary note dated 27 January 1223, confirm the Mongols’ presence near Sudak, though the city itself may not have been fully captured. These raids demonstrated Mongol mobility and strategic reconnaissance over a vast area.\nAlanian society and resistance\nAlania was a densely settled kingdom, with hundreds of villages in mountain valleys and plains. The king’s aristocratic families provided the core of heavily armored cavalry, while vassals and allied tribes supplied infantry. Infantry formations, such as the Vainakh mazhak wedge formation, supplemented the Alanian cavalry. Alanian warriors were highly disciplined, skilled with lances, and renowned for their courage, earning respect from contemporary observers, including the Mongols, and influencing Mongol cavalry tactics.\nDespite defeats in open battles, the Alans retreated into the highlands, where the mountainous terrain provided a defensive advantage. Alanian feudal lords continued to exercise control over parts of the North Caucasus independently. The Alanian nobility, including the aldar family of Bibilta, retained some autonomy by aligning with the Georgian crown, serving as eristavs (regional governors) under Georgian authority.\nChristianity persisted in parts of Alania, particularly in eastern regions under Georgian influence, while pagan traditions revived in more isolated areas. Historical sources, including Bishop Theodore of Alania’s Alanian Letter (1223–1226) and the observations of Dominican monk Julian, describe a population that was a mixture of Christians and pagans, with respect for Christian symbols, such as the cross, persisting even amid feudal conflicts.\nMongol invasion (1237–1240) and Siege of Maghas\nIn 1235, at the Kurlutai, a decision was made on a Mongol campaign with the aim of conquering Bulgaria, Rus' and As (Alania) led by Batu. The second major Mongol invasion of Alania began in 1236–1237 as part of the Golden Horde’s westward expansion. Mongol forces initially attacked northern Alania, capturing the plains and subjugating Kipchak allies, before advancing into the North Caucasus in 1239–1240.\nThe Alanian capital Maghas and other fortresses, including Bab-al-Lan, were heavily fortified. Maghas withstood a prolonged siege of approximately 3 months before finally falling. Many Alanian nobles and defenders were killed, and the city was systematically destroyed. Following the fall of Maghas, the remaining Alans in the mountains retreated into inaccessible valleys, where they continued guerrilla resistance against Mongol control.\nThe capture of Maghas marked the effective collapse of centralized Alanian authority. Remaining Alanian polities fragmented further, and many inhabitants fled to remote mountainous areas, Georgian-controlled regions, or even farther west. Mongol control gradually extended over the North Caucasus, incorporating Alania into the Jochi Ulus of the Golden Horde, though some highland regions maintained de facto independence.\nSubsequent Mongol campaigns (1240s)\nAfter Maghas, Mongol expeditions continued in the 1240s to consolidate control and incorporate Alans into the Mongol military system. Alanian heavy cavalry became part of Mongol forces in campaigns across Eurasia, including service under Batu Khan in Europe and later under Hulagu Khan in the Middle East. Isolated highland Alans continued resisting Mongol authority for decades, requiring permanent military garrisons.\nGuillaume de Rubruck names the Zikhs, Alans and Lezgi among the peoples unconquered by the Mongols in 1253.\nThe last large-scale uprising of the Alans against occupation was the Dedyakov Uprising. The revolt was most likely caused by the increasing tax burden in the Golden Horde. Russian chronicles report a major uprising in the North Caucasus in 1278 and the siege of the Alan city of Dedyakov by the Mongols, who were joined by the retinues of Rus' princes. The rebellion was so extensive that forces from across the Golden Horde were gathered, led personally by Khan Mengu-Timur. In February 1278, Dedyakov was burned down.\nCultural and societal impact\nThe Mongol invasions devastated Alania politically and demographically, but did not erase its cultural identity. Christianity persisted in some regions, particularly in areas under Georgian influence, while ancestral pagan and tribal cults revived in more remote mountainous areas. Famine, depopulation of the plains, and migration to the highlands were common consequences of the invasions.\nDespite these hardships, the Alans continued to engage in trade, notably with Genoese merchants in the Karachay region. Alanian folklore preserved the memory of these conflicts: the Nart sagas recount battles against invaders, reflecting societal trauma, heroism, and the significance of economic resources such as salt. Additionally, Alans influenced European cavalry traditions, with their elite units serving as palace guards and shock cavalry in Mongol campaigns. According to some sources, the number of Alan soldiers in Mongolia amounted to several tens of thousands. Alans also lived in capital of Mongol Empire, Karakorum. The Asud clan is the descendants of the Alans in Mongolia. However, over the course of 700 years of living in Mongolia, they lost the Alanic language.\nSee also\n*Mongol invasions of Georgia\n*Mongol invasion of Circassia\n*Mongol invasions of Durdzuketi\n*Battle of Khankala\n*Golden Horde\nReferences\n* Ibn al-Athir.
