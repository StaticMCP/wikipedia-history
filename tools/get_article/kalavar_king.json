Suresh starring Nikhil Siddharth and Shweta Basu Prasad. The film was released on 26 February 2010. The film was a box office failure, but was still remade in Tamil as Eththan (2011) by the same director and in Kannada as Melkote Manja (2017).\nPlot\nRajesh (Nikhil Siddharth) is a not-so-innocent village boy who wants to make it big in life without having to work hard and in the process ends up borrows money from every person in the village. In a parallel track, we have Shruthi (Shweta Prasad) who is being harassed by the local goon Narender (Ajay) who also happens to be her brother-in-law. Rajesh & Shruthi meet and a couple of misunderstandings lead to Rajesh turning over a new leaf. He then transforms into a successful loan recovery agent and decides to rescue Shruthi from the clutches of her brother-in-law. Eventually, they realize their love for each other before an insipid climax leads to a happy ending.\nCast\nProduction\nThe film's title was revealed on 2 November 2009.
