The Queen sends her half-sister, Princess Tanis, to the outlaw city of Douras to find her real father so he can save the kingdom.\nMeanwhile, servant girl Kara who shares the same father as Tanis but with a different mother, Xia, discovers that Xia is really a vampire and begins hunting Tanis.

Production itself officially began with scriptwriting in November 2007, followed by principal photography in California the following year.  According to Pyun, actors considered for the film included Yancy Butler, Kari Wuhrer, Mark Dacascos, Val Kilmer, Steven Seagal, Olivier Gruner, and Christopher Lambert.\nRelease\nThe film's North American premiere was at the Fright Night Film Fest of July 2010 in Louisville, Kentucky. The film was released in the United States by Lionsgate in January 2012.\nReception\nBob Calhoun of Salon.com wrote that Sorbo \"sinks to sad new lows\" after starring in the film.\nScott Weinberg of Twitch Film called it \"one of the worst films I've ever seen\". Weinberg said that it is \"the sort of movie that makes you reconsider Uwe Boll's status as the reigning king of movie crap\".\neFilm critic Jack Sommersby rated the film one star and said: \"What's infuriating is that Pyun has oodles of talent and can be a first-rate director when he allows himself to be guided by ratiocination rather than egregious grandeur. The Sword and the Sorcerer didn't exactly have the sturdiest of scripts, which resulted in a lumpy middle section, but it was all of a piece, a consistent visionfor my money, far better than John Boorman's clunky Excalibur from the year before\". Nick Hartel of DVD Talk rated it 0/5 stars and also called Pyun worse than Boll, whom he called merely lazy rather than incompetent like Pyun.\nScott Pyle of Fulvue Drive-In.com writes: \"Empire tries very hard to follow the happy-go-lucky spirit of its predecessor, and it manages to succeed at this on some level, but it lacks the innocence and pure fun of Sorcerer\". David Johnson of DVD Verdict wrote that the film's only redeeming quality is that it is \"laughably short\".\nGiving the film one star, Jason Rugart said: \"I fear it will end up on my worst of list next December ... Pyun has an excellent eye for the visually intriguing and his love for the craft palpable. That's the thing that makes Tales such a frustrating viewing experience is that elements of a good movie or at least a watchable one are swimming about in this murky haphazard concoction\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
