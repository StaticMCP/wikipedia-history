Historically, it has been credited to Wallace's 1638 landing at Haulover. Now, however, that story is deemed apocryphal, with settlement rather deemed a drawn out process of a pirate haven turned seasonal logging camp turned permanent settlement.xx English buccaneers are thought to have habitually sought refuge inside the reef beginning in the 1630s, xx. Initially, though, they are thought to have restricted themselves to piracy, with logwood cutting on the Old River an occasional afterthought.xx Seasonal logging camps are thought to have slowly morphed into permanent ones during the 1660s, resulting finally in an established settlement of Baymen.xx\nHostilities\nAnglo-Mosquito\nEnglish hostilities xx.\nMaya\nMaya hostilities xx.\nSpanish\nSpanish hostilities against the Maya xx.\nHostile action against the Baymen is thought to have been first taken in xx. Permanent settlement then 'provoke[d] Spanish raids almost annually' in the eighteenth century, with five particularly notable incidents resulting in the complete evacuation of Honduras.\nEntrenchment\nExpansion\nHonduras as a pirate have is thought to have been (peripheral ?) xx Honduras as a logging camp and settlement, too, was likely peripheral to its more bustling Campeachy (especially) and Catoche (to a lesser extent) counterparts, until their capture in 1716 and xx..}} The sudden influx of displaced loggers resulted in an even deeper penetration of Old River by xx and logwood cutting on xx and xx Rivers by xx, leading to the importation of Jamaican slaves by xx (and their majority by xx), and logwood exhaustion by xx (and prompt switch to mahogany cutting)..}}\nFormalisation\nFrom the mid-18th century, British authorities are deemed to have 'relied more on treaties that conceded Spanish sovereignty while permitting logging rights, which the loggers immediately violated.'\nxx\nIn 1826, Mexico signed a treaty which 'effectively denied Mexican sovereignty over Belize.'\nPiracy\nSlavery\nLogging\nDemographics\nadd two per century? xx\nEconomy\nSociety\nGovernment\nLegacy\nIn culture\nA number of myths and legends about this period survive in popular culture. Restall counts among these the Wallace landing, Honduran slavery's being relatively tolerable, the territory's being devoid of Maya residents upon English arrival, and the Battle of St George's Caye's being pivotal. xx\nTerritorial disputes have also survived to the modern era (most notably with Guatemala, but also with Honduras).\nIn scholarship\nSeventeenth and eighteenth century records of or on Belize are especially scarce.. Both Spanish and British. Though Restall notes 'extensive' Spanish and 'massive' British holdings for 18th century .}} This paucity has resulted in a myriad open questions and myths, for instance, regarding Honduras's founding, the etymology of Belize, and so on.. Restall noted –.}}}} A further difficulty for the study of this period is ideological bias, due to long-standing territorial disputes, seen particularly in some Belizean, British, Guatemalan, and Spanish histories.\nThe earliest substantial work of or on this period was Henderson's 1809 Account.
