Part of the Ace Combat series, the game was first released outside of Japan by the newly formed Namco Bandai Games. Set in the Ace Combat series' fictional universe of Strangereal, the game's story takes place before the events of most other entries in the series, and follows the actions of \"Galm Team\", a mercenary fighter squadron led by the player character \"Cipher\", as they fight to repel an enemy invasion during the titular Belkan War, a World War II-esque conflict that was mentioned but not elaborated upon in previous entries.\nAce Combat Zero, like the rest of the Ace Combat series, has a more arcade-like format compared to other flight simulation games. Its mechanics are a mixture of features from its predecessors, Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies and Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War, with the addition of a unique reputation system that affects the player's progression and how the story is told.\nThe game received mixed but generally positive reception on release, with praise for its plot, graphics, and refined game mechanics compared to its predecessors, but criticism of its lack of innovation and melodramatic storytelling.\n| CVG = 8/10\n| GSpot = 7.9/10\n| EuroG = 6/10\n| Fam = 35/40\n| IGN = 8.8/10\n| award1 = Platinum Hall of Fame\n| award1Pub = Famitsu\n}}\nThe game received positive reviews. It holds a 75/100 score on Metacritic. As of January 2008, it has shipped 792,000 copies worldwide.\nIGN's Juan Castro graded the game at 8.8/10, stating that Namco took a chance in slowly evolving the series, and that it offers \"slight modifications\" in the engine. He also noted the story as being different from other console flight games and praised the cooperative mode.\nComputer and Video Games lauded the game's release date as a refresher from the multiple games of different genres that came out at the time. He noted the good graphical presentations and the sheer difficulty provided by the aces.\nEurogamer's Rob Fahey, however, said the game's \"incremental\" changes confuse players with what changed between Zero and Unsung War.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.acecombat.jp/ace-zero/index.htm Official website]"
