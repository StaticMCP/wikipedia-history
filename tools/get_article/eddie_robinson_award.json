The award was established by The Sports Network, since merged into Stats Perform, in 1987 and is voted upon by the division's sports information directors and selected sports writers.  The award is named for Eddie Robinson, the College Football Hall of Fame coach, who retired in 1997 after 56 years at Grambling State University.\nAlong with the Walter Payton Award and Buck Buchanan Award, it is presented the night before the annual NCAA Division I Football Championship.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Year !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Winner !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| School\n|-\n| 1987 ||  || Holy Cross\n|-\n| 1988 ||  || Lafayette\n|-\n| 1989 ||  || Georgia Southern\n|-\n| 1990 ||  || UCF\n|-\n| 1991 ||  || Nevada\n|-\n| 1992 ||  || The Citadel\n|-\n| 1993 ||  || Boston University\n|-\n| 1994 ||  || Youngstown State\n|-\n| 1995 ||  ||\n|-\n| 1996 ||  || Nicholls State\n|-\n| 1997 ||  || Villanova\n|-\n| 1998 ||  || Georgia Southern\n|-\n| 1999 ||  || James Madison\n|-\n| 2000 ||  || Montana\n|-\n| 2001 ||  || Lehigh\n|-\n| 2002 ||  || McNeese State\n|-\n| 2003 ||  || Wofford\n|-\n| 2004 ||  || Southern Illinois\n|-\n| 2005 ||  || New Hampshire\n|-\n| 2006 ||  || Appalachian State\n|-\n| 2007 ||  || Northern Iowa\n|-\n| 2008 ||  (2)|| James Madison\n|-\n| 2009 ||  || Prairie View A&M\n|-\n| 2010 ||  || Southeast Missouri State\n|-\n| 2011 ||  || Towson\n|-\n| 2012 ||  || North Dakota State\n|-\n| 2013 ||  (2)|| North Dakota State\n|-\n| 2014 ||  (2) || New Hampshire\n|-\n| 2015 ||  || Coastal Carolina\n|-\n| 2016 ||  || Sam Houston State\n|-\n| 2017 ||  || Austin Peay\n|-\n| 2018 ||  || UC Davis\n|-\n| 2019 || Troy Taylor || Sacramento State\n|-\n| 2020 || Scott Wachenheim || VMI\n|-\n| 2021 || Deion Sanders || Jackson State\n|-\n| 2022 || John Stiegelmeier || South Dakota State\n|-\n| 2023 || Jimmy Rogers || South Dakota State\n|-\n| 2024 || Brent Vigen || Montana State\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110404041344/http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=cfoot2%2Fmisc%2Frobinson_history.htm Eddie Robinson Award] - Past winners from The Sports Network"
