It helped found the First East Turkestan Republic. It was anti-Chinese, anti-Chinese Muslim, and anti-Communist. The leader of Karakash gold miners Ismail Khan Khoja, the Khotan Emir Muhammad Amin Bughra, his brothers Abdullah Bughra, Nur Ahmad Jan Bughra, and Sabit Damulla Abdulbaki joined the committee. It had originally 300 members and 50 rifles. On February 20, 1933, it set up a provisional Khotan government with Sabit as prime minister and Muhammad Amin Bughra as head of the armed forces. It favored the establishment of an Islamic theocracy.\nSee also\n* List of Islamic political parties\n* First East Turkestan Republic\n* Second East Turkestan Republic\n* Young Kashgar Party\nReferences"
