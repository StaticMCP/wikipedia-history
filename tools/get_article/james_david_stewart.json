Stewart won the vote and took his seat in the provincial legislative assembly.\nIn 1921 he was elected leader of the Conservative Party and led the party to victory in the 1923 election but his government was defeated in the 1927 election due to Stewart's opposition to total prohibition of alcohol.\nHe remained party leader and defeated the Liberal government in the 1931 election thanks, in part, to the difficulty all incumbent governments had in dealing with the Great Depression.\nStewart took on several cabinet positions himself and also intensively lobbied the federal government for relief so the province could deal with the economic hardships Prince Edward Islanders were suffering during the Depression. He obtained a larger federal subsidy for the island but the workload had a toll on Stewart and he died in office in 1933 at the age of 59.\nReferences"
