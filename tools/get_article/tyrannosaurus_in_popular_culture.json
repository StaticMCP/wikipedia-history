Knight mural at the Field Museum in Chicago, 1928]]\nTyrannosaurus rex is unique among dinosaurs in its place in modern culture; paleontologist Robert Bakker has called it \"the most popular dinosaur among people of all ages, all cultures, and all nationalities\". Paleontologists Mark Norell and Lowell Dingus have likewise called it \"the most famous dinosaur of all times.\" Paleoartist Gregory S. Paul has called it \"the'' theropod. [...] This is the public's favorite dinosaur [...]  Even the formations it is found in have fantastic names like Hell Creek and Lance.\" Other paleontologists agree with that and note that whenever a museum erects a new skeleton or bring in an animatronic model, visitor numbers go up. \"Jurassic Park and King Kong would not have been the same without it.\"  In the public mind, T. rex sets the standard of what a dinosaur should be. Science writer Riley Black similarly states, \"In all of prehistory, there is no animal that commands our attention quite like Tyrannosaurus rex, the king of the tyrant lizards. Since the time this dinosaur was officially named in 1905, the enormous carnivore has stood as the ultimate dinosaur.\"\nTyrannosaurus was first discovered by paleontologist Barnum Brown in the badlands of Hell Creek, Montana, in 1902 and has since been frequently represented in film and on television, in literature, on the Internet and in many kinds of games. Brown himself, despite having discovered many other prehistoric animals for the American Museum of Natural History before and after, always referred to Tyrannosaurus rex as \"my favorite child\". In Brown's own words, Tyrannosaurus rex was indeed \"king of the period and monarch of its race... He is now the dominant figure in the Cretaceous Hall to awe and inspire young boys when they grow up.\"\nGeneral impact\nOn finding Tyrannosaurus, Barnum Brown wrote to Henry Fairfield Osborn, his employer and the President of the American Museum of Natural History, \"Quarry No. 1 contains the [...] bones of a large Carnivorous Dinosaur, not described by Marsh. [...] I have never seen anything like it from the Cretaceous.\" On realizing that the find was unlike anything ever found before, Osborn, according to Robert Bakker, \"sat down to construct a name that expressed the position of Mr. Rex in the ecosystem, this apex of carnivory. The name has to be evocative, it has to be beautiful, it has to be lyrical. You hear it once you remember it. [...] Tyrant. Lizard. King. Beautiful, short, you hear it once you remember it and it can be abbreviated. T. rex.\"\nOsborn and his Museum of Natural History had for years been in competition with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and its famous Diplodocus skeleton, \"Dippy\" and had wanted something even greater for his own museum. With Brown's discovery of \"the monster,\" Osborn's museum had its prize. He stated in 1905,\nTyrannosaurus gained widespread public attention on December 30, 1905, when the New York Times hailed T. rex as \"the most formidable fighting animal of which there is any record whatever,\" the \"king of all kings in the domain of animal life,\" \"the absolute warlord of the earth,\" and a \"royal man-eater of the jungle.\" In 1906, Tyrannosaurus was dubbed the \"prize fighter of antiquity\" and the \"Last of the Great Reptiles and the King of Them All.\"\nIn 1927, Charles R. Knight painted a mural incorporating Tyrannosaurus facing a Triceratops in the Field Museum of Natural History, establishing the two dinosaurs as enemies in popular thought; paleontologist Phil Currie cites this mural as one of his inspirations to study dinosaurs. Bakker said of the imagined rivalry between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops'', \"No matchup between predator and prey has ever been more dramatic. It's somehow fitting that those two massive antagonists lived out their co-evolutionary belligerence through the very last days of the very last epoch of the Age of Dinosaurs.\"\nSince then, popular culture has consistently depicted Tyrannosaurs as \"King of the Dinosaurs,\" analogous to the lion's depiction as \"King of Beasts.\"\nAccording to paleontologist and museum curator Mark Norell, Tyrannosaurus rex \"continues to be a subject of fascination, a popular icon, and probably the first dinosaur name imprinted in the minds of children globally. Besides all this, it is the inspiration for budding paleontologists worldwide.\"\nFilm appearances\n, featuring Agathaumas, Tyrannosaurus and Pteranodon]]\nTyrannosaurus rex has played a major role in many films, starting in 1918 with The Ghost of Slumber Mountain'', written and directed by stop motion special effects pioneer Willis O'Brien.  The Ghost of Slumber Mountain is also, and most likely, the first film showing Tyrannosaurus facing Triceratops.\n(1918)]]\nGhost'' was the first of O'Brien's works to feature the dinosaur and he next used it again in 1925, with the classic adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel The Lost World. Tyrannosaurus fossils were not so famous at the time of the publication of the novel (1912), and the only main villain dinosaur in the book was Allosaurus, with no appearance of Tyrannosaurus, but this 1925 film featured Tyrannosaurus anyway, for a more dramatic and spectacular effect. For his part, Bakker commented that \"Willis O'Brien was a scholarly man, anatomically literate he went to the American museum, he saw the skeletons, he thought about them, he saw Knight's paintings and the sculptures. He listened to Osborn's ideas and although T. rex has a bit part in the movie, T. rex influence is huge.\"\n(1933)]] O'Brien was again responsible for special effects in the 1933 monster film King Kong, which featured a climactic battle between the giant ape and a Tyrannosaurus. This scene is credited with the film's success both in terms of cinematic experience and in securing financial backing. In a 2005 tongue in cheek mockumentary, \"T. Rex: A Dinosaur in Hollywood,\" no one less than Kong himself explained why. \"Well, I had to find a suitably impressive monster to showoff my great strength and ruthlessness. There was only one real choice!\"\nIn real life, film historian and Kong scholar Ray Morton agreed with the previous statement. According to Morton, RKO film studio wanted to halt production on King Kong on account of it going over budget. Merian C Cooper, Kong's creator, then showed the studio heads a 20-minute test reel he and his team had made. The footage was of T. Rex's fight with Kong and was this scene that convinced the studio heads that the film had to be made, regardless of costs.\nO'Brien had not originally meant to create Kong, instead seeking to make a film about a lost island of dinosaurs wherein the T. rex would have featured in the climax. When this film, Creation was cancelled, O'Brien used the T. rex model he had made and reused it (along with other dinosaur models) for King Kong. The Tyrannosaurus model was made using a cast based on an early painting by Charles R. Knight. O'Brien stated that the battle between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus was one of the most technically difficult scenes in the film to animate. Many early films depicted Tyrannosaurus with an upright posture based on the current thinking of the time. Most of these films inaccurately portrayed the dinosaur with three prominent fingers on each hand like Allosaurus (though Tyrannosaurus had a third, vestigial finger, it would not have been noticeable at first glance); Walt Disney is reported to have informed dinosaur hunter Barnum Brown that \"it looked better that way\", and the creature was depicted as such as in the Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring segment in the Walt Disney 1940 animated film Fantasia. Since that time, T. rex has appeared in a great number of \"monster\" films and educational documentaries. One of the first appearances which portrayed a proper posture and anatomy of Tyrannosaurus is the 1984 short Prehistoric Beast, fully conceived and made by Phil Tippett by means of his so-called go motion technique. In 1985, the 1984 Prehistoric Beast short was served to Robert Guenette to direct a full-length TV documentary film titled Dinosaur!, for which Phil Tippett made new Tyrannosaurus go motion sequences (chasing Hadrosaurus) in addition to those he made for Prehistoric Beast (where Tyrannosaurus was chasing Monoclonius).\nOne of the most iconic depictions of Tyrannosaurus in film was in 1993's Jurassic Park, in which dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, including Tyrannosaurus, are revived using blood from fossilized mosquitoes. In the film, the dinosaur breaks free of its theme park enclosure before roaming the park after attacking the visitors and killing one (a lawyer). In the film's climax, the Tyrannosaurus (also known as Rexy by fans) indirectly saves the main characters by killing Velociraptors that have been hunting them through the visitor center. The popularity of T. rex long had a reciprocal effect on dinosaur science; the popularity of Jurassic Park factored into the discovery of the dinosaur genus Scipionyx; fossils of this genus had lain in storage in a basement in Italy until the film's release attracted attention from the fossil owner. A Tyrannosaurus family with two adults and a baby appear in the film sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park. In a very minor role in Jurassic Park III, a Tyrannosaurus fight and was killed by the Spinosaurus. The same Tyrannosaurus from the first film return in Jurassic World (2015), making an entrance by smashing through a Spinosaurus skeleton. In the climax, it defeats the Indominus rex, with the help of Blue the Velociraptor and the Mosasaurus. This particular Tyrannosaurus returns again in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Jurassic World: Dominion. A completely new Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed \"Ember\", appears in Jurassic World Rebirth.\nTyrannosaurus is one of the three dinosaur types whose physical characteristics were combined by the designers at Toho, to create the Japanese monster Godzilla; the other two dinosaurs were Stegosaurus and Iguanodon.\nTyrannosaurus has made major appearances in many other films, including Dinosaurus! (1960), The Last Dinosaur (1977), The Land Before Time and its direct-to-video sequels (1988–2016), ''We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993), Toy Story (1995), Night at the Museum (2006), Meet the Robinsons (2007), Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009) and The Good Dinosaur (2015). The IMAX 3D film T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous (1998) featured a Tyrannosaurus in various time travel sequences, as well as its discoverer, Barnum Brown.\nSome Japanese animated films have a Tyrannosaurus as a main protagonist (You Are Umasou, 2010), as the main villain (Daikyouryu no Jidai, The Age of the Great Dinosaurs, 1979), as a minor antagonist (Magic Tree House, 2011), or as a neutral character (Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur, 1980, as well as its 2006 remake).\nDinosaur Island (2014) features a feathered Tyrannosaurus'', reflecting a more modern understanding of the dinosaurs' appearance.\nSonic the Hedgehog (2020) has the brief appearance of a virtual Tyrannosaurus that Dr. Ivo Robotnik pretends to be chased by.\nTelevision appearances\nTyrannosaurus has starred in several television and documentary series, including children's programs, both in those intended as fiction, and, more recently, documentaries.\nIn the American children's show Barney & Friends, Barney is a stylized Tyrannosaurus rex.

However, he panics and runs when he sees the dinosaur, stepping off a special path designed to protect future history. On his return to the present, he discovers that he inadvertently changed history for the worse by stepping on a butterfly. The time safari guide then shoots him because of his blunder.\nIn literature, a dominant representation of Tyrannosaurus since 1990 has been that of Michael Crichton's, as seen in the novel Jurassic Park and its sequel The Lost World (homage title to the 1912 novel by Arthur Conan Doyle, about scientists discovering a South American plateau where dinosaurs still exist). Its skeleton was also used to illustrate the covers of these books.\nA Tyrannosaurus rex was the protagonist of the children's book ''We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (later adapted into a feature-length film of the same name). Tyrannosaurus has also been featured in the novel Primeval: Extinction Event, by Dan Abnett.\nOther appearances\nTyrannosaurus has appeared in many media and is one of, if not the most widely used dinosaurs. Various incarnations of, and creatures based on T. rex have appeared in video games, and several game series have featured Tyrannosaurus a centerpiece. These include 3D Monster Maze, the Dino Crisis/Dino Stalker line, various Jurassic Park tie-in games, the Turok game series, Tomb Raider, the Zoo Tycoon series, the survival game Ark: Survival Evolved, the simulation games Saurian and The Isle, and Super Mario Odyssey''. Wildlife and Dinosaur Park, North Devon, United Kingdom.]]\nNumerous models and children's toys depicting Tyrannosaurus have been produced, particularly in promotion of the Jurassic Park films. The Carnegie Museum Dinosaur Collection toy line released three versions of the dinosaur, with the second brought in line with more modern scientific understanding. Sinclair Oil ads from the 1950s frequently featured T. rex, and products from radio-controlled helicopter models to a rifle cartridge (the .577 T-Rex) have been named after the dinosaur.
