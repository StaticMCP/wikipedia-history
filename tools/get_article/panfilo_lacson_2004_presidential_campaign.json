That time, Lacson is only in the half of his first term as a Senator, and three years ago, he is the former chief of the Philippine National Police.\nThis is his first try to run as president.\nBackground\nLacson won a senate seat in 2001, and that time he was rumored to run as president in the near future.\nThat time, he was only supported by some congressmen like Butz Aquino, Ronaldo Zamora, and Carlos Padilla, while he gathered the support of his former commanding officers, PMA upper classmen and classmates.\nBeing known for being a military and police officer, Lacson offers a style governance that focuses on crime-fighting.\nLacson vs Poe: Divided opposition\nIssue with the other Faction\nAngara faction (who supports Fernando Poe Jr.'s presidential run), said Lacson could be disqualified from the presidential race for allegedly \"misrepresenting\" himself as the party standard-bearer. They also said that his candidacy only boosted the election for full-term of then-incumbent President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, as they consider it to divide the votes for the opposition. If Poe run as president, Lacson will not slide down as his vice presidential candidate.\nThis issue of opposition split made the Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC) and El Shaddai endorse the incumbent Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. INC was rumored of endorsing him at first.\nSplit of LDP\nBy then, Poe and Lacson have both filed their certificates of candidacies for president. According to the rules of candidacy, every presidential candidate must have a political party to back him or her. With the obvious split within the ranks of the LDP, and with no signs that the two factions would come to an agreement, the COMELEC decided to informally split the party into the Aquino and the Angara wings. Lacson then ran under the LDP - Aquino Wing, and Poe under the LDP - Angara Wing, which would later become the KNP.\nBefore and during the campaign period, there had been numerous unification talks between the two factions. The opposition saw the need to become united under one banner to boost their chances of winning the presidential election against the organized political machinery of Arroyo. The plans of unification did not materialize due to the stubbornness of both Poe and Lacson. Lacson wanted Poe to concede to him and run as his vice-presidential candidate while the supporters of Poe wanted Lacson to back out from his candidacy and instead support Poe, citing his low performance in the surveys.\nAngara brought the issue into the Supreme Court, and Lacson decided to resign in the party.\nUnification talks\nLacson and Poe wanted to be unified by many opposition members by April, but no talks happened. Also, former President Fidel Ramos, who is a former military officer and Arroyo's party founder stated that Poe should the one to slide down, and some former Lakas members like Lacson's Senate colleague Frank Drilon believed that Poe is the one who have been better match with Arroyo.\nAlso, Iglesia ni Cristo urged unification talks between Lacson and Poe to strengthen the opposition against the incumbent Arroyo. After the unification attempts failed, Iglesia supported the incumbent one.\nHarassment\nLacson's 2004 campaign received harassment from the administration candidate, such as tearing down their posters.\nResult\nAfter he resign on LDP, and continued campaigning as an independent candidate in the elections. He finished third with 10.88% of the vote, behind the incumbent Arroyo and Poe. He did not concede formally, but only concede by province. He was offered allegedly by some administration officers, but he insisted to decline it.\nEndorsements\n* Rolex T.
