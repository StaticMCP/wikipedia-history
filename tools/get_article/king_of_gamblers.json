Akim Tamiroff takes an unusual featured role as a slot-machine racketeer whose bombing of an uncooperative barber shop leads to a murder charge. (The film was also known as Czar of the Slot Machines.)\nBy her own account, silent film star Louise Brooks played a bit part in the film for  Florey, who \"specialised in giving jobs to destitute and sufficiently grateful actresses\", referring both to herself and to Evelyn Brent. Despite the fact her name appears in the studio campaign book, Brooks does not appear in the completed film.\nCast\n* Claire Trevor as Dixie Moore\n* Lloyd Nolan as Jim Adams\n* Akim Tamiroff as Steve Kalkas\n* Buster Crabbe as Eddie\n* Helen Burgess as Jackie Nolan\n* Porter Hall as George Kramer\n* Barlowe Borland as Mr. Parker\n* Purnell Pratt as Strohm\n* Colin Tapley as Joe\n* Paul Fix as Charlie\n* Cecil Cunningham as Big Edna\n* Fay Holden as Nurse\n* Evelyn Brent as Cora\n* Louise Brooks as Joyce Beaton (scenes deleted)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.pandorasbox.com/films-of-louise-brooks/king_of_gamblers/ King of Gamblers] (filmography page) at Louise Brooks Society"
