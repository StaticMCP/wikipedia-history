A Spanish force of 6,000 troops supported by 13 cannons, commanded by General José de la Gándara, appointed captain-general of Santo Domingo since March, confronted the Dominican insurgents commanded by Benito Monción. The latter, who took refuge in the town of Monte Cristi, suffered a defeat and were forced to retreat, but not without inflicting disproportionate casualties on their opponents. The future Spanish general Fernando Primo de Rivera y Sobremonte was wounded during the fighting.\nThis battle is the most significant victory won by Spain in this conflict during the year 1864. The Dominicans subsequently evaded direct confrontations and opted for a relentless guerrilla tactic which forced the Spaniards to confine themselves to Santo Domingo, the capital.\nRealizing that the reconquest of the island promised to be costly and uncertain, Spain gave up its enterprise and Queen Isabella II of Spain authorized the abandonment of the colony on May 3, 1865.\nBackground\nOccupation of the city by the independentists\nOn August 17, 1863, Captain Federico de Jesús García from Guayubín improvised an army with the peons who accompanied him, marched toward Monte Cristi, and at 2:00 p.m. m. he took possession of the city and its fortress. The improvised column proclaimed Federico de Jesús García as Commander of Arms and the city remained under the control of the independentists while the revolution spread throughout the island.\nPreparations from Cuba\n, Superior Civil Governor and Captain General of the Captaincy General of Cuba.]]\nOn March 30, 1864, Lieutenant General José de la Gándara assumed command as Superior Civil Governor and Captain General of Santo Domingo, replacing the former Carlist militant, Carlos de Vargas, and among the instructions of the appointment, De la Gándara was empowered so that together with the Superior Civil Governor and Captain General of Cuba, Lieutenant General Domingo Dulce, they put all their personal efforts to successfully take Monte Cristi, and once and for all quell the rebellion. With the appointment, 10,000 troops were sent to Santo Domingo, with their leaders and officers, organized into loose battalions, and in Havana the recruitment, training and organization of a column of 4,000 men began to join the expedition to Monte Cristi.\nOn April 11, 1864, two Royal Orders were promulgated in which the appropriate provisions were issued so that from the Iberian Peninsula, Cuba and Puerto Rico, the expeditionary force that would go to Monte Cristi. The expedition had to be ready before autumn to prevent climate and disease from making war actions difficult. During the entire month of April and part of the month of May, the expedition was organized, which was made up of 7,000 men, with their corresponding provision of artillery, cavalry, engineers, health personnel, and sufficient supplies; all under the command of Brigadier from San Felipe and Santiago de Montevideo, Rafael Primo de Rivera.\nInvasion\nArrival of reinforcements\nOn May 15, 1864, the entire expeditionary force met and the next day in the morning the entire force was disembarked, the terrain and the war zone were studied. The landing operations were carried out on the peninsula that separates Monte Cristi Bay from Manzanillo Bay. 7 battalions, 300 engineers, 2 companies of mountain artillerymen and 1 squadron of lancers were landed with all the material, livestock and tools necessary for the fight. The expeditionary troop was also protected by 10 armed boats and boats.\nThe Battle\nOn May 17, 1864, De la Gándara ordered a march along the bottom of Manzanillo Bay in order to surround the separatist positions stationed in Monte Cristi, to attack them from the rear, and cut the only point that the insurgents they had occupied, and which allowed them to withdraw towards Santiago, but the rains of the previous days had bogged down the area, preventing the execution of that combat plan. Given the situation and taking advantage of the low tide, the troops were redirected and ordered to march along the shore of the beach to the mouth of the Yaque del Norte River. Upon reaching that point, the separatists began to shoot at them, however, the boats of the Royal Navy began to protect the ground troops, forcing the separatists to withdraw from the beach and take refuge on a nearby hill. After overcoming this obstacle, the Spaniards found that the Caño Santiago was swollen and they had to swim across it. There the Spaniards were attacked again by the separatists and a mountain battery was on the verge of being exterminated, since in the middle of the pass was destroyed, saw it stuck inside the channel of the pipe, having to be helped by the battalions that had already crossed the stream and after having overcome the jam, the 3 vanguard battalions began the advance towards the city where they fought with the insurgents, defeating them at a few hours after the start of the fight, supported by the rest of the battalions in the rear.\nResult\nInitial situation\n.]]\nDe la Gándara during the evaluation of the results of the campaign and with the newly obtained victory wrote:\nThen the Spanish tried to reconquer Santiago de los Caballeros, however the separatists blocked the road and were ambushed from the forests along the way by guerrillas led by Benito Monción along with Pedro Antonio Pimentel, so they had to give up the objective they had set. They had proposed taking its headquarters from the insurgent Government.\nLater situation of the troops\nAs the days passed, the land army was subjected to innumerable needs and daily at all the points they controlled on the island they were attacked by the separatists. The diseases did not stop, and hunger began to devastate the Spanish camps. At the end of July, the commander of a merchant steamer that passed through Puerto Rico informed the authorities that the troops that garrisoned the fort of San Fernando de Monte Cristi lacked provisions and fresh meat, encountering many hardships and needs. De la Gándara was forced to order the temporary stationing of the troops in the city, and except for the occasional incursion of resistance, little by little a policy of quietism and waiting was adopted.\nFailed attempt to retake the city\nOn May 24, 1864, as soon as the operations were concluded, a line of 1,500 separatists approached the Spanish line and attacked a Spanish infantry battalion, taking an entrenched fort in Laguna Verde.\nOn May 30, 1864, a Spanish detachment that was on reconnaissance work received an unexpected attack from a detachment of 1,200 separatists that they managed to repel soon, but when they were returning to the city they were attacked again and had to order an untimely retreat to the camp. The same day another infantry column was attacked in the town of El Peladero.\nSee also\n*Battle of Paso del Muerto\n*Battle of Sabana de San Pedro\n*Battle of La Canela\nReferences"
