Merkel was the chancellor of Germany from 2005 until 2021, a length of tenure only exceeded by that of Helmut Kohl, and was the first female German chancellor. During her chancellorship, she was widely considered the de facto leader of the European Union. Forbes named Merkel the world's second most powerful person in 2012 and 2015, and the world's most powerful woman fourteen times. Merkel has also commonly been described as the leader of the free world.\nAwards and honours received by Merkel include a special issue of the Grand Cross First Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom, and twenty-one doctorates honoris causa.\nState honours\nGerman honours\nOn 17 April 2023, Merkel received the third-ever special issue of the Grand Cross 1st Class Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany () from President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The special issue had previously been awarded to then-chancellors Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl in 1954 and 1998, respectively, making Merkel the first woman to receive the honour. Steinmeier lauded Merkel's ambition, intelligence, passion, and commitment to her responsibilities as chancellor of Germany. Many observers praised Merkel's achievements, particularly in international diplomacy and shaping the politics of Germany. Some critics questioned the decision to bestow the award on Merkel due to her controversial legacy.\nForeign honours\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Foreign honours received by Angela Merkel\n! scope=col | Year\n!
