In 1932, he was asked to investigate allegations that the Prime Minister of Newfoundland, Sir Richard Squires had falsified cabinet minutes in an attempt to coverup evidence of corruption involving his government. Middleton's conclusions that there was no sign of tampering resulted in a riot outside his office on 5 April 1932 that helped bring down the Squires government. Middleton retired from public life following his term in Newfoundland and returned to England.\nSee also\n* Governors of Newfoundland\n* List of people of Newfoundland and Labrador\nExternal links\n* [http://www.heritage.nf.ca/govhouse/governors/g65.html Biography at Government House The Governorship of Newfoundland and Labrador]"
