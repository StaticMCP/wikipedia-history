You’d think an anthology with Nebula Awards in the title would be filled with all the award winners and as many of the nominees as they had room to cram in.  Not this one.  It has the winners for each category, ... but all the runner-ups get the hook.\" He finds \"[e]verything else in these 420 pages ... padding, and there’s lots of it.\" He rates the non-fiction part of the book \"really disappointing,\" \"slight in actual information, with some essays showing no more work than blog level nattering, that I’d rather trade them all for fiction from the non-winning nominees.\" Expecting from the titles \"a history of science fiction in the 20th century decade-by-decade\" that \"would be surveys of the best fiction from each of the decades covered,\" he finds them instead about \"the business of SF/F,\" which \"appears ... more interesting to the SFWA writers. ... How can you write an essay about SF in the 1960s and not mention the New Wave?  And, not mention work by Samuel R. Delany and Roger Zelazny, ... the decade’s brightest stars?  Delany won 4 Nebula awards in the five years they were given in the 1960s.\" In summation, he writes \"[i]f the Nebula Awards Showcase 2010 had just included all the winners and nominees from the non-novel categories I would have been very happy with the collection.  It would have been a keeper, instead I’m going to leave it on the free table at work.\"\nThe anthology was also reviewed by Larisa Mikhaylova in SFRA Review'' no. 292, 2010.\nNotes"
