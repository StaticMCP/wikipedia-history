Norman (1930–1998) was a psychologist recognized for his research on personality psychology, particularly in establishing the Five-Factor Model (FFM), also known as Norman's \"Big 5\". These dimensions, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience, are foundational aspects of contemporary personality theory.\nEducation\nNorman earned degrees from the University of Minnesota, obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Natural Science in 1952, a Master of Arts in Statistics and Educational Psychology in 1955, and a Ph.D. in Psychology in 1957.\nHis spent most of his career at the University of Michigan. He was the Head of the Department of Psychology and Chairman of the University Senate. He wrote many papers and contributed to numerous psychological associations and editorial boards.\nCareer\nNorman spent thirty-seven years at the university of Michigan. While there, he developed several notable hypotheses, published papers, and continued his research in personality psychology. In 1963 he dismissed the deviation hypothesis, demonstrating \"that subtle test content was equally as useful as obvious content in constructing self-report scales.\"\nAnother 1963 work about categorizing personality traits, Toward an Adequate Taxonomy of Personality Attributes, Norman identified consistent patterns regarding how individuals rate each other's personalities. This work influenced the Five Factor Model.\nRounding out a productive 1963, he published his most well-known work, the Five-Factor Model (FFM). This theory is considered a classic model for measuring and describing personality traits. It measures openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The theory has also become known as Norman's Big Five.\nIn 1967 he published 2800 Personality Trait Descriptors, in which he documented personality traits in detail, presenting a list of characteristics to definitively describe personality traits.\nThroughout his career he served in many leadership positions for psychology societies, journals, and organizations. He also worked at the Oregon Research Institute, the University of Birmingham in England, as well as the University of Queensland and University of Western Australia.\nFurther reading\n* Norman, Warren T.
