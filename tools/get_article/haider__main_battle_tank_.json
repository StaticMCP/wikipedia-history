Lion Heart) is a Pakistani main battle tank (MBT) built by Heavy Industries Taxila for the Pakistan Army. It is a variant of the Chinese VT-4 MBT.  Its existence was revealed in UAE's IDEX in 2023, which was displayed on the Pavilion of Pakistan.\nDesign\nThe design of Haider MBT is conventional with the driver seated at the front center of the hull, the turret in the middle and the engine in rear. The tank has a crew of three: driver, commander and gunner.\nArmament\nThe main armament is a 125&nbsp;mm smoothbore gun. There are also a 7.62&nbsp;mm coaxial machine gun and a 12.7&nbsp;mm heavy machine gun in a remotely operated weapon system (ROWS) on the turret roof.\nArmor\nThe base armor is welded steel and composites, with explosive reactive armor (ERA) on the hull and turret.\nSuspension\nThe Haider tank's torsion suspension system has six road wheels on each side with the first and former wheels mounted on hydraulic shock absorbers.\nFire control system\nThe Haider MBT is equipped with an advanced fire control system that contains a variety of sensors and targeting device to enhance the tank's accuracy and lethality. This system is designed to help the tank's crew have a clear view of the battlefield and to identify and engage threats effectively.\nThe main gun of the tank is equipped with thermal imaging sight (To detect heat signatures and to visualize heat patterns even in low-light environments), laser rangefinder (assists the gunner in determining the precise distance to a target) and a panoramic commander's sight (360 view of the battle field).\nThe fire control system also includes a ballistic computer which calculates the firing solution for the main gun based on the target's distance, angle and various other parameters. This assists the crew to ensure that the tank's rounds hit their target accurately and with maximum effect.\nWith addition to these features, the lethality of the tank is further increased by the addition of a sophisticated ballistic computer that with pinpoint accuracy, calculates the firing solution for the main gun. This feature promises accuracy with precision.\nUnveiling ceremony\nThe Haider main battle tank was unveiled on 6 March 2024 at Heavy Industries Taxila. Senior officials including Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir participated in the ceremony.\nReferences"
