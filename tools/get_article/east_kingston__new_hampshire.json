The population was 2,441 at the 2020 census.\nHistory\nEast Kingston was once a part of Kingston called \"Kingston East Parish\", but was granted a separate charter in 1738 by Governor Jonathan Belcher. Several residents of East Kingston had petitioned Governor Belcher that its location was too distant from the Kingston school and place of worship.\nThe town grew up around the saw and grist mill at the Trickling Falls on the edge of Powwow Pond. Farms prospered on the good soil, and ice-cutting in the Powwow River was a thriving winter business before the age of refrigeration. The New England Brick Company was once a principal industry.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  are water, comprising 0.56% of the town. The southern half of East Kingston is drained by the Powwow River, a tributary of the Merrimack River, while the remainder is drained by Great Brook, a tributary of the Exeter River, which ultimately drains to the Atlantic Ocean via Great Bay. A very small portion of  Powwow Pond on the Powwow River lies within the town. Roughly the northern half of East Kingston lies within the Piscataqua River (Coastal) watershed, with the southern half of town located in the Merrimack River watershed. The highest point in town is the summit of Morse Hill, at  above sea level.\nAdjacent municipalities\n* Exeter (northeast)\n* Kensington (east)\n* South Hampton (south)\n* Newton (southwest)\n* Kingston (west)\nDemographics\n}}\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,784 people, 629 households, and 508 families residing in the town.
