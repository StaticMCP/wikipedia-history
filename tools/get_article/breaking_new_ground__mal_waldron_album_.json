Normally focusing on his own compositions, these 1983 trio sessions with Reggie Workman and Ed Blackwell find him mining current pop songs... This CD may startle Waldron's fans a bit, but it proves that he was open to new ideas\".\n}}\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Mal Waldron except where noted.\n# \"Dans La Cuisine d'Alibi\"\n# \"Suicide Is Painless\" (Mike Altman, Johnny Mandel)\n# \"After the Love Has Gone\" (David Foster, Jay Graydon, Bill Champlin)\n# \"Beat It\" (Michael Jackson)\n# \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\" (Stevie Wonder)\n# \"Gymnopédie No. 2\" (Erik Satie)\n# \"Everything Must Change\" (Bernard Ighner)\n# \"Thy Freedom Come\"\n*Recorded in Tokyo, Japan on June 28 & 29, 1983\nPersonnel\n* Mal Waldron &mdash; piano\n* Reggie Workman &mdash; bass\n* Ed Blackwell &mdash; drums\nReferences"
