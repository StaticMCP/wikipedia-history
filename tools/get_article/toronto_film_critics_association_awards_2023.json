Two Outstanding Lead Performance winners and two Outstanding Supporting Performance winners were chosen by vote, without regard to gender.\nThe awards gala was held, along with the winner announcements of the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award and Rogers Best Canadian Documentary, at The Omni King Edward Hotel in Toronto, hosted by Canadian actress Amanda Brugel, on March 4, 2024.\nChanges\nThe awards saw various changes from previous years:\n* The former categories of Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress were retired and replaced with new gender-neutral categories: Outstanding Lead Performance and Outstanding Supporting Performance (with six finalists and two winners per category); two new performance categories were also introduced: Outstanding Performance in a Canadian Film and Outstanding Breakthrough Performance.\n* Best Screenplay, formerly a single category, was split into separate categories: Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n* The Rogers Best Canadian Film Award, formerly open to both narrative and documentary features, will now be split into two separate awards for narrative and documentary films.\nWinners\nWinners are listed first and in bold, followed by the runners-up.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Picture\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Zone of Interest\n** All of Us Strangers\n** Killers of the Flower Moon\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Jonathan Glazer – The Zone of Interest'\n** Martin Scorsese – Killers of the Flower Moon\n** Justine Triet – Anatomy of a Fall\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Outstanding Lead Performance\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Outstanding Supporting Performance\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Lily Gladstone – Killers of the Flower Moon as Mollie Burkhart\n* Sandra Hüller – Anatomy of a Fall as Sandra Voyter'\n** Paul Giamatti – The Holdovers as Paul Hunham\n** Andrew Scott – All of Us Strangers as Adam\n** Emma Stone – Poor Things as Bella Baxter\n** Kôji Yakusho – Perfect Days as Hirayama\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Ryan Gosling – Barbie'' as Ken\n* Da'Vine Joy Randolph – The Holdovers as Mary Lamb'\n** Robert De Niro – Killers of the Flower Moon as William King Hale\n** Robert Downey Jr. – Oppenheimer as Lewis Strauss\n** Glenn Howerton – BlackBerry as Jim Balsillie\n** Charles Melton – May December as Joe Yoo\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Outstanding Performance in a Canadian Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Outstanding Breakthrough Performance\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Glenn Howerton – BlackBerry as Jim Balsillie'\n** Jay Baruchel – BlackBerry as Mike Lazaridis\n** Théodore Pellerin – Solo as Simon\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Teyana Taylor – A Thousand and One as Inez de la Paz'\n** Charles Melton – May December as Joe Yoo\n** Dominic Sessa – The Holdovers as Angus Tully\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Original Screenplay\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Adapted Screenplay\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach – Barbie'\n** Celine Song – Past Lives\n** Justine Triet and Arthur Harari – Anatomy of a Fall\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese – Killers of the Flower Moon'\n** Andrew Haigh – All of Us Strangers\n** Tony McNamara – Poor Things\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best Animated Feature\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best International Feature\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Robot Dreams\n** The Boy and the Heron\n** Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Fallen Leaves (Kuolleet lehdet)'\n** Anatomy of a Fall\n** The Zone of Interest\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Best First Feature\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Allan King Documentary Award\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Rye Lane\n** American Fiction\n** Past Lives\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 20 Days in Mariupol\n** The Eternal Memory\n** Four Daughters\n** Swan Song\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Rogers Best Canadian Film\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\"| Rogers Best Canadian Documentary\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* BlackBerry\n** Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person (Vampire humaniste cherche suicidaire consentant)\n** Solo\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Swan Song\n** Rojek\n** Someone Lives Here''\n|}\nSpecial awards\n* Company 3 Luminary Award – Charles Officer\n* Telefilm Canada Emerging Critic Award – Winnie Wang\n* Stella Artois Jay Scott Prize for Best Emerging Artist – Ariane Louis-Seize\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
