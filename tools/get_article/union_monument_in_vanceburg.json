It stands thirty-four feet tall, and both the pedestal and base are made of limestone.  The base is five feet high and seven feet wide.  The pedestal was made from eight separate pieces.  The statue depicts a Union soldier in winter gear and kepi hat.\nThe inscription reads:\n“THE WAR FOR THE UNION WAS RIGHT, EVERLASTINGLY RIGHT; AND THE WAR AGAINST THE UNION WAS WRONG, FOREVER WRONG.”\nIn total, 107 men from Lewis County died as Union soldiers during the war; their names are inscribed on the monument.\nOn July 17, 1997, the Union Monument in Vanceburg was one of sixty-one different monuments related to the Civil War in Kentucky placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission.  The vast majority of the monuments were built to honor Confederates.  The only other monument to state any strong sentiment towards the Union is the Captain Andrew Offutt Monument in Lebanon, Kentucky.  Other monuments built for the Union side include the 32nd Indiana Monument, GAR Monument in Covington, Union Monument in Louisville, and the Union Monument in Perryville.\nGallery\nFile:Union Monument in Vanceburg courthouse.JPG|View of monument with courthouse\nFile:Union Monument in Vanceburg markers.JPG|Various signs by the monument\nFile:Union Monument in Vanceburg inscriptions.JPG|Inscription closeup of the monument\nFile:Union Monument in Vanceburg 2.JPG|\nReferences"
