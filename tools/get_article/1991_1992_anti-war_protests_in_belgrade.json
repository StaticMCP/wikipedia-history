The 1991 mass protests against the government of Slobodan Milošević which continued throughout the conflicts reinforced the youth's anti-war orientation. Demonstrations in Belgrade were held mostly because of opposition to the Battle of Vukovar, Siege of Dubrovnik and Siege of Sarajevo, while protesters demanded a referendum on a declaration of war and disruption of military conscription.\nMore than 50,000 people participated in many protests, and more than 150,000 people took part in the most massive protest called “The Black Ribbon March” in solidarity with people in Sarajevo. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 200,000 people deserted from the Yugoslav People's Army, while between 100,000 and 150,000 people emigrated from Serbia refusing to participate in the war.\nAccording to professor Renaud De la Brosse, senior lecturer at the University of Reims and a witness called by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), it is surprising how great the resistance to Milošević's propaganda was among Serbs, given that and the lack of access to alternative news. A month after the Battle of Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64% of Serbian people wanted to end the war immediately and only 27% were willing for it to continue. Political scientists Orli Fridman described that not enough attention was given to anti-war activism among scholars studying the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars, as well as that independent media and anti-war groups from Serbia did not attract the international attention.\nThe main participants\nThe most famous associations and NGOs who marked the anti-war ideas and movements in Serbia were the Center for Antiwar Action, Women in Black, Humanitarian Law Center and Belgrade Circle. The Rimtutituki was a rock supergroup featuring Ekatarina Velika, Električni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members, which was formed at the petition signing against mobilization in Belgrade. The band organized a concert on the Republic Square and also they performed anti-war songs in an open truck while circulating the Belgrade streets.\nThe most prominent politician who supported protests was Ivan Stambolić. The Democratic Party, People's Peasant Party, Serbian Liberal Party and Reform Party of Serbia took part in the “Black Ribbon March”.\nThe famous architect Bogdan Bogdanović was one of the most prominent anti-war dissident. The Belgrade citizens who protested against the Siege of Dubrovnik were joined by prominent artists, composers and actors such as Mirjana Karanović and Rade Šerbedžija, who sang jointly “Neću protiv druga svog” (“I can’t go against my friend”).\nIndependent media in Serbia reported on anti-war activities with much difficulty, in contrast to Milošević's propaganda, which was aimed at reviving ethnonational sentiments and mobilizing people. An important role in media coverage was played by the Western-funded electronic media B92 and Studio B.\nOne of the more famous scenes during the anti-war protests was a tank parked in front of the Parliament Building, which was returned from the battlefield in Vukovar by soldier Vladimir Živković.\nSee also\n* 1992 anti-war protests in Sarajevo\n* Concert Yutel for Peace\nReferences\n;Books\n*\n*\n*\n;Journal articles and documents\n*\n*"
