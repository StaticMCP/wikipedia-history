In June 1995, the Association of Polish Architects (Stowarzyszenie Architektów Polskich) announced a competition for a monument commemorating the Polish contribution to the Battle of Monte Cassino. The monument was financed by contributions from veterans of the Polish Army 2nd Corps, who captured Monte Cassino on 18 May 1944, and grants from numerous institutions.\nIt was unveiled on 30 May 1999 by Irena Anders, widow of General Władysław Anders (commander of the 2nd Corps), assisted by an honor guard of the Polish Army, in a ceremony that also commemorated the 55th anniversary of the battle. During the ceremony, the President of Poland was represented by the Head of the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland, Ryszard Kalisz.\nConstruction\nThe monument was designed by sculptor Kazimierz Gustaw Zemła and architect Wojciech Zabłocki. It is made of reinforced concrete covered with white Carrara marble and weighs 220 tonnes. To stabilise the ground under the 70-tonne column which is the highest element of the composition, six metre holes were dug into the ground.\nThe statue is a headless Nike with traces of fighting and injury, in the form of a 12-metre column. Within the base of the monument can be seen the hill of Monte Cassino covered with a shroud, the figure of the Virgin Mary and scattered helmets. The two-metre pedestal is engraved with the Cross of Monte Cassino, the emblems of the five Polish units that took part in the battle, a Polish eagle and an urn containing ashes of the heroes.\nThere are two smaller memorials adjacent to the main monument. The first is adorned with a plaque featuring an image of General Władysław Anders and the second is a \"monument of gratitude\" to the people of Persia (now Iran) who generously welcomed over 120,000 Polish refugees escaping from the Soviet Union with the Anders Army in 1942.\nGallery\nFile:Battle of Monte Cassino Monument Warsaw 02.jpg|Side view of the monument\nFile:Monument to the Battle of Monte Cassino in Warsaw (16231752172).jpg|The inscription on the front of the monument\nFile:Monument to the Battle of Monte Cassino in Warsaw (16206511136).jpg|Monte Cassino cross\nFile:Monument to the Battle of Monte Cassino in Warsaw (16230621561).jpg|The back of the monument\nFile:Monte Casino monument02.JPG|Close up of the back of the monument\nFile:Monument to the Battle of Monte Cassino in Warsaw (16046361599).jpg|The inscription on the back of the monument\nFile:Pomnik MC Waw.jpg|The figure of the Virgin Mary\nFile:260520117DSC 0950.JPG|Side view of the monument\nFile:Monument to the Battle of Monte Cassino in Warsaw (16231712312).jpg|The smaller memorial (front)\nFile:Montecasinowwaw.JPG|Close up of the smaller memorial (front)\nFile:Monument to the Battle of Monte Cassino in Warsaw (15612724703).jpg|Close up of the smaller memorial (back)\nFile:Monument of Gratitude to the Iranian People (16053938447).jpg|The Monument of Gratitude to the Iranian People\nBibliography\n*\n*"
