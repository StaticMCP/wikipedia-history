Security for the polling site was provided by the Iraqi Security Force (ISF) and members of the US Marines Corps.]]\nThis timeline lists the dates of the '''first women's suffrage in Muslim majority countries'''. Dates for the right to vote, suffrage, as distinct from the right to stand for election and hold office, are listed.\nSome countries with majority Muslim populations established universal suffrage upon national independence, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Malaysia. In most North Africa countries, women participated in the first national elections or soon following. Some dates relate to regional elections and, where possible, the second date of general election has been included. Even countries listed may not have universal suffrage for women, and some may have regressed in women's rights since the initial granting of suffrage.\nTimeline\n1917\n*  United Republics of the North Caucasus\n*  Crimean People's Republic\n1918\n* Azerbaijan Democratic Republic\n* Kyrgyz SSR (Soviet Republic)\n1920\n*\n1921\n* (Soviet Republic)\n1924\n* Tajik SSR (Soviet Republic)\n* Kazakh SSR (Soviet Republic)\n1927\n* (Soviet Republic)\n1930\n* (municipal elections)\n1932\n*\n1934\n* (national elections)\n1938\n* (Soviet Republic)\n1945\n* Senegal\n*\n1946\n* French Somaliland\n* Republic of Mahabad\n1947\n* (upon its national independence)\n1948\n* Niger\n1949\n*\n1952\n* (an educational requirement)\n* Ivory Coast\n1956\n* Comoros\n*\n* Mali\n*\n1957\n* (universal)\n* (now Peninsular Malaysia)\n1958\n*\n* Chad\n*\n1959\n*\n*\n1960\n* Gambia\n1961\n*\n*\n1962\n*\n* (revoked)\n1963\n* (after a referendum)\n*\n1964\n*\n*\n1965\n* (first time)\n1967\n*\n1970\n*\n1972\n* (Bangladesh achieved independence on December 16, 1971 and women suffrage was never barred.)\n1973\n*  (Bahrain did not hold elections until 2002.)\n1974\n*\n1976\n* (women allowed to vote in local elections for the first time; at the previous election, in 1972, only male property owners could vote)\n1978\n* (North)\n1980\n*\n1985\n*  (first time)\n1996\n* (revoked by the Taliban)\n* (first elections held in the territory since 1923)\n1999\n*\n* (revoked)\n2002\n* (re-granted after the fall of the Taliban)\n2003\n*\n2005\n*  (re-granted)\n2006\n*\n2011\n* (introduced along with right to run for municipal elections in 2015)\n2021\n* (revoked)\nSee also\n* Rawya Ateya (first female parliamentarian in Egypt and the Arab world)\n* List of the first female members of parliament by country\n* List of equal or majority Muslim countries\n* List of suffragists and suffragettes\n* List of women's rights activists\n* Sex segregation in Islam\n* Timeline of women's suffrage\n* Women in Islam\nReferences"
