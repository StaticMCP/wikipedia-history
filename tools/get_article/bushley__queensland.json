In the , Bushley had a population of 36 people.\nGeography\nThe Central Western railway line forms the northern boundary of the locality, with the now-abandoned Bushley railway station () serving the locality.\nBushley has the following mountains (from north to south):\n* Mount Hay ()\n* Mount Gordon ()\n* Mount Coombs ()\n* Browns Lookout ()\nThe land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nMethodist church services at Bushley date back to 1875 when Reverend Robert Hartley commenced worship services at the home of Mr and Mrs Isaac Coombs family.  The Coombs family later donated their land for the construction of a community hall where church services were held until the opening of the existing brick church building in 1959 in front of the hall. The Bushley Methodist Church was officially opened on 13 December 1959.  It became the Bushley Uniting Church following the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977. The final service was held at the church on 5 December 2021, just shy of its 62nd anniversary, which was attended by about 75 people including Uniting Church moderator Rev Andrew Gunton. The church was closed due to dwindling attendance numbers. Bushley Uniting Church was at 525 Brickworks Road (access from Bushley Road off the Capricorn Highway, ). It was part of the Parish of Rockhampton South Uniting Church.\nPlayfair State School opened on 10 July 1917. It closed in 1928. It presumably takes its name from the parish. The school was located at approximately 213 Sandy Creek Road ().\nIn 2019, Bushley was selected as the site of a new waste transfer station which aimed to serve the needs of residents of Rockhampton Regional Council's western districts from Gogango to Stanwell following the closure of roadside bin stations. The council's decision to close the local roadside bin stations had previously been criticised by residents and led to a heated community meeting at nearby Wycarbah in 2018.\nDemographics\nIn the , Bushley had a population of 30 people.\nIn the , Bushley had a population of 36 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Bushley.
