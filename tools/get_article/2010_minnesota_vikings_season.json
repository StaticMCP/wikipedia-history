After a loss to the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship ended their 2009 season, the Vikings had hoped to defend their NFC North division title for the third year in a row and contend again for a Super Bowl championship. However, Brett Favre was unable to recover from the injuries he had sustained in the NFC Championship and turned in abysmal performances for most of the season, being forced to sit out three games due to injuries and breaking his consecutive start record at 297 games since September 1992. After the Vikings fell to a 3–7 record with a 31–3 division loss to the Green Bay Packers in week 11, Childress was fired and assistant head coach and defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier was named as his interim replacement, going 3–3 in his six games in charge before taking over the job permanently at the end of the season. The team finished 6–10 and ended up in last place in the division for the first time since 1990. The Vikings also missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007.\nThis season also saw the return of star wide receiver Randy Moss, as the Vikings traded a third-round draft pick to the New England Patriots in exchange for Moss and a 2012 seventh-round selection. Although it was his first time back with the Vikings since 2004, Moss was waived after only a month in Minnesota, before being claimed off waivers by the Tennessee Titans, where he played the remainder of the season before retiring at the end of the season. It was also quarterback Brett Favre's 20th and final season in the NFL; Favre had started 321 straight games from 1992 to 2010, and retired as the all-time leader in consecutive starts made by a quarterback. Favre was also the last remaining active player to win a Super Bowl in the 1990s, having led the Packers to their third Super Bowl title in 1997.\nFurther woes befell the team when wide receiver Percy Harvin missed two games due to persistent migraine headaches. On December 12, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome's inflatable roof collapsed for the first time since 1986 after a heavy snowfall. As a consequence, the Vikings had to play that week's game against the Giants at Detroit's Ford Field on Monday night. Since the Metrodome's roof could not be repaired in time, the team was forced to play the Bears in Week 15 at TCF Bank Stadium for their first outdoor home game since 1981.\nOffseason\nTransactions\nIn April 2010, the Vikings re-signed restricted free agents Ryan Cook (offensive tackle), Fred Evans (defensive tackle), Eric Frampton (safety) and Naufahu Tahi (fullback). A week later, on April 21, they signed cornerback Lito Sheppard to a one-year contract after his release by the New York Jets. They then added wide receiver Marquis Hamilton and offensive tackle Bill Noethlich to their roster in the first week of May.\nDuring the 2010 preseason, the Vikings were struggling at the wide receiver position and signed free agent Javon Walker – who had been released by the Oakland Raiders in April – before trading cornerback Benny Sapp to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for Greg Camarillo. A week later, the Vikings waived the contracts of Bill Noethlich and Marko Mitchell, placed J Leman on the injured reserve list and designated Sidney Rice as Physically Unable to Perform.\nOn September 3, the Vikings traded Sage Rosenfels and Darius Reynaud to the New York Giants for a fifth-round pick in the 2011 draft and a conditional seventh-round pick in 2012. Rosenfels became expendable to the Vikings when Brett Favre decided to return for the 2010 season.\n2010 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\" style=\"\"| 2010 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Contract\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n! 1\n! 30\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Detroit Lions\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 2\n! 34\n| Chris Cook\n| CB\n| Virginia\n| 4 years, $5.37&nbsp;million\n| From Lions\n|-\n! 51\n| Toby Gerhart\n| RB\n| Stanford\n| 4 years, $3.767&nbsp;million\n| From Texans\n|-\n! 62\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Houston Texans\n|\n|-\n! 3\n! 93\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Houston Texans\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 4\n! 100\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Everson Griffen\n| DE\n| USC\n| 4 years, $2.33&nbsp;million\n| From Lions\n|-\n! 128\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Detroit Lions\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 5\n! 161\n| Chris DeGeare\n| OT\n| Wake Forest\n| 4 years, $1.95&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n! 167\n| Nathan Triplett\n| LB\n| Minnesota\n| 4 years, $1.942&nbsp;million\n| Compensatory pick\n|-\n! 6\n! 199\n| Joe Webb\n| QB\n| UAB\n| 4 years, $1.882&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 7\n! 214\n| Mickey Shuler Jr.\n| TE\n| Penn State\n| 4 years, $1.85&nbsp;million\n| From Browns via Lions\n|-\n! 237\n| Ryan D'Imperio\n| LB\n| Rutgers\n| 4 years, $1.837&nbsp;million\n|\n|}\nNotes:\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\nSchedule\nThe Vikings preseason schedule was announced on March 31, 2010.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The Rams roster featured rookie quarterback Sam Bradford, signed as the #1 overall pick in the 2010 NFL draft. Meanwhile, the Vikings were without six members of their regular starting offense, including QB Brett Favre and RB Adrian Peterson. The Rams got the first touchdown of the game with 1:29 remaining in the first quarter, when Danny Amendola returned a Chris Kluwe punt for 93 yards. The Vikings responded with two TDs in the second quarter; first, backup QB Sage Rosenfels passed for two yards to wide receiver Logan Payne, before throwing a 65-yard TD pass to tight end Garrett Mills. Rosenfels got his third passing TD in the third quarter, with a 71-yard pass to WR Marko Mitchell. The victory was completed with 6:49 left in the game as fellow rookies – QB Joe Webb and TE Mickey Shuler Jr. – combined for a two-yard pass.\nWeek 2: at San Francisco 49ers\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Preseason Week 2: Minnesota Vikings at San Francisco 49ers&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=August 22\n|time=19:00\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=0 |R2=3 |R3=0 |R4=7\n|home=49ers\n|H1=7 |H2=0 |H3=3 |H4=5\n|stadium=Candlestick Park, San Francisco, California\n|attendance=69,732\n|weather=Sunny,\n|referee=Bill Leavy (127)\n|TV=NBC\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-49ers-2010-pre-2 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55104/SF_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*SF – Anthony Dixon 4-yard run (Joe Nedney kick), 8:03. 49ers 7–0.

The game marked the return of quarterback Brett Favre to the Vikings' starting lineup, but he lasted just four plays; the first was a 13-yard pass to RB Adrian Peterson for a first down, but he was sacked for a loss of 10 yards two plays later and was replaced by Tarvaris Jackson for the Vikings' next drive.\nBy the time Favre took the field, the 49ers were already leading 7–0 via a 4-yard run from Anthony Dixon. It was not until the 2nd quarter that the Vikings got their first points on the board, with Ryan Longwell landing a 40-yard field goal. San Francisco responded with two Joe Nedney field goals in the second half before the Vikings' rookie QB Joe Webb took advantage of a gap in the 49ers defense to rush 48 yards for a touchdown, bringing Minnesota within three points with two minutes left to play. Kicker Rhys Lloyd attempted an onside kick, but it was recovered by San Francisco, and by the time the Vikings got the ball back they were on their own 8-yard line with 9 seconds left in the game. They attempted to go for the win, but Webb was sacked in the end zone for a safety as the clock ran out, giving the 49ers a 15–10 win.\nWeek 3: vs. Seattle Seahawks\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Preseason Week 3: Seattle Seahawks at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=August 28\n|time=19:00\n|road=Seahawks\n|R1=0 |R2=10 |R3=3 |R4=0\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=0 |H2=10 |H3=0 |H4=14\n|stadium=Mall of America Field at Hubert H.

Quarterback Brett Favre lasted for eight series and threw for 187 yards on 16 completions, but the Vikings only came away with 10 points while he was on the field. The first points of the game came from an interception of a Favre pass, as Seattle safety Earl Thomas got to the ball ahead of wide receiver Bernard Berrian and returned it for an 86-yard touchdown. Nevertheless, Darius Reynaud returned the ensuing kickoff for 73 yards, giving Adrian Peterson the opportunity to rush 23 yards in two plays to level the scores at 7–7. Olindo Mare and Ryan Longwell then traded field goals to make the scores 10–10 at halftime. Another field goal from Mare put the Seahawks ahead on their first drive of the second half, but the Vikings responded with a 25-yard touchdown pass from Sage Rosenfels to new wide receiver Javon Walker with just over seven minutes left in the game. Minnesota sealed the win with less than three minutes on the clock, when Joe Webb tossed the ball seven yards for fullback Ryan D'Imperio to return the Vikings to a winning preseason record.\nWeek 4: vs. Denver Broncos\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Preseason Week 4: Denver Broncos at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=September 2\n|time=19:00\n|road=Broncos\n|R1=7 |R2=0 |R3=7 |R4=10\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=7 |H2=10 |H3=7 |H4=7\n|stadium=Mall of America Field at Hubert H.

To accommodate the Vikings playing in the 2010 NFL Kickoff game the following Thursday, this game was also played on a Thursday, and head coach Brad Childress opted to rest the majority of his starting lineup. As in each of their three previous preseason games, the Vikings conceded the first points of the game, allowing LenDale White to rush two yards into the endzone and convert on 2nd-and-goal. The Vikings were unable to earn a first down on each of their first three series, but after punting on the third, the Broncos' rookie quarterback Tim Tebow fumbled the snap on their return drive; Erin Henderson picked up the loose ball and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown. Ryan Longwell put Minnesota ahead with a 27-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter, and from that point the Vikings never relinquished their lead. Albert Young then converted a 1st-and-goal from the 1-yard line to give Minnesota a 10-point lead at halftime. The two teams traded touchdowns in the third quarter, as Tebow threw a 39-yard pass to Matthew Willis for Denver, and Ian Johnson rushed 4 yards for Minnesota. A 14-yard pass from Brady Quinn to Alric Arnett brought the Broncos to within three points going into the last 12 minutes of the game, but on the very next series, Joe Webb threw a 63-yard pass to a wide open Javon Walker on the right side of the field, and the wide receiver walked into the end zone. Broncos kicker Matt Prater completed the scoring with a 49-yard field goal with just under five minutes left, giving the Vikings a 31–24 win and a 3–1 preseason record.\nRegular season\nSchedule\nBased on the NFL's predetermined scheduling formula, the Vikings played every team in the NFC East and AFC East, the teams from the NFC South and NFC West that finished the same place in their division as the Vikings did last year (which were the division winners), as well as their usual NFC North division rivals. The schedule was announced on April 20, 2010: the season began with the Vikings taking on the New Orleans Saints in the NFL Kickoff Game on Thursday, September 9, while the bye week will come in Week 4. The season culminated with road games against the Philadelphia Eagles and the Detroit Lions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Week !! Date !! Opponent !! Result !! Record !!

Minnesota lost the coin toss and gave up a touchdown on the first drive of the game; New Orleans received the ball from the kickoff and then took 5 plays to go 77 yards, culminating with Drew Brees passing 29 yards down the right sideline for wide receiver Devery Henderson, who dived into the endzone for the score. The 1st quarter ended with the Vikings defense forcing the Saints to go 3-and-out, with the subsequent punt beginning the 2nd quarter.\nThe Vikings began the next drive at their own 11-yard line, before taking 16 plays to go 66 yards and into field goal range. They failed to convert on 3rd down at the New Orleans 23-yard line, giving Ryan Longwell the chance to score a 41-yard field goal. Minnesota forced another 3-and-out on the Saints' next possession, but Bernard Berrian muffed the catch on the punt return, and the Vikings began their next drive at their own 18-yard line. To rub salt in the wound, on the 3rd play of the drive, Brett Favre was hit hard by Roman Harper and he threw a pass right into the hands of Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma. With less than 90 seconds left in the half, Garrett Hartley stepped up for a 46-yard field goal attempt, but he hooked the kick wide left of the uprights. Beginning at the 36-yard line with 1:19 left in the half, Favre controlled the clock and picked up a 1st down before throwing consecutive 33-yard and 20-yard passes to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe for the Vikings' first touchdown of the season. Ryan Longwell's extra point attempt was blocked by defensive tackle Remi Ayodele, but the Vikings went in at the half with a 2-point lead.\nAfter receiving the ball to start the second half, the Vikings were unable to get past midfield and gave the ball back to the Saints on the New Orleans 26-yard line. In the space of 10 plays, the Saints were up to the Minnesota 1-yard line, from where Pierre Thomas was able to jump over the line of scrimmage to restore New Orleans' lead. In the 4th quarter, the Saints had another shot at a field goal, this time from 32 yards, but again Hartley pulled the kick wide of the posts. New Orleans got the ball back with 5:32 left in the game, and ran out the clock to claim a 14–9 win.\nWeek 2: vs. Miami Dolphins\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 2: Miami Dolphins at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=September 19\n|time=12:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Dolphins\n|R1=7 |R2=0 |R3=7 |R4=0\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=0 |H2=0 |H3=7 |H4=3\n|stadium=Mall of America Field at Hubert H.

Yet again, Minnesota conceded the first points of the game – on Miami's first offensive play of the game, Chad Henne threw a 46-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to get the Dolphins to the Minnesota 27-yard line; eight plays later, they had the ball in the endzone via a 5-yard pass from Henne to wide receiver Brian Hartline. The 2nd quarter saw Brett Favre throw his second interception of the season – his first of four turnovers during the game. The second came midway through the 3rd quarter when the 21-year veteran fumbled on a sack into his own endzone; the ball was recovered by Dolphins linebacker Koa Misi to give Miami a two-possession lead.\nA Minnesota fightback began soon after, but not before Favre threw another interception, picked off by cornerback Jason Allen at the Miami 2-yard line. However, on Miami's first play after the turnover, running back Ricky Williams fumbled during a tackle by linebacker E. J. Henderson; Henderson's brother Erin recovered the ball and made his way to the 1-yard line, giving the Vikings a 1st-and-goal opportunity. Favre failed to pick out tight end Visanthe Shiancoe with the first play of the drive before allowing Adrian Peterson to barge through the line of scrimmage for the touchdown. A 13-play drive at the start of the 4th quarter got the Vikings into the Dolphins' redzone, but the Miami defense forced them to settle for a 28-yard field goal.\nWith just under six minutes left in the game, Minnesota defensive tackle Pat Williams forced another Miami fumble, recovered by E. J. Henderson 24 yards from the Miami endzone. A succession of rushing attempts from Adrian Peterson followed, getting the Vikings to within a yard of a go-ahead touchdown, but linebacker Karlos Dansby stopped him short of the line on 4th-and-goal. The Vikings had one more attempt to steal the win inside the final two minutes, but Favre's attempted pass to Shiancoe on 4th-and-6 from the Dolphins' 27 fell incomplete, allowing Henne to run the game out with a kneel down, and the Vikings suffered their first home loss in the regular season for the first time since 2008 against the Atlanta Falcons.\nWeek 3: vs. Detroit Lions\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 3: Detroit Lions at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=September 26\n|time=12:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Lions\n|R1=7 |R2=3 |R3=0 |R4=0\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=7 |H2=7 |H3=10 |H4=0\n|stadium=Mall of America Field at Hubert H.

Both teams went into the game with 0–2 records, hoping to move away from the bottom of the division standings. Deep into the 1st quarter, Vikings quarterback Brett Favre continued his interception-throwing form, as he was picked off by Lions defensive tackle Corey Williams while attempting to throw a short pass to running back Toby Gerhart. Williams set off on a run, but Gerhart recovered to bring him down at the Minnesota 12-yard line. Three short plays later, Detroit had the ball in the end zone, quarterback Shaun Hill finishing off the drive with a 5-yard pass to tight end Tony Scheffler. The Vikings were forced to punt the ball away on their first drive after the touchdown, but Detroit punt returner Stefan Logan fumbled while attempting to catch the ball, which was recovered by Vikings linebacker Chad Greenway 24 yards from the Detroit goal line. With the first play of the drive, Favre threw a 24-yard pass to wide receiver Percy Harvin, who made a diving catch for the game-tying touchdown. Detroit's next drive resulted in a missed field goal, allowing the Vikings to go 66 yards back down the field for a touchdown, finished off by a 6-yard run from Adrian Peterson. With a minute left in the first half, Favre was picked off yet again, as his throwing arm was hit by Lions defensive end Cliff Avril, giving Alphonso Smith a simple interception. The Lions drove 36 yards into the Minnesota half, and Jason Hanson ended the 2nd quarter with a field goal from 33 yards.\nMinnesota began the second half with the ball and took 10 plays to get into the Detroit red zone; however, the Detroit defense stood firm and the Vikings were limited to a 31-yard field goal from Ryan Longwell. The Lions managed to get back into the Minnesota half on their next possession, but they went 3-and-out on the Minnesota 41-yard line before punting into the end zone for a touchback. On the very next play, Vikings halfback Adrian Peterson broke a career-long 80-yard run for a touchdown to put Minnesota 24–10 up. On Detroit's next possession, a sack on 3rd-and-20 by Vikings defensive end Brian Robison on quarterback Shaun Hill sparked a mass brawl between the two teams. As the defense made their way off the field, Brett Favre was seen giving them vigorous verbal encouragement. Midway through the 4th quarter, Minnesota running back Toby Gerhart fumbled the ball in a tackle, and it was recovered by Detroit free safety Louis Delmas. The Lions then drove back down the field from their own 22-yard line to within 4 yards of the Minnesota end zone in just under 5 minutes. However, on 1st-and-goal, Vikings linebacker Ben Leber intercepted Shaun Hill's attempted pass to running back Maurice Morris inside the end zone before returning it to the Minnesota 18-yard line. The Vikings failed in their attempt to run the clock down to the two-minute warning and had to punt the ball away, giving the Lions one final chance to reduce their deficit. Beginning the drive at their own 38-yard line, they got to the Minnesota 10-yard line within seven plays, but cornerback Antoine Winfield intercepted Hill's attempt at another touchdown pass to Tony Scheffler inside the endzone for a touchback with only a minute to go. Brett Favre knelt the ball down to run out the clock and the Vikings picked up their first win of the regular season.\nWeek 4: Bye week\nThe Vikings took their 2010 bye week in Week 4 of the season – their earliest bye week since the 2004 season. There were mixed results for their divisional rivals, with the Green Bay Packers beating the Detroit Lions by 2 points, while the Chicago Bears were beaten 17–3 by the New York Giants.\nIn the days leading to their Week 5 game, the Vikings pulled off a dramatic trade, acquiring receiver Randy Moss from the New England Patriots. The move reunited Moss with the team that drafted him in 1998 and came after Moss caught 50 touchdowns with New England, including a one-handed touchdown catch against the Jets four weeks earlier.\nWeek 5: at New York Jets\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 5: Minnesota Vikings at New York Jets&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=October 11\n|time=8:15&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=0 |R2=0 |R3=7 |R4=13\n|home=Jets\n|H1=3 |H2=6 |H3=6 |H4=14\n|stadium=New Meadowlands Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey\n|attendance=77,909\n|weather=Cloudy,\n|referee=Pete Morelli (135)\n|TV=ESPN\n|TVAnnouncers=Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, Jon Gruden, Michele Tafoya and Suzy Kolber\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-jets-2010-reg-5 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/54938/NYJ_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*NYJ – Nick Folk 25-yard field goal, 4:55.

Minnesota trailed early in the first quarter as Jets kicker Nick Folk got a 25-yard field goal. The Vikings' deficit increased in the second quarter as Folk made a 53-yard and a 22-yard field goal.\nMinnesota's frustrations continued in the third quarter as Folk got a 34-yard field goal. The Vikings would respond as quarterback Brett Favre threw his 500th career touchdown pass by finding wide receiver Randy Moss on a 37-yard touchdown pass, but New York answered with Folk's 31-yard field goal. After the delay at the end of the third quarter due to adverse weather conditions the Vikings would strike back in the fourth quarter as Favre found wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 34-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion), but the Jets replied with a 23-yard touchdown run from running back Shonn Greene. Minnesota tried to rally as Favre found Harvin again on an 11-yard touchdown pass, but New York would put the game away as cornerback Dwight Lowery returned an interception 26 yards for a touchdown.\nWeek 6: vs. Dallas Cowboys\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 6: Dallas Cowboys at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=October 17\n|time=3:15&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Cowboys\n|R1=7 |R2=7 |R3=0 |R4=7\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=7 |H2=0 |H3=14 |H4=3\n|stadium=Mall of America Field at Hubert H.

Minnesota trailed early in the first quarter as Packers running back Brandon Jackson got a 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, the Vikings responded as wide receiver Percy Harvin got a 17-yard touchdown run. Green Bay struck back in the second quarter as quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Andrew Quarless, yet Minnesota took the lead with running back Adrian Peterson getting a 1-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell booting a 28-yard field goal after a bizarre reversal of a touchdown reception by Visanthe Shiancoe.\nThe Packers began the third quarter with Rodgers completing a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings, followed by linebacker Desmond Bishop returning a Favre interception 32 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings would answer with Favre finding wide receiver Randy Moss on a 4-yard touchdown pass. Minnesota tried to rally in the fourth quarter with an apparent 30-yard touchdown pass from Favre to Harvin with 48 seconds left, which would have been the game winner, but Harvin had only one foot in bounds, nullifying the touchdown. Favre tried two more times to get into the end zone, but Green Bay's defense held for the win.\nWeek 8: at New England Patriots\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 8: Minnesota Vikings at New England Patriots&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=October 31\n|time=3:15&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=0 |R2=7 |R3=3 |R4=8\n|home=Patriots\n|H1=0 |H2=7 |H3=14 |H4=7\n|stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|attendance=68,756\n|weather=Partly cloudy,\n|referee=Walt Anderson (66)\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Thom Brennaman, Troy Aikman and Pam Oliver\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-patriots-2010-reg-8 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/54835/NE_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*No scoring plays.\nSecond quarter\n*MIN – Adrian Peterson 1-yard run (Ryan Longwell kick), 14:57.

The Vikings came into the game wearing their purple pants and played the Cardinals in what was arguably a desperation game not only for the season, but head coach Brad Childress' job. His job had become more scrutinized after he acted alone to cut wide receiver Randy Moss, which drew a bunch of boos and jeers at Childress. However, the action did not start until the 2nd quarter, when the Vikings drove down the field and had a 2nd and goal. Favre threw to Peterson behind the line, but Peterson dodged a few players and got into the end zone, which made the game 7–0 in the 2nd quarter. The very next play, when the Vikings kicked off, Stephens-Howling returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown which tied the game. After that, the Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 21-yard field goal. They fell behind with quarterback Derek Anderson completing a 30-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Andre Roberts to close out the first half. This was followed by defensive back Michael Adams returning a Percy Harvin kickoff fumble 30 yards for a touchdown, and with kicker Jay Feely making a 22-yard field goal. The lead was closed down by Peterson as he got a 4-yard touchdown run, and by quarterback Brett Favre's 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. In overtime the decision was made when Longwell successfully made a 35-yard field goal to give the Vikings the win, bringing their record up to 3–5 and temporarily saving their quarterback's and head coach's jobs.\nWeek 10: at Chicago Bears\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 10: Minnesota Vikings at Chicago Bears&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=November 14\n|time=12:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=3 |R2=7 |R3=3 |R4=0\n|home=Bears\n|H1=0 |H2=14 |H3=6 |H4=7\n|stadium=Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois\n|attendance=62,206\n|weather=Partly cloudy,\n|referee=Tony Corrente (99)\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Kenny Albert, Daryl Johnston and Tony Siragusa\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-bears-2010-reg-10 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/54855/CHI_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*MIN – Ryan Longwell 36-yard field goal, 3:30.

On their first series, quarterback Brett Favre attempted a pass, but he was hit from behind and was intercepted by Bills cornerback Drayton Florence. Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak. In his place, backup quarterback Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game. They got off to a bad start after Jackson's pass was intercepted by cornerback Drayton Florence and returned 40 yards for a touchdown. They overcame this deficit with Jackson getting a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sidney Rice. It was originally ruled an interception, but Frazier challenged the play and the officials sided with the Vikings, saying that Rice had two hands on the ball, resulting in a touchdown. It was followed in the second quarter by running back Adrian Peterson getting a 2-yard and a 3-yard touchdown run. Then Jackson found Rice again on a 6-yard touchdown pass, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 38-yard field goal. They continued to dominate in the fourth quarter when Peterson ran 43 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. The Bills responded with quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick getting a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end David Nelson. However, the Bills were unable to overcome such a large deficit and couldn't come up with another come-from-behind victory.\nWeek 14: vs. New York Giants\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 14: New York Giants at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=December 13 (rescheduled from December 12)\n|time=6:20&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Giants\n|R1=0 |R2=14 |R3=7 |R4=0\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=3 |H2=0 |H3=0 |H4=0\n|stadium=Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan (moved from the Metrodome due to the roof collapse)\n|attendance=45,910\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|referee=Jeff Triplette (42)\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Joe Buck, Troy Aikman and Pam Oliver\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/giants-at-vikings-2010-reg-14 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55015/MIN_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*MIN – Ryan Longwell 21-yard field goal, 5:25.

The roof later collapsed, forcing the NFL to use Ford Field in Detroit as an alternate site. Despite the one-day delay, Brett Favre was listed as inactive for the game due to his shoulder injury. With the loss, the Vikings dropped to 5–8, and were mathematically eliminated from postseason contention.\nWeek 15: vs. Chicago Bears\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 15: Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=December 20\n|time=7:30&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Bears\n|R1=10 |R2=7 |R3=20 |R4=3\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=7 |H2=0 |H3=7 |H4=0\n|stadium=TCF Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, Minnesota (moved from the Metrodome due to the roof collapse)\n|attendance=40,504\n|weather=Snow,\n|referee=Carl Cheffers (51)\n|TV=ESPN\n|TVAnnouncers=Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, Jon Gruden, Michele Tafoya and Suzy Kolber\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/bears-at-vikings-2010-reg-15 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55039/MIN_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*MIN – Percy Harvin 23-yard pass from Brett Favre (Ryan Longwell kick), 11:22.

In the first quarter the Vikings took the lead with quarterback Brett Favre throwing a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Percy Harvin. However, they failed to maintain this lead after kickier Robbie Gould made a 29-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Jay Cutler completing a 67 and a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receivers Johnny Knox and Devin Hester respectively, then with Gould nailing a 23-yard field goal. The Vikings caused more problems after a three-and-out converted into a 64-yard punt return for a touchdown by Hester. They tried to break the lead with quarterback Joe Webb scrambling 13 yards for a touchdown, but they continued to struggle after Cutler got a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Rashied Davis, followed by Gould hitting a 34 and a 20-yard field goal. The loss dropped the Vikings to 5–9, securing them their first losing season since 2006.\nWeek 16: at Philadelphia Eagles\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 16: Minnesota Vikings at Philadelphia Eagles&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=December 28 (rescheduled from December 26)\n|time=7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=0 |R2=7 |R3=10 |R4=7\n|home=Eagles\n|H1=7 |H2=0 |H3=0 |H4=7\n|stadium=Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n|attendance=69,144\n|weather=Partly cloudy,\n|referee=Mike Carey (94)\n|TV=NBC\n|TVAnnouncers=Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth and Andrea Kremer\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-eagles-2010-reg-16 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55048/PHI_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*PHI – Clay Harbor 3-yard pass from Michael Vick (David Akers kick), 7:42.

This was the 20th NFL game to be played on a Tuesday, and the first since 1946. This was also the first Tuesday game in Vikings franchise history.\nTrying to snap a two-game losing streak, the Vikings flew to Lincoln Financial Field for a Week 16 intraconference duel with the Philadelphia Eagles on Tuesday night. Minnesota trailed in the first quarter as Eagles quarterback Michael Vick completed a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Clay Harbor. The Vikings answered in the second quarter with cornerback Antoine Winfield returning a fumble 45 yards for a touchdown.\nMinnesota took the lead in the third quarter with a 30-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell, followed by a 9-yard touchdown run from rookie quarterback Joe Webb. Philadelphia struck back with Vick getting a 10-yard touchdown run which cut the lead to a field goal, but the Vikings came right back with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Adrian Peterson.\nWeek 17: at Detroit Lions\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 17: Minnesota Vikings at Detroit Lions&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=January 2\n|time=12:00&nbsp;p.m.\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=0 |R2=0 |R3=7 |R4=6\n|home=Lions\n|H1=0 |H2=10 |H3=3 |H4=7\n|stadium=Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan\n|attendance=57,013\n|weather=None (indoor stadium)\n|referee=Walt Anderson (66)\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Ron Pitts and John Lynch\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-lions-2010-reg-17 Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55059/DET_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*No scoring plays.\nSecond quarter\n*DET – Dave Rayner 55-yard field goal, 6:45.

In the second quarter the Vikings trailed early as kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 55-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Shaun Hill completing a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Nate Burleson, followed by Rayner making a 37-yard field goal. The Vikings got on the board too as an interception was returned 36 yards for a touchdown by defensive end Jared Allen. This was followed by kicker Ryan Longwell hitting a 27-yard field goal. Detroit extended their lead with running back Maurice Morris getting a 5-yard touchdown run. The Vikings tried to come back, but only came away with a 48-yard field goal from Longwell, giving the Vikings a loss and thus closing out the season on a 6–10 record.\nStandings\nStatistics\nTeam leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Player(s)\n!width=75px style=\"\"| Value\n|-\n| Passing yards || Brett Favre || 2,509\n|-\n| Passing touchdowns || Brett Favre || 11\n|-\n| Rushing yards || Adrian Peterson || 1,298\n|-\n| Rushing touchdowns || Adrian Peterson || 12\n|-\n| Receiving yards || Percy Harvin || 868\n|-\n| Receiving touchdowns || Percy Harvin || 5\n|-\n| Points || Ryan Longwell || 81\n|-\n| Kickoff return yards || Percy Harvin || 933\n|-\n| Punt return yards || Greg Camarillo || 359\n|-\n| Tackles || Chad Greenway || 144\n|-\n| Sacks || Jared Allen || 11.0\n|-\n| Interceptions || Husain AbdullahE.

He missed out on the NFC's starting lineup to the Atlanta Falcons' Michael Turner, and was joined on the bench by the St. Louis Rams' Steven Jackson. Peterson received the most fan votes out of all running backs in the NFL (948,410), and the sixth most out of all players, behind five quarterbacks.\nAfter the Detroit Lions' rookie defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh went for surgery on an injured shoulder, Kevin Williams was called up as an alternate. However, due to the imminent arrival of a new baby to him and his wife, Williams himself withdrew from the roster on January 22; he was replaced by the Arizona Cardinals' DT Darnell Dockett. Two days later, CB Antoine Winfield was added to the NFC Pro Bowl roster to replace the Green Bay Packers' Charles Woodson and Tramon Williams, both of whom withdrew due to their participation in Super Bowl XLV. The final Viking to be added to the NFC roster was LB E. J. Henderson, who received his first career Pro Bowl selection. Coming in as injury cover for San Francisco's Patrick Willis and Chicago's Brian Urlacher, Henderson travelled to Hawaii, but did not take the field.\nNotes\n}}\nReferences"
