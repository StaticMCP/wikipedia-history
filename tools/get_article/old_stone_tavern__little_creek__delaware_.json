The main section was built about 1829, and is a two-story, five-bay, stone Georgian-style structure.  It has a gable roof with brick cornice and dormers.  A -story brick kitchen wing is attached.  It was thought to have been a tavern by the local community, but records have shown that it was always a dwelling house.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\nReferences"
