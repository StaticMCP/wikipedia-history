He subsequently became a journalist with the Central Press, then the Western Daily Press, and from 1963 the Daily Express.  At the Express, he was a political reporter, diplomatic correspondent and finally foreign editor, before becoming an assistant editor of the Daily Mail in 1972, and associate editor in 1974.\nIn 1972, the Daily Express reported a \"world exclusive\" that Martin Bormann, Hitler's deputy, was living in South America.  After six days, the story was found to be a hoax.  Steven left for the Daily Mail.  In 1977, he took responsibility for the publication of a false story claiming that British Leyland had a fund to pay bribes.\nIn 1982, he became editor of the Mail on Sunday, serving until 1992, when he became editor of the Evening Standard.  In 1995, he printed a story critical of Tony Blair under the name of Bryan Gould, a former member of the Labour Party's shadow cabinet; in fact, Conservative Party Home Secretary Michael Howard's teenage son Nick had written the article.  Steven retired later in the year, serving as the last chairman of Punch and on the board of the London Film Commission.\nSteven continued to write a weekly column for the Mail on Sunday until the time of his death.\nSteven was an early enthusiast for the London Eye.  He enjoyed cricket and rugby. He supported the arts, both personally and in his newspapers.\nWhen he married Inka Sobieniewska, a half-Russian, half-Polish pop singer in 1965, he adopted her son and raised him as his own.  Inka took up painting after retiring from music.  At the time of his death, he was caring for her as she suffered from multiple sclerosis.\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
