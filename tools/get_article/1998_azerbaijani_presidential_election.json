The result was a victory for Heydar Aliyev of the New Azerbaijan Party, who received 78% of the vote. Voter turnout was reported to be 79%.\nThe election occurred under the context in which Heydar Aliyev had cemented \"complete political control\" of Azerbaijan, as his party controlled the legislature and the state dominated the media. The main opposition parties in Azerbaijan boycotted the election with the exception of Etibar Mammadov. Election monitors noted that there was a ballot stuffing and allegations of fabricated vote counts. After the election, Mammadov appealed the election to Azerbaijan's Supreme Court, which rejected his appeal.\nAn independent assessment of the vote put the outcome at 50-60% for Aliyev and 25% for Mammadov.\nResults\nReferences"
