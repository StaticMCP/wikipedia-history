The game also had exclusive rights for boxers Muhammad Ali, Evander Holyfield, Sugar Ray Leonard and Oscar De La Hoya.\nReception\n| EGM = 7.125/10\n| EPD = 5.5/10\n| GI = 6/10\n| GameRev = B−\n| GSpot = 7.7/10\n| IGN = 7.3/10\n| MF = 76%\n| NGen =\n| OPM =\n| PSM =\n| rev1 = The Cincinnati Enquirer\n| rev1Score =\n}}\nThe game received average reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Next Generation said, \"Ultimately, the game tries very hard to capture the authenticity of the sport, and it is noteworthy that it is the first to present multiple weight classes. It seems fitting the only boxer EA didn't license for Knockout Kings (other than [[Mike Tyson|[Mike] Tyson]]) was Marlon Brando's character from the film On the Waterfront. Like Brando's character, this game 'could've been a contender.'\" GamePro, however, said, \"An exciting, fun, and competitive game, Knockout Kings will have you out of your seat cheering and talking smack – even during one-player bouts. Buying the game's not only cheaper than most boxing pay-per-views, but a lot more entertaining.\"\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
