The party participated in five national elections (1969, 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1989), but managed to gain representation in the National Assembly only twice (1969 and 1974), both times winning only one seat.\nIn 1994, the BIP merged with the Botswana Freedom Party (BFP) to form the Independence Freedom Party (IFP) under the leadership of Motsamai Mpho. The IFP won only 3% of the vote and no seats in elections held on 15 October 1994. Soon after, the IFP ceased to exist.\nThe party advocated for pan-africanism,\nsocial democracy,\ncentrism and later for\nliberalism and neoliberalism\nElectoral results\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!
