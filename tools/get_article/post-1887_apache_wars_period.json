The 10th Cavalry and 4th Cavalry forces under First Lieutenant James W. Watson pursued mounted Apache warriors north of Globe, Arizona, along the Salt River. Sergeant James T. Daniels, Company L., 4th Cavalry and Sergeant William McBryar, Troop K., 10th Cavalry, are the last-known recipients of the Medal of Honor for actions during the Apache Wars. Both were cited for \"extreme courage and heroism\" while under attack by hostile Apaches, on March 7, 1890. Sergeant Y. B. Rowdy, Troop A, of the Indian Scouts, was also decorated with the medal on the same date.\nThe last Apache raid into the United States occurred as late as 1924 when a band of natives stole some horses from Arizonan settlers. The Apaches were caught and arrested.\nThe Mexican Indian Wars that involved Apache bands in Northern Mexico continued for another nine years, until the final holdouts were defeated in 1933.\nSee also\n* Kelvin Grade massacre, 1889\n* Cherry Creek campaign, 1890\n* Apache Campaign (1896)\nReferences"
