As of 2021, the LDS Church reported 102,862 members in 269 congregations in the DRC, making it the third largest body of LDS Church members in Africa, behind Nigeria and Ghana. Currently, the DRC ranks as having the 16th highest LDS growth rate among countries of the world, with an annual growth rate of 13 percent.\nHistory\n|type        =\n|align       =\n|direction   =\n|width       =\n|state       =\n|shading     =\n|pop_name    = Membership\n|percentages = off\n|footnote  = *Membership was published as a rounded number.\n|source   =\n|1988*|400\n|1989*|1,400\n|1995*|5,300\n|1999|8,197\n|2004|14,991\n|2009|20,883\n|2014|42,689\n|2019|68,871\n|2022|102,862\n|2024|134,067\n}}\nThe LDS Church was first recognized in Zaire in 1986. That year the first missionaries began preaching in Kinshasa. The establishment of the church was aided by the Banza family, who had joined the church while studying at a university in Geneva, Switzerland. The third petitioner to establish the church that year was Nkitabungi Mbuyi, who had joined while studying in Belgium and subsequently served as a missionary for the church in England before his return to Zaire. The church has grown quickly since then, with the first stake being organised in 1996.\nSince establishing itself in the country, the LDS Church has played a large role in providing humanitarian aid services in the nation. This has involved installing clean water distribution systems in areas where sanitation and water are low.\nIn 2011, it was reported that the church had reached a total of 100 congregations in the DRC.\nBy late 2019, the church had 22 stakes and one district as well as several branches directly under missions in the DRC.\nStakes\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n!
