The culture developed from the local Bell Beaker culture, possibly with further migrations from central Europe. According to Sergent (1995) the Rhône culture represents a southern variant of the Unetice culture. Rhône culture metalwork and pottery are particularly similar to those of the Straubing group in Bavaria.\nArtefacts and characteristics\nThe Thun-Renzenbühl axe\nThe Thun-Renzenbühl axe (), found near Thun and attributed to the Rhône culture, is one of the earliest examples of the use of damascening technique in the world. The gold inlay decoration on the axe may also have a numerical, astronomical meaning.\nGallery\nFile:Rhodanian knife-MGR Lyon-IMG 9738.jpg\nFile:Poignard et hache en bronze - Solliès Pont - Var.jpg\nFile:Vollgriffdolch von Döttingen.jpg\nFile:Età del bronzo arcaica, pugnali, 2200-1600 ac ca..JPG\nFile:Rhone 1.jpg\nFile:Bronze pin.jpg\nFile:Scheibenkopfnadeln.jpg|Dress pins with sun cross symbol, 2000-1600 BC\nFile:Rhône culture bronze armband.jpg\nFile:Necklace IMG 4995.JPG\nFile:Età del bronzo,armi e oggetti da una tomba del 1800 ac circa, da thun 02.JPG\nFile:Età del bronzo,armi e oggetti da una tomba del 1800 ac circa, da thun 04.JPG\nFile:Età del bronzo,armi e oggetti da una tomba del 1800 ac circa, da thun 03.JPG\nSee also\n* Únětice culture\n* Bronze Age Britain\n* Armorican Tumulus culture\n* Polada culture\n* Pyrenean Bronze\n* Ottomány culture\n* Wietenberg culture\n* Tumulus culture\n* Nordic Bronze Age\nReferences\nExternal links"
