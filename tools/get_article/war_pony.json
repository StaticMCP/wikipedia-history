Over the course of several years, the project began to take shape, through writing workshops, improvisation sessions, and meeting hundreds of locals in the community, to make the story authentic. The group began discussing an idea for a film revolving around two indigenous locals growing up on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. They began writing the script based upon Bob and Reddy's life experiences and stories they had heard, ending up with too much material, and decided to split the story between two characters, and collaborated with local producer Willi White.\nRelease\nThe film had its world premiere at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival on May 21, 2022, in the Un Certain Regard section. It won the Caméra d'Or for Best First Film, while the lead animal actor, Brit, won the Palm Dog award.
