Oregon voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote, pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her running mate Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. Oregon has seven electoral votes in the Electoral College.\nThe Democratic presidential candidate has won Oregon in every election since 1988. Clinton continued this tradition, carrying the state with 50% of the vote, a slightly reduced margin from Barack Obama in 2012, but with a slightly higher raw vote total, becoming only the second presidential candidate to win more than a million votes in the process. Trump received 39% of the vote, a smaller proportion of the vote compared to that of Mitt Romney in 2012. However, he did achieve a notable feat in carrying Columbia County, becoming the first Republican to do so since Herbert Hoover in 1928. In addition, this was also the first presidential election since 1976 in which Clackamas County backed the losing candidate, with Trump becoming the first Republican ever to win the White House without carrying the county.\nPrimaries and Caucuses\nOregon held its presidential primaries on May 17, 2016.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic primary\nTwo candidates appeared on the Democratic presidential primary ballot:\n*Bernie Sanders\n*Hillary Clinton\nThe 74 delegates from Oregon were allocated in this way. 41 delegates were allocated based on the popular vote in each congressional district with district 2 split (district 2 was split because of its size with district 2a including the northern part of the district and 2b containing the southern part of the district). Another 20 delegates were allocated proportionally based on the statewide popular vote. The state also had 13 super delegates.\nRepublican primary\nSix candidates appeared on the Republican presidential primary ballot:\n* Jeb Bush (withdrawn)\n* Ben Carson (withdrawn)\n* Ted Cruz (withdrawn)\n* John Kasich (withdrawn)\n* Marco Rubio (withdrawn)\n* Donald Trump\nThe 28 delegates from Oregon were allocated proportionally based on the statewide popular vote.\nGreen primary\nThis state's Green Party held its presidential preference vote on May 21.\nOn May 22, it was announced that Jill Stein had won the preference vote.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Oregon Green Party presidential convention, April 17, 2016\n|-\n!

Since then, however, the Democratic candidate has carried the state in every election, including a narrow victory in the 2000 election. The last statewide election won by a Republican candidate was in the 2002 Senate election, all statewide elected officials as of election day were Democrats, and Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney by 12.09% in the 2012 election. Generally, Eastern Oregon is more conservative, while Western Oregon is more liberal.\nPolling\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton won every pre-election poll conducted in the state except one and led by margins of 7 to 13 points in most polls. The average of the final 3 polls showed Hillary Clinton leading Trump 44% to 36%.\nResults\n}}\nHillary Clinton carried the state, lengthening the Democratic streak in Oregon to 8 straight contests.\nBy county\n{| width=\"60%\"  class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"| County\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"
