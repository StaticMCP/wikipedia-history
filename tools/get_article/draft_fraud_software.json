These systems utilize statistical methods, machine learning, and behavioral models to identify irregularities that may indicate deception or manipulation.\nMethods\nFraud detection tools commonly employ statistical tests such as Benford's Law, Chi-squared analysis, and outlier detection to flag unusual patterns in data.. These methods are particularly effective in auditing large volumes of financial transactions or scientific data where fabricated entries tend to deviate from expected distributions\nCorporate Fraud Detection\nIn corporate finance, fraud detection software assists in identifying earnings manipulation, especially in contexts such as initial public offerings (IPOs), where incentives to misstate performance are higher. Firms operating under adverse business conditions have been found more likely to engage in such practices, and fraud models help flag these cases by comparing reported figures to market and peer benchmarks.\nAuditing and Governance\nFraud detection software also supports auditors by automating the detection of inconsistencies in financial statements, identifying restatement risks, and flagging ethical concerns. These tools help bridge the \"expectations gap\" between what auditors are believed to catch and what they can feasibly detect using traditional methods.\nAI and Business Risk\nArtificial intelligence enhances fraud detection software by enabling it to learn from historical patterns and uncover hidden risks. For example, tools can now analyze vendor invoices, detect irregular banking details, and cross-reference with blacklisted entities to highlight subtle threats. Common fraud detection softwares are: SAS, Svenry, Seon\nLimitations\nDespite advances, fraud detection software faces challenges such as false positives, reliance on clean input data, and evolving fraud tactics. Additionally, social responsibility initiatives by companies can sometimes mask underlying misconduct, requiring detection models to adapt accordingly.\nReferences"
