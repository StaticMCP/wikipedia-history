The song was written by Nosie Katzmann, Jay Supreme, Torsten Fenslau and Peter Zweier, and produced by Fenslau. The lyrics describes the feeling of not getting over someone you once were in love with, hence the refrain Got to get it, got to get it out of my head. It was released as the second single from the album on 13 September 1993 by German label Dance Pool and was a hit in most European countries, peaking at number-one in both Belgium and Finland. The single was also a top-five hit in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK. In the UK, the US and Canada, the song peaked at number one on the dance music charts. Its music video was directed by Martin Person and filmed in Denmark and Portugal, telling the story of two lovers breaking up.\nCritical reception\nAllMusic editor William Cooper viewed \"Got to Get It\" as a \"virtual rewrite\" of \"Mr. Vain\". Larry Flick from Billboard described it as a \"wickedly catchy twirler that appears poised to follow the trend-setting \"Mr. Vain\" to the top of club playlists and on to top 40 formats\". He added, \"The song's hook will instantly stick to the brain, while the plethora of pop/rave beats will sneak up the spine.\" He also felt that it sports a better chorus than its predecessor and \"aggressive, synth-soaked beats\", and said the \"blend of party-down male rapping and cute female-belting is familiar and fun.\" Alan Jones from Music Week gave it four out of five and named it Pick of the Week, commenting, \"Got to get it out of my head they sing, and you'll be thinking the same when you hear this surefire hit follow-up\", where \"throbbing Hi-NRG, though with a light vocal touch, and a typical Snap!-style rap all come together to create an instant and likeable smash.\"\nIestyn George from NME felt the song is not as catchy as \"Mr. Vain\". James Hamilton from the Record Mirror Dance Update declared it as \"another overly similar bland synth buzzed chugger\". Mike Soutar from Smash Hits also gave the song four out of five. He felt it was better than \"Mr. Vain\", saying, \"So it is with great surprise that I actually find myself liking \"Got to Get It\". Buzzy, fast, with a smashing whiplash sample, it's a corking dance tune that's approximately 50 times better than 2 Unlimited's \"Faces\".\" Sunday Mirror wrote, \"After a day spent humming Culture Beat's incredibly catchy follow up to their chart-topper \"Mr Vain\", you'll agree with the lyric, Got to get it out of my head.\" The reviewer concluded with that the song is \"high-energy pop\" and \"a surefire smash both on the dance floor and in the charts.\"\nChart performance\nIn Europe, \"Got to Get It\" peaked at number one in both Belgium and Finland.\n* Week 2:\n* Week 3:\n* Week 4: |name=\"finland\"}} In Belgium, it peaked at number one for two weeks, staying within the Ultratop Flanders singles chart for a total of 17 weeks.
