A Southern Democrat, he previously served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 2008 to 2015. Edwards represented parts of the Florida Parishes and served as minority leader from 2012 to 2015.\nEdwards graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1988 with a Bachelor of Science in engineering and served in the United States Army as an infantry officer for eight years. In 1996, he was honorably discharged with the rank of Captain. After leaving the Army, Edwards attended and graduated from LSU Law. Following his tenure as a law clerk to Judge James L. Dennis, he returned home to Amite and began his career as a lawyer in private practice.\nFirst elected to the Louisiana House in 2007, Edwards became Democratic minority leader in 2012. He defeated Republican U.S. Senator David Vitter in the second round of the 2015 gubernatorial election, and became Louisiana governor in January 2016. During his first term, Edwards expanded protections for LGBTQ people in the workplace, enacted Medicaid expansion, signed legislation to reduce Louisiana's prison population, and implemented a six-week abortion ban. He won a second term in 2019, becoming the first Democrat to win reelection as governor of Louisiana since Edwin Edwards (no relation) in 1975. In his second term, Edwards was governor during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Nicholas. He also signed legislation requiring public schools to display the national motto \"In God We Trust\" in classrooms. After leaving office in 2024, Edwards joined the New Orleans–based law firm Fishman Haygood LLP, where his practice focuses primarily on renewable energy litigation.\nSome political observers have described Edwards as a conservative Democrat. Edwards has also been described as a moderate and as a populist. He is the most recent Democrat to win or hold statewide office in Louisiana.\nEarly life and education\nJohn Bel Edwards was born in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, on September 16, 1966. He was raised in Amite, Louisiana, the son of Dora Jean (née Miller) and Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff Frank M. Edwards, Jr. Born into an economically and politically well-established family in the parish, he graduated from Amite High School in 1984 as valedictorian.\nIn 1988, Edwards received a Bachelor of Science in engineering from the United States Military Academy, where he was on the Dean's List and served as vice chairman of the panel that enforced the West Point honor code.\nEdwards completed Airborne School in 1986, while a student at West Point. After receiving his commission, he completed the Infantry Officer Basic Course at Fort Benning in 1988, Ranger School in 1989, and the Infantry Officer Advanced Course in 1992.\nEdwards served in the United States Army for eight years, mostly in the 25th Infantry Division and 82nd Airborne Division. He commanded a company in the 82nd's 3rd Brigade, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment. Edwards ultimately ended his military career to return to Louisiana because of family considerations.\nLegal career\nAfter leaving the Army, Edwards pursued a legal education at Louisiana State University's Paul M. Hebert Law Center (LSU Law). He received his J.D. degree in 1999, and after graduation clerked for Judge James L. Dennis of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\nEdwards went on to become a practicing attorney with the Edwards & Associates law firm in Amite. He handled a variety of cases, but did not practice criminal law because his brother was the local sheriff. His nephew, Bradley Stevens, worked at the firm as a law partner.\nLouisiana House of Representatives\nIn 2007, Edwards ran for a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives and was forced into a general election runoff with fellow attorney George Tucker. Edwards won every parish in the district. He was the only freshman lawmaker to chair a committee, the Veterans Affairs Committee, in the legislature. Edwards was also selected as chair of the Democratic House caucus, a rarity for a freshman legislator. Edwards criticized Governor Bobby Jindal for his frequent trips away from Louisiana to raise funds for Republicans elsewhere while Louisiana had been reducing its funding for higher education.\nIn 2011, Edwards was reelected to the Louisiana House of Representatives, defeating Johnny Duncan, 83% to 17%. He chaired the Louisiana House Democratic Caucus, making him the House Minority Leader. Cities and towns that Edwards represented included Amite, Greensburg, and Kentwood as well as part of Hammond.\nGovernor of Louisiana\nElections\n2015\nOn February 21, 2013, Edwards announced his candidacy for governor in 2015. He said that Louisiana needed \"a healthy dose of common sense and compassion for ordinary people\". The only major Democrat in the race, Edwards polled first in the nonpartisan blanket primary with 444,517 votes (39.9%), followed by Vitter, who finished second with 256,300 votes (23%). In third place was Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle of Breaux Bridge, who received 214,982 votes (19.3%).\nA JMC Analytics poll before the primary showed Edwards with a nine-point lead over Vitter, 28% to 19%. After the primary polls showed Edwards with a commanding lead. Market Research Insight pollster Verne Kennedy placed Edwards ahead, 54% to 38% or 51% to 40%, depending on the level of turnout among African-American voters, 25% or 20%.\nEdwards won the November 21 runoff with 56.1% of the vote. The New York Times noted that the gubernatorial race was one \"that many other Democrats once considered hopeless\" early in the cycle.\n2019\nIn 2019, Edwards ran for reelection to a second term as governor. In the runoff election, he faced Republican businessman Eddie Rispone. As Louisiana voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, the race drew national attention after Trump visited the state multiple times on Rispone's behalf.\nEdwards ultimately defeated Rispone, 51.33% to 48.67%. His victory made him the first Democratic governor of Louisiana to be elected to a second consecutive term in over four decades, since Edwin Edwards in 1975.\nTenure\n, March 2016]]\nDonald Trump in April 2020]]\nin September 2021]]\nSome political observers have described Edwards as a conservative Democrat. Edwards has also been described as a moderate and as a populist. In December 2018, Matt Malone, S.J., of America stated that Edwards held \"progressive views on economics\", a \"commitment to a strong social safety net\", and \"moderate views on some social issues\", adding that he is \"anti-abortion, pro-Second Amendment, [and] pro-L.G.B.T. civil rights...\"\nOn his inauguration day, Edwards failed to persuade the majority-Republican Louisiana House to choose a Democrat, Walt Leger III of New Orleans, as Speaker. On the second ballot, after Republican Cameron Henry, an ally of Vitter, withdrew from consideration, a second Republican, Taylor Barras of New Iberia, was named Speaker. Since Huey Long, governors had traditionally handpicked the state house speakers. Barras's selection was considered a surprise because he had not been mentioned as a candidate until the voting started.\nOn April 13, 2016, Edwards signed an executive order to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people from harassment or job dismissals. The order prohibits state agencies from discrimination based on either gender identity or sexual orientation. The order allows an exception for religious organizations that claim that compliance would violate their religious beliefs. \"We respect our fellow citizens for their beliefs, but we do not discriminate based on our disagreements. I believe in giving every Louisianan the opportunity to be successful and to thrive in our state\", Edwards said.\nEdwards also rescinded another executive order issued in 2015 by his predecessor, Bobby Jindal, which protected businesses and nonprofit organizations that oppose same-sex marriage from being legally punished for acting on those views. This order had prohibited state agencies from penalizing businesses and individuals who refuse or limit service because of a \"religious belief that marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman.\"\nIn 2016, Edwards enacted Medicaid expansion. By the next year, the number of Louisianans without health insurance was cut in half (11.4%, down from 22.7%). According to a study conducted by LSU's E.J. Ourso College of Business, Edwards's Medicaid expansion made over 500,000 more adults eligible for Medicaid, of whom 327,000 were uninsured.\nEdwards promised early in 2017 that he could work with the incoming Donald Trump administration. He expressed eagerness to work with the Trump Cabinet, particularly on Medicaid expansion and federal infrastructure projects.\nIn January 2017, Edwards traveled to Italy on a personal trip to discuss ways to combat human trafficking. He traveled with members of the Hospitaller Sisters of Mercy, who established a shelter in Baton Rouge for child victims of human trafficking. Edwards met with Pope Francis during the trip.\nEdwards campaigned on a policy to reduce Louisiana's prison population. One of his first actions as governor was to commute 22 sentences out of 56 that the state's Board of Pardons had identified for him. Since the end of 2016 and to July 2018, Edwards did not sign a single commutation despite at least 70 cases that the state's Board of Pardons identified for him during the period. In 2018, Edwards signed legislation that shortened the sentences for nonviolent, non-sex-crime offenders who showed good behavior while in prison.\nIn May 2018, Edwards signed a bill into law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In May 2019, he signed an even more restrictive six-week abortion ban, although a similar bill in the 5th Circuit, one with a similar predecessor, was blocked by Judge Carlton Reeves in the Southern District of Mississippi. In response to backlash from his more progressive supporters, Edwards released a statement saying, \"As governor, I have been true to my word and my beliefs on this issue. But it is also my sincere belief that being pro-life means more than just being pro-birth.\" He referenced his attempts to expand investment in education, reform Louisiana's criminal justice system, pass laws to protect LGBT citizens from discrimination in the workplace, raise the minimum wage, and ensure equal pay for men and women.\nOn May 22, 2018, Edwards signed an executive order requiring state vendors to certify that they are not boycotting Israel and will not for the duration of the contract boycott Israel. In 2019, the bill HB 245 was enacted, codifying the executive order. The Copy, Paste, Legislate investigation found that Edwards did not write the executive order nor the press release accompanying it. Instead, they were sent to him by a person with ties to AIPAC and the Israel Action Network.\nIn late 2018, Edwards said that his top priority for 2019 was to achieve a $1,000 pay raise for teachers and a $500 raise for school support workers. For the first time in 10 years, the House passed a budget that included pay raises for teachers and support staff.\nOn September 8, 2021, Edwards delayed all upcoming Louisiana elections five weeks after excessive statewide infrastructure damage caused by Hurricane Ida. On September 12, 2021, less than two weeks after Ida crested, Edwards declared another statewide state of emergency in anticipation of Hurricane Nicholas. On January 5, 2022, Edwards pardoned Homer Plessy, subject of the 1896 U.S. Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld segregation laws.\nIn 2023, Edwards signed HB8, which requires public schools to display the national motto \"In God We Trust\" in classrooms.\nCabinet and administration\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"float:margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border:1px solid #000; font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#dcdcdc;\" colspan=\"3\"|The Edwards Cabinet\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|OFFICE||align=\"left\"|NAME||align=\"left\"|TERM\n|-\n! style=\"background:#000;\" colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Governor||align=\"left\" |John Bel Edwards||align=\"left\"|2016–2024\n|-\n! style=\"background:#000;\" colspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Chief of Staff||align=\"left\"|Ben Nevers\nMark Cooper\n| align=\"left\" |2016-2017\n2017–2024\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Commissioner of Administration||align=\"left\"|Jay Dardenne||align=\"left\"|2016–2024\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Executive Assistant to the Governor for Coastal Activities, Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Board Chairman||align=\"left\"|Chip Kline||align=\"left\"|2019–present\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Secretary of Economic Development||align=\"left\"|Don Pierson||align=\"left\"|2016–2024\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Secretary of Environmental Quality||align=\"left\"|Dr. Chuck Brown||align=\"left\"|2016–2024\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Director of the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness||align=\"left\"|Jim Waskom||align=\"left\"|2016–2024\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|Secretary of Health||align=\"left\"|Dr. Rebekah Gee||align=\"left\"|2016–2020\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| ||align=\"left\"|Courtney N.
