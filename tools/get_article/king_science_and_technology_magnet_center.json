In 1976, the school, under Omaha Public Schools' Desegregation Plan, became a site of forced busing from non-local neighborhoods.\nIn 1988, the school moved to Florence Boulevard, to the site of the former Horace Mann Middle School, and was reconstituted as King Science Center.  In 2003, technology was added as a magnet theme and the school gained its current name.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327170256/http://www.ops.org/middle/kingscience/ABOUTOURSCHOOL/tabid/53/Default.aspx Official site]"
