In 1938, Edwardstown merged with the Black Forest Football Club from the Adelaide and Suburban Football Association but retained the name Edwardstown.  For much of the first 60 years of its existence, the Edwardstown Football Club competed in the Glenelg-South Adelaide District Football League (previously known as the Glenelg-South-West District Football Association and the Mid-Southern Football Association), except for two seasons spent in the Adelaide and Suburban Football Association (1934–35).\nIn 1978, Edwardstown was a key player in the establishment of the South Australian Football Association (SAFA), a semi-professional league drawing on the stronger clubs of the former Norwood-North Football Association and some other strong metropolitan clubs.  Edwardstown won four premierships during the 18 years that the SAFA completion ran.  When SAFA folded at the end of the 1995 season, Edwardstown transferred to the South Australian Amateur Football League P1 competition.  In 2009, Edwardstown changed leagues once again, with their Senior teams shifting to the Southern Football League.\nIn 2012, Edwardstown attempted to shift its junior teams from the Metro South Junior Football League (MSJFL) to the Southern Football League, resulting in a breakaway group setting up a separate football club, the Edwardstown Junior Sports Club, in direct competition to the Edwardstown FC, drawing the majority of junior players from them and replacing them in the MSJFL.\nAt the end of the 2015 season, Edwardstown transferred back to the SAAFL, now known as the Channel 9 Adelaide Football League, being admitted into Division 4.\nEdwardstown FC has produced a number of Australian Football League (AFL) players including Hamish Hartlett (Port Adelaide), Danyle Pearce (Fremantle, Port Adelaide), Jordan Russell (Collingwood, Carlton), Adam Hartlett (Carlton) and Caleb Daniel (Western Bulldogs)\nClub song\nI hear the crowd\nBegin to cheer\nGet on your knees now ’cause there is a Townie near\nWill everyone here kindly step to the rear\nAnd let the Townies lead the way.\nWe show other clubs how the game should be played,\nThe goals should be made,\nThe teamwork really kills them,\nTowns are the best\nAnd unlike all the rest\nDetermination is our game,\nThe club men are great\nEvery fellow's your mate\nAnd we’d like you to join in and say,\nWould everyone here kindly step to the rear\nAnd let the Townies lead the way,\nAnd let the Townies lead the way!\nA-Grade Premierships\n* Glenelg District Football Association (8): 1932, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1948, 1949\n* Glenelg-South-West District Football Association (4): 1952, 1960, 1962, 1966\n* Glenelg-South Adelaide Football Association (2): 1973, 1977\n* South Australian Football Association (4): 1980, 1982, 1987, 1988\n* South Australian Amateur Football League Division 2 (1): 2004\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://edwardstownfc.com.au/  Edwardstown Football Club Website]"
