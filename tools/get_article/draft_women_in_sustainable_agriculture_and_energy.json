Despite this, women farmers produce 20–30% less than men due to limited access to land, credit, and technology. In the energy sector, women hold only 32% of jobs in renewables and remain underrepresented in technical and leadership positions. Furthermore, 2.3 billion people still rely on polluting fuels for cooking, exposing mostly women to health risks and time poverty. Closing these gender gaps through gender-responsive policies, equitable resource distribution, and women’s inclusion in clean energy innovation and agribusiness can raise productivity, improve livelihoods, and accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nHistorical Context\nThe history of women in climate change and agriculture highlights both their contribution and challenges in these areas. The existence of gender inequality contributes to these challenges, where women are disproportionately affected. Historical reflections highlight the significant impact of climate change on gender inequality. Studies report that women, particularly in the developing regions, are highly exposed and vulnerable to climate change due to the inaccessibility of climate-related resources. However, studies over the years have highlighted the significance of major contributions from women in the agriculture sector.\nWomen in Sustainable Agriculture\nThe quest for sustainable agriculture has been on the rise due to the numerous challenges posed by conventional farming methods. Women within the agricultural sector are the most vulnerable because they possess limited coping mechanisms when such misfortunes hit. It should be noted that, in the midst of such adversities, women stand tall in adopting practices that promote food security and protect the environment. They possess the capability to contribute to sustainable agriculture, and that can be attested by all.\nWomen are at the forefront of Climate-Smart Agriculture. With the adoption of practices that seek to help farmers adapt to the impact of climate change, women have shown that they can stand in the face of these extreme weather events and provide food for all. With women making up almost half of the agricultural workforce, it is unarguable that women are the backbone of the agriculture sector, and their contributions to sustainability will ensure that the sector thrives in this unpredictable era.\nWomen's involvement in sustainable agriculture can also be traced to the adoption of restoration practices, mostly observed in rural settings. Women who are growing trees and practicing Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration to protect and preserve nature. It is believed that women possess the knowledge that is passed down to generations yet unborn, thereby making them the best gender to involve themselves in adopting restoration.\nWomen in sustainable energy\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development highlights energy access and gender equality as key goals for ending poverty and promoting global well-being. Despite growing recognition of energy’s role in addressing gender inequalities, millions still lack electricity, and billions rely on harmful solid fuels for cooking and heating. To achieve true sustainability, energy access and gender equality must be treated as core priorities in global energy policies and practices.\nWomen play a crucial role in promoting sustainable energy consumption since they often manage household energy and influence related decisions. Involving women in designing and delivering clean energy technologies—like efficient stoves and lighting—can make these solutions more effective by aligning them with cultural and community needs. The energy sector, responsible for most global greenhouse gas emissions, faces major environmental challenges, particularly from solid fuel use in developing regions. While cleaner technologies and innovative business models are helping reduce energy intensity and emissions, further action is needed to keep global warming below 2°C. Empowering women in the energy transition can significantly cut household emissions and accelerate global decarbonization efforts.\nEnergy poverty affects women and girls more severely, as they are mainly responsible for collecting fuel and water and often work in informal sectors dependent on biomass energy. This exposes them to health risks like indoor air pollution, which causes millions of deaths annually, as well as physical strain and malnutrition due to heavy workloads and inadequate nutrition. The time spent gathering fuel creates “time poverty,” limiting opportunities for education, rest, and personal development. Expanding access to modern energy—such as electricity and efficient cookstoves—can reduce health risks, save time, and support girls’ education and empowerment. However, women continue to face barriers in accessing energy services, financing, and decision-making roles, leading to gender-blind policies and unequal participation in the energy sector.\nPolicy and Global Initiatives\nThere have been a number of global and regional initiatives that promote women's empowerment in sustainable agriculture and energy. These include;\n* Clean Cooking Alliance- which supports the efficient use of biomass to promote cleaner energy sources such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas and electricity.\n* The African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD)- which provides African women scientists in agriculture with professional development, enhancing leadership in agricultural science .\n* FAO’s Gender and Climate-Smart Agriculture Programme- which integrates gender equality and empowerment into climate adaptation planning.\n* The Green Climate Fund (GCF) and Global Environment Facility (GEF) are policies that require gender action plans in funded projects.\nGlobally, governments are increasingly adopting gender-responsive agricultural and energy policies. However, due to limited funding, data gaps, and cultural barriers, implementation challenges remain.\nChallenges and Future Directions\nWomen’s participation in sustainable agriculture and energy faces persistent constraints such as:\n* Unequal access to land, finance, and education\n* Time poverty due to unpaid domestic work\n* Limited representation in policy and technology innovation\n* Exposure to climate shocks and resource scarcity\nFuture strategies emphasize:\n* Integrating gender perspectives in climate-smart agriculture and energy policies\n* Increasing women’s leadership in research, cooperatives, and governance\n* Expanding financing and entrepreneurship programs tailored to women\n* Enhancing education and digital literacy for participation in green technologies\nReferences"
