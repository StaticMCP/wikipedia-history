Therefore, in the years following end of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748, Maria Theresa and Joseph II enacted several administrative reforms with Prussia as a model, and the old territorial divisions were converted into new . These reforms were carried out by Maria Theresa's advisor Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz and continued under chancellor Prince Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz-Rietberg from 1760. The bureaucratisation in the form of  ('circle offices',  ) lessened the influence of the estates by essentially separating them from the administration of the realms.\nThe origin of the  as a unit of administration lay in Bohemia, where   ( in German) had existed as territorial units since the 14th century (see Bohemia § Historical administrative divisions). Through the reform the system was further developed and applied to the Habsburgs' other realms (other than Hungary). In the Archduchy of Austria and Duchy of Styria the old quarters () served as a basis for the new  (Waldviertel, Mostviertel, Industrieviertel and Weinviertel in Lower Austria; Innviertel, Hausruckviertel, Mühlviertel, and Traunviertel in Upper Austria; ).\nThe Hungarian counterparts were the  ( or , formerly spelled ; ), which had existed for much longer and were dominated by the nobility.\nIn Lombardy&ndash;Venetia (1815&ndash;1859/66) there were \"delegations\", which gave rise to the later Provinces.\nAfter 1848\nThe }} ('office districts'), or more precisely the  ('district offices'), created in the reforms which followed the Revolutions of 1848 (specifically those of 1849 and 1853), largely took over the responsibilities of the . These were proposed as early as 1849 by Interior Minister Alexander von Bach as part of a necessary reform to the administrative apparatus to deal with the increase in the number citizens interacting with the offices following the final abolition of serfdom in 1848. The  administrations were thereby subdivided into subordinate . Some smaller  were abolished or merged. The  system was also expanded to the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar (formerly part of southern Hungary) and the Grand Principality of Transylvania in the course of these reforms.\nThe statutory cities were also excluded from  administration, much like they are excluded from the modern districts ().\nAbolition\nWith the creation of the political districts () in 1868, which go back to the December Constitution of 1867, the  divisions were abolished and replaced with much more finely divided  divisions; however, the newly created district commissions () were strongly influenced by the former  administrations.\nOrganisation\nWith the  there was for the first time a level of administration between the manors and free cities and the  (in the crown lands the gubernatorial administration). At the head of every  was a }} (roughly 'circle/district captain/head'; see ), whose officials were entrusted with clearly defined tasks, which significantly disempowered the estates in financial matters. The  were the lowest level of political administration. This brought together direct oversight of taxation, as well as the conscription and recruitment system, the supervision of schools and poorhouses, the supervision of the individual municipalities and the protection of the peasants before the manor lords. The captains were obliged to travel to the  at least once per year or allow the inspectors to visit. For this the captains received a state salary, but were not allowed to hold any other lordly or stately offices and were bound to their instructions.\nThe  were subordinate to the }} (the administrative bodies of the crown lands, roughly governorates).\nLegacy\nDespite numerous reforms, the borders of the  are still roughly visible in the 39 Austrian electoral districts. Also the divisions () of the district courts (; now regional courts – ) are essentially equivalent to those of the former . The 35 NUTS 3 regions are loosely aligned with the former  divisions.\nList of\nThe following is a list of the  and statutory cities in the non-Hungarian lands of the Austrian Empire (Cisleithania in later terminology) ; pre-1848  are also listed where applicable.\nLands of the Bohemian Crown\nKingdom of Bohemia\n) showing the\n|image2 = Mapa království českého 1847.jpg\n|caption2 =  of Bohemia\n|image3 = Karte des Königreiches Böhmen nach der Eintheilung vom Jahre 1854 01.jpg\n|caption3 =  of Bohemia from 1854\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| Name !!rowspan=\"2\"| Seat/administrative centre !!rowspan=\"2\"| Notes\n|-\n!

Triest was also known as Lower Illyria () or as the Littoral (), a name also used for the post-1849 crown land.}} It was disbanded in 1849 and replaced with the separate Duchy of Carinthia, Duchy of Carniola and Austrian Littoral crown lands. The  listed below are grouped by these post-1849 crown lands; internally within the Kingdom they were grouped as such, and the duchies and subdivisions of the Littoral correspond with Habsburg states which existed before the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn by which they were annexed by Napoleon.\n() showing the .]]\nUntil 1809 the area (excluding those parts of Croatia and the Military Frontier which were Illyrian until the 1820s) was organised as part of Inner Austria, an informal region which comprised the Duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, the County of Gorizia and Gradisca, the March/Margraviate of Istria and the Free City of Trieste. During this period the Habsburg March of Istria only included a small interior  part of the peninsula centred on Mitterburg (Pazin, Pisino) and was administered from Carniola; the north-eastern mostly inland part of the later Istrian , as well as part of the eastern coast of the peninsula and a northern coastal exclave around Duino-Aurisina were part of the Carniolan . The Republic of Venice held most of the peninsula itself, including all of the western coast and around half of the eastern coast, as well as the islands in the Kvarner Gulf including Krk and Cres; the Venetian territories were annexed by Austria (as the Venetian Province) in the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio, but lost again to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in the 1805 Peace of Pressburg. The mercury-mining area around Idrija had a special status apart from the Carniolan . The Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca included several exclaves in Venetian territory and within the Carniolan ; by the 1805 Peace of Pressburg and 1807 Treaty of Fontainebleau, the parts of the county west of the Soča/Isonzo were ceded to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.\nDuchy of Carinthia\nThe Duchy of Carinthia () was 1815–49 part of  Laibach of the Kingdom of Illyria; separate crown land thereafter.
