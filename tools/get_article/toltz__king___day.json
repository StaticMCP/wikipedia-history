Hill, and Wesley E. King (1879–1959), a civil and structural engineer. Toltz Engineering Company participated in the design of the Como Park Conservatory in 1915.  A staff architect, Roy Childs Jones, completed the Hamm Building in 1920.\nIn 1919, Beaver Wade Day (1884–1931) joined the firm, and it was renamed to Toltz, King and Day.  The firm designed the Stearns County Courthouse in St. Cloud, Minnesota in 1920 and provided structural engineering services for the Saint Paul Union Depot in 1923.  In 1926, they completed the design of the Robert Street Bridge spanning the Mississippi River in St. Paul.  The bridge, a rainbow arch design, had several challenges that resulted in its unusual form.  The bridge had to reach Kellogg Boulevard at street level at the top of the bluff, while providing enough clearance underneath for the raised platform at the Saint Paul Union Depot, the Chicago Great Western lift bridge, and the passage of riverboats on the river.  The bridge was rebuilt in 1989 by the same firm, now known as TKDA.\nIn 1956, the firm changed its name to Toltz, King, Duvall, Anderson, and Associates, to acknowledge civil engineer Arndt Duvall, architect Gerald Anderson, and other architects and engineers.  Arndt Duvall became president of the firm in 1959, after King's death.\nList of projects and designs\nA number of its works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\nProjects designed by Toltz, King & Day, or its successor TKDA, include:\n*Aitkin County Courthouse and Jail, Beaux-Arts, 209 and 217 2nd St., NW Aitkin, MN, 1929; NRHP-listed\n*Barnes County Courthouse, 491 Second Ave. NW Valley City, ND, 1925; NRHP-listed\n*Burke County Courthouse, Main St. Bowbells, ND, 1928; NRHP-listed\n*Hamm Building, 408 St. Peter Street, St. Paul MN, 1920; NRHP-listed\n*Design of 15 stations on the Blue Line light rail project, 2004\n*I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge approach roadways, signage, lighting, and other support services, 2008\n*Krank Manufacturing Company building, 1855 W.
