He also worked books of religious and moral themes and his Religious Emblems and Allegories was published in 1848.\nLife\nBarber was born in East Windsor, Connecticut, and  learned his craft from the East Windsor printmaker Abner Reed. He was the second of six children of Elijah Barber, a poor farmer, and Mary Barber. Elijah died during the summer of 1812, which forced the fourteen-year-old John to become responsible for supporting the family. In 1823 he opened a business in New Haven, where he produced religious and historical books, illustrated with his own wood and steel engravings.\nAn 1835 engraving by Barber showing the North Haven, Connecticut Green\nHe traveled around Connecticut, creating ink sketches of town greens, hotels, schools, churches, and harbors and collected local history as he went. He also delved into the works of historians. From all this he produced the book now commonly called Connecticut Historical Collections. The full title is Connecticut Historical Collections, Containing a General Collection of Interesting Facts, Traditions, Biographical Sketches, Anecdotes, Etc., Relating to the History and Antiquities of Every Town in Connecticut with Geographical Descriptions.\nThe book has been called \"the first popular local history published in the U.S.\" The book sold well—7,000 copies in its first year even though it cost three dollars, then an average week's pay. Twelve years later it was reissued and again sold well.\nBarber started with rough pencil sketches and developed them into more detailed wash drawings. He then transferred the drawings directly to small blocks of boxwood on which he engraved the designs.\n\"He talked with townspeople, gathered local documents and made quick sketches everywhere he went,\" according to a New York Times article from December 10, 1989, quoted on a print-selling Web site. \"The illustrations depict each town center, with its homes and churches, academies and courthouses sailboats plying a river or harbor, an occasional factory belching puffs of smoke and always a tiny figure or two, often the artist  in his top hat, sketching the scene or pointing to the view.\"\nHe died in New Haven, Connecticut in June 1885.\nGallery\nImage:BarberJohnWarnerClevelandOhio.jpg|Barber's View in Main St., Cleveland, Ohio, circa 1856-1860\nImage:BarberJohnWarnerPotsdam.jpg|Barber's Western View of Potsdam, New York (circa 1856-1860)\nImage:BarberJohnWarnerBethlehemCT.jpg|Barber's View of the center of Bethlehem (published 1836), said to be the earliest depiction of the Connecticut town.\nImage:BarberJohnWarnerPennYan.jpg|Barber's N.E.View of PENN YAN, Yates Co., N.Y.
