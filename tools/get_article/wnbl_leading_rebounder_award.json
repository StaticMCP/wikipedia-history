To be eligible, players must have played in at least 50% of games played in the season. Prior to 2020, there was no award for leading the league in rebounds, only the statistical accolade.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"|\n|Denotes player whose team won championship that year\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"|\n|Denotes player inducted into the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#CFECEC; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:6em\"|\n|Denotes player who is still active\n|-\n|Player (X)\n|Denotes the number of times the player had won at that time\n|-\n|Team (X)\n|Denotes the number of times a player from this team had won at that time\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" summary=\"Season (sortable), Player (sortable), Position (sortable), Nationality (sortable) and Team (sortable)\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Season\n!scope=\"col\"| Player\n!scope=\"col\"| Rebounds\n!scope=\"col\"| RPG\n!scope=\"col\"| Nationality\n!scope=\"col\"| Team\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 2020\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Anneli Maley\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 157\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 12.1\n|\n| Sydney Uni Flames\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 2021–22\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Anneli Maley (2)\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 251\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 15.7\n|\n| Bendigo Spirit\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 2022–23\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Cayla George\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 238\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 11.3\n|\n| Melbourne Boomers\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 2023–24\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Brianna Turner\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 290\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 13.8\n|\n| Adelaide Lightning\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 2024–25\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background-color:#CFECEC\"| Brianna Turner (2)\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 266\n| style=\"text-align: center\"| 12.7\n|\n| Adelaide Lightning (2)\n|}\nSee also\n* WNBL Leading Scorer Award\n* WNBL Golden Hands Award\n* WNBA Peak Performers\n* WNBL Defensive Player of the Year Award\n* All-WNBL Team\nReferences"
