It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General Leslie Groves of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District; \"Manhattan\" gradually became the codename for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys.  The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2&nbsp;billion (about  $++++++}} in  dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and producing the fissionable materials, with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.\nTwo types of atomic bombs were developed during the war. A relatively simple gun-type fission weapon was made using uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Since it is chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and has almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate. Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Most of this work was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  In parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce plutonium. Reactors were constructed at Oak Ridge and Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon was developed in a concerted design and construction effort at the project's principal research and design laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.\nThe following is a timeline of the Manhattan Project. It includes a number of events prior to the official formation of the Manhattan Project, and a number of events after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, until the Manhattan Project was formally replaced by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947.\ndirector Robert Oppenheimer (left), Manhattan Project director Major General Leslie Groves (center) and University of California president Robert Gordon Sproul (right) at the ceremony to present the laboratory with the Army-Navy \"E\" Award in October 1945|alt=A large house with a stone chimney, decorated with bunting.

Purnell is created to oversee the project.\n* September - Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols meets Edgar Sengier in the New York offices of Union Minière. Nichols has been ordered by General Groves to find uranium. Sengier's answer has become history: \"You can have the ore now. It is in New York, a thousand tons of it. I was waiting for your visit.\" Nichols reaches an agreement with Sengier that an average of 400 tons of uranium oxide will begin shipping to the US from Shinkolobwe each month.\n* September 26: The Manhattan Project is given permission to use the highest wartime priority rating by the War Production Board.\n* September 29: Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson authorizes the Corps of Engineers to acquire  in Tennessee for Site X, which will become the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, laboratory and production site.\n* October - 100&nbsp;tons of Sengier's uranium ore is sent to Canada for refining by Eldorado Mining and Refining in Port Hope, Ontario.\n*  October - A special detachment from United States Army Corps of Engineers arrives in the Belgian Congo to reopen the Shinkolobwe mine in the Belgian Congo. Work involves draining water from flooded workings, upgrading the plant machinery and constructing transportation facilities.\n* October 15: after a meeting in Chicago on the Manhattan Project General Leslie Groves invited J. Robert Oppenheimer to join himself, James C. Marshall and Kenneth Nichols on their return trip to New York on the 20th Century Limited. After dinner on the train they discussed the project while squeezed into Nichol's one-person roomette (of about 40\" by 80\" or 1m by 2m). Shortly afterwards Oppenheimer was appointed to head the Los Alamos Laboratory (Site Y).\n* October 19: Groves appoints Oppenheimer to coordinate the scientific research of the project at the Site Y laboratory.\n* November - The first uranium oxide shipment leaves the Congolese port of Lobito (it will later change to Matadi because of better security). Only two shipments will ever be lost at sea. Aerodromes at Elizabethville and Leopoldville are expanded with US assistance.

A Fat Man bomb as enough U-235 for a second Little Boy bomb would not be available until December.\n* August 14: Surrender of Japan to the Allied powers.\n* August 21: Harry Daghlian, a physicist, receives a fatal dose (510 rems) of radiation from a criticality accident when he accidentally dropped a tungsten carbide brick onto a plutonium bomb core.
