It was released on March 21, 2006. It was the band's first release on RCA Records, which caused the band to receive criticism from many due to their initially anti-corporate message.\nBackground\nThe booklet which comes with the CD contains a short essay for all but two songs (\"State Funeral\" and \"Cities Burn\") which gives more in-depth perspective on the inspirations for the song subjects such as the Downing Street Memo and Monsanto Company Corporation, as well as information on one of Anti-Flag's side projects, Military Free Zone. The CD also comes with two stencils, of the \"Gunstar\", a star formed with broken M-16s as seen on the cover of Mobilize, and the phrase \"What are we going to do about the U.S.A.?\".\nMike Ski of The A.K.A.s did the art direction, design and layout design for the album art.\nThe song \"Emigre\" (which on the promotional version was originally called \"Exodus\") includes an adaptation of Martin Niemöller's poem \"First they came\".\nSongs from the album were used by several video games. \"This is the End (For You My Friend)\" is used in two EA Sports video games, Madden NFL 07 and NHL 07.- \"The Press Corpse\" is used in the video games ''Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam and Shaun White Snowboarding''.-\nBy April 3, 2008, the album had sold 97,000 copies.\nTrack listing\n| total_length = 38:56\n| title1       = I'd Tell You But…\n| length1      = 2:10\n| title2       = The Press Corpse\n| length2      = 3:21\n| title3       = Emigre\n| note3        = Originally called \"Exodus\" on the promo version of the album\n| length3      = 3:00\n| title4       = The Project for a New American Century\n| length4      = 3:17\n| title5       = Hymn for the Dead\n| length5      = 3:39\n| title6       = This Is the End (For You My Friend)\n| length6      = 3:11\n| title7       = 1 Trillion Dollar$\n| note7        = Originally called \"One Trillion Dollars\" on the promo version\n| length7      = 2:30\n| title8       = State Funeral\n| length8      = 2:00\n| title9       = Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\n| length9      = 2:43\n| title10      = War Sucks, Let's Party!\n| length10     = 2:18\n| title11      = The W.T.O.
