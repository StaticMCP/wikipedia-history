The award was given to a book written in English by a citizen or permanent resident of Canada and published in Canada during the preceding year.\nThe award was administered and presented by the Canadian Library Association (CLA) until the organization disbanded in 2016. It was inaugurated in 1947 by an award to Roderick Haig-Brown for Starbuck Valley Winter and it was presented to one book every year without exception from 1963 to 2016. As of 2016, two Book of the Year for Children criteria were \"appeal to children up to and including age 12\" and \"creative (i.e., original) writing (i.e., fiction, poetry, narrative, non-fiction, retelling of traditional literature)\".\nThe companion CLA Young Adult Book Award was presented annually from 1981. Corresponding criteria for the YA Book Award are \"[appeal] to young adults between the ages of 13 and 18\" and \"fiction (novel, collection of short stories, or graphic novel)\". Two books have won both the children's and young-adult awards (below).\nWinners\nThere were two awards in 1966 and no award six times from 1948 to 1962.
