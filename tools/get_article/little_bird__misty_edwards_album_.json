Kevin Davis, indicating in a four and a half star review at New Release Tuesday, realizes, \"the stirring vocals, prayerful lyrics and musical arrangements are breath-taking\" Signaling in a three and a half star review from Jesus Freak Hideout, Jen Rose Yokel responds, \"For the most part, Little Bird closes out the year on an elegant and quietly powerful note.\" Writing in an eight out of ten review, Stephen Curry at Cross Rhythms describes, \"This album can be described as eclectic, introspective and experimental and although it does lack an element of cohesion, it makes up for it with beautiful melodies, thought provoking lyrics and one of Christendom's most recognisable voices.\" Ian Zandi, writes a three star review for Indie Vision Music, reports, \"This is a solid album from Misty Edwards.\" Cal Moore, writes a two star review at The Christian Manifesto, responds, \"its just a terrible release.\" Awarding the album three and a half stars, Andrew Funderburk says, \"Little Bird remains rhythmically consistent from beginning to end\". Christian St. John, rating the album four stars from Christian Review Magazine, writes, \"Little Bird is a very different album that reveals a more creative, arty side to Misty Edwards with becoming self indulgent.\"\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (2015)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* Misty Edwards discography\nReferences"
