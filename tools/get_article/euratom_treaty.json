It was signed on 25 March 1957 at the same time as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC Treaty).\nThe Euratom Treaty is less well known because of the lower profile of the organisation that it founded. The EEC has evolved into what is now the European Union, but Euratom has remained much the same as it was in 1957 although it is governed by the institutions of the European Union. It was established with its own Commission and Council, but the 1967 Merger Treaty merged these institutions of Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community with those of the EEC.\nThe Euratom treaty has seen very little amendment because of later sensitivity surrounding nuclear power in European public opinion. That has caused some to argue that it has become too outdated, particularly in the areas of democratic oversight. It was not included as part of the (unratified) Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which sought to combine all previous treaties, over fears that including nuclear power in the treaty would turn more people against it. Nevertheless, it is one of the active treaties of the European Union.\nBackground and timeline\nSee also\n* Euratom\n* History of the European Coal and Steel Community (1945–1957)\n* European Economic Community\n* Treaty establishing the European Economic Community\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:11957A/TXT Documents of the treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community] on Eur-Lex\n* [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/collection/eu-law/treaties/treaties-overview.html Treaties overview on EUR-Lex]\n* [http://archives.eui.eu/en/fonds/94854?item=CM3/NEGO Documents] of Treaty of Rome's negotiations are at the [http://www.eui.eu/Research/HistoricalArchivesOfEU/AbouttheHistoricalArchives/Index.aspx Historical Archives of the EU] in Florence"
