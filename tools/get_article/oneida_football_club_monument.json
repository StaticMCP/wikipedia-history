The game played by the club, known as the \"Boston game\", was an informal local variant that predated the codification of rules for association football, rugby football, or American football. The team, made up of students of Boston's elite preparatory schools, played on Boston Common from 1862 to 1865, during which time they reportedly never lost a game or even gave up a single point.\nDescription and history\nThe marble tablet was donated by seven members of the Oneida Football Club and installed in 1925. It measures approximately 6.5&nbsp;ft. × 2.5&nbsp;ft. × 7 in.\nAn inscription on the front reads:\nON THIS FIELD THE ONEIDA\nFOOTBALL CLUB OF BOSTON\nTHE FIRST ORGANIZED FOOTBALL\nCLUB IN THE UNITED STATES\nPLAYED AGAINST ALL COMERS\nfrom 1862 to 1865. THE ONEIDA\nGOAL WAS NEVER CROSSED\nThis monument is placed on Boston Common\nNovember 1925 by the seven surviving members of the Team\"\nAn inscription on the back can also be found which reads, \"MEMBERS OF THE ONEIDA TEAM\", under this was the list of the 16 members of the original team.\nThe monument was unveiled on Saturday November 21, 1925, and was attended by the six surviving members of the team including its founder and captain Gerritt Smith Miller. It was designed by architects Robert Day Andrews and Howland Jones of the Boston architecture firm Andrews, Jones, Biscoe & Whitmore and executed by sculptor Joseph Coletti.\nIt was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\" program in 1997.\nSee also\n* 1925 in art\n* History of soccer in the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
