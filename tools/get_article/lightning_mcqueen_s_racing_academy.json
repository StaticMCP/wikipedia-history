The show took place after the events of Cars 3.\nThe show was housed in Sunset Showcase Theater near Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith. On September 3, 2024, it was announced that the show would close on October 7, 2024, to make way for an all-new Disney Villains-themed stage show, Disney Villains: Unfairly Ever After, which opened on May 27, 2025.\nVoice cast\n* Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen\n* Larry the Cable Guy as Tow Mater\n* Bonnie Hunt as Sally Carrera\n* Cristela Alonzo as Cruz Ramirez\n* Bob Peterson as Chick Hicks\n* John Ratzenberger as Mack\n* Tony Shalhoub as Luigi\n* Lloyd Sherr as Fillmore\n* Jenifer Lewis as Flo\n* Lea DeLaria as Miss Fritter\nShow summary\nDuring the 10-minute show, guests took on the role of \"rookie racer\" as they entered the theater and watched a Lightning McQueen animatronic on stage. The audience was enveloped by a giant, wrap-around screen that was nearly two stories tall and stretched more than 200 feet from end to end.\nLightning was anxious to show what he's learned over the years, but his main rival Chick Hicks hacked into the simulator system to humiliate him. Mater, Cruz Ramirez and Lightning's friends from Radiator Springs chimed in with their support, as Lightning geared up for a challenge to settle the score with Chick Hicks in a virtual simulator race.\nIn the courtyard outside the attraction, guests could meet Cruz Ramirez and joined DJ's Dance Party, relocated from Cars Land at Disney California Adventure.\nReferences"
