The creek in turn was named after the hundreds of scrub turkeys (called \"pheasants\" by the local people) that inhabited the creek banks. Early settlers ate the birds.\nPheasant Creek has the following mountains:\n* Mount Wheal (), rising to  above sea level\n* Mount Spencer (),\nThe land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation with a small amount of crop growing.\nHistory\nPheasant Creek Provisional School opened circa 1919, but closed circa 1921. It was a tent school, which was relocated to Benarabin. After much local lobbying, in 1925, a new school building was erected and opened as Pheasant Creek State School, but it had closed by 1928 with the building proposed to be relocated to Biloela. Lobbying for a school resumed in 1936. In April 1940, tenders were called for a new school building (possibly funded by the local community), which opened on 29 October 1940. It closed permanently in 1967. It was on the western side of Grantleigh Pheasant Creek Road ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Pheasant Creek had a population of 48 people.\nIn the , Pheasant Creek had a population of 48 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schols in Pheasant Creek.
