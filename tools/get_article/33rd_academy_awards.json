This was the first ceremony to be aired on ABC television, which has aired the Academy Awards ever since (except between 1971 and 1975, when they were aired on NBC for the first time since the previous year).\nBilly Wilder's The Apartment won Best Picture, the last black-and-white film to do so until ''Schindler's List and The Artist at the 66th and 84th Academy Awards, respectively.\nElizabeth Taylor, who had a near-fatal bout with pneumonia a short time before the ceremony, was viewed as having received her Oscar out of sympathy rather than for her performance in Butterfield 8''.\nGary Cooper was selected by the Academy Board of Governors to receive an Academy Honorary Award \"for his many memorable screen performances and the international recognition he, as an individual, has gained for the motion picture industry\". Cooper was too ill to attend the ceremony, though his condition was not publicly disclosed; James Stewart, a close friend of Cooper, accepted the Oscar on his behalf. Stewart's emotional speech hinted that something was seriously wrong, and the following day newspapers ran the headline, \"Gary Cooper has cancer\". Cooper died less than four weeks later.\nRising star Hayley Mills was selected by the Academy Board of Governors as the year's recipient of the Academy Juvenile Award for her breakthrough and acclaimed performance in Walt Disney's Pollyanna. She was the last recipient of the award; going forward, juvenile actors could officially compete in competitive categories. This was the first year a red carpet lined the walk into the theater.\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were announced on February 27, 1961. Winners are listed first and highlighted with boldface.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Motion Picture\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA; width:50%\" | Best Directing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*' The Apartment – Billy Wilder, producer'\n**The Alamo – John Wayne, producer\n**Elmer Gantry – Bernard Smith, producer\n**Sons and Lovers – Jerry Wald, producer\n**The Sundowners – Fred Zinnemann, producer\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*' Billy Wilder&nbsp;– The Apartment'\n**Jules Dassin&nbsp;– Never on Sunday\n**Alfred Hitchcock&nbsp;– Psycho\n**Jack Cardiff&nbsp;– Sons and Lovers\n**Fred Zinnemann&nbsp;– The Sundowners\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actor\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*' Burt Lancaster&nbsp;– Elmer Gantry as Elmer Gantry'\n**Trevor Howard&nbsp;– Sons and Lovers as Walter Morel\n**Jack Lemmon&nbsp;– The Apartment as Calvin Clifford \"Bud\" Baxter\n**Laurence Olivier&nbsp;– The Entertainer as Archie Rice\n**Spencer Tracy&nbsp;– Inherit the Wind as Henry Drummond\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*' Elizabeth Taylor&nbsp;– BUtterfield 8 as Gloria Wandrous'\n**Greer Garson&nbsp;– Sunrise at Campobello as Eleanor Roosevelt\n**Deborah Kerr&nbsp;– The Sundowners as Ida Carmody\n**Shirley MacLaine&nbsp;– The Apartment as Fran Kubelik\n**Melina Mercouri&nbsp;– Never on Sunday as Ilya\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actor in a Supporting Role\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Actress in a Supporting Role\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*' Peter Ustinov&nbsp;– Spartacus as Batiatus'\n**Peter Falk&nbsp;– Murder, Inc. as Abe \"Kid Twist\" Reles\n**Jack Kruschen&nbsp;– The Apartment as Dr. Dreyfuss\n**Sal Mineo&nbsp;– Exodus as Dov Landau\n**Chill Wills&nbsp;– The Alamo as Beekeeper\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*' Shirley Jones&nbsp;– Elmer Gantry as Lulu Bains'\n**Glynis Johns&nbsp;– The Sundowners as Mrs. Firth\n**Shirley Knight&nbsp;– The Dark at the Top of the Stairs as Reenie Flood\n**Janet Leigh&nbsp;– Psycho as Marion Crane\n**Mary Ure&nbsp;– Sons and Lovers as Clara Dawes\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Writing (Story and Screenplay -- Written Directly for the Screen)\n! style=\"background:#F9EFAA\" | Best Writing (Screenplay -- Based on Material from Another Medium)\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*' The Apartment&nbsp;– Billy Wilder and I.
