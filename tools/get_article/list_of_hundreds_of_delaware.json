They were once used as a basis for representation in the Delaware General Assembly.\nWhile their names still appear on all real estate transactions, they currently have no use except for non-renewable rental agreements for 120 days or less for dwellings located in Broadkill Hundred, Lewes-Rehoboth Hundred, Indian River Hundred and Baltimore Hundred, which are not subject to the Delaware Landlord-Tenant Code. The divisions come from the times when Delaware and Maryland were colonial holdings of England. While Delaware retains the use of \"hundreds,\" the origin of most place names in both states trace back to the times of British rule.\nNew Castle County\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n| Hundred Name || Created || Parent Hundred  || Primary Town || Origin of Name\n|-\n| Appoquinimink Hundred  || 1682 || original || Townsend  || Appoquinimink Creek\n|-\n| Blackbird Hundred  || 1875 || Appoquinimink Hundred ||   || Blackbird Creek\n|-\n| Brandywine Hundred  || 1682 || original || Bellefonte  || Brandywine Creek\n|-\n| Christiana Hundred  || 1682 || original || Elsmere  || Christiana River\n|-\n| Mill Creek Hundred  || 1710 || Christiana Hundred ||   || Mill Creek\n|-\n| New Castle Hundred  || 1682 || original ||New Castle  || Town of New Castle\n|-\n| Pencader Hundred  || 1710 || New Castle Hundred ||   || Pencader (Welsh Tract) Church\n|-\n| Red Lion Hundred  || 1710 || New Castle Hundred || Delaware City  || Red Lion Creek\n|-\n| St. George's Hundred  || 1682 || original || Middletown  || St. George's Creek\n|-\n| White Clay Hundred  || 1710 || Christiana Hundred || Newark  ||   White Clay Creek\n|-\n| Wilmington Hundred  || 1833 || Christiana Hundred ||Wilmington  || City of Wilmington\n|-\n|}\nKent County\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n| Hundred Name || Created ||  Parent Hundred  || Primary Town || Origin of Name\n|-\n| Duck Creek Hundred  || 1682 || original || Smyrna  || Duck Creek\n|-\n| East Dover Hundred  || 1859 || Dover Hundred ||Dover   || City of Dover\n|-\n| Kenton Hundred  || 1869 || Duck Creek Hundred ||Kenton   ||  Town of Kenton\n|-\n| Little Creek Hundred  || 1682 || original ||Leipsic   || Little Creek\n|-\n| Milford Hundred  || 1830 || Mispillion Hundred ||Milford   ||   City of Milford\n|-\n| Mispillion Hundred  || 1682 || original ||Harrington   || Mispillion River\n|-\n| North Murderkill Hundred  || 1855 || Murderkill Hundred ||Camden   ||  Murderkill River\n|-\n| South Murderkill Hundred  || 1855 || Murderkill Hundred ||Felton   ||  Murderkill River\n|-\n| West Dover Hundred  || 1859 || Dover Hundred ||Hartly   || City of Dover\n|-\n|}\n*St. Jones Hundred was created in 1682, and was renamed Dover Hundred in 1823; Dover Hundred was subsequently divided into East Dover Hundred and West Dover Hundred in 1859.\n*Murderkill Hundred was created in 1682 and was divided into North Murderkill Hundred and South Murderkill Hundred in 1855.\nSussex County\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n| Hundred Name || Created ||  Parent Hundred  || Primary Town || Origin of Name\n|-\n| Baltimore Hundred  || 1775|| Worcester County, Maryland || Millville   || Part of never-erected Maryland county\n|-\n| Broad Creek Hundred  || 1775|| Somerset County, Maryland || Bethel  || Broad Creek\n|-\n| Broadkill Hundred  || 1696 || original || Milton  || Broadkill River\n|-\n| Cedar Creek Hundred  || 1702 || Broadkill Hundred || Milford  || Cedar Creek\n|-\n| Dagsboro Hundred  || 1773 || Worcester County, Maryland ||Millsboro    || Dagsboro\n|-\n| Georgetown Hundred  || 1863 || Broadkill Hundred ||Georgetown   || Georgetown\n|-\n| Gumboro Hundred  || 1873 || Dagsboro Hundred ||   || Gumboro\n|-\n| Indian River Hundred  || 1706|| Lewes & Rehoboth Hundred ||    || Indian River (inlet and bay)\n|-\n| Lewes & Rehoboth Hundred  || 1692 || original ||Lewes   ||   Lewes (Whorekill) and the Rehoboth Bay\n|-\n| Little Creek Hundred  || 1774|| Somerset County, Maryland || Laurel   || Little Creek\n|-\n| Nanticoke Hundred  || 1775|| Somerset County, Maryland||  ||   Nanticoke River\n|-\n| Northwest Fork Hundred  || 1775|| Dorchester County, Maryland || Bridgeville  || Northwest Fork, Nanticoke River\n|-\n| Seaford Hundred  || 1869 || Northwest Fork Hundred || Seaford  || Seaford\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*List of counties in Delaware\nReferences\nSources\n*The University of Delaware Library (2001).
