The agreement ensures the continued flow of goods between the three countries, preserving economic stability and minimizing trade disruptions post-Brexit.\nBackground\nPrior to Brexit, trade relations among the UK, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein were governed by a network of agreements between the European Union (EU) and Switzerland, which were also extended to Liechtenstein due to its participation in the Swiss customs territory and the European Economic Area (EEA). These included the 1972 Free Trade Agreement for industrial products and the 1999 Agricultural Agreement, both of which ceased to apply to the UK after its departure from the EU.\nTo avoid disruption, the UK and Switzerland signed a bilateral continuity trade agreement in February 2019, which entered into force on 1 January 2021. To extend these arrangements to Liechtenstein, an additional agreement was concluded, creating the Switzerland–Liechtenstein–United Kingdom Trade Agreement.\nSee also\n* Switzerland–United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement\n* Liechtenstein–United Kingdom relations\n* Switzerland–United Kingdom relations\n* Free trade agreements of the United Kingdom\nReferences"
