It was a variety of Dyirbalic, and appears to be composed of three distinct dialects: Wargamaygan spoken around the lower reaches of the Herbert River; Biyay spoken at the mouth of the Herbert, in the area of Halifax and Bemerside; and Hinchinbrook Biyay, spoken around the coastal area south of Cardwell and offshore on Hinchinbrook Island.\nWords in the Warrgamay language include:\n* knarbo (tame dog)\n* gerolo (wild dog)\n* baby (father)\n* kora/yong/yonga (mother)\n* mecolo (white man)\nCountry\nThe Warrgamay were the Indigenous people of Halifax Bay, and held in Norman Tindale's calculations, approximately  of tribal domains. An early resident, James Cassady, specified that they had  of shoreline, extending into the hinterland approximately .\nTheir northern neighbours were the Girramay, while to their south lay the Wulgurukaba.\nSocial organisation\nThe Warrgamay  were divided into several groups or clans:\n* Ikelbara\n* Doolebara\n* Mungulbara\n* Mandambara\n* Karabara\n* Bungabara\n* Yoembara\nThe intermarriage of groups has been classified as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Male !! Female !! Male Children !! Female Children\n|-\n| Korkoro || Wongarugun || Watero || Woterungan\n|-\n| Wongo || Korkorungan || Korkeen || Korkeelingan\n|-\n| Korkeen || Woterungan || Wongo || Wongerungan\n|-\n| Wotero || Korkeelingan || Korkoro || Korkorungan\n|}\nCustoms\nCircumcision as an initiatory rite was unknown among the Warrgamay. They did practise tooth avulsion, ritual scarification and piercing of the septum to wear nose bones. Polygamy was common, and widows were married to their deceased husband's brother.\nHistory of contact\nThe area of Halifax Bay first began to be settled by white colonialists in 1865, in the then Colony of Queensland. At that time the numbers of Warrgamay were estimated to amount to roughly 500 people. Within 15 years, they had declined by 300, a mere 40 of the surviving 200 being men. The difference was due to their being relentlessly hunted and gunned down by mounted native troopers under white supervision, together with settlers, both of whom \"shot as many of the males of the tribe as possible\".}}\nAlternative names\nAlternative names and spellings included, according to Tindale:\n* Waragamai\n* Wargamay\n* Wargamaygan\n* Bungabara\n* Ikelbara\n* Herbert River tribe\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
