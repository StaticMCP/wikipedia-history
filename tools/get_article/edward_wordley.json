He made his debut in a 5–0 win against Preston North End in February 1947 and went on to play four more times during the 1946–47 season as Stoke narrowly missed out on the First Division title. However Wordley failed to make an impression on manager Bob McGrory and made just five more league appearances in the next three seasons. Following his release in 1950 he joined Bury but failed to break in to the side and decided to pursue a different career.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=5|Stoke City\n|1946–47\n|First Division\n|5||0||0||0||5||0\n|-\n|1947–48\n|First Division\n|3||0||0||0||3||0\n|-\n|1948–49\n|First Division\n|1||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|1949–50\n|First Division\n|1||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!10!!0!!0!!0!!10!!0\n|-\n|Bury\n|1950–51\n|Second Division\n|0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|Macclesfield Town\n|1951–52\n|Cheshire League\n|16||1||1||0||17||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career Total\n!26!!1!!1!!0!!27!!1\n|}\nReferences"
