The category was presented only at the 11th Canadian Screen Awards in 2023; beginning with the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024, it was split into separate awards for Best Lead Performance in a Comedy Film and Best Lead Performance in a Drama Film.\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Actor\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:2%;\"| Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2022  11th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Lamar Johnson\n| Brother\n|\n|-\n| Choi Seung-yoon\n| Riceboy Sleeps\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Monia Chokri\n| Babysitter\n|-\n| Larissa Corriveau\n| That Kind of Summer (Un été comme ça)\n|-\n| Kelly Depeault\n| Noemie Says Yes (Noémie dit oui)\n|-\n| Joseph Engel\n| Falcon Lake\n|-\n| Steve Laplante\n| Viking\n|-\n| Maxime Le Flaguais\n| Rodeo (Rodéo)\n|}\nReferences"
