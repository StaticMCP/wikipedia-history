The category was created after the 2000 controversy of Contact winning Best Musical; the show used pre-recorded music and featured no singing. The category was retired in 2009 allowing the shows that were previously eligible for it to be eligible in Best Play or Best Musical categories, if they met the proper criteria. The shows are also now eligible in other creative categories.\nIn 1999 and 2000 a Special Tony Award for a Live Theatrical Presentation was awarded which may be seen as the precursor of the Best Special Theatrical Event award and is generally included in this award's listing.\nWinners and nominees\n1990s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:11%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:89%;\"| Production\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| 1999\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Fool Moon\n|}\n2000s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:11%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:89%;\"| Production\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| 2000\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Dame Edna: The Royal Tour\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| 2001\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Blast!\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"| 2002\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"\n| Elaine Stritch at Liberty\n|-\n| Bea Arthur on Broadway, Just Between Friends\n|-\n| Barbara Cook in Mostly Sondheim\n|-\n| Sexaholix...
