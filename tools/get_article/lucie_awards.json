The Lucies bring together photographers from all over the world and pay tribute to their colleagues. Every year, the Advisory Board nominates individuals for their contributions to photography across a variety of categories, and once the nominations are tallied, they are pre-announced months before the Lucies.\nIn addition to honoring photographers, the Lucie Awards also showcase the finalists and winners of the International Photography Awards (Lucie Foundation's sister-effort) annual photography competition, presenting over $22,500 in cash prizes and four distinct titles: The International Photographer of the Year (given to a professional), The Discovery of the Year (awarded to a non-professional), The Deeper Perspective Photographer of the Year (awarded to either a professional or non-professional) and the Moving Image Photographer of the Year (awarded to either a professional or non-professional).\nThe Lucie Awards also present statues to photographers in six different categories, entitled the Support Category Awards. Those categories acknowledge those integral to crafting an image. They are Book Publisher of the Year, Print Advertising Campaign of the Year, Fashion Layout of the Year, Picture Editor of the Year, Curator/Exhibition of the Year and Photography Magazine of the Year.\nIn the week leading up to the Lucie Awards, there are exhibitions and artist talks in New York City, including the annual International Photography Awards “Best of Show”, which shows 45 winning images from each calendar year's competition, selected by a different curator each year.\nHistory\nIn its 2003 inaugural year, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and then moved to New York City, where it has been held at the American Airlines Theatre, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall.\nRecipients\n2003\n*Henri Cartier-Bresson – 2003 Lifetime Achievement\n*Robert Evans – 2003 Visionary Award\n*Phil Borges – 2003 Humanitarian Award\n*Ruth Bernhard – 2003 Achievement in Fine Art\n*William Claxton – 2003 Achievement in Music\n*Mary Ellen Mark – 2003 Achievement in Documentary.\n*Steve McCurry – 2003 Achievement in Photojournalism\n*Douglas Kirkland – 2003 Achievement in Entertainment\n*Melvin Sokolsky – 2003 Achievement in Fashion\n*Tim Street-Porter – 2003 Achievement in Architecture\n*Phil Stern – 2003 Achievement in Still for Motion Pictures\n*Annie Leibovitz – 2003 Women in Photography Award (presented by Women in Photography International)\n*Gene Trindl – 2003 Achievement in Portraiture\n*RJ Muna – 2003 Achievement in Advertising\n2004\n*Gordon Parks – 2004 Lifetime Achievement\n*Sebastiao Salgado – 2004 Humanitarian Award\n*Cornell Capa – 2004 Visionary Award\n*Arthur Leipzig – 2004 Achievement in Fine Art\n*James Nachtwey – 2004 Achievement in Photojournalism\n*Sylvia Plachy – 2004 Women in Photography Award (presented by Women In Photography International)\n*Julius Shulman – 2004 Achievement in Architecture\n*Jim Marshall – 2004 Achievement in Music\n*Bruce Davidson – 2004 Achievement in Documentary\n*Bert Stern – 2004 Achievement in Entertainment\n*Lillian Bassman – 2004 Achievement in Fashion\n*Arnold Newman – 2004 Achievement in Portraiture\n*Jay Maisel – 2004 Achievement in Advertising\n*Walter Iooss – 2004 Achievement in Sports\n*Bob Willoughby – 2004 Achievement in Still for Motion Pictures\n2005\n*William Klein – 2005 Lifetime Achievement\n*Harry Benson – 2005 Achievement in Portraiture\n*Larry Clark – 2005 Achievement in Documentary\n*Lucien Clergue – 2005 Achievement in Fine Art\n*Hiro – 2005 Achievement in Advertising\n*Antonín Kratochvíl – 2005 Achievement in Photojournalism\n*Peter Lindbergh – 2005 Achievement in Fashion\n*Ozzie Sweet – 2005 Achievement in Sports\n*Zana Briski – 2005 Humanitarian Award\n2006\n*David Bailey – 2006 Achievement in Fashion\n*Eikoh Hosoe – 2006 Visionary Award\n*Neil Leifer – 2006 Achievement in Sports\n*Roger Mayne – 2006 Achievement in Documentary\n*Duane Michals – 2006 Achievement in Portraiture\n*Sarah Moon – 2006 Achievement in Fine Art\n*Marc Riboud – 2006 Achievement in Photojournalism\n*Willy Ronis – 2006 Lifetime Achievement\n*Albert Watson – 2006 Achievement in Advertising\n2007\n*Elliott Erwitt – 2007 Lifetime Achievement\n*Ralph Gibson – 2007 Achievement in Fine Art\n*Philip Jones Griffiths – 2007 Achievement in Photojournalism\n*Kenro Izu – 2007 Visionary Award\n*Heinz Kluetmeier – 2007 Achievement in Sports\n*Eugene Richards – 2007 Achievement in Documentary\n*Lord Snowdon – 2007 Achievement in Portraiture\n*Deborah Turbeville – 2007 Achievement in Fashion\n*Howard Zieff – 2007 Achievement in Advertising\n*Magnum Photos (established 1957) – 2007 Spotlight Award\n2008\n*Gianni Berengo Gardin – 2008 Lifetime Achievement\n*Richard Misrach – 2008 Achievement in Fine Art\n*Susan Meiselas – 2008 Achievement in Photojournalism\n*Sara Terry and The Aftermath Project – 2008 Humanitarian Award\n*John Iacono – 2008 Achievement in Sports\n*Josef Koudelka – 2008 Achievement in Documentary\n*Herman Leonard – 2008 Achievement in Portraiture\n*Patrick Demarchelier – 2008 Achievement in Fashion\n*Erwin Olaf – 2008 Achievement in Advertising\n*Visa pour l'image (established 1988) – 2008 Spotlight Award\n2009\n*Gilles Peress – 2009 Achievement in Photojournalism\n*Marvin Newman – 2009 Achievement in Sports\n*Ara Guler – 2009 Lifetime Achievement\n*Jean-Paul Goude – 2009 Achievement in Fashion\n*Mark Seliger – 2009 Achievement in Portraiture\n*Reza – 2009 Achievement in Documentary\n*W.
