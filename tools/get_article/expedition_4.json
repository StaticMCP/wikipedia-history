The fourth resident crew launched on 5 December 2001 on board Space Shuttle Endeavour during mission STS-108. They became official station residents at 20:03 UTC on 7 December 2001, and remained on board until June 2002, when they landed on STS-111.\nAn international crew of three were the fourth crew to live aboard the International Space Station. The team was led by Russian Yuri I. Onufrienko and joined by American crewmates Daniel W. Bursch and Carl E. Walz, both flight engineers. As a part of the STS-108 mission, Endeavour delivered the Expedition 4 crew to the station. They returned to Earth 19 June 2002, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour following the STS-111 mission.\nSpacewalks\nThe Expedition Four crew conducted three spacewalks during its stay on board the International Space Station. The crew spent a total of 17 hours and 51 minutes outside the station. These spacewalks brought the total up to 34—nine station-based and 25 shuttle-based—that have been conducted at the station for total of 208 hours and 5 minutes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"10%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Mission\n! width=\"20%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Spacewalkers\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Start (UTC)\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|End (UTC)\n! width=\"12%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Duration\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 4EVA 1\n| Yury Onufrienko  Carl Walz\n| 14 January 2002  20:59\n| 15 January 2002  03:02\n| 6 hours 3 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Onufrienko and Walz relocated the cargo boom for the Russian Strela crane. They moved the boom from Pressurized Mating Adapter 1 to the exterior of the Pirs Docking Compartment. The crew also installed an amateur radio antenna onto the end of the Zvezda Service Module. The space walk was based out of the Pirs Airlock and used Russian Orlan space suits.\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 4EVA 2\n| Onufrienko  Daniel Bursch\n| 25 January 2002  15:19\n| 25 January 2002  21:18\n| 5 hours 59 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|During Expedition Four's second spacewalk, Onufrienko and Bursch installed six deflector shields for the Zvezda Service Module's jet thrusters. Also, they installed an amateur radio antenna, attached four science experiments, and retrieved and replaced a device to measure material from the thrusters. Like the first EVA, this one was based out of Pirs, and the spacewalkers used Orlan suits.\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 4EVA 3\n| Walz  Bursch\n| 20 February 2002  15:19\n| 20 February 2002  17:25\n| 5 hours 49 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|This spacewalk was based out of the Quest Airlock, using U.S. spacesuits. Walz and Bursch tested the airlock and prepared for the four spacewalks that were to be performed during STS-110 in April. The STS-110 crew were to install the S0 Truss onto the station. This spacewalk was the first spacewalk to be based out of Quest without a space shuttle at the station.\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20000303002053/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-4/ndxpage1.html Expedition 4 Photography]"
