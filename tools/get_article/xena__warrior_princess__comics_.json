Topps Comics and Dark Horse Comics created a series of comics tying into the property. In 2007, Dynamite Entertainment acquired the rights to the series.\nPublication history\nTopps Comics published the first Xena series of comics, titled Xena: Warrior Princess. Xena's character was originally introduced in the 1996 Topps Comics series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, issues #3, #4, and #5. These were followed by the Xena: Warrior Princess comics released in a limited series format, with the vast majority being three-issue series, in 1997 and 1998.\nDark Horse acquired the license in 1999.\nDynamite Entertainment began new stories in 2007.\nThere have been a number of crossovers with other properties within the companies, including three mini-series with Army of Darkness: \"Why Not?\", \"What, Again?\", and \"Forever and a Day\".\nAll publishers used cover rations involving photo covers, with stills from the television series, and drawn/inked/colored art covers.\nPublishers\nTopps Comics\nMany of the comics were released with multiple covers: one photo cover and one cover with a comic book artist's rendering.

Comics featuring Xena were also run in Dark Horse Presents Annual 1999, Dark Horse Jr., and 2000, Girls Rule!. The series was incompletely collected into a series of three trade paperbacks.\nDynamite Entertainment\nDynamite started publishing Xena comics in 2006 with a four issue mini-series and an annual titled Xena. It was written by John Layman with art by Fabiano Neves. In May 2007 Dynamite and Layman launched another four issue mini-series subtitled Dark Xena, set some time after Xena, with art by Noah Salonga.\nIn April 2016, a third series of six issues began, written by Catwoman writer Genevieve Valentine, with art by Ariel Mendel. Dynamite started a new monthly Xena: Warrior Princess series in February 2018 which ran for ten issues with writing by Meredith Finch and then Erica Schultz, followed by another six issue series written by Vita Ayala in 2019.\nDynamite also published the two four issue crossovers with Army of Darkness, Why Not?
