It has been in active service as the local division for the provinces of North Kalimantan and East Kalimantan (from 1958-1985 and from 2010 to present).\nBrief history\n, East Kalimantan]]\nThe name \"Mulawarman\" is named after the legendary king Mulavarman of the Kutai Martadipura Kingdom who ruled in the 5th century CE, historically one of the earliest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia, located in current Kutai Kartanegara Regency, East Kalimantan.\nThe 6th MRC, then as the 10th Military Region Command ()  holding the Lambung Mangkurat honorific was activated on 19 July 1958 with the headquarters in Banjarmasin and serving South and Central Kalimantan, while the 9th MRC (), holding the Mulawarman honorific, was based in Samarinda and with East Kalimantan as its AOR. Both formations were raised in response to the threat faced by the Permesta revolt the same year as they split from the then 6th Territorial Army (established 1950 on the basis of the Lambung Mangkurat Infantry Division, formerly the 4th Naval Division of the Indonesian Navy established in 1949). This format lasted until the 1984 reorganization of military regions by the Commander of the National Armed Forces, when the 6th MRC was granted the Tanjungpura honorific when it merged with the 10th and 9th MRCs with a new garrison in Balikpapan. In 2010, the INAF split its military region command for Indonesian parts of Borneo into two, thus the 6th MRC, now with a smaller AOR including North, East and South Kalimantan and with its garrison still in Balikpapan, was granted the Mulawaman honorific title.\nThe 6th MRC serves as the de facto military region for the planned capital city of Nusantara under construction.\nMilitary Territorial units\nThe region is composed of 3 Military Area Commands and 1 Training Regiment.\n1.
