The season was perhaps most memorable for the Warriors drafting shooting guard Latrell Sprewell from the University of Alabama with the 24th overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. During the off-season, the team signed free agent Jeff Grayer.\nThe Warriors lost several of their important players to injury during the regular season; Chris Mullin missed half the season with a torn ligament in his right thumb, only playing in just 46 games, and Tim Hardaway missed 16 games with a bruised right knee. Meanwhile, sixth man Šarūnas Marčiulionis broke his right leg and dislocated his right ankle in a jogging accident before the season began, returned to play 30 games, then sat out the remainder of the season with Achilles tendonitis, and second-year star Billy Owens only played just 37 games due to a knee injury.\nBecause of the injuries, the Warriors struggled after an 18–14 start to the regular season, losing 15 of their next 17 games, including an 8-game losing streak between January and February, and held a 23–30 record at the All-Star break. After releasing oft-injured center Alton Lister to free agency in March, the team lost six of their final eight games of the season, and finished in sixth place in the Pacific Division with a 34–48 record, failing to qualify for the NBA playoffs.\nMullin averaged 25.9 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game, while Hardaway averaged 21.6 points, 10.6 assists and 1.8 steals per game, led the Warriors with 102 three-point field goals, and was named to the All-NBA Third Team, and Sprewell provided the team with 15.4 points and 1.6 steals per game, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In addition, Owens provided with 16.5 points and 7.1 rebounds per game, while Marčiulionis contributed 17.4 points and 1.7 steals per game, and second-year center Victor Alexander averaged 11.2 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. Meanwhile, second-year forward Chris Gatling averaged 9.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game off the bench, Grayer contributed 8.8 points per game in 48 games, and Tyrone Hill provided with 8.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game.\nDuring the NBA All-Star weekend at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, Mullin and Hardaway were both selected for the 1993 NBA All-Star Game, as members of the Western Conference All-Star team, but Mullin did not participate due to injury; it was Mullin's fifth and final All-Star selection. Following the season, Hill was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nOffseason\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFCC33\" width=\"10%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFCC33\" width=\"10%\"| Pick\n! style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFCC33\" width=\"20%\"| Player\n! style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFCC33\" width=\"15%\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFCC33\" width=\"15%\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#003399; color:#FFCC33\" width=\"20%\"| College\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1 || 24 || Latrell Sprewell || SG/SF ||  || Alabama\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2 || 43 || Predrag Danilović || SG/SF ||  ||\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2 || 50 || Matt Fish || C ||  || North Carolina-Wilmington\n|}\nRoster\nRegular season\nSeason standings\n:z - clinched division title\n:y - clinched division title\n:x - clinched playoff spot\nPlayer statistics\nRegular season\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|Player\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|GP\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|GS\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|MPG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|FG%\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|3P%\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|FT%\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|RPG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|APG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|SPG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|BPG\n! style=\"background:#002F6C; color:#FFFFFF; border-top:#FFCD00 3px solid; border-bottom:#FFCD00 3px solid;\"|PPG\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 79 || 8 || 16.1 || .446 || .286 || .665 || 4.0 || .9 || .6 || .5 || 5.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 77 || 69 || 35.6 || .464 || .369 || .746 || 3.5 || 3.8 || 1.6 || .7 || 15.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 74 || 66 || 28.0 || .508 || .000 || .624 || 10.2 || .9 || .6 || .5 || 8.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 72 || 59 || 24.3 || .516 || .455 || .685 || 5.8 || 1.3 || .5 || .7 || 11.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 70 || 11 || 17.8 || .539 || .000 || .725 || 4.6 || .6 || .6 || .8 || 9.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 70 || 9 || 18.4 || .437 || .339 || .747 || 2.8 || 1.3 || .7 || .3 || 6.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 66 || 66 || 39.5 || .447 || .330 || .744 || 4.0 || 10.6 || 1.8 || .2 || 21.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 48 || 12 || 21.4 || .467 || .143 || .669 || 3.3 || 1.5 || .6 || .2 || 8.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 46 || 46 || 41.3 || .510 || .451 || .810 || 5.0 || 3.6 || 1.5 || .9 || 25.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 37 || 37 || 32.5 || .501 || .091 || .639 || 7.1 || 3.9 || .9 || .8 || 16.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 30 || 8 || 27.9 || .543 || .200 || .761 || 3.2 || 3.5 || 1.7 || .1 || 17.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|†\n| 30 || 4 || 7.6 || .348 || .318 || .700 || 1.6 || .4 || .3 || .0 || 1.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 29 || 4 || 20.4 || .447 || .351 || .745 || 2.3 || 2.3 || .4 || .2 || 8.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 20 || 9 || 8.7 || .452 ||  || .538 || 2.2 || .3 || .0 || .5 || 2.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 18 || 0 || 14.9 || .439 || .000 || .778 || 1.7 || 1.7 || .6 || .3 || 4.4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|†\n| 17 || 1 || 23.9 || .456 || .000 || .759 || 4.7 || 1.4 || .9 || .4 || 11.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 8 || 0 || 17.0 || .595 || .556 || .778 || 1.4 || 2.9 || .5 || .0 || 8.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|†\n| 7 || 0 || 10.0 || .391 ||  || .800 || 2.4 || .3 || .4 || .6 || 3.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 5 || 1 || 15.6 || .240 ||  || .750 || 2.8 || .8 || .2 || .2 || 4.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 2 || 0 || 3.0 || .500 ||  ||  || 1.0 || .0 || .0 || .0 || 1.0\n|}\nPlayer Statistics Citation:\nAwards and records\n* Chris Mullin, NBA All-Star Game\n* Tim Hardaway, NBA All-Star Game\n* Tim Hardaway, All-NBA Third Team\n* Latrell Sprewell, NBA All-Rookie Team Second Team\nReferences"
