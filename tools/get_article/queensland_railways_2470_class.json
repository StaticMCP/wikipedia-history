They differed in having lighter alternators and smaller fuel tanks. A 2470 class was built by Clyde Engineering for the Townsville Harbour Board, this was later sold to Queensland Rail and renumbered as 2507.\nBetween 2000 and 2002, six were rebuilt as 2300 class locomotives at Redbank Railway Workshops.\nReferences\nto Sydney at Yeerongpilly in 1987]]"
