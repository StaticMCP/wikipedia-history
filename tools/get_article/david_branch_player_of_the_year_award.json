      "text": "# David Branch Player of the Year Award\n\nThe David Branch Player of the Year award is given out annually to the player judged to be the most outstanding in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). It is selected from three most valuable players of the respective leagues; the Red Tilson Trophy of Ontario Hockey League (OHL), the Michel Brière Memorial Trophy of the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), and the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The trophy was known as the CHL Player of the Year award until the 2019–20 season, when it was renamed for David Branch who served as president of the CHL from 1996 to 2019.\nAs of the 2023–24 selection, the award has been given to players in the OHL 20 times, players in the QMJHL 18 times, and players in the WHL 12 times. Sidney Crosby (2003–04, 2004–05) and Alexis Lafrenière (2018–19, 2019–20) are the only repeat winners.\nWinners\nList of winners of the CHL Player of the Year award.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
