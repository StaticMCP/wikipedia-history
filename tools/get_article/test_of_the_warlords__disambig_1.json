Its associated code is CM1 and is TSR's product number 9117. The adventure takes place in Norwold, which is located in the north east corner of the Known World on Mystara. This campaign contains elements of hack-and-slash adventure, political intrigue and full-scale war.\nPlot summary\nTest of the Warlords is a campaign setting with an adventure scenario in which dominions are being set up in the land of Norwold.\nThe fame of the player characters have earned them the right and title to run a realm of their own, under the supervision of the king of Norwold, a newly colonized region to the north of Mystara. But even from the start, with all the troubles of establishing your own pockets of civilization in as yet untamed wilderness, Norworld has become the center of attention in the struggle between two old enemies: The sorcerous empire of Alphatia and the war-mongering realm of Thyatis.\nPublication history\nCM1 Test of the Warlords was written by Douglas Niles, with a cover by Clyde Caldwell, and interior illustrations by Jeff Easley, and was published by TSR in 1984 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder.\nReception\nThe French RPG magazine La Gazette du Donjon gave this adventure a rating of 4 out of 5, saying, \"Much more than a single scenario, this is intended to serve as a backstory to a game and to allow a campaign to be designed. It is very useful for dungeon masters inexperienced in management of 'high level' campaigns and who only have an approximate idea of how to assign and manage a domain.\"\nTable of Contents\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
