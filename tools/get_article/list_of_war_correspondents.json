A Russian of high class, he was an enlisted officer in the Caucasus, where he had gone arguably to escape his gambling, and the debts he had accrued.  At the age of 26, he went to the site of the siege of Sevastopol, during the Crimean War, 1854.  He wrote despatches there for the St Petersburg literary journal/newspaper The Contemporary. His essays based on his observances of boredom, rubbish dumping, meaningless suffering and disorder provided the basis for three publications, the Sevastopol Sketches. These were commended by the Czarina and translated into the French at her request. Tolstoy narrated the conditions, the bravery and the boredom encountered by the troops.
