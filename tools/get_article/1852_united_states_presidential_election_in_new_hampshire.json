Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nNew Hampshire voted for the Democratic candidate, Franklin Pierce, over the Whig Party candidate, Winfield Scott. Pierce won his home state by a margin of 25.76%. His margin of victory in New Hampshire is the second largest for a Democrat, surpassed only by Lyndon B. Johnson's 27.78% in 1964.\nBoth Pierce and Free Soil Party candidate John P. Hale were from New Hampshire. Pierce had been born in Hillsborough while Hale was born in Rochester.\nThis would be the last election when New Hampshire voted for the Democratic Party until Woodrow Wilson won it in 1912 with a narrow plurality, as the anti-slavery Republican Party would monopolize the state at a presidential level between 1856 and 1908. It was to also be the last election that a Democrat won a majority of the vote in the state until Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.\nThis would also be the last time a Democrat would carry every single county until Barack Obama in 2008, and the second to last time overall.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1852 United States presidential election in New Hampshire\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic\n|Franklin Pierce\n| align=\"right\" |28,503\n| align=\"right\" |56.40%\n| align=\"right\" |5\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#F0C862; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Whig\n|Winfield Scott\n| align=\"right\" |15,486\n| align=\"right\" |30.64%\n| align=\"right\" |0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#CCCC66; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Free Soil\n|John P.
