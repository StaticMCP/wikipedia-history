In the same vein, the southern secessionists also called for a boycott. Yemeni police said they had arrested \"hardliners\" from the movement who sought to forcefully prevent people from voting.\nPoll-related violence\nDespite the ongoing uprising and reactions that continued to cause violence, other poll related violence included at least two attacks near polling stations prior to the vote. One of the attacks occurred the day before the election in Aden, a stronghold of the Southern Movement seeking to secede and restore an independent South Yemen, that result in the death of one soldier.
