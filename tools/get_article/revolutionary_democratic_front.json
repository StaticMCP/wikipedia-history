It was aligned with the FMLN guerrilla movement in the Salvadoran Civil War. The FDR was formed in 1980, through the merger of the Salvadoran Democratic Front and the Revolutionary Mass Coordination, itself an alliance of the People's Revolutionary Bloc, the People's Liberation Movement, the February 28 Popular Leagues, the Unified Popular Action Front, and the Union of Democratic Nationalists. In 1987, the constituent organizations rebranded as the Democratic Convergence Party and participated in politics legally for the first time in the 1991 election, receiving 12.16% of the vote.\nReferences"
