Over the centuries, heavy cart-wheels have cut deep grooves in its setts.\nOnce painted by the artist L. S. Lowry, it fell into an extreme state of dilapidation, overrun with pigeons and seagulls. Berwick Preservation Trust then stepped in and created a plan for the renovation of the lane's major building, Dewar's Lane Granary.\nThe Granary (which is situated on Dewar's Lane) has recently been strapped (as it has a tilt greater than the Leaning Tower Of Pisa) and transformed into a Youth Hostel, Bistro, Major Art Gallery and Public Meeting Rooms. The restored building is not only accessible from street level but also has access from both Berwick's Elizabethan Walls and Historic Quayside. This £5ml renovation will now remove what was considered to be the largest eyesore in the town.\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070117034131/http://www.familytraits.co.uk/berwick_upon_tweed_moments_in_time.html Local article] Information and images of places of interest around Berwick upon Tweed"
