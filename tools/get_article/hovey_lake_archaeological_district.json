It is one of many substantial archaeological locations in Point Township: a very cursory survey of the county in the 1940s found fifteen different villages in the township, most of them within  of one or both rivers.  Today, it is one of three National Register-listed archaeological locations in Point Township, along with the Ashworth Archaeological Site and the Murphy Site; as well, the township includes the Hovey Lake-Klein and Welborn Village sites, which were deemed eligible for the National Register but were not added purely because of objections by property owners.\nSee also\n*List of archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana\nReferences"
