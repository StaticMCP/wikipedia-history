Tsunoda Tasaku made a claim for Warungu having \"the strongest syntactic ergativity\" of all the world's languages. The claim has been challenged by Robert M. W. Dixon who believes that the conversational material on which it is based is vitiated by confusions in the informant.\nCountry\nMount Garnet marks their northern border. From there their territory extended southeast along the Herbert River.\nSociety\nThe Warrongo bore close linguistic and cultural affinities with the Gudjal and Gugu Badhun peoples, all three occupying the Herbert and Upper Burdekin rivers.\nLike other contiguous groups of this area, the Warrango divided their members into four \"skin\" sections:\n* gorgorro (polite form:goynba), totem = carpet snake(gabol)/sparrowhawk (garrgay)\n* gorgilla (polite form:woragaja), totem = crow (wajagan)/eaglehawk (gorrijala)\n* won.go   (polite form:wolmirri), totem = echnidna (barrbira)/dove (?gorraga)\n* wojorro  (polite formn:yawonya), totem = eagelhawk/carpet snake/emu (gondolo) }}\nHistory of contact\nTin was discovered in the vicinity of Warrongo territory, in the Wild river area in 1880. John Atherton's Cashmere station, and the Gunnawarra station, were established on their territory in the mid-1870s. The surging influx of miners led to many clashes and massacres. At Blencoe Falls, a group of Warrongo were driven off the cliffs to plunge into the gorge. Very little knowledge survived of these people.\nLast speakers\n* Alf Palmer, boatbuilder, who also knew Jirrbal, Girramay, and Warrgamay. His mother Lucy was one of the people pushed into the gorge to drown at Blencoe Falls.\nSome words\n* warrngu (woman)\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
