      "text": "# Awarded goal\n\nIn ice hockey, an awarded goal is an unusual situation in which a goal is awarded to a team rather than scored. A penalty shot is a type of penalty awarded when a team loses a clear scoring opportunity on a breakaway because of a foul committed by an opposing player. The fouled player is given an attempt to score a goal without opposition from any defending players except the goaltender (\"goalie\"). However, when such a lost opportunity occurs and the opposing team has pulled its goalie to substitute an extra attacker and the puck is in the neutral or attacking zone when the foul occurs, a goal is simply awarded without a penalty shot taking place. The assumption is that, if not for the foul, the goal would have been scored.\nIn the Deutsche Eishockey Liga and National Hockey League, a goal can also be awarded if the goaltender deliberately knocks the goalpost off its moorings to stop a breakaway.\nA goal can also be automatically awarded during a penalty shot or a shootout, if the goaltender attempts to stop the attacker performing the penalty shot in an illegal manner.\nSee also\n* Goaltending penalty in basketball\n* Penalty try in rugby union and rugby league\n* Unfair act in gridiron football\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
