The latter attacked Constantine and devastated the neighboring lands, then turned to Bejaia and besieged it. However, he soon broke camp in order to find a better position from which to besiege the city; it was in a place called Souk-el Khamis, in the valley of Bejaïa, that the Zayinid general decided to build a fortress in order to continue the blockade on Béjaïa. This fortress was completed in forty days and took the name of Temzezdekt.\nBattle\nIn 1327, the Hafsid caliph Abu Yahya Abu Bakr sent an army under the command of Abu Abdallah Ibn Seid en-Nas, against the fortress of Temzezdekt. Moussa Al-Kurdi learns of their approach and gathers his troops, the two armies meeting near the fortress, with the resulting battle ending in the defeat of the Hafsids.\nConsequences\nThe defeat of Abu Abdallah led to the capture of his camp by the Zayanids and the death of the leader of the Christian converts who guarded the port of the ruler of Tunis, Dafer el-Kebir. Abu Abdallah then barricaded himself behind the walls of Bejaia.\nSee also\n* Siege of Béjaïa (1326-1329)\n* Battle of er Rias\n* Capture of Tunis (1329)\nReferences"
