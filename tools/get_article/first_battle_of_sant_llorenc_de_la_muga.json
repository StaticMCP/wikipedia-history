Two weeks earlier, the French had driven the Spanish army from French territory in the Second Battle of Boulou. Pierre Augereau's division was separated from the main body of Dugommier's army and La Unión hoped to take advantage of its isolation. The Spanish mounted an overly complex attack on Sant Llorenç de la Muga that Augereau's French division repulsed.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
