He was the youngest son of George Hambly Rowe, a Wesleyan minister, and Lydia Ramshall of London.  He was educated at private schools, then studied medicine under Joseph Denton of Leicester and others.  He qualified as a doctor in 1856.  He was appointed to the army medical staff in 1862 and assigned to Lagos in West Africa. Rowe married Susannah, daughter of William Gatliff of Hawker Hall, Whitby, Yorkshire.  They had one son, who died young.\nColonial surgeon\nRowe arrived in Lagos in July 1862 and was soon appointed a judicial assessor in the chief magistrate's court and a slave commissioner, a difficult position. He afterwards became colonial surgeon. Rowe got on well with the local people, who would later call him \"Old Red Breeches\", and was made a commandant of the eastern districts. He was appointed special commissioner to make a treaty with the town of Epe in the Ijebu Kingdom. He returned home on leave in July 1864, and continued his studies in Aberdeen, graduating in medicine and surgery in 1865.\nRowe returned to West Africa in 1866 and stayed in Cape Coast Castle.\nHe was again made colonial surgeon and superintendent of the Hausas in Lagos in 1867.\nIn 1869 he also was a magistrate and clerk of the council of Lagos. He was promoted staff surgeon in the army on 4 July 1870.\nHe returned for a stay in England, then was dispatched to the Gold Coast in January 1872.\nOn 1 March 1973 he was appointed surgeon-major.\nHe may have advised Nathaniel King and Sylvester Cole, members of the Sierra Leone elite, to study medicine at Aberdeen.\nKing graduated in 1876 and returned to practice in Lagos, while Cole graduated in 1883 and entered government service in the Gold Coast.\nIn 1873 Rowe was involved in action against the Ashantis and twice saw action near Elmina, for which he was decorated with a medal and clasp.\nHe was appointed to the Ashanti expeditionary force under Captain John Hawley Glover.\nThrough his experience in working with the local people he helped to enlist Yoruba volunteers.\nHe was appointed C.M.G. in 1874 for his services in the Anglo-Ashanti wars.\nIn 1875, he became colonial surgeon of the Gold Coast colony.\nRowe retired from the army on 4 December 1876 with the honorary rank of brigade-surgeon.\nColonial administrator\nThe Gambia\nWhile still in the army, Rowe was in turn head of the governments of the Gambia and Sierra Leone.\nThe Gambia was governed from Sierra Leone during this period.\nSurgeon Major Rowe was appointed administrator of the Gambia in June 1875.\nThe former administrator, C. H. Kortright, had left the Gambia on 12 February 1875 and Captain Henry T. M. Cooper was acting as administrator.\nSamuel Rowe arrived on 2 July 1875, but transferred to Sierra Leone the next day, leaving Cooper to continue as acting administrator.\nRowe left Bathurst to take office in Freetown, Sierra Leone, as acting governor.\nCooper died on 9 January 1877 and on 30 March 1877 Surgeon Major Valesius S. Gouldsbury arrived to take office as administrator.\nSierra Leone\nIn Rowe's first tour of duty as governor of Sierra Leone in 1875–81 he was supported by the Colonial Office in pursuing a policy of aggressive colonial intervention in the interior.\nHe led two successful expeditions against the Sherbro people.\nOn 29 April 1887 Rowe returned to the Gambia as administrator, replacing the acting administrator Gilbert T. Carter.\nDuring his brief term of office various local rulers agreed to accept British protection.\nOn 12 June 1887 Rowe was promoted to governor-in-chief of the West Africa settlements.\nOn 27 November 1887 he left the Gambia and was replaced by T. Risely Griffith as acting administrator.\nWhile governor-in-chief of the British West African Settlements he continued to act as governor of Sierra Leone.\nAs governor in chief he opposed cession of the Gambia, and strongly opposed the Colonial Office police of giving in to the demands from the French.\nHe planned the expedition by administrator V. S. Gouldsbury to the upper Gambia River in 1881.\nOn 20 April 1880 Rowe was made K.C.M.G. (Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George).\nHe was replaced in Sierra Leone by A. E. Havelock in 1881.\nThe acting governor got news of Havelock's appointment from a foreign consul some weeks before this was confirmed by the Colonial Office.\nGold Coast and Lagos\nOn 28 January 1881 Rowe became governor of the Gold Coast and Lagos.\nThis was a better-paid position than Sierra Leone.\nHe replaced W. Brandford Griffith.\nHe managed to avoid another war with the Ashantis through his diplomacy.\nIn March 1883 Rowe issued an ordinance establishing registry offices for instruments affecting land in the Gold Coast Colony.\nIn 1884 he was replaced by W. A. G. Young.\nWest Africa Settlements\nOn 30 December 1884 Rowe was again appointed governor of the West Africa settlements in response to a special petition of the traders and others.\nRowe took office in 1885, replacing A. E. Havelock.\nDuring his second term, following the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, British activity in the interior increased and there was growing competition with the French, who had colonial ambitions in the same region.\nRowe was given enlarged powers to annex land to the north and east of Sierra Leone.\nOn 11 November 1885 he signed the Havelock Draft Convention, which fixed the northwest boundary of Liberia at the southeast bank of the Mano River, making Sierra Leone and Liberia coterminous.\nIn 1886 Rowe was made an LL.D. by Aberdeen University.\nIn August 1887 the Secretary of State for the Colonies said he had received a report from Rowe saying the chiefs of Jarra and Fogni, who had been suffering from raids by slave traders, had offered to place their territories under British protection.\nRowe's health began to fail in 1887, in part due to worries about the advance of the French in the region.\nOn his way home to recuperate he died at Madeira on 28 August 1888.\nHe was replaced as governor by J. M. Maltby.\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n|title=Colonial System of Administration in Gambia|work=Access Gambia\n|url=http://www.accessgambia.com/information/colonial-government.html|access-date=2016-08-26}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
