That was the same day as other United Kingdom local elections in order to elect members of Wokingham Unitary Council in Berkshire, England. One third of the council was up for election.\nBefore the election, the composition of the council was:\n*Conservative 41\n*Liberal Democrat 8\n*Labour 3\n*Independent 2\nBackground\nSince the previous round of elections in 2018, there had been 1 by-election, in Evendons in February 2019, which had been won by the Liberal Democrats. Richard Dolinski resigned from the Conservative Party to sit as an independent as a result of an internal vote of no confidence being put forward and subsequently passed against Cllr Charlotte Haitham-Taylor which led to her resignation as the Leader of the Council\nThe composition of the council before the election was as follows:\n{| style=\"width:60%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:; width:75.9%;\" | 41\n| style=\"background:; width:14.8%;\" | 8\n| style=\"background:; width:5.6%;\" | 3\n| style=\"background:; width:3.7%;\" | 2\n|-\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n|}\nAfter the election, the composition of the council became:\n{| style=\"width:60%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ↓\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:; width:57.4%;\" | 31\n| style=\"background:; width:29.6%;\" | 16\n| style=\"background:; width:7.4%;\" | 4\n| style=\"background:; width:5.5%;\" | 3\n|-\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n| }}\n|}\nElection result\n10\n|seats %       = 44.4\n|other seats   = 23\n|total seats   = 31\n|total seats % = 57.4\n|votes         = 14,625\n|votes %       = 37.3\n|plus/minus    = –7.8\n}}\n8\n|seats %       = 44.4\n|other seats   = 8\n|total seats   = 16\n|total seats % = 29.6\n|votes         = 15,444\n|votes %       = 39.4\n|plus/minus    = +7.7\n}}\n1\n|seats %       = 5.6\n|other seats   = 3\n|total seats   = 4\n|total seats % = 7.4\n|votes         = 6,449\n|votes %       = 16.4\n|plus/minus    = –2.4\n}}\n1\n|seats %       = 5.6\n|other seats   = 2\n|total seats   = 3\n|total seats % = 5.5\n|votes         = 1,529\n|votes %       = 3.9\n|plus/minus    = +3.3\n}}\n|seats %       = 0.0\n|other seats   = 0\n|total seats   = 0\n|total seats % = 0.0\n|votes         = 955\n|votes %       = 2.4\n|plus/minus    = +1.8\n}}\n|seats %       = 0.0\n|other seats   = 0\n|total seats   = 0\n|total seats % = 0.0\n|votes         = 156\n|votes %       = 0.3\n|plus/minus    = New\n}}\nA total of 39,148 votes were cast for candidates.\nWard results\n16.5\n}}\n27.9\n}}\n3.5\n}}\n44.4\n}}\n38.0\n}}\nThere were 17 spoiled ballots.\n13.4\n}}\n0.2\n}}\n5.1\n}}\n4.6\n}}\n28.0\n}}\nThere were 49 spoiled ballot papers.\n2.9\n}}\n3.2\n}}\n1.4\n}}\n5.1\n}}\n0.3\n}}\n33.0\n}}\nThere were 21 spoiled ballot papers.\n26.9\n}}\n12.1\n}}\n1.1\n}}\n22.0\n}}\n31.0\n}}\nThere were 16 spoiled ballot papers.\n28.0\n}}\n26.0\n}}\n15.0\n}}\n6.0\n}}\n5.1\n}}\n6.6\n}}\n35.0\n}}\nThere were 16 spoiled ballots.\n25.3\n}}\n13.7\n}}\n0.0\n}}\n10.2\n}}\n32.0\n}}\nThere were 25 spoiled ballots.\n28.5\n}}\n12.9\n}}\n2.2\n}}\n14.2\n}}\n28.0\n}}\nThere were 44 spoiled ballots.\n1.0\n}}\n16.6\n}}\n0.9\n}}\n17.6\n}}\n36.0\n}}\nThere were 42 spoiled ballots.\n19.0\n}}\n13.7\n}}\n10.8\n}}\n26.2\n}}\n25.0\n}}\nThere were 49 spoiled ballots.\n11.2\n}}\n27.3\n}}\n3.3\n}}\n33.4\n}}\n32.0\n}}\nThere were 59 spoiled ballots.\n1.3\n}}\n5.7\n}}\n12.0\n}}\n4.4\n}}\n30.0\n}}\nThere were 11 spoiled ballots.\n49.5\n}}\n26.4\n}}\n2.4\n}}\n2.9\n}}\n25.1\n}}\n35.0\n}}\nThere were 11 spoiled ballots.\n7.0\n}}\n8.2\n}}\n12.8\n}}\n4.0\n}}\n12.6\n}}\n33.0\n}}\nThere were 12 spoiled ballots.\n3.5\n}}\n11.6\n}}\n1.4\n}}\n8.1\n}}\n33.0\n}}\nThere were 27 spoiled ballots.\n34.0\n}}\n18.3\n}}\n43.9\n}}\n48.3\n}}\n28.0\n}}\nThere were 19 spoiled ballots.\n17.3\n}}\n17.3\n}}\n11.9\n}}\n2.7\n}}\n31.6\n}}\n30.0\n}}\nThere were 27 spoiled ballots.\n31.6\n}}\n18.8\n}}\n2.9\n}}\n4.2\n}}\n33.4\n}}\n33.0\n}}\nThere were 24 spoiled ballots.\n8.9\n}}\n27.7\n}}\n4.7\n}}\n35.6\n}}\n37.0\n}}\nThere were 55 spoiled ballots.\nReferences"
