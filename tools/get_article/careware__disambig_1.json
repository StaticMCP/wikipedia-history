Some careware is distributed free, and the author suggests that some payment be made to either a nominated charity, or a charity of the user's choice. Commercial careware, on the other hand, includes a levy for charity on top of the distribution charge. Careware can also involve a barter of some kind, or even a pledge to be kind to strangers.\nOverview\nThe term \"charityware\" was credited to Canadian developer Roedy Green in a 1988 issue of 2600 Magazine. One of the first known uses of the term \"careware\" appeared in Dr. Dobb's Journal in Al Stevens' C Programming Column in about 1991. Stevens was developing a user interface library and publishing the source code in monthly installments. To distribute code to readers, Stevens suggested they send him an addressed stamped mailer with a blank diskette. He copied the code onto the diskette and returned it. He also suggested that to express their appreciation they include a dollar, which he would donate to the local food bank in Brevard County, Florida. Stevens named this distribution method \"careware.\"\nPaul Lutus's careware idea involves no monetary exchange - instead it involves a request for the user to \"stop complaining for a while and make the world a better place.\"\nFor example, the vim text editor is free software but includes a request from its author, Bram Moolenaar, that users donate to ICCF Holland for work to help AIDS victims in Uganda. Vim's [http://www.vim.org/about.php Charityware license] has been declared by Richard Stallman to be GPL-compatible. Another current example is MJ's CD Archiver, a file archiver for Microsoft Windows/Linux/Mac OS X. The suggested charity is NACEF, a US-registered charity for China's Project Hope.\nA close variation of careware is donationware, which has a narrower definition than careware.\nExamples\nNon-commercial examples\n*FireFTP\n*KiXtart\n*Peazip\n*Vim (text editor)\n*Windows Live Messenger (through \"i'm\" initiative)\nCommercial examples\n*Product Red\nReferences"
