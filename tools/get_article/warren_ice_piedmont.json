The feature was photographed from the air by the U.S. Navy, 1966, and surveyed by British Antarctic Survey (BAS), 1970–73. Named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1978 after Douglas E. Warren, Director of Overseas Surveys, 1968–80, with overall responsibility for British mapping in the Antarctic.\nFurther reading\n* Jane G. Ferrigno, Alison J. Cook, Amy M. Mathie, Richard S.
