      "text": "# Apple Design Awards\n\nThe Apple Design Awards (ADAs) is an event hosted by Apple Inc. at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The purpose of the event is to recognize the best and most innovative Macintosh and iOS software and hardware produced by independent developers, as well as the best and most creative uses of Apple's products. The ADAs are awarded in categories that vary each year. The awards have been presented annually since 1997. For the first two years of their existence, they were known as the \"Human Interface Design Excellence Awards\" (HIDE Awards).\nSince 2003, the physical award given to those recognized at the awards event bore an Apple logo that would glow when touched. The trophy is a  long aluminum cube which weighs . These were engineered and built by Sparkfactor Design.\nWinners\n1997\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 1997 Human Interface Design Excellence (HIDE) Award\n|-\n! Category !! Place !! Product !!
