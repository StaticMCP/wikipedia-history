      "text": "# Peri Schwartz\n\nPeri Schwartz (October 4, 1951 – May 7, 2021) was an American painter and printmaker. Her work is held in major museums worldwide.\nLife and work\nPeri Schwartz was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Far Rockaway, New York. She received her BFA from Boston University College of Fine Arts in 1973 and an MFA from Queens College in 1975.\nSchwartz's early career concentrated on painting and drawing traditional self-portraits, portraits, and still lifes. In the early 2000s, she began to focus more on her studio as subject. Her works, many of objects from her studio such as tables, books, and paint jars, display prominent angles, shapes and lines. To guide her compositions, Schwartz centered and organized her work on a grid system. In her completed paintings, faint grid lines weave throughout though varied rather than rigid so the work is formal but not stiff.\nSchwartz began exhibiting in the United States in the 1990s.\nSchwartz lived and worked in New Rochelle, New York. Schwartz died on May 7, 2021, in White Plains, New York, at the age of 69.\nSelected collections\n* Albertina, Vienna, Austria\n* Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, UK\n* Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Paris, France\n* British Museum, London, UK\n* Fogg Museum, Cambridge, MA\n* Library of Congress, Washington, DC\n* Los Angeles Museum of Art\n* Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY\n* Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA\n* New York Public Library, New York, NY\n* Staatliche Museum, Berlin, Germany\n* Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT\nSelected exhibitions\n* 2020  Paintings & Works on Paper, Page Bond Gallery, Richmond, VA\n* 2019  Form + Color, Gerald Peters Gallery, Santa Fe, NM\n* 2018  Color & Process, Gallery NAGA, Boston, MA\n* 2017\tIn the Studio, Murray State University, Murray, KT\n* 2016  Constructing From Life, Page Bond Gallery, Richmond, VA\n* 2015  Paintings • Drawings • Prints, University of Mississippi Museum, Oxford, MS\n* 2014  Composing Paintings, Gallery NAGA, Boston, MA\n* 2013  New Watercolors and Drawings, Garvey/Simon Art Access, New York, NY\n* 2013\tDwellings, Gerald Peters Gallery, Santa Fe, NM\n* 2012\tCompositions, Page Bond Gallery, Richmond, VA\n* 2010  Color Prints, Abbott and Holder, London, UK\n* 2009 \tReflections, Hillwood Art Museum, Brookville, NY\n* 2008 \tObjects Considered, Midday Gallery, Englewood, NJ\n* 2007 \tRecent Work, Page Bond Gallery, Richmond, VA\n* 2006 \tStudio Paintings, Reeves Contemporary, New York, NY\nSee also\n* Portrait painting\n* Self-portrait\n* Still life\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.perischwartz.com/ Official website]"
