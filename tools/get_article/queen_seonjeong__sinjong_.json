Born as the youngest daughter of Duke Gangneung, a grandson of King Munjong, she became a queen consort through her marriage with her second half cousin once removed, King Sinjong. Her son, King Huijong became king after her husband's abdication. She was one of several Goryeo queens to take their mother's clan name over their father's and eventually became an ancestor of Gongyang. She was the youngest among Queen Janggyeong, Marchioness Daeryeong and Queen Uijeong.\nBiography\nEarly life and marriage\nThe future Queen Seonjeong was born as the fourth and youngest daughter of Wang On, Duke Gangneung. It was said that from childhood, she had a straight and bright personality, as well as having gentle and quietly behavior. She later changed her clan name to that of her mother's Kim clan, and married Duke Pyeongnyang, the youngest son of King Injong and Queen Gongye.\nPalace life\nIn 1197, her husband succeeded King Myeongjong as King Sinjong and she then was honoured as a Primary Consort (). She was reportedly a devoted and virtue wife to Sinjong, whom she advised and assisted in his royal duties, it was said that they two had a good and close relationship each other because of this.\nIn April 1204, when her husband abdicated and their son, Wang Yŏng ascended the throne as the new King, she was made Queen Dowager. King Huijong attempted to kill Ch'oe Ch'ung-hŏn, the de facto ruler of the nation, and was deposed. Then, her nephew Wang Suk ascended and after that was succeeded by his son, Wang Ch'ŏl. At this time, she had been queen dowager for 18 years.\nIt was said that she was excellent at weaved since young, even Ch'oe Ch'ung-hŏn deposed Huijong, she endured difficulties and was sober, so there were no any disturbance. But, when Ch'oe died, she always suffered and defended herself by refraining from suffering. As the Queen Mother, she then moved to Gyeongheung Mansion () in Jangchu Hall (). Sometimes, her palace can be Eunggyeong Mansion () in Subok Hall (). Even in a very chaotic situation when Gangjong and Gojong ascended the throne, she was admired by their peoples for showing off her dignified appearance as the eldest in the royal family.\nAccording to Goryeosa, King Gojong raised empress dowager () to grand empress dowager () in 1123, but it was unclear whether it referred to her (Sinjong's widow) or Queen Wondeok (Gangjong's widow). If it was her, her title would be the Grand Empress Dowager Seonjeong () instead of Empress Dowager Seonjeong ().\nArts\nTo honour his grandaunt, King Gojong ordered Yi Kyu-bo to write a poem to commemorate her. This poem, \"Everything From the Grand Queen Dowager\" () was recorded in the 16th volume of the Collected Works of Minister Yi of Korea and it was said that Seonjeong was given the honorary title of \"The Supreme Imperial Mother\" () during her lifetime, while her eldest son became \"Retired Emperor\" () and her granddaughter became \"Queen Consort\" (). King Gojong praised her effort into the stability of the royal family, rather than getting involved in politics during Goryeo's difficult times.\nDeath and Posthumous name\nThe Queen Dowager outlived 18 years than her late husband and later on 17 August 1222 (9th year reign of King Gojong), she died and was buried in Jilleung Tomb (), near Gaeseong, North Korea. Then, she was given a Posthumous name under King Gojong's command:\n*In October 1253, name Sin-heon () was added to her posthumous name.\nThe last King of Goryeo, Gongyang, was King Sinjong and Queen Seonjeong's descendant from their 2nd son, Duke Yangyang.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0028910 Queen Seonjeong] on Encykorea .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000738563 선정태후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
