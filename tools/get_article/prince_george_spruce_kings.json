They are members of the Coastal East Division of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). They play their home games at the Kopar Memorial Arena, which has a capacity of 2,112. The Spruce Kings won their first Fred Page Cup in the 2018-19 BCHL season.\nHistory\nFounded in 1972, the Spruce Kings originally were a part of the Pacific Northwest Hockey League.  In 1975, the Spruce Kings and the neighboring Quesnel Millionaires joined the Peace Junior B Hockey League, which renamed itself the Peace-Cariboo Junior Hockey League. In 1980, the league was promoted to Junior A and the Spruce Kings won the league's first Junior A championship. From 1980 until 1996, the Kings won nine league titles.  In 1981, the Spruce Kings defeated Fort St. John Golden Hawks 4-games-to-3 to claim their first Junior A title.\nIn 1994, the Royal City Outlaws had joined the British Columbia Hockey League as an expansion franchise. In 1996, the Spruce Kings bought out the BCHL rights of the Outlaws, using the rights to move the Spruce Kings into the BCHL.\nThe Prince George Spruce Kings hosted the Royal Bank Cup in 2007. They lost in an anticlimactic final after surviving a record-setting quintuple overtime match in the semi-final versus the Camrose Kodiaks. Spruce King goalie Jordan White made 91 saves in the 3–2 victory. At 146 minutes, it was the longest game in Royal Bank Cup history.\nSeason-by-season record\nPacific Northwest Hockey League\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime
