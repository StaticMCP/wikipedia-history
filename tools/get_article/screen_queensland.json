      "text": "# Screen Queensland\n\nScreen Queensland is an agency of the Queensland Government which seeks to expand the production of movies, television series, and computer games within Queensland, Australia. It provides financial support to attract producers to use Queensland as a filming location or for other related services, e.g. post-production. It supports skills development of Queenslanders in the industry and the holding of film festivals and other events. It seeks to increase the involvement of Indigenous Australians in the industry. It often partners with Screen Australia which has similar objectives for Australia.\nScreen Queensland owns Screen Queensland Studios, which are film studios located in Hemmant, Brisbane, available for rental by film makers. The Brisbane studio opened in 2019. In April 2024, another set of films studios will be opened in Portsmith, Cairns. It also partners with Village Roadshow Studios at Oxenford on the Gold Coast.\nWhile Screen Queensland has used its funding to attract major international productions, such as Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, to be filmed in Queensland, the local industry believe that the funding would be better used to support local productions.\nReferences"
