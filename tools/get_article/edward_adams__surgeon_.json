He became interested in natural history as a child. He qualified as a surgeon in April&nbsp;1847, and in August of the same year became an assistant surgeon at the Royal Hospital Haslar in Gosport, Hampshire, before securing a transfer to the Naval Hospital in Devonport three months later.\nArctic exploration\nRoss expedition\nIn 1848, four months after his transfer to Devonport, he volunteered to join Sir James Clark Ross on his Arctic expedition to search for traces of Sir John Franklin's missing Northwest Passage expedition. Adams was aboard  under Captain Edward Joseph Bird. They left in May&nbsp;1848, but returned 18&nbsp;months later without success.\nCollinson expedition\nIn January 1850, Adams left on another expedition to look for Franklin. This time he was aboard  under Captain Richard Collinson. They reached the Bering Strait in August, and Adams was put ashore at St. Michael, just north of the Yukon delta, to investigate reports of possible survivors from Franklin's crew. He rejoined the Enterprise in July&nbsp;1851, sailing east below Banks Island and Victoria Island, and penetrating further east than any ship previously. They returned to England in 1855.\nSierra Leone\nAdams passed his full naval surgeon's exams, and travelled to west Africa in May&nbsp;1856, on board the steamship Hecla. He died there of typhus, and was buried at Sierra Leone.\nIn naming the yellow-billed loon, English zoologist George Robert Gray honoured by Adams naming its species epithet after him: Gavia adamsii.\nReferences\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links"
