Edward Bouverie (20 September 1760 – 30 December 1824) was an English politician.\nEarly life\nBouverie was born on 20 September 1760. He was the third son of William Bouverie, 1st Earl of Radnor and, his second wife, Rebecca Alleyne, daughter of John Alleyne, of Four Hills, Barbados, and sister of Sir John Alleyne, 1st Baronet.L.

In 1794, he was wounded in a duel with the 4th Earl of Tankerville who reportedly \"resented his attentions to his daughter Lady Anne Bennet.\"\nHe served as Commissioner of Transports from June 1803 to January 1806 and Commissioner of the Navy from July 1805 until his death. Upon the Prince of Wales' ascension to the throne in 1820 as King George IV, Bouverie became a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, holding that tile until his death in 1824.\nBouverie was returned as a Member of Parliament for Downton from 1796 until 1803.\nPersonal life\nOn 24 May 1782, Bouverie married Lady Catherine Murray (1760–1783), the eldest daughter of John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore and Lady Charlotte Stewart (eldest daughter of the 6th Earl of Galloway). Lady Catherine died, without surviving issue, on 7 July 1783.\nAfter her death, he married Arabella Ogle (1762–1855), daughter of Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle, 1st Baronet and Hester Thomas (daughter of John Thomas, Bishop of Winchester), on 20 December 1785. Like his first marriage, Arabella had one son who died young.\nBouverie died on 30 December 1824 at age 64, without issue. After his death, his widow remarried to Hon. Robert Talbot, son of Col. Richard Talbot and Margaret Talbot, 1st Baroness Talbot of Malahide, on 7 October 1828 before her eventual death on 29 October 1855.\nReferences"
