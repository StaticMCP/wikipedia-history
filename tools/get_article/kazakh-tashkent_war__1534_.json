Long before that, Kasym Khan annexed the lands of the Noag horde during the Kazakh-Nogai War (1515-1521), but after his death, the Nogais, as Trepavlov writes, began the Nogai \"reconquista\" by reconquering their lands and the capital, driving the Kazakhs beyond the Irtysh. But already in 1530, the Kazakhs knocked out the Nogais across the Emba River.\nWar\nThe struggle between the Kazakh rulers and the Shaybanids continued even after Tahir Khan left the historical scene. In fact, until 1537 the Kazakhs posed a real threat to the northern territories of the Uzbek state. Archive documents show that during these years they attempted to take Tashkent from the Shaybanids.\nIn September 1536, a letter from the Russian ambassador D. Gubin was delivered to Moscow, stating: }}\nIt is also known that the Kazakhs defeated the Uzbeks twice.\nThe campaigns of the Kazakh army and the threat of losing Tashkent forced Ubaydallah Khan to seek allies. He found it in the person of a Chagatai (more specifically - Timurid) Abd ar-Rashid Khan, the ruler of the Mughal state. As a result of negotiations, an Uzbek-Mughal military alliance emerged. It was concluded at the mountain pass of \"Ak-Boguz\" in opposition to the Kazakh-Kyrgyz alliance, which had formed during the reign of Kazakh Khan Tahir. The alliance between Uzbeks and Mughals was cemented by a dynastic marriage. Ubaydallah married one of the sisters of Abd ar-Rashid Khan.\nConsequences\nIn 1537, Uzbeks, Moguls and Nogais defeated the Kazakhs in the battle of San Tash, killing 37 Kazakh sultans.\n“The Uzbek troops captured the cities of Sawran, Sayram, Suzak, Sighnaq, and Turkistan from the Kazakhs\nNotes"
