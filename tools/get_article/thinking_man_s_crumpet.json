Bakewell is still synonymous with the phrase, but it has subsequently been applied to other high-profile women such as Anne Gregg, Joanna Lumley, Kate Bush and Felicity Kendal, and, more recently, Helen Mirren, Lucy Worsley and Gillian Anderson. In a poll in the Radio Times in 2003, Nigella Lawson received the most votes to be the readers' \"thinking man's crumpet\".\nAlmost half a century after Muir deployed the term, Bakewell (by then Baroness Bakewell and a Dame Commander of the British Empire) remarked that \"it has taken me a lifetime to live it down. It was meant as a compliment I suppose, but it was a little bit of a put-down\".\nActors Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth and Bill Nighy have been called \"the thinking woman's crumpet\" by the press.\nAfter the release of the 1997 film Titanic, Kate Winslet was dubbed by one newspaper as \"the sinking man's crumpet\".\nStewart Lee called Andrew Graham-Dixon \"the crumpet man's thinker.\"\nReferences"
