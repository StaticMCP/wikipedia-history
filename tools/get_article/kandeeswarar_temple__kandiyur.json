Shiva is worshiped as Kandeeswarar, and is represented by the lingam and his consort Parvati is depicted as Mangalanayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th-century-CE Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil poet saints known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. As per legends, Shiva is believed to have destroyed eight different demons and the eight Ashta Veeratanam temples are built signifying each of his victories in the war. The temple is one of the eight where Shiva is believed to have removed one of the five heads of Brahma.\nThere are many inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from: Cholas, Thanjavur Nayaks and Thanjavur Maratha kingdom. The temple has numerous shrines. The shrines of Kandeeswarar and Mangalanayagi are the most prominent. The temple-complex houses many halls and three precincts. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and many yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is one of the Sapthastanams of Aiyarappar temple and the Sapthastanam festival celebrated during the month of January is the most prominent festival in the temple, and the region. The temple is maintained and administered by Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Many temples have same name, Kandeshwarar Temple is also in Thamarankottai, a village in Pattukottai taluk of Thanjavur district.\nLegend\nAs per Hindu legend, Brahma, the Hindu god of creation and Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction, had originally five heads. Parvati, the wife of Shiva, once got confused and performed patha pooja (ablution of feet, considered an act of respect) to Brahma, instead of Shiva. Shiva got enraged and cut off one of Brahma's heads; the cut head got stuck in his hand due to Brahma's curse. To get rid off the sin, Shiva worshipped Vishnu at Thirukarambanur as Bhikshatana, where a part of his sin was relieved. He got his curse fully relieved after visiting Vishnu at Thirukandiyur and taking a holy dip in the temple tank, Kamala Pushkarani. Since Vishnu relieved (vimochana) the sin (saabha) of Shiva (also called Hara), the temple is called Hara Sabha Vimochana temple. After the incident, the tank came to be known as Kapala Theertham (kapala indicates skull). Shiva was pleased and he built the Hara Sabha Vimochana temple and also built a temple for himself near it.\nAs per another legend, Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu requested Shiva to cut off one of the heads of Brahma as she felt that Vishnu would ignore her and show all his affection towards Brahma. Sage Bhrigu, King Mahabali and Chandra (Moon) all got their sins relieved worshipping Vishnu here in the temple. Sage Bhrigu, once wanted to test the superior of Vishnu, Brahma and Shiva. He kicked Vishnu in his chest in anger and got relieved of the sin here. Chandra, who sinned by seducing the preceptor's wife, got partially relieved of it by worshipping Hara Saabha Vimochana Perumal.\nArchitecture\nThe temple is located 21&nbsp;km away from Kumbakonam on the Kumbakonam- Tiruvaiyaru- Tanjore road.

As per Hindu legend, it is the wedding festival of Nandikeswara, the sacred bull of Shiva on the Punarpoosa Star during the Tamil month of Panguni. The festival deity of Aiyarappar temple of Thiruvaiyaru is carried in a decorated glass palanquin along with the images of Nandikeswara and Suyasayambikai to the temples in Thirupazhanam, Thiruchottruthurai, Thiruvedhikudi, Thirukandiyur and Thirupoonthurthi. Each of the festival deities of the respective temples mounted in glass-palanquins, accompany Aiyarppar on the way to the \"final destiny\", Thillaistanam. There is a grand display of fireworks in the Cauvery Riverbed outside Thillaistanam Temple. The seven palanquins are carried to the Aiyarappar Temple in Thiruvaiyyaru. Hundreds of people witness the convergence of seven glass-palanquins carrying principal deities of respective temples from seven places at Tiruvaiyaru.
