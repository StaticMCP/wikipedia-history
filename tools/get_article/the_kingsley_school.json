It traditionally educated girls from 3 to 18, with the co-educational preparatory school also educating boys up to the age of 11. From September 2025 it will begin its transition to become fully co-educational through to 18.\nThe senior school occupies an adapted and extended Victorian manor house. On the opposite side of the road is the junior school. The nearby sixth form centre is self-contained. The playing fields occupy a site on the outskirts of the town. It was founded as a Church of England school, and now accepts pupils of all faiths and of none.\nHistory\nThe school was founded as Leamington High School as a girls' school in 1884 by Rose Kingsley, daughter of the writers Frances and Charles Kingsley. The founding Girls' Public Day School Company head was Florence Gadesden who was a graduate of Girton College. She moved on after two years, leaving the school well-established.\nThe school moved to its present site in 1922, and took its present name in 1949.\nHeadteachers\n*1884–1886: Florence Gadesden\n*1886–1909: Mary Huckwell\n*1909–1916: Anne Loveday\n*1916–1932: Lilias Milroy\n*1932–1961: Dorothy Sweet\n*1961–1977: Nesta Jones\n*1977–1988: Cynthia Fairhurst\n*1988–1997: Margaret Webster\n*1997–2010: Christine Mannion-Watson\n*2010–2020: Heather Owens\n*2020–2022: Christina McCullough\n*2022–December 2023: James Mercer-Kelly\n*January 2024–present: Sarah Howling\nNotable former students\n* Sophie Robinson, interior designer and television presenter\n* Priscilla Young, social worker\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.thekingsleyschool.co.uk/ Official Web Site]\n* [http://www.isi.net/HistoricalReports/0604_07.htm Independent Schools Inspectorate Report]"
