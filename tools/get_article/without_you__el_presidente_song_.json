It reached number 30 on the British singles chart. One of the reasons for its success was heavy promotion upon its release. From its release on 25 July 2006, there was a Top of the Pops performance, a TRL performance, an article in The Sun, a live session on ''The Dermot O'Leary Show on BBC Radio 2 (on which they performed Without You, and Raspberry Beret), and an Xfm session (taped in May 2006, on which they performed \"Without You\", \"100MPH\", and \"Hanging Around\").\nIn Japan, the single entered the chart via import at  number 46, then rose as high as number 9.\nIn 2008, the song was included in the soundtrack of the film Made of Honor''."
