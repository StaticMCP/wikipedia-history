He discovered numerous fish species previously unknown to science and was the third most active describer of those new species in New Zealand from 1870 to 1905. Clarke was also an artist and a collection of his scientific illustrations is held at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.\nBiography\nEarly life\nClarke was born in Suffolk, England on 20 December 1848, son of Edward Clarke, Esq., M.D., L.M., M.H.S. and Anne Leah Clarke (nee Clarkson).  In early 1876 Clarke was appointed Chief draftsman in the Survey Department in Westland.\nScientific and artistic contributions\nClarke was a member of the New Zealand Institute, as the Royal Society of New Zealand was then known, and was a trustee of the Westland Institute.  He read his scientific papers before the Westland Institute, the Hokitika Literary Society and the Wellington Philosophical Society. His papers would subsequently be forwarded to the New Zealand Institute for publication.\nAmongst Clarke's scientific discoveries, he was the first uncover the presence of Himantolophind angelfishes in New Zealand in 1877. Clarke obtained the specimen of Himantolophus appelii, which he described in his scientific paper, from Mr Appel of Hokitika and named the species in his honour.\nClarke also obtained a fish specimen collected on 6 August 1878 by W. Duncan. Clarke subsequently described and named that species as Argentina decagon and forwarded the specimen to the Colonial Museum, now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, where it is still kept. However Clarke had been preempted by Frederick Hutton who had described the new species as Argentina elongata in January 1879. Clarke is unlikely to have seen Hutton's description.\nSome time in or around 1894 Clarke was transferred from the Survey Department in Westland. Prior to him leaving he was presented with an illuminated address by the Mayor of Hokitika on behalf of the citizens of Hokitika. The address expressed their appreciation of Clarke's work and in particular their recognition of his \"study and original observations of the fish of this coast\".\nSir James Hector is recorded as saying of Clarke that Clarke's \"knowledge of fish was minute and accurate, and it would be difficult to exaggerate the beauty and scientific fidelity of his drawings. A special value attached to these drawings inasmuch as some represented rare and others absolutely unique specimens which had come under Mr. Clarke's observation\". Hector hoped the collection of Clarke's drawings would be purchased in its complete form by a museum. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa did in fact purchase Clarke's drawings and watercolours from his wife in 1921.\nClarke also designed the common seal for the Municipal Corporation of Kumara.\nMarriage and children\nClarke married Margaret Mulvihill, only daughter of Michael Mulvihill, Esq., of Stafford, on 17 March 1873 at St. Patrick's Church, Ross, West Coast. He and his wife had the following children:\n* Ernest Edward Clarke (24 February 1877)\n* Norman Frank Clarke (31 March 1881)\n* Ruby May Clarke (27 June 1884)\n* Margaret Ilma (Birdie) Clarke (6 April 1886)\n* Roma Kathleen Clarke (1 May 1888)\n* Frank Edward Clarke (18 September 1892)\n* Arthur Clarke (24 April 1894 - died in infancy)\nDeath\nClarke died in New Plymouth on Saturday, 1 July 1899, of heart disease, and is buried in the Te Henui Cemetery, New Plymouth.\nPublished works\n* Clarke, F.
