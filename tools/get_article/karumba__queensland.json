The town is sited at the mouth of the Norman River, and enjoys the distinction of being the only town along the southern Gulf of Carpentaria that is within sight of the Gulf itself (the Gulf's extensive tidal flats prohibits settlement elsewhere along its shore).\nThe rare Morning Glory cloud rolls through Karumba in the early hours of some mornings in September and October.\nKarumba Point Beach is the only beach in the region that is accessible by bitumen road, and is renowned for its sunset views over the Gulf of Carpentaria.\nThe port at Karumba is around the mouth of the Norman River where it enters the Gulf of Carpentaria (approx ).

They relied on the rich marine resources and fertile coastal plains for sustenance.\nThe settlement was originally known as Norman Mouth and Kimberley. The toponym, Kurumba, derives from the Aboriginal name for the area. That name was being used for the township officially by the 1880s.\nKarumba Post Office opened on 22 August 1889 and closed in 1919.\nGiven its access to the Gulf of Carpentaria, the town's economy has revolved largely around fishing.

The \"Wet\" usually lasts from December to March and is hot and humid, with wet bulb temperatures typically above  during the afternoons. Most roads during the \"Wet\" are usually closed by heavy rain, which can exceed  in a day due to the passage of tropical cyclones or monsoonal depressions which provide most of the rain. On occasions, however, as with all of Queensland the wet season may fail almost completely and produce less than  in a full season.\nThe \"Dry\" usually lasts from April to the middle of November and is much more comfortable due to lower humidity and milder morning temperatures. This period of the year is essentially bone dry and almost completely cloudless: median rainfall is nil between May and September and each month, over twenty days are completely clear.\n}}\nSee also\n* Karumba Airport\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.morningglorycloud.com morningglorycloud.com] has video of the Gulf of Carpentaria region  and the Morning Glory Cloud\n*[http://www.carpentaria.qld.gov.au/ Carpentaria Shire Council homepage]\n*[https://www.smh.com.au/news/Queensland/Karumba/2005/02/17/1108500203462.html General information from the Sydney Morning Herald]\n*[https://gisservices.information.qld.gov.au/arcgis/rest/directories/historicalscans/cad_scans/cad-map-town-karumba-1979.jpg Town map of Karumba, 1979]"
