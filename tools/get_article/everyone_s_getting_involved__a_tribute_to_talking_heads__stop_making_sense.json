The tribute album, made in celebration of the film and album's 40th anniversary, features covers of the sixteen tracks of Stop Making Sense performed by musicians including Miley Cyrus, Lorde, and Paramore. The album was released by A24 Music on May 17, 2024, and debuted at the top of the Billboard Compilation Albums chart in August.\nBackground\nOn March 16, 2023, the independent film company A24 announced that they had obtained worldwide distribution rights for the 4K remaster of the 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense, starring Talking Heads and directed by Jonathan Demme. The remaster premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival, with the band reuniting for a post-screening Q&A moderated by Spike Lee, on September 11. This was followed by a limited release in IMAX theaters on September 22, and a wide release the following week.\nOn January 10, 2024, a teaser video was uploaded on both Paramore's and A24's social media. The video depicted Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams receiving a package containing a replica of the big suit Talking Heads frontman David Byrne wore on the album Stop Making Senses cover art. The video announced the album and its lineup of 16 artists and bands, including Paramore, Miley Cyrus, Lorde, Girl in Red, the National, Teezo Touchdown, Kevin Abstract, BadBadNotGood, Toro y Moi, Blondshell, DJ Tunez, Jean Dawson, Chicano Batman, the Linda Lindas, Él Mató a un Policía Motorizado, and the Cavemen. The video was directed by AJ Gibboney and Paramore drummer Zac Farro, and ended with a snippet of Paramore's rendition of \"Burning Down the House\".\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Teezo Touchdown said that while he was largely unfamiliar with Talking Heads, his colleagues showed him the opening scene of Stop Making Sense as inspiration for his own upcoming stage show, an experience he called \"a true discovery moment. With what [Byrne] was doing, and the production and the visuals, they had the total package.\" Chicano Batman singer/bassist Eduardo Arenas said he hadn't been a fan of the band, but watching Stop Making Sense around age 20 \"just changed my life. David Byrne is running in circles around the band and still singing, and the whole band is killing it.\"\nRelease\nOn January 31, Paramore released their full rendition of \"Burning Down the House\" as the album's lead single. Byrne called their version \"amazing\", and also released his cover of Paramore's 2017 song \"Hard Times\" which the band had told him was inspired by Talking Heads. Both cover songs were released as a twelve-inch single for Record Store Day 2024, for which Paramore were ambassadors that year.\nThe second single, Teezo Touchdown's cover of \"Making Flippy Floppy\", was released on February 28. Per Uproxxs Aaron Williams, the choice was fitting as Touchdown's \"music refuses categorization or simplification\", and the song's \"funky bassline and elastic groove translate well in Teezo's hands.\" On March 6, Miley Cyrus previewed her rendition of \"Psycho Killer\", a \"country twist\" on the original with some lyrics changed, at a live event at the Chateau Marmont.\nOn March 28, Lorde's cover of \"Take Me to the River\", a Talking Heads cover of a song originally recorded by Al Green, was released as the third single. On April 24, the 40th anniversary of the film's debut at the San Francisco International Film Festival, the album's release date was announced for May 17 by A24 Music. The full tracklist was also released – consisting of the sixteen-song tracklist of Stop Making Sense in order – as was the fourth single, Girl in Red's cover of \"Girlfriend Is Better\".\nReception\n| rev2 = The Guardian\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Louder\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Paste\n| rev4score = 4/10\n}}\nAssociated Presss Jim Pollock said the album \"should please old fans and inspire some new ones\", and called it \"a varied but remarkably coherent album from a broad array of artists that's a testament to the enduring excellence of Stop Making Sense.\" Dansende Berens Jordy Vermote called the album a \"fine selection of well-known and lesser-known artists was made, each of whom gave their own twist to a song, or just left perfection as it was. It is interesting to hear songs that have already proven their strength, given contemporary twists. We are happy to accept that not every jacket fits equally well, as the rest looks really good to beautiful.\"\nThe Guardians Claire Biddles said the album primarily consists of either \"karaoke-esque run-through[s]\" or reimaginings which \"feel wildly disconnected from the source material\". She called the Lorde and Linda Lindas songs \"spirited and fun\" and Él Mató a un Policía Motorizado's contribution \"slickly enigmatic\", but said those tracks are \"mildly diverting at best\" from an album which is \"just content.\" Louders Emily Swingle praised some tracks, noting the Linda Lindas's as \"arguably the finest tribute\", but called the overall album \"well-produced karaoke\" lacking on the originals' \"joyous experimentation\". Pastes Matt Mitchell called the album \"background music that never gets exciting enough to make you pull out your phone and Shazam it\", and said \"You won't think twice about this album, and you very well might just forget about it altogether once you start listening to something else.\"\nCommercial performance\nAfter the album's CD and vinyl release on July 26, it debuted at number one on Billboards Compilation Albums chart dated August 10.\nTrack listing\n| length1       = 3:44\n| title2        = Heaven\n| extra2        = The National\n| writer2       =\n| length2       = 4:17\n| title3        = Thank You for Sending Me an Angel\n| extra3        = Blondshell\n| writer3       = Byrne\n| length3       = 3:08\n| title4        = Found a Job\n| extra4        = The Linda Lindas\n| writer4       = Byrne\n| length4       = 4:12\n| title5        = Slippery People\n| extra5        = Él Mató a un Policía Motorizado\n| length5       = 5:40\n| title6        = Burning Down the House\n| extra6        = Paramore\n| length6       = 3:38\n| title7        = Life During Wartime\n| extra7        = DJ Tunez\n| length7       = 4:24\n| title8        = Making Flippy Floppy\n| extra8        = Teezo Touchdown\n| length8       = 5:53\n| title9        = Swamp\n| extra9        = Jean Dawson\n| length9       = 3:20\n| title10       = What a Day That Was\n| extra10       = The Cavemen\n| writer10      = Byrne\n| length10      = 4:30\n| title11       = This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)\n| extra11       = BadBadNotGood featuring Norah Jones\n| length11      = 4:31\n| title12       = Once in a Lifetime\n| extra12       = Kevin Abstract\n| writer12      =\n| length12      = 2:38\n| title13       = Genius of Love\n| extra13       = Toro y Moi featuring Brijean\n| writer13      =\n| length13      = 3:25\n| title14       = Girlfriend Is Better\n| extra14       = Girl in Red\n| writer14      = Byrne\n| length14      = 3:05\n| title15       = Take Me to the River\n| extra15       = Lorde\n| writer15      =\n| length15      = 4:24\n| title16       = Crosseyed and Painless\n| extra16       = Chicano Batman featuring Money Mark\n| writer16      =\n| length16      = 5:23\n}}\nPersonnel\n\"Psycho Killer\"\n* Miley Cyrus – vocals, producer\n* Maxx Morando – producer, guitar, bass, drums\n* Shawn Everett – producer, mixing engineer, synthesizer\n* Ian Gold and Piece Eatah – recording engineers\n* Jonathan Rado – guitar, synthesizer\n\"Heaven\"\n* The National – producers\n* Adam Armstrong – recording engineer\n* Craig Silvey – mixing engineer\n\"Thank You for Sending Me an Angel\"\n* Yves Rothman – producer\n* Lawrence Rothman – mixing engineer\n\"Found a Job\"\n* Carlos de la Garza – producer, recording and mixing engineer\n* Sean Dorrian – recording engineer\n\"Slippery People\"\n* Santiago Motorizado – vocals\n* Agustin Spasoff – bass, keyboards\n* Pablo Hierro – bells\n* Guillermo Ruiz Diaz – drums\n* Gustavo Monsalvo and Manuel Sanchez Villamonte – guitar\n* Pablo Mena -
