      "text": "# Timeline of the Great Recession\n\nThis article gives the timeline of the Great Recession, which hit many developed economies in the due to the 2008 financial crisis.\nNote: The date indicated is that of the official announcement by the department or the public agency in charge of the measurement of the economic activity of the country. Thus, because of possible lags in the collection of statistics, it is possible that the chronological order of reports may not correspond to the actual order of events in recession.\nDefinition of recession\nA recession is a period of two quarters of negative GDP growth. The countries listed are those that officially announced that they were in recession.\nIt is worth noting that some developed countries such as South Korea and Australia did not enter recession (indeed Australia contracted for the last quarter of 2008 only to grow 1% for the first half of 2009). Poland, then considered to be an emerging market country, also avoided the recession as a result of their strong domestic market, low private debt and flexible currency.\nTimeline overview\nThe table below displays all national recessions appearing in 2006–2013 (for the 71 countries with available data), according to the common recession definition, saying that a recession occurred whenever seasonally adjusted real GDP contracts quarter on quarter, through minimum two consecutive quarters. Only 11 out of the 71 listed countries with quarterly GDP data (Poland, Slovakia, Moldova, India, China, South Korea, Indonesia, Australia, Uruguay, Colombia and Bolivia) escaped a recession in this time period.\nThe few recessions appearing early in 2006–07 are commonly never associated to be part of the Great Recession, which is illustrated by the fact that only two countries (Iceland and Jamaica) were in recession in Q4 2007.\nOne year before the maximum, in Q1 2008, only six countries were in recession (Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Portugal and New Zealand). The number of countries in recession was 25 in Q2 2008, 39 in Q3 2008 and 53 in Q4 2008. At the steepest part of the Great Recession in Q1 2009, a total of 59 out of 71 countries were simultaneously in recession. The number of countries in recession was 37 in Q2 2009, 13 in Q3 2009 and 11 in Q4 2009. One year after the maximum, in Q1 2010, only seven countries were in recession (Greece, Croatia, Romania, Iceland, Jamaica, Venezuela and Belize).\nThe recession data for the overall G20 zone (representing 85% of all GWP), depict that the Great Recession existed as a global recession throughout Q3 2008 until Q1 2009.\nSubsequent follow-up recessions in 2010–2013 were confined to Belize, El Salvador, Paraguay, Jamaica, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand and 24 out of 50 European countries (including Greece). As of October 2014, only five out of the 71 countries with available quarterly data (Cyprus, Italy, Croatia, Belize and El Salvador), were still in ongoing recessions. The many follow-up recessions hitting the European countries, are commonly referred to as being direct repercussions of the European debt crisis.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; clear:both; white-space:nowrap; line-height:1.25; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Its last recession in 1983 saw thousands of people leave Ireland to seek work overseas.\nOctober\n*October 10, 2008:  Singapore\nFirst Asian country to slip into a recession since the credit crisis began. Singapore's export-dependent economy shrank an annualized 6.3% in the third quarter after a revised 5.7% contraction in the second quarter; its first recession since 2002. Growth has faltered in Singapore as a result of less demand for exports, a reduction in tourism, and the end of the real-estate boom. Singapore's manufacturing sector had declined 4.9% in the previous quarter.\n*October 24, 2008:  Iceland\nIceland receives a £1.3 billion (US$2.06 billion, €1.63 billion) bailout package from the International Monetary Fund as the first European country to require an emergency loan with the aim of stabilising the collapsed currency and strengthening the tax system as well as the nationalised banks.\n*October 27, 2008:  Australia\nBNP Paribas stated that Australia is in a risky position with regards to the 2008 financial crisis as foreign liabilities accounted for 60% of the nation's GDP.\n*October 28, 2008  United Kingdom\n500,000 mortgage holders are left in negative equity after house prices dropped 15% since the previous summer, with another 700,000 mortgage holders facing the same risk if prices continue to fall.\nNovember\n*November 13, 2008:  Germany\nEurope's largest economy contracted by 0.5% in the third quarter after GDP fell 0.4% in the second quarter, putting it in recession for the first time in five years.\n*November 13, 2008:  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Thailand,  The Philippines\nEquity research by Deutsche Bank states that Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines should not experience a recession, despite potential harm to economic growth from falling commodity prices and possible weaker exports.\n*November 14, 2008:  Italy\nItaly plunges into recession, its first since the start of 2005, after GDP contracts a steeper-than-expected 0.5% in the third quarter. Second quarter GDP dropped 0.3%.\n*November 14, 2008:  Hong Kong\nHong Kong becomes the second Asian economy to tip into recession, its exports hit by weakening global demand. Third-quarter GDP drops a seasonally adjusted 0.5% after a 1.4% fall in the previous quarter.\n*November 14, 2008:  Eurozone\nTaken as a whole the Eurozone officially slips under, pushed down by recessions in Germany and Italy for its first recession since its creation in 1999.\nThese 15 countries are: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain. On January 1, 2009, Slovakia adopted the euro, and so is now part of the Eurozone. Though the Eurozone suffers from recession as a whole, Belgium, France, Greece, and Slovakia still have better growth.\n*November 17, 2008:  Japan\nThe world's second-biggest economy slides into recession, its first in seven years. Its GDP contracts 0.1% in the July–September quarter, as the 2008 financial crisis curbs demand for its exports. It shrank 0.9% in the previous quarter.\n*November 23, 2008:  Hawaii\nEconomists at the University of Hawaii reported that the state entered the recession in the previous quarter based on the drop in tourist figures and growing unemployment, with 8,800 jobs expected to be cut in 2009.\n*November 28, 2008:  Canada\nIn 2008, Canada had positive GDP growth in Q2 and Q3 but GDP fell by a sharp 3.4% annualized in Q4.

The growth slowed down already in early 2008 and in the third quarter output diminished by 0.3% from the previous quarter.\nMarch\n*March 4, 2009:  Canada\nU.S. Steel announced the closure of the Stelco Lake Erie Works in Nanticoke, Ontario due to the increasingly worse effects of the global economic slowdown. While it may have decreased the local pollution levels, it also has affected 12,000 jobs both at the Lake Erie Works and in the Haldimand-Norfolk area.\n*March 4, 2009:  Malaysia\nMalaysia has a 50% chance of slipping into the recession as growth is expected to reach just 0.5% for the year, said the executive director Datuk Mohamed Ariff Abdul Kareem of the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research.\nMay\n*May 15, 2009:  France,  Austria,  Belgium,  Romania,  Lithuania,  Luxembourg,  Portugal,  Hungary\nThe French Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies announced that French gross domestic product shrank 1.2% in the first quarter of 2009 after falling by 1.5% in the final quarter of 2008. The French economy had avoided narrowly a recession in 2008. The GDP is expected to keep shrinking in 2009. Eurostat also reported at this time that Austria, Belgium, and Romania had all entered recession in the first quarter of 2009, with two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP, while Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Portugal had already done so in the last quarter of 2008 and Hungary in the quarter before that.\n*May 19, 2009:  Norway\nNorway's mainland GDP, which excludes the oil and gas sectors and the shipping industry, shrank 1.0% in the three months to March after a 0.8% decline in the final quarter of 2008, with recession counted as two consecutive quarterly figures showing a contraction. Mainland GDP is considered a better indicator of the Scandinavian country's economic health, since the oil and gas sector represents 25% of its economic growth but employs only about one% of its working-age population. Still, Norway's total GDP, which includes the oil, gas and shipping sectors, shrank 0.4% in the first quarter of 2009 after 0.8% growth in the fourth quarter of 2008.\n*May 20, 2009:  Mexico\nMexico becomes the first Latin American country to officially enter recession, having its GDP shrink 8.22% in the first quarter of 2009, after falling 1.6% in the final quarter of 2008.

Employment gains in January were driven by women aged 25 to 54 and youths. This was the first notable increase for youths since the start of the employment downturn in the fall of 2008. There were large increases in part-time employment in January, bringing it back to the level of six months earlier. Full-time employment was little changed in January, but has trended up over the last six months. January's increase was among private sector employees, while self-employment declined. Over the last six months, the number of private and public sector employees has been rising while self-employment has been little changed. The largest employment increases in January occurred in business, building and other support services, and retail and wholesale trade. These were partially offset by losses in professional, scientific, and technical services, as well as agriculture.\n*February 22, 2010:  Taiwan\nTaiwan's economy exits from the recession with 9.22% growth in the last quarter of 2009 after increased demand from China and other key markets in the region.\n*February 24, 2010:  Eurozone\nEurope risks a double-dip recession after bad results emerged from France, Germany and Italy.

Economic growth surged an annualized 5% in the fourth quarter, providing the clearest sign yet that a broad-based recovery is taking firm hold. It was the fastest annualized quarterly growth since 2000, and the first solidly positive quarter since the economy entered recession in 2008 amid a global pullback brought on by the 2008 financial crisis. The fourth-quarter surge was fuelled by everything from a strong housing sector and healthy consumer spending to a surprise turnaround for net trade as the country's exports grew at almost double the pace of imports, according to Statistics Canada.\n*March 12, 2010:  Canada\n21,000 jobs were created in Canada as of February 2010.

Employment increased marginally in Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan.\n*April 15, 2010:  Canada\nThe union vote ratification for Stelco Lake Erie Works was confirmed with 88.5% voting in favor of the three-year deal; keeping the place open for industry.

The Canadian economy expanded at an annualized rate of 6.1% in the first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations and marking the best growth rate since 1999. Economists had expected annualized GDP growth of 5.9% in the last quarter, up from 5% in last year's fourth quarter. The growth in the first quarter is the third straight quarter of economic expansion in Canada, coming on the heels of three consecutive quarters of contraction. March growth came in at 0.6%, ahead of the 0.5% estimate.\nJune\n*June 9, 2010:  Hungary\nHungary leaves the recession after experiencing 0.9% growth in the first quarter as a result of growing exports and effective government spending measures.\n*June 9, 2010:  Finland\nFinland falls back into a state of recession after GDP contracted 0.4% in Q1 2010 and 0.2% in Q4 2009.

This is almost double the original forecast of 0.6% growth, and the news is a welcome surprise. In late August, this figure was revised up to 1.2% growth as a result of greater construction output. However, large budget cuts are being put into action by the new coalition government to tackle the £163bn budget deficit that the country faces.\nAugust\n*August 6, 2010:  Canada\nFrom April to June, Canada added a massive 225,000 jobs, over half of all of the year-over-year gains since July 2009, which has nearly brought Canada's employment to pre-recession levels. Now that growth is beginning to normalize, employment and gross domestic product growth paused in July. Canada's economy shed 9,000 jobs, pushing the employment rate up slightly to 8.0%. The 139,000 full-time jobs lost were largely offset by the 130,000 gained in part-time employment.\nSeptember\n*September 8, 2010:  Egypt\nEgypt's Minister of Finance, Dr. Youssef Butros Ghali, states that Egypt emerged from the recession as indicated by increased total revenue from sales taxes and customs revenues.\n*September 10, 2010:  Canada\nStatistics Canada said an additional 36,000 people got jobs in August, but the unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage points, to 8.1%, as a larger number of people sought work.

The growth of the fourth quarter was attributed to a strengthening global economy, along with increasing income levels in the nation and greater liquidity by financial institutions to help the private sector. Full-year growth was recorded at 7.8%.\n*February 23, 2011  Venezuela\nEconomists expressed concern with regards to Venezuela's economy improving due to instability in the private sector pressured by the socialist government, as José Guerra, former manager at the Central Bank of Venezuela, stated that private investment, accounting for half of Venezuela's GDP, dropped 2.2% in 2010.\nMarch\n*March 30, 2011:  Wales\nThe global credit information group Experian highlighted in a report that the economic recovery for Wales is slower than the rest of the UK, stating a forecasted growth of 1.6% per year over the next decade as compared to 2.2% for the rest of the United Kingdom. Issues for Wales were attributed to low export rates, an unskilled workforce and low entrepreneurism, leading to less opportunities for growth.\nMay\n*May 5, 2011:  Portugal\nPortugal's Minister of Finance Teixeira dos Santos warns that the upcoming bail-out package of €78 billion is expected to shift Portugal into recession for at least 2 years.\n* May 6, 2011:  United States\nThe US Department of Labor stated 244,000 jobs were created in April, with 235,000 added in February and 221,000 in March, but unemployment continued to grow, reaching 9%. For unemployment to be reduced to 6%, 13 million private sector jobs must be added over 3 years, meaning annual growth of 4-5% required.\n* May 13, 2011:  Portugal\nPortugal slips into double-dip recession after the economy contracted by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2011, with a 0.6% contraction in the last quarter of 2010.

Housing prices fell 3% in the first quarter of the year, seeing housing sales increase 5.1% in March.\n*June 24, 2011:  Scotland\nRecovery for Scotland from the recession is stifled by the risk of stagnation from a weak rate of recovery in exports and business investments.\nJuly\n*July 27, 2011:  United Kingdom\nAfter figures showed that the 0.5% contraction in Q4 2010 was cancelled out by a 0.5% rise in Q1 2011, growth estimates from the ONS suggest that the growth in the UK is slowing down, after figures of 0.2% GDP increase was posted. Sovereign debt in the Eurozone and EU cause the stock market to crash from a FTSE-100 high of 6100 points to just above 5000.\nSeptember\n*September 15, 2011  Canada\nThe St. Thomas Assembly plant was closed permanently after decades of providing employing to the region of St. Thomas, Ontario; resulting in the loss of roughly 1,400 good-paying jobs.\nNovember\n*November 1, 2011  Canada\nBick's is closing down its tank farm in Delhi, Ontario in November 2011.
