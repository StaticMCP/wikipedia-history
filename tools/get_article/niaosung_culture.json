      "text": "# Niaosung culture\n\nThe Niaosung culture () was an archaeological culture in the south of the island of Taiwan. It was distributed around the region of Tainan and Kaohsiung. The culture existed in the Metal Age of the island of Taiwan. Some evidence suggests the Niaosung culture is directly connected to the Siraya people, one of the Taiwanese indigenous peoples still living in the area.\nThere is a set of several archaeological sites formed the culture, such as Niaosung (蔦松遺址), Futingchin (覆頂金遺址), Hsiliao (西寮遺址) and Kanhsi (看西遺址). Some were discovered in the archaeological research excavations, and some in other works such as digging fish farms or building factories. These sites had been excavated out potteries or middens.\nSee also\n*Tahu culture\n*List of archaeological sites in Taiwan\n*Prehistory of Taiwan\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Niaosung Culture\n\n#REDIRECT Niaosung culture\n}}"
