He succeeded Nicholas Loring, who died in the role in 1763.\nAround three years into his stint in North Yarmouth, \"theological differences\" between Brooks and his congregation began to surface. Attempts were made to align their beliefs, but it proved unsuccessful, and Brooks was dismissed in March 1769. Nine months later, he was succeeded by thirty-five-year-old Province of New Hampshire native Tristram Gilman.\nBrooks returned to Medford, and purchased land on Grove Street as he moved into farming. He preached occasionally at the First Parish Church.\nPersonal life\nBrooks married Abigail Brown on September 23, 1764, two months into his ministerial role in North Yarmouth.\nA Son of Liberty, Peter Chardon Brooks documented his father's exploits during the American Revolutionary War: He went to Lexington \"on horseback, with his gun on his shoulder and in his full-bottomed wig.\"\nBrooks also served as a chaplain in the Continental Navy, including aboard the Hancock. The Hancock was captured by the Royal Navy in 1777, and Brooks was taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a prisoner of war. There, he contracted smallpox. He was released as part of an exchange, and returned home to Medford, albeit in poor health.\nDeath\nBrooks died on May 6, 1781, aged 47. He is interred in Oak Grove Cemetery in Medford, alongside his wife, who survived him by nineteen years.\nReferences"
