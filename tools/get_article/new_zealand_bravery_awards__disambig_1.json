In some circumstances, the awards can be awarded to military personnel.\nBackground\nSince the end of WWII there have been constant moves towards an independent New Zealand honours system. This has resulted in a new system of New Zealand honours, military gallantry and civil bravery awards, and campaign medals.\nThe New Zealand Bravery Awards are designed to recognise the actions of those persons who save or attempt to save the life of another person and in the course of which they place their own safety or life at risk. The awards are primarily for civilians but may be awarded to defence force staff for acts for which gallantry or other awards are not appropriate. The level of an award is generally determined by the nature of the incident that has resulted in an act of bravery, the degree of risk to the life of the person performing the act and their personal skills or qualifications relevant to the incident, and whether the actions were taken with disregard for their own safety.\nThe bravery awards were instituted by a royal warrant on 20 September 1999.\nDesign of awards\nThe New Zealand Cross is similar in design to the original New Zealand Cross instituted by the Government in 1869 for award for acts of bravery during the New Zealand Wars of the nineteenth century. The design has been amended by including gold New Zealand fern fronds (replacing gold laurel leaves). It also uses the current royal crown—St Edward's Crown—replacing a Victorian crown. The cross is made of silver and gold. The original New Zealand Cross was instituted by an Order in Council, and later sanctioned by Queen Victoria, in 1869. It was for acts of bravery during the New Zealand Land (1860–1872). In 1895, it was proposed that the New Zealand Cross should be extended to cover acts of bravery by civilians, but this did not eventuate.\nThe New Zealand Bravery Star is a silver eight-pointed star (with four long and four short points). The design is the reverse of the shape of the New Zealand Cross. The New Zealand Bravery Decoration is a silver cross of similar shape to the New Zealand Cross. The New Zealand Bravery Medal is a bronze medal bearing on the obverse (front) the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II.\nAll awards bear the inscription \"For bravery – \" on the reverse.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
