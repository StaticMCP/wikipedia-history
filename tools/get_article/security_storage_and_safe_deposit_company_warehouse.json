It is a large concrete structure with four levels of storage, and was built in 1916.  It is a rare survivor in an area that once had many warehouses, and is distinctive for its subdued decorations, which differentiate it from otherwise nondescript brick or concrete warehouses.\nThe warehouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Norfolk, Virginia\nReferences"
