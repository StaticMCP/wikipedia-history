The tour was named after the song \"99 Revolutions\" from ¡Tré!.\nBefore the announcement of the trilogy, the band had been playing \"secret shows\", revealing previously unheard songs. The first of these shows was on August 11 at the Tiki Bar  in Costa Mesa, California. After the announcement of the trilogy, the band began performing promotional shows leading up to the tour which kicked off on March 10, 2013, at Pomona, California's Pomona Fox Theater. In 2014 following the 99 Revolutions Tour, Green Day headlined the Soundwave Festival Tour 2014 in Australia.\nThe tour was the first time Green Day had ever performed their 1994 album Dookie in its entirety. This was done for five shows towards the end of the tour to celebrate the album's 20th anniversary. This tour is also notable for having the band's first major live shows since its release not to end the show with a performance of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\". Rather substituting it for \"Brutal Love\", the opening rock ballad track that is also featured on ¡Tré!.\nOpening acts\n*All Time Low (Europe) (select dates)\n*Kaiser Chiefs (London, Oslo)\n*Stickup Kid (US) (SXSW)\n*Best Coast (US, Canada)\n*Hladno Pivo, Superhiks, Atheist Rap (Serbia)\n*The Baseballs (Austria)\n*Twin Atlantic (Montreux)\n* Classic Hugo and the Dirty Dick Beaters (El Paso, Trieste, and Locarno only)\n* Billy Talent (Tallinn)\n* Volbeat (Nîmes)\n* Black Rebel Motorcycle Club (Nîmes)\n* The Stitches (Pomona and Tempe)\n* Frank Turner (London)\n* The Bastard Sons of Dioniso (Milan)\nSetlist\n# \"99 Revolutions\"\n# \"Know Your Enemy\"\n# \"Stay the Night\"\n# \"Stop When the Red Lights Flash\"\n# \"Letterbomb\"\n# \"Oh Love\"\n# \"Holiday\"\n# \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\"\n# \"Stray Heart\"\n# \"Burnout\"\n# \"When I Come Around\"\n# \"Waiting\"\n# \"Hitchin' a Ride\"\n# \"Going to Pasalacqua\"\n# \"Brain Stew\"\n# \"Welcome to Paradise\"\n# \"Longview\"\n# \"St. Jimmy\"\n# \"Basket Case\"\n# \"She\"\n# \"King for a Day\"\n# \"X-Kid\"\n# \"Minority\"\n;Encore:\n#\"American Idiot\"\n# \"Jesus of Suburbia\"\n# \"Brutal Love\"\nTour dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of 2013 concerts\n!
