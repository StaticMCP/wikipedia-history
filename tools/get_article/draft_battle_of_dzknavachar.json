The battle took place in the province of Nig, near a place called Dzknavachar, in present-day Armenia.\nBackground\nAfter the secession of Vaspurakan, the emir of Azerbaijan, Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, acting on behalf of the Abbasid Caliph, was granted the authority to collect taxes from Armenia. This provided a pretext for interfering in Armenian internal affairs. Yusuf demanded that Armenian king Smbat I pay tribute, and when negotiations led by Catholicos John V the Historian failed—culminating in his imprisonment—Yusuf prepared for war.\nYusuf was supported by the Artsruni princes of Vaspurakan, most notably King Gagik I Artsruni and his brother Gurgen Artsruni, both of whom supplied troops to the campaign.\nThe Battle\nKing Smbat entrusted command of his forces to his sons, Ashot II the Iron and Mushegh I Bagratuni. The Armenian forces met the Arab-Vaspurakan coalition at Dzknavachar. Although the Armenians launched a preemptive strike and showed early success on the battlefield, the tide turned after the defection of the Sevorik (Uti) detachment, which fled mid-battle.\nDespite the personal bravery of Ashot and Mushegh—who reportedly caused confusion in enemy ranks—the Armenian army was defeated. Mushegh was captured, and the defeat left Armenia vulnerable to further invasions.\nAftermath\nFollowing the battle, Yusuf’s forces spread throughout Armenian territories, killing key nobles including Grigor Supan of Syunik, Prince Smbat (son of Sahak, brother of King Smbat I), and eventually Prince Mushegh. Fear and destruction gripped the countryside, and the population fled to remote mountain areas.\nKing Smbat himself was besieged in the fortress of Kaput, which fell after prolonged resistance. In 914, Smbat was captured, executed, and his body was displayed at the gates of Dvin.\nThe defeat at Dzknavachar marked a turning point in the Arab campaigns against Armenia, severely weakening Bagratid authority in the region and emboldening Yusuf’s reign of terror.\nSee also\n* Ashot II of Armenia\nReferences\nSources\n* Leo, *History of Armenia*, vol. 2.
