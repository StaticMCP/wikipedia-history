His philanthropic works, administrative abilities and management of his estate (Raj Darbhanga) were highly appreciated and led to development of his estate.\nBiography\nLakshmeshwar Singh was the eldest son of Maharaja Maheshwar Singh of Darbhanga, who died when Lakshmeshwar was aged two. The British Raj placed the estate of Darbhanga under the control of the Court of Wards because the heirs to the estate were minors. One of his tutors was a Scottish-Englishman, Chester Macnaghten until his majority, then became the founding principle of the Rajkumar College, Rajkot.\n>>> Impact of the following para on the Darbhanga Princely order especially the young prince Lakshmeshwar educated under western system of education as the norm of the British to impart Western aspects and the mother and family at large wanting to also Brahmin cultural education may also have educated the tutor with training of Princely Orders which was manifested in training some 170 tutors at the first public school in British India at the Rajkumar College Rajkot>>>>> of the  and also the   Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh Bahadur (ruled 1860 to 1898) (born 25 September 1858, died 17 December 1898). He was a philanthropist. His statue (by Edward Onslow Ford) was installed in Calcutta in 1904 at Dalhousie Square as a tribute to him. Lakshmeshwar Singh was only two years old his father's death, so Raj Darbhanga was placed under Ward of Court. He was the first Maharaja of Darbhanga to receive a western education, from a British tutor, Chester Mcnaughton (who was later the founding principal of the Rajkumar College, Rajkot), and took over the reins of Raj Darbhanga on 25 September 1879 after attaining his majority. He devoted himself to public works and was recognized as one of the greatest nobles and philanthropists of India at that time. On 22 June 1897, he was advanced to the rank of Knight Grand Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire.[10][11] -->\nFor the next 19 years, until he attained majority, he was caught in political one-upmanship between his mother, who was supported by family priests, and the Tutors appointed by the British Government, who wanted him to be free from Zenana influence. He along with his younger brother Rameshwar Singh (who became Maharaja of Darbhanga after Lakshmeshwar Singh's death) received a western education from Government appointed tutors as well as a traditional Indian education from a Sanskrit Pandit, one of his uncles, a Maulvi and a Bengali gentleman. During the period when Lakshmeshwar Singh was under the guardianship of the Court of Wards, he received a monthly allowance of Rs. 5 a month even though the annual income of his estate was equivalent to a six-digit figure in pounds sterling.\nOn attaining his majority, Lakshmeshwar Singh devoted himself entirely to public duties of his position. He was appointed and served as a Member of the Legislative Council of the Viceroy. He was also one of nine members of the Royal Commission on Opium of 1895, formed by the British Government. Haridas Viharidas Desai, the Diwan of Junagadh, was the only other Indian member.\nIn 1875, Tirhut Railway was one such privately-owned train service which was introduced by Maharaja Lakshmeshwar Singh of Darbhanga way back in 1874 to serve the drought-hit general public in North Bihar. It is also known as the first private train of the country.  Railway Line opened in Darbhanga between Mokama and Darbhanga by Local King Lakshmeshwar Singh of Raj Darbhanga through Tirhut Railway.\nLakshmeshwar Singh championed freedom of speech, personal and political rights. In 1898, he and W. C. Banerjee, were the only prominent Indians to publicly criticise and fight against the proposed widening of scope of section 124-A and 153-A of the Indian Penal Code that was meant to suppress freedom of press in reporting news that could be deemed seditious in nature or against Government policy and insertion of section 108 in Indian Penal Code that gave right to postal authorities to seize any material that was suspected of containing matter obnoxious to section 124-A and 153-A of Indian Penal Code.\nLakshmeshwar Singh died on 17 December 1898. He did not have any children and thus his younger brother, Rameshwar Singh, succeeded him as Maharaja.\nPublic charity\nHe built an Anglo-vernacular school at a cost of £1490, which he maintained, as well as nearly thirty vernacular schools of different grades; and subsidised a much larger number of educational institutions.\nThe Maharaja was also one of the founders of Indian National Congress as well as one of the main financial contributor thereto.\nOther information\nOn the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of Great Queen Victoria, Lakshmeshwar Singh was created a Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, being promoted to Knight Grand Commander in 1887.\nThe British Governor commissioned Edward Onslow Ford to make a statue of Lakshmeshwar Singh. This is installed at Dalhousie Square in Kolkata.\nReferences"
