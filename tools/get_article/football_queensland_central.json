      "text": "# Football Queensland Central\n\nFootball Queensland Central Coast is the regional office of Football Queensland servicing the areas between Gladstone, Rockhampton and Longreach. The FQ Central Coast regional office has a local administrator and committee members which are elected by clubs to meet quarterly to discuss functional and geographical matters.\nHistory\nFootball Queensland Central Coast was established in 2021 as part of Football Queensland's Future of Football 2020+ Reforms. As part of the reform process, a six-month state-wide consultation with the local football community took place with the aim of improving four key areas of the game: Governance, Administration, Competitions, and Affordability. Following the consultation, FQ Central Coast was created to better reflect the geography and strategic direction of the region.\nAs part of this change, the Central Queensland Premier League was replaced by the FQPL Central Coast men's and women's competitions from the 2022 season.\nClubs and competitions\nThe premier competitions in the region are the FQPL 3 Central Coast Men's and FQPL Central Coast Women's, both of which form part of the Central Conference in the Football Queensland pyramid.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+FQPL 3 Central Coast\n!Club\n!Home Ground\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|Berserker Bears FC\n|Norbridge Park\n|Rockhampton\n|Was CQU Berserker FC until 2022\n|-\n|Capricorn Coast FC\n|Apex Park\n|Yeppoon\n|\n|-\n|Central FC\n|Brian Niven Park\n|Gladstone\n|\n|-\n|Clinton FC\n|Clinton Field\n|Gladstone\n|\n|-\n|Frenchville FC\n|Ryan Park\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|-\n|Nerimbera FC\n|Pilbeam Park\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|-\n|Rockhampton Bluebirds United\n|Webber Park\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|-\n|Southside United Sports Club\n|Jardine Park\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|}\nAccurate for 2024 season as of 26 August 2024\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Central Coast Division 1 North\n!Club\n!Home Ground\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|Berserker Bears FC\n|Norbridge Pak\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|-\n|Capricorn Coast FC Black\n|Apex Park\n|Yeppoon\n|\n|-\n|Capricorn Coast FC Orange\n|Apex Park\n|Yeppoon\n|\n|-\n|Frenchville FC Green\n|Ryan Park\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|-\n|Frenchville FC White\n|Ryan Park\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|-\n|Nerimbera FC\n|Pilbeam Park\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|-\n|Parkana\n|Parkana Field\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|-\n|Southside United Sports Club\n|Jardine Park\n|Rockhampton\n|\n|}\nAccurate for 2023 season\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Central Coast Division 1 South\n!Club\n!Home Ground\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|Biloela Valleys\n|\n|Biloela\n|\n|-\n|BITS FC\n|\n|Gladstone\n|\n|-\n|Calliope\n|\n|Gladstone\n|\n|-\n|Central FC\n|Brian Niven Park\n|Gladstone\n|\n|-\n|Clinton FC\n|Clinton Field\n|Gladstone\n|\n|-\n|Yaralla\n|Yaralla Sports Club Football Pitch\n|Gladstone\n|\n|}\nBold - denotes first-grade teamAccurate for 2023 season\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Other Clubs\n!Club\n!Home Ground\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|Boyne Tannum FC\n|\n|Gladstone\n|\n|-\n|Berserker Southside\n|Jardine Park\n|Rockhampton\n|Combined team of Berserker and Southside United (2019, 2020).
