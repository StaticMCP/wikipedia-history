Expedition 23 began with the Soyuz TMA-16 undocking on 18 March 2010. Shortly thereafter cosmonauts Aleksandr Skvortsov and Mikhail Korniyenko and astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson arrived at the Space Station on Soyuz TMA-18 on 4 April 2010. The Soyuz spacecraft lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 00:04 EST on 2 April 2010.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!First part(March 2010 to April 2010)\n!Second part(April 2010 to June 2010)\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=2 align=center| Oleg Kotov, RSASecond spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 1\n|colspan=2 align=center| Soichi Noguchi, JAXASecond spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 2\n|colspan=2 align=center| Timothy Creamer, NASAOnly spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 3\n|\n|colspan=1 align=center| Aleksandr Skvortsov, RSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 4\n|\n|colspan=1 align=center| Mikhail Korniyenko, RSAFirst spaceflight\n|-\n!Flight Engineer 5\n|\n|colspan=1 align=center| Tracy Caldwell Dyson, NASASecond spaceflight\n|-\n|}\n;Source: NASA\nBackup crew\n*Douglas H.
