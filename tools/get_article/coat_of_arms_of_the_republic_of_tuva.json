In the center of the field is a traditional horseman, symbolizing Tuva's sovereignty and spirit.  The coat of arms was created in 1992, and is similar to the present state emblem of Mongolia, which was adopted that same year.\nMeaning of the colors\nThe yellow symbolizes gold and Tibetan Buddhism.  Blue symbolizes the morals of nomadic herdsmen (who are commonly respected in the region), as well the Tuvan sky.  The blue pall symbolizes the confluence of the Bii-Khem (Bolshoy Yenisei) and Kaa-Khem (Maly Yenisei) rivers at the Tuvan capital of Qızıl, where they form the Yenisey River, known to locals as the Ulug-Khem River. White symbolizes silver and virtue; additionally, it is common in Tuva for hostesses to greet guests with silver streamers in their arms.\nHistory\nFirst version\nBy decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of October 9, 1961, the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast was transformed into the Tuva Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was confirmed by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of October 10, 1961 and approved by the USSR Law of December 8, 1961\nOn January 10, 1962, at the first session of the first convocation of the Supreme Soviet of the Tuva ASSR, the Supreme Soviet of the Tuva ASSR adopted the Decree of the Tuva ASSR \"On the State Emblem, State Flag and the Capital of the Tuva Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\".Article\nIn the design of the emblem. the inscription \"ТУВИНСКАЯ АССР\" was quoted in Russian completely and was located under the inscription \"ТЫВА АССР\".\nSecond version\nOn November 10, 1978, at the extraordinary eighth session of the Supreme Soviet of the fourth convocation of the Tuva ASSR, the Supreme Soviet approved the first Constitution of the Tuva ASSR.
