It is dedicated to the Carniolan priest, poet and journalist Valentin Vodnik (1758−1819), a major figure in the Slovene National Awakening.\nThe monument was proposed by the politician Lovro Toman on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the poet's birth; the effort to erect it was organised by the Writers' Support Society in collaboration with the Slovene Society. The bronze statue was cast in bronze by the young sculptor  (1859−1935) between 1887 to 1889 in Vienna, and was unveiled atop a simple stone pedestal on 30 June 1889 with a three-day celebration as the first public Slovene national monument. The pedestal has the bronze inscription reading VODNIK. on its obverse; the reverse is inscribed with the final verse of Vodnik's 1806 poem Moj spomenik (\"My Monument\"):\n...meaning:\nVodnik had been an ardent supporter of the Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces, which he saw as fostering Slovene ethnic and linguistic consciousness; one of his longest poems was a classicizing ode to Napoleon. To commemorate the 120th anniversary of the establishment of the Provinces, France donated a bronze decoration for the pedestal in 1929; this comprises the letters RF (for République Française) flanking a fasces surmounted with a hand with two fingers extended in a blessing (a reference to Vodnik's clerical vocation), all enclosed in a laurel wreath, over a scroll with the inscription \"A Vodnik\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
