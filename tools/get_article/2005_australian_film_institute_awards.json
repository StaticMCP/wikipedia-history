Presented by the Australian Film Institute (AFI), the awards celebrated the best in Australian feature film, television, documentary and short film productions of 2005. The two events were held in Melbourne, Victoria, with the former presentation at the Waterfront City Pavilion, and the latter at the Melbourne Central City Studios, on 25 November and 26 November 2005, respectively. The AFI Awards Ceremony was televised on the Nine Network, with actor Russell Crowe hosting both this and the AFI Craft Awards.\nLook Both Ways received the most feature film awards with five, including Best Film and Best Direction. Little Fish and The Proposition collected four awards each. The only other winner was Three Dollars with the award for Best Adapted Screenplay. In the television categories, Love My Way won five awards, including Best Drama Series, Best Direction and Best Screenplay. MDA was given two awards. Other television winners were ''Holly's Heroes, John Safran vs God, The Glass House and The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant'', with one award apiece.\nCeremony\nAfter poor viewership of the 2004 Awards ceremony, the AFI hired live entertainment promoter Paul Dainty to revamp the event. This included splitting the awards into two separate events: The AFI Craft Awards and the AFI Awards Ceremony, which were held on the 25 November and 26 November, respectively. The Craft Awards were presented for technical achievements in feature films, television and non-feature films. The chief executive of the AFI said the reason behind the split was to give \"craft nominees more respect, with their own black-tie event.\" The decision, however, was met with some criticism from industry members, who felt that they were being undermined and overshadowed by the other non-technical categories. Australian Screen Editors said the \"split undermines the uniquely collaborative nature of filmmaking and sent the wrong message for the next generation of filmmakers.\" Guests were entertained at the Craft Awards with performances by Nick Cave and Russell Crowe. Special guest presenters included Geoffrey Rush, Simon Baker, Catherine Martin, Martin Henderson, Christiane Kubrick, Steve Bisley and Paul Grabowsky.\nAustralian actor Russell Crowe was chosen to host the AFI Craft Awards and the AFI Awards Ceremony. Awards at both presentations were handed out on the 25 November and 26 November, respectively. The latter event received a delayed broadcast on Nine Network at 10:55pm, and a five-minute segment dedicated to the Craft Awards was shown. The ceremony drew in an audience of 900,000 viewers. Crowe's work as host, and the AFI's decision to hire Dainty to produce the event was well received by critics. The Age felt Dainty's involvement in the production of the ceremony \"was pivotal to the awards' renaissance\", adding that splitting the awards \"put an end to the drawn-out ceremonies of years past.\" Michaela Boland from Variety praised Crowe for his \"charming [and] funny\" performance hosting the show. Presenters at the Awards Dinner included Geoffrey Rush, Rachel Griffiths, Baz Luhrmann, Melissa George, Richard Roxburgh, Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Claudia Karvan, Saskia Burmeister, Sigrid Thornton, Martin Henderson, Vince Colosimo, Susie Porter, Pia Miranda, Alex Dimitriades and Mick Molloy.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominations were announced by Australian actors Claudia Karvan and Alex Dimitriades on 21 October 2005 at the Wharf Restaurant in Sydney, New South Wales. Leading the feature film nominees was Little Fish with thirteen. Love My Way gained the most television nominations with six.\nFeature Film\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Film\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Direction\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Look Both Ways – Bridget Ikin\n**Little Fish – Vincent Sheehan, Liz Watts and Richard Keddie\n**Oyster Farmer – Anthony Buckley and Piers Tempest\n**The Proposition – Chris Brown, Jackie O'Sullivan, Chiara Menage and Cat Villiers\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Sarah Watt – Look Both Ways\n**Rowan Woods – Little Fish\n**John Hillcoat – The Proposition\n**Greg McLean – Wolf Creek\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Original Screenplay\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Adapted Screenplay\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Look Both Ways – Sarah Watt\n**Little Fish – Jacquelin Perske\n**The Proposition – Nick Cave\n**Wolf Creek – Greg McLean\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Three Dollars – Robert Connolly and Elliot Perlman\n**Hating Alison Ashley – Christine Madafferi\n**The Illustrated Family Doctor – Kriv Stenders and David Snell\n**The Widower – Lyndon Terracini\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Lead Actor\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Lead Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Hugo Weaving – Little Fish as Lionel Dawson\n**William McInnes – Look Both Ways as Nick\n**Guy Pearce – The Proposition as Charlie Burns\n**Ray Winstone – The Proposition as Captain Morris Stanley\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Cate Blanchett – Little Fish as Tracy Louise Heart\n**Saskia Burmeister – Hating Alison Ashley as Erica Yurken\n**Justine Clarke – Look Both Ways as Meryl Lee\n**Frances O'Connor – Three Dollars as Tanya Harnovey\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Supporting Actor\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Supporting Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Anthony Hayes – Look Both Ways as Andy Walker\n**Martin Henderson – Little Fish as Ray Robert Heart\n**John Hurt – The Proposition as Jellon Lamb\n**Robert Menzies – Three Dollars as Nick\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Noni Hazlehurst – Little Fish as Janelle Margaret Heart\n**Tracy Mann – Hating Alison Ashley as Mum\n**Daniela Farinacci – Look Both Ways as Julia\n**Kestie Morassi – Wolf Creek as Kristy Earl\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Cinematography\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Editing\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*The Proposition – Benoît Delhomme\n**Little Fish – Danny Ruhlmann\n**Oyster Farmer – Alun Bollinger\n**Wolf Creek – Will Gibson\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Little Fish – Alexandre de Franceschi and John Scott\n**Look Both Ways – Denise Haratzis\n**The Proposition – Jon Gregory\n**Wolf Creek – Jason Ballantine\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Original Music Score\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Sound\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*The Proposition – Nick Cave and Warren Ellis\n**Little Fish – Nathan Larson\n**Three Dollars – Alan John\n**Wolf Creek – François Tétaz\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*Little Fish – Sam Petty and Peter Grace\n**Look Both Ways – Andrew Plain, Peter Smith and Toivo Lember\n**The Proposition – Tim Alban, Paul Davies and Craig Walmsley\n**Wolf Creek – Des Kenneally, Peter Smith, Pete Best and Tom Heuzenroeder\n|-\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Production Design\n! style=\"background:#DBD090;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Costume Design\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*The Proposition – Chris Kennedy\n**Little Fish – Luigi Pittorino\n**Look Both Ways – Rita Zanchetta\n**Three Dollars – Luigi Pittorino\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*The Proposition – Margot Wilson\n**Hating Alison Ashley – Paul Warren\n**Little Fish – Melinda Doring\n**Look Both Ways – Edie Kurzer\n|}\nTelevision\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! ! style=\"background:#dbd090; width=;\"50%\"| Best Drama Series\n! ! style=\"background:#dbd090; width=;\"50%\"| Best Comedy Series\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Love My Way (Foxtel) – John Edwards and Claudia Karvan'\n**All Saints, Series 8 (Seven Network) – MaryAnne Carroll\n**Blue Heelers, Series 12 (Seven Network) – Gus Howard and David Clarke\n**MDA, Series 3 (ABC) – Denny Lawrence\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'John Safran vs God (SBS) – Selin Yaman and John Safran'\n**Comedy Inc.
