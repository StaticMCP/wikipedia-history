Mahara was initially developed by Catalyst IT Limited, a New Zealand open-source software company, and first released in April 2008. Development of Mahara has since expanded to include a community of contributors, including the New Zealand Ministry of Education.\nThe software was designed to be an open-source electronic portfolio platform to support the student learning and personal learning environment goals of educational institutions. Mahara allows students to select their own work and prepare an online portfolio, to both share in a university classroom context and show to future employers.\nLanguage support\nMahara supports translation into different languages using language packs, and contributions of complete or near-complete coverage have been provided for Japanese, Basque, French, Māori, Slovenian, German, Czech, and Danish languages.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
