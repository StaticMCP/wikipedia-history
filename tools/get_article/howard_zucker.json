Zucker (born 6 September 1959) is a U.S. physician and lawyer.\nEducation\nZucker was born in the Bronx in 1959.  He received a BS from McGill University. While at McGill, he helped design zero-gravity medical experiments that were later performed on several Space Shuttle missions. At the age of 22, he received his medical degree from the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences, making him at the time one of the youngest doctors in the United States. He trained in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins Hospital, anesthesiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, pediatric cardiology at Children's Hospital Boston/Harvard Medical School, and pediatric critical care medicine and anesthesiology at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\nCareer\nDuring the presidency of George W. Bush, Zucker was a White House Fellow and later Deputy Assistant Secretary of Health in the Department of Health and Human Services under Tommy Thompson. During that time, he worked on public health preparedness, regenerative medicine, the anthrax crisis, and preventive public health strategies. He also developed the Medical Reserve Corps. Afterward he served as the assistant Director-General of the World Health Organization.\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Zucker served as the First Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health. From 2014 to 2015, he served as Acting Commissioner after the abrupt resignation of Nirav Shah. From 2015 to 2021, he served as the 16th commissioner of the New York State Department of Health. He was appointed to the position by Governor Andrew Cuomo. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he appeared frequently in media as the ultimate expert on the status of the pandemic in the State of New York. In January 2021, the New York Attorney General’s office released a report showing that the New York Department of Health under-counted statewide nursing home deaths by as much as 50%. Both Governor Cuomo and Zucker were blamed for the under-count.\nFrom 2023 to 2024, Zucker served as the Deputy Director for Global Health at the CDC.\nPublications\n* Howard Zucker, M.D., \"Where Have All the Doctors Gone?
