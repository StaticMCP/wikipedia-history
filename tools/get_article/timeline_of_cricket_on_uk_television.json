This is the earliest known live television broadcast of women's Test cricket.\n**7 September – The BBC shows live coverage of the final of the first Gillette Cup final.\n* 1965\n** 2 May – Sunday Cricket is broadcast for the first time. The programme, which runs throughout the afternoon on BBC2, features full coverage of a match \"played under knock-out rules\".\n* 1968\n** 29 and 30 July - ITV shows test cricket for the only time, and only part-networked, when the last two days of the Headingley Test against Australia coincide with the launch of Yorkshire Television.  The morning session is the first thing shown on Thames Television, ahead its official opening later that day.\n** 7 September - The new ITV company London Weekend Television wins the rights to show the Gillette Cup final between Warwickshire and Sussex.  This coverage is only partially networked, with other regions cutting off their coverage earlier, but coverage of the finish - shown principally in the London and Southern areas - is faded out with six minutes to go to make way for advertising and then David Frost's programme.  Subsequently, there is only very occasional networked or even part-networked cricket coverage on ITV, although occasional regional coverage continues into the 1990s.\n* 1969\n** 27 April – Sunday Cricket begins broadcasting a match each week from the new Sunday League.\n* 1972\n** A new one-day competition, the Benson & Hedges Cup, begins and the BBC provides live coverage of a match from each round.\n* 1975\n** 7–21 June – The BBC shows extensive live coverage of the first Cricket World Cup. The BBC also shows full live coverage of the 1979 and 1983 tournaments.\n1980s\n* 1980\n** 31 August – Sunday Cricket is broadcast for the final time, and consequently this is the last time that the featured Sunday league game is broadcast in full.\n* 1981\n** 17 May – Sunday Grandstand launches. The programme includes weekly coverage of the Sunday League but coverage is now reduced as it has to share with other sporting events taking place that afternoon.\n*1982\n**No events.\n* 1983\n** 6 January – The Channel 9 broadcast of the fifth cricket Test from Sydney is shown on the BBC. This is the first time cricket from abroad is shown live in England.\n*1984\n**The BBC starts showing live midweek one-day cup cricket to its conclusion. Previously live coverage had ended at around 5pm so that the BBC's teatime broadcasting of Open University matches was not displaced. Television viewers had previously been made to wait until the late-evening highlights programme to find out the result of the match.\n*1985\n**No events.\n* 1986\n** November–January 1987 – The BBC shows occasional live coverage of the English cricket team in Australia in 1986–87 although the vast majority of its coverage is in highlights form.
