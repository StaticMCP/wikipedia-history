Therefore, after many warnings and warnings, the Russian authorities, on the initiative of General   and according to his plan, decided to move further deep into Central Asia in the fall, and planning to annex to Russia the region located between the then Russian and Bukhara-Kokand possessions; this area of the land was the last stronghold for the Emir of Bukhara to the side of our possessions, fortified by two fortresses - Ura-Tube and Jizak. On 2 October, during the bloody assault, the Russians took Ur-Tuba. After General Romanovsky captured the fortress of Ura-Tube, only one point remained in the hands of the Emir of Bukhara by the fall of 1866 in the valley of the Syrdarya Djizak River.\nThe Battle\nThe Djizak fortress was heavily fortified and armed, and therefore was considered the most serious fortress in those parts. The Djizak bey, who received reinforcements from ten thousand selected troops from the Bukhara emir at the end of the summer, with 53 large-caliber guns, prepared to give a brutal rebuff.\nOn 6 October, a column was sent on the way to the small fortress of Zaamin, located halfway from Ura-Tube. Bukhara troops fled and the fortress was taken without a fight. On 10 October, the rest of the Russian units approached Jizak. Russian troops consisting of 16.5 companies, five hundred Cossacks with 20 guns approached the fortress on 12 October. On 13 October, General Romanovsky conducted reconnaissance, and then siege work began. On 14 October, 2.5-3 thousand Bukhara cavalry advanced to the Jalan-Uta gorge, against the guard detachment left there. Two rifle companies and Cossacks sent to the gorge overturned and threw back the attackers. At the same time, the Bukharians from the fortress made a strong sortie against three companies occupying the sakli in front of the fortress walls, but were repulsed. By this time it turned out that the emir had sent strong reinforcements from Samarkand to Jizak, as a result of which it was decided to accelerate the operations and seize the fortress by storm. On 15 October, the arming of two batteries (10 guns and 4 mortars) built against the Ur-Tyubin and Samarkand gates began. The garrison made two sorties, but without success, and on the morning of the 16th the batteries opened fire. On 17–18 October, the Russians conducted artillery shelling of the fortress.\nOn 18 October, at 12 o'clock, the general assault on the fortress began. The Bukharans, who were waiting for the assault at dawn, decided that it was postponed to the next day, and were not ready for the attack. Columns of Captain Mikhailovsky and Lieutenant Colonel Grigoriev (a total of 8 infantry companies, with 10 guns and 4 mortars) went on the offensive. The enemy, who did not expect an attack, did not have time to meet them with fire in time and rushed to defend the collapses, but such resistance could not be long. The good \"hurray\" soon forced the defenders to retreat, and then go into a desperate, disorderly escape, which ended in no more than half an hour with the complete defeat of the entire garrison. The stormers, having mastered the breach, divided into several columns, headed partly along the walls, partly to the citadel. Following the advanced columns, parts of the reserves also entered. The Bukharians fled, having lost about 6,000 people killed. 16 banners, 12 copper and 41 cast iron guns were taken from the fortress. Of the 18 beks, 16 died, and 12 of them died in hand-to-hand combat.\nBy four o'clock in the afternoon, General Kryzhanovsky entered the fortress with the main reserve. The victory was complete. A fresh column of 2,500 people with 18 guns, which appeared five versts away, newly sent by the emir from Bukhara, sensing the fire directed at it, and learning about the fate of Jizak, ran away, escaping from the reserves that were on it.\nThe Russians took over 3,000 prisoners, many banners, guns, pikes, and pistols.\nConsequences\nGeneral Romanovsky's campaign of 1866 was crushing. On 8 May, he defeated the Bukhara troops at Irjar, on the 24th he captured Khojent, on 20 July he took Ura-Tube with an attack, and on 18 October he conquered Jizak with a sudden and cruel assault. In these three merciless assaults, the Russian troops, having lost 500 people, put 12,000 Asians in their place. Near Irjar, 1,000 Bukharians were killed and 6 guns were taken. During the assault of Khogent, 3,500 were killed. Russian losses - 137 people. At Ura-Tuba, 2,000 were broken, 4 banners, 32 guns were taken, Russian losses were 227 people. Finally, in the bloodiest case, under Jizak, out of 11,000 Bukhara, 6,000 fell, out of 2,000 Russians only 98 were eliminated. 11 banners and 43 guns were taken.\nHaving lost Jizak, the Bukharans fled to Samarkand and hurried to enter into peace negotiations. The whole year 1867 passed in fruitless negotiations. The Bukharans deliberately dragged them, trying to buy time and recruit a new army. For the capture of Djizak, General Kryzhanovsky was awarded the Order of St. George 3rd degree No. 511\nNotes\nReferences"
