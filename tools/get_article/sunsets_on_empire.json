It was released in 1997 and was mostly written together with Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, who co-composed six out of ten tracks on the original version, (plus one bonus track on the Japanese and remastered edition) and also produced the album. Tim Bowness, Wilson's partner in No-Man, has additional writing credits on one track. Two permanent members of Fish's line-up, keyboardist Foster Paterson, and guitarist Robin Boult co-wrote one and two tracks, respectively.\nUnfortunately, the album and tour were flops and lost Fish hundreds of thousands of pounds, which meant he had to fold his Dick Brothers label.  Roadrunner and Chocolate Frog/Snapper would subsequently reissue the album.\nTrack listing\n2015 The Remasters edition\nPersonnel\n* Fish – lead vocals (all)\n* Steven Wilson – lead guitar (1, 10), rhythm guitar (1, 8, 9), keyboards (1-6, 8-10), string arrangement (1), loops/sampler (2, 4, 5, 8)\n* Robin Boult – rhythm guitar (1-4, 6-9), 12 string guitar (1-6, 8, 10), lead guitar (5, 8), e-bow (5, 8)\n* Frank Usher – lead guitar (1, 7, 8), rhythm guitar (2-4, 7, 8)\n* Foss Patterson – Hammond organ (1,2, 7-9), piano (1, 2, 5, 9), keyboards (3, 5, 6), backing vocals (4), string arrangement (5)\n* Ewen Vernal – bass (1-9)\n* Dave Stewart – drums (1-9)\n* Chris Gaugh – cello (1, 5)\n* Brian Hale – violin (1, 5)\n* Dave Haswell – percussion (2, 5, 6)\n* Martyn Bennett – violin (6, 8)\n* Fraser Speirs (misspelled as \"Spiers\") – harmonica (6)\n* \"Doc\" – voice on telephone (8)\n* Terence Jones – French horn (9)\n* Lorna Bannon – backing vocals (1, 2, 5, 9)\n* Don Jack – backing vocals (1)\n* Chris Thomson – backing vocals (1)\n* Katherine Garrett – backing vocals (3, 6)\n* Annie McCraig – backing vocals (9)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
