After a chance encounter, he fell deeply in love with Pan Yuyan, the daughter of the chancellor Pan Renmei. At the border with the Liao Dynasty, he saved the Liao Princess Mingji twice, which initiated her obsession with him. Meanwhile, Yang Ye's 7th son helped his 3rd brother propose to the housemaid and their best friend Yang Chuchu, until finally realizing that her love was himself. Right before her wedding, Yang Chuchu was raped by Pan Yuyan's brother Pan Bao and committed suicide, and Pan Bao died in the ensuring brawl with the Yang brothers. The 3rd and 4th sons were attacked by Pan Renmei's assassins in jail and had to flee. The 3rd son finally found love with pure-hearted bandit Mao Xiaoying, while back home the 6th son's romance with childhood friend Princess Chai blossomed. Yiyun, a Liao spy, succeeded in putting the Yangs in great danger, but eventually sacrificed her own life to save the family and the 5th son whom she developed feelings for. To be with the 4th son, Pan Yuyan parted ways with her vengeful father, who had plotted with the Liao army to lure Yang Ye and the emperor to a trap. While the emperor escaped from the ambush at Golden Beach, Yang Ye and many sons died tragically one after another. Captured alive, the 4th son was presented with a choice: die a hero like his father and brothers, or become a despicable traitor and marry Princess Mingji whom he did not love - the only option if he wanted to return home and unite with family again.\nCast\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Cast\n!Role\n!Description\n|-\n|Ti Lung || Yang Ye || Song Dynasty army commander\n|-\n|Angie Chiu || She Saihua || Yang Ye's wife\n|-\n|Lin Jiangguo || Yang Yanping || Yang Ye and She Saihua's 1st son\n|-\n|Zhang Zichen || Yang Yanguang || Yang Ye and She Saihua's 2nd son\n|-\n|Yu Xiaowei || Yang Yanqing || Yang Ye and She Saihua's 3rd son\n|-\n|Alec Su || Yang Yanlang || Yang Ye and She Saihua's 4th son\n|-\n|Bao Jianfeng || Yang Yande || Yang Ye and She Saihua's 5th son\n|-\n|Jia Nailiang || Yang Yanzhao || Yang Ye and She Saihua's 6th son\n|-\n|Yan Kun || Yang Yansi || Yang Ye and She Saihua's 7th son\n|-\n|Zhu Xingqiang || Yang Hong || Yang family butler, no blood relations with the family\n|-\n|Zhang Yi || Yang Chuchu || Yang family maid, Yang Hong's daughter\n|-\n|  || || Yang Yanping's wife\n|-\n|Wu Jingqi || || Yang Yanguang's wife\n|-\n|Wang Yan || Mao Xiaoying || bandit's daughter\n|-\n|Fang Zhoubo || Zhao Guangyi || Emperor Taizong, 2nd emperor of Song Dynasty\n|-\n|Shen Fu || Zhao Defang || \"Eighth Virtuous Prince\", Emperor Taizong's nephew\n|-\n|Kou Zhenhai || Pan Renmei || Song Dynasty chancellor\n|-\n|Wang Ying || Consort Pan || Pan Renmei's elder daughter, married to Emperor Taizong\n|-\n|Zhao Qiang || Pan Bao || Pan Renmei's son\n|-\n|Che Dong || Zhang Kun || Pan Bao's lackey\n|-\n|Chae Rim || Pan Yuyan || Pan Renmei's younger daughter\n|-\n|Zhou Fang || Cui'er || Pan Yuyan's maid\n|-\n|Wang Shiwen || Prince Chai || Song Dynasty prince\n|-\n|Zhou Mujie || Chai Bufan || Prince Chai's son\n|-\n|Niu Mengmeng || Princess Chai || Prince Chai's daughter\n|-\n|Zhao Shuai || Kou Zhun || Song Dynasty minister\n|-\n|Xu Shouyin || Master Zhiguang || monk at Mount Wutai\n|-\n|Qin Chuan || Yelü Xian || Emperor Jingzong, 5th emperor of Liao Dynasty\n|-\n|Yang Chao || || Crown Prince Mingde, Emperor Jingzong's son\n|-\n|Hu Jing || Yelü Qiong'e || Princess Mingji, Emperor Jingzong's daughter\n|-\n|Jiang Hong || Liu Yiyun || Liao Dynasty spy, descendant of Northern Han rulers\n|}\nSoundtrack\nTrack list\n# Intro (引子) [1:14]\n# \"Rì Luò Jīn Shā Tān\" (日落金沙滩; \"Sunset at Golden Beach\") performed by Zhou Xiao'ou [4:21]\n# Dawn (清晨) [0:44]\n# Encounter (遇见) [2:08]\n# Competition (比武) [1:07]\n# Love Already (爱了) [4:26]\n# Chase at the Market (集市中的追逐) [1:06]\n# Letter from Him (他的来信) [1:22]\n# Paradise (天伦之乐) [2:55]\n# Return My Jade Pendant (还我玉佩) [1:34]\n# Anticipation under the Afterglow (夕阳中的期盼) [1:11]\n# Darkness is Coming (黑暗即将来临) [2:21]\n# Farewell, My Love (再见,我的爱人) [3:24]\n# Foreigner's Blade (异族的尖刀) [1:41]\n# Set Off (出征) [3:25]\n# Black Horse (黑色戏马) [1:42]\n# Futile Love (没有结果的爱情) [5:14]\n# Bone Fighting (骨战) [1:15]\n# Wasteland (荒原) [1:45]\n# \"Nǐ Kě Yǐ Bù Dǒng\" (你可以不懂; \"You Can Misunderstand\") performed by Alec Su [3:57]\n# My Blood (我的血液) [4:32]\n# \"Yǐn Yǐn Zuò Tòng\" (隐隐作痛; \"Obtuse Pain\") performed by Sun Yue [3:53]\nReferences\n*"
