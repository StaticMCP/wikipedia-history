Ninety-nine of the seats were in single-member districts using the first-past-the-post electoral system, and the constituencies of Cork City and Dublin University were two-member districts using block voting.\nThis election was the first fought after the separate organisations in the Irish Parliamentary Party re-merged after a split in 1891 between the Irish National Federation, which had opposed the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, and the Irish National League, which had supported his continued leadership. The IPP was now led by John Redmond of the smaller INL.\nIn the overall election result, the coalition of the Conservative Party, which included the Irish Unionist Alliance, and the Liberal Unionist Party, was returned and the Marquess of Salisbury continued as Prime Minister.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party || rowspan=\"2\"|Leader || colspan=\"3\"|Seats || colspan=\"3\"|Votes\n|-\n!# of Seats || Seat Change || Uncontested|| # of Votes || % of Votes || Vote Change\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Parliamentary Party\n|John Redmond\n|77\n|3\n|57\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Unionist\n|Edward James Saunderson\n|18\n|\n|10\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal Unionist\n|Joseph Chamberlain\n|3\n| 1\n|3\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Healyite Nationalist\n|Tim Healy\n|3\n|New\n|0\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal Party\n|Henry Campbell-Bannerman\n|1\n|\n|0\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Nationalist\n|\n|1\n| 1\n|0\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Unionist\n|\n|0\n|\n|0\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Liberal Unionist\n|\n|0\n|\n|0\n|\n|\n|\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"font-weight:bold; background:rgb(232,232,232);\"\n|colspan=3|Total\n|103\n|\n|70\n|\n|100%\n|\n|- style=\"background-color:#F6F6F6\"\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|Source: B.M.
