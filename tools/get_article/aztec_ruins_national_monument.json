The national monument lies on the western bank of the Animas River in Aztec, New Mexico, about  northeast of Farmington. Additional Puebloan structures can be found in Salmon Ruins and Heritage Park,  south. Archaeological evidence puts the construction of the ruins in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Puebloan-built ruins were dubbed the \"Aztec Ruins\" by 19th century American settlers who misattributed their construction to the Aztecs.\nThe site was declared \"Aztec Ruin National Monument\" on January 24, 1923. \"Ruin\" was changed to \"Ruins\" after a boundary change, on July 2, 1928. As a historical property of the National Park Service, the monument was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n(UNESCO) listed the Chaco Culture as a World Heritage Site on December 8, 1987. That listing specifically included the Aztec Ruins.\nThe monument is on the Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway, one of New Mexico's Scenic Byways.\nThe property was part of a 160-acre (65 ha) homestead owned by H.D. Abrams, who supported the preservation of the ruins. The H.D. Abrams House in Aztec is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nClimate\nThe climate of Aztec Ruins National Monument is a typical semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSk).\nextremes 1895&ndash;present)\n|Jan record high F = 69\n|Feb record high F = 78\n|Mar record high F = 86\n|Apr record high F = 89\n|May record high F = 98\n|Jun record high F = 105\n|Jul record high F = 106\n|Aug record high F = 105\n|Sep record high F = 101\n|Oct record high F = 92\n|Nov record high F = 77\n|Dec record high F = 69\n|year record high F = 106\n|Jan avg record high F = 56.3\n|Feb avg record high F = 62.7\n|Mar avg record high F = 73.3\n|Apr avg record high F = 80.7\n|May avg record high F = 89.2\n|Jun avg record high F = 96.8\n|Jul avg record high F = 99.1\n|Aug avg record high F = 95.8\n|Sep avg record high F = 90.7\n|Oct avg record high F = 81.8\n|Nov avg record high F = 68.7\n|Dec avg record high F = 57.2\n|year avg record high F = 99.5\n|Jan high F = 46.0\n|Feb high F = 52.5\n|Mar high F = 62.8\n|Apr high F = 70.6\n|May high F = 79.8\n|Jun high F = 90.3\n|Jul high F = 93.9\n|Aug high F = 91.2\n|Sep high F = 84.2\n|Oct high F = 71.7\n|Nov high F = 57.7\n|Dec high F = 46.4\n|year high F = 70.6\n|Jan mean F = 31.6\n|Feb mean F = 37.0\n|Mar mean F = 44.9\n|Apr mean F = 51.7\n|May mean F = 60.4\n|Jun mean F = 70.0\n|Jul mean F = 76.1\n|Aug mean F = 74.0\n|Sep mean F = 66.3\n|Oct mean F = 53.7\n|Nov mean F = 41.5\n|Dec mean F = 32.1\n|year mean F = 53.3\n|Jan low F = 17.1\n|Feb low F = 21.5\n|Mar low F = 27.0\n|Apr low F = 32.7\n|May low F = 41.0\n|Jun low F = 49.7\n|Jul low F = 58.2\n|Aug low F = 56.9\n|Sep low F = 48.5\n|Oct low F = 35.7\n|Nov low F = 25.3\n|Dec low F = 17.8\n|year low F = 35.9\n|Jan avg record low F = 2.8\n|Feb avg record low F = 8.1\n|Mar avg record low F = 14.1\n|Apr avg record low F = 19.9\n|May avg record low F = 29.7\n|Jun avg record low F = 38.2\n|Jul avg record low F = 48.6\n|Aug avg record low F = 49.5\n|Sep avg record low F = 35.1\n|Oct avg record low F = 21.6\n|Nov avg record low F = 11.7\n|Dec avg record low F = 3.2\n|year avg record low F = -0.8\n|Jan record low F = -26\n|Feb record low F = -27\n|Mar record low F = -3\n|Apr record low F = 2\n|May record low F = 12\n|Jun record low F = 24\n|Jul record low F = 39\n|Aug record low F = 36\n|Sep record low F = 22\n|Oct record low F = 6\n|Nov record low F = -7\n|Dec record low F = -24\n|year record low F = -27\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 0.90\n|Feb precipitation inch = 0.75\n|Mar precipitation inch = 0.77\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.69\n|May precipitation inch = 0.71\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.28\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.96\n|Aug precipitation inch = 1.32\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.13\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.94\n|Nov precipitation inch = 0.94\n|Dec precipitation inch = 0.67\n|year precipitation inch = 10.06\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 inch\n|Jan precipitation days = 5.6\n|Feb precipitation days = 5.1\n|Mar precipitation days = 4.4\n|Apr precipitation days = 3.7\n|May precipitation days = 3.8\n|Jun precipitation days = 2.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 5.1\n|Aug precipitation days = 7.0\n|Sep precipitation days = 5.7\n|Oct precipitation days = 4.7\n|Nov precipitation days = 4.2\n|Dec precipitation days = 5.1\n|year precipitation days = 56.5\n|Jan snow inch = 4.5\n|Feb snow inch = 2.3\n|Mar snow inch = 0.5\n|Apr snow inch = 0.2\n|May snow inch = 0.0\n|Jun snow inch = 0.0\n|Jul snow inch = 0.0\n|Aug snow inch = 0.0\n|Sep snow inch = 0.0\n|Oct snow inch = 0.3\n|Nov snow inch = 0.9\n|Dec snow inch = 2.2\n|year snow inch = 10.9\n|unit snow days = 0.1 inch\n|Jan snow days = 2.3\n|Feb snow days = 1.7\n|Mar snow days = 0.5\n|Apr snow days = 0.2\n|May snow days = 0.0\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.2\n|Nov snow days = 0.7\n|Dec snow days = 1.7\n|year snow days = 7.3\n|source 1= NOAA\n}}\nNotes\nGallery\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in San Juan County, New Mexico\n*List of national monuments of the United States\n*List of the oldest buildings in New Mexico\nReferences\nExternal links\n* \"The National Parks: Index 2001–2003\".
