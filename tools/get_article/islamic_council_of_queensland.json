The Council provides a number of social and religious services for Muslims in the area.\nActivities\nCommunity\nThe Islamic Council of Queensland represents more than 20,000 Muslims residing in the state of Queensland. The council also represents some 16 member organisations located in a number of cities in the state. The vast majority of mosques, mussallahs and Muslim student associations at universities are members of the organisation stretching from the Gold Coast up to Cairns.\nServices and programs\nThe ICQ provides a number welfare services and Islamic ritual services for local Muslims in Queensland including marriage celebrants and  burial services. The group has organised annual Quran competitions and other programs for youth development. The group has also organised a number of workshops and fund raising events.\nIn 2008, young members of the ICQ organised a successful public relations campaign when they participated in Blood Donation Week, donating blood to Queensland blood banks.\nAccording to the Council, the Islamic community in Queensland have suffered from a number of prejudicial incidents locally, and have felt the strain on their daily lives. The Council president has attributed some of these problems to the fact that local Australians are not familiar with the religion and culture of local Muslims. The ICQ and Queensland’s Islamic community have planned an annual \"Queensland Mosque Day\" to encourage Australian locals to learn about the Muslim faith.and encourage locals to attend the open session.\nZakaat and halal accreditation\nThe ICQ collects and distributes zakaat and provides halal accreditation.\nOrganisational structure\nExecutive committee\nThe executive committee is responsible for the governance of the Council. Members of the executive committee are selected through the AGM process and represent the variety of different ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups within the Queensland Muslim community.
