      "text": "# 2001 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 2001 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 41st in the National Football League (NFL). Despite having a 12th ranked offense, the Vikings finished 5–11 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1995. Before the end of the season, the team fired head coach Dennis Green, who had become a polarizing force among the Vikings fan base despite his successful coaching tenure with the team. Mike Tice coached the final game of 2001, a loss to the Baltimore Ravens.\nThis was the first season since 1989 that defensive tackle John Randle was not on the opening day roster.\nThe season began in tragic circumstances when offensive tackle Korey Stringer died of heatstroke in training camp.\nThe season started off with a 24–13 home loss to the Carolina Panthers (which would be the Panthers' lone win). They did not win on the road at all during this season. Some season highlights included a 35–13 win over the rival Green Bay Packers in Week 6, and a Week 10 victory over the New York Giants in which Randy Moss pulled in 10 receptions for 171 yards and three touchdowns leading to a 28–16 victory.\nThis was Cris Carter's final season in Minnesota, having played 12 seasons there, making eight consecutive Pro Bowl appearances (1993–2000), all with the Vikings. He is the team's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns. He retired at the end of the disappointing season, but would briefly return to play for the Miami Dolphins midway through next season.\nOffseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Additions !!
