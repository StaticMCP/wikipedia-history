The Republican National Committee took half of South Carolina's 47 delegates away from them because the state committee moved its Republican primary before February 5. It was held on the same day as the Nevada Republican caucuses, 2008.\nThe primary has become one of several key early state nominating contests in the process of choosing the nominee of the Republican party for the November 2008 election for President of the United States. It has historically been more important for the Republican Party than for the Democratic Party; from its inception in 1980 through the election of 2000, the winner of the Republican presidential primary has gone  on to win the nomination.  As of 2008, the primary has cemented its place as the \"First in the South\" primary for both parties.\nThis state's 24 delegates would be awarded on a  \"Winner-Takes-All\" basis.  12 Delegates for the Statewide winner and 12 delegates awarded on a District-winner basis awarding 2 delegates for each of the states then 6 Congressional districts.\nPolling\nAs of January 19, RealClearPolitics reported that the average support from polls placed McCain in the lead with 26.9%, followed by Huckabee with 25.9%, Romney with 14.7%, Thompson with 14.6%, Paul with 4.4%, and Giuliani with 3.4%.\nResults\nHuckabee was for weeks leading in the state but lost by a 14,743 vote margin.  He did manage to win Congressional districts 3, 4 and 5 in the North of the state earning him a total of 6 delegates.\nMike Huckabee giving his concession speech after the 2008 South Carolina Presidential Primary in Columbia, SC.\nJohn McCain won the statewide primary earning him 12 Delegates as well as Congressional Districts 1, 2 and 6. earning him an additional 6 delegates for a total of 18.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+100% of precincts reporting\n|-\n!
