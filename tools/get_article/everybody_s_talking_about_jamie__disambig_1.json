      "text": "# Everybody's Talking About Jamie__disambig_1\n\n'Everybody's Talking About Jamie' is a stage musical centred around a coming-of-age story, with score by Dan Gillespie Sells and book and lyrics by Tom MacRae. The musical is inspired by the 2011 British television documentary Jamie: Drag Queen at 16 directed by Jenny Popplewell. The musical follows and is based upon the true-life story of 16-year-old British schoolboy Jamie Campbell, as he overcomes prejudice and bullying to step out of the darkness and become a drag queen.\nPlot\nAct One\nMiss Hedge, a careers teacher, asks her noisy year eleven class what they want to be when they get older. One student of the class (16), Jamie New, gets teased about his homosexuality and reveals to the audience all he wants to be is a drag queen (\"And You Don't Even Know It\"). When prompted, Jamie tells the class he wants to be a performer, but Miss Hedge tells him to get real.\nAt Jamie's house, his mother Margaret and family friend Ray are preparing for his 16th birthday. When Jamie arrives home, Margaret gives him a card from his dad, with a picture of a race car. Margaret then gives Jamie his gift from her - a pair of red stilettos from Meadowhall. Jamie reveals hesitation about going outside his garden in the shoes (\"Wall in My Head\").\nThe next day at school, Jamie shows his best friend Pritti his new heels, and then he is interrupted by Dean, the school bully. He taunts Pritti for being Muslim, and Jamie for being gay. Jamie taunts Dean; embarrassed, Dean leaves. Pritti encourages Jamie to go to prom in a dress (\"Spotlight\"). Jamie then parades around the classroom in his heels (\"Spotlight (Reprise) (Star of the Show)\").\nAt his local shop for drag queen attire, Victor's Secret, Jamie befriends the owner Hugo, and learns all about Hugo's past as a drag queen (\"The Legend of Loco Chanelle (and the Blood Red Dress)\"). Hugo books Jamie's first drag show at the local nightclub, and helps Jamie choose his dress (\"The Legend of Loco Chanelle (and the Blood Red Dress) (Reprise)\").\nMeanwhile, Margaret meets with Jamie's dad, where she reveals she has been lying to Jamie about his dad, including the fact she has to write a birthday card from him each birthday. Jamie's dad tells Margaret he wants nothing to do with Jamie, claiming he is not a \"real boy\". Margaret ponders what her life would be like if she never met Jamie's dad (\"If I Met Myself Again\").\nAt school, Jamie pulls Pritti into a disabled toilet so she can help with his make-up. They are discovered by Miss Hedge, but Pritti tells her that she is doing Jamie's make-up for an art project. Miss Hedge tells Jamie that he should be proud of being an art project, and walks him around school in the make-up. Jamie, initially embarrassed by the attention, decides to be proud of himself, telling the school that he is doing a drag show at the local nightclub, Legs Eleven, that night (\"Work of Art\").\nOutside Legs Eleven, Jamie bumps into Dean, who calls him a minger. Inside the club, Margaret and Ray have been introduced to a group of drag queens: Laika Virgin, Tray Sophisticay, and Sandra Bollock. Hugo emerges, now dressed as Loco Chanelle, his drag alter-ego. Jamie runs in to tell them all he cannot go on because of what Dean said. Jamie finds the dress he admired at Victor's Secret in his dressing room, with a tag on saying \"Love Dad\" as well as a flower delivery from Jamie's dad. Loco Chanelle, with the help of the other drag queens, encourage Jamie to find his drag self, whom Jamie calls Mimi Me (“Over The Top”). As Loco announces Jamie over the sound system, Dean and his mates chant 'minger' as we see Jamie in drag. (“Out Of The Darkness”).\nAct Two\nThe next day, the school is buzzing with news of Jamie's drag debut (\"Everybody's Talking About Jamie\"). Jamie comes into school in bright blue eyeshadow and long eyelashes. Miss Hedge once again tells Jamie to \"get real\", and Dean taunts Jamie, but Jamie kisses him in retaliation, leaving Dean confused.\nAt home, Jamie shows Margaret and Ray his new prom dress, now shortened and fitted with working flashing lights. Margaret worries if this is all too much (\"Limited Edition Prom Night Special\"). The phone rings, and Jamie and Margaret are called to the school.\nJamie, Margaret and Ray go to the school to meet with Miss Hedge, who tells Jamie that there have been rumours that he will be attending prom in drag, and she will not allow it. Jamie is disappointed, and Dean seems to know all about it.\nIn Pritti's bedroom, Jamie rants to Pritti about how he is not allowed to go to prom in drag. Pritti tells Jamie to go in a dress - not in drag. Jamie says that without Mimi Me, he is ugly. Pritti reassures Jamie that he is far from ugly (\"It Means Beautiful\"). Jamie reveals that when he was eight, his dad found him in a dress and was angry. He is then confused as to why he paid for the dress and bought flowers if he is not supportive of him as a drag queen. Pritti suggests Jamie should go to his house and speak to him. Before he leaves, Jamie kisses Pritti on the cheek (\"It Means Beautiful (Reprise)\").\nAt the house of Jamie's dad, Jamie's dad reveals that he did not know about Mimi Me and calls Jamie disgusting. He tells Jamie he did not pay for the dress or flowers. Jamie figures out that it was his mother doing all of this in his dad's place (\"Ugly in This Ugly World\").\nAt home, Jamie argues with Margaret over why she has been lying over all these years. Jamie screams in Margaret's face and storms out. Margaret, left alone, sings about how she will always love Jamie no matter what (\"He's My Boy\").\nJamie wanders the streets drunk on cider. He is approached by three local boys, and is beaten up as they shout homophobic remarks about him. (\"And You Don't Even Know It (Bus Station Reprise)\"). Jamie is defended by Hugo, who urges Jamie to go home and apologise to his mum.\nJamie takes Hugo's advice and Margaret and Jamie apologise to each other (\"My Man, Your Boy\").\nAt the prom, all of the kids are very excited (\"Prom Song\"). Pritti enters, wearing makeup and a prom dress. All the girls love it, but Dean decides to bully her. She finally stands up to Dean, and then reveals Jamie, in a white prom dress. Miss Hedge comes out of the school and refuses Jamie's admission to the prom. All the kids stand outside and chant Jamie's name until Miss Hedge gives in and lets him in. Jamie waits until everyone's gone in, and then calls Dean out from off-stage. Jamie encourages Dean to be nice just for one night, to which Dean agrees, and they walk into prom hand-in-hand (\"Finale\").\nAs an encore, the cast perform \"Out of the Darkness (A Place Where We Belong)\".\nRoles and principal casts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n!Sheffield\n!West End\n!UK tour\n!Los Angeles\n!UK tour and London\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |(2017)\n!(2021)\n!(2022)\n!(2023/24)\n|-\n!Jamie New\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |John McCrea\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Layton Williams\n| align=\"center\" |Ivano Turco\n|-\n!Margaret New\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Josie Walker\n| align=\"center\" |Amy Ellen Richardson\n| align=\"center\" |Melissa Jacques\n| align=\"center\" |Rebecca McKinnis\n|-\n!Pritti Pasha\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Lucie Shorthouse\n| align=\"center\" |Sharan Phull\n| align=\"center\" |Hiba Elchikhe\n| align=\"center\" |Talia Palamathanan\n|-\n!Leigh/Ray†\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Mina Anwar\n| align=\"center\" |Sasha LatoyaShobna Gulati\n| align=\"center\" |Shobna Gulati\n| align=\"center\" |Shobna Gulati\n|-\n|-\n!Hugo Battersby / Loco Chanelle\n| align=\"center\" |Charles Dale\n| align=\"center\" |Phil Nichol\n| align=\"center\" |Shane RichieBianca Del Rio(Roy Haylock)\n| align=\"center\" |Bianca Del Rio(Roy Haylock)\n| align=\"center\" |John PartridgeKevin CliftonDarren Day\n|-\n!Miss Hedge\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Tamsin Carroll\n| align=\"center\" |Lara Denning\n| align=\"center\" |Gillian Ford\n| align=\"center\" |Hayley TamaddonGiovanna FletcherSam Bailey\n|-\n!Dean Paxton\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Luke Baker\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |George Sampson\n| align=\"center\" |Jordan Ricketts\n|-\n!Laika Virgin\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Spencer Stafford\n| align=\"center\" |Vileda Moppe(Alex Anstey)\n| align=\"center\" |Mary Mac(John Paul McCue)\n| align=\"center\" |David O’Reilly\n| align=\"center\" |Ky Kelly(Anthony Glyde)\n|-\n!Jamie's Dad (Wayne New)\n| align=\"center\" |Ken Christiansen\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Cameron Johnson\n| align=\"center\" |Akshay St Clair\n|-\n!Sandra Bollock\n| align=\"center\" |Raj Ghatak\n| align=\"center\" |Vinegar Strokes(Daniel Jacob)\n| align=\"center\" |Cameron Johnson\n| align=\"center\" |Leon Craig\n| align=\"center\" |Garry Lee\n|-\n!Tray Sophisticay\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |James Gillan\n| align=\"center\" |Rhys Taylor\n| align=\"center\" |James Gillan\n| align=\"center\" |David Mcnair\n|-\n!Becca\n| align=\"center\" |Gabrielle Brooks\n| align=\"center\" |Lauran Rae\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Talia Palamathanan\n| align=\"center\" |Annabelle Laing\n|-\n!Bex\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Harriet Payne\n| align=\"center\" |Jessica Meegan\n| align=\"center\" |Harriet Payne\n| align=\"center\" |Jessica Daugirda\n|-\n!Fatimah\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Courtney Bowman\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Jodie Knight\n| align=\"center\" |Rhiannon Bacchus\n|-\n!Vicki\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Kirstie Skivington\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Kazmin Borrer\n| align=\"center\" |Liv Ashman\n|-\n!Mickey\n| align=\"center\" |Barney Hudson\n| align=\"center\" |Ryan Hughes\n| align=\"center\" |Ellis Brownhill\n| align=\"center\" |Ryan Hughes\n| align=\"center\" |Thomas Walton\n|-\n!Sayid\n| align=\"center\" |Kush Khanna\n| align=\"center\" |Jordan Cunningham\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Adam Taylor\n| align=\"center\" |Geoff Berrisford\n|-\n!Cy\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Shiv Rabheru\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Richard Appiah-Sarpong\n| align=\"center\" |Joshian Angelo Omana\n|-\n!Levi\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Daniel Davids\n| align=\"center\" |Simeon Beckett\n| align=\"center\" |Zion Battles\n| align=\"center\" |Luca Moscardini\n|-\n|}\n†The character Leigh in the Sheffield production was renamed Ray for the West End transfer.\nThe character of Wayne New is not given a name in the stage production;

Think about it too much, though, and the bubble gets pricked.\"\nMark Shenton of The Stage thought highly of the show, commenting \"Everybody should soon be talking about ''Everybody's Talking About Jamie. This new British musical is by turns courageous and outrageous.\"\nAwards and nominations\nOriginal West End production\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"20%\"| Award\n! width=\"40%\"| Category\n! width=\"20%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |2017\n| colspan=\"3\" | Attitude'' Culture Award\n|\n|-\n|Critics' Circle Theatre Award\n|Most Promising Newcomer\n|John McCrea\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |2018\n| rowspan=\"4\" |WhatsOnStage Awards\n| colspan=\"2\" | Best New Musical\n|\n|-\n| Best Actor in a Musical\n| John McCrea\n|\n|-\n|Best Actress in a Musical\n|Josie Walker\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actress in a Musical\n| Lucie Shorthouse\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Laurence Olivier Awards\n| colspan=\"2\" | Best New Musical\n|\n|-\n| Best Actor in a Musical\n|John McCrea\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress in a Musical\n| Josie Walker\n|\n|-\n|Best Theatre Choreographer\n|Kate Prince\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Achievement in Music\n|Music and orchestrations by Dan Gillespie Sells, his debut as a musical theatre composer and orchestrator at Apollo Theatre\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |2019\n| rowspan=\"3\" |WhatsOnStage Awards\n| colspan=\"2\" |Best West End show\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Best Original Cast Recording\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |2020\n| colspan=2| Audience Award for Best Musical\n|\n|}\nLive stage recording and film adaptation\nOn 5 July 2018, the musical was broadcast live in cinemas across the United Kingdom and Ireland.
