It was released through Verve Records on September 25, 2007.\nBackground\nFollowing The Dana Owens Album released in 2004, this is Latifah's second singing album containing cover versions of jazz standards. The album spent three weeks atop the Billboard Jazz Albums chart.\nThe album cut \"I'm Gonna Live Till I Die\" won the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s), which was presented to its arranger, John Clayton. ''Trav'lin' Light'' was also nominated for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.\nThe album's first song and subsequently first single, \"Poetry Man\" is a cover of Phoebe Snow's song of the same name.\nCritical reception\n| rev2  = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev2score  = C+\n}}\nWilliam Ruhlman of AllMusic claimed \"''Trav'lin' Light is, if anything, even better than that Grammy-nominated set, The Dana Owens Album''. In song after song, she has come up with a character to portray through the lyrics, and that helps make her interpretations convincing. Sometimes, it is the songwriters themselves she seems to be channeling...however, it is the singer herself who deserves the credit for making the album work. As with her acting, Queen Latifah's singing is most laudable for not trying to do too much; she may evoke James or Nina Simone or Holiday (or Smokey Robinson or the Pointer Sisters), but she never tries to outsing them; rather, her versions are glosses on the greats she and her producers so admire.\" Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman review was less favorable, stating \"between 2004's The Dana Owens Album and her run as a movie-musical diva, the 'Hey, that rapper lady can sing!' novelty has worn off. We now wonder if Latifah can succeed Diana Krall—or Rod Stewart!—as our leading pop-standards standard-bearer. Taste prevails, but personality must be left to the hundred more interesting jazz singers out there.\" Thomas Conrad of JazzTimes proclaimed that \"the title is a bit ironic. For this 13-track collection, a follow-up to Latifah’s 2004 The Dana Owens Album, she’s carrying a lot of baggage. There’s also the weight of history. Can a politicized rapper turned Oscar-nominated actress be taken seriously when she makes a mid-career segue into soul-infused jazz singing? Truth is, as velvet-smooth journeys into the pop-jazz canon go, ''Trav'lin' Light'' is an estimable exercise in showmanship, shaped by a well-seasoned pro who, though perhaps lacking the daring of a Cassandra Wilson or Diana Krall, is deserving of respectful attention. Sure, her cover of 10cc's 'I'm Not in Love' is a little too Diana Ross, and, yes, her reading of Smokey Robinson's 'What Love Has Joined Together' ventures nary an inch from its carefully choreographed Motown roots. But those are the exceptions here, not the rule.\" Billboards Chuck Taylor called it \"a marvelous sonic achievement, recorded with such satiny care and class that it seems a crime that anyone might belittle the listening experience with an MP3 player or computer.\"\nTrack listing\n| title1  = Poetry Man\n| writer1  = Phoebe Snow\n| length1  = 4:39\n| title2  = Georgia Rose\n| note2  = featuring
