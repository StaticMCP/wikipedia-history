The North Eastern Marine Engineering Co. Ltd. of Sunderland built her 335 nominal horsepower three-cylinder triple expansion steam engine. She had six corrugated furnaces with a combined heating surface of  heat to heat her three  single-ended boilers, which had a combined heating surface of . She was fitted with direction finding equipment.\nShe was launched as SS Roxburgh for B.J. Sutherland and Company of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1937 the Tower Hill Steamship Company, an offshoot of Counties Ship Management, bought her and renamed her SS Tower Field'.\nDamage and repair\nOn 10 May 1941 Tower Field was steaming in ballast from London to Newcastle when a German aircraft attacked and damaged her off the Outer Dowsing Buoy in the Thames Estuary. She was repaired and returned to service.\nOn 19 October 1941 she was entering Workington Channel off Hull with a cargo of iron ore when she ran aground and fractured her hull. She broke in two but her cargo was discharged and she was refloated and repaired.\nThe Ministry of War Transport took her over and renamed her 'SS Empire Tower' but kept her under CSM management. She returned to service in December 1942.\ns wreck\n|relief= yes\n}}\nSinking\nEarly in 1943 Empire Tower, under Captain David John Williams OBE, joined Convoy XK-2 from Gibraltar to the UK. On 5 March the German Type IX submarine  attacked the convoy and sank Empire Tower, ,  and . Empire Tower sank within a minute and Captain Williams, six gunners and 35 crew were lost. The Royal Navy armed trawler  rescued three survivors and landed them at Londonderry, Northern Ireland.\nOne week later, on 12 March, a depth charge attack by US Navy destroyer  west of the Azores sank U-130 with the loss of all 53 hands.\nReferences"
