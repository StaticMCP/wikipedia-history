Accidentally discovered in 1985, the site has been subjected to debate among historians about its origin. The highly Indianized civilization which developed this site inhabited it between the 4th century and 9th centuries AD. The hill temple 1A of Cát Tiên features the largest stone lingam ever found in Southeast Asia.\nGallery\nImage:Temple 2 Cat Tien.jpg|One of the temples at mound no.2\nImage:A1 Temple Cat Tien.jpg|Temple 1A on top of a hill\nImage:Cat Tien large lingam.jpg|Stone lingam at temple 1A, at 2.1 meter tall, this is the largest stone lingam ever found in Southeast Asia\nImage:Lintel Cat Tien.jpg|Lintels of temple, Cát Tiên Museum exhibition\nImage:Cat Tien lingam.jpg|A stone linga\nImage:Cat Tien gold.jpg|Golden leaf with Lakshmi figure.
