The couple owned a plantation in Queen's Creek, Virginia. Her account of Bacon's Rebellion is in the form of a letter written in 1676 and published in its original form in 1804 in the Richmond Enquirer under the title An account of our late troubles in Virginia. A poem, \"Bacon's Epitaph, Made by His Man\" and a follow-up \"Upon the Death of G.B.\" [General Bacon], are attributed to Ann or her husband.
