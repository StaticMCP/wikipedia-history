John Stuart was the Rector.\nThe present church building was constructed at another location (King St. at Johnson St.) during the years 1825–1828. Architect William Coverdale enlarged it in 1838–1840 with the addition of a rebuilt steeple and the doric portico 1842.\nIt was elevated to cathedral status in 1862. In 1891–1894 the transepts, choir and dome were built but shortly thereafter in 1899 the interior was badly damaged by fire. S. George Curry (architect) and Joseph Power performed a complete restoration in 1899–1900.\nWorship at the Cathedral\nThe Cathedral is currently led by The Very Rev. Douglas Michael (Dean of Ontario/Rector of Kingston, 2022-) and Brad Barbeau (Director of Music, 2020-). The current Bishop of Ontario is the Right Rev. William Grant Cliff (2023-).\nSunday Services: 8am (Holy Eucharist, BCP) & 10:30am (Choral Eucharist, BAS)\nChoral Evensong: 1st and 3rd Wednesdays @ 7:00pm\nOther weekday service times are available on the Cathedral website.\nAssociation with the Royal Military College\nFor many years Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) cadets and other military groups have marched into St. George's for worship on special occasions. 'Copper Sunday', an annual church parade from RMC to St. George's, in which cadets took up a collection of copper coins, was established in 1882 or earlier. A memorial tablet was erected before 1899 to the memory of three officers, graduates of the Royal Military College of Canada, who died while serving in Africa: Huntly Brodie Mackay, Captain Royal Engineers; William Henry Robinson, Captain Royal Engineers; and William Grant Stairs, Captain the Welsh Regiment, but was lost in the 1899 fire and was not replaced.\nIn 1918, the Royal Military College's Great War Memorial Flag was presented to the rector of St. George's Cathedral, the Very Rev. Dean Starr, honorary chaplain to the college, by the then Commandant, Brig. General C. N. Perreau, C.M.G.. The 18 feet by 24 feet flag hung on the north gallery of the cathedral, until the summer of 1934, when it was removed to the college museum for preservation. 932 Maple leaves represent those graduates who served, and 147 crimson leaves represent those who paid the supreme sacrifice in the Great War.\nof the Royal Military College of Canada was placed in the cathedral in 1942.]]\nIn a 1942 church parade ceremony, General Hertzberg asked permission of the churchwarden, RMC Professor W.R.P. Bridger to lay up the RMC colours in the cathedral. After the congregation were addressed by the Lord Bishop of Ontario, the cadet battalion marched back to the college.\nA virtual tour the Royal Military College of Canada gallery at the Cathedral Church of St. George features stained glass windows of several soldier saints including St. George. The most recent windows—the St. Cecilia window and the St. Margaret window—also in the RMC gallery, were installed in 2002 and 2003 respectively.\nPopular culture\nSt. George's Cathedral, Kingston was treated fictionally as St. Nicholas's, Salterton, in Robertson Davies's novel Leaven of Malice.\nNotable Burials\n* Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham, Governor General of the United Province of Canada 1839-1841\nGallery\nFile:Kingston_-_ON_-_St._George%27s_Cathedral1.jpg|View in 2009\nFile:St._George%27s_Cathedral_Kingston_Ontario_2015.jpg|View in 2015\nFile:ON_-_Kingston_-_St._George%27s_Cathedral.jpg|View at night\nFile:Saint-George-Cathedral-Kingston-May-2024.jpg|View in May 2024\nSee also\n* List of cathedrals in Canada\n* Saint George in devotions, traditions and prayers\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.virtualkingston.ca/fullscreens/stgeorges/stgeorges_south.html Virtual tour of St. George's Cathedral]\n*[http://www.heritagefdn.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_8854_1.html  Ontario Heritage Trust St. George's Cathedral (City of Kingston) - 1825]"
