A forward, he played for Newcastle United, Norwich City, Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City and managed Crewe Alexandra and Northwich Victoria.\nPlaying career\nWare was born in Birmingham before his family moved to Stoke-on-Trent. Ware played for Hanley St.Luke's and Stoke St. Peter's before joining Stoke City in 1930 and made his debut at the Victoria Ground against Burnley on 4 October 1930. He scored twice in eight matches in 1931–32 and then scored seven goals in 31 matches in 1932–33, helping Stoke to win the Second Division. Ware struggled to establish himself in the First Division and was sold to Newcastle United in the summer of 1935. He spent two seasons on Tyneside, scoring nine goals in 49 matches, and then spent three months at Sheffield Wednesday, scoring once. In November 1937 he joined Norwich City until World War II interrupted his career.\nIn March 1940 he joined Port Vale as a guest, before moving on to Northampton Town, Nottingham Forest, Stoke City, Crystal Palace and Watford, returning to Vale for two more guest appearances in December 1944, before joining Northwich Victoria.\nManagerial career\nAfter the war, Ware spent three spells in charge of Cheshire County League side Northwich Victoria between 1947 and 1953 and served Dutch side E.D.O. Haarlem as trainer-coach before returning to Burslem in November 1956 to serve Port Vale as a coach under manager Freddie Steele. He left Vale Park in June 1958 to become manager of Crewe Alexandra. He led the \"Railwaymen\" to 18th and 14th places finishes in the Fourth Division in 1958–59 and 1959–60. He spent 100 games in charge at Gresty Road before leaving in May 1960. He moved on to Stoke City as assistant trainer, then reserve team manager, and finally a scout.\nCareer statistics\nPlaying statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Stoke City\n|1930–31\n|Second Division\n|1||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n|1931–32\n|Second Division\n|6||2||2||0||8||2\n|-\n|1932–33\n|Second Division\n|29||7||2||0||31||7\n|-\n|1933–34\n|First Division\n|13||4||0||0||13||4\n|-\n|1934–35\n|First Division\n|4||2||0||0||4||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!53!!15!!4!!0!!57!!15\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Newcastle United\n|1935–36\n|Second Division\n|32||9||5||0||37||9\n|-\n|1936–37\n|Second Division\n|12||0||0||0||12||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!44!!9!!5!!0!!49!!9\n|-\n|Sheffield Wednesday\n|1937–38\n|Second Division\n|12||1||0||0||12||1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Norwich City\n|1937–38\n|Second Division\n|26||6||1||0||27||6\n|-\n|1938–39\n|Second Division\n|18||7||0||0||18||7\n|-\n|1945–46\n|War League\n|colspan=\"2\"|–||1||1||1||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!43!!13!!2!!1!!45!!14\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!152!!38!!11!!1!!163!!39\n|}\nManagerial statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ Managerial record by team and tenure\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Team\n!rowspan=2|From\n!rowspan=2|To\n!colspan=5|Record\n|-\n!!!!!!!!!\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Crewe Alexandra\n|align=\"left\"|1 August 1958\n|align=left|31 May 1960\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Total\n|}\nHonours\nStoke City\n* Football League Second Division: 1932–33\nReferences"
