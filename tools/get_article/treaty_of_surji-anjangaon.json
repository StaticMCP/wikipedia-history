The agreement was the result of Major General Arthur Wellesley's military campaigns in Central India in the first phase of the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-1805). As a result of this treaty, Ganges-Jumna Doab, Haryana, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat and fort of Ahmadnagar, eventually came under the control of the British East India Company.\nThe treaty was revised twice (once in November 1805 and again on 5 November 1817). The first revision mostly entailed restoring the territories of Gwalior and Gohad to Sindhia. The second revision of the treaty entailed granting Sindhia more power in return for providing help to the British in their fight against the Pindaris in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.\nSee also\n*List of treaties\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20070927014553/http://202.41.97.35/britannica/showhismodern.asp?artid=353 Encyclopædia Britannica Online: Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon]"
