It was released through Def Jam Recordings and ILH Productions as the tenth track from his seventh studio album, Swag, on July 11, 2025. The song was produced by Bieber himself, Eddie Benjamin, Carter Lang, and Dylan Wiggins, with the four of them writing it alongside Tobias Jesso Jr., Jackson Morgan, and Daniel Chetrit.\nComposition and critical reception\n\"Walking Away\" is inspired by Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber, in which he dismisses false relationship narratives about them that were represented in the media in the past few years, while promising to stay committed to her and change his ways for the better. A \"pensive\" song, sings over soft Roland TR-808 drums about having a solid relationship with her. Lyndsey Havens of Billboard ranked it third among the album's tracks and described it as \"a goosebump-raising confessional about why Bieber isn't 'walking away' from his marriage\", summarizing that \"this song functions like a refreshingly honest vow renewal, as Bieber recalls giving Hailey her ring and promising to change\" and \"he sounds undoubtedly sincere — but then again, there's only one listener who can be the judge of that\".\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Walking Away\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 38\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten)\n| 29\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania Airplay (TopHit)\n| 52\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)\n| 28\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Norway (IFPI Norge)\n| 91\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Philippines (Philippines Hot 100)\n| 89\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan)\n| 3\n|-\n|}\nMonthly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Monthly chart performance for \"Walking Away\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania Airplay (TopHit)\n| 55\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
