      "text": "# Warrigal Creek Massacre__disambig_1\n\nWarrigal Creek is the site of an 1843 massacre of Gunai/Kurnai people in colonial Victoria, during the Australian frontier wars. The creek is on a farm near Sale,   east of Melbourne, in the South Gippsland area of Victoria, Australia.\nMassacre\nIn July 1843, a man named Ronald Macalister was killed by Aboriginal men near Port Albert, on the coast of Victoria. The Scottish colonist and pastoralist, Angus McMillan, led a group of around 20 colonists to attack and kill several groups of Aboriginal people across a number of days. The group of Gaelic-speaking Scotsmen was known as the \"Highland Brigade\". The attack on the Brataualung people camped at Warrigal Creek was one of several incidents resulting in loss of life among the Gunai Kurnai people.\n}}\nThe estimates of numbers of deaths vary: some historical accounts say that 60 people were killed, while other sources suggest that up to 150 people may have been killed. Some historians assert that the number of 60 is an exaggeration, despite the witness accounts. The statistical discrepancies likely emerged because Macmillan's group killed Aboriginal people at five different locations in the area.\nA witness, William Hoddinott of East Bairnsdale, wrote an account of the Highland Brigade in 1925 under the pseudonym of 'Gippslander'. Hoddinott wrote a similar account in 1940.\n}}\nHoddinott said that more than 100 Aboriginal people were killed on that day.\nAbout two years later, Assistant Protector of Aborigines William Thomas learnt that because of the deaths, there were not many Aboriginal people left in the area.\n}}\nHistorian Peter Gardner, in a review of all accounts of the massacre, wrote that MacMillan and the Highland Brigade aimed to wipe out all the Aboriginal people in the area. Gardner concludes that McMillan's group initially killed two family groups at Warrigal Creek waterhole and then a few days later killed another 60 people at the mouth of Warrigal Creek, then killing three other groups at Freshwater Creek, Gammon Creek, and Red Hill.\n}}\nDespite the widespread belief that MacMillan led several massacres,  there are over 12 monuments in the Gippsland region dedicated to him.\nSee also\n* Gunaikurnai people\n* Gippsland massacres\n* List of massacres of Indigenous Australians\nReferences\nBibliography\n* The Book of the Bush\n* \"The Settling of Gippsland - A Regional History\", by Patrick Morgan, published by Gippsland Municipalities Association, Traralgon, 1997\n* Gardner, Peter, 'The Warrigal Creek massacre', Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, pp.&nbsp;47–51, June, 1980.\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*"
