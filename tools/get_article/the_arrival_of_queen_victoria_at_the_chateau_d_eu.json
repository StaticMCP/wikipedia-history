Accompanied by a mounted escort, the queen is visible in the carriage with other members of the royal party. Victoria attended the Château with her husband Prince Albert and the Foreign Secretary Lord Aberdeen, as part of the growing friendship between the countries. It was the first foreign visit for the young Victoria and marked the first time an English monarch had visited since Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520.\nIt was one of four paintings depicting various scenes of the visit, commissioned to commemorate the event by Louis Phillipe.\nToday the painting is in the collection of the Palace of Versailles. A watercolour of the scene by Lami is now in the British Royal Collection, having been presented to Victoria by Louis Phillipe in 1844 when he made a reciprocal visit to Windsor Castle.\nSee also\n* The Arrival of King Louis Philippe at Windsor Castle, an 1845 painting by Édouard Pingret\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Lemoisne, Paul-André.
