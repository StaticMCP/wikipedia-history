The sculptor is Fuad Abdurakhmanov, the Peoples Artist of the Azerbaijan SSR, the architect is Mikael Useinov, the Peoples Architect of the USSR.\nThe expressive figure of Mehdi Huseynzade in a fluttering cloak and with a grenade in his right hand stands on an unworked block of granite. As noted by the art critic Kamil Mammadzade, the attention is drawn to \"the accuracy of the proportions ratio of the sculptural and architectural parts. The authors used the features of the relief of the mountainous part of the city, due to which the monument is clearly visible. According to the art critic Jamila Novruzova, the monument “combines as complex psychological tasks, also and monumental and decorative ones”.\n}}"
