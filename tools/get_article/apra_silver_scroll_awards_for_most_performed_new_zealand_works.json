The awards were presented by APRA AMCOS New Zealand, the copyright collective representing New Zealand composers, lyricists and music publishers. The awards were presented annually at the APRA Silver Scroll Awards. The award was last presented in 2015.\nWhile the national award was highly contested, from 2000 to 2012 the international award was dominated by Crowded House's 1986 song \"Don't Dream It's Over\".\nMost Performed New Zealand Work in New Zealand\nThe Most Performed New Zealand Work in New Zealand winner is determined by APRA NZ, using data provided by New Zealand television and radio. The award covers the period of 1 July to 30 June each year. At least 50% of the song must have been written by an APRA New Zealand member.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!
