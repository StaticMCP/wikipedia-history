He played for the Otago cricket team between the 1999–00 season and 2011–12, making more than 170 senior appearances for the side.\nMcSkimming was born at Ranfurly in Central Otago in 1979 and educated at Waitaki Boys' High School. His father, Bryan McSkimming, had played Hawke Cup cricket for Central Otago and had played in the Otago provincial side's Second XI.\nA medium-paced bowler who focussed \"more on accuracy, rather than bounce or pace, McSkimming played age-group cricket for Otago from the 1996–97 season and played three youth One Day Internationals for the New Zealand under-19 side against an England under-19 side in early 1999. He went on to make his senior representative debut for Otago in December of the same year, playing a List A against Canterbury, opening the bowling without taking a wicket and scoring two not out. He made his first-class debut later the same season, taking five wickets for Otago against the same side.\nMcSkimming went on to play regularly for Otago in a career which last until the end of the 2010–11 season. He took 240 first-class and 117 List A wickets and made a first-class century, a score of 111 runs made as part of an Otago record ninth wicket partnership of 208 runs with Bradley Scott against Auckland in 2004–05. He played for the New Zealand A side four times, touring Sri Lanka with the side in 2005 and playing against a touring England side in 2008–09. Although he was never capped by the national side, he was selected in the 30-man preliminary New Zealand squad for the Champions Trophy in 2006.\nReferences"
