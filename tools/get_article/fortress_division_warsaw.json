The division was destroyed in the fighting for the capture of Warsaw by the Soviets, its remains being either captured or fleeing back into Germany.\nDivisional history\nThe division was set up in early January 1945 in the Polish capital Warsaw to defend the same against the Red Army as part of the strategy of permanent positions.\nThe dissolving division, subordinate to the 9th Army, was initially probably enclosed in Warsaw (on January 16, the defense consisted of only four battalions of the fortress division). and later, after the city was captured, on January 18, 1945, almost completely destroyed by the Red Army. Then the remnants of the Fortress Division Warsaw united with the 73rd Infantry Division to strengthen the defense of Festung Thorn. Previously, the commander of the 9th Army, General der Panzertruppe Smilo von Lüttwitz, had given up the defense of the city without a higher order, which dissolved the cohesion of the troops. Generalleutnant Friedrich Weber, the commander of the fortress division, was then transferred to the Führerreserve, sentenced to parole at the front and no longer received a military command.\nThe division was officially disbanded on February 27, 1945.\nCommander\nGeneralleutnant Friedrich Weber (January 1945).\nOrganization\n* Festungs-Regiment 8\n** 1.
