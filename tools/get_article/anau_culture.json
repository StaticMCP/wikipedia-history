It started during the Chalcolithic period around 4000 BC, following the Neolithic Jeitun culture. It is named after its main site of Anau, Turkmenistan.\nThe Namazga culture was contemporary to the Anau culture.\nPottery similar to that of Anau (the earliest Anau IA phase) has been found as far as Shir Ashian Tepe in the Semnan Province of Iran.\nSite of Anau\nThe settlement of Anau started around 4500 BC in the Neolithic period, before copper was used. Thus, it is earlier than Namazga-Tepe, the main site of the Namazga culture.\nAnau includes two mounds, north and south. Archaeological research here began in 1890. Raphael Pumpelly, Marushchenko, and Khurban Sokhatov were some of the researchers over the years.\nThe lowest layers of the north mound in Anau provide some good evidence for the transition from the Neolithic to the Chalcolithic in the area. This archaeological sequence is known as Anau IA.\nMore recent excavations at Monjukli Depe, which also has some Anau culture occupational levels, also helped to establish the regional chronology.\nThe northern mound also presents remains of the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age. Some copper items, as well as imported Lapis lazuli have been found. The southern mound also has the Iron Age remains.\nAlthough there are some similarities between the Anau IA and Jeitun ceramics, there are also many differences. Jeitun ceramics mostly use a plant-based temper, whereas those of Anau IA were tempered with a large amount of sand and bits of other ceramics.\nAnau IA also has similarities to Tepe Sialk I and II layers. Ceramics similar to Anau IA are also found on the Iranian plateau, in northeastern Iran, and in southern Turkmenistan.\nRemains of the domestic pig Sus vittatus have been found here in the first sedentary horizon seemingly having appeared suddenly which would indicate it having been imported.  Sus vittatus was first domesticated in Southeast Asia.\nEarly Chalcolithic\nThe Early Chalcolithic period Anau IB followed after Anau IA. This period also parallels the Namazga I period, the beginning of settlement at Namazga.\n: “Anau IB-Namazga I [period] has been recognized to be associated with an increase in population and advancements in every cultural-economic realm compared to the previous period in southern Turkmenistan. In this period, the settlements of the previous period expanded and reached an extent of 10-15 hectares; new settlements also appeared”.\nStamp seal\nAn enigmatic stamp seal was found here, that may be the first evidence of an indigenous written language in Anau. The find is dated to c. 2300 BC.\nBronze Age seals from Altyndepe provide some parallels to the Anau seal. Two similar stamp seals have been found at Altyndepe with the same dimensions as the Anau seal.\nThese seals are also similar to the ones from Tepe Hissar and from Tepe Sialk in Iran, where such seals with geometric designs go back to the 5th millennium BC. Also, some Chinese parallels to the Anau seal are possible.\nSee also\n*Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex\nBibliography\n* Gian Luca Bonora, Massimo Vidale (2013), [https://web.archive.org/web/20190227223247/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/87b9/02165732cd30eed137f973e2568a1eed7ba2.pdf The Middle Chalcolithic in Southern Turkmenistan and the Archaeological Record of Ilgynly Depe.] In: PETRIE C.
