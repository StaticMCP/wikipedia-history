The Don Republic existed during the Russian Civil War after the collapse of the Russian Empire from 1918 to 1920.\nIn April 1918, after the liberation of Novocherkassk from control of the Don Soviet Republic, a Don Provisional Government was formed under Georgy Petrovich Yanov. On 11 May, the \"circle for the Salvation of the Don\" opened, which organized the anti-Bolshevik war. On 16 May, Pyotr Krasnov was elected Ataman. On 17 May, Krasnov presented his \"Basic Laws of The All Great Don Host.\" Its 50 points included the inviolability of private property and abolished all laws promulgated since the abdication of Nicholas II. Krasnov also encouraged nationalism. According to Peter Kenez, \"This new preoccupation with the glories of the past allowed the Cossacks to regard the struggle against their enemies as a war of national liberation, not merely one for defending their private interests against their fellow citizens.\"\nThe Don Republic claimed the territory of the Don region with the city of Novocherkassk as its capital. Administratively, the Don Republic was divided into ten okrugs, covering an area located in the Rostov and Volgograd Oblasts of RSFSR and in the Lugansk and Donetsk Oblasts of the neighboring Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic.\nAccording to Peter Kenez, \"Krasnov named Semenov, one of the army officers, 'governor' of Voronezh province (the part that had been liberated) and Colonel Manakin 'governor' of Saratov province.\"\nThe Don Republic ceased to exist after the Don Cossacks, who formed an essential part of the White Army, were defeated by the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. Many of the Russian Cossacks on Don were subjected to the Decossackization in 1919–1921, during the Soviet famine of 1932–33 and because of the repatriation of Cossacks after the Second World War by the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union, resulting in the eventual disappearance of the Don Cossacks' movement of resistance to the Soviet Union.\nGallery\n1918-DonGeography.jpg\nВсевелико Войско Донское.jpg|Medal of the Great Don Army: Defender of the Free Don.\nГерб ВВД 1919.png|Coat of arms of the Almighty Don Host (1919)\nSee also\n* Don Army\n* Don Host Oblast\n* South Russia (1919–1920)\n* Armed Forces of South Russia\n* Kuban People's Republic, a government formed by the Kuban Cossacks in 1918\n* Ukrainian People's Republic\n* Post-Russian Empire states\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.net-film.eu/film-27640/ Footages of Don Republic (1918)]"
