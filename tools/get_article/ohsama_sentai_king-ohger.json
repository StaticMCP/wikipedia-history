This series is the first in the franchise where all of the main characters have both an insectoid and royalty motif.\nThe series premiered on March 5, 2023, joining Kamen Rider Geats and later, Kamen Rider Gotchard in the Super Hero Time lineup on TV Asahi following the finale of Avataro Sentai Donbrothers. Part of its plot and characters include some tie-ins with Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger, celebrating that series's tenth anniversary. The final episode aired in February 2024, and the series was succeeded by Bakuage Sentai Boonboomger in the Super Hero Time block the following month.\nPlot\nTwo millennia ago on the planet Chikyu, a group of heroes joined forces to defeat and exile the Underground Empire Bug Naraku to the planet's subterranean levels through their guardian deity Legend King-Ohger. Afterward, the heroes disbanded, five of them establishing the kingdoms of Shugodom, Nkosopa, Ishabana, Gokkan, and Tofu, respectively. But a prophecy later spreads that the Bug Naraku will return.\nIn the present, fifteen years after a catastrophe known as the Wrath of God, the current rulers' attempted alliance fails as the Bug Naraku attack Shugodom per the genocide decree of their King Dezunaraku VIII. A Shugodom youth named Gira learned his king King Rcules Husty plots to have the conflict justify his agenda of unifying the kingdoms under his rule, disgusted by Rcules' callous intent of sacrificing their people and steals his Ohger Calibur, the kings' symbol of authority. Gira declares himself as an \"evil king\" bent on destroying Rcules' reign, awakening the Shugods that form King-Ohger while branded a traitor despite being later revealed to be Rcules' missing younger brother. Gira forms an alliance with the other rulers: President Yanma Gast of Nkosopa, Queen Hymeno Ran of Ishabana, Chief Justice Rita Kaniska of Gokkan, and Overlord Kaguragi Dybowski of Tofu to save their world from the Bug Naraku and depose Rcules while gathering the other Shugods needed to form Legend King-Ohger.\nThey are eventually joined in their quest by the historian Jeramie Brasieri, revealed as the half-Bug Naraku son of a forgotten sixth hero whose existence was erased from history for falling in love with a Bug Naraku royal, who fabricated the prophecy in a scheme to unite the two races. The six soon form a new alliance known as the \"Ohsama Sentai King-Ohger\". After Gira exposes the deposed Rcules and succeeds as Shugodom's king, he convinces Dezunaraku to reconcile with humanity once Jeramie learned his prophecy caused the current Bug Naraku attack. But Dezunaraku is fatally wounded by his right hand Kamejim, revealed to have orchestrated the Human/Bug Naraku conflict, with Jeramie establishing an official sixth kingdom of Chikyu for the Bug Naraku to live in peace. Prior to Gira's coronation, the Ohsama Sentai briefly ventured into the underworld of Hākabāka where they meet the founder king Lainor Husty, who cryptically reveals an impending calamity that would befall Chikyuu.\nTwo years later, the King-Ohgers face a new threat to their world when Kamejim's master, the Galactinsect King Dagded Dujardin, arrives to force Chikyu in resuming the war or be destroyed. But Gira learns that Dagded is the true mastermind of the Human/Bug Naraku conflict by forcing House Husty into his service with his Galactinsect Jesters causing the Wrath of God incident, refusing to allow the war's renewal while he and the others expose Dagded's deeds. Dagded responds by sending the rulers to Earth, learning their ancestors migrated from there while helping the Kyoryugers defeat the revived Deboth Army. Upon their return, the Ohsama Sentai resume control of their kingdoms which were taken over by Dagded's Jesters and Rcules, who eventually reveals that he played the role of a dictator to win Dagded's trust and destroy him, joining forces with them after he completes his plan to kill the Galactinsect King. However, Dagded is later resurrected by the Jesters.\nThe Ohsama Sentai learn about an ancient power known as the Kings' Proof used by their predecessors to end the war 2000 years ago and reawaken it in order to make stand against Dagded while destroying the remaining Jesters except for Kamejim. Despite with their new powers, the King-Ohgers fail to defeat Dagded and decide to hold him long enough for the inhabitants of the six kingdoms to escape Chikyu. However, the subjects refuse to abandon their kings and together, they participate in one last battle against the Galactinsects, briefly assisted from deceased warriors and kings summoned from Hākabāka, culminating with Kamejim killed and dragged to Hākabāka, and Dagded ultimately destroyed by the Ohsama Sentai and their mecha. Unbeknownst to the Ohsama Sentai, a Kyoryuger leader, Daigo Kiryu, the Kyoryu Red was revealed to have been captured by Dagded all along, until the monarchs indirectly saved him from his imprisonment once they destroyed the Galactinsect King in the final battle. After the battle, the borders of the six kingdoms are abolished and their inhabitants begin traveling and living freely around Chikyu, watched over by the King-Ohgers.\nProduction\nAccording to Takahito Ōmori, the production of King-Ohger started one and a half years in advance, unlike the usual one-year preparation of previous Sentai series.\nThe Ohsama Sentai King-Ohger trademark was registered by Toei on September 21, 2022, and published on September 30, 2022.\nKing-Ohger was officially announced on December 21, 2022.
