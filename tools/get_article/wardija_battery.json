It was built by the British in 1915, and saw use during World War I. It became obsolete following the construction of Fort Campbell in 1938.\nHistory\nIn October 1914, the British authorities made St. Paul's Bay an examination anchorage, and decided to build a battery to identify shipping on the way to the Grand Harbour, and fire warning shots to ships who were not obeying the regulations. In May 1915, two submarines were sighted off Malta outside the range of coastal artillery, hastening the need to build a battery in the north of the island.\nBetween 30 November and 10 December 1915, the Royal Malta Artillery removed two 6-inch QF guns from the obsolete Wolseley Battery in the south of Malta, and mounted them in a position on the eastern end of the Wardija Ridge. The site was naturally protected so no permanent fortifications were built, and the battery only consisted of two gun emplacements. The two guns were designated Wardija Battery on 31 December 1915, and fell under the command of the Western Section Royal Garrison Artillery. The battery remained in active service throughout the course of World War I.\nWardija Battery became obsolete in 1938, when its role was taken over by Fort Campbell. In World War II, a gun-laying radar set was established on the site of the battery.\nWardija Battery's two gun emplacements are still intact today.\nFurther reading\n*[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20120103/opinion/Intriguing-public-land-issues.400850 Details]\nReferences"
