The following dates and times are in New Zealand Daylight Time (UTC+13) until 3 April and New Zealand Standard Time (UTC+12) from 4 April.\nOn 14 February 2021, at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved up to alert level 3 and the rest of New Zealand to level 2 after new community cases were detected in Auckland during level 1. On 17 February at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to level 2 and the rest of the country to level 1. On 22 February at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to level 1. On 28 February at 6:00 am, Auckland moved back up to level 3 while the rest of New Zealand moved to level 2. On 7 March at 6:00 am, Auckland moved back to level 2 while the rest of New Zealand moved to level 1. On 12 March, Auckland moved back to level 1 at midday.\nOn 17 August 2021 at 11:59&nbsp;pm, after a report of a new community case presumed to be infected with the Delta variant of the virus earlier that day, New Zealand moved to alert level 4, entering a nationwide lockdown for a minimum of three days.\nOn 1 September 2021, Auckland and the Northland Region remained on Alert Level 4 while the rest of the country transitioned into Alert Level 3 from 1 September 2021. On 8 September, all of New Zealand except Auckland moved into  Alert Level 2 at 11:59pm on 7 September. However, mandatory mask wearing and limits on both indoor and outdoor gatherings of 50 and 100 people respectively were introduced. On 22 September, Auckland moved down to Alert Level 3 while the rest of the country remained on Alert Level 2. Event limit restrictions were also relaxed for areas under Level 2, with 100 people being allowed in indoor hospitality venues.\nOn 4 October, Alert Level three restrictions were reinstated in several parts of Waikato including Raglan, Huntly, Ngāruawāhia and Hamilton following the detection of community cases. On 7 October, Level 3 restrictions in the Waikato were extended to include a wider area including Te Kūiti, the Waipa District, Ōtorohanga, Te Awamutu, Karapiro and Cambridge. On 8 October, Alert Level 3 restrictions were reinstated in the Northland Region after a positive case from Auckland visited the region.\nOn 2 November, the Waikato region transitioned to step 2 of Alert Level 3. Step 2 allows retailers to operate with face masks and physical distance; increased the number of people at outdoor gatherings to 25; and eliminated the two-household restriction. On 10 November, Auckland transitioned to step 2 of Alert Level 3 from 10 November. As a result, retailers, museums, and zoos reopened while outdoor gatherings were allowed with a 23-person limit. The Far North District, which entered into a Level 3 lockdown the previous week, moved down to Alert Level 2 on 12 November.\nOn 3 December, New Zealand transitioned into the COVID-19 Protection Framework (\"Traffic light system\"), ending the previous \"alert level system\". Auckland and areas in the North Island with low vaccination started on the Red  setting while the rest of the country commenced on the Orange setting. On 15 December, the Government lifted the internal border around Auckland, easing travel to and from the metropolitan region. On 31 December, most areas under the Red setting with the exception of the Northland Region transitioned to the Orange setting.\nTransmission timeline\nData about the previous day is extracted from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's database at 9:00 am daily and is publicly released by the Ministry of Health around 1:00 pm. For most of January, data was released every three days instead.\nJanuary 2021\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=4 | Active cases\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

The lockdown was lifted following two hours after the Ministry of Health confirmed that the worker had returned a negative test.\nOn 7 January, two of the four new border cases were linked to the British B.1.1.7 strain.\nOn 10 January, 19 of the 31 new cases had the B.1.1.7 strain from the United Kingdom, via the United Arab Emirates, Qatar or Singapore. In addition, New Zealand reported its first case of the South African 501.V2 variant. Eleven of the new cases were from a group of international mariners that arrived on 6 January.\nOn 15 January, two of the new 18 cases were historical while the others came from several countries including South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, Bahrain, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Italy, India and Malaysia.\nOn 24 January, a new probable case in the community was reported in Northland. The individual had previously been through an Auckland quarantine facility. Later that night, the Director-General Ashley Bloomfield confirmed that the probable case in Northland was the country's first community transmission in two months. The individual was a 56-year-old woman who had returned from Europe and had completed a 14-day stay in managed isolation at Auckland's Pullman Hotel on 13 January.\nOn 25 January, the Director-General Bloomfield confirmed that the Northland community transmission patient had contracted the South African strain Lineage B.1.1.248. That same day, the Health Ministry released a list of 28 businesses in Auckland and Northland that the patient had visited in the period between 14 and 22 January. Health authorities also identified 15 close contacts of the patient including her husband and a hairdresser who tested negative.\nOn 27 January, the Health Ministry reported that the close contacts of the Northland community case had tested negative for the virus. That same day, the Health Ministry confirmed that two possible COVID-19 cases were being investigated in the Auckland community after testing positive. These two individuals had stayed at Auckland's Pullman Hotel, where the Northland community case had previously stayed.\nOn 28 January, health authorities confirmed that the two individuals from Pullman Hotel (an adult and a child), had tested positive, making them two new community transmissions.\nOn 29 January, the Health Ministry also announced that it would revert to issuing daily reports.\nOn 30 January, one previously reported case has now recovered while three cases reported previously have been reclassified as under investigation. The new case involves a person who arrived from the United States on 28 January. In addition, all close contacts of the border-related cases have tested negative.\nFebruary 2021\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=4 | Active cases\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!

Director of Public Health Dr Caroline McElnay described the case as a recently returned asymptomatic case who had left the Pullman Hotel on 30 January.\nOn 7 February, two of the new cases originated via travel from Zambia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, health authorities confirmed the Hamilton community transmission as the fifth community case reported in 2021.\nOn 13 February, the Health Ministry confirmed the death of a returning COVID-19 patient, who had died of a non-COVID-19 related illness at North Shore Hospital on 5 February. This patient was not included in the COVID-19 official death toll.\nOn 14 February, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins identified the three community cases as three members of family (a mother, father, and daughter) from Papatoetoe, South Auckland. The mother worked at the airline catering service LSG Sky Chefs while the father worked as a tradesperson. The daughter was a Year 9 student at Papatoetoe High School. Two of the confirmed cases had visited New Plymouth on 6–7 February and also visited Pak'nSave supermarket chain's Manukau branch. The family was moved to Jetpark managed isolation and quarantine facility. Papatoetoe High School principal Vaughan Couillaut announced that the school would close on Monday and Tuesday. Five teachers and 28 students at the school were identified as close contacts of the infected student while all other students and staff at the school were considered \"casual\" contacts. In response to the new community cases in Auckland, Auckland moved to Alert level 3 at 11:59 pm, while the rest of New Zealand moved to Alert level 2.\nOn 17 February, the three new community cases included a pair of siblings who attended Papatoetoe High School and knew the student at the center of the city's latest community cluster. The third community case worked at the McDonald's restaurant in Cavendish Drive. That same day, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that Auckland's Level 3 lockdown would end at midnight since the minimal number of new community cases and wastewater testing suggested that the new community transmission was not \"widespread.\" The rest of the country would go into Level 1. That same day, a sixth community case was reported with the individual being in the same household as the two siblings announced earlier today.\nOn 23 February, two new cases were reported and linked to the Papatoetoe High School cluster.\nOn 26 February, the media reported that a family member of a COVID-19 positive student from Papatoetoe High School had defied orders to isolate at home and went to work at the KFC in Botany Downs.\nOn 27 February, the older sibling of a Papatoetoe High School casual plus contact tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, the Government placed Auckland under an Alert Level 3 lockdown for the next seven days, with the rest of the country going back to Alert Level 2.\nOn the evening of 28 February, authorities confirmed a new case that was linked to the Auckland February cluster known as \"Case O.\" Case O is a household contact of Cases I, J, K, and L.\nMarch 2021\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sticky-header-multi sort-under\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! colspan=2 | Cases\n! colspan=2 | Recoveries\n! colspan=2 | Deaths\n! colspan=4 | Active cases\n! rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Sources\n|-\n!
