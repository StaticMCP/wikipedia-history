Initial protests, led largely by local residents, quickly expanded into broader action across over a dozen towns and cities nationwide.\nProtesters voiced concerns over public safety, lack of local consultation, and the government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers—especially male-only facilities. While many participants emphasised these grievances as issues of community planning and transparency, others accused far-right groups of amplifying the protests and injecting nationalist narratives.\nLocal and national groups organised rallies, while opposition coalitions such as Stand Up To Racism and migrant advocacy groups conducted counter-demonstrations to oppose xenophobic rhetoric. Police forces have been deployed extensively, making arrests where protests turned disorderly.\nThe Labour government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, condemned violent incidents while pledging stronger border control, accelerated asylum processing, and eventual reduction of hotel use. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, criticised enforcement transparency and demanded public disclosure of suspects' nationality. Farage positioned the protests as evidence of wider public discontent with immigration policy, while critics warned this risked legitimising community tensions and fueling misinformation.\nAs of August 2025, the protests are ongoing, with further planned events nationwide and increasing scrutiny over UK asylum and housing policies.\nBackground\nAnti-migration protests began on 13 July 2025, following public outrage after an asylum seeker was arrested and charged in connection with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl in Epping, Essex. The incident intensified long-standing tensions surrounding the government's use of hotels and temporary accommodation for asylum seekers. Protesters cited concerns about public safety, lack of community consultation, the concentration of male-only facilities in residential areas, and broader dissatisfaction with migration and housing policies.\nWhile many protests originated from local resident groups, a number were later joined or organised by nationalist or right-wing groups. Supporters of the protests described their actions as a response to perceived failures in immigration enforcement and community planning, while critics warned of rising xenophobia and misinformation exacerbating tensions. The events led to a national debate about the limits of protest, freedom of speech, and the need for balanced immigration reform.\nLocations\n| zoom          = 5\n| float         = right\n| width         = 250\n| height        = 350\n| title         = Map of UK anti‑migration protest locations\n| shape1        = circle\n| shape-outline = white\n| mark-size1    = 5\n| mark-title1   = Epping (Essex)\n| mark-coord1   =\n| shape-color1  = hard blue\n| mark-title2   = Canary Wharf\n| mark-coord2   =\n| shape-color2  = hard blue\n| mark-title3   = Barbican (Islington)\n| mark-coord3   =\n| shape-color3  = hard blue\n| mark-title4  = Diss\n| mark-coord4  =\n| shape-color4 = hard blue\n| mark-title5   = Bournemouth\n| mark-coord5   =\n| shape-color5  = hard blue\n| mark-title6   = Portsmouth\n| mark-coord6   =\n| shape-color6  = hard blue\n| mark-title7   = Waterlooville\n| mark-coord7   =\n| shape-color7  = hard blue\n| mark-title8   = Liverpool\n| mark-coord8   =\n| shape-color8  = hard blue\n| mark-title9   = Leeds\n| mark-coord9   =\n| shape-color9  = hard blue\n| mark-title10  = Northern Nottinghamshire\n| mark-coord10  =\n| shape-color10 = hard blue\n| mark-title11  = Cardiff\n| mark-coord11  =\n| shape-color11 = hard blue\n| mark-title12  = Southampton\n| mark-coord12  =\n| shape-color12 = hard blue\n| mark-title13  = Clacton-on-Sea\n| mark-coord13  =\n| shape-color13 = hard blue\n| mark-title14  = Bolton\n| mark-coord14  =\n| shape-color14 = hard blue\n| mark-title15  = Yeovil\n| mark-coord15  =\n| shape-color15 = hard blue\n| mark-title16  = Dover\n| mark-coord16  =\n| shape-color16 = hard blue\n| mark-title17  = Hull\n| mark-coord17  =\n| shape-color17 = hard blue\n| mark-title18  = Aldershot\n| mark-coord18  =\n| shape-color18 = hard blue\n| mark-title19  = Manchester\n| mark-coord19  =\n| shape-color19 = hard blue\n| mark-title20  = Altrincham\n| mark-coord20  =\n| shape-color20 = hard blue\n| caption       = Click marks for protest locations up to August&nbsp;2025\n}}\nProtests took place in numerous locations across the UK, including:\n* Epping (Essex) – the site of the initial alleged assault, where protests began outside the Bell Hotel and drew national media attention.\n* London – including Canary Wharf and Islington, where asylum hotels such as the Britannia International and Thistle City Barbican became focal points for both anti-migration protests and counter-protests.\n* Norwich (Norfolk) – protests occurred at both the Brook Hotel in Bowthorpe and The Park Hotel in Diss, with arrests made during large weekend gatherings.\n* Bournemouth (Dorset) – demonstrators assembled outside The Chine Hotel in Boscombe; dispersal orders were issued due to rising tensions.\n* Portsmouth and Waterlooville (Hampshire) – major protests occurred over Home Office housing proposals, including one in Waterlooville with over 1,000 attendees.\n* Liverpool (Merseyside) – protest groups gathered near proposed accommodation sites, with some aligned to national campaigns.\n* Leeds (West Yorkshire) – demonstrations reported at migrant housing facilities; part of broader regional activism.\n* Nottinghamshire – multiple towns across the county saw coordinated protests linked to asylum site developments.\n* Cardiff (Wales) – part of the national protest network; events in Cardiff were accompanied by counter-demonstrations.\n* Southampton (Hampshire) – identified as a site of repeated protest outside hotels and public venues.\n* Clacton-on-Sea (Essex) – spontaneous gatherings and resident-led protests occurred following online mobilisation.\n* Bolton (Greater Manchester) – localised demonstrations linked to broader anti-hotel campaigns.\n* Yeovil (Somerset) – protests erupted after the announcement of a new migrant accommodation facility.\n* Dover (Kent) – symbolic protests related to Channel crossings and border enforcement.\n* Hull (East Yorkshire) – isolated demonstrations continued trends seen in previous years.\n* Aldershot – Around 200 protesters gathered outside a hotel, which was housing asylum seekers. Two men were arrested.\n* Manchester - Organised protest by Far-right group Britain First. \"March for Remigration\" — calling for mass deportations of migrants. Slogans included \"Send them back\" and \"Stop them coming in,\". The protest drew hundreds of attendees.\n* Altrincham - Protesters gathered outside of the Cresta Court Hotel in Altrincham - protesters clashed but a small police line kept the groups apart; and no arrests were made.\nThese protests were often held outside hotels, former care homes, or other buildings repurposed for temporary asylum housing. While some events remained peaceful and focused on community consultation demands, others led to clashes, arrests, or dispersal orders issued by police.\nOrganisers and Actors\nWhile many of the early anti-migration protests in 2025 were spontaneous and locally organised, often led by concerned residents or ad hoc neighbourhood groups, several were later coordinated by national-level organisations and campaign networks. One of the most prominent among these was the Great British National Protest (GBNP), a movement formed in early 2025 that describes itself as a patriotic grassroots network advocating for \"community safety, fair immigration, and British sovereignty\". The group, reportedly founded by a group of former military personnel and local campaigners, used social media platforms such as Facebook, Telegram, and TikTok to disseminate protest information, rally participants, and fundraise for logistics and legal aid.\nGBNP was instrumental in organising coordinated protest weekends across multiple towns, including Bournemouth, Norwich, and Leeds, and was frequently involved in livestreaming events and sharing viral videos of confrontations or local testimonies. While the group publicly distanced itself from any extremist ideology, several members were reported by investigative outlets to have previously supported or shared content from far-right or anti-Islam movements. Organisers denied these links and maintained that their protests were lawful, peaceful, and centred on public safety concerns regarding the housing of large numbers of asylum seekers—particularly single adult males—in hotels near schools and family neighbourhoods.\nAlongside GBP, individuals affiliated with political parties such as Reform UK and UKIP were reported to have attended some of the rallies. Although these parties did not officially endorse the protests, prominent party figures—most notably Nigel Farage—publicly voiced support for the protesters' underlying concerns. Farage, in several media interviews and online broadcasts, positioned the demonstrations as reflective of public frustration with what he described as \"a broken and secretive asylum system.\" Critics, however, argued that such political endorsements risked inflaming tensions and further legitimising inflammatory rhetoric.\nLocal law enforcement agencies and anti-extremism watchdogs noted the presence of smaller far-right organisations at some protest sites, including Patriotic Alternative and individuals with prior links to groups banned under UK anti-terror legislation. Authorities in Epping, Bournemouth, and Dover reported that some protest attendees were previously flagged for involvement in public disorder, hate speech, or online incitement. Police intelligence assessments also warned that online spaces used to organise protests were being infiltrated by agitators attempting to steer peaceful dissent toward more confrontational or disruptive tactics.\nDespite this, many protesters explicitly disavowed connections to far-right or extremist ideologies. Interviews conducted by journalists and independent observers revealed that a significant proportion of demonstrators identified as politically unaffiliated and framed their participation around issues such as local housing shortages, school overcrowding, and fears over transparency from the Home Office. In towns such as Waterlooville and Yeovil, protest organisers submitted petitions to councils and held town hall-style meetings to discuss planning concerns, distancing themselves from any rhetoric deemed xenophobic or racist.\nThe diversity of actors involved—from ordinary residents and veteran campaigners to nationalist activists and political fringe figures—has made it difficult to draw a clear line between legitimate civic action and more radical forms of mobilisation. While many communities described the protests as a \"last resort\" after feeling unheard by government agencies, critics, including anti-racism groups and Labour Party MPs, expressed concern that even well-intentioned protests could serve as a recruitment ground for more extreme movements.\nAcademic commentators have described the 2025 protests as a case study in the modern protest landscape: decentralised, social media-driven, and capable of rapid mobilisation across geography and ideology. Researchers at think tanks such as the Institute for Strategic Dialogue warned that even where protests remain peaceful, the presence of provocative actors or misinformation can quickly escalate tensions.\nUltimately, the anti-migration protest wave in 2025 reflected a convergence of local grievances, political disillusionment, and polarised narratives about national identity and immigration. While some actors sought to channel community concerns through lawful protest and dialogue, others exploited the same environment to advance more divisive or conspiratorial agendas. The resulting complexity continues to challenge police, policymakers, and public commentators alike.\nCounter-protests\nCounter-protests emerged across the United Kingdom in response to the wave of anti-migration demonstrations in 2025, particularly in urban centres and areas with a history of multicultural activism. These opposing demonstrations were led by a broad coalition of civil society organisations, political activists, trade unions, and community-based networks that sought to challenge what they described as the rise of xenophobic and fear-driven narratives in public discourse.\nOne of the most active groups involved in organising counter-protests was Stand Up To Racism (SUTR), a long-established anti-racist organisation that mobilised quickly in cities such as London, Leeds, Cardiff, and Liverpool. SUTR called for \"unity rallies\" and \"solidarity actions\" in support of migrants and asylum seekers, often held on the same day—and at times the same location—as anti-migration protests. The group was joined by several left-wing organisations, including branches of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the Socialist Workers Party, Black Lives Matter, and faith-based networks such as Citizens UK and interfaith councils.\nThe messaging from counter-protesters generally focused on solidarity with refugees, promotion of human rights, and opposition to what they characterised as \"scapegoating\" and \"dehumanisation\" of asylum seekers. Placards and chants commonly featured slogans such as \"Refugees Welcome Here\", \"Say No to Hate\", and \"Stop Far-Right Organising\". In London, counter-demonstrators gathered outside hotels targeted by protest groups, including the Thistle City Barbican and Britannia International Hotel, forming symbolic \"rings of protection\" around migrants' accommodations.\nIn several towns—such as Epping, Bournemouth, and Norwich—counter-protests were organised by local grassroots groups unaffiliated with national campaigns. These included parent-teacher associations, local councillors, and residents who viewed the anti-migration protests as unrepresentative of broader community sentiment. In some cases, churches and mosques issued joint statements calling for unity, compassion, and non-violence. Independent councillors in places like Waterlooville and Clacton-on-Sea publicly opposed far-right messaging, while also acknowledging residents' concerns about local services and transparency.\nTensions did arise at several events where anti-migration protesters and counter-protesters were in close proximity. In Canary Wharf and Islington, for example, rival demonstrators were separated by police cordons as verbal altercations escalated into scuffles. Law enforcement, particularly the Metropolitan Police and Essex Police, issued dispersal orders to prevent escalation and imposed restrictions under the Public Order Act 1986. Footage of confrontations circulated widely online, with both sides accusing the other of provocation and misinformation.\nCritics of the counter-protests—especially among some Conservative MPs and commentators in the right-leaning press—argued that these demonstrations ignored genuine local concerns, painting all opposition to government migration policy as inherently racist or extremist. They further contended that such protests risked shutting down debate and alienating citizens who had legitimate worries about housing shortages, community planning, and crime. Some commentators on GB News and TalkTV framed counter-protesters as \"radical agitators\" or \"professional activists\" disconnected from working-class realities.\nConversely, counter-protesters and their supporters argued that failing to push back against anti-migrant rhetoric would enable the normalisation of hate and discrimination. Groups like SUTR and Hope Not Hate pointed to documented instances of hate speech, far-right symbolism, and misinformation at anti-migration rallies, asserting that these were not isolated concerns but part of a broader pattern of political radicalisation. They emphasised that many asylum seekers were fleeing war, persecution, and hardship, and that the UK had a moral and legal obligation under international law to offer protection.\nPublic reaction to the counter-protests was mixed. Polling by organisations such as YouGov and Ipsos MORI in July 2025 suggested that while a majority of Britons supported tighter immigration controls, most also disapproved of violence and supported the right of asylum seekers to be treated fairly and lawfully. Among younger demographics and urban populations, support for the counter-protest message was notably higher.\nIn Parliament, members of the Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, and Green Party expressed support for the right to counter-demonstrate and condemned what they saw as the far-right exploitation of community anxieties. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper acknowledged the need to improve local consultation around asylum housing decisions but reaffirmed the government's commitment to lawful migration and opposition to hate-based rhetoric.\nViolent incidents and arrests\nWhile many of the UK's anti‑migration protests have remained peaceful, some escalated into violent confrontations involving protesters, law enforcement, and hotel security staff.\nEpping (Essex)\nOn the evening of 13 July 2025, protests began outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, after news spread that an asylum seeker housed at the hotel had been arrested and charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old local girl. By nightfall, around 100 to 150 protesters had gathered at the site, many holding placards and chanting slogans calling for the closure of the hotel. The crowd included both local residents and individuals who had travelled from outside the area, some of whom had been mobilised through online forums and social media.\nTensions escalated quickly as some demonstrators threw bottles, flares, and stones at police officers forming a protective line outside the hotel. Officers responded with crowd control measures, including the use of shields and batons, and issued several dispersal orders. Despite police warnings, the unrest continued into the early hours of 14 July. Several protesters reportedly breached the hotel’s perimeter, damaging vehicles in the car park and throwing objects at hotel staff and asylum seekers inside.\nEssex Police made six arrests on the first night, including individuals charged with violent disorder, criminal damage, and assaulting emergency workers. More arrests followed over the next 48 hours, bringing the total to at least sixteen by 15 July. Among those detained were individuals with previous convictions for violent offences, prompting police to suggest that elements of the crowd had come specifically to provoke confrontation.\nThe protests resumed the next day, albeit with a smaller turnout. A visible police presence was maintained around the hotel, including mounted units and riot officers. No significant violence occurred on the second day, though tensions remained high, and further dispersal orders were issued to prevent gatherings from reforming nearby.\nAt least eight police officers sustained injuries over the two days of unrest, and one hotel staff member was reportedly taken to hospital after being struck in the head. In response to the violence, Epping Forest District Council wrote to the Home Office requesting the removal of asylum seekers from the Bell Hotel, citing public safety and community disruption.\nLondon (Islington / Canary Wharf)\nIn early August protests at the Thistle City Barbican Hotel and Britannia International Hotel involved rival gatherings of anti-migration and counter-protest groups. Clashes led to nine arrests, mostly for public disorder. Metropolitan Police issued dispersal orders for 28 days around both sites. Video footage and eyewitness reports described tense scenes, shouting, and physical pushing, though widespread violence was avoided. Police intervened to separate groups chanting \"Britain is full\" and \"Refugees welcome.\"\nOverall, as of late July 2025, there have been at least a dozen confirmed arrests related to protest disorder. Charges span violent disorder, criminal damage, and incitement. Injured individuals include both protesters and multiple police officers treated for minor to moderate injuries. While many protests concluded without violence, pattern analysis by security agencies has flagged several demonstrations as prone to escalation, especially where misinformation or far-right agitators were active.\nThe Labour government and local authorities have consistently condemned violent behavior while respecting the right to lawful protest. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasised the duty to protect public safety and has called for clearer reporting on asylum hotel incidents. Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has used arrest figures and scenes of disorder to reinforce his message for stricter immigration controls and greater transparency on perpetrators' nationality.\nMedia and public coverage\nMedia coverage has varied across outlets, with some framing the events as community-driven backlash against poor planning and transparency, while others have emphasised the influence of far-right figures and the spread of misinformation.\nGovernment ministers condemned violent acts at protests but acknowledged community frustrations. Diana Johnson labelled violent incidents as \"unacceptable,\" and opposition figures called for greater clarity around asylum placements. Meanwhile, public figures such as Nigel Farage expressed concern over a perceived lack of transparency in migration policy and criticised the use of hotels for housing migrants.\nBy late July 2025, Channel crossings exceeded 25,000 for the year, adding pressure to ongoing debates about border control, resource allocation, and national capacity for asylum processing.\nStatus\nAs of August 2025, protests remain ongoing in multiple cities and towns. Local councils and police have implemented dispersal zones and restrictions on gatherings in certain high-risk areas. Further actions are expected as national attention remains focused on immigration and community security.\nSee also\n* 2024 United Kingdom riots\n* 2025 Northern Ireland riots\n* Immigration to the United Kingdom\nReferences"
