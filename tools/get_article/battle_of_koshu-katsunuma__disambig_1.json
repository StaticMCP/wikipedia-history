The battle followed the Battle of Toba–Fushimi on 29 March 1868 (Gregorian calendar).\nPrelude\n(From the left in the bottom row: Ban Gondayu, Itagaki Taisuke, Tani Otoi (young boy), Yamachi Motoharu.

Once back in Edo, he met with Shogunal military commander Katsu Kaishū. Kondō created a new unit based on the surviving remnants of the Shinsengumi, called the , and they departed Edo on 24 March.\nThe battle\nThe Imperial army reached the Tokugawa stronghold of Kōfu first, and occupied it with a struggle. The Imperial army then met the Shogunal forces in battle at Katsunuma (now a part of Kōshū, Yamanashi) on 29 March. Outnumbered 10:1, the Shogunal forces were defeated with 179 casualties. The survivors, including Kondō, attempted to flee to Aizu via Sagami Province, which was still controlled by Tokugawa hatamoto loyalists.\nConsequences\nKondō Isami narrowly escaped from this battle, but was captured soon after at Nagareyama, Chiba. He was beheaded by the new government at Itabashi a short time later. The Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma was the last significant military action in central Honshū during the Boshin War, and the death of Kondō Isami further demoralized Tokugawa supporters, contributing to the surrender of Edo Castle without bloodshed later that year.\nFurther reading\n*Aikawa Tsukasa and Kikuchi Akira.
