He earned one cap for the Ghana national team in 2017.\nClub career\nMalmö FF\nFollowing a promising start in Allsvenskan during 2017 Sarfo was subject to a bid from the title holders Malmö FF, where he agreed personal terms in spite of Sirius holding out for 15 million SEK or €1.5 million. Sarfo's agent stated that his client was only interested in making a move to Malmö because of him needing another year to acquire Swedish citizenship and therefore was not interested in moving abroad as well as wanting UEFA Champions League football. On 22 June 2017, Malmö FF confirmed the signing of Sarfo in a press conference. Sarfo made his debut for Malmö on the first day of the Swedish transfer window, 15 July, as his old club Sirius came to Swedbank Stadion. Sarfo scored a goal on his debut but could not help his team to a victory as the game ended 3–3. On 1 October 2017, Sarfo was suspended by the club until further notice after being declared a suspect in a police investigation. After a District Court had decided not to detain him, Sarfo continued to practice with Malmö FF until he was arrested again on 31 January 2018 under new charges. Malmö FF reacted by announcing his shut down. After his criminal conviction for multiple statutory rapes, Malmö FF terminated Sarfo's contract on 12 June 2018.\nOlympiakos Nicosia\nSarfo returned to football after a two-year absence when the Director of Football of Olympiakos Nicosia gave him a second chance. He shone in his first year at the club leading it to a top 6 finish and cup final after 30 years. His contract was improved and extended until 2023 and was made club captain.\nAPOEL\nIn January 2022 Sarfo joined APOEL on loan, and on 26 June 2022 he joined the club on a permanent transfer, signing a three-year deal. In June 2025, Sarfo left the club following the expiration of his contract, becoming a free agent.\nInternational career\nHe made his international debut for Ghana in 2017.\nLegal issues\nConviction of child rape\nOn 30 September 2017, Sarfo was requested to be arrested following accusations of one case of attempted rape, and two cases of statutory rape.  As a result of the arrest, Sarfo was suspended from playing for Malmö FF, a suspension that was lifted on 11 January 2018 awaiting the legal process to be completed. On 31 January 2018, Sarfo once again was arrested by the Swedish police, suspected of five cases of statutory rape. On 8 June 2018, he was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison, along with a fine of 150,000 SEK and deportation after having served his jail sentence.\nDriving without a valid license\nDuring 2017 Sarfo drove his car on several occasions without holding a valid driver's license in Sweden. According to Swedish law this can result in up to six months in prison. Sarfo was not disciplined by the club in any way.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|IK Sirius\n|2014\n|Superettan\n|2||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|–||colspan=\"2\"|–||5||0\n|-\n|2015\n|Superettan\n|29||5||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|–||colspan=\"2\"|–||31||5\n|-\n|2016\n|Superettan\n|29||1||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|–||colspan=\"2\"|–||33||2\n|-\n|2017\n|Allsvenskan\n|11||3||4||2||colspan=\"2\"|–||colspan=\"2\"|–||15||5\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!71!!9!!13!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|–!!colspan=\"2\"|–!!84!!12\n|-\n|Malmö FF\n|2017\n|Allsvenskan\n|8||2||1||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|–||9||3\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Olympiakos Nicosia\n|2020–21\n|Cypriot First Division\n|22||1||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|–||colspan=\"2\"|–||27||2\n|-\n|2021–22\n|Cypriot First Division\n|15||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|–||colspan=\"2\"|–||15||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!37!!1!!5!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|–!!colspan=\"2\"|–!!42!!2\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|APOEL\n|2021–22\n|Cypriot First Division\n|12||0||2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|–||14||0\n|-\n|2022–23\n|Cypriot First Division\n|31||4||4||0||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|–||40||4\n|-\n|2023–24\n|Cypriot First Division\n|27||0||0||0||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||31||1\n|-\n|2024–25\n|Cypriot First Division\n|3||1||0||0||4||0||1||1||8||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!73!!5!!6!!0!!13!!1!!1!!1!!93!!7\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!189!!17!!25!!4!!13!!1!!1!!1!!228!!24\n|}\nHonours\nIK Sirius\n* Superettan: 2016\nMalmö FF\n* Allsvenskan: 2017\nAPOEL\n*Cypriot First Division: 2023–24\n* Cypriot Super Cup: 2024\nIndividual\n* Superettan Player of the Year: 2016\n* Superettan Midfielder of the Year: 2016\n* Allsvenskan Player of the Month: April 2017\n* Cyprus Sports Writers Best XI Team: 2022\n* Pancyprian Footballers Association (PASP) Team of the Season: 2021–22\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
