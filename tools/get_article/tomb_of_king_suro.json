It is located in Gimhae, South Korea. On January 21, 1963, it was made a Historic Site of South Korea.\nIt is unknown when the tomb was constructed; Suro died in 199 (Korean calendar). There are a number of stone monuments that honor his achievements. The tomb was in good condition even into the Goryeo period (918–1392), but was reduced to ruins in the Joseon period (1392–1897). It was repaired in 1580. The tomb was robbed by the Japanese during the 1592–1598 Imjin War. Suro's descendents perform jesa here biyearly.\nSee also\n* Tomb of Queen Consort of King Suro, in Korea\n* Memorial of Heo Hwang-ok, Ayodhya, in India\n* Preah Thong and Neang Neak, similar in Cambodia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
