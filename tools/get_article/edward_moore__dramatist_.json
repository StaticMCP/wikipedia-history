He wrote the domestic tragedy of The Gamester, originally produced in 1753 with David Garrick in the leading character of Beverley the gambler. It is upon The Gamester that Moore's literary reputation rests; the play was much-produced in England and the United States in the century after Moore's death. The oft-quoted phrase \"rich beyond the dreams of avarice\" is spoken by Mrs. Beverley in the play's second act.\nAs a poet he produced clever imitations of John Gay and Thomas Gray, and with the assistance of Lord Lyttelton, Lord Chesterfield and Horace Walpole, conducted The World (1753–1757), a weekly periodical on the model of the Rambler. He collected his poems under the title of Poems, Fables and Plays in 1756.\nMoore died in Lambeth on 1 March 1757. His Dramatic Works were published in 1788.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/authors/pers00141.shtml Edward Moore] at the [http://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/ Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA)]\n*\n*\n*"
