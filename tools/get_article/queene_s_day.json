Observance of the accession was a national holiday in England and Wales for about 300 years, often with the building of enormous bonfires. It was revived in the village of Berry Pomeroy in Devon in 2005.\nCelebrations begin with evensong in St Mary's Church, Berry Pomeroy and culminate with a bonfire in the adjacent field, upon which is burned an effigy of the Devil.\nSee also\n*Accession Day tilt\nReferences"
