Former Senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum won the primary with a plurality, carrying 37.11% of the vote and all but four counties, awarding him 29 delegates.\nFormer Massachusetts Governor and eventual nominee, Mitt Romney, came second with 28.06% of the vote and 19 delegates, carrying only three counties: Davidson, Loudon, and Williamson. Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich of neighboring Georgia, came third with 23.96% of the vote and 9 delegates, carrying only the county of Marion. Representative from Texas Ron Paul received 9.04% of the vote, and all other candidates received under 1% of the vote.\nProcedure\nTennessee was given 58 delegates for the 2012 Republican National Convention. Three superdelegates were unbound. 27 delegates are awarded by congressional district, 3 delegates for each district. If a candidate wins two-thirds of the vote in a district, he takes all 3 delegates there; if not, delegates are split 2-to-1 between the top two candidates. Another 28 delegates are awarded to the candidate who wins two-thirds of the vote statewide, or allocated proportionately among candidates winning at least 20% of the vote if no one gets two-thirds.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Tennessee Republican primary, 2012\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Votes\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Percentage\n! colspan=\"3\"| Projected delegate count\n|-\n!
