It is the first Super Robot Wars (SRW) game for the 3DS and was released in Japan on March 14, 2013. The theme of this game is \"Possibilities\".\nGameplay\nGameplay of Super Robot Wars UX inherits the same gameplay from Super Robot Wars L on being a tactical RPG using animated sprites. Controls in the game depends on the use of the stylus, directional buttons and the Circle Pad, with the 3D feature used to zoom in and out of some maps. When a stage begins, the character receives introductory dialogue between playable characters, leading to the scenario on the battle field. To complete a scenario, the player must accomplish scenario objectives. Some scenarios are longer, with multi-part missions or have new objectives added as the story unfolds. On battle field, the player and enemy take turns to order their units with commands available, such as movement, attacking, forming squads and casting \"Spirit Commands\", a set of magic-like spells unique to each pilot. Once the scenario is cleared, more dialogue is exchanged between characters before the player is taken to an intermission menu. Here, units can be upgraded or optional parts installed, characters' stats and skills can be changed or upgraded, and other maintenance actions can be performed before the player continues on with the game.\nAside from the usual features, UX also features dynamic animated cutscenes in each scenario and attacks and a Partner Unit System, similar to the Twin Battle System of Super Robot Wars: Original Generations. Units can be deployed in a team of two units or a single unit depending on the situation. It also feature Skill Parts, which can be used to update and strengthen each unit.
