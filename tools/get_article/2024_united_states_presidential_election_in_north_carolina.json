North Carolina voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote. The state of North Carolina has 16 electoral votes in the Electoral College, following reapportionment due to the 2020 United States census in which the state gained a seat.\nWhile Republican presidential candidates won close victories in 2012, 2016, and 2020, even as polls indicated a narrow win by Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, at the state level, Democrat Roy Cooper won the 2016 and 2020 gubernatorial elections. Because of these results, the presidential election was expected to be competitive. Today a purple to slightly red state, North Carolina was targeted by both parties in 2024, with major news organizations marking the state as a tossup or slightly leaning towards the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, who carried the state with a margin similar to his 2016 result. Incumbent president Biden was initially poised to run for re-election but withdrew on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris.\nDespite North Carolina Republicans struggling down-ballot, especially due to controversial Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson, Trump won the state by 3.21%, keeping it in the Republican column for the fourth election cycle in a row. Trump won the state himself for the third straight election. North Carolina remains the only battleground state that Trump won all three times. With 50.9 percent of the vote, Trump won the highest percentage of the vote for any presidential candidate since 2004.\nHarris did outperform Hillary Clinton in 2016, losing by a 3.21% margin compared to Clinton's 3.66% margin of defeat. North Carolina and Georgia were the only two battleground states where Harris did better than Clinton but worse than Biden. North Carolina was also the only state that Trump won in 2016 and 2020 that did not vote for him by double digits in 2024.\nPrimary elections\nDemocratic primary\nIn North Carolina, candidates can make the primary ballot either by being nominated by the state party or by filing a nominating petition with at least 10,000 signatures. The North Carolina Democratic Party submitted only Joe Biden as a candidate, and no candidate submitted 10,000 signatures by the December 22, 2023, deadline.\nThe cancellation was criticized by the Dean Phillips campaign, who started an online petition to get his candidacy on the ballot and threatened legal challenges. Marianne Williamson and Cenk Uygur also criticized the moves.\nIn addition to the candidates on the ballot, the \"No Preference\" option appeared on the Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian Presidential Preference Primary ballots. In 2012, when President Barack Obama did not face primary opposition in North Carolina, approximately twenty percent of voters opted for the \"No Preference\" option.\nThe North Carolina Democratic presidential primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024.\nRepublican primary\nThe North Carolina Republican primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024.\nLibertarian primary\nstyle=\"text-align:left; margin:auto; width:300px;\"\n}}\nThe North Carolina Libertarian primary was held on Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Ten candidates were presented on the ballot.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable tpl-blanktable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|+ North Carolina Libertarian primary, March 5, 2024\n|-\n!

Mail-in ballots received after election day also will not be counted. There will also be more partisan poll-watchers. The laws are similar to others passed in Republican-controlled states which Democrats have criticized as voter suppression. Common Cause North Carolina and the League of Women Voters of North Carolina have been educating voters on the new rules.\nOn September 12, 2024, the Republican National Committee sued to block the use of digital IDs, popular with students at the University of North Carolina, as a form of voter ID. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order, and alleged that the digital IDs did not comply with the state's voter identification requirements and were susceptible to fraud. On September 20, 2024, Wake County Superior Court Judge Keith Gregory rejected the request for a temporary restraining order, stating that the Republican National Committee had not \"advanced any credible link between the State Board's approval of Mobile One Cards and a heightened risk of ineligible voters casting illegal votes.\"\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. was granted the status of presidential candidate in July 2024 for North Carolina after state authorities recognized the political party he founded, \"We the People,\" which allowed Kennedy to qualify using 13,757 signatures, instead of the 82,542 signatures required for a candidate with no party. The North Carolina Democratic Party filed a lawsuit alleging that Kennedy was improperly using his party to avoid higher qualification requirements, but this lawsuit against Kennedy was unsuccessful. On August 27, Kennedy asked state authorities to remove him as a presidential candidate in North Carolina; on August 28, the We the People party officially made the same request to state authorities; both requests were initially denied due to ballots already being printed and upcoming deadlines, with North Carolina law mandating that absentee ballots should be mailed by authorities from September 6.\nKennedy responded by launching a lawsuit demanding to be removed as a presidential candidate in North Carolina, with Kennedy previously saying that \"by staying on the ballot in the battleground states, I would likely hand the election over to the Democrats\", while Kennedy remained as a presidential candidate in non-battleground states and indicated that his lawsuit to become a presidential candidate in New York would continue. While Wake County Superior Court ruled against Kennedy, he appealed and the North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled for Kennedy on September 6, ordering for authorities to reprint ballots without Kennedy as a candidate. The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision on September 9, so authorities went to reprint the ballots, which delayed the mailing date from the originally stipulated September 6 date to become September 20 for military and overseas voters and September 24 for other voters.\nPredictions\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Source\n!Ranking\n!As of\n|-\n| align=left | The Cook Political Report\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Sabato's Crystal Ball\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Decision Desk HQ/The Hill\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | CNN\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | CNalysis\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | The Economist\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | 538\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Inside Elections\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | NBC News\n|\n|November 4, 2024\n|-\n|}\nPolling\nDonald Trump vs. Kamala Harris\nAggregate polls\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;line-height:17px\"\n!Source of pollaggregation\n!Datesadministered\n!Datesupdated\n! class=\"unsortable\" |KamalaHarris\n! class=\"unsortable\" |DonaldTrump\n!

However, Republicans have won every single federal statewide race in North Carolina since 2010. It flipped back into the GOP column in 2012 and has been narrowly won by Republican nominee Donald Trump in the past two cycles. This presidential election marks the first time since 2012 that the winning candidate won the election with an absolute majority of the vote.\nTrump's margin of victory was more than double that of his 2020 margin, though it was slightly less than his 2016 margin. The state had one of the smallest swings in the nation from 2020 to 2024, shifting rightward by 1.9%, smaller than all other swing states except Wisconsin (which swung by 1.5%). North Carolina was among 23 states where Harris posted a better margin than Hillary Clinton in 2016. This marked the fifth consecutive election where North Carolina was decided by less than 5%, the longest ongoing such streak out of any state. Trump became the first Republican to win the White House without carrying New Hanover County since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956. This is the first time since 2008 that the state voted for the winner of the national popular vote. Anson County voted Republican for the first time since 1972 and Pasquotank County since 1988.\nPotentially due to the effects of Hurricane Helene, Western North Carolina was one of the few areas of the country to swing towards the Democrats between 2020 and 2024. Despite over 90% of American counties shifting toward Trump during this time period, ten counties in the region bucked this trend and supported Harris to a greater extent than Joe Biden.|group=lower-alpha}}\nAlthough Harris lost the state--no Democratic presidential nominee has won it since 2008--down-ballot statewide North Carolina Democrats won many of their races in the 2024 North Carolina elections, likely helped by Harris' gains in many counties. These included the 2024 North Carolina gubernatorial election, the 2024 North Carolina lieutenant gubernatorial election, the 2024 North Carolina Attorney General election, the 2024 North Carolina Secretary of State election, Mo Green won the Superintendent of Public Instruction election, and the 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court election (which was won by just 734 votes).\nExit poll data\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"4\" |2024 presidential election in North Carolina voter demographics\n|-\n!
