The ambassador in Lima is also accredited to Bolivia.\nCzechoslovakia first established relations with Peru on July 11, 1922. In 1937, the diplomatic representation between both countries was raised to the level of Embassy, with the Czechoslovak government opening an embassy in Lima the same year.\nAfter the German occupation of Czechoslovakia—now the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia—Peru ceased to recognize Czechoslovakia as a sovereign state. However, as World War II progressed, Peru maintained relations with the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, among others, now based in London.\nAfter the war, both countries reestablished relations, which continued into the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic until October 4, 1957, when Peru, under Manuel A. Odría's government, broke relations with the state. After the 1968 Peruvian coup d'état and the establishment of Juan Velasco Alvarado's Revolutionary Government, relations were renewed in 1968 and raised to the level of embassy in 1969.\nRelations again continued into the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, and after the country ceased to exist in 1993, the Peruvian government recognized the Czech Republic and Slovakia as its successor states.\nList of representatives\nCzechoslovakia (1922–1993)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!| Diplomatic agrément\n!| Diplomatic accreditation\n!| Ambassador\n!| Notes\n!| President of Czechoslovakia\n!| President of Peru\n!| Term end\n|-\n|-\n|\n|\n|Jaroslav Netoušek\n|As ''chargé d'affaires.\n|Edvard Beneš\n|Óscar R.
