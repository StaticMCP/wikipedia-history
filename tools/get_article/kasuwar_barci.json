The postal code of Kasuwar Barci markets is 800261.  The market is a place for wholesale and retail of buying and selling in Kaduna state.\nHistory\nThe market, formerly known as Tudun Wada Market, was established as a result of Kaduna central market reconstruction in 1973 when the traders were moved to Kasuwar Barci by the Government of Kaduna state.\nKasuwar Tudun Wada traders were renamed Kasuwar Barci because other markets around that time enjoyed more patronage and the traders were always idle and sleeping. A trader named Abdullah lamented on every stall about their lack of customers and suggested calling the market Kasuwar Barci, meaning Market sleeping as people only came to sleep. This was how Kasuwar Tudun wada was renamed. The market was built with shops in 1991.\nReferences"
