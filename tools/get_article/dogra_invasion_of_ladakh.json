Also Gulabnama states that Kishtwar faced drought that year due to which Zorawar Singh invaded Ladakh to collect revenue from the Gyalpo.\nInvasion\nOn 16th August 1834, Dogra forced marched from Kishtwar and entered the Gyalpo's territory by passing the Suru river, where they met with an army of 5000 Botis under a commander named Mangal. They defeated the Botis with only six or seven casualties, while the enemies lost 40 men. The Dogra forces halted at Suru for eight days, where local zamindars submitted to them in a group and Zorawar Singh built a fort there. Dogras next advanced to Shakhar, where they defeated the Thai Sultan of the fort and imposed a tax of four rupees on each house.\nZorawar Singh left 35 men to guard the fort and marched through Langkarchu and Manji to Paskyum, where the Dogras were again opposed by the Ladakis. After a minor conflict, the commander of Ladakis fled to the fort of Sod. Mehta Basti Ram was sent to capture Sod with 500 men in which he succeeded. A whole month was wasted in negotiating with the local zamindars while more than 6000 prisoners were captured by dogras in Sod and Paskyum.\nOn hearing about the Dogra advances, Gyalpo sent Banka Kahlon, the prime minister of Ladakh, and four other chiefs: Gajapu, Dorje Namgyal, Chovang Nabdan, and Rahim Khan with 22,000 men at Mulbil. Banka Kahlon dispatched convoys, who reached the Dogra camp and agreed to their terms, and asked the Dogras to send confidential agents along with them. Mehta Basti Ram was being sent, but Gola and Nanda, along with 500 Dogra troops, were sent along the convoys which in turn was a trap laid by Banka Kahlon. Ratan Singh, a Dogra troop, escaped and reached the Dogra camp.\nZorawar Singh learned of Banka Kahlon's march towards them, so he ordered a retreat to Langkarchu where dogras planned for four months. Banka advanced to Langkarchu, the Ladakhi troops were exhausted after the long journey, so they set up their camp some miles away from Langkarchu. The Dogras attacked the Ladakhi camp with swords, where many Ladakhis were slain or fled with Banka Kahlon, 600 Ladakhis died in an avalanche and 1200 were made prisoners.\nAfter this decisive victory dogras marched to Mulbil, halted for 15 days, and moved to Lamayouro, where they met an envoy from the Gyalpo suing for peace. Zorawar invaded Ladakh just to collect tribute, so a meeting was fixed with the Gyalpo at Bazgoo. The meeting was shifted to the Namgyal capital Leh, but unfortunately, this peace talk was ruined by Gyalpo's son and both sides drew their swords. Some horseman immediately carried intelligence to the Dogra camp at Bazgoo and soon 5000 Dogras marched towards Leh. Gyalpo, on seeing such a large army, fell on his knees to Zorawar Singh and promised to pay tribute to Dogras. Gyalpo agreed to pay 50,000 rupees as war indemnity and 20,000 rupees as annual tribute.\nAftermath\nAlarmed by the advances of Dogras, Mehan Singh, the governor of Kashmir, motivated Ladakhi chiefs such as the Raja of Zanskar to revolt, but Zorawar Singh crushed it and the Raja was forced to pay a separate tribute.\nIn 1836, Mehan Singh asked the Gyalpo to revolt. Zorawar Singh again marched to Leh and crushed the revolt within ten days. Gyalpo was deposed and Ngorub Stanzin was made the vassal ruler. Again in 1838, Gyalpo was reinstalled as Ngorub revolted against Dogras.\nSee also\n* Dogra–Tibetan war\n* Dogra invasion of Baltistan\n* Battle of Ladakh\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
