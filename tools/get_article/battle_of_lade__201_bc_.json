The battle took place in 201 BC as part of the Cretan War, which lasted from 205 to 200 BC. The battle was a continuation of hostilities from the Battle of Chios (201 BC) (Mommsen, Bk III, CH VIII).\nThe battle was fought off the shore of Asia Minor and the island of Lade, near Miletus. The battle ended in a crushing victory for the Macedonians, nearly ending the war in their favour and resulting in defeat for the Rhodians; however, as a result of the battle, the Roman Republic decided to intervene, and Rhodes was saved from destruction.\nSources\n*\n*"
