Iraq failed to do so, and the coalition began an aerial bombardment against targets in Iraq and Kuwait on 17 January 1991. At this time, the coalition consisted of 42 countries and was spearheaded by the United States. The central command was led by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom; the marine command was led by the United States; the Joint Forces East Command was led by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Morocco, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Poland, and Czechoslovakia; and the Joint Forces North Command was led by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Italy, Australia, and Turkey.\nOn 23 February 1991, the aerial bombardment campaign came to an end and the coalition began a ground offensive into Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and parts of Iraq. The Iraqi military was devastated in the fighting, and Kuwait was declared completely free of the occupation on 28 February 1991.\nMember states\nArgentina\nArgentina contributed 500 troops, two corvettes, a destroyer, two cargo planes and three helicopters. The operations of Argentinian forces were codenamed Operation Alfil.\nAustralia\nAustralia contributed at least one guided missile frigate, one destroyer and one supply ship. Limited numbers of Australian troops were imbedded in British and American formations, and RAAF photo interpreters were based in Saudi Arabia. Soldiers of the Royal Australian Artillery provided air defence to the Australian supply ships, as they had none of their own.\nBahrain\nBahraini troops played a limited role in the conflict, with the Bahraini Army providing troops to the Gulf Cooperation Council contingent (exclusively embedded with Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti troops), which played a support role in the conflict. The Bahraini government also allowed their territory to be used as a logistical hub for coalition forces.\nBangladesh\nThe Bangladeshi contribution to the coalition contained about 2300 personnel. Their operation was codenamed Operation Moruprantar and involved security personnel, including two field Ambulance teams. After the war, Bangladeshi forces inspected and cleared land mines lain by the Iraqi forces. In 2015, there were still up to 5000 Bangladeshi troops stationed in Kuwait to aid with mine clearance. The Bangladeshi commander was Zubayr Siddiqui.\nBelgium\nBelgium had a limited deployment of troops and aircraft to Turkey, and several ships deployed to the gulf.\nTwo minesweepers of the Tripartite class, the Iris and the Myostis along with the Command and Logistics ship Zinnia, deployed to the gulf, and conducted mine clearing operations. The Belgian government later decided to send an additional minesweeper, the Dianthus. When the ceasefire took place, clearing operations moved to the coast off Kuwait.\nEighteen Mirage 5s of 8th Fighter Squadron and six C-130s of the 15th Air Transport Wing were deployed to Turkey as part of the NATO preventative deployment of aircraft.\nMedical personnel were attached to a British Field Hospital in Cyprus, and were also deployed in Turkey alongside 75 soldiers.\nCanada\nCanada's contribution included 4,600 personnel, and their activities were codenamed Operation Friction. Royal Canadian Navy vessels took part in the war, the Royal Canadian Air Force conducted patrols and bombing missions, and the army deployed a field hospital. Canadian aircraft and ground forces also attacked retreating Iraqi military forces along the Highway of Death.\nCzechoslovakia\nThe Czechoslovak contribution included a specialised 200-man chemical defence unit and 150 medical personnel. The lead Czechoslovak commander was Ján Való. The war was notable as the first time Czechoslovak troops had taken part in an armed conflict since the Second World War, and would be the last time before the breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1993.\nDenmark\nDenmark deployed the HDMS Olfert Fischer (a Niels Juel-class Corvette) alongside 100 personnel.\nEgypt\nEgypt contributed around 40,000 soldiers and 400 tanks. Their commander was Salah Mohammed Atia Halabi.\nFrance\nThe French contingent consisted of around 20,000 personnel led by Lieutenant General Michel Roquejeoffre, and their activities were codenamed Opération Daguet. France also contributed 14 ships, more than 75 aircraft, and 350 tanks.\nGermany\nGermany sent one fighter squadron to Turkey to show solidarity with operations in Kuwait and make its presence felt on NATO's southern flank. Restrictions on the use of NATO airbases in Germany were removed so they could be used for logistics. Germany also provided $6 billion in cash and materiel to aid the coalition.\nGreece\nGreek forces included Hellenic Air Force pilots and ground support staff and the frigate Limnos in the Red Sea. The Greek Merchant Marine Service aided the Coalition in the movement of fuel and equipment with their large fleet, and most Greek airfields were made available for US and allied use.\nHonduras\nHonduras sent 400 personnel to the join the coalition.\nHungary\nHungary contributed approximately 40 personnel, including a medical team.\nItaly\nThe Italian contribution included about 1,950 personnel; their operation mostly involved aircraft, and the air operation was known as Operazione Locusta. Italy deployed eight Panavia Tornado aircraft, which conducted sorties over the 42 days of war, and a cell of RF-104G Starfighter tactical reconnaissance aircraft, which operated from Turkey to monitor the coalition's flank. Six F-104s were stationed in Turkey. 4 ships were sent to the gulf. The Italian commander of the operation was Mario Arpino.\nJapan\nJapan contributed no personnel or equipment to the coalition force as it was prohibited from doing so by its constitution. However, the Japanese government made a financial contribution of approximately $13bn to fund Coalition operations.\nKuwait\nThe contribution of Kuwaiti forces in exile included around 9,900 personnel.\nLuxembourg\nLuxembourg provided financial support. After the war, Luxembourgish soldiers were deployed to deliver humanitarian aid to Kurdish civilians taking refuge in the mountains along the Turkish-Iraqi border.\nMorocco\nMorocco contributed around 13,000 personnel.\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand provided two Lockheed C-130 Hercules transporter aircraft and 100 personnel.\nThe Netherlands\nThe Dutch navy sent two frigates to help maintain the UN embargo on Iraq, and three minehunters to clear mines off the coast of Kuwait. The army provided a field hospital and medical team for the coalition, while the air force sent two MIM-23 Hawk squadrons and three MIM-104 Patriot squadrons – one of which was deployed in Israel to defend against Iraqi Scud missiles.\nNiger\nNiger deployed about 480 troops to guard shrines in Mecca and Medina.\nNorway\nNorway contributed 280 personnel, one naval vessel, a field hospital, and intelligence capabilities.\nTornado F3 during Operation Desert Storm]]\nOman\nOman contributed about 6,300 personnel.\nPakistan\nThe Pakistani contingent was 4,900–5,500 strong. Mirza Aslam Beg, then-Pakistani Chief of the Army Staff, endorsed the campaign against Iraq. In a briefing given to president Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Beg maintained the assessment that once the ground battle with the Iraqi Army began, the Iraqi Army would comprehensively repel and defeat the US Army. Beg accused Western countries of encouraging Iraq to invade Kuwait, but supported the armed forces fighting Iraq in support of Saudi Arabia. In 1990, he held state dinner for United States Central Command commander General Norman Schwarzkopf where, alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Iftikhar Sirohey, he briefed US commanders on Pakistani preparations and military operational capabilities. The war was a polarizing political issue in Pakistan.\nBeg predicted that popular opinion would favor Iraq, as anti-American sentiment in the Middle East was growing.\nPhilippines\nThe Philippines sent around 200 medical personnel.\nPoland\nThe Polish contribution included approximately 320 personnel and 2 warships – ORP Wodnik and ORP Piast. Poland also conducted intelligence operations, such as Operation Simoom.\nPortugal\nPortugal provided one logistics ship and two C-130 transport aircraft.\nQatar\nQatar contributed around 2,600 personnel. Qatari forces participated in the Battle of Khafji.\nRomania\nRomania deployed 363 medical personnel and 21 soldiers. As part of Britain's Operation Granby, a field hospital was deployed to al-Jubayl.\nSaudi Arabia\nAn estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Saudi troops participated in operations against Iraq, led by Khalid bin Sultan, Saleh Al-Muhaya and Sultan Al-Mutairi.\nSenegal\nSenegal contributed approximately 500 troops. 92 Senegalese soldiers were killed in a plane crash, along with six Saudi Arabian crewmen, in the deadliest single aviation accident among coalition forces.\nSingapore\nSingapore sent 30 personnel to provide medical and humanitarian services under Operation Nightingale, as well as nine military support teams.\nSouth Korea\nThe South Korean contingent consisted of 777 men, primarily focused on medical and logistical support. They were present in theater from 24 January to 10 April 1991.\nSpain\nSpain deployed 500 ground troops (mostly engineers) with another 3,000 participating in naval operations: two corvettes and one destroyer patrolled near the strait of Bab al Mandeb.\nSyria\nCoalition troops from Egypt, France, [[Oman, Syria, and Kuwait stand for review during Operation Desert Storm.]]\nSyria's contributed around 14,500 troops, led by Mustafa Tlass.\nSweden\nThe Swedish contingent numbered about 525 and included a field hospital.\nTurkey\nTurkey contributed to the air campaign against Iraq.\nUnited Arab Emirates\nThe UAE contributed one army battalion and a squadron of Mirage fighters. They also provided facilities to deploy over 255 aircraft, and gave the coalition access to practically all of their ports and shipyards.\nUnited Kingdom\nThe UK participated in Operation Granby and the Battle of Norfolk. The total British contribution included 16 ships, 58 aircraft, and 53,462 personnel, including 1st Armoured Division, 7th Armoured Brigade, 4th Armoured Brigade.
