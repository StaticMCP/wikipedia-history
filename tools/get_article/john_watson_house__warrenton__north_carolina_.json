John Watson acquired the property in the 1830s. Warson hired Jacob W. Holt in 1859 to do the overbuild on the original house. He added the two-story, Greek Revival style main block. It is overlaid with ornate Italianate style detail at the roofline and on the full-width front porch.  In 1997 the Carver family acquired the property. In 2003 the Carver family turned the house into a bed & breakfast. In 2019, the Youakim family acquired the property and uses it as a wedding venue.\nReferences"
