He played as a full-back for the Gold Coast and made 49 first-grade appearances from 1995 to 1998, missing the 1996 season when he went to England to play for the Keighley Cougars. King played for the Gold Coast Chargers  in their final ever game as a club before they were liquidated which came in round 24 of the 1998 NRL season against Cronulla with the Gold Coast club losing 20-18.\nKing featured for Manly-Warringah in 1999 and played what was to be their final ever game which occurred in round 26 of the 1999 NRL season against St. George Illawarra at Brookvale Oval. King then had two seasons at the Northern Eagles following Manly's merger. In the 2001 season he began playing as a centre.\nIn 2002 he joined South Sydney for the club's first season back in the NRL and played in their first game since readmission which was against arch-rivals the Sydney Roosters. King featured in 20 first-grade games for the South Sydney club.\nKing was retained by South Sydney in 2003 and finished his professional career in England, with the London Broncos in the Super League.\nHe is the middle of the three King brothers who played in the NRL. His elder brother Chris King played for Parramatta and his younger brother Matt King won a grand final with the Melbourne Storm which was later stripped by the NRL due to the clubs salary cap breaches.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/andrew-king/summary.html Andrew King] at Rugby League project"
