Part of the Luka-Raikovetska culture, it was a Polis-like city and one of the centers of early medieval tribe of Croats. The city's downfall and layers of burning are considered to be related to the Vladimir the Great's war with the Croats (992-993).\nSince 2015 is regionally protected as a Historic and Cultural Reserve \"Ancient Plisnesk\".\nInformation\nIn 1810, the first studies of the complex were conducted by the Vasylian Father Varlaam Kompanevych and the local official Heisler. Subsequently, archaeologists Teodor Zemencki (1881–1883), Karol Hadaczek (1905, 1907), Yaroslav Pasternak (1940), Ivan Starchuk (1946–1949), Volodymyr Honcharov (1953), Mykhailo Kuchera (1954), Roman Bahrii (1970–1972, 1983), Mykola Peleshchyshyn, and Roman Chaika (1980) joined the study of Plisnesk. Mykhailo Fylypchuk (1990, 1993, 1998–2004, 2007–2016) and Andrii Fylypchuk (2015–2022) discovered dozens of dwellings, hundreds of Christian burials, Varangian mounds, structures of defensive structures, and a pagan cult site in the Olenyn Park tract.\nMain attractions of the archaeological complex include:\n* Ancient Slavic cult center of the late 7th–10th centuries\n* Slavic site, attributed to the White Croats and White & Megali Croatia, of ancient fortified settlement 8th–10th centuries\n* Old Kievan Rus' site of ancient settlement 11th–13th centuries (chronicle Plisnesk, first mentioned in writing in 1118 in the chronicle, and then in the \"Tale of Igor's Campaign\".
