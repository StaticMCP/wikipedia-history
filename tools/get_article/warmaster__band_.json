The band's lyrical content deals with World War II.\nHistory\nWarmaster formed in 2004 by guitarist Rik van Gageldonk and drummer Andre van der Ree for an old school death metal band. In 2005 singer  Corne Bijlemeer and bass player Alex Schluter completed the band. The band members already knew each other from their previous and present bands like Asphyx, Gorefest, Thanatos, and Houwitser.
