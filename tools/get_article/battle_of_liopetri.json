British soldiers in the village of Liopetri were attacked by an EOKA team of four who were subsequently killed in the ensuing fire fight.\nThe gunmen opened fire on elements of the 1st Battalion The Royal Ulster Rifles. The British then sealed off the village, imposed a curfew and began looking for the men. They were eventually located in a barn and a gun battle ensued in which all four EOKA gunmen were killed.\nCorporal Patrick Shaughnessey was awarded a Military Medal for his actions in subduing an EOKA gunman whilst unarmed and then dragging two wounded men to safety.\nThe barn at Liopetri is now a national monument, the Akhyronas Barn Museum, and includes a bronze statue of the four EOKA men who died.\nThe battle resulted in Colonel Georgios Grivas calling an end to a truce that had been in effect since August.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.royal-irish.com/events/battle-of-the-barn-liopetri-cyprus Battle description] at Royal Irish"
