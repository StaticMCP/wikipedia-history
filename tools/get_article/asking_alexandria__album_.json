It was released on 15 December 2017 through Sumerian Records. This is their first album since the return of original lead vocalist Danny Worsnop, as well as their first album working with producers Matt Good and Jonathan Davis instead of longtime producer Joey Sturgis. It also marks the group's slight departure from their heavier metalcore roots and towards a more straight forward and melodic hard rock sound. On 27 December 2019, the deluxe version of the album titled LP5 DLX was released.\nComposition\nStyle\nThis album has been described as hard rock, metalcore, and post-hardcore, with elements of pop.\nRelease and promotion\nOn 21 September 2017, the band released the lead single \"Into the Fire\" from the album.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 73 out of 100 based on 4 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". AllMusic gave the album a positive review saying, \"Overall, Asking Alexandria is a worthy return from the classic lineup, retaining the best aspects of its past and taking steps into its future. Regardless of a stumble or two, Asking Alexandria is well worth a listen. While The Black was a passable offering at a time when it seemed like it would be a permanent arrangement, this reunion simply feels right.\"\nMichacel Hann at The Guardian stating, \"The York quintet are the model of an If-You-Like-This-Sort-of-Thing band – huge, monolithic sheets of sound, precision-tooled to get large crowds putting their hands in the air. The formula is shaken up – a furious Slipknot-esque break is put in the middle of Into the Air; 'Hopelessly Hopeful' and 'When the Lights Come On' dial down the metal and ramp up the pop – but you're never more than a couple of minutes away from some preposterous chorus. It doesn't sound like Def Leppard, but it is reminiscent of that band's willingness to smooth off metal's rough edges and boost the melodies.\" Louder Sound gave the album a positive review and stated: \"Ultimately, then, Asking Alexandria isn't a throwback or a sidestep – it's a whole new animal, and it's gonna need a bigger zoo.\"\n| title13 = Into the Fire\" (radio edit) / \"Xplicit\n| note13 = latter starts at 3:30 into the track\n| length13 = 5:40\n| writer13 = Worsnop, Bruce, Good, Cassells\n| total_length = 49:47\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from AllMusic.\nAsking Alexandria\n* Danny Worsnop – lead vocals, additional guitar\n* Ben Bruce – lead guitar, backing vocals, vocals on track 11\n* Cameron Liddell – rhythm guitar\n* Sam Bettley – bass\n* James Cassells – drums\nAdditional musicians\n* Bingx – guest vocals on track 11\n* Hyro the Hero – guest vocals on track 15\nAdditional personnel\n* Matt Good – production, engineering, keyboards, programming\n* Jonathan Davis – production\n* Will Beasley and Ryan Daminson – engineering\n* Taylor Larson – mixing\n* Ted Jensen – mastering\n* Don Sepulveda – management\n* Ash Avildsen and Nick Walters – A&R\n* Daniel McBride – artwork, layout\n* Sanjay Parikh – band photo\n* Steven Contreras – photography\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA)\n| 53\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvian Albums (LaIPA)\n| 93\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseeker Albums (RMNZ)\n| 5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
