The reviewer has \"a Bronx cheer for the nonfiction,\" however, characterizing them as a \"thumping disappointment... just anodyne scraps (the redoubtable Kim Stanley Robinson honorably excepted)\". It also notes the omission of both Bill Warren's film criticism and any obituaries, given the 1997 passings of Jerome Bixby, Judith Merrill, and George Turner. \"Maybe somebody decided that last year's opinionated and thoroughly refreshing growls and hisses Simply Wouldn't Do.\"\nThe collection was also reviewed by Gary K. Wolfe in Locus no. 459, April 1999, Clinton Lawrence in Science Fiction Weekly, Apr. 12, 1999, and John Clute in The New York Review of Science Fiction, July 1999.\nAwards\nThe anthology placed twelfth in the 2000 Locus Poll Award for Best Anthology.\nNotes"
