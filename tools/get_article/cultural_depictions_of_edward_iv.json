In Henry VI, Part 2 Edward has a minor role. He comes in toward the end of the play to defend his father's claim to the English throne, and has only one line. In Henry VI, Part 3, Edward's role is heavily amplified and he has more lines than every character in the play besides Warwick. This play depicts Edward's rise to power, his marriage to the Lady Grey (history's Elizabeth Woodville), his betrayal by Warwick, his deposition, and his subsequent return to power. The play ends with the birth of his eldest son. In Richard III, Edward, now sick, tries to reconcile his squabbling nobles and relatives to little avail. In the play and the 1955 film Richard III, Edward's brother Richard directly hastens Edward's death, by informing the already ailing king that one of his brothers, George, Duke of Clarence is dead (Edward had revoked the order for Clarence's execution, but Richard has had Clarence secretly murdered).\n*The plays King Edward IV, Part 1 and King Edward IV, Part 2, by Thomas Heywood, a contemporary of Shakespeare's.\nNovels\n(In alphabetical order, excluding 'The')\n*''The Assassin's Wife'' by Moonyeen Blakey (Describes Edward's relationship with Eleanor Butler)\n*Daughter of York by Anne Easter Smith (The fictionalized story of his sister Margaret)\n*The Founding, Volume 1 of The Morland Dynasty, a series of historical novels by author Cynthia Harrod-Eagles\n*''The Goldsmith's Wife by Jean Plaidy (A fictionalized story of his mistress Jane Shore)\n*House of Echoes by Barbara Erskine (Ghost story about a mansion that is haunted by the spirit of Edward IV among others)\n*The Innocent, The Exiled and The Beloved (released as The Uncrowned Queen) by Australian novelist, Posie Graeme-Evans\n*The Kings Grace'' by Anne Easter Smith (Fictional portrayal of Edward's illegitimate daughter Grace)\n*Kings of Albion by Julian Rathbone\n*Knight Errant, Lady Robyn, and White Rose, a trilogy by R.
