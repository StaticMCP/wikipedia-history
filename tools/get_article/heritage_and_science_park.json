It tells the story of how Phoenix residents lived before Arizona became a state. It is also home to restaurants and a museum shop.\nPreservation efforts  for Heritage Square began in the 1970s when then Mayor John D. Driggs stepped in to preserve the Rosson House. Architect Robert Frankeberger designed the park, which was designated \"Historic Heritage Park\". In 1976, preservation and restoration of the historic homes and the addition of the Lath House began, and the park opened in 1980.\nThe majority of Heritage Square was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 under the name \"Phoenix Townsite\".\nIn 1996-97 the Arizona Science Center and the Phoenix Museum of History moved next to the site of Heritage Square from their prior locations, and the expanded campus was given the name \"Heritage and Science Park\". The Arizona Doll & Toy Museum was also formerly located in the Stevens-Haustgen House. All locations are connected via East 6th Street and East Adams Street, which act as a pedestrian walkway that runs between East Monroe and North 7th Streets.\nBuildings\nHeritage and Science park includes:\n*Heritage Square (listed on NRHP as \"Phoenix Townsite\"):\n***The Rosson House Museum (1875) &ndash; 113 N. 6th St. @ N.
