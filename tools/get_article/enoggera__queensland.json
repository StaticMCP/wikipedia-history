It was intended that the name should be recorded as Euogerra, a contraction of the Turrbal phrase youara-ngarea meaning literally \"sing-play\" or song and dance. It refers to a ceremonial site used for dancing. It is said to have first applied to a site near the mouth of Breakfast Creek. It is possible, however, that the name was independently applied to a site at the place at presently known as Enoggera. They named the area near Bancroft Park \"Bu-yu-ba\", which means, \"straight shin bone\", referring to a straight stretch of creek. Enoggera is a corruption of Yowogerra, which in Turrbal means corroboree. Because this area was given a distinct name indicates that it held a significant place in Turbull culture as a camping and corroboree region.\n19th century\nIn 1845, John Brennan purchased six hectares of land in Enoggera. Six years later, Thomas Hayes moved to the area and bought thirty-three acres of land.
