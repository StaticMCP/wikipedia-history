The song was also the basis for the band's new name, with the spelling altered from \"Queensreich\" to avoid connotations with Nazi Germany.\nCritical reception\nOn 24 September 1983 reviewer of British music newspaper Music Week stated that the single before local issuance already sold heavily on import, partially due to strong support of Paul Suter from Kerrang!. The music has been described as \"basically good heavy material\".\nTrack listing\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Queen of the Reich\" opens with a text crawl somewhat similar to the Star Wars films. First, the viewer sees the words \"Tales of Queensrÿche\" zoom in before scrolling up with the rest of the text describing the backstory. It states that an evil adventurer has enslaved the world with an ancient computer energized by a crystal and declared herself \"Queen of the Reich\". The only thing standing in her way are five freedom fighters played by the band. Throughout the video, viewers get to see the band perform the song, singing and playing their respective instruments, and act out their roles as the freedom fighters in the story.\nWhen doing the latter, four of the members get captured by the Queen's minions and taken to their mistress, who proceeds to have them absorbed into her computer shrine. The fifth freedom fighter, played by Geoff Tate, rescues a woman being led by another minion and the two of them proceed to follow the direction he was taking her in order to rescue the others. As soon as they reach the Queen's lair, however, the woman reveals herself to be yet another minion and the two of them struggle as the Queen fires laser beams at Tate to take him out. Tate dodges her shots and manages to temporarily stun the Queen, giving him time to free his four comrades. After being reunited, the five freedom fighters cautiously approach the Queen and remove her visor but then they are taken aback by an unseen force and the video ends with the text, \"To be continued...\"\nCover versions\nChris Collins, the first vocalist of the progressive metal band Dream Theater, covered this song for his audition for the band.
