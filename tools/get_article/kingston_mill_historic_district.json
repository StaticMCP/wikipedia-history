It is roughly bounded by the Millstone, River, and Princeton-Kingston Roads in the townships of Princeton in Mercer County, South Brunswick in Middlesex County, and Franklin in Somerset County. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 10, 1986 for its significance in engineering, exploration/settlement, industry, and transportation. The district includes 16 contributing buildings and 2 contributing structures.\nHistory and description\nIn 1683, Henry Greenland built the first tavern here for travelers between New York City and Philadelphia. The current Kingston Mill, also known as the Kingston Gristmill, was built in 1888, the third one at this site. In 1755, Jacob Skilman built a gristmill and sawmill here on the Millstone River. The mill was burned in 1776 by the British Army during the American Revolutionary War. The district also includes the Greenland–Brinson–Gulick farm, four nearby houses, and the Kingston Bridge, an 18th-century stone arch bridge over the river.  It was one of the first settlements in Princeton, preceded only by the Quaker community along the Stony Brook.\nGallery\nFile:KINGSTON MILL HISTORIC DISTRICT, PRINCETON BOROUGH, MERCER COUNTY, NJ.jpg|The Kingston Mill (1888), built to replace one built in 1755, from the Kingston Bridge\nFile:Kingston Bridge, Kingston, NJ - south view.jpg|The Kingston Bridge (1798), built to replace one demolished by George Washington's troops to prevent British pursuit\nFile:Kingston Bridge, Kingston, NJ - milestone.jpg|The mile marker from 1798, showing the distance to Philadelphia (45 miles) and New York City (50 miles)\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Mercer County, New Jersey\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, New Jersey\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Somerset County, New Jersey\nReferences\nExternal links"
