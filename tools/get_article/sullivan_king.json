He has drawn attention from the music press for his unusual blending of EDM and electric guitar-centered heavy metal performance, \"making his live shows one of the few places where kandi-coated ravers and metalheads mingle\". King has made multiple US tours since his concert debut in 2014, most recently announcing a nationwide tour during the latter half of 2021, and has released singles collaborating with musicians including Papa Roach and drummer Matt McGuire of The Chainsmokers.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Show Some Teeth\n|\n*Released: October 18, 2019\n*Label: Kannibalen Records\n*Format: Digital\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Loud\n|\n*Released: June 25, 2021\n*Label: Hopeless Records\n*Format: Digital\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Thrones of Blood\n|\n*Released: March 17, 2023\n*Label: Monstercat\n*Format: Digital\n|}\nExtended plays\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| House of Wolves\n|\n*Released: September 19, 2017\n*Label: Kannibalen Records\n*Formats: Digital\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Vantablack\n|\n*Released: November 3, 2017\n*Label: Monstercat\n*Formats: Digital\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Come One, Come All\n|\n*Released: April 27, 2018\n*Label: Kannibalen Records\n*Formats: Digital\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| The Demented\n|\n*Released: January 18, 2019\n*Label: Kannibalen Records\n*Formats: Digital\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| To the Grave\n|\n*Released: January 27, 2021\n*Label: Subsidia Records\n*Formats: Digital\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Chaos Will Bring Peace\n|\n*Released: January 24, 2025\n*Label: Monstercat\n*Formats: Digital\n|}\nSingles\n* \"Pure Evil\" (with Jauz) (2014)\n* \"Kill it with Fire\" (with Ghastly) (2014)\n* \"Terminus\" (2014)\n* \"112 Ounces of Pounding\" (2014)\n* \"Toro!\" (with Goshfather & Jinco) (2014)\n* \"Breathe\" (with Twiich featuring Amber Noel) (2015)\n* \"Psycho\" (2015)\n* \"Finest Hour\" (2015)\n* \"Till We Die\" (with Kayzo) (2015)\n* \"Follow Me\" (with Jinco) (2016)\n* \"Cardboard Castles\" (with Nightowls) (2016)\n* \"F*ck It\" (with Riot Ten) (2016)\n* \"Hit The Floor\" (with Riot Ten) (2017)\n* \"We In Here\" (with Nightowls featuring Dan Rudd) (2017)\n* \"Lockdown\" (with Matt McGuire featuring Sam King) (2017)\n* \"House Of Wolves EP\" (2017)\n* \"Vantablack\" (with Dirtyphonics) (Vantablack EP) (2017)\n* \"Body Bag\" (with Riot Ten) (2017)\n* \"Welcome to the Fire\" (with SLANDER) (2017)\n* \"Pit Boss\" (with Riot Ten featuring DJ Paul) (2018)\n* \"Dropkick\" (Come One, Come All EP) (2018)\n* \"Step Back\" (Come One, Come All EP) (2018)\n* \"I'll Fight Back\" (2018)\n* \"Go Down\" (with Yookie) (2018)\n* \"The Demented EP\" (2019)\n* \"Save the World\" (2019)\n* \"Between the Lines\" (with Kai Wachi) (2019)\n* \"Crazy as You\" (with Grabbitz) (2019)\n* \"Bad Times\" (Show Some Teeth) (2019)\n* \"Reckless\" (Show Some Teeth) (2019)\n* \"Breathless\" (Show Some Teeth) (2019)\n* \"Show Some Teeth\" (with Kompany) (Show Some Teeth) (2019)\n* \"Ricochet\" (featuring Cayte Lee) (Show Some Teeth) (2019)\n* \"Don't Forget Me\" (with Wooli) (2020)\n* \"Flatline\" (with Kai Wachi and GG Magree) (2020)\n* \"Drum Mag\" (To The Grave EP) (2020)\n* \"Lifeless\" (To The Grave EP) (2020)\n* \"Tinnitus\" (with Benda) (To The Grave EP) (2020)\n* \"Someone Else\" (Thrones of Blood) (2020)\n* \"Unbound\" (with Excision) (To The Grave EP) (2021)\n* \"Domination\" (with Kayzo and Papa Roach) (2021)\n* \"Take Flight\" (with Subtronics) (2021)\n* \"Sleep\" (with Calcium) (2022)\n* \"The Dead March\" (with Ray Volpe) (Thrones of Blood) (2022)\n* \"Let Me Go\" (with Wooli) (Thrones of Blood) (2022)\n* \"Thrones of Blood\" (Thrones of Blood) (2023)\n* \"Fall Apart\" (with Excision) (Thrones of Blood) (2023)\n* \"Pursuit of Violence\" (with Svdden Death) (Thrones of Blood) (2023)\n* \"Bass To The Dome\" (with Excision) (2023)\n* \"You Can't Break Me\" (with Adventure Club featuring Atreyu) (2023)\n* \"Codename: Reckless\" (with Excision) (2024)\n* \"Blame\" (2024)\n* \"The Death of Peace of Mind\" (2024)\n* \"The Beginning\" (Chaos Will Bring Peace) (2024)\n* \"Slaughter\" (with Vastive) (Chaos Will Bring Peace) (2024)\n* \"Never Come Back\" (with Kompany and DIESEL) (Chaos Will Bring Peace) (2024)\n* \"Lean Onto Me\" (with NGHTMRE featuring Grabbitz) (Chaos Will Bring Peace) (2024)\n* \"SWEAT!\" (with Kayzo) (Chaos Will Bring Peace) (2024)\n* \"MF Mosh Pit\" (with Timmy Trumpet & Und3rsound) (2024)\n* \"On & On\" (2025)\n* \"Adrenaline\" (with Excision featuring From Ashes to New) (2025)\nAs featured artist\n* \"Break it Down\" (JayKode featuring Sullivan King) (2017)\n* \"Wicked\" (Bear Grillz featuring Sullivan King) (2018)\n* \"Shake the Ground\" (Kill the Noise and Snails featuring Sullivan King and Jonah Kay) (2018)\nNotes\nReferences"
