At the start of the First World War Germany had 132 such ships, and ordered a further 216 during the conflict, 112 of which were actually completed. Of these, 55 were lost during the war, 50 were interned on 23 November 1918 under the terms of the Armistice, and subsequently scuttled at Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919. Of the survivors, 32 were included in the post-war Germany navy (some surviving to see service as auxiliaries in the Second World War), 36 were surrendered to Allied powers in 1920, and the remainder were scrapped in 1921.\nDesignation\nOfficially they were called \"large torpedo-boats\" (Große Torpedoboote) or \"ocean-going torpedo-boats\" (Hochseetorpedoboote), they were in many ways the equivalent of the contemporary destroyers in other navies (and were often referred to as such by their crews). The Imperial German Navy also had a number of vessels officially designated  \"destroyers\" (Zerstörer), but numbered sequentially in the same series as the torpedo-boats. These were, primarily, vessels under construction for foreign navies and taken over at the outbreak of the First World War.\nBackground\nThe first German Naval Law of 1898 legislated the construction of an ocean-going battle fleet by Imperial Germany. To accompany the squadrons of battleships and cruisers, the law called for the construction of flotillas of considerably larger, better armed and more seaworthy than the previous torpedo boats built by Germany.\nAlthough they were initially given numbers in the same series as the smaller torpedo-boats, they were separated in 1911, with the large torpedo boats numbered from SMS V1, and the older vessels re-numbered with a 'T-'prefix. During the next 20 years a total of 336 such vessels were ordered for the German navy; these vessels are listed in this article.\nGeneral remarks\nPrograms\nThe German Navy's strength during the years prior to the outbreak of the First World War was mandated by a series of acts of the Reichstag, which prescribed the numbers of ships constituting the fleet, as well as age at which these ships should be replaced.\nThe original 1898 Naval Law called for a force 19 Battleships (in two battle squadrons), 8 Armored Coastal Defense Vessels (forming a third battle squadron), 12 large and 30 small cruisers, supported by six flotillas of Ocean-going torpedo boats (two flotillas each for the three battle squadrons). Each flotilla consisted of 12 vessels, or 72 in total. Admiral Tirpitz, the originator of this law, called for these vessels to be large enough to cope with rough seas, but small enough to be commanded by a single officer (due to the man-power constraints of the German Navy at that time).\nThe 1900 Naval Law, which provided for a major expansion of the German Navy (in reaction to the growing antipathy towards Great Britain provoked by the outbreak of the Boer War) expanded the torpedo-boat force to 144 vessels, half in commission, half in reserve with 60% nucleus crews. From 1898 until 1905, torpedo boats were ordered at a rate of 6 per year.\nThe total number of torpedo boats remained the same under the 1906 Law, although the number in commission increased to 99, with 45 in material reserve. Older vessels were to be replaced after 12 years of service, so that the annual rate of construction increased to 12 vessels in 1906 and subsequent years.\nFollowing the outbreak of war in August 1914, 48 new vessels of the latest design were quickly ordered. This was augmented in the following weeks by seizures of vessels and machinery under manufacture in Germany for foreign powers, resulting in the addition of 4 small and 12 extra-large torpedo boats (the later group officially being designated destroyers). More orders were placed in 1916 and later years, although the deteriorating war situation of Germany meant that only a portion of these vessels were ever completed.\nDesignations and builders\nAs was common with other naval powers, the Germany Admiralty gave broad specifications for the vessels they ordered but allowed shipbuilders considerable latitude in the detail designs, with the result that there were various minor differences between vessels, even between vessels ordered in the same year. German torpedo-boats were not given names, but were numbered in a sequential series, with an initial letter to denote the builder:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|Letter\n|Builder\n|Number of vessels\n|-\n!B\n| Blohm & Voss, Hamburg\n|\n|-\n!G\n| Germaniawerft, Kiel\n|\n|-\n!H\n| Howaldtswerke, Kiel\n|\n|-\n!S\n| Schichau-Werke, Elbing and Danzig\n|\n|-\n!V\n| AG Vulcan, Stettin and Hamburg\n|\n|-\n!Ww\n| Wilhelmshaven Imperial Shipyard\n| .}}\n|-\n|}\nComparison with foreign vessels\nGermany's main naval adversary of this period was Great Britain. Generally speaking, German large torpedo-boats tended to be slightly smaller than contemporary British destroyers, with lighter gun armament but heavier torpedo armament. Germany favored a well-deck forward of the bridge, mounting torpedo tubes, with a short fo'c'sle mounting a single gun; the freeboard was kept small in order to reduce the silhouette (so that the vessel would be more difficult for an adversary to spot); these features made fighting in rough weather difficult, and in later designs the well-deck was deleted and the fo'c'sle extended. Germany was slower than Britain in adopting new propulsion technologies such as steam turbines, oil fuel and geared turbines.\nType 1898\n1898 Program\n* length:  water-line,  over-all; beam: ; draft:  deep load\n* Displacement: 310 tons normal, 394 tons full\n* Machinery: triple expansion engines driving two propellers, 5900 HP (4.4 MW);

none completed). None had been launched by the time of the armistice, after which all contracts were cancelled.\nJun 1918 Program\nH 194-H 202, V 203-V 210 and S 211-S 223 (30 vessels in total, none completed). None of these proceeded further than a very preliminary stage of construction; all were cancelled after the armistice.\nTactical organization\nAs an indication of the employment of the Imperial German Navy's large torpedo boats, the following provide skeleton orders of battle for these vessels at various dates during the First World War. The basic tactical unit was the Torpedo-Boat Flotilla, consisting of two half-flotillas (typically five vessels each) plus one vessel for the flotilla commander.\nMid-October 1914\nThis list shows the dispositions early in the war, after mobilization was complete\nHigh Seas Fleet\nI.
