It acts as the parliamentarian arm of the Last Generation movement, which is considered left-wing and supports environmentalist policies in general.\nHistory\nOn February 7, 2024, the Last Generation announced that it would participate in the European elections in June of the same year and began collecting donations and the necessary 4,000 signatures. On March 29, the Federal Electoral Committee approved the nomination.\nIn the European elections, the Last Generation received 0.26% of the vote and failed to win a single seat.\nIdeology and Platform\n]]\nThe Last Generation demands that the EU phases out oil, gas and coal by 2030, funded by new taxes for the \"rich and super-rich\". The EU is also to make reparations to former European colonies. The party also calls for greater acceptance of asylum seekers, as well as further social justice.\nElection results\nEuropean Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Election\n!List leader\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/–\n!EP Group\n|-\n!2024\n|Lina Johnsen\n|104,340\n|0.26 (#21)\n|}}\n|New\n|–\n|}\nSee also\n* Last Generation (climate movement)\n* Just Stop Oil\n* Burning Pink\nReferences"
