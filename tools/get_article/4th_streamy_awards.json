The awards were held on September 7, 2014 at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. They were hosted by the YouTube stars Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart. To reflect the industry as it had evolved since 2009, 10 new award categories were added, including multiple awards honoring the short-form video hosting website Vine, a new category to honor traditional TV media engaging in online content, and categories reflecting recent YouTube trends. The event also honored the American comedian Joan Rivers whose funeral had been earlier in the day and who many of the attendees had previously met on her web chat series In Bed With Joan, including Jenna Marbles, Tyler Oakley, and Grace Helbig, which was praised as a heartfelt moment of the show. The show was received well in media publications and generated a high level of social media interest, although it did receive criticism for the influence of sponsors at the event.\nPerformers\nThe 4th Annual Streamy Awards featured the musical performances of the following artists:\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Performers at the 4th Streamy Awards\n! scope=\"col\" |Artist(s)\n!Song(s)\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Pentatonix\n|\"Problem\"\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" |Scott Bradlee & Postmodern Jukebox\n|Covers of Top 40 hits\n|-\n|Jhené Aiko\n|\"The Pressure\"\n|-\n|Starship\n|\"We Built This City\"\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\"\n|}\nWinners and nominees\n, winner of Entertainer of the Year and a Streamy Icon Award for his LGBT activism]]\n, winner of Viner of the Year]]\n, winner of the Dance category]]\n, winner of the Beauty category]]\n, winners of the Gaming category]]\n, winner of First Person category]]\n, winner of the Science and Education category]]\n, winner of Actress in a Comedy]]\n, winner of Actor in a Drama]]\nand Barack Obama won the Collaboration category for an episode of Galifianakis' show Between Two Ferns]]\n, winner in the Musical Artist category]]\n, winner of the Fashion category]]\n, winner of the Food and Cuisine category]]\n[[File:ObamaYouTubers307 (cropped).png|thumb|The Public Service award went to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT77xhri9KQ YouTube Stars Talk Health Care at the White House] (external link)]]\nwon a Streamy Icon Award for her beauty content]]\nwon a Streamy Icon Award for his YouTube channel SHAYTARDS and for work with Maker Studios ]]\nwon a Streamy Icon Award for embracing online media]]\nThe awards featured fan-voted submissions for the first time with the highest voted submission for each award category automatically being made one of the nominees.

Similarly, Liz Shannon Miller writing for IndieWire stated that the show felt professional. She also felt that \"the most entertaining moments were off-the-cuff, organic and honest, including irreverently name-checking the sponsors and ignoring the teleprompter.\" Evan DeSimone of NewMediaRockstars said of the show \"As usual, the night featured a bunch of hilarious off-script moments and a few technical mishaps but nothing could derail the excitement of online video's biggest night.\"\nVotta as well as Mikey Glazer writing for TheWrap singled out Mamrie Hart's toast in dedication of Joan Rivers for praise with Votta describing it as \"the evening's most somber moment\" and Glazer describing it as \"an authentic and intimate salute\" and a high point of the night. Votta and Glazer also both positively viewed the ending performance of the night by Starship. Michael Andor Brodeur of The Boston Globe praised Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart in their role as hosts of the show, saying that they \"did charmingly ironic impressions of award-show hosts, peppering their opening routine with product placements, feigning a musical number, and hacking the usual crowd roasting\".\nKatie Buenneke, writing for the LA Weekly, criticized the amount of corporate influence on the show, contrasting the nature of YouTube as a platform for independent content creators with the \"multiple shout-outs to Coca-Cola, conspicuous integration of Samsung phones, and, most insidiously, the influence of producers like Endemol, Maker Studio and Fullscreen\" at the show. However, she also noted \"the night was filled with a sense of excitement about being part of a new way of connecting with audiences.\"\nThe show received a high level of social media engagement compared to leading non-sports televised shows such as Big Brother and Utopia, according to data from Nielsen and Sysomos.\nSee also\n*List of Streamy Award winners\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.streamys.org Streamy Awards website]"
