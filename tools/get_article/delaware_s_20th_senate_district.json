It has been represented by Republican Gerald Hocker, the current Senate Minority Leader, since 2012.\nGeography\nDistrict 20 is based in southeastern Sussex County along the Atlantic Ocean, including the communities of Millsboro, Selbyville, Ocean View, Bethany Beach, Dagsboro, Frankford, Fenwick Island, Millville, South Bethany, Roxana, and Oak Orchard. It borders the state of Maryland.\nLike all districts in the state, the 20th Senate district is located entirely within Delaware's at-large congressional district. It overlaps with the 37th, 38th, and 41st districts of the Delaware House of Representatives.\nRecent election results\nDelaware Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms. Under normal circumstances, the 20th district holds elections in presidential years, except immediately after redistricting, when all seats are up for election regardless of usual cycle.\n2020\n}}\n2016\n2012\nFederal and statewide results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"60\" | Office\n! width=\"180\" | Results\n|-\n| 2020\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Trump 57.8 – 41.2%\n|-\n| 2016\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Trump 62.2 – 34.6%\n|-\n| 2014\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Wade 58.0 – 40.6%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2012\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Romney 58.4 – 40.5%\n|-\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Carper 50.8 – 42.9%\n|-\n| Governor\n| align=\"right\"  | Markell 55.7 – 42.2%\n|}\nReferences"
