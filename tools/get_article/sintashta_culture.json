The culture is named after the Sintashta archaeological site, in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia, and spreads through Orenburg Oblast, Bashkortostan, and Northern Kazakhstan. Widely regarded as the origin of the Indo-Iranian languages, Sintashta culture is thought to represent an eastward migration of peoples from the Corded Ware culture.\nThe earliest known chariots have been found in Sintashta burials, and the culture is considered a strong candidate for the origin of the technology, which spread throughout the Old World and played an important role in ancient warfare. Sintashta settlements are also remarkable for the intensity of copper mining and bronze metallurgy carried out there, which is unusual for a steppe culture. Among the main features of the Sintashta culture are high levels of militarism and extensive fortified settlements, of which 23 are known.\nOrigin\nand Poltavka culture|261x261px]]\nBecause of the difficulty of identifying the remains of Sintashta sites beneath those of later settlements, the culture was only distinguished in the 1990s from the Andronovo culture.\nIt was then recognised as a distinct entity, forming part of the \"Andronovo horizon\". Koryakova (1998) concluded from their archaeological findings that the Sintashta culture originated from the interaction of the two precursors Poltavka culture and Abashevo culture.  concluded from their genetic results that the Sintashta culture should have emerged from an eastward migration of peoples from the Corded Ware culture. In addition, Narasimhan et al. (2019) cautiously cite that \"morphological data has been interpreted as suggesting that both Fedorovka and Alakul' skeletons are similar to Sintashta groups, which in turn may reflect admixture of Neolithic forest HGs and steppe pastoralists, descendants of the Catacomb and Poltavka cultures\".\nSintashta emerged during a period of climatic change that saw the already arid Kazakh steppe region become even colder and drier. The marshy lowlands around the Ural and upper Tobol rivers, previously favoured as winter refuges, became increasingly important for survival. Under these pressures both Poltavka and Abashevo herders settled permanently in river valley strongholds, eschewing more defensible hill-top locations.\nIts immediate predecessor in the Ural-Tobol steppe was the Poltavka culture, an offshoot of the cattle-herding Yamnaya horizon that moved east into the region between 2800 and 2600 BCE. Several Sintashta towns were built over older Poltavka settlements or close to Poltavka cemeteries, and Poltavka motifs are common on Sintashta pottery.\nSintashta material culture also shows the influence of the late Abashevo culture, derived from the Fatyanovo–Balanovo culture, a collection of Corded Ware settlements in the forest steppe zone north of the Sintashta region that were also predominantly pastoralist.\nChronology\nRadiocarbon dating indicates that the Sintashta culture dates to between  2200 and 1750 BCE,–1770 BCE.\"}} roughly contemporary with the associated Abashevo and Petrovka cultures. Some authors date the Petrovka culture slightly later, from .\nIn Cis-Urals, burial sites Berezovaya and Tanabergen II showed Sintashta culture established there  (68.2% probability), and the earliest values of this culture, in Trans-Urals, at the burial sites Sintashta II and Kamenny Ambar-5 (Kurgan 2) are .\nChariots appear in southern Trans-Urals region in middle and late phases of the culture, -1750 BC. According to Chechuskov & Epimakhov (2018) \"chariot technology likely developed before the year 2000 BC in the Sintashta homeland, which is the Don–Volga interfluve.\"\nBlöcher et al. (2023) consider Sintashta-Petrovka period came to an end in Trans-Urals .\nSociety\n]]\nSintashta settlements are estimated to have a population of between 200 and 700 individuals with economies that \"heavily exploited domesticated cattle, sheep, and goats alongside horses with occasional hunting of wild fauna\".\nLinguistic identity\nAnthony (2007) assumes that probably the people of the Sintashta culture spoke \"Common Indo-Iranian\". This identification is based primarily on similarities between sections of the Rigveda, a religious text which includes ancient Indo-Iranian hymns recorded in Vedic Sanskrit, and the funerary rituals of the Sintashta culture as revealed by archaeology. Some cultural similarities to the Sintashta culture have also been found in the Nordic Bronze Age of Scandinavia.\nThere is linguistic evidence of interaction between Finno-Ugric and Indo-Iranian languages, showing influences from the Indo-Iranians into the Finno-Ugric culture.\nFrom the Sintashta culture the Indo-Iranian followed the migrations of the Indo-Iranians to Anatolia, the Iranian plateau and the Indian subcontintinent. From the 9th century BCE onward, Iranian languages also migrated westward with the Scythians back to the Pontic steppe where the Proto-Indo-Europeans came from.\nWarfare\nand Sintashta settlement ground plans]]\nThe preceding Abashevo culture was already marked by endemic intertribal warfare; intensified by ecological stress and competition for resources in the Sintashta period. This drove the construction of fortifications on an unprecedented scale and innovations in military technique such as the invention of the war chariot. Increased competition between tribal groups may also explain the extravagant sacrifices seen in Sintashta burials, as rivals sought to outdo one another in acts of conspicuous consumption analogous to the North American potlatch tradition.\nSintashta artefact types such as spearheads, trilobed arrowheads, chisels, and large shaft-hole axes were taken east. Many Sintashta graves are furnished with weapons, although the composite bow associated later with chariotry does not appear. Higher-status grave goods include chariots, as well as axes, mace-heads, spearheads, and cheek-pieces. Sintashta sites have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; there is no indication that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. Arrowheads are also found, made of stone or bone rather than metal. These arrows are short, 50–70&nbsp;cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short.\nSintashta culture, and the chariot, are also strongly associated with the ancestors of modern domestic horses, the DOM2 population. DOM2 horses originated from the Western Eurasia steppes, especially the lower Volga-Don, but not in Anatolia, during the late fourth and early third millennia BCE, after which the single horse lineage would become the ancestor of nearly all modern horses, due to genes showing selection for easier domestication and stronger backs.\nMetal production\nThe Sintashta economy came to revolve around copper metallurgy. Copper ores from nearby mines (such as Vorovskaya Yama) were taken to Sintashta settlements to be processed into copper and arsenical bronze. This occurred on an industrial scale: all the excavated buildings at the Sintashta sites of Sintashta, Arkaim and Ustye contained the remains of smelting ovens and slag. Around 10% of graves, mostly adult male, contained artefacts related to bronze metallurgy (molds, ceramic nozzles, ore and slag remains, metal bars and drops). However, these metal-production related grave goods rarely co-occur with higher-status grave goods. This likely means that those who engaged in metal production were not at the top of the social-hierarchy, even though being buried at a cemetery evidences some sort of higher status.\nMuch of Sintashta metal was destined for export to the cities of the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) in Central Asia. The metal trade between Sintashta and the BMAC for the first time connected the steppe region to the ancient urban civilisations of the Near East: the empires and city-states of modern Iran and Mesopotamia provided a large market for metals. These trade routes later became the vehicle through which horses, chariots and ultimately Indo-Iranian-speaking people entered the Near East from the steppe.\nGallery\nFile:Укрепленное поселение Аркаим.

Lisakovsk Museum of History and Culture.jpg|Reconstruction of jewellery from the Sintashta culture\nPhysical type\nPhysical remains of people of the Sintashta culture have revealed that they were Caucasoids/Europoids with dolichocephalic skulls. They were powerfully built. Sintashta culture skulls are very similar to those of the culturally related Abashevo culture, Fatyanovo–Balanovo, Srubnaya culture and Andronovo culture. Skulls of the Yamnaya culture and their direct descendants on the southern steppe are less dolichocephalic.\nGenetics\nfrom the Pontic steppes spread Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry and Indo-European languages across large parts of Eurasia.]]\n( EHG), Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer ( CHG), Anatolian Neolithic () and Western Hunter Gatherer ( WHG) ancestry.]]\nanalysed the remains of four individuals ascribed to the Sintastha culture. One male carried Y-haplogroup R1a and mt-J1c1b1a, while the other carried Y-R1a1a1b and mt-J2b1a2a. The two females carried U2e1e and U2e1h respectively. The study found a close autosomal genetic relationship between peoples of Corded Ware culture and Sintashta culture, which \"suggests similar genetic sources of the two,\" and may imply that \"the Sintashta derives directly from an eastward migration of Corded Ware peoples.\" Sintashta individuals and Corded Ware individuals both had a relatively higher ancestry proportion derived from Central Europe, and both differed markedly in such ancestry from the population of the Yamnaya Culture and most individuals of the Poltavka Culture that preceded Sintashta in the same geographic region.}} Individuals from the Bell Beaker culture, the Únětice culture and contemporary Scandinavian cultures were also found to be closely genetically related to Corded Ware. A particularly high lactose tolerance was found among Corded Ware and the closely related Nordic Bronze Age. In addition, the study found samples from the Sintashta culture to be closely genetically related to the succeeding Andronovo culture.\n, –200 BCE. Saka populations combined West Eurasian Sintashta, BMAC and East Eurasian Baikal EBA ancestry.]]\nanalysed the remains of several individuals associated with the Sintashta culture. mtDNA was extracted from two females buried at the Petrovka settlement. They were found to be carrying subclades of U2 and U5. The remains of fifty individuals from the fortified Sintastha settlement cemetery of Kamennyi Ambar-5 was analysed. This was the largest sample of ancient DNA ever sampled from a single site. The Y-DNA from thirty males was extracted. Eighteen carried R1a and various subclades of it (particularly subclades of R1a-Z417): R1a-Z645 (4 individuals), R1a-Z93 (1), R1a-Z94 (1), R1a-Z2124 (4), R1a-Z2125 (1), R1a-FT287785 (1), R1a-Z2123 (1), and R1a-Y874* (1); five carried subclades of R1b (particularly subclades of R1b1a1a), two carried Q1a and a subclade of it, one carried I2a1a1a, and four carried unspecified R1 clades. The majority of mtDNA samples belonged to various subclades of U, while W, J, T, H and K also occurred. A Sintashta male buried at Samara was found to be carrying R1b1a1a2 and J1c1b1a. The authors of the study found the majority of Sintashta people (ca. 80%) to be closely genetically related to the people of the Corded Ware culture, the Srubnaya culture, the Potapovka culture, and the Andronovo culture. These were found to harbour mixed ancestry from the Yamnaya culture and peoples of the Central European Middle Neolithic, like the Globular Amphora culture. The remaining sampled Sintashta individuals belonged to various ancestral types different from the majority population, with affinities to earlier populations such as Eneolithic samples collected at Khvalynsk and hunter-gatherers from Tyumen Oblast in western Siberia. This indicates that the Sintashta settlement of Kamennyi Ambar was a cosmopolitan site that united a genetically heterogenous population in a single social group.\nLazaridis et al. (2022), analysed the remains of thirteen individuals ascribed to the Sintashta culture. Of the specimens yielding a pigmentation phenotype, 69.2% were predicted as brown eyed and 30.8% blue eyed; while 61.5% were predicted as brown haired and 38.5% as blond. 92.3% and 7.7% of the samples had intermediate and pale skin tone, respectively.\nChildebayeva et al. (2024) confirmed that the Sintashta culture and its population derived from an eastwards movement of Corded Ware-, and Fatyanovo-associated groups. These Sintashta-like (Western Steppe Herders or \"Steppe_MLBA\") groups displayed close genetic links to modern Northern Europeans, particularly Norwegians, Belarusians, Lithuanians, Scots and Icelanders.\nTurkic expansion (2nd-3rd century CE)\nancestry (ANA, ), as well as Chinese Yellow River (YR_NLA, ) and Sintashta (for West Eurasian‐related, ) ancestry.]]\nA 2023 study suggested that modelled Sintashta-like ancestry is a major component of modern-day Turkic populations, especially in the western part of the Eurasian continental mass. Historically, the Iranic‐speaking groups of the Central Steppes were progressively replaced by Turkic‐speaking populations from around the 2nd-3rd centuries CE.\nMost modern Turkic populations are a combination of an original Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry (ANA), best represented by Empress Ashina, with the later addition of Sintashta-like ancestry, and marginally with a generally small amount of Chinese Yellow River ancestry. In the westernmost Turkic populations, ancestry is also exclusively derived from the Sintashta component, suggesting a significant part of the Turkic character of these populations is the result of cultural rather than demic diffusion.\nHorse genetics\nThe dispersal of the DOM2 genetic lineage, believed to be the ancestor of all modern domesticated horses, is linked with the populations which preceded the Sintashta culture and their expansions. Genetic studies suggest that these horses were selectively bred for desired traits including docility, stress tolerance, endurance running, and higher weight-carrying thresholds.\nSee also\n.|}}\n* Country of Towns\n* Multi-cordoned ware culture\n* Cimmerians\n* Karasuk culture\n* Gandhara culture\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*Vasil'ev, I.
