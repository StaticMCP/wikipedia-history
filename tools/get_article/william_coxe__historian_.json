He wrote numerous historical works and travel chronicles. Ordained a deacon in 1771, he served as a rector and then archdeacon of Bemerton near Salisbury from 1786 until his death.\nBiography\nWilliam Coxe was born on  in Dover Street, Piccadilly, London, the eldest son of William Coxe (c. 17101760), a physician to the king's household, and his wife, Martha, daughter of Paul D'Aranda. He was the older brother of the writer and poet Peter Coxe (c. 1753–1844), who wrote the poem \"Social Day\". Following his father's death in 1760, his mother married John Christopher Smith, who was Handel's amanuensis.\nEducated at Marylebone Grammar School (1753–54) and then at Eton College (1754–64), Coxe matriculated to King's College, Cambridge at Easter 1765. He received his BA in 1769, and his MA in 1772. From 1768 to 1771, he was a fellow of King's College. Coxe was ordained a deacon in London on 21 December 1771 and a priest on 15 March 1772.\nCoxe travelled throughout Europe as a tutor and travelling companion to various noblemen and gentlemen, including Lord Herbert, son of the Earl of Pembroke; and Samuel Whitbread of the brewing family. He wrote prodigious and detailed accounts of his travels with Lord Herbert around the Swiss and French Alps, which were subsequently published.\nIn 1786 he was appointed vicar of Kingston upon Thames, and in 1788 rector of Fugglestone St Peter-with-Bemerton, Wiltshire. He also held the rectory of Stourton, Wiltshire from 1801 to 1811 and that of Fovant from 1811 until his death. In 1791 he was made prebendary of Salisbury, and in 1804 Archdeacon of Wilts until his death twenty-four years later at age 80. He died on 8 June 1828 in Bemerton, and was buried in the chancel of St Peter's Church at Fugglestone St Peter. His library was sold from the rectory at Bemerton by London bookseller R. H. Evans, on 11 August 1828 (and four following days). A priced copy of the catalogue, containing many of Coxe's works, is at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.132(13)).\nIn 1803, Coxe married Eleanora, daughter of William Shairp, consul-general for Russia, and widow of Thomas Yeldham of St Petersburg.\nCoxe's literary style featured a detached, unemotional, objective voice that, though typical of the historiography of his day, came to be seen as arch and quaint by later generations.\nWorks\nIn addition to his travel writing, during his long residence at Bemerton Coxe was mainly occupied in literary work.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL646604A/Coxe_William William Coxe] at the Open Library\n* [http://www2.unil.ch/viatimages/#/ouvrage-219 Travels in Switzerland by William Coxe]  at Viatimages\n* [https://www.wdl.org/en/item/18544/#contributors=Pinkerton%2C+John%2C+1758-1826 Travels in Switzerland by William Coxe]  at wdl.org"
