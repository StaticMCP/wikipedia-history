He played for Cracovia and the Poland national team.\nBiography\nBorn on 13 October 1919 in Kraków, Jabłoński was one of the few players who participated in games of the national team both before and after World War II. He died on 17 November 1970, also in Kraków.\nJabłoński played as a right midfield for Cracovia in the seasons 1938–39 and, after the war, in 1948–1950. In 1948, when Cracovia became the champion of Poland, he was the captain of the team.\nAltogether, he took part in three international friendlies, scoring one goal, Poland's first since the end of the war. He made his debut on 27 August 1939 in Warsaw in a 4–2 win over Hungary. During the war, he did not play officially, as the German occupiers banned Poles from practising any kind of sports. His last game with the national team took place on 19 July 1947 in Warsaw, a 1–2 loss to Romania.\nHonours\nCracovia\n* Ekstraklasa: 1948\nSee also\n*The last game: 27 August 1939, Poland – Hungary 4–2\nReferences"
