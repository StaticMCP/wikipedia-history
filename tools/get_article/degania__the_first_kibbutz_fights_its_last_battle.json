It follows the emotional and heated debates leading up to the fateful day in March 2007 when kibbutzniks voted on the proposal to privatize their community.\nReception\nRubin's documentary, which was shown at a number of kibbutzim, stimulated profound discussion. Former Knesset member Ran Cohen said that \"the film represents both [the] dream and [the] disillusionment\" that was the kibbutz experiment.\nOne Israeli reviewer, Meir Shnitzer, wrote that Rubin's film \"is an important document. It is profound testimony highlighting the myth of privatization as every day the stock exchanges around the world expose the bluff. This is an overview of the process through which traditional values in Israeli society are crumbling away.\"\nSee also\n* Israeli cinema\nReferences"
