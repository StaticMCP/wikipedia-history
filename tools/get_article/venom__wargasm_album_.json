The album includes a collaboration with Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. It was announced alongside the release of the single \"Do It So Good\". The album is produced by Charlie Russell, with additional production by Wargasm and Kieron Pepper.\nBackground\nThe duo announced in July 2023 that they had spent the \"last 16 months [...] perfecting\" the album during downtime from touring.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = Clash\n| rev1score = 7/10\n| rev2 = Dork\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Kerrang!\n| rev3score = 4/5\n| rev4 = The Line of Best Fit\n| rev4score = 8/10\n| rev5 = Metal Hammer\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = NME\n| rev6score =\n}}\nVenom received a score of 81 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on four critics' reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nMetal Hammers Merlin Alderslade wrote that \"bashing together elements of punk, metal, EDM and hip hop [...] Venom is a relentlessly entertaining ride, driven by sheer energy\", calling it \"one of 2023's essential debut albums\".\nAli Shutler of Dork called the album \"pure, screaming catharsis\" as well as the band \"the spiritual successor to Limp Bizkit\", summarising that it \"build[s] on everything that's come before, while amping up the carnage, the energy and the emotion, Wargasm's debut album is a lesson in excess\".\nNMEs Rishi Shah called it \"a consistent album [...] with a significantly raw feel\" that \"cements Wargasm's position as one of UK heavy music's leading forces\".\nLana Williams of The Line of Best Fit described it as \"a rip-roaring effort from Wargasm\", also finding that \"where it stands apart from typical Wargasm-feats is in its objectively quieter, more indulgent breaks\" as on \"Death Rattle\" and \"Ride the Thunder\".\nReviewing the album for Clash, Caitlin Chatterton felt that \"despite the odd lapse in power, Venom is a super-charged and dramatic record characteristic of Wargasm’s spirit\".\nEmma Wilkes of Kerrang! concluded that it is \"a satisfying, feisty record made for blasting loud enough to annoy the neighbours, and for partying the existential dread away. This band's not cooling down anytime soon.\"\nTrack listing\n| length1 = 0:57\n| title2 = Venom\n| writer2 =\n| length2 = 3:35\n| title3 = Minigun\n| writer3 =\n| length3 = 2:20\n| title4 = Death Rattle\n| writer4 =\n| length4 = 3:12\n| title5 = Ride the Thunder\n| writer5 =\n| length5 = 3:01\n| title6 = Do It So Good\n| writer6 =\n| length6 = 3:22\n| title7 = Bang Ya Head\n| note7 = featuring Fred Durst\n| writer7 =\n| length7 = 3:36\n| title8 = Feral\n| writer8 =\n| length8 = 3:16\n| title9 = Sonic Dog Tag\n| writer9 =\n| length9 = 4:26\n| title10 = Modern Love\n| writer10 =\n| length10 = 3:28\n| title11 = S.A.D.\n| writer11 =\n| length11 = 3:30\n| title12 = Outrage\n| writer12 =\n| length12 = 3:28\n| title13 = Sombre Goodbye\n| writer13 =\n| length13 = 2:19\n| total_length = 40:30\n}}\nPersonnel\nWargasm\n* Sam Matlock – vocals, guitar, programming, additional production (all tracks); drums (track 4)\n* Milkie Way – vocals, bass guitar, programming, additional production; drums (track 4)\nAdditional contributors\n* Charlie Russell – production, mixing, engineering, recording, keyboards, programming\n* Kieron Pepper – additional production, keyboards, programming\n* Chris Allgood – mastering\n* Emily Lazar – mastering\n* Pieter Rietkerk – recording\n* Adam Breeze – drums (tracks 1–3, 5–9, 11–13)\n* Jonny Solway – immersive mix engineering (track 6)\n* Fred Durst – vocals (track 7)\n* Zach Jones – additional production (track 7)\n* Ben Havok – guitar (track 10)\n* Michael Taylor – programming (track 10)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Chart performance for Venom\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
