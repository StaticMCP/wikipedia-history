The film marked the debuts of Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor. It was the last film appearance of both Zohra Sehgal and Begum Para before their deaths. Co-produced by Sony Pictures Entertainment, it is the first Indian film to receive a North American release by a Hollywood studio and is one of the first Indian films to be released on Blu-ray Disc.\nSaawariya was released on 9 November 2007, and emerged as a commercial disaster. It received mixed-to-negative reviews upon release, with praise towards its soundtrack, production design, grand artistic approach and performances of the cast; however criticism towards its story, screenplay and pacing.\nAt the 53rd Filmfare Awards, Saawariya received 6 nominations, including Best Supporting Actress (Rani Mukerji) and Best Music Director (Monty Sharma), and won Best Male Debut (Ranbir Kapoor) and Best Male Playback Singer (Shaan for \"Jab Se Tere Naina\").\nPlot\nThe story is narrated by Gulabji, a prostitute who frequents RK Bar, the town's most luxurious club. The bar's lead singer, Raj, whom she affectionately calls \"Saawariya\" (\"beloved\"), is a free-spirited and kindhearted man. Despite knowing what Gulab does, Raj is friendly to her, and unlike other men, is kind to the other prostitutes, trying to brighten their sad lives. When he tells Gulab that he needs a job and somewhere to stay, she tells him that there is only one woman who'll give him a place to stay: Lillian – but she allows only those she likes.\nRaj meets Lillian and they have an emotional conversation, during which Lillian reveals she had a son who left her many years ago to join the army and never returned. She lets Raj stay with her because he reminds her of her long-lost son. That night, Raj meets a mysterious girl. He tries to talk to her, but under the wrong impression, she shouts at him to go away. Raj tells her that he will, on the condition that he would escort her to safety, lest someone with bad intentions trouble her. As predicted by Raj, a drunkard begins following her and Raj saves her from him. After that, she allows him to escort her home. Raj discovers her name is Sakina and falls in love with her.\nRaj decides to confess his feelings to Sakina. He resigns from his job to meet her and calls her but she ignores him. He gets angry with her but the pair reconcile. He takes her to his favourite place, on the top of the clock tower. There, Sakina reveals that she is in love with a man named Imaan. Imaan had left but promised to return for Sakina on Eid. It has been a while but she is still waiting for him faithfully. Hearing this, Raj becomes heartbroken and does not confess. However, he refuses to believe that there is an Imaan. He asks Gulab for advice, who advises him to tell Sakina how he feels. With the entire neighbourhood cheering him on, Raj decides to propose to Sakina on the night of Eid.\nHe takes Sakina to RK Bar and sings his favourite song for her: \"Saawariya\". Sakina remembers that it is time to meet Imaan and leaves. Following her, Raj tells her that he has discovered that there is no Imaan. Sakina tells him to let her go. Hurt, Raj goes to Gulab, saying he wants to sleep with her. Gulab, who loves Raj, is deeply hurt and gets Raj thrown out onto the street, where he is beaten up by a few of Gulab's henchmen. He returns to where Sakina is waiting. Imaan has still not arrived. Sakina, heartbroken, becomes sure that Imaan will not come back so she decides to be with Raj. Raj tries to make Sakina happy and succeeds. When they are returning home, they pass the bridge where they first met and see Imaan waiting for Sakina. Sakina hesitates as she steps toward Raj. Raj however tells her to go with happiness and Sakina reunites with Imaan. Imaan asks her if she is willing to accept a sad life with him to which she says yes and they both walk away together.\nThe movie ends with Raj walking away while reminiscing about the sweet moments he spent with Sakina in a style similar to Raj Kapoor from the film Shree 420 (1955).\nCast\n* Ranbir Kapoor as Ranbir Raj Malhotra\n* Sonam Kapoor as Sakina Khan\n* Rani Mukerji as Gulabji\n* Salman Khan as Imaan Pirzada\n* Zohra Sehgal as Lillian \"Lillipop\"\n* Begum Para as Nabila/Badi Ammi\n* Vibha Chibber as Naseeban\n* Atheya Chaudhri as Jhumri Aapa\n* Kenny Desai as Mr. D' Costa\nProduction\nBhansali initially wanted Rani Mukerji and Salman Khan's extended guest appearances to be hidden from the public, but later announced that they would appear in the film in supporting roles.\nElaborate sets for the film's imaginary city, complete with lakes, streets, shops, signages and a clock tower, were designed by the production designer Omung Kumar, who had previously worked with Bhansali on Black (2005).\nThe first official teaser of the film was accessed by New York Times on 25 August 2007.

Jaspreet Pandohar of BBC rated the film 2 out of 5 writing, \"It's a clear case of self-indulgence and theatrical style over substance; with the director paying little attention to fleshing out the skeletal screenplay, preferring instead to focus on coaxing 'good-looking' performances from his young muses.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\"| Filmfare Awards\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 16 February 2008\n| Best Supporting Actress\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|-\n| Best Male Debut\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Female Debut\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Music Director\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Lyricist\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Male Playback Singer\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\"| International Indian Film Academy Awards\n| rowspan=\"6\" |6–8 June 2008\n| Best Supporting Actress\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"6\" |\n|-\n| Best Male Debut\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Music Director\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Lyricist\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Male Playback Singer\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Female Playback Singer\n|  – (\"Thode Badmash\")\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"8\"| Producers Guild Film Awards\n| rowspan=\"8\"| 30 March 2008\n| Best Male Debut\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"8\"|\n|-\n| Best Music Director\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Best Lyricist\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n|  – (\"Yun Shabnami\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Male Playback Singer\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Art Direction\n| ,\n|\n|-\n| Best Choreography\n|  &  – (\"Yun Shabnami\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound Recording\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"8\"| Screen Awards\n| rowspan=\"8\"| 10 January 2008\n| Best Male Debut\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"8\"|\n|-\n| Best Female Debut\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Music Director\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Lyricist\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Male Playback Singer\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Cinematography\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Art Direction\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Choreography\n|  &  – (\"Yun Shabnami\")\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"8\"| Stardust Awards\n| rowspan=\"8\"| 25 January 2008\n| Dream Director\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"8\"|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actress\n|\n|\n|-\n| Superstar of Tomorrow – Male\n|\n|\n|-\n| Superstar of Tomorrow – Female\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Standout Performance by a Music Director\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| Standout Performance by a Lyricist\n|  – (\"Yun Shabnami\")\n|\n|-\n| New Musical Sensation – Male\n|  – (\"Saawariya\")\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| Zee Cine Awards\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 26 April 2008\n| Best Male Debut\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n| Best Female Debut\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Lyricist\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n| Best Male Playback Singer\n|  – (\"Jab Se Tere Naina\")\n|\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
