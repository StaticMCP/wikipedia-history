The Dian buried their dead in vertical pit graves. The Dian language was likely one of the Tibeto-Burman languages. The Han Empire's annexation of the Dian kingdom in 109 BCE eventually led to the establishment of the Yizhou commandery. Dian culture started from at least the 8th century BCE, until it fell under the control of the Han dynasty in 109 BCE.\nHistory\nDian was an ancient kingdom situated in modern Yunnan, southwestern China, in the region around the Dian Lake. According to Han historian, Sima Qian, it was established in 279 BCE when King Qingxiang of Chu sent a military force to the southwest. Zhuang Qiao, a general of Chu, reached the Dian Lake as part of the Chu military campaign. When the Chu homeland was invaded by the Qin, Zhuang Qiao decided to stay in Yunnan and adopt the native ways, establishing the Dian kingdom. The Qin dynasty was subsequently overthrown by the Han, and the commanderies of the new dynasty, Ba and Shu, bordered Dian.\nAccording to the Shiji, the southwest was dominated by barbarians, among whom the ruler of Yelang was the most powerful. To the west of Yelang were the Mimo and the most powerful among them was the ruler of Dian. North of Dian was Qiongdu. All these people styled their hair in a mallet-shaped fashion. These were settled peoples who worked the fields and lived in settlements.\nIn the area from Tongshi east to Yeyu were the Sui and Kunming tribes who braided their hair and moved from place to place with their herds. They had no fixed abodes or rulers. Northeast of the Sui were the Xi and Zuodu. The most powerful of the Zuodu were the Ran and Mang, who lived west of Shu. Some of them moved from place and place but others lived in fixed abodes. Northeast of the Ran and Mang were the Baima, who belonged to the Di tribe.\n|Shiji}}\nIn 135 BCE, the Han envoy Tang Meng brought gifts to Duotong, the king of Yelang, which bordered Dian, and convinced him to submit to the Han. The Jianwei Commandery was established in the region. In 122 BCE, Emperor Wu dispatched four groups of envoys to the southwest in search of a route to Daxia in Central Asia. One group was welcomed by the king of Dian but none of them were able to make it any further as they were blocked in the north by the Sui and Kunming tribes of the Erhai region and in the south by the Di and Zuo tribes. However they learned that further west there was a kingdom called Dianyue where the people rode elephants and traded with the merchants from Shu in secret.\nIn 111 BCE, Emperor Wu of Han ordered the barbarian tribes of Jianwei Commandery to raise troops for the campaign against Nanyue. Fearing that neighboring tribes would attack them in the absence of their men, the tribe of Julan rebelled against the Han and killed the governor of Jianwei Commandery. After Nanyue was defeated, Han forces turned north and subjugated the various tribes of Yelang, Julan, Toulan, Qiong, Zuo, Ran, and Mang.\nThe Dian kingdom was annexed by the Han under the reign of Emperor Wu of Han in 109 BCE and the Yizhou commandery established. The Dian King willingly received the Chinese invasion in the hopes of assistance against rival tribes. It was at this time he received his seal from the Chinese, and became a tributary.\nEmperor Wu sent Wang Ranyu to persuade the king of Dian to submit, pointing out that many of the neighboring tribes had already been defeated. The king of Dian was initially reluctant to accept the offer for he still possessed some 30,000 troops as well as the allegiance of the nearby Laojin and Mimo tribes. However, in 109 BCE, Han troops from Ba and Shu wiped out the Laojin and Mimo, leading the king of Dian to surrender. While Dian became Yizhou Commandery, the king was allowed to continue his rule until a rebellion during the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han. The Han proceeded with colonization and conquered the people of Kunming in 86 and 82 BCE, reaching all the way to what is now modern day Myanmar.\nRoyal burials\nThe Dian buried their kings at Shizhaishan, which was uncovered in 1954 near Shizhai Village in Jinning County, Yunnan. The burials were identified by the inscription ''King Dian's Seal''. The inscription was written in seal script on a gold imperial seal of investiture given by the Han Emperor. Sima Qian noted that the Dian were one of only two local groups to have received an imperial seal, the other being Yelang. Both have survived: the Yelang Seal emerged in 2007 from a Hmong man in Guizhou, claiming to be the Yelang King's 75th generation descendant. The Dian Kingdom's elite used elements of the Chu state's aristocratic mortuary practices.\nCulture\nBronze working\n, Western Han period]]\nThe largest tin deposits on the Eurasian continent are located on the Malay peninsula, and as such, the Dian people were sophisticated metal workers, casting both bronze and iron. The Dian cast bronze objects using both the piece mould method and the lost wax method. Dian elite burials contained an impressive array of bronze objects, although late Dian burials also contained locally cast iron objects.\nLarge bronze drums were employed by the Dian to communicate in battle; ritual burials of Dian elites were accompanied by large bronze drums filled with cowrie shells. The tops of the drums were removed and replaced by a bronze lid.\nDian weapon types and decorative motifs had some commonalities with Chu.\nSaka influences\n) }}||Map of the Sakas.png}}\nIaroslav Lebedynsky and Victor H. Mair speculate that some Sakas may also have migrated to the area of Yunnan in southern China following their expulsion by the Yuezhi in the 2nd century BCE. Excavations of the prehistoric art of the Dian civilization of Yunnan have revealed hunting scenes similar to that of Indo-European artwork depicting horsemen in Central Asian clothing. Horsemen practicing hunting are depicted in circular arrangement on top of drums, a design often encountered in Scythian art. Animal scenes of felines attacking oxen are also at times reminiscent of Scythian art both in theme and in composition. These objects reflect the influence of steppe art.\nFile:鎏金掳掠铜扣饰.jpg|The ox is featured heavily in Dian artwork. This bronze belt buckle for example shows Dian armoured warriors around an ox and its calves.\nFile:战争场面贮贝器盖.jpg|Dian bronze lid depicting a horseman in battle\nFile:Kunming Oct 2007 031.jpg|Dian vessel depicting a horseman surrounded by four oxen being hunted by tigers\nDepiction of Dian society\nThe bronze lids were covered with miniature figurines and structures, depicting various scenes from the life of the Dian people. The bronze lids depicted the Dian people engaged in everyday activities such as hunting, farming and weaving. Other scenes depicted the leisurely pursuits of the Dian people, such as bullfighting, dancing and music-making. The Dian people dressed in tunics over short pants and wore their hair in topknots. The bronze lids corroborated Sima Qian's description of the Dian hairstyle.\nMany scenes depicted the Dian at war, often riding horses. Archaeological evidence shows that horses had been domesticated by the Dian people as early as the sixth century BCE. The bronze lids also depicted the Dian decapitating their enemies (who wore their hair in long plaits).\nThe kingdom was based on agriculture, the bronzes also showed head hunting, human sacrifice, and slaves as part of Dian society.\nFile:Bronze house Dian Kingdom.Yúnnán Provincial Museum.jpg|Dian bronze model of a house\nFile:三支俑铜灯.jpg|Dian lamp in the shape of a servant\nFile:三支俑铜灯 头部.jpg|Face of a Dian person\nFile:Figure with parasol (bronze, Western Han) - Yunnan Provincial Museum - DSC02253.JPG|Dian servant with a parasol\nFile:Dian woman 246 BCE 8 CE.jpg|Dian woman\nFile:四人舞铜俑.jpg|Dian female musicians and dancers\nFile:杀人祭鼓铜贮贝器 祭鼓场面.jpg|Dian bronze lid depicting a human sacrifice\nUnderwater ruins\nArchaeologists recently discovered the inundated remains of Dian-period buildings and pottery fragments under Fuxian Lake and were able to verify their age with carbon dating.\nOther artifacts\nAt Dabona, a site connected with the Dian culture, archaeologists discovered a large double coffin burial; The outer coffin was made of wood and the inner coffin was made of bronze. The inner coffin was shaped like a house and weighs over 157&nbsp;kg.\nThe Yunnan Provincial Museum holds many archaeological relics of the Dian culture.\nGallery\nFile:Dian-bronze-sword-jiangcheng.jpg|Bronze sword with a head-hunting theme from the Dian culture of ancient Yunnan (circa 100 BCE) unearthed at Jiancheng and displayed at Yunnan Provincial Museum, Guandu, Kunming, 2016.\nFile:King of Dian gold seal.png|Seal of the kingdom of Dian\nFile:Clothes ornaments-MA 6836-IMG 9478-black.jpg|Dian people tending an ox\nFile:四人一牛銅啄 局部.jpg|Dian people with an ox\nFile:Clothes ornaments-MA 6589-IMG 9476-gradient.jpg|Bronze sculpture of the Dian kingdom (felines attacking an ox), 3rd century BCE, Yunnan, China.\nFile:Gu wine cup (bronze, Western Han) - Yunnan Provincial Museum - DSC02226.JPG|Dian wine cup\nFile:云雷鸟兽纹铜棺 左后方摄.jpg|Dian bronze coffin in the shape of house\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Stark, Miriam T.
