It was part of the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries.\nThe Republican caucuses were held on \"Republican Party Precinct Caucus Day\" (February 7, 2012). Caucus locations opened on 9 PM, February 7, 2012, with 36 delegates at stake; 33 of which are tied to the caucuses while 3 are unpledged RNC delegates. The event occurred alongside the Minnesota Republican caucuses as well the Missouri Republican primary. The race was widely expected to be won by Mitt Romney even on the day of the caucus, but a strong surge by Rick Santorum across all three races that day carried him to a close victory. However, the delegates were not legally bound to follow voter preferences, and most voted for Romney.\nBackground\nThe Colorado legislature adopted the caucus system in a special session called by Governor John F. Shafroth in August 1910 as part of a package of progressive reforms. It was seen as a way to limit the power of party bosses and to attract more grassroots involvement. The caucus system was abolished in favor of presidential primaries in 1992 but restored in 2002 with the defeat of Amendment 29 and cost considerations. The fully restored Colorado Caucus was in 2004.\nOf the candidates in the 2008 Colorado Republican presidential caucuses, two candidates - Mitt Romney and Ron Paul - would return to contest the state once again 2012. In 2008, these candidates had won 60.11% and 8.42% of the vote respectively.\nPolling\nPolling in 2010 and 2011 showed mixed results, with Mitt Romney, Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich being the favoured candidate depending on the poll. Polls leading up to election day showed Romney as the frontrunner.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:180px;\" |Poll source\n! style=\"width:135px;\" |Date\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |1st\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |2nd\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |3rd\n!Other\n|-\n|- style=\"background:Moccasin;\"\n|Caucus results\nTurnout: 66,091\n|Feb. 7, 2012\n|Rick Santorum 40.3%\n|Mitt Romney\n34.9%\n|Newt Gingrich\n12.8%\n|Ron Paul 11.8%, Rick Perry 0.1%, Jon Huntsman 0.1%, Michele Bachmann 0.0%, Others 0.1%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ±3.2%\nSample size: 938\n|Feb. 4–6, 2012\n|  |Mitt Romney37%\n|Rick Santorum\n27%\n|Newt Gingrich\n21%\n|Ron Paul 13%, Someone else/Not sure 2%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ±4.3%\nSample size: 527\n|Feb. 4, 2012\n|  |Mitt Romney40%\n|Rick Santorum\n26%\n|Newt Gingrich\n18%\n|Ron Paul 12%, Someone else/Not sure 3%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ±4.4%\nSample size: 500\n|Dec. 1–4, 2011\n|  |Newt Gingrich37%\n|Mitt Romney\n18%\n|Michele Bachmann\n9%\n|Ron Paul 6%, Rick Perry 4%, Rick Santorum 4%, Jon Huntsman 3%, Gary Johnson 1%, Undecided 16%\n|-\n|Project New West/Keating Research\nMargin of error: ±7.2%\nSample size: –\n|Sep. 19–22, 2011\n|  |Mitt Romney24%\n|  |Rick Perry20%\n|Michele Bachmann\n7%\n|Newt Gingrich 7%, Herman Cain 5%, undecided 19%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ±5.5%\nSample size: 314\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Aug. 4–7, 2011\n|  |Rick Perry20%\n|  |Mitt Romney20%\n|Michele Bachmann\n12%\n|Sarah Palin 11%, Ron Paul 8%, Herman Cain 7%, Newt Gingrich 6%, Tim Pawlenty 3%, Jon Huntsman 2%, someone else/undecided 11%\n|-\n|  |Mitt Romney22%\n|  |Rick Perry21%\n|Michele Bachmann\n15%\n|Newt Gingrich 9%, Ron Paul 7%, Tim Pawlenty 6%, Herman Cain 5%, Jon Huntsman 2%, someone else/undecided 13%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ±4.9%\nSample size: 400\n|Feb. 4–6, 2011\n|  |Mitt Romney19%\n|  |Mike Huckabee16%\n|  |Sarah Palin16%\n|Newt Gingrich 12%, Ron Paul 9%, Tim Pawlenty 7%, John Thune 4%, Mitch Daniels 3%, someone else/undecided 16%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ±5.3%\nSample size: 341\n|Oct. 30–31, 2010\n|  |Mitt Romney22%\n|  |Newt Gingrich17%\n|  |Sarah Palin17%\n|Mike Huckabee 14%, Tim Pawlenty 6%, Mike Pence 3%, John Thune 2%, Mitch Daniels 1%, someone else/undecided 18%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ±4.6%\nSample size: 448\n|May 14–16, 2010\n|  |Sarah Palin29%\n|  |Mitt Romney25%\n|Mike Huckabee\n18%\n|Newt Gingrich 16%, Ron Paul 9%, undecided 3%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ±4.4%\nSample size: 497\n|Mar. 5–8, 2010\n|  |Mitt Romney44%\n|Sarah Palin\n25%\n|Mike Huckabee\n17%\n|Undecided 14%\n|}\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Colorado Republican caucus, February 7, 2012\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Candidate\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Votes\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Percentage\n! colspan=\"2\" |Projected delegate count\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Convention Results\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\"\n!MSNBC\n!GP\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\" |Rick Santorum\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |26,614\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |40.31%\n|6\n|6\n|6\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |Mitt Romney\n|23,012\n|34.85%\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |13\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |14\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |13\n|-\n|Newt Gingrich\n|8,445\n|12.79%\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Ron Paul\n|7,759\n|11.75%\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"\n|Rick Perry\n|52\n|0.08%\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"\n|Jon Huntsman\n|46\n|0.07%\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"\n|Michele Bachmann\n|28\n|0.04%\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Others\n|71\n|0.11%\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Unprojected delegates:\n|14\n|0\n|0\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Unpledged delegates:\n|0\n|16\n|17\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n|Totals:\n|66,027\n|100.00%\n|36\n|36\n|36\n|}\n{|\n|-\n|Key: || align:\"center\" bgcolor=DDDDDD| Withdrewprior to contest\n|}\nConventions\nThere is no formal system of allocating delegates to candidates in any step of the election process. At each meeting the participants decides what the best course of action is.None of the 36 delegates are legally bound to vote for a candidate.\n* 12–13 April: Seven congressional conventions elects 3 National Convention delegates each and also elects delegates for the state convention.\n* 14 April: State convention elects 12 National Convention delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"11\" |Convention Results\n|-\n!Candidate\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!State\n!Party leaders\n!Total\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" align=\"left\" |Uncommitted\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |2\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |2\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |2\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |2\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|4\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |3\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |17\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Mitt Romney\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|1\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |2\n|1\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |8\n|0\n|13\n|-\n| align=\"left\" |Rick Santorum\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n| bgcolor=\"pink\" |2\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|6\n|-\n|Total\n| colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\" |21\n| align=\"right\" |12\n| align=\"right\" |3\n| align=\"right\" |36\n|}\nAnalysis\nThe Colorado caucuses were held on the same day as elections in Minnesota and Missouri. All three contests broke for Santorum. This was seen as undermining Romney's status as frontrunner.\nReferences"
