His major work was an eight-volume History of England during the Eighteenth Century.\nEarly life\nBorn at Newtown Park, Stillorgan, Dublin, he was the eldest son of John Hartpole Lecky, a landowner.\nHe was educated at Kingstown, Armagh, at Cheltenham College, and at Trinity College Dublin, where he graduated with a BA in 1859 and MA in 1863, and where he studied divinity with a view to becoming a priest in the Church of Ireland.\nCareer\npublished in Vanity Fair in 1882.|left]]In 1860, Lecky published anonymously a small book entitled The Religious Tendencies of the Age, but on leaving college he turned to historiography. In 1861, he published Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland, containing brief sketches of Jonathan Swift, Henry Flood, Henry Grattan and Daniel O'Connell, originally anonymous, republished in 1871; the essay on Swift, rewritten and amplified, appeared again in 1897 as an introduction to an edition of Swift's works. Two surveys followed: A History of the Rise and Influence of Rationalism in Europe (2 vols., 1865), and A History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne (2 vols., 1869). The latter aroused criticism, with its opening dissertation on \"the natural history of morals.\" Lecky's History of European Morals was one of Mark Twain's favorite books, and influenced the writing of ''A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.\nLecky then concentrated on his major work, A History of England during the Eighteenth Century, Vols. i. and ii. of which appeared in 1878, Vols. v. and vi in 1887, and Vols. vii. and viii., which completed the work, in 1890. In the \"cabinet\" edition of 1892, in 12 volumes (later reprinted), A History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century is separated out.\nA volume of Poems (1891) was less successful. In 1896, he published two volumes entitled Democracy and Liberty, in which he considered modern democracy. The pessimistic conclusions at which he arrived provoked criticism in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America, which was renewed when he published in a new edition (1899) his low estimate of William Ewart Gladstone, then recently dead.\n, National Portrait Gallery London]]\nIn The Map of Life (1899) Lecky discussed in a popular style ethical problems of everyday life. In 1903, he published a revised and enlarged edition of Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland'', in two volumes, with the essay on Swift omitted and that on O'Connell expanded into a complete biography. A critic of the methods by which the Act of Union was passed, Lecky, who grew up as a moderate Liberal, was opposed to Gladstone's policy of Home Rule, and in 1895, he was returned to parliament as a Liberal Unionist member for Dublin University in a by-election. In 1897, he was made a privy councillor. In the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, he was nominated an original member of the new Order of Merit (OM), and he was invested as such by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.\nDegrees\n|left]]\nHis university honours included the degree of LL.D. from Dublin, St Andrews and Glasgow, the degree of D.C.L. from Oxford and the degree of Litt.D. from Cambridge. In 1894, he was elected corresponding member of the Institute of France. He contributed occasionally to periodical literature, and two of his addresses, The Political Value of History (1892) and The Empire, its Value and its Growth (1893), were published.\nFamily and posthumous recognition\nAfter his father died when Lecky was 14, he was raised as a member of the family of the 8th Earl of Carnwath, his stepmother's husband.\nHe was married in 1871 to Elizabeth van Dedem, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Sophie of the Netherlands and member of the aristocratic van Dedem family. The couple had no children. Elizabeth, herself a writer and historian, contributed articles, chiefly on historical and political subjects, to various reviews.\nIn 1904, money for a memorial was raised by subscription and a statue by Goscombe John was erected in Trinity College Dublin.\nA volume of Lecky's Historical and Political Essays was published posthumously (London, 1908), edited and introduced by his wife.\nThe Lecky Chair of History at Trinity College Dublin, was endowed by his widow in 1913.\nOne of the constituent libraries of Trinity College Dublin is also named in his honour, along with that of the Berkeley and Ussher libraries.\nIn 1978, part of the college's humanities library complex was named in his honour.\nLearned societies\nLecky was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1891.\nBibliography\n* History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in Europe (1865): [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/lecky-history-of-the-rise-and-influence-of-the-spirit-of-rationalism-in-europe-2-vols online]\n* History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne (1869): [https://archive.org/details/historyeuropean10leckgoog volume one of two]; [https://archive.org/details/historyeuropean12leckgoog volume two of two]\n* ''The Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland: Swift, Flood, Grattan, O'Connell (1871, revised ed.)\n* A History of England in the Eighteenth Century (1878 in 8 volumes, revised 1892 in 7 volumes): [https://archive.org/details/ahistoryengland09leckgoog  online edition volume 1]; [https://archive.org/details/ahistoryengland11leckgoog  volume 8]\n** A History of England in the Eighteenth Century (1888–1890) (8 rare original volume set in private collection from the estate of Eleanor Silliman Belknap Humphrey).
