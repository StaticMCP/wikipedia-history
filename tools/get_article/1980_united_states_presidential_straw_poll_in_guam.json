Guam is a territory and not a state. Thus, it is ineligible to elect members of the Electoral College, who would then in turn cast direct electoral votes for president and for vice president. To draw attention to this fact, the territory conducts a non-binding presidential straw poll during the general election as if they did elect members to the Electoral College.\nDemocratic Party nominee and incumbent president Jimmy Carter won the poll with over 55% of the vote.\nResults\nThough the votes of Guam citizens do not count in the November general election, the territory nonetheless conducts a presidential straw poll to gauge islanders' preference for president every election year. The poll has been held in Guam during every presidential election since 1980.\nThe voters had the option between four candidates, then Democratic incumbent president Jimmy Carter, Republican Ronald Reagan, former-Republican challenger to Ronald Reagan independent candidate John B. Anderson and libertarian candidate Edward Clark.\nThe election had 97.3% valid votes, with 2.7% of them being invalid. The votes overwhelmingly favored Jimmy Carter, with Ronald Reagan coming second.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1980 United States presidential straw poll in Guam\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 10em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 10em\" |Running mate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Percentage\n|-\n! style=\"background:#33f; width:3px;\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic\n|Jimmy Carter\n|Walter Mondale\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |14,352\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" |55.4%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f33; width:3px;\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Republican\n|Ronald Reagan\n|George H.W.
