Because of the extent of the Cold War (in terms of time and scope), the conflict is well documented.\nThe Cold War () was the global situation from around 1947 to 1991 of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and propaganda campaigns between the Communist World — primarily the Soviet Union and China and their satellite states and allies — and the powers of the Western world, primarily the United States and its NATO allies.\nOverviews\n* Ball, S.
