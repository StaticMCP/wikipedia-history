She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles and may be crowned and anointed, but historically she does not formally share the king's political and military powers, unless on occasion acting as regent.\nIn contrast, a queen regnant is a female monarch who rules suo jure (Latin for, \"in her own right\") and usually becomes queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.\nA queen dowager is a widowed queen consort, and a queen mother is a queen dowager who is the mother of the current monarch.\nTitles\nWhen a title other than king is held by the sovereign, his wife can be referred to by the feminine equivalent, such as princess consort or empress consort.\nIn monarchies where polygamy has been practised in the past (such as Morocco and Thailand), or is practised today (such as the Zulu nation and the various Yoruba polities), the number of the king's wives and their status vary. In Morocco, King Mohammed VI has broken with tradition and given his wife, Lalla Salma, the title of princess; prior to his reign, the Moroccan monarchy had no such title. In Thailand, the king and queen must both be of royal descent; his other consorts need not be royal before marriage to him but are accorded royal titles that confer status. A Zulu chieftain designates one of his wives as \"Great Wife\", an equivalent to queen consort.\nThe situation is more complex in Yorubaland. All of a chief's consorts are essentially of equal rank. Although one wife, usually the one married to the chief for the longest time, may be given a chieftaincy of her own to highlight her relatively higher status compared to the other wives, she does not share her husband's ritual power as a chieftain. When a woman is to be vested with an authority similar to that of the chief, she is usually a lady courtier in his service who, although not married to him, is expected to lead his female subjects on his behalf.\nIn the Ottoman Empire, haseki sultan (; Ḫāṣekī Sulṭān; ) was the title held by the lawful wife and imperial consort of the sultan. The title was first used in the 16th century by Hurrem Sultan, wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, replacing the previous title of \"Baş Kadın (\"Head Lady\"). The bearer of the title occupied the second most important position in the Ottoman Empire for a female after valide sultan (queen mother).\nWhile the wife of a king is usually given the title of queen, there is much less consistency for the husband of a reigning queen. The title of king consort is rare. Examples are Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, in Scotland and Francis, Duke of Cádiz, in Spain. Antoine of Bourbon-Vendôme in Navarre and Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in Portugal also gained the title. In Portugal, because of the practice of jure uxoris, both King Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburgo-Gotha and his predecessor, King Pedro of Portugal, were treated as ruling kings in protocol and were thus symbolically co-rulers with their wives, but both really had only the same power of a consort and the queen was the real ruler.\nThe title of prince consort for the husband of a reigning queen is more common. The monarchies that adopted this title did so because the title of king is usually historically higher than queen, so when the sovereign is female, her husband should never have a higher title than her. An example is Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He married Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom; because she insisted that he be given a title identifying his status, he became Albert, Prince Consort.\nRole\nThe traditional historiography on queenship has created an image of a queen who is a king's \"helpmate\" and provider of heirs. They had power within the royal household and partially within the court. Their duty was running the royal household smoothly, such as directing the children's education, supervising the staff, and managing the private royal treasury. They unofficially acted as hostesses, ensuring the royal family was not involved in scandals and giving gifts to high-ranking officials in a society where this was important to maintain bonds. As a result, consorts were expected to act as wise, loyal, and chaste women.\nSome royal consorts of foreign origin have served as cultural transmitters. Due to their unique position of being reared in one culture and then, when very young, promised into marriage in another land with a different culture, they have served as a cultural bridge between nations. Based on their journals, diaries, and other autobiographical or historical accounts, some exchanged and introduced new forms of art, music, religion, and fashion.\nHowever, the consorts of monarchs have no official political power , even when their position is constitutionally or statutorily recognized. They often held an informal sort of power dependent on the opportunities afforded to them. Should a queen consort have had an amiable personality and high intelligence, produced a healthy heir, and gained the favor of the court, then chances were higher she would gain more power over time. Many royal consorts have been shrewd or ambitious stateswomen and, usually (but not always) unofficially, among the monarch's most trusted advisors. In some cases, the royal consort has been the chief power behind her husband's throne, e.g., Maria Luisa of Parma, wife of Charles IV of Spain. At other times the consort of a deceased monarch (the dowager queen or queen mother) has served as regent if her child, the successor to the throne, was still a minor:\n* Queen Regent Anne of Kiev, mother of Philip I of France\n* Queen Regent Jeonghui, grandmother of King Seongjong of Korea\n* Queen Regent Munjeong, mother of King Myeongjong of Korea\n* Queen Regent Sunwon, grandmother of King Heonjong of Korea\n* Grand Princess Regent Olga of Kiev, mother of Sviatoslav I of Kiev\n* Grand Princess Regent Elena Glinskaya, mother of Ivan IV of Russia\n* Queen Regent Mary of Guise, mother of Mary, Queen of Scots\n* Queen Regent Catherine of Austria, grandmother of King Sebastian of Portugal\n* Queen Regent Marie de' Medici, mother of Louis XIII of France\n* Queen Regent Anne, mother of Louis XIV of France\n* Queen Regent Luisa de Guzmán, mother of Afonso VI of Portugal\n* Rani Lakshmi Bai, mother of Raja Damodar Rao of Jhansi\n* Queen Regent Maria Christina of Austria, mother of Alfonso XIII of Spain\n* Queen Regent Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, mother of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands\n* Queen Regent Anna Khanum, mother of Abbas II of Persia\n* Queen Regent Helen of Greece, mother of Michael I of Romania\nSimilarly, in several cases in Siam (now Thailand) the queen consort was named regent during an extended absence of the king:\n* Queen Regent Saovabha Phongsri, wife of King Chulalongkorn of Siam, served as Regent during his tour of Europe\n* Queen Regent Sirikit, wife of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, served as Regent during her husband's extended retreat\nExamples of queens and empresses consort\n, consort of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]]\n(1353–1412), was first the consort of King Haakon of Norway and Sweden and later ruled Denmark, Norway and Sweden in her own right]]\nwearing the crown of the Queen of Sweden.]]\nby Nathaniel Dance-Holland, 1769]]\nmarried his half-sister Ankhesenamun]]\nas a regent was the first woman to rule in the Americas.]]\n, Empress consort of Brazil]]\nPast queens consort:\n* Queen Sindeok, consort of Taejo of Joseon\n* Queen Jeongan, consort of Jeongjong of Joseon\n* Queen Wongyeong, consort of Taejong of Joseon\n* Queen Soheon, consort of Sejong the Great of Joseon\n* Queen Jeongsun, consort of Danjong of Joseon\n* Queen Inseong, consort of Injong of Joseon\n* Queen Uiin, first consort of Seonjo of Joseon\n* Queen Inmok, second of Seonjo of Joseon\n* Queen Inyeol, first consort of Injo of Joseon\n* Queen Jangnyeol, second consort of Injo of Joseon\n* Queen Inseon, consort of Hyojong of Joseon\n* Queen Myeongseong, consort of Hyeonjong of Joseon\n* Queen Ingyeong, first consort of Sukjong of Joseon\n* Queen Jang, principal consort of Sukjong of Joseon.
