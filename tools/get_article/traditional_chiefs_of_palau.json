Koror is the most populated state with approximately 64% of Palauans living there as of 2020 and so historically bearers of the title were sometimes erroneously referred to as \"Kings of Pelew\" despite them not having authority over all of modern-day Palau.\nList of known ibeduls\n| Abba Thulle\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Ilengelekei1871–1911()\n|\n|\n|\n| 1911\n|-\n| Louch1911–1917()\n|\n|\n|\n| 1917\n|-\n| Tem1917–1943()\n|\n|\n|\n| 1943\n|-\n| Mariur1943–1958()\n|\n|\n|\n| 1958\n|-\n| Ngoriakl1958–1972()\n|\n|\n|\n| 1972\n|-\n| Yutaka Gibbons1973–()\n|\n|\n|\n| Aged 77\n|-\n| Alexander Merep–present()\n|\n|\n|\n|Living\n|}\nReferences"
