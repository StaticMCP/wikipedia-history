Planning for the school began in 1927 and classes commenced in September 1930. At around the same time the city built several other high schools from the same plans, including Samuel J. Tilden High School, Far Rockaway High School, Abraham Lincoln High School, Bayside High School, and Grover Cleveland High School.\nAs of the 2022-23 school year, the school had an enrollment of 2,366 students and 173.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.6:1.[https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&DistrictID=3600123&ID=360012302013] There were 1,764 students eligible for free lunch and 73 eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\nFacilities\nJohn Adams has three floors and a basement. The basement contains the cafeteria, locker rooms, weight-training room, a swimming pool, numerous classrooms, and a Northwell-LIJ School Based Health Center that opened in 2015. The campus of John Adams is roughly six by three city blocks, with baseball, tennis, track, and football fields behind the school. The school also has three gymnasiums. There is also a library, an auditorium, a Virtual Enterprise Room which is a simulated business class, and several computer and science labs throughout all three floors.\nAcademics\n* Grade levels: 9 to 12\n* Ethnicity:\n**4% White 28% Black 37% Hispanic 28% Asian/Pacific Islander.\n* Gender %: 52.8 Male, 47.2 Female\n* Attendance: 79.9%\n* Graduation rate: 53.6%.\n* 6-year graduation rate: 67.2% as of 2009–2010.\n* College enrollment: 42.8%\n* Current School Grade: John Adams recently received a [D] from the Board of Education. - 2009–2010.\nSpecial programs\n* The school offers specialized programs in vision care as well as medical and dental technology.\n* Taking single sessions of math and English also frees up more time for students to enjoy electives and Advanced Placement courses.\n* The school offers College Now, a program run by CUNY offering accredited college courses on site at the high school.\n* The school has \"collaborative team teaching\" (CTT) classes, where two teachers work with a group of special- and general education students.
