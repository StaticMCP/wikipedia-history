There have been several variations on the Mockingbird model throughout the years. As of 2016, the current models are the Mk1, Mk3, Mk5, Mk7, Mk9 and Mk11.\nOrigins and history\nThe Mockingbird model was designed on a sketch by bassist Johnny \"Go-Go\" Kallas. According to Kallas, the \"shorthorn\" version of the guitar appeared in 1975. The Mockingbird was released in 1976, and was redesigned by Bernie Rico into the \"longhorn\" version in 1978, which is the better known version of the guitar.\nThe September 2010 issue of Guitar World ranked the Mockingbird as \"the coolest guitar of all time\", ahead of guitars such as the Gibson Les Paul and Fender Stratocaster.\nMockingbird users\n* Joe Perry\n* Dick Wagner, one of the first to use the Mockingbird\n* Slash (Seen in the Guns N' Roses \"You Could Be Mine\" music video from Terminator 2: Judgment Day)\n* Dave Mustaine\n* Lita Ford\n* Eric Melvin\n* Steve Hunter\n* Nils Lofgren\n* George Kooymans of Golden Earring\n* Chuck Schuldiner\n* Josh Homme\n* Mieszko Talarczyk of Nasum\n* Jake Pitts\n* Kerry King of Slayer\n* Mille Petrozza of Kreator\n* Eric Griffin\n* Trey Anastasio of Phish is playing a green acrylic Mockingbird as part of the band's Halloween 2021 Musical Costume.\n* Paolo Gregoletto of Trivium\n* Dave Davidson of Revocation\n* Rick Derringer\n* John Konesky\n* hide of X Japan\n*Vic DiCara\n*Sean Blosl of Sanctuary\n* Gerard Way of My Chemical Romance\n* Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth\n* Steve Steinman of Vampires Rock\nSee also\n* B.C.
