The Liberal forces were victorious and occupied Lisbon the next day.\nThe battle\nIn June 1833, the Liberal forces had been  bottled up and besieged in Porto for a year, while the Absolutists remained in control of the rest of Portugal. So it was decided to send a force commanded by the Duke of Terceira over the sea to the Algarve. This force was escorted by a naval squadron commanded by Charles Napier.\nThe Duke of Terceira landed near Faro and marched north through the Alentejo\nThe Absolutists hastily gathered some forces to stop his advance towards the capital.\nBoth armies clashed at Cova da Piedade, near Cacilhas. The Liberal army was able to push back the Absolutists, which entrenched themselves in the Castle of Almada.\nThe next day, the castle was taken by the Liberals and the leader of the Absolutists, General Teles Jordão, was killed.\nThe way to Lisbon now lay open for the Liberal army and they occupied the city without any further opposition.\nSources\n[https://almada-virtual-museum.blogspot.be/2015/07/os-dias-23-e-24-de-julho-de-1833-parte-i.html Almada virtual museum]"
