The awards are organised by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and were inaugurated in 2000 \"in recognition of the achievements of classical musicians and the growth of classical music sales in the UK\".\nThe ceremony takes place in the Royal Albert Hall each May. The event combines live performances with specially commissioned awards presented throughout the evening. Since 2011, the ceremony has been known as \"Classic BRIT Awards\". After a five-year hiatus following the 2013 ceremony, the Classic BRIT Awards returned with a ceremony broadcast from the Royal Albert Hall on 13 June 2018. It was subsequently revealed that the Classic BRIT Awards would become a biennial event, with the next ceremony scheduled to be held in 2020. However, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television networks across the globe, the 2020 live ceremony was suspended to a later date due to a ban on large gatherings by the government in March of that year.\nVoting for the awards is done by \"an academy of industry executives, the media, the British Association of Record Dealers (BARD), members of the Musicians Union, lawyers, promoters, and orchestra leaders,\" except for \"Album of the Year\" which is voted for by listeners of Classic FM.\nAwards\n2000\nFriday 5 May 2000.
