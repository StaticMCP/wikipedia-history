He established a base near Gades (modern Cádiz) and began a systematic campaign of conquest, diplomacy, and economic exploitation, expanding Carthaginian influence over southeastern and central Iberia. After his death, his son-in-law Hasdrubal the Fair continued the expansion, founding the city of Qart Hadasht (modern Cartagena), and signed a treaty with Rome fixing the Ebro River as the northern boundary. Hannibal Barca, Hamilcar’s son, succeeded Hasdrubal in 221 BCE and rapidly pushed northward, besieging Saguntum in 219 BCE—a move that directly provoked the Second Punic War. The Barcid rule laid the foundation for Carthaginian military and economic strength in Iberia, turning it into a key base of operations against Rome.\nReferences"
