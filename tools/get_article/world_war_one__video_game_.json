The text-based tutorial was criticised, as was the slow AI and dull, uninformative combat results. IGN commented that \"whatever joys might be found in the setting or the game design are still obscured by incomplete documentation, a clumsy interface and a number of bugs\". IT Reviews said the game had a \"user-unfriendly interface, an impenetrable tutorial and a constant desire to crash and burn\".\nReferences"
