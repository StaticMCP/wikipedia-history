In the , Mount Rooper had \"no people or a very low population\".\nGeography\nMount Rooper is a mountainous headland with three main peaks which are (from north to south) Notch Hill, Mount Merkara, and Mount Rooper (221 metres). Notch Hill is  high and was named in May 1881 by Captain John Fiot Lee Pearse Maclear (Royal Navy) of HMS Alert because, when viewed from the east, the peak appears to have a notch. Mount Merkara is  and was also named by Maclear in May 1881 after the RMS Merkara which they met on its first voyage as part of the Queensland Royal Mail Line between Australia and London. The mountain Mount Rooper is  and named in 1932 by Lieutenant Commander C.G. Little (Royal Australian Navy) during a survey. Little named the mountain after the Rooper Inlet which it overlooks to the south (near present-day Shute Harbour), which was in turn named by Maclear in May 1881 after Lieutenant Henry E. Rooper on HMS Alert.\nAll of the locality is a protected area, mostly within Conway National Park except for the south-eastern area which is in Conway Conservation Park.\nProserpine-Shute Harbour Road follows the south-western boundary of the locality providing access to Shute Harbour on the southern side of the headland.\nHistory\nMount Rooper comprises part of the former locality of Jubilee.\nDemographics\nIn the , Mount Rooper had \"no people or a very low population\".\nIn the , Mount Rooper had \"no people or a very low population\".\nReferences\nExternal links"
