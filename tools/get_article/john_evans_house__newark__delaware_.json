The first section was built about 1800.  The house in its present form is a two-story, gable roofed brick structure measuring six bays across.  The original structure was expanded during the 19th and early 20th centuries to its present size.  After 1888, it was converted to commercial use.  In 1947, it was purchased by the University of Delaware and renovated in the 1960s for office space.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.\nReferences"
