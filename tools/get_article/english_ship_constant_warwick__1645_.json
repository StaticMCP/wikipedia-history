Hired for service in the Parliamentarian navy during the First English Civil War, her captain William Batten defected to the Royalists during the 1648 Second English Civil War. After her crew mutinied in November 1648, she returned to England and was purchased by Parliament for the Commonwealth Navy on 20 January 1649.\nDescribed as an \"incomparable sailer\", she was noted for her sharpness and fine lines, and was considered by some as the first true frigate of the Royal Navy (although the Expedition and Providence of 1637, which predated her by eight years and originally described as \"pinnaces\", were certainly categorised as frigates by the time of the English Civil War). Mainly used for patrolling, she was captured by the French in 1691.\nConstant Warwick was the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear that name.\nConstruction and specifications\nShe was started as a private venture contracted to Peter Pett I of Ratcliffe and launched in 1645. Her dimensions were keel  keel for tonnage with a breadth of  and a depth of hold of . Her tonnage was  tons. She was remeasured at a later date and her dimensions changed to keel  keel for tonnage with a breadth of  and a depth of hold of . Her tonnage was  tons.\nHer gun armament in 1653 was 32 guns, and in 1666 was 34 guns, consisting of twelve culverins and eight demi-culverins on the upper deck, plus four more demi-culverins and ten sakers on the upper deck.\nShe was completed with a first cost of £1,982.10.0d or 302 tons @ £6.10.0d per ton.}} However, Pepys's assertion that \"Constant Warwick was the first frigate built in England\" neglects the building in 1637 of the Expedition and Providence at Bermondsey (albeit that they were initially classed as \"pinnaces\").\nResearch by William M. James states, }}\nJames continues,\nCommissioned service\nEnglish Civil War and Commonwealth Navy\nShe was commissioned in 1645 under Captain John Gilson, who would hold command until 1647.
