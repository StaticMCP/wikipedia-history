Edward sent Gilbert de Clare and his army to subdue and hold down the southern areas of Wales while other armies would invade elsewhere.\nLlandeilo Fawr, located near the River Towy, was a vital strategic point. Controlling the area meant access to important trade routes and a stronghold in the heart of Deheubarth, where Rhys ap Maredudd was a member of the royal family.\nBattle\nGilbert de Clare with an army of around 1600 infantry and 100 cavalrymen had captured Carreg Cennen Castle from the Welsh. Following their victory, the men sacked the castle, and on the 17th of June they headed back to the nearby English settlement, Dinefwr Castle, to stash the spoils. However, along the way Clare and his men were ambushed by Welsh troops and much of the army was destroyed. This battle showcases the definitive use of guerilla warfare by the Welsh armies during the war for Welsh independence.\nAftermath\nThe battle is considered to be a great victory for the Welsh, despite the English technically winning the battle. English expansion into South Wales was halted for a few weeks and Edward's plans of an attack on multiple fronts were somewhat spoiled. Among the dead was the son of William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Following the defeat, Edward relieved Clare of his command and replaced him with Valence, who was now determined, following the death of his son.\nReferences\n*"
