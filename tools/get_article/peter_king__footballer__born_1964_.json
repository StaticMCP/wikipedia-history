He went on to make 64 appearances for the \"Railwaymen\" during the 1983–84 and 1984–85 campaigns, scoring five goals. He later played non-league football for Southport in the Northern Premier League in 1985–86 and 1986–87, before joining league rivals Morecambe.\nKing played mainly as a defensive midfielder, but could also perform at left or right full back. He was also a very good penalty taker.\nReferences"
