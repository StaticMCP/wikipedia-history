After three attacks mounted by the Georgians with Ketevan's personal leadership, the Lezgins were defeated decisively.\nHistory\nKetevan, a noblewoman on Heraclius II's court, was traveling from Mukhrani through Ghartiskari passage to the capital of the kingdom, Tbilisi accompanied by a royal guard detachment appointed by the king. At the time, frequent North-Caucasian incursions posed great threat to travelers in Georgia. After an ambush perpetrated by the Lezgins, Ketevan took charge of the guard and annihilated the marauders. After arriving in Tbilisi unharmed, she was received by Heraclius with a large celebration festivity.\nReferences"
