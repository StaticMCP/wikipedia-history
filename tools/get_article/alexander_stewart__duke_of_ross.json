His nurse was Katherine Fyn. Christine Cockburn was one of his rockers, appointed to rock his cradle. On 4 August 1513, Margaret was forced to surrender her sons to the Regent John Stewart, Duke of Albany.  They remained at Stirling Castle under the care of John Erskine, 5th Lord Erskine, John Fleming, 2nd Lord Fleming, William Borthwick, 4th Lord Borthwick and William Keith, 2nd Earl Marischal.\nAlexander died in infancy, but during his short life he was heir presumptive to the throne of the Kingdom of Scotland. English officials and diplomats sought to implicate the Duke of Albany in his death as part of their strategy for having him removed from the regency.\nAncestry\nReferences"
