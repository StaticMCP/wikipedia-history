He began playing for Eastville Rovers in 1895, and was the club's top scorer for his first two seasons playing for them, netting 15 times in the 1895–96 season and a further eight times in 1896–97. He played a single game for Singers F.C. (later Coventry City) in the Birmingham & District League in 1898.\nReferences"
