      "text": "# 2013 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 2013 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 53rd in the National Football League (NFL). It also marked the Vikings' final season playing their home games at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome; the team played their home games at TCF Bank Stadium for the 2014 and 2015 seasons while construction of U.S. Bank Stadium, which opened in 2016, took place on the site of the Metrodome. Following a Week 9 loss to their rival Dallas Cowboys, the Vikings were no longer able to match their 10–6 record from 2012, and their loss to the Baltimore Ravens five weeks later sealed their elimination from playoff contention.\nThe Vikings failed to win a road game (0–7–1) for the first time since 2001. Much like in 2001, the Vikings did moderately well (13th) on offensive yardage (344.2 yards per game) despite a quarterback carousel not present in 2001, but ranked among the worst in defensive yardage (397.6 yards per game); only the Dallas Cowboys gave up more yards on defense with 415.3 per game. The Vikings' defense also allowed the most points in the NFL in 2013 at 480 (30.0 points per game), four points shy of matching the most points the team ever allowed in a single season.\nIt took until Week 10 for the Vikings to record their first win on American soil, their only other victory up to that point having come in the NFL International Series game against the Pittsburgh Steelers at London's Wembley Stadium in Week 4. Despite winning their last four home games to finish with an overall record of 5–10–1, the Vikings fired head coach Leslie Frazier after just over three seasons with the team.\nOffseason\n2013 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"7\" style=\"\"| 2013 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Contract\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Overall\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 1\n! 23\n| Sharrif Floyd\n| Defensive tackle\n| Florida\n| 4 years / $8&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n! 25\n| bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Xavier Rhodes\n| Cornerback\n| Florida State\n| 4 years / $7.8&nbsp;million\n| From Seahawks}}\n|-\n! 29\n| bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Cordarrelle Patterson\n| Wide receiver\n| Tennessee\n| 4 years / $7.2&nbsp;million\n| From Patriots to the Patriots in exchange for a first-round selection (29th overall).}}\n|-\n! 2\n! 52\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the New England Patriots\n|\n|-\n! 3\n! 83\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the New England Patriots\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 4\n! 102\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the New England Patriots\n| From Lions}}\n|-\n! 120\n| Gerald Hodges\n| Linebacker\n| Penn State\n| 4 years / $2.58&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n! 5\n! 155\n| Jeff Locke\n| Punter\n| UCLA\n| 4 years / $2.344&nbsp;million\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 6\n! 176\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Arizona Cardinals\n| From Titans}}\n|-\n! 189\n|colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n|\n|-\n! 196\n| Jeff Baca\n| Guard\n| UCLA\n| 4 years / $2.256&nbsp;million\n| From Broncos, via Eagles and Buccaneers}}\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"| 7\n! 213\n| Michael Mauti\n| Linebacker\n| Penn State\n| 4 years / $2.2&nbsp;million\n| From Cardinals\n|-\n! 214\n| Travis Bond\n| Guard\n| North Carolina\n| 4 years / $2.22&nbsp;million\n| From Bills via Seahawks\n|-\n! 229\n| Everett Dawkins\n| Defensive tackle\n| Florida State\n| 4 years / $2.2&nbsp;million\n| From Vikings, via Patriots and Buccaneers\n|}\nNotes:\nRoster changes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Re-signings\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Player name\n!style=\"\"| Position\n!style=\"\"| Contract terms\n|-\n| January 7, 2013 || Chase Baker || DT || 2 years / $900,000\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"| March 12, 2013\n| Joe Berger || C/G || 1 year / $945,000\n|-\n| Jerome Felton || FB || 3 years / $7.5&nbsp;million\n|-\n| Erin Henderson || OLB || 2 years / $4&nbsp;million\n|-\n| Phil Loadholt || OT || 4 years / $25&nbsp;million\n|-\n| Jamarca Sanford || FS || 2 years / $5&nbsp;million\n|-\n| Jerome Simpson || WR || 1 year / $2.1&nbsp;million\n|-\n| March 21, 2013 || Andrew Sendejo || FS || 1 year / $630,000\n|-\n| March 26, 2013 || Marvin Mitchell || OLB || 1 year / $765,000\n|-\n| April 12, 2013 || A.

Cordarrelle Patterson got the game off to a good start for the Vikings, returning the opening kickoff 109 yards for a touchdown to tie the NFL record. However, Aaron Rodgers responded for the Packers by leading his offense on a 14-play, 90-yard drive, culminating in an 11-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson. The sides then exchanged field goals before Rodgers found Nelson again in the second quarter for a 76-yard touchdown. On the Vikings' next possession, they were forced to punt, but Micah Hyde was able to return the kick 93 yards for another Packers touchdown to make the score 24–10. A controversial pass interference call against Packers cornerback Tramon Williams late in the half set the Vikings up with a first down on the Packers' 14-yard line; two plays later, Adrian Peterson had the ball in the end zone for an 8-yard touchdown, which kept the Vikings in with a chance going into the second half.\nBut the Packers offense remained unstoppable as Rodgers again led a long drive, capped by a 1-yard touchdown run from Eddie Lacy after they had converted three times on third down and once on fourth down during the series. After another three-and-out for the Vikings, the Packers offense picked up four first downs in the space of five plays on the way to a 25-yard touchdown run for James Starks. The Vikings again went three-and-out on their next possession, but this time their defense was able to stop Green Bay at the goal line, limiting them to a 20-yard Mason Crosby field goal to make the score 41–17 with just over six minutes to play. Patterson again had a big return on the ensuing kickoff, taking it 51 yards to the Minnesota 42-yard line to set up a short field. Five plays later, Toby Gerhart narrowed the deficit to 17 points with a 13-yard touchdown run. Vikings cornerback Josh Robinson was penalized on the onside kick that followed for touching the ball before it had gone 10 yards, allowing the Packers to run down the clock before Crosby slotted another field goal, this time from 45 yards. Inside the two-minute warning, Ponder threw an incompletion on fourth down, only for Tramon Williams to again be penalized for pass interference against Patterson, allowing Ponder the opportunity for a 19-yard touchdown run two plays later. The Vikings were unable to recover the onside kick, and Green Bay knelt out the clock for a 44–31 win.\nWeek 9: at Dallas Cowboys\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 9: Minnesota Vikings at Dallas Cowboys&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=November 3\n|time=12:00 p.m. CST\n|road=Vikings\n|R1=3|R2=7|R3=7|R4=6\n|home=Cowboys\n|H1=3|H2=3|H3=14|H4=7\n|stadium=AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas\n|attendance=85,360\n|weather=None (retractable roof closed)\n|referee=Jeff Triplette (42)\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Joe Buck, Troy Aikman and Pam Oliver\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/games/vikings-at-cowboys-2013-reg-9 Recap], [http://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55960/DAL_Gamebook.pdf Game book]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n*DAL – Dan Bailey 41-yard field goal, 6:51.

The first quarter was all field goals, as Dallas scored first with a 41-yarder by Dan Bailey, followed by a 23-yarder for the Vikings by Blair Walsh. In the second quarter, Bailey made another field goal from 44 yards to put the Cowboys up by 3, but the Vikings took a 10–6 lead into halftime, capping the ensuing 79-yard drive with a 6-yard run by Ponder.\nAfter the half, Cowboy quarterback Tony Romo completed two consecutive 26-yard passes to tight end Jason Witten to give them an early touchdown and restore their three-point lead. On the very next play from scrimmage, Ponder fumbled the ball as he was sacked in the end zone, and the Cowboys' Nick Hayden recovered it for a touchdown, meaning the Vikings went from 10–6 up to 20–10 down in the space of two scrimmage plays. The Vikings responded immediately with a quick, six-play drive, culminating with a 31-yard pass from Ponder to Kyle Rudolph to cut the Cowboys' lead back to three points.\nAfter a series of punts going into the fourth quarter, Adrian Peterson scored for the Vikings with an 11-yard run with almost six minutes to go, but Walsh pushed the extra point kick wide right, giving the Vikings a three-point lead over the Cowboys. Vikings cornerback A. J. Jefferson intercepted Romo on the Cowboys' ensuing drive, putting the Vikings in a position to potentially take over the game, but the offense went three-and-out and was forced to punt. The Cowboys progressed downfield quickly, never faced with a third down, and scored with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Dwayne Harris, the third time the Vikings had given up a game-winning score in 2013. With less than 30 seconds to play, but they were unable to make any significant territorial gains and Ponder's last-second hail mary fell short, giving the Cowboys a 27–23 win.\nWeek 10: vs. Washington Redskins\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 10: Washington Redskins at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=November 7\n|time=7:25 p.m. CST\n|road=Redskins\n|R1=10|R2=14|R3=3|R4=0\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=7|H2=7|H3=14|H4=6\n|stadium=Mall of America Field at the Hubert H.

After successive punts from each side started the game, the Packers were the first to score as backup QB Scott Tolzien ran in for a 6-yard touchdown, but two field goals from Blair Walsh and a 1-yard touchdown run for Adrian Peterson meant the Vikings took a 13–7 lead into halftime. They extended their lead midway through the third quarter as Christian Ponder hit tight end Rhett Ellison for a 12-yard touchdown, and Walsh made it a 16-point lead with a 29-yard field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter.\nThe Packers pulled the struggling Tolzien after the Ellison touchdown and replaced him with the recently re-signed Matt Flynn. Flynn then led the Packers on three consecutive scoring drives in the fourth quarter, starting with a 3-yard touchdown run for Eddie Lacy. Flynn's pass to Andrew Quarless on the two-point attempt fell incomplete, but Flynn was able to find Jarrett Boykin for a 6-yard touchdown on the next drive to reduce the Vikings' lead to three points. Inside the two-minute warning, Flynn combined with James Jones for a 28-yard completion on 4th-and-6, setting up Mason Crosby for the game-tying, 27-yard field goal. The Packers won the overtime coin toss and took the opening possession down to the Minnesota 2-yard line before having to settle for a field goal, only for Walsh to respond with a 35-yard effort. The two sides then exchanged possession as neither was able to put together a significant drive and the game ended in a 26–26 tie.\nWeek 13: vs. Chicago Bears\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 13: Chicago Bears at Minnesota Vikings&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=December 1\n|time=12:00 p.m. CST\n|road=Bears\n|R1=3|R2=3|R3=14|R4=0|R5=0\n|home=Vikings\n|H1=0|H2=7|H3=3|H4=10|H5=3\n|stadium=Mall of America Field at the Hubert H.

This turned out to be the only game of the Vikings' season (including preseason) in which the opposing team scored fewer than 20 points. A 50-yard run from Cordarrelle Patterson for the first score of the game put the Vikings up 7–0, where the score remained through halftime. After the half, Reggie Bush struck back with a 19-yard touchdown reception to tie the game at 7–7 in the third. The fourth quarter saw David Akers make two field goals to put the Lions in the lead 13–7. However, Matt Cassel threw a TD pass to Patterson to put the Vikings back in the lead 14–13, which they managed to hold onto for the remaining nine minutes of the game.\nHead coach Leslie Frazier was fired as head coach of the Minnesota Vikings the following day. His tenure ended with a record of 21–32–1 in over three years.\nStandings\nDivision\nConference\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nStatistics\nTeam leaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Category\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Player(s)\n!width=75px style=\"\"| Value\n|-\n| Passing yards || Matt Cassel || 1,807\n|-\n| Passing touchdowns || Matt Cassel || 11\n|-\n| Rushing yards || Adrian Peterson || 1,266\n|-\n| Rushing touchdowns || Adrian Peterson || 10\n|-\n| Receptions || Greg Jennings || 68\n|-\n| Receiving yards || Greg Jennings || 804\n|-\n| Receiving touchdowns || Greg Jennings || 4\n|-\n| Points || Blair Walsh || 121\n|-\n!
