In 1880 he obtained his doctorate from the University of Bonn.\nIn 1884, he became a lecturer in Bonn, afterwards being appointed professor of classical philology at the University of Rostock (1887). This was followed by professorships at the Universities of Giessen (1893), Strasbourg (1897), Göttingen (1902) and Freiburg (1909). In 1914 he returned to Strasbourg, where he served as university rector in 1915/16. In 1919 he was a successor to Otto Crusius at the University of Munich.\nHe published numerous articles and works in the area of Greek and Roman history, including on the Catilinarian conspiracy. His magnum opus was a publication of the acts of oecumenical councils (ACO) from Ephesus (431) onwards. He also started the edition of Eusebius' works in the GCS series, editing the Ecclesiastical History with the facing edition of Rufinus' translation by Theodor Mommsen, and the ancient and Byzantine scholia to Euripides' tragedies.\nA friend of the Italian philologist Giorgio Pasquali (met in Gottingen in 1909), Schwartz asserted that the ecclesiastical history was part of the material history of human kind and therefore  within German universities.\nSchwartz died in Munich in 1940.\nBibliography\n* \"De Dionysio Scytobrachione\", (dissertation), Bonn 1880.\n* \"Scholia in Euripidem\", critical edition (volumes 1–2), Berlin 1887\n* \"Quaestiones Herodotae\", 1890.\n* Christliche und jüdische Ostertafeln (1905) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Sn8TAAAAYAAJ Online])\n* \" Acta conciliorum oecumenicorum\" (The Acts of the Ecumenical Councils) Berlin & Leipzig, 1914–1940.\n** Tome 1: Concilium Universale Ephesenum (AD 431)\n** Tome 2: Concilium Universale Chalcedonense (AD 451)\n** Tome 3: Collectio Sabbaitica contra Acephalos et Origenistas destinata (AD 536)\n** Tome 4: Concilium Universale Constantinopolitanum sub Iustiniano habitum (AD 553).\n* Zur Entstehung der Ilias (On the origin of the Iliad), Strasbourg 1918.\n* Das Geschichtswerk des Thukydides, (The historical works of Thucydides), Bonn 1919, second edition 1929.\n* \"Codex Vaticanus Gr. 1431, Eine Antichalkedonische Sammlung Aus Der Zeit Kaiser Zenos\", etc. [Selections from the Contents of the Codex, including letters from and to Saint Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria.
