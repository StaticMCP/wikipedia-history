The battle occurred at approximately 10 in the morning (local time) on 31 August 1896 near Pasong Kalabaw (Now known as Sta. Clara) and the town tribune. The uprising was fought by Magdiwang faction of the Katipunan led by Diego Mojica which signaled the start of the revolution in Cavite.  Numerous uprisings occurred later that day.\nGeneral Artemio Ricarte composed the literary piece \"Alaala sa 31 ng Agosto ng 1896\" for the newspaper publication \"Ang Bayang Kahapis-hapis\" in memory of the victory achieved during the battle. The literary piece was published on the August 24, 1899 edition of the said newspaper publication.\nReferences"
