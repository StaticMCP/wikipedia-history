Until then, the Italians had mostly left their capital ships in harbour, hoping its mere presence as a fleet in being would deter British shipping through the area, though they would not decline battle if given the opportunity.\nSix days later, on the night of 17 November, an Italian force consisting of two battleships ( and ) and a number of supporting units attempted to intercept two British aircraft carriers,  and  and their cruiser escorts, who were en route to Malta to ferry aeroplanes to reinforce its defences (Operation White). The British were warned of their approach and immediately turned about and returned to Gibraltar, launching their aircraft (two Blackburn Skuas and 12 Hurricanes) prematurely. One Skua and eight Hurricanes ran out of fuel and were lost with the loss of seven airmen.\nThe Italians' success in disrupting the reinforcement of Malta cast serious doubt upon British plans to send a further convoy to supply the island (Operation Collar). The convoy was attempted, with increased support, including Force H from Gibraltar and Force D from Alexandria. The convoy was spotted by the Italian intelligence service and the Italian fleet sailed to intercept it. The first Italian naval unit to make visual contact with the convoy was the torpedo boat  on the night of 26 November. After launching two torpedoes from long range, which missed, Sirio reported seven enemy warships heading eastwards.\nBattle\nThe British knew of the Italian fleet's movements, sent their forces north to intercept them before they could close on the freighters. At 09:45 on 27 November, an IMAM Ro.43 reconnaissance floatplane from the heavy cruiser Bolzano discovered a British squadron steaming to the east,  north of Chetaïbi.\nShortly after, at 9:56, Admiral James Somerville received the report of his own aircraft from the carrier Ark Royal about the presence of five cruisers and five destroyers, and assumed that these were Italian units closing for battle. Force D had not yet arrived from Alexandria and the British were outgunned but 15&nbsp;minutes later, Force D was spotted and the tables turned. The two forces were fairly even; although the Italian ships possessed larger and longer-ranged guns, the British had an aircraft carrier, which had shown several advantages over the battleship at Taranto. The Italian admiral, Inigo Campioni, had been given orders to avoid combat unless it was in his favour, making a decisive battle unlikely.\nSomerville deployed his forces into two main groups, with five cruisers (Rear-Admiral Lancelot Holland) in front and two battleships and seven destroyers in a second group following to the south. Further to the south, Ark Royal was preparing to launch its Swordfish. The Italians had organised their fleet into three groups, two composed of the six heavy cruisers and seven of the destroyers and a third group of the two battleships and another seven escorting destroyers bringing up the rear. At 12:07, after a report received from the cruiser s floatplane, Campioni realized the closeness in strengths of the two forces and in accordance with his orders commanded the cruiser groups to re-form on the battleships and prepare to depart. By this point, the lead cruiser formation had already angled toward the British and was beginning to engage them in battle.\nAt 12:22, the lead groups of both cruiser forces came into range and  opened fire at . Fire was exchanged as the distance between them closed, but as the range shortened Italian firepower began to put pressure on the outgunned British. The arrival of the battleship  on the British side helped to even the odds but she was too slow to maintain formation and dropped out of battle after a few salvoes at 12:26. Four minutes later, Vice-Admiral Angelo Iachino, commander of the Italian cruiser group, received orders to disengage, although the battle had swung slightly in their favour. Iachino ordered an increase in speed to , laid smoke and started to withdraw.\nThe Italian destroyer  was hit by a broadside from  and seriously damaged, although she was towed to port after the battle. The heavy cruiser  was hit at 12:22 by a  shell, which knocked out \"Y\" turret, killed seven men, wounded nine others and ignited a fire that took an hour to subdue. A second hit at 12:35 destroyed the after breaker (electrical switchboard) room and cut power to the ship's aft section, including the remaining aft turret. Most sources believe that the first hit was scored by an Italian heavy cruiser from the 1º Cruiser Division, either from Fiume or , The second round came from the 3º Cruiser Division, either from  or , at the time the only Italian warships within range.\nwas also hit once, by either Gorizia, Fiume, Pola, Trieste or Trento; the shell hit her belt at about  range. At around 12:40, eleven Swordfish from Ark Royal attacked Vittorio Veneto with torpedoes, but did not score any hits.\nFor the next few minutes, the tables turned in favour of the British when the battlecruiser  closed the distance on the Italian cruisers and straddled Trieste with two salvoes, hitting it with splinters. At 13:00, Vittorio Veneto opened fire from . Vittorio Veneto fired 19 rounds in seven salvoes from long range and that was enough for the outgunned British cruisers, which turned back at the fourth salvo. As giant water-spouts erupted around Berwick and Manchester, Holland ordered smoke and his ships fled south-east to close with Renown. Manchester was holed by splinters from Vittorio Veneto's rounds. Both forces withdrew, the battle lasting for 54 minutes and causing little damage to either side.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle Winston Churchill wanted Somerville to be replaced, having questioned his offensive spirit ever since his objections to attacking the French at the Battle of Mers-el-Kébir. A board of inquiry exonerated Somerville, who enjoyed the strong support of several fellow admirals. As for Campioni, although he had a mandate to be conservative, he had presided over the loss of Italy's best opportunity to deal the British a sharp setback in a fleet action. His days of command at sea were numbered. As Iachino remarked, \"the use of these ships, which constituted at that moment nearly all of our fleet's effective units after the blow at Taranto, was decided by  mainly for reasons of morale and to demonstrate that our combative spirit remained intact.\"\nPopular culture\nThe battle features in the 1941 Italian film The White Ship directed by Roberto Rossellini.\nOrder of battle\nRegia Marina\n* Admiral Angelo Iachino\n** 6 heavy cruisers: , , , , ,\n** 7 destroyers: , ,  (damaged), , , ,\n* Admiral Inigo Campioni\n** 2 battleships: ,\n** 7 destroyers: , , , , , ,\nRoyal Navy\n* Admiral Sir James Somerville Force H (from Gibraltar)\n** 1 battlecruiser:\n** 2 light cruisers: *,  (covered convoy)\n** 1 aircraft carrier:  (12 Fairey Fulmar fighters, 12 Blackburn Skua dive bombers, 30 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers)\n** 9 destroyers\n* Admiral Andrew Cunningham Force D  (from Alexandria)\n** 1 battleship:\n** 3 cruisers: *,  (covered convoy), *\n** 5 destroyers\n* Admiral Lancelot Holland Force F (convoy escort)\n** 2 light cruisers: *, *\n** 1 destroyer:\n** 4 corvettes: , , ,\n'*'Cruiser force detached under Holland:\n1 heavy cruiser:  (damaged) and 4 light cruisers:  (slightly damaged), , ,\ndestroyers which approached the battle: , , , , ,\ndestroyers escorting Ark Royal during the battle: ,\ndestroyers covering the convoy during the battle:  , ,  , , , ,\n* Convoy\n** 3 freighters: , ,\nSee also\n* Jean Chiappe – thought to have died during the battle after the mail plane he was travelling in, La Verrier, was shot-down.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Green, Jack & Massignani, Alessandro.
