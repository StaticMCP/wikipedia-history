Issued in two parts, the text is Bodor’s personal account of the settlement of Székely families in Tolna County in the spring of 1945, an operation he describes as being carried out under his own leadership.\nContent and circumstances\nIn the text, Bodor reports in detail how, using improvised and unarmed “maintainers of order”, he organized expulsions among the local ethnic German population, after which Székely families were settled in the vacated houses. Describing the first days of the operation that began on 25 April 1945, he wrote:\nDuring the operation, several thousand ethnic Germans in Hungary were driven from their homes, including mainly women, children and the elderly, as most men were at the front or in captivity.\nPolitical background\nIn the 1940s, Bodor was a member of the National Peasant Party; his political views were shaped by racialist (fajvédő) and anti-German convictions. In his recollection he writes:\nLegal status\nBodor had neither statutory nor governmental authorization to carry out the operation. He acknowledged this explicitly:\nPublication and reception\nThe recollection appeared in 1975 in two parts in the journal Forrás (March and April). Its publication provoked significant debate; in 1976 the editorial board issued a separate statement summarizing the criticism. According to the critiques, Bodor’s text is both a document and a political manifesto that justifies an anti-German and racialist perspective.\nSubsequent research\nIn 2021, legal historian Dóra Frey published a study analyzing Bodor’s role in detail, emphasizing that he acted entirely without official authorization and deliberately circumvented the legal framework.\nThe events in Tolna County were also explored in detail by historian Ágnes Tóth, who—based on archival records and contemporary accounts—showed that every phase of the Székely settlements was executed unlawfully. Villages were cordoned off by force, the “Swabians” were expelled, and Székely families were settled in their place.\nBodor’s own reports also conceded that “every phase of the settlement was handled unlawfully”, and that “in this coercive situation he chose the only possible solution”. Numerous abuses and acts of brutality accompanied the actions of the enforcement units, prompting public protests. Following complaints, the Soviet “Control Commission” also requested a report on Bodor, who justified the measures by citing the need to “prevent clashes”.\nSerious abuses were reported at the internment camp established in the Apponyi Palace in Lengyel. According to a complaint letter dated 11 May 1945, “people are driven out to the pasture and they take to the ghetto whomever they wish… there is a special room filled only with feathers, and they take whomever they want in there and beat them mercilessly… day and night, old or young; they must attend to their needs only in the room.” The Bonyhád National Committee repeatedly protested the camp’s operation, and the deputy lord-lieutenant’s investigation confirmed most of the complaints.\nAccording to Tóth’s sources, the Hungarian government was also aware of the atrocities. At the inter-party meeting of 14 May, Ferenc Erdei acknowledged that “in Tolna County, in exactly 22 villages… György Bodor mobilized the population of the Swabian villages to make room for Hungarians, and the Swabians are being kept in collection camps.” Although the meeting deemed the previous actions misguided, it did not suspend Bodor’s activities or initiate an investigation into the unlawful measures.\nAs a result of mass protests, some of the detainees in Lengyel were later released, but the expulsions and the settlement of Székelys continued to cause severe social tensions. Contemporary complaints frequently reported arbitrary occupations and confiscations by settlers, for example:\nSettlements affected by the Bodor-led operations in Tolna County\nAccording to Ágnes Tóth’s research, in May 1945 Bodor travelled to Budapest, where he sensed growing reservations in governmental and inter-party circles regarding his activities. Ferenc Erdei received him coolly, and on 28 May Bodor was handed the withdrawal of his commission, with the verbal instruction to “complete the agrarian tasks in the villages already begun”. Returning to Bonyhád, he carried out confiscations and settlements at a feverish pace during the remaining days.\nIn his report of 4 July 1945, Bodor listed in detail the settlements of Tolna County where the German population was expelled and Székely families were settled in their place. According to the document, the property of a total of 4,350 families was confiscated, and 2,446 families were settled.\nInteractive map: :commons:Data:Szekely honfoglalas 1945 telepulesek.map\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

They later protested in writing against the discriminatory treatment of the German minority on the basis of mother tongue, arguing that it implemented “the principle of collective guilt”, and opposed forming village police forces exclusively from the new settlers as well as the reassignment of notaries and teachers.\nNotes\nSee also\n* Expulsion of Germans from Hungary\n* National Peasant Party\n* Székelys\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n:Category:Székely Land\n:Category:1945 in Hungary\n:Category:Historiography"
