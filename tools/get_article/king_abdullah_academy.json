Its goal was to provide a U.S.-based, English-language curriculum rooted in Islamic values and Arabic language instruction. It primarily served children of Saudi diplomats and expatriates residing in the greater Washington, D.C. area.\nThe school was built on a 40-acre campus previously zoned for educational use. As such, no additional hearings were required by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. At the time of planning, Supervisor Michael R. Frey reported no public opposition to the site.\nCampus\nLocated near Washington Dulles International Airport, the King Abdullah Academy campus featured modern academic buildings, a soccer field, walking trails, outdoor classrooms, and an Olympic-style swimming pool. The school was purpose-built with security and architectural standards similar to those used for diplomatic and international facilities.\nAcademics\nKAA offered instruction in English, Arabic, and Islamic studies. The lower school (K–5) was co-educational, while middle and high school students were taught in gender-segregated classes.\nThe school adopted a U.S.-based curriculum aligned with the Virginia Standards of Learning and was also a certified International Baccalaureate (IB) World School. Students regularly matriculated to U.S. and international universities.\nOpener\nIn January 2025, the school announced that it would close permanently at the end of the 2024–2025 academic year due to financial and administrative sustainability concerns. According to a letter from the board, the school had been unable to establish a viable long-term funding model to maintain operations independently of Saudi governmental support.\nA community petition was launched in an attempt to reverse the closure, but the school’s board of directors confirmed the final decision in April 2025.\nThe closure affected approximately 450 students and 160 staff members. Legal proceedings were initiated to investigate potential violations of the federal WARN Act, as employees were allegedly notified with fewer than 67 days' notice.\nLegacy and future plans\nIn June 2025, it was officially announced that the International Scholars Academy (ISA), a registered nonprofit organization, will serve as the official successor to King Abdullah Academy. While ISA has no affiliation with the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it carries forward the 40+ year legacy of ISA/KAA, with much of the same administrative team leading the new institution. ISA is a fully accredited educational institution by COGNIA, and authorized to offer the full continuum of International Baccalaureate (IB) programs: PYP, MYP, and DP. The new academy emphasizes academic excellence rooted in Islamic values, Arabic language proficiency, civic responsibility, and global citizenship.
