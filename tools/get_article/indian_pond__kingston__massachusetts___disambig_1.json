The average depth of the pond is three feet. Access to the pond is off Indian Road in Plympton. Fishing is regarded as generally poor due to the acidity of the water and the pond's natural infertility.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/habitat/maps/ponds/pdf/dfwindi1.pdf MassWildlife - Pond Maps]"
