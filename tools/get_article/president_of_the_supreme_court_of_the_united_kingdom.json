It is equivalent to the now-defunct position of Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, also known as the Senior Law Lord, who was the highest ranking among the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (the judges who exercised the judicial functions of the House of Lords). The current President is Robert Reed, since 13 January 2020.\nHistory\nFrom 1900 to 1969, when the Lord Chancellor was not present, a former Lord Chancellor would preside at judicial sittings of the House of Lords. If no former Lord Chancellor was present, the most senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary present would preside, seniority being determined by rank in the peerage. In the years following World War II, it became less common for Lord Chancellors to have time to gain judicial experience in office, making it anomalous for former holders of the office to take precedence. As a result, on 22 May 1969, the rules were changed such that if the Lord Chancellor was not present (as was normally the case), the most senior Law Lord, by appointment as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary rather than peerage, would preside.\nIn 1984, the system was amended to provide that judges be appointed as Senior and Second Senior Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, rather than taking the roles by seniority. The purpose of the change was to allow an ailing Lord Diplock to step aside from presiding, yet remain a Law Lord.\nOn 1 October 2009, the judicial functions of the House of Lords were transferred to the new Supreme Court under the provisions of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The Senior Law Lord, Nick Phillips, and the Second Senior Law Lord became, respectively, the President and the Deputy President of the new court. The same day, the Queen by warrant established a place for the President of the Supreme Court in the order of precedence, immediately after the Lord Speaker (the Speaker of the House of Lords).\nList of Senior Lords of Appeal in Ordinary\n* James Reid, Baron Reid (1969–1975)\n* Richard Wilberforce, Baron Wilberforce (1975–1982)\n* Kenneth Diplock, Baron Diplock (1982–1984)\n* Ian Fraser, Baron Fraser of Tullybelton (1984–1985)\n* Leslie Scarman, Baron Scarman (1985–1986)\n* Henry Keith, Baron Keith of Kinkel (1986–1996)\n* Robert Goff, Baron Goff of Chieveley (1996–1998)\n* Nick Browne-Wilkinson, Baron Browne-Wilkinson (1998–2000)\n* Tom Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill (2000–2008)\n* Nick Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers (200830 September 2009)\nList of presidents of the Supreme Court\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n!#\n!
