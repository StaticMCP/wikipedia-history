He stated that he approached the job equally as a fan and as a composer. Believing that that angle helped tremendously when trying to sort out what to keep and what to scrap.\n}}\nHe also stated that showcasing Castle as flawed and humane, was critical to the score.\n}}\nWandmacher has said that he wanted to avoid making the score have a too \"military\" sound to it as he felt that it would be perceived as either cliché or campy.\nReception\nLiz Ferraris of Soundtrack.net stated that Wandmacher's score both reflected the ominous tone of the film and skillfully brought out a necessary lightness to the heavy plot and that the percussion beats were reminiscent of war drums and echoed throughout, as the characters struggle against each other. She also points out that at times, Wandmacher relied on string and woodwind instruments, resulting in a melancholy like sound.\n}}\nRoger Ebert described the music as \"elevator music if the elevator were in a death plunge\".\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [http://www.ray-stevenson.com/community/index.php?topic=571.0;wap2n Interview with Wandmacher]\nExternal links\n* [http://www.filmmusicsite.com/en/soundtracks.cgi?id=38817 Punisher War Zone score]"
