This was the first general election in Ireland following the split in the Irish Parliamentary Party caused by Charles Stewart Parnell's relationship with Katharine O'Shea, who had been married at the beginning of their relationship. The ensuing scandal saw the Party split into rival wings; the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation, and the pro-Parnellite Irish National League. Parnell later died in October 1891 of a heart attack.\nIn spite of the split within the Irish Nationalist parties their vote held up remarkably well, and together they received 297,258 of the 385,115 votes cast in Ireland, and 81 of Irelands 101 seats.\nIrish and Liberal Unionists made small gains in Ulster and around Dublin, resulting in them winning a further 4 seats. It was the first election to be contested by the newly formed Irish Unionist Alliance under Edward James Saunderson.\nThe Irish Nationalist parties went on to support William Ewart Gladstone's attempt to form a minority Liberal government. As Prime Minister, Gladstone once again attempted to push for Irish Home Rule.\nNot included in the totals are the two Dublin University seats, which were retained by the Irish Unionist party.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party || rowspan=\"2\"|Leader || colspan=\"3\"|Seats || colspan=\"3\"|Votes\n|-\n!# of Seats || % of Seats || Seat Change || # of Votes || % of Votes || Vote Change\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish National Federation\n|Justin McCarthy\n|align=\"right\" | 71\n|align=\"right\" | 70.3\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | New\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | 227,007\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | 57.7\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | New\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish National League\n|John Redmond\n|align=\"right\" | 9\n|align=\"right\" | 8.9\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | New\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | 70,251\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | 17.9\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | New\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Nationalist\n|\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | 0.0\n|align=\"right\" |\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | 2,180\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | 0.6\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | New\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Unionist\n|Edward James Saunderson\n|align=\"right\" | 17\n|align=\"right\" | 16.8\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | 49,330\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | 12.5\n|align=\"right\" rowspan=1 | New\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal Unionist\n|Joseph Chamberlain\n|align=\"right\" | 4\n|align=\"right\" | 4.0\n|align=\"right\" | 2\n|align=\"right\" | 29,933\n|align=\"right\" | 7.6\n|align=\"right\" | 3.7\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal\n|William Ewart Gladstone\n|align=\"right\" | 0\n|align=\"right\" | 0.0\n|align=\"right\" |\n|align=\"right\" | 14,472\n|align=\"right\" | 3.7\n|align=\"right\" | 0.8\n|- style=\"background-color:#F6F6F6\"\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:right\"|Totals\n|align=\"right\" | 101\n|align=\"right\" | 100.0\n|align=\"right\" |\n|align=\"right\" | 393,173\n|align=\"right\" | 100.0\n|align=\"right\" |\n|- style=\"background-color:#F6F6F6\"\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|Source: B.M.
