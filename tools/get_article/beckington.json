According to the 2011 census the parish, which includes the hamlet of Rudge, which has a population of 983, and the hamlet of Standerwick.\nHistory\nBeckington is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, when it was held by a Roger Bushell, in the place of Æthelfrith, and it was taxed for ten hides, thereby suggesting that the cultivated area was around 1200 acres. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome and, given that a Hundred comprised one hundred hides, the estate would appear to have made up a significant proportion of its hundred.\nDuring the medieval period, Beckington was a major centre for the wool trade. By the 15th century, fulling mills had been built along the banks of the River Frome which supported the spinning and weaving cottage industries.\nThe English antiquary John Aubrey (1626–1697) noted in his Brief Lives: \"Carrots were first sown at Beckington in Somersetshire. Some very old Man there did remember their first bringing hither.\"\nIn September 1766, rioters marched to Beckington and set on fire a mill and other property, in spite of being offered money and parish relief for their families.\nGovernance\nThe parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\nFor local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the parish comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Mendip (established under the Local Government Act 1972). It was part of Frome Rural District before 1974.\nThe village falls in the 'Beckington and Selwood' electoral ward. The ward stretches from Beckington south to East Woodlands but avoiding Frome. The total population of the ward at the 2011 census was 2,125.\nIt is also part of the Frome and East Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.\nTransport\nBeckington was on the A36 until a bypass was built in 1989. For years, the T-junction in the centre of the village was in grid-lock during the busy commuter times and holiday season.  The location was marked by a large, evergreen bush that was cleverly snipped to the shape of a battle-tank.\nEducation\nBeckington school is a Church of England Voluntary Controlled First School which was built in 1852. Springmead Preparatory School is also based in the village.\nLandmarks\n]]\nSeymours Court Farmhouse dates from the 15th century and is Grade I listed.

It is now home to a company providing technical and procurement support to the Ministry of Defence.\nThe Wool Hall, next door, dates from the 16th century, was substantially restored in the 19th century, and served as a recording studio from the early 1980s until its closure in 2004.
