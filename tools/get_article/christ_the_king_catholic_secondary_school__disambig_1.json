The school was established and began classes in September 2002. Its students are required to wear school uniforms, which consist of green and white short and long sleeve golf shirts, and navy coloured pants and shorts. The school competes in the Halton Catholic Athletic Association (HCAA), as well as the Golden Horseshoe Athletic Conference (GHAC), and their  sports teams are known as the Jaguars. The Jaguars developed a rivalry with the Georgetown District High School 87's (GDHS).  CtK began specialist high skills major programs (SHSM) in the arts, physical education and information technology in 2009.\nFacilities\nChrist the King features:\n* Vocal and instrumental Music rooms\n* Dance studio\n* Dramatic Arts Studio\n* A 350-seat theatre\n* Weight room\n* Artificial turf field and track\n* Three connected gymnasiums\n* Food & nutrition room\n* Cosmetology Lab\n* Automotive Shop\n* Construction Technology\n* Advanced Placement (AP) classes\nArts program\nChrist the King as a secondary school is known for its arts program, starting its Specialist High Skills Major Arts Program in 2009.

Christ the King was built with a live performance theatre consisting of approximately 350 seats, although seats can be removed or added to meet a productions' needs. In 2007, the theatre's name was changed in honour of Irene McCauley, a former trustee of the Halton Catholic District School Board, at which she worked for 26 years.\nConfessions incident\nDuring 2023 an instagram account was created called [https://www.instagram.com/ctk_confessions2024/ \"ctk_confessions2024\"], which would later be used in 2024, this account was used for students to make \"Confessions\" about other incidents and love interests, it caused many parents to get upset that their children were mentioned on this account and the people who participated and created \"ctk_confessions2024\" were penalized according to eyewitnesses.\nFeeder schools\n*Holy Cross\n*St. Brigid\n*St. Catherine of Alexandria\n*St. Francis of Assisi\n*St. Joseph's\n*Halton Hills Christian School\n*Sacre-Coeur\nNotable alumni\n* Jason Dickinson (born 1995), Canadian ice hockey player\n* MacKenzie Entwistle (born 1999), Canadian ice hockey player\n* Sarah Fillier (born 2000), Canadian ice hockey player\nSee also\n* Education in Ontario\n*List of secondary schools in Ontario\n*Georgetown District High School\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ctk.ca/ Christ the King website]\n*[http://www.hcdsb.org/ Halton Catholic School Board Official Website]"
