After the war, the situation became even more tense. Due to internal instability, the Eastern and Western Khans abandoned the Sui dynasty in 607 and 611 respectively. As the Sui dynasty gained a great advantage in this war, it was able to launch the war to destroy the Chen dynasty and unify China.\nThe Sui dynasty sent troops to defend the border and took the initiative to counterattack, and finally adopted Changsun Sheng's policy of \"making friends with distant countries and attacking nearby countries, separating the strong and uniting the weak\" to divide and alienate the various Turkic tribes. The Turks fought without strategic policies such as plundering materials and waging wars, and the Khans couldn't unite closely and finally collapsed. The victory of the Sui dynasty against the Turks was conducive to protecting the economy and culture of the Central Plains.\nFurther reading\n* Book of Sui\n* Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 175\n* 《Compendium of Chinese General History 》 Part III, Volume 1, Fan Wen Lan, published by People's Press\n* 《A General View of Chinese History 》 edited by Zhou Yiliang, Published by Oriental Publishing Center"
