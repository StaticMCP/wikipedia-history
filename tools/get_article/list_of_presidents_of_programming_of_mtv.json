At MTV, he oversaw the creation and growth of MTV and the transition of Nickelodeon from a failing network geared to preschoolers to the highest rated channel aimed at older kids as well as overseeing the launches of VH-1 and Nick at Nite, and led the initial public offering for MTV Networks and its expansion into international markets. Under Pittman's leadership, MTV became the first profitable cable network; then-Time Warner Co-Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ross also noted that MTV became the most profitable basic cable network during Pittman's tenure there. For his development of the MTV brand, Advertising Age selected Pittman in 2010 as one of the ten most influential marketers who transformed American Culture.\n*Les Garland - After Atlantic Records, Garland moved back to the east coast becoming the programming head of MTV: Music Television, the world's first 24-hour music channel. While at MTV, Garland set celebrity profiles for ad guru Dale Pon's anthemic \"I Want My MTV\" marketing campaign.  Along with founder, Robert Pittman, serving as MTV Network's Senior Executive Vice President, Garland was executive producer of the first six MTV Video Music Awards and oversaw all elements of  programming. He was on the lead team that globalized the MTV brand with distribution into Europe, Asia and Australia. During his time at MTV he was asked to be the DJ voice embedded in the classic hit \"We Built This City\" by Starship. This impromptu stunt immortalized his voice as the things DJ dreams are made of, while Garland calls it his first number one song.\n*Sam Kaiser\n*Doug Herzog - As a senior manager at MTV, he was responsible for MTV News, Camp MTV, The Real World, Road Rules, Beavis and Butt-Head, The MTV Movie Awards, and The MTV Video Music Awards.\n*Andy Schuon\n*Brian Graden - In November 1997, Graden was promoted to executive vice president of programming at MTV following the abrupt resignation of Andy Schuon.

DiSanto also ushered in a return to scripted programming at the channel with The Hard Times of RJ Berger, Teen Wolf and Skins, the latter two of which launched in 2011. Disanto is credited as an executive producer for the former MTV and now, VH1 series Scream. DiSanto began his career as an intern at MTV. He graduated to directing commercial spots, music videos, and electronic press kits for bands. By 2003, as Head of Production, DiSanto was supervising special events as well as creating and executive producing shows. DiSanto's early efforts include creating Say What?
