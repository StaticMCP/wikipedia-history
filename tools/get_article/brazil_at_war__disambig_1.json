It trumpets Brazil's supposed \"progressiveness\" under Getúlio Vargas, noting that Rio de Janeiro is a \"modern city\" known for its arts and culture, and that Brazil's constitution allows freedom for its workers and social services. Then shots of the Brazilian Army and Navy are shown, and we are told that 3 million conscripts are planned. (A Brazilian Expeditionary Force did later see action in the Italian Campaign.)\nAfter the segment on Brazil's military, the economic contributions of Brazil are delved into, especially its rubber and crystal production.\nExternal links\n*"
