Results with regard to the total vote, the percentage of the vote won and the number of seats allocated to each party are presented in the tables below. On 31 March 1933, the sitting Landtag was dissolved by the Nazi-controlled central government and reconstituted to reflect the distribution of seats in the national Reichstag. The Landtag subsequently was formally abolished as a result of the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" of 30 January 1934 which replaced the German federal system with a unitary state.\n1918\nThe 1918 Anhalt state election was held on 15 December 1918 to elect the 36 members of the Constituent National Assembly.\n|votes3=9525|seats3=2\n|party4=German Middle Class Party|votes4=3204|seats4=0\n|invalid=223\n|total_sc=0\n|electorate=198388\n|source=Elections in the Weimar Republic, Elections in Germany}}\n1920\nThe 1920 Anhalt state election was held on 6 June 1920 to elect the 36 members of the Landtag.\n|votes3=29051|seats3=6|sc3=+4\n|party4=German Democratic Party|votes4=27013|seats4=6|sc4=–6\n|party5=German People's Party|votes5=23115|seats5=5|sc5=New\n|invalid=223\n|total_sc=0\n|electorate=198388\n|source=Elections in the Weimar Republic, Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany}}\nReferences"
