      "text": "# 2009–10 North Queensland Fury FC season\n\nThe 2009–10 season was the inaugural season of North Queensland Fury. It began on 1 May 2009 and concluded on 30 April 2010, with competitive matches played in the A-League between August and February. The club finished the 2009–10 A-League in seventh place, with eight wins, eight draws and eleven losses, narrowly missing qualification for the finals series.\nThe Fury signed former Scottish international Ian Ferguson to be their inaugural manager, while former Liverpool and England forward Robbie Fowler was the team's marquee player.\nA slow start to the A-League season saw the team fail to win any of its first five games, and record only one win in their first eleven matches. The Fury's form improved in the second half of the season, winning seven of their remaining sixteen games.\n27 players represented the club in the A-League and there were 10 different goalscorers. The team's top scorer was Fowler, who scored 9 goals in 26 games.\nBackgrounds\nTransfers\nIn\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; text-align:left\"\n|-\n!No.\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n!scope=\"col\"|Player\n!scope=\"col\"|Transferred from\n!scope=\"col\"|Fee\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Ref\n|-\n|\n|FW\n!scope=\"row\"|Jeremy Brockie\n|Unattached\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|DF\n!scope=\"row\"|Robbie Middleby\n|Sydney FC\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|11\n|FW\n!scope=\"row\"|Brendon Santalab\n|Sydney FC\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|DF\n!scope=\"row\"|Jacob Timpano\n|Sydney FC\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|MF\n!scope=\"row\"|Jason Spagnuolo\n|Unattached\n|Free agent\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|MF\n!scope=\"row\"|Chris Grossman\n|Queensland Roar\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|MF\n!scope=\"row\"|Fred Agius\n|Adelaide City\n|Undisclosed\n|\n|\n|-\n|9\n|FW\n!scope=\"row\"|Robbie Fowler\n|Unattached\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|DF\n!scope=\"row\"|Scott Wilson\n|Dunfermline Athletic\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|19\n|FW\n!scope=\"row\"|Daniel McBreen\n|York City\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|MF\n!scope=\"row\"|Rostyn Griffiths\n|Unattached\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|1\n|GK\n!scope=\"row\"|Paul Henderson\n|Unattached\n|Free transfer\n|\n|\n|-\n|19\n|DF\n!scope=\"row\"|Jimmy Downey\n|Perth Glory\n|Swap for Daniel McBreen\n|\n|\n|}\nOut\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; text-align:left\"\n|-\n!No.\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n!scope=\"col\"|Player\n!scope=\"col\"|Transferred to\n!scope=\"col\"|Fee\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Ref\n|-\n|\n|MF\n!scope=\"row\"|Felipe\n|Al Raed\n|Undisclosed\n|16 June 2009\n|\n|-\n|11\n|FW\n!scope=\"row\"|Brendon Santalab\n|Chengdu Blades\n|Undisclosed\n|22 July 2009\n|\n|-\n|19\n|FW\n!scope=\"row\"|Daniel McBreen\n|Perth Glory\n|Swap for Jimmy Downey\n|14 January 2010\n|\n|}\nLoans in\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; text-align:left\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Position\n!Player\n!Loaned from\n!Date\n!Loan expired\n!Ref\n|-\n|\n|FW\n!scope=\"row\"|David Williams\n|15 July 2009\n|Brøndby\n|End of the season\n|\n|}\nPlayers\nFirst team squad\n* * Injury replacement player for Scott Wilson.\n* ** Injury replacement player for Shane Stefanutto.\n* *** Injury replacement player for James Robinson.\nMatches\nPre-season friendlies\n| score    =1 : 0\n| report = [http://a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=27590 Report]\n| team2 =  North Queensland Fury\n| goals1 = Yunus\n| goals2 =\n| stadium = Jalan Besar Stadium\n| attendance = 3,000\n| referee =\n| result = L\n}}\n| score = 0 : 4\n| report = [https://web.archive.org/web/20110306062723/http://www.brisbaneroar.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=27786 Report]\n| team2 =  Brisbane Roar\n| goals1 =\n| goals2 = Murdocca Dodd  van Dijk  Cernak\n| stadium = Sologinkin Oval, Mackay\n| result = L\n}}\n| score    =2 : 0\n| report =[http://www.northqueenslandfc.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=27892 Report]\n| team2 =  North Queensland Fury\n| goals1 = Pantelidis Lustica\n| goals2 =\n| stadium = Skilled Park\n| attendance = 3,000\n| referee =\n| result = L\n}}\n| score    =4 : 0\n| report = [http://www.sydneyfc.com/default.aspx?s=aleague_newsdisplay&id=27944 (Report)]\n| team2 =  North Queensland Fury\n| goals1 = Corica Gan Danning McFlynn\n| goals2 =\n| stadium = Shark Park\n| attendance = 5,283\n| referee = Kris Griffiths-Jones\n| result = L\n}}\n| score   =3 : 2\n| report = [http://www.northqueenslandfc.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=28016 Report]\n| team2 =  Adelaide United\n| goals1 = Spagnuolo Agius ,\n| goals2 = Costa  Alemao\n| stadium = Darwin Football Stadium\n| attendance = 2,547\n| referee =\n| result = W\n}}\nwww.thewest.com.au, 4 May 2009.
