The office also presents the Trafficking in Persons Report annually to Congress, concerning human trafficking in the U.S. and other nations.  This report aims to raise awareness about human exploitation and trafficking, and to prevent it. The office's goals are to make the public aware, protect victims, take legal action against violators, establish necessary and just sentences for criminals, and train law enforcement individuals. The office is led by the United States Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.\nHistory\nThe Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons was established in October 2001 as a result of the passing of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.  This enabling legislation required the President to create a bureau within the State Department to specifically address human trafficking and exploitation on all levels and to take legal action against perpetrators.  Additionally, this act was designed to also enforce all laws within the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that apply.\nCurrently, there is a U.S. Law on Trafficking in Persons, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), which has been reauthorized several times, most recently in March 2013.\nTrafficking in Persons Report\nThe Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons monitors human trafficking and prosecutes perpetrators. It divides nations into tiers based on their compliance with standards outlined in the TVPA.\nOfficials\nDirectors\n* Ambassador Nancy Ely-Raphel (2001–2002)\n* Ambassador-at-Large John R.
