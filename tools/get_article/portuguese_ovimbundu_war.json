The early 17th century invasion by the Imbangala people led to a merger of the two populations and the subsequent creation of the Ovimbundu kingdoms. The Benguela region was first explored by Portuguese merchants in the mid-17th century, starting the trade in slaves, ivory, beeswax and rubber.\nThe first attacks by the Portuguese attempted to reach the Ovimbundu people took place in the 17th century in the conflicts against Queen Ana de Sousa Ginga, in 1645. In 1660, a new Lusitanian expedition was unsuccessful and repelled by the still politically disorganized Ovimbundu people.\nRealising the risks of Portuguese influence, the Ovimbundu kingdoms began to establish themselves at the turn of the 17th century to the 18th century, with emphasis on the investiture of Katyavala Bwila I, in the Bailundo kingdom (1700) and in the kingdom of Viye (1750).\nOccasional clashes between the Portuguese and the Ovimbudo occurred in the 18th century, during the opening of overseas exploration routes to the east, areas still strongly resistant to foreign influence. In an attempt at a more peaceful southern route, the Portuguese waged the Galangue War (1768-1769) against the Galangue kingdom, where they defeated King Caconda, managing to force the recapture of the Caconda Fortress.\nConflict\nThe conflict unfolded in five moments, two of them against the Bailundo kingdom, two against the kingdom of Viye and one against an Ovimbundu coalition.\nCoalition battle\nRealising the results of the Galangue war, with the Portuguese plan to invade the plateau, the kingdoms of Quingolo and Bailundo formed an alliance, with the support of Viye, in 1774, to resist the invasion, led by the Bailundo king Chingui I.\nThe coalition troops repelled the invasion, undertaking great pursuit, causing the Portuguese to return to Caconda. The Quingolo kingdom, however, was strongly weakened.\nFirst attack on Viye\nTo undermine the strength of Viye, at the time the strongest of the Ovimbundu kingdoms, Portugal sent troops to the border where they began attacking villages, between 1774 and 1775, suffocating local agricultural production.\nPortugal was unable to take the kingdom, but the strategy proved to be successful, as it fueled the formation of a rival faction to the Biennial king Ndjilahulu I, led by the pretender Kangombe I.\nBattle of Lumbanganda\nFrom Caconda, a military column was formed to advance on Bailundo, in 1776. The attack was considered brutal, which culminated in the retreat of Soma Inene (king) Chingui I and his force to a slit located in the Lumbanganda mountain range.\nThe hiding place was discovered after Inaculo (queen) Bailunda handed over her position, culminating in the arrest of Chingui I and herself. Captives at home in Luanda, their son Elanga Ngongo Chikundiakundi Puka Kaliliwa Lonjila Ekuikui was born.\nGreat Bailunda battle\nThe Portuguese invested Chiliva Bambangulu Chingui II, son of the former monarch, demanding loyalty from him, which he shortly after rejected. In the absence of fortification, the Portuguese returned to Caconda, while Chingui II reorganized his troops and attempted to fortify the villages. The Portuguese responded promptly, sending troops to the border, attacking villages from 1776 onwards, while they themselves were not fully organized.\nIn 1777 the Bailundos tried to interrupt the Lusitanian advance, leading to a situation of inconclusive warfare until 1778.\nIn 1778, taking advantage of the calamitous situation caused by a drought, a Portuguese column advanced on Halã-Vala, the capital of the Bailundo kingdom, as well as on the ombalas of Andulo and Viye. King Chingui II dies in battle, without his body being able to be recovered. The Bailundo kingdom loses the povoations of Viye and Andulo, with the latter becoming a puppet kingdom.\nIn Luanda, Ekuikui I is invested as Soma Inene (king) Bailundo, this being a monarch favourable to Portugal.\nGreat biennial battle\nAware of the difficulty of attacking Bailundo and Viye at the same time, the Portuguese began to put into practice the strategy of defeating the kingdoms from the inside out. Thus, mercenaries were sent to support Kangombe I's faction.\nA guerrilla strategy remained between 1776 and 1778, when, after defeating the Bailundos, Portugal gathered forces to try to defeat the Bienos.\nIn 1778, in a major battle, Cuíto was invaded by Portuguese troops. King Ndjilahulu I was deposed, taking Kangombe I in his place.\nSee also\n* Bailundo revolt\n* Portuguese Angola\n* Portuguese Africa\nReferences"
