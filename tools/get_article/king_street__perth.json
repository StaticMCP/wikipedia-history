The street has a very European feel with its early 20th century, low-rise architecture and restored facades.\nHistory\nThe street was originally called King William Street and was probably named after King William IV. Its name appears for the first time on maps of the Land Department in 1840.\nCommonly once known locally as the start of the \"West End\", it transverses two of Perth's major streets, Murray Street and Hay Street. Between the two there used to be many high-end stores such as McKilroy, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Kookai, Bally, Georg Jensen, Tiffany & Co., Sass and Bide, Watches of Switzerland, Zomp, Dilettante, Hunt Leather, Longchamp, and many other stores and cafes. Almost all have now left for new premises in Murray Street, Perth's new retail centre.\nOther high-end retailers that once surrounded King Street on Hay Street included Burberry, Emporio Armani, Canali, Hugo Boss and Apple.\nKing Street's demise has been well documented and many commentators have noted that it now consists largely of empty shops.\nDuring significant changes in the Perth CBD in the 1980s, King Street was recognised as being a significant remnant of Perth's earlier streetscapes.\nThe street precinct is listed with the Heritage Council of Western Australia.\nSee also\n*\nReferences\nExternal links"
