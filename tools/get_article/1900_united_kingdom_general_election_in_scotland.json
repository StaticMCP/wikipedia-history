Scotland was allocated 72 seats in total, with 70 territorial seats, comprising 32 burgh constituencies and 37 county constituencies. There were also two university constituencies, Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities and Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities. As voters in university constituencies voted in addition to their territorial vote, the results are compiled separately. Also referred to as the \"Khaki Election\" (the first of several elections to bear this sobriquet), it was held at a time when it was widely believed that the Second Boer War had effectively been won (though in fact it was to continue for another two years).\nThe election in Scotland saw the two main party grouping winning almost all votes between them, with the Liberals taking over half the votes cast, whilst the Conservative/Liberal Unionist alliance secured only slightly fewer, winning 49.0% of the vote. Despite winning more votes in Scotland than the Conservative/Liberal Unionist alliance the Liberals finished 4 seats behind their rivals. When combined with results from across the United Kingdom, the Conservatives, led by Lord Salisbury with their Liberal Unionist allies, secured a large majority of 134 seats, despite having received only 5.6% more votes than Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberals. This was largely owing to the Conservatives winning 163 seats that were uncontested by others. The  Scottish Workers' Representation Committee contested their first election - this organisation would later evolve in the Scottish branch of the Labour Party.\nResults\nSeats summary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Last Election\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Conservative and Liberal Unionist (Total)\n| align=center| 38\n| align=center| 33\n| align=center|  5\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#2061a2\" | &nbsp;\n|Liberal Unionist\n| align=\"center\" | 18\n| align=center| 14\n| align=center|  4\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#0087dc\" | &nbsp;\n|Conservative\n| align=\"center\" | 20\n| align=center| 19\n| align=center|  1\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFD700\" | &nbsp;\n| colspan=2 | Liberal\n| align=center| 34\n| align=center| 39\n| align=center|  5\n|-\n| colspan=3 | Total\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center| 72\n| align=center|\n|}\nBurgh & County constituencies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes}}\nVotes summary\n|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars=\n|50.2}}\n||49.0}}\n|0.6}}}}\n|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars=\n|47.2}}\n|27.8}}\n|25}}}}\nNotes\nReferences"
