Authors of fictional works have found his life a compelling source of raw material. Such works have included novels, plays, operas, and films.\nFiction\n* The first major works of literature inspired by Mozart were by the German writers E. T. A. Hoffmann and Eduard Mörike. Hoffmann published his Don Juan in 1812, Mörike his ''Mozart's Journey to Prague'' in 1856.\n* Mozart appears in Hermann Hesse's novels Der Steppenwolf  and Die Morgenlandfahrt.\n* In 1968, David Weiss published Sacred and profane: a novel of the life and times of Mozart, a narrative account on the composer's life drawing heavily on the documented historical record, but with invented conversations and other details.\n* In modern fiction, the mystery surrounding the composer's death is explored within a popular thriller context in the 2008 novel The Mozart Conspiracy by British writer Scott Mariani, who departs from the established Salieri-poisoning theory to suggest a deeper political motive behind his death.\n* Mozart has also featured as a sleuth in detective fiction, in Dead, Mister Mozart and Too many notes, Mr. Mozart, both by Bernard Bastable (who also writes as Robert Barnard). Bastable's stories involve the conceit of an alternate history scenario in which the young Mozart remained on in London at the time of his childhood visit to England, where he has lived a long – though not very prosperous – life as a hack musician, rather than returning to his native Salzburg or Vienna to die young and celebrated. The stories are set in the 1820s and have Mozart interacting with King George IV and his immediate family including the young Victoria.\n* Charles Neider's Mozart and the Archbooby is an epistolary novel in which the young Mozart writes to his father about his new life in Vienna and his new problem, the Archbishop of Salzburg. Stephanie Cowell's Marrying Mozart: A Novel provides a fictionalised account of Mozart's relationship with Aloysia Weber before his marriage to her sister, Constanze.\n* Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology (1986) is a defining cyberpunk short story collection, edited by Bruce Sterling. It contains a story, the \"Mozart in Mirrorshades\" by Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner, in which Mozart appears as a DJ wannabe instead of being the real Mozart after he met the people and culture of his future.\n*In The Amadeus Net, by Mark A. Rayner, Mozart is an immortal living in the world's first sentient city, Ipolis, where he supports himself by selling \"lost\" compositions and playing jazz piano in bars.\n* The alternate history novel Time for Patriots has a trio of time travelers cure Mozart's wife of an abscess on her ankle (historically documented), which allows them to treat him when he falls ill. In consequence he does an opera based on Benjamin Franklin and composes other works until his death in 1805.\nDrama\n* Alexander Pushkin's play Mozart and Salieri is based on the supposed rivalry between Mozart and Antonio Salieri, particularly the idea that it was poison received from the latter that caused Mozart's death. This idea is not supported by modern scholarship.\n* Peter Shaffer's 1979 play Amadeus focuses on the difference between true and sublime genius (Mozart) and mere high-quality craftsmanship (Salieri). Shaffer seems to have been especially taken by the contrast between Mozart's enjoyment of vulgarity (for which historical evidence exists, in the form of his letters to his cousin) and the sublime character of his music.\n* In 2007, he was portrayed by John Sessions in the Doctor Who audio adventure 100 in a story that explored the ramifications of Mozart being granted immortality.\nFilm\n* Stephen Haggard portrays Mozart in the 1936 British film Whom the Gods Love.\n* Gino Cervi portrays Mozart in the 1940 Italian film Eternal Melodies.\n* Hans Holt portrays Mozart in the 1942 Austrian film Wen die Götter lieben.\n* Oskar Werner portrays Mozart in 1958 Austrian film Mozart.\n* Cristopher Davidson portrays 14-year-old Mozart in Bologna in the 1984 Italian film Noi tre.\n* Shaffer's 1979 play was made into the 1984 American film, Amadeus, directed by Miloš Forman. Mozart was portrayed by actor Tom Hulce, who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n* portrays Mozart in the 1991 Austrian film Wolfgang A. Mozart\n* In the 2010 French film ''Mozart's Sister, a biopic of his older sister Nannerl, a young Mozart is played by French child actor David Moreau.\n* Aneurin Barnard portrays Mozart in the 2017 film Interlude in Prague.\n* Daniel Dorr portrays Mozart in the 2020 film Bill & Ted Face the Music''.\n* Mentioned during the \"I've got a dream\" song in the 2010 film Tangled.\nMozart's music has been used extensively in films since the silent era. Luis Buñuel used Mozart's Ave Verum Corpus in ''L'Age d'Or'' (1930), Papageno's \"Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen\" from The Magic Flute features in The Blue Angel (1930), the \"Rondo alla Turca\" in Wuthering Heights (1939), \"Là ci darem la mano\" in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), \"Il mio tesoro\" in Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), the Great Mass in C minor, K. 427 in Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped (1956), the Symphony No. 34 in Vertigo (1958), Eine kleine Nachtmusik in The Ipcress File (1965) and in Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), the Piano Concerto No. 21 in Elvira Madigan (1967), and in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), the march from Idomeneo in Barry Lyndon (1975), the Jupiter Symphony in Annie Hall (1977), the aria \"Sull'aria ... che soave zeffiretto\" in The Shawshank Redemption (1994), the Requiem in The Big Lebowski (1998) and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) and many others.
