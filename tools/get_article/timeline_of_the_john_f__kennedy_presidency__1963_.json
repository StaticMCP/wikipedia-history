This was the beginning of a series of speeches JFK made to promote peace with the Soviet Union. In the Peace Speech, JFK broke with tradition in two ways. First, by asking Americans to examine their attitudes toward Russians, and second by speaking about Russians as people, just like us. \"And every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring peace, should begin by looking inward--by examining his own attitude toward the possibilities of peace, toward the Soviet Union, toward the course of the Cold War and toward freedom and peace here at home... No government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue. As Americans, we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity. But we can still hail the Russian people for their many achievements--in science and space, in economic and industrial growth, in culture and in acts of courage...We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future.
