Barrett was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant in the 18th Surrey Volunteer Rifle Corps on 8 December 1875, with his promotion to lieutenant in March 1878 being antedated to the date he received his commission. By August 1882, he was volunteering in the 4th Surrey, gaining the rank of captain. Two years later he was volunteering with the 2nd Surrey, with Barrett gaining the rank of major in April 1888 and being appointed an aide-de-camp in September of the same year. In December 1895, he was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel; the following month he was decorated with the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. He would command a local volunteer company and during the First World War he would volunteer as a transport officer, supervising the transit of troops to the Western Front.\nIn his youth, Barrett partook in both athletics and cricket in Farnham. A member of the Farnham United Cricket Club, he made two appearances in first-class cricket for Hampshire in 1885 against Surrey at The Oval, and Sussex at Hove. In these, he scored 22 runs with a highest score of 13 not out, while going wicketless with the ball.\nLike his father, Barrett was also involved in brewing. In later life, he was the chairman of Farnham United Breweries. In his final years, he would reside in Sandbanks, Dorset. On 2 December 1921, Barrett was seriously injured when the vehicle he was travelling in collided with another near Bagshot. His wife, Ella, and their chauffeur were uninjured, however Barrett received a fractured skull, amongst other injuries. Despite an operation, he succumbed to his injuries at The Duchess of Connaught Memorial Nursing Home in Bagshot on 19 January 1922. He was cremated two days later at Farnham Cemetery. Aside from being survived by his wife, he was also survived by a son, Edward junior, who played first-class cricket and rugby union at international level.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
