Prior to serving as party chairman, he served as minister of State for People's Welfare and minister of National Development.\nBiography\nAccording to Sunawar Sukowati in 1983:\n}}\nIn 1983, he sparked latent controversy by informing his colleagues in the Indonesian Democratic Party faction that the Pancasila state, as mentioned in Suharto's presidential speech, is a secular state. He argues that this view is inferred from the fact that Indonesia is not a religious state, and religious authority is separated from state authority. His opinion was approved by K.H Hasbullah Bakry and Abdurrahman Wahid.\nReferences\nSources\n*"
