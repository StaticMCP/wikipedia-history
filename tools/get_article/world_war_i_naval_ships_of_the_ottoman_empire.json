In the event, with the outbreak of World War I, one of these ships, including further two scout cruisers and four destroyers, were confiscated and pressed into service with the Royal Navy. This disappointed the Ottomans, contributing to their joining the Central Powers in the Great War.\nDespite these drawbacks, during World War I the Ottoman Navy saw much action against the Russian, British, and French fleets in the Black Sea, Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara.\nThe ships of the Ottoman Navy in World War I\nDreadnoughts\nThe two dreadnoughts,  and  that had been ordered by the Ottoman government, were never handed over despite the fact that they had both been completed in Britain. Prior to this occurrence, Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel had been constructed by Armstrong Whitworth for the Brazilian Navy in 1911 under the name  due to naval rivalries with Argentina. These were eventually resolved in 1913. After the conflict Brazil turned down its order, but the Armstrong Whitworth company did not scrap the ship as it could be sold to other potential customers, among them the Ottoman Empire. In August 1914, the former was transferred to the Royal Navy. She was renamed in the British Fleet as  and the latter remained in Ottoman hands until February of 1916 when she was taken in the nighttime as her crew was off the ship, and British ships nearby took her over and renamed her .\nBattle cruisers\nThe German battlecruiser  was transferred to the Ottoman Navy in November 1914 and renamed to Yavûz Sultân Selîm. She was involved from 29 October 1914 till the end of the war in bombarding Russian ports on the Black Sea coast. During the Great War, she was still largely manned and commanded by the German Imperial Navy. She remained in the Turkish Navy after the war, was renamed Yavûz Selîm in 1930 and then Yavûz in 1936, refitted twice soon after this in 1938 and 1941 and scrapped in 1971.\nPre-dreadnought battleships\nThe two pre-dreadnought battleships,  and , both played a major part in the defense of the Dardanelles during the Gallipoli Campaign. Barbaros Hayreddin was sunk by the British submarine  whilst on patrol with two destroyers.\nCoastal defense ships\n, the Ottoman Navy’s only coastal defense ship, was torpedoed and sunk by the British submarine , commanded by Lt. Norman Holbrook, on 13 December 1914 off Chanak in the Dardanelles. When the submarine got back to base, Holbrook was awarded the Victoria Cross.\nProtected cruisers\nTwo Ottoman protected cruisers,  and , were both about 10 years old. Mecidiye was sunk in the Black Sea off Odessa while in company with Hamidiye and four torpedo boats from a single Russian mine. She was refloated by the Russians and renamed  in June 1915, later being returned to the Ottoman Navy in May 1918 after the Germans captured Ukraine.\nLight cruisers\nThe Ottoman Navy acquired during the Great War the light cruiser Midilli (formerly the German ). She served with the SMS Goeben in many raids against Russian shipping and ports from late October 1914. Midilli was sunk in the Aegean Sea on 20 January 1918 whilst with the SMS Goeben by five Allied mines.\nDestroyers\nThe Ottoman Navy had eight destroyers - four  (, , , ) and four  (known as Schishau class, ex-German S 165 class: , ,  and ) ships.\nYarhisar was sunk by the British submarine  December 1915, Gayret-i Vataniye ran aground October 1916 and was abandoned, Yâdigâr-ı Millet was bombed by British aircraft July 1917, raised and scrapped.\nTorpedo boats\nThe Ottoman Navy possessed the old torpedo boat Berk Efşân.\nSubmarines\nIn 1910, the first and thus far only (modern)  submarine operated by the Ottoman Navy, Sultan Abdül Hamid (also Sultan Abdülhamid), was scrapped.  The Ottoman Empire did not have any submarines going into World War I but obtained  one operational submarine during the war.  , was the former French , which ran aground in the Dardanelles on 30 October 1915 and was captured by the Turks. She was returned to France in 1918.\nMinelayers\nThe Ottoman Navy also had several minelayers,  being the most famous. Her mines laid on 8 March 1915 sank three Allied ships in a small minefield of 20 mines on 18 March 1915. The British pre-dreadnought battleships  and  and the French battleship  were all sunk. The British battle cruiser  was also badly damaged.\nArmored Gunships\nThe ironclad  was built in 1867-71 at Blackwall, one of a group of 7 ships. Rebuilt in 1904-07 by the Italian Naval Shipyards Ansaldo of Genoa, she was of little military value by 1914. A sister unit, the  was sunk in Beirut during the Italo-Turkish War.\nOrder of Battle, 1914\nDjemal Pasha (P. 1309).]]\nOn October 27, 1914, the main naval ships of the Ottoman Navy was organized as follows:\n*Naval Minister: Ferik Djemal Pasha\n* Fleet Commander: Admiral Wilhelm Souchon\n* Chief of Staff: Admiral Arif\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! 1st Division || 2nd Division || 1st Destroyer Division || 2nd Destroyer Division || 1st Torpedo Boat Division || 2nd Torpedo Boat Division || Mine Group(Korvet Kaptanı Kasımpaşalı Nazmi Emin)\n|-\n|  (Kalyon Kaptanı Richard Ackermann) ||  (Fırkateyn Kaptanı Paul Kettner) ||  (out of order)||  (Yzb.
