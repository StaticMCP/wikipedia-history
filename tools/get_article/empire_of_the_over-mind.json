A version with an enhanced display for IBM PC compatibles by Bedrosian was published in 1986.\nContents\nEmpire of the Over-Mind is a text only adventure game in which the player must free a magical kingdom from the control of the evil computer Over-Mind. The game is accompanied by a poem, \"The Rhyme of the Over-Mind,\" which provides necessary clues for the gameplay.\nReception\nIn a 1984 COMPUTE! piece on adventure games, Selby Bateman wrote: \"One very popular game for Avalon Hill has been its all-text adventure, Empire of  the OverMind [sic] for Apple II and Atari computers, which is still selling well, notes Jack Dodd, Avalon Hill's director of marketing.\"\nThe price of the game was a point of contention. Anthony Hughes wrote for Page 6 that it was \"twice the price of the U.K. produced Adventures but still represents very good value.\" Bill Seligman's review in The Space Gamer No. 49 concluded that \"For the price of this primitive program, one could buy two-and-a-half Scott Adams all-text adventures or one full-color graphics adventure from On-Line. Not recommended.\"\nAnother criticism of the game was its lengthy load and processing times.\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
