The town was considered strategically important, as it offered al-Shabaab insurgents direct access to the capital. Thousands of people on the outskirts of the town fled toward Mogadishu and Afgooye ahead of the offensive, with international aid now likely to reach them. No civilian casualties were reported. According to the BBC, securing Afgooye essentially cuts the militant group's controlled territory in half.\nMay 29\n* Kenyan naval forces shell Kismayo after al-Shabaab insurgents opened fire on Kenyan patrol vessels on the Somali littoral.\n* Militants ambush a convoy of vehicles carrying President Sharif Ahmed travelling from the newly liberated town of Afgoye back to Mogadishu.

They were found two days later, burned out, with no likely survivors from the 10 Ugandan servicemen on board.

The Kenyan forces however were said to have successfully repulsed the attack, with at least two Kenyan soldiers and at least 73 al-Shabaab militants reported dead as a result of the fighting. After the remaining attackers fled, the Kenyan forces reportedly captured forty guns and six trucks abandoned by al-Shabaab in their retreat. The increased Kenyan presence in the area is part of Kenya's effort to reinforce the security of its southern border with Somalia and as part of AMISOM's effort to eventually retake the al-Shabaab stronghold of Kismayo.\nAugust 27\n*Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture the port town of Merca from al-Shabaab. Residents indicate that the militants had fled a few hours earlier to Kismayo, which represents the outfit's last major stronghold.\nAugust 29\n*Somali government forces backed by African Union troops battle al-Shabaab militants in the villages of Aglibah, Janaay, Abdulle and Birta Dheer, situated between Afmadow and Kismayo. According to General Ismail Sahardiid, the commander in charge of Somali Army troops in the Lower Jubba region, over 60 insurgents died in the crossfire. Al-Shabaab claims in turn to have killed dozens of government soldiers in the ensuing gun battle. With the allied forces reportedly around 50 kilometers (31 miles) near Kismayo, General Sahardiid indicates that his men are advancing toward the stronghold with caution but expect to capture it within a period of seven days. According to a local resident, al-Shabaab have also positioned armored vehicles on the circumference of the town and are patrolling the area in heavy battle gear and wagons.\nSeptember\nSeptember 1\n*Somali government forces assisted by African Union troops continue their march toward Kismayo, capturing the southern town of Miido, situated 86&nbsp;km from the al-Shabaab stronghold. As many as 36 insurgents were reportedly slain in the assault. AMISOM also deny claims that the insurgents had seized back Afmadow, and dismiss as \"untrue Al Shabaab propaganda\" reports that the militant group had gunned down an AU helicopter. Additionally, an AMISOM spokesman characterizes as a \"very despicable and a shameful act\" photos released by al-Shabaab showing bodies of four allied soldiers being dragged through the Kismayo streets.\nSeptember 3\n*In support of the Somali army's offensive in Kismayo against al-Shabaab, AMISOM soldiers backed by KDF vessels and helicopters reach the nearby town of Harbole. The move comes after intensive attacks since August 31 by allied forces against nearby Islamist bases, which resulted in 36 militant casualties. Ugandan and Burundian AU troops are reportedly making their way southward toward the stronghold, with the Kenyan contingent within AMISOM providing facilitative assistance. The combined forces are awaiting for military authorization to launch the ground offensive.\nSeptember 4\n*As part of an offensive by AMISOM, the Kenyan navy shells the Islamist stronghold of Kismayo. According to local residents, hundreds of people begin fleeing the area ahead of an expected land-based assault, with most heading for Jilib to the north and the Somali government-controlled port of Merca.\n*Somali government forces assisted by African Union troops capture the port of El-ma'an from al-Shabaab, situated on the outskirts of Mogadishu. According to Daud Hajji Iro, the Middle Shabelle region's spokesman, the insurgents abandoned the town after a bout of fighting. The Islamist group was reportedly unavailable for comment.\nSeptember 5\n*Somali government forces and allied AMISOM troops continue their march toward Kismayo, advancing from the liberated Miido to the nearby town of Biibi. Around 200 al-Shabaab insurgents and a few senior commanders in Afmadow also surrender to the coalition forces. The defections are interpreted as substantially enhancing the allied offensive since the insurgents could provide details on al-Shabaab's combat strategy. Additionally, AMISOM's Ugandan and Burundian contingents in Harbole await clearance to attack Kismayo, with Kenyan AU troops preparing to launch an assault from Jilib and Bulla-Hajji in the Jubba region. Residents of Kismayo simultaneously continue to leave the port for the eastern cities of Barawe and Merca ahead of the planned offensive.\nSeptember 18\n*Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops continue their march towards Kismayo. Local residents report that al-Shabaab militants are leaving the port in trucks and buses with heavy weaponry in tow, in the direction of Jilib to the northeast. The insurgents also reportedly free some prisoners before exiting. Al-Shabaab dismiss the claims as \"blatant lies\" and suggest that affairs in Kismayo are \"business as usual.\" An estimated 5,200 people have fled the town since the start of the month ahead of the offensive. According to Somali National Army General Ismail Sahareed, his forces defeated the insurgents in confrontations a few days earlier, and the SNA, which is positioned about 67&nbsp;km away, is now preparing to close in on Kismayo; AMISOM forces are in turn reportedly stationed about 39&nbsp;km from the city, in the town of Jana Cabdalla. Al-Shabaab claim instead to have killed around 100 Somali government soldiers and AU troops from Kenya. Additionally, a spokesperson with the US Navy admits that an American warship is positioned near the port, but suggests that it is there for maintenance purposes. He also asserts that he does not know if the vessel intends to alight on the city.\nSeptember 22\n*An additional 200 al-Shabaab insurgents in the town of Garsale near Jowhar surrender to allied troops. This followed a round of internal battles between rival militants, which left eight of the outfit's fighters dead, including two top commanders. AMISOM announces in a press statement that it expects the total number of al-Shabaab defections in the area to reach 250 men.\nSeptember 24\n*Somali National Army spokesman Adan Mohamed Hirsi accuses Kenyan troops of intentionally killing seven Somali civilians in a joint Somali-AMISOM operation in Janay Abdalla village. The murders came after an earlier ambush attempt by al-Shabaab against Somali and Kenyan soldiers. The young men were in the process of buying sugar when they were shot down, and two other civilians were reportedly also injured. According to BBC correspondent Gabriel Gatehouse, Kenyan forces have already been accused of indiscriminately killing civilians when they shelled Kismayo from warships operating off of the port city's coastline. Hirsi condemns the latest murders and requests that the Somali authorities take action. AU spokesman Col. Ali Aden also indicates that an investigation into the incident has been launched and appropriate action will be pursued once it concludes.\n*Hizbul Islam spokesman Mohamed Moallim announces that his group is discontinuing its association with al-Shabaab, an outfit that he asserts his organization had only nominally united with. Moallim cites the significant political changes happening in Somalia as well as al-Shabaab's reported issuance of propaganda against Hizbul Islam as the primary reasons for his group's decision to leave the coalition. He adds that his organization does not share al-Shabaab's political philosophy, and that he feels the militant group has been considerably \"weakened\". Moallim also indicates that Hizbul Islam is open to talks with any political actors in the country working for a common good.\nSeptember 25\n*Fighter jets belonging to AMISOM's Kenyan contingent bombard an airport armoury and warehouse in Kismayo that was used by al-Shabaab. Although casualty figures are uncertain, Ali Mohamud Rage, a spokesman for the Islamist group, indicates that there are no deaths or property damage, but that \"the Kenyan airforce was maybe trying to boost the morale of its demoralised soldiers.\" Kenyan troops are reportedly positioned around 40&nbsp;km from Kismayo. They have been striving to defeat al-Shabaab militants in the city since they first deployed soldiers to southern Somalia in 2011.\nSeptember 28\n*According to AMISOM official Col. Cyrus Oguna, the Somali National Army and Kenyan AU naval, air and ground forces launched a surprise attack on Kismayo, capturing the city with little resistance mounted by al-Shabaab. The spokesman asserts that the insurgents incurred \"heavy losses\" during the offensive, whereas no allied soldiers were wounded or killed. Fighters from the Ras Kamboni militia also reportedly assisted the SNA and AU troops, who led the charge. Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab states that \"fierce fighting\" is underway between his comrades and the Somali and AMISOM forces. Local residents similarly indicate that the allied troops have seized the port, but the militants are still present elsewhere in the town and are quickly making their way toward the frontlines in vehicles. The Islamist group's propaganda radio station is also still reportedly broadcasting material and allegedly attempting to trick residents into fleeing toward the oncoming Somali government and AMISOM troops. Kismayo is regarded as al-Shabaab's last major stronghold on account of the revenue that the group has been able to generate for itself through exporting charcoal and levying port taxes on imported goods. Col. Oguna indicates that capturing the city \"may signal the end of al-Shabab because Kismayo has been the bastion which has financed activities of the al-Shabab in other regions of Somalia\". Owing to uncertainty as to who will administer the town after the Islamists have been completely ousted, the AU spokesman adds that the offensive was \"meticulously planned\".\nOctober\nOctober 14\n*Somali government soldiers assisted by AMISOM troops capture the strategically important town of Wanla Weyn, located 93&nbsp;km northwest of Mogadishu. The victory permits a direct route connecting the capital with the recently secured city of Baidoa. According to Somali government and AU officials, it also cuts off al-Shabaab's access to other regions, and denies the militants another key source of funds. Additionally, the allied forces seize control of a former Somali Air Force (SAF) base, situated within 15&nbsp;km of Wanla Weyn.\nOctober 29\n*Somali military sources report that General Mohamed Ibrahim Farah (Gordan) is killed in an ambush attack by al-Shabaab insurgents. The surprise assault occurred in the town of El Waregow, near the port of Marko (Merca). Al-Shabaab did not comment on the assassination.\nNovember\nNovember 12\n*At least 7 soldiers and 3 civilians were killed in an ambush by al-Shabaab insurgents on an Ethiopian convoy near Baidoa.\nNovember 25\n*Al Shabaab fighters attack Bulohawo near the border with Kenya. They briefly took control of the small town before retreating to the Somali army. Twelve people from both sides were reportedly killed.\nDecember\nDecember 9\n*Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture the al-Shabaab stronghold of Jowhar, situated 90 kilometres (60 miles) north of Mogadishu.\nDecember 17\n*Al-Shabaab posts a message on Twitter publicly chastising the group's senior American commander Abu Mansoor al-Amriki (Omar Shafik Hammami) for releasing videos in a \"narcissistic pursuit of fame.\" The tweet also asserts that attempts behind the scenes by the outfit to talk to al-Amriki were in vain, so al-Shabaab was morally obligated to divulge his \"obstinacy\".\nDecember 18\n*Somalia national army (SNA) and Kenya defense forces have taken control of Kudha and Madhawa islands which are some 130&nbsp;km (81 miles) to the West of Kismayo. Al-shabaab militants withdraw from Kudha island before the allied forces entered. But there was fighting in Madhawa.\nSee also\n*Somali Civil War (2009–present)\n*2009 timeline of the Somali Civil War\n*2010 timeline of the Somali Civil War\n*2011 timeline of the Somali Civil War\n*2013 timeline of the Somali Civil War\nReferences"
