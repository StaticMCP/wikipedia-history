Lumsden and César Pelli. Construction was completed in 1969. It is made up of two buildings: a seventeen-story office tower, and a ten-story hospital. The plaza originally housed Century City Hospital, which was owned by Tenet Healthcare Corporation. Tenet closed the hospital in 2004 as it sold it to Salus Surgical Group. The hospital was renamed as Century City Doctors Hospital, which closed in 2008 after filing for bankruptcy.  In late 2016, the hospital was remodeled and re-opened as California Rehabilitation Institute, owned by Select Medical, providing inpatient rehabilitation including: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, recreational therapy, and neuropsychology .\nHeritage significance\nThe two buildings resemble two large black boxes made of skin glass. The mullions are reversed, thus playing on the idea of deconstructing the traditional architectural feature of columns. They were the first two buildings to be entirely enclosed in glass skin. This architectural style became a feature of \"corporate architecture\" for the next twenty years.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
