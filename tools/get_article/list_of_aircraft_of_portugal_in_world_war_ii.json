      "text": "# List of aircraft of Portugal in World War II\n\nThis is a list of aircraft used by Portugal in World War II who never fought in World War II but from 1944 cooperated with the Allies in a non-belligerent capacity giving access to Portuguese territorial possessions for Allied forces. A number of Allied aircraft on their way to the North African campaign were forced to land in Portugal due to issues with the aircraft, after landing, Portuguese authorities confiscated the aircraft on grounds that it was illegal for the Allied aircraft to land in Portugal due to Portugal's neutrality. Portugal incorporated the confiscated aircraft into the Portuguese Air Force, this is how a majority of their aircraft were acquired.\nFighters\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n! Model\n!

Due to several problems enroute, some of the aircraft were forced to land in Portugal and Spain. Of the 19 fighter aircraft that landed in Portugal, all were interned and entered service that year with the Portuguese Army Military Aviation. They formed the Squadron OK, based at Ota Air Base. Though unnecessary, the Portuguese Government paid the United States US$20,000 for each of these interned aircraft. The U.S. accepted the payment and gave as a gift four additional crates of aircraft, two of which were not badly damaged, without supplying spares, flight manuals or service manuals.\n|}\nBombers\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!
