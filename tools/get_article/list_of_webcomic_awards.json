      "text": "# List of webcomic awards\n\nThis article provides a list of notable awards for webcomics and some of the winners from each year.\nWebcomics may be eligible for any number of literary awards that recognise achievement in comics or literature generally. As examples, webcomic artists have won Ignatz Awards and Eisner Awards, Gene Luen Yang's graphic novel American Born Chinese (originally published as a webcomic on Modern Tales), was the first graphic novel to be nominated for a National Book Award, and Don Hertzfeldt's animated film Everything Will Be OK, which won the 2007 Sundance Film Festival Jury Award in Short Filmmaking, was based on his webcomics.\nHowever, a number of awards have existed that are specifically for webcomics, or which focus mainly on webcomics. This list details these awards, including their source, criteria, and winners.\nAwards relating to multiple mediums\nPulitzer Prizes\nThe Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine, online journalism, literature, and musical composition within the United States. In 2010, Mark Fiore won a Pulitzer Prize, becoming the first cartoonist to win a Pulitzer for an entry of entirely online cartoons. Fiore was later also a finalist for the Pulitzer in 2018. In 2012 and again in 2020, Matt Bors was a finalist for the Pulitzer, for his webcomics that appeared in the online magazine he founded, The Nib.  In 2015, Tom Tomorrow was a finalist for the Pulitzer based on his This Modern World comics published by the website Daily Kos.\nUrsa Major Awards\nThe Ursa Major Awards relate to furry media, such as video, written works, and comics. They were first presented in 2001 for works produced in the previous year. In 2004, a category for comic strips that feature anthropomorphic characters was introduced. Despite the category including all forms of comics, all winners have been webcomics.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Ursa Major Awards: Best Anthropomorphic Comic Strip\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Creator(s)\n!Website\n!Citation\n|-\n|2004\n|Kevin and Kell\n|Bill Holbrook\n|[https://kevinandkell.com/ kevinandkell.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2005\n|Faux Pas\n|Robert and Margaret Carspecken\n|[http://www.ozfoxes.com/fauxpas.htm ozfoxes.com/fauxpas.htm]\n|\n|-\n|2006\n|Faux Pas\n|Robert and Margaret Carspecken\n|[http://www.ozfoxes.com/fauxpas.htm ozfoxes.com/fauxpas.htm]\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|Ozy and Millie\n|Dana Simpson\n|[https://ozyandmillie.org/ ozyandmillie.org/]\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|Ozy and Millie\n|Dana Simpson\n|[https://ozyandmillie.org/ ozyandmillie.org/]\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Fur-Piled\n|Leo Magna\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718214524/http://www.liondogworks.com/fur-piled.html liondogworks.com/fur-piled.html] (archive)\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Carry On\n|Kathryn Garrison Kellogg\n|[http://www.hirezfox.com/km/ hirezfox.com/km/]\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|Housepets!\n|Rick Griffin\n|[http://www.housepetscomic.com/ housepetscomic.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Carry On\n|Kathryn Garrison Kellogg\n|[http://www.hirezfox.com/km/ hirezfox.com/km/]\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|The Whiteboard\n|Doc Nickel\n|[http://www.the-whiteboard.com/ the-whiteboard.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|Foxes in Love\n|Toivo Kaartinen\n|[https://twitter.com/foxes_in_love twitter.com/foxes_in_love]\n|\n|}\nWeblog Awards\n'' won The Weblog Awards' \"Best Comic Strip\" twice.]]\nThe Weblog Awards were held from 2003 to 2008 and featured a Best Comic Strip category starting in 2006.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Weblog Awards: Best Comic Strip\n|-\n!

It ran from 1977 to 2012 but was not presented every year. From 2001 until its conclusion it included an award for Favourite Web-based Comic. The winners of that category are listed below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Eagle Awards: Favourite Web-based Comic\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n! Creator(s)\n!

In 2003, Justine Shaw's Nowhere Girl received a nomination for an Eisner award in the \"best new series\" category, while Shaw was nominated for \"talent deserving of wider recognition\", making her the first webcomic artist to be nominated for an Eisner.\nIn addition to considering works published online for general categories, the Eisner Awards have included categories only for digital works since 2005. The category Best Digital Comic was awarded each year from 2005 through to 2016, though was renamed Best Webcomic in 2009. Paste Magazine noted in 2016 that the Eisner's conflation of \"digital comic\" and \"webcomic\" may cause independent works to be overshadowed by online services such as Marvel Unlimited and DC Comics' \"Digital First\". In 2017, the category was split into \"Best Digital Comic\" and \"Best Webcomic\" and as of 2020 these two categories remain.\nThe table below shows the winners of Best Digital Comic/Webcomic and of Best Webcomic.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Eisner Award: Best Digital Comic (2005–2008) or Best Webcomic (2009 – present)\n|-\n!

The Harveys were created in 1988 as part of a successor to the Kirby Awards which were discontinued after 1987.\nThe Harvey Awards have included a category for online works since 2006.

They have been awarded each year since 1997, except for 2001 as the show was cancelled after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Recipients of the award are determined by the votes of the attendees of the annual Small Press Expo.\nComics published online have won awards in multiple categories, such as Chester 5000 winning Outstanding Series and Hark! A Vagrant for Outstanding Anthology or Collection. As well as these, the Ignatz Awards have presented an award for Outstanding Online Comic since 2002.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Ignatz Awards: Outstanding Online Comic\n|-\n! Year\n!

The awards have been handed out since 2005 and are administered by the Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association. As of 2024, these awards have not been presented since the \"2021\" awards, presented in 2022 for works produced in 2020.\nThe Joe Shuster Awards have presented a Webcomics Creator award since 2007. Unlike other categories given by other awards, this award is for a creator or team rather than a work and so can be in recognition of multiple pieces of work. This category is not always presented; it was not presented in 2016, nor in 2019 even though other Joe Shuster Awards were presented in those years. The award will be granted in 2020, with nominees announced and the winner to be announced in late October.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ Joe Shuster Awards: Outstanding Webcomic Creator/Creative Team\n|-\n!

They are presented by the National Cartoonists Society, an organization of professional cartoonists in the United States.\nThe NCS first presented a category for webcomics in 2012. The next year it was split into two categories — Online Comics – Short Form, and Online Comics – Long Form — which remains the set-up through 2019.\nThe awards are given out in May each year. The naming of each award ceremony is not always consistent, with some ceremonies being referred to as the year they are in, some as the year past, and some not as a year but as a count, eg \"the 71st\" ceremony. The current naming system appears to be that the award ceremony relates to the previous year; for example, the \"2018 Divisional Awards\" were presented in May 2019.

Named for artist Mike Wieringo, the Ringo Awards were founded by Cards, Comics, and Collectibles in Reisterstown, Maryland and the Ringo Awards Committee in 2017 to be the successor to the Harvey Awards that left the Baltimore Comic-Con as its venue in 2016.\nThe Ringo Awards are nominated by an open vote among comic-book professionals and fans. The winners are selected from the top two fan choices as the first two nominees and the professional jury selects the remaining three nominees in each category.\nThe Ringo Awards have included a Best Webcomic category since its first awards ceremony in 2017. In 2021, a separate category for Humor Webcomic was introduced.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+Ringo Awards: Best Webcomic\n|-\n! Year\n! Title\n! Creator(s)\n!

It was created to promote webcomics in the Netherlands and Belgium, and winners were only from those countries. The Clickies were first awarded in 2005 at the world's first webcomic convention, Clickburg. The awards were again bestowed in 2006, 2007, and 2010, each time in a slightly different format. Its categories, which changed each time, included \"Epic Clickie\", \"Gag Clickie\", and \"Cartoon Clickie\".\nThe Webcomic List Awards\nIn 2009 and 2010, users of the internet forum The Webcomic List held an amateur award ceremony, where winners of its various categories were selected through a panel of judges. The ceremony itself was presented in the form of a webcomic, allowing it to spoof televised award shows as well as exhibit sample portions of the awardees. Each awards ceremony gave out nine different awards; the winners of the Best Comic award are listed below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ The Webcomic List Awards: Best Comic\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Creator(s)\n!Website\n!Citation\n|-\n|2009\n|Gunnerkrigg Court\n| Tom Siddell\n|[https://www.gunnerkrigg.com/ gunnerkrigg.com/]\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Red's Planet\n| Eddie Pittman\n|[https://web.archive.org/web/20180122105258/http://www.redsplanet.com/ redsplanet.com/] (archive)\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of comics awards\nNotes\nReferences"
