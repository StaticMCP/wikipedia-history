Those in attendance included Victoria Justice, Belle Shouse, Rana Roy, Isabella Amara, Meaghan Oppenheimer, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\nReception\nThe series has been met with a mixed to positive critical response upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 67% with an average rating of 4 out of 10, based on 12 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Not quite a showstopper, Queen America catwalks a tightrope between black comedy and straight drama but scores some points for Zeta-Jones' poised performance.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 54 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nIn a positive review, Boston Heralds Mark Perigard praised the series saying that it \"features some surprisingly tense adult moments and some language that was bleeped out. Along the way, there are some cutting observations about the pageant scene — like how every winner has to act shocked, just shocked, when her name is called out.\" In a similarly positive assessment, Common Sense Medias Melissa Camacho was equally complimentary saying, \"Despite the dark, snarky tone, Queen America also contains some mildly empowering themes, including the value of working hard, finding strength in oneself, and the importance of finding people to help pull you up when you need it. And while it has enough strong content to make it a questionable choice for young viewers, it is very entertaining for those mature enough to handle it. All in all, if you’re looking for a fun streaming series to watch, this one works.\" In a more mixed critique, Pastes LaToya Ferguson praised the performance of Zeta Jones saying, \"She is the reason to continue watching, no matter how much you feel you’ve seen it before. The grace and command she possesses in every scene is truly a joy to watch,\" but ultimately concluded that \"In the grand scheme, Queen America pales in comparison to its forerunners. That doesn’t mean it’s a waste of time, though. And who knows, maybe it has a few surprises up its sleeve down the road.\" In an outright negative editorial, Varietys Jen Chaney criticized the series saying, \"In the series, a black comedy (or is it a drama with occasional jokes?) about the desperate hangers-on in the beauty pageant scene, Zeta-Jones feels constrained by the show’s sensibility and its sour lack of ambition. That she fights as hard as she can to avoid being sucked into the eddy of just-good-enough makes the mismatch between star and show, one of the most striking in recent memory, all the more pronounced.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
