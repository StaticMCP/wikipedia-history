It rises  out of the Coral Sea.\nOn this mountain in April 1997, hiker Warren Macdonald became trapped beneath a one-ton slab of stone in a freak rock fall. Two days later he was rescued, only to undergo the amputation of both his legs at mid thigh. His book One Step Beyond chronicles his attempt at climbing Mount Bowen. The accident is the subject of the episode Trapped Under a Boulder, part of the Discovery Channel series, I Shouldn't Be Alive.\nSee also\n* List of mountains of Australia\nReferences"
