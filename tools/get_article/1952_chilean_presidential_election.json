The result was a victory for Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, who ran as an independent.\nElectoral system\nThe election was held using the absolute majority system, under which a candidate had to receive over 50% of the popular vote to be elected. If no candidate received over 50% of the vote, both houses of the National Congress would come together to vote on the two candidates who received the most votes.\nCandidates\nPedro Enrique Alfonso\nAlfonso was the candidate of the Radical Party, and was also supported by the social democratic parties. His government would have become the fourth consecutive Radical administration, since Pedro Aguirre Cerda was elected president.\nSalvador Allende\nAllende, a senator, was the candidate of the Socialist Party, and was running for president for the first time. He had the support of the banned Communist Party. Allende would run three more times, winning in 1970.\nCarlos Ibáñez del Campo\nFormer president Ibáñez was an independent senator for Santiago, and was attempting to reach the presidency, once again, by popular vote. He had the support of several minor parties, including the Socialist Popular Party and the Agrarian Labor Party.\nArturo Matte\nMatte was a Liberal Party senator supported by the Liberal and Conservative parties. He was finance minister under the administration of Juan Antonio Ríos.\nResults\nSince none of the candidates received an absolute majority of the popular votes cast on  4 September, in keeping with the 1925 Constitution a plenary session of both houses of Congress was convened to choose between the two leading candidates on 24 October. The members of Congress selected Ibáñez (who had received a greater share of the popular vote) over Matte.\n|party2=Liberal Party|votes2=265357|votes2_2=12\n|cand3=|party3=Radical Party|votes3=190360\n|cand4=Salvador Allende|party4=Socialist Party|votes4=51975\n|invalid=2971|invalid2=30\n|electorate=1105029|electorate2=192\n|source=Nohlen, [http://eleccion.atspace.com/presidente1952.htm Chilean Electoral Database]\n}}\nReferences"
