The conquests of Hulagu Khan and other Mongol invasions changed the course of the Muslim world, most notably the Siege of Baghdad (1258) and the destruction of the House of Wisdom. Other Muslim powers such as the Mali Empire and Delhi Sultanate conquered large parts of West Africa and the Indian subcontinent, while Buddhism witnessed a decline through the conquest led by Bakhtiyar Khilji. The earliest Islamic states in Southeast Asia formed during this century, most notably Samudera Pasai. The Kingdoms of Sukhothai and Hanthawaddy would emerge and go on to dominate their surrounding territories.\nEurope entered the apex of the High Middle Ages, characterized by rapid legal, cultural, and religious evolution as well as economic dynamism. Crusades after the fourth, while mostly unsuccessful in rechristianizing the Holy Land, inspired the desire to expel Muslim presence from Europe that drove the Reconquista and solidified a sense of Christendom. To the north, the Teutonic Order Christianized and gained dominance of Prussia, Estonia, and Livonia. Inspired by new translations into Latin of classical works preserved in the Islamic World for over a thousand years, Thomas Aquinas developed Scholasticism, which dominated the curricula of the new universities. In England, King John signed the Magna Carta, beginning the tradition of Parliamentary advisement in England. This helped develop the principle of equality under law in European judisprudence.\nThe Southern Song dynasty began the century as a prosperous kingdom but were later invaded and annexed into the Yuan dynasty of the Mongols. The Kamakura Shogunate of Japan successfully resisted two Mongol invasion attempts in 1274 and 1281. The Korean state of Goryeo resisted a Mongol invasion, but eventually sued for peace and became a client state of the Yuan dynasty.\nIn North America, according to some population estimates, the population of Cahokia grew to be comparable to the population of 13th-century London. In Peru, the Kingdom of Cuzco began as part of the Late Intermediate Period. In Mayan civilization, the 13th century marked the beginning of the Late Postclassic period. The Kanem Empire in what is now Chad reached its apex. The Solomonic dynasty in Ethiopia and the Zimbabwe Kingdom were founded.\nEvents\nEastern Hemisphere in 1200 AD\n1201–1209\n*1202: Introduction of  by Fibonacci.\n* 1202: Battle of Basian occurs on July 27, between Kingdom of Georgia and Seljuks.\n* 1202: Battle of Mirebeau occurs on August 1, between Arthur I of Brittany and John of England.\n* 1204: Islamization of Bengal by Bakhtiyar Khalji and oppression of Buddhism in East India.\n* 1204: Fourth Crusade of 1202–1204 captures Zadar for Venice and sacks Byzantine Constantinople, creating the Latin Empire.\n* 1204: Fall of Normandy from Angevin hands to the French King, Philip Augustus, end of Norman domination of France.\n* 1205: The Battle of Adrianople occurred on April 14 between Bulgarians under Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria, and Crusaders under Baldwin I, (July 1172 – 1205), the first emperor of the Latin Empire of Constantinople.\n* 1206: Genghis Khan is declared Great Khan of the Mongols.\n* 1206: The Delhi Sultanate is established in Northern India under the Mamluk Dynasty.\n* 1209: Francis of Assisi founds the Franciscan Order.\n* 1209: The Albigensian Crusade is declared by Pope Innocent III.\n1210s\nItalian Fibonacci's  from the Biblioteca Nazionale di Firenze showing the Fibonacci sequence with the position in the sequence labeled in Roman numerals and the value in Arabic-Hindu numerals.]]\n* 1210: Qutb-ud-Din Aibak, the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, fell down from a horse while playing chovgan (a form of polo on horseback) in Lahore and died instantly when the pommel of the saddle pierced his ribs.\n* 1212: The Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in Iberia marks the beginning of a rapid Christian reconquest of the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula, mainly from 1230–1248, with the defeat of Moorish forces.\n* 1212: Frederick of Sicily is crowned King of the Romans at Mainz.\n* 1213: The Kingdom of France defeats the Crown of Aragon at the Battle of Muret.\n* 1214: France defeats the English and Imperial German forces at the Battle of Bouvines.\n* 1215: King John signs Magna Carta at Runnymede.\n* 1216: Battle of Lipitsa between Russian principalities.\n* 1216: Maravarman Sundara I reestablishes the Pandya Dynasty in Southern India\n* 1217–1221: Fifth Crusade captures Egyptian Ayyubid port city of Damietta; ultimately the Crusaders withdraw.\n1220s\n* c. 1220: The Kingdom of Mapungubwe was established\n* 1220: Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor is crowned in Rome\n* 1221: Merv, Herat, Bamyan and Nishapur are destroyed in the Mongol invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire.\n* 1222: Andrew II of Hungary signs the Golden Bull which affirms the privileges of Hungarian nobility.\n* 1223: The Signoria of the Republic of Venice is formed and consists of the Doge, the Minor Council, and the three leaders of the Quarantia.\n* 1223: The Mongol Empire defeats various Russian principalities at the Battle of the Kalka River. in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death  ]]\n* 1223: Volga Bulgaria defeats the army of the Mongol Empire at the Battle of Samara Bend.\n* 1225: Trần dynasty of Vietnam was established by Emperor Trần Thái Tông's ascension to the throne after his uncle Trần Thủ Độ orchestrated the overthrow of the Lý dynasty.\n* 1226–1250: Dispute between the so-called second Lombard League and Emperor Frederick II.\n* 1227: Estonians are finally subjugated to German crusader rule during the Livonian Crusade.\n* 1227: Genghis Khan dies.\n* 1228–1229: Sixth Crusade under the excommunicated Emperor Frederick II, who returns Jerusalem to the Crusader States in a negotiated settlement with the Sultan of Egypt, Al-Kamil\n* 1228–1230: First clash between Gregory IX and Emperor Frederick II.\n1230s\nPortrait of the Chinese Zen Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan, painted in 1238, Song dynasty.]]\n* 1231: Emperor Frederick II promulgates the Constitutions of Melfi, a far-reaching legal code influential in the development of continental European statehood.\n* 1232: The Mongols besiege Kaifeng, the capital of the Jin dynasty, capturing it in the following year.\n* 1233: Battle of Ganter, Ken Arok defeated Kertajaya, the last king of Kediri, thus established Singhasari kingdom Ken Arok ended the reign of Isyana Dynasty and started his own Rajasa dynasty.\n* 1235: The Mandinka kingdoms unite to form the Mali Empire which leads to the downfall of Sosso in the 1230s.\n* 1237: Emperor Frederick II virtually annihilates the forces of the second Lombard League at the Battle of Cortenuova.\n* 1239–1250: Third conflict between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy.\n* 1237–1240: Mongol Empire conquers Kievan Rus.\n* 1238: Sukhothai becomes the first capital of Sukhothai Kingdom.\n1240s\n* 1240: Russians defeat the Swedish army at the Battle of the Neva.\n* 1241: Mongol Empire defeats Hungary at the Battle of Mohi and defeats Poland at the Battle of Legnica.
