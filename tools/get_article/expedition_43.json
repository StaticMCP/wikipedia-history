It commenced on 11 March 2015 with the undocking of Soyuz TMA-14M, returning the crew of Expedition 42 to Earth and ended with the departure of Soyuz TMA-15M on 11 June 2015.\nThe Expedition 43 crew spent an extra \"bonus month\" on board pending investigation of the Progress M-27M cargo spacecraft failure. On June 8, 2015 ISS adjusted its orbit to move to a safe distance from a piece of orbital space debris.\nThis expedition also used the ISSpresso machine and tested a special cup designed to be drunk from in microgravity by using capillary flow. This was a further development of a zero gravity cup invented by astronaut Donald Pettit and tested on ISS in 2008. The new zero g coffee cup idea was further developed by a Fluid physicist at Portland State University among others.\nCrew\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Position\n!First Part(March 2015)\n!Second Part(March 2015 to June 2015)\n|-\n!Commander\n|colspan=2 align=center| Terry W.
