This temple was dedicated to Shiva.\nHistory and architecture\nAccording to the Inscriptional plaque, the temple was founded in 1622 by King Bir Singha of Mallabhum. The Temple is built in the deul style temple architecture.\nThe structure's layout is square-shaped, with each side being 6.9 meters wide and 10.7 meters tall. Originally, the temple had a curved tower (rekha sikhara), but this was later replaced by an \"octagonal\" tower. There are three other temples of the same style, called Krishna-Balarama, Kesara-Raya, and Nikunjabihar temples, but they are now in ruins.\nThe temple is preserved as one of the archaeological monuments by the Archaeological Survey of India.\nGallery\nFile:Mallesvara temple of Bishnupur in Bankura district 08.jpg\nFile:Mallesvara temple of Bishnupur in Bankura district 01.jpg\nFile:Malleswar temple 01.jpg\nFile:Malleswar temple 02.jpg\nFile:Mallesvara temple of Bishnupur in Bankura district 22.jpg\nFile:KRISHNA BALARAM DEUL TEMPLE BISHNUPUR WEST BENGAL 06.jpg|Krishna-Balarama Temple\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n*"
