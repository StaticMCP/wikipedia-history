Variants of the self-shrinking generator based on a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) are studied for use in cryptography.\nAlgorithm\nIn difference to the shrinking generator, which uses a second feedback shift register to control the output of the first, the self-shrinking generator uses alternating output bits of a single register to control its final output. The procedure for clocking this kind of generator is as follows:\n# Clock the LFSR twice to obtain a pair of bits as LFSR output.\n# If the pair is 10 output a zero.\n# If the pair is 11 output a one.\n# Otherwise, output nothing.\n# Return to step one.\nExample\nThis example will use the connection polynomial x8 + x4 + x3 + x2 + 1,\nand an initial register fill of 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0.\nBelow table lists, for each iteration of the LFSR, its intermediate output before self-shrinking, as well as the final generator output. The tap positions defined by the connection polynomial are marked with blue headings. The state of the zeroth iteration represents the initial input.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: transparent; text-align:center; width:60em\"\n!Iteration #\n! style=\"color: blue\" | 8\n!7\n!6\n!5\n! style=\"color: blue\" | 4\n! style=\"color:blue\" | 3\n! style=\"color: blue\" | 2\n!1\n!Intermediate output\n!Generator output\n|-\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|N/A\n|N/A\n|-\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|rowspan=\"2\"|N/A\n|-\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|3\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|0\n|-\n|4\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|}\nAt the end of four iterations, the following sequence of intermediate bits is produced: 0110.\nThe first pair of bits, 01, is discarded since it does not match either 10 or 11.\nThe second pair of bits, 10, matches the second step of the algorithm, so a zero is output.\nMore bits are created by continuing to clock the LFSR and shrinking its output as described above.\nCryptanalysis\nAs with the shrinking generator, the self-shrinking generator is vulnerable to timing attacks since the output rate varies depending on the state.\nIn their paper, Meier and Steffelbach prove that a LFSR-based self-shrinking generator with a connection polynomial of length L results in an output sequence period of at least 2L/2, and a linear complexity of at least 2L/2-1.\nFurthermore, they show that any self-shrinking generator can be represented as a shrinking-generator. The inverse is also true:\nAny shrinking generator can be implemented as a self-shrinking generator, although the resultant generator may not be of maximal length.\nAn attack presented by the authors requires about 20.7L steps, assuming a known connection polynomial.\nA more advanced attack, discovered by Mihaljević, is able to break a register a hundred bits in length in around 257 steps, using an output sequence of only 4.9 x 108 bits.\nAnother attack  requires 20.694L steps.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* [http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ Handbook of Applied Cryptography]"
