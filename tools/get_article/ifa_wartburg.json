The band was formed in 1984 in Upplands Väsby and disbanded in 1999 for a combination of personal differences and different life wishes.\nNamed after the East German auto brand Wartburg, as built by IFA, their lyrics are written in German and evoke the vocabulary of the GDR in a playful tone. Some song titles include  (),  (),  (),  (FDJ) (),  (),  (), and  ().\nTheir music is eclectic in influence, ranging from bossa nova () and pop/ska () to jazz and swing (). The band itself stated that the genre of their music was 'Mauer Power' (a reference to the Berlin Wall) and 'Russian Roll', although this was likely a joke.\nGünther Raubschaentze, who claims to be affiliated with IFA Wartburg, runs a YouTube channel and a website for the band. As of May 2025, the YouTube channel had amassed 3.9 million views and over 11,000 subscribers. IFA Wartburg also had a Spotify account that, as of July 2024, had over 50,000 monthly listeners. In September 2024, IFA Wartburg's music was removed from online music streaming services after a person named Losi Gaydyn copyrighted the songs from the album Im Dienste des Sozialismus, although the songs could still be accessed through the band's YouTube channel. In January 2025, the album was released again on streaming platforms but was removed swiftly two days later, only to be restored a few days after. After another removal and restoration four days later, the songs can now be found on most streaming platforms.\nDiscography\n* Im Dienste des Sozialismus, CD Album, 1998\n* Der Berliner, CD EP, 1998\n* Im Dienste des Sozialismus, Vinyl LP (picture disc) with the faces of Erich Honecker and Queen Silvia of Sweden.\nIm Dienste des Sozialismus\n| studio       = Gorbyland Studios\n| genre        = Folk, synth-pop\n| length       =\n| label        = Plattenmeister\n| language     = German\n| italic_title = no\n}}\nThe only IFA Wartburg album released to date, Im Dienste des Sozialismus (), was released on the first of March 1998 on vinyl and CD.
