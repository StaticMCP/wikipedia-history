The nearest town is Keynsham, which lies approximately  north east of the village.\nThe village was originally simply Charlton, recorded in 1291 as Cherleton. It was an estate of Keynsham Abbey until the Dissolution, and the prefix was added when the estate was given by Henry VIII to Queen Catherine Parr.\nThe Church of St Margaret dates from the 12th century. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. There is a late medieval cross on the village green.\nIn 1931 the civil parish had a population of 94. On 1 April 1933 the parish was abolished and merged with Compton Dando.\nNotable residents\nThe author Dick King-Smith lived in Queen Charlton until his death in 2011.\nReferences"
