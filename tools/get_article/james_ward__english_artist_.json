The experience may have embittered him, and the deaths of his first wife and a daughter were among other tragedies. Like many artists of the time, Ward sought commissions from wealthy gentry of their favorite horses, their favorite hunting dogs or their children.\nOne such family that Ward painted and drew repeatedly, and whom he counted among his friends, were the Levett family of Wynchnor Park, Staffordshire. One of Ward's best-known portraits was his Theophilus Levett hunting at Wychnor, Staffordshire of 1817. Another was Ward's 1811 painting entitled The Reverend Thomas Levett and his favourite dogs, cock-shooting.\nWard also painted a group portrait of three Levett children — John, Theophilus and Frances Levett. (For the Levetts, see link to the Ward exhibit at the Yale Center for British Art.)\nFamily\nJames Ward was first married to Mary Ann Ward (no known relation) in 1794, and after her death to Charlotte Fritche in 1827 (supposedly a relative of his first wife).\nJames and Mary Ann Ward had several children including:\n#Matilda Louisa Ward, who married the artist John Jackson.\n#George Raphael Ward, b. 1798, d. 1879\nJames Ward was the paternal grandfather of the painter Henrietta Ward and the great-grandfather of Leslie Ward, the Vanity Fair caricaturist.\nIn 1830, Ward moved to Cheshunt (Hertfordshire) with his second wife, but he continued to work, particularly on religious themes. A stroke in 1855 ended his work, and he died in poverty. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. His monument was sculpted by John Henry Foley in 1866.\nStyle\nJames Ward was one of the outstanding artists of the day, his singular style and great skill set him above most of his contemporaries, markedly influencing the growth of British art. Regarded as one of the great animal painters of his time, James produced history paintings, portraits, landscapes and genre. He started off as an engraver, trained by William, who later engraved much of his work. The partnership of William and James Ward produced the best that English art had to offer, their great technical skill and artistry having led to images that reflect the grace and charm of the era. He was admitted for membership into the Royal Academy in 1811.\nOne of Ward's best-known paintings, The Deer Stealer, was commissioned in 1823 for the sum of 500 guineas by Ward's patron Theophilus Levett. When the work was finished, Levett pronounced himself delighted with the results, and consequently raised the remuneration to 600 guineas. Subsequently, Ward was said to have been offered 1,000 guineas for the painting by 'a nobleman,' which he declined. The painting now hangs at Tate in London.\nGallery\nFile:James Ward - Heath Ewe and Lambs - Google Art Project.jpg|Ewe and Lambs, 1810\nFile:LevettChildren.jpg|The Levett Children, 1811\nFile:James Ward - Gordale Scar (A View of Gordale, in the Manor of East Malham in Craven, Yorkshire, the Property of Lord Ribblesdale) - Google Art Project.jpg|Gordale Scar, 1815\nFile:James Ward (1769-1859) - View in Tabley Park - N00385 - National Gallery.jpg|View in Tabley Park, c.1818\nFile:James Ward (1769-1859) - A Spaniel Frightening Ducks - N05926 - National Gallery.jpg|A Spaniel Frightening Ducks, 1821\nFile:James Ward (1769-1859) - The Deer Stealer - N05972 - National Gallery.jpg|The Deer Stealer, 1823\nFile:James Ward - Marengo - WGA25437.jpg|Marengo 1824\nFile:James Ward - The Day's Sport - Google Art Project.jpg|''The Day's Sport, 1826\nFile:James Ward - Diana at the Bath - Google Art Project.jpg|Diana at the Bath, 1830\nFile:James Ward - Kenilworth Castle, Warwickshire - Google Art Project.jpg|Kenwilworth Castle, 1840\nFile:An Overshot Mill in Wales (Aberdulais) - James Ward.jpg|An Overshot Mill in Aberdulais, Wales, 1847\nSee also\n*List of British artists\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Beckett, Oliver.
