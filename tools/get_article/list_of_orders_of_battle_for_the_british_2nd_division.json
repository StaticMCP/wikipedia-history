It can also provide information on the strength of that formation and the equipment used. An order of battle is not necessarily a set structure, and it can change depending on tactical or strategic developments, or the evolution of military doctrine. For example, a division could be altered radically from one campaign to another through the adding or removing of subunits, but retain its identity and prior history. The size of a division can vary dramatically as a result of what forces are assigned and the doctrine employed at that time.\nThe 2nd Division was an infantry division of the British Army, which was formed numerous times over a 203-year period. Several formations bore the name, the \"2nd Division\", from 1809 through to the end of the 19th century. The historian Everard Wyrall, the compiler of the division's First World War official history, only included those formations that fought in the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and the Second Boer War as being linked with the division that was created in the 20th century and fought in the First World War. That modern formation was created in 1902 and would go to further serve in the Second World War. The first 2nd Division that was formed was a mere 3,900 men strong and did not include supporting weapons such as artillery. In comparison, the 2nd Infantry Division, from the Second World War period, was over 18,000 men strong and supported by 72 artillery pieces and numerous other support weapons. Each war that the division fought in has a corresponding order of battle section.\nNapoleonic Wars\n, Rowland Hill, by William Salter]]\nDuring the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), the British Army grew in size. On 18 June 1809, Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, commander of the British forces in Spain and Portugal, ordered the creation of four divisions, including the 2nd Division. During the division's first action of the Peninsular War (the name given to Napoleonic Wars fought in Spain and Portugal), the Battle of Talavera (1809), it was 3,905 men strong. By the next year, it had grown to a strength of 10,677 men. It roughly maintained this strength for the rest of the Peninsular War, and was disbanded when the fighting ended in 1814. It was reformed on 11 April 1815, in the Southern Netherlands (modern-day Belgium), on the resumption of hostilities. It fought at the Battle of Waterloo, where it had a strength of 6,833 men. It then marched into France. Shortly after, the Napoleonic Wars came to a conclusion. The division remained within the restored French kingdom, as part of the British Army of Occupation. In December 1818, the Army of Occupation and the division were disbanded and the troops returned to Britain.\nTalavera Campaign (July 1809)\n2nd Division\nChristopher Tilson's Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment of Foot (The Buffs)\n* 2nd Battalion, 48th (the Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot\n* 2nd Battalion, 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot\n* One company, 5th Battalion, 60th Regiment of Foot (July 25)\nWilliam Stewart's Brigade:\n* 29th (Worcestershire) Regiment of Foot\n* 1st Battalion, 48th (the Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot\n* 1st Battalion of detachments\n1810–1811, including the Battle of Bussaco, the Lines of Torres Vedras, and Battle of Albuera\nDuring this period, brigades were referred to by their commander's names.

The division proceeded to the Crimea, where it landed on 14 September, and fought throughout the Siege of Sevastopol. During this period, the division numbered around 3,500 men. The division remained in the Crimea until 1856, and demobilised following the conclusion of hostilities.\nCrimean War (1854–1855)\nEach division within the expeditionary force to the Crimea had a 1st and a 2nd Brigade.\n2nd Division\n1st Brigade:\n* 30th (Cambridgeshire) Regiment of Foot\n* 55th (the Westmorland) Regiment of Foot\n* 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot\n* 3rd Regiment of Foot (The Buffs) (not part of the division when it formed, but joined by the end of the war)\n2nd Brigade:\n* 41st (Welch) Regiment of Foot\n* 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot\n* 49th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) (or the Hertfordshire) Regiment of Foot\n* 62nd (Wiltshire) Regiment of Foot (not part of the division when it formed, but joined by the end of the war)\nDivisional artillery, Royal Artillery:\n* R Battery\n* G Battery\nSecond Boer War\nA new 2nd Division was mobilised in England following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, with the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. It was transported to southern Africa, and fought in the majority of battles related to the Relief of Ladysmith, in the Colony of Natal. It then advanced into the South African Republic, guarded the lines of communication, and was then disbanded by the end of 1900 following the end of conventional warfare.\nAt the Battle of Colenso, the initial attempt to relieve Ladysmith, the division commanded the majority of British forces in Natal Colony. This force was 16,000 men strong, supported by 44 artillery pieces and 16 machine guns. When it next took the field, on the march towards the Battle of Spion Kop, it was much reduced. The entire force that marched numbered 20,000 men, but this included two divisions, an independent brigade, several batteries of artillery, and various other regiments, squadrons, and companies of cavalry and mounted infantry.\nOn mobilisation in 1899\n2nd Division\n3rd (Highland) Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, Highland Light Infantry\n* 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Highlanders (Black Watch)\n* 2nd Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders\n* Supply Column (Train Company, No. 14)\n* Litter Bearer Company, No. 1\n* Field Ambulance No. 14\n4th Brigade (Light Infantry):\n* 1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry\n* 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, Scottish Rifles (Cameronians)\n* 3rd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\n* Supply column (Train Company, No. 16)\n* Litter Bearer Company, No. 14\n* Field Ambulance No. 14\nDivisional Troops:\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Artillery\n** No. 63 Field Battery\n** No. 64 Field Battery\n** No. 73 Field Battery\n** Ammunition Column\n* Field Engineer Company, No. 11\n* Supply Column (Train Company, No. 24)\n* Field Ambulance No. 3\nBattle of Colenso (December 1899)\n2nd Division\n2nd Brigade:\n* 2nd Battalion, East Surrey Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, The Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment\n4th Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry\n* 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, Scottish Rifles (Cameronians)\n* 3rd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\n* No. 14 Field Hospital\n5th Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, Connaught Rangers\n* 1st Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers\n* 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers\n* 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers\n* No. 10 Field Hospital\n* No. 16 Bearer Company\n6th Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers\n* 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers\n* Unidentified Field Hospital\nDivisional Troops:\n* 12 companies of mounted infantry\n* 2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry\n* 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifles\n* 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Artillery\n** No. 7 Field Battery\n** No. 14 Field Battery\n** No. 64 Field Battery\n** No. 66 Field Battery\n** No. 73 Field Battery\n* Detachment of naval guns\n* 12th Field Company, Royal Engineers\n* Ammunition Column\n* No. 3 Field Hospital\nSpion Kop campaign (January 1900)\n2nd Division\n2nd Brigade:\n* 2nd Battalion, East Surrey Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, The Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment\n5th Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, Connaught Rangers\n* 1st Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers\n* 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers\n* 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers\nDivisional Troops:\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Artillery\n** No. 19 Field Battery\n** No. 28 Field Battery\n** No. 63 Field Battery\n* One squadron from the 13th Hussars\n* Royal Engineers\nFebruary 1900 – end of 1900\n2nd Division\n2nd Brigade:\n* 2nd Battalion, East Surrey Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, The Queen's (Royal West Surrey) Regiment\n4th Brigade:\n* 1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry\n* 1st Battalion, Rifle Brigade\n* 2nd Battalion, Scottish Rifles (Cameronians)\n* 3rd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps\nDivisional Troops:\n* Divisional artillery, Royal Artillery\n** No. 7 Field Battery\n** No. 14 Field Battery\n** No. 66 Field Battery\n** Divisional Ammunition Column\n* One squadron from the 13th Hussars\n* 17th Company, Royal Engineers\nFirst World War\nOn 28 July 1914, the First World War began. On 4 August, Germany invaded Belgium and the United Kingdom entered the war against the German Empire. The division soon after deployed to France, as part of the British Expeditionary Force, and it then served on the Western Front between 1914 and 1918.\nThe war establishment, the on-paper strength, of an infantry division in 1914 was 18,179 men, 5,594 horses, 18 motor vehicles, 76 pieces of artillery, and 24 machine guns. While there was a small change to the number of men and horses in a division in 1915, the main change was the decrease in artillery pieces to 48 and an increase in motor vehicles to 54. The establishment in 1916 increased the division size to 19,372 men, 5,145 horses, 61 motor vehicles, 64 artillery pieces, 40 trench mortars, and 200 machine guns. The 1917 changes saw a decrease to 18,825 men, 4,342 horses, 57 motor vehicles, and 48 artillery pieces, although the number of trench mortars remained the same, and the number of machine guns increased to 264. By 1918, the number of front line infantry within the British Army in France had decreased because of casualties and a lack of eligible replacements, and this had led to a manpower crisis. To consolidate manpower and to increase the ratio of machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was reduced from twelve to nine. This resulted in the 1918 establishment of 16,035 men, 3,838 horses, 79 motor vehicles, 48 artillery pieces, 36 trench mortars, and 400 machine guns.\nFirst World War (1914–1918)\n2nd Division\n4th

the United Kingdom declared war in support of the latter and entered the Second World War. The division, now styled as an infantry division, saw combat in France in 1940. After the British Army's defeat, the division returned to and defended the United Kingdom. It was then transferred to India, following the Empire of Japan's entry into the war. The division then fought in India and Burma in 1944 and 1945.\nThe war establishment of an infantry division in 1939 was 13,863 men, 2,993 vehicles, 72 artillery pieces, 48 anti-tank guns, 361 anti-tank rifles, 126 mortars, and 700 machine guns.
