China was an exception as they simply termed the incident \"unfortunate\" and \"urged stability on the peninsula.\" This was speculated to be China's concern for instability on the Korean peninsula. Christian Oliver stated in The Financial Times that South Korea needs to explain why its navy started shooting northwards immediately, thus risking starting a war, and give reassurance on the competence of predominantly conscript forces.\nInternational organizations\nOrganization of American States\n: The Secretary General of the Organization of American States José Miguel Insulza called the sinking of the Cheonan, \"a clear violation of international law and a threat to world peace and security[...]\".\nUnited Nations\n:United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, himself a South Korean national, took an unusual step of demanding action against North Korea: \"I'm confident that the [Security] Council, in fulfilling its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, will take measures appropriate to the gravity of the situation.\" The United Nations Command investigated whether the sinking was a violation of the armistice. The Command said it was convening a \"special investigations team\" (SIT) to \"review the findings\" of the investigation into the incident and would \"determine the scope of the armistice violation.\" The SIT team included Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, New Zealand, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, Sweden and Switzerland.\n:On 14 June 2010, South Korea presented the results of its investigation to United Nations Security Council members. In a subsequent meeting with council members North Korea stated that it had nothing to do with the incident.

After the release of the South Korean investigation report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its spokesman Ma Zhaoxu refrained from condemning North Korea, stating that \"all parties should stay calm, exercise restraint and properly handle relevant issues so as to avoid the escalation of the situation.\" Researchers at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, drawing on interviews with Chinese officials and foreign policy experts, argued that there existed an \"inability of the top leadership to reach a consensus on how to react\" to the issue.\nIndia\n:The Ministry of External Affairs of India released a statement on the same day, \"The Korean government has shared with us the details of the investigation of the Civil-Military Joint Investigation Team to determine the cause of the sinking of the Cheonan.
