Following this, a transitional government and national constitution has governed Syria under President Ahmed al-Sharaa. The government has improved the country's diplomatic relations, with many international sanctions being lifted. Challenges for the new government have included renewed Israeli military operations inside the country as well as integrating various armed militias into the country's armed forces. Government-aligned forces have been accused of civilian killings when fighting pro-Assad forces in western Syria and intervening in Bedouin–Druze sectarian violence.\nPolitical\n]]\nThe initial political structure was immediately built around the already-existing Syrian Salvation Government, led by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which had existed in Idlib since 2017. This included vesting the executive power of Syria with the emir of HTS, Ahmed al-Sharaa. Hours after the fall of Damascus, Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali, the final prime minister under President Bashar al-Assad, agreed to lead the transitional government in a caretaking capacity. He then transferred power to Mohammed al-Bashir, prime minister of the Syrian Salvation Government, two days later. Governing power was vested in the Syrian caretaker government. On 29 January 2025, Ahmed al-Sharaa was formally appointed President of Syria by the Syrian General Command for the transitional period during the Syrian Revolution Victory Conference in Damascus.\nAlso announced during the Syrian Revolution Victory Conference was the formal repeal of the 2012 Ba'athist constitution, with the government approving an interim constitution of Syria on 13 March 2025. The new constitution established a five-year transitional period, with the next presidential election to be held by its conclusion. The legislature, the People's Assembly of Syria, shall have 100 of its members indirectly elected idistrict-based electoral college system, selected by local committees composed of experts and community figures, during the 2025 elections. The remaining 50 members will be appointed directly by the president. There is no longer a position of prime minister of Syria. The Supreme Constitutional Court of Syria shall have its seven members appointed by the President. The Constitution retains certain elements from its predecessor, including the requirement that the President's religion be Islam and that Islamic jurisprudence serve as the primary legislative foundation. The constitution promises equality for all citizens regardless of demographic and religious backgrounds and enshrines freedoms of opinion and expression into the law.\nThe caretaker government was succeeded by the Syrian transitional government on 29 March 2025.\nArmed groups\nThe government announced its intention to have all armed groups of the Syrian opposition during the civil war disband and fold into the government. The Syrian National Dialogue Conference, held in February 2025, was a national conference to achieve this. On 12 February 2025, two major organizations of the former Syrian opposition, the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Negotiation Commission, announced their allegiance to new government. On 11 March 2025, President al-Sharaa signed an agreement with Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), to incorporate SDF-controlled institutions into the state, establish border crossings, and pledge to fight the remnants of the Assad regime. The deadline for the merger has been set for the end of 2025.\nInternational relations\nInternational sanctions on Syria have been relaxed throughout 2025.\nIsrael\nIsrael expanded its occupation of Syrian territory beyond the Golan Heights and into the United Nations-administered UNDOF Buffer Zone.\nClashes\nWestern Syria\nSouthern Syria\nReferences"
