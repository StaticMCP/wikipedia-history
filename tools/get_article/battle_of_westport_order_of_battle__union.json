The Confederate order of battle is listed separately.\nCommand disputes\nBy order of MG Blunt (General Field Orders No. 2) the militia regiments of William H. M. Fishbeck, Brigadier General of Militia, were placed under the command of Charles W. Blair, Colonel of Volunteers; Fishbeck was infuriated that his command had been subordinated to a volunteer officer.  Because Kansas law stated that militia should be kept under the command of militia officers, Fishbeck disregarded Blunt's order.  Blunt had Fishbeck arrested and held until released by order of MG Curtis.  Upon his release, Fishbeck resumed command of the Kansas Militia regiments, with orders to obey directives that came from MG Blunt.  This rather cumbersome arrangement had BG Fishbeck in direct command of the militia units attached to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, and Col Charles Blair in overall command of the brigade.  Howard N. Monnett describes the arrangement as a \"brigade within a brigade\".  Blair and Fishbeck led the militia into action at Westport (accompanied onto the field by MG George W. Dietzler), and then in the subsequent pursuit of Price until MG Curtis ordered the militia to return home.\nAbbreviations used\nMilitary rank\n* MG = Major General\n* BG = Brigadier General\n* Col = Colonel\n* Ltc = Lieutenant Colonel\n* Maj = Major\n* Cpt = Captain\n* Lt = 1st Lieutenant\n* 2Lt = 2nd Lieutenant\nOther\n* w = wounded\nArmy of the Border\nMG Samuel R.
