The chapel was built in 1879.\nSussex has many 19th-century Independent and Baptist chapels in this Vernacular style: a tiled, gabled roof, porch, and red-brick walls with round-arched windows. This example was built in 1879 by William Knight, a horticulturist who was also the chapel's first pastor. It is a Gospel Standard movement chapel.\nSee also\n* List of places of worship in Mid Sussex\n* List of Strict Baptist churches\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
