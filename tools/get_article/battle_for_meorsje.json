It ended with the victory of the forces of the Croatian Defense Council and marked a turning point in this area.\nBattle\nThe attack was started by the ARBiH, whose goal was to put pressure on the Croats from the Kreševo. But the HVO responded boldly, stopping the ARBiH offensive and pushed them back. In the end the HVO captured the peak of Meoršje, which gave the HVO an advantage and a better tactical view. During the defense of Kreševo from the attack of ARBiH, 67 Croatian defenders were killed, 114 were wounded, and one is still listed as missing. With the capture of Meoršje, the danger of the fall of Kreševo was definitely removed, so even though there were other important ones, the anniversary of the mentioned battle is specially celebrated every year.\nReferences"
