The temple is situated on the bay of Cambay and the shore of the Arabian Sea, and it is renowned for its unique phenomenon of disappearing into the sea twice a day.\nHistory and legend\nKartikeya, the son of Lord Shiva, killed the demon Tarakasura and established a Shivling at the spot where he killed the demon. The temple is also mentioned in the Skanda Purana, which refers to a pillar called Vishwanandak Stambh set up by the Devas at the Mahi Sagar Sangam Teerth Kshetra.\nArchitecture\nStambheshwar Mahadev Temple is a simple temple with no extraordinary architectural features. However, its unique feature is that it disappears into the sea twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. The temple is submerged in the sea during high tide and emerges as the tide recedes, revealing a 4-foot high Shivling.\nVisiting information\nThe best times to visit the temple to witness its disappearance into the ocean are:\n* During the Shravan month and on Maha Shivratri.\n* On Purnima (full moon) or Amavasya (new moon) days.\n* Between 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, as after that the high tide starts and the temple gets submerged.\nThe temple's disappearance and reappearance timings vary each day based on the Gujarati calendar used by the temple administration. Visitors are advised to check the temple's website or contact them in advance to get the exact timings for the day they plan to visit.\nFacilities and amenities\nThere are two-bed non-AC rooms available at Shree Stambheshwar Mahadev Tirth, located 3.2&nbsp;km from the temple, which offers affordable accommodation and amenities like CCTV cameras, hot water, and clean drinking water. It is recommended to visit the temple on Purnima or Amavasya days to witness the full phenomenon. The beach is clean, but the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming. There are tea stalls and snack kiosks available, and it is advisable to carry your own food, as options are limited.\nExternal links\n* [http://www.stambheshwarmahadev.com Official Website]\nReferences"
