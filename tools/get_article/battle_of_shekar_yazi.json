This confrontation was part of the broader Kurdish uprisings in early 20th-century Iran, during a period marked by regional unrest and efforts by Kurdish leaders to assert autonomy.\nBattle\nIranian forces attacked from the mountains around Salmas and Urmia and entered Salmas and the regions under Samko's rule. When Simko saw the enemy forces advancing by capturing the front lines, he immediately ordered Amar Khan Shikak and his cavalry to attack the enemy positions in the Shekar Yazi plains, which the commander of the Iranian forces, Amir Arshad, was stationed there. Under Simko's orders, Amar Khan, along with a force of 200 Kurdish Zibaris commanded by Mahmud Agha and Fars Agha, attacked the positions of Amir Arshad and after a heavy battle they were able to defeat the enemy army and kill Amir Arshad.\nAfter the kelling of Amir Arshad, Iranian forces are left without a commander and the morale of the Iranian soldiers declines.\nAftermath\nAfter the failure of Iranian forces to resist Simko forces and the defeat and dispersion of Iranian forces, caused a great reaction throughout Iran.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
