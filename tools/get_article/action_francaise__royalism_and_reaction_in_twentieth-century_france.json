He conceives of the history of Action Française as \"a kind of political novel with surprising twists\". He analyzes the \"multiple paths of royalism, nationalism and Maurrassism of Action Française\" during the first half of the 20th century.\nThe first police report that attests to the existence of Action Française is from 4 July 2023. In May 1906, another report states that all \"reactionary troops\" now follow Action Française. Eugen Weber details how Action Française imposed itself despite the weakness of its means at the beginning. In 1909, the Action française had only 180 militants.\nThe author sheds light on the complexity of Maurras' attitude during the Second World War by juxtaposing his unwavering support for the Vichy regime until 1944 with \"his hatred of Germany, refusing to receive Brasillach, to publish pro- -Germans or to announce \"European\" meetings\".\nSources\nEugen Weber relies on the analysis of the Parisian press but also of provincial newspapers such as La Nouvelle Guyenne and ''L'Eclair'' from Montpellier. The historian uses private archives, in particular those of Francisque Gay and Charles Maurras. It reveals in particular a correspondence of sixteen letters between Charles Maurras and the President of the Republic Raymond Poincaré between 1918 and 1925. Eugen Weber explains that these exchanges are those of allies and that Maurras had no direct influence on the president. He uses the police reports kept at the National Archives and has special authorization to use the bundles of the period 1914-1939 unlike the historian Frank Tannenbaum who publishes a book on the same subject the same year.\nReception\nThe book is immediately authoritative on the subject. It is hailed as the \"starting point for useful backtracking\" as \"a first solid synthesis on this major question\".\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
