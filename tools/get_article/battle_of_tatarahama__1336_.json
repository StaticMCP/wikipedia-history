It was decisive in securing control of the island of Kyūshū for the Northern Imperial Court, which was closely connected to the Ashikaga shogunate.\nPrelude\nEarly in 1336, a number of Kyūshū clans, anticipating the movements of the shōgun's army against them, made efforts to unite and present a formidable resistance. A number of skirmishes were fought against clans loyal to the shōgun on the island, including a siege of Dazaifu, in which the Shōni clan stronghold was taken. Shōni Sadatsune fled, but was defeated soon afterwards, and committed suicide along with a number of his retainers.\nShōgun Ashikaga Takauji, arriving in Munakata, a short distance away, at this time in early April, learned of the siege of Dazaifu and the death of Shōni Sadatsune.\nGathering forces, he marched from Munakata on April 15, and journeyed to Tatarahama,  away, where he met the Kikuchi clan army. This army included Aso, Mihara, and Kuroki, all under the command of Kikuchi Taketoshi.\nBattle\nThe military chronicle Baishō-ron describes Tatarahama as \"a stretch of over  of dry foreshore, crossed at the south end by a small stream. The precincts of the Hakozaki Hachiman Shrine consist of some five square miles of pine forest. To the south lies the city of Hakata, on the east five or six miles distant is hilly country, and to the west is the open sea stretching as far as China.\"\nBy the end of the battle, the Kikuchi clan forces had been chased by Ashikaga Tadayoshi to Dazaifu, at which point they fled into the hills. The Aso and Akizuki clan commanders committed suicide, and other commanders simply surrendered.\nTakauji rewarded his commanders for their bravery and service, but offered pardon to his opponents, and to several clans not participating in the battle, who thus joined him in its aftermath. Kyūshū thus became united under the shogunate, and the Northern Imperial Court.\nReferences\nSee also\n*Battle of Tatarahama (1569)"
