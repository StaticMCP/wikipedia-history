      "text": "# King's Scholar (Westminster School)\n\nThe '''Kings's Scholarships (or Queen's Scholarships') are currently forty-eight scholarships (eight per year until Sixth Form, then twelve per year) at Westminster School, (re)founded in 1560 by Queen Elizabeth I. The scholars take part in each coronation in Westminster Abbey, acclaiming the new monarch by shouting \"Vivat\".  They also have the right to observe the House of Commons. Their house is \"College\", and they have the abbreviation KS (or QS) on school lists.\nTwelve- and thirteen-year-old boys annually compete for eight of the annual scholarships in a competitive entrance examination known as the Challenge. Fifteen- and sixteen-year-old girls compete for the other four scholarships, which are awarded to the top four students in subject-specific Sixth Form entrance exams. For 400 years the best of the scholars were elected to closed scholarships at Christ Church, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cambridge; since the early 1970s, Westminster School boys and girls must win open Oxbridge scholarships by public examination.\nPrior to 2017, only 40 scholarships were awarded to boys sitting the Challenge examination. The four Sixth Form girls' scholarships were added in 2017.\nDuring the reign of a queen, the King's Scholars become Queen's Scholars, in contrast to the King's Scholarships at Eton College who retain that title in honour of their royal founder even when the current monarch is a queen.\nNotable King's or Queen's Scholars\n*Richard Hakluyt (1553–1616), Elizabethan writer\n*George Herbert (1593–1633), poet and priest\n*William Cartwright (1611–1643), poet and dramatist\n*Abraham Cowley (1618–1667), poet\n*John Dryden (1631–1700), poet and playwright\n*John Locke (1632–1704), philosopher\n*Robert South (1634–1716), priest and Latin poet\n*Robert Hooke (1635–1703), scientist and polymath\n*Warren Hastings (1732–1818), Governor of Calcutta\n*George Cotton (1813–1866), headmaster and Bishop\n*A.
