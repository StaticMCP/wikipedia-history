It was his first solo release, as he had left his role as lead singer of the band Restless Heart a year before. The album was released in 1993 on RCA Records Nashville and it produced three singles for him on the Billboard country charts: \"Alright Already\" at number five, \"I'll Cry Tomorrow\" at number 34 and \"We Can Love\" at number 62. Also included is \"When I Close My Eyes\", a number two hit in 1997 for Kenny Chesney.\nBrian Mansfield of Allmusic rated the album four stars out of five, saying that he considered it more country than Stewart's work in Restless Heart.\nTrack listing\n*AOmitted from cassette version.\nPersonnel\nCompiled from liner notes.\nMusicians\n* Eddie Bayers — drums\n* Suzy Bogguss — background vocals\n* Larry Byrom — electric guitar\n* Bruce C.
