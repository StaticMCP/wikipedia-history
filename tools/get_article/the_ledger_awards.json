Initially, the awards were held annually and announced online on or around Australia Day, 26 January. In recent years, they have been held at the State Library of Victoria on the Friday evening before the Melbourne Supanova convention.\nHistory\nThe Ledger Awards began in 2004 as a fully independent, non-profit initiative. They were presented under the auspices of LitterArtsy, a non-profit coalition of creators, publishers and web sites promoting literacy, creativity, craft and excellence through comics and sequential art, and had no affiliations or links with organisations, businesses, or other parties.\nThe Ledger Awards were presented annually until 2007, when they went on hiatus. In 2010 it was announced that a new Ledger Awards Organising Committee had been formed; the Committee held an inaugural meeting, with a view to the awards being re-established in 2011.\nIn late 2013 it was announced that the Ledger Awards would return after a five-year hiatus in April 2014, with a new major sponsor, Supanova Pop Culture Expo. The 2014 Ledger Awards ceremony was held 11 April 2014, at the State Library of Victoria.\nOn 12 April 2014 the Ledger Awards named \"gap year\" award recipients for the years 2008–2013 when no Ledger Awards were distributed.\nAwards\n2004\nNominees were suggested through a forum thread, compiled into a poll and winners were decided by popular vote.
