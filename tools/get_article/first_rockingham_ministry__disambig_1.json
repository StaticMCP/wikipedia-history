The government was made up mainly of his followers known as the Rockingham Whigs. The most influential member of the government was Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, a former prime minister, who served as Lord Privy Seal. It is often referred to as the only government ever to have been made up almost entirely of members of the Jockey Club, with Rockingham himself being a prominent patron and follower of the turf. Rockingham was noted for his ignorance of foreign affairs, and his ministry failed to reverse the growing isolation of Britain within Europe .\nThe Rockingham ministry fell in 1766 and was replaced by one headed by William Pitt, later the Earl of Chatham.\nCabinet\n:\n| minister1             = Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham\n| minister1_termstart   =\n| minister1_termend     =\n| minister1_ministryhead= y\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n| minister2             = Henry Seymour Conway\n| minister2_termstart   =\n| minister2_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1             = Henry Seymour Conway\n| minister1_termstart   =\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\n| minister1_termend     =\n}}\nChanges\n*October 1765 – The Duke of Cumberland (also the uncle of King George III) dies.\n*May 1766 – The Duke of Grafton resigns from the cabinet.
