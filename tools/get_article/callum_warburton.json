He made his first team debut as extra-time substitute, for Adam Rundle in Rochdale's 0–0 draw away to Hartlepool United, a game which Hartlepool eventually won 4–2 on penalties. His league debut came in the 1–0 defeat at home to Peterborough United on 9 December 2006 and he remained in the side until the end of the year.
