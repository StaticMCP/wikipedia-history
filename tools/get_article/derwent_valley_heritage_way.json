The walk starts from Ladybower Reservoir in the Peak District National Park via Chatsworth, the scenery around the Derbyshire Dales, and through the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. It follows the Riverside Path through Derby and continues onwards to the historic inland port of Shardlow. Journey's end is at Derwent Mouth where the River Derwent flows into the River Trent.\nThe walk was established by The Derwent Valley Trust, which was set up in 1996. The route was planned and developed by Derbyshire Countryside Ranger, Rick Jillings. The Duke of Devonshire opened the walk at Chatsworth House in 2003.\nRoute\nPlaces on the route and highlights on or near the trail:\nLadybower Reservoir to Baslow\n*Ladybower Reservoir: Heatherdene car park\n*Thornhill\n* Mytham Bridge\n* Shatton Bridge over the River Noe\n* Leadmill Bridge\n*Hathersage\n*Grindleford\n*Froggatt: Froggatt Woods, Froggatt Bridge\n*Calver: Calver Bridge\n* Bubnell\nBaslow to Matlock\n*Baslow\n* Chatsworth Park: Chatsworth House\n* Calton Lees\n*Rowsley\n*River Wye\n* Caudwell's Mill\n* Churchtown\n*Darley Bridge\n*Cawdor Quarry\nMatlock to Belper\n*Matlock: Hall Leys Park, Bentley Brook\n*Matlock Bath\n* High Tor summit: Derwent Gorge\n*Heights of Abraham cable car\n*Masson Mill\n*Cromford: Pavilion, Arkwright’s Cromford Mill\n*Cromford Canal: High Peak Junction, Leawood Pump House\n*Whatstandwell\n*Ambergate: River Amber\n* The Birches (Woodland Trust wood)\n* North and East Mills\nBelper to Derby\n*Belper\n* Coppice Brook\n*Makeney\n* Duffield Bridge\n* Peckwash Mill\n* Rigga Quarry\n*Little Eaton\n*Darley Abbey: Darley Abbey Mills, toll bridge\n*Darley Park\n* Derby Riverside Path at Handyside Bridge\n*Derby Silk Mill\n* River Gardens\nDerby to Derwent Mouth\n*Derby: Pride Park, Alvaston Park\n*Elvaston Castle Country Park\n*Borrowash: Borrowash Bridge\n*Ambaston\n*Shardlow: Heritage Centre, Clock Warehouse\n*Trent and Mersey Canal\n*Derwent Mouth: Derwent Mouth Lock, River Trent\nAccess\nTrain stations: Bamford, Hathersage, Rowsley South, Darley Dale, Matlock, Matlock Bath, Cromford, Whatstandwell, Ambergate, Belper, Duffield, Derby.\nThe route is covered by 4 OS Explorer maps:\n* OL1 - The Peak District (Dark Peak)\n* OL24 - The Peak District (White Peak)\n* 259 - Derby\n* 260 - Nottingham\nConnected paths: Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk, Centenary Way (Derbyshire), High Peak Trail, Midshires Way.\nThe official guide book is 'The Derwent Valley Heritage Way' published by Bannister Publications, 2ed, 2014.\nExternal links\n*[https://www.derwentvalleytrust.org.uk/ Official Site of the Derwent Valley Heritage Way]\n*[http://www.derwentvalleymills.org/ Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site]\nReferences"
