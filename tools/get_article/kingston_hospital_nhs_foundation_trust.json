The Trust was licensed as an NHS Foundation Trust by Monitor (NHS) from 1 May 2013. The Trust has been rated 'outstanding' by the CQC.\nServices\nThe Trust serves approximately 320,000 people in Kingston, Richmond, Roehampton, Putney, East Elmbridge and other parts of South West London. It directly employs some 2,750 staff with another 300 staff employed by contractors but working on behalf of the Trust.\nThe trust broke from the national pay agreement in August 2015 by giving a 1% pay rise to its 22 senior non-clinical staff - those earning above £57,069 - in line with the award for the rest of the staff.  The trust does not qualify for London weighting and was worried that it would lose senior managers.\nPerformance\nIt spent 9% of its total turnover on agency staff in 2014/5.\nThe trust relied on a working capital facility arrangement made to qualify for Foundation Trust status with Lloyds Bank to pay staff each month from April 2016 until it negotiated a £10 million loan from the Department of Health in 2017.\nSee also\n* List of hospitals in England\n* List of NHS trusts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingstonhospital.nhs.uk Kingston Hospital NHS Trust]\n*[http://www.borntoosoon.org.uk Born Too Soon Appeal]\n*[http://www.sexualhealthkingston.co.uk The Wolverton Centre at Kingston Hospital]"
