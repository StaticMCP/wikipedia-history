      "text": "# List of Ancient Aliens episodes\n\nAncient Aliens is an American television series that explores the pseudoscientific ancient astronauts hypothesis, as well as other pseudoscientific and pseudohistoric topics such as advanced ancient civilizations, extraterrestrial contact and ufology, and alleged conspiracy theories, in a non-critical documentary format. Episodes begin and end with rhetorical questions which frame the explored topics. The series has aired on History and other A&E Networks since 2010, and has been a target for criticism of History's channel drift, and criticism for promoting unorthodox or unproven hypotheses as fact. All episodes are narrated by Robert Clotworthy. The series is produced by Prometheus Entertainment.\nThe series is based on and inspired by the works of Erich von Däniken and Zecharia Sitchin, among other writers. The works of Graham Hancock, Robert Bauval, Brinsley Trench, Charles Hapgood, and Edgar Cayce are also referenced in many episodes. Producer Giorgio Tsoukalos and writer David Childress are often featured as guests.\nThe series began as a two-hour documentary special in 2009 and continued for three seasons as a flagship series on History. Seasons 4 to 7 aired on H2, with frequent re-airings of episodes on History and other A&E services. In 2015, the series returned to History after H2 was relaunched as Vice on TV. Season 15 premiered in 2020. The series continued with its sixteenth season in November 2020.\nSeries overview\n|color1 = dadde3\n|link1 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 1 (2009–10)\n|episodes1 = 5\n|start1 =\n|end1 =\n|color2 = ffc8bd\n|link2 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 2 (2010)\n|episodes2 = 10\n|start2 =\n|end2 =\n|color3 = ffc894\n|link3 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 3 (2011)\n|episodes3 = 16\n|start3 =\n|end3 =\n|color4 = fecc44\n|link4 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 4 (2012)\n|episodes4 = 10\n|start4 =\n|end4 =\n|color5 = b9debc\n|link5 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 5 (2012–13)\n|episodes5 = 12\n|start5 =\n|end5 =\n|color6 = aedfcd\n|link6 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 6 (2013)\n|episodes6 = 11\n|start6 =\n|end6 =\n|color7 = cbd6f6\n|link7 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 7 (2014)\n|episodes7 = 8\n|start7 =\n|end7 =\n|color8 = d9d0e9\n|link8 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 8 (2014)\n|episodes8 = 9\n|start8 =\n|end8 =\n|color9 = e6cede\n|link9 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 9 (2014–15)\n|episodes9 = 12\n|start9 =\n|end9 =\n|color10 = e8cecd\n|link10 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 10 (2015)\n|episodes10 = 10\n|start10 =\n|end10 =\n|color11 = c8ccd1\n|link11 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 11 (2016)\n|episodes11 = 15\n|start11 =\n|end11 =\n|color12 = fea898\n|link12 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 12 (2017)\n|episodes12 = 16\n|start12 =\n|end12 =\n|color13 = ffa758\n|link13 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 13 (2018–19)\n|episodes13 = 15\n|start13 =\n|end13 =\n|color14 = eeb533\n|link14 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 14 (2019)\n|episodes14 = 22\n|start14 =\n|end14 =\n|color15 = 94cb9a\n|link15 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 15 (2020)\n|episodes15 = 12\n|start15 =\n|end15 =\n|color16 = 80cdb3\n|link16 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 16 (2020–21)\n|episodes16 = 10\n|start16 =\n|end16 =\n|color17 = b0c1f0\n|link17 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 17 (2021)\n|episodes17 = 7\n|start17 =\n|end17 =\n|color18 = c5b9dd\n|link18 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 18 (2022)\n|episodes18 = 20\n|start18 =\n|end18 =\n|color19 = d9b4cd\n|link19 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 19 (2023)\n|episodes19 = 20\n|start19 =\n|end19 =\n|color20 = dcb5b3\n|link20 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 20 (2024)\n|episodes20 = 20\n|start20 =\n|end20 =\n|color21 = a2a9b1\n|link21 = List of Ancient Aliens episodes#Season 21 (2025)\n|episodes21 = 10\n|start21 =\n|end21 = —\n}}\nBroadcast episodes\nList of episodes broadcast using the Ancient Aliens title card.
