Her hometown was Cheoldong, Songgyeong (modern-day Kaeseong, North Korea).\nShe became an ascendant through her grandfather's older brother's descendants. Min Yu eventually became the 12th great-grandfather to Queen Inhyeon, 16th great-grandfather to Princess Consort Min (Heungseon Daewongun's mother), the 17th great-grandfather to Grand Internal Princess Consort Sunmok (Heungseon Daewongun's wife) and Empress Myeongseong, and the 18th great-grandfather to Empress Sunmyeong.\nShe was a first cousin once removed to Royal Noble Consort Hui-bi of the Paepyeong Yun clan, a Consort of King Chunghye of Goryeo. As well as a fourth cousin twice removed of Queen Jeongan through her 5th great-grandfather's brother.\nThrough her great-grandfather, Lady Min was also a first cousin thrice removed of Royal Noble Consort Myeong, the consort of her husband, King Taejong, and a first cousin four times removed of Crown Princess Consort Hwi, the consort of her grandson, King Munjong.\nThrough her mother, Lady Min was a fourth cousin once removed of Han Hwak, and fifth cousins with Queen Jangsun and Queen Gonghye.\nShe was later arranged to marry the fifth son of Yi Sŏnggye and his first wife Lady Han of the Anbyeon Han clan, the 15-year-old Yi Pangwŏn of the Jeonju Yi clan, in 1382 at the age of 17. Ten years later when the Joseon Dynasty was established in 1392 by her father-in-law, her husband was then given the royal title of Prince Chŏngan; making her Princess Chŏngnyŏng () at the age of 27.\nInvolvement in royal politics\nIn 1394, the capital was established from Kaegyeong (modern-day Kaeseong) to Hanseong (modern-day Seoul). When the new dynasty was promulgated and officially brought into existence, Taejo brought up the issue of which son would be his successor. Although Taejo's fifth son by Queen Sinui, Yi Pangwŏn, had contributed most to assisting his father's rise to power, he harbored a profound hatred against two of his father's key allies in the court, the prime minister Chŏng Tojŏn and Nam Ŭn.\nIn 1398, Chŏng Tojŏn, who was enjoying great power at the time, enforced the Enforcement Breakdown Act and returned all the private soldiers and weapons to the state, but Lady Min had hid the weapons and private soldiers, that belonged to her family, in her house. Shortly after Taejo fell ill, the Min clan took advantage of this opportunity to give the weaponry and resources to Yi Pangwŏn to which Lady Min tried to encourage his coup.\nYi Pangwŏn then rose up with his brother-in-laws, Min Mugu and Min Mujil, and immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Chŏng Tojŏn, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok, Grand Prince Uian and Yi Pangbŏn.\nThis incident became known as the First Strife of Princes. Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the crown, and psychologically exhausted from the death of his second wife, King Taejo immediately crowned his second son Yi Bang-gwa, later King Jeongjong, as the new ruler.\nIn early 1400, the Second Strife of Princes happened where Yi Panggan, Prince Hoean, the elder brother of the prince Chŏngan, launched an attack on Prince Chŏngan. With Prince Chŏngan, Lady Min and her family fought to bring down Prince Hoean and his supporters.\nOn 4 March 1400, King Jeongjong pronounced his brother Yi Pangwŏn as heir presumptive and voluntarily abdicated. Which changed her royal title from Princess Chŏngnyŏng to Crown Princess Consort Chŏng (), and was eventually given the royal title of Queen Chŏng () on 10 January 1401. Thus becoming the Queen Consort of King Taejong of Joseon, the third king of Joseon.\nBecause she was the wife of a king, her mother was given the royal title of \"Grand Lady Samhan'guk\" (), but was later given an alternative title, \"Internal Princess Consort Sunhŭng\". Her father was given the royal title of \"Internal Prince Yŏhŭng\" ().\nQueen Chŏng is described as smart and ambitious and with an astute political ambition, who frequently intervened in state affairs. She assisted her spouse in his way to the throne and convinced him to appoint their eldest son Yangnyeong as crown prince. When he replaced their son as crown prince with his younger brother, Queen Chŏng was enraged and her interference finally resulted in King Taejong executing her younger brothers in order to keep her and her family's ambition in check.\nExile and death of family\nIn 1406, Taejong had brought up the topic of abdicating but withdrew his statement later on. In the process, the Queen's eldest and younger brothers Min Mugu and Min Mujil had voiced that they were very pleased with the news of Taejong's abdication, which caused the two men to be exiled to Jeju Island where they were later killed in 1410. In 1408, Min Che, the Queen's father, who had a hard time coping with the exile of his sons, died that same year.\nIt was during these times that the Queen's relationship with her husband was worsening with the concubines he brought to the palace due to alliances he formed with their clans. It worsened a lot more when Queen Chŏng didn't tell Taejong about the birth of their daughter, Princess Jeongseon, in 1404. It has been said that her attitude was why the king avoided her living quarters, but records do state that the royal couple did have two more sons in 1405 and 1407.\nIn 1416, the Queen's remaining younger brothers, Min Muhyul and Min Muhoe, had stated that Crown Prince Che (later Grand Prince Yangnyeong), her eldest son, would take great care of their family as he and their family shared a close family relationship. Word spread and reached Taejong who saw it as a threat, which once again brought the brothers to be exiled and die by suicide poisoning.\nBut it is also said that rumors had spread through the palace that Queen Chŏng had abused Taejong's concubine, Royal Noble Hyo of the Cheongpung Kim clan, and her son, Prince Gyeongnyeong. In anger and retaliation, Taejong exiled Min Muhyul and Min Muhoe nearby the sea breeze and hung them to death nearby rather than dethroning Queen Chŏng from her position.\nLater life\nIn 1418, her husband abdicated and gave the throne to their third son, Sejong of Joseon, but continued to rule with an iron fist for 3 years, deciding important matters and executing his son's father-in-law Sim On in 1419, and two uncle-in-law's in 1418.\nThus becoming Queen Dowager Hudŏk while her husband became King Emeritus of Joseon. Her reign as Queen Dowager did not last long as it only lasted for 2 years from 9 September 1418 to her death; almost hitting the 3rd year mark.\nQueen Dowager Hudŏk, who made her husband king, but whose brothers were purged in return, died on August 27, 1420 at the age of 55 in Byeoljeon Hall, Suganggung. King Taejong outlived her by two years and they are buried together within Heonreung in Seocho District. Seoul.\nIt's said that within the queens who were involved in Joseon Dynasty politics, Queen Wŏn'gyŏng, along with Queen Munjeong, Queen Myeongseong, and Empress Myeongseong, was considered the most political, bold and broad-minded Queen of her time.\nFamily\nParent\n* Father\n** Min Che, Duke Mundo, Internal Prince Yŏhŭng (; 1339 – 15 January 1408)\n* Mother\n** Princess Consort Samhan'guk of the Yeosan Song clan (; 1342–1414); Min Che's first wife\nSibling(s)\n* Older sister — Princess Consort Samhan'guk of the Yeoheung Min clan (; 1358–?)\n* Older brother — Min Mugu, Prince Yŏgang (; 1360 – 17 March 1410)\n* Older sister — Lady Min (; 1363–?)\n* Younger brother — Min Mujil, Prince Yeoseong (; 1369 – 17 March 1410)\n* Younger brother — Min Muhyul, Prince Yeowon (; 1371 – 13 January 1416)\n* Younger brother - Min Muhoe, Prince Yeosan (; 1373 – 13 January 1416)\n* Younger sister — Lady Min (; 1378–?)\nConsort\n* Yi Pangwŏn, King Taejong (; 13 June 1367 – 30 May 1422)\nIssue\n4 daughters and 8 sons:\n* Princess Jeongsun (; 1385 – 18 September 1460)\n* Princess Gyeongjeong (; 1387 – 29 June 1455)\n* Grand Prince Yi Il-nam (; 1389)\n* Grand Prince Yi Yi-nam (; 1390)\n* Grand Prince Yi Sam-nam (; 1392)\n* Princess Gyeongan (; 1393 – 8 June 1415)\n* Yi Je, Grand Prince Yangnyeong (; 1394 – 8 November 1462)\n* Yi Bo, Grand Prince Hyoryeong (; 29 January 1396 – 22 June 1486)\n* Yi Do, King Sejong the Great (; 15 May 1397 – 30 March 1450)\n* Princess Jeongseon (; 1404 – 5 March 1424)\n* Yi Jong, Grand Prince Seongnyeong (; 12 August 1405 – 20 March 1418)\n* Yi Chung, Grand Prince (; 1407–1453)\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Kim Young-ran in the 1983 TV series The King of Chudong Palace.\n* Portrayed by Choi Myung-gil in the 1996–98 TV series Tears of the Dragon and in the 2008 TV series The Great King, Sejong.\n* Portrayed by Kang Se-jung in the 2014 TV series Jeon Do-jeon.\n* Portrayed by Im Ye-jin in the 2015 TV series Splash Splash Love.\n* Portrayed by Gong Seung-yeon in the 2015–16 TV series Six Flying Dragons.\n* Portrayed by Kim Sa-hee in the 2015 film Empire of Lust.\n* Portrayed by Seo Young-hee in the 2021 TV series Joseon Exorcist.\n* Portrayed by Park Jin-hee in the 2021–22 TV series The King of Tears, Lee Pangwŏn.\n* Portrayed by Cha Joo-young in the 2025 tvN series, The Queen Who Crowns.\nSee also\n* King Taejo\n* Empress Myeongseong\n* Queen Inhyeon\n* King Sejong\n*King Jeongjong\n* King Taejong\n* Empress Sunmyeong\n* Yeoheung Min clan\n*Grand Internal Princess Consort Sunmok\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}"
