The first Superior Court judge elected was Justin Jacobs, in the election of May 23, 1893. Judge Jacobs won re-election in 1894 and served until his death on September 18, 1898; he was succeeded by M.L. Short, who won his re-election campaign in 1890. Judge Short was succeeded by John G. Covert in 1906, who won his race by six votes.\nA new county courthouse was authorized in 1896; the construction contract was awarded to John Haggerty on May 13, 1896, for $26,364. The architect responsible was William H. Wilcox. An addition completed in 1914 was built by Trewhitt-Shields to a design by J. Carl Thayer & Henri Dorlot.\nVenues\n|float=right\n|zoom=10\n|width=500 |height=400\n|scalemark=10\n|shape1=n-circle\n|shape-color1=#a0a\n|shape-outline1=#fff\n|mark-size1=14\n|mark-coord1 =\n|mark-title1 =114 W 8th St (Hanford, 1896/1914)\n|mark-coord2 =\n|mark-title2 =1426 South Dr (Hanford, 1977)\n|mark-coord3 = |shape-color3=#00a\n|mark-title3 =1640 Kings Cty Dr (Hanford, 2016)\n|mark-coord4 =\n|mark-title4 =501 E Kings St (Avenal)\n|mark-coord5 =\n|mark-title5 =1000 Chittenden Ave (Corcoran)\n|mark-coord6 =\n|mark-title6 =449 C St (Lemoore)\n|fullscreen-option=1\n|caption=Kings County Superior Court locations:\n|auto-caption=1\n}}\nThe original 1896 courthouse was expanded in 1914 and served as the county courthouse until 1977, when operations moved to the new County Center in Hanford. The 1896/1914 courthouse now hosts a commercial development with shops and restaurants called Courthouse Square. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\nCourt operations were consolidated in a single new building on February 16, 2016; the new building consolidates operations from five separate buildings, including the family law court, which was held in Lemoore. The 2016 courthouse has a gross floor area of  and 12 courtrooms.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
