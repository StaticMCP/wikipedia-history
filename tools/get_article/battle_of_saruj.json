The Atruqids, led by Belek Ghazi, defeated and captured Joscelin I, Count of Edessa.\nBackground\nIn the year 1122, the Artuqid emir, Ilghazi, resumed his war against the crusaders in late June. Ilghazi was joined by his nephew Belek Ghazi and was joined again by Toghtekin. Together they attacked the Principality of Antioch. King Baldwin II of Jerusalem was in Tripoli enforcing the rule of Pons, Count of Tripoli. When Baldwin heard of the invasion, he rode out with a relief force. Ilghazi was forced to retreat, and no military engagement happened. Ilghazi got ill and withdrew to Aleppo, while Toghtekin withdrew to Damascus. Belek soon went home to his emirate near Malatya. Belek marched towards the territory of the County of Edessa. When Joscelin I heard of Belek's passing, he set out with a force of 100 knights to intercept him.\nBattle\nHearing of the Crusader force coming to meet him, Belek was prepared to meet him in battle. Belek's troops numbered 800 cavalry. Belek picked his battlefield, leading the Crusaders into a marshy territory after a long chase. The Crusaders ended in a low ground near a river. The Crusaders were stuck; their horses, which carried heavy armored knights, sank into the mud. The Turks then attacked the Crusaders with a barrage of arrows, killing many of them. Joscelin and other leaders surrendered and were captured by the Turks. They captured around 25 prisoners, while other sources state 60. The battle happened on September 13 near Suruç.\nAftermath\nThe capture of Joscelin was a notable victory for Belek, which gave him a reputation from contemporary writers. Belek's power grew further after the death of his uncle Ilghazi, after which he inherited his territory. Belek offered freedom for Joscelin if he were to surrender Edessa, but he refused. He took his prisoners to his fortress of Harpoot. Belek then continued to fight against the Crusaders. The capture of Joscelin forced Baldwin into a war against Belek to liberate the captured prisoners.\nReferences\nSources\n*Nicholas Morton (2018), The Field of Blood, The Battle for Aleppo and the Remaking of the Medieval Middle East.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/The_Field_of_Blood/ldQmDwAAQBAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Joscelin+september+1122&pg=PT128&printsec=frontcover]\n*William Barron Stevenson (1907), The Crusaders in the East: A Brief History of the Wars of Islam with the Latins in Syria During the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/The_Crusaders_in_the_East/_gugAAAAMAAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Joscelin+100+september+1122&pg=PA108&printsec=frontcover]\n*Galust Ter-Grigorian Iskenderian (1915), The Crusaders and their relations with the neighboring Armenian princes until the fall of the County of Edessa (In German).[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/Die_Kreuzfahrer_und_ihre_Beziehungen_zu/sb7V7VDbwa8C?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Joscelin+100+september+1122&pg=PA99&printsec=frontcover]\n*Steven Runciman (1987), A History of the Crusades, Vol II.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/A_History_of_the_Crusades/QL88AAAAIAAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Joseclin+Saruj+1122&pg=PA161&printsec=frontcover]"
