The younger reader winner was All-of-a-Kind Family Hanukkah by Emily Jenkins, illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky, the older reader winner was Sweep: The Story of a Girl and Her Monster by Jonathan Auxier, and the teen reader winner was What the Night Sings by Vesper Stamper.\nYALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction for Young Adults\nThe YALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction for Young Adults was given to The Unwanted: Stories of the Syrian Refugees written and illustrated by Don Brown. Four books were given honors:  The Beloved World of Sonia Sotomayor, by Sonia Sotomayor, ''Boots on the Ground: America's War in Vietnam, by Elizabeth Partridge, The Faithful Spy: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Plot to Kill Hitler, written and illustrated by John Hendrix, and Hey, Kiddo: How I Lost My Mother, Found My Father, and Dealt with Family Addiction'', written and illustrated by Jarrett J. Krosoczka.\nReaction and Reception\nHarperCollins and Penguin-Random House each won the most recognition with 11 citations each. Forty-seven of the award winners were women, while 30 were men. The Newbery and Caldecott winners were considered surprising as they were not on many of the lists of predicted winners. The omission of Dreamers, winner of the Belpre Illustrator award, from the Caldecott was also criticised. Newbery winner Meg Medina, who serves on the advisory board of the advocacy organization We Need Diverse Books was pleased to see the diversity of the winners. Elizabeth Acevedo whose The Poet X won recognition for both the Printz and Belpre awards was \"shaking\" after hearing about her Printz win and was shocked at her Belpre win, \"To get that honor is so special.\" Sophie Blackall said she was \"weeping\" when she learned she had won her second Caldecott Medal while visiting Myanmar.\nSee also\n[https://www.slj.com/?detailStory=slj-reviews-the-newbery-caldecott-and-printz-award-winners School Library Reviews of the Winners]\nNotes\nReferences"
