      "text": "# The King and I (1992 studio cast album)\n\nThe King and I is a studio cast recording of the musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein. The album was released by Philips Classics in 1992. Conducted by John Mauceri with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, the album stars Julie Andrews as Anna and Ben Kingsley as the King of Siam. The recording uses the orchestrations from the musical's 1956 film adaptation but restores three songs cut from the movie: \"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?\", \"My Lord and Master\", and \"I Have Dreamed\". Lea Salonga and Peabo Bryson sing Tuptim and Lun Tha, with Marilyn Horne singing \"Something Wonderful\".\nCritics noted Andrews' singing and the orchestral arrangements, while some felt the album was short of charm compared with earlier versions. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album and reached number one on the Billboard classical crossover albums chart.\nAlbum details\nConducted by John Mauceri with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, the album features Julie Andrews as Anna and Ben Kingsley as the King of Siam. This recording marks the first time Andrews performed the role professionally. The project represented a return to musical theater for Julie Andrews, who had been absent from the genre for many years. For Ben Kingsley, it marked a rare foray into musical performance.\nThe recording uses the orchestrations from the musical's 1956 film adaptation, restoring three songs cut from the movie: \"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You\", \"My Lord and Master\", and \"I Have Dreamed\". The supporting cast includes Lea Salonga and Peabo Bryson as Tuptim and Lun Tha, with Marilyn Horne singing \"Something Wonderful\".\nReleased on CD, cassette, and vinyl (in Europe only), the album incorporates spoken dialogue from the musical to maintain the dramatic structure of the musical. Its creation was part of a larger celebration of Rodgers and Hammerstein's work, timed to coincide with the 80th anniversary of their first collaboration, Oklahoma!.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev2Score = C\n}}\nWilliam Ruhlmann from AllMusic rated the album four out of five stars and called it \"the exception to the many opera-singers-doing-a-musical recreations\", praising Andrews' \"brilliant\" singing and Kingsley's \"contemporary, distanced cool\". The review also highlighted Mauceri’s orchestral choices.\nLinda Sanders from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, criticizing its perceived lack of charm. She said Ben Kingsley fails to match Yul Brynner's iconic King, while Julie Andrews plays Anna more like a stern leader than a warm governess. The star-studded cast, she argued, ultimately weakens the magic of the classic musical.\nTheatre writer John Kenrick praised the studio cast recording chiefly due to Julie Andrews' \"magical\" performance as Anna. He also admired John Mauceri's orchestrations with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, particularly their performance of \"Shall We Dance\", which he felt surpassed the original film version. Kenrick recommended the recording as an indispensable addition to any musical theater collection.\nAwards\nThe cast recording was nominated for the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in the category of Best Musical Show Album.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Awards and nominations for The King and I\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"; rowspan=\"1\" | 1993\n| 35th Annual Grammy Awards\n| Best Musical Show Album\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nCommercial performance\nThe album debuted on the US Billboard 200 at #135 on October 24, 1992, and spent four weeks on the chart.
