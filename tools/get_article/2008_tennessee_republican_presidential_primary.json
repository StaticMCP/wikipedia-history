Mike Huckabee narrowly defeated John McCain to win the largest share of Tennessee's delegates to the 2008 Republican National Convention.  Both McCain and the third-place candidate Mitt Romney received delegates along with Huckabee.\nAt 10:15 PM ET on February 5, the Associated Press reported that with 44% of precincts reporting Huckabee and McCain were tied with about one-third of the vote each. Earlier, with 31% of precincts in, McCain had 34% support, Huckabee 31%, Romney 23% and Paul 6% support.\nThe City Paper reported that voter turnout could beat the state's record of 830,000 in 1988 when Al Gore was on the presidential ballot for the first time.\nAP exit polls showed that Huckabee did well with born-again Christians and conservatives.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+100% of precincts reporting\n|-\n!
