The first was laid down in August 1917. The second, nearby, was begun in 1917. After the armistice, battlefield graves were consolidated between the two, creating one enlarged cemetery.\nThe cemetery was designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield.\nNotable graves\nSouth African-born Captain Clement Robertson VC is buried in this cemetery. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for valour on 4 October 1917 at Zonnebeke.\nSergeant Colin Blythe of the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, an exceptional spin bowler who had played for Kent and England and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1904.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&CRid=1966578 Oxford Road Cemetery] at Find a Grave"
