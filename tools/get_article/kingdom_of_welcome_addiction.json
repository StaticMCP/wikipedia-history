      "text": "# Kingdom of Welcome Addiction\n\n}}\nKingdom of Welcome Addiction is the third studio album by IAMX, released on 19 May 2009.\nChris Corner described Kingdom of Welcome Addiction as being \"like Disney World but with lipstick, cynicism and wit\". It is the first IAMX album not to feature the vocals of Sue Denim, as well as being the first not to include any SP4 tracks.\nThe album was given to journalists to review but one journalist leaked it online in April and the album dispatch was also delayed.  However, as an apology those who ordered it from Boutique IAMX were treated to an acoustic version of 'Running' which Chris filmed in a corridor of his own apartment building.  This clip was later included on the CD-ROM of 'My Secret Friend'.\nTrack listing\n* Track 4 co-written by Imogen Heap\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Chart\n!
