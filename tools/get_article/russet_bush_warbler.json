Formerly placed in the \"Old World warbler\" assemblage, it is now placed in the newly recognized family Locustellidae. B. mandelli was until recently considered a subspecies of B. seebohmi, and the name \"russet bush warbler\" was applied to the entire species complex. After this was split up, Benguet bush warbler was proposed as a new name for B. seebohmi proper. The species is found in southeast Asia.\nThe scientific name commemorates the Italian naturalist Louis Mandelli.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Russet Bush Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Russet bush warbler\n}}"
