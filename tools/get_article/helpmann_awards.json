Over forty awards are given to productions, festivals and concerts, and for individuals for their work in performance, direction, choreography, lighting, sound, music, costume and scenic design.\nThey are named in honour of ballet dancer, choreographer, director and actor Sir Robert Helpmann.\nThe awards are the Australian equivalent of the United States' Tony Awards for Broadway theatre and the United Kingdom's Laurence Olivier Awards for West End theatre.\nThe Helpmann Awards were last awarded in 2019. LPA cancelled the 2020 and 2021 awards due to the COVID-19 pandemic. No public statement has been made for subsequent years.\nHistory\nThe Helpmann Awards were established in 2001 by the Australian Entertainment Industry Association (now known as Live Performance Australia (LPA)). They are named in honour of Australian actor, choreographer, dancer and theatre director, Sir Robert Helpmann.\nAt the inaugural Helpmann Awards, twenty six accolades were handed out for achievements in performance, direction, choreography, lighting, sound, music, costume and scenic design and production, in the disciplines of musical theatre, contemporary music, comedy, opera, classical music, theatre, dance and physical theatre. Over the years the categories expanded and now include many more honours.\nAims and description\nThe aim of the awards is to promote Australia's live entertainment industry, both locally and internationally, by: recognising artistic achievements; administering the awards with integrity; ensuring the awards are celebrated by the industry and Australian community; and ensuring the ceremony is the most prestigious awards in the local industry and the highlight of each season.\nSpecial non-competitive prizes are also bestowed upon individuals: the JC Williamson Award (named after theatre manager James Cassius Williamson), for one's life's work in Australia's live entertainment industry. This is the highest honour presented by Live Performance Australia. Other special awards are the Sue Nattrass Award, which recognises outstanding achievement in a field without high public profile, the  Brian Stacey Memorial Award, and an award for Best Special Event.\nEligibility and voting\nTo be eligible for the Helpmann Awards, a production must: be produced or presented by an LPA Member, or professionally produced by a non-Member that has paid an Industry Service Fee for the production; fall within the artistic or industry award categories; and officially open in Australia during the season (or for Best Regional Touring Production Award, undertake its first Australian regional tour during the season).  Exemptions from the entry criteria can be granted in exceptional circumstances by a committee consisting of the LPA president, chief executive and chair of the Helpmann Awards Administration Committee (HAAC).\nNine nominating panels determine the nominees for their respective fields. These are: cabaret, children's presentation, comedy, contemporary music, dance and physical theatre, industry awards, musicals, opera and classical music, and theatre. The nominating panels comprises artists, creatives, arts administrators, writers, journalists, producers, promoters, venue managers and educators. The HAAC selects the chair of each panel, who in turn chooses the members of their respective fields. The nominations are then determined by each of them, who choose four per category. The winners are determined in a secret online ballot by the voters who are employees of LPA members, panelists and previous Helpmann winners and nominees.\nAward categories\nThe award categories are currently:\n;Theatre\n* Best Play\n* Best Direction of a Play\n* Best Male Actor in a Play\n* Best Female Actor in a Play\n* Best Male Actor in a Supporting Role – Play\n* Best Female Actor in a Supporting Role – Play\n;Musicals\n* Best Musical\n* Best Direction of a Musical\n* Best Choreography in a Musical\n* Best Male Actor in a Musical\n* Best Female Actor in a Musical\n* Best Male Actor in a Supporting Role – Musical\n* Best Female Actor in a Supporting Role – Musical\n;Opera and classical music\n* Best Opera\n* Best Symphony Orchestra Concert\n* Best Chamber and Instrumental Ensemble Concert\n* Best Direction of an Opera\n* Best Male Performer in an Opera\n* Best Female Performer in an Opera\n* Best Male Performer in a Supporting Role – Opera\n* Best Female Performer in a Supporting Role – Opera\n* Best Individual Classical Music Performance\n;Dance and physical theatre\n*Best Ballet\n*Best Dance Production\n* Best Visual or Physical Theatre Production\n* Best Choreography in a Dance or Physical Theatre Production\n* Best Male Dancer in a Dance or Physical Theatre Production\n* Best Female Dancer in a Dance or Physical Theatre Production\n;Contemporary music\n* Best International Contemporary Concert\n* Best Australian Contemporary Concert\n* Best Contemporary Music Festival\n;Other\n* Best Regional Touring Production\n* Best Comedy Performer\n* Best Cabaret Performer\n* Best Presentation for Children\n;Industry\n* Best New Australian Work\n* Best Original Score\n* Best Music Direction\n* Best Costume Design\n* Best Scenic Design\n* Best Lighting Design\n* Best Sound Design\n;Special awards\n* JC Williamson Award\n* Sue Nattrass Award\n* Brian Stacey Memorial Award\n* Best Special Event\n;Retired\n* Best Ballet or Dance Work\n*Best Classical Concert Presentation\n*Best Contemporary Concert Presentation\n*Best Live Music Presentation\n*Best Performance in an Australian Contemporary Concert\nCeremony\nThe annual Helpmann Awards ceremony is usually held between May and September.
