      "text": "# Anglo-Belgian Treaty of Commerce and Navigation\n\nThe Anglo-Belgian Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was a free trade agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Kingdom of Belgium, signed on 23 July 1862.\nIt was the first such treaty that rather than being time-limited and requiring renewal, contained an open-ended stipulation for withdrawal (technically known as \"denunciation\") that became a regular feature of later treaties of commerce (article 25):\nPrime Minister Salisbury gave notification of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the treaty on 28 July 1897, because a clause providing that Belgian goods be admitted to British colonies on the same footing as British goods was contrary to the new policy of Imperial Preference. This British \"denunciation\" was published in the Moniteur Belge of 1 August 1897.\nSee also\n*Cobden–Chevalier Treaty\n*Free trade agreements of the United Kingdom\nReferences"
