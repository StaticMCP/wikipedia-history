Directed by Tripp Reed, it stars Kevin Sorbo, A.J. Buckley, Haley Ramm, Bentley Mitchum, Jennifer Sipes, Brad Leland, Charles Baker and Marc Macaulay.\nThe film has a western theme with country and western music used in its score, representing a cliché story from western movies in a modern setting. Its main character's name is Nick Prescott, unlike the original's Buford Pusser or the remake's Chris Vaughn.\nPlot\nMarine Veteran Nick Prescott returns to his hometown. His father, who is the sheriff, tries to stand up against a brutal gang of ruthless criminals who intimidate and blackmail the people to sell them their business. He is then killed by the gang's leader Harvey Morris. With the help of an FBI agent and a few old friends, Nick himself becomes the sheriff, then vows to do everything in his power to destroy the gang and their ruthless leader, and win back his city. Eventually he shoots Morris and his gang and becomes the new sheriff of his hometown.\nCast\n* Kevin Sorbo as Nick Prescott\n* Haley Ramm as Samantha Jensen\n* Richard Dillard as Charlie Prescott\n* Gail Cronauer as Emma Prescott\n* Ntokozo Mntwini as Hap Worrell\n* A.J.
