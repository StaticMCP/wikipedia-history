The holotype was collected in Costa Rica and first described to science in 2002.\nEtymology\nThe binomial nomenclature references Schwarzenegger, because of the markedly developed '(biceps-like)' middle femora of the males. Erwin later remarked in an interview that his students had prepared an image of A. schwarzeneggeri and sent it out to Schwarzenegger himself: he signed it \"Thanks for thinking of me - Arnold\" and returned it.\nOther species in the genus named by Terry L. Erwin include Agra liv, named after Liv Tyler, and Agra katewinsletae, named after Kate Winslet.\nDescription\nAgra schwarzeneggeri measure  in length and  in width.\nSee also\n*List of organisms named after famous people (born 1925–1949)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20120723093559/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/09/tech/main4657330.shtml CBS News (9 December 2008)]\n*[http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/etym/people.html Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature]"
