She searched for submarines in coastal waters and for enemy offensive mines in those same areas. The warship also served as a training platform for minesweeping students based at Provincetown, Massachusetts.\nPost-war inactivation\nBulwark was placed out of service at the Boston Naval Shipyard on 18 June 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 3 July 1946, and she was sold to the city of Boston on 12 September 1946 and overhauled to become the MV Joseph J. Luna. As the MV Luna it served the Boston Fire Department in active service as Engine 47 then later as 31 until retirement in 1976. 1976 it was sold to a private citizen who used it as a houseboat until it sank into Boston Harbor in 2009.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
