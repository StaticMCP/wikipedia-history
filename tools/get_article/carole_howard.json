She said: \"It is a great honour to have been elected to the post of High Sheriff, and I pledge to serve the people of Belfast, and to support the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor in carrying out my duties to the best of my ability. I will continue to work hard for our city during my time as High Sheriff, and hope to bring a positive contribution to making Belfast a better and brighter city for all its citizens.\"\nShe was elected on the sixth count for the Titanic District at the 2019 election.\nIn December 2021, Howard joined the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), by asserting that she has pro-Union views and \"feel that I can now openly and comfortably express them to help promote a confident, progressive brand of unionism.\"  Leader Doug Beattie welcomed her to the party, saying: \"I am absolutely delighted that Carole has decided to join the Ulster Unionist Party. Carole is exactly the type of elected representative we want to attract, encourage and promote. She has a long-established track record of dedicated public service and I am glad that she wishes to continue that public service with the Ulster Unionist Party.\" Alliance described Howard's decision as \"an act of bad faith.\"\nShe unsuccessfully contested the Ormiston District at the 2023 local elections, being the last candidate eliminated, with 847 first-preference votes.\nReferences"
