The sibling duo wrote the song with Gabriella Scotto and Jack Schrepferman, while Schrepferman produced the track with Callum Maudsley. The song marked the duo's twelfth career top ten hit on the Canada Country chart.\nBackground\nIn a press release, Jenna Walker of the Reklaws stated that the duo was \"ready to get back to ourselves, to reminding people that no matter what life throws at you, good times will always come\" and that was what they set out to say with the release of \"Never Drinking Again\". The duo released the song \"We're Back Baby\" several weeks prior, and Stuart Walker remarked that they wanted to \"dedicate a summer to having more fun than ever before\" with the songs.\nCritical reception\nAileen Goos of Atwood Magazine referred to \"Never Drinking Again\" as a \"cheeky, catchy anthem\" that \"captures The Reklaws' trademark charm and party spirit\" and is \"perfect for summer nights, kitchen dance floors, and volume-all-the-way-up car rides.\" An uncredited article from Complete Country opined that the song \"feels true to the songs that made [the Reklaws] a household name across the nation.\"\nMusic video\nThe official visualizer video for \"Never Drinking Again\" was directed by Austin Chaffe and premiered on YouTube on May 23, 2025.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Chart performance for \"Never Drinking Again\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada (Canadian Hot 100)\n| 97\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada Country (Billboard)\n| 5\n|}\nReferences"
