It offered a public reward for the successful discovery of a Northwest Passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\nThe preamble to the act stated the expected economic benefits of the discovery of the passage, and that it would be \"a great encouragement to adventurers\" to offer a prize. The allocated sum was £20,000, to be paid to the owners of the first ships to successfully make such a passage.\nThe act established a group of commissioners to determine the validity of any claims, and restricted the scope of the act to only apply to British subjects. It further required all British subjects to provide help and assistance to the explorers when required.\nSubsequent developments\nThe whole act was repealed by section 9 of the Discovery of Longitude at Sea, etc. Act 1818 (58 Geo. 3. c. 20).\nNotes\nReferences\n*The statutes at large from the 15th to the 20th year of King George II [vol. XVIII]; Charles Bathurst, London. 1765.\n*Chronological table of the statutes; HMSO, London. 1993."
