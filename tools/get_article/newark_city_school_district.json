The district is the largest in Licking County, with nearly 6,500 students.\nDistrict history\nThe district was formed in 1848 after the passage of a voter petition to unify the schools in Newark under one system.  The first school board was elected on September 19, 1849.  A \"Negro school\" operated from 1859 until 1888 to provide segregated education to African American children in the Newark district.\nAt the request of the U.S. government in 1940, the district initiated industrial training programs that were intended to assist in national defense.  The shops operated 24 hours a day, six days a week, and after the attack on Pearl Harbor, became directly funded by the government to expand into a second building and thirty-five classes.  It has been estimated that the district trained 8,000 people between 1940 and 1945 with skills essential to the national defense industries.\n, three additional elementary schools and two middle schools are slated to begin construction.\nIn mid-2005 Newark City Schools began to phase out its former system of schooling. Under the former system, grades K-4th went to elementary school, grades 5th-6th went to intermediate school, 7th-8th went to middle school, and grades 9th-12th went to High School. Under the reformed system of schooling, grades K-5 go to elementary school, 6-8 goes to middle school, and 9-12 goes to high school. Former intermediate schools include Central Intermediate and West Main Intermediate. Central is now a private school and West Main is an apartment complex.\nThe elementary schools are William McGuffey, Carson, Cherry Valley, Hillview, John Clem and Legend Elementary Schools. The middle schools are Heritage (replaced Lincoln), Liberty Middle School (replaced Roosevelt) and Wilson Middle School.\nDistrict management\nThe district's Board of Education consists of five citizens elected to staggered four-year terms, with one president, one vice-president, and three members.  In addition to the general goal of educating the district's students, the Board has the specific duties of hiring the district's superintendent and treasurer, overseeing the annual budget, and approving contracts with district employees.  Board meetings are open to the public and held in the high school library.\nThe superintendent is directly responsible to the district Board of Education, and implements board policies.  S/he administers the district's educational programs and has final responsibility for curriculum, staffing, and evaluation.  All district employees are responsible to the superintendent, except for the treasurer, who is also a direct employee of the board.  In cooperation with the superintendent, the treasurer manages the district's financial, legal and contractual affairs.\nBoard of education\n*President - Pastor Timothy Carr\n*Vice President - Thomas Bline\n*Member - Warren Weber (MSgt USAF-Retired)\n*Member - Mark Christenberry\n*Member - Michael Blowers\nDistrict Administration\n*Superintendent of Schools- David Lewis (since 2020)\n*Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum & Staff Development- Maura Horgan\n*Assistant Superintendent for Certificated & Licensed Personnel- Barbara Quackenbush\n*District Treasurer/CFO - Julio Valladares\n*Assistant District Treasurer - Trent Montgomery\n*Athletic Director- Jeffery Quackenbush\n*Communications Coordinator- Seth Roy\n*Director of Classified Support Services- Mark Shively\n*Assistant Director of Curriculum for State and Federal Programs- Tara Boyer\n*Director of Transportation- Travis Workman\n*Assistant Director of Transportation- Lisa ‘Jersie’ Walcott\n*Director of Student Services- Melinda Vaughn\n*Special Education Coordinator- Jennifer McMahon (Preschool-5)\n*Special Education Coordinator- Nicole Garrison (6-12)\n*Special Education Coordinator- Mark Severance\n*Gifted Coordinator- Cathy Allen\n*Special Projects Coordinator- Gemma Zimmerman\n*Food Service Operations Supervisor- Todd Gallup\n*District Technology Supervisor- Amy Norman\n*Assistant Supervisor for Buildings, Grounds- Allen Fordham\n*District Nurse- Olivia Haas, RN (Preschool-5)\n*District Nurse- Heather Kee, RN (6-12)\n*District Wellness Coordinator- Ronni Bowyer\n*District Parent Mentor- Brittany Collins\nSchools\nNewark Digital Academy\nGrades K-12.
