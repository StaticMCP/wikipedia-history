In theory, Napoleon could count on 110 battalions and numerous cavalry, however, in practice many of the French battalions and squadrons numbered no more than 100 men and some were reduced to cadres, with entire regiments aligning no more than 10 men. In total, Napoleon had no more than 30,000 men available for the battle and not all of these men were committed. These men were divided in several army Corps, each under the command of a Marshal or very senior General of Division. At the battle of Hanau, only one division of MacDonald's XIth Corps and one division of Victor's IInd Corps were engaged, alongside the Guard infantry, cavalry and artillery.\nII Corps\nThe IInd Corps was under the command of Marshal Victor.
