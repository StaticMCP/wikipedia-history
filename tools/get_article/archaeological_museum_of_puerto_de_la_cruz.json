One of the most important local museums, it offers an archival collection comprising more than 2,600 specimens of the aboriginal Guanche culture, and a document collection named after researcher Luis Diego Cuscoy.\nThe Puerto de la Cruz museum has an enormous collection of aboriginal Guanche ceramics, including the remains of several ancient Guanche mummies. It contains several unique pieces native to the island, such as two limpet shells, a finding of Telesforo Bravo, and an anthropomorphic figure or clay idol known as \"Guatimac\".\nPhotos\nImage:El Guatimac.jpg|Guatimac, Guanche idol figurine.\nImage:Archaeological Museum of Puerto de la Cruz 04.jpg|Part two limpet shells that enclose small accounts as a jeweler.\nImage:Archaeological Museum of Puerto de la Cruz 05.jpg|Jars of clay.\nImage:Archaeological Museum of Puerto de la Cruz 07.jpg|Recreating an aboriginal cave.\nImage:Archaeological Museum of Puerto de la Cruz 06.jpg|Aboriginal Ceramics.\nSee also\n*Guatimac\n*List of museums in Spain\nReferences\nMuseum official website\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130925160457/http://www.arqueopc.com/web/INICIO.html Archaeological Museum of Puerto de la Cruz]"
