He theorized that an \"electrical layer in the atmosphere\" could carry signals like a telegraph wire, and thus is sometimes listed among supposed inventors of radio.\nSee also\n* Mahlon Loomis\nExternal links\n*http://www.npr.org/euonline/members/feature/inventors/references.htm\n*[https://earlyradiohistory.us/sec021.htm Fakes, Frauds, and Cranks (1866-1922)] (earlyradiohistory.us)"
