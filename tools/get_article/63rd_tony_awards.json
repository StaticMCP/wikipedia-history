The ceremony was broadcast by CBS, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris.\nThe cut-off date for eligibility for the awards was April 30, 2009. Nominations were announced on May 5, 2009 by Cynthia Nixon and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Of the musicals, Billy Elliot the Musical received 15 nominations, every one that it was eligible for, which tied for the most received by any Broadway production until this record was surpassed by Hamilton (16), followed by the Pulitzer Prize for Drama winner Next to Normal with eleven.  Among the nominees for Best Revival of a Musical, Hair had the most nominations, with eight.  Of the plays, the revivals Mary Stuart and The Norman Conquests tied for the most nominations, with seven each.  All four stars of God of Carnage were nominated, as was the play itself.  Billy Elliot won 10 awards, the most of the night, including Best Musical. Next to Normal and God of Carnage each won three.\nThe Isabelle Stevenson Award, a non-competitive award named after the late president of the American Theatre Wing, was presented for the first time. Its purpose is to recognize individuals from the theatre community who have volunteered time to one or more humanitarian, social service, or charitable organizations. The first recipient of this honor was Phyllis Newman. This was the first non-competitive category to be introduced since the Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theatre was established in 1990.\nThe broadcast won the 2009 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Programs. The telecast also was nominated in the category of Outstanding Art Direction for Variety, Music or Nonfiction Programming.\nEligibility\nShows that opened on Broadway during the 2008–09 season before May 1, 2009 are eligible.\n;Original plays\n*The American Plan\n*Dividing the Estate\n*God of Carnage\n*Impressionism\n*''Irena's Vow\n*Reasons to Be Pretty\n*33 Variations\n*To Be or Not to Be\n;Original musicals\n*Billy Elliot the Musical\n*Next to Normal\n*9 to 5\n*Rock of Ages\n*Shrek The Musical\n*The Story of My Life\n*A Tale of Two Cities\n*13\n*title of show\n*White Christmas\n;Play revivals\n*Accent on Youth\n*All My Sons\n*American Buffalo\n*Blithe Spirit\n*Desire Under the Elms\n*Equus\n*Exit the King\n*Hedda Gabler\n*Joe Turner's Come and Gone\n*Mary Stuart\n*A Man for All Seasons\n*The Norman Conquests\n*The Philanthropist\n*The Seagull\n*Speed-the-Plow\n*Waiting for Godot\n;Musical revivals\n*Guys and Dolls\n*Hair\n*Pal Joey\n*West Side Story\nPre-telecast events\nThe Visa Signature Tony Awards Preview Concert featured performers from the musicals Guys and Dolls, Hair, West Side Story, 9 to 5; Billy Elliot the Musical, Next to Normal, Rock of Ages, and Shrek The Musical.

Robert Spencer, and Aaron Tveit performing \"You Don't Know/I Am The One\"; Pal Joey, represented by Stockard Channing singing a few lines from \"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered\" during the opening segment; Rock of Ages, with Constantine Maroulis and fellow cast members singing \"Don't Stop Believin'\"; Shrek the Musical, with the company performing \"What's Up, Duloc\"; West Side Story, with the company performing the Dance At The Gym; and 9 to 5, with Dolly Parton joining the cast to sing the title tune.  Cast members from national touring companies of three musicals also appeared: The lead character from four Jersey Boys casts (Joseph Leo Bwarie (Toronto), Rick Faugno (Las Vegas), Courter Simmons (national tour) and Dominic Scaglione, Jr. (Chicago) sang together with Jarrod Spector from the Broadway cast; Legally Blonde spotlighted Becky Gulsvig; and Michelle Dawson, Kittra Wynn Coomer and Rachel Tyler from the national tour of Mamma Mia! sang \"Dancing Queen\" with fellow cast members.\nPerformers from the nominated Best Plays category presented brief clips of those plays, which included God of Carnage, 33 Variations, Dividing the Estate and Reasons to Be Pretty.\nLiza Minnelli performed in the opening sequence, and rock icon Bret Michaels and his band Poison joined the cast of Rock of Ages during their segment in the opening number, performing the band's 1988 Top Ten hit \"Nothin' but a Good Time\". While exiting the stage, Michaels was struck in the head by a descending set and knocked to the floor. He suffered a fractured nose and a split lip that required three stitches.  He subsequently sued the event's organizers, claiming that the collision led to his 2010 brain hemorrhage. The suit was settled in May 2012 for an undisclosed amount.\nNeil Patrick Harris ended the show with a pastiche of \"Tonight\" from West Side Story and \"Luck Be a Lady\" from Guys and Dolls, with lyrics re-written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman that recapped the awards.\nCompetitive awards\nWinners in bold.\n{| class=wikitable width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! width=\"50%\" | Best Play\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! width=\"50%\" | Best Musical\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'God of Carnage – Yasmina Reza'\n** Dividing the Estate – Horton Foote\n** Reasons to Be Pretty – Neil LaBute\n** 33 Variations – Moisés Kaufman\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Billy Elliot the Musical\n**Next to Normal\n** Rock of Ages\n** Shrek The Musical\n|-\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Revival of a Play\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Revival of a Musical\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* The Norman Conquests\n** ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone\n** Mary Stuart\n** Waiting for Godot\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Hair\n** Guys and Dolls\n** Pal Joey\n** West Side Story\n|-\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Geoffrey Rush – Exit the King as King Berenger'\n** Jeff Daniels – God of Carnage as Alan\n** Raúl Esparza – Speed-the-Plow as Charlie Fox\n** James Gandolfini – God of Carnage as Michael\n** Thomas Sadoski – Reasons to Be Pretty as Greg\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'Marcia Gay Harden – God of Carnage as Veronica'\n** Hope Davis – God of Carnage as Annette\n** Jane Fonda – 33 Variations as Katherine Brandt\n** Janet McTeer – Mary Stuart as Mary Stuart\n** Harriet Walter – Mary Stuart as Elizabeth I\n|-\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical\n! style=\"background:#C0C0C0;\" ! style=\"width=\"50%\" | Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 'David Alvarez, Trent Kowalik, and Kiril Kulish – Billy Elliot the Musical as Billy Elliot'\n** Gavin Creel – Hair'' as Claude Hooper Bukowski\n** Brian d'Arcy James – Shrek The Musical as Shrek\n** Constantine Maroulis – Rock of Ages as Drew\n** J.
