Produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, the film was set to be part of the Star Wars franchise.\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy began developing a new Star Wars film with Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige by September 2019, and Waldron joined in January 2021. The film paused development in May 2022, and was no longer in active development by March 2023.\nProduction\nDevelopment\nWhile working on the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)'s Spider-Man films with Sony Pictures, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige decided to look for more opportunities to develop films for other studios. As a fan of the Star Wars franchise since his college days, Feige had a meeting with Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and The Walt Disney Studios co-chairmen Alan F. Horn and Alan Bergman to discuss him potentially developing a Star Wars film. Kennedy agreed to the idea, and Lucasfilm announced the project in September 2019. Horn said that following the conclusion of the \"Skywalker saga\", Kennedy was pursuing a \"new era in Star Wars storytelling\" and it made sense for her to develop a film with Feige since he was a big fan of the franchise. Feige was said to have discussed having a major actor play a specific role in the film by that point. In November, Feige said he wanted to explore new characters and places within the Star Wars universe, while Kennedy said they had just started to discuss what the film would be about and when production would begin.\nMichael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for the film in January 2021 as part of an overall deal with Disney. Waldron previously worked with Feige for Marvel Studios as head writer of the first season of the series Loki (2021) and as writer of the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). In June, Waldron expressed interest in featuring C-3PO in the film, but noted that it was still in early development. Waldron was writing the script by May 2022, when Kennedy suggested that Lucasfilm was not actively developing a project with Feige. The film was confirmed to no longer be in active development in March 2023 with Waldron instead focusing on writing Avengers: Secret Wars (2027). Contrary to earlier comments, Kennedy clarified the following month that the project was more something conflated through the media, that \"nothing ever got developed. We never discussed an idea... If [Feige] did come up with something, I would be all ears. But, that's never really happened, so it's not an abandoned project. It just never really happened.\" In May 2023, the Russo brothers, who had worked with Feige on numerous MCU films, confirmed they had had \"early conversations\" about potentially directing Feige's Star Wars film.\n}}\nExternal links\n*  Star Wars }}\n*  Star Wars }}"
