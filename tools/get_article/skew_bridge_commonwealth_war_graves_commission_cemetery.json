Is named after a skewed wooden bridge which carried the road from Helles to Krithia across the Dere, a stream about 45 metres west of the cemetery and just behind the centre of the Allied lines. The cemetery was created during the fighting of 6–8 May 1915 and used until the Allied evacuation in January 1916. It originally contained only 53 graves, but now contains 607 graves, a consequence of its enlargement following the Armistice as graves were moved in from the surrounding including clearing Backhouse Post, Orchard Gully, R.N.D., and Romanos Well cemeteries. Special memorials record 125 British and 4 Australians who are known to be buried in the cemetery but the location of whose graves is not known more precisely.\nNotable graves\nAmongst those known to be buried in the cemetery is the youngest British soldier to be killed during the campaign and the youngest Allied serviceman to be buried on the peninsula. Drummer Joseph Aloysius Townsend of D Company, 1/4th Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment was 15 when he was killed on 18 May 1915.\n(The youngest Allied soldier to die on service was an Australian, Private James Martin, aged 14 years 9 months.  He contracted typhoid and was evacuated to a hospital ship where he died and was buried at sea.)\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
