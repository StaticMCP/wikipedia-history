Her research involves statistical mechanics and the many-body problem in quantum mechanics. She is a co-author of the book Random Operators: Disorder Effects on Quantum Spectra and Dynamics.\nEducation and career\nWarzel was born on 2 February 1973 in Erlangen, where she grew up.\nShe studied mathematics and physics at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, beginning in 1992, with a year at the University of Cambridge for Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. She earned her doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 2001. Her dissertation, On Lifshits Tails in Magnetic Fields, was supervised by Hajo Leschke.\nBefore joining the Technical University of Munich, she was an assistant professor at Princeton University.\nResearch\nHer research interests involve statistical mechanics and the many-body problem in quantum mechanics. She is the author with Michael Aizenman of the book Random Operators: Disorder Effects on Quantum Spectra and Dynamics.\nRecognition\nIn 2009, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics gave Warzel their Young Scientist Prize in Mathematical Physics.\nWarzel is a Sloan Research Fellow, and a former von Neumann Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study.\nShe was the Emmy Noether Lecturer of the German Mathematical Society in 2011, a plenary speaker at the 2012 International Congress on Mathematical Physics,\nand a speaker in the mathematical physics section of the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Brazil.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
