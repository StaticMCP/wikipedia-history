After Sergei Bagapsh won the January 2005 rerun, the People's Assembly voted to permanently appoint a chairman. It first voted against the permanent appointment of Tania, before supporting on 10 June the nomination of Illarion Argun, former chairman of Gagra Bank, with 29 votes in favour, 3 against and 3 abstentions.\nOn 1 August, Argun along with Jeiran Kirval, the National Bank's chief security officer, died in a car crash on the coastal highway near Upper Eshera.\nOn 26 December, President Raul Khajimba nominated head of the Economical Department of the Presidential Administration Beslan Baratelia as the new chairman.
