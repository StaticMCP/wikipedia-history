It is Wolfe's first novel, and is considered a highly autobiographical American coming-of-age story. The character of Eugene Gant is generally believed to be a depiction of Wolfe himself. The novel briefly recounts Eugene's father's early life, but primarily covers the span of time from Eugene's birth in 1900 to his definitive departure from home at the age of 19. The setting is a fictionalization of his home town of Asheville, North Carolina, called Altamont in the novel.\nA restored version of the original manuscript of Look Homeward, Angel, titled O Lost, was published in 2000.\nGenesis and publication history\n, Hendersonville, NC]]\nThomas Wolfe's father, William Oliver Wolfe, ordered an angel statue from New York and it was used for years as a porch advertisement at the family monument shop on Patton Avenue (now the site of the Jackson Building). W. O. Wolfe sold the statue to a family in Hendersonville, North Carolina in 1906. The angel was then moved to that town's Oakdale Cemetery. The boarding house run by Eugene Gant's mother, based on one run by Wolfe's mother, has been called \"the most famous boardinghouse in American fiction.\"\nThe title of Thomas Wolfe's novel comes from the John Milton poem \"Lycidas\":\n::\"Look homeward Angel now, and melt with [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ruth ruth]:And, O ye Dolphins, waft the hapless youth.\"(163–164)\nWolfe's original title was The Building of a Wall, which he later changed to O Lost. On the novel's completion, Wolfe gave the vast manuscript to Scribner editor Maxwell Perkins. Perkins was impressed with the young author's talent, but requested that Wolfe rewrite the novel to a more publishable size. The two worked through it together, and after being trimmed by 60,000 words, the novel was published in 1929. Wolfe became insecure about the editing process after receiving criticism that the novel was Perkins's almost as much as his own. This led to an estrangement between the two, and Wolfe eventually left Scribner. Prior to his death in 1938, Wolfe made amends with Perkins. Writing in 1947, Perkins stated that he took the book \"substantially as it was,\" and that \"in truth, the extent of cutting ... has somehow come to be greatly exaggerated. Really, it was more a matter of reorganization.\"\nDescriptions of Altamont are based on Wolfe's home town of Asheville, North Carolina, and the descriptions of people and family led to estrangement from many in his hometown. Though often regarded as a \"sentimental tale of growing up,\" the novel is characterized by a \"dark and troubling\" depiction of the times, \"full of loneliness, death, insanity, alcoholism, family dysfunction, racial segregation and a profoundly cynical view of World War I.\" Rarely named but frequently alluded to, the infectious disease tuberculosis (consumption) casts a \"death’s-head shadow\" over the novel. Wolfe later died of the disease.\nO Lost, the original \"author's cut\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by scholars Arlyn and Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Matthew Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon.\"\nPlot\nPart One\nThe first marriage of Oliver Gant, father of the protagonist, Eugene, ends in tragedy, after which Oliver becomes an alcoholic; the battle with alcoholism remains the major struggle of his life. He eventually remarries, builds a new house, and starts a family. The couple have a total of six surviving children.\nEugene's birth follows a difficult labor during which his father, Oliver, is drunk downstairs. Oliver forms a special bond with his son from early on. He begins to get his drinking under control, although his marriage becomes strained as Eliza's patience with him grows thinner.\nDespite his flaws, Oliver Gant is the family's keystone; he reads Shakespeare, has his daughter Helen read poetry, and keeps great fires burning in the house as symbols  of warmth for the family. Eugene's early education includes several clashes with teachers but he has a love of books and is bright, much to the pride of both his parents. His mother continues to baby him, unwilling to see him grow up.\nPart Two\nEugene wins a writing contest and is chosen to attend Altamont Fitting School and later, the University of North Carolina.\nAt UNC, he is taken up by the new school principal, John Dorsey Leonard and wife, Margaret. They form a college prep academy and add Eugene to the student population at the cost of $100 per year, grudgingly provided by Eliza. He learns the basics from them both, but is prompted by Margaret to immerse himself in poetry and ancient drama. He becomes like a son to them both.\nOldest Gant son, Stevie, is a braggart and an enterprising entrepreneur, albeit with rotting, painful teeth. Younger son, Luke, minus the dental ailment, seems to be following in his footsteps, both hustlers and conmen. Kind, gentle, brooding brother, Ben, grows close to Eugene and looks out for him.\nPart Three\nAfter his freshman year, Eugene's summer back in Altamont is marked by him falling in love with a 21-year-old tenant—Laura James—at his mother's boarding house. Eugene becomes obsessed with Laura and at the end of the summer, she tells him that she is engaged to be married to a man in Norfolk, Virginia. Eugene falls into a funk which haunts him for another two years.\nOliver Gant undergoes radiation treatments for his cancer at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore.\nEugene returns to UNC and becomes involved in academic activities including serving as the editor of the school newspaper, the literary magazine, and the poetry publication. He joins a drama writer's seminar and achieves acclaim. In the spring of 1918, his roommate unexpectedly dies of heart disease, throwing Eugene into another funk. In the summer of 1918, Eugene works at the shipyards at Norfolk, hoping to earn extra money for the upcoming school year, but this instead turns into a nightmare with him living homeless and famished for most of the summer.\nAfter returning to UNC in the fall of 1918, he is summoned by his mother to come home immediately because his brother Ben is in a near coma with pneumonia; he dies soon after. Eugene returns to UNC and completes his studies. His mentor, English professor Vergil Weldon, encourages Eugene to apply to Harvard for graduate studies. He tells his mother of his plans; she begs him to stay at home and work for a newspaper. Eugene tells Eliza that he has a destiny elsewhere and that he cannot be boxed in by a small mountain town in North Carolina.\nCritical reception\nLook Homeward, Angel was published in 1929 to generally positive reviews in North America, most praising the author's brilliance and emotional power. One review called it a \"sensation\", and described it as having struck the literary world by storm. Despite the novel's enduring popularity, Wolfe's work has since come to be viewed by many literary critics (Harold Bloom among them) as undisciplined. According to Jonathan W. Daniels, those critics wished that \"Tom Wolfe's big sprawling powerful pouring prose would have been served in neater packages of sweeter stuff.\"\nAdaptations and performances\nPlaywright Ketti Frings adapted the novel as a play of the same name. The play opened on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre November 28, 1957, and ran for a total of 564 performances, closing on April 4, 1959. In 1958, Frings won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for her adaptation of Wolfe's novel. The production received Tony Award nominations for Best Play; Best Actor in a Play (Hugh Griffith and Anthony Perkins); Best Actress in a Play (Jo Van Fleet); Best Scenic Design (Jo Mielziner); Best Costume Design (Motley); and Best Director (George Roy Hill).\nFrings' adaptation of Look Homeward, Angel was readapted as a Broadway musical, Angel, which opened at the Minskoff Theatre in New York on May 4, 1978, and closed May 13 after five performances and poor reviews. Frings co-wrote the book with the show's lyricist, Peter Udell, whose lyrics were set to music by Gary Geld. This songwriting team had created the musicals Shenandoah and Purlie and penned the hit song \"Sealed With a Kiss.\" Angel was directed by Philip Rose and choreographed by Robert Tucker. The production featured costumes by Pearl Somner, lighting design by John Gleason and scenery by Ming Cho Lee. For her performance in the show, Frances Sternhagen received a 1978 Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical. Additionally, Joel Higgins was nominated for a 1978 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical.\nKetti Frings's screenplay was made into a TV movie, released by NBC in February 1972. The film was directed by Paul Bogart and starred Timothy Bottoms as Eugene Gant, E.G. Marshall as W.O. Gant, and Geraldine Page as Eliza.\nIn Season 2, Episode 11 Unidentified Female (December 2, 1995) of Touched by an Angel, the book is part of the story of a young man who returns home after making his own coming-of-age road trip. Monica is seen reading Wolfe's book, and she quotes a passage from the novel as eulogy for a story character who has died accidentally.\nIn Season 1, Episode 1 of limited series Fellow Travelers (miniseries) (2023), the book is given as a gift from a devoutly religious man to his male lover, during the 1950s Lavender Scare.\nRelated works\nThe film Genius (2016) is about Wolfe's life and his relationship with Maxwell Perkins from the moment Perkins received the manuscript from a colleague.\nIn popular culture\nIn 1985. Serbian rock band Riblja Čorba released a song named \"Pogledaj dom svoj, anđele\" (Look Homeward Angel in Serbian).\nThe film Before Sunset (Linklater, 2004) alludes to the book's note 'to the reader'. In a 2024 podcast, 'Talk Easy with Sam Fragaso', Linklater reads a portion of the note.\nThe North Carolina band, Look Homeward, is named after the novel.\nIn movie 'Chinese Coffee' (2000), one of the protagonists, poor writer Harry Levine (Al Pacino), is seen with a copy of Thomas Wolfe's 'Look Homeward, Angel' in his hand in the cafe scenes with his photographer friend Jake Manheim (Jerry Orbach). Towards the end of the film, both characters directly mention Thomas Wolfe and quote from 'Look Homeward, Angel' while walking on the same bridge that Thomas Wolfe used to walk on when struggling with writer's block and on which the latter, apparently, had the inspiration come back to him and prompt him to resume writing.\nBibliography\n*\n*\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*"
