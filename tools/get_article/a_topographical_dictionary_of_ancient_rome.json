Referred to as 'Platner and Ashby', the volume describes the ancient monuments and buildings in the city of Rome, although by and large only if they belong to the classical period. It covers both remains that are still extant and buildings of which not a trace remained, and collates source documents for each. This volume was, for fifty or sixty years, the standard reference in the field of Roman topography, having superseded Rodolfo Lanciani's Forma Urbis Romae (1893–1901).\nPlatner and Ashby has since itself been superseded by a reworking, L.&nbsp;Richardson,&nbsp;Jr.'s A&nbsp;New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, but mostly by the new standard, a completely new work, Margareta Steinby's Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae (six volumes, 1993–2000).\nSee also\n* Topography of ancient Rome\n* List of ancient monuments in Rome\n* History of Rome\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0054 A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome] at Perseus Project.\n* [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/home.html A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome] at LacusCurtius.\n* [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/eos/eos_title.pl?callnum=DG16.P72 A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome], EOS at [http://www.lib.uchicago.edu The University of Chicago Library – The University of Chicago Library]."
