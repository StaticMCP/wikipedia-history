From there he joined the first in-store radio station, Radio Topshop, at Topshop's store on Oxford Circus in London. By 1986, Warren was presenting shows on Metro Radio, covering the north-east of England, and he remained with the station until September 1988, when he accepted a 2-year posting with BFBS in Cyprus, but returned home after six months, citing homesickness. On returning to England, he joined TFM. After a further four months in the north-east, he was hired as a presenter of Children's ITV's summer mornings & afternoons service in July 1989 alongside Jeanne Downs, and returned for the following year, hosting alongside fellow presenters Nick Owen and Scally the Dog. After leaving ITV in 1990 he joined Capital FM, initially presenting an overnight slot as well as covering other shows. He later presented the early weekend morning show and also the weekday overnight slots.\nRadio 1\nWarren was recruited to BBC Radio 1 in November&nbsp;1994 alongside then KISS 100 presenter Danny Rampling, and he presented the Weekend Breakfast Show from 19 November. In September 1995, Warren became Chris Evans' warmup presenter as he took over the Weekday Early Breakfast show. He left the early breakfast slot in July 1997 to make way for the arrival of Chris Moyles, and he consequently presented the weekday overnight show from 1-4am (later 2–4) from the beginning of August on Tuesday-Friday, alongside the Sunday Breakfast show.
