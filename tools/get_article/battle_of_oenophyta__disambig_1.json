In 457 BC Athens, the leader of the Delian League, came into conflict with Corinth and their ally Sparta (leader of the Peloponnesian League) over Megara; 62 days prior to the Battle of Oenophyta, the Athenians were defeated at the Battle of Tanagra by Sparta, but Sparta had lost so many men that they could not take advantage of their victory.\nThe Athenians, who had 14,000 men at Tanagra, regrouped after that battle and marched into Boeotia. At Oenophyta, led by Myronides they defeated the Boeotians, and then destroyed the walls of Tanagra and ravaged Locrida and Phocis. Their victory at Oenophyta was quickly followed by the surrender of Aegina, and the completion of the construction of the Long Walls to the Athenian port of Piraeus (an action opposed by Sparta).\nAthens remained in control of Boeotia until 447 BC, when they were defeated at the Battle of Coronea.\nReferences"
