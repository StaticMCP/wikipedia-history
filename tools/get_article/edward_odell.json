From 1975 to 1977 Odell was a Josiah Willard Gibbs Instructor at Yale University. He became in 1977 an assistant professor, in 1981 an associate professor, and in 1990 a full professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He was the author or coauthor of 84 articles.\nIn 1994 Odell was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Zurich. In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\nSelected publications\n*with W. B.
