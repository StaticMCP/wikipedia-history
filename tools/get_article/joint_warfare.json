Joint warfare is in essence a form of combined arms warfare on a larger, national scale, in which complementary forces from a state's army, navy, air, coastal, space, and special forces are meant to work together in joint operations, rather than planning and executing military operations separately.\nIts origins can be traced to the 1938 establishment of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, the world's first joint higher command structure, though it should not be seen as the same level of \"jointness\" as U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nThe United States Department of Defense, which endorses joint warfare as an overriding doctrine for its forces, describes it as \"team warfare\", which \"requires the integrated and synchronized application of all appropriate capabilities. The synergy that results maximizes combat capability in unified action.\" This priority on national unity of effort means practitioners of joint warfare must acknowledge the importance of the inter-agency process, including the priorities, capabilities, and resources of other non-uniformed agencies (such as intelligence services) in military planning.\nMilitary operations conducted by armed forces from two or more allied countries are referred to by the U.S. Department of Defense as combined operations.\nSee also\n* Contrast with interservice rivalry\n* Battlespace\n* Joint base\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* United States Department of Defense publication [https://web.archive.org/web/20011112111149/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1.pdf JP 1, \"Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States\"] (pdf document)\n* Zaloga, Steven J.
