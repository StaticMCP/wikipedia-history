It is presented with The Center for Peace and Conflict Studies (CPCS), Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States.\nHistory\nThe Max Mark-Cranbrook Global Peacemaker Awards were founded with the aim of promoting peace, reconciliation, and conflict resolution. The awards seek to acknowledge the efforts of individuals and organizations that have made significant strides in fostering peace and harmony across borders, as well as tackling some of the gravest social justice issues such as gendered violence, human trafficking and modern slavery, gun violence and mass incarceration, human rights, addiction and depression, indigenous rights, and other issues. The annual Cranbrook Global Peacemaker Lecture was incorporated into Wayne State's Center for Peace and Conflict Studies in its annual Community Peacemaker Awards program in 2009.\nIn 2019 the awards ceremony was held at the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, with the Center for Peace & Conflict Studies.
