It was last contested with Lily Cheng elected as the councillor for the current term.\nHistory\nToronto municipal ward boundaries were significantly modified in 2018, passing through three models (44-ward, 47-ward, and 25-ward). Ultimately, for the purposes of administering the 2018 election, the 25-ward structure was used and later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2021.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, the City of Toronto engaged in a ward boundary review evaluating the city's previous 44-ward model.\nBased on this, and in preparation for the 2018 municipal election, the City of Toronto added 3 new wards to  create a 47-ward model.  This model was in effect at the opening of the 2018 municipal election.\nThe 2018 Toronto municipal election ran from May 1, 2018, to October 22, 2018, and while underway the provincial government introduced the Better Local Government Act, 2018, S.O. 2018, c. 11 - Bill 5. The act was assented to on August 14, 2018.\nThe immediate effect of this act was to eliminate all previous ward models, and replace them with a 25-ward model designed to align with the provincial and federal ridings boundaries in effect at that time.\nThe timing of the boundary change was controversial, and the City of Toronto sued the province contesting the provisions' constitutionality. In the absence of an injunction, and with the pending threat of the province invoking the notwithstanding clause which would defeat any constitutional challenge, the election continued under the 25-ward model.\nThe nomination period originally scheduled to close on July 27, 2018, was extended to September 14, 2018. This allowed new candidates to run, and existing candidates to either withdraw or to reassign their candidacy to a different constituency.\nIn a judgment rendered October 1, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of the provisions, and the 25-ward model remained in effect for the 2022 Toronto municipal election.\nThe current ward is made up of the former Ward 23 Willowdale, part of the former Ward 24 Willowdale, and a small portion of the former Ward 10 York Centre.\n2018 municipal election\nWard 18 was first contested during the 2018 municipal election. Prior to the provincial government realignment, Ward 23 councillor John Filion announced plans to retire, and endorsed candidates in both of the new wards covering the previous district under the city's planned 47-ward system: Filion's executive assistant Markus O'Brien Fehr, and community organizer Lily Cheng.\nFollowing the realignment, Filion rescinded his retirement plans and entered the race for the new ward 18, citing fears of voter confusion with the restructured wards; O'Brien Fehr dropped out while Cheng remained in the race for the larger ward alongside a number of other challengers. Filion was ultimately elected with 31.06 per cent of the vote.\nGeography\nWard 18 is part of the North York community council.\nWillowdale's boundaries mirror its federal and provincial counterparts, being bounded by Steeles Avenue (the city limit) to the north, Bayview Avenue to the east, Highway 401 to the south until it crosses the Don River, the Don River west branch to the southwest (from Highway 401 to Bathurst Street), and Bathurst Street to the west otherwise.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Council term\n! colspan=\"2\" |Member\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Ward 9 North York Centre\n|-\n| 1997–2000\n| colspan=\"2\" | John Filion, Norman Gardner\n|-\n!\n!
