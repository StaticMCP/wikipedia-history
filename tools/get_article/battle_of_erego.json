The battle involved British colonial forces, led by Colonel Swayne, and Somali troops (known as Dervishes) under the command of Haji Muhammad Abdullah Hassan. The Dervishes won by ambushing the British forces. The battle was an early conflict of the Somaliland campaign.\nBattle\nThe British forces were on a mission to locate Hassan, who was known as \"the Mad Mullah\" for his resistance to colonial rule. This search led them to Erego, where they were ambushed by Hassan's forces.\nAt the beginning, Colonel Swayne, who was leading the British column, believed that he had defeated the Dervishes. Certain that Hassan's capture was within reach, he dispatched triumphant messages of victory to London. However, the Dervishes launched an attack from the rear that cut off Colonel Swayne's communication with the coast, destroyed the Zariba on which he relied for supplies, and ultimately forced him to retreat.\nA British officer's letter describes the situation during the battle:\n\"No one will appreciate this business until it is too late. We are in a regular trap, and how we are going to get out we do not know. We have had stiffish fights, and have lost many men. The worst is that our blacks are flunking and our camels have nearly all been killed or captured. We have next to no water, and we are miles from any wells. We have no supplies, and nearly no ammunition. They have captured two of our Maxims. I do not suppose they care at home what happens to us. It is a brutal shame to send us blind into an ambush like this.\"\nThe battle ended in a decisive Dervish victory.\nAftermath\nThis expedition cost the British Empire more than $300,000 and resulted in a considerable loss of lives. It proved to be a failure. In response, the House of Commons offered Muhammad Abdullah Hassan $15,000 per year on the condition that he cease the war. However, he declined the offer.\nColonel Swayne, who spearheaded the operations against the Dervishes, was recalled by the War Office for consultations.\nThe victory at Erigo brought considerable recognition to the Dervish cause. Frederick Quelch who fought in Somaliland, reported:''\"If the Mad Mollah wins a victory, the other Mohammedans are at once more impressed with the divine character of his leadership, and they flock to his standard where they might otherwise have remained passive. The recent victory of the Mad Mollah over Colonel Swayne's detachment presages, therefore, large fanatic hordes to his forces. The trouble the British will have in subduing him will be proportionately increased by each victory.\"'' Muhammad Abdullah Hassan was commonly referred to as the 'Mad Mullah' by the media until the defeat at Erego. Following this event, there was a shift in perception. The Daily News noted that:'''the \"Mad Mullah\"... seems to be showing increasing signs of sanity', and that, 'for a mad man, the Mullah planned his tactics skilfully... he is no fool, this Mad Mullah'.''\nReferences"
