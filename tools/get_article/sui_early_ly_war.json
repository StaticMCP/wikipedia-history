      "text": "# Sui–Early Lý War\n\nThe Sui–Former Lý War was a military conflict between the Chinese Sui dynasty and the Vietnamese Former Lý dynasty in 602, eventually resulting in the collapse of the latter.\nIn 601, Lý Phật Tử, ruler of the Former Lý dynasty was summoned to attend the Chinese court. However, he delayed the attendance and eventually rebelled in 602, even though he had recognized Sui authority in 595. He concentrated his military forces at the Vạn Xuân capital Co Loa and at Long Bien. In 602, General Liu Fang led his army in the invasion of Vạn Xuân.\nThe Sui army departed via Yunnan to the Former Lý territory. However, the Vietnamese army was unprepared to fend them off because they had not expected that the Sui army would take this invasion route. In the end, Lý Phật Tử surrendered to the Sui forces in front of his palace in Long Biên. Consequently, the Chinese took him captive and transferred him to the Chinese capital Chang'an, although he died on the way. Liu Fang's army also forced the submission or defeated the remaining local clans. The conquered territory was re-incorporated into China.\nSee also\n* Sui–Lâm Ấp war\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
