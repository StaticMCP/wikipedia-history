In the Koine Hellenic of the New Testament, e.g., in John 19:3, this is written as Basileus ton Ioudaion ().\nBoth uses of the title lead to dramatic results in the New Testament accounts. In the account of the nativity of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, the Biblical Magi who come from the east call Jesus the \"King of the Jews\", implying that he was the Messiah. This caused Herod the Great to order the Massacre of the Innocents. Towards the end of the accounts of all four canonical Gospels, in the narrative of the Passion of Jesus, the title \"King of the Jews\" leads to charges against Jesus that result in his crucifixion.\nThe initialism INRI () represents the Latin inscription (in John 19:19 and Matthew 27:37), which in English translates to \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\", and John 19:20 states that this was written in three languages—Jewish tongue, (Aramaic, which was closely related to Hebrew, had become a common vernacular of the Jews by this period. Hebrew was in decline, but would continue to be spoken in the region until the beginning of the 3rd century CE.) However, Ἑβραϊστί is consistently used in Koine Hellenic at this time to mean Hebrew and Συριστί (Syristi) is used to mean Aramaic.  Other than the word itself, there is no direct evidence in the verse as to whether Hebrew or Aramaic is meant and translations of the verse which render Ἑβραϊστί as Aramaic are reliant on assumptions made outside of the text to justify it, rather than the text itself.}} Latin, and Hellenic (ΙΝΒΙ = Ιησούς Ναζωραίος Βασιλεύς Ιουδαίων)—during the crucifixion of Jesus.\nThe title \"King of the Jews\" is only used in the New Testament by gentiles, namely by the Magi, Pontius Pilate, and the Roman soldiers. In contrast, the Jews in the New Testament use the title \"King of Israel\" or the Hebrew word Messiah, which can also mean king.\nAlthough the phrase \"King of the Jews\" is used in most English translations, it has also been translated \"King of the Judeans\" (see Ioudaioi).\nIn the nativity\nIn the account of the nativity of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, the Biblical Magi go to King Herod in Jerusalem and (in Matthew 2:2) ask him: \"Where is he that is born King of the Jews?\" Herod asks the \"chief priests and teachers of the law\", who tell him in Bethlehem of Judea.\nThe question troubles Herod who considers the title his own, and in  he questions the Magi about the exact time of the Star of Bethlehem's appearance. Herod sends the Magi to Bethlehem, telling them to notify him when they find the child. After the Magi find Jesus and present their gifts, having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they returned to their country by a different way.\nAn angel appears to Joseph in a dream and warns him to take Jesus and Mary into Egypt (Matthew 2:13). When Herod realizes he has been outwitted by the Magi he gives orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who are two years old and under. (Matthew 2:16)\nIn the Passion narratives\nIn the accounts of the Passion of Jesus, the title King of the Jews is used on three occasions. In the first such episode, all four Gospels state that the title was used for Jesus when he was interviewed by Pilate and that his crucifixion was based on that charge, as in Matthew 27:11, Mark 15:2, Luke 23:3 and John 18:33.\n) on the cross, Ellwangen Abbey, Germany]]\nThe use of the terms king and kingdom and the role of the Jews in using the term king to accuse Jesus are central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate. In , , and  Jesus responds to Pilate, \"you have said so\" when asked if Jesus is the King of the Jews and says nothing further. This answer is traditionally interpreted as an affirmative. Some scholars describe it as ambiguous and enigmatic. Other scholars say it was calculated not to anger Pilate while allowing the gospel reader to understand that the answer is affirmative. In , he hints that the king accusation did not originate with Pilate but with \"others\" and, in John 18:36, he states: \"My kingdom is not of this world\". However, Jesus does not directly deny being the King of the Jews.\nIn the New Testament, Pilate writes \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\" as a sign to be affixed to the cross of Jesus. John 19:21 states that the Jews told Pilate: \"Do not write King of the Jews\" but instead write that Jesus had merely claimed that title, but Pilate wrote it anyway. Pilate's response to the protest is recorded by John: \"What I have written, I have written.\"\nAfter the trial by Pilate and after the flagellation of Christ episode, the soldiers mock Jesus as the King of Jews by putting a purple robe (that signifies royal status) on him, place a Crown of Thorns on his head, and beat and mistreat him in ,  and .\nThe continued reliance on the use of the term king by the Judeans to press charges against Jesus is a key element of the final decision to crucify him. In  Pilate seeks to release Jesus, but the Jews object, saying: \"If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar\", bringing the power of Caesar to the forefront of the discussion. In , the Jews then cry out: \"Crucify him! ... We have no king but Caesar.\"\nThe use of the term \"King of the Jews\" by the early Church after the death of Jesus was thus not without risk, for this term could have opened them to prosecution as followers of Jesus, who was accused of possible rebellion against Rome.\nThe final use of the title only appears in . Here, after Jesus has carried the cross to Calvary and has been nailed to the cross, the soldiers look up on him on the cross, mock him, offer him vinegar and say: \"If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.\" In the parallel account in , the Jewish priests mock Jesus as \"King of Israel\", saying: \"He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.\"\nKing of the Jews vs King of Israel\nIn the New Testament, the \"King of the Jews\" title is used only by the gentiles, by the Magi, Pontius Pilate, and Roman soldiers. In contrast, the Jews in the New Testament prefer the designation \"King of Israel\" as used reverentially by Jesus' Jewish followers in  and , and mockingly by the Jewish leaders in  and . From Pilate's perspective, it is the term \"King\" (regardless of Jews or Israel) that is sensitive, for it implies possible rebellion against the Roman Empire.\nIn the Gospel of Mark the distinction between King of the Jews and King of Israel is made consciously, setting apart the two uses of the term by the Jews and the gentiles.\nINRI and ΙΝΒΙ\ncrucifix, displays the lettering in Greek: ΙΝΒΙ (Trapeza of Holy Trinity Monastery, Meteora, Greece).]]\nThe initialism INRI represents the Latin inscription }} (), which in English translates to \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\" (John 19:19). John 19:20 states that this was written in three languages – Hebrew, Latin, and Greek – and was put on the cross of Jesus. The Greek version of the initialism reads ΙΝΒΙ, representing  ().\nDevotional enthusiasm greeted the discovery by Pedro González de Mendoza in 1492 of what was acclaimed as the actual tablet, said to have been brought to Rome by Saint Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine.\nWestern Christianity\nIn Western Christianity, most crucifixes and many depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus include a plaque or parchment placed above his head, called a titulus, or title, bearing only the Latin letters INRI, occasionally carved directly into the cross and usually just above the head of Jesus.\nThe initialism INRI (as opposed to the full inscription) was in use by the 10th century (Gero Cross, Cologne, ca. 970).\nEastern Christianity\nIn Eastern Christianity, both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic particular churches sui iuris use the Greek letters ΙΝΒΙ, based on the Greek version of the inscription . Some representations change the title to \"ΙΝΒΚ,\"  (, \"The King of the World\"), or to  (, \"The King of Glory\"), not implying that this was really what was written but reflecting the tradition that icons depict the spiritual reality rather than the physical reality.\nThe Romanian Orthodox Church uses INRI, since abbreviation in Romanian is exactly the same as in Latin (Iisus Nazarineanul Regele Iudeilor).\nEastern Orthodox Churches that use Church Slavonic in their liturgy use  (, the equivalent of ΙΝΒΙ for ) or the abbreviation  (, \"King of Glory\").\nVersions in the gospels\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;cellspacing=0;cellpadding=5;\"\n|- align=center bgcolor=#efefef\n!style=\"width:10%;\"|\n! style=\"width:22.5;\" |Matthew\n!style=\"width:22.5%;\"|Mark\n!style=\"width:22.5%;\"|Luke\n!style=\"width:22.5%;\"|John\n|- align=center\n|style=\"text-align:centre;\"|Verse||\n|||| ||\n|- align=center\n|style=\"text-align:centre;\"|Greek Inscription||\n||||||\n|- align=center\n|style=\"text-align:centre;\"|Transliteration||hûtós estin Iēsûs ho basileùs tôn Iudaéōn\n||ho basileùs tôn Iudaéōn ||ho basileùs tôn Iudaéōn hûtos ||Iēsûs ho Nazōraêos ho basileùs tôn Iudaéōn\n|- align=center\n|style=\"text-align:centre;\"|Vulgata Xystina-Clementina (Latin)||Hic est Iesus rex Iudæorum\n||Rex Iudæorum ||Hic est rex Iudæorum ||Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudæorum\n|- align=center\n|style=\"text-align:centre;white-space:nowrap;\"|English translation||This is Jesus, the King of the Jews\n||The King of the Jews ||This is the King of the Jews ||Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews\n|- align=center\n|style=\"text-align:centre;\"|Languages|| [none specified]\n|| [none specified] || Hebrew, Latin, Greek This variance may be a result of later copyists adding to Luke to harmonize that Gospel with the text of John 19:20.

And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.\n|}\nOther uses of INRI\nIn Spanish, the word  denotes any insulting or mocking word or phrase; it is usually found in the fixed expression  (literally \"for more/greater insult\"), which idiomatically means \"to add insult to injury\" or \"to make matters worse\". Its origin is sometimes made clearer by capitalisation .\nThe initials INRI have been reinterpreted with other expansions (backronyms). In an 1825 book on Freemasonry, Marcello Reghellini de Schio alleged that Rosicrucians gave \"INRI\" alchemical meanings:\n* Latin  (\"by fire, nature renews itself\"); other sources have\n* Latin   (\"the nitre of dew is found by fire\")\n* Hebrew  (Yammīm, Nūr, Rūaḥ, Yabešet, \"water, fire, wind, earth\" — the four elements)\nLater writers have attributed these to Freemasonry, Hermeticism, or neo-paganism. Aleister Crowley's The Temple of Solomon the King includes a discussion of Augoeides, supposedly written by \"Frater P.\" of the A∴A∴:\n:For since Intra Nobis Regnum deI [footnote in original: I.N.R.I.], all things are in Ourself, and all Spiritual Experience is a more of less complete Revelation of Him [i.e. Augoeides].\nLatin  literally means \"Inside Us the Kingdom of god\".\nLeopold Bloom, the nominally Catholic, ethnically Jewish protagonist of James Joyce's Ulysses, remembers his wife Molly Bloom interpreting INRI as \"Iron Nails Ran In\".  The same meaning is given by a character in Ed McBain's 1975 novel Doors. Most Ulysses translations preserve \"INRI\" and make a new misinterpretation, such as the French  \"he makes us innocent again\".\nIsopsephy\nIn isopsephy, the Greek term () receives a value of 3343 whose digits seem to correspond to a suggested date for the crucifixion of Jesus, (33, April, 3rd day).\nGallery\nBiblical scenes\nFile:Magi Herod MNMA Cl23532.jpg|The Magi visit Herod to ask about the newborn King of the Jews, Matthew 2:2.\nFile:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|Pilate, trying and handing over Jesus, the King of the Jews, Mark 15:2\nFile:Michelangelo Merisi, called Caravaggio - The Crowning with Thorns - Google Art Project.jpg|Jesus with a royal purple robe mocked and beaten as the King of the Jews,\nFile:Paolo Veronese 010.jpg|Jesus, on the cross, is mocked in Calvary as the King of the Jews, .\nINRI examples\nFile:INRI-Isenheimer.jpg|INRI from the Isenheim Altarpiece\nFile:Crucifix.JPG|A Latin crucifix with a stylized INRI plaque attached, in cornfields near Mureck, Styria, Austria\nFile:InriPrague.jpg|INRI plaque attached to Crucifix and Calvary statue on the north side of Charles Bridge, Prague\nFile:Inri.jpg|Detail of The Small Crucifixion, painting by Matthias Grünewald, , National Gallery of Art, Washington\nFile:Sagrada_Familia_-_Juny_de_2016_-_03.jpg|  on the side of the Sagrada Familia\nSee also\n* Christ the King\n* Ichthys\n* Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament\n* Titulus Crucis\nReferences\nNotes\n}}\nCitations\n}}\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
