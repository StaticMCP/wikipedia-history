The film stars Amitabh Bachchan, Rekha, Ajit, Kader Khan, Amjad Khan and the music is by Rajesh Roshan, the songs are written by Anand Bakshi. The highlight of the film was a children's song sung by Amitabh Bachchan. Tony Glaad decided to take them as the writers of the film. The film was shot in Kashmir with most of the shooting done in Beerwah, Jammu and Kashmir. Film and music expert Rajesh Subramanian revealed, that the vocals for \"Mere Paas Aao\" were to be recorded by Kishore Kumar, but since Amitabh Bachchan was planning a mega live concert abroad, he wanted to sing a song in his voice to perform live at the concerts, hence it was sung by Bachchan.\nThe name of the film and lead character were inspired by a notorious Indian conman, Natwarlal.\nGetting Amitabh to sing was a gimmick that was tried for the first time in this film. Kabhi Kabhie earlier had Amitabh use spoken verse within a melodic song, but this was the first time he sang in a film. This was subsequently copied by other filmmakers in films like Laawaris, Silsila and Pukar.\nAs per a trade guide, which was premium box-office publication in the 1970s and 1980s, Mr. Natwarlal was a \"Super Hit\". In today's lenient classification system, Mr. Natwarlal is easily a blockbuster.\nStory\nNatwar is a young boy, when his beloved older brother and caretaker, police officer Girdharilal, is framed for bribery by the sinister criminal mastermind Vikram.
