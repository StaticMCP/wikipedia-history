It served as the second single from her debut studio album, Queen of the Clouds (2014). It reached the top 20 in Canada, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nComposition\n\"Talking Body\" was written by Lo, Jakob Jerlström and Ludvig Söderberg, while its production was handled by The Struts and Shellback. It is an electropop song, with elements of trip hop, synthpop and indie pop. Lyrically, the song is about trying to seduce someone into having sexual relations. The song plays in the key of E minor, at a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It has a chord sequence of Em-D-G-C-D.\nCritical reception\nThe song was praised for its impudence. Sam Lansky of Time wrote \"Lo can be vulgar, as on the lusty 'Talking Body', which sets a scabrous singalong hook against some of Shellback's irresistibly catchy production, but that sexiness is shot through with frustration; she owns her desire, full-throttle.\"\nMusic video and live performances\nThe music video was premiered on 12 January 2015.\nSince 2015, many of her live performances of the song for a live audience involved \"stripping her clothes or flashing the crowd\".\nChart performance\nThe song peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her second top 20 entry after \"Habits (Stay High)\". Additionally, it peaked at number four on the Mainstream Top 40 charts, which lists the most played songs on pop radio stations. To date, the single has spent 30 weeks on the Hot 100, and has sold two million downloads. It has also peaked at number 14 in Canada.\nAs for Europe, it has peaked at number 16 in Sweden, number 100 in Germany, number 17 on the UK Singles Chart and number eight in Scotland, becoming her third top 20 entry after \"Habits (Stay High)\" and \"Heroes (We Could Be)\" with Alesso.\nTrack listing\n*;Digital EP – The Remixes\n# \"Talking Body\" (Gryffin Remix) – 4:29\n# \"Talking Body\" (KREAM Remix) – 3:39\n# \"Talking Body\" (WDL Remix) – 3:41\n# \"Talking Body\" (Panic City Remix) – 4:46\n# \"Talking Body\" (The Young Professionals Remix) – 3:39\nCredits and personnel\n*Tove Lo – vocals, background vocals, songwriting\n*Ludvig Söderberg – writing\n*Jakob Jerlström – writing\n*The Struts, Shellback – producer\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (2015)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 95\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France Airplay (SNEP)\n| align=\"center\"| 87\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015)\n!scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada (Canadian Hot 100)\n| 50\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten)\n| 62\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)\n| 48\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100\n| 37\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| US Adult Top 40 (Billboard)\n| 36\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Dance Club Songs (Billboard)\n| 5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Dance/Mix Show Airplay (Billboard)\n| 36\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Mainstream Top 40 (Billboard)\n| 18\n|}\nCertifications\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United States\n| 13 January 2015\n| Contemporary hit radio\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|\n|-\n| 23 March 2015\n| Rhythmic contemporary radio\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom\n| 3 May 2015\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Digital download\n| Polydor\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| United States\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 26 May 2015\n| Island\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada\n| Universal\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of number-one dance singles of 2015 (U.S.)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.tove-lo.com Official website]\n*\n*\n*"
