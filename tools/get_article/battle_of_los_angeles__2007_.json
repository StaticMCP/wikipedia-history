They were replaced by TNA wrestler Alex Shelley, local worker Tony Kozina and Necro Butcher.\nQualification\nAt Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament, Ronin took on Joey Ryan in a match which stipulated that if Ryan lost then his hair would be cut off and if Ronin lost then he would lose his spot in the 2007 Battle of Los Angeles tournament. Ryan won the match ending Ronin's chances of participating in the tournament. At Giant-Size Annual #4, a month before the Battle of Los Angeles, Austin Aries returned to PWG and defeated Rocky Romero to take his spot in BOLA.\nEvent\nNight one (August 31, 2007)\nThe event kicked off with a promo by the PWG World Champion Bryan Danielson, who apologized to the PWG fans for not being able to compete in the Battle of Los Angeles tournament due to injury and promised to compete at the next event.\nThe opening match was a tag team match between Los Luchas (Phoenix Star and Zokre) and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson).

Tornado defeated Hero again during the European Vacation tour. At The High Cost of Doing Business, a match was scheduled pitting Hero and Eddie Kingston against Tornado and a mystery partner. Kingston eventually turned on Hero and revealed himself to be Tornado's partner, making it a handicap match. Hero's former Kings of Wrestling tag team partner Claudio Castagnoli ran in to make the save but eventually turned on Hero to join Tornado and Kingston. During the night one of All Star Weekend 6, Hero, LeRae and Necro Butcher lost a six-person tag team match to Tornado, Castagnoli and Kingston. One night later, Tornado and LeRae had a singles encounter where LeRae was disqualified after Hero made the save and attacked Tornado. At Pearl Habra, Tornado defeated Hero in a no disqualification match. After Tornado won the PWG World Championship, Hero defeated Tornado in a Guerrilla Warfare at Life During Wartime to win the title and end the feud.\nAfter the Battle of Los Angeles tournament, CIMA did not go the traditional route of challenging for the PWG World Championship and instead went to his native Japan to compete in his home promotion Dragon Gate. Bryan Danielson instead defended the title against Roderick Strong, the following month at Schadenfreude. CIMA returned to PWG on the night one of All Star Weekend 6, where he defeated Susumu Yokosuka and then finally received a match against Danielson on the night two, which ended in a draw.\nResults\nTournament brackets\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.prowrestlingguerrilla.com Pro Wrestling Guerrilla official website]"
