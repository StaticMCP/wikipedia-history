In 1966 the council of the Royal Society of New Zealand proposed the voyage for 1969, using the vessel HMNZS Endeavour, and invited members of the Royal Society of London to participate in the expedition around the southwest Pacific. In April 1969 Elliot Watson Dawson was named expedition leader and J. V. Eade was named deputy leader.\nBecause HMNZS Endeavour could only accommodate 14 passengers and could only allow a limited time ashore to meet the short cruise time it was determined that land parties would have to transported by air at some times with civil air transport available in Tonga and the use of RNZAF Hercules aircraft transport obtained for Rarotonga and Aitutaki.\nThis led to the development of three expedition groups. The first group was the Tongan group with seven people working on four projects, the second was the Cook Island group which involved eight people working on five projects, and finally the Endeavour group, with four people working on five projects on board the ship.\nParticipants\nExpedition Committee\n* Edwin Ian Robertson, DSIR\n* James William Brodie, New Zealand Oceanographic Institute\n* Richard Kenneth Dell, Dominion Museum\nHMNZS Endeavour crew\n* Commander D.

In 1968 the expedition scientific programme was finalised to the following project areas.\nArchaeology\nThe archaeological work consisted of a preliminary survey of the Vava'u Group in Tonga, and a survey of Atiu, Cook Islands.\nBiology\nA study of the flora of Rarotonga to see the distribution of genera in the Pacific.\nTrapping air-born insects at sea to track insect dispersal, and examining insects and small invertebrates in leaf litter, mosses, and soil in southern parts of the Cook Islands to determine distribution patterns of endemic, introduced, and indigenous species.\nA survey of habitats of marine animals, and a study of shallow-water marine areas like coral reefs in Rarotonga and Aitutaki.\nGeology\nA study of the geology of Tofua, in Tonga, in relation to the theory of plate tectonics.\nGeophysics\nA magnetic survey of the ocean bottom near Aitutaki, Rarotonga, and Mangaia using tracks beneath the Endeavour.\nOceanography\nThe oceanography research focus covered four topics. A continuous study of the topography of the ocean floor beneath the ship using echo-sounding, plankton sampling, dredging around Tonga and the Cook Islands for samples of fauna distribution, and water samples for analysis if carbon-14 by the Nuclear Sciences Institute, DSIR.\nSoil science\nSurveys of soil in Vava'u, Tofua, Kao.\nUpper atmosphere physics\nStudies into the physics of the equatorial ionosphere. This included looking at total ionosphere electron content. They also studied the nighttime VHF television transmissions from Honolulu.\nExpedition\nThe expedition began in August 1969. The Tongan group flew from Auckland to Nuku'alofa via Fiji arriving by 2 September 1969. The Cook Island group were flown by RNZAF Hercules to Rarotonga, or travelled on the M.S. Arawa. On 27 August this group continued on the Hercules to Aitutaki with the Royal Society of London party.\nOn 28 August 1969 HMNZS Endeavour left Auckland with Duff, Trotter, Eade, Preddey, Carrington, and Bennett on board, arriving in Aitutaki on 5 September. The ship then left for Rarotonga on 8 September for the main seaborne studies. These studies were completed successfully with minor delays due to a repair required on the echo-sounding system on 13–15 September, with a RNZN dockyard technician coming from Auckland to Nuku'alofa. Rough seas on 24 September meant there was less time for rock sampling and insect collecting in Mangaia. Scientists disembarked from 23 September, with the Endeavour leaving Nuku'alofa for Gisborne on 3 October, arriving on 9 October 1969.\nReferences"
