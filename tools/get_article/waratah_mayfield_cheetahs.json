Waratah were successful right from the start in the Newcastle First Grade in only their second year losing the grand final in the years 1929, 1933 and 1934, before finally tasting glory in 1936 when they beat Northern Suburbs in the grand final, the team they lost to in 1929.\nIn 1990, Waratah-Mayfield ended a 38-year drought when they defeated Lakes United 17–14 to win the Newcastle premiership. The next premiership came in 2000 when Waratah Mayfield faced off against Lakes United and again claimed victory taking out the grand final 20–14.\nLeaner times were ahead for Waratah Mayfield, and in 2004 the club suffering from financial hardships and struggling to recruit enough players to take part in the Newcastle rugby league they were forced to withdraw from all senior competitions. Today the club continues in junior rugby league competitions and in the Newcastle & Hunter Rugby League competition.\nPremiership titles\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Years Won\n|-\n|1936||1942||1944||1952||1990||2000\n|}\nNotable juniors\n* Ron Bailey\n*Isaac Gordon\nReferences\n* http://users.hunterlink.net.au/~maajjs/aus/nsw/ncl/nclcomps.htm\n* http://www.leagueunlimited.com/article.php?newsid=15210\n* http://www.cheetahs.com.au/cheetahs-articles/2002/2/20/cheetahs-launch-fight-for-survival/\n* http://www.cheetahs.com.au/cheetahs-articles/2004/5/7/fulltime-for-cheetahs-player-crisis-decides-waratahs-fate/"
