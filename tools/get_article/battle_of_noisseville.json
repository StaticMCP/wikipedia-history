At first, the French had slight success, and maintained the ground they won during the day. But on 1 September the French were driven back into Metz, with a loss of 3,379 soldiers and 145 officers. The Prussians lost 2,850 soldiers and 126 officers.\nReferences\n*George Bruce. Harbottle's Dictionary of Battles. (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1981) ()."
