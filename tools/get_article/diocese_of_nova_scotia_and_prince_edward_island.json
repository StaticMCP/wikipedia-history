It encompasses the provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island and has two cathedrals: All Saints' in Halifax and St. Peter's in Charlottetown. Its de facto see city is Halifax (where the synod offices are located), and its roughly 24 400 Anglicans distributed in 239 congregations are served by approximately 153 clergy and 330 lay readers according to the last available data. According to the 2001 census, 120,315 Nova Scotians identified themselves as Anglicans (13% of the province's population), while 6525 Prince Edward Islanders did the same.\nHistory\nThe first  recorded Anglican services in Nova Scotia were held in Annapolis Royal on October 10, 1710, and in Cape Breton Island in 1745. The Diocese was created on 11 August 1787 by Letters Patent of George III which \"erected the Province of Nova Scotia into a bishop's see\" and these also named Charles Inglis as first bishop of the see. The diocese was the first Church of England see created outside England and Wales (i.e. the first colonial diocese). At this point, the see covered present-day New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec. From 1825 to 1839, it included the nine parishes of Bermuda, subsequently transferred to the Diocese of Newfoundland. In 1842, her jurisdiction was described as \"Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Cape Breton, Prince Edward Island\". In 1849, Archdeacon R. Willis was stationed at Halifax. In 1866, there were two archdeaconries: George McCawley was Archdeacon of Nova Scotia and J. Herbert Read of Prince Edward's Island.\nChurches in the diocese that are designated heritage sites include:\n* St. John's Anglican Church (Lunenburg)\n* All Souls' Chapel (Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island)\n* Holy Trinity Anglican Church (Alma, Prince Edward Island)\n* St. George's Anglican Church (Parrsboro, Nova Scotia)\n* St. John's Anglican Church (Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia)\n* St. James' Anglican Church (Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia)\n* St. George's Anglican Church (Sydney, Nova Scotia)\nStatistics\nBased on the parochial reports from the year 2014  the diocese consists of 239 congregations grouped in 94 parishes, within 10 regions, each having a Regional Dean and an Archdeacon with a total membership of 24,400 people. Of the diocesan clergy 74 are parish Rectors, 19 are Priests in Charge, 101 are retired (many of whom still serve in one or other capacity -including being in charge of a parish). There are two retired bishops, 11 military chaplains; 1 health care chaplain; 2 full-time faculty and the President at the Atlantic School of Theology; 1 full-time University Chaplain and 2 part-time University Chaplains; and 1 Prison Chaplain. The diocese has a successful non-stipendiary clergy programme; currently there are 28 priests and 11 Deacons with that status. There are 330 lay readers trained to administer the sacraments at public services presided by a priest, preach, lead public worship in the absence of clergy, and other pastoral functions.\nList of bishops\nNova Scotia\n*Charles Inglis – consecrated August 12, 1787 and died February 24, 1816.\n*Robert Stanser – consecrated May 16, 1816 and died December 23, 1828\n*John Inglis – consecrated March 26, 1825 and died October 27, 1850.\n*Hibbert Binney – consecrated March 26, 1851 and died April 30, 1887.\n*Frederick Courtney – consecrated April 26, 1888 and died, December 29, 1918.\n*Clarendon Worrell – consecrated October 18, 1904, became Metropolitan of Canada in 1915 and Primate of all Canada in 1931 and died August 10, 1934.\n*John Hackenley – consecrated January 6, 1925, became Metropolitan of Canada in 1939 and died November 16, 1943.\n*Frederick Kingston – consecrated Bishop of Algoma April 25, 1940, translated to Nova Scotia in 1944, became Primate of All Canada and Archbishop of Nova Scotia in 1947 and died November 20, 1950.\n*Robert Waterman – consecrated January 27, 1948, installed as coadjutor January 27, 1948, succeeded as diocesan, November 20, 1950, and enthroned January 26, 1951, retired June 20, 1963 and died, December 16, 1984.\n*William Davis – consecrated February 26, 1958, installed as coadjutor February 26, 1958 and succeeded as diocesan July 1, 1963, became metropolitan of the province June 8, 1972, retired August 31, 1975 and died, May 28, 1987.\n*George Arnold – consecrated September 21, 1967 and installed as suffragan September 21, 1967, elected coadjutor May 29, 1975 and succeeded as diocesan September 1, 1975, retired January 1, 1980 and died January 31, 1998.\n*Leonard Hatfield – consecrated October 17, 1976 and installed as suffragan October 17, 1976, elected coadjutor September 27, 1979 and succeeded as diocesan January 1, 1980, retired September 30, 1984 and died September 14, 2001.\nNova Scotia & PEI\n*Arthur Peters – consecrated February 2, 1982 and installed coadjutor February 2, 1982, installed as diocesan November 29, 1984, elected metropolitan of the province October 19, 1997 and title changed from \"Archbishop of Nova Scotia\" to \"Archbishop of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island\" in 1999.
