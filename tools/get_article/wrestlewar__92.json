It took place on May 17, 1992, from the Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum in Jacksonville, Florida in the United States. In 1993, WrestleWar was replaced by Slamboree as the May PPV and the event’s WarGames match moved to September’s Fall Brawl.\nTen matches were contested at the event including one dark match. The main event was a WarGames match, in which Sting's Squadron (Sting, Barry Windham, Dustin Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat and Nikita Koloff) defeated The Dangerous Alliance (Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton and Larry Zbyszko). Other featured matches on the card were Brian Pillman versus Tom Zenk for the Light Heavyweight Championship, Terry Taylor and Greg Valentine versus The Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin and Michael Hayes) and The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) versus Tatsumi Fujinami and Takayuki Iizuka to determine the number one contenders for the IWGP Tag Team Championship.\nIn 2014, all WCW pay-per-views were made available on the WWE Network.\nStorylines\nThe event featured wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nAt SuperBrawl II, Sting defeated Lex Luger in the main event to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Also at the event, Dangerous Alliance member Rick Rude successfully defended the United States Heavyweight Championship against Ricky Steamboat while Barry Windham and Dustin Rhodes defeated Alliance members Steve Austin and Larry Zbyszko in a tag team match. On the March 7 episode of World Championship Wrestling, Sting discussed his potential contenders for the title during a SuperBrawl II press conference until Dangerous Alliance interrupted him and Rude threw a drink in Sting's face which led to a brawl between Sting and Dangerous Alliance and Nikita Koloff made his return to WCW by coming to Sting's rescue. Steamboat continued his feud with Rude while Windham and Rhodes also resumed their rivalry with Austin and Zbyszko. On the March 21 episode of Worldwide, Big Van Vader attacked Sting after his match, causing Sting to suffer a rib injury and be out of action. Koloff would reveal his allegiance to Sting on the April 25 episode of Saturday Night by considering Sting his favorite wrestler. This would lead to a WarGames match between Sting's Squadron (Sting, Nikita Koloff, Barry Windham, Dustin Rhodes and Ricky Steamboat against Dangerous Alliance at WrestleWar.\nOn the April 11 episode of Saturday Night, Terry Taylor and Greg Valentine defeated The Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin) in a two out of three falls match to retain the United States Tag Team Championship. Two weeks later, on the April 25 episode of Saturday Night, Eric Bischoff announced that Taylor and Valentine would be defending the titles against Hayes and Garvin at WrestleWar.\nEvent\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Presenters\n|Tony Schiavone\n|-\n|Eric Bischoff\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Commentator\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|Jesse Ventura\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Gary Michael Cappetta\n|-\n|rowspan=3=|Referees\n|Bill Alfonso\n|-\n|Randy Anderson\n|-\n|Mike Adkins\n|-\n|}\nThe opening bout was a tag team match pitting Bob Cook and Firebreaker Chip against Diamond Dallas Page and Thomas Rich.

The Freebirds won the titles after Garvin gave Taylor a DDT and then pinned him.\nThe third bout was a singles match between Johnny B. Badd and Tracy Smothers. Badd won the match by pinfall after knocking Smothers out with a punch.\nFollowing the third bout, a vignette aired in which the Freebirds celebrated winning the WCW United States Tag Team Championship with the returning Precious.\nThe fourth bout was a singles match between Marcus Alexander Bagwell and Scotty Flamingo. Flamingo won the bout by pinfall using a roll-up.\nThe fifth bout was scheduled to be a tag team match pitting Cactus Jack and Mr. Hughes against Junkyard Dog and Ron Simmons.

Pillman pinned Zenk using a roll-up to retain his title.\nThe eighth bout was a tag team match pitting The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) against Takayuki Iizuka and Tatsumi Fujinami, with the winners to be named the number one contenders for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. The Steiner Brothers won the match when Rick Steiner pinned Iizuka following a super overhead belly-to-belly suplex.\nThe main event was a WarGames match pitting Sting's Squadron (Barry Windham, Dustin Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, Ricky Steamboat, and Sting) against The Dangerous Alliance (Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton, Larry Zbyszko, Rick Rude, and Steve Austin). The match ended when Zbyszko accidentally hit Eaton in the shoulder with the metal connector from a turnbuckle, enabling Sting to apply an armbar to Eaton and force him to submit.\nAftermath\nSteiner Brothers received their IWGP Tag Team Championship at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling show on June 26, 1992, where they defeated Big, Bad and Dangerous (Big Van Vader and Bam Bam Bigelow) to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship. On July 5, Steiner Brothers lost their WCW World Tag Team Championship to Terry Gordy and Steve Williams at a live event.\nResults\n|note1   = dark\n|match1  = Diamond Dallas Page and Thomas Rich defeated Bob Cook and Firebreaker Chip\n|stip1   = Tag team match\n|time1   = 08:05\n|match2  = The Freebirds (Michael Hayes and Jimmy Garvin) defeated Terry Taylor and Greg Valentine (c)\n|stip2   = Tag team match for the WCW United States Tag Team Championship\n|time2   = 16:02\n|match3  = Johnny B.
