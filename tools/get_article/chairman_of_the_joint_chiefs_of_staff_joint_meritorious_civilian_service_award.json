The award normally requires at least five years time in service but can be given for short duration deployments or details.  The level of service for this award should have been given the direct attention or led to direct interaction with the CJCS.\nDescription\nThe award is a silver plated medal with the Department of defense seal (eagle clutching arrows with an American shield in foreground) in front of two crossed swords and two vertical swords.  The medal is suspended from a light blue ribbon with a wide white center stripe and six dashed pin stripes, three on each side.\nReferences"
