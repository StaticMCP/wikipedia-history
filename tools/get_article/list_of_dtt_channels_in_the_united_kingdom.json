      "text": "# List of DTT channels in the United Kingdom\n\nThis is a list of the current channels available on digital terrestrial television (DTT) in the United Kingdom, and those that have been removed.\nAlmost all channels broadcast on DTT are free-to-air, with a limited number of subscription channels (requiring a subscription to a pay-TV package) and pay-per-view channels (requiring a one-off payment to view an event) also available. Most free-to-air channels are promoted as part of the Freeview line-up.\nThe vast majority of multiplexed channels use DVB-T 64-QAM modulation, for PAL (576i), radio and interactive channels. HDTV (1080i) channels use DVB-T2 256-QAM modulation and H.222 transports, while local channels use DVB-T QPSK modulation. All HD channels are encoded in H.264 and subject to a MPEG-LA controlled transmission patent licensing tax which is included in the Freeview broadcaster cost and varies on viewership figures. This tax is currently paid via one of three registered licensees: the BBC, ITV and Sky plc. The SD channels continue to use H.262, which does not incur any additional transmission costs.\nBelow is an overview of the multiplexes in use:\n* The PSB1 transport (operating name BBC A) is used solely for the standard definition PSB (public service broadcasting) services of the BBC.\n* The PSB2 transport (operating name D3&4) carries only standard definition versions of both the commercial broadcasters' PSB services and some of their commercial services.\n* The PSB3 transport (operating name BBC B) is used for HDTV versions of most of the BBC and commercial PSB services.\n* The COM4 (operating name SDN), COM5 (operating name ARQ A) and COM6 (operating name ARQ B) transports, which are only transmitted from main transmission sites, carry only standard definition commercial services.\n* LTVmux is a series of localised transports at certain transmitter sites carrying local and nationwide channels. Its availability is much less than that of the commercial COM transports. In addition to this, the NImux transport (operating name RNI_1) is only available in parts of Northern Ireland, and the GImux transport (operating name G_MAN) is only available in Greater Manchester.\n{| border=\"0\" class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\nGeneral Entertainment (Local TV) – High-definition – Children'sNews – Text services – Streamed channels – Interactive – Adult – Radio stations (BBC Local and Nations Radio) __NOTOC__\nChannels removed from digital terrestrial televisionSee also – References – External links\n|}\nChannel sections\nAbbreviations include:\n*Eng = England\n*Scot = Scotland\n*Wales = Wales\n*NI = Northern Ireland\n*CI = the Channel Islands\n*GrLdn = Greater London and surrounding areas\n*GrMcr = Greater Manchester and surrounding areas\n*Limited = Only available to all viewers using Freeview HD or Freeview Play equipment\nGeneral Entertainment\nThe channel numbers on Freeview (as of 19 November 2025) are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:3%;\"| NorDig LCN (SD)\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| DVB name\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Notes\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Licensee/Parent Company\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Broadcasthours\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Timeshares\n! style=\"width:7%;\"| H.222Transport\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Format\n|-\n|1\n|BBC One\n|13 regional variations for England, with variations in programming for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
