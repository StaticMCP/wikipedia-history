Byrd. The Confederates mistakenly believed that the Kingston garrison was weak, but in fact, it comprised a brigade of infantry and a regiment of mounted infantry. When Wheeler's cavalrymen began probing the Union position, they discovered that its defenders were too numerous, and the position was too strong. The Confederate cavalry withdrew to rejoin Lieutenant General James Longstreet's forces in the Siege of Knoxville, but Wheeler himself returned to the Army of Tennessee near Chattanooga.\nNotes\nReferences\n* |title=Battles and Leaders of the Civil War |volume=3 |year=1987 |orig-year=1883 |publisher=Castle |location=Secaucus, N.J. |isbn=0-89009-571-X }}\n*\n*\n*\n*"
