In 2007, Lucas described the project as \"one show that will split into four shows, focusing on different characters.\" It entered development in early 2009. The series was described as \"gritty and dark\" and was expected to feature characters such as Han Solo, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Boba Fett, C-3PO, and Emperor Palpatine. Lucas described the series as \"more talky. It's more of what I would call a soap opera with a bunch of personal dramas in it. It's not really based on action-adventure films from the '30s—it's actually more based on film noir movies from the '40s!\" Producer Rick McCallum revealed the working title, Star Wars: Underworld, in 2012, and that it would focus on criminal and political power struggles in the \"period when the Empire is trying to take things over.\"\nOver one hundred 42-minute episodes were planned, with 50 scripts written. These were mostly second drafts, but due to their complex content, were too expensive to produce. Ronald D. Moore was one of the writers, and extensive artwork including character, costume, and set designs were developed at Skywalker Ranch under the close supervision of Lucas and McCallum. The project was still being considered after Lucasfilm was sold to Disney, including by ABC, with stories being reviewed . According to Kathleen Kennedy,\nThe plot of the anthology film Rogue One was originally pitched as an episode of the series. The story of Han winning the Millennium Falcon from Lando was planned to be featured and later developed as Solo: A Star Wars Story. The planet Daiyu portrayed in Obi-Wan Kenobi is similar to the atmosphere of level 1313 of Coruscant which George Lucas wanted to show. Boba Fett was also reported to appear in the show; Star Wars author, Karen Traviss, was to write a novel involving Boba Fett, but the project was reportedly canceled because of possible conflicts with the TV series. In early 2020, Stargate Studios shared test footage made to promote the series to networks, as well as a Google Doc listing production details for the series.\nDetours\nStar Wars Detours is an unaired animated parody series from the creators of Robot Chicken, which was postponed in 2013 and ultimately unaired. Production began in 2012 prior to the Disney acquisition, with 39 episodes completed and 62 additional scripts finished.\nRangers of the New Republic\nThe Mandalorian§Spin-offs}}\nIn December 2020, Rangers of the New Republic was announced. Developed by Favreau and Filoni, it was planned to tie into The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka. Variety reported in May 2021 that the series was not in active development. In an interview with Empire published in November 2021, Kathleen Kennedy said development had not reached a point where scripts were written and that she felt some of the ideas for the series would \"figure into future episodes ... of the next iteration of Mandalorian\". Empire cited Gina Carano's departure from Lucasfilm as a possible reason for the halting of the series, implying that her character, Cara Dune, was intended to star in it. A Mandalorian spin-off series centered on her character had been rumored by late 2020, but after Carano posted controversial social media statements in November 2020 and February 2021, Disney severed ties with the actress.\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
