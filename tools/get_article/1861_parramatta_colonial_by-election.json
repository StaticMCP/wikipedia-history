      "text": "# 1861 Parramatta colonial by-election\n\nA by-election was held for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly electorate of Parramatta on 10 April 1861 caused by the resignation of sitting member James Byrnes. At the election in December 1860 he gained second place behind a newcomer John Lackey. While still successful, Byrnes took offence at being placed second, stating that the majority of voters had decided that he was not fit to serve them and resigned in March 1861 without taking his seat.\nDates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
