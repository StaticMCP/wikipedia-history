The inscription inside the ding documents that Prince Wu worshipped his ancestors and prayed for his offspring. Wu was a son of King Zhuang.]]\nKing Zhuang of Chu (), personal name Xiong Lü, was a monarch of the Chu state. He was one of the \"Five Hegemons\" who attempted to wrest control of China during the Spring and Autumn period.\nLife\nThe son of King Mu, King Zhuang ascended the throne in 613&nbsp;BC. According to a legend in the Records of the Grand Historian, for the first three years of his reign King Zhuang wasted time in pleasure-seeking, but, when challenged by two courtiers, reformed his ways.\nThe king made Sunshu Ao his chancellor. Sunshu Ao began a series of major dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir in modern-day northern Anhui.\nAfter some military successes, King Zhuang attempted to usurp King Ding of Zhou. According to a well-known story, probably an invention of the Warring States period, he asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the legendary Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China, but was rebuffed. This incident gave rise to the chengyu \"to enquire about ding in the central plains\", i.e. to have great ambitions (|s=问鼎中原|first=t|p=wèn dǐng zhōngyuán}}).\nIn the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the state of Jin. His progress from lazy regent to hegemon gave rise to the Chinese chengyu \"amaze others with one cry\" (|s=一鸣惊人|first=t|p=yī míng jīngrén}}).\nReferences"
