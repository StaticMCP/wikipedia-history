The minister is a member of the King's Privy Council for Canada and the Canadian Cabinet.\nSteven Guilbeault has been the minister of Canadian identity and culture since March 14, 2025; he previously held the role from 2019 to 2021. The minister is selected by the prime minister and appointed by the Crown. The role was created in 1996 as the minister of Canadian heritage () to lead the government's culture, media, sports, and arts initiatives. In March 2025, the role was renamed as the minister of Canadian culture and identity, Parks Canada and Quebec lieutenant, and the portfolio assumed responsibility for Parks Canada. The simplified title was adopted in May 2025.\nHistory\nThe position was created in 1996 as the Minister of Canadian Heritage to combine the posts of minister of multiculturalism and citizenship and minister of communications. The \"status of women\" was merged from the minister responsible for the status of women in 2006. In 2008, the status of women portfolio was transferred to a minister of state.\nOn August 16, 2013, the multiculturalism portfolio was assigned to Jason Kenney, who was appointed minister for multiculturalism in addition to his other portfolios.\nThose portfolios and responsibilities such as for the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, were returned to the heritage minister with the swearing in of the 29th Canadian Ministry in November 2015. The heritage minister also gained responsibility for the National Capital Commission, which was formerly under the senior Ottawa-area cabinet minister under the Harper government; and the Canadian secretary to the Queen, which was previously under the Privy Council Office.\nThe position was modified slightly on March 14, 2025, at the start of the 30th Canadian Ministry, gaining responsibility for Parks Canada from the Minister of Environment and Climate Change and being officially renamed the Minister of Canadian Culture and Identity, Parks Canada and Quebec Lieutenant  (); while the role of Quebec lieutenant had previously been held by Pablo Rodriguez during his stint as Minister of Canadian Heritage, this was the first time the role of Quebec lieutenant was formally included in the minister's title.\nIn May 2025, the position was renamed to Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture.\nTraditionally, the minister attends the Juno Awards to present the awards for Breakthrough Artist and Breakthrough Group Of The Year.\nList of ministers\nKey:\n|Liberal Party of Canada|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|Conservative Party of Canada|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!No.\n!Portrait\n!Name\n!colspan=2|Term of office\n!Political party\n!Ministry\n|-\n! colspan=7|Minister of Canadian Heritage\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 1\n|\n| Sheila Copps\n| July 12, 1996 || December 11, 2003\n|rowspan=3| Liberal\n| 26 (Chrétien)\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 2\n|\n| Hélène Scherrer\n| December 12, 2003 || July 19, 2004\n|rowspan=2| 27 (Martin)\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 3\n|\n| Liza Frulla\n| July 20, 2004 || February 5, 2006\n|-\n! colspan=7|Minister of Canadian Heritage and Status of Women\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\"| 4\n|\n| Bev Oda\n| February 6, 2006 || August 14, 2007\n|rowspan=2| Conservative\n|rowspan=2| 28 (Harper)\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\"| 5\n|\n| Josée Verner\n| August 14, 2007 || October 29, 2008\n|-\n! colspan=7|Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\"| 6\n|\n| James Moore\n| October 30, 2008 || July 15, 2013\n|rowspan=2| Conservative\n|rowspan=2| 28 (Harper)\n|-\n! style=\"background:;\"| 7\n|\n| Shelly Glover\n| July 15, 2013 || November 4, 2015\n|-\n! colspan=7|Minister of Canadian Heritage\n|-\n! style=\"background:; color:white\"| 8\n|\n| Mélanie Joly\n| November 4, 2015 || July 18, 2018\n| rowspan=1| Liberal\n| rowspan=1| 29 (J.
