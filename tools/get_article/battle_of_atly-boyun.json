It ended in a significant victory for the rebels and marked an important moment in the early military career of Imam Ghazi Muhammad.\nBackground\nImam Ghazi Muhammad had been actively spreading the doctrines of muridism throughout Dagestan and Chechnya since the 1820s. His growing influence led to the formation of a devoted corps of ascetic disciples known as shikhs. His message found strong support among the Kumyks of the Tarki Shamkhalate. According to N. Dubrovnin, the Kumyks became the first nucleus of Ghazi Muhammad’s armed forces.\nFollowing an earlier failure near Khunzakh, Ghazi Muhammad moved operations to the plains and settled in Aghach-kala. When the exiled Kumyk noble Irazi-bek Kazanishensky joined him, several major villages in the Shamkhalate revolted and pledged allegiance to the Imamate. By the time their combined forces reached the village of Atly-Boyun, their numbers had grown to approximately 2,000 fighters.\nThe Battle\nMajor General Maxim Maximovich Taube led over 1,000 Russian troops toward Atly-Boyun, including the Butyrsky Infantry Regiment, four artillery guns, and Cossack detachments. A second detachment under Lieutenant Colonel von Disterlo (Kurinsky Regiment) was supposed to launch a simultaneous attack, but did not arrive in time.\nRussian forces advanced through a narrow gorge and encountered multiple barricades. The rebels had occupied the surrounding slopes, delivering heavy fire on the advancing troops. A local militia expected to aid the Russians defected to the rebels during the battle.\nDespite initial progress past one barricade, Russian forces came under crossfire from two more and suffered significant losses. Taube eventually ordered a retreat and regrouped at the Shamkhal mills, seven versts from the battlefield.\nAftermath\nThe defeat at Atly-Boyun was a major setback for Russian forces. It not only boosted the military prestige of Ghazi Muhammad but also expanded support for muridism across the North Caucasus. The Russian failure opened the path for rebel forces toward the fortress of Burnaya, near the capital of the Shamkhalate.\nSee also\n* Caucasian War\n* Ghazi Muhammad\n* Tarki Shamkhalate\n* History of the Kumyks\nReferences\nSources\n* Baddeley, J.
