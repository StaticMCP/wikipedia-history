      "text": "# Gaiking: Legend of Daiku-Maryu\n\nis a Super Robot mecha anime series produced by Toei Animation. It is a re-imagining of the original series created by Go Nagai (who also created Mazinger Z) and was aired in TV Asahi from November 12, 2005 to September 24, 2006, lasting a total of 39 episodes.\nPlot\nFive years ago, Daiya Tsuwabuki was on a fishing trip with his father when giant monsters attacked. Daiya was saved by the crew of Daiku Maryu. In the present, he believes that his father is still alive, but no one believes him, not even his own mother. When the same monsters attack the city, Daiya becomes the pilot of Gaiking and joins Daiku Maryu as they go to the world of Darius to stop them from conquering the Earth.\nSeries differences\nThis version features a completely different story and main character, but some of the names are similar to the original series. Both Daikū Maryū and Gaiking have similar designs to the originals: Gaiking's torso is still skull shaped, the support machines come from Daikū Maryū. Gaiking also uses its Face Open attack in manner different from the original. Two of Daiku Maryu's weapons from the original series, Miracle Drill and Giant Cutter, are attached to Daichi Maryu and Tenkuu Maryu in this series. There are also differences in terms of location setting and Daiku-Maryu's ability to jump across both Earth and the Underground World from the use of the Dimensional Jump. Additionally, while Daiya has the same last name as Sanshiro (Tsuwabaki), the two characters are not related.\nCast\n* Daiya Tsuwabuki  Mayumi Tanaka\n* Sakon  Hideyuki Tanaka\n* Naoto Hayami  Naomi Shindō\n* Puria  Reiko Kiuchi\n* Daimon-jiisan  Ryûzaburô Ôtomo\n* Shizuka Fujiyama  Satsuki Yukino\n* Doctor Wan  Shinji Nakae\n* Jian Xin  Takeshi Kusao\n* Vice-captain Rosa  Tomoe Hanba\n* Lulu  Tomoko Kawakami\n* Captain Garis  Tōru Ōkawa\nSongs\n* \"GAIKING\" by Psychic Lover (OP, EP 39 Ending)\n* \"Boku ni dekiru koto\" by Hideaki Tokunaga (ED1)\n* \"oh! my god\" by Psychic Lover (ED2)\nAppearance in games\nGaiking: Legend of Daikū Maryū is included in the 2009 Super Robot Wars game, Super Robot Wars K for the Nintendo DS.
