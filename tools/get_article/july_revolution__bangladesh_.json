It began in early June 2024 and was led by the Students Against Discrimination. Coinciding with the first anniversary of the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, on 5 August 2025, the revolution received constitutional acknowledgment with the announcement of the July Declaration, and it has been described as the world's first Gen Z revolution.\nThe movement escalated into a full-fledged mass uprising after the government carried out mass killings of protesters, known as the July massacre, by late July. The killings of people like Abu Sayed and Mir Mahfuzur Rahman Mugdho escalated the movement significantly. Amnesty International blamed the government's \"heavy-handed response\" for causing the death of \"students, journalists, and bystanders\" and demanded that the Hasina-led \"government of Bangladesh urgently end this repression.\" Human Rights Watch had also called on foreign governments to urge Hasina to \"end the use of excessive force against protesters and hold troops to account for human rights abuses.\" HRW's deputy Asia director had also highlighted \"unfettered security force abuses against anyone who opposes the Sheikh Hasina government.\"\nBy early August, the movement evolved into a non-cooperation movement, ultimately leading to the ouster of the then-prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India. Hasina's ouster triggered a constitutional crisis, leading to the formation of an interim government led by economist Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.\nNames\nJuly Revolution, July Mass Uprising and ''Student-People's Uprising'' are the most widely used names of the movement. On 3 August, one of the coordinators of the anti-discrimination student movement, Nahid Islam said, \"We haven't gone to August yet. We will go to August only after this July killings are judged.\" As a result, the movement is known as the \"July Revolution\". On the other hand, on 11 September, in an address to the nation, the chief adviser Muhammad Yunus referred to the events as the \"July Revolution\" and the ''\"Student–Worker–People's uprising\"'' against fascism.\nOther names of the protests include Monsoon Revolution, 2024 Bangladesh Revolution, and Gen Z Revolution.\nBackground\nAfter the Awami League was elected in the 2008 elections, they abolished the caretaker government system. After that, it won three more consecutive national elections. There were allegations of massive rigging in the national elections held in 2014, 2018 and 2024. Meanwhile, except for the 2018 election, the remaining two elections were boycotted by most political parties in Bangladesh. During this time, the government carried out massive torture and arrests on their opponents, the top leaders of the opposition parties were sidelined by sentencing them in various cases. At this time, dissemination of information in all media in Bangladesh was strictly regulated and freedom of public expression was strictly regulated through laws such as the Digital Security Act, 2018. Since taking office in 2009, Sheikh Hasina's Awami League has largely failed to fulfill job creation promises. While the public sector has expanded with better pay and benefits, political influence  determined access to these jobs.\nDuring this period, the government was reported to have used law enforcement forces and Awami League affiliates, particularly the Chhatra League, to manage and suppress various movements, including non-political ones. Allegations of violence and repression involving the Chhatra League were reported on multiple institutions and university campuses. Over the last three terms, allegations of corruption, money laundering, declining reserves, and irregularities in the banking sector were raised against Awami League leaders at various levels of government. These issues were associated with rising living costs and growing public dissatisfaction. They also detained many dissent in the name of counterterrorism.\nHistory\nQuota reform movement\n\")]]\nIn 2018, a mass movement was held in Bangladesh demanding quota reform in government jobs, led by the General Students' Rights Protection Council. The main objective of this movement was to reform the ongoing quota system in Class I and II government jobs. Following the continuation of the agitation and pressure from the students, the government announced the abolition of the 46-year-old quota system.\nHowever, in 2021, seven children of freedom fighters, including Ahidul Islam, filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging this decision. Finally, on 5 June 2024, a High Court bench of Justice KM Kamrul Quader and Justice Khizir Hayat declared the decision to scrap the quota system invalid. Immediately after the announcement of the verdict, students started protesting against this verdict in various universities of the country.\nThe movement became more intense in July, with students staging blockades including the \"Bangla Blockade\". During this time, police used excessive force to quell the agitation led to clashes and a student named Abu Sayed was shot dead by the police in Rangpur. This incident intensified the movement and increased tension across the country.\nAfter that, the movement across the country including Dhaka became violent and many casualties were caused by the attacks of law enforcement agencies, Chhatra League and Jubo League in various places. At this time, curfew was imposed across the country and the internet was shut down. The hearing date of the Appellate Division was later brought forward due to the agitation.\nThe anti-discrimination student movement gained momentum when private university students joined on 16 July. In response to the escalating quota reform movement, the government mandated the closure of all educational institutions on 16 July 2024. Subsequently, on 17 July, students residing in dormitories at public universities across the nation, including Dhaka University, were compelled to vacate their accommodations. However, due to the permanent residency of a significant portion of private university students in Dhaka, their presence within the city noticeably increased on 18 July.\nOn this date, a substantial confrontation occurred between law enforcement and students affiliated with Primeasia University, BRAC University and East West University in the Rampura area. Simultaneously, students from AIUB, North South University, Independent University, Bangladesh, Dhaka International University and UIU staged demonstrations along Kuril Bishwa Road and Pragati Sarani. Concurrently, protests were initiated by students from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh University of Textiles, Southeast University in Mohakhali area and Northern University in the Uttara region.\nRazakar slogans\nusing the Razakar slogans on 14 July 2024 at 11:30 p.m. (BST)]]\nOn 14 July, during a press conference, Sheikh Hasina responded to a question about the protests stating,\n}}\nIn response to Sheikh Hasina's comment, in the early hours of 15 July, students began using slogans such as,\n.}}\nProtesters argued that Hasina's statement indirectly labelled them as \"Razakars\" and demeaned them for advocating for quota reform, which led them to adopt the slogan.\nInternet outage\nTo prevent the movement from spreading nationwide, the government ordered the internet to be shut down across the country. The nationwide shutdown of Internet access begun on 18 July continued into 19 July.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division on the case\nOn 4 July, the Appellate Division, on 9 June declared the government's decision to cancel the Muktijoddha quota system in the first and second category of government jobs invalid without hearing the state party's application seeking a stay of the High Court's judgment. And upheld the verdict of the High Court for the time being. The state party is asked to file 'leave to appeal'. At that time, the then Chief Justice Obaidul Hasan said, the movement is happening, so be it. Do you change the verdict of the High Court by protesting on the streets?\nLater on 10 July, the Appellate Division issued a four-week status quo order on the High Court verdict along with some observations and directions in view of the petition filed by the state party and two students. 7 August had been fixed for the next hearing.\nWhen the full judgment of the High Court was published on 14 July, leave to appeal was filed by the state and two students. Based on the application of Attorney General AM Amin Uddin on 18 July, the Chamber Court of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Justice M Inayetur Rahim fixed the date of hearing the case on Sunday, 21 July.\nOn 21 July, the Appellate Division reinstated the quota and quashed the judgment given by the High Court. At the same time, even though it is a policy-making matter for the government, in the interest of complete justice according to the constitution, the court ordered 93 percent merit-based recruitment in government jobs. On this day, for the first time in the history of Bangladesh, the proceedings of the Supreme Court were held under curfew.\nMassacre\nBy early August 2024, the unrest resulted in a significant death toll. Initial official reports claimed 215 deaths, but a United Nations investigation later confirmed that at least 650 people were killed. In August, the Interim Government's Health and Welfare Adviser, Nurjahan Begum, reported that over 1,000 individuals had been killed in the uprising and more than 400 students had lost their eyesight. Additionally, more than 20,000 were injured, and over 11,000 were arrested nationwide. Among the deceased were at least 32 children, according to UNICEF. The exact number of casualties remains uncertain due to government restrictions on information, including reports that hospitals were barred from sharing data, CCTV footage was confiscated, and some victims were buried without identification.  the death toll is over one thousand.\nThe massacre, which have been referred to as the July massacre prompted significant criticism and calls for accountability. The University Teachers Network held a demonstration at the University of Dhaka, expressing concern over the violence.\nProtibadi Nagorik Somaj condemned the killings during the movement, describing them as a massacre and expressing doubts about the judiciary's ability to deliver impartial justice, as the inquiry commission was formed by the fifth Hasina government, which is also accused of involvement in the massacre. Some academics rejected the government-established public inquiry commission, calling for intervention from the United Nations.\nIn Sylhet, Nagorik Alem Somaj organized a protest criticizing the killings.\nSheikh Hasina, in her first public statement published through her son Sajeeb Wazed, since being ousted from power, called for an investigation into the deaths during the protests, while also asserting that the police and the Awami League were victims of \"terrorist aggression.\"\nGovinda Pramanik, president of the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance, alleged that the government had killed over 500 innocent people to maintain power, urging that the events be prosecuted at the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh.\nSeveral labor unions and organizations also criticized the killings, demanding justice for those who lost their lives during the July massacre.\nA protest march under the banner of Chittagong University Chhatra Dal in Chattogram demanded prosecution against Sheikh Hasina for the massacre.\nThe Left Democratic Alliance, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal and the Anti-Fascist Left Front criticized the Awami League government rule, urging financial compensation for the families of those killed in the protests and free medical care for the injured. Similarly, the National Democratic Party demanded  in compensation for the families of those who died during the massacre, along with a government job for at least one member of each affected family.\nIslami Andolan Bangladesh called for an independent tribunal to ensure justice for the victims of the massacre. In addition, the People's Rights Party called for all political parties within the Grand Alliance, including Awami League, to be barred from future elections.\nNon-cooperation movement\nOn 4 August, thousands of protesters gathered at the Shahbag intersection in the morning, obstructing it as a form of civil disobedience to demand the government's resignation.\nFollowing the start of the Non-cooperation movement, various left-wing organisations in Bangladesh took part in protests. The Proletarian Party of East Bengal for example began a graffiti campaign within the city following the fall of Hasina and the Awami League aimed at criticising the army and calling for an end to military rule. Other far-left student groups also took part in the revolution, such as the Revolutionary Student-Youth Movement, a Marxist–Leninist-Maoist organisation.\nAt least 97 people died nationwide in confrontations, shootings, and pursuits related to the Non-cooperation movement. Fourteen police officers were killed across the country, with 13 deaths occurring at the Enayetpur police station in Sirajganj. Another officer was killed in Eliotganj, Comilla. Twenty-seven police facilities were attacked and vandalized, and a hundred policemen were injured in these incidents, according to an official statement by the Bangladesh Police.\nIn Dhaka, unidentified individuals set fire to and damaged various vehicles, including cars, ambulances, motorcycles, and buses, at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University during the protests. Around 4.30&nbsp;pm, eleventh-grade student Golam Nafiz was shot by the police in Dhaka Farmgate area, whose photo of being taken to the hospital on rickshaw went viral on internet, creating high outrage by netizens. By 12:00&nbsp;pm, users across the country reported internet inaccessibility. The government ordered the closure of Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and all other Meta-owned services, directing internet service providers to comply after 1:00&nbsp;pm.\nThe government declared a three-day general holiday starting from 5 August, during which banks will also remain closed. The Anti-Discrimination Students Movement confirmed their intention to march towards Dhaka on 6 August to demand the Prime Minister's resignation. The Bangladesh University Teachers' Network proposed a framework for an interim government, suggesting it be composed of teachers, judges, lawyers, and representatives from civil society, reflecting the views of various civil and political groups for a democratic transition.\nAsif Mahmud, a coordinator of the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement, announced that their march to Dhaka had been rescheduled to 5 August, instead of 6 August. He called on protesters and civilians nationwide to march toward the capital and participate in civil disobedience.\nSeveral former Bangladesh Army officers, including former chief of staff Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan, held a press briefing urging soldiers to return to camps and refrain from getting involved in the political crisis or being used against civilians.\nRetired Brig. Gen. M. Sakhawat Hossain stated that there was significant unease among the troops, which likely pressured the chief of army staff as soldiers were deployed and witnessing the events. Retired officers, including Brig. Gen. Mohammad Shahedul Anam Khan, defied the curfew on Monday and took to the streets, with Khan noting that the army did not intervene. In response to calls for a march to Dhaka, DMP Commissioner Habibur Rahman warned of zero tolerance, stating that legal action would be taken against curfew violators.\nThe Anti-discrimination Students Movement rejected the curfew and encouraged everyone to march towards the Ganabhaban and Prime minister's office.\nIn the morning of 5 August 2024, units of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police and Armed Police Battalion did Chankharpul massacre to hold the area of Dhaka and disperse the approaching participants of the Long March to Dhaka, at first the police were firing tear gas, sound grenades, and rubber bullets. However, some like constable Md. Sujon Hossain.  of the Armed Police Battalion, would fire live bullets indiscriminately at the protestors, leading to the deaths of seven people.\nReports indicated Sheikh Hasina had been moved to a secure location. On the same day, up to 135 people, including 24 police officers, were killed during protests.\nResignation of Sheikh Hasina\nHasina resigned on 5 August 2024, as large crowds of demonstrators surrounded the prime minister's residence. Her resignation was announced by General Waker-uz-Zaman, the Chief of the Army Staff.}} Later that day, Hasina fled to India in a chaotic departure, first by car, then by helicopter, and finally by plane. She left with no resignation speech. to India.|name=\"Multiplereference1\"}} Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar told the Parliament, \"At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India.\" Her son, Sajeeb Wazed, initially said that she would not return to politics and planned to \"stay in Delhi for a little while\" before her next destination, but subsequently said on 7 August that she and the Awami League would remain active in the Bangladeshi political scene and that she would return to the country once elections were declared. He also insisted that Sheikh Hasina was still the prime minister, saying that she was unable to formally submit her resignation after being forced to flee from the protesters. Hasina had hoped to go to London, but the United Kingdom reportedly rebuffed initial overtures seeking political asylum. She reportedly considered seeking temporary residence in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, or Qatar. Because her nephew lives in Finland, that country was speculated as a possible destination. Although Sajeeb Wazed lives in the U.S., she is considered unlikely to seek asylum there, as the U.S. government criticized her rule in Bangladesh.\nHasina was living in a secret location in India under tight security as of August 2024. Sajeeb Wazed said that the protests which led to her resignation had support from a foreign intelligence agency, without naming any country. In a statement published in the Indian media on 11 August, she accused the United States of influencing her resignation, and previously accused the United States of conspiring to oust her in the Jatiya Sangsad. However, Wazed called the statement \"false and fabricated\" and said Hasina \"did not give any statement before or after leaving Dhaka\". The White House also denied allegations of any US involvement. On 13 August, Hasina released her first confirmed statements since her overthrow published by Wazed Joy calling for an investigation into the killings made during the protests, while insisting that police and the Awami League were also victims of \"terrorist aggression\".\nOutside Bangladesh\n, Italy protesting in support of the movement.]]\nIn India, the All India Democratic Students Organisation staged a protest in Kolkata in support of the Bangladeshi students.}}\nIn Nepal, on 20 July, the All Nepal National Free Students Union held a rally in solidarity with the quota reform movement in Bangladesh and to protest the killing of students.\nThe Bangladeshi diaspora in Italy, Canada, France, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the Maldives, the United Kingdom and Malta protested in solidarity with the protesters in Bangladesh.\nIn the UAE, a demonstration by Bangladeshi labourers also opposed the suppression of protesters, however, several of them were charged with holding protests and violating the UAE's laws against public demonstrations. Following a trial on 21 July, three defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment for \"rioting\", while 54 others received sentences ranging from 10 to 11 years and were ordered to be deported upon release. Human Rights Watch condemned their arrest, citing the country's restrictive laws and labour conditions as violations of human rights. A Bangladeshi lawyer, Wolora Afrin Rasna was hired by the country's interim government to secure the release of those imprisoned. Md. Touhid Hossain stated that Muhammad Yunus vowed that he would personally approach senior Emirati authorities to seek the release of those detained, and would also contact the \"concerned government\", if necessary. The detainees were later pardoned by UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on 3 September.\nThe Ministry's Spokesperson Fathimath Rifath said that expatriate workers in the Maldives are barred from political involvement in such an act, which amounted to a visa violation.\nFall of the government\nOn 4 August, thousands of protesters convened at Dhaka's Shahbag intersection in the morning, obstructing it as a form of civil disobedience to demand the resignation of the government. This was followed by hundreds of casualties. The following day, the protesters called for the \"Long March to Dhaka\" in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Sheikh Hasina to resign.\nThe long march of crowded people to Ganabhaban forced her to resign. She, along with her sister Sheikh Rehana, then fled the country to India via military on 5 August 2024.\nFollowing the overthrow of the Awami League, the Revolutionary Workers Party of Bangladesh organised a student assembly to meet with the interim government and consult on the policies of said government, meeting with parties like the BNP. While the Left Democratic Alliance held a conference on 11 August calling for the  reconstitution of the Election Commission to initiate national parliamentary elections. The LDA called for \"an immediate overhaul of the electoral system, including the introduction of a “no\" vote option, recall of elected representatives failing to meet public expectations, and the adoption of a proportional representation electoral system.\"  In addition, as the interim government was formed in Bangladesh, it sat with various political parties on 5 October meeting with the BNP, Jamaat, Gantantra Mancha, Left Democratic Alliance, Hefazat-e-Islam, and Islami Andolan attending.\nDeath toll\nBy early August 2024, the unrest resulted in a significant death toll. Initial official reports claimed 215 deaths, but a United Nations investigation later confirmed that at least 650 people were killed. In August, the Interim Government's Health and Welfare Adviser, Nurjahan Begum, reported that over 1,000 individuals had been killed in the uprising and more than 400 students had lost their eyesight. Additionally, more than 20,000 were injured, and over 11,000 were arrested nationwide. Among the deceased were at least 32 children, according to UNICEF. In January 2025, the interim government of Bangladesh published a gazette containing the initial finalized list of 834 recorded deaths. However, the actual number of casualties may be higher due to restrictions imposed by the previous government, which included barring hospitals from sharing data, confiscating CCTV footage, and burying some victims without proper identification.\nOn 12 February 2025, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights published a thorough report on the events that took place from 1 July to 5 August 2024, which suggested a death toll of 1,400.\nSelected individual deaths\nAbu Sayed\nAbu Sayed (;  – 16 July 2024) was a Bangladeshi student activist and revolutionary who was shot dead by the Bangladesh Police on 16 July 2024, while participating in the 2024 Bangladesh quota reform movement.

His death is widely recognised as a pivotal point in the July Revolution.\nGolam Nafiz\nMd. Golam Nafiz (; 22 May 2008 – 4 August 2024), was a Bangladeshi student activist who died in the non-cooperation movement on 4 August 2024. He was photographed on a rickshaw on the way to the hospital, the image of which was well-publicized among the many fatalities of the July Revolution.\nAftermath\nViolence\nFormation of interim government\nBangladesh's army chief Waker-uz-Zaman, announced on 5 August 2024, that an interim government would be formed in the country after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India.\nOn 8 August 2024, Muhammad Yunus took oath as the Chief Advisor of the Interim Government of Bangladesh in Bangabhaban, Dhaka in the presence of President Mohammed Shahabuddin.\nConstitutional crisis\nA constitutional crisis emerged on 5 August 2024, following Sheikh Hasina's resignation, because the existing constitution has no provisions for an interim government or any other form of government in the event that the prime minister resigns and the parliament is dissolved. Although  mandates general elections within 90 days following the dissolution of parliament, no clear guidelines exist for the powers and structure of an interim government. Following the oath-taking of the interim government, student leader and ICT adviser Nahid Islam announced that a constituent assembly election would be held to draft and adopt a new constitution to resolve the crisis. The interim government also established a Constitutional Reform Commission to prepare a roadmap for the constituent assembly election.\nAlleged judicial coup attempt\nOn 10 August 2024, a plenary meeting of the Appellate Division judges was scheduled, a move considered irregular and unconstitutional by many observers, including LDP Secretary-general Redwan Ahmed. This meeting was perceived as a prelude to issuing a ruling that could undermine the interim government and potentially pave the way for Hasina's return.\nHasnat Abdullah, one of the coordinators of the Anti-discrimination Students Movement, called for protests to be held at the Supreme Court premise. Mass protests erupted outside the Supreme Court, with hundreds of students under the banner of Anti-discrimination Students Movement, lawyers, and civil society members demanding Hassan's resignation. They accused him of attempting to use the judiciary to restore Hasina to power, calling him a \"puppet\" of the former regime. Asif Mahmud, one of the Adviser to the interim government, criticized Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan for convening a full court meeting of the court's Appellate Division without consulting the government and demanded his resignation. The judges including Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan resigned following the protests.\nFormation of a political party by activists\nIt was initiated by the Students Against Discrimination and the Jatiya Nagorik Committee. It was established on 28 February 2025 as the first student-led political party in the history of Bangladesh.\nSubsequent protests\nPolice strike\nOn 6 August, the Bangladesh Police Service Association initiated a strike, demanding enhanced security measures for its members. The association expressed regret for the role of the police force in the recent unrest and violence. It stated that its officers were \"forced to open fire\", subsequently being portrayed as the \"villain.\" Students and several paramilitary personnel were subsequently seen directing traffic and maintaining law and order functions in Dhaka, while Bangladesh Air Force personnel were deployed to secure Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. The newly appointed Inspector-General of Police, Md. Moinul Islam, issued an order for all officers to report for duty by the evening of 8 August. On 11 August, retired Brigadier General M Sakhawat Hossain, serving as the adviser for home affairs in the interim government, appealed to police officers to resume their duties at their respective stations. He provided assurances that their grievances would be addressed and their demands fulfilled. The strike ended on 11 August following a meeting between the association and the interim government. By 15 August, regular operations at all 639 police stations nationwide had resumed.\nBangladesh Bank protest\nOn 7 August, several officials from the Bangladesh Bank initiated a protest near the governor's office. Their objective was to compel the resignation of certain high-ranking officials due to their alleged involvement in corruption. That same day, one of the bank's deputy governors resigned, with three others expressing their intention to follow suit. On 9 August, the bank's governor, Abdur Rouf Talukder, resigned from his position, citing personal reasons.\nHindu rights protest\n]]\nOn 9 August, the Bangladesh Hindu Jagran Mancha organized a protest in Dhaka condemning the attacks on Hindus. The group called for the establishment of a Ministry of Minorities and a Minority Protection Commission, the implementation of strict laws against attacks on minorities, and a 10% quota in parliament for minority groups. Protests against anti-Hindu attacks were also held in Tangail and Khulna.\nAwami League demonstration\nOn 9 August, thousands of Awami League supporters staged a two-hour blockade on a section of the Dhaka–Khulna highway in Gopalganj, demanding Sheikh Hasina's return. The next day, an intervention by the army to disperse the protestors escalated into a confrontation. The clash resulted in 15 individuals being injured and an army vehicle being set ablaze.\nResistance Week\nOn 13 August, the Students Against Discrimination announced a campaign called Resistance Week, centred around four key demands. These demands included the creation of a special tribunal for the speedy trials of the massacre during the quota reform and non-cooperation movements; justice for the attacks on minorities following Sheikh Hasina's resignation; the removal of government officials who supported the government, opposed the movement and suppressed the activists; and ensuring equality for discriminated officials in government sectors.\nOccupation of Dhanmondi 32\nOn 15 August, protesters occupied the Dhanmondi 32 area of Dhaka to prevent Awami League supporters from marching to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence to commemorate the anniversary of his assassination in 1975, a day designated by the Hasina administration as a National Day of Mourning. Thirty people were held by protesters on suspicion of association with the Awami League, particularly those who were found to be carrying images of Sheikh Mujibur or other information relating to the Awami League in their possession or on mobile phones. Protesters were also accused of harassing journalists filming the event following complaints by correspondents from Reuters, The New York Times, and other media outlets. An Awami League activist was injured in the incident and later succumbed of his injuries on 30 August.\nThe BNP also called for a nationwide sit-in on 15 and 16 August, demanding that Sheikh Hasina be put on trial for genocide in connection with the killings of protesters.\nAnsar protest\nOn 25 August 2024, a faction of the Bangladesh Ansar, a paramilitary force responsible for securing government installations and assisting law enforcement, protested at the Bangladesh Secretariat. They demanded the nationalisation of their jobs and the abolition of the six-month \"rest system\", a mandatory leave period after three consecutive years of work. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, Home Affairs Advisor of the interim government, met with the protesters, announcing a preliminary decision to abolish the rest system. He also assured them that a forthcoming committee would review their demand for job nationalisation. Despite this, the Ansar members were dissatisfied due to the lack of immediate guarantees regarding job nationalisation. Later that day, a clash between Ansar members and a group of students resulted in 50 injuries. On 26 August 303 Ansar members were arrested for unlawful assembly, and nine Deputy Directors and ten Directors of Ansar were transferred from their posts. The DMP prohibited any rallies, meetings, or demonstrations in the vicinity of the Bangladesh Secretariat and the Chief Adviser's residence. One person later died of injuries they sustained after being caught in the clashes on 4 September.\nJumma protest\nOn 20 September, a protest march was organized by a Jumma students' body, starting from the Raju Sculpture and ending at Shahbag, to protest against the recent violence targeting Jummas in Khagrachhari.\nGender-based violence and public backlash\nOn 24 February 2025, a protest march was organised, starting from the Shahid Minar to the Secretariat, demanding among many things the resignation of Adviser of Home Affairs, Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, for his perceived failure to quell crimes against women in the aftermath of the revolution. Although, the march was stopped by the police before reaching secretariat premise, the agitators issued a 24-hour ultimatum to meet their demands.\nOn 13 March 2025, a torch march was organised at the Raju Sculpture to protest the death of an 8-year-old girl who died from injuries after being brutally gangraped by her 20-year-old brother-in-law and his father, while visiting the house of her elder sister six days prior at Sreepur upazila of Magura District. Thus incident sparked widespread public outrage in the country, with the house of the accused being burnt down by an angry mob. Bangladesh Ganatantrik Chhatra Sangsad general secretary Fahid Ahmed Chaudhury demanded resignation of the Home Advisor for this incident. The BNP has also criticised the inability of the interim government in quelling crimes against women, especially minors, in the country.\nImpacts\nGeopolitical\nThe ouster of Sheikh Hasina's regime marked a significant shift in Bangladesh's national politics. Democratic advocates have been reinvigorated, though they face ongoing instability. Geopolitically, both India and China had supported Hasina due to their security and economic interests, while the United States, despite strained relations, considered her government a strategic partner. With her removal, international observers are cautiously monitoring the potential emergence of a more democratic Bangladesh, propelled by the momentum of the movement. China may find opportunities to expand its influence amid the upheaval. However, China's potential gains are moderated by Bangladesh's political uncertainty, economic challenges, and the involvement of other international actors, such as the United States. Post-revolution, Pakistan and Bangladesh have taken steps to improve their bilateral relationship, with the Pakistani Foreign Office releasing a statement of solidarity and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hoping to \"settle outstanding issues\".\nFinancial\nOn 6 August, the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) saw a positive reaction from investors during its first opening following the resignation of Sheikh Hasina. The broad-based index of the DSE, known as DSEX, experienced its largest increase since 3 January. A total of twelve stocks reached their upper circuits, which permit a maximum daily price increase of 10%. This marked a significant improvement from the previous few weeks of student protests, during which most stocks were hitting their lower circuits, restricting the daily price fall to no more than 3%. The indices began with a substantial upward gap, which is considered the strongest opening in the last three to four years.\nProsecutions\nOn 13 August, a murder complaint was filed at a court in Dhaka against Sheikh Hasina and six other government officials, including former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan and former Transport and Bridges Minister and concurrent Awami League secretary-general Obaidul Quader, regarding the killing of a grocer during the protests on 19 July. That same day, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party also submitted a formal request to the United Nations requesting for it to conduct an international investigation into the killings during the protests. In a phone call with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on 14 August, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said that such an investigation would come \"very soon\".\nOn 14 August, a petition was filed by the father of a student killed during the protests at the International Crimes Tribunal calling for an investigation on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against Sheikh Hasina and nine other individuals, including Obaidul Quader and Asaduzzaman Khan over their role in the crackdown on the protests. The Awami League itself and its associated organisations were also named as accused in the petition, which was formally investigated on by the court later that day. The court began legal proceedings to have Sheikh Hasina extradited on 8 September. On 15 August, two additional murder charges were filed against Sheikh Hasina and several of her associates over the deaths of two people during the protests. On 16 August, another murder charge was filed against Sheikh Hasina, former education minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury and several others over the death of a college student during the protests in Chittagong on 18 July.\nOn 17 August, former shipping minister Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury was charged over an attack on a student protest on 18 July.\nOn 27 August, the interim government dissolved a committee created under Sheikh Hasina's government to investigate the deaths of students during the protests.\nThe Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal, Tajul Islam, said that he had received preliminary evidence of the presence of citizens of other countries in police uniforms during the protest.\nLegacy\n36 July\nOn 3 August, Nahid Islam said, \"We haven't gone to August yet. We will go to August only after this July killings are judged.\".\nSo young protesters used the non-standard date July 36 to commemorate 5 August, in memory of those who lost their lives during the quota reform movement in July 2024. The term \"July 36\" appeared in various graffiti and murals made by the students around the country. Al Jazeera also called 4 August as \"35 July\".\nReception\nThe movement has been dubbed as the world's first successful \"Gen Z revolution\" by several international media, as it was organized and led by Generation Z leaders.}} John Reed of the Financial Times called it the \"Monsoon Revolution\".

Traditionally, women in the country have been less involved in political demonstrations. Experts attribute this heightened involvement to the significant presence of young female university and high-school students. Notably, two prominent figures in the Students Against Discrimination, Nusrat Tabassum, serving as a coordinator, and Umama Fatema, acting as the organization's spokesperson were also women.\nPaintings and graffiti\n]]\nThe quota reform movement and its sequel the non-cooperation movement was a spontaneous movement in the history of Bangladesh.

In this movement, many painters from the country and abroad gave courage to the agitators by painting various paintings.\nHundreds of satirical cartoons and paintings were produced in just three weeks of the movement in July–August. Political cartoons and slogans encouraged the movement. Ahsan Habib, the legendary cartoonist of Bangladesh published a cartoon on 3 August 2024. It can be seen that an hourglass has been painted on red. Above the clock and then there is nominal sand to go down, it says 'count down'. In addition, Nazmus Sadat's cartoons of the hand pulling the barrel of the gun towards him; Asif Mahbub's drawing of the bloody phone; Risham Shahab Tirtha's drawing of the democracy by the security forces; and the Chhatra League's brutal forces or the student group's cartoons holding the soles of the police boots have clarified the situation with the message of the incident during the movement.\nMusic\nThe song \"Awaaz Utha\" released during the quota reform movement in Bangladesh. The song's composer, Hannan, was arrested by the police on 25 July from Narayanganj, a week after the release of the song. New York City-based non-profit organisation Artist at Risk Connection (ARC) condemned the arrest. The song became very popular with the audience around the quota reform movement. In just 13 days, it received over six million views on YouTube, making it the fifth most trending song on YouTube in Bangladesh at that time period.\nOther songs that became popular were \"Deshta Tomar Baper Naki\" and \"Dhana Dhanya Pushpa Bhara\", with the later one was notably chorused by the thousands of protesters on 3 August 2024.\nDocumentary\n''Amad's Dream'' (Bengali: আমাদ’স ড্রিম) is a 2025 short documentary by Bangladeshi filmmaker Aashish Kiphayet that explores the role of the Bangladeshi diaspora in the United States during the July Revolution.\nJuly Shaheed Smrity Foundation\nOn 20 August, the interim government announced the establishment of a foundation to be headed by Chief Advisor.

On the next day, the proposed holiday was declared as \"July Mass Uprising Day\" by the government officially and categorized as Category A holiday.\nOn 28 June 2025, for the holiday, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami announced plans to hold a mass procession in the capital and rallies and gatherings across the country.\nOn 2 July 2025, the government declared it a public holiday through an official gazette notification.
