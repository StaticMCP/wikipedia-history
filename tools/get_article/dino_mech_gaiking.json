In English, this roughly translates into \"Devilsaur\".}}}} is a Japanese Super Robot mecha anime series produced by Toei Animation. For distribution purposes, Toei refers to this television series as Dino Mech Gaiking.\nIt ran from April 1976 through January 1977 and consisted of 44 episodes of 25 minutes each. Gaiking was notable for being one of the few super robot series to take place in real places outside Japan, and for being the first Super Robot series to have a mobile carrier for the chief robots. In the US, Gaiking was part of Mattel's popular Shogun Warriors import toy line of the late 1970s and Jim Terry's Force Five anthology series. In 2005, a re-imagining titled Gaiking: Legend of Daiku-Maryu was produced.\nPlot\nThe story chronicled the battle between the crew of the semi-transformable carrier Daikū Maryū and the Super Robot Gaiking invented by Dr. Daimonji against an invading race of aliens called the Dark Horror Army. This army hails from the planet Zela whose home planet is facing destruction by their star, Sigma, turning into a black hole as their population starts to become extinct. Notable aspects of the series include the dinosaur-based designs of the Daikū Maryū and its support machines and the use of part of the carrier to form the main robot. The robot Gaiking was piloted by former baseball star named Sanshiro Tsuwabuki who was drafted for the job because his latent psychic powers made him the only one capable of doing so, all other similarly empowered candidates having been assassinated by alien agents with he himself having been injured in an attack that ended his sports career. Gaiking is most easily distinguished from other mecha by its skull-shaped golden torso formed from the head of the Daikū Maryū and its golden horns.\nThe leader of the Dark Horror Army was a robot scientist named Darius The Great and all of their ships and mecha were fish-shaped, which most likely inspired the Darius series of video games. He uses four giant robotic leaders called the Death Cross Generals composed of Dr. Dankel, General Asimov, General Killer, and General Desmont. These generals used bomber-like spaceships called Grotectors to create artificial black hole vortexes to travel to Earth and back. Throughout the series the Death Cross Generals and Darius note that natives of Zela originally came to Earth for research purposes before slowly colonizing the planet and using it to hide various dark monsters with the rise of humanity, as far back as one million years before the start of the series until the twelfth century AD. For their military natives of Zela were brainwashed and genetically altered into birdmen called the dark avians with elite individuals becoming dark knights.\nMecha\nGaiking\nA mecha defender robot consisting of three separate components: the Dino-Mecha's head, an arm unit, and a leg unit (the arm and leg units are stored inside the Dino-Mecha and exit from a gateway located below the Dragon's head). These three launch from the Dino-Mecha and combine, while in flight, to form Gaiking. Dino-Mecha's head forms Gaiking's core (i.e., chest and back) and contains Gaiking's own head. Gaiking is operated by baseball star Sanshiro Tsuwabuki.\nDaikū Maryū / Dino-Mech\nA gigantic dragon-shaped robot that defends Earth from invaders from the planet Zela.

The Jim Terry dub was released on video in the UK by Krypton Force under the name The Protectors, though the first volume of their Formators series actually contained Gaiking episodes instead of episodes from Jim Terry's Starvengers. Another dub was produced in the late-70s by M&M Productions in Hawaii, who also dubbed Mazinger Z for Toei as a potential test for a US release. Isao Sasaki did the English versions of opening and ending songs for this dub. Of this dub, only the eleventh episode survives.\nThe first 26 episodes of Gaiking were also aired in Italy during the Japanese super robot craze of the late 70s/early 80s, under the name Gaiking. In the late 1990s the whole series was released in Italy in dubbed DVD boxes. Two episodes from Jim Terry's Force Five Gaiking series would be redubbed as an episode of Robo Formers.\nDiscotek Media acquired the rights for the entire television series and released it in a complete box set, in Japanese with English subtitles, in June 2016. Reception for the release was mostly positive, but was noted for minor translation issues with the word Ankoku, most notably renaming the Dark Horror Army and Dark Monsters to Black Horror Army and Black Monsters, respectively.\nIn 2009, William Winckler Productions produced three all-new English dubbed film versions edited from the original series. William Winckler, known for Tekkaman the Space Knight, wrote, produced and directed the English films, which are seen on broadband in Japan and released on DVD in North America by Shout! Factory in 2013.\nLegal controversy\nToei Animation credited the show as being based on an original idea by Kunio Nakatani, Akio Sugino and Dan Kobayashi, but in reality the original idea was of Go Nagai. Toei deliberately took Nagai out of the credits in order to avoid the payment of royalties. Because of that, Nagai sued Toei and stopped further collaborations with Toei for a long time. The legal battle lasted more than 10 years. Nagai himself confirmed that he was the creator of Gaiking at Comicon 2007 in Naples, Italy.\nGame appearances\nThe original Gaiking first appeared in Shin Super Robot Wars for the PlayStation and later in 2nd Super Robot Wars Alpha and 3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha, both for the PlayStation 2.\nHollywood remake\nA live-action film based on the series, entitled Gaiking, was announced at the 2010 Tokyo Animation Fair and was to be helmed by American filmmakers Jules Urbach and Matthew Gratzner, who created the trailer for the film's public reveal. In 2012 Toei was teaming with The Walking Dead producer Valhalla Entertainment for the live-action adaptation of the show, but no further developments since then have been noted.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/lineup/tv/gaiking2/ Daikū Maryū Gaiking website on Toei Animation]\n* [http://www.encirobot.com/gaik/gaik-ind.asp Pictures and summaries of Daikū Maryū Gaiking chapters]\n*\n*\n* [http://www.terrediconfine.eu/gaiking-il-robot-guerriero-info.html Gaiking, il robot guerriero (Anime Mundi)], detailed production information\n* English trilogy: , ,\nzh:新宇宙飛龍"
