The album title comes from the honorific title Jackson himself acquired approximately 20 years earlier.\nThe track listing of the album differs significantly across countries because fans in each country where Sony BMG operated national offices were allowed to vote on which songs would appear on that country's edition of the album. The initial pool of songs, which also differed across countries, was selected from Jackson's back catalogue and also included a new \"megamix\" of five songs from the Thriller album that was created by Jason Nevins. \"Billie Jean\" is the only song to appear on all versions of the album.\nKing of Pop has been released in a total of 28 versions; it has not been released in North America. The album's launch was made public on June 20, 2008, with the official announcement of the Australian version. The first version was released was in the Netherlands and in Germany/Switzerland on August 22, 2008. The final release was China's edition on December 18, 2009, following Jackson's death.\nBackground\nPrior to the release of King of Pop, Jackson issued the double-disc album Thriller 25, a 25th anniversary edition of Thriller. It was a commercial success, having done particularly well as a re-issue, peaking at number one in eight countries and Europe. It reached number two in the US, number three in the UK and the top&nbsp;10 on over 30 national charts. In the US, Thriller&nbsp;25 was just 14,000 copies short of reaching the peak position, selling 166,000&nbsp;copies. It was ineligible for the Billboard&nbsp;200 chart as a re-release, but entered atop the Pop Catalog chart, where it stayed for 10 non-consecutive weeks and had the best sales on that chart since December 1996.\nA few months afterward, Sony announced the release of regional editions of the King of Pop compilation, in celebration of Jackson's 50th birthday. The album's title is a reference to the same title Jackson acquired approximately 20 years ago and was also co produced by Jamaican born student and songwriter Dontae Matthews, from Spanish Town, Jamaica. The name \"King of Pop\" came when actress and friend Elizabeth Taylor presented Jackson with an \"Artist of the Decade\" award at the 1989 Soul Train Awards, proclaiming him \"the true king of pop, rock and soul\". MTV, VH1, FOX, and Jackson's record label began marketing Jackson as the \"King of Pop\" to coincide with the release of Dangerous and the music video for \"Black or White\", the album's first single.\nVersions\nArgentina\nOn November 11, the Argentine version of the compilation was released. It contains 2 bonus tracks: the song \"Come Together\" (which is featured in Moonwalker and also the HIStory album, released in 1995) and a radio edit of the Megamix of the Thriller album. Two tracks on the album, \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\" were incorrectly named as \"Billy Jean\" and \"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\".\nAustralia\nThe Australian version was announced by Sony BMG Australia on June 20, 2008, and was released on Jackson's birthday. Starting on June 21, 2008, Australian fans had three weeks to vote for their 30 favourite tracks for the album; made up of Jackson's prior material. Each fan could choose five songs from the pool; made up of all the tracks from Off the Wall, Thriller (2001 special edition, including \"Carousel\"), Bad (2001 special edition), Dangerous, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, Invincible and the track \"For All Time\" from Thriller 25. The pool of songs also included seven from Jackson's time in The Jackson 5/The Jacksons. These songs were \"Blame It on the Boogie\", \"Can You Feel It\", \"ABC\", \"I Want You Back\", \"I'll Be There\" and \"Ben\". King of Pop was released in two editions: The first was a limited edition digipak that featured the names of selected voters, messages left by the fans and a fold-out poster that follows Jackson through his musical career; The second edition was a standard release of the album without the poster.|\nDisc 1\n#\"Billie Jean\"\n#\"Man in the Mirror\"\n#\"Smooth Criminal\"\n#\"Beat It\"\n#\"Thriller\"\n#\"They Don't Care About Us\"\n#\"Who Is It\"\n#\"Black or White\"\n#\"You Rock My World\"\n#\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin\n#\"The Way You Make Me Feel\"\n#\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\"\n#\"Dirty Diana\"\n#\"Blood on the Dance Floor\"\n#\"Rock with You\"\n#\"Stranger in Moscow\"\n#\"Remember the Time\"\nDisc 2\n#\"Will You Be There\"\n#\"Give In to Me\"\n#\"You Are Not Alone\"\n#\"Bad\"\n#\"Earth Song\"\n#\"Speechless\"\n#\"Human Nature\"\n#\"Heal the World\"\n#\"Dangerous\"\n#\"Blame It on the Boogie\"\n#\"Ghosts\"\n#\"Off the Wall\"\n#\"Butterflies\"\n#*Bonustracks\n#\"Say Say Say\"\n#\"Scream\"\n#\"Thriller Megamix\"\n}}\n|\nDisc 1\n#\"Billie Jean\"\n#\"Man in the Mirror\"\n#\"Smooth Criminal\"\n#\"Beat It\"\n#\"Thriller\"\n#\"They Don't Care About Us\"\n#\"Who Is It\"\n#\"Black or White\"\n#\"You Rock My World\"\n#\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin\n#\"The Way You Make Me Feel\"\n#\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\"\n#\"Dirty Diana\"\n#\"Blood on the Dance Floor\"\n#\"Rock with You\"\n#\"Stranger in Moscow\"\n#\"Remember the Time\"\nDisc 2\n#\"Will You Be There\"\n#\"Give In to Me\"\n#\"You Are Not Alone\"\n#*From The Closet:\n#\"Say Say Say\"\n#\"Scream\"\n#\"State of Shock\"\n#\"Got the Hots\"\n#\"You Can't Win\"\n#\"Fall Again\"\n#\"Sunset Driver\"\n#\"Someone Put Your Hand Out\"\n#\"In the Back\"\n#\"We Are the World (Demo)\"\n#\"One More Chance\"\n#\"Thriller Megamix\"\n}}\nAustria\nOn July 20, the Austrian version of the double disc compilation was announced; it was released on Jackson's birthday.

Sony BMG UK teamed up with GMTV and The Sun allowing fans, until August 10, to pick 18 tracks from the song pool. The pool list, at only 50 tracks, is the least diverse; there were no songs included from Jackson's group career.\nDespite the pool conducting a possible 18 tracks, only 17 are included. Most notable is the fact that \"Scream\" is included on the album, as this song had not appeared on any compilation album in the United Kingdom prior due to legal rights with Janet Jackson's label Virgin Records.\nStandard Edition\n]]\n| note7           = 7\" Edit\n| writer7         = Michael Jackson\n| extra7          = Thriller\n| length7         = 4:17\n| title8          = Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\n| note8           = 7\" Edit\n| writer8         = Michael Jackson\n| extra8          = Off the Wall\n| length8         = 3:59\n| title9          = The Way You Make Me Feel\n| writer9         = Michael Jackson\n| extra9          = Bad\n| length9         = 4:58\n| title10          = Rock with You\n| note10           = 7\" Single Mix\n| writer10         = Rod Temperton\n| extra10          = Off the Wall\n| length10         = 3:23\n| title11          = You Are Not Alone\n| note11           = LP Edit\n| writer11         = R.
