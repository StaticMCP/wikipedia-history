The battle of Bellavista began in the morning of January 14 with a Chilean advance on Ancud. In face of this and because of the fire by naval and land-based artillery, the Royalist troops retreated into the Fort of San Carlos. As the Chileans began to surround the Spanish positions, Quintanilla ordered a retreat to the heights of Bellavista where he hoped to put up some resistance. However, the demoralised Royalist troops were not in the mood to fight, so by late evening Quintanilla ordered a retreat south along the road to Castro. Agüi Fort on the Lacuy Peninsula surrendered on January 15.\nQuintanilla capitulated on January 18 after negotiating the conditions.\nThe Treaty of Tantauco was signed, and the Chiloé archipelago came under Chilean sovereignty.\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n*"
