He sneaks out in search of some new entertainment, and spots a sign for Betty Boop at the local vaudeville theatre. After some difficulties getting a pretzel from a vendor, the curtain comes up on Betty's Wild West show. Betty performs several tricks with her horse, entrancing the monarch. He joins Betty on stage for a song and dance number, just in time to be caught by the angry queen. The monarchs leave in the royal carriage, with Betty (hiding on the fender) holding the Little King's hand.\nProduction notes\nThe Little King had appeared in several cartoons produced by Van Beuren Studios (1933–34). In those cartoons, he was silent (as he had been in his comic strip). This short is the second film with the Little King speaking, with the first being \"Marching Along\" of the Van Buren Studios era.\nSee also\n* Betty Boop with Henry, the Funniest Living American\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* Betty Boop and the Little King at [https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/1534-Betty-Boop-And-The-Little-King the Big Cartoon Database].\n* Betty Boop and the Little King on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX9NxoFC8Hs YouTube]."
