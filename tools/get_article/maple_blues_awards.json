They are the only comprehensive national best in blues awards program.  The program's goal is to promote blues music across Canada, and to recognize outstanding achievement.  The Maple Blues Awards have been presented by the Toronto Blues Society since their inception in 1997.\nThe nominees are selected by a panel of blues experts. The panel includes radio hosts, journalists, and festival organizers regionally distributed across Canada. Members of the Nominating Panel are not eligible for any of the awards.\nNominees are voted for by the public. In 2011, the voting process was altered, and the Instrument categories (guitar, harmonica, piano/keyboards, horn, drums & bass) were voted on by the Nominating Panel.  The remainder of the categories were voted on by the public.\nThe winners of the Maple Blues Awards are announced at the Annual Maple Blues Awards Gala in Toronto, Ontario. The evening also includes musical performances by the Maple Blues Band, composed entirely of Maple Blues Awards winners and nominees.\nCurrent award categories\n* Entertainer of the Year\n* Electric Act of the Year\n* Acoustic Act of the Year\n* Male Vocalist of the Year\n* Female Vocalist of the Year\n* New Artist/Group of the Year\n* International Artist of the Year\n* Recording of the Year\n* Guitar Player of the Year\n* Harmonica Player of the Year\n* Piano/Keyboard Player of the Year\n* Horn Player of the Year\n* Drummer of the Year\n* Bassist of the Year\n* Songwriter of the Year\n* Blues Booster of the Year\n* Blues With A Feeling Award (Lifetime Achievement Award)\nWinners by year\nThe 1st Annual Maple Blues Awards (1997)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ The 1st Annual Maple Blues Awards\n|-\n!
