In particular, the NFDSS had put a candidate up against Derby's son in the 1917 Liverpool Abercromby by-election. Historian Niall Barr has stated that the movement was intended to \"form a buttress against Bolshevism\": its leader, Conservative Party MP Wilfrid Ashley was also secretary of the Anti-Socialist Union.\nClubs\nIn 1918, The Oxted branch in Surrey was established one of about 700 in 30 counties UK wide. An organisation created to inaugurate and maintain in a strong, stimulating, united and democratic comradeship all those who have served in any capacity in the Sea, Land, and Air Forces during the Great War, so that neither their efforts nor their interests shall be forgotten or neglected.\n*Comrades of the Great War Club, Coulsdon [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092213/http://www.coulsdoncomrades.co.uk/History.htm Club History - 27 June 1919]\n*Comrades [of the Great War] Club, Godmanchester [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929024049/http://comradesclub.com/history19201929.aspx History 1920 - 1929]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310211814/http://www.ballyclarecomrades.co.uk/5930.html Ballyclare Comrades Football Club]\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930071200/http://www.legion-memorabilia.org.uk/badges/comrades.htm British Legion Memorabilia Collectors Club - Comrades of the Great War Badges]\n*[http://www.britishlegion-northstaffs.org.uk/history/comrades_of_the_great_war.htm Badge Exhibition at the Royal British Legion in North Staffordshire's On-Line Museum]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311131359/http://beehive.thisiscornwall.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&ID=12361&PageID=74970 Badge]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060218175237/http://www.kellybadge.co.uk/images/S1G072.jpg Badge]\n*[http://www.britishlegion-northstaffs.org.uk/history/unity_badges.htm Unity Badges of the Founding Associations]\n*[http://www.bures-online.co.uk/comrades/comrades.htm History of the association in Bures, Suffolk]"
