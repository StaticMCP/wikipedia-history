Ludvík Svoboda replaced Antonín Novotný as the President of Czechoslovakia. It was the only time during Communist regime that the elected president didn't receive 100% of votes.\nBackground\nThe election was held as a result of Novotný's resignation during Prague Spring. Discussions about his successor started. The reformist wing of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia wanted an independent candidate and nominated Josef Charvát while others supported Ludvík Svoboda. Another suggested candidate was Čestmír Císař who was supported by students. It was eventually decided that Svoboda will be the only candidate in the election.\nVoting\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"|Candidate !!
