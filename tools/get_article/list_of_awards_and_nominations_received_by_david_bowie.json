Throughout his career, he won 73 awards from a total of 188 nominations.\nHe began his singing career under the name David Bowie in 1966 and won his first award in 1969, when he won an Ivor Novello Award for the song \"Space Oddity\". Bowie's first hit album was Hunky Dory in 1971 which reached number three in the UK Albums Chart. Despite his next eleven studio albums all making the UK Top 10—including four number one albums—he did not receive any more music awards or nominations until the early 1980s. He has since won numerous awards for his music, including: four BRIT Awards—Best British Male Solo Artist at the 1984 and 2014 BRIT Awards, an Outstanding Contribution Award at the 1996 BRIT Awards and an Icon Award at the 2016 Brit Awards which was awarded to him posthumously; six Grammy Awards including Best Video, Short Form for the David Bowie video at the 1985 Grammy Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2006 Grammy Awards; and four MTV Video Music Awards—Best Male Video for \"China Girl\" and a Video Vanguard Award at the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards, Best Overall Performance in a Video for \"Dancing in the Street\" at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards, and Best Art Direction for \"Blackstar\" at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.\nBowie began his acting career in the 1967 short film The Image. His first leading role was in the 1976 science fiction film The Man Who Fell to Earth, a role for which he won a Saturn Award for Best Actor at the 1976 Saturn Awards. He has also had an innovative presence on the Internet which led to his being awarded a lifetime achievement Webby Award in 2007 for \"pushing the boundaries of art and technology with his digital empire\".\nAMFT Awards\n!Ref.\n|-\n| rowspan=3|2016\n| David Bowie\n| Lifetime Achievement Award\n|\n| rowspan=3|\n|-\n| rowspan=2|\"Blackstar\"\n| Best Rock Song\n|\n|-\n| Best Rock Solo Performance\n|\nAmerican Music Awards\nThe American Music Awards are awarded for outstanding achievements in the music industry.

Bowie's face appears on the B£10 note.\nThe spider Heteropoda davidbowie is named in his honour and, following his death on 10 January, Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden announced that the first animal born in 2016 – a blue penguin chick – would be named Bowie after the late singer.\nOn 5 January 2015, a few days before his 68th birthday, a main-belt asteroid was named (342843) Davidbowie in his honour. On 13 January 2016, Belgian astronomers at MIRA Public Observatory in conjunction with radio station Studio Brussels registered a new asterism of seven stars in the vicinity of Mars at the date of Bowie's death that, when connected, form the lightning bolt seen on Bowie's face on the cover of his Aladdin Sane album.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
