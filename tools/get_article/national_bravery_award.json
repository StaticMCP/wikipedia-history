The awards are given by the  Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW). The award was instituted in 1957.\nICCW  Bravery Awards for Children and Youth\nThe ICCW Bravery Awards consist of eight categories\nOrigins\nOn Gandhi Jayanti day, 2 October 1957, India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was watching a performance in Delhi's Ramlila ground, at the Red Fort. During the performance, a short circuit caused a fire to break out in a shamiana (decorated tent).  Harish Chandra Mehra, a 14-year-old scout, promptly took out his knife and ripped open the burning tent, saving the lives of hundreds of trapped people. This incident inspired Nehru to ask the authorities to establish an award to honour brave children from all over the country. The first official National Bravery Awards were presented to two Children on 4 February 1958, by Prime Minister Nehru, and the ICCW ( Indian Council for Child Welfare) has continued the tradition ever since.\nSelection process\nEach year, the ICCW receives applications for the  Awards. The applications must be received by 15 October to be eligible for selection.\nAwardees are selected by a committee constituted by the ICCW.\nCeremony\nThe awards are usually announced and presented in January.\nList of awards\nBharat Award\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n|-\n!
