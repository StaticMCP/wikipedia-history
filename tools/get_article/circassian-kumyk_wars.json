These wars were characterized by power struggles for dominance in the North-Eastern Caucasus. The rivalry was fueled by shifting alliances with major regional powers such as Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Safavid Iran.\nBackground\nAccording to 19th-century sources, the Kabardians, a branch of the Adyghe (Circassians), migrated from the Black Sea into the North Caucasus plains along the Terek and Malka rivers. Upon arrival, they encountered Tatar settlements, which they displaced toward the steppe or confined to mountain gorges. These groups later came to be identified with the Balkar and related communities.\nThe Kumyks, led by the Shamkhals of Tarki, viewed themselves as the rightful rulers of the North Caucasus lowlands. This led to frequent clashes with Kabardian princes who had settled along the Terek River.\nRusso-Circassian alliance and Budai War\nHistory\nIn 1552–1553, Kabardian expansion triggered a conflict with the Shamkhalate of Tarki. During one of the battles, Muhammad Shamkhal, son of Shamkhal Amalu-Muhammad, was killed in combat against Kabardian forces.\nIn 1555, envoys from the Shamkhalate of Tarki and the Tyumen prince arrived in Moscow, pledging loyalty to Ivan the Terrible in exchange for protection from the Kabardians.\nIn 1556 diplomatic relations with the Moscow state were set. The peaceful embassy of shamkhal brought Ivan the Terrible a number of rich gifts, one of which was extraordinary: an elephant, not seen up to that time in Moscow. Shamkhal's envoy to Russia had no success as in 1557 prince Temruk Idar of Kabardia asked Ivan the Terrible to help him against the raids of shevkalski tsar (shamkhal), Crimean khan and the Turks. Ivan the Terrible sent his general Cheremisov who took over Tarki but decided not to remain there. This marked the beginning of Moscow's direct intervention in the Caucasian conflicts.\nAccording to V. V. Penskoy, Ivan IV's government aimed to demonstrate through military action that the Shahmhal should not confront the allies of Moscow, Prince Temryuk Idarovich and biy Ismail, or seek closer ties with the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate. This was especially important after the Russian conquest of Astrakhan, which made the Shamkhal's territories more accessible to Russian forces. A more general cause, according to E. N. Kusheva, was the political situation in the region: during the Ottoman–Safavid War of 1532–1555, the Tarkov Shahmhal had aligned with the Crimean-Turkish bloc. After the war, the Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate attempted to strengthen their influence over the North-East Caucasus through the Shahmhal, prompting a response from Moscow, which was in conflict with the Crimean-Turkish alliance.\nIn February 1560, Tsar Ivan IV decided to send the renowned military commander Ivan Semenovich Cheremisinov on a campaign to North Dagestan: \"The Tsar sent Ivan Semenovich Cheremisinov with his men to the Shavkal and Tyumen to address the Kabardian princes' grievances and the wrongdoings of Shavkal.\"\nV. V. Penskoy suggests that one reason Cheremisinov was chosen for this mission was his two-year tenure as the voivode of Astrakhan, which would have given him valuable knowledge of local politics and the ability to gather intelligence on the region.\nIn the summer of 1560, Cheremisinov's army sailed from Astrakhan to attack the Crimean Shavkal's territory. The Russian army traveled along the western coast of the Caspian Sea to Tarkov, the center of the Tarkov Shahmhal. The army included musketeers, Cossacks, and \"Astrakhan people.\" Upon landing near Tarkov, Cheremisinov led an attack on the city, which was captured in half a day. Cheremisinov chose not to hold Tarkov, but instead plundered and burned it, taking many captives.\nAccording to V. V. Penskoy, referencing a later account by historian S. A. Belokurov, Tarkov was not a large fortress like Kazan or Astrakhan, but rather a small town in a naturally fortified location. While it had stone walls that provided some defense against mountain raiders, it was no match for Cheremisinov's well-armed troops, who likely had firearms and possibly cannons.\n]]\nE. N. Kusheva suggested that by the mid-16th century, Tarkov was already the center of the Tarkov Shahmhal. During the battle, the Shahmhal, whose name is not recorded in the Russian chronicles, retreated into the mountains. According to epigraphic evidence, this leader may have been Budai I ibn Umal-Muhammad.\nBy 1560, tensions had escalated, leading to a Russian military expedition against the Shamkhalate of Tarki. A Russian force under Ivan Cheremisinov launched an attack, briefly capturing Tarki before retreating due to supply issues.\nA major battle in 1566 saw the forces of Temryuk Idarov clashing with a coalition led by Shamkhal Budai and Nogai allies. The battle resulted in the death of Shamkhal Budai and a temporary Kabardian occupation of Kumyk lands.\nCampaigns and Invasions Mid-17th century\nCampaigns of 1635\nIn 1635, Aidemir Shamkhal launched a devastating campaign against Kabardian settlements, killing Kabardian leader Klych Murza and devastating the region.\nKumyk Invasions and Kazanalp’s Reign (1646)\nFollowing Aidemir's death, Kazanalp ibn Sultan-Mahmud continued the campaigns. In 1646, Kazanalp attacked the estate of Kabardian prince Mutsal Cherkassky, killing villagers, seizing livestock, and taking captives.\nBattle of Malka (1641)\nBackground\nIn the early 17th century, Kabarda experienced intense internal strife, with rival princely families vying for dominance. The Idarovs, supported by Moscow, sought to consolidate power and secure the title of pchyshkhue (Great Prince) exclusively within their lineage. This triggered opposition from the Kazievs, aligned with the Crimean Khanate, Lesser Nogai Horde, and influential Kumyk leaders from the Shamkhalate of Tarki.\nBy 1641, tensions escalated following the assassination of Mudar Alkazov, a relative and ally of the Idarovs. Seeking revenge, Kelemet Kudenetov rallied a coalition consisting of Kabardian forces, Nogai detachments, Russian troops from the Terek fortress, and Kumyk allies. Meanwhile, the Kazievs, led by Aleguko Shogenukov, formed their own coalition with the Lesser Nogai Horde and other regional powers.\nBattle\nThe battle occurred near the Malka River, with the Idarov-led coalition positioned defensively. Their forces, numbering approximately 3,500, included:\n* Kabardian warriors from the Idarovs\n* Kumyk contingents from the Shamkhalate of Tarki\n* Nogai troops under the command of Saltanash Aksakov and Khoroshay Chubarmametov\n* A Russian detachment of 500 soldiers, including Streltsy, Greben Cossacks, and Terek-based garrison troops.\nDespite their numerical strength, the Idarov coalition suffered a devastating defeat. Key leaders such as Kelemet Kudenetov, Aidemir-Shamkhal, and Russian commander Artemy Shishmarev were killed in the battle. The Kaziev faction's forces, supported by the Lesser Nogai Horde, overwhelmed their opponents, securing a decisive victory.\nAftermath\nThe outcome of the Battle of the Malka significantly altered the political landscape in Kabarda. The Kaziev faction's victory reinforced their influence in the region and weakened the Moscow-backed Idarov faction. This shift played a crucial role in shaping Kabarda's internal politics and relations with neighboring powers, including the Crimean Khanate and Russia.\nCircassian-Kumyk wars in 18th century\n1712: Kumyk-Chechen Campaign Against Kabarda\nIn 1712, Kumyk and Chechen forces, led by Sultan-Mahmud of Endirey, attempted to bring Kabarda under the control of the Crimean Khanate. The campaign ultimately failed due to Kabardian resistance.\n1720s: Russian Influence Grows\nBy the 1720s, Peter I of Russia intensified his efforts to weaken the Kumyk rulers. A Russian-supported faction in Kabarda gradually gained dominance, reducing Kumyk influence.\n1745: Kumyk Mediation in Kabardian Feuds\nIn 1745, Kumyk rulers such as Alish Hamzin and Alibek Sultan-Mahmudov acted as mediators in internal Kabardian feuds, demonstrating their continued influence in regional politics.\nKumyks raids on Kabardia\n* 1552–1553: Muhammad-Shamhal, son of Shamkhal Amal-Muhammad, was killed in battle by the Kabardians.\n* 1566: Budai-shamkhal, the brother of the deceased Muhammad-Shamkhal, was also killed in battle by the Kabardians.\n* 1557: Kabarda swore allegiance to the Russian Empire after repeated appeals for protection from the Crimean Khanate, Nogais, and Kumyks.\n* 1588, 1589, 1591, 1604: Force of 5000 Russian musketeers and 10,000 Cherkesses captured and razed Andreyevo the in 1591, wounding the shamkhal. And kabardian princes participate in Russian campaigns (1588, 1589, 1604) against the Shamkhalate of Tarki.\n* 1605: The Kumyk forces inflicted a defeat on the Russian-Kabardian army, weakening Moscow's influence in the Caucasus.\n* 1635: Aidamir-shamkhal launched a punitive raid on Kabarda, killing Prince Klych Sauslanov and capturing many prisoners.\n* 1641: Aidamir-shamkhal again attacked Kabarda but was defeated in a battle on the Malki River and was killed, along with many of his warriors and allies.\n* 1646: Kazanalp-murza, the son of Sultan-Mahmud, carried out a raid on the lands of Kabardian prince Mutsal Cherkassky, ravaging villages and capturing prisoners.\n* 1643: Kazanalp Endireevsky raid on Kabardia, Kabardians lost.\n* 1646: Kazanalp-murza devastated the lands of Mutsal Cherkassky, a loyal vassal of the Russian Tsar, taking away people, horses, and cattle.\n* 1700s: The Shamkhalate of Tarki lost control over Kabarda. However, many Kumyk villages remained in the region, including Endirey (now Terskoye), Chereksk, Kyzyl-Yar, and Bekish-Yurt.\nAftermath\nBy the mid-18th century, Russian control over the region solidified. While Kumyk rulers maintained local power, they were increasingly subordinated to Russian interests.\nSee also\n* Kabardia\n* Shamkhalate of Tarki\n* North Caucasus\n* Caucasus War\nReferences"
