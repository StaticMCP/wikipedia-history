The Talpurs, led by Mir Fateh Ali Khan Talpur, won the battle over Mian Abdul Nabi Kalhoro of the Kalhora dynasty, and established the Talpur dynasty.\nBackground\nIn spite of the written covenants on the holy scripture, Mian Abdul Nabi Kalhora got the two Talpur chiefs, Mir Abdullah Khan and Mir Fateh Khan, murdered in cold blood. This incident occurred in the year AH 1196/1782-83 CE. Some sources reveal that the Talpur chiefs were murdered while reciting the Quran, and this brought about general indignation and discontentment among the Baloch tribes of Sindh. Mir Fateh Ali son of Mir Sobdar and the grandson of Mir Bahram Khan, became the next leader of the Talpur confederacy and declared that he would punish Abdul Nabi Kalhora.\nThe Talpur confederacy, which was headed by Mir Fateh Ali, was aided by Mir Sohrab (of Khairpur) and Mir Tharo Manikani.  The Baloch tribes were however divided in their affiliation. The Leghari, Nizamani, Marri, Khatiyan, Khokhar and the Khaskheli tribes threw their lot with the Talpurs, whilst the Khosaa, Jatois, Numerias, Junejas, Lekheys, Kaleris, and the Khuhawars sided with the Kalhoras.\nBattle\nThe Kalhora dynasty of Nawabs were supported by the Durrani Empire. While the Talpurs traced their roots back to Nader Shah had Qajar and possibly slight nominal support from the Mughal Empire.\nAt the Battle of Halani both sides ferociously deployed the usage of gunpowder weaponry. The battle was described by a future chronicler with one word Atishfishan (meaning \"blazing flame\"), this battle was even fought between gunboats in the Indus River.\nThe Talpurs emerged victorious, marking the end of Kalhora rule.\nAftermath\nThe Talpur dynasty ruled in Sindh until defeated by the British forces at the Battle of Miani in 1843. 2 of 3 Talpur kingdoms were defeated but Khairpur survived by allying with the British. This battle was Later known as the \"Murder of Kalhora's\" By the Ameers and several British historians\nReferences\n*\n*"
