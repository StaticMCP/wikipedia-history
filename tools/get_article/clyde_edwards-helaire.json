Edwards-Helaire and teammate Jared Small met 18-year old Kobe Johnson in an arranged electronics sale.  When the meeting took place, Johnson pulled a gun and tried to rob them, at which point one of the players pulled their own gun and fatally shot him.  Authorities did not reveal which player fired the fatal shots. As a result of the shooting, Edwards-Helaire suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and has been open about his struggles and how it has occasionally caused him to miss practice or other things in his life.
