Despite its numerical superiority, the Egyptian fleet, probably commanded by Sophron of Ephesus, lost to a Macedonian fleet led by Antigonus II Gonatas. The Egyptian captain Ptolemy Andromachou, an illegitimate half-brother of the Pharaoh, lost his ship and crew, barely escaping to Ephesus.\nThe date of the battle is uncertain, but generally the year 246/245 BC is accepted. Following the battle, the Egyptian king Ptolemy III Euergetes lost the dominion of the Nesiotic League to Antigonus Gonatas.\nSee also\n*Ptolemaic Egypt\n*Seleucid Empire\n*Syrian Wars\nReferences"
