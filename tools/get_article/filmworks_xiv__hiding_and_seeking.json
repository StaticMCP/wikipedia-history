The album was released on Zorn's own label, Tzadik Records, in 2003 and contains music that Zorn wrote and recorded for, Hiding and Seeking (2003), a documentary directed by Menachem Daum and Oren Rudavsky.\nReception\nThe Allmusic review by Thom Jurek awarded the album 4½ stars noting that \"Zorn's score is one of his most beautiful and accessible... This work is beyond folk forms, beyond jazz, and beyond the kitschy sense of humor Zorn often employs (even more so than The Gift), resulting in a work that is profound, moving, and full of sensual delight\".\n}}\nTrack listing\n# \"Merkabah\" (vocal)                         -                   6:23\n# \"Sekhel\"                                   -                   4:38\n# \"Zhakor\" (vocal)                           -                   3:43\n# \"Muflah\"                                   -                   5:19\n# \"Abulafia\"                                 -                   2:27\n# \"Abulafia\" (vocal)                         -                   3:39\n# \"Chirik\"                                   -                   4:26\n# \"Moadim\"                                   -                   3:26\n# \"Zhakor\"                                   -                   4:24\n# \"Sekhel\" (vocal)                          -                   4:59\n# \"Adamah\"                                  -                   4:27\n# \"Merkabah\"                                -                   5:31\n:All music by John Zorn\n*Recorded at Frank Booth, Brooklyn (New York) in April 2003.\n*Produced by John Zorn.\nPersonnel\n*Marc Ribot – guitar\n*Kenny Wollesen – vibraphone\n*Trevor Dunn – bass\n*Cyro Baptista – percussion\n*Ganda Suthivarakom (1, 3, 6, 10): vocals.\nReferences"
