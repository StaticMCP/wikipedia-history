It is situated opposite the Porthmadog National Rail station. The station opened on 2 August 1980 and was originally a simple wooden shed situated in the car park. In January 1986 a portable building was installed at the end of the platforms for use as a waiting room and café.\nIn 1990 a permanent station building was built between the café and the buffer stops. Initially it replaced the wooden shed and was subsequently extended to the east in 1993 to double the size of the shop.\nThe old café was demolished in 1998 and the station building was extended over its site. The station building was built by volunteers and is a single-storey building with a pitched roof and canopy.\nDuring the 1998 Civil's week the 50&nbsp;lb run round point was replaced with a 75&nbsp;lb full lead allowing a short siding to be constructed adjacent to the headshunt. This siding is now used to store various historic wagons, considerably enhancing the period feel of the station. The run round loop was relaid in 75&nbsp;lb rail the same week.\nSee also\n*Porthmadog Network Rail station\n*Porthmadog Harbour (FR) station\nExternal links\n*[http://www.webcam.whr.co.uk/Porthmadog Porthmadog Station webcam]\n|header2=\n|note-row2=Interchange with  on the Cambrian Line\n}}"
