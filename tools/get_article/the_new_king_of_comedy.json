It was released in China on 5 February 2019 during the Lunar New Year 2019.

Actress E Jingwen also worked as an extra prior to The New King of Comedy, similar to the character she played in the film.\nChow recruited the Chinese girl group Ji Feng Shao Nu (), whose members were eliminated in the Chinese version of Produce 101, to sing the film's theme song.\nRelease\nThe New King of Comedy was released in China on 5 February 2019.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
