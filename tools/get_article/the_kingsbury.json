It was built by U. N. Gunasekera, and is owned by Hotel Services (Ceylon) PLC, which is a subsidiary of Hayleys PLC. It was refurbished and reopened in January 2013.\nHistory\nUnlike the 1960s resort architecture, Ceylon InterContinental was an example of high rise engineering. A bomb exploded in nearby Central Bank of Sri Lanka building on 30 January 1996, killing at least 90 people. The hotel was damaged in the bombings.\nIt was one of the sites targeted during the 2019 Sri Lanka bombings that occurred on Easter Sunday.\nSee also\n* Amaya Resorts & Spas, a hotel brand owned by Hayleys Group\nReferences\n}}"
