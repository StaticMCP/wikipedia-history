Dated 3.465 Ga, these microstructures, found in Archean chert, are considered to be the oldest known geological record of life on Earth.\nDescription\nThe fossils in this group were discovered by Arthur Hugh Hickman in 1983 in Warrawoona, , a region on the Pilbara craton in the northern part of Pilbara province.\nWhether or not the fossils were authentic was disputed in the past, as abiotic processes could not be ruled out. Currently the fossils are thought to be of biological origin, however there is no conclusive evidence of fossilized organisms in the formation, and whether the lines in the rock are fossilized stromatolites.\nThe rocks also include felsic volcanic rocks.\nSee also\n* North Pole, WA for similar issues\n* Origin of life\n* Timetable of the Precambrian\n* Geology of Australia\n* Fig Tree Formation\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gsa.org.au/ Geological Society of Australia]"
