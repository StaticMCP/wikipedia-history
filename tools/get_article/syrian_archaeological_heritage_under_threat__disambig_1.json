The spokesman for the group is Spanish archaeologist Rodrigo Martin, who remarked about the damage being done during the conflict \"If this continues, the situation will be like in Iraq, it could mean that a heritage that is of great importance for the whole world destroyed.\"\nThe group is not entirely based in Syria, coordinating with colleagues and other sources inside to post photographs and reports. The Facebook page compiles a list of heritage sites damaged during the Syrian Civil War and the aim of the group is to make the world pay greater attention to the heritage catastrophe likely to occur in the area and disseminate information about it.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.facebook.com/Archeologie.syrienne?ref=ts Le patrimoine archéologique syrien en danger Facebook page]\n*}} ([https://archive.org/details/SyrianArchaeologicalHeritageUnderThreat Archived] and Internet Archive)"
