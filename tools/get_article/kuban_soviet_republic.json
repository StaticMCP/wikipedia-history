Its capital was Yekaterinodar.\nIt was merged into the Kuban-Black Sea Soviet Republic on May 30, 1918, less than 2 months after it was formed.\nBackground\nIn February 1918, the First Congress of Soviets of the Kuban Region was held in  Armavir. One of the first actions undertaken by the Congress was the election of a regional council, which designated the  Soviets as the sole legitimate authority of the Kuban People's Republic and banned the Kuban Rada.\nAt the end of March, Bolshevik forces had managed to occupy the Kuban capital of Yekaterinodar, which led to the formation of the Yekaterinodar Committee of the Bolsheviks and subsequently the 1st and 2nd Yekaterinodar Communist Regiments.\nCreation\nThe Second Congress of Soviets of the Kuban Region was held in Yekaterinodar from April 1 to April 16, and was attended by 832 delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!

That same day, many in attendance spoke in favor of uniting with the nearby Black Sea Soviet Republic.\nSoon after the creation of the Kuban SR, the Council of People's Commissars was formed, which consisted of sixteen members. Yan Vasilyevich Poluyan was elected as Chairman and Vladimir Cherny was elected as Secretary.\nThe Kuban-Black Sea Military Revolutionary Committee, a joint command structure between the Kuban and Black Sea SRs, was formed soon after the creation of the Kuban SR.\nFormation of the Kuban-Black Sea Soviet Republic\nThe Third Extraordinary United Congress of Soviets of the Kuban and Black Sea Soviet Republics was held in Yekaterinodar from May 28 to May 30, and was attended by 882 delegates.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!
