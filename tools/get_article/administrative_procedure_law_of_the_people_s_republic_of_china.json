The law is often referred to in English as the Administrative Litigation Law''' (ALL), which is a closer translation of the Chinese, but which is not the official English translation used by the PRC government. This law is often invoked in housing disputes.\nIn 2015, the Administrative Law was revised. The revisions expanded the people's rights to sue the government.\nThe Administrative Procedure Law is thought to be an important achievement in enforcing the Chinese Constitution and its socialist legal system. Also according to economist Keyu Jin, the revisions to the Administrative Procedure Law codified in 2021 marked a new milestone in improving the rule of law in China.\nReferences"
