It is near Swinton, about  south-west of Masham. The village is not far from the River Ure, which eventually runs through the small city of Ripon, which itself is a few miles south-east of Warthermarske.\nThe village is at the southern corner of the Swinton Park Estate and was formerly included with the village of Swinton as one township.\nThe hamlet used to be known as Wardenmask and its name derives from Old English with a Scandinavian influence; Wardonmersk which means Marsh at a Watch-Hill.\nFrom 1974 to 2023 it was part of the Borough of Harrogate, it is now administered by the unitary North Yorkshire Council.\nReferences\nExternal links"
