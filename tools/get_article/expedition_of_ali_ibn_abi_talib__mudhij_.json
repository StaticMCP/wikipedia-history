Ali was instructed by Muhammad to not engage them in fighting: \"go and do not look back, if you reach their place, do not fight them unless they attack you\". Ali sent out his men, they obtained spoils of war, women, children, camels and flock. Once he met with the people, he invited them to Islam. They rejected him and launched an attack with arrows and rocks. Ali and his men then charged back at them and killed 20 of their men, so they fled. Ali held back the army from pursuing the fleeing enemy and invited them once more to Islam. They quickly responded and pledged allegiance to him. The tribe did this quickly and submitted themselves to Muʿādh ibn Jabal, Muhammad's envoy in Yemen.\nSee also\n*Military career of Muhammad\n*List of expeditions of Muhammad\nReferences"
