The park was established on 19 May 2016 to protect a portion of the North American inland temperate rainforest, the only inland temperate rainforest in the world.\nDescription\nThe park is located just off BC Highway 16 about  east of Prince George. The park is about  southwest of Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park and Protected Area and directly borders Slim Creek Provincial Park. The park contains a number of trees estimated to be over 1000 years old.\nHistory\nThe park is located within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T'enneh Nation who have inhabited the area since time immemorial.\nIn 2018, the provincial government and Lheidli T'enneh Nation signed a memorandum of understanding to work together on the planning and management of the park.\nOn 6 July 2020, the Lheidli T'enneh Nation announced that both the provincial and federal government are contributing funds toward an $8.7 million development project to improve park facilities and build an interpretative centre sharing Lheidli T'enneh culture with visitors.\nSee also\n*List of provincial parks of Fraser-Fort George Regional District\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.ancientforestalliance.org/photos/ancient-forest-chun-toh-whudujut-provincial-park/ AFA gallery showcasing the recently opened Ancient Forest/Chun T'oh Whudujut Provincial Park, 2017]"
