      "text": "# Seeking Refuge\n\n}}\nSeeking Refuge is the third studio album by Excel. It was released in 1995. Some of the material on this album dates back to 1991 when Excel began writing ''The Joke's on Yous follow-up. Due to lineup changes and band members being involved in their own activities at the time, Seeking Refuge was set aside for a number of years before finally being completed in 1995. With this album, Excel once again presented a change in musical style, beginning to merge the thrash metal of The Joke's on You'' with funk music.\nThe only single off this album was \"Unenslaved\". Like other Excel albums, the album was out of print for a number of reasons; it was then announced in 2024 for a re-release.\nTrack listing\n# \"Unenslaved\"\n# \"Hair Like Christ\"\n# \"Plastic Cracks\"\n# \"Take Your Part Gotta Encourage\"\n# \"Drowned Out\"\n# \"United Naturally in True Youth\"\n# \"Riptide\"\n# \"Overview\"\n# \"Downpressor\"\nPersonnel\n* Dan Clements - vocals\n* Brandon Rudley - guitar\n* Shaun Ross - bass\n* Max - drums\nReferences"
