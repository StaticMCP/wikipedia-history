Later it was a neighbor to the Pala Empire to the north. Rulers of Chandra kingdom were adherents of Buddhism. The Kings of Chandra dynasty were identified as the kings of Vangaladesha in the Tirumulai inscription of Chola dynasty. The dynasty was founded around the 4th century AD.\nHistory\nThe Anandachandra Inscription (729 AD) mentions that the Chandra dynasty was established by Dvenchandra (or Mahataing Chandra) in 370 AD. He had assumed the throne after the end of the Annaveta dynasty. The ye Dhamma inscriptions of the Queen of Niti Chandra are dated to early 6th century AD based on paleographic grounds.\nThe Chandra kingdom was one of the last Buddhist strongholds in the Indian subcontinent. The kingdom flourished as a center of the Tantric schools of Buddhism. It played a role in the diffusion of Mahayana Buddhism to Southeast Asia.\nDuring the reign of Srichandra  (c 930–975 AD), the administrative centre of the Chandra kingdom was established in Bikrampur in Vanga. He led invasions into Kamarupa. The Chandras played an important role in the regional politics and military history of erstwhile Bengal.\nIn the reign of King Govindachandra, the Chandras were eventually overthrown during an invasion by the Chola dynasty of South India.\nMaritime relations\nThe coastal kingdom had trade networks with states in what is now Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. 10th century shipwrecks around the coast of Java provide evidence of maritime links between southeastern Bengal and Southeast Asia. Bronze sculptures may have been imported by the Javanese from the Chandra kingdom in southeastern Bengal. Arab merchants also traded with the kingdom.\nKing Anandachandra mentions mission he sent to Sinhalese King Silamegha (Aggabodhi IV) (727–766)\nMarital relations\nAccording to king Anandachandra's (22th King of this dynasty) inscription, the Chandra dynasty of Arakan had marital relations with the Tamralipta royal family (Tamluk Royal Family). King Anandachandra of Arakan was married to Princess Dhenda of Tamralipta.\nArchaeology\nThere are numerous inscriptions dating from the period of the Chandra dynasty. The three archaeological sites associated with the dynasty include Bikrampur and Mainamati in Bangladesh and Waithali in Rakhine State, Myanmar.\nEducation\nChandrapur University in Shrihatta was as large as other religious institutions like Nalanda, Taxila, Mahasthangarh or Odantapuri and was established before Oxford, and Cambridge universities or even the Jagaddala Vihara. It was made by king Srichandra. Its exact location has not been found. Chandrapur university was unique in contrast with other universities and the viharas established by Buddhist kings in India. Its curriculum included almost all of the subjects from the Hindu Shastra except the grammar of Chandragomin who was Buddhist by religion. Moreover, the students of this university were also Hindu Brahmins. The nine monasteries were overseen mainly by Hindu Brahmins. This is because the Buddhist king, Srichandra, granted lands in Paschimbhag in the name of Buddha for nine Brahmin monasteries where the Chaturvedas were mainly taught. Kamalakanta Gupta referred to this grant as \"unique among other Buddhist kings\" since it implies Srichandra's favouritism towards Brahmins.\nLand distribution among 25 classes of people, guests, and students indicates an efficient administration in the universities. According to Zafir Setu, this administrative arrangement is more consistent with the present-day university system.\nList of Chandra rulers\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!#\n!King\n!Period\n!Reign (CE)\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" | Ruling from Dhanyawadi and Waithali\n|-\n|1\n|Dvenchandra\n|55\n|370–425\n|-\n|2\n|Rajachandra\n|20\n|425–445\n|-\n|3\n|Kalachandra\n|9\n|445–454\n|-\n|4\n|Devachandra\n|22\n|454-476\n|-\n|5\n|Yajnachandra\n|7\n|476-483\n|-\n|6\n|Chandrabandu\n|6\n|483-489\n|-\n|7\n|Bhumichandra\n|7\n|489–496\n|-\n|8\n|Bhutichandra\n|24\n|496–520\n|-\n|9\n|Nitichandra\n|55\n|520–575\n|-\n|7\n|Virachandra\n|3\n|575–578\n|-\n|11\n|Pritichandra\n|12\n|578-90\n|-\n|12\n|Prithvichandra\n|7\n|590–597\n|-\n|13\n|Dhirtichandra\n|3\n|597–600\n|-\n|14\n|Mahavira*\n|12\n|600-12\n|-\n|15\n|Virayajap*\n|12\n|612-24\n|-\n|16\n|Sevinren*\n|12\n|624-36\n|-\n|17\n|Dharmasura*\n|13\n|636-49\n|-\n|18\n|Vajrashakti*\n|16\n|649-65\n|-\n|19\n|Dharmavijaya*\n|36\n|665–701\n|-\n|20\n|Narendravijaya*\n|2 yr 9 months\n|701–703\n|-\n|21\n|Dharmachandra*\n|16\n|703–720\n|-\n|22\n|Anandachandra*\n|9+\n|720-729+\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Ruling from Harikela\n|-\n|1\n|Traillokyachandra\n|30\n|900–930\n|-\n|2\n|Srichandra\n|45\n|930–975\n|-\n|3\n|Kalyanachandra\n|25\n|975–1000\n|-\n|4\n|Ladahachandra\n|20\n|1000–1020\n|-\n|5\n|Govindachandra\n|30\n|1020–1050\n|}\n*Note- These rulers may or may not be related to the Chandra dynasty.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
