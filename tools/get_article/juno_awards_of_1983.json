Interest in the telecast was growing substantially, with 3.2 million viewers in 1982, and 4.4 million for this year's edition.\nDuring their opening co-hosts Cummings and Thicke introduced the Compact Disc to the viewing audience, likely the first introduction to the new media for many people.  Columbia Records had just released their first ever batch of titles on CD about one month before the broadcast.  As Cummings recalled: \"Alan held up Toto IV, and it was also the first time I held one in my hand.  I don't think Alan had seen one before that night... It felt like 'show and tell' and it was pretty cool for that to happen on national TV.\"\nPayola$ were the top band this year with three awards including \"Most Promising Group\" and \"Best Selling Single\" for \"Eyes of a Stranger\".  Bob Rock was absent (ironically he was mixing Loverboy's next album) and so band-mate Paul Hyde accepted their awards.  For the \"Most Promising Group\" award he remarked \"Somebody told us that to get this award is the kiss-off.  Nobody's going to kiss us off.\"\nLoverboy continued their winning streak by taking both the \"Group of the Year\" and \"Album of the Year\" awards for the second year in a row, this time for their sophomore effort Get Lucky.  Other repeat winners for the same awards from the 1982 Juno's included Liona Boyd, Anne Murray and The Good Brothers.\nBritish-Canadian musician Bryan Adams won his first ever Juno award but was unable to accept it in person as he was touring in the U.S., so his manager Bruce Allen accepted it on his behalf.\nThe \"Canadian Music Hall of Fame\" award was posthumously given to Glenn Gould who had died the previous year.  Gould's award was presented by then Governor General Edward Schreyer and accepted by Gould's former manager John Roberts. Gould was also nominated twice in the same category for \"Best Classical Album\" and won this award for his 1981 re-recording of Bach: The Goldberg Variations.\nNominees and winners\nSimilar to the 1981 Juno's, the category for \"Best Comedy Album\" was not awarded this year.\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Carole Pope\nOther nominees:\n* Jessie Burns\n* Joni Mitchell\n* Anne Murray\n* Shari Ulrich\nMale Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Bryan Adams\nOther nominees:\n* Burton Cummings\n* Gordon Lightfoot\n* Murray McLauchlan\n* Aldo Nova\nMost Promising Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Lydia Taylor\nOther nominees:\n* Lee Aaron\n* Terry Crawford\n* Luba\n* Mary Lu Zahalan\nMost Promising Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Kim Mitchell\nOther nominees:\n* Lawrence Gowan\n* David Roberts\n* Leroy Sibbles\n* David Wilcox\nGroup of the Year\nWinner: Loverboy\nOther nominees:\n* April Wine\n* Chilliwack\n* Rush\n* Saga\nMost Promising Group of the Year\nWinner: Payola$\nOther nominees:\n* Doug and the Slugs\n* Headpins\n* The Spoons\n* Strange Advance\nComposer of the Year\nWinner: Bob Rock and Paul Hyde, \"Eyes of a Stranger\" by the Payolas\nOther nominees:\n* Robert Buckley and David Sinclair, \"Letting Go\" by Straight Lines\n* Paul Dean and Mike Reno, \"Working for the Weekend\" by Loverboy\n* Geoff Iwamoto and Michael Roth, \"Your Daddy Don't Know\" by Toronto\n* Neil Peart, \"New World Man\" by Rush\nCountry Female Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Anne Murray\nOther nominees:\n* Carroll Baker\n* Marie Bottrell\n* Cathy Chambers\n* Laura Vinson\nCountry Male Vocalist of the Year\nWinner: Eddie Eastman\nOther nominees:\n* Harold MacIntyre\n* Lee Marlow\n* Paul Weber\n* Diamond Joe White\nCountry Group or Duo of the Year\nWinner: The Good Brothers\nOther nominees:\n* Family Brown\n* Garry Lee and Showdown\n* Midnite Rodeo Band\n* The Rovers\nInstrumental Artist of the Year\nWinner: Liona Boyd\nOther nominees:\n* All-Star Swing Band\n* The Emeralds\n* Frank Mills\n* The Spitfire Band\nProducer of the Year\nWinner: Bill Henderson and Brian MacLeod, \"Whatcha Gonna Do\" and \"Secret Information\" by Chilliwack\nOther nominees:\n* Terry Brown, \"Subdivisions\" & \"Chemistry\" by Rush\n* Bruce Fairbairn, \"Worlds Away\" & \"She Controls Me\" by Strange Advance\n* Claire Lawrence, \"You're Makin Me Nervous\" & \"The One and Only\" by Shari Ulrich\n* Peter Mann, \"That Kind of Man\" & \"Prince of Darkness\" by The Nylons\nRecording Engineer of the Year\nWinner: Bob Rock, No Stranger to Danger by the Payola$\nOther nominees:\n* Gary Gray, Shaking the Foundations by Rough Trade\n* Lindsay Kidd / Bob Rock, Worlds Away by Strange Advance\n* Dave Slagter, Opus X by Chilliwack\n* Paul Northfield, Power Play by April Wine\nCanadian Music Hall of Fame\nWinner: Glenn Gould (posthumous)\nNominated and winning albums\nAlbum of the Year\nWinner: Get Lucky, Loverboy\nOther nominees:\n* Aldo Nova, Aldo Nova\n* Christmas Wishes, Anne Murray\n* Signals, Rush\n* Turn it Loud, Headpins\nBest Album Graphics\nWinner: Dean Motter, Metal on Metal by Anvil\nOther nominees:\n* Tom Powell, Streetheart by Streetheart\n* Hugh Syme, One False Move by Harlequin\n* Hugh Syme, Signals by Rush\n* Scott Thornley, Rise and Shine by Raffi\nBest Children's Album\nWinner: When You Dream a Dream, Bob Schneider\nOther nominees:\n* Jim and Rosalie...
