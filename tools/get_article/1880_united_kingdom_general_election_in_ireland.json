Parnell was presumed to have had the support of 25 of the MPs. When the Parliamentary Party reassembled in Westminster, Parnell was elected session chairman of the party in place of William Shaw.\nThe IPP would not drop below the number of seats won in the 1880 election again until the 1918 general election, when it experienced an electoral wipeout at the hands of Sinn Féin.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px\" colspan=2 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats change\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| % Change\n|-\n|\n| align=center| 63\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 95,535\n| align=center| 37.5\n| align=center| 2.1\n|-\n|\n| align=\"center\" | 25\n| align=\"center\" | 8\n| align=\"center\" | 99,607\n| align=\"center\" | 39.8\n| align=\"center\" | 1.0\n|-\n|\n| align=center| 15\n| align=center| 5\n| align=center| 56,252\n| align=center| 22.7\n| align=center| 4.3\n|-  style=\"font-weight:bold; background:rgb(232,232,232);\"\n! colspan=2 style=text-align:right | Total\n| align=center| 103\n|\n| align=center| 251,394\n| align=center| 100.0\n| align=center|\n|}\n|39.62}}\n|38.00}}\n|22.38}}\n}}\n|61.17}}\n|24.27}}\n|14.56}}\n}}\nSee also\n* History of Ireland (1801–1923)\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
