After the war, they joined the Sheffield Association League for two years while again playing in the FA Cup, but it is not known what happened to the club between 1952 and 1976.\nIn 1976 they entered the Yorkshire League&nbsp;– a year later they first entered the FA Vase. In 1982 they joined the newly formed Northern Counties East League, but their spell in this competition was troubled, and in 1991 they resigned from the league and disbanded after finishing bottom of the basement division for the second successive season.\nLeague and cup history\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:75%\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Pilkington Recreation League and Cup history\n|-\n!
