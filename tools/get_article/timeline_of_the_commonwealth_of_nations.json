Event\n|-\n| 1942\n| 9 October\n| Australia passes the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, adopting the Statute of Westminster 1931, but back-dating it to 3 September 1939, when the United Kingdom (and therefore Australia) declared war upon Nazi Germany.\n|-\n| 1944\n| 1 May\n| The first Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference convenes in London.\n|-\n| rowspan=3| 1945\n| 4 April\n| A Commonwealth Statesmen's Meeting convenes in London to co-ordinate members' demands and expectations of the impending end of the war.\n|-\n| 8 May\n| Nazi Germany surrenders to the Allied Powers, ending the Second World War in Europe.\n|-\n| 15 August\n| The Empire of Japan surrenders to the Allied Powers, ending the Second World War.\n|-\n| rowspan=2| 1946\n| 21 February\n| The British Commonwealth Occupation Force is formed from Australian, British, Indian, and New Zealand occupation forces in Japan.\n|-\n| 23 April\n| The second Commonwealth Prime Ministers Conference convenes in London.\n|-\n| rowspan=4| 1947\n| 3 February\n| In response to Canada's passage the previous year of the Canadian Citizenship Act the previous year, a Commonwealth conference on nationality and citizenship is convened. It is agreed to redefine the concept of citizenship in the Commonwealth so that, rather than all those in the British Empire and Commonwealth being British subjects, each Commonwealth state is free to also define its own separate citizenship. As a result, the British Nationality Act 1948 is passed the next year by the British parliament which creates a distinction in that country between British citizens and British subjects; Australia and New Zealand also pass their own citizenship acts. Eventually, the category of British subject develops into that of a Commonwealth citizen whose rights are greater than those of a foreign national but often less than one of a full citizen of the country in question. Ireland had already passed citizenship legislation in 1935 defining its own citizenship laws.\n|-\n| 15 August\n| India joins the Commonwealth upon being granted independence by the United Kingdom.

They took this view on the basis that the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 had come into effect. The legislation ended the statutory role of the British monarchy in Ireland. In contrast, Irish leaders had long regarded Ireland as a republic outside the Commonwealth but associated with it.\n|-\n| 22 April\n| The fourth Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference convenes in London. The agenda is dominated by the imminence of India becoming a republic and its future within the Commonwealth.\n|-\n| 28 April\n| The Commonwealth Heads of Government issue the London Declaration. It allows India (and, thenceafter, all other members) to remain in the Commonwealth as a republic, creates the position of Head of the Commonwealth, and changes the name of the organisation to the Commonwealth of Nations. The decisions of the 1947 Commonwealth ministerial conference on nationality and citizenship are affirmed which allow states to create their own citizenship rules. Indians are agreed to be recognised as Commonwealth citizens, rather than British subjects, once India becomes a republic.\n|}\n1950s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! width=50px| Year\n! width=100px| Date\n!
