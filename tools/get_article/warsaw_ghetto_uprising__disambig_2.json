The left-wing Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB) and right-wing Jewish Military Union (ŻZW) formed and began to train. A small resistance effort to another roundup in January 1943 was partially successful and spurred Polish resistance groups to support the Jews in earnest.\nThe uprising started on 19 April when the ghetto refused to surrender to the police commander SS-Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, who ordered the destruction of the ghetto, block by block, ending on 16 May. A total of 13,000 Jews were killed, about half of them burnt alive or suffocated. Stroop reported 110 German casualties, including 17 killed.\nThe uprising was the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II. The Jews knew that victory was impossible and survival unlikely. Marek Edelman, the last surviving ŻOB commander who died in 2009, said their inspiration to fight was \"not to allow the Germans alone to pick the time and place of our deaths\". According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the uprising was \"one of the most significant occurrences in the history of the Jewish people\".\nBackground\nIn 1939, German authorities began to concentrate Poland's population of over three million Jews into a number of extremely crowded ghettos located in large Polish cities. The largest of these, the Warsaw Ghetto, collected approximately 300,000–400,000 people into a densely packed, 3.3&nbsp;km2 area of Warsaw. Thousands of Jews were killed by rampant disease and starvation under SS and Police Leader Odilo Globocnik and SS-Standartenführer Ludwig Hahn, even before the mass deportations from the ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp began.\nThe SS conducted many of the deportations during the operation code-named Grossaktion Warschau, between 23 July and 21 September 1942. Just before the operation began, the German \"Resettlement Commissioner\" SS-Sturmbannführer Hermann Höfle called a meeting of the Ghetto Jewish Council Judenrat and informed its leader, Adam Czerniaków, that he would require 7,000 Jews a day for \"resettlement to the East\". Czerniaków committed suicide once he became aware of the true goal of the \"resettlement\" plan. Approximately 254,000–300,000 ghetto residents were murdered at Treblinka during the two-month-long operation. The Grossaktion was directed by SS-Oberführer Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg, the SS and Police Leader of the Warsaw area since 1941. He would be relieved of duty as SS and Police Leader after failing to pacify the ghetto resistance and be subsequently replaced by Jürgen Stroop, who had been sent to Warsaw by Heinrich Himmler on 17 April 1943.\nWhen the deportations first began, members of the Jewish resistance movement met and decided not to fight the SS directives, believing that the Jews were being sent to labour camps and not to be murdered. But by the end of 1942, ghetto inhabitants learned that the deportations were part of an extermination process. Many of the remaining Jews decided to revolt. The first armed resistance in the ghetto occurred in January 1943.\nUprising\nJanuary revolt\nOn 18 January 1943, the Germans began their second deportation of the Jews, which led to the first instance of armed insurgency within the ghetto. While Jewish families hid in their so-called \"bunkers\", fighters of the ŻOB and ŻZW, resisted, engaging the Germans in direct clashes. Though the ŻZW and ŻOB suffered heavy losses (including some of their leaders), the Germans also took casualties, and the deportation was halted within a few days. About 1,200 Jews were killed, and about 5,000 deported, instead of the 8,000 planned by Germans. The fighters managed to kill about a dozen Germans and wound several dozen.\nHundreds of people in the Warsaw Ghetto were ready to fight, sparsely armed with handguns, gasoline bottles, and a few other weapons that had been smuggled into the ghetto by resistance fighters. Most of the Jewish fighters did not view their actions as an effective measure by which to save themselves, but rather as a battle for the honour of the Jewish people, and a protest against the world's silence.\nPreparations\nThe ŻZW and ŻOB built dozens of fighting posts and executed a number of Nazi collaborators, including Jewish Ghetto Police officers, members of the fake (German-sponsored and controlled) resistance organization Żagiew, as well as Gestapo and Abwehr agents (including the alleged agent and Judenrat associate Alfred Nossig, executed on 22 February 1943). The ŻOB established a prison to hold and execute traitors and collaborators. Józef Szeryński, former head of the Jewish Ghetto Police, committed suicide.\nMain revolt\ndistrict]]\n, destroyed in 1943]]\nOn 19 April 1943, on the eve of Passover, the SS, order police, and Trawniki auxiliary forces began the operation to deport the residents of the ghetto. Under von Sammern-Frankenegg's orders, the deportation action was to be completed within three days. After the ghetto was surrounded at about 2:00 a.m. the ŻOB put it into a high state of preparedness. Fighters were ordered to remain at their positions, civilians were told to hide in the underground shelters, and flags were raised. The walls were also covered with statements such as \"honorable death!\" and \"to arms! Women and children to the air raid shelters!\"\nThe operation commenced at 3:00 a.m. German forces entered the ghetto in two columns. A car with a loudspeaker was sent in with the attackers, summoning the Jews to voluntarily leave their hiding places and report for transport. As the columns moved into the ghetto, they were ambushed by Jewish insurgents firing and tossing Molotov cocktails and hand grenades from alleyways, sewers, and windows. One column was ambushed at the intersection of Nalewki and Gęsia Streets while the other was ambushed at the intersection of Zamenhof and Miła Streets. The German forces sustained casualties and two of their combat vehicles (an armed conversion of a French-made Lorraine 37L light armored vehicle and an armored car) were set on fire by the insurgents' petrol bombs. The Germans retreated after hours of combat. By 8:00 a.m. von-Sammern-Frankenegg had been dismissed from his position as SS and Police Leader of Warsaw by Heinrich Himmler due to his failure to suppress the uprising. He was replaced by SS-Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, who rejected von Sammern-Frankenegg's proposal to call in bomber aircraft from Kraków. He led a better-organized and reinforced ground attack.\nThe remaining Jews knew that the Germans would murder them and decided to resist to the last. While the uprising was underway, the Bermuda Conference was held by the Allies from 19 to 29 April 1943 to discuss the Jewish refugee problem. Discussions included the question of Jewish refugees who had been liberated by Allied forces and those who still remained in German-occupied Europe.\nHours after the initial attack had been repulsed, the German forces, now under Stroop's command, reentered the ghetto. Rather than focusing on roundups, Stroop's plan was to assault the main insurgent positions so as to push them into a smaller area and destroy them. The main objective was to take control of the area between Zamenhof and Nalewki Streets. The first attack was launched against Zamenhof Street. The German forces encountered resistance and took casualties, but the insurgents were ultimately forced to retreat. At noon, they attacked Nalewki Street, and the insurgents retreated after fighting for six hours. The Germans also bombarded the hospital on Gęsia Street, after which they entered the damaged building and massacred the patients. They then launched an assault on Muranowski Square but were pinned down by fierce resistance and did not manage to take it. The square was defended by ŻZW fighters, who had a machine gun. At 8:00 p.m. Stroop ordered a pause in the assault. German forces retreated from the ghetto while sentries outside of it were reinforced.\nThe following day, the Germans returned to the ghetto and issued an ultimatum to the Jewish fighters, threatening that unless they surrendered the ghetto would be razed. The ghetto resistance groups ignored the ultimatum and the Germans resumed their attacks. The Germans launched a fresh assault on Muranowski Square. The ŻZW fighters there had been joined by five Polish Home Army soldiers on 19 April who smuggled in weapons and ammunition and remained until the following day, losing two killed and two wounded in the fighting. The Germans were particularly determined to take down two flags the insurgents had raised from a building in the square, one Jewish and one Polish. The flags could be seen from most of Warsaw and inspired commentary in Polish underground publications as well as the Polish press in London. Stroop later remarked that \"those flags had tremendous political and psychological importance. They unified Poland in a way nothing else could. Hundreds of thousands of people were inspired by the sight of them or the knowledge that they were there. A flag is as much a weapon as a hundred guns.\" He claimed that Himmler had instructed him to take those flags down whatever the cost. Although in his report Stroop claimed to have conquered the square and taken down the flags on 20 April, eyewitness accounts suggest that combat continued there until 22 April when the ŻZW fighters were forced to retreat. In addition, during the battle for the square Stroop's friend, SS-Untersturmführer Otto Dehmke, was killed when gunfire detonated a hand grenade he was holding, and his death was listed as having occurred on 22 April. Stroop is thought to have had a few hundred Jewish prisoners summarily executed in retaliation for Dehmke's death.\nOn 20 April, heavy combat also took place on Miła Street and the area around the workshops but main battle centered around the brush factory. The assault there, which was personally led by Stroop, began at about 3:00 p.m. The insurgents repulsed the first attack, during which they detonated a hidden bomb as the Germans approached. After regrouping they launched another attack which again failed. The Germans then sent the factory's director in an attempt to negotiate with the insurgents, who rejected the offer. The fighting continued with the insurgents at the factory continuing to hold out. However, the Germans began setting fires which forced the resistance to retreat on the night of 21/22 April after evacuating civilians.\nThe slow progress in defeating the uprising was met with growing displeasure in Berlin. On 23 April, Himmler ordered that the operation should be continued \"with greater harshness and relentless severity.\" Stroop decided to advance by systematically burning the ghetto down block by block using flamethrowers and fire bottles, and blowing up cellars, bunkers, and sewers. \"We were beaten by the flames, not the Germans,\" survivor Marek Edelman said in 2007; he was deputy commander of the ŻOB and escaped the ghetto in its last days. In 2003, he recalled: \"The sea of flames flooded houses and courtyards. ... There was no air, only black, choking smoke and heavy burning heat radiating from the red-hot walls, from the glowing stone stairs.\"\nSurviving fighters and thousands of remaining Jewish civilians took cover in the sewer system and in the many dugout hiding places hidden among the ruins of the ghetto, referred to as \"bunkers\" by Germans and Jews alike. The Germans used dogs to detect such hideouts, then usually dropped smoke bombs to force people out. Sometimes they flooded these so-called bunkers or destroyed them with explosives. On occasions, shootouts occurred. A number of captured fighters lobbed hidden grenades or fired concealed handguns after surrendering.\nAlthough some Jews turned themselves in for deportation out of hunger or despair, most remained in hiding while the insurgents continued to resist. While the resistance had until then mostly taken place above ground, the Jewish fighters now fought mainly from their bunkers. The ŻOB's tactic was to fire at approaching enemy forces from bunkers while a second group would attack from behind after emerging from a secret exit in the bunker system. The insurgents emerged from their bunkers mainly at night to launch raids, seize weapons, and carry out reconnaissance, usually dressing in German uniforms and wearing rags around their feet. They continued to make efforts to contact the Polish resistance outside the ghetto. Some fighters would manage to escape the ghetto and attempt to join partisan groups elsewhere. The \"bunker wars\" lasted an entire month, during which German progress was slowed.\nWhile the battle continued inside the ghetto, Polish resistance groups AK and GL engaged the Germans between 19 and 23 April at six different locations outside the ghetto walls, firing at German sentries and positions. In one attack, three units of the AK under the command of Captain Józef Pszenny (\"Chwacki\") joined up in a failed attempt to breach the ghetto walls with explosives.\nOn 25 April, the insurgents suffered their single heaviest loss when a group of scouts trying to exit the ghetto through the sewers encountered an enemy patrol and was wiped out in a lopsided battle. On the following day, the Polish resistance outside the ghetto received what was probably the last report from the ŻOB's high command: \"For eight days now we have been engaged in a deadly battle. The Germans suffered numerous losses, the first two days they were forced to retreat. Later on, they had reinforcements brought in, including tanks, armoured cars, artillery and even planes that came into action for the planned siege. Our losses, i.e. victims of fusillades and fires in which men, women and children were killed, are very significant. Our last days are approaching. But we will continue to fight and to resist as long as we hold weapons in our hands.\"\nFighting continued in several locations. Of the 26 streets in the ghetto, 20 were burning on 27 April. On the same day, the Germans took over several shelters at the workshop grounds by flooding them. According to the ŻOB’s report: \"A dense, caustic smoke hung in the streets of the ghetto.\" Many people jumped to their deaths from burning houses. In some cases, people tried to cushion their falls by throwing mattresses down first. Stroop wrote that \"with broken bones, they tried to crawl through the streets into blocks of houses that were not yet or only partially on fire.\" Heavy fighting took place again at Muranowski Square. Eventually, the ŻZW lost all of its commanders and on 29 April, the remaining fighters from the organization escaped the ghetto through the Muranowski tunnel and relocated to the Michalin forest. In spite of these conditions, resistance continued with some leadership and coordination remaining, although communications between bunkers worsened.\nAs the fighting continued into May, the area of resistance became gradually smaller as the Germans advanced. The main battles took place on Miła, Dzika, Wołyńska and Szczęśliwa Streets. Fighting also took place in some adjacent streets. The ŻOB’s main command post was the Anielewicz Bunker at 18 Miła Street, with important bases also located at 35 Nalewki Street and 22 Franciscan Street. On 1 May, insurgents based at Nalewki Street launched a daytime attack which caused German troops to initially retreat before counterattacking, after which the insurgents fled to 18 Miła Street. The insurgents also held out on Franciscan Street from 1 to 3 May until the Germans used gas or smoke to drive the Jews out of shelter. About half were killed while the rest retreated to 18 Miła Street. The last battles of the workshop grounds were fought from 4 to 7 May, with the insurgents holding out despite ammunition shortages, hunger, and heavy losses. However, they continued to resist fiercely until the final hours. Several bunkers were destroyed by the Germans. Also on 7 May, the insurgents lost a group of scouts attempting to exit the ghetto walls.\nOn 8 May, the Germans assaulted the Anielewicz Bunker at 18 Miła Street. Most of the organization's remaining leadership and dozens of others committed mass suicide by ingesting cyanide, including Mordechai Anielewicz, the chief commander of ŻOB. His deputy Marek Edelman escaped the ghetto through the sewers with a handful of comrades two days later.\nWith the fall of the ŻOB's headquarters and the ghetto largely destroyed, organized resistance ended but small groups of insurgents continued to function independently. With no fixed bases, they moved constantly and only had sporadic contact with the Polish resistance. On the night of 13/14 May, the Soviet Air Forces bombed military objectives in Warsaw, with some bombs falling near the ghetto or on Pawiak Prison inside it. Taking advantage of the chaos, the Jewish fighters launched several attacks on German patrols. Several attempts were also made to flee the ghetto but only a small number of Jews succeeded. After the bombing, Jews continued to try to escape the cordon.\nOn 10 May, Szmul Zygielbojm, a Bundist member of the Polish government in exile, committed suicide in London to protest the lack of action on behalf of the Jews by the Allied governments. In his farewell note, he wrote:\nBesides claiming an estimated 56,065 Jews accounted for (although his own figures showed the number to be 57,065) and noting that \"The number of destroyed dug-outs amounts to 631,\" in his official report dated 24 May 1943, Stroop listed the following as captured booty:\nOn 15 May, the last buildings in the ghetto except for the Great Synagogue of Warsaw were destroyed. The Great Synagogue itself was blown up a day later. Stroop personally detonated it. This was the last act of destruction in the suppression of the uprising. Stroop subsequently informed Heinrich Himmler and Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger, the Higher SS and Police Leader of the General Government, that the ghetto had been destroyed.\nSporadic resistance continued, with the last skirmish taking place on 5 June 1943 between Germans and a holdout group of armed Jews without connections to the resistance organizations.\nCasualties\nsoldiers killed during the Ghetto Action.]]\nAround 13,000 Jews were killed in the ghetto during the uprising (some 6,000 among them were burnt alive or died from smoke inhalation). Of the remaining 50,000 residents, almost all were captured and shipped to the death camps of Majdanek and Treblinka.\nJürgen Stroop's internal SS daily report for Friedrich Krüger, written on 16 May 1943, stated:\nAccording to the casualty lists in Stroop's report, German forces suffered a total of 110 casualties – 17 dead (of whom 16 were killed in action) and 93 injured – of whom 101 are listed by name. These figures did not include Jewish collaborators but did include the Trawniki men and Polish police under his command. Of the 16 personnel reported as killed in action by Stroop, 14 were SS, Wehrmacht, or order police personnel, two were Trawniki men, and one was a Polish policeman. Those wounded and listed by name in his report include 60 Waffen-SS soldiers, 11 Trawniki men, 12 Sicherheitspolizei officers, 5 Polish policemen, and 2 Wehrmacht pioneers.\nOther sources have questioned the number of German casualties. Edelman claims that the German casualties amounted to 300 killed and wounded. The official German casualty figures were kept low, while the propaganda bulletins of the Polish Underground State, claimed that hundreds of occupiers had been killed in the fighting. But according to historian Israel Gutman, who himself had been a fighter in the uprising, \"the number cited by Stroop (16 dead, 85 wounded) cannot be rejected out of hand, but it is likely that his list was neither complete, free of errors, nor indicative of the German losses throughout the entire period of resistance, until the absolute liquidation of Jewish life in the ghetto. All the same, the German casualty figures cited by the various Jewish sources are probably highly exaggerated.\" Raul Hilberg claimed that official German casualty figures were accurate.\nThe Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was the largest single revolt by Jews during World War II.\nGerman daily losses of killed/wounded and the official figures for killed or captured Jews and \"bandits\", according to the Stroop report:\n* 19 April: 1 killed, 24 wounded; 580 captured\n* 20 April: 3 killed, 10 wounded; 533 captured\n* 21 April: 0 killed, 5 wounded; 5,200 captured\n* 22 April: 3 killed, 1 wounded; 6,580 captured; 203 \"Jews and bandits\" killed; 35 Poles killed outside the Ghetto\n* 23 April: 0 killed, 3 wounded; 4,100 captured; 200 \"Jews and bandits\" killed; 3 Jews captured outside the Ghetto.Total of 19,450 Jews reported caught\n* 24 April: 0 killed, 3 wounded; 1,660 captured; 1,811 \"pulled out of dugouts, about 330 shot\".\n* 25 April: 0 killed, 4 wounded; 1,690 captured; 274 shot; \"very large portion of the bandits ... captured\".

Total of 57,065 Jews either captured or killed\nAftermath\nAfter the uprising was over, most of the incinerated houses were razed, and the Warsaw concentration camp complex was established in their place. Thousands of people died in the camp or were executed in the ruins of the ghetto. The SS hunted Jews hiding in the ruins. On 19 April 1943, the first day of the most significant period of the resistance, 7,000 Jews were transported from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka extermination camp. Many purportedly developed resistance groups and helped to plan and execute the revolt and mass escape of 2 August 1943. From May 1943 to August 1944, executions in the ruins of the ghetto were carried out by:\n* Officers of the Warsaw SD facility and the security police, under the supervision of Dr. Ludwig Hahn, whose seat was located in Szuch Avenue;\n* Pawiak staff members;\n* KL Warschau staff members;\n* SS-men from the Third Battalion of the 23rd SS Regiment and the Police (Battalion III/SS-Polizei Regiment 23), commanded by Major Otton Bundtke.\nOpen and secret executions carried out in Warsaw were led by SS-Obersturmführer Norbert Bergh-Trips, SS-Haupturmführer Paul Werner and SS-Obersturmführer Walter Witossek. The latter often presided over the police \"trio\", signing mass death sentences for Polish political prisoners, which were later pronounced by the ad hoc court of the security police.\nIn October 1943, Bürkl was tried and condemned to death in absentia by the Polish Resistance's Underground court, and shot dead by the AK in Warsaw, a part of Operation Heads that targeted notorious SS officers. That same month, von Sammern-Frankenegg was killed by Yugoslav Partisans in an ambush in Croatia. Himmler, Globocnik and Krüger all committed suicide at the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.\nThe General Government Governor of Warsaw at the time of the Uprising, Dr. Ludwig Fischer, was tried and executed in 1947. Stroop was captured by Americans in Germany, convicted of war crimes in two trials (U.S. military and Polish), and executed by hanging in Poland in 1952, along with Warsaw Ghetto SS administrator Franz Konrad. Stroop's aide, Erich Steidtmann, was exonerated for \"minimal involvement\"; he died in 2010 while under investigation for war crimes.  Sturmbannführer Hermann Höfle who helped carry out the July 1942 Grossaktion Warsaw committed suicide after being arrested in 1962. Walter Bellwidt, who commanded a Waffen-SS battalion among Stroop forces, died on 13 October 1965. Hahn went into hiding until 1975, when he was apprehended and sentenced to life for crimes against humanity; he served eight years and died in 1986. SS Oberführer Arpad Wigand who served with von Sammern-Frankenberg as SS and Police Leader in Warsaw from 4 August 1941 to 23 April 1943 was tried for war crimes in Hamburg Germany in 1981 and sentenced to 12.5 years in prison; died 26 July 1983. Walter Reder reportedly served in the SS Panzer Grenadier Training Battalion III; he served a jail sentence in Italy from 1951 to 1985 for war crimes committed in 1944 in Italy and died in 1991. Josef Blösche was tried for war crimes and executed in 1969. Heinrich Klaustermeyer was tried for war crimes in 1965 and sentenced to life in prison. In 1976, he was released from prison on the grounds of his advanced cancer and died 13 days later.\nand the Battalion Zośka fighters during the Warsaw uprising in August 1944]]\nThe Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 took place over a year before the Warsaw uprising of 1944. The ghetto had been destroyed by the time of the general uprising in the city, which was part of the Operation Tempest, a nationwide insurrection plan. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Polish Home Army's Battalion Zośka was able to rescue 380 Jewish prisoners (mostly foreign) held in the concentration camp \"Gęsiówka\" set up by the Germans in an area adjacent to the ruins of former ghetto. These prisoners had been brought from Auschwitz and forced to clear the remains of the ghetto. A few small groups of ghetto residents also managed to survive in the undetected \"bunkers\" and to eventually reach the \"Aryan side\". Several hundred survivors from the first uprising took part in the later uprising (mostly in non-combat roles such as logistics and maintenance, due to their physical state and general shortage of arms), joining the ranks of the Polish Home Army and the Armia Ludowa. According to Samuel Krakowski from the Jewish Historical Institute, \"The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising had a real influence ... in encouraging the activity of the Polish underground.\"\nA number of survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, known as the \"Ghetto Fighters\", went on to create the kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot (literally: \"Ghetto Fighters'\"), which is located north of Acre, Israel. The founding members of the kibbutz include Yitzhak Zuckerman (Icchak Cukierman), who represented the ŻOB on the 'Aryan' side, and his wife Zivia Lubetkin, who commanded a fighting unit. In 1984, members of the kibbutz published Daphei Edut (\"Testimonies of Survival\"), four volumes of personal testimonies from 96 kibbutz members. The settlement features a museum and archives dedicated to remembering the Holocaust. Yad Mordechai, a kibbutz just north of the Gaza Strip, was named after Mordechaj Anielewicz. In 2008, Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi led a group of Israeli officials to the site of the uprising and spoke about the event's \"importance for IDF combat soldiers\".\nby Nathan Rapoport]]\nIn 1968, the 25th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Zuckerman was asked what military lessons could be learned from the uprising. He replied:\nOn 7 December 1970, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt spontaneously knelt while visiting the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes memorial in the People's Republic of Poland. At the time, the action surprised many and was the focus of controversy, but it has since been credited with helping improve relations between the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries. Many people from the United States and Israel came for the 1983 commemoration. The last surviving Jewish resistance fighter, Simcha Rotem, died in Jerusalem on 22 December 2018, at age 94.\nOpposing forces\nJewish\n, Bluma and Rachela Wyszogrodzka captured after offering armed resistance.]]\nTwo Jewish underground organisations fought in the Warsaw Uprising: the left wing ŻOB founded in July 1942 by Zionist Jewish youth groups within the Warsaw Ghetto; and the right wing ŻZW, or Jewish Military Union, a national organization founded in 1939 by former Polish military officers of Jewish background which had strong ties to the Polish Home Army and cells in almost every major town across Poland. However, both organisations were officially incorporated into the Polish Home Army and its command structure in exchange for weapons and training.\nMarek Edelman, who was the only surviving uprising commander from the left-wing ŻOB, stated that the ŻOB had 220 fighters and each was armed with a handgun, grenades, and Molotov cocktails. His organization had three rifles in each area, as well as two land mines and one submachine gun. Due to its socialist leanings, the Soviets and Israel promoted the actions of ŻOB as the dominant or only party in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, a view often adopted by secondary sources in the West.\nThe right-wing faction ŻZW, which was founded by former Polish officers, was larger, more established and had closer ties with the Polish Home Army, making it better equipped. Zimmerman describes the arms supplies for the uprising as \"limited but real\". Specifically, Jewish fighters of the ŻZW received from the Polish Home Army: 2 heavy machine guns, 4 light machine guns, 21 submachine guns, 30 rifles, 50 pistols, and over 400 grenades for the uprising. During the Uprising, ŻZW is reported to have had about 400 well-armed fighters grouped in 11 units, with 4 units including fighters from the Polish Home Army. Due to the ŻZW's anti-socialist stand and close ties with the Polish Home Army (which was subsequently outlawed by the Soviets), the Soviets suppressed publication of books and articles on ŻZW after the war and downplayed its role in the uprising, in favor of the more socialist ŻOB.\nMore weapons were supplied throughout the uprising, and some were captured from the Germans. Some weapons were handmade by the resistance; sometimes such weapons worked.\nShortly before the uprising, Polish-Jewish historian Emanuel Ringelblum (who managed to escape from the Warsaw Ghetto but was later discovered and executed in 1944) visited a ŻZW armoury hidden in the basement at 7 Muranowska Street. In his notes, which form part of Oneg Shabbat archives, he reported:\nThey were armed with revolvers stuck in their belts. Different kinds of weapons were hung in the large rooms: light machine guns, rifles, revolvers of different kinds, hand grenades, bags of ammunition, German uniforms, etc., all of which were utilized to the full in the April \"action\". (...) While I was there, a purchase of arms was made from a former Polish Army officer, amounting to a quarter of a million zloty; a sum of 50,000 zlotys was paid on account. Two machine guns were bought at 40,000 złoty each, and a large amount of hand grenades and bombs.\nAlthough the Home Army's stocks were meager, and general provision of arms limited, the right-wing ŻZW received significant quantities of armaments, including some heavy and light machine guns, submachine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades.\nPolish\nDue to the nature of the conflict and that it took place within the confines of German-guarded Ghetto, the role of the Polish Home Army was primarily one of ancillary support; namely, the provision of arms, ammunition and training. However, according to Marian Fuks, the Ghetto uprising would not have been possible without assistance from the Polish Resistance. Before the uprising started, the most important aid from the Polish resistance to the Jewish resistance took part of weapon smuggling and delivery. Some of the earliest weapons delivered to the ghetto in mid-1942 came from the communist Gwardia Ludowa group, which in August 1942 provided Jewish resistance with 9 pistols and 5 hand grenades'. Antoni Chruściel, commander of the Home Army in Warsaw, ordered the entire armory of the Wola district transferred to the ghetto. In January 1943 the Home Army delivered a larger shipment: 50 pistols, 50 hand grenades' and several kilograms of explosives, and together with a number of smaller shipments transferred around that time a total of 70 pistols, 10 rifles, 2 hand machine guns, 1 light machine gun, as well as ammunition and over 150 kilograms of explosives. Acquisition of weapons was supported from both Jewish and Polish funds, including those of Żegota. The Home Army also provided intelligence on German movements, connected Jewish resistance to some black market channels, and provided planning assistance for plans to defend the ghetto and safeguard the refugees. Home Army also disseminated information and appeals to help the Jews in the ghetto, both in Poland and by way of radio transmissions to the Allies, which fell largely on deaf ears.\n}}\nDuring the uprising, units from the Polish Home Army and the communist Gwardia Ludowa attacked German units near the ghetto walls and attempted to smuggle weapons, ammunition, supplies, and instructions into the ghetto. The command of the Home Army ordered its sabotage units, Kedyw, to carry a series of actions around the walls against the German units under the codename Ghetto Action. A failed attempt to breach the ghetto walls on 19 April has been described as \"one of the first large-scale battles carried out by the Home Army's Warsaw division.\" Between 19 and 23 April 1943, the Polish resistance engaged the Germans at six different locations outside the ghetto walls, shooting at German sentries and positions and in one case attempting to blow up a gate. Overall, the Home Army conduced seven total operations in support of the uprising. Following two unsuccessful attempts to breach the wall, the other operations focused on harassing Germans and their auxiliaries, inflicting a number of casualties. A National Security Corps unit commanded by Henryk Iwański (\"Bystry\") reportedly fought inside the ghetto along with ŻZW and subsequently both groups retreated together (including 34 Jewish fighters) to the Aryan side; however later research cast doubts on the veracity of Iwański's claims. Several ŻOB commanders and fighters also later escaped through the tunnels with assistance from the Poles and joined the Polish Home Army).\n}}\nFile:Plakat wydany przez Zydowska Organizacje Bojowa.png|Poster printed by ŻOB: \"All people are equal brothers; Brown, White, Black and Yellow.

Records confirm that the leftist ŻOB received less weaponry and support from the Polish Home Army, unlike the ŻZW with whom the Home Army had close ties and ideological similarities. Some survivors criticized gentile Poles for not providing sufficient support; for example in her book On Both Sides of the Wall, Vladka Meed, who was a member of the ŻOB, devoted a chapter to the insufficient support from the Polish resistance. The Home Army faced a number of dilemmas which resulted in it providing only a limited assistance to the Jewish resistance; these include the fact that it had very limited supplies and was unable to arm its own troops; the view (shared by most of the Jewish resistance) that any wide-scale uprising in 1943 would be premature and futile; and the difficulty to coordinate with the internally divided Jewish resistance, coupled with the pro-Soviet attitude of the ŻOB.\nGerman\nJürgen Stroop (center). 2nd from right is Heinrich Klaustermeyer.

According to Hanna Krall, the German task force dispatched to put down the revolt and complete the deportation action numbered 2,090 men armed with a number of minethrowers and other light and medium artillery pieces, several armored vehicles, and more than 200 machine and submachine guns. Its backbone consisted of 821 Waffen-SS soldiers and 9 officers from five SS Panzergrenadier reserve and training battalions and one SS cavalry reserve and training battalion. Other forces included 228 gendarmes and 6 officers of the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo) order police (battalions from the 22nd and 23rd regiments), 335 Trawniki men led by 2 officers, 56 Wehrmacht soldiers and 3 officers comprising a battery of anti-aircraft artillery and two detachments of railroad combat engineers, Warsaw personnel of the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) intelligence service, and technical emergency corps.\nSeveral Gestapo jailers from the nearby Pawiak Prison, led by Franz Bürkl, volunteered to join the \"hunt\" for the Jews. A force of 363 officers from the Polish Police of the General Government (so-called Blue Police) was ordered by the Germans to cordon the walls of the ghetto. Warsaw fire department personnel were also forced to help in the operation. Jewish policemen were used in the first phase of the ghetto's liquidation and subsequently summarily executed by the Gestapo.\nStroop later remarked:\nI had two battalions of Waffen-SS, one hundred army men, units of Order Police, and seventy-five to a hundred Security Police people. The Security Police had been active in the Warsaw Ghetto for some time, and during this program it was their function to accompany SS units in groups of six or eight, as guides and experts in ghetto matters.\npeer into a doorway past the bodies of Jews killed during the suppression of the uprising at Zamenhofa 42 / Kupiecka 18.]]\nBy his own words, Stroop reported that after he took command on 19 April 1943, the forces at his disposal totaled 31 officers and 1,262 men:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|Units at Stroop's Disposal\n|Personnel\n|-\n| style=\"padding-left: 2em;\" | SS-Panzer Gren.

Eisner's autobiography The Survivor (1980), Andrzej Wajda's films A Generation (1955), Samson (1961), Holy Week (1995), and Jon Avnet's film Uprising (2001).\nThe photograph of a boy surrendering outside a bunker, with Trawniki with submachine guns in the background, became one of the best-known photographs of World War II and the Holocaust:}} He is said to represent all 6 million Jewish Holocaust victims.
