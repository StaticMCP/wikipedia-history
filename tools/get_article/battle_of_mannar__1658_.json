This battle, along with the subsequent capture of Jaffna would mark the end of Portuguese Ceylon.\nBackground\nThe Dutch, under the leadership of Gerard Pietersz Hulft, placed the main Portuguese base of Colombo under siege in 1655 and captured it. Which then allowed Rijckloff van Goens to launch a campaign, with Mannar being one of his targets.\nBattle\nAdmiral Rijckloff van Goens arrived before Mannar with a large fleet with the goal to capture the remaining Portuguese strongholds in Ceylon, Mannar being one of them. And after a short conflict between the two, the Island of Mannar was subsequently ceded to the Dutch.\nAftermath\nAfter the battle, Rijckloff van Goens marched towards Jaffna and took the city after a siege. This marked the end of Portuguese influence in Ceylon, and would then result in the Dutch and the Kingdom of Kandy splitting the territory of the former Portuguese Ceylon.\nReferences\nSources\n* |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=The Portuguese in Sri Lanka (1505–1658)|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Sri-Lanka/Kandy-and-its-struggle-with-European-powers}}\n*"
