Tony \"T. Money\" Green is an American bass player, record producer, and award-winning songwriter well known for his work with Death Row Records, Dr. Dre, George Clinton, Five Special, Snoop Dogg, The Dramatics, Tupac, and Warren G.\nBiography\nTony began playing the bass at 14 years old. After forming his band in 1971, the Roadwork crew, Tony's passion for the music business grew tremendously. In 1975, L.J. Reynolds from The Dramatics noticed Tony's talent playing at a local club in Detroit. After auditioning for The Dramatics, Tony earned the bass players position in the group. Tony played bass, wrote, and produced many of their many of their hits including four songs from The Dramatic's gold album ‘Do What You Wanna Do’, as well as their last top 10 song ‘Welcome Back Home’.\nIn 1978, Tony Green and Ron Banks of the Dramatics teamed up with George Clinton and wrote one of hip-hop's most sampled songs ‘One Of Those Funky Things’ from Parliament's ‘Motor Booty Affair’. Even greater success came when Tony became the band director and bass player for Death Row Records in 1993. Throughout the development of the G-Funk sound, Tony's signature bass lines elevated several hit projects that went platinum including the Doggystyle album by Snoop Dogg, the All Eyez on Me album by Tupac, the Poetic Justice Soundtrack, the Above The Rim Soundtrack, the Grammy award-winning ‘Let Me Ride’ (Remix) by Dr. Dre, and Regulate by Warren G (''see addt'l credits under Discography'').\nAs Founder and CEO of Hyped International Records, Tony has continued to develop an impressive repertoire of compositions referred to simply as ‘The Vault’. Many of his projects are an eclectic blend of R&B, Hip-Hop, Funk, Soul, and Rock n’ Roll.
