All 54 seats in the House of Assembly (the lower house, whose members were elected at the 1893 election) were up for re-election. It was the first election in Australia in which women could vote, following the passing of the Constitutional Amendment (Adult Suffrage) Act 1894 two years prior.\nThe election used non-compulsory plurality block voting, in which electors voted for as many candidates as they wished. Members of the House of Assembly were elected to 27 multi-member districts consisting of two seats each. Suffrage extended to all persons (including Aboriginals) over 21 years of age, unless they were \"attainted or convicted of treason or felony\".\nBackground\nThe period after the 1893 election saw an increasing competition between the two new political parties – the ULP and the conservative National Defence League (NDL). It also reflected a trend for the conservative members to gravitate to the NDL, and the progressive members to support Kingston, a strong advocate of progressive social policy and reform of the Legislative Council. There was no formal \"Liberal\" or \"Kingston\" party, but there was a relatively cohesive Kingston group among both independent members and candidates. The Liberal and Democratic Union would not be formed until the 1906 election.\nThe election was held concurrently with the first referendum in Australia.\nWomen's suffrage in Australia took a leap forward – enacted in 1895 and taking effect from this election, South Australia was the first in Australia and only the second in the world after New Zealand to allow women to vote, and the first in the world to allow women to stand for election. However, the first female would not be elected to the Parliament of South Australia until the 1959 election when Jessie Cooper and Joyce Steele were elected for the Liberal and Country League, and the 1965 election for Labor with Molly Byrne.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-datatable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+House of Assembly (BV) – Turnout 66.3% (Non-CV)\n| colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px\" |Party\n! colspan=\"3\" |Votes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Seats\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px;\" |Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | %\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Swing ()\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\" |Change\n|-\n|  |&nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Independent\n| 72,676\n| 45.2\n| –13.8\n| 24\n|  2\n|-\n|  |&nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |National Defence\n| 49,200\n| 30.6\n| +8.4\n| 18\n|  4\n|-\n|  |&nbsp;\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |United Labor\n| 39,107\n| 24.3\n| +5.5\n| 12\n|  2\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Total\n|160,983\n|100.0\n|–\n|54\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Informal votes\n| 1,433\n| 1.6\n| +0.3\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Turnout\n| 91,267\n| 66.3\n| –1.3\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |Registered voters\n| 137,747\n|–\n|–\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:left; background-color:#eaecf0\" |Source: ECSA\n|}\nSee also\n*Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1893–1896\n*1894 South Australian Legislative Council election\nReferences\n*"
