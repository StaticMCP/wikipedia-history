It fought on the Western Front.\nOrder of battle\n* 9th (Service) Battalion, Norfolk Regiment\n* 9th (Service) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment (disbanded in February 1918)\n* 8th (Service) Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment (moved to 16th Brigade in November 1915)\n* 11th (Service) Battalion, Essex Regiment (moved to 18th Brigade in October 1915)\n* 2nd Battalion, Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment) (from 18th Brigade October 1915)\n* 1st Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment (from 16th Brigade in November 1915)\n* 71st Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 14 March 1916, moved to 6th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 1 March 1918)\n* 71st Trench Mortar Battery (formed April 1916)\nSecond World War\n, Holland, 23 October 1944.]]\nThe 71st Infantry Brigade was reformed in the Second World War on 28 November 1940, by the redesignation of the Headquarters of 3rd London Infantry Brigade. On 12 December it was redesignated 71st Independent Infantry Brigade. The new 71st Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions raised earlier in the year specifically for war service, the 7th Bn King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) and 8th and 9th Bn York and Lancaster Regiment. The battalions were all transferred to British India on 14 June 1942 and the brigade ceased to be independent and was again redesignated 71st Infantry Brigade. On the same date, the battalions in the brigade were replaced by the 1st Battalion (a Regular unit) of the East Lancashire Regiment and 1st (also Regular) and 13th (a war service battalion) Highland Light Infantry (the 13th were later replaced by 1st Ox and Bucks).
