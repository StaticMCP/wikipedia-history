The restorers prevented their enemies from forcing the passage and withdrew during the night to meet the rest of the army, leaving a dead man in the field, carrying a wounded man and having a scattered corporal during the night.\nFor this action Lorenzo Colipí was promoted to lieutenant and the government decreed a decoration dedicated to the \"Eleven of the Llaclla bridge.\"\nReferences"
