It was signed prior to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of the European Union as a Continuity trade agreement in order to protect trade and investment between the two parties as the UK would no longer be a party of the European Union–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement.\nThe agreement replicates the European Union–Vietnam FTA terms with minor changes.\nTrade value between the United Kingdom and Vietnam was worth £7,057 million in 2022.\nSee also\n* Economy of the United Kingdom\n* Economy of Vietnam\n* Free trade agreements of the United Kingdom\n* Free trade agreements of Vietnam\nReferences"
