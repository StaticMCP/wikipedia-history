Nearby is an alluvial flood plain, mostly leading directly to the north branch of the Condamine River. This flood plain provides some of the best quality grains and cotton in Australia and utilises overland flood flows for irrigation purposes.\nClimate\n|date=March 2013|source=}}\nHistory\nThe first known people to have lived on the land surrounding Pittsworth are the Giabal people.\nSituated on the Darling Downs, Pittsworth owes its existence to that great explorer and botanist Allan Cunningham who in early June 1827 discovered and named the area around Warwick and to the north, the Darling Downs.\nEarly settlement was driven by the taking up of land for the Beauaraba pastoral station.

On 4 November 1889, it was renamed Pittsworth State School. At the 50th anniversary celebrations in 1932, \"there was a large attendance, and 50 or more trees were planted. Mr. W. P. Adam, who for 14 years was head teacher of the school, but is now retired, called the roll of the school of 50 years ago, and the following-answered \"present\": Percy Cornford, William Carter. J. Muir, W. Muir, a Kirkup, and Mrs. J. Oarliach.\"  From 3 February 1958 the school also offered secondary education, until a separate secondary school opened in 1967.

It was renamed Pittsworth in 1886.\nThe first St Andrew's Anglican Church was  designed by the prominent Toowoomba architect John Marks in 1888-89. It was at 18 Murray Street. The foundation stone of the second St Andrew's Anglican Church was laid on 3 November 1912, and the building was consecrated on 7 October 1913 by Archbishop St Clair Donaldson.\nAfter a number of years of pastoral settlement, the town was established and slowly grew to offer services for the surrounding agricultural industries. The Co-operative Dairy Company opened in 1896. It was noted by the correspondent for the Darling Downs Gazette that \"the milk brought by the suppliers is of a very high quality, comparing favourably with the highest tests in the colony. The cheese turned out of this factory, I may state, is of excellent quality, and is finding a ready market throughout many of the Northern towns.\"\nIn 1901, a Methodist Church and parsonage was built in Pittsworth at a cost of £783. The church officially opened on 5 May 1901.The first Pittsworth Show was held in March 1902, and opened by the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Samuel Griffith, and attended by an estimated 2,500 people.\nThe foundation stone of St Stephen's Catholic church was laid in 1908.

In 1923, the Pittsworth Dairy Company made a single block of cheddar cheese weighing 3360 lb which was shipped to the Queensland exhibit at the Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park. The same company exceeded its ownefforts in 1925, exhibiting a single cheese that was 4000lb, becoming the World Record holder for the largest single block of cheese.\nPittsworth was declared a local authority in 24 April 1913, separating from Jondaryan.

The school was known as St Joseph's Convent School until a new school was built in 1958 and named St Stephen's Catholic School. The Sisters operated the school until 1981 after which the school continued with lay teachers. The convent building at 26 Weale Street had been used for some years as a parish centre, and was listed by the Pittsworth Shire Council for its heritage values, but the church was unable to afford the upkeep of the building, and it was sold for relocation in December 2013, being taken to 1154 Yandina Coolum Road, Maroochy River and restored as a private residence. The school celebrated its centenary in August 2016 including the publication of a school history.\nThe Pittsworth Branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association opened in 1924.  At the meeting held in the Masonic Hall to consider opening a branch in Pittsworth, the Darling Downs organiser, Mrs. Fairfax, explained that \"the main object of members was to work for their sisters that were less fortunate than themselves, and spoke of the benefits of the reduced railway fares, the education of children out back, the homes at the seaside, and the bush nurses, and various other branches of work that is handled by the Association.\" The first President was Mrs. H.C.
