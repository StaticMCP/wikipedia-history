      "text": "# War crime apologia\n\nIn France, war crime apology is a legal concept and a criminal offense based on the promotion and justification of war crimes.\nDefinition\nThe glorification of war crimes and crimes against humanity are distinct offenses but both are prohibited by article 24, paragraph 5, of the law of July 29, 1881:\nWill be punished with the same penalty [five years' imprisonment and a fine of 45,000 euros] those who ... have advocated the crimes referred to in the first paragraph, war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes of enslavement or exploitation of a person reduced to slavery or crimes and misdemeanors of collaboration with the enemy, including if these crimes have not given rise to the conviction of their perpetrators.\nThe definition of an \"apology\" is not specified. It may be the desire to justify a crime, which is not to be confused with praise or provocation (incitement) to commit this crime: \"it is enough that such remarks, once projected into the future , encourage people to pass a favorable judgment on crimes of this nature.\"\nReferences"
