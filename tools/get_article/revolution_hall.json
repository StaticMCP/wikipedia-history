It is located within the former Washington High School, and was originally constructed as the school's auditorium. The auditorium was in use from the school's opening in 1924 to its closure in 1981, and was unused until February 2015. As part of a larger redevelopment Venerable Properties that saw the school converted into office and retail space, the auditorium was renovated into a music venue. During construction, two bars and a roof deck were added, but the original wooden seats were preserved.\nThe venue officially opened on April 17, 2015, with a concert by Neko Case.\nFile:NE corner former Washington HS building with Revolution Hall marquee (8-2015).jpg|The building's northeast corner, with marquee for Revolution Hall\nFile:Sarah Jeong XOXO Festival 2016 alt1.jpg|Sarah Jeong speaks at Revolution Hall during the 2016 XOXO Festival.\nReception\nRevolution Hall won in the \"Best Patio\" category, and earned second place in the \"Best Music Venue\" category, of Willamette Week \"Best of Portland Readers' Poll 2020\".\nIn popular culture\nIn the 2022 film, Metal Lords, scenes for a Battle of the Bands were filmed at Revolution Hall.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
