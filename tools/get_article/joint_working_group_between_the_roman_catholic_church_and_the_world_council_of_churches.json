This meeting came a few months after the promulgation of the conciliar document Unitatis Redintegratio.\nDebate on proselytism\nThe Joint Working Group has collaborated in dialogue on the topic of proselytism, which was deemed harmful to Christian unity.\nUps and downs in collaboration\nAccording to Armenian Catholicos Aram I, there have been ups and down in WCC–Catholic Church collaboration. In particular, he cites ecumenical tensions surrounding the ecclesial documents Dominus Iesus and Ecclesia de Eucharistia, as well as the question of the Eastern Catholic Churches.\nCurrent goals\nAreas of concern for the Joint Working Group have been the communication of the results of its studies, deliberations, and declarations to the parent bodies, the reception of its reports, and the implementation of its recommendations.\nReferences"
