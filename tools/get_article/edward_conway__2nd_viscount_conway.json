He matriculated from The Queen's College, Oxford, on 3 May 1611 and is thought to have learnt military strategy from his uncle by marriage, Sir Horace Vere. He was knighted on 25 March 1618, and in 1621, he married Frances Popham (a daughter of Sir Francis Popham). He succeeded his father in the peerage in January 1631.\nPolitical and military service\nConway was nominated by Lord Brooke to become Member of Parliament for Warwick between 1624 and 1625, and in 1626, he was elected for Yarmouth (Isle of Wight). In 1628, after his father was created Viscount Conway and Viscount Killultagh, Conway was summoned to parliament in the right of the Conway barony. He succeeded his father to his titles following his death on 3 January 1631.\nLord Conway unsuccessfully commanded Charles I's forces at the Battle of Newburn in 1640. He became an Irish Privy Counsellor, Marshal of the Army in Ireland, and was served as a member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines from 1643 to 1649.\nHe was briefly imprisoned after being implicated in the plot by Edmund Waller and others to seize London for the king.\nPersonal life\nLike his father, Lord Conway had a particular interest in English literature, with literary connections including Sir John Beaumont, Michael Drayton, Ben Jonson, John Donne, and Sir John Suckling. In 1643, his London library was catalogued as containing 5,000 or more volumes, and his library at Lisnagarvey in County Antrim contained between 8,000 and 9,900 books and manuscripts.\nHe retired to the house of The 10th Earl of Northumberland in Petworth, Sussex, in the early 1650s. He later travelled abroad and died in Lyon, France on 26 June 1655. He was buried in Arrow, and his titles passed to his only son, Edward, who was later created Earl of Conway. His daughter Dorothy married Sir George Rawdon, 1st Baronet.\nReferences\n*"
