N. Williams cabin ruin\nMcDearmon–Tibbs–Scott house ruin\nSamuel D. McDearmon purchased the undeveloped  \"Clover Hill\" tract from Hugh Raine in 1846, cutting off  for a county seat for the new Appomattox county.  In 1849 he began improving the now  property adding $1,056 (~$}} in ) worth of buildings.  By 1851 he had made improvements totaling $2,800, (~$}} in ) likely indicating that the mansion house had been completed.  This chronology also corresponds to his known political and financial zenith. Although he offered the tract for sale in October 1854, Jacob Tibbs did not purchase McDearmon's property until 1856 and then only  of it, which included the $2800 \"improvements.\"  The following year Tibbs's \"improvements\" had been reduced to $2000.\nTinsley–Scott Tenant House Ruin #1-West\nTinsley–Scott Tenant House Ruin #2-East\nColeman house ruin\nSweeney dam ruin and mill race\nFootnotes\nReferences\n* Bradford, Ned, Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, Plume, 1989\n* Catton, Bruce, A Stillness at Appomattox, Doubleday 1953, Library of Congress # 53-9982,\n* Catton, Bruce, This Hallowed Ground, Doubleday 1953, Library of Congress # 56-5960\n* Chaffin, Tom, 2006.
