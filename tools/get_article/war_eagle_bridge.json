It was built in 1907 and adjoins the War Eagle Mill.\nThe construction plans and drawings, contract, and correspondence are available at the Benton County Courthouse.\nHistory\nThe bridge occupies the site of a ford that has been used since the 1830s. Sylvanus Blackburn built a two-story log house near the west side and a mill on the east side of the ford in 1832. By the early twentieth century the mill was producing 40 barrels of flour per day, creating a need for better access to local markets.\nThe bridge was constructed in 1907 by the Illinois Steel Bridge Company of Jacksonville, Illinois, for a contracted amount of $4,790 (). It is the only Parker truss bridge in northwest Arkansas, and one of only seventeen steel truss bridges in the state. It has a span of , and an approach of  on the east side of the bridge. The stone range work pier and abutment on the eastern end and wooden planking for the bridge flooring were provided locally. The stone pier and abutment were replaced with a concrete structure in 1982.\nThe bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 19, 1985.\nSee also\n*List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Arkansas\n*List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Benton County, Arkansas\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* |isbn=0471143855}}\nExternal links\n*"
