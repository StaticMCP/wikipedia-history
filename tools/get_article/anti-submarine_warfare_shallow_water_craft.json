They were conceived as a replacement to the ageing s of the Indian Navy, and are designed to undertake ASW duties — including subsurface surveillance in littoral waters, search-and-attack unit (SAU) missions and coordinated anti-submarine warfare operations with naval aircraft. They were also designed to provide secondary duties – including defense against intruding aircraft, minelaying and search-and-rescue (SAR).\nEquipped with sophisticated sensors and ordnance, the vessels also possess the capabilities to interdict and destroy subsurface targets — primarily hostile submarines, within the vicinity of coastal waters. A total of 16 vessels are being built for the Indian Navy, jointly by CSL and GRSE under the Make in India initiative. The Indian Navy plans to have all 16 vessels in active service by 2026.\nHistory\nBackground\nIn December 2013, the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) –- the main acquisition panel subordinate to India's Ministry of Defence (MoD), approved the procurement of sixteen anti-submarine warfare (ASW) vessels capable of operating in shallow waters, at a cost of , to replace the ageing Abhay-class corvettes of the Indian Navy – which were commissioned between 1989 and 1991.\nIn June 2014, the MoD issued a tender, worth USD2.25 billion under the 'Buy and Make India' category to private-shipyards – including Larsen & Toubro (L&T), ABG Shipyard, Pipavav Defense and Offshore Engineering, Goa Shipyard (GSL) and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), for the procurement of the 16 anti-submarine vessels.\nIn October 2017, Cochin Shipyard (CSL) and Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) emerged as the first and the second-lowest bidder in the tender, respectively.\nPurchase\nOn 29 April 2019, the MoD and GRSE signed a contract valued at  for eight anti-submarine vessels, to be delivered between 2022 and 2026. The contract stipulated that the first vessel had to be delivered within 42 months of the date of signing, with the remaining seven vessels delivered at regular intervals.\nOn 30 April 2019, the MoD and CSL signed a similar contract, valued at  for the construction of the remaining eight vessels – within a deadline of 84 months. Under this contract, the first ship was also expected to be delivered within a span of 42 months, with subsequent deliveries of two ships per year.\nConstruction\nArnala-class\nGRSE formed a Public Private Partnership alliance with Larsen & Toubro involving its Kattupalli Shipyard to undertake the entire ASW SWC project along with the Survey Vessel (Large) Project.\nOn 31 December 2020, GRSE initiated the construction of the stipulated vessels under its agreement with the steel-cutting ceremony of the first of the eight vessels at the Kattupalli Shipyard, near Chennai.\nIn July 2021, GRSE initiated the construction of two more vessels under its contract, with their respective steel-cutting ceremonies, while the keel of the first vessels (which had begun construction in December, 2020) was laid on 6 August 2021.\nBy March 2025, the Contractor Sea Trials (CST) of  and INS Androth was completed by GRSE along with . As per a press release, \"CST is considered the final stage of construction, when a vessel’s seaworthiness is tested\". The release also stated that Arnala was to be delivered to the Navy soon.\nINS Arnala was delivered to the Indian Navy on 8 May 2025 at Kattupalli Shipyard. The ship, named after Arnala fort, was to commissioned on 18 June 2025. The ship has an indigenous content of over 88% with equipment from Bharat Electronics, Mahindra Defence, and Larsen & Toubro among others.\nThe last warship of the class, Ajay, was launched on 21 July 2025 by Priya Deshmukh, wife of Vice Admiral Kiran Deshmukh, Indian Navy's Chief of Materiel. The second ship of the class, Androth, was delivered on 13 September 2025, and commissioned on 6 October 2025 in Visakhapatnam.\nMahe-class\nOn 1 December 2020, CSL initiated the project's construction, with the steel-cutting of the first ASW-SWC vessel, Mahe (BY 523) at Kochi.\nCSL initiated the steel-cutting of the fourth and fifth vessels of the series, on 1 December 2021.\nThe deliveries of eight vessels by CSL is expected between August 2025 and June 2028.\nThe first ship of the class, Mahe, was delivered to the Indian Navy on 23 October 2025 and is scheduled to be commissioned on 24 November 2025 at the Naval Dockyard (Mumbai).\nDesign\nUnder the contract for the construction of the 16 vessels, the two shipyards contracted by the Indian Navy – Cochin Shipyard (CSL) and Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), will respectively build eight vessels of their own, respective designs.\nThe first eight vessels assigned to GRSE were designed entirely by GRSE's in-house design team, while the remaining eight vessels assigned to CSL were developed by a joint venture – consisting of CSL, Smart Engineering & Design Solutions (India) Ltd. (SEDS) and DA-Group subsidiary Surma Ltd. The entire special quality low-magnetic steel for eight of the Arnala-class ships of GRSE have been supplied by SAIL from its steel plants in Bokaro, Bhilai and Rourkela.\nGRSE received the Raksha Mantri Award 2022 for designing \"the most silent ship\" of the Indian Navy. The award for the INS Arnala ship and the subsequent Arnala-class light corvettes.\nThe ASW-SWC vessels are the biggest vessels of the Indian Navy to be powered by water-jet propulsion; the vessels' water-jet propulsion system allows the vessel to sprint swiftly for short intervals. The vessels are also reported to possess several features of stealth – including a reduced radar cross-section (RCS), a low acoustic signature and a low infrared signature.\nArmament\nThe ASW-SWC vessels are equipped with one RBU-6000 anti-submarine rocket launcher and two sets of light-weight torpedo-tube launchers for launching anti-submarine torpedoes, (presumably the Advanced Light Weight Torpedo (ALWT)), for neutralizing enemy submarines. The vessels are also equipped with mine rails, which enables the vessel to lay anti-submarine mines along the seabed.\nAside from its primary anti-submarine weaponry, the vessels are also equipped with one GRSE-developed Naval Surface Gun (NSG) 30 mm autocannon paired with a Electro Optical Fire Control System (EOFCS) and two 12.7&nbsp;mm M2 \"Stabilised Remote Controlled Gun\" remote-weapon stations (RWS), equipped with optronic control systems.\nSensors\nFor detecting and intercepting hostile submarines, the ASW-SWC vessels are equipped with sophisticated sonar equipment, including a hull-mounted sonar (HMS) and towed low-frequency variable-depth sonar (LFVDS). The LFVDS system is being procured from a partnership firm formed by Indian CFF Fluid Control Ltd. and German Atlas Elektronik. The system will be manufactured in India and supplied to GRSE and CSL, the firms engaged in construction of the ships. The hull-mounted sonar is the Abhay system an advanced active-cum-passive integrated sonar system designed and developed by NPOL, DRDO and manufactured by BEL.\nCapabilities\nBeing vessels primed for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), the ASW-SWC vessels were conceived to undertake multiple missions, including \"search-and-attack-unit\" (SAU) roles, low-intensity maritime operations (LIMO), subsurface surveillance in littoral-waters and coordinated ASW operations with maritime-patrol aircraft (MPA). In addition, the vessels also possess the capability subsurface surveillance and interdiction, within the vicinity coastal waters. The vessels can also be deployed for search-and-rescue (SAR) missions in littoral waters. The corvettes are meant for operations within  of the coastline.\nIn their secondary role, the vessels will be able to lay mines, to protect domains of crucial importance, such as naval bases and commercial ports, from enemy submarines.\nShips of the class\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!\n!\n!Builder\n!Laid down\n!Launched\n!Delivered\n!Commissioned\n!Homeport\n!Status\n|-\n!colspan=10|Arnala-class\n|-\n|\n| P68\n| 3029\n| rowspan=\"4\" |L&T\n| 6 August 2021\n| 20 December 2022\n| 8 May 2025\n| 18 June 2025\n|Visakhapatnam\n| Active\n|-\n|\n| P73\n| 3030\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 17 June 2022\n| 13 June 2023\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Launched\n|-\n| Amini\n| P75\n| 3031\n| 16 November 2023\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Abhay\n|\n| 3032\n|  13 June 2023\n| 25 October 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n| P36\n| 3033\n| rowspan=\"4\" |GRSE\n| 31 December 2022\n|13 March 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n| P34\n| 3034\n| 10 May 2024\n| 21 July 2025\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Androth\n| P69\n| 3035\n| 21 December 2021\n| 21 March 2023\n| 13 September 2025\n| 6 October 2025\n| Visakhapatnam\n| Active\n|-\n|\n|P35\n| 3036\n| 31 December 2022\n|13 March 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|Launched\n|-\n!colspan=10|Mahe-class\n|-\n|\n| P80\n| 523\n| rowspan=8 |CSL\n| 30 August 2022\n| rowspan=3| 30 November 2023\n| 23 October 2025\n|\n| Mumbai\n| Delivered\n|-\n| Malwan\n|P81\n| 524\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 21 February 2023\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Launched\n|-\n| Mangrol\n|P82\n| 525\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Malpe\n| P83\n| 526\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8 December 2023\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 9 September 2024\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Mulki\n| P84\n| 527\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Magdala\n|  P85\n| 528\n| 16 December 2024\n| 18 October 2025\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| Machilipatnam\n| P86\n| 529\n| 29 January 2025\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Under Construction\n|-\n|\n| P87\n| 530\n| 29 May 2025\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nGallery\nFile:INS Mulki and INS Malpe under construction at CSL.jpg|INS Mulki and INS Malpe launched\nFile:Arnala class ASW corvette during launch by GRSE.jpg|INS Arnala launch\nFile:INS Androth Launch.jpg|INS Androth launch\nFile:INS Androth.jpg|Androth during contractor trials.\nFile:INS Androth (P69) at sea.jpg|INS Andoth During sea trials\nFile:Launch ceremony of Anjadip, 3rd of eight ships of ASW Shallow Water Craft Project.jpg|INS Anjadip Launched\nFile:INS Mahe (P80) at sea.jpg|INS Mahe at sea\nSee also\n* Future  of the Indian Navy\n* List of active Indian Navy ships\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.grse.nic.in/eoi/EOI_ASW_SWC_R1.pdf Expression of Interest issued by GRSE for ASW-SWC]"
