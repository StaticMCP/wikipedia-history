It is a -story Federal style brick building with a side gable roof, end chimneys, and a five bay facade.  It was built between 1804 and 1817 by Isaac Grantham, and was probably used as a tenant farm in its early years.  After the American Civil War it was acquired by Henry S. McComb, a Civil War veteran who later was a cofounder of the Union Pacific Railroad.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in northern New Castle County, Delaware\nReferences"
