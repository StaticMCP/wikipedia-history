The team was established by co-founders Jonathan Abrametz and Cole Kachur in 2025 following the relocation of the Notre Dame Hounds from Wilcox, Saskatchewan, to Warman. The team was previously affiliated with Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox, before it was sold in 2025 and relocated to Warman. The franchise is notable for being the first SJHL team in the greater Saskatoon area since the Saskatoon Rage in the mid-1990s.\nHistory\nThe Warman Wolverines were formed after a group of Saskatoon-based investors, led by Jonathan Abrametz, purchased the Notre Dame Hounds franchise in March 2025. The relocation to Warman was announced on February 18, 2025, with the team set to begin play in the 2025–26 SJHL season, pending approval from the SJHL’s annual general meeting in June 2025. The move was driven by a desire to bring junior A hockey to Warman, a community known for its strong hockey culture.\nThe ownership group aimed to transition the team to a community-owned, non-profit model within 5 to 10 years, aligning with the SJHL’s predominant ownership structure. The owners have reportedly funded about $850,000 (CAD) for the 2025-26 season along with plenty of support from business sponsors and more being announced in the upcoming days.\nTeam identity\nThe name Wolverines was chosen to align with the team names of Warman High School. The team logo, a side profile of a wolverine, is similar, but not identical, to that of the school. The team colours are teal, red, dark blue and white. Red was chosen to honour the franchise's former identity as the Notre Dame Hounds, whose colours were red and white.\nOwnership and Management\nJonathan Abrametz\n(Co-Founder)\nJonathan Abrametz is a Canadian trial lawyer and sports executive based in Saskatoon. He is a co-founder of the Warman Wolverines SJHL franchise and serves as one of the team’s senior executives. Abrametz is the principal of The Barrister Group law firm and holds a Chartered Director designation. He has also trained at Gerry Spence’s Trial Lawyers College, which focuses on advanced courtroom advocacy.\nCole Kachur\n(Governor)\nCole Kachur is a Canadian financial adviser and sports executive from Saskatchewan. He is a co-founder of the Warman Wolverines junior ice hockey franchise in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL), which was granted league approval for its inaugural 2025–26 season. Kachur is the principal owner of Kachur Wealth Management Group, part of Wellington-Altus Private Wealth, where he has been recognised among the firm’s top under-40 advisers. According to local reporting, the Wolverines’ first-season operating budget was estimated at about $850,000 (CAD), a figure Kachur helped secure during the league’s expansion process. He has also been active in minor hockey coaching and is known in the region for community sponsorship, including the Kachur Wealth Community Arena in Clavet.\nTyler Helm\n(Investor)\nTyler Helm is a Canadian federal public servant, farmer and sports executive. He is one of the key investors of the Warman Wolverines of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. Helm was raised in Shellbrook, Saskatchewan, and combined work on his family farm with a career in the federal government before helping establish the Wolverines franchise. He has stated that his aim in creating the team is to build a junior-hockey culture rooted in community involvement and local pride.\nBrianna Bernst\n(Manager, Business Operations)\nBrianna Bernst is a Canadian sports administrator who became manager of business operations for the Warman Wolverines junior ice hockey team in 2025. She previously served as Promotions and Media Manager for the Kam River Fighting Walleye of the Superior International Junior Hockey League and holds a diploma in social work and a Bachelor of Commerce in marketing from Lakehead University.\nCassandra Olson\n(Business Operations Assistant)\nCassandra Olson is a Canadian academic and sports operations assistant with the Warman Wolverines. She is pursuing a PhD in sociology at the University of Saskatchewan and a Bachelor of Business Administration at the University of Fredericton, and has worked as a power-skating coach and in event operations with the University of Calgary Dinos.\nArena\nThe Wolverines will play their home games at the city-owned Warman Home Centre Communiplex (WHCC), which was built in 2011. The arena has capacity for 1,678 spectators, including 1,178 seated and 500 standing. A $15 million (CAD) expansion project began in February 2024, and was expected to be completed in the summer of 2025. The city also agreed to upgrade the score clock and other electronic audio-visual display boards in the arena.\nWarman Wolverines Roster\nThe following table lists players named to the Warman
