      "text": "# Empire of the Dead\n\nEmpire of the Dead, also known as 'George Romero's Empire of the Dead', is a limited series of comic books by Marvel Comics, that began publication in 2014.\nIt is written by George A. Romero, his second comic after \"The Death of Death\", a mini-series he wrote for the DC Comics anthology Toe Tags in 2004 and 2005. Empire features zombies similar to those in his Living Dead series of films. One way the series departs from his films is that vampires are also part of the story.\nPublication history\nThe series was announced in October 2013, as a 15-issue miniseries, split between three 5-issue acts. Act One launched in January 2014, with art by Alex Maleev, and ended in June 2014. Act Two, which featured art by Dalibor Talajic, began in September 2014 and ended in January 2015. The final act, Act Three, features art by Andrea Mutti and began in April 2015 and ended in August 2015.\nCollected editions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! Material collected\n! Released\n!
