Many real-world and theoretical problems may be modeled in this general framework. For example, the inputs can be design parameters of a motor while the output can be the power consumption.  Other inputs can be business choices with the output being obtained profit. or describing the configuration of a physical system with the output being its energy.\nAn optimization problem can be represented in the following way\n:Given: a function f : A \\to R from some set A to the real numbers\n:Search for: an element x0 in A such that f(x0) ≤ f(x) for all x in A (\"minimization\").\nTypically, A is some subset of the Euclidean space Rn, often specified by a set of constraints, equalities or inequalities that the members of A have to satisfy. Maximization can be reduced to minimization by multiplying the function by minus one.\nThe use of optimization software requires that the function f is defined in a suitable programming language and linked to the optimization software. The optimization software will deliver input values in A, the software module realizing f will deliver the computed value f(x). In this manner, a clear separation of concerns is obtained: different optimization software modules can be easily tested on the same function f, or a given optimization software can be used for different functions f.\nThe following tables provide a comparison of notable optimization software libraries, either specialized or general purpose libraries with significant optimization coverage.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 12em\"| Name\n!
