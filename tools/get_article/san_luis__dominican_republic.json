Later, the Catholic Church attributed the name to Saint Louis, King of France. 1895, the sugar mill passed to the Michelene family and remained so until the first years of the Trujillo era when it was transferred to The Royal Bank of Canada. By 1953, Trujillo bought the sugar mill. With the death of the dictator in 1961, all his enterprises and companies  became State property.\nIn 2004, San Luis was elevated to the category of Municipal District, made up of the sections San Isidro and El Naranjo and the villages of Cabreto and El Bonito.\nWith a population of around 70,000 inhabitants, San Luis currently has 18 neighbourhoods, 11 public and private educational centres, and a Community College. San Luis also is the seat of the Batalla de las Carreras Military Academy and of the Dominican Air Force.\nExternal links\n* [http://distritomunicipalsanluis.gob.do/ Website of the Junta municipal San Luis]\nReferences"
