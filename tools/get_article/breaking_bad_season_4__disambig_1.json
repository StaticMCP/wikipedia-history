Skyler fears the worst when she cannot contact Walt, while a paranoid Saul hires a personal bodyguard. Hank struggles with life at home after his injury, snapping at Marie and becoming more preoccupied with collecting and cataloging minerals. Gus arrives and, upon seeing Victor cooking, changes into a lab suit and slits Victor's throat with a box cutter. He then changes back to his work clothes and instructs Walt and Jesse to return to work. The following morning, Walt tells Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Police investigate Gale's apartment but overlook his lab notes.\n|LineColor = C58F10\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.97\n|ShortSummary = Walt illegally buys and begins carrying a snubnosed revolver to kill Gus, fearing that Gus will eliminate him first.

Jesse, in an attempt to distract himself from having murdered Gale, buys an elaborate stereo system and throws an ongoing party with Badger and Skinny Pete. Andrea visits Jesse and expresses concern for his behavior; Jesse, unable to face his emotions, instead hands her a large stack of cash for Brock's future. Marie struggles with Hank's deepening depression as he continues his physical therapy sessions at home. Skyler pushes forward with her plan to buy the car wash that used to employ Walt, but the resentful owner angrily refuses her offer. Believing Mike to be in as precarious a situation as he and Jesse, Walt follows Mike to a bar and asks to get him in a room with Gus so he can kill him. Instead of answering, Mike beats up Walt and leaves.\n|LineColor = C58F10\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.71\n|ShortSummary = Walt is furious about a motion-detecting surveillance camera installed in the lab. In a meeting with Saul, Skyler convinces Walt to buy the car wash, and she has Saul's con artist pretend to be an EPA representative who threatens to shut down the business over contaminants. Facing unjust pressure, the owner begrudgingly sells to Skyler, agreeing to an even lower price than her original offer. Jesse continues to open his house up for 24-hour, drug-fueled parties, deliberately throwing piles of money in the midst of the chaos. Frustrated with Hank's coldness at home, Marie renews her kleptomania by stealing items from various real-estate open houses. Marie is eventually caught by a real estate agent and taken into police custody; Hank pulls strings with a former colleague to get her out of being charged.

Walt is shocked to learn that Hank is investigating Gale's murder; Hank tells Walt that he believes Gale was the cook of the high-grade blue meth, and that Gale was Heisenberg. When asked by Hank to read about a chemical process written in Gale's lab notes, Walt notices a line from a Walt Whitman poem and a dedication: \"W. W. My Star, My Perfect Silence.\" Walt tells Hank that the \"W. W.\" refers to the poet. Jesse's increasing complacency leads to over seventy thousand dollars in cash being stolen from his house, but Mike quickly recovers it. Noticing Jesse's apathy about the loss and recovery, Mike reports to Gus that Jesse's lack of professionalism is a problem for the organization, and that they must intervene. The episode ends with Mike driving an expressionless Jesse to an unknown location.\n|LineColor = C58F10\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.75\n|ShortSummary = Mike assures Walt that Jesse is safe and he takes Jesse on multiple collections throughout New Mexico. During the last collection, a man appears with a shotgun, and Jesse thwarts the robbery attempt. Later, Gus and Mike discuss the day and it is revealed that the \"robbery\" was set up by Gus to improve Jesse's low self-esteem. Walt and Skyler officially purchase the car wash, after which Skyler asks Walt to move back into the house. During a family dinner, Hank reveals that he has given up on investigating Gale further, having found a sense of closure in the death of the man he believed to be Heisenberg. When Hank states that Gale was a genius, an intoxicated Walt lets his ego get the better of him, and tells Hank that he believes Gale most likely copied someone else's work and that Hank's \"genius\" is still at large. The following day, Hank dives back into the case with renewed vigor and discovers a Los Pollos Hermanos napkin amongst Gale's possessions.\n|LineColor = C58F10\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.67\n|ShortSummary = Following Walt's behavior at dinner the night before, Skyler grows worried that he is in danger and again pushes Walt to turn himself in. When Walt angrily lashes out and tells her that he is the one who is a danger to others, Skyler leaves with Holly. Walt tells Jesse that Gus is attempting to drive a wedge between him and Jesse, correctly suspecting that the robbery that Jesse thwarted was a set-up. That afternoon, Jesse is again taken from the lab to run a job with Mike; Walt pays three workers at the laundry facility to clean the lab, but when Gus finds out, he has them deported.

Walt gives into Walt Jr.'s pleas for a new car and buys him a Dodge Challenger.

Skyler, taken aback by the amount of money Walt makes, is unsure how she will launder all of it through the car wash successfully.

The investigators are satisfied, but Hank remains suspicious. Still believing Gus is a drug kingpin, Hank enlists Walt to plant an illegal tracking device on Gus' car; Walt sees Mike is present and shows Gus the device, but Gus calmly tells him to plant it.

Worried that she could be implicated as Ted's former bookkeeper, Skyler attends Ted's audit and pretends to be under-qualified and completely ignorant of standard accounting practices.

Skyler later ventures into the crawl space underneath her home, where she has been storing Walt's cash.

Ted signs the check, but then attempts to escape; he trips and hits his head, knocking himself out. Hoping to stop Hank's investigation into Gus, Walt deliberately gets Hank into a car accident, but Hank is undeterred. Walt realizes Jesse has been cooking without him, but Jesse is unmoved when Walt confronts him and begs him to stop. Gus takes Walt to the desert and fires him, informing him that Hank will be killed and that Walt's entire family will be murdered if he interferes.

Andrea calls Jesse to the hospital because her son, Brock, is in critical condition with a mysterious flu-like illness. Jesse finds the ricin vial missing and confronts Walt at the latter's barricaded home, suspecting he poisoned Brock.

Once Gus' death is confirmed, Walt rescues Jesse, and together they destroy the lab. Back at the hospital, Jesse tells Walt that Brock is recovering and that his illness was not caused by ricin, but rather toxic berries from a lily of the valley plant. Still, the two agree that Gus needed to be killed. Skyler calls Walt after seeing news about the nursing home explosion, and he declares to Skyler that he \"won\". The season ends with a shot of a potted lily of the valley plant in Walt's backyard, revealing that Walt had indeed poisoned Brock.\n|LineColor = C58F10\n}}\n}}\nProduction\nOn June 14, 2010, AMC announced that Breaking Bad was renewed for a fourth, 13-episode season. The writers began brainstorming and writing for the season in early July 2010. At the 2011 Television Critics Association press tour, it was announced production on the season would begin January 13, 2011. Filming ended in mid-June of that year. Although the writing staff knew the fourth season would focus on the feud between Walter White and Gus Fring, they did not plan the season before production began, but rather developed the story as the episodes progressed. This followed a pattern similar to that of the third season and differed distinctly from the second season, where the  season was planned in advance. Gilligan compared the fourth season to a \"13-episode chess game\" between Gus and Walt.\nOriginally, mini episodes of four minutes in length were to be produced before the premiere of the fourth season but these did not come to fruition. the actor, Bryan Cranston, commented that the season would debut in July 2011 in an interview with New York Magazine, he also said, regarding the premiere date, that \"It was a decision from AMC that they wanted to position us in July... They want to attract as many eyeballs as possible, away from the heavy competition of the September, November [or] January start.\"\nReception\nReviews\nThe fourth season of Breaking Bad received universal acclaim from critics, with 96 out of 100 on Metacritic.

Club's review of the finale summed it up as a \"fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn't mean anybody is home free. Nothing's ever easy on Breaking Bad.\" The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, \"What a season of television — truly something none of us could ever have expected, or claimed we deserved.\" Best-selling author Noah Charney called it \"the best show on television\" and compared it to great works of literature for its three-dimensional characters and combination of action, drama, and dark comedy.\nAwards and nominations\nThe fourth season received numerous awards and nominations, including 13 Primetime Emmy Award nominations.
