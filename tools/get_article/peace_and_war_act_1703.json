The Scots, already unhappy with the War of the Spanish Succession, were concerned that rule by Hanoverians would lead to unwelcome Scottish involvement in German and continental wars. Later the same parliament forced royal assent to the Act of Security 1704. The English parliament retaliated with the Alien Act 1705, removing Scottish trading privileges in England.\nThe conflict between the two parliaments was finally resolved by their merger under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707. The union made the Act anent Peace and War and the Act of Security void, and they were formally repealed in December 1707 by the Repeal of Certain Scotch Acts 1707 (6 Ann. c. 32).\nNotes\nReferences"
