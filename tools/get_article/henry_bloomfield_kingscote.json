He retired in 1900.\nCricket\nKingscote played cricket as a wicket-keeper for the Royal Artillery from 1864 to 1881, playing regularly for the RA and a number of times whilst stationed in India between 1882 and 1889. He played in 12 first-class cricket matches, spread throughout a career that lasted 11 years between 1867 and 1878. He represented Kent County Cricket Club in a single first-class match in 1867, MCC seven times, the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club once and Gloucestershire three times in 1877, restricted in his opportunities at the top level of cricket by his military service. He played non-first-class cricket for clubs such as MCC, I Zingari, Quidnuncs and appeared twice for Devon in 1880.\nLater life\nKingscote died at Westminster in August 1915 aged 72.\nFamily\nKingscote's cousin Arthur Kingscote and uncle Henry Kingscote also played first-class cricket. He married three times but none of the marriages produced children.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
