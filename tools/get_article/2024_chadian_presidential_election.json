Government forces subsequently laid siege to PSF headquarters, resulting in several deaths, including that of PSF leader Yaya Dillo Djérou, Déby's cousin who had announced his intention to run for president and was regarded as his main opponent, in what authorities said was a shootout. The attacks were condemned by the African Union, while French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian called for an impartial investigation into the incident.\nOn 12 April 2024, the United Chad party filed a complaint against the United Chad coalition of Mahamat Déby, accusing it of plagiarism.\nElectoral system\nThe President of Chad is elected for a five-year term using a two-round system, with an absolute majority required in the first round to prevent a second round of voting.\nCandidates\nThe Chadian electoral commission announced that it would release the official list of candidates approved by the Constitutional Council on 24 March 2024.\nNominated candidates\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n! colspan=\"3\"| Candidate's name, age,political party\n!

On election day, polls opened at 07:00 and closed at 17:00. Some 8.5 million people are eligible to cast their vote. Provisional results were released by 21 May, with final results on 5 June. Several civil society groups said that authorities rejected many of the 2,900 applications sent in by would-be observers. Several violent incidents during voting were reported by local journalists, leading to the deaths of at least two people in Abéché and Moundou, where a soldier was fatally stabbed by angry residents after he was reportedly caught stuffing ballot boxes in favor of Déby.\nFollowing the election, Succès Masra and his Les Transformateurs party said that he and his supporters had been subjected to threats, violence and arbitrary arrests, adding that has his residence had been placed under surveillance. Masra also accused the National Elections Management Agency of rigging the vote in favor of Mahamat Déby and urged voters to defend what he called their will expressed at the ballot box against massive electoral fraud. The Coalition of Moral Authorities for Mediation (CONAMM), an association that includes traditional rulers, clerics, former government ministers and youth and women leaders, also complained of massive fraud and intimidation during the election, including ballot-stuffing and ballot-snatching by government officials. The International Federation for Human Rights said that the election appeared \"neither credible, free nor democratic\", while the International Crisis Group also said that \"a number of problems in the run-up to the balloting cast doubt on its credibility\".\nResults\nOn 9 May, just before the release of provisional results, Masra claimed victory in a live broadcast on Facebook, calling on his supporters and security forces to oppose what he saw as an attempt to steal the election. Provisional results were released later that day, indicating a decisive victory for Déby, who garnered 61.3% of the vote, surpassing the required threshold of 50% to avoid a runoff. Masra only secured 18.53% of the vote. The results were announced two weeks earlier than scheduled. Former prime minister and third place finisher, Albert Pahimi Padacké, congratulated Déby on his victory. Gunfire was reported in N'Djamena following the release of the results, while celebrations were held by Déby supporters outside the Presidential Palace. At least ten people were killed in unrest that followed the announcement.\nOn 12 May Masra formally appealed to the Constitutional Council to have the election annulled, saying that Les Transformateurs had amassed evidence of electoral fraud. Prior to this, several of his supporters had been arrested on charges of forgery and using false documents to obtain access to vote counts. On 16 May, Déby's victory was confirmed by the Constitutional Council, which also rejected Masra's arguments.\n|votes4=59632\n|color4=#45A790\n|cand5=\n|party5=Party for Rally and Equity in Chad\n|votes5=46784\n|color5=#ffbd58\n|cand6=\n|party6=Chadian Socialist Action for Renewal\n|votes6=33765\n|color6=#09e708\n|cand7=\n|party7=Movement of Patriotic Chadians for the Republic\n|votes7=27848\n|cand8=\n|party8=\n|votes8=22328\n|color8=#24b102\n|cand9=\n|party9=Les Élites\n|votes9=15147\n|color9=#3069bf\n|cand10=\n|party10=A New Day\n|votes10=12738\n|color10=#f0d837\n|invalid=23463\n|electorate=8202207\n|source=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTxrIViqiYw Africa 24]\n}}\nAftermath\nOn 22 May, Succès Masra submitted his resignation as prime minister as well as that of the transitional government.
