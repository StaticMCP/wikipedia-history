The first elected president, Charles Kerruish, was elected in 1990 and held office until his retirement in 2000.\nThe presiding officer remains impartial but has, in the case of a tied vote in the Legislative Council on a division, has a casting vote. The President authorises the Order Paper for sittings, is responsible for controlling the procedure of Tynwald Court and for the authoritative interpretation of its Standing Orders. This is mostly mirrored in the office of the Speaker of the House of Keys.\nPrior to 1990, the post was held ex officio by the Lieutenant Governor. The office is now held jointly with the Presidency of the Legislative Council (Eaghtyrane y Choonseil Slattyssagh).\nAt ceremonial occasions, such as the annual Tynwald Day ceremony or the proclamation of a new Lord of Mann, the President wears a full-bottomed wig and a blue damask cloak decorated with silver thread and Manx motifs. This cloak was designed by Charles Kerruish and draws inspiration from the carpet of the Tynwald Chamber. For other occasions, such as presiding over Tynwald during sittings for normal business, the Presidential dress code is the full-bottomed wig and a black cloak, akin to that worn by the Speaker of the House of Keys during sittings of the House.\nList of presidents of Tynwald\n*ex officio the Lieutenant Governor, until 1990\n*Charles Kerruish, 1990–2000\n*Noel Quayle Cringle, 2000–2011\n*Clare Christian, 2011–2016\n*Stephen Rodan, 2016–2021\n*Laurence Skelly, from 2021\nKerruish, Cringle and Rodan had all served as Speaker of the House of Keys before assuming the Presidency.\nChristian is Kerruish's daughter.\nDeputy presidents of Tynwald\nThe Deputy President is generally the same as the Speaker of the House of Keys; consequently, the current Deputy President is Juan Watterson.\nReferences"
