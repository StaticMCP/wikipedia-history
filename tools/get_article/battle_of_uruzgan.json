The last battle occurred in Daikundi Province of Afghanistan, which was historically part of the larger Uruzgan Province until 2004.\nAftermath\nIt is claimed that a massive forced displacement happened, especially in Uruzgan and Dey Chopan District of Ghazni Province. Out of 132,000 Hazara families, about 10,000 to 15,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, Mashad in Iran and Quetta in Pakistan, and 7,000 to 10,000 submitted to Abdur Rahman Khan, and the rest fought until they were defeated.\nSee also\n*Persecution of Hazaras\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.hazarainternational.com/2021/09/23/hazara-genocide-memorial/  Hazara Genocide Memorial]"
