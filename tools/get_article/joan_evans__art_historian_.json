Her notable collection was bequeathed to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\nEarly life and education\nJoan Evans was born at Nash Mills, Apsley, Hertfordshire, the daughter of antiquarian and businessman Sir John Evans and classical scholar, archaeologist, and specialist on Greek dress Maria Millington Lathbury (1856–1944). She was half-sister to Sir Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos and discoverer of Minoan civilisation. Sir Arthur was forty-two years her senior: he caused huge hilarity at an antiquarian conference of learned and erudite gentlemen when he brought in a four-year-old Joan to be \"shown off\".\nHer parents travelled extensively leaving Joan to be cared for by her nanny, Caroline Hancock, whom she knew for 67 years, although, occasionally, she did travel with her nanny to join her parents on their archaeological trips. She dedicated her autobiography, Prelude and Fugue, to Nanny Hancock who died in 1961, aged 97.\nEvans was educated at Corran School, Watford, and Berkhamsted School for Girls before going up to St Hugh's College, Oxford. She had originally planned to read for a diploma in anthropology but instead read classical archaeology, gaining a diploma with distinction in 1916. She was appointed librarian at St Hugh's College in 1917 and researched and wrote a thesis on jewellery for her Certificate of Letters in 1919.\nThis was at a time when women were still not admitted to read for degrees by the University of Oxford so she did not receive her full degree, Bachelor of Letters (B.Litt.), until 1920 after campaigners, including her mother, successfully had the ruling changed. In 1930 she was awarded a D.Litt. by the University of London and, in 1932, an honorary D.Litt. by the University of Oxford.\nScholarship\nThe Royal Institution of Great Britain's records suggest that Evans was the first woman to give a Friday Evening Discourse at the Institution: this was on 8 June 1923, the title being \"Jewels of the Renaissance\".\nAfter publishing her first books on jewellery in the 1920s, English Jewellery from the Fifth Century A.D. to 1800 and Magical Jewels of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, particularly in England, Evans published widely on a variety of subjects including the art and architecture of France. In 1950, Evans's book Cluniac Art of the Romanesque Period, which concerned art and sculptures made by the monks of the abbey at Cluny in eastern France, was published by Cambridge University Press; her book on The Romanesque Architecture of the Order of Cluny having been published in 1938.\nA Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, she published the society's official history in 1956, and served as its first woman president from 1959 to 1964.\nOther\nEvans travelled from a young age, a trip with her mother to Rome when she was 21 led to her decision to study archaeology rather than anthropology, and she developed a lifelong love for France. She visited France both for research and for pleasure and in 1947 she purchased the Romanesque Chapel of the Monks in Berzé-la-Ville, donating it to the Académie de Mâcon.\nA collector of art and artefacts, particularly pre-revolutionary French jewellery, she was a generous benefactor, not only did she donate her entire collection of more than 800 jewels, ranging in date from the Middle Ages to the early nineteenth century, to the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1975 but also a large collection of posy rings and other artefacts to the British Museum. Her will left collections to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Birmingham City Art Gallery.\nShe was also a major benefactor of St Hugh's College, and assisted in the purchase of the ridge above her home at Wotton-under-Edge for the National Trust. She gave her time and money to various causes, often anonymously, and, despite being described as \"one of the most distinguished and influential figures of the century in art and antiquarian scholarship\" at her Memorial Service at St Hugh's College in 1977, she was made Dame Commander of the British Empire in the New Year's Honours List of 1976, not for her pioneering work in the arts, but for charitable services.\nEvans had an association with The Courtauld Institute of Art; she was made an honorary librarian in 1931 and, when T. S. R. Boase left the Courtauld in 1947, she taught there for a year, with one of her students being Pamela Tudor-Craig. As well as writing biographies of her brother Sir Arthur Evans and John Ruskin, amongst others, she also published the book, The Conways: a History of Three Generations, about the family that included the art historian Martin Conway whose collection of photographs formed the basis for the Conway Library at the Courtauld. Photographs taken in France by Joan Evans are included in the archive of the Conway Library currently being digitised under the wider Courtauld Connects project.\nSelection of honours and public work\nIn addition to becoming the first female president of the Society of Antiquaries, and awarded the society's Gold Medal in 1973, she was also president of the Royal Archaeological Institute from 1948 to 1951 and of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society.\nEvans served as a member of the V&A's Advisory Council from 1953 to 1966 and as a trustee of the British Museum (1963–1967).\nShe was made an Honorary Fellow of St. Hugh's College, Oxford; an honorary doctor of letters from Cambridge; and awarded the honour ''Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur as well as fellowships from the Royal Historical Society and the Royal Society of Literature.\nPersonal life\nEvans bought Thousand Acres, Wotton-under-Edge, in 1939 and lived there, dividing her time between Gloucestershire and her London apartment, until her death in 1977 at the age of 84. She was unmarried.\nPublications\n* English Jewellery from the Fifth Century A.D. to 1800, London, Methuen, 1921\n* Magical Jewels of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, particularly in England, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1922\n* Anglo Norman Lapidaries, 1924\n* Life in Mediaeval France, Oxford University Press, 1925 (Also in French: Civilisation en France au Moyen Age and in Dutch: Leven in de Middeleeuwen).\n* St Joan of Orleans: scenes from the 15th century \"Mystére de Siége d'Orleans\", by Peter Studer, selected and translated by Joan Evans, Clarendon Press, 1926\n* The Unconquered Knight: a chronicle of the deeds of Don Pero Nino, Count of Buelna, by his standard bearer, Diaz de Gamez, Translated and selected from El Vitorial by Joan Evans, Routledge, 1928\n* Pattern, a Study of Ornament in Western Europe from 1180 to 1900, 2 vols, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1931\n* Monastic Life at Cluny, 1931; Archon Books, USA, 1968\n* English Posies and Posy Rings: catalogue with introduction by Joan Evans, Oxford University Press, 1931\n* English Mediaeval Lapidaries, 1933, by Joan Evans and Mary S.
