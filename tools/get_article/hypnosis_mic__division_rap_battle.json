The project features eighteen voice actors and is centered on rap battles, with fans voting for their preferred team. The CDs have ranked high on mainstream music charts and the franchise has grown to include manga adaptations, stageplay adaptions, a mobile game, and an anime.\nPlot\nAfter war, women have taken over ruling politics in the Chuo ward and have banned and destroyed weapons. This has caused men to fight through rap battles using Hypnosis Mics, which can be used to affect people's sympathetic nerves and influence their thought process. However, the legendary rap group, The Dirty Dawg, has split up into four groups, each representing a division of Tokyo, Japan and engaging in territorial battles using words and the Hypnosis Mics.\nDiscography\nBeginning in 2017, each group released an introductory single. In April 2018, the first Battle Season began, and each first press edition of the rap battle albums came with a voting card. Mad Trigger Crew and Matenro were the finalists. Matenro won the battle held in December 2018 and released a celebratory album titled The Champion, produced by Zeebra.\nIn 2019, Bad Ass Temple debuted with the album Bad Ass Temple Funky Sounds, which was produced by Nobodyknows. The song \"Sōgyaran Bam\" was written by Diggy-Mo.\nLives\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=font-size:small\n|+\n|-\n! Event Date !! Title !! Subtitle !! Venue !! Performers !! Guest !!
