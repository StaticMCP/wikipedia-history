The tour was a promotion for his debut solo album, Formula, Vol. 1. On December 13, 2011, Santos announced that he would begin his initial leg of his solo tour on February 11, 2012, in the United States and ended on July 20, 2013, in Lima, Peru.\nMadison Square Garden\nHis first concert began with three consecutive shows at Madison Square Garden which all three became sold-out. During the concert at Madison Square Garden, Santos was accompanied by fellow bachata singer Prince Royce. For \"Debate de 4\", he had bachata musicians Luis Vargas and Antony Santos for one of the nights while the other nights had three men from the audience who were randomly selected to join Romeo Santos on the stage to sing the song. Raulín Rodríguez is also featured in the song but was not in any of the concerts. Usher made an appearance on the encore for the song \"Promise\" in which he is featured in. At the final concert in the Madison Square Garden, Santos was joined by American rapper P. Diddy for the song \"Mi Corazoncito\". The concerts at Madison Square Garden were recorded and later released as a live album and film titled The King Stays King: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden on November 6, 2012.\nThe US tour\nFollowing the concerts at Madison Square Garden, Santos continued his tour in Florida where he performed at the American Airlines Arena in Miami on March 1, 2012, and at the Amway Center in Orlando the following day.
