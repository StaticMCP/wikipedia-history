They only played one ABL season.\nHistory\nThe team was originally known as Mindanao Aguilas. After Manny Pacquiao became one of the team's owners, the name was changed to the Pacquiao Powervit Pilipinas Aguilas.\nIn October 2015, the Pilipinas Legends Group became a co-owner of the team and took over the team's management. The following month, the team was acquired by SportsLegends Managers Inc. and renamed to the Pilipinas MX3 Kings through a sponsorship arrangement with the DMI Medical Supply Co., Inc. The team was renamed after the withdrawal of Pacquiao, thus making the Pilipinas Legends/SportsLegends Group of Dick Balajadia the new majority owner. Jean Michael Alabanza was appointed as the new team manager and Chito Loyzaga as the team consultant. The team's home venue was the San Juan Gymnasium.\nIn December 2015, as part of the team overhaul, Sunday Salvacion, Jondan Salvador, Chad Alonzo, Emmerson Oreta, Adrian Celada and import Charles Mammie were released. Team manager Jean Michael Alabanza also announced that there will be a new world import. It was later announced that Jason Deutchman will be joining the team as one of its local players.\nThe team ended the 2016 ABL season in last place with a record of 2 wins and 18 losses, the worst by a Filipino team in the league's history.\nHome arenas\n* USEP Gymnasium (2015 – played only one game there vs. Mono Vampire Basketball Club)\n* San Juan Gym (2015–2016)\n* Malolos Convention Center (2016)\nFinal roster\n|assistant_coach =\n*\n|team_man =\n*\n|marketing =\n*\n| I = y\n| roster_url =\n| accessdate =\n}}\nNotable players\n*  Arizona Reid\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
