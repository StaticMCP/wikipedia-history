The official bounds of each Pacific hurricane season are dates that conventionally delimit the period each year during which tropical cyclones tend to form in the basin according to the National Hurricane Center, beginning on May&nbsp;15 in the Eastern Pacific proper (east of 140°W) and on June&nbsp;1 in the Central Pacific (140°W to the International Date Line), and ending on November&nbsp;30 in both areas. Activity in the 1994 season was considerably greater than average, particularly in the Central Pacific; tropical cyclones generally formed and intensified farther west than normal due in part to above-average sea surface temperatures over the southeastern portion of the Central Pacific and the prevalence of a large anticyclone near 140°W for much of July and August. El Niño conditions, which tend to cause increased tropical cyclone activity over the Pacific Ocean, were also present. Despite the high activity, the season had an unusually late start; it did not commence until the formation of Tropical Storm Aletta on June&nbsp;18. The season ended on October&nbsp;26 with the dissipation of Tropical Storm Nona.\nA total of twenty-two&nbsp;tropical depressions formed, with all but two strengthening into named tropical storms; ten became hurricanes, of which five became major hurricanes (Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson scale). Three hurricanesEmilia, Gilma, and Johnreached Category&nbsp;5 intensity, the highest rating on the scale. This set a record for most Category&nbsp;5 hurricanes in one season since records began in 1971, which would later be tied in 2002 and 2018. Hurricane John traversed the Pacific Ocean for 8,190&nbsp;miles (13,180&nbsp;km), making it the farthest-traveling tropical cyclone on record worldwide. Lasting for thirty&nbsp;days, the Eastern and Central Pacific hurricane database (HURDAT) lists 121 data points at six-hour intervals for John, including one for the storm's extratropical transition, for a total of 30&nbsp;days as a tropical cyclone.|group=\"nb\"}} John was also the longest-lived tropical cyclone on record globally until Cyclone Freddy, which spent at least thirty-four&nbsp;days as a tropical cyclone in February and March&nbsp;2023. The storms of the 1994 season collectively generated an Accumulated Cyclone Energy index of 185.2&nbsp;units, which is the eleventh-highest on record for a Pacific hurricane season as of March&nbsp;2024.|group=\"nb\"}}\nOnly one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Rosa in October, caused fatalities or made landfall during the 1994 season. It struck the Mexican state of Sinaloa at Category&nbsp;2 strength, killing five&nbsp;people in the country. Proceeding rapidly northeastward across Mexico and into the United States after landfall, the storm and its remnants caused disastrous flooding in southeastern Texas that claimed more than twenty&nbsp;lives and wrought at least $700&nbsp;million (1994&nbsp;USD) in damage. Earlier in the season, Tropical Depression  and Hurricane John caused minor impacts in the Central Pacific. Heavy rainfall from  generated substantial flooding on the Big Island of Hawaii, resulting in damages estimated at up to $5&nbsp;million (1994&nbsp;USD). After weakening greatly from its peak intensity, John passed about 15&nbsp;mi (30&nbsp;km) to the north of Johnston Atoll as a strong Category&nbsp;1 hurricane; high winds caused $15&nbsp;million (1994&nbsp;USD) in damage.\nPrior to 2015, two time zones were utilized in the Eastern Pacific basin: Pacific east of 140°W, and Hawaii−Aleutian from 140°W to the International Date Line. For convenience, each event is listed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) first, using the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC), with the respective local time included in parentheses. Figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest five&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers) and averaged over one&nbsp;minute, following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury. This timeline documents the formation of tropical cyclones as well as the strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It also includes information that was not released while the storm was active, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center is included.\nTimeline of events\nMay\nMay 15\n*The 1994 Eastern Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\n*No tropical cyclones formed in May.\nJune\nJune 1\n*The 1994 Central Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\nJune 18\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;17) at The first tropical depression of the season develops from a tropical wave over the open waters of the Eastern Pacific Ocean.\nJune 19\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;18) at The aforementioned tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Aletta.\nJune 20\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;19) at Tropical Storm Aletta reaches peak winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h).\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Tropical Storm Aletta reaches a minimum barometric pressure of .\nJune 21\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Tropical Storm Aletta weakens into a tropical depression.\nJune 23\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;22) at Tropical Depression Aletta dissipates about 1,035&nbsp;mi (1,670&nbsp;km) east of the Big Island of Hawaii.\nJune 27\nlate on June&nbsp;27|alt=A satellite image of a tropical storm over the Eastern Pacific Ocean]]\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;26) at A tropical depression develops from a tropical wave about 575&nbsp;mi (925&nbsp;km) south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at The aforementioned tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Bud about 540&nbsp;mi (870&nbsp;km) south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.\nJune 28\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;27) at Tropical Storm Bud reaches peak winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h) about 560&nbsp;mi (900&nbsp;km) south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;27) at Tropical Storm Bud reaches a minimum barometric pressure of  about 580&nbsp;mi (935&nbsp;km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at A tropical depression develops from a tropical wave about 830&nbsp;mi (1,335&nbsp;km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Tropical Storm Bud weakens into a tropical depression about 670&nbsp;mi (1,075&nbsp;km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.\nJune 29\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT, June&nbsp;28) at The aforementioned tropical depression strengthens into Tropical Storm Carlotta about 700&nbsp;mi (1,130&nbsp;km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT) at Tropical Depression Bud is last noted about 915&nbsp;mi (1,475&nbsp;km) west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula;
