Many were converted into municipal airports, some were returned to agriculture and several were retained as United States Air Force installations and were front-line bases during the Cold War. Hundreds of the temporary buildings that were used survive today, and are being used for other purposes.\nMajor airfields\nFirst Air Force, later Third Air Force\n* Chatham Army Air Field,  west-northwest of Savannah\n: 425th Base Headquarters & Air Base Squadron:  22 January 194310 April 1944\n: 114th Army Air Force Base Unit (First AF):  10 April 194428 March 1945\n: 323rd Army Air Force Base Unit (Third AF):  1 May 19458 Jun 1947\n: Also used by:  Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (1942–1943)\n: Transferred to:  Third Air Force (1945)\n: Was: Chatham Air Force Base (1947–1950)\n: Now: Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport\n: And  Savannah Air National Guard Base\n: And  Georgia ANG Combat Readiness Training Center\n* Harris Neck Army Airfield,  south-southwest of Savannah\n: Sub-base of: Dale Mabry Field, Florida\n: 346th Army Air Force Base Unit (Third AF):  1 May 19441945\n: Transferred to: United States Navy (1945)\n: Now: Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge\nThird Air Force\n* Statesboro Army Airfield,  northeast of Statesboro\n: Sub-base of: Morris Field.
