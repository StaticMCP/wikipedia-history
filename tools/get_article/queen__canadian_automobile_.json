The car was a 4-seater runabout powered by an 823cc single-cylinder engine mounted under the front seat.\nThe clutch and gearbox were so rough that passengers were sometimes thrown out.  In 1903 company president Cornelius Ryerson gave up on the car and purchased a Cadillac.\nReferences\nSee also\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/blondygirl/5891236991/ Photo of only surviving Queen automobile]"
