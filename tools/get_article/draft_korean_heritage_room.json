The Korean room reflects traditional Korean architectural styles during the Joseon dynasty. Dedicated on November 15, 2015, it is the 30th room to be constructed for the university's Nationality Room Project.\nThe design concept was inspired by the “ Hall of Enlightenment”, a lecture hall in Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea. The Sungkyunkwan University that inspired the Korean room traces its origins from a royal academy of the same name, which served as a prestigious symbol of education for nearly two centuries. The Korean Room was produced primarily in Korea, and then disassembled and shipped to be recreated in the Cathedral of Learning. The room features wooden latticework, intricate ceilings, and traditional floor mats. Similarly to the lecture hall it’s inspired by, the room is composed of three connected smaller rooms.\nHistory\nThe first mentions and correspondence about the creation of a Korean Nationality Room was between a Hyun Seung Lee and a Dr Oh Suck Hong in 1977. From there momentum to create the Korean Nationality Room was gained by publicity and networking with people from Korea and Pitt and the Pittsburgh Korean community. By 1990 the Korea-American Relations panel  and the 1997 Korea Caravan posed the question of why there isn't a Korean Nationality room to the public. Leading out of the early 2000’s serious progress has been made and plans had been drawn up along with significant progress with donations.\nPlanning\nConsidering the scope and the project, the University hired a diverse team to lead the creation of the Korean Heritage Room. The project was spearheaded with the approval of Maxine Bruhns, who served as the director of Nationality Rooms for over 50 years. Dr. Katheryn Linduff, a professor specializing in the history of art and architecture, served as the project director, overseeing the creation of the room. Susan Langer served as the financial officer of the initiative.\nAside from the University, much of the Korean Heritage Room’s contributions came from external groups. In July of 2007, Kwan Lee, a Pittsburgh anesthesiologist formed a Korean Heritage Room Committee, reaching around 400 Korean Households and five Korean churches in attempts to fundraise for the room. Throughout September of that year, Lee exchanged emails with university Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg, expressing the serious interest shown among the Korean community. By 2011, the Korean Heritage Committee had been fleshed out, with David Kim and Sang C. Park assigned Co-Chairs, Hong Koo Kim as Executive Vice-chair, Sangyeun Cho as treasurer, and Pola Rhee as secretary.\nThe team soon expanded beyond Pittsburgh, as a project group was formed in Korea. A bulk of the design team was based in Korea, organized and supervised by the Arumjigi Culture Keepers Foundation. Young Suk Jang, CEO of the Korean Culture Keepers, was assigned the chief officer of this team. There were multiple back-and-forth visits between the two teams. In one instance, Korean artisans visited Pittsburgh for around six weeks to assist with the room’s creation, with accommodations paid for by the University.\nFunding and Donors\nIn 2014, the total cost of the room was estimated to be $693,750 meanwhile the funding/budget available was $556,000 with a deficit of $137,750. The following month, the Planning, Design, and Construction Facilities Management managed to decrease the cost of the room to $649,550. In March, the NHR for Korea requested funds for additional funding of about $50,000 from the Korea Foundation (KF) Washington DC office. Chancellor Mark A. Nordenberg was set to meet up with the director of the foundation on March 20th, 2014, to ask for additional support and show her some rooms before she departed from her visit to Pittsburgh. The Korean Nationality Room Committee acknowledged that the biggest donor to the construction of the room was the Korean Foundation located in Washington D.C which contributed $200,000. The committee had also planned to ask the KF in Seoul directly for extra funds when the (then) new director of the foundation, Ms. Keum-Jin Yoon came to determine if it was necessary.\nBy June, the requested $50,000 by the committee was approved. Plans for the construction of the room and logistics were discussed by the room committee chair, Dr. Sang Park. Here, he explained how all materials for the construction of the room must come from Korea. This meant that Korean craftsmen had to fly over to Pittsburgh to work with the local contractors to build the room. Meaning that a higher expense was to be considered, putting them under financial constraints.\nStarting in 2007, the creation of the Korean Heritage Room took off when Dr. Kwan Lee donated $5,000 to a University account for the creation of the Korean Heritage Room under the Korean Nationality Room Committee’s name. Anesthesiologist Dr. Kwan Lee created the Korean Heritage Room Committee (KHRC) to run the Korean Heritage Room project. With the committee, he planned to raise about $450,000 which would come from the contributions of local Korean households and churches.\nOne of the main proposers of the project, Dr. Sungwha Oh, had played a key part in establishing the Korean Endowment at the University Center for International Studies, which amounted to $150,000. Given this information, the Director of the Nationality Rooms, Maxine Bruhns, did not doubt that Dr. Oh would be able to raise the $450,000 needed for the creation of the room due to her (Dr. Oh's) connection “with high-ranking Korean Officials and wealthy citizens.” It is also important to note that the original amount planned to fundraise was between $400, 000 and $450,000 and that the target date to begin construction would be on Korea’s Independence Day, August 15, 2010. .\nWhile creating a grant proposal for the Korean Foundation in 2008, A form explaining how the Nationality Room Program works, which was last revised in June 2001, explained that donors are recognized for their contribution by having their names listed in a donor book. Also stated in the document is that donations will only be spent on the project and, as a result, are tax-deductible. Furthermore, “remaining contributed funds will be used for study abroad scholarships”, meaning that funds were listed to be used on anything of the KHR  in any form. Some organizations were contacted and offered to fund some artifacts for the Korean Heritage Room. The Korean consulate in New York had also collected funds for the project. Dr. Junghhwa Oh suggested that the names of the foundations and amounts can go under the “other funding source”. They expected to have about $50,000 to about $100,000 from the local Korean community and alumni who would contribute to this effort.\nIn 2009, there was interest to donate for the creation of the room. The university began purchasing items of cultural significance to be added to the room before construction went into process. After purchasing catalogs, Kang Seong,  President of the Cultural Foundation of the National Museum of Korea, thanked the University for advertising Korea in the nationality rooms. As a token of gratitude, the foundation sent them calendars. As part of two of the primary donors and contributors of the project, that February, the Cultural Foundation of the National Museum of Korea decided to provide $200,000 in funds for the construction of the Korean Nationality Room in three installments over three years. However, they highlighted that terms and conditions had to be discussed before moving any further and that they were happy to contribute to the university's commitment to promoting Korean art and culture. Dr. Kwan Lee, who is part of the Korean Heritage Room committee had visited the Korean Times, a newspaper organization located in Washington D.C, to post a narrative on the construction of the room in Pittsburgh. In the note, the committee asked the Korean community in Washington, D.C. if they could help contribute some funds for construction. They state how the population of 2,000 Pittsburgh Korean community members was already able to raise $34,000 (at that time) and that more contributions would be needed since the population of the community was not too large. Additionally, The Korean Heritage Room Committee had planned to ask Arumjigi if they could contribute some monetary aid to the additional $3,400 (5,000,000 won) for designing efforts of the room.\nIn 2010, Dr. Kwan Lee assured the director for international advancement Elise Moersch, that people in Korea would most likely be donated to Arumijigi as it “is well-known in Korea for their record, so that it will be much easier to get donations from individuals and corporations”. Fundraising for the construction of the room was set to be done in 2011. Money raised in Korea for Arumijigi would be deposited in an account that went to them directly. As for the money from the Korean Foundation, that would be deposited into the Heritage Room’s account. Donations for the project have been collected since the year 2007. Many of the donors include local businesses as well as Korean-based organizations. Some of the most notable donors in Oishi Bento, Pittsburgh Korean school (who made multiple donations), and the John and Frances Beck family Foundation (also known as the Pittsburgh Foundation). Fellow Doctor, Kang Young-Woo, donated in a meeting with Chancellor Nordenberg, $8,000 for the Korean Heritage Room. Fundraising activities held by the committee were made possible thanks to the time and resources people have donated to these efforts. As noted by the committee, “The committee members donated the incurred cost for traveling to Korea for the KHR project purpose.” A total of $30,273.85 in goods and services had been donated.  Some of the fundraising activities noted between the years 2007-2009 include the NOW Dance performance, the Korean Association New Year Party, the Korean festival, and a total of travel, lodging, food, etc. that amounted to $30,267.85. A total of $82,935.67 had been raised in donations by the year 2010.\nConstruction\nWhen the Korean Heritage Room Committee was formed in 2007, they had hoped to raise at least $200,000 before the proposed initiation date, July 4th, 2007. The Korean Heritage Room was intended to be dedicated on August 15th, 2010, on the 65th National Liberation Day of Korea. However, the construction of the room was delayed several times. Following the initial grant proposal in July of 2007, the Korean Heritage Room Committee was informed that the construction of a Korean Heritage Room would be unlikely as there were no more [nationality] rooms available. Despite this, following many communications between those heading the committee and Mark A. Nordenburg, the Chancellor of The University of Pittsburgh at the time, the KHRC was given the green light to move forward with their project by November of 2007. They were assigned room 304 of the Cathedral of Learning, with a building space of 89.35 square meters. However, they would experience a series of delays. Following the initial KHR grant proposal in 2008, the proposed initiation date was moved back several times due to fundraising issues. The KHRC had planned to complete fundraising efforts by March of 2013 and intended to engage in construction from May of 2013 to December 31, 2013.\nThe construction of the room was not completed until the fall of 2015, following even more delays such as when $15,750 worth of wood, a key element to the rooms architecture, arrived waterlogged and had to be burned down (Miltko 2015, #1). The Korean Heritage room was finally dedicated on November 15, 2015.\nDedication Ceremony\nThere were two main dedication ceremonies, as well as a smaller banquet celebration that happened on November 15, 2015, dedicating the opening of the Korean Nationality Room. The ceremony was a general tour and exhibition of the Korean Nationality Room for the public along with many of those involved with the project to give remarks and speeches. During the ceremony, all of the other nationality rooms were open to the public.\nDesign\nThe architectural style of the Korean Heritage Room was inspired by a historical Korean Seowon (also “Sowon”), a representative educational institution and the spiritual center of local communities during the Joseon era (1392-1910) in Korea. The Joseon era was a period of advancement, enlightenment, and cultural enrichment, which is why the original architects of the room thought basing the room’s construction off of Seowon was the perfect way to celebrate and showcase 4350 years of Korean history through the incorporation of historical, religious, and cultural symbols in its design. (needs citations, more information about construction and meaning)\nIn 2009, the director of the Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Program, Maxime E. Bruhns, thanked CEO Young Suk Jang for offering to design the nationality room. The director of the nationality rooms remarked “We shall be very pleased to have Culture Keepers join the Korean Heritage Room Committee and the Nationality Rooms Program as we explore the most effective and authentic design which will display the proud culture of Korea for generations to come.” This correspondence between Mr. Jang and Director Bruhns about the Culture Keepers Foundation being interested in planning and developing the concept and design of the classroom outlined how the room had to look like it belonged to a time before 1787; which is when the University of Pittsburgh was founded. Furthermore, the director explains that the nationality rooms were funded by local ethnic communities and created by people from these places. Overall, it is emphasized that not only students, faculty, and staff benefit from the rooms but that the public also learns through these rooms through events tied to the history and culture of each room; she aims to add the Korean room as part of the group of nationality rooms.\nSignificance\nContributors to the Korean Nationality Room, David Kim, Sang C. Park, and Hong Koo Kim, state that originally, the ideas of the creation of the room stemmed from the desire to diversify their representation of Asian culture at The University of Pittsburgh. The Korean Nationality Room was created with a strong sense of purpose by the many contributors and donors with the intention to honor and respect the beauty of Korean culture. According to the Korean National Room Project Update created in 2013, “the creation of the nationality room within the Cathedral of Learning provides a permanent landmark of the complex Korean heritage and legacy.” The renovated room will help reflect the thousands of years of history to students as well as visitors to the Cathedral of Learning to provide the opportunity to learn about their history. The contributors continue to state that “the Korean Nationality room will also provide a way for future generations of students living or visiting Pittsburgh to enjoy the room and learn about the culture.” The contributors also believed this would help the Korean students feel a sense of belonging and appreciation. Ultimately, the committee working on this project felt strongly that they had one opportunity to make this happen and they wanted to do it right.\nReferences\n6.
