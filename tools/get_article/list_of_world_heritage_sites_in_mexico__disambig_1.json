Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Mexico accepted the convention on 23 February 1984, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. Mexico has 36 sites on the list (the highest number of sites per country in the Americas) and a further 23 tentative sites.\nMexico's first six sites were inscribed on the list at the 11th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France in 1987. The most recent inscription was the Wixárika Route through Sacred Sites to Wirikuta, listed in 2025. There are 28 cultural, six natural, and two sites listed both for their cultural and natural significance. The Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California site has been listed as endangered because of the imminent extinction of the vaquita, an endemic porpoise in the gulf.\n}}\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (state)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Sian Ka'an\n|\n| Quintana Roo\n| 1987\n| 410; vii, x (natural)\n| The biosphere reserve covers around  of the coast of the Yucatán Peninsula, protecting both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.
