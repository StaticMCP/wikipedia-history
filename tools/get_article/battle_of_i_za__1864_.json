A party of 830 Polish rebels, commanded by Karol Kalita, clashed with a 400-strong detachment of the Imperial Russian Army. Poles lost 5 men, while Russian losses were much higher.\nThe battle began when Russian infantry and Cossacks under Colonel Sukhonin attacked three rebel companies of Polish 3rd Stopnica Regiment, which were stationed in the village of Lubienia. The Russians probably underestimated strength of rebel units, as soon after their attack, two additional Polish companies entered the battle, with two more attacking Russians from their rear. Sukhonin and his soldiers put up a fierce fight, but after some time, he was pushed towards Iłża, where Russians defended themselves in houses. As darkness fell, the skirmish came to an end, and Polish commandant Karol Kalita ordered his men to head towards Prędocin.\nThe battle of Iłża was commemorated on Warsaw's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, with the inscription “IłŻA 17 I 1864\".\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe.
