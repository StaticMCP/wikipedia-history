They adhered to a liberal interpretation of the Torah with simpler rites and a more spiritualized outlook. Hagioi is a Greek word meaning \"saints\", \"holy ones\", \"believers\", \"loyal followers\", or \"God's people\", and was usually used in reference to members of the early Christian communities.  It is a term that was frequently used by Paul in the New Testament, and in a few places in Acts of the Apostles in reference to Paul's activities.\nBoth Gnosticism as well as certain Bacchic pagan cults are also mentioned as likely precursors of Christianity.\nIn The Pauline Epistles and The Rise of English Culture Johnson made the radical claim that the whole of the so-called Dark Ages between 700 and 1400 A. D. had never occurred, but had been invented by Christian writers who created imaginary characters and events. The Church Fathers, the Gospels, St. Paul, the early Christian  texts as well as Christianity in general are identified as mere literary creations and attributed to monks (chiefly Benedictines) who drew up the entire Christian mythos in the early 16th century.  As one reviewer said, Johnson \"undertakes to abolish all English history before the end of the fifteenth century.\" Johnson contends that before the \"age of publication\" and the \"revival of letters\" there are no reliable registers and logs, and there is a lack of records and documents with verifiable dates.\nPublications\n*[https://archive.org/details/mouthofgold00johnrich The Mouth of Gold: A Series of Dramatic Sketches Illustrating the Life and Times of Chrysostom] (1873)\n*[https://archive.org/details/antiquamaterast01johngoog Antiqua Mater: A Study of Christian Origins] (1887)\n*[https://archive.org/details/riseofchristendo00johniala The Rise of Christendom] (1890)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719074724/http://www.radikalkritik.de/PaulEpistles.pdf The Pauline Epistles: Re-studied and Explained] (1894)\n*The Quest of Mr. East (as \"John Soane\") (1900)\n*[https://archive.org/details/riseofenglishcul00johnrich The Rise of English Culture] (1904)\n*[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001934268 The Prolegomena of Jean Hardouin] (translator, 1909)\nSee also\n*Robert Baldauf\n*Jean Hardouin\n*Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060911155951/http://www.radikalkritik.de/AntiquaMater1.pdf \"Antiqua Mater\" in PDF format]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060913004422/http://www.radikalkritik.de/antiqua_mater.htm Antiqua Mater: A Study of Christian Origins]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030826/http://www.radikalkritik.de/pauline_epistles.htm Edwin Johnson's \"The Pauline Epistles - Re-Studied and Explained\", 1894]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061223111119/http://www.radikalkritik.de/PaulEpistles.pdf Edwin Johnson's \"The Pauline Epistles - Re-Studied and Explained\", 1894 in PDF Format]\n*[http://www.egodeath.com/edwinjohnsonpaulineepistles.htm Study Version of Edwin Johnson's \"The Pauline Epistles - Re-Studied and Explained\", 1894]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070227183655/http://www.radikalkritik.de/in_engl.htm Hermann Detering's Radical Critics site]"
