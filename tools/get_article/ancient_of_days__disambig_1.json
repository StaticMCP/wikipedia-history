For Blake, however, this was a title of Urizen (the demiurge in his prophetic books).]]\nAncient of Days or ;  or , ; }} is a name for God in the Book of Daniel. The title \"Ancient of Days\" has been used as a source of inspiration in art and music, denoting the creator's aspects of eternity combined with perfection. William Blake's watercolour and relief etching entitled The Ancient of Days is one such example.\nJudaism\nThis term appears three times in the Book of Daniel (7:9, 13, 22), and is used in the sense of God being eternal.\nKabbalah\nIn the Zohar, the seminal document of Kabbalah that emerged in 13th-century Spain, there is mention of the Ancient of Ancients, and the Holy Ancient One &ndash; Atika Kadisha, variably interpreted as synonymous with the Ein Sof, the unmanifested Godhead. The Ancient of Days is the manifestation of the Ancient of Ancients within Creation. It refers to the most primary (\"ancient\") source of creation in the divine will Keter (\"Crown\").\nIn 16th-century Lurianic Kabbalah,  is systemised as the uppermost  (Divine \"Countenance/Configuration\") in the rectification of the World of Atzilut (\"Emanation\") after the \"Shattering of the sephirot Vessels\". Keter of Atzilut acts as the guiding Divine motivation in creation, developing into two ,  (Ancient of Days) and  (\"Long Visage/Infinitely Patient One\").  is the inner  of Keter, synonymous with Divine Delight, that enclothes within and motivates , the outer  of Keter, synonymous with Divine Will.  is said to extend down all levels of Creation in ever more concealed mode as the divine substratum of everything. The Zohar goes into great detail describing the White Head of God and ultimately the emanation of its anthropomorphic personality or attributes. In the descending realms explained by Luria, the  (\"Skull\"-Keter Will) within  enclothes the Chesed (Kindness) of , becoming the origin of the lights of the world of ; the  (\"Concealed Brain\"—Chokmah Wisdom) within  enclothes the  (Severity) of , becoming the origin of the vessels of the world of . The  (\"Beard\") of  constricts the infinite light originating from  in 13 channels of rectification to lower, relatively finite reality. The Merkabah text Re'uyot Yehezkel identifies the Ancient of Days as Metatron.\nChristianity\nEastern Christianity\n, Georgia]]\nIn Eastern Orthodox Christian hymns and icons, the Ancient of Days is sometimes identified with God the Father or occasionally the Holy Spirit; but most properly, in accordance with Orthodox theology he is identified with God the Son, Jesus Christ.\nMost of the eastern church fathers who comment on the passage in Daniel (7:9–10, 13–14) interpreted the elderly figure as a prophetic revelation of the Son before his physical incarnation.\nEastern Christian art will sometimes portray Jesus Christ as an old man, the Ancient of Days, to show symbolically that he existed from all eternity, and sometimes as a young man, or wise baby, to portray him as he was incarnate. This iconography emerged in the 6th century, mostly in the Eastern Empire with elderly images, although usually not properly or specifically identified as \"the Ancient of Days.\" The first images of the Ancient of Days, so named with an inscription, were developed by iconographers in different manuscripts, the earliest of which are dated to the 11th century. The images in these manuscripts included the inscription \"Jesus Christ, Ancient of Days,\" confirming that this was a way to identify Christ as pre-eternal with the God the Father. Indeed, later, it was declared by the Russian Orthodox Church at the Great Synod of Moscow in 1667 that the Ancient of Days was the Son and not the Father.\nWestern Christianity\nIn the Western Church similar figures usually represent only God the Father. Thomas Aquinas, for example, identifies the Ancient of Days with God the Father, quoting Hilary of Poitiers' comment that \"eternity is in the Father\".\nThe Book of Daniel also contains a reference to \"someone like a son of man\", who is brought up close before the Ancient of Days, and to whom are given \"rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him\" (Daniel 7:13–14). Some Christian commentators have understood this to describe God the Father bestowing rulership over an everlasting kingdom upon Jesus (who is often called \"the Son of man\"), which would suggest that the Ancient of Days is not identical with Jesus. It has been noted that \"Daniel's vision of the two figures is the only one in which the two divine persons are seen face to face\".\nAmong ancient Jewish pseudepigrapha, the Book of Enoch states that he who is called \"Son of man,\" who existed before the worlds were, is seen by Enoch in company with the \"Ancient of Days\".\nIn the hymn \"Immortal, Invisible, God only Wise\" (lyrics Walter C. Smith, 1867), the last two lines of the first verse read:\nIn the hymn \"O Worship the King\" (lyrics Robert Grant, 1833), the last two lines of the first verse read:\nLatter-day Saints\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the title Ancient of Days belongs to Adam, the oldest and earliest man, who is also identified with the archangel Michael.\nUrantia\nAccording to the Urantia Book, the Ancients of Days are an order of celestial beings created by the Trinity to serve in groups of three as the rulers of the seven superuniverses of time and space.\nSee also\n* Abatur—Ancient of Days in Mandaeism\n* God the Father\nNotes\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\n*\n*\n*  |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Urantia_Book |publisher=Urantia Foundation |isbn=978-0-911560-07-7}}"
