Import/export of the schema definitions uses XSL transformations powered by LibXslt library. Imported source files are first converted to XML format: no conversion for XML, simple conversion for YML, creating the Abstract Syntax Tree and its subsequent conversion to XML for PHP annotations.\nThe import/export scripts are configured in JavaScript and can be freely customized.\nSupported ORM frameworks\nFrameworks supported for visual model and schema files generation:\n*Doctrine2\n*Doctrine\n*CakePHP\nHistory\nSkipper was created as an internal tool for the web applications developed by Inventic. It was first published as a commercial tool under the name ORM Designer in 2009.\nApplication was reworked and optimized in January 2013, and released as ORM Designer 2.\nIn May 2013 ORM Designer became part of the South Moravian Innovation Center Incubator program (support program for innovative technological startups).\nIn June 2014, ORM Designer version 3 was released and rebranded under the name of Skipper\nSee also\n*List of object-relational mapping software\n*Comparison of object-relational mapping software\n*Object-relational mapping\n*Database abstraction layer\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
