The men-at-arms of both sides are said to have dismounted to fight.  The battle was swayed by two events.  The Hungarians in the Great Company refused to fight their fellow countrymen in the White Company and left the field, leaving the Great Company at a disadvantage.  Shortly after this, Konrad von Landau was hit in the face by a rock which broke the nosepiece of his helmet, partly incapacitating him.  The loss of their leader and part of their army undermined the Great Company and they fled.  Konrad von Landau was captured alive but he had been further wounded in the melee and died shortly afterwards.\nAftermath\nThe Battle of Canturino led to a truce but had no other significant result other than the death of Landau and the demise of the Great Company.  It was, however, the first field action fought by the White Company and the beginning of their rise to prominence. In July 1363, after a bidding war for its services between Pisa and Florence, the company entered Pisan employ.\nReferences"
