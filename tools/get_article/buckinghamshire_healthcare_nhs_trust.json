The trust changed to its current name on 1 November 2010.\nChanges to hospital provision in the area have been made after neighbouring Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was  taken over by Frimley Park Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in October 2014.\nPerformance\nIn October 2013 as a result of the Keogh Review the Trust was put into the highest risk category by the Care Quality Commission. It was put into a buddying arrangement with Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.\nIn February 2014 the Trust announced it would invest £5 million to create 150 new nursing jobs to cut down on agency staff.  “Before Christmas, we recruited 70 nurses and a further 97 nurses will be starting employment with the trust by April.”  The trust spent £19.3 million on agency staff in 2014/5.\nA Care Quality Commission inspection in March 2014 found the trust had made ‘significant progress’ with ‘real differences made in a relatively short time to improve quality and the patient experience’. Staff were said to be ‘caring and compassionate and treated patients with dignity and respect’.  As a result, the trust was taken out of special measures in June 2014.\nIn February 2016 it was expecting a deficit of £5.5 million for the year 2015/6.\nSee also\n* List of NHS trusts\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.nhs.uk/services/acute-trust/buckinghamshire-healthcare-nhs-trust/RXQ Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust] on the NHS website\n* [https://www.cqc.org.uk/provider/RXQ Inspection reports] from the Care Quality Commission"
