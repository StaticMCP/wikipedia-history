He was educated in Melbourne and Bendigo and after finishing his schooling worked as a reporter for the Bendigo Advertiser. After his defeat in politics he worked for the Public Curator's Office in Brisbane as a valuator.\nOn 18 May 1889 he married Gertrude Mary Fogarty in Townsville and together had a son and four daughters. Gertrude died in 1902 and in 1908 Ryan married Gertrude's sister, Eleanor Marion Fogarty (died 1942). He died in Brisbane in December 1952 and his funeral proceeded from St Finbarr's Catholic Church, Ashgrove, to the Toowong Cemetery.\nPublic career\nAt the 1915 Queensland state election Ryan won the seat of Townsville for the Labor Party, defeating Robert Philp, who had represented the electorate since 1888 and was the Premier of Queensland on two separate occasions. Ryan went on to hold the seat until the 1920 Queensland state election when he was defeated by William Green of the Northern Country Party.\nReferences"
