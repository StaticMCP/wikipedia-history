It is customary in England to name each diocese after the city where its cathedral is located. Occasionally, when the bishop's seat has been moved from one city to another, the diocese may retain both names, for example Bath and Wells. More recently, where a cathedral is in a small or little-known town or city, the diocesan name has been changed to include the name of a nearby larger city: thus the cathedral in Southwell now serves the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, and Ripon Cathedral was in Ripon and Leeds from 1999 until 2014. Cathedrals, like other churches, are dedicated to a particular saint or holy object, or Christ himself, but are commonly referred to by the name of the city where they stand. A cathedral is, simply, the church where the bishop has his chair or \"cathedra\".\nThe forty-two dioceses of the Church of England are administrative territorial units each governed by a bishop. Forty-one dioceses cover England, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, the Isles of Scilly, and a small part of Wales. One diocese, the Diocese in Europe, is also a part of the Church of England (rather than a separate Anglican church such as the Church in Wales), and covers the whole of mainland Europe, the countries of Morocco and Turkey, and the territory of the former Soviet Union.\nThe structure of the dioceses within the Church of England was initially inherited from the Catholic Church as part of the English Reformation. During the Reformation, a number of new dioceses were founded. No new English or Welsh dioceses were then created until the middle of the 19th century, when dioceses were founded mainly in response to the growing population, especially in the northern industrial cities.\nFrom 1787, the Anglican church also erected 41 dioceses outside these isles (see § colonial dioceses); these were part of the Church of England until they were separated from the home Church in 1863. From 1801 until 1871, the dioceses of Ireland were also part of the United Church of England and Ireland. In 1920 (by the Welsh Church Act 1914), the Welsh dioceses were separated to form the Church in Wales.\nThe last dioceses were created in 1927. The 42 dioceses are divided between two Provinces: the Province of Canterbury (with 30 dioceses) and the Province of York (with 12 dioceses). The archbishops of Canterbury and York have pastoral oversight over the bishops within their province, along with certain other rights and responsibilities.\nHistory\nwas under Benedictine rule.]]\nThe history of the cathedrals in Great Britain differs somewhat from that of their European continental counterparts. British cathedrals have always been fewer in number than those of Italy, France, and other parts of Europe, while the buildings themselves have tended to be much larger. While France, at the time of the French Revolution, had 136 cathedrals, England had 27. Because of a ruling that no cathedral could be built in a village, any town in which a cathedral was located was elevated to city status, regardless of its size. To this day several large English cathedrals are located in small \"cathedral cities\", notably Wells and Ely Cathedrals, both of which rank among the greatest works of English Medieval architecture.\nEarly organisation\nIn earlier times, populations were sparsely spread and towns were few. The population of the kingdom of England in the 11th century is estimated at between one and two million, with Lincolnshire, East Anglia, and East Kent the most densely populated areas; in other parts of the country many villages had been razed by the conquest armies.  Instead of exercising jurisdiction over geographical areas, many of the bishops were linked to tribes or peoples, as the bishops of the South Saxons, the West Saxons, the Somersætas, etc. The cathedra of such a bishop was often migratory.\nIn 1075 a council was held in London, under the presidency of Archbishop Lanfranc, which, reciting the decrees of the council of Sardica held in 347 and that of Laodicea held in 360 on this matter, ordered the bishop of the South Saxons to remove his see from Selsey to Chichester; the Wiltshire and Dorset bishop to remove his cathedra from Sherborne to Old Sarum, and the Mercian bishop, whose cathedral was then at Lichfield, to transfer it to Chester. Traces of the tribal and migratory system may still be noted in the designations of the Irish see of Meath (where the result has been that there is now no cathedral church) and Ossory, the cathedral church of which is at Kilkenny. Some of the Scottish sees were also migratory.\nLate Middle Ages\n(1536–41)]]\nBetween 1075 and the 15th century, the cathedrals of England were almost evenly divided between those ruled by secular canons headed by a dean and those ruled by monastic orders headed by a prior, all of which were Benedictine, except Carlisle, which was Augustinian. Two cathedrals, Bath and Coventry, shared their sees with Wells and Lichfield, respectively.\nReformation\nThe entire structure of the monastic and cathedral system was overthrown and reconstituted during the Reformation. Cathedrals which were once Roman Catholic came under the governance of the Church of England.\nAll the English monastic cathedral chapters were dissolved by Henry VIII and, with the exceptions of Bath and Coventry, were re-founded by him as churches of secular chapters, with a dean as the head, and a certain number of canons ranging from twelve at Canterbury and Durham to four at Carlisle, and with certain subordinate officers as minor canons, gospellers, epistolers, etc. The precentorship in these churches of the \"New Foundation\", as they are called, is not, as in the secular churches of the \"Old Foundation\", a dignity, but is merely an office held by one of the minor canons.\nHenry VIII also created six new cathedrals from old monastic establishments, in each case governed by secular canons. Of these, Westminster did not retain its cathedral status. Four more of England's large historic churches were later to become cathedrals: Southwell, Southwark, Ripon, and St Albans Abbey.\nRoles within the Cathedral\nDetails of cathedrals and their foundation\nAncient cathedrals\nThe medieval Church of England was organised into 17 dioceses. About half of the diocesan cathedrals were also monasteries, with the prior serving double duty as dean of the cathedral. The rest were served by a college of \"secular\" canons – non-monastic priests living under no fixed rule of life.  Both types often had Saxon foundations. Dioceses which exist in the Church of England today are indicated in bold type.\nPre-Conquest\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"180\" | Diocese\n! width=\"150\" | Founded\n! width=\"140\" | Monastic or secular?\n!

Furthermore, a number of new dioceses were formed, using some of the largest and finest of the other dissolved monasteries as cathedrals. Together, these two groups &mdash; the old monastic cathedrals and the new sees &mdash; were known as cathedrals of the New Foundation; the old cathedrals which had always been served by secular canons were known as those of the Old Foundation. Dioceses which exist in the Church of England today are indicated in bold type.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"90\" | Diocese\n! width=\"120\" | Founded\n! Notes\n|-\n| Westminster\n| 17 December 1540\n| Its cathedral was Westminster Abbey; but the diocese only existed 1540–50. From 1550–56, Westminster Abbey was a second cathedral, along with St Paul's, for the diocese of London. Since then the Abbey has not been a cathedral, but (since 1560) a Royal Peculiar, in which capacity (as a \"neutral\" non-diocesan Greater Church) the Archbishop of Canterbury (who lives on the other side of the Thames) still uses it for consecrations of bishops.\n|-\n| Chester\n| 4 August 1541\n| St Werburgh's Abbey, an 11th-century Benedictine abbey was dissolved and made the new diocese's cathedral.\n|-\n| Gloucester\n| 3 September 1541\n| St Peter's Abbey (another newly dissolved abbey) became the new diocese's cathedral. It had been in Benedictine hands since the 11th century. See dissolved and reunited to Worcester, 1552; and re-erected, 1554.\n|-\n| Peterborough\n| 4 September 1541\n| The new cathedral had been a Benedictine abbey since the 10th century (St&nbsp;Peter's Abbey).\n|-\n| Bristol\n| 4 June 1542\n| The 12th century Augustinian abbey (St Augustine's Abbey) was dissolved and became the new diocese's cathedral.\n|-\n| Oxford\n| 1 September 1542\n| The cathedral was initially (and briefly) at Osney Abbey, a 12th-century Augustinian abbey. In 1545, the see was transferred to the chapel of Christ Church, Oxford University (which had formerly been part of the Augustinian St Frideswide's Priory)\n|}\nColonial dioceses\nDuring the British colonial era, the Anglican religion was exported to the colonies. From 1787 onwards, Church of England dioceses were founded in the colonies. A structure of provinces and metropolitans developed until, in 1863, the imperial Privy Council ruled that the English church hierarchy had no legal status in the colonies. Immediately prior to that point, the United Church of England and Ireland had a total of 82 dioceses worldwide.\nFrom 1863 onwards, Anglican (former) colonial dioceses have been separate from and independent of the English church. Exceptionally, the Archbishop of Canterbury has retained (and retains to this day) some metropolitan jurisdictions outside England. Dioceses are listed by their name at creation and their present country, with only their cathedral(s) between creation and independence.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"185\" | Diocese\n! width=\"40\" | Year\n!

The following is a simplified breakdown of the creation of dioceses since St Augustine's 6th/7th century dioceses. It is simplified in that not every new diocese is formed from only one predecessor – they have often taken territory from two or more neighbouring dioceses. Today's dioceses are highlighted in bold type.\n*Canterbury – 597–present\n*Rochester – 604–present\n**Hertfordshire and Essex split off to form Diocese of St Albans, 1876–present\n***Essex split off to form Diocese of Chelmsford, 1914–present\n*London – 604–present\n**seat at St Paul's 604–1539\n***split into Diocese of Westminster (seat at Westminster Abbey), 1540–50\n**seats at St Paul's and Westminster Abbey, 1550–56\n**seat at St Paul's, 1556–present\n***Hertfordshire and Essex moved to Rochester, 1846\n*York – 625–present\n**Lindisfarne added (bishop of larger diocese also called \"Bishop of Northumbria\"), 664\n**larger diocese split in 678 to form:\n***Diocese of York\n****Archbishop, 735–present\n****split to create (with part of Lichfield-and-Coventry) the Diocese of Chester, 1541–present\n*****Chester was Province of Canterbury until 1542;
