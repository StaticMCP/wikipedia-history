The Anglophile King of the French Louis Phillipe had been brought to the throne by the Revolution of 1830 in Paris. He was repaying a return visit to Victoria who had met him in Normandy the previous year, a scene recorded in the painting ''The Arrival of Queen Victoria at the Château d'Eu'' by Eugène Lami.\nAs well as Louis Phillipe, the painting features his son, the Duke of Montpensier as well as Victoria's husband Prince Albert. The French king paid the artist 1200 francs for the painting. The work was displayed at the Salon of 1845 at the Louvre, in Paris.\nThe painting is in the collection of the Musée de l'Histoire de France at the Palace of Versailles.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Macedo, Luis Ortez.
