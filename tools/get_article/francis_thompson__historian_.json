He wrote several books.\nEarly life\nThe son of Francis Longstreth Thompson, he was educated at Bootham School, York; The Queen's College, Oxford, where he took a first-class BA in 1949; and Merton College, Oxford, from 1949 to 1951, taking a DPhil in 1956.\nCareer\nHe was Reader in Economic History at University College London in 1963. He became Professor of Modern History at Bedford College in 1968, and was from 1977 to 1990 director of the Institute of Historical Research, University of London.\nHe was president of the Royal Historical Society from 1989 to 1993.\nHe was best known for English Landed Society in the Nineteenth Century (1963), which made the role of the landed gentry a high-priority topic for agrarian and political history. He also studied urban middle and working classes, and suburbia. He added to the long-standing debate on British class history by new emphasis on \"respectability.\"  Thompson argued that it operated across  class boundaries and provided a powerful stabilizing counterbalance to the working class upheavals of Victorian society. His model of society contradicted the more commonly employed Marxist assumptions. He opened up a field that has attracted many younger scholars.\nPersonal life\nIn 1951 Thompson married Anne Challoner; they had two sons and a daughter.\nThompson died on 23 August 2017, aged 92. Anne Thompson died on 27 March 2024.\nWorks\n*Victorian England: the horse-drawn society; an inaugural lecture (1970) at Bedford College\n*English Landed Society in the Nineteenth Century (1963);\n*Hampstead: Building a Borough, 1650–1964 (1974)\n*The Rise of Suburbia (1982) editor\n*Horses in European Economic History: a preliminary canter (1983) editor\n** [https://carriagemuseum.pastperfectonline.com/library/1A6A45E6-499E-4565-A834-784592159437 summary] from Carriage Association of America (CAA); [https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/library/browse/issue.xhtml?recordId=1003994&recordType=Monograph abstract] from Archaeology Data Service (ADS)\n*The Rise of Respectable Society: A Social History of Victorian Britain, 1830–1900 (1988)\n*The University of London and the World of Learning, 1836–1986 (1990, editor);\n*The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750–1950 (1990, three volumes) editor\n** [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cambridge_Social_History_of_Britain.html?id=1x-OEg8f1ykC vol. 1] ; [https://books.google.com/books?id=NYFrk25cRCYC vol. 2] ; vol. 3\n*Gentrification and the Enterprise Culture: Britain 1780–1980 (1993) Ford Lectures;\n*Landowners, Capitalists and Entrepreneurs: Essays for Sir John Habakkuk (1994, editor)\n*English Landed Society Revisited: The Collected Papers of F.
