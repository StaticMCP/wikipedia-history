It’s great to see a heavy band focus more on the Maker than breakdowns and growls. It’s a rare gem that comes highly recommended to fans of the genre.\" Jeremiah Holdsworthfrom Indie Vision Music says:\n\"Musically this album is kicking on all cylinders.  If you were a fan of Sleeping Giant before, then you will definitely be impressed with this release.  If you weren’t a fan then I definitely recommend checking this one out, because this isn’t the same Sleeping Giant from the past.  I also recommend getting the deluxe edition, because the three bonus tracks, are just as good, if not better, then most of the songs on the regular album.\"\n| title4 = The Cross Is Suicide\n| length4 = 4:35\n| title5 = ICXC\n| length5 = 2:33\n| title6 = Tithemi\n| length6 = 3:56\n| title7 = Tongues Of Fire\n| length7 = 3:16\n| title8 = Jehova Shalom\n| length8 = 2:45\n| title9 = The Unnamable Name\n| length9 = 3:29\n| title10 = Morning Star\n| length10 = 4:52\n| title11 = Enthroned\n| length11 = 6:40\n| total length = 38:07\n}}\nCredits\n* J.R.
