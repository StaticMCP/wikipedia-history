His longest spell was with Falkirk (winning the Scottish Cup with the Bairns in 1913), with other clubs including Partick Thistle, St Johnstone and Arbroath.\nHe was selected once for the Scottish Football League XI in 1919 while at Partick Thistle, having featured for the Scotland Junior international team in 1908 which helped to launch his career. On both occasions, his team were well beaten by their English opponents but Stewart was praised for his performance.\nAfter retiring from playing he maintained an interest in sport: playing golf, owning a snooker and billiards hall in his hometown of Perth and introducing indoor lawn bowls greens to Arbroath.\nStewart's son, also named Alex, was also a footballer who played as a forward and was also capped once by the SFL XI.\nReferences"
