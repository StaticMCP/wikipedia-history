      "text": "# King Club\n\nThe King Club was a live music club in Madison, Wisconsin famous for showcasing some of the world's most famous rhythm and blues acts.  It was one block from the Wisconsin State Capitol, at 114 King Street.\nThe club opened in 2000, replacing the hip hop club, Mass Appeal.\nThe King Club featured James Brown's former drummer Clyde Stubblefield every Monday with his Madison R&B band.\nIn 2004, a brawl involving as many as 50 people broke out at an open mic night, causing $1,800 () in damage and requiring bouncers from nearby bars to assist in breaking it up.\nThe King Club closed permanently January 21, 2008. The location quickly sold to the owner of a neighboring restaurant, who converted it to a gay bar called Woof's.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.king-club.com/ King Club site and schedule]"
