      "text": "# The Discovery of Moses\n\nThe Discovery of Moses is an 1886 history painting by the British artist Edwin Long. Also known as 'Pharaoh's Daughter' it depicts the Old Testament scene the Finding of Moses, a popular subject in art from the Renaissance onwards. The infant Moses is discovered in a basket by the Pharaoh's daughter and her handmaidens while they are bathing in the River Nile. It was displayed at the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition of 1886 at Burlington House in London. The work was a stylistic inspiration for the film director Cecil B. DeMille's epic silent film The Ten Commandments. Today the painting is in the collection of the City Museum and Art Gallery in Bristol, having been acquired in 1908.\nSee also\n* The Finding of Moses, an 1885 painting by Frederick Goodall\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Huckvale, David.
