It is typically carried out by marking piping through labels and color codes. Pipe marking helps personnel and fire response teams identify the correct pipes for operational, maintenance or emergency response purposes.\nBackground\nPipes are used extensively in commercial and industrial buildings and on industrial plant (e.g. oil refineries) to transfer fluids between items of plant and equipment. Positive identification assists operations personnel to correctly identify plant when carrying out routine or maintenance activities, and for emergency personnel when responding to emergencies. Pipe marking is particularly important for identification where pipes run along pipe racks, through walls and bulkheads and through floors.\nA range of corporate, national and international codes, standards and regulations are in use around the world.\nNational standards: United States\nANSI/ASME Standards\nIn the United States, Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations recommend following American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standard A13.1-2015 - Scheme for the Identification of Piping Systems.\nThe standard states that labels should be placed where easily viewed by a person standing near the pipe at any of the following points:\n* Valves and flanges.\n* Approximately every  to  on straight sections.\n* A pipe passes through a wall or floor.\n* Any pipe direction changes, such bends or junctions.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display: inline-table;\"\n|+A13.1-1996\n|-\n!

The other major change allowed and encouraged labels to incorporate the GHS signal word, hazard pictograms, and hazard statements. This addition helped identify additional dangers when dealing with materials that fit into multiple categories, like hydrogen sulfide, which is both flammable and toxic.\nIIAR Bulletin #114\nIn 2014, the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration introduced a specialized label design for use when marking pipes associated with refrigeration systems using ammonia, including information such as the physical state, pressure and purpose in the system.\nNFPA 99C 2002\nThe National Fire Protection Association have a special labeling system in the standard for Health Care Facilities, such as hospitals and dentistry offices. This standard puts more emphasis on gases found in Medical gas supply systems, which consist of both oxidizing gases and gases that displace oxygen.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Gas !!

The labels used on pipes must be positioned visibly in the vicinity of the most hazardous points, such as valves and joints; at both sides of bulkheads and floor penetrations; and at reasonable intervals.\nThe regulations do not specify a specific marking system, but BS EN ISO 1710 Graphical symbols — Safety colours and safety signs is often used.\nBS 1710 Safety colours and signs\nA widely used British Standard (BS) for marking equipment is:\n* BS 1710:2019 Graphical symbols — Safety colours and safety signs — Registered safety signs\nThe Standard stipulates the colours to be used.

The main colours are as follows:\n*  Black - Waste media\n*  Blue - Fresh water\n*  Brown - Fuel\n*  Green – Sea water\n*  Grey - Non-flammable gases\n*  Maroon - Air and sounding pipes\n*  Orange - Oils other than fuels\n*  Silver - Steam\n*  Red - Fire fighting\n*  Violet - Acids, alkalis\n*  White - Air in ventilation systems\n*  Yellow - Flammable gases\nISO 20560-1 & -2  Safety information for piping systems\nInternational Standard ISO 20560-1:2020 Safety information for the content of piping systems and tanks — Part 1: Piping systems was intended to replace the variety of regulations and standards across countries and regions.
