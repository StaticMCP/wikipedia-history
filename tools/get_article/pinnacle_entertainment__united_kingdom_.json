When Zomba was subsequently purchased by BMG in 2002, Windsong/Pinnacle was moved under Bertelsmann's group Arvato AG. In January 2008, Windsong completed a buyout from Arvato, gaining independent ownership again. During the Great Recession, the company went into administration, effective December 3, 2008. It was then that Windsong Exports purchased the group and turned it into the UK's leading music distributor.  Following that, the companies were usually referred to jointly as Windsong/Pinnacle.\nDivisions\nAudio Services\nPinnacle's music division Audio Services Ltd., was primarily known for the distribution of over 400 independent record labels in the UK, but it also consisted of its own record label, label management for distributed labels, and marketing and sales divisions.\nRecord labels\n*Pinnacle Records (artists include Flintlock, James Arthur Edwards)\n*Firebird Records (artists included Nick Straker)\n*Collins Classics – formed in 1989, closed in 1998.\nPinnacle Software\nFormed in 1992, Pinnacle Software serves as a publishing company that represents many computer software companies such as 3MV, New Note, Shellshock and Beechwood.
