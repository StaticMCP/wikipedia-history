      "text": "# Culture of New Orleans\n\nBird's-eye view of New Orleans from 1862\nThe culture of New Orleans is unique among, and distinct from, that of other cities in the United States, including other Southern cities. New Orleans has been called the \"northernmost Caribbean city\" and \"perhaps the most hedonistic city in the United States\". Over the years, New Orleans has had a dominant influence on American and global culture.\nIn a locale once inhabited by Choctaw, Houma, and other native tribes, prominent cultural influences date to the French and Spanish colonial periods and the introduction of enslaved Africans in the 18th century.\nLanguage\nAmerican English, with significant variations, is the dominant language in New Orleans. French is used less in daily life than it was in the past. Francophones are, however, still present in the city and continue to keep the language alive, though they are less present than in other part of southern Louisiana. However, its expressions and pronunciation have influenced various dialects in New Orleans, and it was still in significant use at the start of the 20th century. There are nine French immersion schools in the Greater New Orleans area and French is still spoken among elites in the city .  The city has a long tradition of Hispanic immigrants dating back to the 18th century. Louisiana French, Spanish and  Vietnamese are also heard in the city; Louisiana French speakers from southeast Louisiana entered the city during the 1970s–1980s oil boom, and a sizeable Vietnamese community established itself in the city in the last third of the 20th century.\nThe distinctive local accent is a Creole accent and not the stereotypical Southern accent so often misportrayed by film and television actors. It does, like earlier Southern Englishes, feature frequent deletion of post-vocalic \"r\".  There are many theories of the origin of the accent, but it likely results from New Orleans' geographic isolation by water, and the fact that New Orleans was a major port of entry into the United States throughout the 19th century [http://www.theharzkes.com/genealogy/sources.htm].  Many of the immigrant groups who reside in Brooklyn also reside in New Orleans, with the largest groups being Irish, Germans, and Italians (with Sicilians predominating in the last group).\nThe prestige associated with being from New Orleans by many residents is likely a factor in the linguistic assimilation of the ethnically divergent population. This distinctive accent is dying out generation by generation in the city (but remains very strong in the surrounding parishes). As with many sociolinguistic artifacts, it is usually attested much more strongly by older members of the population. One subtype of the New Orleans accent is sometimes identified as Yat (from \"Where y'at\"). This word is not used as a generalized term for the New Orleans accent, and is generally reserved for the strongest varieties.\nNew Orleans is usually pronounced by locals as \"noo-AW-lyenz\", \"noo-AW-linz\", \"noo-OR-linz\", or \"noo-OR-lyenz\".  The tendency among people around the world to say \"noo-or-LEENZ\" stems from the use of that pronunciation by singers and songwriters, who find it easy to rhyme.  The pronunciation \"NAW-linz\" is likewise not generally used nor liked by locals but has been popularized by the tourist trade.\n:Local pronunciations: , , , ,\n:French: La Nouvelle-Orléans\n:Spanish: Nueva Orleans\nAlso notable are lexical items specific to the city, such as lagniappe  meaning \"a little something extra\", ''makin' groceries for grocery shopping, or neutral ground'' for a street median.\nMusic\nLouis Armstrong, famous jazz [[musician]]\nNew Orleans has always been a significant center for music with its intertwined European, Latin American, and African-American cultures. It was the site of the first opera house in the United States.  The city engendered jazz with its brass bands. Decades later it was home to a distinctive brand of rhythm and blues that contributed greatly to the growth of rock and roll. In addition, the nearby countryside is the home of Creole music, Zydeco music, Jazz, and Delta blues.\nCrime\nNew Orleans has consistently experienced a high homicide rate during the previous two to three decades. Its average annual per-capita homicide rate (59 per 100,000) ranks highest of large cities in the country from 1990 to 2010 based on Bureau Of Justice Statistics from FBI Uniform Crime Reports. In 1994, 421 people were killed (85.8 per 100,000 people), a homicide rate which has not been matched by any major city to date. The homicide rate rose and fell year to year throughout the late 1990s, but the overall trend from 1994 to 1999 was a steady reduction in homicides.\nBeginning in 2000, the homicide rate again increased. New Orleans had the highest homicide rate of any major American city in 2000 (42.1 per 100,000 people), 2001 (44.0 per 100,000), 2002 (53.1 per 100,000), 2003 (57.7 per 100,000) and 2004 (56.0 per 100,000). In 2005, there were 202 murders after 8 months a rate of 47 per 100,000, which was still a higher rate than any other major city's 12 month rate, but was not official because there was still 1 month left until the end of 3rd quarter crime data was to be released. In 2006, (70 per 100,000), 2007 (81 per 100,000), 2008 (64 per 100,000), 2009 (52 per 100,000), 2010 (51 per 100,000) and 2011 (58 per 100,000) it was more of the same as the previous years with New Orleans posting the highest per capta homicide rate of any major American city, or 12 years in a row annually until 2012, when the rate (53 per 100,000) was the 2nd highest among major U.S. cities. In 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011 New Orleans' per capita homicide rate led cities with populations of 100,000 or more residents, which made it the nation's murder capital of the above-mentioned years with annual per capita homicide rates that were at least ten times the U.S. average in each of those years, according to Bureau of Justice Statistics from FBI Uniform Crime Reports, NOLA.com, and criminologist Dr. Peter Scharf.[http://www.cityrating.com/citycrime.asp?city=New+Orleans&state=LA New Orleans Crime Statistics (LA) - CityRating.com]\nAfter Hurricane Katrina (2005), news media attention focused on the reduced violent-crime rate following the exodus of many New Orleanians. That trend began to reverse itself as people returned to the city, although calculating the homicide rate remained difficult when no authoritative source could cite a total population figure.\nIn 2003, most victims in New Orleans were killed within three months of their last arrest. The homicide rate for the New Orleans metropolitan statistical area, which includes the suburbs, was 24.4 per 100,000 in 2002.[https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_02/html/web/offreported/02-table06NO.html FBI - Crime in the US, 2002 - Crime Index Offenses Reported]\nNews & entertainment media\nThe major newspaper is The Times-Picayune, publishing since 1837.

Mardi Gras celebrations include parades and floats; participants toss strings of cheap colorful beads and doubloons to the crowds. The Mardi Gras season is kicked off with the only parade allowed through the French Quarter (Vieux Carré, translated Old Square), a walking parade aptly named Krewe du Vieux.\nThe largest of the city's many musical festivals is the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Commonly referred to simply as, \"Jazz Fest\", it is one of the largest music festivals in the nation, and features crowds coming from all over the world to experience music, food, arts, and crafts.

When it opened, Walt Disney had then-New Orleans mayor Victor H. Schiro made honorary mayor of New Orleans Square.  Schiro, in turn, made Disney an honorary citizen of the real New Orleans.\nFood in New Orleans\nNew Orleans is world-famous for its food. The indigenous cuisine is distinctive and influential. From centuries of amalgamation of local Creole, haute Creole, Cajun, and New Orleans French cuisines, New Orleans food has developed. Local ingredients combined with French, Spanish, Italian, African, Native American, and a hint of Cuban food traditions combine to produce a truly unique and easily recognizable Louisiana flavor.\nUnique specialties include beignets, square-shaped fried pastries that could be called \"French doughnuts\" (served with coffee and chicory, known as café au lait); po' boy and Italian muffuletta sandwiches; Gulf oysters on the half-shell, boiled crawfish, and other seafood; étouffée, jambalaya, gumbo, and other Creole dishes; and the Monday favorite of red beans and rice (Louis Armstrong often signed his letters, \"Red beans and ricely yours\").
