Inside, a weird-dressed, muscle-bound character known as Spaceman Dynamite starts planning something mischievous that will surely bring trouble to the good people below, and in consequence to Goemon and his friends.\nGameplay\nThe game alternates between stages featuring either Goemon or Ebisumaru. Each character takes a different route towards the bad guy and as a result the stages scroll differently for each character. The player can collect upgraded items and weapons but there's no character upgrading besides that. The game also features mid-level bonus rounds featuring the rest of Goemon's buddies in several arcade mini-games as traditional for the series.\nReferences"
