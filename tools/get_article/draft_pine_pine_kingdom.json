It is located in the eastern in the North West section of Irvine High School in the El Camino Real neighborhood and in the Greentree Subdivision.\nIts address is 67 Escolar Drive located across the street from Butterfly Estates and is a micronation.\nHistory\nIn November of 2024, a bored freshmen decided he wanted to add a fort and decided to make it out of Pine Needles. This decision was made around the 2nd and he gathered members to work on it and it was 3 feet tall before being torn down on the 16th. He had the funeral on the 18th, his birthday.\nIn December, saddened he tried rebuilding it and cut the grass short in the area but with no luck, he did however upload and was able to add it onto Google Maps where a man from San Francisco approved it. The address stole from a house nearby but it was set to be 69 Escolar Drive.\nIn January of 2025, the Santa Ana Winds swept by, the same ones that caused the Eaton Fire and the Palisades Fire caused the winds to sweep all the Pine Needles down. They were used to build up a brand new fort 4-5 feet tall!\nIn Spring, drastic changes happened like in February the fort was once again torn down and in March the plans to make a Golf Course and expansions were made as well as Project 2026. In April, the Golf Course was complete and was a great place until the Golf Club was stolen by an unknown suspect. In May, a national anthem was picked as well as a failed project to make potions and in June we finish off by rebuilding the fort to ankle-height.\nReferences\nDO NOT TRUST THIS SITE IF DRASTIC EDITS ARE MADE THAT IS VANDALISM! (More coming soon!)"
