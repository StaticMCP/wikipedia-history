His brother Wally played for Hawthorn.\nIn 2001 Ware was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame.\nCareer highlights\n* Brownlow Medal: 1941\n* Footscray Best and Fairest: 1934, 1937, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942\n* Footscray captain: 1940\n* Victorian representative (10 games, 6 goals)\n* Footscray Team of the Century (2002)\n* Footscray-Western Bulldogs Hall of Fame: Legend (2018)\n* Australian Football Hall of Fame (2001)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.afl.com.au/news/event-news/hall-of-fame/players Australian Football Hall of Fame]"
