It opened its museum and research centre in the former Heidelberg Courthouse in 1979 and continues to operate these facilities with support from volunteer members. The Society became incorporated as an association in 2002 and is an affiliated society of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria. The Society is located in the City of Banyule, a local government municipality.\nBuilding\nThe Society's headquarters and museum is the Old Heidelberg Courthouse, formerly part of the Magistrate's Court of Victoria. The red brick building was designed by J B Cohen (an architect in the Public Works Department) and built by Swanson Bros. The foundation stone was laid on 4 October 1899 and work continued throughout the Australian summer, in time for the opening and first court on 2 April 1900.\nThe Courthouse continued in use until 1979 when a more modern courthouse was built nearby in Jika Street.\nThe building is owned by the State Government of Victoria and is managed by a committee of the Society.\nThe Old Heidelberg Courthouse was listed on the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) register in 1982 as it is 'an unusual example of Edwardian period architecture'. The statement of significance draws attention to the 'high octagonal Court Room which has clerestory windows and a steeply pitched hipped roof (formerly slate), is surrounded by ancillary offices with a prominent entrance porch and door with a leadlight over'.\nIn 2018, the Society joined the Open House Melbourne program, making the building available for public viewing on Saturday 28 July.\nCollection\nThe Society collects and preserves historically significant records and items from the Heidelberg district from its early beginnings in 1838 and the subsequent Shire of Heidelberg (1871-1934), City of Heidelberg (1934-1994) and City of Banyule (from 1994), as established within their boundaries from time to time. The Heidelberg District encompassed a large area to the north-east of the Melbourne stretching from the Merri Creek along the Yarra River and Plenty River through the Diamond Valley to the Kinglake Ranges.\nThe Society collects objects, photographs, maps, business & community archives, audio-visual media, local newspapers, and electronic databases. It also has a reference library and a number of other information resources to support research.\nExhibitions\nThe Society develops exhibitions that display items from its own collections, often augmented by loans from members. Recent exhibitions include:\n* 'An Invitation to the Ball: Women's formal wear, 1850-1950' (2010).\n* 'Against the Forces: A tribute to the memory of Walter Burley Griffin and Marian Mahony Griffin' (2013).
