Queen of Nanaimo was used to ferry passengers and vehicles from mainland British Columbia, Canada to the islands off its coast. In 2017, the vessel was sold to Goundar Shipping Ltd. and renamed 'MV Lomaiviti Princess V' for service in Fiji.\nDescription\nAs built the ferry measured  with a length overall of  and  between perpendiculars with a beam of . The vessel was powered by two diesel engines driving two propellers giving the ship a maximum speed of .\nIn 1974, the ship was lengthened and Queen of Nanaimos was measured at  long overall and  between perpendiculars with the tonnage remeasured at  and . In 2006 there was a major overhaul of its passenger areas. Its propulsion is by two Mirrlees National KVSSM twin turbocharged (intercooled) single acting 4-stroke, V16 diesel engines which produce  at 320 rpm. 15-inch bore by  stroke. Propellers are variable pitch (controllable-pitch propeller) made by KaMeWa (a Rolls-Royce company). The ship is capable of carrying 164 vehicles and 1,005 passengers and crew.\nService history\nThe ship was built by Victoria Machinery Depot of Victoria, British Columbia, on behalf of BC Ferries with the yard number 104. Queen of Nanaimo was launched on December 3, 1963, and completed in June 1964. In 1974, the ship was rebuilt and extended  in length. It operated on the Tsawwassen–Gulf Islands route web in British Columbia, Canada.\nQueen of Nanaimo underwent two major refits, one in 2010 and the other in 2015, to maintain Transport Canada's safety standards. On August 3, 2010, Queen of Nanaimo had a \"hard landing\" at the Village Bay terminal on Mayne Island. Media reports suggested at least one serious injury and damage to vessel and dock. It was later established that the landing was caused by a mechanical failure after the ship ran over a commercial crab trap, making it impossible to put the ship into reverse. On July 1, 2011, Queen of Nanaimo had another \"hard landing\" at the Tsawwassen terminal.\nOn November 2, 2013, the ship was pushed off course at Mayne Island after hitting severe weather. It damaged a private dock, but no one was injured.\nOn June 25, 2017, Queen of Nanaimo was taken out of service by BC Ferries due to issues with the vessel's propellers. The ferry returned to service on June 29. The vessel was retired in mid-2017 and was sold to Goundar Shipping Ltd for service in Fiji. Renamed Lomaiviti Princess V after arrival in Fiji in November, the vessel began operations on the Suva–Savusavu route in December 2017. In June 2020, Goundar Shipping announced that the vessel would be sold for scrap. In June 2022, the vessel was sold to a scrap yard in Alang, India.\nSee also\n* List of ship launches in 1963\nCitations\nReferences\n* }}"
