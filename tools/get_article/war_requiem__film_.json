Decca Records required that the 1963 recording be heard on its own, with no overlaid soundtrack or other sound effects. The film featured Nathaniel Parker as Wilfred Owen, and Laurence Olivier in his last acting appearance before his death in July 1989. The film is structured as the reminiscences of Olivier's character, the Old Soldier, and Olivier recites \"Strange Meeting\" in the film's prologue.\nCast\n* Laurence Olivier (Old Soldier)\n* Nathaniel Parker (Wilfred Owen)\n* Tilda Swinton (Nurse)\n* Sean Bean (German Soldier)\n* Nigel Terry (Abraham)\n* Patricia Hayes (Mother)\n* Owen Teale (Unknown Soldier)\n* Jodie Graber (Young boy soldier)\n* Spencer Leigh (Soldier 1)\nFilming\nShooting for the film took place at Darenth Park Hospital in Kent, beginning 17 October 1988 and lasting for 18 days.
