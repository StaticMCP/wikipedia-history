At Tawahin, Alptakin defeated the Fatimid left, but al-Aziz managed to break through the Daylamites holding the Turk's centre and right, winning the battle, and with it control of Syria. Alptakin was captured but treated honorably, and his Turkic and Daylamite soldiery, who had proven their worth against the Kutama Berbers who until then composed the bulk of the Fatimid military, were taken into Fatimid service. Augmented with these forces, the Fatimids were able to expand their rule over Syria in the following decade and enter into a conflict with the Byzantine Empire. The battle thus marked the beginning of the eclipse of the Kutama as the mainstay of the Fatimid Caliphate.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
