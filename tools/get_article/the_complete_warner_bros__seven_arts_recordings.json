It contains 30 tracks, containing remastered versions of Guaraldi's complete recorded output for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts (Oh Good Grief!, The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi, Alma-Ville), plus four bonus tracks.\nBackground\nVince Guaraldi's final three albums released during his lifetime were recorded for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts after spending considerable time struggling to extricate himself from Fantasy Records. Warner signed Guaraldi to a three-record deal, and insisted that his inaugural release consist of his Peanuts songs. This was done in part to help fill the void left by a lack of soundtrack albums to accompany the successful television specials, ''Charlie Brown's All Stars!, It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, You're in Love, Charlie Brown and He's Your Dog, Charlie Brown. Guaraldi responded with new renditions of eight of his most popular scores from those programs on his first release, Oh Good Grief!.\nGuaraldi was then given complete artistic control over his sophomore, self-produced Warner effort, The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi'', resulting in an unfocused and overindulgent album that was not well received by both critics and consumers. At Warner's insistence, arranger Shorty Rogers was recruiter to produce Guaraldi's final album, Alma-Ville. Though deemed a focused improvement over the previous album, Warner lost interest in Guaraldi and did not promote the album. Both The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi and Alma-Ville fell into obscurity, with Oh Good Grief! remaining in print and a steady seller due to the perpetual popularity of the Peanuts franchise.\nProduction\nThe Complete Warner Bros.–Seven Arts Recordings was compiled by prestige label Omnivore Recordings and produced by Grammy Award-winning Cheryl Pawelski. Pawelski recruited audio archivist Michael Graves (who worked on previous Guaraldi remastering efforts) to perform a high-definition 24-bit mix.\nIn addition to a double-CD release, Oh, Good Grief! was issued on translucent red vinyl.\nTrack listings\nAll tracks written by Vince Guaraldi, except where noted.\nDisc One\n| title7 = Red Baron\n| length7 = 4:49\n| title8 = Rain, Rain Go Away\n| length8 = 5:06}}\n| length12 = 8:29\n| title13 = The Beat Goes On\n| writer13 = Sonny Bono\n| length13 = 3:50\n| title14 = Yesterday\n| writer14 =\n| length14 = 3:38\n| title15 = Coffee and Doe-Nuts\n| length15 = 7:00\n| title16 = Reason to Believe\n| writer16 = Tim Hardin\n| length16 = 2:55\n| title17 = It Was a Very Good Year\n| writer17 = Ervin Drake\n| length17 = 6:43\n}}\nDisc Two\n| length1 = 5:21\n| title2 = The Beat Goes On\n| note2 = alternate take/Take 14\n| writer2 = Sonny Bono\n| length2 = 7:18\n| title3 = Oh Happy Day\n| note3 = unreleased\n| writer3 = Edwin Hawkins\n| length3 = 3:44\n| title4 = The Sharecropper's Daughter\n| note4 = unreleased\n| length4 = 2:40}}\n| length8 = 5:09\n| title9 = Uno Y Uno\n| length9 = 2:13\n| title10 = Alma-Ville\n| length10 = 4:33\n| title11 = Rio From the Air\n| length11 = 6:11\n| title12 = Watch What Happens\n| note12 = from the film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\n| writer12 =\n| length12 = 4:11\n| title13 = Jimbo’s\n| note13 = aka \"Jambo's\" and \"Casaba\"\n| length13 = 7:26\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from CD liner notes.\nOh, Good Grief\n*Vince Guaraldi – piano, electric harpsichord\n*Eddie Duran – guitar\n*Stanley Gilbert – double bass\n*Carl Burnett – drums\nThe Eclectic Vince Guaraldi\n*Vince Guaraldi – piano, electric harpsichord, guitar, lead vocals\n*Eddie Duran, Robert Addison – guitars\n*Bob Maize, Jim McCabe – electric bass\n*Peter Marshall – bass\n*Gerald Granelli, Al Coster – drums\n*Gloria Strassner, Jesse Ehrlich – cello\nAlma-Ville\n* Vince Guaraldi&nbsp;– piano, guitar\n* Herb Ellis&nbsp;– guitar\n* Eddie Duran&nbsp;– guitar\n* Monty Budwig&nbsp;– bass\n* Kelly Bryan&nbsp;– bass\n* Sebastião Neto&nbsp;– electric bass\n* Dom Um Romão&nbsp;– drums\n* Colin Bailey&nbsp;– drums\n* Al Coster&nbsp;– drums\n* Rubens Bassini&nbsp;– percussion\nBonus tracks\n* Vince Guaraldi&nbsp;– piano\n* Eddie Duran&nbsp;– guitar\n* Peter Marshall – bass\n* Bob Belanski – drums\nAdditional musicians for Disc 2, Tracks 1 and 2 are unknown.\nReferences"
