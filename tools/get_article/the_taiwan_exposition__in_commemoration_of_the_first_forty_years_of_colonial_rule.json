But, following concerns that this was too focused in the city centre one in Daitōtei was added,\nZhongshan Hall area, Ximending\nThe first area was in front of the recently completed Taipei Zhongshan Hall, Ximending, hosted the large ceremonies, showed Taiwanese agriculture, forestry, railway construction, mining, sugar and telecoms; displays from Japan, Korea and Manchuria and Japanese businesses including Mitsui & Co. and Nippon Steel Corp.. It was 4.29 hectares big.\nThere were displays from Formosa itself, Japan, Korea and Manchuria.\nFile:Taiwan Exposition, area 1, Taihoku, 1935.jpg|Aerial view of Ximending, Taihoku\nEXPO Taiwan bird-eye view map part 1935.jpg|Contemporaneous bird's eye map of Ximending by Hatsusaburō Yoshida\nNational Taiwan Museum area\nThe \"First Cultural Pavilion\" was housed in what is now the National Taiwan Museum. It was 7.93 hectares big.\nFile:Taiwan Exposition, area 2, Taihoku, 1935.jpg|Aerial view of National Taiwan Museum area\nBeitou hot springs\nA site away from Taipei in the Beitou hot springs area was used to promote tourist attractions in Taiwan and plans for Datun National Park (now Yangmingshan National Park) and was housed in a \"'Grass Mountain Exhibition Hall\".\nDaitōtei\nThe first two areas were both central Taipei, which led to local gentry making a request for a third exhibition area elsewhere in Taipei, in Daitōtei (now Dadaocheng).\nThis area hosted the \"South Pavilion\" which showed products from Siam (Thailand), the Philippines province and the Fujian Province, along with information about plans for Japan's future expansion.\nEntertainments intended to attract Taiwanese people to this section included the opera performer Mei Lanfang, a Mazu parade and a Peking opera group.\nAttendance\nIt is estimated that over a million people attended the fair, with 2,750,000 individual visits to the several exhibition halls.\nReferences"
