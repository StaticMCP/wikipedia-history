For example, Glenn Gravatt compiled numerous such tricks in his book Encyclopedia of Self-working Card Tricks (1936), which was later compiled with Second Encyclopedia of Card Tricks (1936) to create Jean Hugard's classic text Encyclopedia of Card Tricks in 1937.  Strictly speaking no magic is \"self-working\", since tricks still need to be performed and presented correctly, and so some writers prefer the term \"auto-magic\", which was popularized by Michael Breggar in his monthly \"Auto-Magic\" column in The Linking Ring.\nMany self-working card tricks rely on mathematical principles, and can be replicated by following the steps correctly.  A simple example is the trick \"Magical 13\", where a deck of playing cards is secretly set up with all the suits in order.  Because cards of the same value are exactly 13 away from each other in this prearranged order, the spectator can cut the deck as often as they like, but when they deal the deck into 13 piles, each pile will consist of four cards with exactly the same value.\nSome consider optical illusions and some science demonstrations, where the wonder comes from unexpectedness of a natural phenomenon, to fall into the category of self-working magic as well.\nExamples\nSome of the best card tricks in the world are self-working, one of the most notable examples being Out Of This World (1942) by Paul Curry.\nMany people are first introduced to performing magic via self-working card tricks.  Some of the most widely known self-working card tricks include the Twenty-One Card Trick, The Four Robbers, The Piano Trick, Spectator Cuts To The Aces, The Spelling Bee, The Circus Card Trick, and Do As I Do.\nResources\nClassic texts on self-working tricks include Scarne on Card Tricks (1950) by John Scarne, Self-Working Card Tricks (1976) and similar books by Karl Fulves published by Dover Publications, and the Card College Light trilogy by Roberto Giobbi.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Gravatt, Glenn.
