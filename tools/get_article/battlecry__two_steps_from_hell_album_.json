However he finished his critique with, \"orchestral music buffs won't be too keen... but perhaps fans of Nightwish and other symphonic metal might be able to appreciate the album as a whole.\"\nIFMCA-associated reviews website, MundoBSO, highlighted its \"great melodic power\" and rated it seven out of ten stars.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|123\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|123\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Classical Albums (Ultratop Flanders)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Classical Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Independent Albums (OCC)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|44\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| UK Independent Album Breakers (OCC)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|183\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Classical Albums (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Classical Crossover Albums (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Independent Albums (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top Sales (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|82\n|}\nAnthology re-release\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=274| Chart (2017)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Classical Albums (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Classical Crossover Albums (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=285| Chart (2015)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Classical Albums (Billboard)\n| 24\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Classical Crossover Albums (Billboard)\n| 14\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=285| Chart (2016)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Classical Albums (Billboard)\n| 43\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" width=285| Chart (2022)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Classical Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|44\n|}\nUse in media\nThe tracks from Two Steps from Hell are frequently used in film trailers and other promotional materials:\n* \"Last of the Light\" and \"Unforgiven\" were used for two trailers of Uncharted 4.\n* \"None Shall Live\" was used in the Captain America: Civil War \"Hero Gear\" commercial and trailers for the Ultimate Edition of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Teenage Mutant Ninja\nTurtles Season 4, Aquaman and The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone.
