In the Radio Times Guide to TV Comedy (1998), critic Mark Lewisohn said, \"the ideas with good potential were buried under a mountain of mediocrity... the show's clash of styles, pacing and mood worked heavily against them\". However, he cited Marcus Brigstocke's psychotic airline pilot and David Walliams's insane royal watcher as standout characters.\nBrian Donaldson of The List described the show as \"something of a mixed bag\" and noted that \"there's a healthy amount of decent moments\". He concluded, \"Barking was never as mad as it thought it was and the show's bite was largely toothless\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
