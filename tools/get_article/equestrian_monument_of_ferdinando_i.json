It is said the statue was cast with cannons taken from the Turks by the Knights of Santo Stefano.\nFlanking the statue some yards to the rear of the horse are two mannerist fountains with marine gargoyles, the Fontana dei mostri marini, also created by Tacca though initially intended to be placed at the statue of Ferdinand in Livorno.\nReferences"
