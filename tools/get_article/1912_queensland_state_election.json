The opposition Labor Party was led by David Bowman, who had been Labor leader since 15 April 1907.\nThis election used contingent voting in single-member districts. Five districts that had been two-seat districts - Mackay, Maryborough, North Brisbane, Rockhampton and South Brisbane - were reformed and hereafter have only one seat.\nResults\nDenham and his government were returned to office despite a swing to Labor of almost 10 percent.  This was largely due to winning newly created seats in rural areas, while losing seats in Brisbane which mostly went to Labor.\n| house        = Legislative Assembly\n| series       = Queensland state election\n| back         = 1909\n| forward      = 1915\n| enrolled     = 309,590\n| total_votes  = 216,032\n| turnout %    = 75.52\n| turnout chg  = +2.85\n| informal     = N/A\n| informal %   = N/A\n| informal chg = N/A\n}}\n|}\nSee also\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1909–1912\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1912–1915\n* Denham Ministry\nReferences"
