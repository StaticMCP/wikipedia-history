The Kaivartas were able to capture Varendra by this rebellion. The revolt might have been the first peasant revolt in Indian history. However, the first phase of the revolt would more appropriately be described as a rebellion of feudal lords (samantas), who would have mobilized the peasants, and the last phase of the revolt was a spontaneous mass uprising.\nSources for history of the rebellion and the dynasty\n* Ramacharitam by Sandhyakar Nandi\n* Bhaturiya Inscription of Rajyapala\n* Belava plate of Bhojvarman\n* Manahali Cooper plate inscription of Madanpala\n* Kamauli copper plate inscription of Vaidyadeva\n* Taranatha's history of Buddhism in India\nIdentification of rebels\nIn  the  early ancient period the Kaivartas  were  rated  low,  associated  with  boatmen,  fishermen,  or  else forest-settlers hunters and raiders  like  the  Niṣāda  or  even  the  dāsas,  or  were  described  as  a  mixed  caste—sankīrṇa  jāti,  or  as  antyajas. The Vaṃśānucarita  of the Viṣṇu  Purāṇa mentioned that a  king  of  Magadha, having  overthrown  the traditionally accepted  kṣatriyas would  create  new category of  kṣatriyas. Romila Thapar notes that the  list  of  other  varṇas  converted  to  Kṣatriya  status through  this process  includes  the  Kaivarta. The Sultanpur copperplate inscription of the 5th century brings to light the presence of Kaivartaśarman in the local assembly (adhikaraṇa) as a member of Kuṭumbin (peasant landholders) in Gupta Bengal. Swapna Bhattacharya notes that in Varendra Kaivartas were represented not only as fishermen and cultivators, but Brahmins as well. R. C. Majumdar and RS Sharma mentioned the merger of this tribe or clan with Aryan or Brahmanical society and later getting affiliated with Mahishya, an offspring of Kshatriya father and Vaishya mother.\nThe name of Kaivartas appeared in  a grant of  Gopāla II as one of  the lowest categories of rural residents. There are reference to   vṛttis of Kaivartas like Osinnakaivartavṛtti, Uddhannakaivartavṛttivahikala, in the copperplates of  Mahīpāla I and Vigrahapāla III. According to Ryosuke Furui, these vṛttis or  lands, given for livelihoods or some services, connote their settling in agrarian frontier and the growth of some section to a class of landholders. Furui further noted there might also be a diverse social group in Varendra labelled as \"Kaivarta\". The Kaivartas acquired the position of subordinate rulers through their association with the Pāla kings in the forms of military or other services and the appointment to administrative positions. On the other hand, Historians Vishweshwar Chakraborty and HS Kotiyal opined that Pala kings and rebel Samanta leaders both were Kaivartas or Mahishyas.\nDynasty\nOrigin\nSP Lahiry argued that Divya was from the family of Yasodāsa who was the prime minister in royal court of Rajyapala. This dāsa dynasty of cāsi Kaivarta clan, of which Yasodāsa's ancestors Malhadāsa, Suradāsa, and Sanghadāsa were important members, were known for their wealth and prowess. When Yasodas was the prime minister, the king commanded allegiance with Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Suhma, Pandya, Karnata, Gurjara etc. Yasodasa is said to have performed many humanitarian and religious activities in the form of excavation of tanks, construction of temples, monasteries, palaces and bridges etc.\nDivya, Rudok and Bhima ruled Varendra for around half a century.\nDivya\nDivya held very high royal office, presumably commander-in-chief of royal army. The rebels responded to his call and were easily able to capture Varendra. Mahipala II was killed by the rebels and the Pala armies were forced to fall back. As a result, Varendra was declared a separate state by Divya, and he became the king of Gauḍa, the Pāla capital. During his rule Jatavarman of Varman Dynasty in Vanga attacked Varendra with a hostility towards Buddhism. Though Divya did not suffer any loss, a part of Buddhist monastery of Somapura was destroyed by fire set by Jatavarman's army. Divya consolidated his position in Varendra. He was a powerful ruler and invaded Ramapala's dominion. He left a peaceful kingdom to his Brother Rudok, but nothing is known of him.\n(Divya's Lake) was excavated and a granite pillar was commissioned to celebrate Divya's victory ( now in Naogaon, Bangladesh)]]\nBhima\nRudok was succeeded by his son Bhima, who successfully ruled the region for 30 years. After becoming the master of Varendri, Bhima, a popular king who is remembered still, reinforced the already well-established Kaivarta power. Bhima made the war-torn Varendra prosper. Bhima dispossessed Brahmanical and other religious agents from their lands, which were granted by Pala kings. He prioritised the interests of peasants who happened to be his kith and kin.\nDibyak Jayastambha or Kaivarta pillar is still standing in Naogaon District of Bangladesh as a sign of the dynasty. Bhima's Dyeing, Bhima's Jangal, Bhima Sagar, Bhima's Panti etc. in Varendra still bear his memory.\nAnalysis of reasons and consequences\nAccording to Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, the Kaivarta rebellion  is associated with the Siddha movement. The story of the Buddhist Mahasiddhas inspired them to revolt.\nRomila Thapar mentioned that the rebels were  associated with Buddhist and Tantric sects - Vajrayana which was popular then in the region. The rebels, who confiscated granted (agrahara) lands to Brahmins, were probably unhappy with royal patronage of Brahmins and brahminical institutions' growing influences on subordinate rulers and in rural society.\nRam Sharan Sharma described that Bhima had popular support of masses, but the samantas did not support him as the rebels were inspired by egalitarian spirit. Ramapala had to beg the supports of independent chiefs and donate them profusely in land and cash. Bhima's ill-equipped and untrained army of peasants and commoners were no match for the consolidated army of Palas, Rashtrakutas  and more than a dozen samantas. After regaining Varendra Ramapala built temples of Bhavani and Shiva to pacify the Kaivartas; He also had to adopt mild taxation to appease the peasants.\nRyosuke Furui noted:Kaivarta rebellion...was a critical event in the early history of Bengal. It temporarily ousted the Palas from their ancestral territory of Varendra and decisively weakened their control over subordinate rulers. It also paved the way for their fall in the hands of another power, the Senas, who rose after the event.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n* বিদ্রোহী কৈবর্ত খান ব্রাদার্স, ১৯৭০, সত্যেন সেন"
