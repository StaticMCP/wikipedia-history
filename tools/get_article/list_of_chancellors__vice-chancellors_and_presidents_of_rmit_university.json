During this time its chief academic officer was known as its Principal and its chief executive officer was known as its President—who also chaired its Council of Directors. The roles of Principal and President were merged into the single position of Vice-Chancellor and President when RMIT was made a public university in 1992 (by an act of the Parliament of Victoria).\nIts Council of Directors was replaced by a Chancellery of Deputy and Pro- Vice-Chancellors and vice-presidents which is headed by the Vice-Chancellor and President. A board of governors known as the Council of RMIT was also created in 1992 which is chaired by the Chancellor of RMIT (a role also created in 1992) as its Governor-in-Council. The Council consists of the Chancellery, the Chair of the Academic Board and elected members drawn from as and beyond the university community.\nThe council is responsible for the \"general direction and superintendence of the University\". Power over all the academic and administrative affairs of RMIT is then passed to the Vice-Chancellor and President by the Council in accordance with the current Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Act of 2010. The Vice-Chancellor is therefore responsible for the \"conduct of the University's affairs in all matters\".\nThe Vietnamese branch of RMIT also has its own Pro Vice-Chancellor and General Director, which is a role equal to that of the President of RMIT Australia but subordinate to the role of Vice-Chancellor of RMIT.\nThe current Chancellor of RMIT is Peggy O'Neal, AO. The current Vice-Chancellor of RMIT and the President of RMIT Australia is Professor Alec Cameron. The current Pro Vice-Chancellor and General Director of RMIT Vietnam is Professor Claire Macken.\nRMIT Australia\nChancellor\nCouncil President (1887–1991)\n(President, 1911)]]\nofficer (President, 1959–1960)]]\n* 1887–1889  Francis Ormond, MLC (founder)\n* 1889–1899 William Kernot (brother of 1920 President Wilfred Kernot)\n* 1900 Joseph Nixon\n* 1901Frederick Bromley, MLA\n* 1902 C.
