      "text": "# Garston (Liverpool ward)\n\nGarston ward is an electoral division of Liverpool City Council centred on the Garston district of the city. It was created in 1902 where three councillors were elected. It was dissolved in 1953.\nThe ward was recreated in 2023 following a review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which decided that the existing 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Garston ward was reinstated as a two-member ward from the western half of the former Speke Garston ward and the southern half of the former Cressington ward. The ward contains the Port of Garston, Garston Leisure Centre, and the New Mersey Shopping Park.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#FFF\"| 1953 - 2022 WARD DISESTABLISHED\n|-\n| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"#FFF\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Sam Gorst (LCI)\n|style=\"background-color: \"#FFF\"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Lucy Williams (LCI)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\n§Sam Gorst was a re-standing councillor for the former Cressington ward.
