Built in 1915, it is a well-preserved example of a gambrel-roofed barn in Etowah, representative of agricultural practices of the early 20th century in Mississippi County.  It is a rectangular structure, with a central component that is gambrel-roofed, and shed-roofed wings on the sides.  The complex it stands in, built in 1915 by Edward Samuel Wildy, also includes from that period a windmill, silo, and concrete pads and troughs.\nThe barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Mississippi County, Arkansas\nReferences"
