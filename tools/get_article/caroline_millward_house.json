The house was built circa 1906 for owner Caroline Millward. It has an American Foursquare design, a simplified style popular in the early twentieth century, with Prairie School elements. The -story house has a typical Foursquare layout, with a rectangular shape, a front porch supported by wide piers, a glazed porch on one side, and a hip roof with a front-facing dormer. The horizontal emphasis of the design is typical of the Prairie School, as are its bands of windows, wood trim, overhanging eaves, and built-in furniture.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 1992.\nReferences"
