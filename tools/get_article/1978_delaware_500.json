The NASCAR race makes use of the track's standard configuration, a four-turn short track oval that is  long. The track's turns are banked at twenty-four degrees, and both the front stretch (the location of the finish line) and the backstretch are banked at nine degrees.\nRace report\nFive hundred laps were completed on the paved oval track spanning . The race took four hours, eleven minutes, and twenty seconds to complete. Three cautions slowed the race for eighteen laps. Thirty thousand fans attended. Notable speeds were:  for the average speed and  for the pole position speed (accomplished by J.D. McDuffie).\nBobby Allison defeated Cale Yarborough by 11 seconds. J.D. McDuffie won his only NASCAR Cup pole position  while using tires from the McCreary Tire Company. This pole position also secured a spot in the first running of the Busch Clash (now the Sprint Unlimited); Buddy Baker would ultimately win that race in February 1979.\nJabe Thomas would retire from NASCAR after this race. Bobby Allison would gain his 50th career Winston Cup Series victory from this race. Although McDuffie would never win a Winston Cup Series race, his best overall finish would come at the 1979 Sun-Drop Music City USA 420 in Nashville, Tennessee.\nNotable crew chiefs who participated in the race included Darrell Bryant, Junie Donlavey, Buddy Parrott, Jake Elder, Joey Arrington, Herb Nab, Dale Inman, Walter Ballard, Kirk Shelmerdine, and Bud Moore.\nQualifying\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
