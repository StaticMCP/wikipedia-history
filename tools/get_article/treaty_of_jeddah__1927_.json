The treaty recognized the independence of Ibn Saud and sovereignty over what was then known as the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd. The two regions were unified into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.  In return, Ibn Saud agreed to stop his forces from attacking and harassing neighbouring British protectorates.\nThe Treaty of Jeddah also addressed the issue of the Red Sea slave trade of Africans to slavery in the Kingdom of Hejaz. The King formally agreed to cooperate with the British Legation in fighting the slave trade. Article 7 of the treaty explicitly stipulated the right of the British Legation in Jeddah to manumit enslaved Africans seeking asylum, and according to the British Foreign Office, 263 Africans were freed in this way between 1926 and 1938.\nThe Treaty superseded the 1915 Treaty of Darin.\nIt was published in Treaty Series No. 25 (1927), Command 2951 and was slightly modified by two further exchanges of Notes in 1936 (Treaty Series No. 10 (1937) Command 5380) and 1943 (Treaty Series No. 13 (1947), Command 7064).\nSee also\n* Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1880\nReferences"
