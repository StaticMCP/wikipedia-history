The invasion took place from 28 April to 1 May 1676.\nGotland was occupied by Denmark until 1679, when the war was formally ended.\nBackground\nAdministrative history\nDuring the early Middle Ages the island was semi-independent but de jure under the Swedish crown. Visby, the largest city on the island was an important Hanseatic city. In 1361, Valdemar Atterdag of Denmark invaded the island, thus confirming Danish sovereignty for the first time.\nDenmark later bought the island from the Teutonic Order in 1408, and retook the island from Eric of Pomerania in 1449, and from then on ruled by Danish governors.\nBackground to the invasion\nA Danish squadron of 16 warships, led by Niels Juel, were originally to be sent from Copenhagen to Gotland, but when the squadron left the port on 28th of March, it could only count eight Liners, five Frigates, three smaller ships,  two Burners and two Galiots with an additional 628 guns.\nA grounding on Amager initially delayed the squadron. They first reached Rügen at Hiddensee, a then Swedish island. After taking some cattle, they left for Gotland.\nOn the 22th of April, they intercepted two Swedish warships between Bornholm and Hanö, they burned the ships, yet also took over the ships. After Juel had received intelligence, which indicated the island could be conquered, his squadron landed near Visby which was defended by 600 men.\nAction\nCol. Barthold landed his troops, with coverage of his ships cannon fire, near Visby. The Swedish governor concentrated his troop at the Danish landing place, but they suffered greatly by the cannon fire. Barthold met only weak resistance, thanks to the important help of the cannons, whereby the Swedish troops retreated back to Visby.\nSome Gotlanders, which had 30 years prior had been a part of Denmark, were celebrating the invasion, and helped them open the Visby city gates by horses. This meant further retreatment to Visborg by the Swedes. Juel, had Rear admiral, Peter Morsing, to fire at Visborg with the three ships of Gylden-løve, Delmenhorst and Havfruen. Yet on the same day the Swedish commander of Visborg capitulated.\nAftermath\nEight days after the conquest, Niels Juel became governor of Gotland, while major Bilenberg were commander at Visborg with 529 men. A Danish battalion were also established in the beginning of June 1676, and three companies with 600 men each, were conscripted among the islands population\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFootnote\nReferences"
