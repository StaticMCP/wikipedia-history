Traditionally held the Saturday before the Academy Awards, the 2022 date marks a shift in the season, placing the Spirit Awards squarely in the corridor leading into Oscar voting. The nominations were announced on December 14, 2021, by actresses Beanie Feldstein, Regina Hall, and Naomi Watts. Returning to an in-person ceremony this year, the event was televised in the United States on IFC and streamed exclusively for subscribers by AMC+. Married couple Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman hosted the ceremony.\nThe grant recipients for the Emerging Filmmakers Awards were announced on February 10, 2022.\nWinners and nominees\nFilm\n, Best Feature co-winner, and Best Director and Best Screenplay winner]]\n, Best Male Lead winner]]\n, Best Female Lead winner]]\n, Best Supporting Male winner]]\n, Best Supporting Female winner]]\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Best Feature\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Best Director\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\nThe Lost Daughter\n* A Chiara\n* ''C'mon C'mon\n* The Novice\n* Zola\n| valign=\"top\" |\n'Maggie Gyllenhaal – The Lost Daughter'\n* Janicza Bravo – Zola\n* Lauren Hadaway – The Novice\n* Mike Mills – C'mon C'mon\n* Ninja Thyberg – Pleasure\n|-\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Best Male Lead\n! style=\"width=50%\" | Best Female Lead\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n'Simon Rex – Red Rocket as Mikey Saber'\n* Clifton Collins Jr. – Jockey as Jackson Silva\n* Frankie Faison – The Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain as Kenneth Chamberlain Sr.\n* Michael Greyeyes – Wild Indian as Makwa\n* Udo Kier – Swan Song as Pat Pitsenbarger\n| valign=\"top\" |\n'Taylour Paige – Zola as Aziah \"Zola\" King'\n* Isabelle Fuhrman – The Novice as Alex Dall\n* Brittany S.
