The company's Joel Billings noted that playtesting World at War was relatively simple: \"In WitP the longest scenario can last around 1700 turns, while GGWaWs longest scenario lasts around 25 turns\". It reached gold status in February 2005.\nReception\n| IGN = 8.5/10\n| CGM =\n|PCZone = 77/100\n| CGW =\n}}\n''Gary Grigsby's World at War received \"generally favorable reviews\" from critics, according to Metacritic. Writer Greg Costikyan reported that the game had sold over 100,000 units by 2008.\nIn Computer Games Magazine, Bruce Geryk was unimpressed with World at War. He called it \"a claustrophobic game in which there are only one or two ways to win ... and what matters is how carefully you count the combat factors needed to succeed.\" Anthony Holden of PC Zone was more positive, referring to it as \"a superior piece of work\" hampered by its inaccessibility to newcomers. Computer Gaming Worlds Di Luo concluded, \"Even with its flaws, World at War is still a good choice for anyone looking for a fast-paced war game.\"\nIGN presented World at War with its 2005 \"Best Game No One Played\" computer game award. The editors wrote that it \"really shines in its excellent simulation of supply and logistics.\"\nA World Divided\nIn October 2006, World at War received a follow-up under the name Gary Grigsby's World at War: A World Divided. According to Joel Billings, it had begun as a patch but became ambitious enough for a full release; production began in January 2006. Among other updates, the game includes greater support for espionage and diplomacy, and enables a hypothetical conflict between the Soviet Union and Allied Western powers.\nReception\nReviewing A World Divided for IGN, Steve Butts wrote, \"Gamers who are looking for an introduction to high-level wargames should definitely consider giving this one a look.\" Wargamer''s Al Berke called it \"an excellent game\" that \"has a historical feel, but doesn't drown the players in a sea of detail.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
