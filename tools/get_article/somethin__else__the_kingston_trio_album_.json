      "text": "# Somethin' Else (The Kingston Trio album)\n\n}}\n'Somethin' Else' is an album by the American folk music group the Kingston Trio, released in 1965 (see 1965 in music). It was the first Kingston Trio principal album to miss the charts completely. The lead-off single was \"Parchment Farm\" b/w \"Runaway Song\".\nBackground\nThe liner notes mention the \"amazing new sound\" of the Kingston Trio, referring to the use of a backing band on this release. The trio's arrangement of Bukka White's \"Parchman Farm\" (here called \"Parchment Farm Blues\") is based on Mose Allison's version.\nReception\n| rev2      = Record Mirror\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nIn his Allmusic review, music critic Bruce Eder compared the Trio's sound to the folk-rock acts taking over the airwaves. He wrote of the album \"Not wishing to be left behind, the Kingston Trio decided to go the same route on their third Decca album, Somethin' Else. The result was an awkward but sometimes quite beautiful hybrid... On the other hand, there were sides that didn't sound much like the Kingston Trio at all, most notably \"Parchment Farm Blues\" (which, astonishingly, became the single off the album), with its up-front percussion and organ-dominated accompaniment, which came off like the work of some L.A. garage band parodying the Kingston Trio.\"\nReissues\n*''Somethin' Else has not been reissued on CD.
