Hetman Demian Mnohohrishny, appointed by Petro Doroshenko at the head of the Seversk regiments, stood in September 1668 with an army near Sednev, while the Russian army led by Grigory Romodanovsky assaulted Chernihiv.\nDue to the fact that Romodanovsky's 24,000-strong army was significantly larger than the forces at the disposal of the Mnohohrishny, the latter did not dare to assist the besieged led by Ivan Samoilovich and waited for help from Doroshenko, which he almost did not provide.\nHaving taken the main part of Chernigov and unblocked the Russian garrison there, Romodanovsky sent part of the troops under Sednev, led by his son stolnik Andrey Romodanovsky. Mnohohrishny with \"Cherkassy and Volokhi and Tatars with many\" went out to meet the Russian army and a battle took place between them, as a result of which the army of the Mnohohrishny was put to flight.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
