A task force has been established with representation from the departments of agriculture, state beekeeping organizations, and land-grant universities from each of the following states: New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\nMAAREC has been researching alternatives to chemical controls and promotion of less reliance on chemical pesticides for mite control.  MAAREC's Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group is investigating colony collapse disorder.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*Beekeeping Basics: MAAREC, ([https://books.google.com/books?id=UPqsHAAACAAJ Google Books]), By Clarence H.
