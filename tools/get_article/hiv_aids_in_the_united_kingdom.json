As of year-end 2018, 160,493 people have been diagnosed with HIV in the United Kingdom and an estimated 7,500 people are living undiagnosed with HIV. New diagnoses are highest in gay/bisexual men, with an estimated 51% of new diagnosis reporting male same-sex sexual activity as the probable route of infection. Between 2009 and 2018 there was a 32% reduction in new HIV diagnosis, attributed by Public Health England (PHE) to better surveillance and education. PHE has described an \"outbreak\" in Glasgow amongst people who inject drugs, and has campaigns targeting men who have sex with men in London and other major cities. London was the first city in the world to reach the World Health Organization target for HIV, set at 90% of those with HIV diagnosed, 90% of those diagnosed on HAART and 90% of those on HAART undetectable. The UK as a whole later achieved the same target. Under the Equality Act 2010, it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on their HIV status in the UK.\nDemographics\nIn 2017, 93,385 people (64,472 men and 28,877 women) living with diagnosed HIV infection received HIV care in the UK. 42,739 of those are gay or bisexual.\nIn 2017, the prevalence of HIV in the United Kingdom was estimated at 101,600 (credible interval 99,300 to 106,400) with  92% (credible interval 88 to 94%) diagnosed. Prevalence is highest in gay/bisexual men in London with an estimated 83 (credible interval 73 to 96) per 1000 gay and bisexual men aged 15 to 74 years. HIV prevalence in this group was higher in London compared with the rest of England (134/1,000 CrI 113 to 156 and 63/1,000 CrI 53 to 76, respectively). However, the 2017 statistics showed a tremendous decrease in the number of newly HIV infected gay men during 2015-17. The number of newly HIV infected gay men decreased by a third in just two years.\n2995 people were newly diagnosed during 2021   An estimated 42% of diagnoses were late (likely to have been living with the virus for over three years). Late diagnosis is associated with a 10-fold increase in the chance of death during the first year after diagnosis. Risk groups have been identified by various organisations, including National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, National Health Service and the IMPACT trial for pre-exposure prophylaxis. They are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Risk groups identified by UK health organisations\n!NHS for HIV\n!NICE for HIV testing\n!IMPACT for PrEP access\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |From a country with high rates of HIV\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Heterosexual people at risk\n|-\n|People who share needles\n|People who inject drugs\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |People who have received a blood transfusion abroad\n|-\n|Heterosexual with black African ethnicity\n|\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Men who have sex with men\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Trans women who have sex with men\n|Trans men and trans women\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |People who participate in chemsex\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |People diagnosed with any other STI\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Sexual contact with any other risk group\n|HIV-negative people with HIV-positive partners\n|}\nTreatment and prognosis\nHIV treatment is available free of charge in the UK and as a result 96% of diagnosed are receiving treatment and of those 94% have a suppressed viral load making them very unlikely to pass on the infection. In 2015, less than 1% of people living with a diagnosed HIV infection in the UK died (cause of death is uncertain and may not be HIV-related). All-cause mortality for ages 15–59 in people living with HIV was 5.7 per 1000 compared to 1.7 for the UK population as a whole. People newly diagnosed with HIV today can expect to have a normal life expectancy if they are diagnosed on time and on effective treatment.\nIn 2017, 39% adults seen for HIV care were 50 years of age or older. This is partly due to improvements to life expectancy for people living with HIV as well as increasing numbers of people acquiring HIV later in life.\nPre-exposure prophylaxis\nAccess to pre-exposure prophylaxis (\"PrEP\"), using a drug which can prevent HIV infection, on the National Health Service is partially limited. It was available to high-risk individuals in England through the IMPACT trial, which had a cohort size of 26,000. This was made available following the PROUD trial, a randomised control trial and a high-court battle in 2016. Use of PrEP in London, both as part of a trial and from private purchases, was partially credited in a drop in diagnoses among men who have sex with men, after a five-year plateau in diagnoses.\nIn Scotland,  England,  Wales and  Northern Ireland PrEP is available free on the NHS from sexual health clinics for those deemed at high risk of acquisition.\nSexual health specialist Mags Portman was credited in making PrEP more accessible to gay and bisexual men in the UK. In October 2018, the Terrence Higgins Trust established the Mags Portman PrEP Access Fund to provide PrEP to those in England and Northern Ireland who cannot afford it. The fund has a maximum size of 1,000 users and was available until the end of 2020.\nTimeline\n1979, June: a sample shows a UK transmission to a haemophiliac in the UK.\n1981, 12 December: The Lancet publishes a case report of a 49-year-old man who had died in Brompton hospital due to an AIDS related illness in October - the first death in the UK.
