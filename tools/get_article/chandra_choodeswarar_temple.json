This is in reference to the green plants and trees (Photosynthesis), which provide sustenance to all living beings.\nTemple history\nThe exact history of the temple as to when it was consecrated is not clearly documented. Considering that the Hosur region is mentioned in ancient Hindu texts like the 'Bhadragiri Mahatmyam', a part of Brahmanda Purana, a shrine for Shiva is deemed to have existed here from ancient times.\nThe temple has grown during the time of the Cholas, Hoysala and Vijayanagara Emperors. The Chandra Choodeshwara Temple structure may have been built by the Hoysala king, Thirupuvanamalla Barvatharaja Anthiyazhvar, in the year 1260. The 13th-century inscription found during Chandra Choodeshwara temple patronage Perumal Temple in Hosur and Bangalore Shiva Temple inscriptions tell the details of donations to Chandra Choodeshwara temple. There are also inscriptions of Rajendra Chola in this ancient temple. The temple was renovated by Azhakiya Perumal Aathimoolam.\nIn popular culture\nThe Chandra Choodeshwarar Temple has been the subject of documentary in an episode of TV9's series Heegu Unte in 2013.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
