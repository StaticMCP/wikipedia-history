The sculptor was George Frampton, and the architect working with him was Leonard Stokes.  The figure on the top of the pedestal is that of Queen Victoria sitting on a throne, with a sceptre resting on her right forearm, and holding an orb in her left hand.}}  The back of the throne has the appearance of a radiant Sun.  On the sides of the pedestal are figures in niches, that on the left representing Peace, and that on the right representing Industry.  On the front of the plinth are carved the Royal Arms, and on the back is the coat of arms of Leeds and an inscription.  Beneath the pedestal is a plinth with a continuous frieze incorporating the words \"INDIA\", \"AUSTRALIA\", \"CANADA\", and \"AFRICA\" on scrolled plaques that are flanked by owls and foliage.  The plinth stands on four steps.\nThe memorial was unveiled on 27&nbsp;November 1905, and originally stood outside Leeds Town Hall.  It was moved to Woodhouse Moor in 1937.  The memorial was designated as a Grade&nbsp;II* listed building on 5&nbsp;August 1976.}}\nDuring the wave of George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom, it was reported on 9 June 2020 that the statue had been vandalized by painting with slogans such as 'racist', 'colonizer', 'justice', \"BLM\" (Black Lives Matter) and 'slave owner' (although slave ownership in the British Empire had been abolished in 1833, four years before she ascended the throne).\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Leeds\n*Listed buildings in Leeds (Hyde Park and Woodhouse)\nNotes and references\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
