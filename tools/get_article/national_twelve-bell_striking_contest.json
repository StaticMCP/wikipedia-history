It has been held annually since 1975, and is open to any tower where 12-bell ringing is practised regularly. The winners of the competition are awarded the Taylor Trophy.\nIn recent years the competition has become more regimented; it is now common practice that eliminators are held in good time before each year's final, and that all teams must qualify in the eliminators to compete in the final (with the occasional exception of teams representing host towers). The eliminators are usually held in March, all on the same day, and the final is usually held on the fourth Saturday in June.\nThe 2006 competition was featured in the Marcus Brigstocke BBC television programme Trophy People.\nPast Results\n2015 competition\nThe final of the 2015 contest was held at St Peter Mancroft, Norwich on 27 June 2015.\nThe results of the final are listed below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
