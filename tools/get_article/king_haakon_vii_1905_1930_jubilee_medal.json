The medal has been conferred upon 397 people.\nDescription\nThe King Haakon VII 1905–1930 Jubilee Medal is made of silver and is 33&nbsp;mm in diameter. The obverse depicts King Haakon VII with the inscription \"HAAKON • VII •  NORGES • KONGE •\" (Haakon VII King of Norway). The reverse shows the royal monogram. The medal was created by the engraver Ivar Throndsen. The medal is fitted to a royal crown and hangs from a red medal ribbon. The medal ribbon has a silver clasp reading \"1905–1930.\"\nLater the  King Haakon VII 1905–1955 Jubilee Medal (), the King Haakon VII Commemorative Medal (), and the King Haakon VII Centennial Medal () were given the same design as the King Haakon VII 1905–1930 Jubilee Medal, but the ribbon clasps and inscriptions were modified to match the occasions they marked.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://medalj.nu/ribbon_info.asp?build=&showgroups=A-Z/100/no&visitor=%7BFB25C088-BF46-4DE4-B6B9-D90585815724%7D&listmode=0&medal=%7BFD118F92-123C-43F8-95D9-58F729EE8687%7D Photo of the King Haakon VII 1905–1930 Jubilee Medal]"
