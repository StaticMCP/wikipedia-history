These processes came about at different periods and world regions starting in the 17th century (Portugal).\nIndependence waves\nSince its beginnings in the 16th century, the Spanish empire conquered new areas starting out from its Castilian core kingdom. In 1597, the Spanish (Castilian) crown lost the Netherlands (Holland). In 1640, Portugal split away after Philip II had incorporated it to its domains in 1581. A second independence tide came about following the Independence of the Thirteen Colonies in North America and the Battle of Trafalgar that heralded the end of the Spanish Atlantic hegemony. Venezuela (1811), under the influence of the Basque Enlightenment, sparked the independence movements of Central and Southern America, spearheaded by Simon Bolivar.\nDuring the Spanish Restoration in the late 19th century, the last major overseas territories Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Philippines detached from the metropolis with the support of the United States during the Spanish–American War in 1898. Since the 1950s, Spain lost the last continental lands in Africa, Spanish protectorate in Morocco, Ifni, Equatorial Guinea and Western Sahara.\nCurrent countries/territories\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Modern country\n!Pre-independence name\n!Year of Independence\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Part of the Kingdom of Sicily\n|1530\n|Agreement between Charles V and the Order of Malta\n|-\n|\n|Spanish Netherlands\n|1581\n|Originally referred to as the Dutch Republic\n|-\n|\n|Kingdom of Portugal\n|1640\n|Previously in a personal union with Castile\n|-\n|\n|Province of Paraguay\n|1811\n|Independence recognized in 1842\n|-\n|\n|Captaincy General of Venezuela\n|1811\n|Achieved real independence from Colombia in 1830\n|-\n|\n|Viceroyalty of New Granada\n|1813\n|Originally referred to as the United Provinces of New Granada\n|-\n|\n|Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata\n|1816\n|Originally referred to as the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata\n|-\n|\n|Captaincy General of Chile\n|1818\n|Also previously known as the Kingdom of Chile\n|-\n|\n|Kingdom of Quito\n|1820\n|Originally referred to as the Free Province of Guayaquil\n|-\n|\n|Province of Costa Rica\n|1821\n|Initially as part of the Federal Republic of Central America\n|-\n|\n|Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo\n|1821\n|Achieved real independence from the Spain in 1865\n|-\n|\n|Province of San Salvador\n|1821\n|Initially as part of the Federal Republic of Central America\n|-\n|\n|Kingdom of Guatemala\n|1821\n|Originally referred to as the Federal Republic of Central America\n|-\n|\n|Province of Comayagua\n|1821\n|Initially as part of the Federal Republic of Central America\n|-\n|\n|Viceroyalty of New Spain\n|1821\n|Originally referred to as the Empire of Mexico\n|-\n|\n|Province of León\n|1821\n|Initially as part of the Federal Republic of Central America\n|-\n|\n|Province of Panama\n|1821\n|Initially as part of the Republic of Colombia\n|-\n|\n|Viceroyalty of Peru\n|1821\n|Independence achieved in 1824\n|-\n|\n|Real Audiencia of Charcas\n|1825\n|Originally referred to as the State of Upper Peru\n|-\n|\n|Province of Montevideo\n|1825\n|Fought against Spain, Brazil and Argentina for independence\n|-\n|\n|Captaincy General of Cuba\n|1898\n|Detached from Spain by way of the Treaty of Paris in 1898, becoming a protectorate of the United States.
