Efforts were made in many directions, primarily in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. In total, Ukraine advanced 17 kilometres but suffered heavy casualties in the process. Western officials have said that such losses were not unexpected for attacking forces. Newsweek estimated Russian forces to have suffered 11,000 casualties during the counteroffensive. The counteroffensive was widely regarded as a crucial moment in the war but also as a failure for Ukrainian forces.\nUkrainian forces\n*  Ukrainian Ground Forces\n**  9th Army Corps - Maj. Gen.
