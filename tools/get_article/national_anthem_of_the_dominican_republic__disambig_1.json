In 1883, he invited his friend Emilio Prud'Homme to write lyrics for the anthem.\nThe first version of Prud'Homme's lyrics was published in the weekly newspaper El Eco de la Opinion on 16 August 1883, and the first public performance of the anthem took place the next day on 17 August in Respectable Hope Lodge No. 9 in Santo Domingo. Though the music was an instant success, several objections were made to the lyrics for having various historical inaccuracies. In 1897, Prud’Homme submitted revised lyrics, which stand to this day.\nOn 7 June 1897, the Congress of the Dominican Republic passed an act adopting \"Himno Nacional\" with the original music and revised lyrics as the country's official national anthem; however, then-President Ulises Heureaux (1846–1898) vetoed the act, because the lyric's author, Prud’Homme, was an opponent of the president and his administration. In 1899, Heureaux was assassinated, and the political disorder that ensued prevented the national anthem's legal adoption until 30 May 1934, when \"Himno Nacional\" was officially adopted and signed into law.\nLyric\nThe Spanish name of the Dominican Republic, \"\", is never used in the anthem's official Spanish lyrics, nor is the demonym for Dominicans, \"\". Rather, the indigenous word for the island of Hispaniola, \"\", is used twice, and its derivative demonym, \"\", is used once. However, research later showed that these words do not seem to derive from the original Arawak Taíno language.\nIn public, the national anthem is usually performed through the end of the lyric's fourth paragraph.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Spanish original\n!English translation\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\"\n|\n|I\nBrave Quisqueyans, let us raise\nOur song with vivid emotion,\nAnd let’s show to the face of the Earth\nOur unconquered, glorious banner.\nHail, the people who strong and intrepid,\nInto war launched itself set to die\nWhen in a warring challenge to the death\nIts chains of slavery cut off.\nNo people deserves to be free\nIf it’s an indolent and servile slave;\nIf in its chest doesn't grow the flame\nthat forged the virile heroism.\nBut Quisqueya the brave and indomitable\nAlways proudly her forehead will raise\nFor if she were a thousand times a slave\nThis many times will she be free.\nII\nAnd if fraud and cunning exposed her\nTo disdain of an intrusive man,\nLas Carreras! Beler!...were fields\nWhich covered in glory were seen.\nAt the top of heroic bastion,\nWord of the free was materialized,\nWhere the genius of Sanchez and Duarte\nTaught to be free or to die.\nAnd if an inconsiderate ruler\nCould tarnish the glow of such glories,\nThe war banner of fire was seen\nWaving over Capotillo.\nAnd the fire that leaves stunned\nThe arrogant lion from Castile,\nPulls it away from the glorious beaches\nWhere the crossed banner floats.\nIII\nCompatriots, let’s hold our\nForehead high, like never before;\nFor Quisqueya will be destroyed\nBut it will never again be enslaved.\nThat every chest is a shrine of love\nWhere one feels the homeland alive;\nIt is the law her invincible shield;\nIt is her motto be free or die.\nLiberty that serenely stands up\nVictory in her triumphal carriage.\nThe trumpet of war still resounds\nProclaiming her immortal glory\nFreedom! Let the echoes agitate\nWhile full of noble anxiety\nOur battlefields of glory reverb these words -\nFreedom! Freedom! Freedom!\n|}\nOthers\nExternal links\n* [http://www.szbszig.atw.hu/dominican%20republic.htm Ceremonial performance of the Dominican Republic's national anthem]\n* [http://users.atw.hu/szbszig/dominican%20republic.mp3 Vocal]"
