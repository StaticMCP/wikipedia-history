      "text": "# Draft:Battle of Jones Creek\n\nThe Battle of Jones Creek was a battle in 1824, where State of Texas leader, Stephen F. Austin, sent a group of 23 men to the lower Brazos area to fight and disperse a group of Karankawa Indians who had established a camp there. Fifteen Indians were killed and the rest fled the area toward the coast and eventually into what is now Mexico.\nAfter a fight occurred on June 21, 1824 between area settlers and the Karankawa Indians, Austin ordered Captain Randal T. Jones to lead the Army soldiers to attack the encampment of 30 Karankawas on the banks of the Brazos on June 22, 1824.\nThe Texas Historical Marker makes note that Jones’ men killed 15 of the Karankawas and dispersed the rest across the San Bernard River.\nThis area would later become the Village of Jones Creek in Brazoria County, Texas, having been named after Capt. Jones.\nCapt. Jones’s men attacked the encampment of 30 Karankawas on the banks of what is now Jones Creek in southern Brazoria County. According to the state historical marker, Jones's muskets took down 15 of the Karankawas and dispersed the rest across the San Bernard River, but not without losses on his side: among several other casualties, one of Brit Bailey's sons fell to a Karankawa spear.\nReferences"
