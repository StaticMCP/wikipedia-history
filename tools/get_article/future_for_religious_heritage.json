Not to be confused with the Ferryhill Railway Heritage Trust  (FRHT). FRH is a member of the European Heritage Alliance 3.3, an informal European sectoral platform. The association was a stakeholder of the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018.\nPurpose\n\"Begun as a grass-roots movement in 2009, the Future for Religious Heritage took shape in 2011 as a network of groups from more than 30 countries, dedicated to finding ways to keep churches, synagogues and other religious buildings open, if not for services, then for other uses.\"\nFRH has an office in Brussels.\nMembers\nIts members include the National Museum of Denmark, the Archbishopric of Prague, Chorus Venezia, Din l-Art Ħelwa, Museum Catharijneconvent, the Department for Cultural Heritage Conservation of the Church of Sweden, the Churches Conservation Trust, the Diocese of London, English Heritage, Friends of Friendless Churches, The Historic Religious Buildings Alliance, Jewish Heritage UK, the National Churches Trust, Scotland's Churches Trust,  [https://centros.culturadecantabria.com/centro-de-estudios-lebaniegos/ Culture Directorate of Government of Cantabria], among many others.\nActivities\nFRH bring the voice of the sector to the European Institutions, while also working with its members to facilitate the development of cross border projects.\nThese projects aim to fully exploit the potential of religious heritage in its various aspects:\n* Cultural value\nSacred buildings, their contents and their history represent the biggest single portfolio of Europe's historic patrimony.\n* Social potential\nReligious buildings bind communities together through the worship and non-worship activities that take place within them. They are often the only public buildings remaining.\n* Economic potential\nPlaces of worship attract visitors from afar and from nearby. Religious buildings represent five out of ten of Europe's most visited sites and make a major contribution to tourism GDP.\n* Environmental potential\nTheir physical presence marks the cityscape or rural environment.\nReferences\n* Nederlands Dagblad, \"Kerkgebouwen sleutel Europese identiteit\", 5 June 2014, https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050245/http://www.frh-europe.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/NDagblad-artikel-Churches-Key-for-European-Identity.pdf\n* SIR Europa, \"Chiesa da custodire\", Num. 78 (2134) - 15 November 2013, http://www.agenziasir.it/pls/sir/v4_s2doc_b2.europa?tema=Sir+Europa+italiano&argomento=dettaglio&id_oggetto=274493\n* Reformatorisch Dagblad, \"Veel Europeanen zien belang religieus erfgoed in\", 3 June 2014, http://www.refdag.nl/kerkplein/kerknieuws/veel_europeanen_zien_belang_religieus_erfgoed_in_1_832151\n* Vårt Land, \"Gudshus forsvinner i raskt tempo\", 17 December 2012, https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050146/http://www.frh-europe.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-12-17-Gudshus-forsvinner-i-raskt-tempo.pdf\n* Sustainable Management of Historic Rural Churches, \"Europe Seeks New Action to Save Religious Heritage\", Ann Vainlo, 25 November 2011, https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223511/http://smcproject.org.ee/europe-seeks-new-action-to-save-religious-heritage/\n* KA Norway, \"Fremtiden for Europas religiøse kulturarv på dagsorden i Venezia\", 22 November 2012, https://archive.today/20140818112218/http://www.ka.no/sak/article/131828\nExternal links\n* Official website http://www.frh-europe.org/"
