He was drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the third round, 67th overall, at the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career\nAmateur\nFoegele played at St. Andrew's College from 2011 to 2014, and served as an alternate captain starting in 2013. He was named a CISAA All-Star and team MVP after he helped lead St. Andrew's College to a CISAA Championship.\nDespite accepting his scholarship invitation to the University of New Hampshire, Foegele was selected by the Kingston Frontenacs in the seventh round of the 2014 OHL Priority Selection. He ended up joining the Frontenacs while in his second year at New Hampshire, forgoing his collegiate career.\nOn January 2, 2017, Foegele was traded by the Frontenacs to the Erie Otters in exchange for Brett Neumann. Nearing the end of the 2016–17 season, Foegele agreed to an entry-level contract with the Carolina Hurricanes, who had drafted him in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, on March 31, 2017. At the end of the 2017 playoffs, Foegele was awarded the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as the most valuable player of the playoffs.\nProfessional\nCarolina Hurricanes\nFoegele started the 2017–18 season with the Hurricanes' AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers. Foegele was named to the AHL All-Star Game after he led all rookies in goals and was tied for third in the league. Foegele was suspended for one game on March 19, 2018, for boarding during a game against the Binghamton Devils. He was called up to the National Hockey League (NHL) for the first time on March 25. Foegele played in his first NHL game the following day against the Ottawa Senators where he scored his first NHL goal and recorded his first NHL assist in his debut to help the Hurricanes win 4–1. He was sent back to the AHL after playing in two games and recording three points. Foegele was named the Checkers' Rookie of the Year following the team's elimination from the 2018 Calder Cup playoffs.\nAfter participating at the Hurricanes training camp, Foegele started the 2018–19 season with the Hurricanes. Foegele began the season as a winger to Jordan Staal and Justin Williams, collecting five points in the first seven games. However, he experienced a 27-game scoring drought following October 9, 2018, which was snapped in a 3–0 win over the Arizona Coyotes on December 16. The Hurricanes qualified for the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs and played their first round series against the Washington Capitals. On April 18, 2019, Foegele set a new franchise record for fastest postseason goal at 17 seconds, while the Hurricanes would win the game 2–1 to tie the series. On May 3, Foegele recorded an assist and tied Erik Cole's 2002 record for most points by a Hurricanes/Hartford Whalers rookie in the postseason.\nAfter his successful rookie season, Foegele again made the Hurricanes lineup for the 2019–20 NHL season. In a 4–0 win over the Calgary Flames on December 14, 2019, he became the fifth player in Hurricanes/Whalers history to record two shorthanded goals in a game. He ended the shortened season with a new career high in goals, assists and points, ranked tied for fifth in the league in shorthanded goals. As an unrestricted free agent, Foegele signed a one-year, $2.15 million contract to remain with the Hurricanes for the 2020–21 season on November 1, 2020.\nEdmonton Oilers\nduring a game in 2023.]]\nAs an impending restricted free agent with the Hurricanes and unable to agree to terms, Foegele was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Ethan Bear on July 28, 2021. He was quickly signed by the Oilers in finalizing a three-year contract extension on July 31. On December 31, 2023, Foegele scored 5 points in a single game for the first time in his career, with 2 goals and 3 assists in a 7–2 win over the Anaheim Ducks.\nLos Angeles Kings\nAs an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career, Foegele signed a three-year, $10.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings on July 1, 2024.\nPersonal life\nFoegele was born to George and Leslie Foegele and grew up in Markham, Ontario with his older brother Reese. Reese was also an athlete; he previously played junior ice hockey and later lacrosse at Wilfrid Laurier University.\nCareer statistics\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
