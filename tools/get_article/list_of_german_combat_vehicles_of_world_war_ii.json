      "text": "# List of German combat vehicles of World War II\n\nThe German Wehrmacht used an extensive variety of combat vehicles during World War II.\nTanks\nLeichttraktor\nThe VK.31 Leichttraktor (\"Light tractor\") was an experimental German light fighting tank developed in the 1920s under secret conditions. Only four were produced and they were used in the late 1930s and the early part of the war for training purposes.\nPanzerkampfwagen I (PzKpfw I)\nThe Panzer I (Sd. Kfz. 101) was not intended as a combat vehicle but rather to familiarise industry and the army with tanks. By the time production ended in 1937, 1,869 Panzer I hulls had been produced, of which 1493 were fitted with turrets. The rest were used as command or training vehicles.\nVariants and vehicles using hull:\n* Panzerjäger I, a Czech 4.7 cm KPÚV vz. 38 anti-tank gun on Panzer I Ausf.B chassis\n* Sturmpanzer I Bison, the 15 cm sIG 33 heavy infantry support gun on a Panzer I Ausf.B chassis\n* Flakpanzer I, a 2cm Flak 38 anti-aircraft cannon on Panzer I Ausf.A chassis\n* kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen, an armoured command vehicle on Panzer I Ausf.B chassis\nPanzerkampfwagen II (PzKpfw II)\nThe Panzer II (Sd. Kfz. 121) was a light tank designed to replace the Panzer I. It was armed with a 20&nbsp;mm cannon, which had some capability against other armoured vehicles. Before the war started, 1,223 had been built.\nVariants:\n;PzKpfw II Flamm, (Sd. Kfz. 122), Flamingo:flamethrower tank (Ausfuhrung A and B)\n;Luchs: Light reconnaissance tank\n;Marder II: 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun on Panzer II chassis (Sd. Kfz. 131)\n;Marder II:captured Russian 76.2&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun on Panzer II Ausf. D/E chassis (Sd. Kfz. 132)\n;Wespe:105&nbsp;mm light field howitzer on Panzer II chassis (Sd. Kfz. 124)\nPanzer 35(t)\nIn March 1939, Germany occupied and annexed the Bohemia and Moravia region of Czechoslovakia taking over the Czech arms manufacturing industries. The Czech LT-35 tank was given the German designation Panzer 35(t), with \"t\" standing for tschechisch (the German word for Czech).\nPanzer 38(t)\nAlso known as: PzKpfw 38(t), Panzer 38(t), Sd. Kfz. 140\nIn March 1939, Germany invaded Czech territory and took over the Czech arms manufacturing industries. The Czech LT-38 tank, then in production, was produced for German use as the Panzer 38(t) (\"t\" standing for tschechisch, German for Czech). By the start of the war, 78 Panzer 38(t) tanks had been produced.\nGermany continued producing the Panzer 38(t) during the war. By early 1942, it was clearly obsolete. However, the production lines were already running, the vehicle was mechanically reliable, and the factory would have had difficulty moving over to larger tanks, so it was decided to find other uses for the Panzer 38(t) chassis for self-propelled guns.\nVariants:\n* Marder 138 (Marder III) = 75&nbsp;mm Pak 40 gun on Panzer 38(t) chassis (Sd. Kfz. 138)\n* Marder 139 (Marder III)= captured Russian 76.2&nbsp;mm gun on Panzer 38(t) chassis (Sd. Kfz. 139)\n* Grille = 150&nbsp;mm heavy infantry gun on Panzer 38(t) chassis (Sd.Kfz. 138/1)\n* Jagdpanzer 38 = 75&nbsp;mm L/48 Pak39 gun on a widened Pz 38(t) chassis\n*Flakpanzer 38(t) = 2cm FlaK self-propelled anti-aircraft gun on Panzer 38(t) chassis (Sd. Kfz. 140)\nPanzer III\nAlso known as: ''PzKpfw III, 'Panzer III', Sd. Kfz. 141\nThe Panzer III was designed as a medium tank, with a high-velocity 37&nbsp;mm gun. Pre-war production was 98 vehicles. During the war, the Pz III was upgunned to a 50&nbsp;mm L/42 gun, then to an even higher velocity 50&nbsp;mm L/60 gun, in order to improve its anti-tank performance. A low-velocity 75&nbsp;mm gun was also fitted (using the same mount as the early Panzer IV), but since the tank was not large enough to fit a high-velocity 75&nbsp;mm gun, production was halted mid-war, although the chassis continued to be used to build assault guns.\nThe Panzer III was the first tank to have a 3-man turret: the commander did not have to double up as a loader or a gunner, so he could concentrate on commanding the tank.\nVariants:\n* Panzer III A-F= armed with 37&nbsp;mm L/45 gun\n* Panzer III F-M = armed with 50&nbsp;mm L/42 or L/60 gun\n* Panzer III N = armed with 75&nbsp;mm L/24 gun, used for Infantry support\n* Panzer III (f) = armed with flamethrower\n* Sturmgeschütz III = Sturmgeschütz 40= Assault Gun armed with 75&nbsp;mm L/24 (A-E), later with L/43 (F) and L/48 gun (F8 & G) (Sd. Kfz. 142)\n* StuH 42 = Sturmhaubitze 42. StuG III with 105&nbsp;mm light field howitzer (Sd. Kfz. 142/2)\nPanzer IV\nAlso known as: PzKpfw IV, 'Panzer IV', Sd. Kfz. 161\nPanzer IV was designed alongside the Panzer III. The Panzer IV was a slightly larger and heavier tank, and with its large calibre low velocity gun, it was designed to support the Panzer III when it met heavy resistance from infantry support. Pre-war production was 211 tanks. Originally armed with a low-velocity 75&nbsp;mm L/24 gun, in 1942 this was upgraded to a 75&nbsp;mm L/43 gun, and 1943 to a 75&nbsp;mm L/48 gun.\nVariants:\n* Panzer IV A-F1 = Panzer IV with 75&nbsp;mm L/24 gun\n* Panzer IV F2-J = Panzer IV with 75&nbsp;mm L/43 or L/48 gun\n* Sturmgeschütz IV = Assault Gun. Superstructure of Sturmgeschütz III on Panzer IV chassis; armed with 75&nbsp;mm L/48 gun (Sd. Kfz. 167)\n* Jagdpanzer IV = Tank Destroyer with 75&nbsp;mm L/48, later L/70, gun on Panzer IV chassis (Sd. Kfz. 162)\n* Sturmpanzer IV Brummbär with 150&nbsp;mm field howitzer on Panzer IV chassis (Sd. Kfz. 166)\n* Hummel = 150&nbsp;mm field howitzer on Geschützwagen III/IV chassis (Sd. Kfz. 165)\n* Hornisse = 88&nbsp;mm Pak43/1 auf Geschützwagen III/IV, later known as Nashorn (Sd. Kfz. 164)\n* Möbelwagen = Self-propelled anti-aircraft. 37&nbsp;mm Flak 43 L/89 on Panzer IV chassis (Flakpanzer IV Sd. Kfz.161/3)\n* Wirbelwind = Self-propelled anti-aircraft. Quadruple 20&nbsp;mm Flak 38 L/112.5 guns on Panzer IV chassis, with armoured turret (Flakpanzer IV)\n* Ostwind = Self-propelled anti-aircraft. 37&nbsp;mm Flak 43 L/89 on Panzer IV chassis, with armoured turret (Flakpanzer IV)\n* Kugelblitz = Self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. 30mm MK 103 twin anti-aircraft gun on Panzer IV chassis, with armoured turret (Flakpanzer IV)\nPanzerkampfwagen V \"Panther\"\nThe Panther, also known as \"PzKpfw V\", \"Panzer V\", and Sd. Kfz. 171, was a medium tank of the German Army in the second part of World War II. Until 1944, it was designated as the PzKpfw V Panther.\nThe production Panther was a direct response to the Soviet T-34, after encountering difficulties fighting the T-34, Colonel General Heinz Guderian (the \"Inspector of Panzer Troops\") suggested simply copying the T-34; although the report of the enquiry recommended that the main attributes of the T-34 - armament, sloped armor and suspension - be incorporated into a new German medium weight tank under the Vollketten 30 project. Two proposals -  by Daimler-Benz and  Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg (MAN) - were examined and the MAN design selected for production.\nVariants:\n* Panther Ausf. D - first production version, armed with 75&nbsp;mm KwK 42 L/70 gun. 842 built\n* Panther Ausf. A - second production version, improved Ausf. D, 2,200 built\n* Panther Ausf. G - additional armour, approx 2,900 built\n* Jagdpanther  - a Jagdpanzer (tank destroyer) design with an 88&nbsp;mm L/71 PaK 43 gun on Panzer V chassis (Sd. Kfz. 173)\n* Panther Ausf. F - a Panther development with narrow front Schmalturm turret, none built\n* Bergepanther = an armoured recovery vehicle, 339 built\nPanther II\nPanther II tank successor tank to the Panther while visually similar, was planned to use a new turret, longer 75mm gun, thicker armour, new engine and different components from the Tiger and Tiger II.\nOnly one chassis was built and was later fitted with an Ausf G turret\nPanzer VI Ausf. E \"Tiger\"\nAlso known as: PzKpfw VI E, 'Panzer VI E', Tiger I, Sd. Kfz. 181\nThe Tiger I (Panzer VI Ausf.H, later renamed later Panzer VI Ausf.E ) was armed with an 88&nbsp;mm L/56 gun. On May 26, 1941 Hitler ordered the Henschel and Porsche firms to design a new heavy tank to be delivered in 1942. Porsche used their existing VK 30.01 (P) Leopard design while Henschel based theirs on their earlier VK 36.01 (H). The Henschel design won the competition and became the Tiger. A few Porsche Tigers were made, with a different chassis and hybrid gasoline-electric powerplant, but these were not as reliable as the Henschel model. Many of the Porsche chassis were converted into tank destroyers, known as Ferdinand then rebuilt as Elefant\nVariant:\n*Sturmtiger was armed with a 380&nbsp;mm rocket.\nPanzer VI Ausf. B \"Königstiger\"\nAlso known as: PzKpfw VIB, 'Panzer VIB', Tiger II, King Tiger, Royal Tiger, Sd. Kfz. 182''\nThe Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger II Ausf. B \"Königstiger\" (Sd. Kfz.182) / VK4503(H) was a heavy tank in the later half of World War II. Armed with an 88&nbsp;mm L/71 gun, the vehicle could perform well in the defensive role on the eastern and western fronts but was an expensive failure for Nazi Germany when used in an offensive role as a main battle tank. The Tiger II combined one of the most capable AT guns of the period with heavy armour, but had an over-burdened engine and lacked reliability.\nVariant:\n*Jagdtiger was armed with a 128&nbsp;mm L/55 Pak44 gun (Sd. Kfz. 186)\nPanzer VII \"Löwe\"\nPanzer VII Löwe was a proposed superheavy tank design. It never left the drawing board.\nPanzer VIII \"Maus\"\nAlso known as: \"Panzer VIII\", 'Maus'\nPanzer VIII Maus was a German 188t super heavy tank. Two prototypes were built and only one prototype got a turret.\nSelf-propelled artillery\n*Wespe - 105&nbsp;mm howitzer built on Panzer II chassis\n*Grille - 150&nbsp;mm heavy infantry gun built on Panzer 38(t) chassis, sometimes wrongly named \"Bison\".\n*Hummel - The Hummel was a self-propelled artillery piece fielding a 150&nbsp;mm howitzer on a chassis that combined features of both the Panzer III and Panzer IV. 714 Hummels plus 150 Hummel ammunition carriers were built from 1943 to 1944.\n*Heuschrecke - The Heuschrecke was a self-propelled artillery piece with a 10.5cm leFH 18/1 L/28 on a Panzer IV chassis. Production never started as it would have affected production of tanks.\nSelf-propelled anti-aircraft artillery\nSeveral types of armored self-propelled anti-aircraft weapons (\"flakpanzers\" in German) were used in the war.\n* Flakpanzer I, a converted version of the, Panzer I tank.\n* Flakpanzer 38(t), based on the Panzer 38(t) light tank\n* Flakpanzer IV, the general designation for a series of vehicles based on the Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tank chassis, including the:\n** Möbelwagen\n** Wirbelwind\n** Ostwind\n** Kugelblitz, in prototype stage at the end of World War II\nAssault guns\nAn assault gun is an armoured fighting vehicle similar to a tank, but typically does not have a rotating turret, and may have an open roof. The removal of the turret allows for a much larger gun to be carried on a smaller chassis. They are not intended to fight other AFVs, but instead directly support infantry during assaults on prepared positions. However they were still often fitted with AT guns to destroy AFVs.\nDuring World War II Germany built many more assault guns than tanks, because of their relative cheapness and simplicity.\n;Sturmgeschütz III\n:built on the Panzer III chassis\n;Sturmgeschütz IV\n:built on the Panzer IV chassis with 75 mm gun\n;Sturmpanzer IV (\"Brummbär\")\n:with 150 mm gun built on the Panzer IV chassis\n;Sturmtiger\n:built on repaired Tiger I chassis, 380 mm rocket projector\nTank destroyers\n;Panzerjäger I\n:built on the Panzer I chassis\n;Jagdpanzer 38\n:built on modified Panzer 38(t) chassis\n;Jagdpanzer IV\n:built on the Panzer IV chassis\n;Jagdpanther\n:built on the Panzer V chassis\n;Marder I\n:built on chassis of captured French and some Polish tanks\n;Marder II\n:built on the Panzer II chassis\n;Marder III\n:built on the Panzer 38(t) chassis\n;Nashorn\n;Jagdtiger\n:based on the Tiger II\n;Elefant\n:The Elefant (Sd. Kfz. 184) used the chassis of Porsche's losing entry for the Tiger I competition. On top of this chassis, a forward-facing 88&nbsp;mm L/71 gun was mounted. A total of 90 Elefants were produced, all in early 1943 and known then as the Ferdinand, after its designer, Dr Ferdinand Porsche. Those still in use in late 1943 were modified and renamed Elefant.\nHalf-tracks\n*Maultier - \"mule\" conversions of trucks to half tracks\n*Sd.Kfz. 2\n*Sd.Kfz. 4\n*Sd.Kfz. 6\n*Sd.Kfz. 7\n*Sd.Kfz. 8\n*Sd.Kfz. 9\n*Sd.Kfz. 10\n*Sd.Kfz. 11\n*Sd.Kfz. 250\n*Sd.Kfz. 251\nArmoured cars\n*Kfz 13\n*Leichter Panzerspähwagen - 4 wheeled armoured cars\n**Sd.Kfz. 221\n**Sd.Kfz. 222\n**Sd.Kfz. 223\n*Schwerer Panzerspähwagen - 6 and 8 wheel armoured cars\n**Sd.Kfz. 231\n**Sd.Kfz. 232\n**Sd.Kfz. 233\n**Sd.Kfz. 234\n**Sd.Kfz. 263\n*Panzerwagen ADGZ - Austrian armoured car used for police work\nArmoured recovery vehicle\n*Bergepanzer III - PzKpfw III chassis\n*Bergepanzer IV - PzKpfw IV chassis\n*Bergepanther (Sd.Kfz. 179) - PzKpfw V Panther chassis 347 produced (1943 to 1945).\n*Bergetiger - PzKpfw VI Tiger I chassis\n*Bergepanzer 38(t) - Jagdpanzer 38 chassis, 170 produced (1944 to 1945).\n*Bergepanzer T-34 - Captured T-34 chassis\nSd.
