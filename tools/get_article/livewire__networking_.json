Its primary purpose is routing and distributing broadcast-quality audio in radio stations.\nThe original Livewire standard was introduced in 2003 and has since been superseded by a second version, Livewire+. Livewire+ includes compatibility with the AES67 and Ravenna standards to allow interoperability with equipment from other manufacturers. Designed as a superset of Livewire functionality utilizing common protocols and formats, Livewire+ is available as an open standard through Axia's Livewire+ Partner Program.\nLivewire+ provides flexible routing and transport of audio streams using multicast networking, with the ability to connect any input to any output (known as \"anywhere-to-anywhere routing\"). Distribution utilises standard IP and Ethernet over twisted pair cabling.\nProtocol\nThe following table lists ports and protocols used in Livewire systems.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
