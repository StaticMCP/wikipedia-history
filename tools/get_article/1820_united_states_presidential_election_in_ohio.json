Voters chose 8 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nOhio re-elected incumbent Democratic-Republican Party President James Monroe by a large margin. Although Monroe ran unopposed, John Quincy Adams received a minority of the vote as an opposition candidate. This is the most recent time a party won every county in the state.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1820 United States presidential election in Ohio\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| James Monroe (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 7,164\n| align=\"right\" | 76.38%\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| John Quincy Adams\n| align=\"right\" | 2,215\n| align=\"right\" | 23.62%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Ohio\nReferences"
