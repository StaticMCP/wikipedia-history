Elevated as a rookie in 1999 AFL season, he made his AFL debut in round 10 that season and kicked six goals against Port Adelaide.\nKingsley was traded to Geelong at the end of the 2000 AFL season. Kent's eight-year AFL career saw him play 125 games for three clubs.\nDuring his time with Geelong, Kingsley became the side's leading goalkicker from 2002 to 2005 and was a key option up forward. However, he was often maligned by fans for his inconsistency and inaccuracy in front of goal.\nDuring 2006, Kingsley was dropped from the side midway through the season despite the Cats' lack of other forward options. At the season's end, Kingsley joined the Richmond Football Club via the 2006 Draft.\nHe played only three senior games in 2007 for Richmond, and he announced his retirement from AFL football on 28 August 2007.\nPersonal life\nIn 1998, Kingsley started his first company (IT web development and database integration) that was bought out by a public software company in 1999. The same year, Kingsley made his AFL debut playing for North Melbourne at the age of 21.\nOff the field, Kingsley has worked as an internet entrepreneur and co-owned a Geelong-based restaurant with fellow Geelong footballers Steven King and Matthew Scarlett called the George and Dragon Hotel from 2004 to 2007, until it changed name and ownership due to financial difficulty.\nKent is currently playing for Glen Orden in the Western Region Football League.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
