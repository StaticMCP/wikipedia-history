In the , Norley had \"no people or a very low population\".\nOn 17 April 2020, the Queensland Government reorganised the nine localities in the Shire, resulting in six localities. This included the discontinuation of Norley, absorbing all of its land into an enlarged Thargomindah.\nGeography\nNorley was part of the Channel Country, a network of interconnecting creeks and rivers that are normally dry except during seasonal flooding. The land was used for low density cattle grazing.\nThe Bundeena Road entered the locality from the west and exited to the south to neighbouring Thargomindah. The Quilpie Thargomindah Road entered the locality from the north-east and exited to the south to Thargomindah.\nHistory\nThe locality of Norley took its name from its county and parish of the same name. The county name takes its name in turn from the Norley pastoral station.\nIn the , Norley had \"no people or a very low population\".\nOn 17 April 2020, the Queensland Government reorganised the nine localities in the Shire, resulting in six localities.
