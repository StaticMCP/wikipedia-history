Reggaeton is a genre that has its roots in Latin and Caribbean music. Its sound derived from the Reggae en Español in Panama.\nThe accolade was first presented at the eleventh Billboard Latin Music awards in 2005 to Puerto Rican singer Daddy Yankee for his album Barrio Fino (2004). The record made Daddy Yankee the first reggaeton act to debut at the top of the Billboard Latin Albums chart and became the best-selling Latin album of the decade (2000-2010) in the United States. Yankee also received the accolade at the 2006 and 2008 awards ceremonies for his albums Barrio Fino: En Directo (2005) and El Cartel: The Big Boss (2007). Don Omar became the second and only other artist to win the award at the Billboard Latin Music Awards of 2007, where his album King of Kings (2006) was awarded. Puerto Rican singer Ivy Queen is the most nominated artist without a win, with three nominations, and the only female nominee. The Billboard Latin Music Awards of 2009 introduced thirteen new categories, one of which, the Latin Rhythm Album of the Year award, replaced the accolade for Reggaeton Album of the Year.\nRecipients\n, winner in 2005, 2006 and 2008]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Performing artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nationality\n! scope=\"col\" | Work\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Nominees\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2005\n| scope=\"row\"rowspan=\"2\"|Daddy Yankee\n| scope=\"row\"rowspan=\"4\"|\n| scope=\"row\"|\n| scope=\"row\"|\n*Ivy Queen&nbsp;— Diva: Platinum Edition\n*Don Omar&nbsp;— The Last Don Live\n*Luny Tunes&nbsp;— La Trayectoria\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"|2006\n| scope=\"row\"|\n|\n*Don Omar&nbsp;— Da Hitman Presents: Reggaeton Latino\n*Ivy Queen&nbsp;— Flashback\n*Wisin & Yandel&nbsp;— Pa'l Mundo\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2007\n| scope=\"row\"|Don Omar\n| scope=\"row\"|\n|\n*Calle 13&nbsp;— Calle 13\n*Luny Tunes & Tainy &nbsp;— Mas Flow: Los Benjamins\n*R.K.M & Ken-Y&nbsp;— Masterpiece\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| 2008\n| scope=\"row\"|Daddy Yankee\n| scope=\"row\"|\n|\n*Ivy Queen&nbsp;— Sentimiento\n*Wisin & Yandel&nbsp;— Wisin vs. Yandel: Los Extraterrestres\n*Zion&nbsp;— The Perfect Melody\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nEach year is linked to the article about the Billboard'' Latin Music Awards held that year.\nThe nationality of the performing artist(s).\nThe name of the performer and the nominated album\nReferences"
