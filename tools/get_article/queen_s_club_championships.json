The event is part of the ATP Tour 500 series on the ATP Tour as well as the WTA 500 series on the WTA Tour (starting in 2025). Since 2025, it is advertised as the \"HSBC Championships\" after its title sponsor.\nQueen's is one of the oldest tennis tournaments in the world, and serves as a grass court warm-up for Wimbledon.\nAndy Murray won a record five singles titles between 2009 and 2016, and a record six championships in total (including one doubles title in 2019).\nHistory\nOriginally known as the London Athletic Club Tournament or officially London Athletic Club Open Tournament established in 1881 at Stamford Bridge, Fulham. In 1885, the tournament was given the title of the Championship of London then later London Championships, and it was held on outdoor grass courts. In 1890, the tournament moved to its current location, the Queen's Club and consisted of a men's and women's singles event. In 1903, a men's doubles event was added followed in 1905 by the mixed doubles competition. In 1915, the addition of a women's doubles event completed the programme. The two World Wars interrupted the tournament from 1915 to 1918 and 1940 to 1945. Between 1970 and 1989, the Championships were part of the Grand Prix tennis circuit. The women's tournament was discontinued after the 1973 edition and from 1974 until 1976 no men's tournament was held. By this point the tournament was known as the London Grass Court Championships. Since 1977, it has been called The Queen's Club Championships. The event is currently an ATP Tour 500 series tournament on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Tour and was upgraded from an ATP World Tour 250 series in 2015. The tournament was voted ATP Tournament of the Year for four years consecutively between 2013 and 2014 when it was an ATP 250 tournament, and between 2015 and 2016 when it was an ATP 500 tournament. It then won it again in 2018 and 2019.\nDuring the 2004 singles tournament, Andy Roddick set the then world record for the fastest serve, recorded at 153&nbsp;mph (246.2&nbsp;km/h) during a straight-set victory over Thailand's Paradorn Srichaphan in the quarter-finals.\nIn 2016, Andy Murray won the singles title for a record fifth time. Seven men have won four singles titles; Major Ritchie, Anthony Wilding, Roy Emerson, John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick.\nAfter a 50 year absence, women's professional tennis returned to the Queen's Club in 2025, with the club hosting a WTA 500 tournament in the first week of the grass court season, one week in advance of the men's championship.\nSchedule\nThe Queen's Club Championships are held every year in June.  They start one week after the clay-court French Open and conclude one week before the start of the grass court Wimbledon Championships, which are held just  away. The equivalent warm-up event for women was the Eastbourne International (until 2025 when it was downgraded to a WTA 250), held one week later.\nUp to 2014, the break between the French Open and Wimbledon was just two weeks, and the Queen's Club Championships started the day after the French Open's men's final. This changed when Wimbledon moved back a week to expand the length of the grass court season.\nGrass courts are the least common playing surface for top-level events on the ATP World Tour. The 2009 schedule included only four grass court tournaments in the run-up to Wimbledon. They were the Queen's Club Championships, Gerry Weber Open, Eastbourne International, and the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships. An additional tournament is played on grass in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, in the week immediately after Wimbledon.\nCoverage\nbeing interviewed after winning the 2012 Queen's Club Championships]]\nThe BBC has covered the tournament since 1979 and in recent years it has shown the tournament in full after originally only broadcasting the final four days of the event. The BBC has a contract in place until 2024. It broadcasts the event mainly on BBC Two as well as on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sport online. It was shown in high-definition for the first time in 2009.\nSince 2018, Amazon Prime has also broadcast from The Queen's Club in the UK.\nThe ball girls for the Aegon Championships are provided by Nonsuch High School and St Philomena's Catholic High School for Girls, two schools in the London Borough of Sutton.\nSponsorship\nFrom 1979 until 2008, the tournament was sponsored by Stella Artois, and thus called the Stella Artois Championships. In 2009, the tournament was renamed the Aegon Championships following a comprehensive sponsorship deal between the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) and Aegon, which also led to renaming of Birmingham and Eastbourne grass court events. In 2018, Fever-Tree began sponsoring the tournament. The online car selling website cinch became the title sponsor of the championships in 2021 and remained so until 2024. On 23 January 2025, the LTA announced HSBC as the new title sponsor of the championships.\nPast finals\nMen's singles\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Year\n! Champion\n!
