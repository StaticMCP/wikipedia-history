For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n13 & 14 Vict.\nThe third session of the 15th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 31 January 1850 until 15 August 1850.\nPublic general acts\nfor making Provision for the Collection of County Cess in Ireland, and for the Remuneration of the Collectors thereof.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Inclosures Act 1850|public|8|17-05-1850|archived=n|An Act to authorize the Inclosure of certain Lands in pursuance of the Fifth Annual General Report of the Inclosure Commissioners for England and Wales, and to confirm the Proceedings in the Matter of the Common Wood Inclosure.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  for granting Relief against Defects in Leases made under Powers of Leasing.}}\n|\n|  for the Regulation of Process and Practice in the Superior Courts of Common Law in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  for the Appointment and Payment of Parish Constables.}}\n| or '''Lord Brougham's Act|public|21|10-06-1850|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for shortening the Language used in Acts of Parliament.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  concerning the Days whereon Fairs and Markets ought not to be kept.|note4= }}\n| or the Greenwich Hospital Improvement Act 1850|public|24|25-06-1850|archived=n|An Act to enable the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital to improve the said Hospital, and also to enlarge and improve the Billingsgate Dock, and widen Billingsgate Street, in Greenwich; and for other Purposes.}}\n|  }}\n| or the Pirates (Head Money) Repeal Act 1850|public|26|25-06-1850|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to repeal an Act of the Sixth Year of King George the Fourth, for encouraging the Capture or Destruction of Piratical Ships and Vessels; and to make other Provisions in lieu thereof.}}\n|  for encouraging the Capture or Destruction of Piratical Ships and Vessels; and to make other Provisions in lieu thereof.\"|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n| or the Police of Towns (Scotland) Act 1850or the Policing of Towns (Scotland) Act 1850or the Police of Towns Improvement Act 1850or Lock's Act|public|33|15-07-1850|archived=n|An Act to make more effectual Prevision for regulating the Police of Towns and populous Places in Scotland and for paving, draining, cleansing, lighting, and improving the same.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  to amend the Laws relating to Loan Societies.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) Act 1850|public|51|29-07-1850|archived=n|An Act for the Transfer of the Equitable Jurisdiction of the Court of Exchequer to the Court of Chancery in Ireland.}}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Factory Act 1850or the Compromise Act 1850|public|54|05-08-1850|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend the Acts relating to labour in factories.|note4= }}\n|  for amending an Act for the Regulation of Municipal Corporations in Ireland so far as relates to the Borough of Dublin.|note4= }}\n|  for exempting certain Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes from the Operation of the Usury Laws.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  for authorizing the Application of Highway Rates to Turnpike Roads.|note4= }}\n| or the Australian Colonies Government Act 1850'''|public|59|05-08-1850|archived=n|An Act for the better Government of Her Majesty's Australian Colonies.}}\n|\n|  for the more easy Recovery of Small Debts and Demands in England, and to amend the same.|note4= }}\n|  for amending and consolidating the Laws relating to the Pay of the Royal Navy.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1850|public|65|14-08-1850|archived=n|An Act for enabling Town Councils to establish Public Libraries and Museums.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| or the Canterbury Settlements Lands Act 1850|public|70|14-08-1850|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act empowering the Canterbury Association to dispose of certain Lands in New Zealand.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  for the Encouragement of the Fisheries carried on from Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions in Europe, and for securing the Return of the Fishermen.
