It was located to the east of Montague.\nThe Community of Lower Montague was incorporated in 1974. The first inhabitants of the Island and the area later called Lower Montague were the First Nations Mi’kmag people who came to the Island seasonally and established summer camps. They called the island Abegweit or \"resting on the wave\". They mostly harvested the richness of forest, field and sea. An Indian burial site reportedly exists along the water's edge and the intersection with the Thornton Road.\nLower Montague formed the major part of  Lot 59, which has a population of 1285 (2006 Census).\nOn September 28, 2018, it was merged with six other municipalities (two towns – Georgetown, Montague, Brudenell, Cardigan, Lorne Valley, and Valleyfield) to create the town of Three Rivers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20120131184900/http://www.lowermontague.ca/site/"
