The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.\nAs of 2025, Mongolia has submitted ten films for consideration, but none of them were nominated.\nMongolian film The Story of the Weeping Camel was the country's first production to be nominated for an Academy Award, at the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film category in 2004.\nSubmissions\nEvery year, each country is invited by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to submit its best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The Foreign  Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nThe first two Mongolian submissions concerned the lives of rural families on the Mongolian steppe, and the closely intertwined life of people and their animals. Both films contained elements of documentary and fiction and used real Mongolian families as their actors. In Weeping Camel, a family attempts to reconcile a mother camel who refuses to nurse its newborn calf, with a traditional musical ritual. In Yellow Dog, a little girl tries to convince her reluctant family to adopt a wild dog.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Mongolia for review by the Academy for the award.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
