For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n4 & 5 Vict.\nThe fourth session of the 13th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 26 January 1841 until 22 June 1841.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for abolishing Compositions for Tithes in Ireland, and for substituting Rent-charges in lieu thereof.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  so far as relates to burning of Houses.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for repealing certain Duties on Law Proceedings in the Courts in Great Britain and Ireland respectively, and for better protecting the Duties payable upon stamped Vellum, Parchment, or Paper.|note4= }}\n| or the Enfranchisement of Copyholds Act 1841|public|35|21-06-1841|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for the Commutation of certain Manorial Rights in respect of Lands of Copyhold and Customary Tenure, and in respect of other Lands subject to such Rights, and for facilitating the Enfranchisement of such Lands, and for the Improvement of such Tenure.|note4= }}\n|  \"for the more easy Recovery of Tithes;\" and to take away the Jurisdiction from the Ecclesiastical Courts in all Matters relating to Tithes of a certain Amount.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  for providing for the Government of His Majesty's Settlements in Western Australia on the Western Coast of New Holland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  for improving the Navigation and Harbour of Tralee in the County of Kerry;
