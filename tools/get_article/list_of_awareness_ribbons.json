Since many advocacy groups have adopted ribbons as symbols of support or awareness, ribbons, particularly those of a single color, some colors may refer to more than one cause. Some causes may be represented by more than one ribbon.\nColors and meanings\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Ribbon !! Color !! First use !!
