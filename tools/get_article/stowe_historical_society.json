It is run by fourteen volunteers, and its president is Barbara Baraw.\nIn 1955, members of Stowe's oldest families convened in an attempt to record and preserve the town's past, for fear its legacy would be lost.\nWith the help of Vermont Historical Society, Stowe Historical Society was formed on April 17, 1956, in the town's Memorial Building. It is now one of Vermont's largest non-profit sources of the state's history. The society is based in two one-room former schoolhouses on School Street, adjacent to another former school, the Helen Day Memorial Library and Art Center. One is the former West Branch Schoolhouse, a district school which was moved to its current location in 2009; the other is the Bloody Brook Schoolhouse, another district school which was moved to its new home in 1909.\nSee also\n* List of historical societies in Vermont\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
