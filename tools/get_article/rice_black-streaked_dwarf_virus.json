The sole transmitter of RBSDV is Laodelphax striatellus, aka the small brown planthopper (SBPH).\nAffected areas\nRBSDV primarily affects regions in East and Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as China, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, and Thailand. Affected countries are dependent on the migration patterns of L. striatellus.\nPreventative actions\nChina has been significantly affected by RBSDV and has implemented various control measures, such as seedbed coverage, chemical seed treatments, and chemical spraying of seedlings. Researchers in China are also actively screening for effective anti-RSBDV drugs and investigating further preventative measures (2013).\nWhile specific measures may not be detailed, we can assume that heavily impacted countries such as Vietnam are taking similar actions.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://phene.cpmc.columbia.edu/ICTVdB/00.060.0.07.007.htm ICTVdB – The Universal Virus Database: Rice black-streaked dwarf virus]\n*[http://www.virology.net/Big_Virology/BVFamilyGroup.html Family Groups – The Baltimore Method]"
