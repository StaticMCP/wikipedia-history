His appearances were limited and only in 1938 was he a regular in the side.\nHe became coach of Tasmanian club New Norfolk in 1947.\nLater, Edwards joined the Fitzroy coaching staff and in the 1961 VFL season filled in as senior coach, due to the absence of Len Smith, steering the club to a win over Carlton.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).
