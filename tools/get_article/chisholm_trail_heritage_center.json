Among other exhibits, it features the Paul Moore bronze “On the Chisholm Trail,” which stands nearly 15-feet high atop its immense base and stretches almost 35-feet across the horizon.  Separate from the museum, Trail Ruts at Monument Hill just outside of Duncan has visible traces of cattle hoofs and wagons actually left on the trail.\nThere are other museums dedicated to the Chisholm Trail in Kingfisher, Oklahoma (the Chisholm Trail Museum), in Waurika, Oklahoma (the Chisholm Trail Historical Museum), in Wellington, Kansas (the Chisholm Trail Museum), in Cleburne, Texas, and in Cuero, Texas.\nReferences"
