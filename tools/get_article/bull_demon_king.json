Painting in the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace in Beijing.]]\nBull Demon King (), also translated as the Ox King, also-known by his self-proclaimed title the Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven (), and as  and as , is a fictional character from the 16th century novel Journey to the West.\nHe is the estranged-husband of the Princess Iron Fan and father of Red Boy. He is a demon king originally-based in the \"Palm leaf Cave/Grotto\" (), up on \"Jade Cloud Mountain\" (), with his wife, before betraying his wife for a younger demoness, Princess Jade-Countenance, a female Huli jing, of the \"Sky-Scraping Cave\" () on \"Accumulated-Thunder Mountain\" ().\nBull King is a major antagonist of the novel Journey to the West by Wu Cheng'en, and its multiple adaptations. He can be considered the main antagonist in the remake of Journey to the West, despite his limited appearances. He also appears as the main antagonist in the 2014 film The Monkey King and ''Doraemon: The Record of Nobita's Parallel Visit to the West. He is one of the most popular Journey to the West villains, alongside his wife Princess Iron Fan, his son the Red Boy, the Six-Eared Macaque, and the Baigujing.\nHe was possibly influenced by Ox-Head, one of the guardians of hell in Chinese mythology.\nIn Journey to the West''\nIn the early chapters of the novel, he becomes sworn brothers with Sun Wukong and five other demon kings, the Saurian Demon King (), the Roc Demon King (), the Lion Spirit King (), the Macaque Spirit King () and the Snub-nosed monkey Spirit King (). He is ranked the most senior of the seven, and styles himself \"Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven\" ().\nHe later meets and marries Princess Iron Fan and they have a son, Red Boy. He appears again in a later chapter when the protagonists arrive at the Flaming Mountains along their journey. Sun Wukong disguises himself as Bull Demon King to deceive Princess Iron Fan and takes away her Banana Leaf Fan. The real Bull Demon King visits Princess Iron Fan, who then realises she has been tricked. Bull Demon King disguises himself as Zhu Bajie to trick Sun Wukong and retrieve the fan.\nIn the ensuing fight against Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie, Bull Demon King reveals his true form, a giant white bull, and attempts to charge towards his opponents. Heavenly forces, including Devaraja Li, his third son, Prince Nezha and the Four Heavenly Kings all show up, with orders from the Buddha and the Jade Emperor to capture the Bull Demon King.  When Prince Nezha fails to vanquish Bull Demon King after repeatedly beheading him (as the Bull Demon King also knew the arts of the 72 Transformations; ; , lit. \"72 Terrestrial Killers\"), he attaches one of his flaming wheels to the Bull Demon King's horns--horrifically burning him and causing him great pain--whilst Devaraja Li uses an \"imp-reflecting mirror\" () to prevent the Bull Demon King from shapeshifting and escaping. After the Bull Demon King is captured, they bring him to Heaven to let the Jade Emperor decide his fate. He is killed after.\nJade-Faced Princess\nThe Jade-Faced Princess ()--or Princess Jade-Countenance--is a female, white-faced Huli jing (a vixen), described as 'lissome' (and compared to legendary court-beauty, Wang Qiang), of the \"Sky-Scraping Cave\" () on \"Accumulated-Thunder Mountain\"/\"Hoard-Thunder Mountain\" ().  Her late father, a 'fox king of ten thousand years', was the previous master of \"Sky-Scraping Cave/Grotto\" and \"Accumulated-Thunder Mountain\" (described as a 'very fine mountain'); when he passed-away with no son, he left everything--his cave/grotto, mountain and a vast fortune--to his only child, Princess Jade-Countenance.  Desirous for a powerful protector, Princess Jade-Countenance would then--2-years prior to her appearance in Journey to the West--after having learned of King Powerful's (the Bull Demon King's) reputation for enormous magic powers, used her equally-enormous inheritance as a dowry to lure him away from his first wife, Princess Iron Fan/Rākṣasī, becoming his second wife/concubine and he (to her mind) her consort over her late father's domain.\nShe proves to be a female who is highly-jealous of her husband's ex-wife and the fact that he continued to acknowledge and pay a maintenance to his ex-wife (in jewels, precious stones, bolts of silk and satin, firewood and rice).  She also proves cowardly, as she is easily scared by Sun Wukong's appearance (when he angrily called her a hypocrite), and by the fact that her sole reason for luring King Powerful/Bull Demon King away from Princess Iron Fan in the first-place was out of desire for a powerful protector.  When Sun Wukong's and Zhu Bajie's fight with her husband reaches her mountain--a day and a night after first meeting Wukong--Princess Jade-Countenance, scared again, sent-out the mountains entire army to aid the Bull Demon King.  Later, when Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie break into the Sky-Scraping Cave/Grotto and overwhelmed the household, her husband, the Bull Demon King abandons her and their entire household to their fates by transforming into a swan and taking to the air.  Her fate is later revealed by Zhu Bajie who killed her--after Sun Wukong first gave chase after the fleeing Bull Demon King--with one swing of his rake, before burning-out the Sky-Scraping Cave/Grotto.\nStatue\nThe statues of the Bull Demon King and Princess Iron Fan have been established at the Flaming Mountains Scenic Area in Xinjiang and have become a popular tourist destination. A statue of the Bull Demon King has been erected at Baima Mountain in Chongqing.\nAdaptations\n* Bowser, the main antagonist of the Mario video game franchise, was inspired by the Ox-King.
