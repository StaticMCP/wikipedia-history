The genre is named in reference to guerrilla warfare due to these techniques typically being used to shoot quickly in real locations without obtaining filming permits or providing any other sort of warning.\nIndependent filmmakers typically resort to guerrilla filmmaking because they do not have the budget or time to obtain permits, rent out locations, or build expensive sets. Larger and more \"mainstream\" film studios tend to avoid guerrilla filmmaking tactics because of the risk of being sued, fined or having their reputation damaged due to negative publicity.\nAccording to Yukon Film Commission Manager Mark Hill, \"guerrilla filmmaking is driven by passion with whatever means at hand\".\nGuerrilla films\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times characterized cult B-movie filmmaker Ed Wood as a guerrilla filmmaker.

El Mariachi, which was shot for around $7,000 with money partially raised by volunteering in medical research studies, won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992. The film, originally intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, was distributed by Columbia Pictures in the United States. Rodriguez described his experiences making the film in his book Rebel Without a Crew.  The book and film would inspire other filmmakers to pick up cameras and make no-budget movies.\nPi, directed by Darren Aronofsky, was made on a budget of $68,000. It proved to be a financial success at the box office ($4.6 million gross worldwide).

The guerrilla-style techniques implemented were used as part of the story itself, to represent the amateur production within the story.  It was shot with a budget of less than $3,000 with a Canon XL2 and a Panasonic AG-DVX100. The director opted out of using a steadicam purposefully to achieve more shakiness. It was awarded Outstanding Lead Actor in a comedy or mockumentary by The 2013 LA Web Series Festival and deemed \"a gonzomentary truly realized\" by Mark Bell of Film Threat.\nSuper Demetrios (2011), the first Greek superhero film, made on a budget of €2,000, won the audience award at the 52nd Thessaloniki International Film Festival with the highest number of votes in the history of the festival and became an instant cult classic, \"proving that Greek guerrilla cinema can survive without state funding injections\" according to Giannis Zoumboulakis of To Vima newspaper.\nIn his debut, filmmaker Tony Olmos made the crime thriller film South of 8 (2016) with a budget of $9,000.
