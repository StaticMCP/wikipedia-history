      "text": "# Battle of Pryor Creek__disambig_1\n\nThe Battle of Pryor Creek was an 1861 battle just north of Pryor, Montana between the Sioux and Crow Native American tribes.\nThe battle began near Sheridan, Wyoming. The Crow heard a rumor that the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho were going to attack a Crow village on the Tongue River. The Crow fled northwest, but the attackers caught up with them at Arrow Creek. Arrow Creek was difficult to cross – a very defensible position. It was one of the largest battles the Crow ever fought, as they had to fight for their nation's existence.\nExternal links\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20070930132750/http://www.frontierheritage.org/arrowcreekbattle.html\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071114172837/http://old.exile.ru/2005-July-01/war_nerd.html Article] by Gary Brecher mentioning the battle\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20240224190433/http://lib.lbhc.edu/about-the-crow-people/history-and-culture/battle-of-pryor-creek.php\n*https://opi.mt.gov/Portals/182/Page%20Files/Indian%20Education/Language%20Arts/Elk_Morning_Battle_of_Arrow_Creek.pdf"
