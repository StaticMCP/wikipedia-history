The awards are created and sponsored by RA Ministry of Culture to appreciate and spur the activities of individuals and creators of various genres of Armenian musical art, as well as to display the significant achievements in the field of music to the broader layers of society. The awards consist of four parts: achievements in classical genre, folk genre, mass pop genre, and special/other awards. During the ceremony artists are given the awards designed by Armenian painter and designer Arman Nur. Each year, the award ceremony airs live on Public Television company of Armenia.\nAward process\nUnlike other Armenian awards, such as the \"Armenian Europe\" Music Awards and \"Pan Armenian\" Entertainment Awards, which determine winners without any nominations, the Swallow Music Awards does have nominees and they are based on the applications that they submit beforehand. The award categories are determined if at least two applications have been received for that category. Classical genre awards are decided by a delegation headed by composer Tigran Mansurian. Folk genre awards are decided by a delegation headed by singer Ruben Matevosyan.
