Until the mid-1990s Smyrna was considered a farm community with a small rural school. The school was built in 1970 to accommodate 2,500 students, but the total student body was about 800 in 1976 - having about 250 graduating seniors. The town has experienced a wave of economic expansion since then. The school was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 1931.\nThe school moved to its current campus on Duck Creek Parkway in 1970 with the opening of the new Smyrna High School, having moved from the former John Bassett Moore High School on South Street. The campus underwent a $61 million renovation in 2006.\nAs of 2017, the Smyrna School District had doubled in population, and as a result Smyrna High School had become Delaware's eighth largest high school, with a greatly expanded academic curriculum and facilities. In 2017, the school started a program for students considering a career in education.\nAthletics\nSmyrna High School competes in the Henlopen Conference of the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association (DIAA), with 42 teams in 23 sports.\nThe boys' school athletics program had historically been known mainly for its wrestling program, but Smyrna's population growth brought greater success in football and other sports.  A dramatic last-second defensive stop gave Smyrna the 2015 Division 1 state football championship in an upset win over Wilmington's perennial state power Salesianum School; Symrna followed up the next year with state championships in football and boys' basketball.\nSmyrna also partakes in the Harvest Bowl, a football contest between the Eagles and Middletown High School. The event was cancelled back in 2001 and was resumed back in 2017.\nState championships\n* Softball: 1993, 2018\n* Track and Field:\n**Boys Outdoor Division II: 1990, 1991\n**Girls Outdoor Division I: 2013\n* Football: 2015, 2016, 2017 2022\n* Basketball (boys): 2017\n* Dual Team Wrestling:\n** Division II: 1993, 1995, 1996, 2003, 2005\n** Division I: 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016\nField Hockey: 2022\nNotable alumni\n* Kevin Fleming (1971), photographer\n* William Carson Jr. (1978), state representative\n* Betnijah Laney-Hamilton (2011), WNBA All-Star\n* Armani White (2014), rapper\n* Nolan Henderson (2017), professional football quarterback\n* Leddie Brown (2018), professional football running back\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
