It opened in 1979 with anchor stores Belk-Beery (now Belk), JCPenney, and Sears.  A later expansion added a new wing and Dillard's store to the center after Westfield Group purchased the mall. The mall is located on Oleander Drive (U.S. 76) and Independence Blvd east of downtown Wilmington. The mall has a food court and no longer features a carousel.\nHistory\nIndependence Mall was developed by a partnership between Philadelphia-based Strouse, Greenberg & Co. and Wilmington-based The Oleander Co. It opened in 1979 with anchor stores Belk-Beery (now Belk), JCPenney, and Sears. A notable feature of the mall was the mosaic murals depicting Wilmington landmarks and landscapes, designed by artist and retired savings-and-loan executive Samuel D. Bissette.\nNew owners and expansion\nIn 1997, the mall was sold to Westfield America, Inc., a precursor to Westfield Group, Westfield's management would oversee a major expansion, which would add a fourth arm to the mall, anchored by a new Dillard's store and including a 400-seat food court. The name of the mall was changed to Westfield Shoppingtown Independence in 1998. In 2005, the Shoppingtown name was dropped, however the signs still have the Shoppingtown name in it.\nIn 2000, Independence Mall Cinemas, a three-screen theater complex operated by Carmike Cinemas, which opened in 1979, was demolished to make way for the new Dillard's wing, which the new store opened on March 16, 2001, while the new wing opened on March 21, 2001.\nOn May 9, 2006, Westfield sold the mall to Centro Properties Group, which its joint venture subsidiary Centro Watt (now Brixmor Property Group) managed the property, and the name of the mall returned to Independence Mall.\nIn 2012, It was announced that the carousel in the center court would be removed after eight years of operation. The same year, Madison Marquette was hired to manage the mall, that lasted until the sale in 2017.\nFinancial issues and redevelopment\nIn October 2014, a $110 million loan on Independence Mall went into default after payments were overdue for more than a month. As of July 2016, a foreclosure auction date had been set for later that month, however the date has continuously been moved in efforts to continue discussions with the loan borrower, Centro Independence LLC. A property appraisal done in December 2015 valued the mall at only $61 million.\nOn June 27, 2017, Rouse Properties (now part of Brookfield Properties) purchased the mall for $45 million and announced the redevelopment of the mall into a modern open-air shopping center and change the mall's name to The Collection at Independence.\nOn April 6, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 24 stores nationwide. The store closed in June 2018.\nIn August 2019, the final plans for the redevelopment of the mall has been approved by the city of Wilmington, and shortly after, the remaining tenants at the former Sears wing have been relocated to the 3 remaining anchor wings, and as a result, the Sears space along with a nearby mall entrance that also used to house Ruby Tuesday, Leland-based San Felipe Mexican Restaurant, and Nikki's Sushi (relocating to Dillard's wing), has been blocked off to make way for the demolition and redevelopment. The current name of the mall will be retained.\nOn October 2, 2020, Five Below held their grand opening in part of the former Sears space.\nOn October 14, 2020, sporting goods retailer, Dick's Sporting Goods announced they would also be opening their brand-new store in part of the former Sears property on October 17, 2020.

It however closed on May 28, 2024.\nOn March 25, 2022, a Dave's Hot Chicken restaurant opened right next to the mall.\nOn August 5th, 2025, 4th Dimension Properties acquired the mall from Brookfield Properties, with the company's principal officer Felix Reznick stating that \"the mall will continue to evolve where families shop and dine, friends gather, and the community comes together\".\nAnchors\nCurrent\n*Belk ()\n*Dillard's ()\n*JCPenney ()\n*Five Below (opened October 2, 2020)\n*Dick's Sporting Goods (opened October 17, 2020)\nFormer\n*Sears () (closed June 2018)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
