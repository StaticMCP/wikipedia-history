The landing of one of the group of Sakaguchi detachment in Cotabato City and made a landing head to Pikit and Midsayap through the Mindanao River on April 28, 1942, made 101st Division commander General Vachon to order Digos Force to retreat towards Kabacan in fear of being cut off as Japanese are now fighting at the vicinity of Kabacan.\nBackground\nWhen Davao City, Davao was Japanese secured on December 24, 1941, at a great cost due to heavy casualties inflicted by the Davao Force under Lieutenant Colonel Roger Hilsman, Sakaguchi detachment under Major General Sakaguchi Kayatake was forced to use his reserves intended for Jolo, Sulu Invasion. He landed his troops in Malalag, Davao southeast of Davao Gulf. General Joseph Vachon, Commanding General of 101st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army ordered Lieutenant Colonel Howard Frissell to setup defense in Digos area and locate the missing forces of Colonel Hilsman.\nJapanese moved west to Padada, Davao where the setup their supply depot where they can attack Digos. Another landing was made by the Japanese along the shoreline from Padada to Digos.\nDefending force\nHe has 3rd Battalion 101st Infantry and 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry. On December 31, 1941, a detachment of three QF 2.95inch Mountain Guns under Captain Manuel Acosta of Philippine Army was arrived to support the force, which gave a little morale booster to the defending force. 3rd Battalion 101st Infantry under Major Arlie Higgins was posted at the south of Digos and 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry under Captain Johnson posted in the north toward Davao.\nJapanese force\nMuira detachment was secluded in Davao City maintaining garrison duty. It did not move towards Digos only in February when battalions from 10th Independent Garrison arrived to replaced them on garrison duty. 2nd Kure Special Landing Force was freed from Legaspi, Albay and landed in Malalag, Davao to free Sakaguchi detachment and moved to Jolo, Sulu. Muira Detachment meanwhile was reinforced by 2 battalions of 10th Independent Garrison in order for them to move to Northern Davao towards Agusan and Digos to link with Kawaguchi Detachment.\nCombat narratives\nMarines from 2nd Kure SNLF landed in the shoreline from Digos to Padada on December 31, 1941. With artillery, tanks, and air support it easily secured a beachhead and made contact on 3rd Battalion 101st which took heaviest pressure. Captain Johnson and his 3rd Battalion 102nd Infantry was ordered to assist the right flank. Captain Johnson was wounded and Captain Acosta commander of Artillery detachment was killed. The Digos-Pikit Junction was lost on this action. A reserve 3rd PC Infantry battalion at center was held it for a while but fled as towards Pikit. Captain Floyd Forte a Visayas-Mindanao Force HQ staff rallied to held the line near the Haley Plantation.\nOn January 18, 1942, Colonel Howard Frissell was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Howard Perry with Major John H. McGee as his executive officer in Digos Sector. 3rd PC Infantry Regiment was replaced by 1/101st Infantry and 1/101st Field Artillery. 101st Special Troops was also attached to the sector to make raids on Japanese positions. First raid in Padada was successful and several warehouses were burned and Japanese supplies were destroyed. However, raiding team commander Captain Nicolas Del Rosario was killed on his wounds.\nIn March Lieutenant Colonel Howard Perry was replaced by his XO Major John H. McGee as he was ordered to be in Mindanao Force HQ in Malaybalay and assumed as Force Personnel Officer G1. McGee was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and 3rd Battalion 101st Infantry was replaced by 1st Battalion 101st Field Artillery (equipped as infantry) under Major Reed Graves. 3rd Battalion 101st Infantry was fighting in the sector for three months since January 1942. 2nd Battalion 101st Infantry was again retrofit and attached to this again under its commander Major John Richardson.\nIn April Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Reed Graves, commander of 101st Field Artillery Regiment. 101st Infantry Regiment units are pulled out to Kabacan and Aroman area in Carmen Ferry Sector. Muira receiving reinforcements took and offensive campaign in coordination with Kawaguchi detachment who just landed in Cotabato City and Parang. Graves forces repulsed Muira assaults twice with mortals and machineguns. However, due to Kawaguchi was able to make a landing head in Midsayap through Mindanao River, General Vachon ordered Graves to retreat towards Kabacan in fear of being cut off. Thus, the operations in Digos sector ended as operations are now concentrated in Kabacan and Carmen sector.\nSurrender of Mindanao force\n101st Infantry Division was still fighting when order from Mindanao Force headquarters reached Division headquarters to surrender at daybreak on May 12, 1942. Digos was the longest campaign in Mindanao during World War II as it reached four months before it was evacuated by 101st Division troops.\nSee also\n* Japanese invasion of Davao\n* 101st Infantry Division\n* 101st Infantry Regiment\n* 102nd Infantry Regiment\n* 103rd Infantry Regiment\n* 101st Field Artillery Regiment\n* Visayas-Mindanao Force\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.west-point.org/family/japanese-pow/ThereWereOthers/ManuscriptLinks.htm There were others], Unpublished Papers of Colonel Hiram Tarkington\n* [https://www.everand.com/book/444866031/Rice-and-Salt-Resistance-Capture-and-Escape-on-Mindanao Rice and Salt], John H.
