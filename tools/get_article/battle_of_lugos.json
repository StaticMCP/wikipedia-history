Sultan Mustafa II ordered the renewal of the attack in Transylvania and his army captured Lipova shortly after. Defending the Banat region and encamped close to Lipova was the Austrian field marshal Johann Friedrich Ambrosius von Veterani (Italian: Federico Ambrosio Veterani, who was born in Urbino), commander in chief of the Transylvanian forces, with an army of 7,000 men.\nBattle\nThe Ottomans advanced from Lipova and clashed with the Christian army; General Veterani was unable to form a junction with the Imperial Army under Elector of Saxony Augustus II the Strong. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. Veterani was taken prisoner by the Turks and beheaded. Captain Strahinja and Antonije Znorić, commanders of the units of the Serbian Militia within the Austrian army, were also killed in the battle.\nAftermath\nThe Great Turkish War continued until the replacement of Augustus by Eugene of Savoy as commander in chief, which ultimately led to the Ottoman Empire's defeat two years later at Zenta.\nReferences"
