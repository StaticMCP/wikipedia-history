It was a strategic Russian success, but tactically the battle ended in a draw. The First Battle of Polotsk should be distinguished from the Second Battle of Polotsk which took place during the same campaign two months later.\nPrelude\nAfter the battle of Klyastitsy and several minor losses, Oudinot's Corps retreated to Polotsk.\nBattle\nIn the early morning of 17 August, the 1st Infantry Corps led by Wittgenstein attacked the French positions near the village of Spas, forcing the French to retreat. Oudinot transported additional units to the sector of the attack and also counterattacked in the centre. By the night both the French and the Russians managed to keep their positions. Oudinot was wounded and had to hand over the command to Gouvion Saint-Cyr.\nThe next morning Gouvion Saint-Cyr undertook a major offensive. He managed to mislead Wittgenstein about the area of the offensive, regroup his troops and suddenly attack the left flank and centre of the Russian positions. In the beginning the offensive was a major success, the French troops crushed the Russians and captured seven cannon.\nWhen defeat seemed imminent, Wittgenstein organized a cavalry counterattack. It caused a scare among the French, who ceased the offensive and retreated. Wittgenstein retreated to the Drissa. Wittgenstein managed with his much smaller force to effectively halt the two French corps advancing on Saint Petersburg. This success later won him the post of Russian general-in-chief.\nCasualties\nFrench-Bavarian losses numbered 6,000 killed, wounded. The Russians lost 5,500. Bavarian general officer losses were heavy. General of Infantry Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy was mortally wounded and General-Major Siebein was killed. General-Majors Vincenti and Raglovitch were both wounded. Among the French, both Oudinot and General of Brigade François Valentin were wounded. Russian Generals Berg, Hamen, and Kazatchkowski suffered wounds.\nAftermath\nGaston Bodart does not give victory to either side; George Nafziger claims that Saint-Cyr \"defeated Wittgenstein's numerically inferior force, but it was an inconclusive battle;\" Dominic Lieven describes it as if it were a strategic victory for the Russians; Hugh Seton-Watson notes that both sides declared victory; Micheal Clodfelter defines it as a victory for the French. For the next two months both the French and the Russians did not attempt to upset the balance of powers.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the French invasion of Russia\n* Second Battle of Polotsk\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
