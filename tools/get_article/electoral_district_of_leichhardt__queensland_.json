Originally a dual member constituency, it was one of the sixteen districts contested at the first colonial election in 1860. It became a single member constituency in 1873 but reverted to being a dual member electorate in 1878. A single member constituency again in 1888, it remained that way thereafter. One of the district's first members was Robert Herbert, the first Premier of Queensland.\nBy the time of its abolition—at the 1932 state election—the district was based on Clermont and Springsure. Its territory was split between the pre-existing districts of Barcoo and Normanby.\nMembers for Leichhardt\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"8\"|Dual member electorate (1860–1873)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term!!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Robert Herbert\n| Unaligned\n| 1860–1863\n|rowspan=\"2\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Charles Royds\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Unaligned\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1860–1864\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"3\"| Gordon Sandeman\n|rowspan=\"3\"| Unaligned\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 1863–1870\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Edmund Royds\n| Unaligned\n| 1864–1868\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| &nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Charles Royds\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Unaligned\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1868–1872\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| &nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"2\"| John Scott\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Unaligned\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1870–1873\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Edmund Royds\n| Unaligned\n| 1872–1873\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|Single member electorate (1873–1878)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Edmund Royds\n| Unaligned\n| 1873–1875\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Charles Haly\n| Unaligned\n| 1876–1878\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"8\"|Dual member electorate (1878–1888)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term!!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| William Sheffield Paul\n| Unaligned\n| 1878–1879\n|rowspan=\"4\"| &nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"4\"| John Scott\n|rowspan=\"4\"| Unaligned\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 1878–1888\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| John MacFarlane\n| Unaligned\n| 1879–1880\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Albrecht Feez\n| Unaligned\n| 1880–1883\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| Charles Dutton\n| Unaligned\n| 1883–1888\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|Single member electorate (1888–1932)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n| William Sheffield Paul\n| Unaligned\n| 1888–1893\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Herbert Hardacre\n| Labour\n| 1893–1919\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Tom Foley\n| Labor\n| 1919–1932\n|-\n|}\nElection results\nSee also\n* Electoral districts of Queensland\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly by year\n* :Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly by name\nReferences"
