IRR has one international interchange, with Chemins de Fer Syriens (CFS) at Rabiya. The system runs from Rabiya southward through Mosul, Baiji, and Baghdad to Basra, with a branch line from Shouaiba Junction (near Basra) to the ports of Khor Az Zubair and Umm Qasr, westward from Baghdad through Ramadi and Haqlaniya to Al Qaim and Husayba, with a branch line from Al Qaim to Akashat, and east–west from Haqlaniya through Bayji to Kirkuk.\nRoutes\nIRR Southern Line\nThe IRR Southern Line, also known as the Baghdad–Basra Railway Line, is the only fully operational rail route in Iraq.  It stretches 550 kilometres to Basra Al Maqal railway station and has a branch line to Karbala and another one from Shoeyba Junction to Um Qasr.\nIRR Northern Line\nThe IRR Northern Line connects the capital of Baghdad with the northern city of Mosul and then to the international interchange at Rabiyaa. The line is currently in reconstruction. A daily commuter train currently connects Baghdad and Samarra, with an extra train on Fridays for pilgrims.\nIRR Western Line\nThe Line connects Baghdad to the phosphate mining village of Akashat. Between 2009 and 2024 the only section in use was the 65-kilometre-long section from Baghdad to Falluja. On October 8, 2024, the connection to the rest of the line finished reconstruction. On October 11, 2024, the first Train departed Ramadi for Baghdad after a fifteen-year hiatus.\nIRR Transversal Line\nThis rail line connects Haditha with the intersection to the IRR Western, over Baiji, where it connects to the IRR Northern, to Kirkuk in the north-east of Iraq. It is the only major route to not run to Baghdad. Currently, only the Baiji-Field-Branch is currently in use for freight service.\nAbandoned routes\nIRR Eastern Line\nThe IRR Eastern Line was the last metre-gauge railway in Iraq connecting Baghdad, Baquba and Kirkuk with Erbil. It closed from 1984 to 1988. It also featured a branch from Jalawla Junction to Khanaqin.\nOther narrow-gauge railways\nMultiple narrow-gauge railways were built in Iraq during the First World War and British Mandate times. They were mostly constructed for warfare and logistics with portable track due to resource constraints. Some temporary routes later became  the foundation for other railways, like the IRR Eastern. Some war time routes include:\n1.Qurna-Amara - 762mm-gauge ()\n2.Basra-Nasiriya - metre-gauge ()\n3.Sheikh Saad-Sinn - 762mm-gauge ()\n4.Baghdad-Radhwaniya 600mm-gauge\n5.Baghdad-Mufraz 600mm-gauge\n6.Baghdad-Table Mountain 762mm-gauge ()\nHistory\n, 1940.]]\nThe first section of railway in what was then the Ottoman Empire province of Mesopotamia was a  length of the Baghdad Railway between that city & Samarra opened in 1914. Work had started northwards from Baghdad with the aim of meeting the section being constructed across Turkey and Syria to Tel Kotchek and an extension northwards from Samarra to Baiji was opened in December 1918.\nFrom 1916 onwards an invading British Military force brought narrow gauge equipment, firstly  gauge and later  gauge from India to Southern Mesopotamia to construct various sections of line to support its offensive against the Turks. Britain defeated the Ottomans and Mesopotamia became a League of Nations mandate under British administration. In April 1920 the British military authorities transferred all railways to a British civilian administration, Mesopotamian Railways.\nThe metre gauge line from Basra to Nasiriyah was the most important section constructed during the war in terms of its significance as part of later efforts to construct a national railway network. Soon after the end of World War I this was extended northwards from Ur Junction outside Nasiriyah up the Euphrates valley with the complete Basra to Baghdad route being opened on 16 January 1920.\nThe other section of metre gauge line built during World War I that had ongoing significance was that from Baghdad East north eastwards to the Persian border. After the war the eastern end of this line was diverted to Khanaqin and the wartime built line north west from Jalula Junction was extended from Kingerban to Kirkuk in 1925.\nIn 1932 Iraq became independent from the UK. In March 1936 the UK sold Mesopotamian Railways to Iraq, which renamed the company Iraqi State Railways. Work resumed on the extension of the Baghdad Railway between Tel Kotchek on the Syrian frontier and Baiji. The through route was opened and completed on 15 July 1940. In 1941 the Iraqi State Railways PC class 4-6-2 steam locomotives were introduced to haul the Baghdad–Istanbul Taurus Express on the Baghdad Railway between Baghdad and Tel Kotchek. From 1941 onwards the UK War Department supplemented ISR's locomotive fleets: the metre gauge with HG class 4-6-0s requisitioned from India and new USATC S118 Class 2-8-2s from the US, and the standard gauge with new LMS Stanier Class 8F 2-8-0s and USATC S100 Class 0-6-0Ts.\nIn 1947 the Iraq Petroleum Company opened a branch at Kirkuk, which it operated with its own Hudswell Clarke 2-8-4Ts from 1951. ISR opened a new metre gauge line from Kirkuk to Arbil in 1949. A joint road and rail bridge was opened across the River Tigris in Baghdad in 1950, finally connecting the east and west bank metre gauge systems. ISR added new steam locomotives in the 1950s: 20 metre gauge 2-8-2s from Ferrostaal of Essen and 10 from Vulcan Foundry in 1953 and 20 more from Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in 1955-56 and 2-8-0s from Krupp, plus standard gauge 2-8-0s also from Krupp.\nIn 1958 when Iraq's Hashemite monarchy was overthrown and a republic declared, ISR was renamed Iraqi Republic Railways. In 1961 IRR began to replace its standard gauge steam locomotive fleet with diesels from ČKD and Alco. In 1972 several classes of steam locomotive were still in service on the standard gauge system, but these were replaced by further classes of diesel from Alstom, Montreal Locomotive Works and MACOSA. IRR did not begin to replace its metre gauge steam locomotives until after 1983.\nIn 1964 IRR extended its standard gauge network with a line from Baghdad to Basrah which opened for freight in 1964 and for passengers in 1968. It has since been extended from Shouaiba Junction to the port of Umm Qasr.\nFrom 1980 until 2003 IRR suffered approximately one billion United States dollars' worth of war and looting damage.\nRolling stock\nIn 1936, the Iraqi State Railways owned 114 locomotives, 8 railcars, 320 coaches and 3,485 goods wagons.\nCurrent (information partly from 2004)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=center|Class\n!align=center|Image\n!align=center|Axle formula\n!align=center|Number\n!align=center|Year in service\n!align=center|Power[hp]\n!align=center|Constructor\n!align=center|Notes\n|-\n|DHS 101–103BB\n|\n|Bo-Bo\n|3\n|1986\n|600\n|Nippon Sharyo\n|Not in service anymore\n|-\n|DHS 111–113BB\n|\n|Bo-Bo\n|3\n|1973\n|600\n|Nippon Sharyo\n|Not in service anymore\n|-\n|DHS 121–127BB\n|\n|Bo-Bo\n|7\n|1982\n|600\n|Nippon Sharyo\n|Not in service anymore\n|-\n|DHS 131–144\n|\n|Bo-Bo\n|14\n|2002–2003\n|1,000\n|Tülomsas\n|8 in service in 2004\n|-\n|DHS 151–162\n|\n|Bo-Bo\n|12\n|2004–2005\n|1,200\n|Tülomsas\n|\n|-\n|DEM 2001–2010\n|\n|Co-Co\n|10\n|1963\n|1,650\n|ČKD\n|5657–5766.

In order to allow interchange with CFS and Turkish State Railways which both use screw couplers, IRR locomotives and most wagons are equipped with screw couplers and buffers. In Iraqi service the buffers do not make contact and the screw couplings hang down unattached.\nDevelopments\nIraq–Syria Direct Railway Link\nIn October 2011 the English version of Al-Arabiya News reported that a link between Syria and Iraq near the city of Al-Bukamal would begin operations in 2012.\nHowever, the link has not been opened, and though plans for a connecting link between the two countries have been floated for a long time, currently the link is only a plan.\nThis route would be more direct than the existing one via the border station at Tall Kushik.\nIraq–Jordan Direct Railway Link\nIn August 2011, the Jordanian government approved the construction of the railway from Aqaba to the Iraqi border (near Trebil). The Iraqis in the meantime started the construction of the line from the border to their current railhead at Ramadi.\nHigh-speed Baghdad–Basra line\nIn 2011, a   line between Baghdad and Basra was planned, with the Iraqi Railways and Alstom designing the route.\nIt started operations since 2014, and at that time not classified as a true high-speed rail. New trainsets for use on the Baghdad-Basra route were unveiled in China in February 2014 before being shipped to Iraq.\nIraq–Iran Basra–Shalamcheh line\nIn December 2021, Iran and Iraq agreed to build a railway connecting both countries. The project would connect Basra in southern Iraq to Shalamcheh in western Iran. There are only around 30 kilometers (18 miles) between the two areas. The railway would be strategically important for Iran, linking the country to the Mediterranean Sea via Iraq and Syria's railways.\nRail links to adjacent countries\n* Iran – one link partially under construction and a second link planned\n** Khorramshahr, Iran, to Basra, Iraq – under construction (2023)\n** Kermanshah, Iran, and the Iraqi province of Diyala – construction commenced.\n* Jordan – partially constructed – break of gauge / gauge\n* Syria – same gauge – at Rabiaa/al-Ya'rubiya\nSee also\n* Arab Mashreq International Railway\n* List of railway stations in Iraq\n* Transport in Iraq\n* Iraq Development Road\nReferences\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n* , general information\n* , map of railway routes in Iraq\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJz4Brg1hIY Iraq Railways Photos on YouTube]\n* Basic technical specifications of Iraqi [https://jdhsmith.math.iastate.edu/term/sliqisr.htm standard] and [https://jdhsmith.math.iastate.edu/term/sliqisrm.htm metre gauge steam locomotives]\n* [http://www.bueker.net/trainspotting/map.php?file=maps/iraq/iraq.gif Map of Iraq railways in 2009] drawn by Joseph Redford\n* [http://www.trains-worldexpresses.com/300/303.htm Taurus Express]—information on passenger trains in Turkey and Iraq from Werner and Hans Soelch's Trains-WorldExpresses site\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/laversentertainers/sets/72157640082863186 Taurus Express 1972]—photos from a trip through Turkey and Iraq in 1972\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/62406743@N05/albums/72157627909406870] Louis Culshaw's photos of MG steam in 1982"
