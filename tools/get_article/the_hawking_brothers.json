They initially started as a duo by the brothers Russell (1931–1976) and Alan (1933–1988). For the five-piece version, the Hawking Brothers & the Wildwoods, they were joined by Joe Attard, Gary Newton, and George Xanthos. Later they reverted to the Hawking Brothers with other members including Peter Hayes and Doug Foley. The group reached the top&nbsp;40 on the Kent Music Report singles chart with \"Catfish John\" (1973) and \"One Day at a Time\" (1978). They played at the Grand Ole Opry in 1975. The Hawking Brothers have won eight Golden Guitar trophies at the Country Music Awards of Australia. In 1989 the Hawking Brothers were inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown.\nHistory\nAlan (7 July 1933–19 September 1988) and his older brother, Russell John Hawking (1 July 1931–2 November 1976), were both born in Mooroopna in northern Victoria. After their mother, Ethel May Hawking (c. 1912–1935), died they were raised separately: Alan in Clifton Hill, Victoria by their maternal grandparents; Russell in Mooroopna by their paternal grandparents. During the late 1940s Alan and Russell attended the Hillbilly Club in Brunswick for basic instruction in country music. The Hawking Brothers performed as a \"hillbilly duo\" and competed for an Amateur Hour prize of £1000 in October 1952 and finished third. The brothers also joined the Trailblazers, a country music troupe, which performed on radio and toured Victoria in the 1950s. They were recorded on the album, The Trailblazers Stage Show (1958) for Planet Records.\nThe Hawking Brothers, with Alan on lead guitar and vocals and Russell on rhythm guitar and vocals, issued a single, \"My Darling Daisy\", on Regal Zonophone Records, in June 1955. In the following year Alan married Diane and the couple later had four children. Another single, \"Please, Baby, Please\", which was co-written by Alan and Russell, appeared in November 1960 via Columbia Records. Ainslie Baker of ''The Australian Women's Weekly felt it was, \"catchy, and shows plenty of promise for the future.\" When not performing Alan worked as a cabinetmaker and then as a luthier at Maton, Russell was a public servant. The duo backed the country music singer Kevin Shegog and were recorded on the albums, Country Concert (split album, 1961) and Kevin Shegog'' (solo album, 1962), both on W&G Records. In April 1962 the Hawking Brothers released another single, \"Two Timin' Baby\".\nIn November 1967 they issued their debut stand-alone album, Portrait of the Folksy, via W&G Records. The Wildwoods were the backing musicians for an album, The Hawking Brothers and The Wildwoods (1970), which was issued by Parlophone/EMI Music Australia. The line-up was Alan on guitar, banjo, autoharp and vocals; and Russ on rhythm guitar, dobro, and vocals as the Hawking Brothers; while the Wildwoods were Joe Attard on drums; Gary Newton on acoustic and electric bass guitars; and George Xanthos on pedal steel guitar. It was recorded at Armstrong Studios with Roger Savage and John Sayers as audio engineers. Eventually they became the five-piece version of the Hawking Brothers Band. The group signed with Fable Records to release the album, Australian Heritage (1970). They had quit their daytime jobs and became fully professional.\nIn 1973 the Hawking Brothers backed Johnny Cash on his Australian tour. They released a cover version of \"Catfish John\" in that year, originally by United States country singer-songwriter, Bob McDill. Their rendition reached the top&nbsp;40 on the Kent Music Report singles chart. It appeared on the group's compilation album for Fable Records, Country Gold (1973). The line-up was Alan on vocal, spanish guitar, tenor guitar, banjo, and auto harp; Russ on vocal, rhythm guitar and Dobro guitar; Newton on bass guitar; Xanthos on pedal steel guitar; and Peter Cohen on drums.\nRussell died in 1976 after a heart attack. Alan continued the group, in homage to his brother, with Peter Hayes joining on guitar and vocals. Their cover version of Marilyn Sellars' 1974 single, \"One Day at a Time\", reached the No.&nbsp;30 in 1978. By 1980 Alan and Xanthos had been joined by Leo Dalton, John Faubles and Doug Foley. Due to \"personal reasons\" Alan retired from the group in 1981 and undertook a solo career. Alan died in 1988 due to \"complications set in after a gall-bladder operation.\"\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chartpositions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | AUS\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Country Concert\n|\n* Released: 1961\n* Format: LP\n* Label: W&G Records\n| align=\"center\" | -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Portrait of the Folksy  The Hawking Brothers Sing Old Golden Songs\n|\n* Released: November 1967\n* Format: LP\n* Label: W&G\n| align=\"center\" | -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Australian Heritage\n|\n* Released: 1970\n* Format: LP\n* Label: Fable Records\n| align=\"center\" | -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Australian Heritage, Vol. 2\n|\n* Released: 1975\n* Format: LP\n* Label: Fable\n| align=\"center\" | -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Hawking Brothers in Nashville\n|\n* Released: 1976\n* Format: LP\n* Label: Fable\n| align=\"center\" | -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Country Travellin'\n|\n* Released: 1977\n* Format: LP\n* Label: RCA Victor\n| align=\"center\" | -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | One Day at a Time\n|\n* Released: December 1978\n* Format: LP\n* Label: RCA Victor\n| align=\"center\" | 56\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Songs & Poems of Australia\n|\n* Released: 1979\n* Format: LP\n* Label: RCA Victor\n| align=\"center\" | -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Hawks\n|\n* Released: 1979\n* Format: LP\n* Label: RCA Victor\n| align=\"center\" | -\n|}\nLive albums\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n!
