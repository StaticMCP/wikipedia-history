Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Berbers achieved a decisive victory that led to the collapse of Umayyad control in Ifriqiya.\nBackground\nThe Berber resistance had been growing steadily due to political oppression and heavy taxation by the Umayyad administration. Dihya, a legendary warrior queen, united various tribes to launch a counter-offensive against the Umayyads after their occupation of Kairouan.\nThe Battle\nWith 40,000 fighters, the Berbers ambushed the larger Umayyad force of 100,000 near Kairouan. Using superior knowledge of terrain and guerrilla tactics, the Berbers inflicted severe losses. The Umayyad lines collapsed after several days of fighting.\nAftermath\nThe Umayyad army retreated toward Barqa (modern-day Libya), and Kairouan fell under Berber control. Dihya ruled the region for several years before the Umayyads launched a renewed campaign.\nSee also\n* Dihya\n* Umayyad Caliphate\n* Kairouan"
