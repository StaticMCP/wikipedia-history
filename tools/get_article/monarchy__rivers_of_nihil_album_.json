The album was released on August 21, 2015, via Metal Blade Records, and is the band's first album to feature guitarist Jon Topore, and the last to feature drummer Alan Balamut. Monarchy is the second album in the band's tetralogy based around the four seasons; it represents summer.\nBackground and promotion\nIn October of 2014, the band parted ways with guitarist and original band member Jonathan Kunz, and replaced him with Jon Topore.\nIn April of 2015, Rivers of Nihil announced that they'd completed work on a follow-up album to 2013's The Conscious Seed of Light. The band had returned to Atrium studios to work with Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland. Slovak had worked with the band in 2009 to record their debut EP Hierarchy.\nOn June 10, 2015, the band announced the title of the album, Monarchy, set a release date for August 21, and debuted the track \"Perpetual Growth Machine.\" On August 17, 2015, the band made Monarchy available for streaming in full.\nOn July 8, the band released the album's title track \"Monarchy\" as a single. On August 3rd the band debuted the track \"Sand Baptism\" along with a music video, directed by David Brodsky.\nThe album was released on August 21, 2015, and sold 1,175 copies in its first week.\nAlbum artwork was created by Dan Seagrave, who would handle the artwork on the band's other two albums as well. Dan Seagrave explained, \"This image continues the theme from the previous record. The season is now based around summer. In the text of the narrative we have shifted significantly forward in time, many thousands of years. The image depicts roughly the same location as the last album. The middle eroded tower holds on the top left, the steps which had led up to the life form 'pod'. A very small detail. In the background are the now heavily eroded, and sand covered structures seen in that last artwork. The small statues dotted around depict the new life form that had succeeded us.\"\nIn February of 2016, the band released a live video for the track \"Monarchy.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nProduction and performance credits are adapted from the album liner notes.\nRivers of Nihil\n* Jake Dieffenbach &ndash; lead vocals\n* Brody Uttley &ndash; lead guitar\n* Adam Biggs &ndash; bass, backing vocals\n* Jon Topore &ndash; rhythm guitar\n* Alan Balamut &ndash; drums\nProduction\n* Dan Seagrave &ndash; artwork\n* Brody Uttley &ndash; additional engineering\n* Alan Douches &ndash; mastering\n* Carson Slovak, Grant McFarland &ndash; production, engineering, mixing\nReferences"
