The subjects are not all English, despite the title: Frances Sheridan was Anglo-Irish, Hester Thrale Piozzi was Welsh-born, and Grizel Baillie, Anne Grant, Elizabeth Hamilton and Mary Brunton were Scottish. In the brief preface, Elwood writes that she undertook the project as there was little else published to \"gratify her curiosity\" about \"the lives and characters\" of \"Literary Females\". She concludes, with the modesty that was in style at that time, that the work is not intended for scholars, and requests that critics not be too severe.\nThe first edition was published in two volumes in London by H. Colburn in 1843. It features twenty-nine subjects arranged chronologically by birth, fifteen in the first volume and fourteen in the second. A portrait of Felicia Hemans forms the frontispiece for the first volume, and one of Letitia Elizabeth Landon serves in the second.\nThe first U.S. edition, essentially an abridgement, comprises one volume and features eighteen of the original twenty-nine subjects.\nMemoirs was reprinted by the AMS Press in 1973.\nModern scholars have commented on the novelty of Elwood's project. Linda Peterson writes that the gender of the writers was the basic principle for inclusion in the collection, rather than the more usual categories of nationality or poetic genre. In this, Elwood, with \"canon-making intentions\", was pointing to the existence of \"a field of writing for women only\".\n1st edition (1843)\nVolume I\nVolume II\nPhiladelphia edition (1845)\nEtexts\n* Memoirs of the literary ladies of England from the commencement of the last century.
