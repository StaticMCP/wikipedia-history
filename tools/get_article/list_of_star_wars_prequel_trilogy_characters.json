      "text": "# List of Star Wars prequel trilogy characters\n\nThis incomplete list contains only the major characters and storylines featured in the three films of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.\nBackground\nThe Star Wars prequel trilogy, colloquially referred to as \"the prequels\", is a series of epic space-opera films written and directed by George Lucas. It was produced by Lucasfilm Ltd. and distributed by 20th Century Fox. The trilogy was released from 1999 to 2005 and is set before the original Star Wars trilogy (1977–83), chronologically making it the first act of the Skywalker saga.\nThe prequel trilogy received mixed reviews, generally improving in critical reception with each installment. Common criticisms surrounded the over-reliance on computer-generated imagery and green screens, melodramatic and wooden dialogue (including scenes of romance between Anakin and Padmé), slow-paced political scenes, and the comic relief character of Jar Jar Binks, whose role was reduced after the first film.}}\nSeveral alien characters introduced in The Phantom Menace have been subject to accusations of racial stereotypes. Jar Jar is asserted to caricature a stereotyped Jamaican, while the Gungan species at large has been said to suggest a primitive African tribe. The greedy Neimoidians of the Trade Federation have been noted as resembling East Asian stereotypes with some deliberately given Thai accents, and Watto's mannerisms and hooked nose appearance were based on footage of Alec Guinness as the Jewish character Fagin in the 1948 film Oliver Twist, leading some to assert that the slave-owning character is a Jewish stereotype. Lucas denied all accusations of racial stereotypes.\nMany expressed their disappointment with the trilogy's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker, particularly calling the writing weak and the dialogue wooden, although Hayden Christensen's performance in the third film was more well-received. Contrarily, Ewan McGregor's portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, following in the footsteps of Alec Guinness, has been generally praised. Natalie Portman has expressed her disappointment with the trilogy's negative reception, saying that \"When something has that much anticipation it can almost only disappoint.\" She also acknowledged that \"With the perspective of time, it's been re-evaluated by a lot of people who actually really love them now.\"\nMain cast\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 99%;\"\n!Character\n!The Phantom Menace (1999)\n!Attack of the Clones (2002)\n!Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n|-\n|Qui-Gon Jinn\n|Liam Neeson\n|colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n|Obi-Wan Kenobi\n| colspan=\"3\" |Ewan McGregor\n|-\n|Padmé Amidala\n| colspan=\"3\" |Natalie Portman\n|-\n|Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader\n|Jake Lloyd\n| colspan=\"2\" |Hayden Christensen\n|-\n|Palpatine / Darth Sidious\n| colspan=\"3\" |Ian McDiarmid\n|-\n|Jar Jar Binks\n| colspan=\"3\" |Ahmed Best\n|-\n|C-3PO\n| colspan=\"3\" |Anthony Daniels\n|-\n|R2-D2\n| colspan=\"3\" |Kenny Baker\n|-\n|Shmi Skywalker\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pernilla August\n|\n|-\n|Yoda\n| colspan=\"3\" |Frank Oz\n|-\n|Mace Windu\n| colspan=\"3\" |Samuel L.

Tasked with protecting the Queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, Jinn discovers Anakin Skywalker as a slave on the desert planet of Tatooine. Known for his unconventional methods (that have cost him a seat on the Jedi Council), Jinn implores the Council to allow him to train Anakin despite already having an apprentice in Kenobi, and Anakin being too old to begin the training. When Amidala returns to Naboo to liberate her people from the Trade Federation blockade, Jinn is mortally wounded in a lightsaber duel against Darth Maul. With his dying words, he tasks Kenobi with training Anakin.\nThe character was portrayed by Liam Neeson in The Phantom Menace, and archival audio is heard as Yoda meditates in Attack of the Clones.\nObi-Wan Kenobi\nObi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi Master and former student of Qui-Gon Jinn whose training is completed by Master Yoda.

The two form an extremely close friendship despite Skywalker's penchant for breaking the rules.\nThe character was portrayed by Ewan McGregor in all three films.\nPadmé Amidala\nPadmé Amidala served as the queen and later senator for Naboo. She secretly marries Anakin Skywalker, and following his turn to the Dark Side, she dies in childbirth with twins- Luke and Leia.\nThe character was portrayed by Natalie Portman in all three films.\nAnakin Skywalker / Darth Vader\nAnakin Skywalker is a powerful Jedi Knight believed by some to be the \"Chosen One\" who will bring balance to the Force.

Skywalker is manipulated by Palpatine (actually the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious) into becoming his apprentice, Darth Vader.\nThe character was portrayed as a child by Jake Lloyd in The Phantom Menace, and as a young man by Hayden Christensen in Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. James Earl Jones returned to voice Darth Vader once the character is entombed in the life support suit following the duel on Mustafar.\nPalpatine / Darth Sidious\nSheev Palpatine is a senator from Naboo who ascends to become the Chancellor of the Republic following the vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum during the Naboo crisis.
