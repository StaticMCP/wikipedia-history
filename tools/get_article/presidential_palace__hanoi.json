Before 1954, it was named the Palace of the Governor-General of Indochina (, ).\nHistory\n, Tonkin]]\nThe palace was built between 1900 and 1906 to house the French governor-general of Indochina and was constructed by the architect Charles Lichtenfelder, this is often incorrectly attributed to Auguste Henri Vildieu, who was the official French architect for French Indochina. Like most French colonial architecture, the palace is pointedly European. The only visual cues that it is located in Vietnam at all are mango trees growing on the grounds.\nThe yellow palace stands behind wrought iron gates flanked by sentry boxes. It incorporates elements of Italian Renaissance design, including:\n*aedicules\n*a formal piano nobile reached by a grand staircase\n*broken pediments\n*classical columns\n*quoins\nWhen Vietnam achieved independence in 1954, Ho Chi Minh was claimed to have refused to live in the grand structure for symbolic reasons, although he still received state guests there; he eventually built a traditional Vietnamese stilt house and carp pond on the grounds. His house and the grounds were made into the Presidential Palace Historical Site in 1975.\nThe palace hosts government meetings. Although the palace itself is not open to the public, one may walk around the grounds for a fee.\nThe Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum is located near the palace. On February 27, 2019, Donald Trump officially met Kim Jong-un for the second time in Hanoi's Presidential Palace.\nGallery\nFile:Wohngebäude beim Präsidenten Palast Hanoi Vietnam.JPG|House No. 54, where President Ho Chi Minh lived and worked from 1954 to 1958\nFile:Presidential House Hanoi 2803356508 5221a7a0da.jpg|Carp pond on the grounds of the palace\nFile:Prezidentský palác, Hanoj.jpg|Presidential Palace\nFile:Dinning room of Ho Chi Minh's house attached to the Presidential Palace, Hanoi 12-2010.JPG|Dining room of Ho Chi Minh's house attached to the Presidential Palace\nFile:Bedroom of Ho Chi Minh's house attached to the Presidential Palace, Hanoi 12-2010.JPG|Bedroom of Ho Chi Minh's house attached to the Presidential Palace\nFile:Ho-chi-Minh with children (7).jpg|President Ho Chi Minh with children\nFile:KITLV A220 - Galafeest in oud Hollandse klederdracht in het presidentiële paleis van Hanoi in Indochina, KITLV 79440.tiff|Festival in the Governor's palace in 1930\nFile:KITLV A220 - Ontvangst van de gouverneur-generaal A.C.D. de Graeff (links) bij het presidentiële paleis van Hanoi in Indochina, KITLV 85358.tiff| Welcome ceremony for Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff.\n.\nSee also\n* Tonkin Palace in Hoàn Kiếm District built between 1915 and 1916 to house the governor of Tonkin\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*Hanoi: Biography of a City by William Stewart Logan"
