The vessels gathered at Penang in September and waited there. However, the British government government cancelled the invasion following a diplomatic overtures with Spain and the EIC released the vessels it had engaged. After the invasion was cancelled, the captains of the ships engaged sued the EIC for demurrage.\nThe EIC held several vessels in India to support the expedition. There were eight regular ships: Lord Camden, Busbridge, Minerva, Lord Macartney, Lord Hawkesbury, Sir Stephen Lushington, Phoenix and General Goddard, and three \"dismantled ships\": Pitt, Lascalles, and Royal Admiral. Several EIC \"extra ships\" on a voyage charter were also engaged for the cancelled invasion. The captains of all the vessels sued the EIC for demurrage, citing expenses they had incurred due to the delay to their homeward bound journeys, and for the eight regular ships, the additional risks involved in the detours to Penang. In 1800, British authorities awarded six of the captains of the regular ships £750 each, and further ordered that the officers of all vessels involved receive payment from the EIC.\nEIC ships\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
