The group's membership consists of Republicans from ages 14 to 17.\nTARs has had a presence in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, with membership in the tens of thousands. TARs is the first of the four official youth wings of the Republican National Committee, along with the High School Republican National Federation, Young Republican National Federation and College Republicans.\nHistory\nThe oldest recorded TAR group was formed in 1960 in South Dakota.\nThe first national conference was held in Washington D.C. at Trinity College on June 16–21, 1969, and ever since National TARs has hosted an annual Teen Age Republican Leader Conference (TLC). Following his 1980 election victory, Ronald Reagan held a reception for delegates to the TLC, where he stated that TARs \"had a significant impact in the outcome of the last election...you walked the precincts, you licked stamps, stuffed envelopes, got senior citizens to the polls, and babysat while mothers voted...what you did [made] the difference between winning and losing.\"\nEx-TARs members include Lawrence Lessig, Paris Dennard, Frank Luntz, and Rob Bishop.\nIn April 2022, certain state chapters left the National Teenage Republicans and created a new organization, The High School Republican National Federation, a student-led alternative.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
