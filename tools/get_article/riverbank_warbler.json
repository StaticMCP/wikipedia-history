Its range includes three disjunct populations, with one (M. r. mesoleuca) in the eastern Amazon of Brazil, the Guianas, and southern and eastern Venezuela, the second (nominate subspecies) in the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and far north-eastern Argentina, and the final population (M. r. bolivianus) in the Yungas of Bolivia.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Riverbank Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Riverbank warbler\n}}"
