In the nineteenth century it was the office and home of a solicitor, George Michell. In the early twentieth century, it was the site of Commercial Union Chambers, which hosted a range of commercial offices, including its main tenant the Commercial Union Assurance Company. From the 1930s onwards, it became associated with the premises of Scrymgour & Sons, a printing business.\n115 King William Street was approved by the Development Assessment Commission on 12 July 2010, with its original design only being 64 metres and 16 storeys tall.
