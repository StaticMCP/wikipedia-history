      "text": "# Draft:Sam Ward (entrepreneur)\n\nSam Ward (born 1992) is a British legal entrepreneur and the director of Sentinel Legal Limited, a consumer litigation firm based in Cheltenham with offices in Manchester. He is known for his role in exposing the United Kingdom's motor finance mis-selling scandal and for leading litigation against major lenders over undisclosed commissions in car finance agreements.\nEarly life and education\nWard was born in Manchester, England, in 1992. He studied law and began his career in the consumer legal services sector during the 2010s, developing a focus on financial-services disputes and unfair-relationship claims.\nCareer\nWard founded Sentinel Legal Limited in 2022, establishing the firm as one of the first in the UK to litigate large-scale car-finance commission claims.  The firm is headquartered in Cheltenham with an additional office in Manchester.\nUnder Ward’s direction, Sentinel Legal became one of the largest litigators of motor-finance mis-selling claims in the United Kingdom, having issued hundreds of court cases against leading lenders and obtained £8 million in litigation funding to support consumers.  Ward and his firm are widely regarded as having brought the car-finance mis-selling issue to public attention and were among the first to provide data and consumer evidence to the Financial Conduct Authority’s investigation into historic motor-finance commission arrangements.\nLegal work\nWhile Sentinel Legal was not formally named as a solicitor on record in the test case of Johnson v FirstRand Bank Ltd, it supported HD Law, the firm representing the claimant, by developing early case evidence and public awareness around the litigation.  Ward’s contributions to this area of law have been credited with helping to establish the framework for consumer redress in the UK motor-finance market.\nMedia and public commentary\nWard has appeared in national broadcast and print media to discuss consumer litigation and the car-finance mis-selling scandal.  He is also the host of the Sentinel Legal Podcast, available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts, where he interviews legal experts and industry figures about developments in consumer law.\nRecognition\nWard and Sentinel Legal have been cited by UK and international media as leading figures in the motor-finance redress movement, with commentators crediting the firm’s litigation for prompting regulatory action and public awareness.\nSee also\n* Sentinel Legal Limited\n* Johnson v FirstRand Bank Ltd\n* Consumer Credit Act 1974\n* Financial Conduct Authority\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.sentinellegal.co.uk Official website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/@SentinelLegal Sentinel Legal YouTube channel]\n* [https://open.spotify.com/show/57XQn5Id8SKgPx83YmtJ1V Sentinel Legal Podcast on Spotify]\n* [https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/sentinel-legal/id1775292184 Sentinel Legal Podcast on Apple Podcasts]"
