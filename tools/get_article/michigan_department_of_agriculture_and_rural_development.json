Agriculture in the State of Michigan is now a $104.7 billion industry. A five-member commission heads the Department with a Director of Agriculture & Rural Development to administer the day-to-day activities.\nUnder Governor Rick Snyder, MDARD is now part of the \"Quality of Life\" group within state government, along with the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Environmental Quality.\nThe mission of the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development is, \"To protect, promote and preserve the food, agricultural, environmental and economic interests of the people of Michigan.\"\nThe Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has six divisions, which work to cultivate and expand new economic opportunities for the food and agricultural sector; safeguard the public’s food supply; inspect and enforce sound animal health practices; control and eradicate plant pests and diseases threatening the food and agriculture system; preserve the environment by which the farming community makes their living and feeds consumers; and protect consumers by enforcing laws relating to weights and measures\nHistory\nThe Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development (then known only as the Department of Agriculture) was brought into existence in 1921 by the provisions of Act 13 of the Public Acts of 1921. Previous to this time, the regulatory work affecting agriculture was administered by commissions, departments and individuals. The act creating the department brought under one head the administering of all regulatory laws affecting agriculture. Commissions were abolished and all their work turned over to the newly created department.\nAlong with a proposed merger of the Department of Environmental Quality and Department of Natural Resources, in 2009 former Governor Jennifer Granholm issued an Executive Order making the Department's Director appointed by the Governor instead of the Agriculture Commission.  In 2011, then Governor Rick Snyder renamed the department to Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, giving it an expanded mission in the rural areas to include economic, social, and educational.\nDivisions\n*Agriculture Development Division\n*Animal Industry Division\n*Environmental Stewardship Division\n*Food and Dairy Division\n*Laboratory Division\n*Pesticide and Plant Pest Management Division\n*MDARD Executive Office\n*Human Resources is now part of Quality of Life Group HR Division\nList of directors\n*John A.
