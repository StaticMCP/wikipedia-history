The latter were ready for the attack, since Péralte had \"sent an advance warning to the British embassy.\" The defenders counterattacked and, within two minutes, the Caco raid disintegrated.\nOn 8 October, Lieutenant Kemp C. Christian, leading 12 Haitian gendarmes, captured Péralte's base camp, killing 30 Caco rebels and capturing 20 horses, some rifles and swords, and a field gun (Péralte's only one). The rebel leader managed to escape.\nReferences"
