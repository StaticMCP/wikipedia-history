It was also one of the first PlayStation 2 titles to be released in DVD-ROM format, rather than CD-ROM as most early PS2 titles were.\nThe story in this game revolves around the player settling construction site contracts through vehicular combat with various rival companies over the course of 16 levels. The player uses vehicles commonly found on construction sites like diggers and bulldozers. Additional characters can be unlocked by playing the story. The European release notably gives the characters English accents.\nReception\nGerman GamePro Magazine commended the game's concept as a \"excavator-em up\", but criticized the vehicles as \"sluggish\", the controls not being easy to understand and the game's lack of sharpness in the gameplay.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at Artdink\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140328121502/http://bngames.basicallynothing.com/region-locked-bcv-battle-construction-vehicles-kensetsu-juuki-kenka-batoru-buchigire-kongou/ Video Review] at BN-Games.com"
