In the , Dicky Beach had a population of 1,921 people.\nGeography\nThe suburb is bounded by the Coral Sea to the east, Buderim Street to the north, Coonowrin Street to the west, and Tooway Creek to the south.\nThe land use is residential, apart from the caravan park facing the beach ().\nHistory\nThe area was named after the iron steamboat, the  (226 gross tons), which ran aground during heavy seas on 12 February 1893. It was refloated, but again, heavy seas turned the ship about and back onto the sand where it remained.\nThe ship was used as a venue for dances until a kerosene lamp overturned and burned out the ship.\nIn April 1963, the propeller was removed by the Landsborough Shire Council to use on a memorial cairn, accompanied by a plaque provided by the Queensland Women's Historical Association. The opening ceremony was performed by Queensland Premier Frank Nicklin on 24 November 1963.\nCurrimundi Special School opened on 23 January 1984.\nIn 2014, the Sunshine Coast Regional Council decided that the deterioration of the Dicky wreck had created a hazard for swimmers due to sharp edges becoming revealed by shifting sand. The decision was taken to relocate the wreck away from the beach. Some deeply buried parts of the wreck will remain on the beach; other parts will be relocated into a foreshore park with an interpretive display, while other parts will be conserved and stored. It is expected that over time more of the wreck will be exposed and will be progressively removed.\nDemographics\nIn the , Dicky Beach had a population of 1,758 people with a median age of 48.\nIn the , Dicky Beach had a population of 1,895 people.\nIn the , Dicky Beach had a population of 1,921 people.\nEducation\nCurrimundi Special School is a special government primary and secondary (Prep-12) school for boys and girls at Buderim Street ().
