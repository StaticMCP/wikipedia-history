The ARIA Awards ceremony occurred on 25 November 2020, with Delta Goodrem as host. However, due to COVID-safe restrictions, it was without an audience and was broadcast from the Star Event Centre, Sydney on the Nine Network around Australia. In place of the usual Red Carpet event, a pre-show was broadcast from The Star's backstage and was hosted by Ash London and Mitch Churi. The pre-show had 16&nbsp;awards presented ahead of the main ceremony.\nThe ARIA CEO Dan Rosen had explained to Lars Brandle of Billboard, \"There will be an ARIA stage with real people on it, [it] just won't have a live audience in there.\" Nine Network's Brooke Boney announced the nominees on 13 October via ARIA's YouTube channel with Dean Lewis, Guy Sebastian, and Tones and I appearing. Tame Impala won the most awards with five from seven nominations, Lime Cordiale received the most nominations with eight and Sampa the Great received six nominations, while winning three. Archie Roach was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. During the ceremony he was joined on a stage in Warrnambool by family, friends and collaborators to sing, \"Took the Children Away\". A tribute performance of \"I Am Woman\", in memory of 2006 ARIA Hall of Fame inductee, Helen Reddy (1941–2020), was given by an ensemble of female singers backed by a virtual chorus.\nSampa the Great won Best Hip Hop Release for the second year in a row. The category had been created after splitting Best Urban Release into two. Upon her win in the previous year, she was the first female person of colour to win a hip hop award at the ARIAs. However her acceptance speech \"about diversity and inclusivity\" was not broadcast as the network switched to a commercial. HuffPosts Alicia Vrajlal reported that various artists had criticised \"systemic racism\" in Australia and its music industry for years. At the 2020 ceremony Sampa the Great performed \"Final Form\", introduced by her rapping an acceptance speech which included reference to the hurt inflicted by the previous year's ARIA broadcast. Prior to this year's ceremony, Rosen had acknowledged his organisation had handled diverse artists poorly and admitted that \"we need to do better.\"\nPerformers\nA tribute performance of \"I Am Woman\", in honour of Helen Reddy, was given by an ensemble of Australian female singers, they were introduced by former Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. The ensemble comprised Amy Shark, Christine Anu, Delta Goodrem, Emma Watkins, Jessica Mauboy, Kate Ceberano, Marcia Hines, Montaigne, the McClymonts and Tones and I. They were backed by a virtual choir of Amy Sheppard, Christie Whelan Browne, Clare Bowen, Dami Im, Emma Donovan, Erika Heynatz, Fanny Lumsden, Graace, Kate Miller-Heidke, Katie Noonan, KLP, Maddy Jane, Missy Higgins, Mo'Ju, Odette, Samantha Jade, Teeny Tiny Stevies, Thandi Phoenix and Wendy Matthews.\nPerformers for the ARIA Awards ceremony:\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n|Amy Shark\n|\"Everybody Rise\"\n|rowspan=\"9\"|\n|-\n| Sia\n| \"Together\"\n|-\n|Sampa the Great\n|\"Final Form\"\n|-\n|Lime Cordiale\n|\"Robbery\"\n|-\n|Sam Smith\n|\"Diamonds\"\n|-\n|Archie Roach\n|\"Took the Children Away\"\n|-\n|Billie Eilish\n| \"Therefore I Am\"\n|-\n|Tame Impala\n|\"On Track\"\n|-\n| Ensemble + choir\n| \"I Am Woman\"\n|-\n|}\nPresenters\nDelta Goodrem hosted the 2020 ARIA Music Awards main ceremony with the presenters: Briggs, Brooke Boney, Christine Anu, Guy Sebastian, Hamish Blake, INXS, Joel Creasey, Julia Gillard, Kate Ceberano, Keith Urban, Kylie Minogue, Mick Fleetwood, Richard Wilkins, Robbie Williams, Sophie Monk, Tim Minchin, Tones and I, and Tuma Basa & A$AP Ferg. Pre-Show presenters were: Briggs, Anu, Ceberano, Matt Okine & KLP, Mia Rodriguez, Montaigne, Morgan Evans and Nat's What I Reckon.\nARIA Hall of Fame inductee\nUpon the announcement of Archie Roach's induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame, the Indigenous Australian musician reflected on changes for local First Nations people during his career. He had released his debut album, Charcoal Lane, in May 1990 and its lead single, \"Took the Children Away\" (September 1990). He detailed his own experience of the Stolen Generations and addressed the issue of the Australian government's policy, where Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their parents. Roach observed, \"When you have written a song and perform a song you just hope people listen to it. I am glad that I was among the first people that opened up about that and began that conversation.\" He also acknowledged the wider acceptance of Indigenous artists, \"I feel more Australian now, I feel more part of the broader community rather than a sub-group or a subculture.\"\nFor the virtual ceremony Roach was at the Lighthouse Theatre, Warrnambool (his hometown), where he was joined for his song, \"Took the Children Away\", by family, friends and collaborators including Paul Grabowsky (piano), Paul Kelly (vocal), Linda Bull (vocal), Jessica Hitchcock (vocal), Steve Magnusson (guitar), Sam Anning (bass guitar), Dave Beck (drums), Erkki Veltheim (violin), and Nola Roach (vocal). Besides his induction Roach won two more awards, Best Male Artist and Best Adult Contemporary Album for Tell Me Why (November 2019).\n* Archie Roach\nNominees and winners\nARIA Awards\nWinners indicated in boldface, with other nominees in plain.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width=100%\"\n|+Full list of nominees\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Album of the Year\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Best Group\n|-\n|\n*'Tame Impala – The Slow Rush'\n**DMA's – The Glow\n**Jessica Mauboy – Hilda\n**Lime Cordiale – 14 Steps to a Better You\n**Sampa the Great – The Return\n|\n*'Tame Impala – The Slow Rush'\n**5 Seconds Of Summer – Calm\n**DMA's – The Glow\n**Lime Cordiale – 14 Steps to a Better You\n**The Teskey Brothers – Live at the Forum\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Best Male Artist\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Best Female Artist\n|-\n|\n*'Archie Roach – Tell Me Why'\n**Guy Sebastian – \"Standing with You\"\n**Ruel – Free Time\n**The Kid Laroi – F*ck Love\n**Troye Sivan – In a Dream\n|\n*'Sampa the Great – The Return'\n**Amy Shark – \"Everybody Rise\"\n**Miiesha – Nyaaringu\n**Sia – \"Together\"\n**Tones and I – \"Bad Child\"/\"Can't Be Happy All the Time\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Best Adult Contemporary Album\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Best Soul/R&B Release\n|-\n|\n*'Archie Roach – Tell Me Why'\n**Donny Benét – Mr Experience\n**Gordi – Our Two Skins\n**Josh Pyke – Rome\n**Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds – Ghosteen\n|\n*'Miiesha – Nyaaringu'\n**Genesis Owusu – \"Don't Need You\"\n**Kian - \"Every Hour\"\n**Tash Sultana – \"Pretty Lady\"\n**Tkay Maidza – Last Year Was Weird, Vol.2\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album\n! style=\"background:#ff9; width=;\"50%\"| Best Rock Album\n|-\n|\n*'King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard – Chunky Shrapnel'\n**Parkway Drive – Viva the Underdogs\n**Polaris – The Death of Me\n**The Amity Affliction – Everyone Loves You...
