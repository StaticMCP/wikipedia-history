Kemeys was also a captain in the 4th United States Colored Heavy Artillery, Company H, writer, lecturer, and adventurer in the Western United States.\nEarly life\nKemeys was born on January 31, 1843, in Savannah, Georgia. to Abby Greene of Providence, Rhode Island, and William Kemeys of Scarborough, New York. The Kemeys family lived in Savannah, but moved back to New York City following the death of his mother in 1843.\nCareer\nKemeys first worked in the iron business of New York City at age 17.\nCivil War\nWhen the American Civil War broke out, Kemeys enlisted at age 19, volunteering for the 65th New York Infantry Regiment. \"I served in the Peninsula campaign till I fell sick of fever and was discharged. I went in again later as a second lieutenant,\" he recalled. Kemeys re-enlisted as a commissioned officer in the 4th United States Colored Heavy Artillery, Company H, where he attained the rank of captain. He resigned his commission in 1866.\nAfter the Civil War\nHe studied in New York City and then Paris.\nIn Paris, he was impressed by the style of Antoine-Louis Barye, although in no sense an imitator. He made a specialty of the wild animals of the American continent. His “Fight between Buffalo and Wolves” attracted attention at the Paris Salon in 1878. Among his other important works are “Panther and Deer,” and “Coyote and Raven.” A colossal head of a buffalo for the facade of the station of the Pacific railroad at St. Louis, Missouri, which was cast in bronze in New York in August, 1887, was the largest work of its kind that had been done in the United States. Another bronze statue of a panther named \"Still Hunt,\" is permanently situated on a rock flanking East Drive in Central Park in New York City.\nKemeys died in Washington, D.C., on May 11, 1907. He and his wife, Laura Swing Kemeys (also an artist), are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\nGallery\nFile:Hudson Wolves Kemeys.JPG|Hudson Bay Wolves, 1873, at the Philadelphia Zoo in Philadelphia\nFile:Panther and Cubs Kemeys 01.jpg|Panther and Cubs, c. 1878, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City\nFile:Prayer for Rain CU IL.JPG|Prayer for Rain, c. 1899, at West Side Park in Champaign, Illinois\nFile:Edward Kemeys' Bronze Bison Sculpture, Humboldt Park Formal Garden, Chicago.jpg|Bronze Bison Sculpture at Humboldt Park Formal Garden in Chicago\nFile:Memorial Exhibition of the Works in Sculpture by the Late Edward Kemeys (2).jpg|Memorial Exhibition of the Works in Sculpture by the Late Edward Kemeys, December 1907, at Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\nFile:Memorial Exhibition of the Works in Sculpture by the Late Edward Kemeys (1).jpg|[https://library.nga.gov/permalink/01NGA_INST/1p5jkvq/alma994103979504896 Installation view of the Memorial Exhibition of the Works in Sculpture by the Late Edward Kemeys, Corcoran Gallery of Art, December 15-26, 1907, gelatin silver print], [https://www.nga.gov/research/library/imagecollections.html Department of Image Collections, National Gallery of Art Library, Washington, DC]\nFile:Art Institute of Chicago Lion Statue (2-D).jpg|North Lion at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1893\nReferences\nFurth reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=80 Bronze Gallery biography]\n*[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=2595 Smithsonian American Art Museum]"
