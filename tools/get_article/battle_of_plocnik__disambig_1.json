With a larger force, the Ottoman Sultan Murad I attacked Serbia in 1386, when according to some sources Niš was conquered.\nMurad I had campaigned against the Karamanids and defeated their army near Konya. Serbian soldiers from some vassal Serbian lords had accompanied the Ottoman army. Some of the soldiers (including some Serbian soldiers) were executed for looting civilian property against the Sultan's order. Many of the vassal Serbian lords now began to support Lazar against the Ottomans. At that time, one lord in Shkodër wrote to the Sultan promising to recognise Ottoman sovereignty and aid the Ottoman army if Ottoman troops were  sent to protect him. Murad I consequently ordered an akinji commander, Kula Şahin Bey, to prepare his troops (according to Namık Kemal, this was not Lala Şahin Paşa, as is commonly believed).\nBattle\nThe Serbian army emerged victorious, although details of the actual battle are scarce. Şahin Bey entered Serbia with 20,000 akinjis, and learned that Serbian lords had prepared an army to attack his troops. He advanced to Pločnik near Prokuplje but could not detect that army, and believed that it did not exist. At that time, many akinjis (about 18,000) lost their temper and began looting civilian properties in the surrounding villages, disobeying orders, leaving Şahin Bey alone with 2,000 soldiers. The battlefield was observed by Serbian expeditionary forces.\nSuddenly an allied army of 15,000 soldiers appeared, many of whom were cavalry. The Serbian army used heavy knight cavalry charges, with horse archers on the flanks. The Serbs first attacked the Ottoman center (2,000 soldiers). Although unprepared and suffering a shock from heavy Serbian knights, the outnumbered Ottoman center resisted for some time but later began to withdraw with Şahin Bey, who barely escaped with his life.\nThen the Serbian army turned to the other 18,000 akinjis that were busy plundering. They were unprepared, ill-disciplined, and caught by surprise; only 5,000 of them returned home alive. More than 60% of the Ottoman army was destroyed. According to tradition Serbian knight and folk hero Miloš Obilić participated with distinction in this battle; he was wounded by an Ottoman arrow.\nAccording to Croat historian Vjekoslav Klaić, Lazar's army was aided by Bosnian troops. According to another version of the battle, it was won thanks to the Bosnian troops and the trickery of a Kastrioti.\nAftermath\nThe victory at Pločnik brought considerable prestige to Lazar among Serbian (and bordering) nobles, and provided (at least) nominal unity of the Serbian Principalities. It was the first major defeat of the Ottomans in South Slavic lands, though Lazar could not recapture Niš, which Ottomans had taken prior to Pločnik. The Ottoman army next campaigned against Bosnia, suffering another serious defeat to Vlatko Vuković and Radič Sanković at Bileća (1388), and culminating in Kosovo, fighting Serbian and allied troops at the Kosovo field (1389), concluding with the deaths of both Murad I and Lazar.\nSee also\n* History of the Serbian-Turkish wars\nAnnotations\n1386 according to Jovanka Kalić and Marko Šuica; 1387 according to Kemal Namık.}}\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
