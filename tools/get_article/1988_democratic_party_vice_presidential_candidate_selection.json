Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis won the 1988 Democratic nomination for President of the United States, and chose Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate. Dukakis chose Bentsen in order to appeal to Southerners and in hopes of carrying Bentsen's home state of Texas. The strategy failed, as the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket went on to lose Texas and all other states in the South except West Virginia. The choice of Bentsen caused some backlash from Jesse Jackson, who had wanted to be chosen as the vice presidential nominee, and progressives such as Ralph Nader. Paul Brountas, a longtime Dukakis aide, led the search for Dukakis's running mate. The Dukakis–Bentsen ticket ultimately lost to the Bush–Quayle ticket in the general election.\nCoincidental to the presidential election, Bentsen simultaneously re-elected to the fourth term as Senator, and easily won, despite the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket's double-digit loss in Texas. At the convention, Dukakis openly cast the ticket as a 1960-style pairing—“another man from Massachusetts” joined with a Texan—prompting contemporaneous press to liken it to the Kennedy-Johnson “Boston-Austin” alliance.\nPossible running mates\nFinal Seven\nFile:Lloyd Bentsen (1).jpg|alt=|\nFile:Dick Gephardt portrait (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nFile:John Glenn Low Res crop.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Al Gore Senate portrait (cropped).jpg|alt=|\nFile:BobGrahamCropped.jpg|alt=|\nFile:Lee Hamilton.jpg|\nFile:Jesse Jackson portrait.jpg|alt=|\nMedia speculation on possible vice presidential candidates\nFile:Bill Bradley P01255-06 a.jpg|\nFile:Sam Nunn 1991 (cropped).jpg|\nSee also\n*Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential campaign\n*1988 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n*1988 Democratic National Convention\n*1988 United States presidential election\n*List of United States major party presidential tickets\n*Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy\nReferences"
