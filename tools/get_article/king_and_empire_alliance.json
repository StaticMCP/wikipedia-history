Originally established as the United Loyalist Executive (ULE) (a coalition of loyalist leagues and patriotic societies in Queensland) around 1919, the organisation changed its name to the King and Empire Alliance in mid-1919 before being formally launched on 19 August 1920 at the Sydney Town Hall.}} The KEA's founding was attended by many conservative politicians and prominent military figures, and backed by The Sydney Morning Herald. Described as being founded “amidst scenes of extraordinary enthusiasm”, British Brigadier general John Vaughan Campbell said the KEA was “very much on the lines” of the “Fascisti movement in Italy.” Having a peak membership around 10,000 in 1922, its strongest support came from rural New South Wales.\nThe KEA's goal was to 'prevent the spread of disloyal doctrines, to counteract and destroy the malign influence of disloyalists, and to build up and maintain a healthy national sentiment for the consolidation of the Empire, and for the advancement of our own Commonwealth.'\nThe KEA received intrigue, praise and endorsement from various political and military figures, including First Sea Lord of the Admiralty John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe while visiting\nAustralia to promote closer Imperial bonds (1919); Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George, who said he was 'greatly interested to learn of the work of the King and Empire Alliance' (1920); and Major general Granville Ryrie whom announced he was 'cordially in favour of the movement' (1920).\nNotable members\n*Sydney Herring\n*James Macarthur-Onslow\n*Charles Rosenthal\n*Mungo William MacCallum\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
