An acoustic version of the song was released on August 18, 2023. It is included as the fourth single from the band's sixth studio album Artificial Paradise.\nBackground and composition\n\"Runaway\" was written by band members Ryan Tedder and Brent Kutzle as well as Ben Samama, Johnny Simpson, Nolan Sipe, and Josh Varnadore. It was also produced by Kutzle, Samama, Loren Ferard, and John Nathaniel. The lyrics of the song describe letting go of fears and struggles to enjoy and lose yourself in new things and experiences. In the days prior of its release, the band posted teasers on social media to promote the song.\nThere is a common misconception that the track features a sample from Daft Punk's Doin' It Right, but this is a musical effect called Interpolation, where One Republic recreated the sound without actually sampling the original.\nMusic video\nA music video for \"Runaway\" premiered on May 26, 2023, and was directed by Tomás Whitmore. The video features the band members relaxing, recording, and performing in various Asian cities like Manila, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Taipei, and Tokyo. A performance video was recorded and performed atop the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and released July 20. The music video for the acoustic version of the song was released August 23 and features similar clips as the original.\nTrack listing\n* Digital download\n# \"Runaway\" – 2:23\n* Digital download – Acoustic\n# \"Runaway\" (Acoustic) – 2:22\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n*Ryan Tedder – lead vocals\n*Zach Filkins – lead guitar\n*Drew Brown – rhythm guitar\n*Brent Kutzle – bass guitar, programming\n*Eddie Fisher – drums, percussion\n*Brian Willett – keyboards\nAdditional musicians\n*Joe Henderson – percussion\n*John Nathaniel – backing vocals, programming\n*Ben Samama – backing vocals\n*Will Vaughan – guitar\nProduction\n*Loren Ferard – production\n*Henderson – engineering\n*Kutzle – production\n*Nathaniel – production, mixing, engineering\n*Samama – production\n*Thomas Wolseley – engineering\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Runaway\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia Airplay (TopHit)\n| 9\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| San Marino (SMRRTV Top 50)\n| 3\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nMonthly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Monthly chart performance for \"Runaway\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia Airplay (TopHit)\n| 14\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for \"Runaway\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia Airplay (TopHit)\n| 35\n|-\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for \"Runaway\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)\n| 84\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia Airplay (TopHit)\n| 141\n|-\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
