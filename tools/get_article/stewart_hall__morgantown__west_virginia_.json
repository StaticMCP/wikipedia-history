It was built between 1900 and 1902, and consists of a gabled central block, a -story gabled entrance pavilion, and a monumental octagonal tower. It is built of reinforced concrete and coursed Amherst sandstone blocks and is in the Romanesque Revival style. The interior features a two-story, arcaded rotunda. It housed the university library until 1931, when it became the Administration Building.  It was renamed in the 1970s in honor of Irvin Stewart, president of the university from 1946 to 1958.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nReferences"
