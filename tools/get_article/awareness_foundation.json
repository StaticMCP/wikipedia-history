There were two co-founders; Bishop Michael Marshall was rector of Holy Trinity from 1997 to 2007, and Nadim Nassar was an assistant curate in the parish. The charity was later renamed the Awareness Foundation.\nProgrammes\nWork in the Middle East:\nAwareness Foundation Middle East is headed by Huda Nassar.

So far, \"over 700 young people have begun their journey to become Ambassadors for Peace, and much peace-building projects are now in development, including a center offering first aid training, a program to rehabilitate vulnerable street children, and an ecumenical dialogue project.\"\n* Little Heroes: The Awareness Foundation states on its website, \"In 2015, we decided to invite 200 (displaced children) to a special three-day Summer School to plant the seeds of love, trust, hope, and joy in their hearts so that they could overcome all they have faced and play an active role in their new homes, schools, and communities. \"Our Little Heroes program has already helped more than 2,000 displaced children in Syria to give them a new hope and new energy to live their life without fear. This enables them to build new bridges of respect and understanding with children of other faiths that they meet in their new homes and schools.\"\nRest of the World:\n* The PAX programme, is \"a growing online collection of short yet challenging faith-based videos.\" The program's goals are described as \"Through discussion of topics such as politics and faith, interfaith relationships, and how to combat extremism, PAX seeks to build peace by insisting upon compassion and respect.\n* The Awareness Forum consists of special events such as dinners, conferences, roundtable exchanges, and lectures, focuses on the religious and cultural issues of the day.\n* The Facing Faith program is described by the Foundation as \"A community-based initiative to promote peace and understanding across barriers of faith & culture\" by \"bringing together community and faith leaders from different religions and cultures to discuss ideas.\"\nAwareness Sunday\nThe foundation held an Awareness Sunday event in September for several years up to 2020.\nOn Sunday 11 September 2011, a special public service of remembrance and reconciliation for Awareness Sunday took place at Westminster Abbey.\nDenominations\nThe Awareness Foundation is ecumenical, with board members from the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, the Episcopal Church in the US and the Middle East, the Greek Orthodox Church, Presbyterian, Methodist and Baptist Churches and several charismatic evangelical churches.\nPersonnel\nMichael Marshall was the first Executive Director of the Foundation.
