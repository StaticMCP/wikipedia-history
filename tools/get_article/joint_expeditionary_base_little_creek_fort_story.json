The installation is made up of former U.S Army post Fort Story and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek. It was created as the result of the Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 process. It is commanded by the United States Navy.\nLittle Creek\nJoint Expeditionary Base Little Creek is the major operating base for the expeditionary forces in the United States Navy's Atlantic Fleet. The base comprises four locations in three states, including almost 12,000 acres (4,900&nbsp;ha) of real estate. Its Little Creek location in Virginia Beach, Virginia, totals 2,120 acres (860&nbsp;ha) acres of land. Outlying facilities include 350 acres (140&nbsp;ha) located just north of Training Support Center Hampton Roads in Virginia Beach and 21 acres (8.5&nbsp;ha) known as Radio Island at Morehead City, North Carolina, used as an amphibious embarkation/debarkation area for U.S. Marine Corps units at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.\nFort Story\nFort Story is located in Virginia Beach at Cape Henry at the entrance of the Chesapeake Bay.[2] It offers a unique combination of features including dunes, beaches, sand, surf, deep-water anchorage, variable tide conditions, maritime forest and open land. The base is the prime location and training environment for both Army amphibious operations and Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) training events.\nThe base includes 1,451 acres (5.9&nbsp;km²) of sandy trails, cypress swamps, maritime forest, grassy dunes and soft and hard sand beaches. The western beaches are wide, gently sloped and washed by the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Eastern beaches are exposed to the rougher waters of the Atlantic surf.\nExternal links\n*"
