Ben-Zvi stood again, and it was suggested that Yosef Yoel Rivlin (father of future president Reuven Rivlin) would run against him as a representative of Herut. However, in the end Rivlin did not participate in the election.\nAlthough Ben-Zvi was the only candidate, a vote was still held. He was re-elected with 76 of the 94 ballots cast; the other 18 votes were blank ballots. 26 Knesset members did not vote.\nBen-Zvi's second term began on the day of the election.\nResults\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://main.knesset.gov.il/en/activity/pages/presvotes.aspx Previous Presidential Elections] Knesset"
