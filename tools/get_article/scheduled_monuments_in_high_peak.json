Scheduled monuments are defined in the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the National Heritage Act 1983. There are about 20,000 scheduled monument entries on the list, which is maintained by English Heritage; more than one site can be included in a single entry.\nWhile a scheduled monument can also be recognised as a listed building, English Heritage considers listed building status as a better way of protecting buildings than scheduled monument status. If a monument is considered by English Heritage to \"no longer merit scheduling\" it can be descheduled.\nDerbyshire has over 500 scheduled monuments including many stone cairns, stone circles, barrow burial mounds, lead mining relics, ancient settlements, and over 20 bridges.\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Image\n!Name and reference\n!Feature\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n|Anglian high cross in the churchyard of St Peter's Church, Hope\n|Cross\n|Hope\n|Also a Grade II listed building. 9th-century gritstone cross with Celtic decoration.\n|-\n|\n|Anglo-Scandinavian high cross in the churchyard of St Thomas Becket Church\n|Cross\n|Chapel-en-le-Frith\n|Also a Grade II listed building.\n|-\n|\n|Anglo-Scandinavian high cross known as the Shall Cross\n|Cross\n|Whaley Bridge\n|9th- or 10th-century gritstone cross.
