It was hosted by Johnny Carson in New York, Bob Newhart in Los Angeles and David Brinkley in Washington, DC. All nominations are listed, with winners in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nThe top show of the night was the CBS courtroom drama The Defenders which swept the four major categories it was nominated in. The Bob Newhart Show won top honors for comedy, and in doing so, became the first show to win a top program prize (comedy or drama) for what would be the show's only season. Composer Richard Rodgers would also become the first person to complete the Grand Slam of entertainment awards (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony) when winning for Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composed with Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years.\nAmong the better-known presenters were Fred Astaire, Lucille Ball, Barbara Stanwyck, Judy Garland, Jimmy Durante, Jack Webb, Walter Brennan, Eartha Kitt, Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, and Cyril Ritchard, whose pronunciation of \"tomatoes\" as \"tomahtoes\" greatly amused the audience; he humorously apologized and repeated it with the American pronunciation.\nWinners and nominees\n, Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Series (Lead) winner]]\n, Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actress in a Series (Lead) winner]]\n, Outstanding Performance in a Supporting Role by an Actor winner]]\n, Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role winner]]\n, Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Drama winner]]\n, Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy winner]]\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'The Bob Newhart Show (NBC)'\n** The Andy Griffith Show (CBS)\n** Car 54, Where Are You?
