Memphis in the Early Bronze Age, with some 30,000 inhabitants, was the largest city of the time by far. Ebla is estimated to have had a population of 40,000 inhabitants in the Intermediate Bronze age. Ur in the Middle Bronze Age is estimated to have had some 65,000 inhabitants; Babylon in the Late Bronze Age similarly had a population of some 50,000–60,000. Niniveh had some 20,000–30,000, reaching 100,000 only in the Iron Age (around 700 BC).\nIn Akkadian and Hittite orthography, URU became a determinative sign denoting a city, or combined with KUR \"land\" the kingdom or territory controlled by a city, e.g.   \"the king of the country of (the city of) Ḫattuša\". The KI  determinative is used following place names (toponyms) in both Sumerian and Akkadian.\nMesopotamia\nLower Mesopotamia\nn cities in modern-day Iraq, Syria and Iran.]]\n.]]\n(ordered from north to south)\nUpper Mesopotamia\n(ordered from north to south)\n* Urfa\n* Shanidar cave\n* Urkesh (Urkish) (Tell Mozan)\n* Tell Leilan (Shekhna, Shubat-Enlil)\n* Tell Halaf\n* Tell Arbid\n* Harran\n* Chagar Bazar\n* Mardaman (Bassetki)\n* Kahat (Tell Barri)\n* Tell Fekheriye (Washukanni?)\n* Hadatu (Arslan Tash)\n* Carchemish (Djerabis)\n* Til Barsip (Tell Ahmar)\n* Tell Chuera\n* Al-Rawda\n* Nabada (Tell Beydar)\n* Nagar (Tell Brak)\n* Hamazi\n* Yarim Tepe\n* Telul eth-Thalathat\n* Tepe Gawra\n* Tell Arpachiyah (Tepe Reshwa)\n* Tell Maghzaliyah\n* Shibaniba (Tell Billa)\n* Tarbisu (Sherif Khan)\n* Nineveh (Ninua)\n* Qatara or Karana (Tell al-Rimah)\n* Tell Hamoukar\n* Dur Sharrukin (Khorsabad)\n* Tell Shemshara  (Shusharra)\n* Bestansur\n* Tell Bazmusian\n* Erbil (Urbilim, Arba-Ilu)\n* Kurd Qaburstan (Qabra?)\n* Qasr Shemamok  (Kilizu/Kilizi/Kakzu)\n* Qal'at Jarmo\n* Tell Taya\n* Tell Hassuna\n* Balawat (Imgur-Enlil)\n* Tell es-Sweyhat\n* Tell Hadidi (Azu)\n* Mumbaqat (Tall Munbāqa, Ekalte)\n* Nimrud\n* Emar (Tell Meskene)\n* Tall Bazi (Baṣīru, Armanum?)\n* Arrapha\n* Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta\n* Assur\n* Ekallatum\n* Nuzi (Yorghan Tepe, Gasur)\n* Tell al-Fakhar (Kurruhanni?)\n* Tell Taban (Ṭābetu, Ṭābatum)\n* Terqa (Tell Ashara)\n* Doura Europos\n* Mari (Tell Hariri)\n* Tuttul (''Tell Bi'a)\n* Haradum (Khirbet ed-Diniyeh)\n* Tell es-Sawwan\n* Nerebtum or Kiti (Tell Ishchali)\n* Tell Agrab\n* Dur-Kurigalzu (Aqar Quf)\n* Shaduppum (Tell Harmal'')\n* Tell al-Dhiba'i\n* Tell Muhammad\n* Seleucia\n* Ctesiphon (Taq Kisra)\n* Zenobia (Halabiye)\n* Hatra\n* Idu\n* Rabana-Merquly (Natounia?)\nIran\nAnatolia (Turkey)\n(ordered from north to south)\nLevant\nArabian Peninsula\n, separated by just a few miles of the Red Sea, have a history of related settlements, especially near the coast]]\nCyprus\n* Enkomi\n* Idalion\n* Kition\n* Kourion (Koύριov, Curium)\nNubia\n* Jebel Barkal\n* Kerma\n* Meroë\n* Napata\nHorn of Africa\n* Adulis\n* Aksum (Axum)\n* Keskese\n* Matara\n* Qohaito\n* Sembel\n* Yeha\nEgypt\nSee also\n* City-state\n* Sumerian King List\n* Historical urban community sizes\n* Short chronology timeline\n* List of oldest continuously inhabited cities\n*Ancient towns in Saudi Arabia\n*List of Ancient Settlements in the UAE\n*List of largest cities in the Levant region by population\n*List of largest metropolitan areas of the Middle East\n*List of modern names for biblical place names\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.dvidshub.net/?script=news/news_show.php&id=40707 Geospatial: Mapping Iraq's Ancient Cities]\n* [https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/0222/Ancient-cities-grew-pretty-much-like-modern-ones-say-scientists Ancient cities grew pretty much like modern ones, say scientists] (February 2015), Christian Science Monitor"
