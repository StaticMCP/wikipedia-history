The mountain consists of three snow- and ice-covered summits and its northwest face is the source of the Fedchenko Glacier.\nThe peak was originally named Dreispitz by a joint Russian–German team who discovered it in 1928, but failed to climb it due to deep snow and avalanche danger. The first ascent was made in 1954 by a Russian team led by A. Ugarov. After World War II, Dreispitz was renamed Revolution Peak (, Qullai Inkilob), and in July 2006 it was given its current name.\nAccidents\nBritish Climbers Simon Spencer-Jones (26) and Ian Hatcher (26) disappeared in 2005, attempting to summit Peak Revolution via the Fenchenko Glacier with the University of Bristol Climbing Club. They departed base camp on 13 July and did not return at the planned date of 18 July. Two helicopters assisted in a ground and air search but no bodies were found, it is thought both climbers were killed as a result of 3&nbsp;ft of snow that fell over 48 hours.\nSee also\n* List of Ultras of Central Asia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101001060108/http://mountains.tos.ru/revolu.htm A description of Revolution Peak and its surroundings, with images]\n*\n* Revolution Peak renamed Independence Peak by [https://web.archive.org/web/20071129202606/http://www.president.tj/qaror04_297htm.htm Resolution No. 297 of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, July 4, 2006]."
