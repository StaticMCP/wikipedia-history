The plaza features Jay Rood's 1992 sculpture Boat of Discovery. Made of metal, concrete, and brick, the artwork's dedication \"coincided with the bicentennial celebration of the exploration and naming of the Columbia River in 1792\". The site and sculpture, also known as the Captain George Vancouver Monument, have been included in walking tours of Vancouver.\nFile:Vancouver, Washington, October 2020 - 068.jpg\nFile:Vancouver, Washington, October 2020 - 072.jpg\nFile:Vancouver, Washington, October 2020 - 073.jpg\nFile:Vancouver, Washington, October 2020 - 227.jpg\nSee also\n* List of public art in Vancouver, Washington\nReferences"
