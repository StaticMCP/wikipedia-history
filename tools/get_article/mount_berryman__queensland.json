In the , Mount Berryman had a population of 96 people.\nGeography\nSandy Creek enters the locality from the south (Thornton) and exits to the north (Blenheim). The terrain varies from  above sea level with the lower elevations by the creek and rising to the east and west of the creek. Despite the name of the locality, there is no mountain feature of that same name.\nThe land use is predominantly grazing on native vegetation.\nMount Berryman Road enters the locality from the north (Blenheim), loosely follows the creek (crossing it from time to time), and exists to the south (Thornton).\nHistory\nThe district was originally known as Upper Sandy Creek.\nIn 1880s, when local residents applied to the Queensland Government to establish a school, they proposed that the school be established in a building on a selection taken up by Richard Berryman which he subsequently abandoned. The government agreed to the plan, but objected to calling the school Upper Sandy Creek due to Sandy Creek being a very common name in Queensland, so the residents proposed to name it Mount Berryman. Mount Berryman State School opened on 25 May 1886 and closed on 27 May 1977. It was at 72 Mount Berryman Road ().\nIn 1894, a non-denominational  Sunday school was established using the school building. From 1907, the Blenheim Baptist Church took over the responsibility for the Sunday School. The Sunday school celebrated its diamond jubilee in 1954.\nIn 1943, the former Methodist Church building at Blenheim was relocated to Mount Berryman on land donated by Mr H. Wood and opened as the Mount Berryman Baptist Church. In 2007, the Mount Berryman Baptist Church was relocated to the Laidley Pioneer Village.\nDemographics\nIn the , Mount Berryman had a population of 109 people.\nIn the , Mount Berryman had a population of 96 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Mount Berryman.
