It sought to bring together professionals from the public sector, the third sector, Councillors, youth organisations, and most importantly young people, to discuss, \"How do we enable more young people to get involved in volunteering and social action?\"\nThe conference was being jointly hosted by The Portsmouth Together Partnership, Pompey in the Community and Portsmouth Youth Voice and in association with Step Up To Serve and the #iwill campaign.\nEligibility and voting\nNominees for the six main categories (young person, teacher, school, public sector organisation, community organisation and youth organisation) were sought from the public, particularly young people.

These were then assessed by young people in the city in order to choose a winner.\nNominations for the Youth Voice Star of the year were drawn from those nominated for other awards, as well as on the recommendation of the chair of Portsmouth Youth Voice, the director of The Youth Voice Network and the chief service officer of Portsmouth Together. These were assessed by a panel put together by The Youth Voice Network.\nTV and media coverage\nThe 2017 awards received coverage on About My Area, a local news website.\nAwards\nIn 2017, there were 7 categories up for grabs, six of which were nominated by young people in the city.
