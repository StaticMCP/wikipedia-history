In 2021, an all new \"Family-Life Center\" was built next to the Calvary Baptist Church.\nHistory\nIn 1982, Pastor Roger Baker of Calvary Baptist Church in King, North Carolina had a desire to reach young children to Christ and Calvary Christian School was established. Tom Callahan was the first principal of CCS. Currently, Bradley Nagel is the Principal. Anthony Keel is currently the longest running teacher at CCS.\nOn March 12, 2020, CCS was dramatically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic which led to remote learning for the remainder of the school year. However, CCS began the 2020–2021 school year with no issues and in-class learning while observing social distancing guidelines and masks were optional.\nIn 2021, a new school building was built next to the Calvary Baptist Church. The 2022–23 school year was the first school year to feature this building.\nReferences"
