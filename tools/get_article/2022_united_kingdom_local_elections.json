These included elections for all London borough councils, and for all local authorities in Wales and Scotland. Most seats in England were last up for election in 2018 and in Scotland and Wales in 2017. The elections coincided with the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. In 91 cases, most of them in Wales, council seats were uncontested, each having only one candidate. Three seats in Scotland remained unfilled as no one nominated to fill them.\nThe local elections took place amid the Partygate scandal, in which it was found that numerous parties had been held at 10 Downing Street during national COVID-19 lockdowns, and COVID-19 social distancing laws were breached by numerous individuals. Public dissatisfaction over the events led to a decline in public support for Boris Johnson, the government led by him, and the Conservatives as a whole.\nAcross Great Britain, the governing Conservative Party had a net loss of 485 seats in comparison to 2017 in Scotland and Wales and 2018 in England, whilst Labour gained 108 seats (22 in England, 20 in Scotland, and 66 in Wales). The Liberal Democrats and Greens made gains of 224 seats and 87 seats, respectively, which exceeded those of the Labour Party in England but were also seen to a more modest extent in Scotland and Wales.\nBackground\nIn total, 4,411 council seats were contested in England, including irregular by-elections.\nMost seats in England up for election in 2022 were last elected in 2018. The exceptions are local authorities which have undergone recent boundary reviews. In the 2018 local elections, the Labour Party made gains in London at the expense of the Conservative Party, who in turn made gains in the rest of England at the expense of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). Few councils changed overall control. Overall, UKIP lost 237 of the 243 seats it had held before the elections. According to the BBC's analysis, the results reflected a national political situation with Labour and the Conservatives \"neck-and-neck\".\nOverall results\nAcross Great Britain, the Conservatives had a net loss of 485 seats in comparison to 2017 in Scotland and Wales and 2018 in England, whilst Labour gained 108 seats (22 in England, 20 in Scotland, and 66 in Wales). The Liberal Democrats and Greens made gains of 224 seats and 87 seats, respectively, which exceeded those of the Labour Party in England but were also seen to a more modest extent in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish National Party (SNP) gained 22 seats in Scotland whilst Plaid Cymru had a net loss of 6 seats in Wales.\n{| id=\"results\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Party\n! colspan=\"3\" | Councillors\n! colspan=\"3\" | Councils\n|-\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"| Won\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|After\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|+/-\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|Won\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|After\n!  style=\"width:50px;\"|+/-\n|-\n|\n|1,403\n|7,159\n|485\n|35\n|126\n|11\n|-\n|\n|3,073\n|6,100\n|108\n|74\n|88\n|5\n|-\n|\n|868\n|2,765\n|224\n|16\n|27\n|3\n|-\n|\n|159\n|568\n|87\n|0\n|0\n|\n|-\n|\n|453\n|453\n|22\n|0\n|1\n|\n|-\n|\n|202\n|202\n|6\n|0\n|4\n|3\n|-\n|\n|24\n|24\n|24\n|1\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|\n|2\n|7\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|\n|-\n|\n|646\n|  2,190\n|2\n|3\n|8\n|1\n|-\n|\n| colspan=3\n|66\n|132\n|1\n|-\n|}\nEngland\nBy party\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Results of the 2022 council elections in England\n|-\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2| Party\n! colspan=2 | Councils\n! colspan=2 | Councillors\n! colspan=2 | Mayors\n|-\n!

These are first-past-the-post or block voting elections, with a mixture of single-member and multi-member electoral divisions. County councils are elected in full every four years, with the last election having been in 2021. However, due to consultations about possible unitarisation, elections for three county councils were postponed to 2022. The government has announced plans to replace the councils with unitary authorities pending Parliamentary approval.\nElections to the new Somerset Council took place on 5 May 2022 for a unitary authority to run concurrently with the district councils until their abolition in April 2023. In a similar way, members of North Yorkshire Council were elected at the same time, with its councillors to serve as county councillors for one year and then to serve an additional four-year term as unitary councillors. Cumbria's two new unitary authorities were elected as \"shadow authorities\" which would go live after gaining their powers in 2023.\nLondon boroughs\nElections for all councillors in all thirty-two London boroughs were held in 2022 in line with their normal election schedule. All twenty-five London borough councils which have not had a boundary review since before 2013 were elected based on new boundaries. The previous elections to London borough councils were held in 2018, which saw Labour win its second-best result in any London election and the Conservatives return their lowest-ever number of councillors in the capital. In 2018, Labour won control of Tower Hamlets council which had previously been under no overall control, but did not gain control of Barnet, Wandsworth or Westminster councils, which the party had targeted. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats gained control of Kingston upon Thames and Richmond upon Thames borough councils from the Conservatives.\nThe 2022 elections saw Labour gain all three of Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster councils which they had unsuccessfully targeted in 2018. The Conservatives gained control of Harrow from Labour as well as winning the new position of mayor of Croydon, with Croydon's council under no overall control, having previously been control by Labour. Lutfur Rahman gained the position of mayor of Tower Hamlets from Labour, with his Aspire party winning a majority of seats.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Barking and Dagenham\n| 51\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Barnet\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Bexley\n| 45\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Brent\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Bromley\n| 58\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Camden\n| 55\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Croydon\n| 70\n|\n|  (Conservative minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Ealing\n| 70\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Enfield\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Greenwich\n| 55\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hackney\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hammersmith and Fulham\n| 50\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Haringey\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Harrow\n| 55\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Havering\n| 55\n|  (Conservative/independent coalition)\n|  (HRA/Labour coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Hillingdon\n| 53\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hounslow\n| 62\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Islington\n| 51\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Kensington and Chelsea\n| 50\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Kingston upon Thames\n| 48\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Lambeth\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Lewisham\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Merton\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Newham\n| 66\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Redbridge\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Richmond upon Thames\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Southwark\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Sutton\n| 55\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Tower Hamlets\n| 45\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Waltham Forest\n| 60\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Wandsworth\n| 58\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Westminster\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | All 32 councils\n! 1,817\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|}\nMetropolitan boroughs\nThere are thirty-six metropolitan boroughs, which are single-tier local authorities. Thirty-three of them elect a third of their councillors every year for three years, with no election in each fourth year. These councils hold their elections on the same timetable, which includes elections in 2022. Birmingham City Council holds its elections on a four-year cycle from 2018, so was due to hold an election in 2022. Due to boundary changes, three councils which generally elect their councillors in thirds elected all of their councillors in 2022. They then returned to the thirds schedule, apart from St Helens Council, which moved to all-out elections every four years starting in 2022. Several other boundary reviews were delayed to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The scheduled elections in Liverpool in 2022 were cancelled and instead the city moved to all-out elections from 2023 on new ward boundaries.\nElections for all councillors\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Birmingham\n| 101\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Bury\n| 51\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Rochdale\n| 60\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| St Helens\n| 48\n|\n|\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | 4 councils\n! 260\n! colspan=\"6\" |\n|}\nElection for one third of councillors\nBy-elections or uncontested wards can cause the seats up for election to be above or below one third of the council.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! colspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! up\n! of\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Barnsley\n| 21\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Bolton\n| 20\n| 60\n|  (Conservative minority)\n|  (Conservative minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Bradford\n| 30\n| 90\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Calderdale\n| 18\n| 51\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Coventry\n| 18\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Dudley\n| 25\n| 72\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Gateshead\n| 22\n| 66\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Kirklees\n| 23\n| 69\n|  (Labour minority)\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Knowsley\n| 15\n| 45\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Leeds\n| 35\n| 99\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Manchester\n| 32\n| 96\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Newcastle upon Tyne\n| 27\n| 78\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| North Tyneside\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Oldham\n| 21\n| 60\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Salford\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Sandwell\n| 24\n| 72\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Sefton\n| 22\n| 66\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Sheffield\n| 28\n| 84\n|  (Labour/Green coalition)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Solihull\n| 17\n| 51\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| South Tyneside\n| 19\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Stockport\n| 21\n| 63\n|  (Labour minority)\n|  (Lib Dem minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Sunderland\n| 25\n| 75\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Tameside\n| 19\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Trafford\n| 22\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Wakefield\n| 21\n| 63\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Walsall\n| 21\n| 60\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Wigan\n| 26\n| 75\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Wirral\n| 23\n| 66\n|  (Labour minority)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Wolverhampton\n| 20\n| 60\n|\n|\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | All 29 councils\n! 655\n! 1,932\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|}\nDistrict councils\nElection of all councillors\nSome councils which elect all their councillors every four years did so in 2022. Gosport usually elects its councillors in halves, but all seats were up for election due to new election boundaries. St Albans usually elects by thirds but all seats were up on new boundaries. Harrogate was due to elect all its councillors, but the election was cancelled due to the unitarisation of North Yorkshire, with councillors' terms being extended to April 2023, after which the district councils in North Yorkshire ceased to exist.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Gosport\n| 28\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Huntingdonshire\n| 52\n|\n|  (Lib Dem/Independent/Labour/Green coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Newcastle-under-Lyme\n| 44\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| South Cambridgeshire\n| 45\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| St Albans\n| 56\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" |  All 5 councils\n! 225\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|}\nElection of councillors by halves\nDistrict councils which elect their candidates in halves did so in 2022.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! colspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! up\n! of\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Adur\n| 14\n| 29\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Cheltenham\n| 21\n| 40\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Fareham\n| 16\n| 31\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hastings\n| 16\n| 32\n|\n|  (Labour/Green coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Nuneaton and Bedworth\n| 17\n| 34\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Oxford\n| 24\n| 48\n|\n|\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | All 6 councils\n! 108\n! 214\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|}\nElection of councillors by thirds\nDistrict councils which elect by thirds that held elections in 2022.

The new unitary authority Somerset Council held its first election under the old Somerset County Council boundaries, with twice as many councillors being elected as previously. Shadow authorities for the two new unitary authorities replacing Cumbria County Council and its districts were elected, as were councillors for the new North Yorkshire Council ahead of its creation in 2023.\nNotably, the count for the Skipton West and West Craven seat ended in a tie between independent candidate Andy Solloway and the Labour candidate Peter Madeley. After various methods for deciding the tie were mooted, including drawing from a deck of cards, the candidates drew straws with Andy Solloway drawing the long straw, thus being declared the winner.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Cumberland\n| 46\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Reading\n| 48\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| North Yorkshire\n| 90\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Somerset\n| 110\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Westmorland and Furness\n| 65\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | All 5 councils\n! 359\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|}\nElection of councillors by thirds\nUnitary authorities that elect councillors in thirds did so in 2022.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! colspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! up\n! of\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Blackburn with Darwen\n| 18\n| 51\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Derby\n| 17\n| 51\n|  (Conservative minority)\n|  (Conservative minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Halton\n| 18\n| 54\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Hartlepool\n| 13\n| 36\n|  (independent/Conservative coalition)\n|  (independent/Conservative coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Hull\n| 19\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Milton Keynes\n| 19\n| 57\n|  (Labour/Lib Dem coalition)\n|  (Labour/Lib Dem coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| North East Lincolnshire\n| 16\n| 42\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Peterborough\n| 19\n| 60\n|  (Conservative minority)\n|  (Conservative minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Plymouth\n| 19\n| 57\n|  (Conservative minority)\n|  (Conservative majority after party changes)\n| Details\n|-\n| Portsmouth\n| 14\n| 42\n|  (Lib Dem minority)\n|  (Lib Dem minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Slough\n| 14\n| 42\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Southampton\n| 17\n| 48\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Southend-on-Sea\n| 18\n| 51\n|  (Labour/independent/Lib Dem coalition)\n|  (Labour/independent/Lib Dem coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Swindon\n| 19\n| 57\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Thurrock\n| 16\n| 49\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Wokingham\n| 18\n| 54\n|\n|  (Lib Dem/Labour/independent coalition)\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | All 16 councils\n! 274\n! 808\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|}\nCity of London Corporation\nThe Court of Common Council is the main decision-making body of the City of London Corporation, which governs the City of London.

The vote is held using the single transferable vote, which allows voters to rank their choices.]]\nElections were held for all councillors in all 32 local authorities in Scotland. Local elections in Scotland are conducted by the single transferable vote (STV), which results in the number of seats won by each party more proportionally reflecting their share of the vote. As a consequence, local elections in Scotland result more often in no overall control and local authorities being governed by minority or coalition administrations.\nIn this election two of the 32 councils came under one-party majorities - Dundee (SNP) and West Dunbartonshire (Labour).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Council\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" | Party control\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Details\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Previous\n! colspan=\"2\" | New\n|-\n| Aberdeen\n| 45\n|  (Labour/Conservative/independent coalition)\n|  (SNP/Lib Dem coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Aberdeenshire\n| 70\n|  (Conservative/Lib Dem/independent coalition)\n|  (Conservative/Lib Dem/independent coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Angus\n| 28\n|  (Lib Dem/Conservative/independent coalition)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Argyll and Bute\n| 36\n|  (Lib Dem/Conservative/independent coalition)\n|  (Lib Dem/Conservative/independent coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Clackmannanshire\n| 18\n|  (SNP minority)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Dumfries and Galloway\n| 43\n|  (Labour/SNP coalition)\n|  (Labour/SNP/Lib Dem/independent coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Dundee\n| 29\n|  (SNP minority)\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| East Ayrshire\n| 32\n|  (SNP minority)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| East Dunbartonshire\n| 22\n|  (Lib Dem/Conservative coalition)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| East Lothian\n| 22\n|  (Labour minority)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| East Renfrewshire\n| 18\n|  (SNP/Labour/Independent coalition)\n|  (Labour/Independent minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Edinburgh\n| 63\n|  (SNP/Labour coalition)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Falkirk\n| 30\n|  (SNP minority)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Fife\n| 75\n|  (SNP/Labour coalition)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Glasgow\n| 85\n|  (SNP minority)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Highland\n| 74\n|  (independent/Lib Dem/Labour coalition)\n|  (SNP/independent coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Inverclyde\n| 22\n|  (Labour minority)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Midlothian\n| 18\n|  (Labour minority)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Moray\n| 26\n|  (SNP minority)\n|  (Conservative minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Na h-Eileanan Siar\n| 29\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| North Ayrshire\n| 33\n|  (Labour minority)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| North Lanarkshire\n| 77\n|  (Labour minority)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Orkney\n| 21\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| Perth and Kinross\n| 40\n|  (Conservative/independent coalition)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Renfrewshire\n| 43\n|  (SNP minority)\n|  (SNP minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Scottish Borders\n| 34\n|  (Conservative minority)\n|  (Conservative/independent coalition)\n| Details\n|-\n| Shetland\n| 23\n|\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| South Ayrshire\n| 28\n|  (SNP/Labour/independent coalition)\n|  (Conservative minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| South Lanarkshire\n| 64\n|  (SNP minority)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| Stirling\n| 23\n|  (SNP/Labour coalition)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|-\n| West Dunbartonshire\n| 22\n|  (SNP minority)\n|\n| Details\n|-\n| West Lothian\n| 33\n|  (Labour minority)\n|  (Labour minority)\n| Details\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | All 32 councils\n! 1,226\n! colspan=\"5\" |\n|}\nWales\nElections were held for all councillors in all 22 local authorities as well as for all community council seats in Wales.
