A circle that is rotated around any diameter generates a sphere of which it is then a great circle, and if the circle is rotated around an axis that does not intersect the interior of a circle, then it generates a torus which does not intersect itself (a ring torus).\nProperties\nThe sections of the surface of revolution made by planes through the axis are called meridional sections. Any meridional section can be considered to be the generatrix in the plane determined by it and the axis.\nThe sections of the surface of revolution made by planes that are perpendicular to the axis are circles.\nSome special cases of hyperboloids (of either one or two sheets) and elliptic paraboloids are surfaces of revolution. These may be identified as those quadratic surfaces all of whose cross sections perpendicular to the axis are circular.\nArea formula\nIf the curve is described by the parametric functions , , with  ranging over some interval , and the axis of revolution is the -axis, then the surface area  is given by the integral\nA_y = 2 \\pi \\int_a^b x(t) \\, \\sqrt{\\left({dx \\over dt}\\right)^2 + \\left({dy \\over dt}\\right)^2} \\, dt,\nprovided that  is never negative between the endpoints  and . This formula is the calculus equivalent of  Pappus's centroid theorem. The quantity\n\\sqrt{ \\left({dx \\over dt}\\right)^2 + \\left({dy \\over dt}\\right)^2 } \\, dt\ncomes from the Pythagorean theorem and represents a small segment of the arc of the curve, as in the arc length formula. The quantity  is the path of (the centroid of) this small segment, as required by Pappus' theorem.\nLikewise, when the axis of rotation is the -axis and provided that  is never negative, the area is given by\nA_x = 2 \\pi \\int_a^b y(t) \\, \\sqrt{\\left({dx \\over dt}\\right)^2 + \\left({dy \\over dt}\\right)^2} \\, dt.\nIf the continuous curve is described by the function , , then the integral becomes\nA_x = 2\\pi\\int_a^b y \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2} \\, dx = 2\\pi\\int_a^bf(x)\\sqrt{1+\\big(f'(x)\\big)^2} \\, dx\nfor revolution around the -axis, and\nA_y =2\\pi\\int_a^b x \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2} \\, dx\nfor revolution around the y-axis (provided ). These come from the above formula.\nThis can also be derived from multivariable integration. If a plane curve is given by \\langle x(t), y(t) \\rangle then its corresponding surface of revolution when revolved around the x-axis has Cartesian coordinates given by \\mathbf{r}(t, \\theta) = \\langle y(t)\\cos(\\theta), y(t)\\sin(\\theta), x(t)\\rangle with 0 \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi. Then the surface area is given by the surface integral\nA_x = \\iint_S dS = \\iint_{[a, b] \\times [0, 2\\pi]} \\left\\|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial t} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\theta}\\right\\|\\ d\\theta\\ dt = \\int_a^b \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left\\|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial t} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\theta}\\right\\|\\ d\\theta\\ dt.\nComputing the partial derivatives yields\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial t} = \\left\\langle \\frac{dy}{dt} \\cos(\\theta), \\frac{dy}{dt} \\sin(\\theta), \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right\\rangle,\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\theta} = \\langle -y \\sin(\\theta), y \\cos(\\theta), 0 \\rangle\nand computing the cross product yields\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial t} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\theta}\n= \\left\\langle y \\cos(\\theta)\\frac{dx}{dt}, y \\sin(\\theta)\\frac{dx}{dt}, y \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right\\rangle\n= y \\left\\langle \\cos(\\theta)\\frac{dx}{dt}, \\sin(\\theta)\\frac{dx}{dt}, \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right\\rangle\nwhere the trigonometric identity \\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1 was used. With this cross product, we get\n\\begin{align}\nA_x\n&= \\int_a^b \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left\\|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial t} \\times \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{r}}{\\partial \\theta}\\right\\|\\ d\\theta\\ dt \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\int_a^b \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left\\|y \\left\\langle y \\cos(\\theta)\\frac{dx}{dt}, y \\sin(\\theta)\\frac{dx}{dt}, y \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right\\rangle \\right\\|\\ d\\theta\\ dt \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\int_a^b \\int_0^{2\\pi} y \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\theta)\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt} \\right)^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta)\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^2}\\ d\\theta\\ dt \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\int_a^b \\int_0^{2\\pi} y \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt} \\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2}\\ d\\theta\\ dt \\\\[1ex]\n&= \\int_a^b 2\\pi y \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt} \\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2}\\ dt\n\\end{align}\nwhere the same trigonometric identity was used again. The derivation for a surface obtained by revolving around the y-axis is similar.\nFor example, the spherical surface with unit radius is generated by the curve , , when  ranges over .  Its area is therefore\n\\begin{align}\nA\n&{}= 2 \\pi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(t) \\sqrt{\\big(\\cos(t)\\big)^2 + \\big(\\sin(t)\\big)^2} \\, dt \\\\\n&{}= 2 \\pi \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(t) \\, dt \\\\\n&{}= 4\\pi.\n\\end{align}\nFor the case of the spherical curve with radius , }} rotated about the -axis\n\\begin{align}\nA\n&= 2 \\pi \\int_{-r}^{r} \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{x^2}{r^2 - x^2}}\\,dx \\\\\n&= 2 \\pi r\\int_{-r}^{r} \\,\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r^2 - x^2}}\\,dx \\\\\n&= 2 \\pi r\\int_{-r}^{r} \\,dx \\\\\n&= 4 \\pi r^2\\,\n\\end{align}\nA minimal surface of revolution is the surface of revolution of the curve between two given points which minimizes surface area. A basic problem in the calculus of variations is finding the curve between two points that produces this minimal surface of revolution.\nThere are only two minimal surfaces of revolution (surfaces of revolution which are also minimal surfaces): the plane and the catenoid.\nCoordinate expressions\nA surface of revolution given by rotating a curve described by y = f(x) around the x-axis may be most simply described by y^2+z^2 = f(x)^2. This yields the parametrization in terms of x and \\theta as (x,f(x) \\cos(\\theta), f(x) \\sin(\\theta)). If instead we revolve the curve around the y-axis, then the curve is described by y = f(\\sqrt{x^2+z^2}), yielding the expression (x \\cos(\\theta), f(x), x \\sin(\\theta)) in terms of the parameters x and \\theta.\nIf x and y are defined in terms of a parameter t, then we obtain a parametrization in terms of t and \\theta. If x and y are functions of t, then the surface of revolution obtained by revolving the curve around the x-axis is described by (x(t),y(t)\\cos(\\theta), y(t)\\sin(\\theta)), and the surface of revolution obtained by revolving the curve around the y-axis is described by (x(t)\\cos(\\theta),y(t),x(t)\\sin(\\theta) ).\nGeodesics\nMeridians are always geodesics on a surface of revolution. Other geodesics are governed by Clairaut's relation.\nToroids\nA surface of revolution with a hole in, where the axis of revolution does not intersect the surface, is called a toroid. For example, when a rectangle is rotated around an axis parallel to one of its edges, then a hollow square-section ring is produced. If the revolved figure is a circle, then the object is called a torus.\nSee also\n* Channel surface, a generalisation of a surface of revolution\n* Cylindrical symmetry\n* Gabriel's Horn\n* Generalized helicoid\n* Lemon (geometry), surface of revolution of a circular arc\n* Liouville surface, another generalization of a surface of revolution\n* Spheroid\n* Surface integral\n* Translation surface (differential geometry)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
