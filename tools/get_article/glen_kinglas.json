The glen is one of the main glens in the Arrochar Alps, the A83 road from Arrochar and Loch Lomond passes through the glen. At the north end of the glen, a pass leads to Glen Croe, passing Loch Restil. At the south of the glen the A815 road leaves the A83 and leads through the Cowal Peninsula to Dunoon on the Firth of Clyde coast. The A83 continues on past Cairndow and Loch Fyne Oysters to Inveraray and Inveraray Castle on Loch Fyne.\nThe glen has the Kinglas Water running through it which runs under the Butter Bridge, one of the sources is Loch Restil, located in the pass between Glen Kinglas and Glen Croe.\nThe Butter Bridge carpark in the glen, gives easy access to the hills and mountains in the area for hillwalkers and climbers. The glen gives access to Beinn an Lochain the highest peak on the Cowal peninsula at .\nThe Mountain Bothies Association opened a Bothy within the glen in May 2022, called Abyssinia.
