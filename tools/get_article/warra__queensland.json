The run was  operated by Henry Dennis in the late 1840s, then by Colin McKenzie from 1848, then by Mr Thorne circa 1864.

The mine yielded a total 13,528 tons of coal, and the net financial result was a loss of £38,058.\nThe Warra Honour Board was unveiled on 14 May 1917 by Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly in Dalby,  William Vowles.\nLlanberris Provisional School opened on 17 November 1919 and closed on 27 April 1923.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Warra had a population of 84 people.\nIn the , the locality of Warra had a population of 205 people.\nIn the , the locality of Warra had a population of 180 people.\nEconomy\nThere are a number of homesteads in the locality:\n* Barooga ()\n* Caramar ()\n* Clover-Lea ()\n* Coolden ()\n* David Downs ()\n* Devonia ()\n* Ferndale ()\n* Glengrove ()\n* Glennesk ()\n* Gracevale ()\n* Grasslands ()\n* Jinghi Jinghi ()\n* Kareelah ()\n* Logie ()\n* Maudlands ()\n* Maylingup ()\n* Mylin Park ()\n* Parkina ()\n* Rakaia ()\n* Renbar ()\n* The Mead ()\n* Trumpeters Corner ()\n* Vickeries ()\n* Warruga ()\n* Waverley ()\n* Windale ()\n* Winya Park (abandoned) ()\n* Wruwallin ()\n* Wywurrie ()\nEducation\nWarra State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Robinson Street ().
