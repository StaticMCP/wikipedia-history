The term was dropped from the Forest Code of 1965, and the tax exemptions dropped the next year.\nHowever, the Hunting Code of 1967 gave property owners the ability to prevent hunting on their property.\nIn 1977 the legal entity of a \"Private Refuge for Native Animals\" was introduced, in which hunting would be banned.\nThis was replaced ten years later by \"Private Fauna and Flora Reserve\" to cover protection of flora and marine fauna in addition to wild animals.\nIn 1990 the new name \"Private Natural Heritage Reserve\" was adopted with new rules, including the possibility of recognition of RPPN's by state environmental agencies, a more democratic and perhaps less bureaucratic process.\nFinally, the concept of the RPPN was spelled out in Law No. 9.985 of 18 July 2000, which established the National System of Conservation Units (SNUC).\nAs of January 2009 it was estimated that there were between 856 and 930 RPPN's in Brazil covering about , including units recognized at the federal, state and municipal levels.\nAs of September 2009 there were 532 federally-recognized RPPN's covering .\nVarious regional associations provide technical support to RPPN owners.\nDefinition\n]]\nA private natural heritage reserve is a sustainable use conservation unit under SNUC.\nSuch units allow sustained use of renewable environmental resources, maintaining biodiversity and other ecological attributes.\nThe reserves are established in private areas in perpetuity to preserve biodiversity.\nThe owner is given incentives such as tax exemption.\nThe SNUC specifies that sustainable use of the renewable environmental resources must be compatible with the essential ecological processes, maintaining biodiversity and ecological attributes.\nSustainable use in this case includes scientific research and public visits for tourism, recreation and education.\nValue\nRPPN's have been criticized for failing to conform to an overall plan for conservation at a national or regional level, for being dependent on the will of the owners, for being too small to have any effect in such a huge country and for lack of monitoring of RPPN management or effectiveness.\nOn the other hand, RPPN's may have value due to their independence of political forces and their creation of additional protected areas on private land that may provide landscape connectivity, wildlife corridors and buffer zones around the other protected areas.\nPrivate and public agencies can help protect, manage and monitor an RPPN.\nAnd an RPPN, which is created without expropriations and gives value to the owner, may create less conflict than publicly owned units and more community involvement and awareness of the value of environmental conservation, restoration and research.\nExamples\nin Buraco das Araras RPPN ]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name !!
