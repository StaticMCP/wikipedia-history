Each of the state governments of the United States maintains a series of military decorations for issuance to members of the National Guard, with such awards presented under the authority of the various state adjutants general.\nActive or reserve federal forces veterans who subsequently serve in the National Guard wear all federal awards first, then state awards. Those National Guard soldiers and airmen who subsequently serve in the active or reserve federal forces of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or United States Air Force (i.e., as active duty or reserve members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard) may not continue to wear and display such decorations on a military uniform, unless such activation is under Title 32 status. Active duty regulations allow federal soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines to accept but not to wear state awards.\nMost states authorize the wear of other states' awards if a soldier or airman has earned awards from a state or territory to which he or she is not presently assigned. The order of precedence is typically the presently assigned state, followed by awards from the District of Columbia, then other states by their order of admission.\nThe following is a list of National Guard decorations, as issued by each of the fifty United States; Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia.\nAlabama\nAlabama National Guard State Awards:\n*  Alabama Distinguished Service Medal\n*  Alabama Commendation Medal\n*  Alabama Phenix City Civil Disturbance Medal\n*  Alabama Operation Desert Storm Ribbon\n*  Alabama Veterans Service Medal\n*  Alabama National Emergency Service Medal\n*  Alabama Special Service Medal\n*  Alabama Faithful Service Medal\n*  Alabama Recruiting Ribbon\n*  Alabama Active Duty Basic Training Medal\nAlaska\nAlaska National Guard State Awards:\n*  Alaska Decoration of Honor\n*  Alaska Heroism Medal\n*  Alaska Distinguished Service Medal\n*  Alaska Legion of Merit\n*  Alaska Meritorious Service Medal\n*  Alaska Air Medal\n*  Alaska Commendation Medal\n*  Alaska Achievement Medal\n*  Alaska Humanitarian Service Medal\n*  Alaska State Service Medal\n*  Alaska Community Service Medal\n*  Alaska Domestic Emergency Ribbon\n*   Alaska Marksmanship Medal\n*  Alaska Homeland Security Medal\n*  Alaska Recruiting Ribbon\n*  Alaska State Partnership Program Ribbon\n*   Alaska Cold War Victory Ribbon\n*  Alaska Territorial Guard Medal\n*  Alaska Governor's Distinguished Unit Citation\n*  Adjutant General's Marksmanship Proficiency Award (Badge)\n*  Governor's Twenty Award (Tab)\nArizona\nArizona National Guard State Awards:\n*  Arizona Medal of Valor\n*  Arizona Adjutant General's Medal\n*  Arizona Distinguished Service Medal\n*  Arizona Meritorious Service Medal\n*  Arizona Airman of the Year Ribbon\n*  Arizona Southwest Asia Service Support Ribbon\n*  Arizona Community Service Ribbon\n*  Arizona Exceptionally Long Service Medal\n*  Arizona Long Service Medal\n*  Arizona Service Ribbon\n*  Arizona State Active Duty Service Ribbon\n*  Arizona First Sergeant Ribbon\n*  Arizona Recruiting Ribbon\n*  Arizona Overseas Ribbon\n*  Arizona Military Academy Ribbon (OCS)\n*  Arizona Military Academy Ribbon (NCO)  (No longer awarded)\n*  Arizona Re-enlistment Ribbon  (No longer awarded)\n*  Arizona Initial Active Duty for Training Ribbon  (No longer awarded)\n*  Arizona Honor Attendance Ribbon  (No Longer Awarded)\nArkansas\nArkansas National Guard State Awards:\n*  Arkansas Medal of Honor\n*  Arkansas Military Medal\n*  Arkansas Distinguished Service Medal\n*  Arkansas Exceptional Service Medal\n*  Arkansas Commendation Medal\n*  Arkansas Federal Service Ribbon\n*  Arkansas Service Ribbon\n*  Arkansas Emergency Service Ribbon\n*  Arkansas Homeland Defense Ribbon\n*  Arkansas Recruiting Ribbon\n* Arkansas Military Funeral Honors Service Ribbon (Picture Unavailable)\nCalifornia\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20070625012242/http://www.calguard.ca.gov/casmr/awards2.htm California National Guard State Awards]:\n*  California Medal of Valor\n*  California Military Cross\n*  Order of California\n*  CA Legion of Merit.\n*  California Medal of Merit\n*  California Commendation Medal\n*  CA Achievement Medal\n*  California Good Conduct Medal\n*  California Service Medal\n*  California Enlisted Trainers Excellence Ribbon\n*  California Enlisted Excellence Ribbon\n*  California Recruiting Achievement Ribbon\n*  California National Guard Federal Service Ribbon\n*  California State Service Ribbon\n*  California Senior Enlisted Leadership Ribbon\n*  California Counterdrug Service Ribbon\n*  California Drill Attendance Ribbon\n*  California Memorial Medal\n*  California Governor's Outstanding Unit Citation\n*  California Commanding General's Meritorious Unit Citation\nColorado\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20060428110200/http://www.coloradoguard.army.mil/images/stateawards.jpg Colorado National Guard State Awards]:\n*  Colorado Meritorious Conduct Medal\n*  Colorado Meritorious Service Medal\n*  Colorado Soldier/Airman of the Year Award\n*  Colorado Commendation Ribbon\n*  Colorado Achievement Ribbon\n*  Colorado NCO Command Tour Ribbon\n*  Colorado Active Service Medal\n*  Colorado Long Service Medal\n*  Colorado TAG Outstanding Unit Citation\n*  Colorado State Emergency Service Ribbon\n*  Colorado State Foreign Deployment Service Ribbon\n*  Colorado State Mobilization Support Ribbon\n*  Colorado Recruiting Ribbon\nConnecticut\nConnecticut National Guard State Awards:\n*  Connecticut Medal of Valor -
