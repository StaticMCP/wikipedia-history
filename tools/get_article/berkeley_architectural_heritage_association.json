The organization is headquartered at the McCreary-Greer house, gifted to the association by Ruth Alice Greer in 1986.\nIn 2025, after developers applied to convert two smaller Berkeley buildings into large housing complexes, BAHA unsuccessfully tried to designate the two structures as landmarks. Housing developers said that the attempt caused costly delays to the construction process and that BAHA was attempting to prevent change.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.berkeleyheritage.com Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association website]\n* [https://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/landmarks.html BAHA's Berkeley Landmarks website]\n* [https://baha-news.blogspot.com BAHA News]"
