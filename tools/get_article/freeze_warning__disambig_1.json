This is used if the temperature is low enough to cause the most impact at that time of year.\nThe warning is used in the fall to mark the end of the growing season with the first episode of a widespread freeze. This is due to the temperature threshold that kills certain types of commercial crops and residential plants. However, if the temperature drops below  for a length of time it can kill most types of commercial crops and residential plants.The end of growing season occurs in mid to late October west of the Blue Ridge mountains and early November east of the mountains, but if the climate is warm the growing season may extend longer. Historically, these dates started earlier in September.\nAt the end of spring, another freeze warning is issued at the start of growing season if it is predicted to cause damage to new plants and crops.\nThe Benefit of Freeze Warnings\nHaving a freeze warning is not just used to protect plants from freezing. Many people stand to benefit by abiding and following the precautions placed in a freeze warning. Homeowners, renters, or people who work with water outside stand to benefit from paying attention to freeze warnings because pipes, garden houses, and other equipment that uses water can be damaged in temperatures below freezing. The water freezes and then expands, causing damage to your equipment. One way to tend to this is by storing the equipment in a dry place during the winter season or using insulated pipes and winterizing covers.\nA study shows that those who use predictive intervals, or warnings, took more precautionary action than those using deterministic forecasts. Some believe that weather warnings are pointless due to the capacity for the warning to be wrong, making them skeptical to using them. However, both groups, those using predictive intervals and deterministic forecasts, were able to understand the predictive interval verification graphics and use them to correctly identify the best performing forecast periods and achieving better results. By utilizing verification graphics, the National Weather Service is able to increase trust of the public.\nExample\n110\nWWUS74 KMOB 081005\nNPWMOB\nURGENT - WEATHER MESSAGE\nNational Weather Service Mobile AL\n405 AM CST Thu Mar 8 2018\n...FREEZING TEMPERATURES EXPECTED ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE\nAREA LATE TONIGHT INTO EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...\n.Temperatures are expected to drop to near or just below freezing\nacross portions of interior southeast Mississippi and interior\nsouthwest Alabama late tonight into early Friday morning.
