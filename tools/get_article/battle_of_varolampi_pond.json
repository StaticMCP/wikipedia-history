The Soviet soldiers stopped to eat the sausage soup that the retreating Finns had left behind in their field kitchen. This gave enough time for Major Pajari, who happened to be passing nearby at the time, to muster men from the 16th Infantry Regiment (JR 16) Headquarters Company, and Third Battalion supply elements, which included field cooks, clerks, supply and artillery NCOs, to launch a counter-attack, accompanied by the battle cry .\nFighting lasted well into the night and involved close quarters combat and one of the only cases of bayonet fighting during the Winter War. By dawn on 11 December the counter-attack succeeded in driving back the Soviet force and inflicted heavy casualties, with over 100 dead Soviet troops left on the field according to Finnish estimates, along with 20 dead on the Finnish side.\nSee also\n* List of Finnish military equipment of World War II\n* List of Soviet Union military equipment of World War II\nReferences"
