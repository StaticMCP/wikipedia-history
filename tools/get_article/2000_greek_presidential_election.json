The 19 MPs of the Communist Party of Greece and DIKKI voted \"present\", and two were absent. Stephanopoulos' re-election to the presidency marked the first time in the history of the Third Hellenic Republic that the ruling party and the main opposition party both supported the same candidate, as well as the first time that an incumbent President was re-elected..\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|Candidate\n!rowspan=2|Party\n!colspan=2|First round\n|-\n!Votes!!%\n|-\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|align=left|Konstantinos Stephanopoulos\n|align=left|Independent\n|269||96.41\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|align=left|Leonidas Kyrkos\n|align=left|Synaspismos\n|10||3.59\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=left|Valid votes\n|279||93.62\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=left|Abstentions\n|19||6.38\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=left|Voters\n|298||100\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=left|Absentees\n|2||0.66\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=left|Total\n|300||98.34\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
