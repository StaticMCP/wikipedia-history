Its name was chosen in honor of the Portuguese poet and writer Sophia de Mello Breyner Andersen and also because \"Sophia\" is a classic Greek name which means \"wisdom\" .\nHistory\nThe awards were instituted in 2012, a year after the creation of the Portuguese Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The president, Paulo Trancoso, said that the main idea was to create a form of recognizing and congratulate the excellence in cinema in the country having in mind other annual awards in Europe like the Goya Awards in Spain or the César Awards in France.\nThe first edition took place on November 26, 2012, at the Cinemateca Portuguesa, where three Career Awards were given to the film director and producer António da Cunha Teles, the filmmaker António de Macedo and the actress Isabel Ruth.\nList of ceremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Edition\n!Ceremony Date\n!Location\n!Host\n!Best Film\n!Broadcast\n|-\n|1st\n|November 26, 2012\n|Cinemateca Portuguesa\n|Paulo Trancoso and Anabela Teixeira\n|\n|Official Website\n|-\n|2nd\n|October 6, 2013\n|Teatro Nacional de São Carlos\n|José Pedro Vasconcelos\n|Tabu\n|RTP2\n|-\n|3rd\n|October 8, 2014\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Centro Cultural de Belém\n|Ana Sofia Martins\n|The Last Time I Saw Macao\n|Official Website\n|-\n|4th\n|April 2, 2015\n|Cláudia Semedo\n|''Cats Don't Have Vertigo\n| rowspan=\"8\" |RTP2\n|-\n|5th\n|May 13, 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ana Bola\n|Impossible Love\n|-\n|6th\n|March 22, 2017\n|Letters from War\n|-\n|7th\n|March 25, 2018\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Casino Estoril\n|Manuel Marques\n|Saint George\n|-\n|8th\n|March 24, 2019\n|Ana Bola\n|Rage\n|-\n|9th\n|September 17, 2020\n|Ana Bola and Joana Pais de Brito\n|The Domain\n|-\n|10th\n|September 19, 2021\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Margarida Vila-Nova and Pedro Miguel Ribeiro\n|Listen\n|-\n|11th\n|June 18, 2022\n|The Last Bath\n|-\n|12th\n|May 21, 2023\n|\n|\n|}\nCategories\nThe Sophia Awards are awarded in 22 categories, with a maximum of four candidates for each.\nAs of 2021:''\n* Best Film\n* Best Director\n* Best Original Screenplay\n* Best Actor\n* Best Actress\n* Best Supporting Actor\n* Best Supporting Actress\n* Best Documentary Feature\n* Best Cinematography\n* Best Editing\n* Best Sound\n* Best Original Score\n* Best Art Direction\n* Best Characterization/Special Effects\n* Best Costume Design\n* Best Makeup and Hairstyling\n* Best Series/Television film\n* Best Live Action Short Film\n* Best Documentary Short Film\n* Best Animated Short Film\n* Best Trailer\n* Best Poster\nThe following are also assigned:\n* Sophia Art and Technique Award\n* Sophia Career Award\n* Sophia Student Award\n**  The Sophia Student Award stands out as it gets awarded after a submission and selection phase.
