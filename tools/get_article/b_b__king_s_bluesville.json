It plays a mix of traditional blues, modern blues, rockin' blues and soul or \"finger-poppin blues.\nBill Wax was the original program director for the channel until his departure from SiriusXM in June 2013.  While playing music in the fictional town of Bluesville, Wax was often heard hanging out in Low-Fi's Bar and Pool Hall.  Tony Colter plays the role of a night-time bartender at Low-Fi's.\nB.B. King was the \"Mayor\" of Bluesville, having been dubbed as such by Bill Wax, and made several live appearances on the station. King, along with co-host Wax, had his own weekly music show on the channel that began in September 2008. The program featured a broad range of blues and gospel music hand-selected by King, along with stories about the artists and other personal anecdotes from the bluesman's epic career.  The show is no longer in production but continues to be re-run on the channel.\nThe channel launched on XM as Bluesville in 2001; King's name was officially added on July 14, 2008. At the time it had around 4 million listeners.\nOn November 12, 2008, it was added to the Sirius lineup, replacing SIRIUS Blues. B.B. King's Bluesville can be heard on channel 74 on Sirius XM Radio.\nBluesville's current program director is famed rock DJ Lou Brutus.\nIn September 2020, it was announced that the Blues Foundation would offer its archives and material for future broadcasts on B.B.
