The seat was abolished ahead of the 2008 state election as a result of the reduction in rural seats made necessary by the one vote one value reforms. Its former territory was largely absorbed by the seat of Blackwood-Stirling, with parts also added to Vasse. The following state election saw the changes essentially reversed, with the name Blackwood-Stirling reverting to Warren-Blackwood.\nMembers for Warren-Blackwood\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|Warren (1950–1996)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Ernest Hoar\n| Labor\n| 1950–1957\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Joseph Rowberry\n| Labor\n| 1958–1968\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| David Evans\n| Labor\n| 1968–1989\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Paul Omodei\n| Liberal\n| 1989–1996\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|Warren-Blackwood (1996–2008)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|rowspan=\"2\"| Paul Omodei\n| Liberal\n| 1996–2008\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Independent\n| 2008\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\"|Warren-Blackwood (2013–present)\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Terry Redman\n| National\n| 2013–2021\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Jane Kelsbie\n| Labor\n| 2021–2025\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n| Bevan Eatts\n| National\n| 2025–present\n|-\n|}\nElection results\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
