He guided thousands of people on their spiritual path through his spiritual discourses and books\nEarly life\nNageswara Rao was born to Sri Kanchupilla Kanakaiah and Srimathi Kasi Annapurna in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh on 20th January 1957. He was the third of five children. His father was a businessman. He lost his mother at the age of 12 years. As a child he was passionate about science and education and persevered to be the best in everything he took up. Despite being a class topper he could not continue his studies after 10th grade amidst financial difficulties that arose due to his father's business failures and ill health. To support his family, he had to join a small job. At the age of 17 years, he lost his father too.\nHe was married to Gouri Thulasi, his cousin's daughter in 1979. They had a daughter, Kasi Annapurna and a son, Kasi Viswanath. He worked for a few years before starting his own cloth agency business in 1980. With prior industry experience and natural talent, his business grew exponentially in just a few years.\nSpiritual life\nWhile going through several tough times financially and with relatives, Nageswara Rao used to constantly contemplate about God and why He was not answering his prayers. He studied 18 Puranas at the age of 20. Around the same time, he started to practice pranayama.\nIn January 1995, he was initiated into Vethathiri Maharishi's Simplified Kundalini Yoga (SKY). He soon became a Master and Assistant Perasiriyar in SKY in 1997. With his deep yearning for Divine, intense sadhana, blessings from prior life and Vethathiri Maharishi, he attained self realization in his late 30s. He was closely associated with Vethathiri Maharishi for 10 years until Maharshi left his body in 2006.\nUnder the auspicious instruction and guidance of Vethathiri Maharishi, Nageswara Rao established Siva Siddhi Kundalini Yoga Foundation  in 2008. He dedicated more than 25 years in spreading Vethathirian philosophy and meditation practices to spiritual seekers all across the Telugu states.\nHis close devotees saw him remain in 'samadhi' state for hours together. With his spiritual insights, he wrote advaita translation for Sri Lalitha Sahasranama Stotram and Bhagavad Gita. He provided elaborate discourses on several topics including the Divine Nature, karma siddhantam (cause and effect principle of Divine Nature, how to achieve success and peace in life and also attain the ultimate goal of human life (moksha or liberation from birth and death cycle). Realizing his high spiritual status, his devotees offered reverence by calling him \"Siddha Yogi Sri Nageswara Maharshi\".\nNageswara Maharshi said \"one must never renunciate family as an escape from problems in life, but should solve them through meditation\".
