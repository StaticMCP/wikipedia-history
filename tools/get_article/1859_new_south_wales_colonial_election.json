This election was for all of the 80 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 58 single-member constituencies, seven 2-member constituencies and two 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to adult white males. The previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 11 April 1859 by the Governor, Sir William Denison, on the advice of the Premier, Charles Cowper.\nThere was no recognisable party structure at this election; instead the government was determined by a loose, shifting factional system. Reporters from the Maitland Mercury recognised 22 members as being part of the government, while 17 members were part of the opposition. Other members were either not sitting, not recognised by the reporters, or a member of the crossbench.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Date\n!
