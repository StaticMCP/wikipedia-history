It contains the graves of 10,913 German servicemen from the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944 and the spring of 1945.  Of these, 5,599 were buried by the American war graves service during the war; American casualties were buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial about  away in Hamm.\nFollowing an agreement reached in 1952 between the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Federal Republic of Germany, 5,286 bodies were moved to Sandweiler from 150 different cemeteries throughout Luxembourg.  They had mostly lain in mass graves for which only incomplete records were available and the German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge) set about identifying as many as possible.  As a result, 4,014 of the 4,829 in the communal ''comrades' graves are now identified and listed.\nPlanning for the cemetery began in May 1952, and it was inaugurated on 5 June 1955, ten years after the end of the war.  The ceremonial opening took place in the presence of more than 2,000 relatives of the dead, whom the Volksbund'' had brought to Sandweiler in special trains.  With them came also delegations of schoolchildren from every German federal state.\nIn 2005, a special ceremony attended by civil and military representatives from Luxembourg and Germany as well as members of youth groups, took place to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the cemetery.\nThe last remains to be interred were those of an unknown German soldier discovered in the forests of Schumann's Eck near Wiltz in late 2007.\nFile:Sandweiler KSG 1631 pK.jpg|Entrance to the cemetery\nFile:Sandweiler KSG 1698 pK.jpg|Plaque on the mass grave\nFile:Sandweiler KSG 1706 pK.jpg|Anonymous crosses on the mass grave\nFile:Sandweiler KSG 1712 pK.jpg|Entrance area (from the memorial)\nFile:Sandweiler KSG 1726 pK.jpg|Group of fallen soldiers with triple inscriptions\nFile:Sandweiler KSG 1640 pK.jpg|New cross (installed after theft)\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070616032215/http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/bulgememorials.php#3 War cemeteries on the Luxembourg-German border]\n* [http://sandweiler.wordpress.com Webpage on the cemetery in German, with photos]\n*"
