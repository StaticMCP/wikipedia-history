Subsequently the workers, who had armed themselves, took over the cities of Benoni and Brakpan, and the Johannesburg suburbs of Fordsburg and Jeppe.\nThe young Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) took an active part in the uprising on grounds of class struggle whilst reportedly using racist language in its opposition to racial conflict during the strike, as did the syndicalists. The racist aspect was typified by banners with the slogan: \"Workers of the world, unite and fight for a white South Africa!\" By the time that general strike was declared on 6 March, Johannesburg's elites had given up on negotiations. Reports stated that \"Sabotage advocates\" were \"now apparently in control and had \"redoubled efforts towards violence.\" The next day, J.L. van Eyssen, a mining engineer involved in the negotiations was informed of a \"very great increase in attempted intimidation.\" Gangs of white workers were halting the delivery of bread, shutting down businesses, and stopping buses that were transporting strikebreakers to the mines. Armed white men began shooting at blacks on the street. That night, the rebels bombed a mine in Primrose with dynamite.\nBy 8 March, there were reports that \"greatly increased terrorism threatens most serious effect on position of mines.\" At this point, control over the rebellion had passed from workers to rural Boer commandos that had arrived in Johannesburg to bolster their cause, hoping to overthrow the government. Early that morning, one commando attacked a group of black workers, attacking them with their tools. Another commando attacked a mining compound in Primrose, killing four black workers and wounding another sixteen.\nWhen martial law was declared on the Witwatersrand on 10 March, amid further reports of the \"cold blooded murder of natives\", Johannesburg was under the threat of being overrun. Prime Minister Jan Smuts sent 20,000 troops, artillery, tanks, machine-guns, snipers, and bomber aircraft to crush the rebellion. By this time, the rebels had dug trenches across Fordsburg Square and the air force tried to bomb but missed and hit a local church. Near the end of the rebellion, a pogrom broke out against blacks by enraged rebels. Lieutenant Colonel Llewellyn Andersson's role in creating the Union Defence Force was instrumental in crushing the rebellion using \"considerable military firepower and at the cost of over 200 lives.  Several Communists and syndicalists, the latter including the strike leaders Percy Fisher and Harry Spendiff, were killed as the rebellion was quelled by the Union Defence Force.\nFrom 15 to 19 March 1922, South African troops cleared the areas of snipers and did house-to-house searches of premises belonging to the rebels. The rebellion was officially declared over on 18 March 1922. Before killing themselves, the two leaders of the strike, Percy Fisher and Harry Spendiff, left a note: \"We died for what we believed in - the Cause.\"\nAftermath\nSmuts' actions caused a political backlash, and in the 1924 elections his South African Party lost to a coalition of the National Party and Labour Party. They introduced the Industrial Conciliation Act 1924, Wage Act 1925 and Mines and Works Amendment Act 1926, which recognised white trade unions and reinforced the colour bar.  Under instruction from the Comintern, the CPSA reversed its attitude toward the white working class and adopted a new 'Native Republic' policy.\nAfter the strike, 18 strikers were sentenced to death for murder, of which 14 were reprieved. The four men to not be reprieved, were Carel Christian Stassen, Taffy Long, Herbert Hull, and David Lewis, were all executed by hanging at Pretoria Central Prison. Stassen was hanged on 5 October 1922, while the other three men were hanged together on 17 November 1922. He was convicted of killing two black men, John Setsuta and John McKenzie, in what witnesses said were racially motivated killings. Long was convicted of killing a police informant, while Hull and Lewis were convicted of killing a soldier. As they marched to the gallows, Long began singing the \"Red Flag\", the anthem of early socialists and communists in South Africa. He was joined in the song by the other two men. As they walked, all the prisoners sang with them.\nIn popular culture\nA TV series in 8 episodes produced by the SABC in 1984 and entitled 1922, tells this part of South African history.\nIn Agatha Christie's The Man in the Brown Suit, published in 1924, the Rand Rebellion is mentioned both by name and as a backdrop for the mystery. Christie washes over the specifics and uses the Rebellion as nothing more than a minor inconvenience for her characters.\nIn Wilbur Smith's A Sparrow Falls one of the principal characters becomes embroiled with some of the organisers of the Rand Rebellion in Fordsburg and fictionalised descriptions of some of the first skirmishes with the authorities are described.\nBibliography\n* Jeremy Krikler, Rand Revolt: The 1922 Insurrection and Racial Killings in South Africa, Jonathan Ball Publishers SA, 2006,\n* Wessel Pretorius Visser, ''A History of the South African Mine Workers' Union, 1902-2014'', Edwin Mellen Press, 2016,\nSee also\n* Maritz rebellion\n* Benjamin Jennings Caddy\n* Jacob van Deventer\n* Ernest Glanville\n* Cape Mounted Riflemen\n* Light Horse Regiment\n* South African Air Force\nReferences"
