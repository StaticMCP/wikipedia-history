Greenland's highest mountain range, the Watkins Range, as well as the nearly as high Schweizerland are located in this region.\nThe shore area of King Christian IX Land includes the Blosseville Coast to the east. There are many fjords, the largest of which are Sermilik, Kangerlussuaq and Kangertittivatsiaq, as well as numerous coastal islands, including Ammassalik which is the site of the most populous town in Eastern Greenland, Tasiilaq.\nOn the coast itself there are some small settlements, such as Sermiligaaq, but areas far from the coast are uninhabited.\nImage gallery\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n|.]]\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v260/n5553/abs/260694a0.html Caledonian magmatic activity in south-eastern Greenland]"
