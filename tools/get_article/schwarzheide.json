It is situated on the river Schwarze Elster, 11&nbsp;km southwest of Senftenberg, 110&nbsp;km south of Berlin and 40&nbsp;km north of Dresden. The little river Pössnitz runs through the eastern part of Schwarzheide.\nNeighbouring communities\nImmediate neighbors of the town are the towns Ruhland (south), Lauchhammer (west), Schipkau (north) and Senftenberg with the district Brieske (east).\nDistricts\nSchwarzheide has the following districts\n* Schwarzheide-West (former Zschornegosda)\n* Wandelhof\n* Schwarzheide-Mitte\n* Schwarzheide-Ost, consisting of Victoria and Naundorf\nHistory\nThe town's landmark is the watertower.  Today´s industrial town, Schwarzheide, was created on October 1, 1936, from the independent communities, Zschornegosda (today Schwarzheide-West) and Naundorf (now part of Schwarzheide-Ost). The name was translated from the Sorbian name, \"Zschornegosda\", (corny = black, gozd = heath, wood).\nThe date of foundation of this community is unknown. Zschornegosda and Naundorf were founded in the 12th or the 13th century after the Christianization of the Sorbs.\nThe first written evidence of Naundorf (as Nuwendorff) came from a pledge deed from 1421. Zschornegosda was first written in 1449 (as Cschörnegast) in feudal deed of Duke Frederick II, Elector of Saxony. Naundorf is a typical  street village. Zschornegosda is a rotunde called okolnica. The chapel was on the highest point of a sandy knoll.\nThe development of both villages was retarded by wars, fires, and epidemics. Until the 18th century, the villages had no more than 100 inhabitants.\nIn 1780, the discovery of lignite coal west of Zschornegosda in Bockwitz lead to mining and the foundation of briquette factories (Ferdinand, Victoria, Victoria II). The river, Schwarze Elster, was drained and converted to a canal, so it was no longer possible to live from fishing. Highway A13 was built in 1936.\n;World War II: In 1937, Brabag () completed the Brabag II facility in Ruhland-Schwarlheide (the 4th Nazi Germany Fischer-Tropsch plant) to produce gasoline and diesel fuel from lignite coal.  The plant was a target of the Oil Campaign of World War II, used Sachsenhausen concentration camp forced labor, and became a post-war Soviet Joint Stock Company.  The factory became VEB Synthesewerk Schwarzheide on January 1, 1954.\nWhen the village's population reached eight-thousand inhabitants, the village became a town on January 11, 1967.\nAfter 1990, Synthesewerk Schwarzheide became a part of BASF AG, which manufactures polyurethane.\nPolitical affinity\nThe river, Schwarze Elster, forms the border between lower and upper Lusatia.\nFrom 1635, both Zschornegosda and Naundorf were part of the Electorate of Saxony. In 1815 both villages came to Prussia because of the Congress of Vienna. From 1815 to 1947, they were part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg.\nBetween 1818 and 1952, Zschornegosda and Naundorf were part of Kreis Calau.\nFrom 1952 to 1990, Schwarzheide was a part of Kreis Senftenberg in the Bezirk Cottbus of East Germany.\nIn 1990, town was annexed to Brandenburg, and, on December 6, 1993, to Oberspreewald-Lausitz.\nParliament\nThe town parliament of Schwarzheide comprises the mayor and 18 members.\n*Christian Democratic Union 5 seats (27.3%)\n*Freie Wählergruppe Schwarzheide 4 seats (22.3%)\n*Social Democratic Party 3 seats (18.2%)\n*The Left 3 seats (17.0%)\n*Free Democratic Party 3 seats (15.2%)\nThe turnout stood at 56,9 percent.\nPartnerships\n* Krosno Odrzańskie (Poland)\n* Karcag (Hungary)\n* Piano di Sorrento (Italy)\nDemography\nFile:Bevölkerungsentwicklung Schwarzheide.pdf|Development of Population since 1875 within the Current Boundaries (Blue Line: Population; Dotted Line: Comparison to Population Development of Brandenburg state; Grey Background: Time of Nazi rule; Red Background: Time of Communist rule)\nFile:Bevölkerungsprognosen Schwarzheide.pdf|Recent Population Development and Projections (Population Development before Census 2011 (blue line); Recent Population Development according to the Census in Germany in 2011 (blue bordered line); Official projections for 2005-2030 (yellow line); for 2017-2030 (scarlet line); for 2020-2030 (green line)\nCulture and art\n]]\nSymbol is the 36&nbsp;m high water tower built in 1943/44 by French prisoners of war.
