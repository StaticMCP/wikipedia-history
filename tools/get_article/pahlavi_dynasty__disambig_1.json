It was founded in 1925 by Reza Shah Pahlavi, a non-aristocratic Iranian soldier of Mazanderani origin, who took on the name of the Pahlavi scripts of the Middle Persian language from the Sasanian Empire of pre-Islamic Iran. The dynasty largely espoused this form of Iranian nationalism rooted in the pre-Islamic era (notably based on the Achaemenid Empire) during its time in power, especially under its last king Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\nThe dynasty replaced the Qajar dynasty in 1925 after the 1921 coup d'état, beginning on 14 January 1921 when 42-year-old soldier Reza Khan was promoted by British General Edmund Ironside to lead the British-run Persian Cossack Brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan's 3,000–4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran. The rest of the country was taken by 1923, and by October 1925 the Majlis agreed to depose and formally exile Ahmad Shah Qajar. The Majlis declared Reza Pahlavi as the Shah of Iran on 12 December 1925, pursuant to the Persian Constitution of 1906. Initially, Pahlavi had planned to declare the country a republic, as his contemporary Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had done in Turkey, but he abandoned the idea in the face of British and clerical opposition.\nThe dynasty ruled Iran for 28 years as a form of constitutional monarchy from 1925 until 1953, and following the overthrow of the elected prime minister, for a further 26 years as a more autocratic monarchy until the dynasty was overthrown in 1979.\nFamily background\nIn 1878, Reza Khan was born at the village of Alasht in Savadkuh County, Mazandaran Province. His parents were Abbas Ali Khan and Noushafarin Ayromlou. His mother was a Muslim immigrant from Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire) whose family had emigrated to mainland Qajar Iran after Iran was forced to cede all of its territories in the Caucasus following the Russo-Persian Wars several decades prior to Reza's birth. His father was a Mazandarani, commissioned in the 7th Savadkuh Regiment, and served in the Anglo-Persian War in 1856.\nHeads of the House of Pahlavi\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Number!!

This made all half-brothers of Mohammad Reza ineligible to become heirs to the throne. Until his death in 1954, the Shah's only full brother Ali Reza was his heir presumptive. The constitution also required the Shah to be of Iranian descent, meaning that his father and mother are Iranian.\nLine of succession in February 1979\n*  Reza Shah Pahlavi (1878–1944)\n** Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (1919–1980)\n***(1) Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi (b. 1960)\n*** (2) Prince Ali-Reza Pahlavi (1966)\n** Prince Ali-Reza Pahlavi (1922–1954)\n*** (3) Prince Patrick Ali Pahlavi (b. 1947)\n**** (4) Prince Davoud Pahlavi (b. 1972)\n**** (5) Prince Houd Pahlavi (b. 1973)\n**** (6) Prince Mohammad Pahlavi (b. 1976)\nCurrent line of succession\n*  Reza Shah Pahlavi (1878–1944)\n**  Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (1919–1980)\n***Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi (b. 1960)\n*** Prince Ali-Reza Pahlavi (1966–2011)\n** Prince Ali-Reza Pahlavi (1922–1954)\n*** (1) Prince Patrick Ali Pahlavi (b. 1947)\n**** (2) Prince Davoud Pahlavi (b. 1972)\n**** (3) Prince Houd Pahlavi (b. 1973)\n***** (4) Prince Rafaël Pahlavi (b. 2006)\n**** (5) Prince Mohammad Pahlavi (b. 1976)\nList of crown princes\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=2| Name !!
