Eight episodes were broadcast live from August 11 to September 29, 2013. Guests featured on the show included cast and crew members from Breaking Bad, celebrity fans, and members from a live audience.\nBroadcast and format\nFollowing the success of Talking Dead, which serves as a companion to The Walking Dead franchise, AMC created similar after-shows to accompany other original programming on the network; the first of these was Talking Bad. The series premiered on August 11, 2013, following the encore presentation of the midseason premiere of Breaking Bad's fifth season. Episodes continued airing following new episodes of Breaking Bad. Talking Bad concluded its run on September 29, 2013, with an extended one-hour episode directly following the series finale.\nThe series features host Chris Hardwick discussing the latest episode with guests who are fans of the series, including the cast and crew from Breaking Bad. On hosting the show, Hardwick commented: Breaking Bad will go down as one of the best shows in television history. Obviously, it's tonally much different than The Walking Dead, and I will strive to give Breaking Bad the send-off it deserves. I am honored to be able to give fans a peek behind the curtain for the last eight episodes so we can all say goodbye to it together. AMC will tell you that it's because of the success of Talking Dead or my friendship with the BB cast that they asked me to host this, but I maintain it probably has more to do with my unmistakable resemblance to Jesse Pinkman, BITCH.\nThe show uses a logo and theme music similar to Talking Dead. Episodes aired at 11:00 pm eastern time, and ran at 30 minutes (including commercials), with an online bonus segment following each televised episode. The final episode ran at 60 minutes, at 10:15 pm eastern following the final episode of Breaking Bad. Segments on Talking Bad include \"Respect the Chemistry,\" a \"periodic table character study\", a \"fix\" from executive producer/creator Vince Gilligan for the following episode, an online poll, and episode trivia. Questions were also taken from fans via phone, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, or from the official Talking Bad website.\nEpisodes\n|Viewers = 1.19\n|ShortSummary = \"Superfan\" Julie Bowen from Modern Family discusses her ideas and theories on the show and the evolution of the characters with show creator Vince Gilligan and host Chris Hardwick.\n|LineColor = 213D30\n}}\n|Viewers = 1.03\n|ShortSummary = Bill Hader was supposed to be a guest alongside Anna Gunn in this episode, but dropped out when Aaron Paul became available.
