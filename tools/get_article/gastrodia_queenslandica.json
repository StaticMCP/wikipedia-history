It has one or two small, yellowish brown, tube-shaped flowers on a thin, brittle flowering stem and grows in rainforest in tropical north Queensland, Australia.\nDescription\nGastrodia queenslandica is a leafless terrestrial, mycotrophic herb that has a thin, fleshy, brittle, light brown flowering stem bearing one or two yellowish brown, tube-shaped flowers that are orange-coloured inside. The sepals and petals are joined, forming a tube about  long with spreading tips. The tube is rough on the outside and orange-coloured and smooth inside. The labellum is about  long,  wide and completely enclosed in the tube. Flowering occurs from November to January.\nTaxonomy and naming\nGastrodia queenslandica was first formally described in 1964 by Alick William Dockrill who published the description in The North Queensland Naturalist.  In 2004, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Demorchis queenslandica but the change has not been accepted by Plants of the World Online.\nDistribution and habitat\nRainforest bells grows in near coastal rainforest between the Russell River and the McIlwraith Range but is rarely seen.\nConservation\nThis orchid is classed as \"near threatened\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992.\nReferences"
