The subterranean structure lies buried at a depth of ~4&nbsp;km, and measures a minimum of 200&nbsp;km in diameter.  For comparison, the Chicxulub crater, which caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, is about 180&nbsp;km in diameter. The East Warburton crater is adjacent to the West Warburton crater, which is also around 200&nbsp;km in diameter. Combined, they make up the largest known impact zone on Earth, but individually, are smaller than the largest in the world, the 300&nbsp;km wide Vredefort impact structure in South Africa. The Warburton craters formed when an asteroid or comet, on a collision course with Earth, split into two main pieces and impacted the Australian continent, then part of the Gondwanan supercontinent.\nScientists proposed the impact formation through analysis of shocked quartz grains from the area after a circular anomaly appeared in seismic tomography studies of the region.\nSee also\n* Cooper Basin\n* List of possible impact structures on Earth\nReferences"
