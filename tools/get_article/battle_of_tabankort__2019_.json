The jihadists rode on seven vehicles, several motorcycles, and two tuk-tuks stolen from a local medical center, and posed as vaccination staff members to conduct the attack.\nOnce the jihadists' disguises were exposed, a battle ensued between ISGS and the Malian troops. Around one hundred fifty Malian soldiers fought, with thirteen vehicles. They were forced to pull back, and the group of 850 Nigerien soldiers began a combing operation in the Tabankort valley, bringing back the bodies of slain Malian soldiers.\nAftermath\nISGS claimed responsibility for the attack on November 20. They also claimed that 30 Malian soldiers were killed, and thirty more were injured.\nThe Malian army claimed on November 18 that the death toll was 24 soldiers killed and 29 injured, while seventeen jihadists were killed and over a hundred apprehended. An AFP source then claimed the next day that the Malian death toll was over thirty killed. The bodies of the 30 soldiers killed were interred during a military ceremony in Gao on November 20. However, the bodies of thirteen other soldiers were discovered on November 21, bringing the death toll to 43 killed.\nReferences"
