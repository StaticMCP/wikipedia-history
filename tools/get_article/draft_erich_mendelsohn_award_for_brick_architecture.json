V.”. The prize is supported by the Bund Deutscher Architektinnen und Architekten (BDA) and various architectural media. Since 2008, the Award for Brick Architecture has been awarded by an independent jury to projects that use the potential of the traditional building material to create contemporary and timeless buildings. In recent years, more than 600 submissions from over 30 countries have been recorded for the prize, which is awarded every three years.\nNamesake\nThe Award for Brick Architecture has been called Erich Mendelsohn Award for Brick Architecture since October 2022. Ehemaliger Fritz Höger Preis hat neuen Namen erhalten |url=https://www.dbz.de/news/erich-mendelsohn-preis-fuer-backstein-architektur_3868826.html |website=DBZ}} Previously, the prize was created and became known as the Fritz Höger Prize for Brick Architecture. The name change was instigated after a study by historian Thomas Großbölting, which was initiated by the Initiative Bauen mit Backstein, and confirmed that the former namesake Fritz Höger clearly held nationalist, ethnic and racist views during the Nazi era. Eine politisch-professionelle Biografie |url=https://erich-mendelsohn-preis.com/sites/default/files/uploads/presse/pm2022/Fritz-Hoeger_Gutachten_Thomas_Grossboelting.pdf}} The award is now named after and dedicated to the German architect Erich Mendelsohn. Mendelsohn was an important architect of the 20th century and one of the most important representatives of “dynamic modernism” in Germany. The choice of Erich Mendelsohn emphasizes the “innovative and international claim” of the award. Mendelsohn's work is characterized by his openness to technology, his formal language and his progressive ideas on urban planning. In particular, his visionary use of brick, but also his openness to experimenting and combining with other materials, distinguish Mendelsohn for the naming of the award.\nOverview\nDue to the high number of entries, the Erich Mendelsohn Award for Brick Architecture is now one of the largest German architecture prizes.\nThe prize is awarded to buildings that make sustainable use of the architectural potential of the traditional building material brick and whose realization combines economic, ecological and design aspects. The aim of the competition is to help both architects and the product brick to gain new publicity. Brick is understood as a generic term for façade bricks fired from clay, which are also known as clinker bricks. The prize is awarded every three years by the Initiative Bauen mit Backstein – Zweischalige Wand Marketing e. V. and is endowed with 10,000 euros. The competition took place in 2008, 2011, 2014, 2017 and 2020 under the previous name Fritz Höger Award for Brick Architecture. On January 9, 2023, the sixth round of the newly named competition officially began under the name Erich Mendelsohn Award 2023 for Brick Architecture.\nA new system was introduced with the 2014 award ceremony, which since then has provided for the following awards: Grand Prix, Gold, Silver as well as Special Mention and Nominee.\nParticipation\nThe competition is open to architects and communities from the fields of architecture and engineering who are the intellectual authors of the submitted buildings. Submissions must meet the following requirements: Erich-Mendelsohn-Preis |url=https://erich-mendelsohn-preis.com/de/teilnahmebedingungen |website=erich-mendelsohn-preis.com}}\n# Construction method: Buildings with a concept or construction whose essential feature is the use of brick are eligible for submission.
