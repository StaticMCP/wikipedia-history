Sullivan Award, presented by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), is awarded annually to \"the most outstanding athlete at the collegiate or Olympic level in the United States\".\nThe award was established in 1930 in honor of the organization's founder and past president, James Edward Sullivan. Based on the qualities of leadership, character, and sportsmanship, the AAU Sullivan Award \"goes far beyond athletic accomplishments and honors those who have shown strong moral character\".  Finalists are selected from public nominations following a review by the AAU Sullivan Award Executive Committee.  Approximately 10 semi-finalists are chosen, and the eventual winner is determined by votes from various members of the nationwide news media, former winners and AAU personnel. More recently, a portion of the winner's vote has been determined by the general public.  Recipients are eligible for subsequent awards, and in 2023, Caitlin Clark became the first repeat winner. In 1999, 2015, 2019, and 2020, the award was shared between two co-recipients.\nThe inaugural winner of the award was golfer Bobby Jones, winner of 13 majors between 1923 and 1930.  The first female recipient, in 1944, was swimmer Ann Curtis, who won more national AAU championships than any other woman. 34 track and field athletes have won the AAU Sullivan Award—the most by any sport.\nFile:BobbyJonesAge14.jpg|Golfer Bobby Jones won the inaugural award in 1930.|alt=A young man in a white shirt, dark tie and dark pants completing a right-handed golf swing\nFile:Wilma Rudolph.jpg|Wilma Rudolph received the accolade in 1961. |alt=A woman in a T-shirt and shorts, crossing the finish line of a race in first place, ahead of a competitor\nFile:Carl Lewis as a University of Houston athlete.jpg|Track athlete Carl Lewis received the award in 1981.|alt=A man midway through a long jump leap.
