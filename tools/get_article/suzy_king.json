She is best known for her dance routines which involved snakes.\nBiography\nSampaio started her career in 1939, in São Paulo, Brazil, as Diva Rios, singing sambas and marches.\nLater on she changed her name to Suzy King and started her iconic act of performing with pythons.\nSampaio had her peak during the 1950s when public fakirism was most popular. She was a multi-media star of sorts when such a term did not exist yet, always making sure newspapers would keep abreast of what she was doing.\nSampaio wrote a play that was banned by the authorities. She also tried to emulate Lady Godiva wearing a long blond wig to cover her breasts and riding a horse through the center of the city. She was almost gang-raped by a mob and was saved by a passerby.\nShe left for Mexico in the late 1960s, where she changed her name to Yacui Yapura Sampaio Bailey. She married an American in 1970 and moved to the United States.\nSampaio died alone in her trailer in California in 1985.\nSampaio is featured in the book, Cravo na Carne: Fama e Fome, by Alberto de Oliveira and Alberto Camarero.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szUecmonF9s Suzy King sings \"Não tenho inveja\"] (video)"
