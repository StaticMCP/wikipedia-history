      "text": "# Woodworking machine\n\nA Woodworking machine is a machine that is intended to process wood. These machines are usually powered by electric motors and are used extensively in woodworking. Sometimes grinding machines (used for grinding down to smaller pieces) are also considered a part of woodworking machinery.\nTypes of woodworking machinery\nArtisanal and hobby machines\nin school workshop]]\nin a school workshop.]]\nThese machines are used both in small-scale commercial production of timber products and by hobbyists. Most of these machines may be used on solid timber and on composite products. Machines can be divided into the bigger stationary machines where the machine remains stationary while the material is moved over the machine, and hand-held power tools, where the tool is moved over the material.\nHand-held power tools\n* Biscuit joiner\n* Domino jointer\n* Chain saw\n* Hand-held circular saw\n* Electric drill\n* Jig saw\n* Miter saw\n* Nail gun\n* Hand-held electric plane\n* Reciprocating saw\n* Rotary tool\n* Router\n* Hand-held sanders, including belt sander, orbital sander, random orbit sander\nStationary machines\n* Bandsaw\n* Combination machine\n* Double side planer\n* Four sided planer or timber sizer\n* Drill press\n* Drum sander\n* Bench grinder\n* Jointer\n* Wood lathe\n* Mortiser\n* Panel saw\n* Pin router or Overhead Router\n* Radial arm saw\n* Scroll saw\n* Spindle moulder (Wood shaper)\n* Stationary sanders, including stroke sanders, oscillating spindle sander, belt sander, disc sander (and combination disc-belt sander).\n* Table saw\n* Tenoner or tenoning machine\n* Thicknesser or Thickness planer\n* Round pole milling machine\n* Round pole sanding machine\nPanel Line Woodworking machines\nThese machines are used in large-scale manufacturing of cabinets and other wooden or panel products.\nPanel surface processing\nPanel dividing equipment\nPanel dividing equipment, classified by number of beam, loading system, saw carriage speed\nDouble end tenoner\nDouble end tenoner, classified by conveyor type\n* Rolling chain system conveyor speed 40 to 120 m/min\n* Sliding chain system conveyor speed 10 to 30 m/min\nPanel edge processing equipment\nPanel edge processing equipment, classified by conveyor speed\n* High speed edgebander conveyor speed >= 100 m/min\n* Heavy duty edgebander conveyor speed >= 24 m/min\n* Light duty edgebander conveyor speed < 20 m/min (i.e. 8, 12 or 16 m/min)\nPanel boring equipment\nclassified by number of boring heads\n* Single line boring machine\n* Multi line boring machine\nPanel automatic packing equipment\nSee also\n* List of production topics\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
