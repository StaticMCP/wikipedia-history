He then built Kundeshwar Temple at that location.\nAccording to the ethics, Banpur was the capital of Banasur, the king of demons and a great devotee of the Lord Siva Mahadev, her daughter Usha Devi was also a devotee of Shiv Linga of Mahadev. Usha Devi was married to Anirudha, the grandson of Lord Krishna and son of Pradumna.\nBagwar Suryawanshi, a Bira Kshatriya was Baghwa - Lion rider in Madhya Desh called Baghroha from Banpur to the dense forest of Jamdhar river long back before Samvat 1201(1144 A.D.) as engraved footnote found below the idol of Nandi Mahadev.\nGaharwar Raja Govindachandra moved his capital from Kannauj to Varansi (1114-1154).

Amongst 13 sons of Punja Kamdhuj, Muktaman, who conquered possession in the north from Bhan Tuar, his descendants called Bira Kamdhuj came to occupy territory of Madhya Desh - Bundelkhand.\nRaja Vir Singh Deo (r. 1605-1627), a ruler of strong principles; he was not only a warrior but an enthusiastic builder, leaving many monuments, forts and temples; he patronised the building up of the temple and awarded with the title of Panda or Pandya of Kundeshwar Mahadev to Bagwar clan with copper plate Rajagya owing to their Rajput ancestry.\nRaja Mahendra Vikramajit 1776/1817 and Maharaja Mahendra Sawai Pratap Singh Ju Deo 1874/1930 and their successors continued to patronise until merger of the State into the Indian Republic and registration of Shree Aashutosh Aparna Dharmsetu Lok Nyas, Kundeshwar on 22 February 1980.\nTo the south is Usha Waterfall.
