The show has a book by Harvey Fierstein and songs by Cyndi Lauper.  Kinky Boots is based on the 2005 British film of the same name, which was, in turn, inspired by a true story.\nThe original production was directed and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell and orchestrated by Stephen Oremus.  Scenic design was by David Rockwell, costumes by Gregg Barnes, lighting by Kenneth Posner and sound by John Shivers.  The cast starred Billy Porter as Lola and Stark Sands as Charlie and featured Annaleigh Ashford as Lauren.\nEarly in the 2013 awards season, Kinky Boots did well, receiving Drama League Award nominations for Distinguished Production of a Musical and Distinguished Performance, for both Porter and Sands, and winning for Distinguished Production. The show received nine Outer Critics Circle Award nominations, winning three, including Outstanding New Broadway Musical, Outstanding New Score and Outstanding Actor in a Musical (Porter). The musical received only two Drama Desk Award nominations, however, and only one win: Porter for Outstanding Actor in a Musical.\nKinky Boots received a season-high 13 Tony Award nominations. Matilda, which The New York Times described as the \"unalloyed critical hit\" of the season, received 12 nominations, 11 of them in the same categories as Kinky Boots. In addition to its critical success, Matilda had won the Drama Desk Award for outstanding musical and had set a record by winning the most Olivier Awards in history. Nevertheless, Kinky Boots won a season-high six Tonys, including Best Musical, which the press described as an upset, and Lauper's win for Best Score made her the first woman to win alone in that category. The creative team are Americans, and reviewer David Cote, an American writing in The Guardian, judged that the show's win was a case of \"the balance of love going to a homegrown American musical, Kinky Boots, over the British import Matilda.\" Kinky Boots also won the 2013 Artios Award for Outstanding Achievement in Casting in the Broadway musical category.\nKinky Boots won the award for Best Musical Theater Album at the Grammy Awards in January 2014.\nAwards and nominations\nOriginal Broadway production\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"18%\"| Award\n! width=\"37%\"| Category\n! width=\"30%\"| Nominee\n! width=\"10%\"| Result\n|-\n|rowspan=\"31\" align=\"center\"|  2013\n|rowspan=\"3\" |Drama League Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Distinguished Production of a Musical\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\" | Distinguished Performance\n| Billy Porter\n|\n|-\n| Stark Sands\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\" |Outer Critics Circle Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Outstanding New Broadway Musical\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Book of a Musical (Broadway or Off-Broadway)\n| Harvey Fierstein\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding New Score (Broadway or Off-Broadway)\n| Cyndi Lauper\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Director of a Musical\n|rowspan=\"2\" | Jerry Mitchell\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Choreographer\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Costume Design (Play or Musical)\n| Gregg Barnes\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Actor in a Musical\n| Billy Porter\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical\n| Daniel Stewart Sherman\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical\n| Annaleigh Ashford\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Drama Desk Award\n| Outstanding Actor in a Musical\n| Billy Porter\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical\n| Annaleigh Ashford\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"13\" |Tony Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n|\n|-\n| Best Book of a Musical\n| Harvey Fierstein\n|\n|-\n| Best Original Score\n| Cyndi Lauper\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Best Actor in a Musical\n| Billy Porter\n|\n|-\n| Stark Sands\n|\n|-\n| Best Featured Actress in a Musical\n| Annaleigh Ashford\n|\n|-\n| Best Scenic Design of a Musical\n| David Rockwell\n|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design of a Musical\n| Gregg Barnes\n|\n|-\n| Best Lighting Design of a Musical\n| Kenneth Posner\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound Design of a Musical\n| John Shivers\n|\n|-\n| Best Direction of a Musical\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Jerry Mitchell\n|\n|-\n| Best Choreography\n|\n|-\n| Best Orchestrations\n| Stephen Oremus\n|\n|-\n|Artios Award\n| Outstanding Achievement in Casting\n| Bernard Telsey & Justin Huff\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Astaire Awards\n| Outstanding Choreographer in a Broadway Show\n| Jerry Mitchell\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Outstanding Male Dancer in a Broadway Show\n| Billy Porter\n|\n|-\n| Charlie Sutton\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| Grammy Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical Theater Album\n|\n|}\nOriginal West End Production\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Award\n! style=\"width:35%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2015\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Evening Standard Awards\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n|\n|-\n| Best Musical Performance\n| Killian Donnelly\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\"|2017\n| rowspan=\"7\"|Laurence Olivier Award\n| colspan=\"2\"|Best New Musical\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|Best Actor in a Musical\n| Killian Donnelly\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Matt Henry\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical\n| Amy Lennox\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Best Theatre Choreographer\n| Jerry Mitchell\n|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Best Costume Design\n| Gregg Barnes\n|\n|-\n| Outstanding Achievement in Music\n| Cyndi Lauper & Stephen Oremus\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\"|2017\n| Grammy Award\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical Theater Album\n|\n|}\nOriginal Australian production\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Year\n! style=\"width:20%;\" | Award\n! style=\"width:35%;\" | Category\n! style=\"width:25%;\" | Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |2017\n| rowspan=\"7\" |Helpmann Awards\n| colspan=\"2\" | Best Musical\n|\n|-\n|Best Music Direction\n|Luke Hunter\n|\n|-\n|Best Choreography in a Musical\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Jerry Mitchell\n|\n|-\n|Best Direction of a Musical\n|\n|-\n|Best Female Actor in a Musical\n|Sophie Wright\n|\n|-\n|Best Female Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical\n|Teegan Wouters\n|\n|-\n|Best Male Actor in a Musical\n|Callum Francis\n|\n|}\nNotes\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*  ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120826020926/http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/13982/Kinky-Boots archive])\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130512062209/http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/news/articles/2013-03-22/201303231364001129565.html Kinky Boots] at Tony Awards.com"
