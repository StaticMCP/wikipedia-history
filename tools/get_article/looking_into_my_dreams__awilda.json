It stood in Millennium Park from June 2014 until January 2016. As of March 2017, Awilda stands at the Pérez Art Museum Miami. It is composed of resin and marble dust, with a metal support structure and an internal frame of fiberglass.\nAwilda is based on a real person, a Dominican girl who came to Spain with her mother, who Plensa knew in Barcelona. Plensa took her portrait with a laser scanner, capturing 3D information to manipulate and scale into larger models.\nSee also\n* List of public art in Chicago\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://jaumeplensa.com/works-and-projects/public-space/looking-into-my-dreams-awilda-2016 Jaume Plensa, LOOKING INTO MY DREAMS, AWILDA, 2016]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKPDh6QRVCY Jaume Plensa - Looking into my Dreams (Awilda) OIR 2012 English Subtitles]"
