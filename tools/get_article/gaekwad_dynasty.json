The ruling prince was known as the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda. With the city of Baroda (Vadodara) as its capital, during the British Raj its relations with the British were managed by the Baroda Residency. It was one of the largest and wealthiest princely states of British India, with its wealth coming from the lucrative cotton business as well as rice, wheat and sugar production.\nof the Gaekwad dynasty.]]\nEarly history\nThe Gaekwad rule of Baroda began when the Maratha general Pilaji Rao Gaekwad conquered the city from the Mughal Empire in 1721. The Gaekwads were granted the city as a Jagir by Chhatrapati Shahu I, the head of state of the Maratha Confederacy.\nIn their early years, the Gaekwads served as subordinates of the Dabhade family, who were the Maratha chiefs of Gujarat and holders of the senapati (commander-in-chief) title. When Umabai Dabhade joined Tarabai's side against Balaji Baji Rao, Pilaji's son Damaji Rao Gaekwad commanded the Dabhade force. He was defeated, and remained in Peshwa's custody from May 1751 to March 1752. In 1752, he was released after agreeing to abandon the Dabhades and accept the Peshwa's suzerainty. In return, Damaji was made the Maratha chief of Gujarat, and the Peshwa helped him expel the Mughals from Gujarat.\nDamaji subsequently fought alongside Sadashiv Rao, Vishwas Rao, Malhar Rao Holkar, Jankoji Scindia, Sidhoji Gharge-Desai (Deshmukh) and Mahadji Shinde in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761). After the Maratha defeat at Panipat, the central rule of the Peshwas was weakened. As a result, the Gaekwads, along with several other powerful Maratha clans, established themselves as virtually independent rulers, while recognizing the nominal authority of the Peshwas and suzerainty of the Bhonsle Maharaja of Satara.\nBritish suzerainty\nThe Gaekwads, together with several Maratha chieftains, fought the British in the First Anglo-Maratha War.\nOn 15 March 1802, the British intervened to defend the Gaekwad Maharaja, Anand Rao Gaekwad, who had recently inherited the throne against rival claimants, and the Gaekwads concluded the Treaty of Cambey with the British that recognized their independence from the Maratha Confederacy and guaranteed the Maharajas of Baroda local autonomy in return for recognizing British suzerainty, though it was a result of an inability to overpower them.\nMaharaja Sayaji Rao III, who took the throne in 1875, did much to modernize Baroda, establishing compulsory primary education, a library system and the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. He also encouraged the setting up of textile factories, which helped create Baroda's textile industry. He is known for offering B. R. Ambedkar a scholarship to study at Columbia University.\nUpon India attaining its independence in 1947, the last ruling Maharaja of Baroda, Pratapsinhrao, acceded to India. Baroda was eventually merged with Bombay State, which was later divided, based on linguistic principle, into the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra in 1960.\nGaekwad or Gayakwad also survives as a fairly common Maratha surname, found mainly in the Indian state of Maharashtra.\nGaikwad Maharajas of Baroda\n* Nandaji Rao Gaikwad, died May 1721\n** Kerojirao\n*** Jhingojirao\n**** Pilaji Rao Gaikwad, reigned from 1721, died 14 May 1732\n*****15px I.
