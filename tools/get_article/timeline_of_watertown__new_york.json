The area had seen human occupation since at least the second glacial period, but significant change into what is now known as Watertown did not occur until the beginning of the Machine Age. The city, which was incorporated in 1869, had expanded primarily through trade with Canada. The city destroyed many factories and historical buildings in the 1960s, which began a steady decline in population, from 33,306 in 1960 to 24,685 in 2020, a loss of 26%.\nPrehistory\n* 12,000 BP: Ice from the pleistocene period recedes, leaving the area underwater for ≈ 1,000 years.\n* 11,000 BP: Land emerges from underwater.\n* Glacial Period: Native Americans follow Caribou into the area and settle.\n18th century\n* 1791: Area bought by Alexander Macomb.\n* 1796: Area scouted by Benjamin Wright.\n19th century\n* March 1800: Houses first built by Pioneers.\n* 1801: A Church is built.\n* 1802\n** School Built.\n** Hydropower using the fast moving water of the Black River begins.\n* 1804: The Postal Station is built.\n* 1805: The Public Square is allowed to be used by the public.\n* 1816\n** Watertown Incorporated as a Village.\n** First Bank opened.\n** Local Fire Department begins.\n* 1842: Rome, Watertown and Ogdensburg Railroad built.\n* 1847: First Portable steam engine to be made in the United States made in Watertown.\n* 1849\n** Safety pin is invented by Walter Hunt of Watertown..
