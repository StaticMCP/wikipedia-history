It helped stop pirates, make the seas safer, and help on military campaigns. That is what happened when Persia and Greece were in a big war fighting over land and resources. At the time, Persia was under the rule of King Xerxes I. There was many battles leading up to the fall of Athens, where the Persian army burned and destroyed Athens. Now, most Greek forces fled to Peloponnesus to run away from the strong Persian army. The Greeks still had the Athenian navy because they fled with all the other Greek armies. A man named Themistocles was an Athenian general and naval strategist, was smart, and ambitious. He was born around 524 BCE in Athens. Themistocles lived in the middle class so he was well  educated. He helped build the massive Athenian army. He convinced the Greeks to make a stand at sea near the island of Salamis (Just off the coast of Athens).\nThe Persians were coming in fast at the Greek navy, and the Greeks were outnumbered. The Greeks had around 380 ships, but some city-states helped the Athenian navy, Corinth, Aegina, Megara, Sparta, and many more. While the Persians had 600 to 1,200 ships. Now, like I said, Themistocles was brilliant, so he devised a plan to lure the Persian navy into the narrow straits of Salamis. By sending a fake message to Xerxes, pretending to be a traitor, saying the Greeks were trying to flee away from the Persians. Xerxes took the bait and ordered his fleet to trap the Greeks. This was a very brilliant plan! The large Persian fleet came into the tight space. The Athenian triremes charged forward, ramming into the Persian ships. The tight space made the Persian ships collide and made the Persian ships easy targets. The Persian fleet suffered a big loss, 300 ships sank or were captured. When the battle was going, Xerxes was watching his fleet lose the battle from land. Xerxes then from his throne on a hillside, withdrew much of his army back to Persian soil.\nAfter the battle, the Greeks had lots of pride because they defeated the largest and most powerful empire in the world. It also showed how strong Athens was when it came to their navy’s power, and the people who rowed the ships were praised. And, of course, Themistocles was receiving the most praise, especially from the Athenians. The Greeks were also feeling relief and good survival skills because Athens was burned to the ground. With that survival, a lot of Athenians retreated to Salamis before the battle and they just survived. Lastly, after winning the big battle, Greece was safe for now and was able to rebuild all their homes. It helped the Greek army’s feel that they had total power, which helped all the Greeks form an alliance. The Greeks also felt freedom and self-rule.\nAfter the win, it was a turning point for the Persian Wars. The Athenians felt that after this battle, they were strong enough to defeat the Persians. The rowers in the triremes were mostly poor citizens, but when the Athenians won, they had a good political influence after the battle. Also after the battle, Athenian democracy became much stronger, because naval victories relied on all social classes. Athens soon led the Delian League, turning into an empire that brought wealth and power all to Greece. Tributes from the league members helped fund public works for infrastructure and arts. With the navy Athens had, they were able to control trade routes, ports and colonization opportunities. That really helped when they had to move people and to help them making the colonies for those people.\nThe Persians could not supply or protect the army because they no longer had naval support. The Greek city states noticed the Athenian power and respected them. The battle did help get tribute from allies because they won the battle basically by themselves. Athens was praised because they led to victory with the win at the battle of Salamis. Athenians were able to rebuild Athens after the war (Persia burned the city). In Athens, the Athenians built the famous statue Parthenon.\nAfter the battle, the Greeks beat the Persians well, and Athens became a big city because of their navy. Which led to peace and calmness over Greece for a while, just because the Athenian navy won the battle of Salamis in 480 BCE.\nNow people can see that the battle of Salamis helped the Greeks in many ways, showing how strong the Athenian navy is, culture, and get stronger relationships with allies. The Persians had no chance in winning because of the Salamis strait which made the big Persian army all tight in one long strait, so the Greeks won the battle easily by destroying the Persians fleet. By then, making king Xerxes scared to fight another battle against the Athenian navy.\nReferences\nWasson, Donald L. Battle of Salamis.
