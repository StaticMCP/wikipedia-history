However, from the style of its construction, it was probably built between the 10th and 12th centuries.\nFirishta mentions the locality of the temple as a site where a battle between a Hindu and Muslim kingdom took place. The temple fell into the hands of the Muslim kingdom, however, they made no changes to the structure except for the construction of a parapet wall on the roof. The Muslims would utilize the roof for their prayers, while the lower portion remained in possession of the Hindus. The temple was known as the Khanqah temple, or Khanqah Deval, during this period.\nDescription\nThe temple is located in the middle of a tank. The tank, square in shape, has a pavement running along its sides. The temple is to be approached by a causeway which leads to a flight of steps, leading to the temple building.\nThe building is star-shaped, with elaborate carvings of Hindu gods and goddesses arranged in niches.\nThe roof is domical-shaped, and is supported by 24 pillars.\nReferences"
