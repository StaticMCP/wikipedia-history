These protected sites date from the Neolithic period in some cases and include barrows, a medieval hospital, ancient Roman sites, castle ruins, Iron Age forts, bridges and Anglo-Saxon crosses.\nIn the United Kingdom, the scheduling of monuments was first initiated to ensure the preservation of \"nationally important\" archaeological sites or historic buildings. Protection is given to scheduled monuments under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.\nNotable scheduled monuments in County Durham\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Image\n!
