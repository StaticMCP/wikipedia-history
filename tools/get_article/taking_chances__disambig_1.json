Dion returned to the music scene after almost five years of performing A New Day... on the Las Vegas Strip. She collaborated on Taking Chances with various rock and pop producers, including John Shanks, Linda Perry, ex-Evanescence members Ben Moody and David Hodges, Kristian Lundin, Ne-Yo, Chuck Harmony, Tricky Stewart, Eurythmics' David A. Stewart, Kara DioGuardi, Emanuel Kiriakou, Anders Bagge, Peer Åström, Aldo Nova, Christopher Neil and Guy Roche.\nTaking Chances sold 3.1 million copies worldwide in 2007 alone and peaked inside the top ten in various countries, including number one in Canada, Switzerland, South Africa and on the European Top 100 Albums. It has sold 1.1 million units in the United States and was certified platinum by the RIAA. In Canada, after shipping over 400,000 copies, the album was certified four-times platinum. The first single, \"Taking Chances\", was released in September 2007 and peaked inside the top ten in various European countries and in Canada. In 2008, different songs were selected as the second single for different regions: \"Eyes on Me\" in the United Kingdom, \"A World to Believe In\" in Japan and \"Alone\" in North America. The latter was also released as the third and final single in the United Kingdom. On 14 February 2008, Dion embarked on the year-long Taking Chances World Tour, which visited five continents and became one of the highest-grossing tours of all time.\nBackground\nOn 24 August 2007, Dion's official website announced that the singer will release her new English-language album Taking Chances on 12 November 2007 in Europe and 13 November 2007 in North America. The album was also scheduled for release in Japan on 7 November 2007 and in Australia and New Zealand on 10 November 2007. Dion said about Taking Chances: \"I think it represents a positive evolution in my career. I'm feeling strong, maybe a little gutsier than in the past, and just as passionate about music and life as I ever was\". On 2 September 2007, album's cover became available for TeamCeline members. However, six days later, Columbia Records has made small changes to the Taking Chances cover. The first single form the album, \"Taking Chances\" was sent to radio stations on 10 September 2007 and the video of Dion recording the song in the studio was posted on Amazon.com. On 12 September 2007, Columbia Records informed in a press release that \"Taking Chances\" was written by Kara DioGuardi and Eurythmics' David A. Stewart, and produced by the Grammy Award–winner John Shanks, and that the album will be followed by the Taking Chances World Tour in 2008 and 2009. The music video for the first single was filmed on 17 September 2007 in several different locations in the Las Vegas area and directed by Paul Boyd. The video became available for TeamCeline members on 16 October 2007 and later premiered on television.\nContent\nThe album was recorded mainly over a three-week period in July 2007 at Palm Studios in Las Vegas. Dion collaborated with a group of well-known songwriters and producers including: Linda Perry, Eurythmics' David A. Stewart, ex-Evanescence member Ben Moody, Ne-Yo, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Kristian Lundin, Anders Bagge, Peer Åström, Aldo Nova, Tricky Stewart and Christopher Neil. One of Dion's favorite songs on the album is \"That's Just the Woman in Me\" written by Kimberley Rew, ex-member of Katrina and the Waves. \"That's Just the Woman in Me\" was offered to Dion fifteen years ago but it wasn't until she began working on her new album that she knew the song perfectly suited this new phase of her artistic development. Dion said: \"I think this album represents a positive evolution in my career. As time goes by, and we have more experiences in life, it's easier to get in touch with our innermost feelings....to know more about what we really want, how we really feel\". Other covers on the album include: Heart's \"Alone\", Platinum Weird's \"Taking Chances\", Linda Perry's \"New Dawn\" and Tim Christensen's \"Right Next to the Right One\".\nPromotion\n\" during her Taking Chances Tour stop in Montréal in August 2008.]]\nin May 2009.]]\nDion visited the United Kingdom in late October 2007 and started promoting the album by singing \"Taking Chances\" on The X Factor on 27 October 2007.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received a weighted average score of 53 based on 8 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic rated it 3 stars and said that Taking Chances is \"an album of its time: it offers extravagance in the guise of self-help, which can be alluring in doses, especially those bizarre blues-rockers, but it's just too much of a very expensive yet not particularly tasteful thing. The Billboard review said that: \"Packing an emotional wallop, Chances should quash critics who insist that Dion's voice is stainless steel\". Bill Lamb of About.com rate the album three-stars out of five, and said: \"listening to 16 consecutive songs can be an endurance test for even the most ardent Celine fan. 14 of the songs here suffer, to various degrees, from leaning to the ordinary or seeming to lack in inspired artistic fire. However, they are sandwiched by 2 brilliant tracks that, sadly, give a hint of what Taking Chances might have been\". Sarah Rodhman from The Boston Globe commented that: \"Are chances taken? Not many, but there are rewards if you're willing to enjoy Dion's precise vocalizing and the hooky songs\".\nThe Entertainment Weekly review saw that: \"It's cool that Dion can mimic everyone from Shakira to Sam Phillips...but her appalling Janis Joplin impression is a Chance too far\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine opined that: \"The laborious 16-track record purportedly finds the queen of adult contemporary-turned-Vegas attraction taking chances by modernizing her treacly power ballad sound with lots of overdubbed guitars and of-the-moment collaborators\". The Amazon.com review was positive, saying that: \"As far as standard Celine fare goes, in fact, Chances is likely her strongest non-French outing since 2002's A New Day Has Come; nobody unfolds a lyric with more care or nuance\". The NOW review, expressed that: \"The album is also comfortably ignorant of the times. With its feathery production and common pop arrangements, it could have come out in 1996\". Edna Gundersen from USA Today said that: \"With Chances, the diva seems to be stretching artistic muscles, yoga-style not aerobically, and seeking an escape from expectations\". Ashante Infantry from Toronto Star concluded that: \"Taking Chances, Dion's 10th album, finds her doing just that. With an obvious reach for contemporary radio, Dion padded the efforts of longtime collaborators with in-the-now hitmakers: Ne-Yo, Linda Perry and Ben Moody, who co-wrote the self-empowering anthem \"This Time\" about an abused woman breaking free. The result is an edgier rock sound that won't alienate loyal fans, but may engage some new ones\".\nCommercial performance\nTwo months before its official release worldwide, Taking Chances was among the most pre-ordered albums on Amazon. According to IFPI, Taking Chances was the 8th best-selling album by a female artist of 2007 worldwide, with sales of over 3.1 million copies in 2007 alone.\nCanada\nIn Canada, Taking Chances entered the chart at number one with 80,000 copies sold, surpassing Dion's own record for the biggest debut of 2007 (her French-language album ''D'elles sold 72,000 units in its first week in May 2007). Garnering two of the highest sales entries in Canada for two different albums in one year gave Dion an unprecedented achievement in Canadian Nielsen SoundScan history. In the second week, Taking Chances remained at the top of the chart, selling 44,000 copies. The next week, Dion fell to number two and stayed on this position for four consecutive weeks selling 39,000, 45,000, 37,000 and 43,000 units, respectively. Dion returned to the top of the chart for the final week of 2007, selling another 13,000 copies. Because of this commercial success, Taking Chances became the third best-selling album in Canada in 2007 according to Nielsen SoundScan, with sales of 301,000 units. The album spent two more weeks inside the top ten in Canada. In July 2008, it was certified four-times platinum by the CRIA for shipping over 400,000 copies. It also became the number-one album on the 2008 Billboard year-end chart in Canada.\nUnited States\nIn the United States, Taking Chances debuted at number three, selling 215,000 units. Later, it fell to number eight and remained at that position for two weeks with sales of 128,000 and 93,000 copies, respectively. For the next four weeks, the album stayed inside the top twenty on the Billboard 200, selling 84,000 (number twelve), 92,000 (number fifteen), 134,000 (number eighteen) and 50,000 units (number twenty), respectively. Taking Chances was certified platinum by the RIAA in February 2008 and has sold 1.1 million copies in the US as of May 2010.\nOther markets\nThe album also reached number one in Switzerland, South Africa and on the European Top 100 Albums, and peaked inside the top ten in various other countries. It was certified gold in many countries, and platinum or multi-platinum in others. According to the IFPI, Taking Chances'' sold 3.1 million copies around the world in 2007 alone.\nAccolades\nIn 2008, Dion won World Music Award for World's Best Selling Canadian Artist of the Year.
