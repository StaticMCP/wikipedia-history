They are a part of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) and play in the Interior Conference.\nThe West Kelowna Warriors are a relocated franchise, moving to West Kelowna in 2006 from Langley, British Columbia.\nHistory\nLangley Thunder/Hornets\nLangley was originally granted a British Columbia Junior Hockey League (BCJHL) franchise in 1973 called the Langley Lords. The team played as the Lords through the 1975–76 season. In those three years they had very decent regular seasons, making it to the playoffs each year, including a loss in the league finals in their first season. In 1976 the Lords changed their name to the Langley Thunder. Their regular season performance diminished each year and they missed the playoffs for the first time in the franchise's history in the 1978–79 season. Shortly after the completion of the 1978–79 season, the franchise ceased operations. An unrelated BCJHL franchise, the Chilliwack Colts, relocated to become the Langley Eagles from 1981–82 through the 1986–87 seasons, before moving back to Chilliwack, British Columbia.\nLangley Hornets Logo In 1990, the BCJHL was renamed the BCHL, and in 1994 Langley returned to the BCHL with a new franchise, adopting the name Thunder from the defunct franchise of the 1970s. The new franchise competed as the Thunder for five seasons, reaching the BCHL championship finals in 1996, which they lost to the eventual Junior A national Royal Bank Cup champion Vernon Vipers, 4–1.\nThe Thunder changed their name to the Langley Hornets before the start of the 1998–99 season. Playing in Langley from 1998 through the 2005–06 season, the Hornets were led by several coaches. Coach Rick Lanz was notable for taking the last place 2001–02 team and guiding them to a fourth-place finish in the 2002–03 season, though the team would be eliminated in the first round of the BCHL playoffs. Lanz was not re-signed for the next season and the team returned to last place in the BCHL.\nWestside/West Kelowna Warriors\nWestside Warriors Logo\nBefore the start of the 2006–07 season the franchise moved from Langley to the unincorporated area on the \"westside\" of Kelowna, British Columbia, and renamed themselves the Westside Warriors. The Westside Warriors found immediate success, reaching the BCHL playoffs in the 2006–07 season, followed in 2007–08 with a third place BCHL finish in the regular season and making it to the BCHL semi-finals in the playoffs.\nIn late 2007, the unincorporated area the Westside Warriors called home became the incorporated Westside District Municipality, and in 2008 changed its name to West Kelowna.  The franchise kept the place name Westside, rather than West Kelowna, through the 2011–12 season. In the summer of 2012, the Westside Warriors announced they would be changing their name to the West Kelowna Warriors, recognizing the proper name of the municipality where they play.\nIn 2018, the Warriors were purchased by Kim Dobranski and KD Sports Ltd. from Mark Cheyne and the Vision Sports Group LLP.\nIn October 2019, the BCHL confirmed that it was in talks to buy the West Kelowna Warriors from owners Kim Dobranski and Linda Wang, with unaudited financial results that showed the team profited just over $10,000, the first time the team was ever profitable since moving to West Kelowna. In November 2019, the Warriors were purchased by John Murphy and Rod Hume under JMRH Hockey Development ULC, with Murphy serving as governor and Hume as managing partner, and the BCHL approving the sale and the sale effective date being November 11, 2019. The Warriors also announced that Chris Laurie was named team president.\nSeason-by-season records\nNote: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against, Pts = Points\nBCJHL Langley Lords/Thunder\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
