The centre of the locality is relatively low-lying at  or less.\nThe east and south-east of the locality are within the Walter Hill Range Conservation Park.

It exits to the north (El Arish). The locality was served by the now-abandoned Maadi railway station ().\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from a former railway station, named on 31 August 1922 by the Queensland Railways Department. The name is probably a corruption of the Palestinian place Maadan, a significant base area on the strategic railway built into the Sinai Peninsula in World War I, known to the Australian Light Horse units. Alternatively, the name may originate from Maadi (sometimes spelt Meadi), on the then edge of the desert south of Cairo, where Maadi (Meadi) Camp accommodated AIF Light Horse brigades when staying in Egypt during World War I.\nDemographics\nIn the , Maadi had a population of 44 people.\nIn the , Maadi had a population of 49 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Maadi.
