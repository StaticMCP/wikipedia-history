      "text": "# Willie Has Gone to War__disambig_1\n\n\"Willie Has Gone To War\" is a song written by Stephen Collins Foster sometime in 1862. It was considered a 'Civil War Song', though it was not as popular as some of his previous work. George Cooper wrote the lyrics. He may have composed up to 285 songs, hymns, arrangements and instrumental works during his lifetime. He also created many of the lyrics.\nLyrics\nThe bluebird is singing his lay,\nTo all the sweet flow'rs of the dale,\nThe wild bee is reaming at play,\nAnd soft is the sigh of the gale;\nI stray by the brookside alone,\nWhere oft we have wander'd before,\nAnd weep for my lov'd one, my own,\nMy Willie has gone to the war!\nChorus:\nWillie has gone to the war,\n''Willie, Willie my lov'd one my own;\nWillie has gone to the war,\nWillie, Willie my lov'd one is gone''!\n'Twas here, where the lily bells grow,\nI last saw his noble young face,\nAnd now while he's gone to the foe,\nOh! dearly I love the old place;\nThe whispering waters repeat\nThe name that I love o'er and o'er,\nAnd daisies that nod at my feet,\nSay Willie has gone to the war!\nChorus:\nThe leaves of the forest will fade,\nThe roses will wither and die,\nBut spring to our home in the glade\nOn fairy like pinions will fly;\nAnd still I will hopefully wait\nThe day when these battles are o'er,\nAnd pine like a bird for its mate,\nTill Willie comes home from the war!\nChorus:\nOther Foster \"Willie...\" songs\nFoster wrote other \"Willie\" songs. Both his father and his half-brother were named William Barclay Foster.\n* \"Willie My Brave\", (1851) words and music by Foster.\n* \"Willie's Gone to Heaven\", (1863) words and music by Foster.\nReferences"
