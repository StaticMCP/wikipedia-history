She had a crew of 27, plus nine DEMS gunners.\nEmpire Elgar arrived at Middlesbrough, Yorkshire on 18 April 1942. After loading a cargo of war materiel, she made her maiden voyage on 2 May, joining Convoy FN 697, which had departed from Southend, Essex that day and arrived at Methil, Fife on 4 May. She then joined Convoy EN 81, which departed on 6 May and arrived at Oban, Argyllshire on 9 May. She left the convoy at Loch Ewe on 8 May, joining Convoy UR 23, which departed that day and arrived at Reykjavík, Iceland on 12 May. Empire Elgar was a member of Convoy PQ 16, which departed on 21 May. On 24 May, the convoy was spotted by a Blohm & Voss Ha 139 reconnaissance aircraft. The convoy was to remain under aerial surveillance for the next six days. On 25 May, an attempt was made to bomb the convoy, but no hits were scored. This was followed by a second attack, also unsuccessful. When a third attack was mounted that evening, the CAM ship  launched her Hawker Sea Hurricane, but the pilot was wounded whilst attacking five Junkers Ju 88s, of which one was shot down and another damaged. The pilot bailed out and his aircraft crashed into the sea. DEMS gunners on Empire Elgar damaged two aircraft, with one probably destroyed. The attacks continued into the next day. On reaching the entrance to the White Sea, progress was slowed by ice. Two icebreakers were required to clear a passage. PQ16 arrived at Murmansk, Soviet Union on 30 May.
