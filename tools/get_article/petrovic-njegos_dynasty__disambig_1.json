Bogut was alive at the time of the Battle of Velbazhd (1330) and the building of Visoki Dečani, and perhaps into the 1340s. According to tradition, and recorded by some historians, the ancestors of the Petrović family settled in Muževice at the end of the 14th century, from the Bosnia region, from the area of Zenica or Travnik. It is possible that Bogut at that time had moved to Drobnjaci with his son, Đurađ Bogutović.  Đurađ or some of his sons were in the entourage of Marko Drago, an affluent Serbian nobleman who had served Serbian lord Vuk Branković (1345-1397), and as such they are believed to have also served the Branković family. Đurađ and his five sons \"from Drobnjaci\" are mentioned in a document dating March 1, 1399, in which they gave several items to the depository of Dapko Vasilijev, an affluent Kotoran nobleman.\nRule of Montenegro\nMontenegro was ruled from its inception by vladikas (prince-bishops) since 1516, who had a dual temporal and spiritual role, subordinate to the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć until its dissolution in 1766. In 1697, the office was made hereditary in the Petrović-Njegoš family. However, since Orthodox bishops are required to be celibate, the crown passed from uncle to nephew. In 1852, Prince-Bishop Danilo II opted to marry and to secularize Montenegro, becoming Prince Danilo I. His successor, Nikola I, raised Montenegro to a kingdom in 1910.\nIn 1916, King Nikola I was ousted by the invasion and occupation of his country by Austria-Hungary, during World War I. He was formally deposed by the Podgorica Assembly in 1918 and the country merged with Kingdom of Serbia and shortly thereafter merged again with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.\nAfter Yugoslavia\nA period of eighty years of control from Belgrade followed, during which time Nikola I died in exile in France in 1921, followed shortly afterwards by the surprise abdication of his son and heir, Danilo III, the same year. The latter's nephew, Michael Petrović-Njegoš, inherited the titles of his predecessors whilst in exile in France. After a titular 11-year \"reign\" under the regency of one of his grandfather's generals, Anto Gvozdenović, Michael gave up his claim to the throne and swore allegiance to Yugoslavia. He survived arrest and internment by order of Adolf Hitler for refusing to head up a puppet Montenegrin state aligned to the Axis powers. Later, he served the SFR Yugoslavia as Head of Protocol. He was succeeded by his son Nicholas Petrović-Njegoš in 1986. In 2006, Montenegro went on to achieve full sovereignty in the 2006 independence referendum.\nIn 2011, Montenegro recognized an official role for the Royal House of Petrović-Njegoš in Montenegro: to promote Montenegrin identity, culture and traditions through cultural, humanitarian and other non-political activities, which has been interpreted as a \"creeping restoration\" of the monarchy.\nThe present head of the house is Nicholas, Crown Prince of Montenegro.\nModern role\nIn July 2011, the Parliament of Montenegro adopted the Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty.The law allows descendants of the dynasty to use heraldic royal symbols and grants them land that belonged to the King. It grants them property and buildings in Njegusi and Cetinje, the former capital city, as well as an apartment in Podgorica. It established the Petrovic-Njegos Foundation, which would receive financing from Montenegro’s state budget amounting to some €4 million.\nList of monarchs\n{|style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:8%;\"  | Picture\n! style=\"width:12%;\" | TitleName\n! style=\"width:15%;\" | Birth\n! style=\"width:12%;\" | Reign\n! style=\"width:13%;\" | Marriage(s)Issue\n! style=\"width:15%;\" | Death\n! style=\"width:15%;\" | Claim\n! style=\"width:10%;\" | Notes\n|-\n| || Prince-BishopDanilo I || 1670Njeguši, Montenegro || 1697 11 January 1735() || — || 11 January 1735Podmaine Monastery, Venice(aged 80) || Elected by the Montenegrin Tribal Assembly ||\n|-\n| || Prince-BishopSava II || 18 January 1702Njeguši, Montenegro || 11 January 1735 9 March 1781() || — || 9 March 1781Podmaine Monastery, Venice(aged 80) || First cousin of Danilo I || Coruled with Basil III from 1750–1766.\n|-style=\"background:#F5F5DC;\"\n| || Prince-BishopBasil III || 1709Njeguši, Montenegro || 175010 March 1766() || — || 10 March 1766St. Petersburg, Russian Empire(aged 56–57) || Nephew of Danilo I || Co-ruled with Sava II\n|-\n|colspan=8|Out of power for .\n|-\n| || Prince-BishopPetar I || 1748Njeguši, Montenegro || 13 October 178430 October 1830() || — || 30 October 1830Cetinje, Montenegro(aged 81–82) || Elected by the Sinod.
