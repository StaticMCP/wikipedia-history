The battle took place on 24 September 1907 and resulted in a Saudi victory.\nBackground\nAfter the execution of Abalkhail's cousin, Emir of Qassim, Abalkhail planned to take revenge from his king, Ibn Saud. Abalkhail re-allied again with the Rashidis, the traditional enemies of Ibn Saud. Abalkhail also made an alliance with Faisal Al-Duwaish, leader of the Mutayr clan and the Ikhwan forces, who used to aid Ibn Saud forces in his former battles. Ibn Saud met the allied forces in the battle of Tarafiyah.\nReferences\n* Battle of Tarafiyah, Arabic Wikipedia"
