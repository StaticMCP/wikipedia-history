Since October 21, 2019, the chairman of the Council has been Valery Fadeyev.\nThe Council was created in 2004 by reorganizing the Commission on human rights, which existed since November 1993.\nThe Council currently consists of 47 people, including political scientist Sergey Karaganov, filmmaker Alexander Sokurov, journalist Kirill Vyshinsky and entrepreneur Igor Ashmanov.\nIn previous years, the Council has included retired judge of the Constitutional Court of Russia Tamara Morshchakova, political scientist Ekaterina Schulmann, lawyer Pavel Chikov, journalist Nikolai Svanidze and economist Yevgeny Yasin.\nChairmen\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"|Chair\n!

The original version of the statement, posted on the Council's website, did not condemn Podrabinek's frank statements towards WWII veterans. However, the statement was later edited (according to some sources, after a call from a high-ranking official to Ella Pamfilova) and included remarks that the Council did not agree with Podrabinek's position. Valery Fadeyev, future chairman of the council, described its behavior within Podrabinek controversy as strange and unnatural.\n}}\nJournalist Maksim Shevchenko, who was a member of the Council in 2012–18, described its activities as follows:\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
