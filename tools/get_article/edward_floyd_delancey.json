His grandfather was a brother to James De Lancey and a grandson of Stephen Delancey, a French Huguenot who became a successful New York merchant and married Anne Van Cortlandt, the third child of Gertrude Schuyler and Stephanus van Cortlandt, the Chief Justice of the Province of New York.  Through his great-grandmother, Anne (née Heathcote) DeLancey, he was also a direct descendant of Caleb Heathcote, the 31st Mayor of New York City.  His paternal aunt, Susan Augusta DeLancey, was married to the prominent author James Fenimore Cooper.\nAs a youth, he traveled on an extensive European tour for fourteen months with his father.  DeLancey received his early education from the Rev. John Eustace and Samuel Wylie Crawford of Philadelphia.
