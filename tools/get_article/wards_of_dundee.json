      "text": "# Wards of Dundee\n\nDundee City Council controls Dundee City council area, which is one of Scotland's 32 council areas. The council area is divided into eight wards, used to elect members to the council to provide local government services to the council area.\nThe boundaries for all Scottish council areas and their sub divisional wards are regulated and regularly reviewed by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland. The current ones were created in 2007 after the 29 existing single member wards were merged into 8 multi-member wards. Each of the eight wards in Dundee elects 3 or 4 councillors every five years in the Scottish local council elections. The most recent elections were held in 2022.\nSummary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Ward number\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Ward name\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Seats\n! colspan=\"4\" |2022 result\n|-\n!SNP\n!Lab\n!LD\n!Con\n|-\n|1\n|Strathmartine\n|4\n| style=\"background:;\" |2\n|1\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|2\n|Lochee\n|4\n| style=\"background:;\" |2 [3]*\n|2 [1]*\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|3\n|West End\n|4\n|2\n|0\n| style=\"background:;\" |2\n|0\n|-\n|4\n|Coldside\n|4\n| style=\"background:;\" |2\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|5\n|Maryfield\n|3\n| style=\"background:;\" |2\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|6\n|North East\n|3\n| style=\"background:;\" |2\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|7\n|East End\n|3\n| style=\"background:;\" |2\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|8\n|The Ferry\n|4\n|1\n|1\n| style=\"background:;\" |1\n|1\n|-\n!\n!Total\n!29\n!15 [16]*\n!9 [8]*\n!4\n!1\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |\nfollowing by-elections.}}\n|}\nStrathmartine\nIn the 2007 election, Helen Dick, Stewart Hunter, Kevin Keenan and Ian Borthwick were all elected.
