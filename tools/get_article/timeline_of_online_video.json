Time period\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Key developments in online video\n|-\n| 1974–1992\n| Development of practical video coding standards. The development of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) lossy compression method leads to the first practical video formats, H.261 and MPEG, initially used for online video conferencing.\n|-\n| 1993–2004\n| Early days of the World Wide Web. Several container formats for streaming the first videos are released. Some sites, like Newgrounds, heavily rely on these container formats to display online video. Due to quality issues caused by low bandwidth and bad latency, very little streaming video existed on the World Wide Web until 2002 when VHS quality video with reliable lip sync became possible.\n|-\n| 2005–2010\n| Mass-streaming services like YouTube and Netflix become massively popular for streaming online video. Broadband penetration increases, allowing significant fractions of the population to stream online video. Macromedia Flash is the most popular format for displaying online video, as it is used by YouTube and many other sites.\n|-\n| 2011–2016\n| HTML5 starts to displace Flash. Live streaming becomes increasingly popular, especially in the form of services like Twitch. Many social media startups integrate the streaming of short segments of video, like Vine and Keek. These are, in turn, integrated into the most popular services like Instagram and Facebook.\n|}\nFull timeline\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n! Year\n! Month and date\n! Event type\n! Details\n|-\n| 1993\n| May 22\n| Technology\n| Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees, originally released in 1991, is the first film to be streamed on the Internet.
