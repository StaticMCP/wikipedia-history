A professional competitor since 1997, he also competed for PRIDE, the WEC, Strikeforce, Bellator, EliteXC, King of the Cage, BodogFIGHT, the MFC, and HDNet Fights. For a period of time (2004), Edwards was ranked as the #1 Lightweight in the world.\nBackground\nEdwards was born on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas and moved to Texas when he was 14 years old. Edwards began training in traditional Karate in his youth, moving on to Kung Fu and Ninjutsu before eventually taking up mixed martial arts. This also led him to Muay Thai in order to improve his stand-up. Like many aspiring martial artists, Edwards cites Hong Kong cinema as a formative influence. He has been quoted as saying \"I've always liked the old Hong Kong flicks, and I was a big comic book fan: you know the superheroes, they were always big in my mind. Anything that will make me physically better than the average person, and teach me to do things that the average person can't do, I was game for it.\"\nBased in Houston since his teens, Edwards says he learned some grappling on a trip back home to the Bahamas at the age of 17, although \"it wasn't as technical as it should have been, but it was better than not getting anything.\" He is a well-rounded fighter, with a strong boxing background, having also trained with Lewis Wood, a #6 WBA Featherweight Boxer. This is in addition to his experience in Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, of which he says \"I've never worn a gi 'cause I've always been competing\".\nMixed martial arts career\nEarly career\nEdwards made his professional mixed martial arts debut in 1997 and compiled a record of 18-5-1 before being signed by the UFC.\nUltimate Fighting Championship and World Extreme Cagefighting\nEdwards made his UFC debut at UFC 33 against Matt Serra and was defeated via unanimous decision. He would then go 6–1 in his next seven appearances under the Zuffa banner.\nAt UFC 49, Edwards knocked out Josh Thomson by way of a spectacular flying head-kick. Due to the fact that the lightweight division had no current champion at the time, Edwards was regarded as \"The Uncrowned Lightweight Champion of the UFC.\"\nPost-UFC\nAfter two wins in the EliteXC promotion, Edwards lost to EliteXC Lightweight Champion K. J. Noons via KO in the first round in June 2008, and lost a unanimous decision to Duane Ludwig at Strikeforce: Destruction.\nHe rebounded with a submission victory against James Warfield in September 2009, and next defeated Kyle Jensen by way of TKO in the first round. Yves followed up that victory the following February with an impressive quick TKO of fellow UFC veteran Derrick Noble.\nReturn to the UFC\nEdwards returned to the UFC against John Gunderson on September 15, 2010, at UFC Fight Night 22, replacing Efrain Escudero who was promoted to the main card. Edwards won the fight via unanimous decision.\nEdwards was expected to face Melvin Guillard on January 22, 2011, at UFC Fight Night 23, but Guillard was promoted to the main event against Evan Dunham after Kenny Florian was forced off the card with an injury. Edwards then faced replacement Cody McKenzie on the card, and won via rear naked choke in the second round earning Fight of the Night and Submission of the Night honors.\nEdwards fought Sam Stout on June 11, 2011, at UFC 131 and was knocked out by an overhand left at 3:52 of the first round.\nEdwards defeated Rafaello Oliveira via second-round TKO on October 1, 2011, at UFC on Versus 6.\nEdwards faced Tony Ferguson on December 3, 2011, at The Ultimate Fighter 14 Finale. Edwards lost the fight via unanimous decision in a back and forth fight.\nEdwards was expected to face Donald Cerrone at UFC on Fuel TV: The Korean Zombie vs. Poirier on May 15, 2012. However, Edwards was forced from the bout with an injury and replaced by Jeremy Stephens.\nEdwards was expected to face Jeremy Stephens on October 5, 2012, at UFC on FX 5. However, the bout was cancelled due to Stephens being arrested on the day of the event for an assault charge that dated back to 2011. The fight eventually took place on December 8, 2012, at UFC on Fox 5. Edwards won by knockout in the first round, being the first fighter to ever stop Stephens via strikes.\nEdwards faced promotional newcomer Isaac Vallie-Flagg on February 2, 2013, at UFC 156. He lost the fight via split decision.\nEdwards was expected to face Spencer Fisher on July 27, 2013, at UFC on Fox 8. However, on July 11, Fisher was removed from the bout due to injury and replaced by Daron Cruickshank. He lost a split decision.\nEdwards made his nineteenth UFC appearance when he took on Yancy Medeiros at UFC Fight For The Troops 3 on November 6, 2013. He lost the fight via knockout in the first round. The loss, however, was subsequently overturned to a no contest when Medeiros tested positive for marijuana.\nEdwards was expected to face Piotr Hallmann at UFC 173 on May 24, 2014.  However, the bout was moved and took place on June 7, 2014, at UFC Fight Night 42 instead. Edwards lost the fight via rear-naked choke submission in the third round.\nEdwards faced Akbarh Arreola on November 22, 2014, at UFC Fight Night 57. He lost the fight via armbar submission in the first round.\nRetirement\nFollowing the loss, Edwards announced his official retirement from mixed martial arts, closing out his career after seventeen years. Edwards said on Facebook \"Fighting has been a part of my life ever since I was 17 and that makes this a hard pill to swallow but it's time for me to end this chapter and move on to the next part of my life.\" Edwards is the only mixed martial arts fighter that competed for UFC, PRIDE, WEC, Strikeforce and Bellator.\nProfessional grappling career\nEdwards competed against Joshua Sharpless at Submission Hunter Pro 84 on July 22, 2023, losing by unanimous decision.\nFighting style\nThugjitsu\nThe term \"Thugjitsu\" first emerged with Edwards, its proclaimed founder. Edwards was seen by many as an unorthodox fighter. This was exemplified by Edwards's flying head kick KO of Josh Thomson at UFC 49. Edwards's fighting style led to his nickname \"Thugjitsu Master\".\nEdwards defined Thugjitsu as \"The combination of every range of fighting and is the ultimate combat sport. Boxing, Thaiboxing, Wrestling and BJJ all play an equally important role in Thugjitsu; yet none of these arts is enough to be successful alone. A solid combination of two, three or more these and other arts help in the make-up of the complete fighter.\"\nUFC Lightweight Dustin Poirier proclaimed himself to be a Thugjitsu practitioner in honor of Edwards.\nInfluences\nEdwards has stated that UFC Hall of Famer Bas Rutten is his idol. Bas Rutten watched Edwards's third pro-MMA fight in 1998, in which Edwards defeated Tim Horton in the first round via TKO. Edwards was invited by Rutten to spend time with him in his car. \"Bas is always an awesome guy,\" said Edwards, \"He's cool as hell. One of the nicest guys in the game.\"\nPersonal life\nEdwards has a daughter and a son.\nFilmography\nFilm and documentary\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|2010 || Circle of Pain || Bronner ||\n|-\n|2010 || Beatdown || Kyle || Stunt performer\n|-\n|2011 || Never Back Down 2: The Beatdown || || Stunt performer\n|-\n|2011 || Warrior || Houston Greggs ||\n|-\n|2013 || Olympus Has Fallen ||  || Stunt performer\n|-\n|2015 || Straight Outta Compton ||  || Stunt performer\n|-\n|2017 || Concussed: The American Dream || Himself || Documentary\n|-\n|2020 || Bruised || Sport Commentator #1 ||\n|}\nTelevision\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|2016 || Westworld ||  || Stunt performer\n|}\nChampionships and accomplishments\n* Ultimate Fighting Championship\n** Fight of the Night (Two times) vs. Joe Stevenson and Cody McKenzie\n** Knockout of the Night (One time) vs. Jeremy Stephens\n** Submission of the Night (One time) vs. Cody McKenzie\n**UFC Encyclopedia Awards\n***Fight of the Night (One time)\n*HOOKnSHOOT\n**HnS Middleweight Championship (One time)\nMixed martial arts record\n|-\n|  Loss\n| align=center|\n| Akbarh Arreola\n| Submission (armbar)\n| UFC Fight Night: Edgar vs. Swanson\n|\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 1:52\n| Austin, Texas, United States\n|\n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 42–21–1 (1)\n| Piotr Hallmann\n| Submission (rear-naked choke)\n| UFC Fight Night: Henderson vs. Khabilov\n|\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 2:31\n| Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States\n|\n|-\n| NC\n| align=center| 42–20–1 (1)\n| Yancy Medeiros\n| No Contest (overturned)\n| UFC: Fight for the Troops 3\n|\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 2:47\n| Fort Campbell, Kentucky, United States\n|\n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 42–20–1\n| Daron Cruickshank\n| Decision (split)\n| UFC on Fox: Johnson vs. Moraga\n|\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Seattle, Washington, United States\n|\n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 42–19–1\n| Isaac Vallie-Flagg\n| Decision (split)\n| UFC 156\n|\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Las Vegas, Nevada, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 42–18–1\n| Jeremy Stephens\n| KO (punches and elbows)\n| UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Diaz\n|\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 1:55\n| Seattle, Washington, United States\n|\n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 41–18–1\n| Tony Ferguson\n| Decision (unanimous)\n| The Ultimate Fighter 14 Finale\n|\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Las Vegas, Nevada, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 41–17–1\n| Rafaello Oliveira\n| TKO (head kick and punches)\n| UFC Live: Cruz vs. Johnson\n|\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center| 2:44\n| Washington, D.C., United States\n|\n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 40–17–1\n| Sam Stout\n| KO (punch)\n| UFC 131\n|\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 3:52\n| Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 40–16–1\n| Cody McKenzie\n| Submission (rear-naked choke)\n| UFC: Fight for the Troops 2\n|\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center| 4:33\n| Fort Hood, Texas, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 39–16–1\n| John Gunderson\n| Decision (unanimous)\n| UFC Fight Night: Marquardt vs. Palhares\n|\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Austin, Texas, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 38–16–1\n| Luis Palomino\n| Decision (unanimous)\n| Bellator 24\n|\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Hollywood, Florida, United States\n|\n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 37–16–1\n| Mike Campbell\n| Decision (unanimous)\n| Moosin: God of Martial Arts\n|\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| Worcester, Massachusetts, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 37–15–1\n| Derrick Noble\n| TKO (punches)\n| MFC 24\n|\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 4:44\n| Edmonton, Alberta, Canada\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 36–15–1\n| Kyle Jensen\n| TKO (punches)\n| Raging Wolf 5\n|\n| align=center| 1\n| align=center| 2:44\n| Niagara Falls, New York, United States\n|\n|-\n| Win\n| align=center| 35–15–1\n| James Warfield\n| Submission (triangle choke)\n| Shine Fights 2: American Top Team vs. The World\n|\n| align=center| 2\n| align=center| 4:48\n| Miami, Florida, United States\n|\n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 34–15–1\n| Duane Ludwig\n| Decision (unanimous)\n| Strikeforce: Destruction\n|\n| align=center| 3\n| align=center| 5:00\n| San Jose, California, United States\n|\n|-\n| Loss\n| align=center| 34–14–1\n| K.
