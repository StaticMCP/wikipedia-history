But on May 4, 1939 the British government requested that Peter Pares, previously British consul in the Sudetenland, be recognized as the British consul in Bratislava. On May 15, 1939 Richard Butler stated to the House of Commons that the move constituted a de facto recognition of the Slovak State. The Slovak State sent Milan A. P. Harminc to London as its consul-general. However, after the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 Harminc and the Slovak ambassador in Warsaw Ladislav Szathmáry protested against the Slovak participation in the assault and subordinated themselves to Edvard Beneš' Czechoslovak government-in-exile.\nThe two countries ratified an air services agreement in 2004.\nEconomic relations\nFollowing Brexit, Trade between the United Kingdom and Belgium has been governed by the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement since 1 January 2021.\nThe two countries signed a bilateral investment agreement on 10 July 1990.
