He was an original Governor of the Bank of England and served as  Lord Mayor of London in 1718.\nWard was the second son of John Ward, commissioner of customs, of Tanshelf, near Pontefract, Yorkshire and his wife Elizabeth Vincent, daughter of Thomas Vincent of Barnbrough, Yorkshire. His uncle was Sir Patience Ward, Lord Mayor of London in 1680. He married Mary Bucknell, the daughter of Sir William Bucknall of Oxhey Place, Hertfordshire on 17 April 1684. In 1700 he acquired Hookfield Park on Clay Hill Epsom, with the help of his father in law.\nWard was one of the original directors of the Bank of England from 1694 to 1699, served as Deputy Governor from 1699 to 1701 and as Governor from 1701 to 1703.  He then resumed his directorship from 1703 to his death. He was also a director of the East India Company from 1703 to 1707 and from 1709 to 1711.\nWard was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Bletchingley at the first general election of 1701, with the support of his friend Sir Robert Clayton. He was returned unopposed again at the second general election of 1701 and in the general elections of 1702 and 1705. At the 1708 British general election he was elected in a contest as MP for  City of London. In 1709 he became Freeman of the Merchant Taylors’ Company and its master for the year 1709 to 1710. He was also elected a London alderman for Candlewick ward on 7 April 1709.   He was unsuccessful in the general elections of 1710 and 1713. He was knighted on 25 September 1714.\nWard was elected again as MP for the City of London at the 1715 British general election. He was selected as Sheriff of London for the year 1715 to 1716 and was elected Lord Mayor of London for the year 1718 to 1719. He did not stand at the 1722 British general election but was returned as MP for Dunwich at a by-election on 7 December 1722.\nPolitically he was regarded as a Whig, but usually very independent of the government, and at one time as MP for the City of London was supported by the Tories and largely voted for their candidates.  Towards the end of his life he had reconciled with the government and worked for their interests in the City.\nWard died in  March 1726, leaving a son, John, and ten daughters.\nSee also\n*Chief Cashier of the Bank of England\nReferences"
