He made his debut in a 0–0 draw against local rivals Ramsgate. Whilst at Dover Athletic, he helped them secure the title and promotion to the Conference South. On 22 June 2009, he rejected a new one-year deal from Millwall, and was therefore out of contract and released.\nAt the start of the 2009–10 season, Edwards signed for Grays Athletic along with eight other players. On 24 March 2010, Edwards played in a behind closed doors reserve match for Crystal Palace against Millwall. He was released at the end of the 2009–10 season.\nEdwards signed for Ebbsfleet United on 28 July 2010, after a successful trial period.\nHe became a YouTube sensation in February 2011, racking up over eight million views (as of late June 2014), after being sent off just ten seconds into a 3–0 defeat to Farnborough. This is believed to be a record for a goalkeeper.\nDespite this setback, Preston became a fan favourite amongst club fans and a key asset for the club. After promotion, Preston asserted himself as Ebbsfleet number one before an ankle injury cut his season short. Despite the club finishing second bottom of the Conference Premier in the 2012–13 season, Edwards drew praise from many for his performances throughout the season and went on to dominate the club's end of season awards ceremony, winning a large majority of the trophies on offer including the Players player of the year and the Fans player of the year award. Although it was rumoured that his services were wanted by John Still, the recently appointed manager of Luton Town, Edwards signed a new contract with the club, keeping him on for the 2013–14 season.\nEdwards continued as the club's first-choice goalkeeper for the 2013–14 season and was kept on for the 2014-15 campaign. During that season, his spot as the club's first choice goalkeeper was challenged by Brandon Hall. Manager Jamie Day brought him back into the team for the FA Trophy clash with Forest Green Rovers on 10 January in which he helped secure a 1–0 win. Edwards made his 200th appearance for the club in the 2–2 draw with Hemel Hempstead Town in late February.\nAhead of the 2015–16 season, Edwards joined newly promoted National League side Boreham Wood on a season-long loan deal. However the deal was cut short with Edwards making only six league appearances, and he went on to join Isthmian League Premier Division side Dulwich Hamlet on loan on 20 February 2016 for the remainder of the season.\nWith his contract at Ebbsfleet expiring, Edwards signed for Dulwich Hamlet ahead of the 2016–17 season, going on to make 66 appearances in all competitions in his first full season at the club.\nIn January 2022, Edwards returned to Cheshunt having spent time with the club on loan in 2020. At the end of the season, he signed for Potters Bar Town.\nOn 7 October 2023, Edwards' return to Dulwich Hamlet was announced.\nInternational career\nIn October 2010 Edwards was called up to the England C team for the first time.\nFamily\nHis sister Steph reached the final of the 2013 series of ''Britain's Got Talent'' as part of the band Luminites.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Millwall\n| 2007–08\n|League One\n|1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||2||0\n|-\n| 2008–09\n|League One\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||2||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Dover Athletic (loan)\n| 2008–09\n|Isthmian League Premier Division\n|13||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||13||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Grays Athletic\n| 2009–10\n|Conference Premier\n|20||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||20||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Ebbsfleet United\n| 2010–11\n|Conference South\n|41||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||0||46||0\n|-\n| 2011–12\n|Conference Premier\n|31||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||35||0\n|-\n| 2012–13\n|Conference Premier\n|43||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0||46||0\n|-\n| 2013–14\n|Conference South\n|44||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||49||0\n|-\n| 2014–15\n|Conference South\n|15||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||4||0||19||0\n|-\n| 2015–16\n|National League South\n|0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!174||0||8||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||13||0||195||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Boreham Wood (loan)\n| 2015–16\n|National League\n|6||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||7||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Dulwich Hamlet (loan)\n| 2015–16\n|Isthmian League Premier Division\n|12||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||0||14||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Dulwich Hamlet\n| 2016–17\n|Isthmian League Premier Division\n|44||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||17||0||63||0\n|-\n| 2017–18\n|Isthmian League Premier Division\n|34||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||39||0\n|-\n| 2018–19\n|National League South\n|40||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||3||0||45||0\n|-\n| 2019–20\n|National League South\n|5||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||2||0||7||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!123||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||25||0||154||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Cheshunt (loan)\n| 2019–20\n|Isthmian League Premier Division\n|2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||2||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Dartford\n| 2019–20\n|National League South\n|0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||0||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"1\"|Brentwood Town\n| 2020–21\n|Isthmian League North Division\n|3||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||6||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Braintree Town\n| 2020–21\n|National League South\n|6||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||6||0\n|-\n| 2021–22\n|National League South\n|6||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||7||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!12||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||13||0\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Cheshunt\n| 2021–22\n|Isthmian League Premier Division\n|18||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||colspan=\"2\"|—||5||0||23||0\n|-\n| 2022–23\n|National League South\n|14||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||15||0\n|-\n!colspan=2|Total\n!32||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||5||0||38||0\n|-\n|Potters Bar Town\n|2023–24\n|Isthmian League Premier Division\n|10||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0||11||0\n|-\n!colspan=3|Career total\n!408||0||21||0||0||0||46||0||475||0\n|}\nHonours\n;Ebbsfleet United\nConference South play-off winners: 2010–2011\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/dulwichhamlet/teams/56196/player/preston-edwards-1651513 Preston Edwards] at Dulwich Hamlet F.C."
