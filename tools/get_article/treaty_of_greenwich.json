The accord, overall, entailed a plan developed by Henry VIII of England to unite both kingdoms (i.e. Union of the Crowns). The first sub-treaty helped to establish peace between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland. The second sub-treaty was a marriage proposal between Edward VI of England and Mary, Queen of Scots. In this part of the treaty, it was agreed that Mary would be accompanied by an English nobleman/gentleman (and his wife) until she was ten years old. Afterwards, Mary would reside in England until the time of her marriage. Also, the Treaty of Greenwich permitted the Kingdom of Scotland to maintain its laws. Even though the Earl of Arran signed the accord on 1 July and ratified it on 25 August 1543, the Treaty of Greenwich was ultimately rejected by the Parliament of Scotland on 11 December 1543, leading to eight years of Anglo-Scottish conflict known as the Rough Wooing.\nDiplomacy\nThe treaty was the culmination of diplomatic efforts by Adam Otterburn, George Douglas of Pittendreich and Earl of Glencairn in London, and Ralph Sadler in Edinburgh. The commissioners for Mary (with the consent of Regent Arran) were Glencairn, Pittendreich, William Hamilton, James Learmonth of Dairsie and Henry Balnaves. Henry's commissioners were Baron Audley of Walden, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, Stephen Gardiner Bishop of Winchester, Thomas Thirlby Bishop of Westminster, and the Barons St John and Gage.\nA significant part of the negotiation was the understanding, on the part of Regent Arran, Governor of Scotland, that his son James Hamilton would marry Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.\nArticles signed at Greenwich Palace\nTwo Anglo-Scottish treaties were signed at  Greenwich Palace on 1 July 1543. The first treaty was a general peace treaty in traditional terms. The articles agreed were;\n# Peace during the life of either Henry VIII or Mary, Queen of Scots and for one year after.\n# That neither monarch shall make war upon the other or his confederates, or do anything to the hurt of the other.\n# If anyone, spiritual or temporal, even though pretending supreme authority, allied or connected with either Prince, shall do or procure any hurt to any territory of the other, the Prince shall not give, or permit his subjects to give, any aid thereto, notwithstanding any former contracts.\n# That neither monarch, upon pretext of any ecclesiastical sentence or censure, shall violate any article of this treaty; and that either party shall, within three months of this date, before notaries and in presence of ambassadors, publicly and in writing renounce all privileges, dispensations etc., which might impede the effect of this treaty.\n# Neither monarch shall receive the other's rebels or traitors, but deliver them up within 20 days, upon letters of requisition\n# Nor homicides, robbers, and other fugitives, who shall be delivered within ten days.\n# Neither monarch to give safe-conducts to subjects of the other except upon the latter's written request.\n# Punishment of homicides, robbers etc., on the Marches according to the laws of the Marches.\n# Ships, sailors and merchants to be well treated as in former times of peace, and specially in accordance with the treaty between Edward IV and James III dated 1 June 1464.\n# Right of subjects whose goods are spoiled and carried across the March to follow in pursuit of them.\n# No dweller in either March or in the Debatable Ground to take timber out of the other March without obtaining leave.\n# The castle and town of Berwick upon Tweed with its ancient limits shall remain at peace.\n# The repairing or breaking of the fish garth of Esk shall not be held an attemptate against this treaty.\n# Fugitives of Scotland who have become lieges of the King of England to be treated as Englishmen, and similarly Englishmen, if any, who may have become lieges of the Queen of Scots as Scots.\n# Any subject of either monarch who, being despoiled by a subject of the other, shall of himself make reprisals, shall thereby forfeit his cause.\n# The island of Lundy in England and the lordship of Lorne in Scotland are not comprised in this peace.\n# Attacks upon Lundy and Lorne shall not be considered ruptures of this peace.\n# In this treaty are comprehended, for England the Emperor Charles, the king of the Romans and the Hanse and Teutonic companies, and for Scotland the Emperor Charles, the French king, the king of the Romans, the king of Denmark, the dukes of Gueldres and Holstein, the margrave of Brandenburg and the Company of the Teutonic Hanse; and all friends and confederates of both parties, unless they detain lands, pensions or goods of either party or molest his lands, in which case they shall not be held as comprehended.
