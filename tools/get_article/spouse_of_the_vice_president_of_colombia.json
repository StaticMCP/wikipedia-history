Coined in contrast to \"first lady\"—though less frequently used—the \"second lady\" term's origin is not clearly documented, but María Victoria García de Santos (wife of Francisco Santos Calderón, vice president from 2002 to 2010) is generally considered the title's originator, given her prominent role during Álvaro Uribe's presidency. The first second gentleman of Colombia was Álvaro Rincón, husband of Marta Lucía Ramírez, vice president from 2018 to 2022.\nThree second ladies became first ladies during their husbands' presidential terms. The first was Ana Narváez de Caro, wife of Miguel Antonio Caro, second vice president (1892-1894) and sixth president (1894-1898). The most recent was María Antonia Ferrero de González, wife of Ramón González Valencia, fourth vice president (1904-1905) and eleventh president (1909-1910).\nSince the 1990s, the vice presidential official residence is the Vice Presidential House in Bogotá, D.C.\nHistory\nThe second spouse's visibility in the public sphere is a recent development. While the role of the first lady as hostess of the Casa de Nariño dates back to the early days of the republic (and was usually filled by another member of the president's family if he was single or widowed), it wasn't until the late 21st century that vice presidents' wives assumed visible public roles.\nThe role of the second lady or gentleman is unpaid and not formally defined. Traditionally, the wife of the Vice President of Colombia was expected to act as hostess and appear at social events. The issue of the status of the second spouse became a topic of debate in 2023 when Yerney Pinillo, partner of Vice President Francia Márquez (2022-2026), assumed the role of escort during her official and state visits, since they were not married.\nLuz María Zapata, wife of Vice President Germán Vargas Lleras, was the first second lady to significantly enhance the role of vice president's spouse. When Santos assumed office in 2010, the second lady's only official function was to accompany the vice president on official visits. However, Zapata promoted her own initiatives, without overshadowing those of first lady María Clemencia de Santos, and provided support during natural disasters, in addition to distinguishing herself through her personal achievements.\nList\nSpouses (1819–present)\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#cccccc\"\n!Spouse of the Vice President\n!Vice President\n! class=\"unsortable\" |Tenure\n!Date of birth\n!Date of death (age)\n!Tenure as First Lady\n|-\n|Felipa Meilhon Montemayor de Zea\n|Francisco Antonio Zea\n|December 17, 1819 - March 21, 1820\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|María Dolores Cuevas\n|Juan Germán Roscio\n|March 21, 1820 – March 10, 1821\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Magdalena Ortega de Nariño\n|Antonio Nariño\n|April 4, 1821 – June 6, 1821\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Teresa de Rivas del Castillo\n|José María del Castillo\n|June 6, 1821 – October 3, 1821\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Sixta Pontón de Santander\n|Francisco de Paula Santander\n|November 3, 1821 – September 19, 1827\n|\n|\n|1832 – 1837\n|-\n|Juana Jurado de Caycedo\n|Domingo Caycedo\n|May 3, 1830 – November 21, 1831\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Dolores Espinosa de los Monteros Mesa\n|José María Obando\n|November 23, 1831 – March 10, 1832\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|María Antonia del Castillo\n|José Ignacio de Márquez\n|March 10, 1832 – October 7, 1832\n|\n|\n|1837 – 1841\n|-\n|María Josefa Mosquera Hurtado\n|Joaquín Mosquera\n|May 12, 1833 - April 1, 1835\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|María Antonia del Castillo\n|José Ignacio de Márquez\n|April 1, 1835 – April 1, 1837\n|\n|\n|1832 – 1832\n|-\n|Juana Jurado y Bertendona\n|Domingo Caycedo\n|April 1, 1837 – April 1, 1843\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |01.1 Vacant; Gori, José Joaquín Gori was a widower.\n|April 1, 1843 – April 1, 1845\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|María Francisca de Urisarri\n|Rufino Cuervo\n|April 1, 1845 - April 1, 1851\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ana María Gallegos Candanedo\n|José de Obaldía\n|April 1, 1851 - April 1, 1855\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|María Mercedes Cabal\n|Manuel María Mallarino\n|August 5, 1854 - April 1, 1855\n|\n|\n|1855 - 1857\n|-\n|Carmen Ospina Lenis de Payán\n|Eliseo Payán\n|December 13, 1887 – February 8, 1888\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ana de Narváez de Caro\n|Miguel Antonio Caro\n|August 7, 1892 – September 18, 1894\n|\n|\n|1894 – 1898\n|-\n|Matilde Osorio de Marroquín\n|José Manuel Marroquín\n|August 7, 1898 – July 31, 1900\n|\n|\n|1900 - 1904\n|-\n|Antonia Ferrero de González\n|Ramón González Valencia\n|August 7, 1904 – March 10, 1905\n|\n|\n|1909 – 1910\n|-\n|Rosalba Restrepo\n|Humberto De la Calle\n|7 August 1994 – 10 September 1996\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Marta Blanco de Lemos\n|Carlos Lemos Simmonds\n|September 19, 1996 – August 7, 1998\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|María Mercedes de la Espriella\n|Gustavo Bell\n|August 7, 1998 – August 7, 2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|María Victoria García\n|Francisco Santos Calderón\n|August 7, 2002 – August 7, 2010\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Monserrat Muñoz de Garzón\n|Angelino Garzón\n|August 7, 2010 – August 7, 2014\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Luz María Zapata\n|Germán Vargas Lleras\n|August 7, 2014 – March 21, 2017\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Claudia Luque\n|Óscar Naranjo\n|March 29, 2017 – August 7, 2018\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Álvaro Rincón\n|Marta Lucía Ramírez\n|August 7, 2018 – August 7, 2022\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Yerney Pinillo\n|Francia Márquez\n|August 7, 2022 – present\n|\n|--\n|}\nSee also\n* First Lady of Colombia (list)\n* Vice President of Colombia (list)\n* Colombian order of precedence\nReferences"
