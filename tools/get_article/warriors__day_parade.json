It is open to Canadian war veterans, military personnel, first responders and para military marching contingents and bands.  Warriors'Day was inaugurated 26 August 1919 by Edward, Prince of Wales at the Canadian National Exhibition.  The parade was established in 1921 by  Governor General of Canada Julian Byng, and is organised by the Warriors' Day Parade Council. The parade is held on the third Saturday of August and marks the beginning of the Canadian National Exhibition. The parade honours the service of Canadian men and women in the armed forces.\nThe parade route begins at the Princes' Gates, travels along Princes' Boulevard and ends at the Stanley Barracks. Veterans are organized by their units, wars and demonstrations. Veterans are welcomed from Canada and the United States. The Warriors' Day Parade Council awards organizations that participate. The parade is often planned to commemorate specific events such as notable battles.\nFollowing the world wars, participants in the parade included up to  military veterans. In 2019, the number of veterans participating was estimated at just below 3,000. A number of privately owned military vehicles and classic cars also take part in the parade, representing various military vehicle preservation associations.\nIn conjunction with the parade, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) waives transit fares for the day for Canadian Armed Forces personnel, veterans and companions. The TTC Honour Guard also participates in the parade. Similarly, GO Transit also offers free travel for the day of the parade to veterans and current personnel.\nHistory\nThe Exhibition grounds were originally part of the Military Reserve and the relationship between the exhibition was established early. The CNE had been hosting military parades and demonstrations beginning in 1879 to honour military veterans. One notable veterans' day took place at the CNE on August 27, 1919. Veterans of the Great War were given free rein of the grounds until the afternoon, when they attended a baseball game on the Toronto Island. In the evening, the veterans returned to the fair grounds to be reviewed by Edward, Prince of Wales who was visiting Toronto and be entertained by a special show at the Grandstand. It was estimated that  persons attended the CNE that day, including  veterans, some of the battleship HMS Renown.\nThe Warriors' Day parade council was formed in Toronto in 1921, extending the work of the CNE. The council desired a specific day to pay tribute to living veterans of the First World War. Council declared \"Warriors' Day\" and in the early years, it was the first day of the Exhibition.\nThe first Warriors' Day parade was held on August 27, 1921. The parade started at Trinity Bellwoods Park, (then the site of Trinity College) and followed Queen Street and Dufferin Street south to the Exhibition grounds. Governor General Lord Byng, the former Commander of the Canadian Corps at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, took the salute of the veterans in the afternoon. To those present whom he had commanded at Vimy Ridge: \"Byng Boys, I wish you luck. I do not say that because it is the ordinary thing to say to you. I say it to you from the bottom of my heart. I wish you luck in your pleasures, in your work, in your homes, whatever you are doing and wherever you are. Byng Boys, I wish you luck.\" In the evening, festivities were held at the Grandstand for the veterans, including a massed band concert, dancing, gun displays and boxing. The participants included the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Forces nurses, veterans of 1866, past wars and World War I.\nIn 1927, the Warriors' Day Parade coincided with the dedication of the Princes' Gates, attended by HRH Edward, Prince of Wales and his brother Prince George. The archway was built to commemorate 50 years of Canadian Confederation. The parade followed the Royal party along Lake Shore Boulevard through the new arch. The parade was then reviewed by the Princes.\nIn 1938, the parade attracted – Forces personnel and veterans from units in Ontario, Australia and Newfoundland. The eldest present were veterans from the Fenian Raids of 1866 and Australian veterans from the Boer Wars. The Grandstand was used as the reviewing stand for the large contingent.\nFrom 1942 to 1946, the Exhibition Grounds were used as a military camp. The CNE was cancelled, as well as the Warriors' Day Parade. The fair resumed in 1947 along with the Warriors' Day Parade. The 1947 parade was attended by a record  persons. Its route was altered along Lake Shore Boulevard to avoid the Grandstand construction site.\nThe 1959 parade saluted the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway with NATO warships attending, and the ships' companies marching. Lord Mountbatten, Admiral of the Fleet, took the salute from the veteran marchers.\nIn 1966, a South African War veteran passed away on parade. An order was issued to prohibit those veterans from marching in the parade, however twelve veterans over the age of 85 defied the order and joined the marchers in the 1967 parade. Cars to carry those veterans were not approved.\nThe 1989 parade had  marchers and saluted the 75th anniversary of Royal 22nd Regiment of Valcartier, Quebec.\nIn 1999, the Grandstand was demolished and the saluting stage moved to the Band Shell.
