Soon after, the Swedes rallied 1,400 men from the Södermanland (300), Dalarna (above 400), Västerbotten (above 300), and Tavastehus (370) regiments (including sick or elsewhere commanded troops not present at the battle). This number does not count the Karelian Dragoons, Savolax Regiment or the Willebrand infantry which were the first Swedish units to flee and thus suffered the least casualties.\nThe Russians admitted a loss of 515 killed and 1,870 wounded. After the battle, the Swedes claim to have received reports from captured Russian officers stating a loss of 8,000 Russians killed. Von Lacy did not continue his movement after the battle. Henrik Magnus Buddenbrock was executed for his perceived incompetence.\nSwedish units\nRussian Colonel Christoph Hermann Manstein's estimates of the Swedish strength, reportedly derived from Wrangel's muster roll at the day of the battle. It is unknown if this also includes sick and elsewhere commanded soldiers not present at the battle. Manstein's figures does, however, include the Kymmenegård (Kiminogon) battalion and the second Savolax battalion, neither of which were present at the battle (these are struck through).\n*Dalarna Regiment—623 men (311 killed or captured, 44 wounded)\n*Södermanland Regiment—681 men\n*Västerbotten Regiment—594 men (157 killed or captured)\n*Savolax Regiment—876 men/one battalion}}\n*Tavastehus Regiment—955 men\n*Willebrand Regiment—432 men\n*Kymmenegård (Kiminogon) battalion—476 men/none\n*Karelian Dragoons—506 men\n*Artillery personnel—113 men\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n|first=Carl Gustaf\n|last=Malmström\n|language=sv\n|year=1863\n|publisher=Hjerta\n|location=Stockholm\n|oclc=457964593\n}}\n*\n*\n|first=Adolph Ivar\n|last=Arwidsson\n|language=sv\n|year=1854\n|publisher=Norstedt\n|location=Stockholm\n|oclc=558098460\n}}\n*\n|first=Nicolaas\n|last=ten Hoorn\n|language=nl\n|year=1744\n|publisher=Nicolaas ten Hoorn\n|location=Amsterdam\n|oclc=72721912\n}}\n*\n|first=Christoph Hermann\n|last=Manstein\n|year=1770\n|publisher=Becket and De Hondt\n|location=London\n|oclc=\n246984026\n}}\n*\n|first=Carl Gillis Alexander\n|last=Bergenstråhle\n|language=sv\n|year=1917\n|publisher=P.
