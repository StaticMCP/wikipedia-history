It is one of the oldest law schools in the country and the oldest historically black law school in the United States.\nHoward University School of Law confers about 185 Juris Doctor and Master of Law degrees annually to students from the United States and countries in South America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. The school was accredited by the American Bar Association and the Association of American Law Schools in 1931.\nHistory\nHoward University opened its legal department, led by John Mercer Langston, on January 6, 1869. The founders of Howard Law recognized \"a great need to train lawyers who would have a strong commitment to helping black Americans secure and protect their newly established rights\" during the country's tumultuous Reconstruction era.\nThe first class consisted of six students who met three evenings a week in the homes and offices of the department's four teachers. Classes were held in various locations throughout the years before the law school settled into its current location at 2900 Van Ness Street N.W. in 1974. At the time, the LL.B program required only two years of study.  Ten students were awarded degrees at the first commencement ceremony, which was held on February 3, 1871.\nThe school was accredited by the American Bar Association and the Association of American Law Schools in 1931.\nWomen at Howard Law\nHoward Law was the first school in the nation to have a non-discriminatory admissions policy. From its founding, it admitted white male and female students along with black students. It was a progressive policy at the time to admit women, but only eight women graduated from Howard Law during the first 30 years of its existence.\nAn 1890 review of women lawyers in the United States published in The Green Bag, found that many women had difficulty being admitted to law school, or gaining admission to the bar, and practice, even at Howard.\nCharlotte E. Ray was admitted to Howard's law program in 1869 and graduated in 1872, becoming its first black female lawyer. It is reported that Ray applied for admission to the bar using initials for her given and middle names, in order to disguise her gender, because she was \"[a]ware of the school's reluctant commitment to the principle of sexual equality.\"\nMary Ann Shadd Cary was among four women enrolled in the law school in 1880. She said in 1890 that she had actually been admitted to Howard's law program in September 1869, prior to Ray. However, Cary claims she was barred from graduating on time because of her gender and did not graduate until 1883.\nEliza A. Chambers, an early white female graduate of Howard's law program, was admitted in 1885 and successfully completed the three-year course of study, earning two diplomas. But, \"the Law School faculty refused to hand in [Eliza's] name to the examiners, for admission to practice, omitting her from the list of her male classmates whom they recommended, simply because she was a woman.\" After that, she succeeded in entering practice.\nTies to the civil rights movement\nHoward University School of Law has significant ties to the civil rights movement. Former HUSL Dean Charles Hamilton Houston's work for the NAACP earned him the title of \"The Man Who Killed Jim Crow.\" Thurgood Marshall, a 1933 graduate of Howard Law, successfully argued the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case before the U.S. Supreme Court and in 1967 became the first African-American Supreme Court Justice. In 1950, Howard law graduate Pauli Murray published ''States' Laws on Race and Color, an examination and critique of state segregation laws throughout the nation. Thurgood Marshall called the book the \"bible\" of the civil rights movement. In 1952 and again in 1953, two HUSL professors, James Nabrit Jr. and George E. C. Hayes, successfully argued the landmark Supreme Court case Bolling v. Sharpe, a companion case to Brown v. Board of Education''.\nAcademics\nCurriculum\nFirst year students at Howard Law are required to take courses on civil procedure; constitutional law; contracts; criminal law; legislation and regulation; legal reasoning, research, and writing; real property; and torts. Students must also take courses on evidence and professional responsibility and fulfill the school's scholarly writing requirement.\nThe school offered 126 courses beyond the first year curriculum in the 2021-22 academic year.\nDegrees offered\nHoward University School of Law offers the Juris Doctor (J.D.) and the Master of Laws (LL.M.). Additionally, students can enroll in the four-year J.D./M.B.A. dual degree program with the Howard University School of Business.\nHUSL students can also earn a certificate in family law.\nFaculty\nAs of 2022, Howard Law employed 37 full-time faculty and 63 non-full-time faculty. The school's student-faculty ratio accounting for full-time faculty was 12.5 to 1. Over 80 percent of faculty members are people of color.\nPrograms and clinics\nHoward Law boasts three institutes and centers: the Education Rights Center, the Institute of Intellectual Property and Social Justice, and the World Food Law Institute.\nThe school's Clinical Law Center also offers eight in-house legal clinics that provide students with first-hand legal experience as well as an Externship and Equal Justice Program. These clinics are:\n*Alternative Dispute Resolution Clinic\n*Child Welfare Clinic\n*Civil Rights Clinic\n*Criminal Justice Clinic\n*Fair Housing Clinic\n*Intellectual Property and Trademark Clinic\n*Investor Justice and Education Clinic\n*Movement Lawyering Clinic\nPublications\nHoward Law has published the student-managed Howard Law Journal since 1955. The school also publishes the Howard Human & Civil Rights Law Review, formerly known as the Human Rights & Globalization Law Review and the successor to the Howard Scroll: Social Justice Law Review.\nThe Barrister is the HUSL student-edited newspaper.\nThe school publishes a news journal, The Jurist, and the Howard Docket newsletter. For the school's 140th anniversary, the school published A Legacy of Defending the Constitution: A Pictorial History Book of Howard University School of Law (1869-2009).\nStudent life\nHoward Law enrolled 464 J.D. students for the 2021-2022 academic year, 100% of whom were enrolled full-time. The student body is two-thirds women, and just over three-fourths of J.D. students identify as Black or African-American. About 15% identify as multiracial, with small numbers of students who are Hispanic, Asian, White, or another group. As of 2022, the law school admitted 31 percent of applicants. HUSL students may participate in 26 extra-curricular groups, including the moot court team, associations focused on specific areas of law, law fraternities, and political, ethnic, and religious affiliation groups.\nCampus\nThe campus is located at 2900 Van Ness St NW, Washington, DC 20008 in the upper Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., in the Forest Hills area of the city.  It is a few blocks from the University of the District of Columbia, the former headquarters of Intelsat and the Van Ness–UDC station on the Washington Metro. The law school is located on its own  campus approximately five miles from the main campus.\nThe campus was built by Dunbarton College of the Holy Cross, which built it in the 1930s and occupied it until the school closed in 1973. Howard purchased the campus in 1974 and moved its law school to it the same year. The law school shares the campus with Howard's School of Divinity.\nThe school's main building, Houston Hall, is named after Charles Hamilton Houston. The library was named after Vernon Jordan after his death in March 2021.\nAdmissions\nHoward Law had a 31% acceptance rate in 2022 with the school receiving 1,813 applications. The school's matriculation rate was 28% with 160 of the 565 admits enrolling. The median LSAT score for students enrolling in HUSL in 2022 was 154 (60th percentile) and the median GPA was 3.49.\nEmployment\nAccording to Howard Law's official 2022 ABA-required disclosures, 78% of the Class of 2022 obtained full-time, long-term, bar passage-required employment nine months after graduation. HUSL's full-time long-term bar passage-required employment rate for 2022 graduates was similar to the national average of 77% for ABA-approved law schools, estimated ten months after graduation.\nAccording to the National Directory of Legal Employers, 128 firms conduct on-campus interviews at Howard Law and includes elite firms like Debevoise & Plimpton, which only conducts interviews at 25 law schools. In terms of elite placement as of 2013, while more than 60% students who graduated from Yale Law School and Cornell Law School in 2013 were hired for federal clerkships or at law firms with more than 250 employees, only 13% of 2013 Howard Law graduates secured such positions.\nHoward Law's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 10%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2022 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. Of the 160 graduates of the Class of 2022, 84.4% had some full time job, and 77.5% had a full-time job requiring a JD.\nHoward Law placed 45th on the 2014 National Law Journal \"Top 50 Go-To\" list, climbed to No. 22 on the 2015 list, fell to 37th for the 2016 list, and climbed back to 32nd for the 2017 list. The list ranks the top 50 schools by the percentage of JDs who accept first-year associate positions at the 100 largest firms.\nCosts\nThe cost of tuition and fees at Howard Law for the 2022-2023 academic year is $37,160, and estimated cost of attendance is $68,620 when estimated living expenses are included. The $68,620 total cost of attendance at Howard Law is lower than some schools in the D.C. area — for example George Washington University Law School's total cost of attendance was $100,000 for the 2023-2024 academic year — but higher than others, such as the University of the District of Columbia's David A. Clarke School of Law where the total cost of attendance for D.C. residents for the 2023-2024 school year was $45,731 (and $58,665 for non-residents).\nThe Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $248,300 as of 2022.\nRankings\nU.S. News & World Report ranked Howard Law 98th out of 192 schools in its 2023 rankings.
