The scheme includes a small number of plaques that were erected privately and subsequently absorbed.\nThe scheme began in 1866. It was originally administered by the Royal Society of Arts until 1901 when it was taken over the London County Council. The LCC ran the scheme until its abolition in 1965 when its successor body the Greater London Council (GLC) took charge. Since the abolition of the GLC in 1986, the blue plaque scheme has been administered by English Heritage.\nBy borough\nBarking and Dagenham\nThere is a single blue plaque in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.\n|}\nBarnet\nThere are 19 blue plaques in the London Borough of Barnet.\n| year = 2007\n| image = Harold_Abrahams_1899-1978_Olympic_athlete_lived_here.jpg\n| commonscat =\n| open_plaques = 437\n| notes =\n}}\n| year = 1975\n| image = John_Linnell_1792-1882_painter_lived_here._William_Blake_1757-1827_poet_and_artist_stayed_here_as_his_guest.jpg\n| commonscat =\n| open_plaques = 521\n| notes =\n}}\n| year = 2019\n| image = Sir_WILLIAM_BOWMAN_1816-1892_Ophthalmic_surgeon_and_anatomist_lived_here.jpg\n| commonscat =\n| open_plaques = 52363\n| notes =\n}}\n| year = 2017\n| image = Wing Commander J.R.D.

In April of 1879, the Society approached the Corporation of the City of London to ask for their co-operation, and \"to undertake  the erection of suitable Memorial Tablets within the City Boundaries.\" The matter was referred the City Lands Committee and approved. From then, until 1985, no further plaques were erected within the City by the official London plaque scheme, with rectangular plaques commemorating notable individuals, buildings and sites of historical interest being placed by the Corporation of London instead.\nIn 1985, the Labour-led Greater London Council under Ken Livingstone, taking matters into its own hands after a long-promised Corporation plaque had failed to materialise, erected a black 'medallion' shaped plaque commemorating the site of the Congregational Memorial Hall where the Labour Party had been formed in 1900 at Caroone House in Farringdon. The building was demolished in 2004 and the plaque removed from the scheme by English Heritage. The plaque still exists, having been privately rehung at two different office buildings built on the site of Caroone House in the intervening years.\n|}\nCity of Westminster\nThere are 331 blue plaques in the City of Westminster.\nSee also\n* List of blue plaques\n* List of former English Heritage blue plaques\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://openplaques.org/organisations/english_heritage English Heritage plaques] recorded on openplaques.org\n*[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/ English Heritage  – Blue plaques]\n*[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/ English Heritage – Search blue plaques]\n*[https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/property-news/london-has-933-blue-plaques-plotted-on-this-new-interactive-map-find-out-whos-lived-near-you-a119881.html/ London has 933 blue plaques plotted on this new interactive map — find out who's lived near you] Interactive map by Esri April 2018"
