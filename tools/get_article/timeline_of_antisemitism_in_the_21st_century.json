      "text": "# Timeline of antisemitism in the 21st century\n\nThis timeline of antisemitism chronicles the facts of antisemitism, hostile actions or discrimination against Jews as a religious or ethnic group, in the 21st century. It includes events in the history of antisemitic thought, actions taken to combat or relieve the effects of antisemitism, and events that affected the prevalence of antisemitism in later years. The history of antisemitism can be traced from ancient times to the present day.\n2000\n;2000s: Craig Raine, in his books In Defence of T. S. Eliot (2001) and T. S. Eliot (2006), sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\" In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic Terry Eagleton also questioned the validity of Raine's defense of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the Archangel Gabriel does him no favours.\"\n;2000: Richard Baumhammers walked to the home of his next-door neighbor, a 63-year-old Jewish woman named Anita \"Nicki\" Gordon and fatally shot her, then set her house on fire. Some time after that, he drove to the Beth El Congregation in Scott Township, where Gordon was a member of the synagogue. There, he fired into the windows of the synagogue, then exited his vehicle and spray-painted two red swastikas on the building. Baumhammers later drove to the Ahavath Achim Congregation in Carnegie where he shattered the synagogue's glass windows with gunfire.\n;2000: In April 2000 the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism and Union des étudiants juifs de France (the Union of French Jewish Students) brought a case against Yahoo! in which it objected to the auctioning of Nazi memorabilia, in France, via Yahoo!'s website on the basis that it contravened Article R645-1. Though a French judge initially ordered Yahoo! to take measures to make it impossible for users in France to purchase any Nazi memorabilia through the Yahoo! site, in December 2001, the US District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Yahoo! would be shielded from the judgement of the French court.\n;2000: The Temple Beth El building, but not the sanctuary, was heavily damaged in an arson attack on 13 October 2000. Palestinian-American Ramsi Uthman was convicted in the attack. Ahed Shehadeh was convicted of aiding and abetting the arson. According to Shehadeh's testimony, after Uthman set fire to the Temple, he yelled \"I did this for you, God!\" In exchange for his testimony Shehadeh received a five-year prison sentence, and was released in 2008. Uthman received the maximum possible sentence of 25 years, to be served in New York's Attica Correctional Facility, although he will be eligible for parole in 2021. The building reopened in 2001 after repairing some $700,000 of damage from the attack.\n;2000: Firebombing of a New York synagogue (Conservative Synagogue Adath Israel of Riverdale), 2000 New York terror attack.\n;2000: The Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Nova Scotia enacted legislation to recognize Holocaust Memorial Day in 2000.\n;2000 October 31: Beth Israel Synagogue (Edmonton) is firebombed.\n;2000: On 22 November 2000, Judge Edward R. Korman announced a settlement of the World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks with his approval of a plan featuring the payment of $1.25&nbsp;billion into funds controlled by the Israeli Banking Trust. Judah Gribetz was appointed Special Master to administer the plan, which is sometimes called the Gribetz Plan after its chief author.\n;2000: David Irving v Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt is a case in English law, decided in 2000, against American author Deborah Lipstadt and her publisher Penguin Books, filed in an English court by the British author David Irving in 1996, asserting that Lipstadt had libeled him in her book Denying the Holocaust. The court ruled that the Irving's claim of libel relating to English defamation law and Holocaust denial was not valid because his deliberate distortion of evidence has been shown to be substantially true. English libel law puts the burden of proof on the defence, meaning that it was up to Lipstadt and her publisher to prove that her claims of Irving's deliberate misrepresentation of evidence to conform to his ideological viewpoints were substantially true. Lipstadt hired British-Jewish lawyer Anthony Julius while Penguin hired libel experts Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman of media law firm Davenport Lyons. Richard J. Evans, an established historian, was hired by the defence to serve as an expert witness. Evans spent two years examining Irving's work, and presented evidence of Irving's misrepresentations, including evidence that Irving had knowingly used forged documents as source material. Upon mutual agreement, the case was argued as a bench trial before Mr. Justice Charles Gray, who produced a written judgment 333 pages long in favour of the defendants, in which he detailed Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of World War II.\n;2000: During the 2000 Presidential election, Lee Alcorn, president of the Dallas NAACP branch, criticized Al Gore's selection of Senator Joe Lieberman for his Vice-Presidential candidate because Lieberman was Jewish. On a gospel talk radio show on station KHVN, Alcorn stated, \"If we get a Jew person, then what I'm wondering is, I mean, what is this movement for, you know? Does it have anything to do with the failed peace talks?\" ... \"So I think we need to be very suspicious of any kind of partnerships between the Jews at that kind of level because we know that their interest primarily has to do with money and these kind of things.\"NAACP President Kweisi Mfume immediately suspended Alcorn and condemned his remarks. Mfume stated, \"I strongly condemn those remarks. I find them to be repulsive, anti-Semitic, anti-NAACP and anti-American. Mr. Alcorn does not speak for the NAACP, its board, its staff or its membership. We are proud of our long-standing relationship with the Jewish community and I personally will not tolerate statements that run counter to the history and beliefs of the NAACP in that regard.\"\n: Alcorn, who had been suspended three times in the previous five years for misconduct, subsequently resigned from the NAACP and started his own organization called the Coalition for the Advancement of Civil Rights. Alcorn criticized the NAACP, saying, \"I can't support the leadership of the NAACP. Large amounts of money are being given to them by large corporations that I have a problem with.\" Alcorn also said, \"I cannot be bought. For this reason I gladly offer my resignation and my membership to the NAACP because I cannot work under these constraints.\"\n: Alcorn's remarks were also condemned by the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Jewish groups and George W. Bush's rival Republican presidential campaign. Jackson said he strongly supported Lieberman's addition to the Democratic ticket, saying, \"When we live our faith, we live under the law. He [Lieberman] is a firewall of exemplary behavior.\"\n: Al Sharpton, another prominent African-American leader, said, \"The appointment of Mr. Lieberman was to be welcomed as a positive step.\" The leaders of the American Jewish Congress praised the NAACP for its quick response, stating that: \"It will take more than one bigot like Alcorn to shake the sense of fellowship of American Jews with the NAACP and black America... Our common concerns are too urgent, our history too long, our connection too sturdy, to let anything like this disturb our relationship.\"\n2001\n;2001: During the World Conference against Racism 2001, in Durban, two delegations, the United States and Israel, withdraw from the conference due to their objections to a draft document equating Zionism with racism.\n;2001: Every year since 2001, there has been an annual national memorial to the victims of the Holocaust in the United Kingdom.\n;2001: In Belgium in 2001, Roeland Raes, the ideologue and vice-president of one of the country's largest political parties, the Vlaams Belang (formerly named Vlaams Blok, Flemish Bloc), gave an interview on Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In the same interview he questioned the scale of the Nazis' use of gas chambers and the authenticity of Anne Frank's diary. In response to the media assault following the interview, Raes was forced to resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party. Three years later, the Vlaams Blok was convicted of racism and chose to disband. Immediately afterwards, it legally reformed under the new name Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) with the same leaders and the same membership.\n;2001: Slovakia criminalized denial of fascist crimes in general in late 2001; in May 2005, the term \"Holocaust\" was explicitly adopted by the penal code and in 2009, it became illegal to deny any act regarded by an international criminal court as genocide.\n;2001: Untersturmführer Julius Viel was convicted in 2001 of shooting seven Jewish prisoners from the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1945.\n;2001 May 4: At the 17th meeting of the International Liaison Committee in New York City, Catholic Church officials state that they will change how Judaism is dealt with in Catholic seminaries and schools. In part, they state:\n:The curricula of Catholic seminaries and schools of theology should reflect the central importance of the Church's new understanding of its relationship to Jews....Courses on Bible, developments by which both the Church and rabbinic Judaism emerged from early Judaism will establish a substantial foundation for ameliorating \"the painful ignorance of the history and traditions of Judaism of which only negative aspects and often caricature seem to form part of the stock ideas of many Christians\". (See notes on the Correct Way to Present Jews and Judaism in Catholic Preaching and Catechesis, No. 27, 1985)\n:...Courses dealing with the biblical, historical and theological aspects of relations between Jews and Christians should be an integral part of the seminary and theologate curriculum, and not merely electives. All who graduate from Catholic seminaries and theology schools should have studied the revolution in Catholic teaching on Jews and Judaism from Nostra aetate to the prayer of Pope John Paul II in Jerusalem at the Western Wall on 26 March 2000....For historic reasons, many Jews find it difficult to overcome generational memories of anti-Semitic oppression. Therefore: Lay and Religious Jewish leaders need to advocate and promote a program of education in our Jewish schools and seminaries – about the history of Catholic-Jewish relations and knowledge of Christianity and its relationship to Judaism....Encouragement of dialogue between the two faiths does involve recognition, understanding and respect for each other's beliefs, without having to accept them. It is particularly important that Jewish schools teach about the Second Vatican Council, and subsequent documents and attitudinal changes that opened new perspectives and possibilities for both faiths.\n2002\n;2002: In a letter released in late 2002, Osama bin Laden stated that Jews controlled the civilian media outlets, politics, and economic institutions of the United States.\n;2002: In Romania, Emergency Ordinance No. 31 13 March 2002 prohibits Holocaust denial. It was ratified on 6 May 2006. The law also prohibits racist, fascist, xenophobic symbols, uniforms and gestures: proliferation of which is punishable with imprisonment from between six months to five years.\n;2002 March 11: Arson attack on Anshei Minsk Synagogue in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n;2002 March 30: 2002 Lyon car attack takes place.\n;2002: During the Watergate affair, there were suggestions that Billy Graham had agreed with many of President Richard Nixon's antisemitic opinions, but he denied them and stressed his efforts to build bridges to the Jewish community. In 2002, the controversy was renewed when declassified \"Richard Nixon tapes\" confirmed remarks made by Graham to Nixon three decades earlier. Captured on the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that Jews control the American media, calling it a \"stranglehold\" during a 1972 conversation with Nixon, and suggesting that if Nixon was re-elected, they might be able to do something about it. When the tapes were made public, Graham apologized and said, \"Although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made in an Oval Office conversation with President Nixon ... some 30 years ago. ... They do not reflect my views and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks.\" According to Newsweek magazine, \"[T]he shock of the revelation was magnified because of Graham's longtime support of Israel and his refusal to join in calls for conversion of the Jews.\"\n;2002: On 11 April, Ghriba synagogue bombing takes place in Tunisia.\n;2002: On 4 July 2002, a lone gunman opened fire at the airline ticket counter of El Al, Israel's national airline, at Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California. Two people were killed and four others were injured before the gunman was fatally shot by a security guard after also being wounded by him. This was the 2002 Los Angeles International Airport shooting.\n;2002: Pat Buchanan said\n;2002: In an interview for the magazine Lyon Capitale in January 2002, comedian Dieudonné described \"the Jews\" as \"a sect, a fraud, which is the worst of all, because it was the first\" and said he preferred \"the charisma of bin Laden to that of Bush\".\n;2002: During a 2002 white supremacist terror plot, a pair of white supremacists planned to bomb a series of institutions and people associated with African American and American Jewish communities. Targets included the United States Holocaust Museum, the New England Holocaust Memorial; well-known Jews, including Steven Spielberg; and black leaders, including Rev. Jesse Jackson.\n;2002 May: Bomb detonated at a synagogue in Quebec City.\n;2002: Massive European wave of attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions between March and May, with largest number of attacks occurring in France.\n;2002: In January 2002, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal delivered a ruling in a complaint involving Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel's website, in which it was found to be contravening the Canadian Human Rights Act. The court ordered Zündel to cease communicating hate messages.\n2003\n;2003: Bulgaria officially designates 10 March as Holocaust Remembrance Day and the \"Day of the Salvation of the Bulgarian Jews and of the Victims of the Holocaust and of the Crimes against Humanity\".\n;2003 May 16: 2003 Casablanca bombings target multiple locations, including a Jewish community center.\n;2003: The Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution \"On Anti-Semitism\" stating in part:\n: \"RESOLVED, That the messengers to the Southern Baptist Convention meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, June 17–18, 2003, denounce all forms of anti-Semitism as contrary to the teachings of our Messiah and an assault on the revelation of Holy Scripture; and be it further\n: \"RESOLVED, That we affirm to Jewish people around the world that we stand with them against any harassment that violates our historic commitments to religious liberty and human dignity; and be it finally\n: \"RESOLVED, That we call on governmental and religious leaders across the world to stand against all forms of bigotry, hatred, or persecution.\"\n;2003: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals's \"Holocaust on your Plate\" exhibition consisted of eight  panels, each juxtaposing images of the Holocaust with images of factory-farmed animals. Photographs of concentration camp inmates were displayed next to photographs of battery chickens, and piled bodies of Holocaust victims next to a pile of pig carcasses. Captions alleged that \"like the Jews murdered in concentration camps, animals are terrorized when they are housed in huge filthy warehouses and rounded up for shipment to slaughter. The leather sofa and handbag are the moral equivalent of the lampshades made from the skins of people killed in the death camps.\"\n: The exhibition was funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist, and created by Matt Prescott, who lost several relatives in the Holocaust. Prescott said: \"The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible – that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior' – is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms.\"\n: However, Abraham Foxman, chairman of the Anti-Defamation League, said the exhibition was \"outrageous, offensive and takes chutzpah to new heights ... The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent.\" Stuart Bender, legal counsel for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, wrote to PETA asking them to \"cease and desist this reprehensible misuse of Holocaust materials.\"\n: On 20 February 2009, the German Federal Constitutional Court dismissed a legal move challenging an appeal court's ruling that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws. While not entering formal proceedings to decide in the matter, the court expressed severe doubts as to whether the campaign constituted an offense against human rights in its opinion to dismiss the appeal, as had been found by the orderly courts, but acceded to the other grounds of the former rulings that the campaign constituted a trivialization of the Holocaust and hence a severe violation of living Jews' personality rights. The subtleties of the ruling are sometimes not reflected adequately in press reports.\n;2003: On Yom Ha'atzmaut 2003, a Molotov cocktail was thrown through one of the synagogue Valley Beth Shalom's stained-glass windows.\n;2003 October 16: The Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammed draws a standing ovation at the 57-member Organisation of the Islamic Conference for his speech. An excerpt: \"[Muslims] are actually very strong. 1.3&nbsp;billion people cannot be simply wiped out. The Nazis killed 6&nbsp;million Jews out of 12&nbsp;million. But today the Jews rule this world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them. They invented socialism, communism, human rights and democracy so that persecuting them would appear to be wrong so they may enjoy equal rights with others. With these they have now gained control of the most powerful countries. And they, this tiny community, have become a world power.\"\n;2003 November 16: Neve Shalom Synagogue was hit by one of four car bomb attacks carried out in Istanbul that week (see 2003 Istanbul bombings).\n2004\n;2004: Romania officially denied the Holocaust occurred on its territory up until the Wiesel Commission in 2004.\n;2004: National Holocaust Memorial Day has been recognized in Greece since 2004. (Ethniki Imera Mnimis Olokaftomatos), since 2004.\n;2004: The film The Passion of The Christ was released in 2004. Before the film was even released, there were prominent criticisms of perceived antisemitic content in the film. 20th Century Fox told New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind they had passed on distributing the film in response to a protest outside the News Corporation building. Hikind warned other companies that \"they should not distribute this film. This is unhealthy for Jews all over the world.\"\n: A joint committee of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Inter-religious Affairs of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Department of Inter-religious Affairs of the Anti-Defamation League obtained a version of the script before it was released in theaters. They released a statement, calling it one of the most troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in twenty-five years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest Caiaphas, who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed Pilate into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at Vatican II in its document Nostra aetate, and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents. ... Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, The Passion of the Christ retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last forty years.\n: The ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\nFor filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism. Absent such scholarly and theological understanding, productions such as The Passion could likely falsify history and fuel the animus of those who hate Jews.\n:Rabbi Daniel Lapin, the head of the Toward Tradition organization, criticized this statement, and said of Foxman, the head of the ADL, \"what he is saying is that the only way to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate your faith\".\n: In The Nation, reviewer Katha Pollitt said: \"Gibson has violated just about every precept of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops own 1988 'Criteria' for the portrayal of Jews in dramatizations of the Passion (no bloodthirsty Jews, no rabble, no use of Scripture that reinforces negative stereotypes of Jews, etc.) [...] The priests have big noses and gnarly faces, lumpish bodies, yellow teeth; Herod Antipas and his court are a bizarre collection of oily-haired, epicene perverts. The 'good Jews' look like Italian movie stars (Italian sex symbol Monica Bellucci is Mary Magdalene); Mary, who would have been around 50 and appeared 70, could pass for a ripe 35.\" Jesuit priest Fr. William Fulco, S.J., of Loyola Marymount University—and the film's Hebrew dialogue translator—specifically disagreed with that assessment, and disagreed with concerns that the film accused the Jewish community of deicide.\n: One specific scene in the film perceived as an example of anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states \"[[Blood curse|His blood [is] on us and on our children!]]\", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: \"I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me.\" In an interview with the Detroit Free Press, when asked about the scene, he said, \"It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit that one of the reasons I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said.\"\n: Additionally, the film's suggestion that the Temple's destruction was a direct result of the Jews' actions towards Jesus could also be interpreted as an offensive take on an event which Jewish tradition views as a tragedy, and which is still mourned by many Jews today on the fast day of Tisha B'Av.\n: Asked by Bill O'Reilly if his movie would \"upset Jews\", Gibson responded, \"It's not meant to. I think it's meant to just tell the truth. I want to be as truthful as possible.\" In an interview in The Globe and Mail newspaper, he added: \"If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation. The Papacy has condemned racism in any form. ... Jesus died for the sins of all times, and I'll be the first on the line for culpability\".\n: Conservative columnist Cal Thomas also disagreed with allegations of antisemitism, saying \"To those in the Jewish community who worry that the film [...] might contain anti-Semitic elements, or encourage people to persecute Jews, fear not. The film does not indict Jews for the death of Jesus.\" Two Orthodox Jews, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and conservative talk-show host and author Michael Medved, also vocally rejected claims that the film is anti-Semitic. They have noted the film's many sympathetic portrayals of Jews: Simon of Cyrene (who helps Jesus carry the cross), Mary Magdalene, the Virgin Mary, St. Peter, St. John, Veronica (who wipes Jesus' face and offers him water) and several Jewish priests who protest Jesus' arrest (Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea) during Caiaphas' trial of Jesus.\n: Bob Smithouser of Plugged in Online believed that film was trying to convey the evils and sins of humanity rather than specifically targeting Jews, stating: \"The anthropomorphic portrayal of Satan as a player in these events brilliantly pulls the proceedings into the supernatural realm—a fact that should have quelled the much-publicized cries of anti-Semitism since it shows a diabolical force at work beyond any political and religious agendas of the Jews and Romans.\"\n: Moreover, Senior Vatican officer Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, who has seen the film, addressed the matter so:\nAnti-Semitism, like all forms of racism, distorts the truth in order to put a whole race of people in a bad light. This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the historical objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.\n;2004: The first National Day of Commemorating the Holocaust in Romania was held in 2004.\n;2004 April 4: United Talmud Torah school library is firebombed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n;2004 May: Jewish organizations and leaders protest Estonia's erection of a statue commemorating Alfons Rebane, an Estonian SS volunteer accused of serving as \"a Nazi executioner\" who was \"responsible for the slaughter of thousands of Jews and Russians between 1941 and 1945.\"\n;2004 June: A series of attacks on Jewish cemeteries in Wellington, New Zealand.\n;2004 September: The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, a part of the Council of Europe, called on its member nations to \"ensure that criminal law in the field of combating racism covers anti-Semitism\" and to penalize intentional acts of public incitement to violence, hatred or discrimination, public insults and defamation, threats against a person or group, and the expression of antisemitic ideologies. It urged member nations to \"prosecute people who deny, trivialize or justify the Holocaust\". The report was drawn up in wake of a rise in attacks on Jews in Europe. The report said it was Europe's \"duty to remember the past by remaining vigilant and actively opposing any manifestations of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and intolerance... Anti-Semitism is not a phenomenon of the past and... the slogan 'never again' is as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.\" ([https://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1095650548542] )\n2005\n;2005: The European Union has recognized International Holocaust Remembrance Day since 2005.\n;2005: In 2005 the United States had a \"moment of silence\" on the 60th anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany.\n;2005: Dieudonné stated during a press conference in Algiers that the Central Council of French Jews CRIF (Conseil représentatif des institutions juives de France) was a \"mafia\" that had \"total control over French policy exercise\", called the commemoration of the Holocaust \"memorial pornography\" (\"pornographie mémorielle\"), and claimed that the \"Zionists of the Centre National de la Cinématographie,\" which \"control French cinema\" prevented him from making a film about the slave trade. Dieudonné was also trying to appear as a spokesman for French blacks, but, after some initial sympathy, notably from the novelist Calixthe Beyala, the journalists Antoine Garnier and Claudy Siar, as well as the founding members of the Conseil représentatif des associations noires (CRAN), he increasingly met with their rejection.\n;2005: In 2005 the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader, Mohammed Mahdi Akef, denounced what he called \"the myth of the Holocaust\" in defending Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's denial of the Holocaust.\n;2005 September: Throughout the Polish election Radio Maryja continued to promote antisemitic views, including denial of the facts of the Jedwabne pogrom in 1941. Their support of right-wing conservative Law and Justice party is considered a major factor in their electoral victory.\n;2005: A group of 15 members of the State Duma of Russia demands that Judaism and Jewish organizations be banned from the country. In June, 500 prominent Russians demand that the state prosecutor investigate ancient Jewish texts as \"anti-Russian\" and ban Judaism. The investigation was launched, but halted among international outcry.\n;2005: The 2005 Los Angeles bomb plot was a 2005 effort by a group of ex-convicts calling themselves  Jamiyyat Ul-Islam Is-Saheeh to bomb several military bases, a number of synagogues, and an Israeli consulate in California.\n: On 31 August 2005, Kevin James and three other men were indicted on terrorism charges related to conspiracy to attack military facilities in the Los Angeles area and of attempting to fund their campaign by robbing gas stations in Southern California over the previous three months. Kevin James, a Muslim convert, was accused of founding a radical Islamic group called J.I.S (Jam’iyyat Ul-Islam Is-Saheehجمعية الإسلام الصحيح, Arabic for \"Assembly of Authentic Islam\") from his cell in Folsom Prison in California, and of recruiting fellow inmates to join his mission to kill infidels.\n;2005: Prince Harry was photographed at Highgrove House at a \"Colonial and Native\" themed costume party wearing a Nazi German Afrika Korps uniform with a swastika armband. He later issued a public statement apologising for his behavior.\n;2005: International Holocaust Remembrance Day was designated by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 60/7 on 1 November 2005 during the 42nd plenary session.\n;2005 December: Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad widens the hostility between Iran and Israel by denying the Holocaust during a speech in the Iranian city of Zahedan. He made the following comments on live television: \"They have invented a myth that Jews were massacred and place this above God, religions and the prophets.\" Continuing, he suggested that if the Holocaust had occurred, that it was the responsibility of Europeans to offer up territory to Jews: \"This is our proposal: give a part of your own land in Europe, the United States, Canada or Alaska to them [the Jews] so that the Jews can establish their country.\" See Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Israel\n2006\n;2006, 11 January: Alexandr Koptsev stabbed nine people at Bolshaya Bronnaya Synagogue.\n;2006: On 11 December 2006, the Iranian state-sponsored \"International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust\" opened to widespread condemnation. The conference, called for by and held at the behest of Ahmadinejad, was widely described as a \"Holocaust denial conference\" or a \"meeting of Holocaust deniers\", though Iran denied it was a Holocaust denial conference. A few months before it opened, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi stated: \"The Holocaust is not a sacred issue that one can't touch. I have visited the Nazi camps in Eastern Europe. I think it is exaggerated.\"\n;2006: John Gudenus received a one-year suspended sentence for breaking the Verbotsgesetz, Austria's laws against denying or diminishing the Holocaust. Gudenus had suggested that it was necessary to verify the existence of gas chambers in Nazi Germany and later remarked that there had been gas chambers in Poland but not in Germany.\n;2006: In 2006, Mel Gibson was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) while speeding in his vehicle with an open container of alcohol, which is illegal in much of the United States. According to the arrest report, Gibson exploded into an angry tirade when the arresting officer would not allow him to drive home. Gibson climaxed with the words, \"Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?\"\n;2006: In 2006, sixty of Arthur Butz's colleagues from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science faculty signed a censure describing Butz's Holocaust denial as \"an affront to our humanity and our standards as scholars\". The letter also called for Butz to \"leave our Department and our University and stop trading on our reputation for academic excellence\".\n;2006: The Netherlands rejected a draft law proposing a maximum sentence of one year on denial of genocidal acts in general, although specifically denying the Holocaust remains a criminal offense there.\n;2006: Dieudonné was sentenced to a penalty of €4,500 for defamation after having called a prominent Jewish television presenter a \"secret donor of the child-murdering Israeli army\".\n;2006 February: A French Jew, Ilan Halimi is kidnapped and tortured to death for 23 days in what Paris police have officially declared an antisemitic act. The event causes international outcry.

Although he pleaded guilty to the charge, Irving said he had been \"mistaken\", and had changed his opinions on the Holocaust. \"I said that then, based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991 when I came across the Eichmann papers, I wasn't saying that anymore and I wouldn't say that now.

Following this, on 6 May 2009 Bosniak MPs Adem Huskic, Ekrem Ajanovic and Remzija Kadric proposed to the BH parliament a change to the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina where Holocaust, genocide and crimes against humanity denial would be criminalized.

Jewish reactions to the motu proprio underlined their concern that the traditional formulation of the Good Friday prayer for the Jews, which Jews felt offensive, would be more broadly used.In the form in which they appear in the 1962 Missal, the set of prayers in which that of the Jews is included are for: the Holy Church, the Supreme Pontiff; all orders and grades of the faithful (clergy and laity); public officials (added in 1955, replacing an older prayer for the Holy Roman Emperor, not used since the abdication of Francis II in 1806 but still printed in the Roman Missal); catechumens; the needs of the faithful; heretics and schismatics; the conversion of the Jews (without the word \"perfidis\"); the conversion of pagans.In later editions of the Missal, the prayers are for: the Church; the Pope, the clergy and laity of the Church; those preparing for baptism; the unity of Christians, the Jewish people; those who do not believe in Christ; those who do not believe in God; all in public office; those in special need.\n;2007 August/September: The Jewish state, Israel, is shocked to find a neo-Nazi group of immigrants (from Russia) called Patrol 36 committing vandalism and voicing anti-Semitic rhetoric within its borders.

The award was presented by one of Dieudonné's assistants, Jacky, dressed in a concentration camp uniform with a yellow badge. This caused a scandal and earned him his sixth court conviction to date.\n;2008: The universal permission given to priests by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 to celebrate (privately and, under certain conditions, even publicly) the Tridentine Mass as printed in the 1962 Roman Missal was followed by complaints from Jewish groups and some Catholic leaders over what they perceived as a return to a supersessionist theology that they saw expressed in the 1960 Good Friday prayer for the Jews. In response to the complaints, Pope Benedict amended the Good Friday prayer. On 6 February 2008, the Vatican newspaper, ''L'Osservatore Romano, published a note of the Secretariat of State announcing that Pope Benedict XVI had amended the Good Friday prayer for the Jews contained in the 1962 Roman Missal, and decreeing that the amended text \"be used, beginning from the current year, in all celebrations of the Liturgy of Good Friday according to the aforementioned Missale Romanum\".\n: The new prayer reads as follows:\n:Let us also pray for the Jews: That our God and Lord may illuminate their hearts, that they acknowledge Jesus Christ is the Savior of all men. (Let us pray. Kneel. Rise.) Almighty and eternal God, who want that all men be saved and come to the recognition of the truth, propitiously grant that even as the fullness of the peoples enters Thy Church, all Israel be saved. Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.\n: Even the new formulation met with reservations from groups such as the Anti-Defamation League. They considered the removal of \"blindness\" and \"immersion in darkness\" with respect to the Jews an improvement over the original language in the Tridentine Mass, but saw no reason why the prayer in the rite as revised by Paul VI was not used instead.\n;2008 26–29 November: Mumbai, India: Nariman House, a Chabad Lubavitch Jewish centre in Colaba known as the Mumbai Chabad House, was taken over by two Pakistani terrorists and several residents were held hostage. The house was stormed by NSG commandos and, after a long battle, the two attackers were killed.

Based upon these statements, the Bishop was immediately charged with and convicted of Holocaust denial by a German court. The Holy See declared that Pope Benedict had been unaware of Williamson's views when he lifted the excommunication of four bishops including him, and that Williamson would remain suspended from his episcopal functions until he unequivocally and publicly distanced himself from his position on the Holocaust. In 2010 Williamson was convicted of incitement in a German court in relation to those views; the conviction was later vacated on appeal but then reinstated on retrial in early 2013.

These two statements of mine are irrefutable truths\". In the article, Myers criticises the 6-million figure – though he says \"millions of Jews were murdered\" – and criticises the term holocaust because \"[m]ost Jewish victims of the Third Reich were not burnt in the ovens in Auschwitz. They were shot by the hundreds of thousands in the Lebensraum of the east, or were worked or starved to death in a hundred other camps, across the Reich.\" Overall, he states: \"I'm a holocaust denier; but I also believe that the Nazis planned the extermination of the Jewish people, as far as their evil hands could reach.\"\n;2009: Tapes were released in which Billy Graham is heard in a 1973 conversation with Richard Nixon referring to Jews and \"the synagogue of Satan\".

He had a female accomplice, speculated to be his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene.

The police ended the siege by storming the store and killing Coulibaly.\n;2015: On 10 January 2015, following the Charlie Hebdo shooting, the Porte de Vincennes siege of a kosher supermarket, and the 1,500,000-strong \"march against hatred\" in Paris, Dieudonné wrote on Facebook \"As far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly.\" In this way he mixed the popular slogan \"Je suis Charlie\", used to support the journalists killed at the Charlie Hebdo magazine, with a reference to Amedy Coulibaly who was responsible for the hostage-taking at the kosher supermarket which included the killing of four Jews. On 13 January, Dieudonné was arrested in Paris, accused of publicly supporting terrorism, based on his earlier Facebook comments where he appeared to support the kosher supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly.

To judge him or his comedy based on a handful of jokes is unfair. Trevor is a talented comedian with a bright future at Comedy Central.\" Mary Kluk, chairperson of the South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD), said that the jokes were not signs of anti-Jewish prejudice and that they were part of Noah's style of comedy.\n;2015: In March 2015, Louis Farrakhan accused Jews of involvement in the September 11 attacks.\n;2015: In June 2015 Laurent Louis got a suspended 6-month sentence for breaking the 1995 Belgian law against Holocaust denial and lost his right to run for office in the next six years.

Shah also commented on the post, suggesting the plan might \"save them some pocket money\". In July 2014, she wrote on Facebook about a newspaper poll concerning alleged Israeli war crimes in the Gaza conflict that \"The Jews are rallying to the poll\" and in September appeared to compare Israeli policies to those of Adolf Hitler. Shah asserted that her views on Israel had moderated in the 20 months since the post and on 26 April 2016 she resigned from her unpaid post as John McDonnell's PPS while still holding her seat on the Home Affairs Select Committee investigating the rise of antisemitism in the UK. She was suspended by the Labour Party on 27 April 2016, forfeiting all roles.\n;2016: In April 2016, Ken Livingstone commented publicly on the suspension of Labour MP Naz Shah; she had been removed from the party after it was revealed that she had made comments on Facebook suggesting that Israeli Jews should be relocated to the United States. Livingstone stated that Shah's postings, which were made before she became an MP at the 2015 general election, were \"completely over the top\" and \"rude\", although he did not deem them antisemitic. He asserted that there is a \"well-orchestrated campaign by the Israel lobby to smear anybody who criticises Israeli policy as antisemitic\", and also stated that Adolf Hitler \"was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews\".\n:He defended his claims by reference to Lenni Brenner's Zionism in the Age of the Dictators, and many commentators suggested that Livingstone was referring to the Haavara Agreement between Nazi Germany and the Zionist Federation of Germany. Livingstone's statements were criticised by historians, among them Roger Moorhouse, who said that they were historically inaccurate. He also became involved in a public argument on the subject with the Labour MP John Mann.\n:Livingstone was subsequently suspended from Labour Party membership \"for bringing the party into disrepute\". Over 20 Labour MPs called for Livingstone's suspension, while Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn Momentum group, called for Livingstone to leave politics altogether, and Khan called for his expulsion from the party. In a subsequent interview, Livingstone expressed regret both for mentioning Hitler and for offending Jews but added that \"I'm not going to apologise for telling the truth.\" Corbyn announced that the decision to expel Livingstone would be made by a National Executive Committee internal inquiry, while Livingstone insisted that he would be exonerated on the basis of Brenner's book, saying \"how can the truth be an offence?\" Following this controversy, Livingstone has questioned whether or not he has Jewish ancestry on his mother's side stating that Greville Janner used to speculate whether or not he was Jewish because \"my grandmother's name was Zona.\"\n:Livingstone was sacked in Spring 2016 by LBC.

This appointment drew opposition from the Anti-Defamation League, the Council on American–Islamic Relations, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Democrat Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, and some Republican strategists, because of statements in Breitbart News that were alleged to be racist or anti-Semitic. Ben Shapiro, Bernard Marcus of the Republican Jewish Coalition, Morton Klein and the Zionist Organization of America, Pamela Geller, Shmuley Boteach, and David Horowitz defended Bannon against the allegations of antisemitism. Alan Dershowitz first defended Bannon and said there was no evidence he was anti-semitic, but in a later piece stated that Bannon and Breitbart had made bigoted statements against Muslims, women, and others. The ADL said \"we are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements from Bannon\", while adding \"under his stewardship, Breitbart has emerged as the leading source for the extreme views of a vocal minority who peddle bigotry and promote hate.\"\n;2016: In December 2016, the neo-Nazi and white supremacist website The Daily Stormer published a list of six local Jews in Whitefish, Montana along with their personal information, claiming that they were harming the business of Richard Spencer's mother and asking readers to \"take action\" against them. Whitefish police increased local patrols, and monitored Internet activity; Montana politicians and community groups responded with various efforts to focus attention on the question of antisemitism. On 28 Dec. 2016, Spencer indicated that he did not want to bring ongoing national attention to Whitefish with his political views, and an offer was made to call off a proposed armed march against Jews, Jewish businesses and people who support either in the town. The march was postponed because the proper permitting materials were not submitted and the required fee was not paid.\n2017\n;2017: The court of appeal of Liège confirmed a first instance sentence of two months of jail time and a 9.000 euros fine for Dieudonné's anti-Semitic remarks in a performance on Herstal on 14 March 2012.\n;2017: In 2017, Alice Walker published a poem on her blog entitled \"It Is Our (Frightful) Duty to Study the Talmud\", recommending that the reader should start with YouTube to learn about the evils of the Talmud.\n;2017: With the beginning of the year, a wave of threats, including bomb threats, were made against Jewish Community Centers and other Jewish institutions in the United States. Juan M. Thompson, an African American former journalist for The Intercept, was arrested and charged with making at least eight of the hoax threats, as well as a threat made against the Anti-Defamation League, while allegedly impersonating a former girlfriend. Another suspect, an unidentified 19-year-old Israeli-American man, was arrested in Ashkelon, Israel and charged with responsibility for \"dozens\" of the threats.\n;2017: Murder of Sarah Halimi in Paris on 4 April 2017. The murderer was Kobili Traoré, a Muslim migrant from Mali who cryed \"Allahu Abkar\" during the attack, who was found not responsible for his actions due to a \"psychotic episode\".\n;2017: Sebastian Gorka appeared on Fox News on the evening of the U.S. presidential inauguration wearing a badge, tunic, and ring associated with Order of Vitéz. According to some sources, Gorka was a member of the Order of Vitéz by inheritance, a group the US State Department lists as a Nazi-linked group. This has given rise to claims that Gorka himself carries sympathy for the Nazis. His father, Paul Gorka, was never a member of this Order and received a \"Vitéz\" (literally: \"Valiant\") medal from Hungarian exiles \"for his resistance to dictatorship\" in 1979. Gorka himself stated that he wears this medal in remembrance of his father, who was awarded the decoration for his efforts to create an anti-Communist, pro-democracy organization at the university he attended in Hungary. Robert Kerepeszki, Hungarian expert of the Order of Vitéz, has confirmed that there were ruptures in the organization of the Order of Vitéz on the question of Nazism during the war, many of them died fighting against Hungarian Nazis, and Gorka's medal had nothing to do with the war period, but was awarded \"for his resistance to dictatorship.\"\n;2017: Leaders of one of two successor organisations of the Vitézi Rend stated that Sebastian Gorka was an official member of the Historical Vitézi Rend faction, to which he is said to have taken a lifelong oath of loyalty. Gorka denied the allegations. The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, the National Jewish Democratic Council, and the Interfaith Alliance have called for Gorka's resignation over his ties to Hungarian far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League has asked Gorka to disavow the Hungarian far-right groups that he has been associated with. Democratic Senators Ben Cardin, Dick Durbin and Richard Blumenthal sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security requesting that the DHS look into whether Gorka \"illegally procured his citizenship\" by omitting membership in Historical Vitézi Rend, which could have been grounds for keeping him out of the country.\n;2017: Chicago Dyke March organizers singled out and approached a group of women carrying Jewish pride flags and began questioning them on their political stance in regards to Zionism and Israel, and then after a discussion asked them to leave the event, insisting that their presence \"made people feel unsafe\". The organizers attributed the responses of the women and the white star of David, featured at the center of the rainbow flag as a \"zionist expression\". This prompted widespread accusations of antisemitism.\n;2017: In the early morning hours of 28 June 2017, one of the  glass panels on the New England Holocaust Memorial was smashed with a rock.\n;2017: In Ukraine, some men vandalized the Space of Synagogues [Holocaust] memorial display; they wrote neo-Nazi slogans and the English words \"white power\", and drew a swastika and ultranationalist Ukrainian symbols.\n;2017: Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary, made a speech in which he called Miklós Horthy an \"exceptional statesman\" and gave him the credit for the survival of Hungary. The U.S. Holocaust Museum then issued a statement denouncing Orbán and the Hungarian government for trying to \"rehabilitate the reputation of Hungary's wartime leader, Miklos Horthy, who was a vocal anti-Semite and complicit in the murder of the country's Jewish population during the Holocaust.\"\n;2017: The BBC removed a line from one of its online articles which had offended Jews and Muslims; the line had stated, \"The Holocaust is a sensitive topic for many Muslims because Jewish survivors settled in British-mandate Palestine, on land which later became the state of Israel.\"\n;2017: Antisemitic fliers were circulated around Lakewood, New Jersey.\n;2017: An antisemitic banner was found in front of a Holocaust memorial at a synagogue in Lakewood, New Jersey.\n;2017: Fliers were found around Little Italy saying among other things, \"We are killing off the entire white race by making them addicted to cocaine, crack, meth, spiked marijuana, ecstasy, spice, heroine, hash and other poisons, Adolph Hilter's [sic] Nazi's [sic] killed off six million ugly Jews by telling them to go into showers to get cleaned up for their new lives, then they locked the shower doors and poisoned them all to death with a deadly gas, and finally they grabbed all of the dead Jew's properties.\"\n;2017: The chairpersons of Chicago SlutWalk wrote, \"We still stand behind Dyke March Chicago's decision to remove the Zionist contingent from their event, & we won't allow Zionist displays at ours\", referring to a then-upcoming demonstration of theirs. The Chicago SlutWalk's organizers made the following declaration about the Star of David, \"its connections to the oppression enacted by Israel is too strong for it to be neutral & IN CONTEXT [at the Dyke March Chicago event] it was used as a Zionist symbol.\"\n;2017: A resolution was passed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors against \"verbal and violent anti-Semitic assaults, both nationally and in the Bay Area\"; the resolution also contained a promise to \"stand in solidarity with Jewish and other communities whenever they are targeted or marginalized.\"\n;2017: A Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri was vandalized in an apparent anti-Semitic incident in February 2017, after which Linda Sarsour worked with other Muslim activists to launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to repair the damage and restore the gravesites. More than $125,000 was raised, and Sarsour pledged to donate any funds not needed at the cemetery to other Jewish community centers or sites targeted by vandalism. She said the fundraising effort would \"send a united message from the Jewish and Muslim communities that there is no place for this type of hate, desecration, and violence in America\". St. Louis's United Hebrew Congregation Senior Rabbi, Brigitte S. Rosenberg, whose congregants had family members buried in the vandalized cemetery, called the campaign \"a beautiful gesture\". However, the project generated some controversy as the funds were not distributed as quickly as some had expected. In 2018, Alzado Harris confessed to the desecration.\n;2017: Imam Sheikh Ammar Shahin gave an anti-semitic sermon at the Islamic Center of Davis, but apologized for it a few days later.\n;2017: At the end of July 2017, Kevin Myers contributed an article entitled \"Sorry, ladies – equal pay has to be earned\" to the Irish edition of The Sunday Times about the lower income of female presenters working for the BBC, after it was reported that two-thirds of the BBC's top paid stars were men and only one of its top ten best paid presenters is a woman. He speculated: \"Is it because men are more charismatic performers? Because they work harder? Because they are more driven? Possibly a bit of each\" and that men might be paid more because they \"work harder, get sick less frequently and seldom get pregnant\". Myers further alleged that Claudia Winkleman and Vanessa Feltz are higher paid than other female presenters because they are Jewish. He wrote: \"Jews are not generally noted for their insistence on selling their talent for the lowest possible price, which is the most useful measure there is of inveterate, lost-with-all-hands stupidity\". The editor of the Irish edition, Frank Fitzgibbon, issued a statement saying in part \"This newspaper abhors anti-Semitism and did not intend to cause offence to Jewish people\". Martin Ivens, editor of The Sunday Times, said the article should not have been published. Ivens and Fitzgibbon apologised for publishing it. After complaints from readers and the Campaign Against Antisemitism, the article was removed from the website. It has been announced by the newspaper that Myers will not write for The Sunday Times again. Myers was defended by the chair of the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland, Maurice Cohen, who said that Myers was not antisemitic, but had rather \"inadvertently stumbled into an antisemitic trope. ... Branding Kevin Myers as either an antisemite or a Holocaust denier is an absolute distortion of the facts.\" Myers apologised for this article on radio, saying that \"it is over for me professionally as far as I can see\", and that \"I think they [Jewish people] are the most gifted people who have ever existed on this planet and civilisation owes an enormous debt to them – I am very, very sorry that I should have so offended them.\"\n;2017: The Unite the Right rally was a gathering of far-right groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States, on 11 and 12 August 2017. On the evening of Friday, 11 August, a group of white nationalists—variously numbered at dozens, around 100, and hundreds—marched through the University of Virginia's campus while chanting things including \"Jews will not replace us\", and the Nazi slogan \"Blood and Soil\". On 12 August protesters and counterprotesters gathered at Emancipation Park (formerly known as Lee Park). White nationalist protesters chanted Nazi-era slogans, including \"Blood and Soil\". They shouted among other things, \"Jews will not replace us.\" Some held posters targeting Jews that read \"the Goyim know\", using the Hebrew word for non-Jews, as well as \"the Jewish media is going down\". Also on 12 August, an attendee drove his car into a crowd of people protesting the rally, killing 32-year-old Heather D. Heyer and injuring 19 others, in what police have called a deliberate attack. The driver was identified as James Alex Fields Jr.; following the crash, his former high school history teacher said he was a Nazi sympathizer who held white supremacist views and was infatuated with Adolf Hitler. Two hours before the crash, a New York Daily News photographer snapped James brandishing a wooden shield emblazoned with the logo for neo-Nazi group Vanguard America, standing alongside its members. However, after he was arrested, the group issued a statement denying he was a member and saying \"the shields were freely handed out to anyone in attendance.\"\n;2017: Several internet companies, such as domain registrar GoDaddy and video game chat application Discord, shut down services for neo-Nazi, white supremacist, alt-right website The Daily Stormer for violation of terms of service, and in response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia (see above item).\n;2017: On 14 August 2017, the New England Holocaust Memorial was damaged for the second time in as many months, by a 17-year-old who threw a rock at one of the glass panels.\n;2017: Two classroom windows at Temple Israel in Alameda were smashed.\n;2017: Ruth Thomann, the manager of the Paradies Arosa hotel in Switzerland, stated that it was wrong of her to post signs telling \"Jewish guests\" to shower before entering the pool and to use the refrigerator at set times, which she had done that year.\n;2017: Extremists marked the death of Adolf Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess, in Berlin.

Bazian apologized and said \"the image is offensive and does not represent my views or the anti-racist work that I do.\" The cartoons were first tweeted by Ron Hughes and later retweeted by Bazian.\n;2017: When Linda Sarsour was scheduled to deliver a commencement speech at the City University of New York (CUNY) in June 2017, some American conservatives strongly opposed her selection as speaker. Dov Hikind, a Democratic Party state assemblyman in New York, sent Governor Andrew Cuomo a letter objecting to the choice of Sarsour as speaker, signed by 100 Holocaust survivors. Hikind objected to Sarsour's role based on her previously having spoken alongside Rasmea Odeh, who was convicted by an Israeli court for taking part in a bombing that killed two civilians in 1969. Sarsour maintained that she had nothing to apologize for, saying that questions existed about the integrity of Odeh's conviction, that her beliefs had been misrepresented, and that criticism of Israeli policies was being conflated with anti-Semitism. She ascribed the critical reaction to her speech to her prominent role as an organizer for the 2017 Women's March. The university chancellor, the dean of the college, and a group of professors defended her right to speak, as did some Jewish groups, including Jews for Racial and Economic Justice. A group of prominent left-leaning Jews signed an open letter condemning attacks on Sarsour and promising \"to [work] alongside her for a more just and equal society\". Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League defended Sarsour's First Amendment right to speak despite opposing her views on Israel. A rally in support of Sarsour took place in front of New York's City Hall. Constitutional scholar Fred Smith Jr. tied the controversy to broader disputes over freedom of speech in America.\n;2017: Academy of the Holy Cross in Maryland fired Greg Conte because of his involvement with a white nationalist think tank, Richard Spencer's National Policy Institute.

In his post, he stated, \"Y'all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation ... And that's a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful.\" The comment was widely reported in the Washington media as an endorsement of an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. The Washington City Paper reported on 19 March that this was not the first time White alluded to a Jewish conspiracy to control global weather. White later apologized for making the statement, and said he was working with Jews United for Justice to develop a deeper understanding of anti-semitism.\n;2018: Austrian foreign minister Karin Kneissl recalled diplomat Jürgen-Michael Kleppich from Israel after he was photographed wearing a T-shirt with slogans linked to Nazism.\n:2018 April 17: 2018 Berlin anti-semitic attack takes place.\n;2018: In April 2018, Syracuse University permanently expelled Theta Tau after video of members surfaced that the university chancellor considered to be \"extremely racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist and hostile to people with disabilities.\"\n;2018: Alice Walker was asked by a New York Times interviewer, \"What books are on your nightstand?\" She listed David Icke's And the Truth Shall Set You Free, a book promoting an antisemitic conspiracy theory based on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

The Daily Beast traced the controversy to February 2018, when Tamika Mallory attended a Nation of Islam Saviours' Day event hosted by Farrakhan, during which he referred to the \"Satanic Jew\" and declared that \"the powerful Jews are my enemy\". The Daily Beast later reported that the Women's March appeared to be losing support. In October 2018, actress Alyssa Milano, who spoke at the 2018 Women's March, told The Advocate that she refused to participate in the 2019 March unless Mallory and Linda Sarsour condemned what have been described as homophobic, antisemitic, and transphobic comments by Farrakhan. The Women's March released a statement about anti-Semitism, defending Sarsour and Mallory. In November 2018, Teresa Shook, the co-founder of the Women's March, called for march organizers Bob Bland, Mallory, Sarsour and Carmen Perez to resign, saying, \"they have allowed anti-Semitism, anti-LBGTQIA sentiment and hateful, racist rhetoric to become a part of the platform by their refusal to separate themselves from groups that espouse these racist, hateful beliefs\". The organization's leadership rebuffed calls to step down; Sarsour's initial response alleged that criticisms were motivated by racism and her opposition to Israel. Sarsour later issued a statement that apologized to the march's supporters for its \"slow response\" and condemned anti-semitism. In December 2018, Tablet published an article by Leah McSweeney and Jacob Siegel alleging that during the first meeting between Bland, Mallory, Perez, and others in the days after the 2016 US Presidential election, Mallory and Perez repeated an anti-Semitic canard promoted in Farrakhan's book The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews telling fellow organizer Vanessa Wruble, who is Jewish, that Jews were leaders in the American slave trade and are especially responsible for subsequent exploitation of racial minorities. Wruble suggested that Mallory and Perez had berated her for her Jewish heritage, saying \"your people hold all the wealth.\" Mallory denied Wruble's account but acknowledged telling \"white women\" at the meeting, including Wruble, that she \"did not trust them.\"\n;2018: The Echo Music Prize was heavily criticized worldwide when Farid Bang and Kollegah received the award for best hip hop/urban album in April 2018. The nominated album, Jung, brutal, gutaussehend 3 (English: \"Young, brutal, handsome 3\"), contains the track \"0815\", in which the artists refer to their muscles as being more defined than those of Auschwitz inmates. The duo was even allowed to perform this track during the ceremony, despite heavy protests weeks before the award show. This was much criticized, and as a consequence, the Echo Music Prize was discontinued.\n;2018: An Israeli man wearing a yarmulke was attacked in Berlin; the attacker allegedly beat him with a belt and shouted, \"Yehudi\" — the Arabic word for Jew.

In response to this, thousands of Germans took part in rallies against antisemitism, many of them wearing yarmulkes.\n;2018: On 25 February 2018, Tamika Mallory attended an anti-Semitic Louis Farrakhan speech, where she was directly acknowledged by Farrakhan. Farrakhan made multiple inflammatory comments during his three-hour speech. He claimed that \"the powerful Jews are my enemy\", that \"the Jews have control over agencies of those agencies of government\" like the FBI, that Jews are \"the mother and father of apartheid\", and that Jews are responsible for \"degenerate behavior in Hollywood turning men into women and women into men\".

The Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) which had made social media postings during the conference and sent a delegate, was criticized by French education minister Frédérique Vidal, who said the disturbances were \"highly regrettable\" and \"anti-Semitic\". Vidal further stated the disturbances organized by Gazeta Polska activists, appeared to have been condoned by the IPN whose representative did not condemn the disruption and which criticized the conference on social media that were further re-tweeted by the Embassy of Poland, Paris. Agitators stalked conference speakers in Paris, shouting insults such as \"dirty Jew\" that hark back to interwar antisemitism.\n;2019: Ian Austin quit Labour over a \"culture of extremism, anti-semitism and intolerance\" within the party under Jeremy Corbyn.\n;2019: Chris Williamson, a Labour MP, was suspended by his party over comments that Labour had \"given too much ground\" when responding to criticism over its handling of antisemitism within its ranks.\n;2019: A subway poster in Brooklyn with a picture of Ruth Bader Ginsburg (who was Jewish) was vandalized with the writing \"Die, Jew Bitch!\" and a swastika.\n;2019: The uptick in violence against Jews in Brooklyn continues with multiple violent attacks.\n;2019: The owners of the BerMax Caffé in Winnipeg are alleged to have perpetrated an act of fake antisemitism by vandalizing their café and fabricating a claim of assault, in similar fashion to the recent Jussie Smollett case in Chicago.\n;2019, 4 April: Bet Israel Synagogue of İzmir, Turkey is attacked with a Molotov cocktail.\n;2019: The synagogue Chabad, of the city of Poway in California, was the site of an attack on 27 April 2019, in which multiple people were shot during Passover services.

The White House initially indicated that the order would define Judaism as a nationality instead of a religion in the United States, though the order ultimately released was more modest in its reach. The purpose of the order is claimed to be to prevent antisemitism by making it easier to use laws prohibiting institutional discrimination against people based on national origin to punish discrimination against Jewish people, including opposition to policies undertaken by the government of Israel. Some American Jews applauded the order, while others objected to defining Judaism as a nationality (as the order was initially indicated to do, though it ultimately did not), claiming that \"Trump's reclassification of Judaism mirrored sentiments used by white nationalists and Nazi Germany\" and that \"the move appears to question whether Jews are really American\". Some decried the order as a political stunt, and called on Trump to more directly address the threat of white nationalism.\n;2019: Monsey Hanukkah stabbing.
