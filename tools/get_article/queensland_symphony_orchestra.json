The orchestra is based in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's building in South Bank. The Orchestra is funded by private corporations, the state government and the Australian federal government through the Australia Council.\nHistory\nQueensland Symphony Orchestra played its first concert on 26 March 1947, consisting of 45 musicians, conducted by Percy Code. John Farnsworth Hall was recruited from the Sydney Symphony Orchestra as the Orchestra's first Chief Conductor. The Orchestra played concerts in various Queensland cities and towns, such as Innisfail and Townsville, travelling up to 3500 miles a year in the process.\nDuring the first part of its history, the QSO's longest-serving Chief Conductor was Rudolf Pekárek (1954–1967). In 1988, Vladimir Kamirski was appointed Chief Guest Conductor. Muhai Tang was Chief Conductor from 1991 to 2001.\nIn 2001, QSO was merged with Queensland Philharmonic Orchestra, to form The Queensland Orchestra (TQO). Michael Christie was the first Chief Conductor of the Orchestra under its new name, from 2001 to 2004. In July 2007, Johannes Fritzsch was named the next Chief Conductor of TQO, beginning in January 2008, with an initial contract through 2010. On 14 October 2009, the orchestra announced its intention to revert to its former name of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, effective in 2010. In February 2010, the orchestra announced a three-year extension of Fritzsch's contract as Chief Conductor, through 2013. Fritzsch stood down as QSO chief conductor at the end of 2014, and subsequently took the title of Conductor Laureate of Queensland Symphony Orchestra.\nIn May 2015, Alondra de la Parra made her first guest-conducting appearance with the Orchestra. In October 2015, the orchestra announced the appointment of de la Parra as its first-ever music director and first-ever female conductor in its principal conducting post, effective in 2017. De la Parra completed her tenure as music director at the end of the 2019 season. In February 2021, the QSO announced the return of Fritzsch to the orchestra as its new principal conductor and artistic adviser, with a contract until 2023.\nIn 2021, Umberto Clerici made three guest-conducting appearances with the QSO. In May 2022, the QSO announced the appointment of Clerici as its next chief conductor, effective 1&nbsp;January 2023, with an initial contract of three years.
