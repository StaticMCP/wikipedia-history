The show was produced by Steve Vizard, who was also the executive producer, writer, and performer. It starred Jane Turner, Gina Riley, Magda Szubanski, Marg Downey, Michael Veitch, and many others, along with numerous guests and supporting stars.\nFast Forward was succeeded by the related series Full Frontal, and subsequently Totally Full Frontal, which were broadcast from 1993 to 1999.\nBackground\nMany of the stars came from a 1985 Seven Network sketch-comedy pilot called The Eleventh Hour, which also spawned The Comedy Company, via The D-Generation. Fast Forward'' was commissioned by Seven in late 1988. It was produced by Vizard's production company, United Film Completion, and broadcast on Seven Network. The several working titles for the show include Snapped Cable Television, as well as Fast Forward.\nProduction and main cast\nThe show was produced by Steve Vizard, who was also the executive producer, writer, and performer, and starred Jane Turner, Gina Riley, Magda Szubanski (the three of whom went on to star in Kath & Kim), Marg Downey, Michael Veitch, Peter Moon, Alan Pentland, Steve Blackburn, Geoff Brooks, Ernie Dingo, the Rubbery Figures satirical puppets, and numerous guests and supporting stars, such as Gerry Connolly and Bryan Dawe.\nFast Forward was directed by Ted Emery. From its second series onward, Andrew Knight joined Steve Vizard and Ted Emery as executive producers of the show. They went on to establish the leading Australian production house, Artist Services.\nStyle\nFast Forward was noted for its fast-paced, satirical comedy, which particularly lampooned the media, in particular film and TV, with its parodies of well-known television shows (such as Kung Fu, Lost In Space, The Munsters, and A Current Affair), personalities (such as Clive James, Jana Wendt, Derryn Hinch, and Geoffrey Robertson), and commercials (such as for American Express and Nescafé).\nIts subjects were also Australian politics, which it attacked through various political impersonations (including John Howard and Paul Keating), and also using the political puppets, Rubbery Figures, previously seen in small segments on the ABC, based on Peter Nicholson's political cartoons.\nAnother key distinguishing feature was the use of simulated channel surfing to switch from sketch to sketch, often in the middle of a sketch, sometimes after the punchline. Particularly, a sketch would abruptly switch to a momentary segment of static, followed by another sketch, simulating the effect of the viewer repeatedly switching channels. The channel-surfing device became a distinctive hallmark of the show that helped move quickly from sketch to sketch.\nThe television and multimedia subject matter of the sketches, pace, style, and devices were real points of difference from predecessor sketch-comedy shows of the time, particularly earlier shows such as The Mavis Bramston Show, The Naked Vicar Show, ''Australia You're Standing In It, The D-Generation, and The Comedy Company, Fast Forward was more media-focused and parody-focused; a real difference, and the binding force for the whole show, was the now-famous channel-changing device. The white noise and on-screen static that represented the channel change became the modern television equivalent of a curtain being drawn at an old-fashioned vaudeville show.\nFast Forward was also well known for its musical parodies, particularly of current music-video clips. Some of the better-known music parodies included ABBA, Cher, and Dannii Minogue.\nSketches and content\nEach episode of Fast Forward'' featured regular characters, a news-based segment, a major parody of a well-known television show or film, lampoons of television commercials, and political satire, particularly in a segment using the Rubbery Figures political puppets.\nSome of the most memorable regular characters included:\n*\tMarg Downey: SBS Presenter\n*\tMagda Szubanski: Pixie-Ann Wheatley; Chenille the Beautician (with Marg Downey as Janelle); the Ugly Couple (with Peter Moon)\n*\tSteve Vizard and Peter Moon: Advertising executives, Brent Smythe and Barry; Indian Rug Fakari salesmen Roger Ramshet and Abdul\n*\tMichael Veitch: gay flight attendants (with Steve Vizard); Kelvin Cunnington; Redmond Herring\n*\tGerry Connolly: the Queen; Joh Bjelke-Petersen\n*\tJane Turner: Russian news presenter Sveter (with Peter Moon as Victor), an early incarnation of Kath Day-Knight.\n*\tSteve Vizard: Darren Hunch (parody of Derryn Hinch)\n*\tErnie Dingo: Robert Gottliebsen\n*\tSteve Blackburn and Geoff Brooks: Arthur and Wayne Dodgy (dodgy salesmen who previously appeared in Australia You're Standing In It)\n*\tMichael Veitch and Glenn Robbins: The Whizz Bang Theatre Company\n* Magda Szubanski and Alan Pentland as \"Michelle and Ferret\", performing a dance routine on New Faces\nSome of the most memorable sketches included \"Dumb Street\", a parody of Home and Away and Neighbours, and a lampoon of Skippy. In one memorable sketch that went to air, Moon and Vizard were both visibly trying to contain their laughter through a series of insults in one of their parodies of Kung Fu.\nThe political puppets Rubbery Figures were made more \"commercial\" than on the ABC by inserting them into popular situations outside the political Canberra environment. This led to the Star Trek parody where Paul Keating was Mr. Spock and Bob Hawke was Captain Kirk. Rubbery Figures was a huge hit and a crucial element in the early success of Fast Forward.\nIn 1991,  five Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends skits featured Ertl Thomas models. These segments involved people complaining about Sodor not having female steam engines, the Fat Controller polluting the countryside by pouring purple slime out of the tankers, drunken punks, the engines going on strike, and the engines getting replaced. In these skits, Thomas would do some human things, such as eating breakfast, writing, and going away for the weekend.\nPercy was referred to as Bertie two times in the first sketch, Gordon at the end of the fourth, and Henry one time in the fifth. The sketches had five original engine characters, Crazy Bartholomew the Loco Locomotive, who was a Thomas model painted yellow, Alfred, who was a Percy model painted red (he was even referred to as Percy at the start of the fifth sketch), Damian the Diesel, who is not seen in person, Edgar, who is a mentioned engine character, and one of the female engines, who was a Percy model painted orange with additional detailing. Toby was also mentioned once at the end of the first sketch, as was Clarabel once in the fourth sketch.\nEpisodes\nSource:\n| end1       =\n| color2     = #4B5F2A\n| link2      = #Season 2 (1990)\n|
