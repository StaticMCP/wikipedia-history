NFTs, characterized by their indivisibility and uniqueness, are registered on a blockchain.\nImpact across industries\nArt and collectibles\nNFTs facilitate the buying, selling, and ownership of digital art on blockchain platforms, enabling artists to monetize their digital creations without physical reproduction. NFTs have enabled a notable shift in the economic dynamics of digital art transactions, allowing artists to receive compensation that potentially reflects the market value of their work more accurately.\nNFTs are also utilized to denote ownership of physical art, enabling digitization of ownership and transaction logs.\nMusic industry\nUtilizing smart contracts, NFTs can automate the distribution of royalties upon secondary sales, ensuring artists obtain a predetermined percentage. The embedded smart contracts within NFTs enable transparent and pre-agreed upon royalty distributions, reducing potential disputes and ensuring that original creators are compensated for subsequent sales. This transparency and assurance of financial compensation upon resale is a novel development in compensatory mechanisms within the music industry.\nGaming\nGame developers leverage NFT sales as a financing mechanism, providing early backers with unique, often utility-based, digital assets.\nReferences"
