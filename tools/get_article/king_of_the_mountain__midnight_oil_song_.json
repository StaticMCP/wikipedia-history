It peaked at  25 on the Australian Singles Chart, No. 3 on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, and No. 20 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.\nThe music video was partly filmed in front of the Exxon Building in Manhattan, New York City. This portion of the video shows the band performing in front of a banner that reads \"Midnight Oil makes you dance, Exxon oil makes us sick.\"\nBackground\nAlthough some people think the song is a reference to Peter Brock and the Bathurst 1000 held at Mount Panorama, drummer Rob Hirst said the song is actually inspired by the footrace up Mount Cooroora and the surrounding natural beauty and unique history of the Noosa hinterland.\nTrack listings\n| length1        = 3:58\n| title2         = Instant Karma!\n| note2          = live\n| writer2        = J.
