The nominees are determined by a team of judges employed by Mediacorp; winners are selected by a majority vote from the entire judging panel.\nNo nominees were announced for this category. However, in 2013, the nominees were revealed on Toggle Now minutes before the presentation of the award.\nSince its inception, the award has been given to seven artistes. Julie Tan was the final winner in this category for her breakthrough performance in The Dream Makers II.\nThe award was discontinued since 2017.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
