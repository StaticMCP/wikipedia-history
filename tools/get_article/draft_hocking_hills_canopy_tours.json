Founded in 2007, it was the first zipline tour in the state of Ohio and one of the earliest in the Midwest. It operates along the Hocking River, near U.S. Route 33, and draws tens of thousands of visitors annually.\nHistory\nThe facility opened in the summer of 2007 and was co-founded by regional tourism leader Karen Raymore and local developer Tim McAllister. Designed to highlight the natural features of the Hocking Hills area, the tour originally featured ten ziplines integrated into the forest canopy. Over time, the operation expanded to include additional zipline experiences, educational tours, and Segway routes.\nThe company has been credited with helping to popularize adventure tourism in southeastern Ohio, particularly in the Rockbridge and Logan areas.\nNotability\nHocking Hills Canopy Tours operates one of the region’s most established zipline and aerial course facilities, offering guided experiences that blend recreation with forest canopy exploration. The main tour includes a series of suspended bridges, elevated platforms, and zip lines that move participants through the treetops above the Hocking River. A shorter version of the course is available for younger children using a continuous-belay system for safety.\nFor visitors seeking a more advanced course, the facility also offers extended zipline routes with greater height and speed, including a dual racing line that spans a quarter-mile. Seasonal options occasionally include guided Segway tours through wooded trails and limited night zipline sessions.\nRecognition\nThe company has received frequent coverage in both national and regional media:\n* In 2012, it was ranked among the “Top 10 Amazing Ziplines in the World” by USA Today Travel.\n* Named “Best Outdoor Adventure in Ohio” multiple years by Ohio Magazine readers.\n* Featured by Ohio.org as a top-tier nature and adventure destination.\nLocation and Access\nHocking Hills Canopy Tours is located at 10714 Jackson Street, Rockbridge, OH, a short distance from the natural rock bridge in Rockbridge State Nature Preserve. The facility is open seasonally from early spring through late fall, with reservations recommended during peak months.\nSee also\n* Rockbridge State Nature Preserve\n* Hocking Hills State Park\nReferences"
