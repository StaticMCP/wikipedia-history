The Electoral College and random political endorsements are also part of the game and must be factored in to strategy.\nReception and legacy\nAlan R. Moon reviewed Campaign Trail for Games International magazine and stated, \"I find this game a little boring and long to keep my interest.\" Sid Sackson, writing for the magazine Games, thought it was \"one of the most successful [games] in capturing the competitive fervour of the real thing [election season]\". The same magazine named it 9th in their top 100 games of 1984.\nA copy of this game is held in the collection of the Strong National Museum of Play (object 117.765). The 2012 browser game The Campaign Trail, by Dan Bryan, was inspired by the board game.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
