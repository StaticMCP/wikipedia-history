Colonel Johan Stake quickly linked up with this force, along with his men. The Swedes wanted to act out their revenge on Iver Krabbe for his ruthlessness against the civilian population in the province.\nBattle\nOn Sunday of 27 September / 7 October, the Danish-Norwegian and Swedish forces met at Hjärtum. The day before, some 200 Swedes, to the despair of vicar Peder Bakke, occupied the church cemetery which surrounded the church to seek protection behind the strong cemetery wall. Krabbe quickly found out that the Swedes had blocked his path north, and after a quick march from Spekeröd with some 2,000–2,100 or 2,200 men and six guns, he arrived south of Hjärtum at around 10 o'clock.\nKrabbe found out that the Swedes were standing on top of the nearby plateau, and the way up on the narrow and crooked road was very stressful to force on the soldiers. Around 7:30 o'clock, the Swedes discovered Krabbe's advance, and Swedish patrols fought with the Danes in their flanks, and many Norwegians were killed in the bad terrain, but their advance continued.\nLieutenant General Harald Stake, at around 9 o'clock, received orders to attack the Danes and sent a vanguard of 400 dragoons from the Västmanland Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Per Lennartson Ulfsax along with 100 Västgöta cavalry under Lieutenant Colonel Silfverlood. They pulled two light field cannons with great difficulty through the narrow forest which was filled with stone blocks. In the resulting fighting, the Swedes suffered heavy casualties, losing both their cannons and the Ulfsax's standard. The fighting in the steep and rocky terrain was very difficult, which led Stenbock to withdraw back onto the plateau, named Hjärtums Skee.\nThis plateau, which today is used as a cemetery, was then a moor of around a kilometer long and 400 meters wide, and it was here where the main part of the battle would take place.\nThe Danish-Norwegian artillery, consisting of both 3-pounders along with other, higher caliber ones, killed many Swedes. The smoke from the cannons and muskets eventually became so thick that it almost became impossible for the fighters on either side to see their enemies or their own standards. Stenbock wrote the following in a report about the battle:\nThe fighting dragged on for around eight hours and only ended once the evening approached and the Swedes retreated. A Swedish soldier claimed that 350 cannonballs, 9,000 musketballs, and around 1.776 pounds of gunpowder had been fired during the battle.\nAftermath\nLosses\nThe Swedish losses were larger than the Dano-Norwegian ones, which amounting to some 100 killed, wounded, or captured. The Swedish ones were in total around 180–200 killed, which consisted of two captains, ten lieutenants and ensign's, 18 underofficers, and some 150 regular soldiers. Johan Stake was also among the dead, having been wounded early in the battle, and later killed with a stab to the heart.\nKrabbe himself claimed that the Swedes had suffered a few hundred dead and wounded, which is possibly a reasonable estimate. However, he likely downplayed his own losses, which he claimed as nine dead and 18 wounded.\nResult\nThe exact result of the battle is disputed, some sources claim it was a Dano-Norwegian victory, while others claim it was a Swedish victory.\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*"
