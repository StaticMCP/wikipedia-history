In 1713, a decree had been issued instituting primogeniture, that is, the Prince's oldest son would be his sole successor, rather than having to share sovereignty with his younger brothers, or dividing the principality.\nHe made an end to foreign sovereignty over various parts of his principality, thereby increasing its prestige.  He built  new church in Jechaburg and a Princely House in Sondershausen.  His hobby was hunting, and he built a hunting lodge named  on the Hainleite near Sondershausen.  The name of the lodge was derived from a poem by his half-sister Christiane Wilhelmine.\nAfter he died childless in 1740, his half-brother Henry XXXV inherited the principality.\nMarriage\nOn 2 October 1712 Günther married Elisabeth Albertine (1693-1774), a daughter of Prince Charles Frederick of Anhalt-Bernburg. The marriage was childless.\nReferences\n* Friedrich Apfelstedt: Das Haus Kevernburg-Schwarzburg von seinem Ursprunge bis auf unsere Zeit,\n* Dr. Kamill von Behr: Genealogie der in Europa regierenden Fürstenhäuser, Leipzig, 1870"
