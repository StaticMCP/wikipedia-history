The ceremony was hosted by Lorne Greene, and was held at the conclusion of the inaugural 1976 Festival of Festivals.\nDue to ongoing issues with Quebec filmmakers, the CFA's receipt of its annual government grant was made contingent upon the reaching of a compromise by the two groups. It was eventually agreed that the two sides would take turns hosting the awards.\nTo shore up public support, there was an increased PR campaign and CTV aired a one-hour broadcast of the awards ceremony. After pre-selection, the total submissions to the jury were 171 films, including 17 features and 76 documentaries.\nAfter much discussion about whether or not to add a commercial-value award, the CFAs introduced the Golden Reel Award, presented to the year's top-grossing Canadian film.\nWinners\nFilms\n*Best Feature Film: Lies My Father Told Me — Pentimento Productions and Pentacle VIII Productions, Harry Gulkin and Anthony Bedrich producers, Ján Kadár director\n*Best Theatrical Documentary: Ahô: The Forest People — Productions Via le Monde, François Floquet, Daniel Bertolino producers and directors\n*Best Documentary: Volcano: An Inquiry into the Life and Death of Malcolm Lowry — National Film Board of Canada, Donald Brittain and Robert Duncan producers, Donald Brittain and John Kramer directors\n*Best Theatrical Short: Cooperage — Rocky Mountain Films, Phillip Borsos producer and director\n*Best Animated Short: The Street — National Film Board of Canada, Guy Glover producer, Caroline Leaf director\n*Best Arts and Experimental: Barbara Is a Vision of Loveliness — Lightworks, R.
