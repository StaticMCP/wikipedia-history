Her boss, Eiji, asks her to train their new employee Yu Kamegawa. While outwardly appearing calm it is revealed Azusa actually uses false confidence to conceal her poor communication skills and introverted personality. In contrast Yu is handsome, confident, sociable and charming, making her realize she has a crush on him. After a bad first day she fears she is a failure, having worried about herself instead of teaching him. The next day she is determined to invite him to lunch like her mentor Kanzaki did with her but spends so long thinking about it she misses the opportunity. Her co-worker Ritsu Kankaiji urges her to do her best. For inspiration she reads self-help books on being an effective boss. Before she can try any techniques she overhears her coworkers gossiping about her being difficult to work with, causing her to cry in front of Yu. Yu insists to the others that Azusa has a softer side she just doesn't let anyone see. Azusa is quietly grateful but fails to invite him to lunch again.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Azusa includes Yu on a maid café collaboration project, hoping working so closely won't make it strange when she does invite him to lunch. Later, she becomes distracted thinking about Yu and lunch and accidentally agrees to a request from her boss without listening to it. When she sees Yu only brought instant noodles she is able to invite him to lunch, claiming she doesn't want him falling ill from poor nutrition. Unfortunately, she spent so much time trying to invite him she never thought of what to talk about once they started eating. The next day she urges Yu to always ask for help if he needs it, then becomes restless when he never seems to need her help. She blames herself for making their lunch awkward and decides to invite him again. Unfortunately, he is invited by their co-workers first, who automatically assume Azusa won't be interested in joining them. Azusa ends up convinced Yu thinks she is a useless mentor. Yu stays late so Azusa decides to do the same. Yu admits he admires how everyone relies on her, so he is determined his first project will impress her. He also thanks her for lunch when everyone says she prefers to eat alone. Azusa blurts out she wanted to have lunch with him, then becomes embarrassed at the implication.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Azusa's boss announces a drinking party to celebrate their co-worker Yamaga getting married. Yu is asked to arrange everything but Azusa has no idea how as she always avoids parties. For a wedding gift Azusa considers cat mugs but breaks one and feels ashamed when Yu pays for it. Eventually they buy towels as a gift. Azusa wonders what sort of party Yu would want. Yu claims he doesn't drink but would go drinking with her. Azusa panics and rejects the idea, then hates herself. The next day she finds Yu bought her one of the cat mugs. The party goes well but Azusa becomes drunk. Azusa claims Yu messed up a project, giving them an excuse to leave. She apologises for being a scary mentor but Yu assures her he thinks she is very kind. He asks her again to go drinking with him and this time Azusa agrees, then passes out. The next morning she learns getting her home took so long Yu had to stay with a friend without any clean clothes. Their boss spots lipstick on Yu's shirt and assumes he has a girlfriend, making Azusa panic for a moment, until he explains it is her lipstick from helping her get into a taxi, embarrassing her immensely. Their boss regrettably asks them to go on a business trip to Okinawa during Golden Week.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Azusa and Yu land in Okinawa for a sunscreen company's photo-shoot. As it is on the beach Azusa wears a swimsuit. Yu worries when the director flirts with Azusa so he deliberately interrupts but worries he upset her. At dinner there is dancing which Yu takes enthusiastic part in. Azusa is more reserved but eventually enjoys herself. Yu becomes flustered but is unsure why. Azusa visits Yu's room later with medication for his sunburn, reminding him it is unprofessional to be sunburned while working for a sun cream company. The next day they complete the photo-shoot early, so the director invites them on a group sightseeing tour. Yu notices Azusa panicking so he quickly claims they need to work on their maid café project by visiting Okinawan cafes. They enjoy the experience but Azusa worries Yu only saw it as work and might not have had fun. Azusa worries when their hotel booking is for a twin room they will have to share. Yu decides to sleep at a manga café to avoid any awkwardness. Feeling guilty, Azusa asks him to stay and even challenges him to play games together. Yu worries he only causes problems for Azusa, especially when she claims she had an excellent relationship with her own mentor. They return home the next day and Yu realises he had a lot of fun.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = A typhoon hits Japan but Azusa decides to go to work to set a good example for Yu then send him home early like a good mentor. On arriving they find they are the only ones in the office. They try to leave for a meeting but discover Azusa forgot her umbrella. Sharing Yu's umbrella Azusa panics at how close they are. Yu leads the meeting perfectly so Azusa is determined to send him home early. They return to the office where Azusa tries to hang up his jacket, only to end up wearing it and acting silly, unaware he was watching. Yu realises Azusa is scared of thunder so he distracts her. Azusa asks him to collect documents from the Sales team then go home early. Yu ends up meeting his friend Tsukahara in the Sales office who asks for his help. Azusa is upset Yu will end up working overtime doing another department's work, so she scolds Tsukahara for inconveniencing her trainee. Yu is grateful and offers to share an umbrella to the train station. Azusa realises Yu is actually quite manly. Getting off the train near her apartment Azusa is surprised Yu makes her take his umbrella, so she insists he take her towel. Azusa is glad she will be working remotely the next day. Yu decides to properly wash Azusa's towel before returning it.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Azusa decides to ask Yu for drinks but finds he has already been invited to a fireworks festival by his fellow trainees, including Hotta. Yu and Hotta also invite Azusa, who decides to wear a yukata. Hotta is inspired to wear her own yukata as well. The other trainees are nervous to socialise with Azusa due to her scary reputation. As the festival is busy the group splits up; Azusa going with Yu and Hotta. Azusa is intrigued to see Yu talk casually with another person but suddenly begins to feel like an intruder on their personal time, so while they are distracted she wanders off on her own feeling depressed. She becomes lost, breaks the strap of her sandal and can't find her way back as her phone has died. Hotta finds her and explains to Yu about the broken sandal. Azusa is surprised Hotta admires her but Hotta explains all Yu ever does is praise her as a mentor. Yu appears, worried about her, and manages to repair her sandal. With the fireworks starting Azusa wonders if she would have been able to tell Yu how she felt if she was his equal and not his mentor.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Yu notices Azusa's dialect sometimes slips out around him. Azusa notices Yu is close with his parents who live in Saitama, whereas her own parents live far away in Kyushu. After work she and Yu encounter each other grocery shopping and feel awkward as they are surrounded by couples. Yu claims having someone to cook with would be nice, making Azusa feel guilty since she usually buys pre-made bento. Azusa's mother calls, mentioning babies and arranged marriages, so Azusa claims she has a boyfriend. She realises Yu heard her and reverts to her Kyushu dialect in a panic, then panics even more after realising she speaks it so often Yu has started to understand some of it. Her mother calls again, revealing she is in town and wants to meet her boyfriend. Yu realises he is happy Azusa doesn't have a boyfriend and impulsively offers to be her fake boyfriend for her mother. They meet her mother, Sakura, surprising Yu at how young she looks. Azusa steps out for a phone call, during which Sakura reveals Azusa has always struggled socially, worrying her she will be alone forever. After dinner Sakura secretly tells Yu it is obvious they are not really dating, but the fact Azusa sometimes talks to him in Kyushu dialect means she must trust him a lot.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Kamegawa's maid café project nears completion and Azusa is drawn to the maid outfits, wondering if Yu likes that sort of thing. On opening day Azusa and Hotta find Yu being yelled at by the client as the merchandise delivery was late so the shelves haven't been stocked yet. Azusa is forced to scold Yu for not ordering the merchandise earlier but also feels guilty as it was an issue she could have pointed out beforehand. Three waitresses call in sick so Azusa steps in as a maid but messes up repeatedly as she has no waitressing experience, whereas Hotta manages perfectly. Yu worries Azusa is pushing herself too hard but Hotta assures him Azusa just wants his first project to be a success. Azusa passes out during the stage performance, forcing Hotta to replace her. Azusa is disappointed she wasn't of any real help. Yu reveals everything he is hopeless at, making Azusa feel better. Back inside she finds Hotta struggling with a difficult customer, so Azusa approaches him angrily, though this turns out to be what the masochistic customer wanted the whole time. More waitresses finally arrive and the client is thrilled the first day was a success. Yu admits Azusa makes a bad maid as her personality is more suitable for a Master role. Hotta insists on taking them drinking to celebrate.\n}}\n}}\nOther\nIn commemoration of the releases of volumes 3 and 4, the series had two cosplay collaborations with the model Nashiko Momotsuki dressed-up as main character Azusa Kannawa in 2021.\nReception\nThe series was ranked fifth at the sixth Next Manga Awards in the print category.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
