King Street was a single-family home located in Owosso, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nHistory\nThe House at 314 W. King Street was constructed in 1890, and reflects a time of growth in the city of Owosso. It was presumably demolished some time between 1980 and 2017.\nDescription\nThe House at 314 W. King Street was a two-story clapboard Queen Anne-style structure. It had\nasymmetrical massing and fenestration, a varied roofline, and a broad porch typical of the Queen Anne style. The house had a wide variety of surfaces used on the facades, including tongue-and-groove on the entire base of the wood superstructure, clapboard on most of the facades, fish-scale shingling on the gables, vertical panelling on the underside of the overhanging eaves, and diamond carved wood lintels over the windows. On the front facade, there was a tri-sided bay, with a stained glass center window surrounded by decorative spandrels.\nReferences"
