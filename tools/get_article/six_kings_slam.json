The tournament is held over four days, with the third day being a rest day in order to follow an ATP rule that players cannot compete on three consecutive days in an exhibition.\nHistory\nSince this is not an ATP-sanctioned event, players do not earn any ranking points and the match results do not count towards official head-to-head tallies. Each of the six participants is guaranteed a participation fee with the winner receiving a larger payout.\nThe event is held in an 8,000 seat stadium purpose-built for the tournament originally named the Venue, later named anb arena [sic].\nJannik Sinner won the inaugural tournament by defeating Carlos Alcaraz in the final and claimed the biggest prize check in tennis history, surpassing Novak Djokovic's prize of $4,740,300 at the 2022 ATP Finals. Novak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal for the third-place trophy.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=50|Year\n!width=200|Champion\n!width=200|Runner-up\n!width=200|Score\n|-\n| 2024\n|  Jannik Sinner\n|  Carlos Alcaraz\n| 6–7(5–7), 6–3, 6–3\n|-\n| 2025\n| Jannik Sinner (2)\n| Carlos Alcaraz\n|6–2, 6–4\n|}\nBroadcasting\nFor its first year, DAZN acquired the global rights to broadcast 6 Kings Slam, with T2 airing the matches in the US.
