At some point he changed his name by Royal Licence from Reid to Fenwick. In 1841, he married Sarah Fenwick Bowen, daughter of Thomas Fenwick, and they had at least two children: Thomas Fenwick Fenwick (1842–1907), and Robert Fenwick Fenwick (–1868).\nFenwick was elected Liberal MP for Lancaster at a by-election in 1864—caused by the resignation of William Garnett—and held the seat until 1866 when he was unseated for corruption. The seat was later disenfranchised under the Reform Act 1867.\nFenwick was also a Justice of the Peace for Lancashire, Yorkshire and Westmorland, and, in 1865, Deputy Lieutenant for Lancaster.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
