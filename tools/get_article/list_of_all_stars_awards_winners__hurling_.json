As an insight to the prominent players of the 1960s, it also includes the unofficial \"Cuchulainn\" awards presented from 1963 to 1967 under the auspices of Gaelic Weekly magazine.\nSince 1971, the All Stars Awards in hurling have been presented annually to a set of fifteen hurlers from that year's All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship, who are seen to be deserving of being named in a \"Team of the Year\". The shortlist is compiled by a selection committee steering group, while the overall winners are chosen by inter-county players themselves. The All Star is regarded by players as the highest individual award available to them, due to it being picked by their peers.\nLimerick hold the record for most All-Star winners in one year with 12 players chosen in the hurling selection for 2021.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Positions\n|-\n!GK\n|Goalkeeper\n|-\n!RCB\n|Right corner-back\n|-\n!FB\n|Full-back\n|-\n!LCB\n|Left
