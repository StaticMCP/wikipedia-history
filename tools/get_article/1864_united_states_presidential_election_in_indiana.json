The National Union ticket of the incumbent president Abraham Lincoln and the governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson defeated the Democratic ticket of the former commanding general of the United States Army George B. McClellan and the U.S. representative from Ohio's 1st congressional district George H. Pendleton. Lincoln defeated McClellan in the national election with 212 electoral votes.\nGeneral election\nSummary\nIndiana chose 13 electors on a statewide general ticket. Nineteenth-century election laws required voters to vote directly for members of the Electoral College rather than for president. This sometimes resulted in small differences in the number of votes cast for electors pledged to the same presidential candidate, if some voters did not vote for all the electors nominated by a party. This table reflects the statewide popular vote as calculated by Walter Dean Burnham in his influential study, Presidential Ballots, 1836–1892.\n}}\n2.38}}\n}}\n4.11}}\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Indiana\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
