As they became due for heavy overhauls in the late 1970s, they were withdrawn.\n1200 has been preserved by the Australian Railway Historical Society, and is currently stored at Redbank Railway Workshops.\n1225 class\nin August 2005]]\nIn 1984, 1208 was rebuilt using parts from 1250 class locomotives 1252 and 1253, including a more powerful  engine to replace the original  EE 12SVT engine, while the body was modified to resemble a 1250 class. It earned the nickname \"Hybrid\" after this work and was renumbered 1225. It also resembles the Brazilian . It remained in service until 1987, based at Toowoomba working mainly on the Southern line. The loco is now privately owned and is currently stored at Queensland Pioneer Steam Railway (QPSR) at Swanbank Queensland since it was moved there in mid-2010. QPSR now want it out of their premises so now its future is uncertain.\nStatus table\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Number !! Serialnumber !! In service !! Withdrawn !! Scrapped !!
