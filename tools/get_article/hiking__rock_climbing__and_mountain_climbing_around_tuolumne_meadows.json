There is a separate page, all about granite domes of Yosemite. At present, its references focus on rock climbing, but others are free, to add references about hiking. It is available under Granite Domes of Yosemite National Park, as the page is not specific to Tuolumne Meadows; the table of domes may be sorted, so you may look at a chosen area.\nHiking\nMany backcountry hiking and backpacking trails start in or near Tuolumne Meadows. The John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trails are long-distance backpacking trails that go through Lyell Canyon into Tuolumne Meadows. Tuolumne Meadows also feature a wide range of day trails. Day hike trails are popular, and get busy in the summer high season. These trails are serviced by the Tuolumne Meadows shuttle bus, typically from June to September, though dates vary due to weather.\n, in the foreground, occupies a basin excavated in the granite by the ancient glaciers.

As the area is all at a high elevation, climbing season is mainly limited to June through September.\nIn Tuolumne, granite tends to be knobby, moreso than Yosemite Valley.\nThe rock is porphyritic granite, a very strong form of granite, plus granodiorite; see Cathedral Peak Granodiorite and Kuna Crest Granodiorite. It has a tendency to exfoliation, which produces and preserves distinctive \"onion dome\" shapes. Resulting climbing includes both face and crack routes, face routes often runout due to limited numbers of bolts, and crack routes frequently following very thin cracks. Local ethic is to limit the placement of bolts on new routes and to forbid the addition of bolts to existing routes, resulting in distances of  or more between bolts.\nMany domes are in Tuolumne area. Major (and minor) domes include:\n* Daff Dome,\n* Dog Dome\n* Dozier Dome,\n* Fairview Dome,\n* Harlequin Dome,\n* Lembert Dome,\n* Mariolumne Dome,\n* Marmot Dome,\n* Medlicott Dome,\n* Polly Dome,\n* Pothole Dome,\n* Puppy Dome,\n* Stately Pleasure Dome\nEcho Peaks have been hiked, but are usually rock-climbed, as Ragged Peak may be scrambled, but is also rock climbed. Mountain that are not usually walk-ups, but typically rock-climbs:\n* Cockscomb,\n* Echo Peaks,\n* Ragged Peak\n* Unicorn Peak,\nMountain climbing\nAround Tuolumne Meadows, mountain climbing is quite popular; for the highest mountains in the entire park, see the highest mountains of Yosemite National Park.\n: Half Dome, which may be hiked, via the Cable Route.
