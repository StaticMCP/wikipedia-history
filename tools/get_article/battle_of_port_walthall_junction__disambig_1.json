Although initially successful, the Confederates were eventually defeated, allowing Union forces to cut a railroad.  The Port Walthall Junction on the Richmond-Petersburg Railroad connected with the spur to Port Walthall.\nBattle\n.]]\nIn conjunction with the opening of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign, Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's Army of the James, 33,000 strong, disembarked from transports at Bermuda Hundred on May 5, threatening the Richmond-Petersburg Railroad. On May 6, Confederate Brig. Gen. Johnson Hagood's brigade stopped initial Federal probes at Port Walthall Junction. On May 7, a Union division drove Hagood's and Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson's brigades from the depot and cut the railroad at Port Walthall Junction. Confederate defenders retired behind Swift Run Creek and awaited reinforcements.\nAftermath\nUnion casualties were more than 300, Confederates fewer than 200, primarily from Hagood's brigade.\nNotes\n}}\nReferences\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150304120413/http://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/va047.htm National Park Service battle description]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121108221520/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Piedmont%20to%20Proctors%20Creek.pdf CWSAC Report Update]\n* Salmon, John S.
