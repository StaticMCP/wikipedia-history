It was the last collaboration between Barboni and Bud Spencer with the pairs sons co-writing the film together; Spencer's daughter also plays a role in the film.\nThe role of Victor was originally intended to be played by Terence Hill, but Hill had to refuse as still being engaged on the set of the Lucky Luke TV series. The film was filmed in Florida.\nPlot\nBull Webster is a taxi driver with some work problems on his hands: the Spider Corporation, a giant financial holding company, has decided to buy out his taxi co-operative in order to make it go bankrupt and purchase its land at a low cost. Bull is almost driven to desperation, but then he finds the winning ticket in his pocket to a lottery with the biggest prize of all time: $150 million! With money like that, he can afford to make his enemies eat their plan. But at this point, Bull's future begins to interest those responsible for the destiny of human affairs: Heaven and Hell send an Angel and a Devil to tempt Bull into evil or to convince him to do good. The appearance of these characters in earthly events creates a maze of situations that are amusing, dramatic and full of action. And for once it's the humans, and especially our hero Bull, who come out winning.\nCast\n* Bud Spencer: Bull Webster\n* Carol Alt: Veronica Flame\n* Thierry Lhermitte: Victor\n* Ian Bannen: Luzifer\n* Jean Sorel: Holy father\n* Sharon Madden: Betty\n* Sean Arnold: Morrison\n* Riccardo Pizzuti: Taxi driver (red cab)\n* Diamante Spencer: Bull's daughter\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
