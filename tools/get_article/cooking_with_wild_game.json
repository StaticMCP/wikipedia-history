She wrote: \"Cooking with Wild Game isn't the most thrilling of books, but it is setting up to perhaps spend more time on things that aren't excessive amounts of game-preparation... If you enjoy cooking stories, this is an interesting one, even if it has yet to achieve a perfect balance of its story elements.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at Shōsetsuka ni Narō\n*\n*\n*"
