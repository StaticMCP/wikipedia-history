She is represented by IDN.\nEarly life\nFreyanashifa Jayawardana was born in Tangerang on 13 February 2006. She is the eldest among three siblings, with two younger brothers. She spent her childhood in Samarinda before moving to Jakarta.\nCareer\n2018–2022: Early career and debut in JKT48\nFreya had shown and developed an early interest in dancing and singing during her childhood. Admiring Barbie and Girls' Generation, she considered career opportunities that aligned with her artistic interests. After graduating from elementary school, Freya moved to Jakarta and immediately auditioned for JKT48. She auditioned for the seventh generation of JKT48 in 2018 and was accepted into the group at the age of 12. Freya officially started as a trainee member in Academy Class B on September 29, 2018. However, on October 25, 2018, she did not pass the initial stage of the Class B Academy Exam. Despite this setback, she continued to progress and was promoted to Academy Class A on December 18, 2018. Although she did not qualify in the 5th JKT48 Senbatsu Sousenkyo in 2018, Freya made a subsequent attempt in the 6th JKT48 Senbatsu Sousenkyo in 2019, though she did not rank within the top 32.\nFreya first came into the spotlight when she went viral on Twitter in 2020. Later, on June 2, 2020, she joined JKT48's Team T, marking a significant step in her career as an idol. The following year, on March 12, 2021, she became an official member of JKT48's seventh generation and was transferred into the JKT48 New Formation. In 2021, she was also contributed to the production of the short film project Film Pendek Profil Pelajar Pancasila (The Short Film about Profile of Pancasila Students), a collaboration project between JKT48 and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia. She has a fairly loyal fanbase among JKT48 fans, known as Freyanation.\nIn September 2022, Freya was selected as a representative member of JKT48. As part of her role, she was invited to deliver a discourse at the Indonesia Millennial and Gen-Z Summit 2022, an event held in Jakarta.\n2023–present: Breakthrough and rise to prominence\nFreya became a viral meme sensation on the internet in 2023. On July 19, 2023, she appeared as a special guest on the Trans7 variety show Lapor Pak!, which subsequently became a trending topic on Twitter. In August 2023, she represented JKT48 at the Tokyo Idol Festival 2023, and conducted an official visit to the AKB48 Theater. Later that same month, she represented JKT48 at the AniManGaki 2023. In October 2023, she set a new record that solidified her position as the first member of JKT48 to successfully perform all unit songs from the Renai Kinshi Jourei setlist. She was also selected to appear in advertising campaigns for Shopee.\nIn early 2024, Freya debuted on the film industry with her appearance in the production of a horror movie entitled Kuasa Gelap, which is scheduled to commence shooting on February 10, 2024. In April 2024, she contributed her voice to the JKT48 Voice Pack as part of the Free Fire x JKT48 collaboration. On May 8, 2024, she attended the premiere of JKT48's short film Magic Hour, an event that also celebrated the release of the original single of the same title. She performed an acting role in the short film and also sang on the original single. She was also selected in late May 2024 to represent JKT48 in the AKB48 6th Group Singing Competition in 2024, along with seven other members. In mid-2024, it was revealed that Freya was cast for series adaptation of the novel Dia Angkasa as Vana. She is also set to star in the film adaptation of the drama series 1 Kakak 7 Ponakan. In July 2024, she represented JKT48 as the brand ambassador for Scarlett's body care line products. On July 22, 2024, the group's official website confirmed her participation as a representative of JKT48 at the AKB48 Group LIVE in KL 2024, which will be held in Kuala Lumpur. In early August 2024, she took part in Melodi Kemerdekaan 2024, a state ceremonial event organized in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy to commemorate the 79th anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Indonesia.\nIn October 2024, Freya, representing JKT48, was appointed as a brand ambassador for Infinix and appeared on the Jakarta Fashion Week (JFW) 2025 stage. On November 29, 2024, she was showcased in a Pokémon TCG commercial as part of a collaboration between Pokémon TCG and JKT48. In December 2024, she appeared in the documentary 13 Tahun JKT48: Kisah Tumbuhnya Para Idola (13 Years of JKT48: The Growth Tale of Idols). This documentary, which was hosted by Najwa Shihab, featured members, management, and fans. During the same month, in the final results of the 7th JKT48 Senbatsu Sousenkyo, she retained the sixth position with 77,328 votes, placing her among the members of the Senbatsu lineup. As a result, she appeared in the group's 26th single, \"#KuSangatSuka\", released in early February 2025. Additionally, she was selected as the Global Center for the Te wo Tsunaginagara setlist.\nArtistry\nFreya is known among JKT48 fans and the public for her good manners and positive attitude. From the outset, she has shown great ability in both dancing and singing, which are part of her primary interests. She is also known for her discipline in training, which has led to her rapid development within the group's lineup. Freya gained more popularity, notably on TikTok, following the viral spread of video memes from her live broadcasts on the SHOWROOM app. Also, her popularity extends to various sectors, including fashion styles, video games, and e-commerce. For example, her appearances at the Shopee Live event, Freya, in collaboration with Zee or Christy, successfully created an uproar throughout Indonesia. Furthermore, her appointment as the ambassador for Shopee's 8th anniversary solidified her standing in the industry.\nPublic image\nAlthough at first, Freya was portrayed as having a childlike personality, which was evident in her relationship with her fellow seventh generation members of JKT48. But nevertheless, it is also apparent that she is consistent in having good manners and a positive attitude. She is admired for her kindness and willingness to interact with fans, particularly those with disabilities. Over time, as her career has progressed, her personality has evolved into a more mature image. Her close friendships with fellow JKT48 members, including Fiony Alveria and others, have been frequently highlighted in media, with their relationships often portrayed as \"best friends\" in public appearances.\nFreya is known for her fondness of 90s songs and her relative unfamiliarity with current song trends. Her interests encompass a wide array of activities, including dancing, singing, photography, reading novels, and traveling. These activities serve not only as a means of escape from her demanding role as an idol but also as a support for her personal growth and development.\nPersonal life\nFreya is a descendant of Sultan Hamengkubuwana II and holds the noble title of Raden Rara (a title given to female descendants of any Sultans of Yogyakarta from 5th grade onwards who is still or remain unmarried). The noble title was added to her official identity when she turned 17 years old. Her mother is a Minangkabau.\nJKT48 Senbatsu Sousenkyo Placements\nSince her debut in 2018, Freya has participated in several editions of the JKT48 Senbatsu Sousenkyo.
