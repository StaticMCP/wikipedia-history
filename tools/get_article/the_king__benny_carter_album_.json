As The King (his first small-group session since 1966) proves, the masterful altoist had not lost a thing through the years. ... Benny Carter is in masterful form, stretching out on eight of his own compositions and showing that his name always has to be ranked near the top of jazz improvisers, whether one is considering the 1930s or the 1990s\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Benny Carter except where noted\n# \"A Walkin' Thing\" – 6:18\n# \"My Kind of Trouble Is You\" (Carter, Paul Vandervoort II) – 4:35\n# \"Easy Money\" – 6:16\n# \"Blue Star\" – 8:05\n# \"I Still Love Him So\" – 6:42\n# \"Green Wine\" (Carter, Leonard Feather) – 6:45\n# \"Malibu\" – 4:25\n# \"Blues in D Flat\" – 7:56\nPersonnel\n*Benny Carter – alto saxophone\n*Milt Jackson – vibraphone\n*Joe Pass – guitar\n*Tommy Flanagan – piano\n* John B.
