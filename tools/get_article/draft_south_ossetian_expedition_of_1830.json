In 1810 the first expedition was sent to Ossetia, but it did not produce results. Paskevich-Erivansky decided to conquer\nthem entirely through military force. For these purposes, in 1830, they collected troops for the simultaneous organization of two campaigns against this people from Georgia and the North Caucasus.\nPrelude\nOn June 16, a detachment was formed in Tskhinvali from a battalion of Kherson grenadiers, two companies of the Erivan regiment, two Don hundreds and 4 mountain guns. In total, the expedition included 2,600 soldiers. On June 19, the Russians entered Dzau, where they met no resistance, after which they began advancing into the mountainous regions. Ossetian villages that offered resistance were burned.\nFrom 21 to 24 June, Rennenkampf fought with Ossetians for the village of Daudonasto, as a result of which Russian army lost 19 soldiers.\nAfter this, on June 22, the battles for Zekar Mountains began. Rennenkampf made several attempts to take the mountain, suffering heavy losses.The Ossetians were driven high into the mountains. On June 24, after the numerous battles, the Ossetian of Zekar mountains were forced to negotiate and surround because of lack of food.\nHowever, among the Ossetians there were those who refused to surrender. Aka Kabisov, together with several other Ossetians, retreated to Kolo Castle. After which clashes began known as the Battle on Kolo\nBattle on Kola\nOn June 26, Rennekampf's troops surrounded the village of Kolo, which had a large battle tower. There were about 30 Ossetian rebels in it who refused to surrender. After this, they began to fire at the tower from mountain weapons, which did not produce any results. Rennenkampf led an attack with 500 soldiers, but it was unsuccessful, as a result of this attack the Russians lost 22 soldiers.The fighting continued all day, but the rebels continued to hold out and refused to surrender. After this, Russian troops burned the tower with the help of fires, the Ossetian rebels tried to escape, but 9 of them were raised at bayonets, and Bega Kochiev was captured.\nAftermath\nThe main goal - to conquer the Ossetians - was accomplished. South Ossetia was divided into 4 districts. Georgian nobles were placed at the head of these districts.\nBega Kochiev was imprisoned in Gori, but was able to escape from there. However, despite the cessation of hostilities, Ossetia continued to remain a very troubled region. A German traveler who visited Ossetia in 1838 wrote that the Ossetians from Kolo did not want to recognize Russian domination. The Russian Prince appointed head of one of these regions could not visit Ossetia for fear of death.\nReferences"
