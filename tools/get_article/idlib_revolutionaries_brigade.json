Khaled also told journalists that the Syrian Democratic Forces had met with officials from Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Kobane, and said that the meeting was organized by the United States to help combat Iranian and Turkish influence in Syria, with the deployment of Arab soldiers in Syria.\nThe group's leader, Iskander Alaa claims that Turkey is protecting Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which he believes is still al-Nusra, despite openly denouncing its link to al-Qaeda, changing its name and merging with other groups to form HTS, and that Russian-Turkish negotiations have failed, he also believes that military action is necessary to remove HTS from Idlib in order to stop Russian airstrikes in Idlib and he called upon Idlib's locals to join the Idlib Revolutionaries Front, fight against HTS and al-Qaeda.\nHistory\nOn its Facebook, the group claims to be active in fighting against the Turkish military and allied rebel groups fighting against the Syrian Democratic Forces in northern Syria. On 2 December 2019 a statement was released by the Idlib Revolutionaries Brigade, that claimed that Turkey had committed a massacre in Tel Rifaat and called upon the European Union, United States and Russia to intervene against Turkey and its military operation in northern Syria.\nSee also\n*Idlib Military Council\n*SDF insurgency in Northern Aleppo\nReferences"
