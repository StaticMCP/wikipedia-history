The Austrians attacked the Ostrovia castle; however, they were forced to retreat and, in turn, were attacked and routed by the Ottomans.\nBackground\nFour Austrian columns were gathered at Karlovac led by Lieutenant General Stubenberg. He ordered them to advance toward Una Valley. The main column advancing through the Korana valley was led by General Count Herberstein. This crossed the Korana on the night of July 15th to 16th and reached Bihac after some fighting. A side column to the right of it headed towards Dreznik, another to the left towards Cetin, and began to bombard this fortress on July 21st.\nOn the other hand, Colonel Raunach , believing that the Stubenberg and other groups would also cross the border on July 12th, as had been previously determined, began his advance from Dobroselo on July 13th, adhering to the agreed deadline and crossing the border on the said day; he crossed the Una on the 15th.\nBattle\nRaunach camped two hours from Ostrovica on the 16th. Two days later, the Austrians encamped some distance from Ostrovica Castle without having the area reconnoitred. This was the castle the Austrians aimed to capture. The castle stood on a hill on the right bank of the Una River, and on the left was the city of Ostrovica Istelf. The Austrians began digging trenches in the evening due to Ottoman artillery fire. The next day the Austrians began bombarding the castle with two cannons, although one of the cannons exploded after a few shots. News came that the Ottomans were gathering their forces in the area. Nevertheless, the attack continued.\nThe Austrians had three guns; however, one was exploded on the 21st, and the rest could not be brought due to insufficient length, leaving the Austrians with one cannon only. To disperse the Ottoman gathering, Raunach dispatched a force of 800 men, which moved on the 20th. However, it was too late, as the Colonel ordered a retreat across Una to secure the line of retreat. The Ottomans attacked the Austrians and were also advancing to Dobroselo. The Colonel decided to open the way to Dobroselo by attacking the advancing Ottoman force; however, he had no time to divide his forces.\nAfter the head of the corps emerged from the Ravines and passed into the plains, the Ottomans attacked them so fiercely that they had no time to fire their rifles. The Austrians were quickly broken; Colonel Raunach was killed alongside Major Topp. The infantry took refuge in the forest while the cavalry, unable to withstand the attack, rushed towards the retreating line detachment, whose men either ran off to bushes, offered resistance in small groups, or fled to baggage and artillery. The ammunition was lost along with the baggage. In this fiasco, the Colonel, 8 officers, and 600 men killed and 30 were captured.\nAftermath\nThe remnants of the troops, caught in the flank and rear and then completely scattered, only managed to find a way back to Karlovac with great difficulty, and their terrified flight caused all three groups of Lieutenant General Stubenberg to flee in terror.\nReferences\nSources\n*József Bánlaky: Military history of the Hungarian nation (MEK-OSZK), 0014/1149.The military operations of 1737.[https://mek.oszk.hu/09400/09477/html/0019/1726.html]\n*Friedrich Vaníček (1875), Special history of the military frontier, drawn from original sources and source works (In German).[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/Specialgeschichte_der_Milit%C3%A4rgrenze/626xAMBOTP0C?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Raunach+1737&pg=PA316&printsec=frontcover]\n*Gaston Bodart (1908), Military-historical encyclopedia, (1618-1905) (In German).[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/Milit%C3%A4r_historisches_kreigs_lexikon_161/A0kNAAAAYAAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=Raunach+1737&pg=PA185&printsec=frontcover]"
