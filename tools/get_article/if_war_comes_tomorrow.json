The entire Soviet people, young and old, rise to defend their socialist homeland. Volunteers are being recruited at workplaces, and millions of patriots rally under the battle banners. From distant Uzbekistan, sunny Georgia, the Kuban and the Don, the Terek and the Urals, from the fields of Ukraine, and the factories of Donbass, trains carrying heroic defenders of the Motherland head to the frontlines.\nMarshal of the Soviet Union, Comrade Voroshilov, arrives at the forward positions and delivers a speech that resonates in the hearts of every soldier. The order is given: break through the enemy front and defeat them on their own territory. A decisive battle begins. Tanks overcome fascist defenses and crush their artillery. Soviet air forces penetrate deep into enemy lines, deploying parachute troops. The paratroopers block the path of enemy reinforcements.\nWith shouts of \"For the Soviet Motherland!\" and a powerful \"Hurrah!\" the Soviet soldiers charge into attack.\nCast\n* Inna Fyodorova as commander's wife\n* Vsevolod Sanayev as soldier (uncredited)\n* Serafim Kozminsky as air brigade commander\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
