Sponsored by the American Honda Motor Company, the Invitational Showcase took place in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia in late January from 2003 to 2020.  In 2022, it was announced HBOB selected Alabama State University in Montgomery, Alabama to be the first ever HBCU campus to host the in-person event in February 2023. Since 2023, the HBOB has been moving to new locations. In 2025, HBOB was held in the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\nThe Honda Battle of the Bands Celebration Tour takes place between the months of September and November at regular season football games, although Honda Battle of the Bands (and its abbreviations) is often intended to refer only to the invitational showcase, which first took place in 2003. Seemingly contradictory to the name, Honda's \"battle\" is not a competition in the traditional sense; that is, no winner is crowned during the event. Rather, the bands compete for the favor of the audience, each other, and the greater community.\nThe event is historically one of the most popular collegiate marching band event in the nation, drawing over 50,000 fans and spectators annually.\nParticipation\nThe Honda Battle of the Bands program includes two components — the Voting Process, which runs September through October, and the \"Honda Battle of the Bands Invitational Showcase\".\nVoting:\nThe first band will be selected by popular vote (i.e. the top overall vote-getter will be selected regardless of category).\nThe next three bands will be selected, one from each category by a weighted vote of 1/3 from institution president, band director and online opinion poll from category I, II and III. The categories being 128 instruments or less, 129 instruments up to 160 and 161 or more. This count is total instrument count, no auxiliaries, drum majors, etc. but will include percussion.\n:a. Online Opinion Poll at hondabattleofthebands.com -- 1/3 weight\n:b. Band Directors’ Votes -- 1/3 weight\n:c. Presidents’ Votes -- 1/3 weight\nNote: Presidents and Band Directors are not permitted to vote for their own institutions.\nAmerican Honda and Urban Sports & Entertainment Group will select the final four bands based on, but not limited to:\n:a. Showmanship\n:b. Social Media Buzz\n:c. Years of previous participation in the Celebration Tour\nOnce all the votes are tallied, a total of 8 bands are invited to perform their carefully choreographed, halftime time routines in front of 50,000+ fans.\nHistory\nStarted in 2003, the Honda Battle of the Bands was created to celebrate, support and recognize the excellence of Black college marching bands and the unique academic experience offered by Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Honda annually awards more than $205,000 in grants to participating marching bands during the program period and facilitates a HBCU recruitment fair preceding the band showcase.\nThe following HBCUs have participated in the Honda Invitational Showcase:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The HBOB is an invitational showcase and there are usually no official winners.\n*In 2014, HBOB declared an official winner for the first time and it was North Carolina A&T's marching band.  HBOB has only declared an official winner once in the history of the event.\n*With 13 appearances as of 2023, Bethune-Cookman's marching band leads with the most invitations to the HBOB.\nSee also\n*Historically black colleges and universities\n*Honda Campus All-Star Challenge\n*African Americans in Atlanta\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://thegrio.com/2014/01/28/north-carolina-at-wins-12th-annual-honda-battle-of-the-bands/ North Carolina A&T wins 12th annual Honda Battle of the Bands]"
