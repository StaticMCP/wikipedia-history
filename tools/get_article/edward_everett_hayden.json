He was born in Boston, and was a lifelong naval officer. Early on he was associated with the Smithsonian and the US Geological Survey, but after losing a leg he turned to meteorology. He was considered an expert in sea storms, and wrote many articles about them. In 1888 he helped co-found the National Geographic Society, and served as its vice-president from 1890 until 1893.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
