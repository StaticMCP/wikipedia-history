It was either an ancient Greek dialect—part of Northwest Greek or Aeolic Greek—or a distinct Indo-European language, possibly closely related to Greek and part of the Hellenic branch. Spoken originally in the kingdom of Macedon, it gradually fell out of use during the 4th century BC, marginalized by the use of Attic Greek by the Macedonian aristocracy, the Ancient Greek dialect that became the basis of Koine Greek, the lingua franca of the Hellenistic period. It became extinct during either the Hellenistic or Roman imperial period, and was entirely replaced by Koine Greek.\nWhile the bulk of surviving public and private inscriptions found in ancient Macedonia were written in Attic Greek (and later in Koine Greek), fragmentary documentation of a vernacular local Macedonian variety comes from onomastic evidence, ancient glossaries, and recent epigraphic discoveries in the Greek region of Macedonia, such as the curse tablets from Pella and Pydna.\nClassification\nScholars have variously proposed that ancient Macedonian was a dialect of Greek, a sister language or an independent Indo-European language, and the disputes have sometimes had modern nationalistic overtones. Research has also considered the extent of influence from Thessalian Aeolic Greek and non-Greek substrata or adstrata, such as Phrygian, Illyrian, and Thracian. There has been some recent scholarly agreement, often expressed as cautious or tentative, that ancient Macedonian belongs to the Northwest Greek group. A minority of scholars, however, continue to view the language as a separate Indo-European language related to but not part of the Greek language. Suggested classifications include:\n*A Greek dialect, part of the Northwest Doric group of dialects; pioneered by  (1808), and subsequently supported by Olivier Masson (1996), Michael Meier-Brügger (2003), Johannes Engels (2010), J. Méndez Dosuna (2012), Georgios Babiniotis (2014), Joachim Matzinger (2016), Georgios Giannakis (2017), Claude Brixhe (2018), M. B. Hatzopoulos (2017, 2020), Emilio Crespo (2017, 2023) and Lucien Van Beek (2022).\n*A Greek dialect related to, or a version of, Aeolic Greek; suggested by August Fick (1874), Otto Hoffmann (1906), N. G. L. Hammond (1997), Ian Worthington (2012) and Wojciech Sowa (2007, 2018, 2022).\n*A sister language of Greek, according to a scheme in which Macedonian and Greek are the two branches of a Greco-Macedonian subgroup, also called Hellenic (or Helleno-Macedonian) suggested by Georgiev (1966),Vladimir Georgiev, \"The Genesis of the Balkan Peoples\", The Slavonic and East European Review 44:103:285–297 (July 1966)\"Ancient Macedonian is closely related to Greek, and Macedonian and Greek are descended from a common Greek-Macedonian idiom that was spoken till about the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. From the 4th century BC on began the Hellenization of ancient Macedonian.\" W. B. Lockwood (1972), Joseph (2001) and Hamp (2013).\nAmong those who support that ancient Macedonian was a Greek dialect, Angelos Boufalis suggests that \"several features can be established as local and most of them seem indeed to be shared with the NW Doric and/or the Thessalian dialect\", and also that \"rather than a monolithic dialect throughout, different local or regional idioms may have had been spoken in this extensive geographical area\". Sowa suggests that \"it seems also possible that the inhabitants of the Lower Macedonia spoke an Aeolic dialect, and those from Upper Macedonia a north-western Greek dialect\". Hammond suggests that in the region of Upper Macedonia, the tribes of Elimiotes, Orestes, Lyncestae, and Pelagones, were all Epirotic tribes speaking the Northwest Greek dialect.\nProperties\nBecause of the fragmentary sources of Ancient Macedonian, only a little is understood about the special features of the language. A notable sound-law is that the voiced aspirates (/bʰ, dʰ, gʰ/) of Proto-Indo-European sometimes appear as voiced stops /b, d, g/, (written ), whereas they were generally unvoiced as /pʰ, tʰ, kʰ/ () elsewhere in Ancient Greek.\n*Macedonian  dánοs ('death', from PIE  'to leave'), compared to Attic\n*Macedonian  abroûtes or  abroûwes, compared to Attic   for 'eyebrows'\n*Macedonian  Bereníkē, compared to Attic  , 'bearing victory' (Personal name)\n*Macedonian  adraia ('bright weather'), compared to Attic  , from PIE\n*Macedonian  báskioi ('fasces'), compared to Attic   'leather sack', from PIE\n*According to Herodotus 7.73 (), the Macedonians claimed that the Phryges were called Bryges before they migrated from Thrace to Anatolia (around 8th–7th century BC).\n*According to Plutarch, Moralia Macedonians use 'b' instead of 'ph', while Delphians use 'b' in the place of 'p'.\n*Macedonian  mágeiros ('butcher') was a loan from Doric into Attic. Vittore Pisani has suggested an ultimately Macedonian origin for the word, which could then be cognate to   ('knife', h, *dh, *gh) into voiced stops (b, d, g) (e.g. Βερενίκα, Attic Φερενίκη)\n*Retention of /aː/ (e.g. Μαχάτας), also present in Epirotic\n*[aː] as a result of contraction between [aː] and [ɔː]\n*Apocope of short vowels in prepositions in synthesis (, Attic )\n*Syncope (hyphairesis) and diphthongization are used to avoid hiatus (e.g. , Attic ; compare with Epirotic , Doric ).\n*Occasional retention of the pronunciation [u] of /u(ː)/ in local cult epithets or nicknames ( = )\n*Raising of /ɔː/ to /uː/ in proximity to nasal (e.g. , Attic )\n*Simplification of the sequence /ign/ to /iːn/ (γίνομαι, Attic )\n*Loss of aspiration of the consonant cluster /sth/ (> /st/) (, Attic )\nMorphology\nAncient Macedonian morphology is shared with ancient Epirus, including some of the oldest inscriptions from Dodona. The morphology of the first declension nouns with an -ας ending is also shared with Thessalian (e.g. Epitaph for Pyrrhiadas, Kierion).\n*First-declension masculine and feminine in -ας and -α respectively (e.g. , )\n*First-declension masculine genitive singular in -α (e.g. )\n*First-declension genitive plural in -ᾶν\n*First person personal pronoun dative singular\n*Temporal conjunction\n*Possibly, a non-sigmatic nominative masculine singular in the first declension (, Attic )\nOnomastics\nAnthroponymy\nM. Hatzopoulos and Johannes Engels summarize the Macedonian anthroponymy (that is names borne by people from Macedonia before the expansion beyond the Axios or people undoubtedly hailing from this area after the expansion) as follows:\n*Epichoric (local) Greek names that either differ from the phonology of the introduced Attic or that remained almost confined to Macedonians throughout antiquity\n*Panhellenic (common) Greek names\n*Identifiable non-Greek (Thracian and Illyrian) names\n*Names without a clear Greek etymology that can't however be ascribed to any identifiable non-Greek linguistic group.\nCommon in the creation of ethnics is the use of -έστης, -εστός especially when derived from sigmatic nouns ( but also ).\nPer Engels, the above material supports that Macedonian anthroponymy was predominantly Greek in character.\nToponymy\nThe toponyms of Macedonia proper are generally Greek, though some of them show a particular phonology and a few others are non-Greek.\nCalendar\nThe Macedonian calendar's origins go back to Greek prehistory. The names of the Macedonian months, just like most of the names of Greek months, are derived from feasts and related celebrations in honor of the Greek gods. Most of them combine a Macedonian dialectal form with a clear Greek etymology (e.g  from Zeus;  from Heracles Peritas (\"Guardian\") ;  from Xanthos, \"the blond\" (probably a reference to Heracles);  from Artemis etc.) with the possible exception of one, which is attested in other Greek calendars as well. According to Martin P. Nilsson, the Macedonian calendar is formed like a regular Greek one and the names of the months attest the Greek nationality of the Macedonians.\nEpigraphy\nMacedonian onomastics: the earliest epigraphical documents attesting substantial numbers of Macedonian proper names are the second Athenian alliance decree with Perdiccas II (~417–413 BC), the decree of Kalindoia (~335–300 BC) and seven curse tablets of the 4th century BC bearing mostly names.\nOktadrachm of Alexander I 498 – 454 BCE.jpg|Octadrachm of Alexander I of Macedon, early 5th century B.C.\nCoin of Perdikas II - 451-413 BCE.jpg|Stater of Perdiccas II of Macedon, mid to late 5th century B.C.\nPellatab.jpg|The Pella curse tablet, 4th century B.C.\nAncient Greek binding spell, 4th century B.C., Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.jpg|Binding spell, 4th century B.C., Oraiokastro\nRelief inscribed stele, mid 4th century B.C., Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.jpg|Funerary stele, with an epigram on the top, mid 4th century B.C., Vergina\nAbout 99% of the roughly 6,300 inscriptions discovered by archaeologists within the confines of ancient Macedonia were written in the Greek language, using the Greek alphabet. The legends in all currently discovered coins also in Greek. The Pella curse tablet, a text written in a distinct Doric Greek dialect, found in 1986 and dated to between mid to early 4th century BC, has been forwarded as an argument that ancient Macedonian was a dialect of North-Western Greek, part of the Doric dialect group.\nHesychius' glossary\nA body of idiomatic words has been assembled from ancient sources, mainly from coin inscriptions, and from the 5th century lexicon of Hesychius of Alexandria, amounting to about 150 words and 200 proper names, though the number of considered words sometimes differs from scholar to scholar. The majority of these words can be confidently assigned to Greek albeit some words would appear to reflect a dialectal form of Greek. However, some words are not easily identifiable as Greek and reveal, for example, voiced stops where Greek shows voiceless aspirates.\nmarked words which have been corrupted.\n* [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2334 abagna] 'roses amaranta (unwithered)' (Attic  rhoda, Aeolic  broda roses).

AD 40 – 120s) presents Cleopatra (70/69 – 30 BC) as speaking many foreign languages, in contrast with her royal predecessors, some of whom had even ceased to \"Macedonise\" (, ).\nContributions to Koine Greek\nAs a consequence of the Macedonians' role in the formation of the Koine, Macedonian contributed considerable elements, unsurprisingly including some military terminology (, etc.). Among the many contributions were the general use of the first declension grammar for male and female nouns with an -as ending, attested in the genitive of Macedonian coinage from the early 4th century BC of Amyntas III ( in the genitive; the Attic form that fell into disuse would be ). There were changes in verb conjugation such as in the Imperative  attested in Macedonian sling stones found in Asiatic battlefields, that became adopted in place of the Attic forms. Koine Greek established a spirantisation of beta, gamma and delta, which has been attributed to the Macedonian influence.\nSee also\n*Ancient Greece\n*Government of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)\n*History of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)\n*Proto-Greek language\nNotes\nReferences\nInline\nGeneral\n*\n**\n**\n**\n**\n*\n*\n*\n**\n**\nFurther reading\n* Chadwick, John, The Prehistory of the Greek Language.
