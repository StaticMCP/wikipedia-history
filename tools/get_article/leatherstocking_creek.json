It begins northwest of Pierstown and flows southeast then south before flowing into Otsego Lake north of Cooperstown, and just south of Three Mile Point.\nThe historic Leatherstocking Falls also known as \"Panthers Leap\" and \"Deowongo Falls\", are located on this creek. These falls are where, in James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, Leatherstocking saves the life of an Indian maiden.\nReferences"
