The caves were formed around 10,000 to 6,000 years ago during an ice age when the weight of an advancing glacier forced the land downward, so the sea was higher relative to the location of the cave, with high tide around  up from its present level. When the ice melted, the land rose due to the isostatic rebound effect, thus forming a raised shoreline or raised beach with relict sea-cliffs. The hillside above the cliffs has a shallow slope resulting from a much earlier raised beach, nominally  above present high tide.\nKilmory Parish church records suggest the cave may have been used for church meetings in the eighteenth century, and it is also said to have been used as a school. Before being known as the King's Cave it was known as Fingal's Cave after Fionn mac Cumhaill, a figure in Irish mythology.\nThe current name of the cave is linked to the legend of Robert the Bruce seeking refuge in a cave where he is said to have been inspired by watching a spider's numerous and ultimately successful attempts to build a web, but this story is widely considered apocryphal.\nIn January 1909, an archeological dig was conducted within the cave. A 32 foot long trench was dug and examined, but aside from a small bronze ornament and some animal bones, nothing of interest was found, so the dig was halted on the fourth day.\nReferences"
