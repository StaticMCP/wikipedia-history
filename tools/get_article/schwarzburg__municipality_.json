The (now-ruined) castle was from the 12th century the seat of the Counts of Schwarzburg. Then Rudolstadt became seat of the new line of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.\nOn 11 August 1919, while on holiday in Schwarzburg, Friedrich Ebert, the first Reichspräsident of Germany, signed the Weimar constitution, the first democratic constitution of Germany.\nReferences"
