It was recorded over the space of 1998 to 2004 and released on April 26, 2005 through record label Vagrant, his first album on a new label following Eels' departure from DreamWorks Records.\nA 33-track double album, Blinking Lights has been seen as one of frontman E's most personal records, and was met with some of the strongest critical reviews of his career. The album features guest appearances by Tom Waits, Peter Buck and John Sebastian. It would also be the last album to feature the band's original drummer Jonathan \"Butch\" Norton.\nBackground\nEels frontman E described Blinking Lights on the official website as being about \"God and all the questions related to the subject of God. It's also about hanging on to my remaining shreds of sanity and the blue sky that comes the day after a terrible storm, and it's a love letter to life itself, in all its beautiful, horrible glory.\"\nThe sleeve and liner notes are composed of typewritten lyrics and family photos.\nRelease\nIn January 2005, it was reported that Eels had signed to Vagrant Records, who planned to release the band's next album later that year. The track listing and artwork was posted online on April 6, 2005. The album was released through Vagrant Records on April 26, 2005, following the dissolution of Eels' contract with DreamWorks Records and the label's eventual take-over by Universal Music Group. They played two shows in the US, before embarking on a tour of Europe in May and June 2005. They toured the US in May and 2006, prior to a Europe tour, which lasted until July 2006 and featured a performance at the Wireless Festival. In August 2006, they appeared at the Lollapalooza festival.\nOn October 21, 2008, the band announced that 2,500 autographed copies of the album would be published on vinyl. The songs were split across three records, with a fourth record serving as the bonus album Manchester 2005. The band made four of those tracks available as a free download for a week within announcing the album.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev2score = A\n| rev3 = The Guardian\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Los Angeles Times\n| rev4score =\n| rev5 = Mojo\n| rev5score =\n| rev6 = NME\n| rev6score = 8/10\n| rev7 = Pitchfork\n| rev7score = 6.5/10\n| rev8 = Q\n| rev8score =\n| rev9 = Rolling Stone\n| rev9score =\n| rev10 = Uncut\n| rev10score =\n}}\nBlinking Lights and Other Revelations was met with critical acclaim.
