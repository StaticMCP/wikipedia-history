They are awarded every two years, and named in honour of Samuel Sarphati, a Dutch sanitation engineer. They were created by World Waternet, the Netherlands Water Partnership and Aqua for All, and are endorsed by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its Directorate-General for International Cooperation.
