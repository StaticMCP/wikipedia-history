      "text": "# New Zealand Warmblood Horse Association\n\nThe New Zealand Warmblood Horse Association has the objective is to produce a warmblood horse that is noble, correctly built, with good rideability and superior performance.\nOriginally, the NZWHA started in 1978 as the Hanoverian Breeders Association, and the first stallions were imported with a Hanoverian background. A year later, the NZWHA was incorporated and the first stallions were of a Hanoverian or KWPN (Dutch Warmblood) background. Early stallions who had a major influence were Witzbold, Jaguar, Falkensee, Loewenherz and later Anamour and Dream Boy.\nToday, there are a larger number of imported stallions available that are approved by the NZWHA.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/warmbloodhorses/ NZWHA website]\n* [http://www.nzhanoverian.com/ New Zealand Hanoverian website]\n* [http://www.DutchHorsesUnlimited.com/ Dutch Horses in New Zealand]\n* [http://www.KWPN.nl/ Royal Dutch Sporthorse]"
