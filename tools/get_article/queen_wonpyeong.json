As well as the younger sister of Queen Wonhye and Queen Wonseong.\nShe was born into the Ansan Kim clan as the youngest daughter of Kim Un-bu and Lady Yi, daughter of Yi Ho-gyom () from the Gyeongwon Yi clan. Her father, Kim Unbu,  was a person who passionately supported Hyeonjong when he fled from the pursuing Khitans, so Hyeonjong reciprocated it by forging ties with the Ansan Kim clan. For this reason, Kim Un-bu's youngest daughter received considerable respect.\nIn 1022 (13th year of the reign of King Hyeonjong), after the death of her second older sister, Queen Wonseong, Kim entered the palace and became Hyeonjong's seventh wife. They then had a daughter, Princess Hyogyeong () in 1026. Although her death date was unknown, it seems that she died around 1028 or before since she received her posthumous name \"Wonpyeong\" () in 1028 and buried in Uireung Tomb ().\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://db.history.go.kr/KOREA/search/searchResult.do?sort=levelId&dir=ASC&limit=20&page=1&pre_page=1&codeIds=PERIOD-0-3&searchTermImages=%EC%9B%90%ED%8F%89%EC%99%95%ED%9B%84%C2%A0&searchKeywordType=BI&searchKeywordMethod=EQ&searchKeyword=%EC%9B%90%ED%8F%89%EC%99%95%ED%9B%84&searchKeywordConjunction=AND#searchDetail/kr/kr_088r_0010_0560/3/0/3/r Queen Wonpyeong] on Goryeosa .\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0040883 Queen Wonpyeong] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013001003403 원평왕후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
