Following the demise of the GOFTA awards, the Screen Directors Guild of New Zealand founded the New Zealand Screen Awards to honour excellence in New Zealand film and television. Due to there having been no film awards in 2004, the eligibility period was from 1 October 2003 to July 2005. In the weeks ahead of the awards presentation, sponsor SkyCity screened a series of nominated short films. The film In My Father's Den was nominated in all 12 of the feature film award categories and won 10 awards.\nNominees and Winners\nNo finalists were selected for the Feature Film categories
