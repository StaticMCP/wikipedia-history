Ballot tracking reports updates in the ballot's delivery and processing. This allows the voter to know when they will receive their ballot, if their ballot has been successfully delivered, and if their ballot has been successfully counted.\nMethods\nAll states send ballots with unique numbers linked to the voter. US Postal Service scans this number and sends its status to the voter or third-party tracking service, depending on the state.\nAll voters can choose to be notified by USPS's Informed Delivery Service to track delivery of their ballot to their address.\nVoters can then go to their state's tracking website where they enter personal information, like address, DOB to find the status of their ballot.\nSome states, such as California, automatically send ballot status updates to all voters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Tracking websites by state (2020)\n!State\n!Link\n!Can notify users\n|-\n|Alabama\n|https://myinfo.alabamavotes.gov/voterview\n|\n|-\n|Alaska\n|https://myvoterportal.alaska.gov\n|\n|-\n|Arizona\n|https://my.arizona.vote/AbsenteeTracker.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Arkansas\n|https://www.voterview.ar-nova.org/VoterView\n|\n|-\n|California\n|https://california.ballottrax.net/voter/\n|\n|-\n|Colorado\n|https://colorado.ballottrax.net/voter/\n|\n|-\n|Connecticut\n|https://portaldir.ct.gov/sots/LookUp.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Delaware\n|https://ivote.de.gov/VoterView\n|\n|-\n|District of Columbia\n|https://www.dcboe.org/Voters/Absentee-Voting/Track-Absentee-Ballot\n|\n|-\n|Florida\n|https://registration.elections.myflorida.com/CheckVoterStatus\n|\n|-\n|Georgia\n|https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp.do\n|\n|-\n|Hawaii\n|https://ballotstatus.hawaii.gov/ballotreceipt\n|\n|-\n|Idaho\n|https://elections.sos.idaho.gov/ElectionLink/ElectionLink/VoterSearch.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Illinois\n|https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/ElectionAuthorities.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Indiana\n|https://indianavoters.in.gov/\n|\n|-\n|Iowa\n|https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/absenteeballotstatus/absentee/search\n|\n|-\n|Kansas\n|https://myvoteinfo.voteks.org/voterview/\n|\n|-\n|Kentucky\n|https://vrsws.sos.ky.gov/VIC/\n|\n|-\n|Louisiana\n|https://voterportal.sos.la.gov/Home/VoterLogin\n|\n|-\n|Maine\n|https://apps.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/AbsenteeBallot/ballot-status.pl\n|\n|-\n|Maryland\n|https://voterservices.elections.maryland.gov/VoterSearch\n|\n|-\n|Massachusetts\n|https://www.sec.state.ma.us/wheredoivotema/track/trackmyballot.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Michigan\n|https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/Voter/Index\n|\n|-\n|Minnesota\n|https://mnvotes.sos.state.mn.us/AbsenteeBallotStatus.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Mississippi\n|https://www.sos.ms.gov/Elections-Voting/Pages/default.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Missouri\n|https://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/goVoteMissouri/localelectionauthority\n|\n|-\n|Montana\n|https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/\n|\n|-\n|Nebraska\n|https://www.votercheck.necvr.ne.gov/voterview\n|\n|-\n|Nevada\n|https://www.nvsos.gov/votersearch/\n|\n|-\n|New Hampshire\n|https://app.sos.nh.gov/Public/AbsenteeBallot.aspx\n|\n|-\n|New Jersey\n|https://www.nj.gov/state/elections/vote-track-my-ballot.shtml\n|\n|-\n|New Mexico\n|https://voterportal.servis.sos.state.nm.us/WhereToVote.aspx\n|\n|-\n|New York\n|https://nysballot.elections.ny.gov/TrackMyBallot/Search\n|\n|-\n|North Carolina\n|https://northcarolina.ballottrax.net/voter/\n|\n|-\n|North Dakota\n|https://vip.sos.nd.gov/AbsenteeTracker.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Ohio\n|https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/voters/toolkit/ballot-tracking/\n|\n|-\n|Oklahoma\n|https://okvoterportal.okelections.us/\n|\n|-\n|Oregon\n|https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/vr/showVoterSearch.do\n|\n|-\n|Pennsylvania\n|https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/ballottracking.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Rhode Island\n|https://vote.sos.ri.gov/Home/UpdateVoterRecord?ActiveFlag=3\n|\n|-\n|South Carolina\n|https://info.scvotes.sc.gov/eng/voterinquiry/VoterInformationRequest.aspx?PageMode=AbsenteeInfo\n|\n|-\n|South Dakota\n|https://vip.sdsos.gov/VIPLogin.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Tennessee\n|https://tnmap.tn.gov/voterlookup/\n|\n|-\n|Texas\n|https://webservices.sos.state.tx.us/FPCA/index.aspx\n|\n|-\n|Utah\n|https://votesearch.utah.gov/voter-search/search/search-by-voter/track-mail-ballot\n|\n|-\n|Vermont\n|https://mvp.vermont.gov/\n|\n|-\n|Virginia\n|https://www.elections.virginia.gov/citizen-portal/\n|\n|-\n|Washington\n|https://voter.votewa.gov/WhereToVote.aspx\n|\n|-\n|West Virginia\n|https://services.sos.wv.gov/Elections/Voter/AbsenteeBallotTracking\n|\n|-\n|Wisconsin\n|https://myvote.wi.gov/en-US/TrackMyBallot\n|\n|-\n|Wyoming\n|https://sos.wyo.gov/Elections/Docs/WYCountyClerks_AbsRequest_VRChange.pdf\n|\n|}\nMailed ballots in 2020\nAs of Sept. 2020, 51 million US voters choose to have their ballot mailed, 49 million have their ballot application automatically mailed, 99 million can vote by mail, and 34 million can vote by mail for disabilities.\nIn the 2020 elections, 65 million voters used mail in voting.\nFunctions\nBallot Scout, Ballot TRACE, TrackMyVote, and BallotTrax all have online portals where users can type in their voter information to see the status of their ballot.\nBallotTrax uses a notification system to notify their users by text and email when their ballot will be arriving.\nAdvantages\nBallot tracking helps under-staffed voting offices run smoother. Ballot tracking allows offices to expect and look out for lost ballots. Ballot tracking notifies users for improperly filled-out ballots.\nServices\nBallotTrax\nBallotTrax (ballottrax.com) was developed by Denver based development company i3Logix. As of August 2020, their websites boasts BallotTrax as \"The World's First Complete Mail Ballot Locator & Notification System\". States such as North Carolina and California have begun using BallotTrax to notify voters of their ballot status.\nBallotTrax grew 10x in 2020.\nAs of 2020, BallotTrax is the largest ballot tracking service.\nBallotTrax was used by 25 states in the 2020 election. It is estimated they have helped track 60 million ballots since 2009.\nBallot TRACE\nChanges in Colorado law caused an increase in voters who chose to vote by mail in the November 3, 2009 election. This prompted Colorado to create a simple version of a ballot tracking service which allowed voters to look up their ballot and see if their local county election official had received it.\nThey entered into a partnership with i3Logix, along with the USPS to create a system named i3Ballot, which was renamed to the more friendly, recognizable Ballot TRACE.\nTrackMyVote\nHosted by trackmymail.com, TrackMyVote is an Absentee Ballot Tracking service with which, you can track your ballot to and from the voting official's office to add accountability in the vote-by-mail process.\nBallot Scout\nCreated by non-profit Democracy Works their website democracy.works/ballot-scout claims to help USPS use intelligent mail barcodes to absentee ballots. With this and their notification network, they give voters and officials updates on their ballot's status.\nReferences"
