Directed, produced, and written by Andrew Goldberg, this documentary, hosted by Judy Woodruff, examines the roots of modern antisemitism and why it flourishes today. The program explores why attacks on Jews in Europe have more than doubled since the 1990s, and its connections to the Arab–Israeli conflict.\nThe purpose of the program is to explore the origins of antisemitism and why it has surged in recent times. It mainly focuses on antisemitism in the Muslim world and its connections to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. It explores the history of Islamic antisemitism from pre-Zionism as well as how it has grown since the creation of Israel. The film also explores the similarities between modern Muslim antisemitism and antisemitism in Europe before World War II.\nThe New York Times noted that the film covered how Hitler promised the Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, that he would \"remove the Jews from Palestine\". The film described how a 2003 Syrian-made television series Ash-Shatat promoted antisemitic tropes. The narrator refuted the common claim that Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights and the West Bank after 1967 brought Arab leaders to call for Israel's destruction, noting that such calls were commonplace \"even before the occupation\".\nSee also\n* Anti-Zionism\n* New antisemitism\n* Antisemitism during the Gaza war\n* Timeline of antisemitism in the 21st century\n* Timeline of antisemitism in the 20th century\n* Antisemitism in Islam\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wgbh.org/schedules/program-info?program_id=3109057&episode_id=3109059 WGBH programs]- entry on  Anti-Semitism in the 21st Century: The Resurgence\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173402/http://www.shoppbs.org/sm-pbs-anti-semitism-in-the-21st-century-the-resurgence-dvd--pi-2594886.html Shop PBS sales- entry for the documentary]\n* [http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=17042 Jewish Journal.com review]\n* [http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=3&x_outlet=18&x_article=1281 FILM REVIEW: \"Anti-Semitism in the 21st Century: The Resurgence\"] by CAMERA\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/08/arts/television/08cent.html New York Times review]\n* [http://www.twocatstv.com/anti-semitism/antisem21sttrailer.php Trailer to the documentary]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071216185911/http://www.twocatstv.com/anti-semitism/ Two Cats Productions entry on the documentary]"
