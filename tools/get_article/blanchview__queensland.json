It became Monkey Waterholes State School in 1909 and was renamed Blanch View State School in 1913.  Blanchview State School closed in 1965. The school was on a  reserve within present-day 358 Blanchview Road. The site is marked by a plaque (). The school building was relocated to another site and is used as a farm building.\nMonkey Waterholes Methodist Church opened on the weekend of 2-3 December 1899, although Primitive Methodist services had been held in the district (probably in private homes) since at least 1895.  The church was at 327 Blanchview Road (corner Church Road, ). Services were advertised at the church until 1933. Later it passed into private ownership and was converted into a residence.\nDemographics\nIn the , Blanchview had a population of 229 people.\nIn the , Blanchview had a population of 191 people.\nIn the , Blanchview had a population of 202 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Blanchview.
