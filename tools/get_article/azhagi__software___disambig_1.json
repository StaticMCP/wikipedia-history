In 2002, The Hindu dubbed Azhagi as a tool that \"stand[s] out\" among various similar software \"emerg[ing] nearly every other day\". Since year 2000, Azhagi has provided support for Tamil transliteration; this was later expanded to nearly 13 Indian languages, featuring 16 total built-in languages as of the day of writing.\nIn 2006, Azhagi was the recipient of the Manthan Award of India's Digital Empowerment Foundation and the World Summit Award project, in the category Localization. In the same year Azhagi was identified as a \"success story\" by Microsoft's [https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/bhashaindia/ Bhashaindia.com] Indic language computing site.\nFeatures\nAzhagi is the first successful Tamil transliteration tool which has many users throughout the world. Azhagi helps the user to create and edit contents in several Indian languages including Tamil, Hindi, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, Bengali, Punjabi, Oriya and Assamese without having to know how to type in these languages. Text of these languages can be produced only typing the phonetic equivalent of English. Azhagi can be embedded for direct typing text of these languages in applications apart from Notepad, including Microsoft products like MS Office, OpenOffice.org and also other applications all the web browsers.\nAzhagi initially developed as a Tamil word processor having its own screen for typing contents in Tamil. The user can optionally select a dual screen or a single screen for transliteration. The Tamil text corresponding to the English text forming the phonetic equivalent of Tamil typed in the upper half of the screen is displayed in the lower half. This feature enables the user to ascertain the correctness of contents being typed. The single screen option can be chosen by users who have become familiar with the key mappings to be able to see larger portion of text than that seen in dual screen mode.\nThe mapping summary that lists the English alphabets to be typed to get every Tamil alphabet is presented in the form of a concise table in the Azhagi Screen. This guides the new user who is yet to become familiar with the key mappings in finding the correct for every alphabet. The text displayed in Azhagi screen is with TSCII encoding. A Unicode editor for typing Tamil text in UTF-8 encoding with a separate display screen comes together with Azhagi.\nAzhagi has another novel application known as Azhagi+ that enables wider range of settings and options to the user.\n# Azhagi+ Enables typing in Indic languages in Windows XP in MS-Word, it doesn't require to enable Unicode explicitly.\n# It gives Portable Support so that one can use it from pen-drive itself\n# One can have one's own hotkey for any  LFK (Language + Font + Keyboard Layout combination) (no need to be dependent on F10 which may not work in laptops if function key configurations are changed)\n# There is Dynamic in-built help for keymappings of all languages (no need to refer online help pages)\n# One can change existing key mappings in any manner for any LFK (Language + Font + Keyboard Layout combination) in an easy and straightforward manner - quite unique among the Indic computing\n# One can create one's own keyboard layout for any LFK.\nAndroid Version\nIn 2016, Azhagi has launched the Mobile App for Android users with the custom transliteration feature. Though this app is created based on Indic Keyboard, it supports both the transliteration and transcription.\nDevelopment team\nB.
