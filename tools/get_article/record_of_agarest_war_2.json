It was published in Japan by Compile Heart on November 18, 2010 for the PlayStation 3. A Windows version was released on February 19, 2015. It is the sequel to the 2007 game Record of Agarest War and the third game in the series.\nA patch via download allows for use of a PlayStation Move motion controller for certain mini-games.\nThe Soul Breeding system receives a new additional feature with the implementation of a \"Dark Love\" ending which occurs if the relationship rate is low with the chosen mate. Rather than a happy wedding, the main character has a marriage with his bride for political interests and enters a loveless relationship to conceive a child, resulting in poor stats for the next protagonist.\nPlot\nOne day, the world was enveloped by a mysterious blinding light. The destruction it caused was terrible, even as the light itself was sublime in its beauty, and it made those who witnessed the awesome display think of the unrestrained rage and fury of the divine.\nThe central continent, from where the light is believed to have originated from, went silent, while at the same time demons began to spread throughout the world like a plague. Amongst the survivors of the catastrophe, that fateful day became known as the \"Day of Light.\"\nSometime after the events of the Day of Light, a young man by the name of Weiss, who had lost all memory of himself, encounters an enigmatic woman named Eva, who introduces herself as an Agent of the Divine. It is from her that Weiss learns that he has committed the grievous sin of deicide, and that in order for him to atone for his crime he is to become the \"Vessel\" in which the power of the divinity he had slaughtered will be stored. For it will be that power that will be used to resurrect the one whose life he stole.\nFor those who betray the divine will pay for their sins in the space which separates salvation and damnation, as will their progeny...\nGameplay\nDifferences/Improvements\nThere are many changes and improvements from the original Agarest games.\n*There are only 3 generations in this game.\n*There are 18 members in this game: 7 in the First Generation, 6 in the Second Generation and 5 in the Third Generation.\n*Featured in the game Trinity Universe, Agarest uses the AAA (Active Animation Adventure) system.
