The clashes have been described as a \"turf war\".\nBackground\nSince 2016, ISWAP and Boko Haram have been in a territorial conflict over influence in the Lake Chad region. ISWAP has held these islands since 2021.\nBattle\nBetween 5 and 8 November 2025, Boko Haram fighters launched a naval invasion against ISWAP bases across the various islands in Lake Chad. The attacks were led by Hassan Buduma and Mohd Hassan and used dozens of fighters armed with heavy weapons on motorised boats. Clashes left at least 4 Boko Haram attackers dead and 170–200 ISWAP members killed.\nBoko Haram successfully seized several ISWAP bases and their weaponry, surviving militants retreated to their mainland positions in the villages of Ali Jillimari, Metele, Kangarwa, and Gudumbali in northern Borno State, Nigeria. Only three of ISWAP’s boats managed to escape, seven others were captured alongside their arms and ammunition.\nAftermath\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the Nigerian Air Force launched a series of airstrikes on ISWAP positions on 9 November, targeting the Lake Chad Basin, as well as several other states in northern Nigeria.\nSee also\n* Battle of Sambisa Forest\nNotes\nReferences"
