Although he was respected in antiques, specialising in 18th-century literature, and worked as a director and rare book expert for the booksellers Elkin Mathews alongside his brother Robert, he remained impecunious, largely living off his elder brother, John David Gathorne-Hardy, 4th Earl of Cranbrook. He also worked at various colleges and for the British Council.\nAfter 1935, he lived in Athens, Cairo and Lebanon. He died aged 77 on 18 June 1978.\nGathorne-Hardy's sister, Anne (1911–2006), was the wife of George Heywood Hill, owner of the Mayfair bookshop bearing his name. A nephew- son of his younger brother Anthony- was Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview2 Article on the Bright Young People] by D.
