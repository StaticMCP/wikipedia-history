It was designed by Robin Day in 1963 for S. Hille & Co. It is now so iconic that it was selected as one of eight designs in a 2009 series of British stamps of \"British Design Classics\".\nThe polypropylene stacking chair is one of the very few chairs that, after over 50 years, is still in production and has been manufactured in forty countries around the world, for use in schools, hospitals, airports, canteens, restaurants, arenas, hotels, as well as homes. It is the best-selling chair in the world.\nHistory\nThe chair first appeared on the market in a choice of charcoal or flame-red colours at a price of just under £3. The side chair won a Council of Industrial Design (now the Design Council) award in 1965.\nThe brief from Hille was for a low-cost, mass-produced stacking chair that would be affordable to all and meet virtually every seating requirement. Over time, it became available in a wide variety of colours and with different forms of base and upholstery. These variations have included Series E for children, made in five sizes with lifting holes, and Polo, which features rows of graduated circular holes, making it suitable for outdoor use.\nMass production\nThe one-piece seat and back were injection moulded from polypropylene, a lightweight thermoplastic with a high impact resistance. Polypropylene was invented by an Italian scientist, Giulio Natta, in 1954.\nExamples of the 1973 polypropylene stacking chair can be seen at Clifton Cathedral, Bristol, where it is used for the Nave and Sanctuary seating.\nSee also\n* Monobloc (chair)\nReferences"
