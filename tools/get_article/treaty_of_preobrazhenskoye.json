It followed an informal meeting of Peter and Augustus at Rava-Ruska in August 1698. The treaty called for the partition of the Swedish Empire among Denmark-Norway, Russia, Saxony and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following the treaty, the Great Northern War began.\nSources\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722015850/http://www.ieg-mainz.de/likecms/index.php?site=site.htm&dir=&nav=&siteid=133&treaty=771&lastsiteid=77&searchquery=&is_fts=1&filter_select=&filter_wt=&filter_id=&filter_l=&filter_p=&searchlang=de&searchstring=1699&date=&year_from=&year_till=&location= Scan of the treaty at IEG Mainz]"
