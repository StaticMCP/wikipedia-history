The program was approved July 31, 2006 by then-Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Mullen.\nThe qualification was developed to provide a chance for enlisted sailors in the naval service's Expeditionary Combat community (those serving in a maritime security or combat related role) to earn a warfare qualification. Core qualification skills will include weapons qualification and maintenance, marksmanship, land navigation, patrolling, field communications, and expeditionary camp deployment.\nThe first awardee was Petty Officer 2nd Class (EXW/SW) Carl P. Hurtt, Jr, assigned to Mobile Security Squadron Seven (MSS-7).\nTypes of Expeditionary Warfare Specialist Qualification Platforms\nNavy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) units, including:\n* Maritime Expeditionary Security Groups / Squadrons\n* Navy Expeditionary Intelligence Command (NEIC)\n* Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Units\n* Naval Mobile Construction Battalions\n* Mobile Diving and Salvage Units\n* Navy Expeditionary Logistics units (includes Navy Cargo Handling Battalions, Navy Expeditionary Logistic Regiments, NAVELSG, and Expeditionary Communications Detachments)\nNaval Special Warfare units.\nBreast insignia\n.]]\nThe design of the new pin encompasses the essence of enlisted expeditionary sailors, presenting the bow and superstructure of a Sea Ark 34' patrol boat from Inshore Boat Units superimposed upon a crossed cutlass and M16A1 rifle.  The waves represent the Navy's heritage, the cutlass represents the enlisted force, the M16A1 represents an NECC mission area and the boat, another NECC mission area. The background is the traditional ocean swells of the Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist badge.\nSee also\n*List of United States Navy enlisted warfare designations\n*Badges of the United States Navy\n*Badges of the United States Coast Guard\n*Port Security Unit\n*Uniforms of the United States Navy\n*Military badges of the United States\n*Naval Coastal Warfare\n*Mobile Inshore Undersea Warfare Unit\n*Maritime Expeditionary Security Force\n*Expeditionary warfare\nReferences"
