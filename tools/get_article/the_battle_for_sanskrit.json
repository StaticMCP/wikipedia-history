Sanskrit texts and frames a rebuttal from within the traditions of Tarka sastra. Lamenting the increasing hold of Western thoughtschools even among Indian indologists, historians, and journalists, he urges for the mainstreaming of \"traditional indigenous\" approaches. In a review, Bibek Debroy commended Malhotra for exhorting the need of alternative paradigms in Indology notwithstanding the polemics against Pollock.\nThe book found support in the Hindu Right; it was cited in a petition urging for the removal of Sheldon Pollock from the editorship of the Murty Classical Library of India.\nSee also\n* Sheldon Pollock\n* Rajiv Malhotra\n* Breaking India\n* Invading the Sacred\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* McComas Taylor, [https://asaa.asn.au/tigers-vs-goats-rajiv-malhotras-battle-for/ Tigers vs goats: Rajiv Malhotra’s battle for Sanskrit], Asian Currents, Asian Studies Association of Australia, 14 August 2015."
