Controversy exists as to whether they were an independent tribe or rather consisted of a subgroup of the Wergaia, the latter view being shared by both Robert M. W. Dixon and Luise Hercus.\nName\nThe ethnonym seems to derive from their word for \"no\" (warki=warka), though the name itself, warkawarka or wargawarga may be a variant of the ethnonym for the Wergaia.\nCountry\nThe Warkawarka tribal lands extended over approximately , from Tyrrell Creek and Lake Tyrrell, southwards to Warracknabeal and Birchip. Their western boundary lay along Hopetoun, and they also ranged over the Morton Plains.\nAlternative names\n* Booroung, Boorong\n* Mirdiragoort\n* Waikywaiky\n* Weki-weki\n* Wengenmarongeitch\n* Werkawerka\n* Wirtu, Wirtoo\nSome words\n* wirtu (man)\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
