The Mission High School men's soccer team won the state championship Edwards' junior and senior seasons.  Edwards attended the University of Washington, playing on the men's soccer team from 1994 to 1997.  In 1995 and 1997, he also played for the Spokane Shadow during the collegiate off-season.\nProfessional career\nIn April 1998, Edwards turned professional with the Seattle Sounders of the USL A-League.  In February 1999, the Sounders traded Edwards to the Bay Area Seals for Bill May.  Edwards spent two seasons with the Seals.  In August 2000, the Seals sent him on loan to the San Jose Earthquakes for a game against the Los Angeles Galaxy.  In November 2000, the Seals withdrew from the league.  In 2001, Edwards returned to the Sounders as a free agent.  From that point on, he became one of the team's leaders in all-time minutes played and was voted to Team of the Week numerous times.  He remained with Seattle until his retirement after the 2005 season.  That year, the Sounders won the league title against the Richmond Kickers.\nOver 40s career\nIn 2017 Edwards joined North Tam United in the Marin Over-40s league.  Edwards is rapidly building a reputation in the league as a tough-tackling and free-scoring box-to-box midfielder. Great things are expected of Edwards as he matures.\nCoaching career\nDuring his years with the Sounders, Edwards served as an assistant coach with Bellevue Community College.  In 2006, Edwards became an assistant coach to the Saint Mary's College of California men's soccer team.\nPersonal life\nEdwards resides in Marin County, California, with his wife, Carly.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.marinsoccer.com/marin/scores.php?op=show&div=40 Marin Over 40s Soccer League]"
