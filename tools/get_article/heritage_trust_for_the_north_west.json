In 1996 Lancashire Heritage Trust merged with the North West Buildings Preservation Trust which had similar aims and enlarged its remit to cover the North West of England, a requirement of the Charity Commission. Subsequently, the trust has developed projects in Manchester, Liverpool and Cumbria.\nThe aim of the trust is to restore and find new and appropriate uses for historic buildings and encourage good design and craftsmanship. It has retained some of the buildings it has restored to provide funding for further projects. Others are open to the public forming a network of historic places.\nUp to October 2006 the trust's headquarters were in Barrowford, a building which is now the Pendle Heritage Centre, founded in 1977, and one of the trust's flagship projects. The heritage centre attracts over 100,000 visitors a year.  Since October 2006 the trust's headquarters are at Higherford Mill, a Grade II listed building owned by the trust and restored as a centre for creative industries.\nOrganisational structure\nThe trust compromises of seven trustees which is chaired by John Turner. In 2023 the trust appointed a new CEO, Michael Guy.\nBuildings within the trust\nThe trust is involved with projects and buildings including:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=\"160\"|Building Name!!width=\"180\"|Town !!width=\"220\"|Use & Reference\n|-\n|25-27 Church Street || Slaidburn || Unknown/ Residential\n|-\n|25 Wallgate || Wigan || BRIDGFORDS LTD\n|-\n|Bank Hall || Bretherton ||Former derelict manor house, restored 2017-2021.
