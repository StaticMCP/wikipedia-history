I expected big things from these boys, and they certainly delivered.\"\nA staff writer from The Music gave the album 4 out of 5 said \"they could easily fall into a straight forward radio rock trap, overuse their olden day influences and become the next Wolfmother, they instead opt to put as many twists and turns in as possible while maintaining a cohesive edge to their music that is utterly enjoyable\"\nNicholas Jones from Tone Deaf said \"The 13-track long-player sees the quartet explore a plethora of sounds, from dry desert tunes to wailing blues, mind-bending psychedelica and space-rock atmospherics, surprising mournful piano ballads to punk rock ferocities, Microscopic Wars confidently offers a sonic slice for any palate.\"\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Chart performance for Microscopic Wars\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Release history for Microscopic Wars\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"5\"| Australia\n| 22 August 2014\n| rowspan=\"1\"|\n| rowspan=\"4\"| Dew Process\n| DEW9000690\n|-\n| November 2014\n| rowspan=\"1\"|\n| DEW9000705\n|-\n| 2015\n| rowspan=\"1\"|\n| DEW76266\n|-\n| 2022\n| rowspan=\"1\"|\n| DEW9001327\n|-\n| August 2024\n| rowspan=\"1\"|\n| Kingswood\n| KW202400001\n|}\nReferences"
