It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) at least once every five years by the first-past-the-post electoral system.\nFurther to the completion of the 2023 review of Westminster constituencies, the seat was abolished. Subject to boundary changes, including the addition of the villages of Anlaby, Willerby and Kirk Ella, it was replaced by Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice, first contested in the 2024 general election.\nHistory\nThe constituency was created in 1997, mostly from the former seat of Kingston upon Hull West as Hessle joined from the former seat of Beverley.\nBoundaries\n|frame=yes|text=Map of boundaries 1997–2024}}\nThis seat contained the wards of Boothferry, Derringham, Myton, Newington, Pickering, and St Andrew's in the City of Kingston upon Hull and Hessle in the District of East Riding of Yorkshire.\nConstituency profile\nDespite its name, the constituency covered most of Kingston upon Hull's inner city, a deprived area undergoing regeneration. The area still has some way to go before it is fully restored to healthy economic life, and unemployment remains high; this has not been helped by the declining fishing industry. Hessle is a quiet suburb to the west, conservative by nature and having little in common with its larger neighbour apart from mostly working-class roots.\nIn 2005, The Guardian described the seat as a \"City centre and fishing port of isolated, rather grim east coast town.\"\nMembers of Parliament\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 1997\n| Alan Johnson\n| Labour\n|-\n|style=\"color:inherit;background-color: \" |\n| 2017\n| Emma Hardy\n| Labour\n|-\n|\n| 2024 ||colspan=\"2\"|Constituency abolished\n|}\nElection results 1997–2024\nElections in the 1990s\n}}\nElections in the 2000s\n}}\n}}\nElections in the 2010s\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n* Due to a transcription error when declaring the results, the Green Party were initially said to have received 50 votes. However, it later became clear that city council officials had 'lost' 510 Green Party votes. They polled 560 votes.\nSee also\n*Parliamentary constituencies in Humberside\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/13177.html Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle UK Parliament constituency] (boundaries April 1997 – April 2010) at MapIt UK\n*[https://mapit.mysociety.org/area/65984.html Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle UK Parliament constituency] (boundaries April 2010 – May 2024) at MapIt UK"
