It focuses on creating a clean and simple way to join and interact with BOINC. GridRepublic was started with a mission to raise public awareness and participation in volunteer computing with BOINC. GridRepublic was formed in 2004 by Matthew Blumberg as a mechanism to control the multiple projects from one place. The code for the BOINC software had to be redesigned to allow for the Account Manager system to be implemented.\nGridRepublic's website has won numerous awards including being named finalist at the 2007 SXSW Interactive Festival and the 2008 Stockholm Challenge.  GridRepublic has also been the recipients of a Google Grant allowing for advertising through Google.\nProjects\nGridRepublic supports a wide range of the BOINC projects. The list of supported projects and the development status of projects are periodically updated.\nSome of its popular projects include:\n; Climateprediction.net : Climate change modeling on personal computers\n; Einstein@home : Pulsar stars from LIGO and GEO data\n; Rosetta@home : Protein folding research\n; SETI@home : Searching radio and light data for signs of intelligent life\nSoftware\nGridRepublic is a non-profit organisation, an online application, and software.  The software is open source and a customized version of BOINC.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
