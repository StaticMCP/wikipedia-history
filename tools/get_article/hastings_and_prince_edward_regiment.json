The regiment is part of 33 Canadian Brigade Group, one of four brigade groups of 4th Canadian Division. The regimental headquarters and one company (A&nbsp;Company, Assoro Company) are at 187 Pinnacle Street in Belleville and on Willmott Street in Cobourg, with another rifle company in Peterborough. The Peterborough Armoury houses what was traditionally B&nbsp;Company or Moro Company. Moro Company also serves as the headquarters for the regiment’s Assault Pioneer Platoon. Normally, the regiment deploys as a composite, Ortona Company, while the headquarters and administration form Somme Company.\nIn 2017, the Canadian Army assigned the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment the mission task to raise, train, and maintain the assault pioneer combat support capability within the 4th Canadian Division. Since taking on the task, the regiment has trained more assault pioneers than any other unit outside of the Canadian Army’s Combat Training Centre. Hasty P assault pioneers have deployed on training exercises with the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Canadian Regiment and overseas on Operation Unifier.\nThe commanding officer is Lieutenant-Colonel Angelo Manzara, who took over from Lieutenant-Colonel Marc Gallant on 11 May 2023. Commanding officers normally hold the position for a term of three years. The regimental sergeant major is Chief Warrant Officer Roderick McNeil. The colonel-in-chief is Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, who visited the regiment in June 2005 and received a guard of honour from the regiment during his visit to Old Fort Henry in Kingston in June 2008.\nLineage\nFile:Hast and PER regt colour.jpg|The regimental colour of the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment.\nFile:Hast and PER camp flag.jpg|The camp flag of The Hastings and Prince Edward

This is to commemorate the unit's participation in the landings in Sicily on 10 July 1943 as part of Operation HUSKY.\nIn the Warrant Officers' & Sergeants' Mess in Belleville, the footprints of commanding officers can be found on the ceiling of the games room.  After a change of command, a pyramid is formed with junior officers on the bottom to hoist the new CO up to the ceiling to make his mark.\nThe former regimental colour was stolen from its case in the Belleville Armouries in 1960.  The staff for it was laid up with the queen's colour at Saint Mary Magdalene Anglican Church in Picton on 4 October 1964.  The CO at the time, Lieutenant-Colonel Angus Duffy, refused to wear his cap badge after the theft up until his death, as the colours were his personal responsibility.  The former regimental colour has never been located. The current colours were granted to the regiment in 1970.\nNotable soldiers\n*Sir Mackenzie Bowell: the fifth prime minister of Canada, served during the Fenian raids as a captain with the 15th Argyll Light Infantry and later retired from a long career with the Canadian Militia in 1874 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the 49th (Hastings) Battalion of Rifles (a founding regiment.)\n*Private Harold Joseph Pringle: the only soldier of the Canadian Army to be executed for a service offence during the Second World War and was also the last Canadian soldier to be executed. He was executed by firing squad.\n*Canadian Author Farley Mowat: served as a platoon commander and as the regiment's intelligence officer during the Second World War. He authored four books about the regiment and his experiences during the war: The Regiment, And No Birds Sang, ''My Fathers' Son and Aftermath''. Mowat left with the rank of captain.\n*Lieutenant General Howard Douglas Graham: Commanded the regiment from 1940 to 1941 and was later Chief of the General Staff of the Canadian Army from 1955 to 1958.\n*Golf course architect Geoffrey Cornish served as an officer (retired as major) during the Second World War.\n*Corporal Mark Robert McLaren: served as a member of the regiment from 2002 to 2007 before transferring the Regular Force with the 1st Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment. He was an Afghanistan veteran wounded during the A-10 strike incident which killed Private Mark Graham in 2006. Corporal McLaren was awarded the Medal of Military Valour for his devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy. On 6 November 2008, Corporal McLaren's joint Canadian-Afghan patrol was ambushed in Kandahar Province in Afghanistan. The attack seriously injured his team's Afghan interpreter, paralyzing him and leaving him exposed to further enemy fire. Heedless to the incoming fire, Corporal McLaren crawled 10 metres to his colleague's position, extracted him to a safe location and administered first aid. Corporal McLaren's courage and selfless devotion to his team prevented the interpreter's immediate loss and allowed for his safe evacuation. Corporal McLaren was subsequently killed in action on his second tour on 5 December by an improvised explosive device on his armoured vehicle during a joint patrol with Afghan National Army soldiers in the Arghandab District, west of Kandahar City. A Canadian Coast Guard Hero-class patrol vessel, CCGS Corporal McLaren MMV, will be named after him on commissioning.\nArmouries\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:left;line-height:150%;\"\n! style=\"background: #f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"13%\" | Site\n! style=\"background: #f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"12%\" | Date(s)\n! style=\"background: #f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"9%\" | Designated\n! style=\"background: #f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"12%\" | Location\n! style=\"background: #f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"12%\" | Province\n! style=\"background: #f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"35%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n! style=\"background: #f2f2f2; color: #000080\" width=\"7%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n|-\n|Belleville Armoury, 187 Pinnacle Street\n|1907-8\n|Canada's Register of Historic Places;1992 Recognized – Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings\n|Belleville\n|Ontario\n|\n* Houses The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, Regimental Headquarters and one company (A Coy/Assoro Coy)\n* This centrally located, low-pitched gambrel-roofed, stone and brick building features a pair of tall towers.\n|\n|-\n| Peterborough Drill Hall220 Murray Street\n| 1907-8 (completed) David Ewart\n| 1989 National Historic Sites of Canada; 1990 Classified on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings\n| Peterborough\n|Ontario\n|\n\"Riding a wave of national price and military enthusiasm following the South African War (1899–1902), the Canadian government embarked on a major reform of the nation's defence system.
