After one year of research at University of Chicago under Julius Stieglitz, he returned to Berkeley as an instructor in the chemistry department, and became a professor there in 1935.\nHis early research was about the mechanism of electron conduction in metals.  The collaborative work with Richard C. Tolman led to the discovery of Stewart–Tolman effect.  Later he worked on acid-base equilibria of organic nitrogen compounds, as well as reaction kinetics.\nReferences\n*[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb3r29n8f4&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00023&toc.depth=1&toc.id= Thomas Dale Stewart, University of California: In Memoriam, 1959], accessed 06-21-2007."
