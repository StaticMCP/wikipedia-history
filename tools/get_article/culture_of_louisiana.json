Often, these elements are the basis for one of the many festivals in the state. Louisiana, while sharing many similarities to its neighbors along the Gulf Coast, is unique in the influence of Louisiana French culture, due to the historical waves of immigration of French-speaking settlers to Louisiana. Likewise, African-American culture plays a prominent role. While New Orleans, as the largest city, has had an outsize influence on Louisiana throughout its history, other regions both rural and urban have contributed their shared histories and identities to the culture of the state.\nReligion\nThe first non-Native American religion in Louisiana was Roman Catholicism, as a result of the predominantly Catholic French and Spanish control of colonial Louisiana. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Protestantism was introduced to the territory. Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterians were later joined by other Protestant traditions such as Lutherans, who were often German immigrants. Louisiana remains a cultural pot with many different religions. More recent immigrants have brought Buddhism and Islam, etc. into Louisiana. Also, Voodoo is often practiced in south Louisiana, especially in New Orleans.\nMusic\nNew Orleans is deeply rooted in the deep tradition of Louisiana jazz music. A unique clash that reached its heart in the dynamic city of New Orleans, where Creole culture had a vital influence, which is how jazz origins are generally described: as a musical gumbo.  Business women in New Orleans who held parties helped to foster the early development of jazz music. Additionally, the growth of jazz at the turn of the twentieth century was heavily influenced by the French Creoles of Louisiana.\nFood\nThe state is predominantly known for both its Cajun cuisine, Creole cuisine, and Native American cuisine.\nCreole cuisine is influenced by traditional French cooking with Spanish, African, and Indian influences. Cajun cuisine is one of the most popular cuisines in the United States. People in Southern Louisiana say that others eat to live, while they live to eat.\nAlthough the food most identified with the state is the Cajun and Creole food of South Louisiana, North Louisiana also has its own unique cuisine. Traditionally, southern style soul food such as smothered pork chops, chicken and dumplings, candied yams, hot water cornbread, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and black-eyed peas are commonly eaten in North Louisiana. Natchitoches is famous for its meat pie.  For many years, crawfish were not eaten outside of Cajun country. People north of Alexandria were more likely to eat fried chicken or barbecue. Fish fries featuring catfish took the place of crawfish boils. Today, boiled crawfish is served throughout the state.\nOther foods popular in Louisiana include gumbo, etouffée, jambalaya, muffuletta, po'boy, and red beans and rice. Seafood is especially popular in Louisiana either as an ingredient or as a main dish such as shrimp, crawfish, crabs, oysters and catfish. Swamp denizens such as gator, frog legs, and turtle soup is popular around the bayous of south Louisiana.\nFamous desserts and snacks include king cake, beignets, pralines, sweet potato pie and pecan pie.\nFestivals and carnivals\nMardi Gras has its roots in medieval Europe and traveled to the French House of the Bourbons in the 17th and 18th centuries through Rome and Venice. From this point on, France's custom of celebrating \"Boeuf Gras,\" or fattened calf, spread throughout her colonies.\nBienville founded New Orleans in 1718. Mardi Gras was publicly observed in New Orleans by the 1730s, though not with the parades that are familiar to us today. The Marquis de Vaudreuil, the governor of Louisiana, created sophisticated social balls in the early 1740s, which served as the inspiration for modern-day Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans.\nThe term \"Carnival\" associated with Mardi Gras first surfaced in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial government. That year hundreds of clubs and carnival groups were founded in New Orleans, the first of which was the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association.\nIn 1971, the Ponchatoula Chamber of Commerce, together with a local nonprofit group, the Jaycees, imagined a festival that would celebrate the town's bountiful harvest and bring the community together. This led to the creation of the inaugural Ponchatoula Strawberry Festival, founded in 1972. Starting with a small 11-booth setup on North 6th Street, it was the start of an annual tradition that would quickly expand. The first festival attracted about 15,000 attendees and set the stage for the state's second-largest free event, which now brings in over 300,000 people annually.\nSports\nSports are very popular in Louisiana. American football is the most popular sport throughout the state. Other popular athletic sports include basketball and baseball. Also, recreational sports such as hunting and fishing are also popular. Because of this, the state is often called \"Sportsman's Paradise\" locally. Since 1958, the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame has honored the elite figures in state sports history. The state has many sports teams for high school, college and professional athletes.\nIn Louisiana, as in many other states, a love of athletics is instilled from a young age. Many locals learn to appreciate sports from an early age and grow up playing them. A family's love of sports is ingrained in its history as it is passed down through the generations. This is most likely the reason why so many youngsters decide to participate in high school athletics.\nProfessional\n*New Orleans Saints (NFL) - New Orleans\n*New Orleans Pelicans (NBA) - New Orleans\nCollege\n* Grambling State Tigers - Grambling\n*Louisiana–Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns - Lafayette\n*Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks - Monroe\n*Louisiana Tech Bulldogs and Lady Techsters - Ruston\n*LSU Tigers - Baton Rouge\n*McNeese State Cowboys and Cowgirls - Lake Charles\n*New Orleans Privateers - New Orleans\n*Nicholls State Colonels - Thibodaux\n*Northwestern State Demons - Natchitoches\n*Southeastern Louisiana Lions - Hammond\n*Southern Jaguars - Baton Rouge\n*Tulane Green Wave - New Orleans\nHigh school\n*Louisiana High School Athletic Association\nStadiums and arenas\n*Mercedes-Benz Superdome\n*Ace W.
