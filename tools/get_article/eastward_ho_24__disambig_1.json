E. Ryder in Bristol, Rhode Island under contract, then finished and marketed by Portsmouth Yachts in the United States. The first boats were built in 1975, but it is now out of production.\nDesign\nThe Eastward Ho 24 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a spooned plumb stem, an angled transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed long keel. With the optional bowsprit it can be cutter rigged. The boat displaces  and carries  of lead ballast.\nThe boat has a draft of  with the standard keel.\nThe boat is fitted with a Swedish Volvo MD4 diesel engine of , a Universal Atomic 4  or Palmer gasoline engine for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds  and the fresh water tank also has a capacity of .\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for four people, with two straight settee quarter berths in the main cabin and upper berths above them. The main cabin has a drop-leaf table. The galley is located on both sides of the companionway ladder. The galley is equipped with a stove, an icebox and a sink. The head is in the bow. Cabin headroom is .\nThe design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 269 and a hull speed of .\nOperational history\nIn a 2010 review Steve Henkel wrote, \"the Eastward Ho was available either as a sloop ... or, with a bowsprit added, as a cutter. There was also a choice of motive power, including a Volvo MD-2 diesel (22 hp) or an Atomic Four (30 hp). The designer, Eldredge McInnis of Boston, MA, a firm started in 1926, tended to specialize in large yachts, especially motorsailers. (The firm closed in 1976 when Walter J. McInnis retired at age 83. Albert Eldredge had died in 1936 but was involved in sales, not design.) Even though she's less than 24 feet on deck, because of her displacement of 7,000 pounds she can use the power to punch through waves. Typically, these boats were offered with a yacht finish, teak and holly sole, teak interior, fine jointer-work, and so on. Best features: This is a top-of-the-line yacht for her size range. She is durable, beautiful to look at, and a good sailer, especially when it breezes up. Worst features: When these boats come onto the market, which is rare, they typically command a premium price.\"\nSee also\n*List of sailing boat types\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20210316194334/http://chappyboat.weebly.com/uploads/9/4/7/0/947048/5546482.jpg?600x356 Photo of an Eastward Ho 24]"
