It is the only church in the world to be dedicated to Saint David the Prophet - Psalmist.\nHistory\nThe Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia () Ilia II () decided to build a church dedicated to King David the Prophet, as at the time there was no temple in the world named after him.\nThe construction of the church started on May 6, 1997, and finished on May 6th 2001: the day in which Saint George's Day is celebrated in Georgia. The temple was consecrated on September 11, 2001, on the day of the Beheading of John the Baptist, and the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia Ilia II celebrated the first liturgy.\nAs stated by the Deacon Tevdore Ambroladze (), during the construction of the foundation of church they came across the remains of the 17th century Saint Marine Church. The foundation of the church was blessed by the same Deacon Tevdore together with Deacon Tariel Sikinchalashvili ().\nThe construction was financed by Bigi Chkholaria () and the church was built in memory of his 8 years old son Giorgi ().\nThe church was consecrated as a monastery under Father Makari (). Musical instruments were purchased and guitar, panduri () and singing were taught to young people, creating an ensemble who performed in Racha (). Moreover, English, Russian, Georgian and mathematics were taught free of charge.\nArchitecture\nThe church, a basilica with a pointed apse, was built in the old Georgian architectural style. The architect of the church was Revaz Janashia (). The builders of the temple are Giorgi Beraia (), Zurab Alania () and Murtaz Khvistani ().\nThe church is built with natural stones from Dzegvi () and old Georgian bricks. Moreover, stones from Nichbisi (), Bodbe (), Bolnisi () and Chognari () have also been used.\nThe painting of the church was financed by the Georgian Patriarchate and it was done by Lasha Kintsurashvili (). Badri Patarkatsishvili () also donated 14 thousand dollars, which have been used for painting the church and to complete the bell tower. On the northern wall, a painting depicts an episode from the reign of David the Prophet in which the king, after declaring Jerusalem the capital, erected a new tabernacle moved in it, from the tent of Moses, the Ark of the Covenant. In the lower part of the northern wall, the little Giorgi Chkholaria is depicted kneeling in prayer with a lit candle in his hand. On the western wall, David the Prophet is depicted with the representatives of the Bagrationi dynasty, who consider themselves descendants of David: Ashot I the Great (), Demetre I (), King Tamar (). Moreover, there is a unique fresco of the Root of Jesse. On the eastern wall there is a fresco of the Virgin Mary-Platytera. On the southern wall there is a unique fresco of David's blessing.\nFile:King David the Prophet's Church 3.jpg|Plaque on the church's entrance\nFile:King David the Prophet's Church 5.jpg|Entrance of the church\nFile:King David the Prophet's Church 1.jpg|Interior of the church\nKing David the Prophet's Church 2.jpg|View from the yard of church\nReferences"
