The Mass-Observation Archive at Sussex was what aroused his interest in studying the everyday; Moran credits his own interest in taking note of what normally goes unnoticed to the I-Spy booklets he consumed as a young boy.\nQuoting Doreen Massey, Moran says that despite every generation's emphasis on change, \"much of life for many people 'still consists of waiting in a bus shelter with your shopping for a bus that never comes'\"; he describes himself as \"trying to find a critical language to talk about these empty, purposeless moments of daily life, filled with activities such as commuting and office routines, that we generally take for granted but that take up so much of our lives.\" Moran describes himself as influenced by Mass-Observation and a new French ethnography of the quotidian or infraordinary, exemplified by works by Georges Perec, Marc Augé and François Bon.\nMoran's book Queuing for Beginners is a chronological account, from breakfast to bed, of a normal British day and how it has changed since the nineteenth century and more particularly since the 1930s; the book received favourable reviews.Aimee Shalan, writing within Ian Pindar, Aimee Shalan and John Dugdale, \"[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview29 The Loneliness  of the Long Distance Driver]\", The Guardian, 12 July 2008. Accessed 4 March 2009.\nAs of August 2013, Moran is a professor of English and Cultural History at Liverpool John Moores University.
