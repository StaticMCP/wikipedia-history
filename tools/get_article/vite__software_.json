Vite was written by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js. It has support for TypeScript and JSX. It uses  and esbuild internally for bundling.\nVite monitors files as they are being edited and upon file save the web browser reloads the code being edited through a process called Hot Module Replacement (HMR) which works by just reloading the specific file being changed using ES6 modules (ESM) instead of recompiling the entire application.\nVite provides built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR). By default, it listens on TCP port 5173. It is possible to configure Vite to serve content over HTTPS and proxy requests (including WebSocket) to a back-end web server, such as Apache HTTP Server or lighttpd.\nFeatures and performance\nVite has a Hot Module Replacement (HMR) system, which reduces wait times during development. Vite supports frameworks such as React, Vue, and Svelte, and has server-side rendering (SSR), code-splitting, and asynchronous loading.\nViteconf\nViteconf is an online event that hosts talks about frontend tooling. In 2025, an in-person Viteconf is planned to be held in Amsterdam.\nConventions were held in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\nSee also\n}}\n* Bun\n* Vue\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite Vite] on npm\n*"
