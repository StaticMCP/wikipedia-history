In the , Ashmore had a population of 12,415 people.\nHistory\nIn October 1887, in the area now known as Ashmore and Benowa, 5 subdivisions comprising the Benowa Estate and Plantation on the Nerang River were advertised to be auctioned by James R. Dickson. A map advertising the auction states the Estate was located 4 miles to Southport bound by a good road on one side and bound by the navigable Nerang River on the other side. Extensive buildings and plant for sugar manufacturing were included in the estate.\nIn the 1970s, Jim Donellon, a property investor from Sydney, purchased and developed a housing estate called Ashmore Village. The Ashmore Plaza Shopping Centre was developed by the late 1970s.\nAshmore State School opened on 23 January 1978.\nTrinity Lutheran Primary School opened in Cotlew Street on 27 January 1981.\nThe suburb was officially bounded and named Ashmore on N1 December 1982.\nBellevue Park State School opened on 24 January 1983 in Southport. It is now within Ashmore.\nTrinity Lutheran College opened on Ashmore Road as a secondary school on 28 January 1987. In 2002 it amalgamated with the Trinity Lutheran Primary School under the name Trinity Lutheran College. The early and junior year students are at the Cotlew Street campus while the middle and senior students are at the Ashmore Road campus.\nDemographics\nIn the , Ashmore recorded a population of 11,586 people, 52.5% female and 47.5% male. The median age of the Ashmore population was 40 years, 3 years above the national median of 37.  65.7% of people living in Ashmore were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were New Zealand 9.2%, England 4.9%, Japan 1.1%, Scotland 0.7%, Korea, Republic of 0.7%.  82.9% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 1.5% Japanese, 0.9% Korean, 0.6% German, 0.6% Greek, 0.5% Mandarin.\nIn the , Ashmore had a population of 11,910 people.\nIn the , Ashmore had a population of 12,415 people.\nNatural environment\nPre-clearing, the vegetation of Ashmore included substantial areas of blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) tall open forest on lowland metamorphosed sediments. This ecosystem type is now listed as endangered with extinction in Queensland having been extensively cleared for agriculture and housing development.\nThe area now occupied by Royal Pines resort once supported established Eucalyptus tereticornis forests and wetlands with patches of rainforest. Jabiru, magpie geese and a variety of water birds used these wetlands which stretched from Nerang to near Burleigh Heads along the floodplain of the Nerang River Valley and Mudgeereebah and Bonogin Creeks. This ecosystem was akin to Kakadu with lagoons of lilypads, swamp rainforest and gnarled old paperbark forest filled with palms. In the 1980s prior to the development of Royal Pines resort, farmland with remnant degraded wetlands and some forest remained, and jabiru, spoonbills, magpie geese and a variety of other birds could be seen there. Development in recent decades has led to the loss of most remnant natural vegetation.\nEducation\nAshmore State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls on Currumburra Road ().
