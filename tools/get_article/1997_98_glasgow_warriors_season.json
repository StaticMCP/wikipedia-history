During this season the young professional side competed as Glasgow Rugby.\nThis season saw Glasgow Rugby compete in the competitions: the Scottish Inter-District Championship and the European Champions Cup, the Heineken Cup.\nSeason Overview\nDisquiet grows\nNotwithstanding the 'Gang of Four' pressing for the club teams to be used in Europe instead of the district teams, further disquiet was building against Kevin Greene's dual role as Glasgow Hawks coach and Glasgow Warriors coach. The matter was brought to a head when Greene signed Tommy Hayes for the Glasgow side and Kilmarnock RFC complained that they had not been given an opportunity to bid for the player; as one club team in the district would be assigned the player when not in use by the professional Glasgow side.\nHayes was later assigned the Glasgow Hawks club; Greene's club side.\nEuropean highs and lows\nGetting out of the Heineken Cup pool stage was extremely positive for the Glasgow side. However the manner of the defeat in the play-off for the Quarter finals by Leicester Tigers brought further grist to the mill as far as the 'Gang of Four' were concerned. Such was the ease of the win by Leicester that one of their players Dean Richards went off-pitch for a toilet break in the middle of the match without the Tigers replacing him.\nThe result though probably wasn't helped by the prior announcement that the Leicester Tigers match would be Greene's last in charge of Glasgow. To the SRU this season's European results showed that their current model of professionalism wasn't working and they resolved to change the structure of the newly professional game in Scotland. The effects of this resolve were to be seen in the following season.\nUlster interest in Greene\nUlster Rugby made overtures to Kevin Greene about being their new Director of Rugby, straight after Glasgow's defeat of Ulster in the Challenge Cup. Greene however turned them down, preferring to go home to his native New Zealand. He had already agreed with Jim Telfer that he would act as an 'agent' for Glasgow Warriors and Scotland in New Zealand by helping out the training of the Silver Thistles. Glasgow later used Greene on the same basis for their 'academy side': the Glasgow Thistles.\n\"The job description from Ulster landed on my desk this week after they spoke to me at Scotstoun when the game was over. They said they needed a new direction,\" said Greene. \"I am flattered, but I won't be taking up the position. I spoke to Jim Telfer this week and agreed that I will stay in Scotland to see Glasgow's game with Leicester through, and then go back to New Zealand.\n\"We are keen that the Silver Thistles tourists carry on, and we are to investigate the possibility of taking coaches over there as well to learn what they do. I suppose, to some extent, I will be an agent for Scotland back home.\"\nNew coach\nAnother New Zealander was brought in to coach Glasgow Rugby. Keith Robertson was ear-marked by the SRU's Jim Telfer earlier in the year as a potential candidate for Glasgow when Robertson's Otago Highlanders team toured the UK. He took over Glasgow in November 1997.\nStrength and fitness and the Elite Development Programme\nDavid Jordan, the chief executive of GDRU, acknowledges: \"The result against Leicester told us that we have still much to do. We were found wanting in a number of departments, particularly our overall fitness and strength. It is vital that we recognise where out weaknesses are.\"\nGlasgow issued an action plan on how it planned to resolve those weaknesses. It stated: \"The Glasgow and District Rugby Union will be aggressively looking beyond Scotland to identify players to enhance and improve the performance of the team. Priority will be given to identifying players with Scottish eligibility. The district will also take full advantage of the use of two non-EU international players.\"\n\"The GDRU will utilise the services of a weight training specialist. Every squad member will be given one-to-one training and will work to individually tailored programmes.\"\nIn other areas of physical conditioning the plan envisages that there will be a player appraisal programme. \"It will be based on setting individual training, fitness and dietary targets. Players will be expected to do training outwith normal squad sessions and be responsible for achieving the targets set,\" says the action plan.\nGlasgow's initial squad of players for next season will be selected next month and between then and March will be the start of what the plan calls the Elite Development Programme that will concentrate on the players who \"have the physical and mental ability to represent Glasgow and the Scottish Rugby Union.\"\n\"This is the key to the long-term success of Scottish rugby,\" says the action plan which makes it clear that better identification of talent and an increase in playing numbers are priorities in the next few years.\nTeam\nCoaches\n*Head coach:  Kevin Greene to November 1997;  Keith Robertson from November 1997\n*Assistant coach:  Gordon Macpherson from November 1997\n*Fitness coach:   Ken MacEwen\n*Physiotherapists:  Sarah Mitchell and  Alan Mackay\nStaff\nChairman: Ken Crichton\nVice-chairman: George Blackie\nConvenor / team M=manager:  Hamish Fyfe\nChief executive: David Jordan\nAdministrative executive: Bill McMurtrie\nCommittee: Gordon Ash, Norry Boyle, Ewan Cameron, John Dyer, Alasdair Graham, Tom Morrice, Bill Nolan, Willie Talbot (SRU Championship Committee Representative), Dick Thomas (West of Scotland rugby Referees Society Representative)\nSecretary: Victoria Mount\nSquad\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\nHookers\nGordon Bulloch\nChris Docherty\nProps\nMike Beckham\nGary Isaac\nDavid Jamieson\nAlan Kittle\nAlan Perrie\nDanny Porte\nGordon McIlwham\nLocks\nCharles Afuakwah\nStephen Begley\nShade Munro\nMalcolm Norval\nGuy Perrett\n|width=\"33\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\nLoose forwards\nScott Hutton\nGordon Mackay\nDavid McLeish\nAndrew Ness\nJohn Shaw\nIain Sinclair\nFergus Wallace\nMurray Wallace\nHalf backs\nFraser Stott\nJamie Weston\nStand offs\nTommy Hayes\nCameron Little\nErin Cossey\n|width=\"33\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\nCentres\nDanny Ablett\nAlan Bulloch\nAaron Collins\nIan Jardine\nMatt McGrandles\nJames McLaren\nChris Simmers\nBack three\nJames Craig\nGavin Fraser\nGerry Hawkes\nGlenn Metcalfe\nCraig Sangster\nDerek Stark\n|}\nAcademy players\nA 22 strong group of age-grade Glasgow District players – known as the Glasgow Thistles – were sent to New Zealand for rugby training under the aegis of Kevin Greene in February 1998.\nThe 22 Glasgow Thistles: Gillon Armstrong (Kilmarnock), Colin Bartwicki (East Kilbride), Stuart Bryce (Glasgow Southern), Stuart Caulfield (Dalziel), Scott Chassels (Glasgow Academy), Rory Couper (Ardrossan Academicals), Hugh Fulton (Glasgow Academy), Craig Hamilton (Wigtownshire), Rory Kerr (Strathendrick), Douglas Lyall (Hutchesons' GS), Richard Maxton (Stewart's Melville FP), Andrew McGeoch (Glasgow Academy), Ian McInroy (Garnock), Eric Milligan (Stewarton Academy and Kilmarnock), Iain Monaghan (Glasgow Southern), Craig Murdoch (Ayr), Euan Murray (Williamwood HS and Glasgow Southern), Chris Pothan (Kelvinside Academy), Colin Stewart (East Kilbride), Gordon Tyler (Ardrossan Academicals), Jan Vos (Glasgow Southern), Martin Yorston (Lenzie).\nPlayer statistics\nDuring the 1997–98 season, Glasgow have used 29 different players in competitive games.

The second place achieved in the Scottish Inter-District was enough for Glasgow to be entered in the Heineken Cup for the new season 1997–98.\nThe pool matches saw Glasgow grouped alongside London Wasps; with former player Kenny Logan now starring for the English side. Logan was to put Glasgow to the sword over the two matches, scoring 3 tries against his old team. Nevertheless, Glasgow did well enough to get out the group and snatch a quarter final play-off place. However they were soundly beaten by the Leicester Tigers and their matches against English opposition showed the gulf of professionalism that then existed between Scotland and England.\nIn the pool
