The scandal created a feud within the Scottish National Party and a ministerial code investigation into Sturgeon conducted by James Hamilton, which ultimately concluded that she did not break the ministerial code over her conduct with Salmond.\nThe following is a timeline of events that happened in the Alex Salmond political scandal.\n2017\n* December: Scottish Government staff begin informal contacts with women alleging sexual misconduct by Alex Salmond.\n2018\n* January: Two female staff members make formal complaints to the Scottish Government about Alex Salmond's conduct, dating back to when he was First Minister in December 2013.

Salmond tweets a statement denying misconduct and calling some allegations \"patently ridiculous\". He announces that he is launching a judicial review of the way the investigation was handled, calling it \"unjust\". Nicola Sturgeon publishes a statement admitting awareness of the investigation but denies any role in its process. Leslie Evans publishes a statement defending the inquiry, claiming that Salmond's statement \"contains significant inaccuracies which will be addressed in court\".\n* 25 August: The Scottish Government rejects claims by Alex Salmond that confidential information was leaked to the press, insisting that the inquiry has at all stages been \"entirely confidential\". Salmond again claims innocence at a press conference.\n* 29 August: Salmond formally begins his judicial review of the government's handling of harassment complaints against him. He also resigns his membership from the Scottish National Party.\n* 30 August: The Scottish Parliament establishes the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints to investigate the Scottish Government’s handling of the affair.\n* 31 August: Then-senior counsel for the government, Roddy Dunlop QC, warns the government that the revelation that the Investigating Officer had previously met and briefed the two complainers was \"extremely concerning\".\n* 14 September: Police Scotland confirms that it has launched an investigation into complaints against Alex Salmond, separate to the Scottish Government investigation and judicial review.\n* 6 November: The judicial review convenes in court for the first time, Lord Pentland presiding.\n* 6 December: Leslie Evans is warned by Roddy Dunlop QC that Salmond's legal challenge will \"more likely than not succeed\".\n* 14 December: Lord Pentland orders the independent review of redacted Scottish Government documents, which Salmond's legal team claims show that Scottish Government staff were in contact with Salmond's accusers as early as December 2017, in violation of Civil Service guidelines.\n* 31 December: Evans chooses to concede the judicial review.\n2019\n* 8 January: The Scottish Government concedes defeat in the Court of Session, Scotland's supreme civil court.

Sturgeon rejects Davis' claims, describing them as \"the latest instalment of Alex Salmond's conspiracy theory,\" and re-iterates her confidence in Liz Lloyd.\n* 19 March: A leaked Scottish Parliament committee report on the handling of the government's allegations finds Sturgeon misled parliament.
