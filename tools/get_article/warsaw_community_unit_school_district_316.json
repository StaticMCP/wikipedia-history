Students at the junior high level grades 7th through 8th attend Nauvoo-Colusa Junior High School in the Nauvoo-Colusa Community Unit School District 325.\nHistory\nIn 2007 the Warsaw school district and the Nauvoo-Colusa Community Unit School District 325 agreed to a plan in which Nauvoo-Colusa would close Nauvoo-Colusa High School and send its students to Warsaw High. In return the Warsaw district would close its junior high school and send its students to Nauvoo-Colusa Junior High School. On Tuesday February 12, 2008 voters in both districts approved the consolidation plans.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.warsawschool.com/ Warsaw Community Unit School District 316]\n*"
