      "text": "# Timeline of Reddit\n\nThis is a timeline of Reddit, an entertainment, social networking, and news website where registered community members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links, making it essentially an online bulletin board system.\nMajor events\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Time period !! class=\"unsortable\" | Key developments at Reddit\n|-\n| 2005 || Reddit's creators help seed Reddit with numerous fake accounts to make Reddit seem more populated than it actually was.\n|-\n| 2006 || Apart from \"reddit.com\", \"NSFW\" is the most popular subreddit at the beginning of 2006. \"Programming\" becomes the second most popular subreddit for most of the year. Then by the end of the year, subreddit \"science\" gets launched and soon becomes the third most popular subreddit.\n|-\n| 2007 || For most of the year, \"science\" and \"programming\" are the most popular subreddits (apart from \"reddit.com\"). They then get displaced by \"politics\" as the most popular non-\"reddit.com\" subreddit towards the end of the year.\n|-\n| 2008 || This year is dominated by the launch of numerous new subreddits. By the end of the year (except for a short-lived blip following the 2008 presidential election), not one subreddit (not even \"reddit.com\") would capture more than 50% of Reddit's attention. From the beginning of 2008 (to at least the end of 2012), there is a continual exponential increase in the number of unique subreddits people submitted to each week.\n|-\n| mid-2010 || Due to a controversial redesign brought on by Digg, disgruntled users declared a \"Quit Digg\" day where they posted links to Reddit and left Digg behind to join Reddit. Reddit subsequently overtook Digg in search popularity.\n|-\n| 2010–2012 || From the beginning to the end of 2010 (and following Reddit's move to Amazon AWS servers in November 2009), Reddit more than triples in pageviews and bandwidth count. By February 2011, Reddit reached 1&nbsp;billion page-views per month. Within a year (by January 2012), Reddit again doubled in pageviews and reached 2&nbsp;billion pageviews per month.\n|-\n| 2012–2014 || Reddit achieves 37&nbsp;billion pageviews in 2012, 56&nbsp;billion pageviews in 2013, and 71.25&nbsp;billion pageviews in 2014. Yishan Wong serves as Reddit's CEO from March 2012 to November 2014. Wong is replaced by Ellen Pao in November 2014. By September 2014, Reddit raises $50&nbsp;million in funding in a Series B round, and makes its first app acquisition in October 2014.\n|-\n| 2014–2016 || On July 10, 2015, Pao resigned as CEO and was replaced by Reddit cofounder Steve Huffman.\n|-\n|2020\n|On June 5, 2020, Ohanian resigned from the board and planned to be replaced \"by a Black candidate\". The orange colour of the site emblem was changed to black for few months.\n|}\nFull timeline\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n! Year !! Month and date !!
