      "text": "# Timeline of the English Reformation\n\nThis is a timeline of the English Protestant Reformation. It assumes the reformation spans the period between 1527 and the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. It also provides sections for background events prior to 1527 and the events of the Long Reformation beginning in 1603. Since the six dioceses of the Church in Wales were part of the Church of England prior to Welsh Church Act 1914 this timeline covers the reformation history of both Wales and England.\nBackground\nLollardy\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! Date\n! Event\n! Significance to the Reformation in England\n|-\n| 1328\n|Birth of John Wycliffe in Yorkshire.\n|Ordained in September 1351, Master of Balliol College in 1360, Warden of Canterbury College in 1365 and Rector of St Mary's, Lutterworth from 1374, John Wycliffe is earliest known teacher of evangelical ideas in England and a translator of the Bible into the vernacular Middle English. He is popularly known as the morning star or   of the English Reformation and both he and his followers (the Lollards) were much invoked by later reformers. While Lollard influence on the Henrician Reformation was negligible, nevertheless Wycliffe's writings did influence Jan Hus who in turn influenced Martin Luther. The Lollards are also a key topic of Foxes Book of Martyrs and their story did much to solidify the self understanding of the 16th century reformers.\n|-\n|1348-1350\n|The Black Death ravages England.\n|Considered to have been a major influence on the ideas of both Wycliffe and many other proto-Protestants.\n|-\n| 1377\n|Wycliffe published De civili dominio\n|A scathing attack on church property and tithes. Set out Wycliffe's ideas of dominion, the notion that the church should not have any property and that no member of its clergy should exercise political or judicial power.\n|-\n|1377\n|Wycliffe is censured by Pope Gregory XI who orders church authorities in Oxford and London to begin an inquisition.\n|\n|-\n|1377, 19 February\n|John Wycliffe summonsed by William Courtenay, Bishop of London, for an examination of heresy. In attending he was accompanied and supported by John of Gaunt, Henry Percy, Earl Marshal of England, and four theologians representing the four major mendicant orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, and Augustinians). The session ended in aporia over a question of etiquette, as to whether Wycliffe should stand or sit to answer questions.\n|The event showed how useful Wycliffe's theories might be to the aristocracy who had good political reason to support reformers undermining the power and wealth of the church. The English monarchs also had a strained relationship with the Avignon Papacy and its supporters, the French monarchy, because of the ongoing conflict of the 100 Years War. For these reasons and others, in the early days of Wycliffite Lollardy many of the institutions of secular authority were supportive. John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, was a strong supporter of Wycliffe in the early days as too was Joan of Kent. In 1382 the Mayor of Leicester personally attended the sermon of the Lollard William Swinderby. The ideas Wycliffe was under investigation for would return as a major theme of the 16th century reformation when the idea of a secular requisition of church property would again prove popular with authorities.\n|-\n| 1378\n|Wycliffe published De veritate sacrae scripturae\n|Suggested that only theological conclusions with direct scriptural backing ought to be accepted. A momentous publication foreshadowing the idea of sola scriptura which would dominate the later reforms of the 16th century.\n|-\n| 1379\n|Wycliffe published De Eucharistia\n|An attack on the doctrine of transubstantiation and its lack of scriptural warrant. Wycliffe maintained a firm belief in the real presence but rejected the use of Aristotelian metaphysics to explain it. His convictions were closer to Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, or the modern Church of England after the Oxford Movement than those of the 16th century reformers.\n|-\n|1381, 30 May\n|Peasants' Revolt begins.\n|Originating from dissatisfaction with taxes and rigid class hierarchy this rebellion did much to spread Wycliffite and more general Lollard thought among the ordinary population.\n|-\n|1381, 13 June\n| John Ball preached his famous Blackheath sermon during the Peasants Revolt.\n|John Ball's career suggests that Wycliffe was merely the first man of rank in the university to express more widespread discontent.\n|-\n|1382, May 21\n| Earthquake Synod at Blackfriars, London condemns Wycliffe's teachings\n|\n|-\n|1382, 17 November\n|Anti-Wycliffe Synod  at Oxford\n|Wycliffe defiantly reasserts his positions in a famous oration and is exiled to his Rectory at Lutterworth on the Leicestershire, Warwickshire boundary.\n|-\n|1382\n|Englands first Heresy Act passed as a result of a request from Pope Martin IV and repealed the following year.\n|It required mayors and magistrates to burn those found guilty of heresy by a bishop. A highly controversial act it was repealed the following year due the objection of members of the House of Commons showing the widespread opposition to the bill among the burghers\n|-\n| 1383\n|Philip Repyngdon is deprived of his position at Oxford for defending Wycliffe's teachings.\n|Repyngdon was later made Abbot of Leicester in 1394 and Bishop of Lincoln in 1404 and was elevated to the rank of Cardinal. This shows that Wycliffe's thought had a wide influence even in the church hierarchy.\n|-\n|1384\n|Wycliffe's Bible probably completed around this time. Wycliffe also dies this year on Holy Innocents' Day (28 December)\n|Earliest complete translation of the Latin Vulgate into English.\n|-\n|1395\n|Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards presented to Parliament and posted on the doors of Westminster Abbey and Old St Paul's\n|\n|-\n|1399\n|Henry IV overthrew Richard II.\n|This brought an end to the relative tolerance of Lollardy.\n|-\n| 1401\n|De heretico comburendo is passed by parliament which required forfeiture of all property, both for themselves and for their children, for all those found in position of copies of Wycliffe's Bible or some part of it.\n|A major blow to the Lollard movement.\n|-\n|1410, 1 March\n|John Badby burned at the stake Smithfield for denying transubstantiation.\n|\n|-\n|1414, 9 January\n|Oldcastle Revolt\n|Small popular uprising inspired by Lollard ideals.\n|-\n|1414, 30 April\n|Opening session of the Fire and Faggot Parliament. Symbolically the Parliament was held at the Greyfriars monastery in Leicester, a town which had been stronghold of Lollardy, the seat of John of Gaunt, standing around 15 mile north east of Wycliffe's home and grave at Lutterworth.\n|The Parliament which passed the Suppression of Heresy Act in response to Lollardy. This act was used to justify the burning of many Lollards and many more radical reformers during the reign of Henry VIII. It was one of the acts restored by Mary I’s Revival of the Heresy Acts.\n|}\nBackground events 1485-1525\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! Date\n! Event\n! Significance to the Reformation in England\n|-\n|1485, 22 August\n|Death of Richard III and acclamation of Henry VII as King at the Battle of Bosworth Field in Leicestershire.\n|Henry's usurpation of Richard ended 331 years of Plantagenet rule, concluded the Wars of the Roses by uniting the two subsidiary Plantagenet Houses of York and Lancaster through his marriage to Elizabeth of York, and thereby initiated the Tudor dynasty. The Tudor monarchs would come to enable the English Reformation, chiefly Henry VI's son Henry VIII and his grandchildren Edward VI and Elizabeth I.\n|-\n|1485, 16 December\n|Birth of Catherine of Aragon to Ferdinand and Isabella at the Archbishop’s Palace of Alcalá in Madrid.\n|Fourth daughter and sixth child of the celebrated Catholic Monarchs, the founders of the united kingdoms of Castile and Leon, the forerunner of the modern Kingdom of Spain, and the Spanish Empire. Catherine  was a Habsburg, the younger sister of Joanna and later aunt of Joanna's son Charles V. In 1496 she would be betrothed to Arthur, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VII forming an alliance between England and Castile and Leon. Following Arthur's death, her betrothal was switched to Henry VII's other son, Prince Henry, who married her after becoming king Henry VIII. The couples difficulties with fertility partly precipitated the Annulment Crisis of the late 1520's and early 30's and the ensuing English Reformation of the mid 1530's on.\n|-\n|1486, 19/20 September\n|Birth of Arthur, Prince of Wales to Henry VII and Elizabeth of York at Winchester Cathedral Priory.\n|His espousal to the infant Princess Catherine brought her to England and his untimely death in 1502 at just 15 years old will lead to both his younger brother Henry's accession to the English throne and his espousal and marriage to Catherine.\n|-\n|1489, 2 July\n|Birth of Thomas Cranmer at Aslockton, Nottinghamshire.\n|Future Archbishop of Canterbury and principal leader among the reforming churchman during both the Henrician and Edwardian reformations. Martyred by Mary I.\n|-\n|1491, 28 June\n|Birth of Prince Henry at Greenwich Palace.\n|The future King Henry VIII, the monarch whose marital difficulties with Catherine of Aragon will lead him to overthrow Papal Supremacy in the Church of England. His reforms will be responsible for the deaths of many thousands of Catholic martyrs and rebels opposing his reforms and over 60 Protestant martyrs pushing for further reform.\n|-\n| 1494\n|Birth of William Tyndale in Gloucestershire.\n|Became a leading theologian of the early English Reformation through his work The Obedience of a Christian Man and its first major Bible translator since John Wycliffe responsible for the Tyndale Bible translations.\n|-\n|1496\n|Catherine of Aragon's hand secured for Arthur, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VII.\n|Brought Catherine of Aragon to England.\n|-\n|1499-1500\n|The celebrated humanist and renaissance thinker Erasmus made his first visit to England (see Erasmus: First visit to England).\n|The Renaissance Humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam was a pillar of the New Learning, a key inspiration for many reformers and, while remaining a faithful Roman Catholic, articulated many of the criticisms of the Pre-Reformation Church that they shared. Notably he visits Oxford and Cambridge Universities where his ideas spread.\n|-\n|1501, 14 November\n| Arthur, Prince of Wales marries Catherine of Aragon at Old St Paul's Cathedral in a nuptial mass celebrated by Henry Deane, Archbishop of Canterbury.\n|\n|-\n|1502, 2 April\n|Arthur dies of tuberculosis at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire.\n|Arthur’s death lead to the accession of his younger brother Prince Henry following Henry VII's death, his brother's betrothal and eventual marriage to Catherine of Aragon, and in turn the annulment crisis, the Henrician Reformation, and the subsequent Edwardian and Elizabethan reforms.\n|-\n|1503\n|Henry VII, fearful of the loss of Catherine's substantial dowery, has her betrothed to his younger son, Prince Henry, later Henry VIII.\n|This precipitates the later annulment crisis\n|-\n|1503, December\n|Julius II issues a formal Papal Dispensation permitting the marriage between Catherine and Henry to allay fears around the legality of marrying a brothers widow.\n|\n|-\n|1509, 22 April\n|Henry VII dies and Henry VIII accedes to the throne.\n|As a result of Henry VIII's marital problems and at the suggestion of reformers close to him he secured the independence of the Church of England from the rest of the Latin Church and the end of papal supremacy in England and Wales. This only had consequences for church property and monastic communities while Henry lived and he held back reform of soteriology or eucharistic theology until his death in 1547. After his death the Royal Supremacy enables Thomas Cranmer and other radical churchmen under his son Edward VI to undertake a full Protestant reformation of the established church.\n|-\n|1509, 11 June\n|Henry VIII marries Catherine of Aragon in the Church of the Observant Friars at Greenwich Palace.\n|Henry and Catherines failure to produce a healthy male child surviving past infancy precipitated the annulment crisis and the overthrow of Papal Supremacy in the Church of England.\n|-\n|1509, 24 June\n|Coronation of Henry VIII and Queen Catherine at Westminster Abbey.\n|\n|-\n|1510, 31 Jan\n|Queen Catherine miscarried a daughter.\n|First of Queen Catherine's 6 pregnancies and the first of her 4 failed pregnancies.\n|-\n|1511, 1 Jan\n|Queen Catherine gave birth to a son at Richmond Palace and he was named Prince Henry, Henry VIII's firstborn legitimate son.\n|A major step in securing the otherwise fairly weak Tudor succession. Second of Queen Catherine's pregnancies.\n|-\n|1511, 22 Feb\n|Prince Henry dies at Richmond Palace and was buried in Westminster Abbey a few days later on the 27th.\n|A major blow to Henry and Catherine both personally and constitutionally. Prince Henry will prove to be the only surviving male birth produced by Henry and Catherine and in time his death and the subsequent still births of more sons brought about both Henry's paranoia that his marriage to Catherine was cursed by God due to her earlier marriage to his late brother Prince Arthur and his desperation to seek an annulment and a new bride.\n|-\n|1511\n|Agnes Grebill burned for Lollardy together with four other female Lollards at Chelmsford in Essex.\n|Shows that Wycliffite sympathies still lingered before the explosion of the New Learning and Lutheran ideas.\n|-\n|1513, September\n|Queen Catherine gave birth to a stillborn son.\n|Third of Queen Catherine's pregnancies and her second failed pregnancy\n|-\n|1514, November\n|Queen Catherine gives birth to a stillborn boy.\n|Fourth of Queen Catherine's pregnancies and her third failed pregnancy.\n|-\n|1516\n|First edition of Erasmus's Greek New Testament published.\n|Had an enormous impact on biblical translation both into English and other languages.\n|-\n|1516, 18 February\n|Princess Mary born at Greenwich Palace.\n|The future Queen (1553–1558) who would reverse the Edwardian and Henrician Reformations restoring the Church of England to full communion with the Pope and earn the title \"Bloody Mary\" for her execution by burning of over 300 Protestants. Fifth of Queen Catherine's 6 pregnancies and the only child to survive into adulthood.\n|-\n|31 October 1517\n|Martin Luther posts his 95 Theses on the door of a church in Wittenberg, Germany, formally beginning the Protestant Reformation\n|Luther's protest was a landmark moment for all of Europe. In England news of his protest and his theology of sola fide and sola scriptura had a significant impact, especially in Cambridge and in towns where the ideas of Lollardy had remained strong.\n|-\n|1518, 10 November\n|Queen Catherine gave birth to a stillborn daughter.\n|The last of Queen Catherine's 6 pregnancies and the fourth failed pregnancy. This final failed pregnancy and Catherine's age (she turned 33 a month later on the 16th) pushed Henry to despair of his marriages success.\n|-\n| 1521\n|A group of Cambridge University reformers begin meeting at the White Horse Inn to discuss Luther and other theories of reformation coming from the continent.\n|According to John Foxe William Tyndale, Miles Coverdale, Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, Robert Barnes, Thomas Bilney, Matthew Parker, Nicholas Shaxton, and John Bale were among those who attended. Recent scholarship has suggested that the White Horse Inn meetings of Foxes account may be later hagiography. However it is the case that a large number of Cambridge students all present in the 1520s played significant roles in later reforms.\n|-\n|1521\n|Assertio Septem Sacramentorum was published as Henry's own work. Pope Leo X rewards him by granting him the title Fidei Defensor or \"Defender of the Faith\"\n|The publication of this intensely orthodox work constrained Henry's commitment to reformation in the years ahead.\n|-\n| 1523\n|Reformation in Zürich under the leadership of Ulrich Zwingli.\n|Together with Lutheranism, Zwinglianism was to have a major impact on the ideas of English reformers, whose thoughts represented a middle way, \"via media\" between the two.\n|-\n|1524, May\n|William Tyndale excommunicated.\n|\n|-\n|1525\n|Cardinal Wolsey suppresses 29 monasteries aided by Thomas Cromwell.\n|Provided a papally approved orthodox precedent for the later more widespread Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n|-\n|1525\n|The New Testament of the Tyndale Bible (in English) is published in Worms, Germany.\n|Although banned in England, Tyndale's work heavily influenced subsequent approved Bible translations.\n|-\n|1525\n|Reformation in Strasbourg.\n|Lead by Martin Bucer, this reformation came to be perhaps the most influential of all those in city states of the Holy Roman Empire and Swiss Confederacy on the English reforms. The reformed church in Strasbourg cut a middle way, \"via media\", between Martin Luther's developing sacramental high church Protestantism and Ulrich Zwingli's low church views. Bucer would have a direct influence on Cranmer's reforms of the Church of England under Edward VI, during which time he came to England and remaining until his death, in Cambridge in 1551. He a direct hand in the composition and editing of the Book of Common Prayer.\n|-\n|1525, Summer-Autumn\n|Henry VIII meets Anne Boleyn and falls in love with her.\n|The king had previously conducted an affair with Mary Boleyn, Anne's older sister. The combination of the repeated fertility problems Henry had experienced with Catherine of Aragon and his infatuation with Anne will lead to the king suing for annulment to the Pope and undertaking ecclesiastical and constitutional reform when his case is refused.\n|-\n|1525, 24 December\n|Robert Barnes O.E.S.A, Prior of Cambridge Austin Friars, preached what is considered the first sermon of the Protestant reformation in England at Midnight Mass in the Church of St Edward King and Martyr, Cambridge.\n|First open deed of the growing Protestant movement at Cambridge University.\n|}\nAnnulment Crisis\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! Date\n! Event\n! Significance to the Reformation in England\n|-\n| 1526-7\n|Henry VIII sure of intentions to separate from his Queen, Catherine of Aragon.\n|This intention arose from repeated fertility problems with Queen Catherine, especially her failure to produce a surviving baby boy, and his growing infatuation with Anne Boleyn, who insisted on marriage before sleeping with him. It initiated first a series of attempts to secure an annulment of the marriage by existing Papal and English Ecclesiastical methods and when these failed the summoning of the Reformation Parliament, a series of anti papal and anti clerical laws, and ultimately the Act of Supremacy. The process would also see the fall of two of Henry's chief ministers, Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas More.\n|-\n|1527, 6-8 May\n|Sack of Rome by supposedly mutinous and unpaid troops of Charles V, Catherine of Aragon's nephew. Occupation continued until July and resolution between the Holy See and the Holy Roman Empire wasn't reached until June 1528.\n|A catastrophic event in the history of Rome during which the city was desecrated and Pope Clement VII was besieged in the Castel Sant'Angelo. This put the Papacy at mercy of the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg Dynasty, of which Catherine of Aragon was a member, especially during the crucial period of the Clement's embattlement between the beginning of the siege and his departure from the Castel in December 1527. During treaty negotiations, Charles V did much to dissuade the pope from accepting Henry's annulment arguments, towards which he had previously expressed some openness to Cardinal Wolsey.\n|-\n|1527, 17-27 May\n|Series of secret meetings held at York Place (later the Palace of Whitehall) to examine justifications for an annulment of Henry and Catherine's Marriage.\n|The meetings were between the Archbishops of York and Canterbury, Cardinal Wolsey and William Warham, and Henry himself and represent the first formal proceedings of the King's attempt to secure a separation from Catherine. Their discussions centered on the legitimacy of Julius II's dispensation for Henry and Catherine's marriage issued in 1503 and the relative importance in canon law of two contradictory Biblical verses. These were a verse of the Kedoshim from the Book of Leviticus: \"if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless\"; and it's contrary, from a text known as the Yibbum in the Book of Deuteronomy: \"If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband’s brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband’s brother unto her.\" The outcome of the debates was inconclusive however Wolsey was instructed to continue proceedings towards an annulment.\n|-\n|1527, 22 June\n|Henry summoned his Queen to inform her that their marriage was illegitimate. Catherine sobbed but had been forewarned of his intentions and defended her position saying she would await the judgement of the church.\n|The two were already estranged by this point and had likely ceased all marital intimacy in around 1524.\n|-\n|1527, November\n|Group of theological, ethical, biblical, and canon law scholars gathered at Hampton Court Palace to discuss the legitimacy of the King Henry and Queen Catherine's marriage.\n|This made the hitherto private annulment scandal (known as The Kings Great Matter) a matter of public knowledge.\n|-\n|1528\n|William Tyndale published The Obedience of a Christian Man, a central text of the English Reformation.\n|An apology for Caesaropapism, this text came into Henry's hands at a moment of personal conflict with church authority and thereby struck a chord with the monarch. While abhorring most of Tyndale's theology the arguments in Obedience came to inspire Henry's policy of overturning Papal supremacy in the Church of England and establishing Royal Supremacy (caresaropapiam) in its place. Tyndale for his part would later state his opposition to Henry's separation from Catherine of Aragon.\n|-\n|1529, 31 May\n|Opening session of the Blackfriars Legatine Court, a Legatine council held at London Blackfriars chaired by Thomas Wolsey, acting in the capacity of Papal Legate to England, and Lorenzo Campeggio, the Cardinal Protector of England.\n|The court was convened to formally rule on the legitimacy of Julius II's 1503 dispensation and consequently the relative importance of Leviticus 20:21 and Deuteronomy 25:5 (quoted above). In the course of its sessions it would hear pleas from both Henry and Catherine.\n|-\n|1529, 22 June\n|Queen Catherine gave a famous speech to her husband in defense of her position to the Legatine Court and, refusing to recognise any authority except the Pope's alone, immediately left the great hall at Blackfriars in protest.\n|The speech drew much sympathy entered the annals of English history as one of the great speeches of the Tudor Age.\n|-\n|1529, 18 July\n|Clement VII issues a revocation of the right to rule on the annulment dispute from the Legatine Court to Rome. His order would take around two weeks to arrive in London.\n|Effectively ends all English hopes of a solution to the Great Matter by recourse to Papally approved channels and, from Henry's perspective, necessitated the summing of the Reformation Parliament and both its initial campaign of anti clerical and anti papal sanctions and it's later reforming legislation.\n|-\n|1529, 30 July\n|Closing session of the Blackfriars Legatine Court after Cardinal Campeggio had declared a summer adjournment on the 23rd.\n|The court ended without resolving the question and before it reconvened Clement VII's writ of revocation arrived.\n|-\n|1529, 9 August\n|Writs issued summoning the Fifth Parliament of Henry VIII's reign to help solve the Annulment Crisis. It will come to be known as the Reformation Parliament.\n|Likely the result of the arrival of Clement VII's revocation of the case to Rome. This marked the beginning of a targeted campaign of anti clerical and anti papal sanctions which gradually evolved into a campaign of reformation legislation as Henry came under the influence of less conservative ministers and grew more impatient for his marriage to Anne.\n|-\n|1529, 1–4 October\n|Marburg Colloquy\n|Synod to discuss the differences between Lutheran and Zwinglian positions on the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Will define the essential opposition between the soft Lutheran and hard Reformed eucharistic theologies. While the English church will tend to an even more conservative view than Luther under Henry VIII it will adopt a generally Reformed theology under Edward. Elizabeth will reintroduce certain prayers that allow a latitudinarian toleration of both parties leading to the modern Church of England's essential division on the eucharistic question (see Eucharist in Anglicanism.\n|-\n|1529, 9 October\n|Wolsey charged under the Statute of Praemunire (see praemunire). He was thereby made a civil outlaw in England and was obliged to forfeit personal property.\n|Wolsey's charge of praemunire and subsequent outlawry was the legal mechanism whereby the king disbarred him from his seat in the House of Lords and acquired his significant personal estates, most notably Hampton Court Palace and York Place (later Whitehall Palace). Its use in this case effectively defined the Papacy and other structures of the Latin Church as foreign to England (contrary to most hitherto existent opinion) and foreshadowed the Statute in Restraint of Appeals. This marked the moment Cardinal Wolsey fell from favour as Henry's chief minister.\n|-\n|1529, 26 October\n|Thomas Wolsey removed as Lord Chancellor.\n|An l consequence of his outlawry.\n|-\n|1529, 3 November\n|State Opening of the first session of the Fifth Parliament of Henry's reign (known to history as the Reformation Parliament).\n|The first session of the assembly responsible for most of the legislation underpinning the Henrician Reformation, most notably the  Supplication against the Ordinaries, the Statute in Restraint of Appeals, the Act Concerning Ecclesiastical Appointments and Absolute Restraint of Annates, the Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations, and most importantly Henry's Act of Supremacy. It sat for an unusually lengthy total of nine sessions and was dissolved only in spring 1536.\n|-\n|1530\n|William Tyndale published The Practice of Prelates declaring his opposition to Henry's divorce proceedings and his belief that the Kings marriage to Catherine of Aragon was valid in Protestant eyes.\n|Shows that the authentic reformed tradition did not approve of Henry's justification for supremacy (securing an irregular annulment). Henry in his turn did much to suppress radical reformed thinkers and maintained a highly conservative theological position in the Church of England once he had secured supremacy.\n|-\n|1530\n|Thomas Cromwell, (pronounced Cromell) part of the inner ring of Henry's Privy Council. He had previously been in the service of Cardinal Wolsey of whom he remained deeply fond until his own execution a decade later.\n|Chief bureaucratic architect of the Henrician Reformation. He would come to be responsible for drafting the legal framework that overturned papal supremacy and established royal supremacy over the Church of England. He later oversaw the dissolution of the monasteries.\n|-\n|1530, 23 February\n|Thomas Hitton executed by burning at Maidstone in Kent.\n|Considered to be the first execution of a Protestant of the new Continental reformed model (as opposed to Lollards) in the English reformation.\n|-\n|1530, April\n|Cardinal Wolsey returns to his episcopal seat at York.\n|A response to both personal health problems and his homelessness in London following his charge of praemunire including his forfeiture of property and loss of place in both the Privy Council and House of Lords.\n|-\n|1530, Summer\n|Writs of Praemunire issued against 15 churchmen - including William Warham, John Fisher, John Clerk, and John Stokesley - who had recognised the Legatine Court of 1529 or appealed to Papal authority by other means.\n|Placed them in a state of civil outlawry under which their personal property was forfeited to the Crown and they were prevented from speaking in the House of Lords. The use of praemunire in these cases effectively defined the Papacy and other Roman Catholic structures as foreign to England and foreshadowed the Statute in Restraint of Appeals which in 1533 would strengthen the existing Statute of Praemunire.\n|-\n|1530, 29 November\n|Cardinal Wolsey died at Leicester Abbey of dysentery on his journey to London and imprisonment in the Tower.\n|His unfortunate illness likely spared him the fate of execution. His lost grave at Leicester Abbey (dissolved in 1538) is commemorated by a 20th century memorial.\n|-\n|1531\n|Henry revives ancient claim of English monarchs to the British imperium maius.\n|A revival of an ancient royal claim to supreme authority over both secular and ecclesiastical matters within the realm. This claim challenged papal jurisdiction and invoked the right of secular rulers to govern religious policy. Part of a series of strategies initially mustered to help in the Annulment Crisis but which ended up enabling the Reformation.\n|-\n|1531, 19 August\n|Thomas Bilney executed by burning at Lollards Pit in Norwich, Norfolk.\n|One of the many Protestants executed for maintaining reformed theology during Henry's reign.\n|-\n|1532\n|The Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Suffolk fall from royal favour.\n|The temporary fall from favour of Norfolk and Suffolk weakened the conservative pro papal faction at court, reducing opposition to Henry VIII’s religious and political reforms. Their diminished influence cleared the way for reformers like Thomas Cromwell to shape the Reformation.\n|-\n|1532, January\n|Supplication against the Ordinaries.\n|A formal petition to the King, debated and passed by the House of Commons, designed to give the appearance of widespread public unease and popular opposition to clerical privilege. It accused bishops of abusing judicial powers, particularly through harsh use of excommunication and church courts, and claimed the clergy placed foreign (papal) interests above those of England and demanded greater royal and parliamentary control over ecclesiastical authority. This was one of the key early acts of the English Reformation Parliament and precipitated the Submission of the Clergy accepted shortly after by the Convocation of Canterbury.\n|-\n|1532, May\n|Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates\n|Reduced the annual payment of annates to the papacy to just 5% of their original amount. Parliament threatened that it would withdraw all payments if Rome would not grant the King his annulment within one year. One of the key early acts of the Reformation Parliament, it was significantly strengthened by the later Act Concerning Ecclesiastical Appointments and Absolute Restraint of Annates which reserved all annates to the crown and the ''Peter's Pence Act 1533 which ended another key kind of payment from the English faithful to Rome.\n|-\n|1532, 15 May\n|Submission of the Clergy accepted by the Convocation of Canterbury.\n|A formal act in response to the Commons Supplication Against the Ordinaries'', by which the senior clergy of the Province of Canterbury of the Church of England acknowledged that they would no longer enact or enforce canon law without the King’s licence. By this submission, they surrendered their independent legislative authority, right of appeal to Rome, autonomy over ecclesiastical courts, and control over benefices and church property disputes, subordinating the legal and institutional life of the Church to the Crown. It is widely recognised as the moment the crisis begun in 1526 widened from the question of Henry's annulment to wider church reform.\n|-\n|1532, 16 May\n|Thomas More resigns as Lord Chancellor of England and the informal position of Henry's chief minister.\n|A resignation on principle against a perceived overstep of royal authority, a breaking of the coronation vow to protect the church's liberty. Due to More's fame as a humanist scholar and corespondent of Erasmus, his resignation deeply humiliated the king but also cleared one of the key supporters of papal supremacy out of the Privy Council opening the way for the further rise of Thomas Cromwell.\n|-\n|1532, June\n|Act in Conditional Restraint of Appeals.\n|An act of parliament that limited appeals to the Pope in ecclesiastical court cases, requiring that such appeals only proceed with the king’s permission. One of the key early acts of the Reformation Parliament, it was significantly strengthened by the later Act in Restraint of Appeals.\n|-\n|1532, August 22\n|William Warham, last pre-reformation Archbishop of Canterbury, dies at Hackington in Kent.\n|Died, like Wolsey, still under charge of praemunire. His death opened the way for the appointment of Thomas Cranmer as Archbishop the following year.\n|-\n|1532, December\n|Anne Boleyn falls pregnant.\n|Increased the urgency for Henry to marry Anne, both because it proved her fertility and to avoid the scandal of an illegitimate baby. Consequently, this increased the urgency to secure an immediate annulment, precipitating first the actions of the newly appointed Archbishop Cranmer, in contravention of papal rulings, and, in November 1534, the formal severance from Rome. It also proved that the couples claim to chastity awaiting marriage was, by this stage at least, false.\n|-\n|1533, 25 January\n|Henry VIII marries Anne Boleyn at Whitehall Palace.

It prompted Parliament to pass the Statute in Restraint of Appeals enabling Cranmer to formally declare Henry's marriage to Catherine illegitimate without fear of appeal to papal jurisdiction, which he did at Dunstable Priory later in the spring. When news reached Clement VII in July, he excommunicated Henry and Cranmer.\n|}\nHenrician Reformation\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! Date\n! Event\n! Significance to the Reformation in England\n|-\n|1533, 18 March\n|Thomas Cranmer, Archdeacon of Taunton, appointed Archbishop of Canterbury by Henry VII. His decision was formally confirmed by a rubber stamping vote of the monks of Canterbury Cathedral Priory a few days after.\n|An appointment motivated by the urgent need to secure annulment following Henry's clandestine marriage to Anne Boleyn on 25 January. Cranmer was a Cambridge-educated reformer—student at Jesus, later fellow at Magdalene—he was shaped by the White Horse Group, by his early experience of falling in love and marrying while on the path to priesthood and academia, and by his contact with continental reformers during his travels on diplomatic missions for the Crown. So long as Henry lived, largely maintained conservative theology in accordance with the King’s taste within the Church of England. In this capacity, he solemnised the annulment between Henry and Catherine of Aragon without regard to the earlier papal refusal to try to save the king from possible charges of polygamy following his marriage to Anne. After Henry’s death in 1547 and the accession of his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, he would become the principal force behind, and architect of, the Edwardian Reformation, rapidly implementing a moderate but firmly reformed theology as the orthodoxy of the Church of England by means of the Book of Common Prayer, Book of Homilies and Forty-two Articles.\n|-\n|1533, 30 March\n|Cranmer consecrated bishop in London at either Lambeth Palace Chapel or St Mary Aldermanbury. His enthronement in Canterbury Cathedral followed on April 4.\n|This was the moment Cranmer took his oath to the papacy as part of the liturgy of episcopal consecration, although neither Clement VII nor any of his successors granted the usual approval of appointments to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. His oath was frequently used against him both as a criticism including during his trial for heresy.\n|-\n|1533, March-April\n|Statute in Restraint of Appeals. Accepted by Parliament in the first week of April, granted Royal Assent on April 15.\n|This bill formed part of a strategy to establish the legal foundation of Henry VIII’s marriage to Anne Boleyn, enabling the courts of the Church of England to issue an annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon in formal schism with Holy See and the rest of the Latin Church. It removed the right to appeal from all subjects of the crown who wished to dispute the ruling of an English church court in the appellate court of the Roman Curia. This meant no one could either initiate proceedings to challenge the annulment or express public support for any ruling Rome might happen to make on its legitimacy. It was superseded the following year by the Act of Supremacy, which acknowledged full Royal Supremacy over the Church of England.\n|-\n|1533, 12 April\n|Thomas Cromwell made Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n|Cromwell was gradually becoming Henry VIII's Chief Minister taking up the position of Secretary of State and Master of the Rolls the following year. He would be a principal architect of the legislation that secured monarchical supremacy over the Church of England and the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n|-\n|1533, 23 May\n|Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, formally annulled Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon during a session of an extraordinary archiepiscopal court sitting at Dunstable Priory in Bedfordshire.\n|The proceedings of this court were enabled by the Statute in Restraint of Appeals, passed by Parliament a month earlier. It is the ruling which brought about a formal schism between the Church of England and the Holy See. The choice of setting was deliberately near Ampthill Castle, where Catherine of Aragon was living. She refused to recognise its judgement and maintained the legitimacy of her marriage to Henry until her death a few years later, in 1536. The ruling of the ecclesiastical court would be backed up by a ruling of Parliament in March the following year, when the Act of Succession ruled that Princess Mary was a bastard.\n|-\n|1533, 4 July\n|John Frith executed by burning at Smithfield.\n|\n|-\n|1533, 9 July\n|Pope Clement VII excommunicated Henry VIII and his advisers (including Thomas Cranmer) for the marriage to Anne Boleyn.\n|The write of excommunication included a caveat that it would be automatically void if the King separated from Anne before September. It was Henry VIII's first formal excommunication by the papacy.\n|-\n|1533, 7 September\n|Princess Elizabeth born at Greenwich Palace.\n|The future Queen (1558–1603) who would restore the Henrician and Edwardian Reformations and establish the Elizabethan Settlement, the foundation of the modern Church of England.\n|-\n|1534, March\n|Act Concerning Ecclesiastical Appointments and Absolute Restraint of Annates.\n|The bill achieved two ends: firstly, established the monarch's unilateral authority to appoint all bishops and abbots, reducing papal influence on English ecclesiastical offices; secondly, it ended the payment of annates to the Pope, redirecting them to the English Crown. In its first capacity, it legitimised the appointment of Archbishop Cranmer without papal approval and all subsequent royal appointments to English bishoprics. In its second capacity, it strengthened the Act in Conditional Restraint of Annates passed by parliament in 1532.\n|-\n|1534, March\n|''Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations''.\n|Abolished the Kingdom of England's payment of Peter’s Pence and prohibited subjects of the crown from accepting papal dispensations and privileges unless approved by the King.\n|-\n|1534, March\n|First Act of Succession.\n|The act achieved three key ends. Firstly, it enforced universal recognition of the royal marriage by a universal public Oath of Succession for all clergy, secular officials, and university academics, as well as any subject called upon to take the oath, with dissenters suffering punishment for High Treason. This was a momentous step, the first time the ordinary common men of England were required to take an oath as a whole body. Secondly, the act altered the line of succession following the logic of annulment. An annulment is the formal recognition that a given marriage is illicit, that it never existed, and that therefore all children produced by it are illegitimate. In the case of Henry and Catherine of Aragon it followed that Princess Mary was a bastard, excluded from the royal succession. Her title of Princess was discarded in favour of Lady Mary. Thirdly, it removed all previous legislation implying the dependence of the English succession on the Pope for its legitimacy and forbade the opinion to subjects.\n|-\n|1534, 20 April\n|Execution of Elizabeth Barton (The Holy Maid of Kent) together with her confessor Edward Bocking OSB and 6 of her supporters in the churchyard of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate in the City of London.\n|One of the key popular voices against Henry’s annulment and marriage to Anne. Her death marked a stark warning against dissent to the King’s policies.\n|-\n|1534, November\n|First Act of Supremacy.\n|This act above all others formalised the Church of England's schism from the Holy See and the rest of the Latin Church by clearly acknowledging the principle of Royal Supremacy and the full rejection of Papal Supremacy. Firstly, the act recognised that the English monarch was \"of the Church of England in Earth, under Jesus Christ, Supreme Head\", allegedly an ancient principle and title revived rather than an entirely new constitutional role. Secondly, it rejected all papal authority over either the Church of England's ecclesiastical courts, strengthening the earlier acts, or its ruling on its religious doctrine, a fundamentally new step. Thirdly, the act required all clergy and secular officials - this time extended to all local borough officers and all school teachers - as well as any subject called upon to take the oath, to swear a new Oath of Supremacy formally affirming their assent to the principle of Royal Supremacy in the Church of England.\n|-\n|1534, November\n|Treason Act.\n|Essentially the legislative framework for persecuting those who objected to the Act of Supremacy and the principle of the Royal Supremacy as traitors by expanding the definition of treason to include denial of the King’s supremacy over the Church. It made refusal of the Oath of Supremacy or speaking against the King’s religious authority a capital offence. Thus all Roman Catholic's going forward would be punished by either beheading for nobility or hanging, drawing, and quartering as traitors while all radical Protestants would by punished by burning under the old unrevised Heresy Acts passed against the Lollards.\n|-\n|1534, November\n|Act of First Fruits and Tenths.\n|Required that the remaining clerical levies paid by the English parish clergy to the Holy See should henceforth go to the monarch.

Because of her Protestant views, only the low-ranking Owen Oglethorpe, Bishop of Carlisle, is willing to officiate.\n|The last Catholic coronation of a British monarch.\n|-\n|1558-59\n|Elizabethan Religious Settlement, a compromise which secured a return to a Reformed Protestantism but allowed some Catholic traditions such as kneeling for Communion and the sign of the cross to continue.\n|The Elizabethan Settlement finally established the norms of Anglican doctrine around the principle of the via media which, apart from during The Interregnum, has remained the bedrock of the Church of England's identity ever since.\n|-\n|1559, 31 March\n|Opening session of the Westminster Conference held in Westminster Hall to determine Elizabeth's religious policy.\n|\n|-\n|1559, May 8\n|Act of Supremacy 1558 confirmed Elizabeth as Head of the Church of England and abolished the authority of the Pope in England.\n|Final schism between the Church of England with the Roman Papacy.

The uncertain circumstances of his private consecration gave rise to the Nag's Head Fable popular among recusants. He was the second of Englands Protestant Primates\n|-\n|1559-1560\n|Scottish Reformation\n|Lead by John Knox and the Lords of the Congregation. Will do much to impact the Long Reformation in England once the crowns are united following Elizabeth's death. The Presbyterian polity Knox established in the Church of Scotland would be a significant source of inspiration for the Puritans of the Church of England.\n|-\n|1560\n|Geneva Bible published in Switzerland\n|Published by Sir Rowland Hill.  Although never authorised for use in England, it was the first English Bible to be divided into verses and became popular with Dissenters.\n|-\n|1563\n|First publication of a revision of Cranmer's Book of Homilies.\n|An edited reprint of Cranmer's earlier Book of Homilies, this book provided prescribed sermons to ensure doctrinal unity across the Church of England.\n|-\n|1568\n|''Bishops' Bible'' published\n|A compromise between the vigorous but Calvinist Geneva Bible and the Great Bible, which it replaces in parish churches.\n|-\n|1569, 9 November—1570, 21 January\n|The Rising of the Northern Earls against Elizabeth in an attempt to install Mary, Queen of Scots as monarch of England.\n|Intensifies anti Catholic reprisals and strengthens Elizabeth's position.\n|-\n|1570, 27 April\n|Pope Pius V excommunicates Elizabeth I in the bull Regnans in Excelsis declaring her a heretic and threatening those who obeyed her laws with excommunication.\n|\n|-\n|1571, August\n|Ridolfi plot to overthrow Elizabeth I and restore state Catholicism.\n|A plot by the Duke of Norfolk, Roberto di Ridolfo, and several European Catholic dignitaries including the Pope and the King of Spain to replace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots.\n|-\n|1571\n|The Thirty-nine Articles of Religion finalised and accepted as the Church of England's principle doctrinal statement.\n|The mature theological expression of the Elizabethan Settlement. These articles, a revised edition of Cranmer's Forty-two Articles of Religion, were appended to the Book of Common Prayer. Apart from a period during The Interregnum, this has remained the Church of England's core statement of faith (aside from the three Ecumenical Creeds) ever since and still plays a fundamental role in Anglican doctrine today.\n|-\n|1571\n|First publication of a new Book of Homilies.\n|Like Cranmer's earlier Book of Homilies, this book provided prescribed sermons to ensure doctrinal unity across the Church of England. It was largely written by Matthew Parker and designed to be supplement the previous editions.\n|-\n|1572, 2 June\n|Execution of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk for his role in the Ridolfi plot.\n|\n|-\n|1572, 22 August\n|Execution of Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland in York for his role in the Rising of the Northern Earls.\n|One of the Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation, he was subsequently beatified by Pope Leo XIII on 13 May 1895.\n|-\n|1572, 24 August\n|St Bartholomew's Day Massacre begins in Paris.\n|Sends shockwaves throughout Protestant Europe and sparks a wave of Huguenots seeking refuge in England from French Catholic persecution.\n|-\n|1574\n|Peter Baro, a French Huguenot refugee was appointed Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge.\n|A proto-Arminian, this marked a new departure in English Protestant theology.\n|-\n|1575, 17 May\n|Matthew Parker dies.\n|\n|-\n|1575, 29 December\n|Edmund Grindal enthroned as Archbishop of Canterbury.\n|The third Protestant Primate of All England. A radical Protestant (see puritans) he caused significant controversy during his brief tenure.\n|-\n|1578, January\n|Elizabeth I tries to have Edmund Grindal deprived of office.\n|Grindal was pushing for more puritanical reforms in the Church of England in relations to vestments, kneeling, and the use of the sigh of the cross. He resigns in 1583.\n|-\n|1581\n|Robert Browne attempted to set up a separatist Puritan congregation in Norwich to avoid the governmental norms of a Church of England parish. He failed and went into exile.\n|In exile Browne published many works espousing his progressive ecclesiology. These works inspired a radical puritan movement known as the Brownists. A majority of those onboard the Mayflower were Brownists. They are considered an antecedent to the later post Civil War Independents who became the modern Congregationalists. Browne's teachings are still explicitly looked to by the Congregational Federation and would come to be implicitly adopted by modern Non-denominational Christians.\n|-\n|1581, 1 December\n|Edmund Campion was executed by hanging, drawing, and quartering at Tyburn.\n|The leader of the early Jesuit mission to English recusants and hidden Catholics, his execution is among the most notable of the many hundreds who died for their Catholic faith.\n|-\n|1583, 14 August\n|John Whitgift appointed Archbishop of Canterbury.\n|The fourth Protestant Primate of All England.\n|-\n|1583\n|Elizabeth I commissions John Whitgift to reorganise the Court of High Commission. Part of this involved the appointment of the first Ecclesiastical Commission of the Church of England.\n|Repressed Puritan extremism of the kind typified by Genevan and Scottish Presbyterian minded reformers such as Edmund Grindal and Thomas Cartwright and Separatists such Robert Browne. Initiated many more proceedings against Puritan Church of England priests who conscientiously objected to certain surviving Catholic elements in Anglican liturgy (the use of the sign of the cross, the rigid liturgical form of the Book of Common Prayer, and the deliberately ambiguous words Elizabeth's 1559 version (which has survived in today's 1662 version) used to try and reconcile both widespread belief in the real presence and the firmly spiritualist or memorialist Puritans). Principal moment of Elizabethan ecclesiastical authoritarianism in Puritan eyes.\n|-\n|1583, November\n|The Throckmorton Plot is uncovered.\n|One of a series of Catholic plots to overthrow Elizabeth I and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots.\n|-\n|1586, 25 March\n|Margaret Clitherow, Catholic housewife, shopkeeper, and schoolmistress, executed by being crushed to death on the banks of the River Ouse in York.\n|One of the many recusant martyrs of the Elizabethan age.\n|-\n|1586, July\n|The Babington Plot is uncovered by government spies.\n|Mary, Queen of Scots is implicated along with a few other Catholic nobles.

The putative marriage was part of a planned peace treaty between Catholic Spain and Protestant England. It provoked significant opposition among England's House of Commons thanks to memory of the Catholic restoration and Protestant martyrdoms under the co-regency of Philip II and Mary I and the more recent Anglo-Spanish War of 1585-1604 including the infamous Spanish Armada of 1588.\n|-\n|1616\n|Thomas Helwys dies from maltreatment in prison.\n|A major figure in the foundation of the English Baptists and the General Baptist (i.e. anti Calvinist baptists).\n|-\n|1618, 13 November\n|Synod of Dort opening session.\n|A highly significant council in the history of reformed theology whose delegates would write the Canons of Dort, still considered normative by all Calvinist churches.

Significance to the Reformation in England\n|-\n|1642\n|English Civil War breaks out\n|Arose as a reaction against Charles I's autocracy, the unpopular High Church reforms of William Laud, and the growing discontent with episcopal polity in the Church of England.\n|-\n|1643\n|Westminster Assembly of Divines worked to restructure the Church of England.\n|This might be called the attempted Puritan or Presbyterian Reformation.\n|-\n|1644\n|Directory for Public Worship published by the Westminster Assembly\n|Intended as a replacement to the Book of Common Prayer and the Royalist assumptions and Catholic traditions it's liturgy required parish congregations to assent to.\n|-\n|1644\n|Westminster Confession of Faith published by the Westminster Assembly\n|to replace the Thirty-nine Articles as the Church of England's doctrinal statement, the most progressively Protestant doctrinal statement in its history. It was never formally adopted by parliament in England and was firmly rejected by the reaffirmation of the Thirty-nine articles required by the Act of Uniformity 1662. It remains a fundamental text in Reformed Churches, both Presbyterian and Congregationalist, across the world today. In Britain it remains a central text in the Church of Scotland, the established church north of the border, the United Reformed Church, and the Congregational Federation.\n|-\n|1644, October\n|First London Baptist Confession published.\n|The first major confession of faith put forward by English Baptists defining a position against both the Presbyterian Westminster Assembly and continental Anabaptist radicals.\n|-\n|1645, 10 January\n|Execution of Archbishop William Laud.\n|Noted high churchman and figure of hatred for puritans.\n|-\n|1645\n|The Form of Presbyterial Church Government published by the Westminster Assembly\n|A comprehensive program for replacing episcopal polity with presbyterian polity in the Church of England. It was modelled on the structure of Dutch and the Swiss Reformed Churches. It was adopted the same year it was published by the Church of Scotland and remains the foundational text of Scottish church government. In England, like the Westminster Confession, parliament failed to pass it as law for the Church of England. Many of its structures were implemented during the interregnum across England but without legal support and with the 1650 repeal of the Act of Uniformity attendance was never a requirement and many local parishes, both royalist ones and those more radical than the Presbyterian Westminster Assembly, rejected it.\n|-\n|1646, October\n|Parliament passes an ordinance abolishing bishops and archbishops in the Church of England\n|Temporarily replaces the historically Episcopal polity of the Church of England with a Presbyterian polity.  In practice, in more radical areas and areas where Royalist loyalties remained strong, this led to a completely anarchic congregational polity with some parishes choosing more radical liturgical forms and the majority persevering with the Book of Common Prayer.\n|-\n|1648\n|John Owen published The Death of Death in the Death of Christ.\n|A defence of the Calvinist Doctrine of Particular Redemption upheld by the Westminster Confession against Arminianism, Amyraldism, and Universalism. Together with Richard Baxter's Aphorisms of Redemption, which asserted the contrary Doctrine of Universal Atonement, the text would be the foundation of the conservative position in a major rift which still characterises most of the nonconformist churches of Britain to this day.\n|-\n|1648, 6 December\n|Pride's Purge of the Long Parliament of Presbyterian and Royalist sympathising MP's to the remaining Independents of the Rump Parliament.\n|This ends the possibility of the Puritan Presbyterian reformation so long hoped for by Calvinists within the Church Of England and planned by the Westminster Assembly. It also leads to a period of comparative leniency shown to Independent congregations and radical forms of Protestantism.\n|-\n|1649, 30 January\n|Execution of Charles I\n|The Regicide sent shockwaves through the nations consciousness, emboldened appetites for religious progress, and precipitated a royal martyrs cult among the Royalists.\n|-\n|1649, 9 February\n|Eikon Basilike published.\n|Initiation of the cult of King Charles the Martyr among royalists which then spread to the rest of the Church of England following The Restoration.\n|-\n|1649\n|Richard Baxter published his Aphorisms of Redemption.\n|A response to John Owen's Death of Death in the Death of Christ advocating the contrary Doctrine of Universal Atonement. Baxter's and Owen's works came to represent the foundational texts of two distinct camps of thought that still dominate both the nonconformist and Anglican churches to this day.\n|-\n|1650, May\n|Act of Uniformity 1558 repealed by the Rump Parliament by the Act for the Repeal of several Clauses in Statutes imposing Penalties for not coming to Church\n|The end of compulsory attendance in the established Church of England. Although a new Act of Uniformity was imposed in 1662 the habit of universal attendance in the parish church was effectively ended by this repeal with Quakers, Baptists, Congregationalists, and, after the Restoration, the Presbyterians too, often refusing to observe the 1662 legislation (see history of the Puritans from 1649).\n|-\n|1652, 13 June\n|George Fox preaches on Firbank Fell to a group of over a thousand spiritual seekers.\n|This sermon is considered one of the  foundational events of the History of Quakerism. The Quakers (or the Religious Society of Friends as they later came to call themselves) represent the most radical surviving nonconformist church to emerge from the Civil War and the religious liberty of the Interregnum. Fox's message was founded  on a teaching that God dwells in each person and so is immediately accessible to all without any need for either clergy, sacraments, or even necessarily scripture (Fox affirmed that interior mystical experience, while accessible without any biblical knowledge, would agree with the Bible if genuine).\n|-\n|1655, 15 January\n|John Biddle's Unitarian Twofold Catechism condemned by the First Protectorate Parliament and blasphemy prosecution is considered.\n|The question of the blasphemy of other sects was raised by this measure and many came to Biddle's defence, not in support of his anti Trinitarianism or his Arianism, but because his prosecution would have left all dissenters vulnerable to prosecution.\n|-\n|1656, 24 October\n|James Nayler entered the town of Bristol in the manner of the Christs triumphal entry.\n|The event caused outrage, Naylor was imprisoned, and the Quaker movement was severely shaken and disgraced. It initiated a cooling in Quaker radicalism which enabled it to survive the restoration.\n|-\n|1658, 3 September\n|Death of Oliver Cromwell.\n|Leads to an immediate constitutional crisis which continues for the following year and ends with the Stuart Restoration and the reestablishment of the episcopate of the Church of England as it had existed prior to the Civil War.\n|-\n|1658, 12 October\n|Opening session of the Savoy Assembly. It met for 11 or 12 days.\n|Drafted the Savoy Declaration, the foundational doctrinal statement of Congregationalism and their formal schism from the other Presbyterian Puritans.

Significance to the Reformation in England\n|-\n|1688-89\n|The Glorious Revolution\n|The Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689 firmly and finally established Protestantism as the national faith under William III and Mary II. The revolution led to the passing of the Toleration Act 1689, which granted limited freedom of worship to Nonconformist (Protestantism), Nonconformist Protestants, though Roman Catholicism and Unitarianism remained excluded. The requirement of allegiance to the new monarchs caused a schism in the Church of England, as several bishops and clergy—known as the Nonjurors—refused the oath of allegiance and were deprived of office. The revolution also effectively ended any prospect of a Catholic monarch in Britain, as enshrined in the subsequent Bill of Rights 1689 and later reinforced by the Act of Settlement 1701.\n|-\n|1689, 3-12 September\n|Second London Baptist Confession ratified by a synod representing 100 Calvinistic or Particular Baptist conventicles.\n|The Confession had been drafted over a decade previous in 1677. This assembly reaccepted it as an orthodox and biblical formulation of Baptist doctrine and thereafter came to represent the principle doctrinal statement of the English Baptists.\n|-\n|1690, February–May\n|Nine bishops — William Sancroft (Archbishop of Canterbury), Thomas Ken (Bishop of Bath and Wells), Francis Turner (Bishop of Ely), John Lake (Bishop of Chichester), Thomas White (Bishop of Peterborough), Thomas Cartwright (Bishop of Chester), Robert Frampton (Bishop of Gloucester), William Lloyd (Bishop of Norwich), William Thomas (Bishop of Worcester) — are deprived of office for refusing to take the 1689 Oath of Allegiance to William III and Mary II.\n|These deprivations marked the beginning of the Nonjuring schism, as the ejected bishops and their supporters maintained loyalty to the exiled Stuart dynasty and continued episcopal succession outside the established Church.\n|}\nSee also\n*English Reformation\n*Edwardian Reformation\n*Elizabethan Religious Settlement\n*List of Catholic martyrs of the English Reformation\n*List of Protestant martyrs of the English Reformation\n*Lollardy\n*Timeline of the English Civil War\n*Timeline of British history (1500–1599)\n*Timeline of British history (1600–1699)\nExternal links\n* [http://www.eldrbarry.net/heidel/ereftl.pdf Timeline of the English Reformation and Development of the Anglican Church]."
