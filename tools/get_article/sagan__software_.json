It is written in C and uses a multi-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event analysis. Sagan's structure and rules work similarly to the Sourcefire Snort IDS/IPS engine. This allows Sagan to be compatible  with Snort or Suricata rule management software and gives Sagan the ability to correlate with Snort IDS/IPS data.\nSagan supports different output formats for reporting and analysis, log normalization, script execution on event detection, GeoIP detection/alerting and time sensitive alerting.\nSee also\n* Host-based intrusion detection system comparison\nReferences\nSources\n* [https://github.com/shadowbq/sagan-extras/blob/master/sagan_freebsd.howto.md HOWTO build Sagan on FreeBSD]\n* [http://traffic.libsyn.com/pauldotcom/PaulDotCom-356-Part1.mp3 Champ Clark talks about Sagan on \"Pauldotcom Security weekly\" - December, 12th, 2013.]\n* [http://handlers.sans.org/gbruneau/papers/Guy_Bruneau_BSides_Ottawa_2014.pdf Log, Log, Log Everything Remotely.]\nExternal links\n* [https://quadrantsec.com/sagan_solution/ About Sagan]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150721121918/https://wiki.quadrantsec.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SaganMain Official Sagan Wiki]\n*[https://quadrantsec.com/about/blog/sagan_flowbit/ Sagan flowbits]\n*[https://quadrantsec.com/about/blog/using_sagan_with_bro_intelligence_feeds/ Using Sagan with Bro Intelligence feeds]\n*[https://quadrantsec.com/about/blog/sagan_output_to_other_siems/ Sagan output to other SIEMs.]"
