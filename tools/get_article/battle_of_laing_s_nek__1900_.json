At the time, Redvers Buller was advancing from Ladysmith to the Buffalo River, in an effort to cross into Volskrust, where he could then aid Lord Roberts in the Advance on Pretoria. The Boers had fortified themselves at Laing's Nek, as they had done previously 18 years prior. Over the course of eight days, Buller was able to repulse the Boers, and cross the Buffalo River into Transvaal on 12 June.\nReferences"
