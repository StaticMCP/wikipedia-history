Many of the Danes who settled in the Wairarapa were veteran of the Prusso-Danish War of 1864 or refugees from Slesvig. Living amongst these early Scandinavian settlers and listening to their many tales sparked George's life-long interest in history.\nHe received his education at Mauriceville West School and Masterton District High School. During school, Petersen had boarded with the Cairns family. He trained as a barrister and solicitor under Edward Orr Hurley and was admitted in 1924, then moving to live in Palmerston North.\nPetersen married his former Mauriceville West classmate Elizabeth \"Stella\" Osberta Cairns on 27 December 1926, and they had a daughter, Phyllis Potter born in 1927 and twins George Bouet Petersen and Wendy Cutfield born in 1933.\nStella, a school teacher, died in 1963. Following her death, George married her sister, Coyla Samuella May Foote on 4 September 1965. Coyla, also a school teacher, died in 1974.\nCommunity contribution\nGeorge was author of six historical publications, four editor of Who's Who in NZ, PN City Councilor between 1947 and 1950, and received the Coronation Medal in 1953. As a member of the Danish Society in Palmerston North, he raised money for the Danish underground during the Second World War, being awarded the King Christian X's Liberty Medal in 1946. From 1948, he acted as NZ's vice-consul for Denmark, and was appointed consul in 1966. He was New Zealand's liaison person for the second Galathea expedition  (Danish Navy's world circumnavigation) for which he was awarded the Danish Galathea Medal in 1952, and for his overall contribution to Denmark was made Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1958, and was promoted to Knight 1st Class in 1968. In 1964 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters, Massey University’s second ever awarded doctorate.\nSelected publications\n* 1948  William Colenso (with A.G.
