      "text": "# The Wizards and the Warriors\n\nThe Wizards and the Warriors is a 1986 novel written by Hugh Cook. It is the first volume in Cook’s Chronicles of an Age of Darkness series, which combines sword-and-sorcery adventure with dark humor and complex worldbuilding.\nPlot summary\nThe Wizards and the Warriors is a novel in which the theme is wizards.\nReception\nWendy Graham reviewed The Wizards and the Warriors for Adventurer magazine and stated that \"This is a standard Wizards sort of book. Nothing really special about it. Could use hard editing at time and expanding at others, as people you thought had been killed suddenly re-appear with the barest of explanations, if any.\"\nSte Dillon reviewed The Wizards and the Warriors for Adventurer magazine and stated that \"Perhaps the only real bad point is the idyllic preservation of justice and punishment for wrong-doers; it has a sort of adult fairy-tale ending which just doesn't happen in reality. Does it?\"\nInterzone reviewed The Wizards and the Warriors negatively, calling it overlong, uninteresting, and with poor control of tone.\nReviews\n*Review by Pauline E. Dungate [as by Pauline Morgan] (1987) in Fantasy Review, January-February 1987\n*Review by Ken Lake (1987) in Vector 136\n*Review by Andy Sawyer (1987) in Paperback Inferno, #65\nReferences"
