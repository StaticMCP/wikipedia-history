The first trip was made by Herbert Hoover (as president-elect) in 1928. During this tour he delivered twenty-five speeches in ten Central and South American countries, almost all of which stressed his plans to reduce American political and military interference in Latin American affairs. In sum, he pledged that the United States would act as a \"good neighbor.\"\nThe first official visits by a sitting president were those of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and were an offshoot of Allied diplomatic interactions during World War II. Of the 12 independent countries on the continent, all but Bolivia, Guyana and  Paraguay have been visited by an American president. Ecuador has only been visited by a president elect.\nTable of visits\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!President\n!Dates\n!Countries\n!Locations\n!Key details\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Herbert Hoover\n|\n|\n|Guayaquil\n|Met with President Isidro Ayora.\n|-\n|\n|\n|Lima\n| Met with President Augusto B.
