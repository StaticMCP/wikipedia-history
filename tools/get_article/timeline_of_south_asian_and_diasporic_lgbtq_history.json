      "text": "# Timeline of South Asian and diasporic LGBTQ history\n\nThis is a timeline of notable events in the history of non-heterosexual conforming people of South Asian ancestry, who may identify as LGBTIQGNC (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, third gender, gender nonconforming), men who have sex with men, or related culturally-specific identities such as Hijra, Aravani, Thirunangaigal, Khwajasara, Kothi, Thirunambigal, Jogappa, Jogatha, or Shiva Shakti. The recorded history traces back at least two millennia.\nThis timeline includes events both in South Asia and in the global South Asian diaspora, as the histories are deeply linked. South Asia includes the modern day nations of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma (Myanmar), India, Maldives, Nepal,  Sri Lanka; in some references, the South Asian subcontinent will also include Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tibet. The South Asian diaspora includes, but is not limited to South Asian LGBTQ communities in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Caribbean Islands, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere.\nEarly history\n400 BCE - 200 BCE\n* Sculptures on temples and artwork from around 500 BC in Lanka depict liberal views on sexuality and homosexuality.\n* Vatsyayana's The Kama Sutra devotes an entire chapter to homosexuality with explicit detailed instructions on how to perform homosexual acts.\n3rd century BC to c. 4th century AD\n* Tamil Sangam literature refers to relationships between two men and explores the lives of trans women in the Aravan cult in Koovagam village in Tamil Nadu.\n~1529\n* Emperor Babur's memoirs, the Baburnama, include a recollection of a supposed homoerotic relationship with a teenage boy.\n1530s\n* The Fatawa-e-Alamgiri of the Mughal Empire mandated a common set of punishments for homosexuality, which could include 50 lashes for a slave, 100 for a free infidel, or death by stoning for a Muslim.\n1750-1830\n* Emergence of Rekhti chapti-namahs, or female non-sexual homosocial narratives, in Urdu poetry.\n1861\n* Anti-sodomy section of Offences against the Person Act 1861 imposed on entire British Empire, that says \"Whosoever shall be convicted of the abominable Crime of Buggery, committed either with Mankind or with any Animal, shall be liable, at the Discretion of the Court, to be kept in Penal Servitude for Life or for any Term not less than Ten Years.\" This section is credited with giving birth to the controversial Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code.\n1871\n* Hijras labeled a \"criminal tribe\" under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, meaning they could be arrested as criminals anywhere in British India.\n1897\n* Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 amended, with the subtitle \"An Act for the Registration of Criminal Tribes and Eunuchs\", ordering that \"criminal\" eunuchs \"dressed or ornamented like a woman in a public street… be arrested without warrant\" and imprisoned.\n1918\n*  Earliest known records of South Asian MSM in North America, as Tara Singh and Jamil Singh are separately arrested for interracial sodomy in Sacramento, CA.\n1922\n* Poems Written in Prison by Gopabandhu Das, a freedom fighter and Gandhian, is published.
