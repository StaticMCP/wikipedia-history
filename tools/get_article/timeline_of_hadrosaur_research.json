Scientific research on hadrosaurs began in the 1850s, when Joseph Leidy described the genera Thespesius and Trachodon based on scrappy fossils discovered in the western United States. Just two years later he published a description of the much better-preserved remains of an animal from New Jersey that he named Hadrosaurus''.\nThe early 20th century saw such a boom in hadrosaur discoveries and research that paleontologists' knowledge of these dinosaurs \"increased by virtually an order of magnitude\" according to a 2004 review by Horner, Weishampel, and Forster. This period is known as the great North American Dinosaur rush because of the research and excavation efforts of paleontologists like Brown, Gilmore, Lambe, Parks, and the Sternbergs. Major discoveries included the variety of cranial ornamentation among hadrosaurs as scientist came to characterize uncrested, solid crested, and hollow crested species. Notable new taxa included  Saurolophus, Corythosaurus, Edmontosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. In 1942 Richard Swann Lull and Wright published what Horner, Weishampel, and Forster characterized as the \"first important synthesis of hadrosaurid anatomy and phylogeny\".\nMore recent discoveries include gigantic hadrosaurs like Shantungosaurus giganteus from China. At 15 meters in length and nearly 16 metric tons in weight it is the largest known hadrosaur and is known from a nearly complete skeleton.\nHadrosaur research has continued to remain active even into the new millennium. In 2000, Horner and others found that hatchling Maiasaura grew to adult body sizes at a rate more like a mammal's than a reptile. That same year, Case and others reported the discovery of hadrosaur bones in Vega Island, Antarctica. After decades of such dedicated research, hadrosaurs have become one of the best understood group of dinosaurs.\n19th century\n1850s\nsyntype]]\nteeth]]\n]]\n1856\n* Joseph Leidy described the new genus and species Thespesius occidentalis. He also described the new genus and species Trachodon mirabilis. Although both species were based on poorly preserved material, this paper was the first to be published on hadrosaurid dinosaurs.\n1858\n* Leidy described the new genus and species Hadrosaurus foulkii. He thought it was an amphibious animal.\n1860s\n1868\n* Leidy collaborated with artist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins to mount Hadrosaurus foulkii for the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. This became both the first mounted dinosaur skeleton ever mounted for public display and also one of the most popular exhibits in the history of the academy. Estimates have the Hadrosaurus exhibit as increasing the number of visitors by up to 50%.\n1869\n* Edward Drinker Cope described the new genus and species Hypsibema crassicauda.\n* Cope named the Hadrosauridae. He observed that the primary distinguishing trait of the group was their dental battery.\n* Cope described the new genus and species Ornithotarsus immanis.\n1870s\n1870\n* Othniel Charles Marsh described the new species Hadrosaurus minor.\n1871\n* Cope described the new species Hadrosaurus cavatus.\n1872\n* Marsh described the new species Hadrosaurus agilis.\n1874\n* Cope described the new species Agathaumas milo.

He also described the new species Diclonius pentagonus, Diclonius perangulatus, and Dysganus encaustus.\n1880s\nlimb bones]]\n]]\n1883\n* Harry Govier Seeley described the new genus and species Orthomerus dolloi.\n* Cope still regarded hadrosaurs as amphibious.\n1888\n* Richard Lydekker described the new species Trachodon cantabrigiensis.\n1889\n* Marsh described the new species Hadrosaurus breviceps. He also described the new species Hadrosaurus paucidens.\n* Cope described the new genus and species Pteropelyx grallipes.\n1890s\n1890\n* Marsh erected the new genus Claosaurus to house the species Hadrosaurus agilis. He also described the new species Trachodon longiceps.\n1892\n* Marsh described the new species Claosaurus annectens.\n* Cope described the new genus and species Claorhynchus trihedrus.\n* Newton described the new species Iguanodon hilli.\n20th century\n1900s\n1900\n* Franz Nopcsa described the new genus and species Limnosaurus transsylvanicus.\n1902\n* Lawrence Lambe described the new genus and species Trachodon altidens; in the same volume, he suggested the name Didanodon for the same species, but the validity of this name has been questioned. He also described the new species Trachodon marginatus. He also described the new species Trachodon selwyni.\n1903\n* Nopcsa erected the new genus Telmatosaurus to house the species Limnosaurus transsylvanicus, as the latter genus name was preoccupied .\n* George Wieland described the new species Claosaurus affinis.\n1910\nholotype]]\n]]\n1910\n* Barnum Brown described the new genus Hecatasaurus. He also described the new genus and species Kritosaurus navajovius.\n1912\n* Brown described the new genus and species Saurolophus osborni.\n1913\n* Brown described the new genus and species Hypacrosaurus altispinus.\n* Cutler excavated a juvenile Gryposaurus now catalogued by the Canadian Museum of Nature as CMN 8784. The site of the excavation has since been designated \"quarry 252\".\n* Winter: Cutler partly prepared the young Gryposaurus specimen, possibly in Calgary while working on dinosaurs for Euston Sisely.\n1914\n* Brown described the new genus and species Corythosaurus casuarius.\n* Lambe described the new genus and species Gryposaurus notabilis''.\n1915\n* Charles H. Sternberg's crew excavated a Corythosaurus from quarry 243 in Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada. The specimen would later be displayed at the Calgary Zoo.\n* Matthew observed that fossils of hadrosaur eggs and hatchlings were absent in coastal areas and suggested that hadrosaurs may have preferred nesting grounds further inland. He believed that these inland nesting grounds were actually where hadrosaurs first evolved and therefore to breed, hadrosaurs retraced their ancestors route back to their place of origin. After hatching, the young hadrosaurs would spend some time inland maturing before migrating out to more coastal areas.\nspecimen collected 1921, Royal Ontario Museum]]\n1916\n* Brown described the new genus and species Prosaurolophus maximus.\n1917\n* Lambe described the new genus and species Edmontosaurus regalis.\n* Lambe described the new genus and species Cheneosaurus tolmanensis.\n1918\n* Lambe named the Hadrosaurinae.\n1920s\n]]\n]]\n1920\n* Matthew described the new genus Procheneosaurus.\n* Parks described the new species Kritosaurus incurvimanus.\n1922\n* William Parks described the new genus and species Parasaurolophus walkeri.\n* Krausel reported fossil gut contents from an Edmontosaurus annectens mummy.

The concluded that Edmontosaurus regalis lived near the coasts while Hypacrosaurus altispinus and Saurolophus osborni lived slightly more inland.\n1968\n* Rozhdeventsky described the new genus and species Aralosaurus tubiferous. He also described the new species Procheneosaurus convincens.\n1970s\n1970\n* Galton argued that the anatomy of the hadrosaur pelvis was more consistent with a horizontal posture like that seen in modern flightless birds than with the \"kangaroo\" posture they were often reconstructed in.\n1971\n* Dodson argued that hadrosaurs may not have fed exclusively on land.\n1973\n* Hu described the new genus and species Shantungosaurus giganteus.\n1975\nand hatchlings]]\n* Dodson found evidence for sexual and ontogenetic dimorphism in two different kinds of lambeosaurine using morphometrics.\n1976\n* Zhen described the new species Tanius laiyengensis.\n1979\n* Brett-Surman erected the new genus Gilmoreosaurus to house the species Mandschurosaurus mongoliensis. He also described the new genus and species Secernosaurus koerneri.\n* Brett-Surman was unable to determine where hadrosaurs first evolved.\n* Horner and Makela described the new genus and species Maiasaura peeblesorum. They argued that hadrosaurs cared for their young for an extended period after hatching.\n* Horner argued that hadrosaur fossils found in marine deposited were simply the preserved remains of individuals that had washed out to sea from a terrestrial place of origin.\n* Dong described the new genus and species Microhadrosaurus nanshiungensis.\n1980s\n1980\n*  Hotton argued that some hadrosaurs may have migrated seasonally in a north–south direction.\n]]\n]]\n1981\n* Teresa Maryańska and Osmolska described the new genus and species Barsboldia sicinskii.\n* Morris described the new species Lambeosaurus laticaudus.\n1982\n* Suslov and Shilin described the new genus and species Arstanosaurus akkurganensis.\n* Carpenter disputed the idea that hadrosaurs only nested in upland environments, instead arguing that fossil hadrosaur eggs and hatchlings were only absent from coastal deposits because the chemistry of the ancient soils were simply too acidic to preserve them.\n* Thulborn argued that hadrosaurs may have been able to run at speeds of up to 14–20&nbsp;km/h for sustained periods.\n1983\n* Horner observed that Maiasaura peeblesorum is only known to have lived in the upper regions of contemporary coastal plains.\n* Weishampel described hadrosaur chewing and cranial kinetics.\n* Weishampel and Weishampel reported the presence of hadrosaur remains on the Antarctic Peninsula.\nskull]]\n]]\n1984\n* Wu described the new genus and species Jaxartosaurus fuyuensis.\n* Milner and Norman argued that hadrosaurs evolved in Asia.\n* Horner observed that fossil eggs and hadrosaur hatchlings were common in sediments deposited in the upper regions of what were once coastal plains.\n* Weishampel described hadrosaur chewing and cranial kinetics.\n* Norman described hadrosaur chewing and cranial kinetics.\n* Weishampel argued that hadrosaurs fed mainly on vegetation of 2&nbsp;m in height or less but had a maximum browsing height of 4&nbsp;m.\n* Bonaparte and others described the new species Kritosaurus australis.\n1985\n* Norman and Weishampel described hadrosaur chewing and cranial kinetics.\n1987\n* Horner observed that fossil eggs and hadrosaur hatchlings were common in sediments deposited in the upper regions of what were once coastal plains.\n*Farlow argued that their highly developed chewing abilities and large gut volumes meant hadrosaurs werehighly adapted to feeding on nutrient poor, fibrous vegetation.\n1988\n* Horner described the new species Brachylophosaurus goodwini.\n1990s\n1990\n* Brett-Surman described the new genus Anatotitan for Anatosaurus copei.\n* Horner argued that the hadrosaurids were not a natural group, and instead that the two major groups of hadrosaurs, the generally uncrested hadrosaurines and the crested lambeosaurs had separate origins within the Iguanodontia. Horner thought that the uncrested hadrosaurs were descended from a relative of Iguanodon, while the crested lambeosaurs were descended from a relative of Ouranosaurus. However, this proposal would find no support in any subsequent research publication.\n* Weishampel and Horner found the Hadrosauridae to be a natural group after all. They also found cladistic support for the traditional division of Hadrosauridae into the subfamilies Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae.\n* Weishampel reported the presence of hadrosaurs on the Antarctic peninsula.\n1991\n* Bolotsky and Kurzanov described the new genus and species Amurosaurus riabinini.\n1992\nin the 1990s.]]\n* Horner described the new species Gryposaurus latidens. He also described the new species Prosaurolophus blackfeetensis.\n1993\n* Hunt and Lucas described the new genus and species Anasazisaurus horneri. They also described the new genus and species Naashoibitosaurus ostromi.\n* Weishampel, Norman, and Griogescu named the clade Euhadrosauria.\n* Weishampel and others proposed a node-based definition for the Hadrosauridae: the descendants of the most recent common ancestor shared by Telmatosaurus and Parasaurolophus''. They found the hadrosaurs to be a natural group, contrary to Horner's 1990 arguments that the hadrosaur subfamilies were descended from different kinds of iguanodont. They also found cladistic support for the traditional division of Hadrosauridae into the subfamilies Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae.\n* Clouse and Horner reported the presence of hadrosaur egg, embryo and hatchling fossils from the Judith River Formation of Montana. Since these sediments were deposited in a low-lying coastal plain, the researchers' discovery contradicted previous hypotheses that hadrosaurs either didn't nest in lowland areas or that local ancient soil was too acidic to preserve them.\n]]\n1994\n* Horner and Currie described the new species Hypacrosaurus stebingeri.\n1996\n* Chin and Gill described Maiasaura peeblesorum'' coprolites from an ancient nesting ground of that species. The coprolites were \"blocky\", irregularly-shaped masses that preserved plant fragments. The researchers identified it as feces because the masses contained fossilized dung beetle burrows. The plant material suggested a diet consisting mainly of conifer stems.\n1997\n* Forster found the hadrosaurs to be a natural group, contrary to Horner's 1990 arguments that the hadrosaur subfamilies were descended from different kinds of iguanodont. They also found cladistic support for the traditional division of Hadrosauridae into the subfamilies Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae. She preferred to define the Hadrosauridae as the most recent common ancestor of the hadrosaurines and lambeosaurines and all of its descendants. Unlike the definition used by Weishampel and others in 1993, this definition excluded Telmatosaurus.\n1999\n* Sereno found the hadrosaurs to be a natural group, contrary to Horner's 1990 arguments that the hadrosaur subfamilies were descended from different kinds of iguanodont.\n21st century\n2000s\n2000\n* Godefroit, Zan, and Jin described the new genus and species Charonosaurus jiayinensis.\n* Case and others reported the presence of hadrosaurs on the Antarctica peninsula. The remains studied were found on Vega Island and represent the southernmost known hadrosaur fossils. When the animals were still alive, this site was probably at a latitude of about 65 degrees South.\n* Horner and others studied the histology of Maiasaura peeblesorum bones. They found that Maiasaura only took 8–10 years to reach adult body size. A  adult Maiasaura could have an adult body mass of over  despite hatching at a length of about half a meter and with a body mass of less than a kilogram. This disparity implies a rate or growth similar to those found in modern mammals.\n]]\n2001\n* Horner and others published additional research on the histology of Maiasaura peeblesorum bones.\n2003\n* You and others described the new genus and species Equijubus normani.\n* Kobayashi and Azuma described the new genus and species Fukuisaurus tetoriensis.\n* Godefroit, Bolotsky, and Alifanov described the new genus and species Olorotitan arharensis.\n]]\n2004\n* Bolotsky and Godefroit described the new genus and species Kerberosaurus manakini.\n2005\n* Godefroit, Li, and Shang described the new genus and species Penelopognathus weishampeli.\n2006\n* Prieto-Márquez and others described the new genus and species Koutalisaurus kohlerorum.\n2007\n* Gilpin and others described the new genus and species Cedrorestes crichtoni.\nskull]]\n* Mo and others described the new genus and species Nanningosaurus dashiensis.\n* Zhao and others described the new genus and species Zhuchengosaurus maximus.\n2008\n* Godefroit and others described the new genus and species Sahaliyania elunchunorum and the new genus and species Wulagasaurus dongi.\n]]\n2009\n* Wagner and Lehman described the new genus and species Angulomastacator daviesi.\n* Pereda-Suberbiola and others described the new genus and species Arenysaurus ardevoli.\n* Sues and Averianov described the new genus and species Levnesovia transoxiana.\n* Dalla Vecchia described the new genus and species Tethyshadros insularis.\n2010s\n2010\n* Cruzado-Caballero and others described the new genus and species Blasisaurus canudoi.\n* Prieto-Márquez described the new genus and species Glishades ericksoni.\n* Juárez Valieri and others described the new genus and species Willinakaqe salitralensis.\n2011\n* Gates and others described the new genus and species Acristavus gagslarsoni.\n2012\n* Godefroit and others described the new genus and species Batyrosaurus rozhdestvenskyi.\n* Ramírez-Velasco and others described the new genus and species Huehuecanauhtlus tiquichensis.\n* Godefroit and others described the new genus and species Kundurosaurus nagornyi.\n* Coria, Riga and Casadío described the new genus and species Lapampasaurus cholinoi.\n* Prieto-Márquez and Brañas described the new genus and species Latirhinus uitstlani.\n* Prieto-Márquez Chiappe, and Joshi described the new genus and species Magnapaulia.\n2013\n* Prieto-Márquez and others described the new genus and species Canardia garonnensis.\n* Phil R.

(2021).\n2024\n* Dai and others described the new genus and species Qianjiangsaurus changshengi''.\nSee also\n* History of paleontology\n** Timeline of paleontology\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
