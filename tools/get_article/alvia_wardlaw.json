Wardlaw (born November 5, 1947) is an American art scholar, and one of the country's top experts on African-American art. She is curator and director of the University Museum at Texas Southern University, an institution central to the development of art by African Americans in Houston.

She was adjunct curator of African-American Art at the Dallas Museum of Art in 1994. Her exhibition ''The Quilts of Gee's Bend, a collection of quilts by outstanding quilters from Alabama, broke attendance records at major museums across the 11 cities to which it traveled and was one of the most talked-about museum shows of 2002 in America and beyond. She has presented exhibitions that added to the American art canon the work of major, previously undercelebrated African-American artists, in particular John Biggers, Thornton Dial and Kermit Oliver. Her own photographs were also shown across Texas.\nPersonal life\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, she grew up and lives in Third Ward, Houston, Texas.\nEducation\nWardlaw received a B.A. degree in Art History from Wellesley College in 1969.
