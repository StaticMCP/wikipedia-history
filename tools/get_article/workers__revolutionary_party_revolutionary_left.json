PRT–IR) was a Spanish Trotskyist political organization, formed in the summer of 2002 as a result of the merger of the Workers' Revolutionary Party (PRT) and the Revolutionary Left (IR). Organizing the struggle for socialism was the main goal of the formation. It was the official section in Spain of the International Workers' League - Fourth International (IWL).\nHistory\nIn the spring of 2004, the PRT–IR left the United Left (IU) coalition, accusing IU of supporting the government of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). Since then, the PRT-IR approached Corriente Roja, another split of IU.\nDissolution\nIn 2012 PRT-IR joined Corriente Roja.\nReferences"
