A carpenter by trade, he was only 17 years of age when he enlisted to serve as an infantryman in the First World War. He became a signaler in the Australian 1st Infantry Brigade.\nFirst World War\nMatthews took part in the first Anzac landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 at what is now known as Anzac Cove. Early in the landing, Matthews was hit in the chest by a shrapnel shard. A thick pocket-book—a present from his mother—saved his life.\nAfter the Gallipoli, Matthews went on to fight on the Western Front, where he took part in the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. On his 22nd birthday, the same day as the cessation of hostilities on 11 November 1918, he was on a ship in the Indian Ocean on his way home on \"ANZAC leave\".\nDeath\nMatthews died in his sleep on 9 December 1997 at the age of 101. At his death, he was the last living veteran of the Gallipoli landing.\nMatthews had been inducted to the Australian Living Treasures list in 1997. He made several public statements of the futility of wars. He regarded Anzac Day as \"not for old diggers to remember, it's for survivors to warn the young about the dangers of romanticising war.\"\nMatthews was given a state funeral in recognition of his war service and his special place in Australian history.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090914103610/http://www.warmemorialsnsw.asn.au/pdf/press_release_matthews.pdf Matthews' State Funeral] – Press Release announcing Matthews' State Funeral by then Premier of NSW, Bob Carr.\n* [http://www.mickjoffe.com/Ted_Matthews Interview with Ted Matthews]"
