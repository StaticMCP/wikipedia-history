Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\nIn 2012, the award was one of the new categories that resulted from the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards for that year. It combined the previous categories for Best Latin Pop Album and  Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. Other Latin categories were also either merged or discontinued.\nHowever, in June 2012 the Recording Academy announced that it would revert to the situation prior to 2012 by reinstating the separate Best Latin Pop Album and the  Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album categories. This meant the Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album category was discontinued after only one year.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Year\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Performing artist\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Work\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|2012\n| Maná\n| Drama y Luz\n|\n* Calle 13 — Entren Los Que Quieran\n* Gustavo Galindo — Entre La Ciudad y El Mar\n* La Vida Bohème — Nuestra\n* Los Amigos Invisibles — Not So Commercial\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album\n*Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.grammy.com Official website of the Grammy Awards]"
