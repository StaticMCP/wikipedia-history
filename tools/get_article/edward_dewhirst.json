His five children were also prominent in business and public life.\nEarly years\nEdward Dewhirst was born in 1815, the third son of Rev. Charles Dewhirst, Independent (as Congregationalists often styled themselves) minister of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England. He was educated there at King Edward VI Grammar School, having classics instruction from the headmaster John William Donaldson. In 1833 he was articled to a surgeon and started studying medicine, but in 1836 sailed for Jamaica in the West Indies where he worked for two or three years, and made the acquaintance of Rev. Matthew Henry Hodge. He suffered from a fever, and returned to England, where he studied to become a Nonconformist minister under John Pye-Smith at Homerton College, Cambridge.\nIn 1849 Dewhirst married Mary Ann, the eldest daughter of the Rev. Thomas Jarvis of Saint Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands.\nIn Australia\nHe emigrated to Victoria in 1853, where he worked as a Baptist minister, moving to South Australia in 1855 as a minister, first Baptist then Congregational at the Ebenezer Place church and filling in as Classics master at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution. His wife followed, arriving in the Libertas in 1857, accompanied by two sisters.\nHe received a licence to perform marriages in January 1857, but relinquished it in October 1858 when he joined the literary staff of The Register. One of his duties was writing for Farm and Garden, which must have suited him as he was a keen gardener. In August 1860 he was appointed second Inspector of Schools with the South Australian Education Department, where his kindly ways endeared him to both staff and students, although his philosophy of sound learning in a few subjects was at odds with the prevailing trend of less intense teaching over a broad range. When J. A. Hartley, who had similar ideas, was made Inspector-General of Schools he was promoted to Senior Inspector of Schools. In June 1891 he retired to the Adelaide Hills town of Nairne, where he was able to indulge his passions for literature, cricket and gardening, and became a valued member of the community, dying there in 1904.\nFamily life\nHis wife Mary Ann Dewhirst (7 November 1823 – 17 August 1913) was born in Saint Helier where they married. She followed him to Adelaide in 1857. She was for many years deaconess of the North Adelaide Baptist Church and taught at their women's Bible class.

He was educated at Adelaide Educational Institution and St Peter's College, went farming at Modbury, worked for the Public Stores Department and worked in Port Darwin for three years, returning in 1875. He had booked his return passage on the , but a delay in issuing his papers forced him to miss this ill-fated voyage, probably saving his life.  At the age of around 25 he joined the Adelaide branch of the National Bank, and by 1894 was manager of the Port Adelaide branch, retiring in 1914.  Edward was a fine baritone and was a choirmaster at Port Augusta Presbyterian Church; was a member and past president of the Port Adelaide Orpheus Society. He was for several years president of the Port Adelaide Institute. He was an enthusiastic yachtsman and raced the yacht Doris which he built in his backyard at Port Augusta.

In 1923 he was appointed Government member of the Municipal Tramways Trust. In 1928 he was awarded the Imperial Service Order. He was forced by ill-health to retire early and spent his last eight years an invalid.  In his youth he was a successful racing cyclist and an early member of the Royal South Australian Yacht Squadron. He owned, with his brother Thomas Youngman Dewhirst, the three-tonner Desire, one of the most successful small boats on the Port River.
