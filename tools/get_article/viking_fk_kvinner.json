Based in Stavanger, it plays in the Norwegian First Division, the second tier of women's football in Norway. Founded in 2011, the team first entered the league system ahead of the 2015 season.\nHistory\nViking played in the Norwegian women's top division from 1984 to 1986.\nThe current team was founded in 2011. In 2015, it entered the league system, participating in the Third Division, the fourth tier of Norwegian women's football. In the 2016 season, the team cooperated with neighbouring Hinna, whose first team was in the Second Division at the time. The cooperation lasted only for one season, before Viking restarted their operations.\nThe 2017 season resulted in a second place finish in the Third Division, two points behind Staal Jørpeland. In 2018, Viking finished first in their group and subsequently earned promotion to the Second Division. The following season, the team again won their group, which qualified them for the promotion play-offs to the First Division. Viking were eliminated in the play-offs, and were therefore not promoted. The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. In October 2020, Viking FK issued a statement to further focus on the women's team, in hope of reaching the Toppserien, the top division, as soon as possible. This meant that the team would be strengthened, gradually professionalized and that home matches would be played at Viking Stadion.\nIn May 2021, there were negotiations between Viking and Toppserien club Avaldsnes regarding a cooperation, which could have seen Viking take over Avaldsnes' spot in the Toppserien. The negotiations fell through in August 2021 due to financial issues. Viking finished the 2021 season in first place, which again qualified them for the promotion play-offs. In the final game of the play-offs, Viking won 2–1 against Odd, one goal short of promotion. In 2022, Viking finished second behind Fyllingsdalen, In 2023, Viking won promotion to the First Division.\nList of seasons\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! scope=col rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! scope=col colspan=\"10\"|League\n! scope=col rowspan=\"2\"|Cup\n! scope=col colspan=\"2\"|Other\n|-\n! scope=col |Division\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col |Competition\n! scope=col |Result\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2015\n|3. divisjon\n|align=\"right\"|3rd\n|20||11||2||7||53||31||+22||35\n|\n| ||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2016\n|colspan=\"11\"|Cooperation with Hinna\n| ||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2017\n|3. divisjon\n|align=\"right\"|2nd\n|22||17||3||2||94||28||+66||54\n|DNQ\n| ||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2018\n|3. divisjon\n|align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"#DDFFDD\"| 1st\n|22||21||0||1||127||12||+115||63\n|DNQ\n| ||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2019\n|2. divisjon\n|align=\"right\"|1st\n|22||18||2||2||80||26||+54||56\n|DNQ\n|Promotion play-offs||2nd (not promoted)\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2020\n|colspan=\"11\"|Season cancelled\n| ||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2021\n|2. divisjon\n|align=\"right\"|1st\n|11||10||1||0||40||9||+31||31\n|Second round\n|Promotion play-offs||2nd (not promoted)\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2022\n|2. divisjon\n|align=\"right\"|2nd\n|22||18||2||2||114||9||+105||56\n|Second round\n| ||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2023\n|2. divisjon\n|align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"#DDFFDD\"| 1st\n|26||23||2||1||83||11||+72||71\n|Second round\n| ||\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|2024\n|1. divisjon\n|align=\"right\"|4th\n|24||8||3||13||28||37||−9||27\n|Quarter-finals\n| ||\n|}\nCurrent squad\nTechnical staff\nChrister Corneliussen}}\nMagnus Meling}}\nJohnny Furdal Ellen Heggheim}}\nGeir Håkon Valland}}\nTarald Sørenes}}\nAnne Lise Olsen}}\nLiisa Maria Iversen}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.vikingfotball.no/ Official website]\n* [https://www.fotball.no/fotballdata/lag/hjem/?fiksId=169981 Profile] at the Norwegian Football Federation\n* [https://www.nifs.no/lagprofil.php?teamId=34701 Profile] at NIFS.no"
