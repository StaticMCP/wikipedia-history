Its primary role is protection of the President and other VIPs, as well as performing ceremonial functions. The force may also perform special combat functions.\nEstablishment\nThe predecessor of the Presidential Guard was the \"Presidential Security\", established in 1994 by then President of the Palestinian Authority (PA), Yasser Arafat and largely composed of members from Force 17.[http://www.miftah.org/Display.cfm?DocId=10400&CategoryId=21 The Palestinian Security Services: Past and Present]. MIFTAH, 30 May 2006.\"Presidential Security: What was Yasser Arafat’s former personal-security force  a highly trained group of some 3,000 officers, now guards Mahmoud Abbas. Most of these men were members of Force 17, an armed unit whose duties included guarding VIPs and securing important locations such the presidential compound in Ramallah.\"\nIn 2006, the Presidential Security was established as a separate force and renamed \"Presidential Guard\". The Presidential Guard was made up entirely of Fatah activists loyal to Abbas. The US was highly involved with the training of officers, coordinated by Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton. The training was part of a systematic effort to bolster Abbas and his Fatah loyalists to counter the political success of Hamas, who had won the 2006 legislative election and formed the new PA government. Hamas had formed its own security service within the Palestinian Authority, the Executive Force.\nAs of 2006, the estimated strength of the PPG was some 3,500 men, while a considerable increase was planned.\nGallery\nFile:President Donald Trump participates in arrival ceremonies with President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority at the Presidential Palace, Tuesday, May 23, 2017, in Bethlehem.
