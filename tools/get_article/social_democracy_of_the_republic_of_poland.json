The party was the main party of the successor parties to the Polish United Workers Party (PZPR).\nAmong the creators and leading figures of SdRP were the former Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski, former speaker of the Sejm Józef Oleksy and former Prime Minister Leszek Miller. The SdRP's name was a paraphrase of the late 19th century Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SdKPiL), a party which was the direct predecessor of the Communist Party of Poland.\nOn 15 April 1999, the SdRP was folded into the Democratic Left Alliance.\nElection results\nSejm\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Election year\n!Leader\n!# of\nvotes\n! % of\nvote\n!# of\noverall seats won\n!+/–\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1991\n|Aleksander Kwaśniewski\n|1,344,820\n|12.0 (#2)\n|\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 60 seats in total.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1993\n|Aleksander Kwaśniewski\n|2,815,169\n|20.4 (#1)\n|\n| 31\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 171 seats in total.\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1997\n|Leszek Miller\n|3,551,224\n|27.1 (#2)\n|\n|15\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |As part of the Democratic Left Alliance coalition, which won 164 seats in total.\n|}\nReferences"
