Prior to her election to the legislature, she served on the Hollywood Housing Authority as the Vice-Chair and as a Commissioner.\nFlorida House of Representatives\nWhen incumbent State Representative Eleanor Sobel was unable to seek re-election in 2006, Schwartz ran to succeed her in the 99th District, which stretched from Pembroke Pines to Hollywood in southern Broward County. She ran in the Democratic primary to succeed Sobel, winning 50% of the vote against Arthur Palamara and Barry Sacharow. In the general election, Schwartz defeated Republican nominee Juan Selaya in a landslide, receiving 75% of the vote to Selaya's 25%.

She won her party's nomination unopposed and faced Republican nominee Elizabeth Eddy in the general election. Schwartz was endorsed by the Sun-Sentinel, which praised her for being \"a voice for children, working families, and women's issues during her time in the Florida Legislature,\"  and the Miami Herald, which identified her support for expanding the Nursing Home Diversion Program, resulting in the opening of \"thousands of new slots\" for the disabled elderly to \"stay in their homes or assisted living facilities.\"  Ultimately, Schwartz was re-elected in a landslide to her final term in the legislature over Eddy, winning 66% of the vote.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/sections/representatives/details.aspx?MemberId=4383 Florida House of Representatives - Elaine Schwartz]"
