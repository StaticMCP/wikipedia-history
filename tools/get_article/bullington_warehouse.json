It was built in 1927, and is a three-story Romanesque-style brick structure divided into four units by projecting corbeled firewalls.  Each unit has approximately 10,000 square feet per floor, giving a total of about 123,000 square feet. It is an example of \"slow burn\" masonry and wood factory construction. It was the last in a series of brick tobacco storage warehouses, unique in their architectural style, begun in 1897 and ending with this warehouse in 1927.  The building has been converted to residential use.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\nReferences"
