This was the only film to win more than one category for 2009 although Precious garnered a Best Actress (Mo'Nique) honor as well as the Russell Smith Award from the critics association.\nAlong with the 11 \"best of\" category awards, the group also presented the Russell Smith Award to Precious as the \"best low-budget or cutting-edge independent film\" of the year. The award is named in honor of late Dallas Morning News film critic Russell Smith.\nWinners\nWinners are listed first and highlighted with boldface.
