It was Korea's first treaty with a western nation. After the United States assented to the Taft–Katsura agreement, the intervention clause was effectively nullified.\nBackground\nIn 1876, Korea established a trade treaty with Japan after Japanese ships approached Ganghwado and, following the Ganghwa Island incident, threatened to open fire on the Korean capital city. Treaty negotiations with the U.S. and with several European countries were made possible by the completion of this initial Japanese overture.\nNegotiations with Qing were a significant feature of the process which resulted in this treaty. The Chinese played a significant role in the treaty negotiation, although Korea was an independent country at the time, which was explicitly mentioned in the treaty.\nTreaty provisions\nThe United States and Korea negotiated and approved a 14 article treaty.  The treaty established mutual friendship and mutual assistance in case of attack; and the treaty also addressed such specific matters as extraterritorial rights for U.S. citizens in Korea and most favored nation trade status.\nAbstract\nThe treaty encompasses a range of subjects.\n*Article 1 provides:\n* Article 2 ... exchange of diplomatic and consular representatives\n* Article 3 ... United States vessels wrecked on coast of Korea\n* Article 4 ... United States extraterritorial jurisdiction over its citizens in Korea\n* Article 5 ... merchants and merchant vessels shall reciprocally pay duties\n* Article 6 ... reciprocal rights of residence and protection of citizens of both nations\n* Article 7 ... prohibiting export or import of opium\n* Article 8 ... export of \"breadstuffs\" and red ginseng\n* Article 9 ... regulating importation of arms and ammunition\n* Article 10 .. reciprocal rights to employing native labor\n* Article 11 .. students exchanges\n* Article 14 .. the usual most-favored-nation clause\nThe treaty remained in effect until the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905.\nAftermath\nJoseon sent a diplomatic mission to the U.S. in 1883, marking the first ever such official visit to North America by Koreans. The U.S. treaty established a template which was explicitly modeled in treaties with European nations &mdash; Germany in 1883, Russia and Italy in 1884, France in 1886, and others as well.\nThe treaty remained in effect even until the U.S. recognized 'Article 2' in the Treaty of Portsmouth of 1905, which eventually cleared the way for Japan's takeover of Korea in 1910.\nSee also\n* United States expedition to Korea\n* Korean Empire (1897)\n* Taft–Katsura agreement (1905)\n* Hague Secret Emissary Affair (1907)\n* Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905\n* Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910\nNotes\nReferences\n* Kang, Woong Joe.
