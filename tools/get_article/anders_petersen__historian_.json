Since rural deacons were often school teachers as well, this may partly explain why he later became a teacher.\nIn 1842 he was confirmed as first in his class.\nThe deacon who had employed his parents died in May the same year, two months later at the age of 14 Anders Petersen started as an apprentice as a weaver in nearby Slimminge.\nIn May 1845 Anders Petersen had completed his apprenticeship. During the following years he worked as a weaver in various nearby villages except for November 1846, where he lived in Copenhagen. In November 1849 he returned to his parents in Bjæverskov. Since his father was over 60 and working as a day labourer he may have moved back to support his parents.\nIn 1850 he volunteered for the army and soon became a non-commissioned officer in the artillery.\nThe following year his father died, six years later his mother died.\nFamily and Career Years\nIn 1852 he entered Jonstrup Seminarium on a stipend from Count Brockenhus Schack of Giesegaard to become a teacher and in 1855 he graduated.\nOn 12 June 1857 he married Olivia Anine Vilhemine Ømann in Garrison Church, Copenhagen.\nFrom 1857 to 1886 he was a school teacher in Vallø by.\nWhile living there he and his wife had four daughters, Petrine Marie Isabella Petersen (19 February 1858), Agnes Theodora Elna Petersen (22 April 1860), Olga Dagmar Nicoline Petersen (14 June 1862) and Thora Astrid Vilhelmine Petersen (19 September 1873).\nOn 25 June 1879 he was a  i.e. he had been awarded the Cross of Honour of the Order of the Dannebrog ().\nIn 1886 when his daughter Agnes married a teacher he was her best man as teacher and church singer.\nIn 1890 he had been awarded the silver medal of merit () and lived in Køge as a retired teacher with his wife and two unmarried daughters of whom the oldest (Petrine) was herself a teacher.\nIn 1891 he moved with his wife from Køge to Wesselsgade 13-2, Copenhagen as a retired teacher.\nIn 1901 two of his daughters had died.\nAfter he retired Anders Petersen remained an active author.\nAfter his Death\nAnders Petersen has a posthumous entry in the 1914 issue of Kraks Blå Bog as author and teacher.\nThe Danish National Archives has preserved some of his mail correspondence.\nIn 1991 a group of Danish historians led by J. Ingemann Pedersen raised the funds to reprint Anders Petersens book Sjællands Stifts Degnehistorie, which is very useful to genealogists but which had become very rare.\nBibliography (selected)\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
