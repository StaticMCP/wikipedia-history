The collection of five wrecks – one large, potentially three-masted ship; three barges; and an unidentified ship – are part of a ship graveyard.\nThe main wreck was discovered in January 2018 by journalist Ben Raines during an extreme low tide.  Believing the wreck to be that of the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States, an archaeological survey was performed on March 1–4, 2018.  The wreck was determined not to be the Clotilda, as it was longer (approximately  long, compared to the ''Clotilda's'' ) and constructed of pine rather than oak.  A later survey determined the ship to be constructed of Douglas fir, suggesting it was built on the Pacific coast and sailed around South America to Mobile.\nThe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2021.\nReferences"
