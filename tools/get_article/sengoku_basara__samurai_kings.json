The series started broadcast on Japan's Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting (CBC) station in April 2009; other networks broadcast the episodes within a few days, including TBS, MBS, and Animax. Its first season made its North American television debut on the Funimation Channel on November 16, 2010.\nThe series was followed by a second season directed by Kazuya Nomura, Sengoku Basara: Samurai Kings II, which began broadcast in July 2010; and a film, Sengoku Basara: The Last Party, which was released on June 4, 2011. A new television series titled Sengoku Basara: End of Judgement began airing on July 6, 2014. This series is based on the video game Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes and, unlike the previous series, is animated by Telecom Animation Film.\nPlot\nIn the Sengoku Period of feudal Japan, many generals fought in an endless struggle for national power and unification. One man proved to be too big of a threat: the \"Demon King of Owari\", Oda Nobunaga. Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura, two young warlords from different regions who become heated rivals, begin to form an unlikely alliance with the rest of the generals to take down the \"demon king\". The first series follows the emergence of the protagonists, particularly the main protagonists Masamune and Yukimura, and their struggle against Nobunaga, who seeks to conquer the land under him and is willing to crush anyone, even his own allies, to do it. It ends with his defeat at Masamune and Yukimura's hands.\nThe second series witnesses the emergence of Toyotomi Hideyoshi as the next potential unifier of the land, though, unlike in actual history, he has no connection to the Oda clan, whose retainers were almost entirely wiped out along with him by the end of the first season.\nThe film finale depicts Japan as being in turmoil once again as Ishida Mitsunari, former subordinate of Hideyoshi, cuts a wrath of fury across the land in order to fulfill his revenge while the other leaders rally for an era of peace. Masamune and Yukimura must fight Mitsunari in order to bring the country to peace as something strange is going on behind the scenes.\nMusic\nThe opening theme song of the first season is \"JAP\" by Abingdon Boys School and its ending theme song is \"Break & Peace\" by Dustz. The second season's opening theme song is \"Sword Summit\" by T.M. Revolution and its ending theme songs are \"El Dorado\" and \"Fate\" by Angelo. The opening song for the movie is \"FLAGS\" by T.M.
