The election was held in the midst of the First World War.\nThe election was won by the governing Conservatives, led by incumbent Premier John A. Mathieson, whose government lost a large number of seats as the opposition Liberals won back a number of districts lost in previous elections.\nThe Liberals in this election were able to climb up from one of their worst electoral defeats in 1912 to nearly topple the Mathieson government. However, it is unknown who the Liberal leader was during the election, if there was one at all. Previous Official Opposition Leader John Richards chose not to run in this election, while his successor John Howatt Bell was chosen as leader following the election. It is possible the Liberals did not have an official leader for this election.\nParty Standings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party Leader\n!colspan=\"2\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"2\"|Popular Vote\n|-\n!1912\n!Elected\n!#\n!%\n|\n|John A.

This was a holdover from when the Island had a bicameral legislature, the General Assembly and the Legislative Council.\nIn 1893, the Legislative Council was abolished and had its membership merged with the Assembly, though the two titles remained separate and were elected by different electoral franchises. Assembleymen were elected by all eligible voters of within a district, while Councillors were only elected by landowners within a district.\nKings\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
