It was here that the Pandavas along with Krishna are said to have prayed to Shiva and to have received his blessings for victory in the battle of Mahabharata. The ninth Guru, Shri Tegh Bahadur stayed at a spot near the Sthaneshwar Tirtha that is marked by a gurdwara just beside the temple.\nHistory\nThe temple is dedicated to Shiva, the presiding deity of the ancient city of Sthaneshwar presently known as Thanesar city or Kurukshetra city. Pushpabhuti, the founder of the Vardhana Empire of Thanesar named the capital of his kingdom after Sthaneshwar Shiva. The existing temple was constructed by Raghunath Rao Peshwa.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*http://Kurukshetra.nic.in\n* [http://www.thedivineindia.com/shri-sthaneshwara-temple/5899 Shri Sthaneshwara Temple]\n\n---\n\n## Sthaneshwar Mahadev temple\n\n#REDIRECT Sthaneshwar Mahadev Temple"
