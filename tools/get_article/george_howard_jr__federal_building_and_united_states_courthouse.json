It is a roughly square building, three stories in height, with a steel frame and curtain glass exterior.  Single-story brick sections project to the east and west of its main block, and the south side houses the building's service entrances.  It was completed in 1967, and is a prominent local example of Modern architecture.  It is also a significant local example of an urban renewal project; it was built in a swampy area previously occupied by \"substandard housing\".  It was named in honor of Pine Bluff native George Howard Jr. in 2008, and continues to house Pine Bluff's main post office as well as federal courts.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Jefferson County, Arkansas\nReferences"
