According to the disputed text Hwarang Segi, she was regent during the minority of her grandson King Jinpyeong in 579-584, but her regency is not mentioned in the historical texts Samguk sagi or Samguk yusa. She later became a Buddhist nun under the name Myobeop ().\nBiography\nEarly life\nShe was born to Park Yeong-sil and Princess Okjin of the Gyeongju Kim clan. She became the consort of the king early. The Hwarangsegi chronicle claimed that she married the king as early as the age of seven. During the last years of her husband's reign, he entered the temple of Yeongheungsa, and she followed him there.\nQueen mother\nIn 576 her spouse died, and was succeeded by their son. According to Hwarang Segi: It is said that he was dethroned by his mother, Queen Sado, for refusing to marry her niece (in some accounts, sister) Mishil. He made a promise to marry her and make her his Queen once he became a king but had a change of heart as soon as he took over the throne. He lost interest on her after falling deeply in love with another woman. They spread a rumor that heavens has forsaken Silla for having an immoral king, thus resulted for them losing their lands against the Baekje. They asked him to abdicate in order to appease the heaven. He was then sent to confinement and died 3 months later. His nephew who was only 10 years old at that time, was then announced as a new king but since he was still too young to rule, Queen Sado acted as his regent for years.\nRegency\nHer grandson was a minor, and she became regent during his minority. Since King Jinpyeong was only 13 years old when he ascended the throne in 579, Queen Dowager Sado, served as a regent until he reached the legal age in 584. However, Queen Sado still refused to give him full control of Silla even after he reached the legal age. She appointed Noribu, as the Sangdaedeung and Hujik as the head of the Military. Noribu died on December of 588, Sueulbu became the next Sangdaedeung after him. King Jinpyeong relied heavily on these two chief officials to solidify his kingdom in both internal affairs and international relations. He also gave the rank of Galmunwang to his brothers Baekban and Gukban, to solidify his power in the court.\nFamily\n* Father - Park Yeong-sil (), Lord Gioh ()\n* Mother - Princess Okjin of the Gyeongju Kim clan ()\n* Stepmother - Queen Dowager Jiso of the Gyeongju Kim clan (; ? – 574)\n** Step grandfather - King Beopheung of Silla (; ? – July 540)\n* Siblings\n** Older half-sister - Princess Hwanghwa ()\n** Older half-sister - Princess Songhwa ()\n** Older sister - Lady Myodo (); Mi Jin-hu’s first wife\n** Younger sister - Lady Heungdo ()\n* Husband - King Jinheung of Silla (; 534 – 576)\n* Children\n** Son - Crown Prince Dongryun (; ? – 572)\n*** Daughter-in-law - Lady Manho of the Gyeongju Kim clan ()\n**** Grandson - King Jinpyeong of Silla ()\n**** Grandson - Kim Baek-ban, King Galmun ()\n**** Grandson - Kim Guk-ban, King Galmun (; 572 – ?)\n*** Daughter-in-law - Lady Mi Shil (; 546/548 – 612)\n** Son - King Jinji of Silla (; ? – 24 August 579)\n** Son - Kim Gu-Ryun ()\n** Daughter - Princess Taeyang ()\n** Daughter - Princess Ayang ()\n** Daughter - Princess Eunryun ()\n** Daughter - Princess Wolryun ()\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Jeong Jae-Sun in the KBS TV series Dream of the Emperor\nReferences\n* Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K.
