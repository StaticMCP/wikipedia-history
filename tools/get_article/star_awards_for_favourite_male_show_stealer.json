It was given to an actor who portrayed a drama series or variety character that was deemed the most popular among the television audience.\nIt was first presented in 2010, discontinued in 2017, and then revived in 2022 and 2023.\nHistory\nThe Star Awards for Favourite Male Character category was introduced in 2010, at the 16th Star Awards ceremony; Nat Ho received the award for his role in The Dream Catchers.\nPrior to 2012, the nominees were determined by a team of judges employed by Mediacorp. The rule was removed in 2012 to allow the public to determine the nominees entirely via online voting. Winners are selected by a majority vote from the public.\nThe award was discontinued from 2017, along with the Favourite Female Character and Favourite Onscreen Couple (Drama) awards. In 2022, the award was revived but came under a new name called Favourite Male Show Stealer.\nSince its inception, the award was given to five actors. Richie Koh is the most recent winner in this category for his role in Your World In Mine. Elvin Ng and Xu Bin have won this category thrice with Xu receiving six nominations, more than any other actor. Aloysius Pang and Romeo Tan hold the record for the most nominations without a win, with four.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Actor\n! Role (title)\n!
