The new state was subsequently called Nanung, which came from the Dagbani words \"Naa\" (King or Chief) and \"Nua\" (Hand). Naa Sitobu is said to have pointed his hand south, and Naa Gmantambu and his followers went in the direction indicated by the hand. So \"Naa Nua\" (The King's hand) became Nanung.\nRoyal Houses\nThe 'Skin' () is the symbol of authority in Nanung (also called Naam), just as it is in most traditional states in Northern Ghana. Nanuŋ has two royal families that ascend to the Bimbilla Naam in an alternating arrangement. These royal families include Gbuhmayili () and Bangyili ().The princes and princesses from these two royal families are also primarily appointed as chiefs and queens in most towns and villages of Nanung.\nGeography\nNanung Kingdom stretches along the Eastern Corridor, covering districts including Nanumba North Municipality, Nanumba South, and major parts of Nkwanta North. Major towns in Nanung include Lepusi (), Bincheratanga, Bakpaba, Dimong, Pusiga, Bimbilla, Nakpayili, Wulensi (), Lungni, Chichahi, Chamba, Taali, Dokpam, Opijua, Nakpayili, Puduya, Binda, Kpassa, Oti-Damanko and Sibi.\nDemography, Ethnicity and Chieftancy\nNanung is a multi-ethnic kingdom, with Nanumbas, direct siblings and sworn brothers to both Dagombas and Mamprusi as the main ruling tribe. Nanumbas are also direct cousin to Mossi people () of the Mossi Kingdoms of Burkina Faso. Konkombas are the other major tribe of the Kingdom. Other minority tribes include Chambas, Chokosi, Tem (also known as the Temba or Kotokoli), Ewes, Bassaris, Nawuris, and a host of other smaller tribes.\nIn recent decades, the Nanumba Traditional Council, which Ghana's constitution recognizes as the paramount governing council of Nanung, has relaxed its strict rules regarding chieftaincy, which was previously reserved exclusively for Nanumbas. Now, individuals from minority tribes are appointed as chiefs under specific circumstances and with the approval of the Bimbilla Naa, who also serves as the president of the council. This change has contributed to improved harmony and peaceful coexistence within the kingdom.\nPast Rulers\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- align=left\n! width=\"10%\"|Position\n! width=\"28%\"|Incumbent\n! width=\"20%\"|Tenure (Month/Year)\n|- valign=top\n|colspan=\"3\"|Pre-colonial Kings\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|1st (founder)||Naa Gmantambu||\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|2nd||Naa Sulmwe||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|3rd||Naa Kumkayuɣiri||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|4th||Naa Gajiporiga||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|5th||Naa Napaprigu||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|6th||Naa Asa||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|7th||Naa Nakoŋ||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|8th||Naa Bingura||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|9th||Naa Nyelinbolgu||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|10th||Naa Mahmuru||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|11th||Naa Damba||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|12th||Naa Sulgu||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|13th||Naa Gbuɣma||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|14th||Naa Nmoro||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|15th||Naa Kurigu||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|16th||Naa Bang (Naa Baŋ)||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|17th||Naa Shero||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|18th||Naa Naatoham Kpema||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|19th||Naa Mahamaŋ Kalo||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|20th||Naa Dahamani||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|21st||Naa Yakubu (Saviɣu Suŋ)||--/---- to --/----\n|- valign=top\n|colspan=\"3\"|Kings under German colonial rule\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|22nd||Naa Abalsi (fought war against German invaders)||1881 to 1896\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|23rd||Naa Salifu Kurili (1st reign)||1896 to 1909\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|24th||Naa Aduna ŋunbaŋkum||1909 to 1917\n|- valign=top\n|colspan=\"3\"|Kings under British protectorate\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|25th||Naa Salifu Kurili (2st reign)||1917 to 1929\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|26th||Naa Ziblim Kuntimsa||1930 to 1945\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|27th||Naa Ablai (Kurugu-Kpaa)||1945 to 1957\n|- valign=top\n|28th||Naa Naatoham Bla||1944 to 1957\n|- valign=top\n|colspan=\"3\"|Kings during independent Ghana\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|29th||Naa Dasana (Gbuŋgbuŋ)||1959 to 1981\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|30th||Naa Abarika Atta (Gbani)||1982 to 09/1999\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|31st\n||Naa Andani Dasana||04/2003 to 06/2014\n|- valign=top bgcolor=\"#ffffec\"\n|}\nThe succession line in Nanung follows a patrilineal system. Consequently, all future Kings are considered direct descendants of Naa Gmantambu (the founding King) and, by extension, Naa Gbewaa.\nStruggle Against Colonialism\nIn late 1896, Nanung became the first traditional kingdom to engage the invading German colonial army in an open and direct war. The resistance was led by Naa Abalsi, the reigning king of Nanung. Under the command of Lieutenant Valentin von Massow, the German army reached Bimbilla on November 29, 1896, effectively occupying the kingdom. The occupation of Bimbilla was generally seen as a precursor to the Battle of Adibo against the Dagomba army.\nFestivals\nThe main festivals in Nanung Inludes Damba festival, Fire festival (), Eid al-Fitr (), Eid al-Adha (), and Guineafowl festival ().\nEconomy\nYam farming is the primary occupation of the people in Nanung. In addition to yams, maize, rice, and soybeans are also cultivated in the region. Together, these crops contribute to making Nanung one of the main breadbaskets of Ghana. The thriving agricultural sector has led to the development of significant markets in the area, including Bimbilla Market, Chemba Market, Kpassa Market, Nakpayili Market, and Bincheratanga.\nFamous Landmarks\nThe Oti and Daka rivers, international water bodies in West Africa, flow through much of Nanung. Towns such as Chihahi, Kukuo, Opijua, and Oti-Damanko are all situated along these rivers. The rivers' presence also supports other economic activities like fishing and ferrying.\nThe  Eastern Corridor Road, officially the National Highway 2 (N2), is a major national highway stretching from Accra to Northern Ghana. The road links the Kingdom to Nkwanta and Hohoe in the South, and Yendi and Tamale in the North. In Nanung, the road passes through the centre of major towns including Sibi, Kpassa, Oti-Damanko, Opijua, Bimbilla, Bincheratanga, Bakpaba, and Lepusi.\nNaa Gmantambu Palace, the royal palace of the Bimbilla Naa, located in Bimbilla, is a major symbol of culture and heritage. It hosts all major festivals. The Overlord also appears at the palace court every Friday to receive homage from subjects and sub-chiefs across the Kingdom.\nBimbilla Market, one of the largest grain and yam tuber markets in Northern Ghana, is located in Bimbilla. Smaller markets with similar agricultural produce are found in towns and villages throughout Nanung. The markets in Nanung serve more than just a trading purpose; they are also venues for entertainment. On market days, visitors can enjoy cultural drumming and dancing, along with a variety of local dishes and beverages. Market days typically occur on a rotational weekly schedule.\n[https://epcoebimbilla.edu.gh/ Bimbico], one of the oldest public teacher training universities in Ghana, is located in Bimbilla. It was established in 1962 by the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. It's now called E. P. College of Education, Bimbilla and runs four-year Bachelor of Education degree programs.\nNotable Sons and Daughters\n* Mohamed Ibn Chambas, politician and international diplomat, 1st President of the ECOWAS Commission\n* Nantogma Atta, MP and deputy minister under Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah\n* Dominic Nitiwul, Bimbilla MP and former defence minister of Ghana\n* Anas Aremeyaw Anas, renowned investigative journalist\n* Mugeez (fullname: Rashid Abdul Mugeez), award-winning singer and songwriter\n* Sheikh T.
