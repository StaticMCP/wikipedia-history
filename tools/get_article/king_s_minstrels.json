A charter was granted to the Brotherhood in 1469 which mentioned competition from rude countryfolk and workers at various crafts who have pretended to be musicians.  Only trained licensed musicians were to perform and every professional musician was required to belong to the guild.\nThe last recorded meeting was in 1677.\nReferences"
