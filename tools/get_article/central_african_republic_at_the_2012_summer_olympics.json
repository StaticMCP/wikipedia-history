This was the nation's ninth appearance at the Olympics, excluding three games after its national debut in 1968.\nComité National Olympique et Sportif Centrafricain sent the nation's largest delegation in its Olympic history, after the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. 6 athletes, an equal share between men and women, were selected to the team, competing only in athletics, taekwondo, swimming, and wrestling (the last two sports marked its Olympic debut in London). Sprinter Berenger Aymard Bosse, who advanced past the first round for the first time in the men's event, became the only athlete to compete at his second Olympics. Taekwondo jin David Boui, on the other hand, was appointed by the committee to be the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Central African Republic, however, has yet to win its first Olympic medal.\nAthletics\n;Key\n* Note–Ranks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only\n* Q = Qualified for the next round\n* q = Qualified for the next round as a fastest loser or, in field events, by position without achieving the qualifying target\n* NR = National record\n* N/A = Round not applicable for the event\n* Bye = Athlete not required to compete in round\n;Men\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Quarterfinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Berenger Aymard Bosse\n|align=left|100 m\n|10.55\n|1 Q\n|10.55\n|7\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\n;Women\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n!Result\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Elisabeth Mandaba\n|align=left|800 m\n|2:12.56\n|7\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\nSwimming\n;Men\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Event\n!colspan=\"2\"|Heat\n!colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal\n!colspan=\"2\"|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!Time\n!Rank\n!Time\n!Rank\n!Time\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Christian Nassif\n|align=left|50 m freestyle\n|28.04\n|55\n|colspan=4|Did not advance\n|}\nTaekwondo\nCentral African Republic has qualified 2 athletes.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!Round of 16\n!Quarterfinals\n!Semifinals\n!Repechage\n!Bronze Medal\n!colspan=2|Final\n|-style=\"font-size:95%\"\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|David Boui\n|align=left|Men's −68 kg\n|L 2–7\n|colspan=2|Did not advance\n|L 2–14\n|colspan=3|Did not advance\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Seulki Kang\n|align=left|Women's −49 kg\n|L 0–14\n|colspan=6|Did not advance\n|}\nWrestling\nCentral African Republic has received one wild card in wrestling.\nKey:\n*  - Victory by Fall.\n*  - Decision by Points - the loser with technical points.\n*  - Decision by Points - the loser without technical points.\n;Women's freestyle\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!rowspan=2|Athlete\n!rowspan=2|Event\n!Qualification\n!Round of 16\n!Quarterfinal\n!Semifinal\n!Repechage 1\n!Repechage 2\n!colspan=2|Final /\n|-style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!OppositionResult\n!Rank\n|-align=center\n|align=left|Sylvie Datty\n|align=left|−63 kg\n|\n|L 0–3\n|colspan=5|Did not advance\n|20\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
