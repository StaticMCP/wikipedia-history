The president was elected by 66 members of the House of Representatives in the administrative capital Garoowe and were the fifth election since the state's formation in 1998. Preceding the elections, a new Parliament Speaker and Deputy Speaker was held on 4 January 2024, by the 6th Parliament of Puntland. The pool of candidates comprises officials from the current Puntland administration, former government ministers, and notable local entrepreneurs.\nBackground\nThe elections followed deadly clashes triggered by proposed changes to the electoral system by current leader Said Abdullahi Deni. Deni had sought to implement direct elections for the presidency. However, in November 2023 the proposal was abandoned as armed opposition politicians and clan elders opposed it, underscoring the ongoing complexities surrounding democratic processes in Puntland.\nUN Special Representative Catriona Laing acknowledged the state's leaders for their notable efforts in engaging diverse groups. Laing urged President Deni to extend this outreach beyond opposition leaders, elders, and clan representatives, emphasizing the inclusion of youth, women, and scholars. The objective is to build consensus and ensure a peaceful electoral process during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, slated for February 2024, as proposed by the Puntland Electoral Commission (PEC).\nLaing commended Puntland for its successful implementation of one-person, one-vote elections in May 2023, applauding the region as an \"island of stability\" and a democratic trailblazer, particularly through its effective district-level elections. She reaffirmed the United Nations' dedication to collaborating with the Puntland government and its people, working towards the realization of peaceful and inclusive parliamentary and presidential elections that gain recognition from all stakeholders.\nFederal Government—Puntland relations\nCatriona Laing, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Somalia, visited Puntland. She discussed crucial issues with Puntland's leaders, political figures, and civil society representatives, covering topics like the state's ties with the Federal Government of Somalia.\nIn the Puntland election, candidates hold varying perspectives on federalism and the relationship with the Mogadishu government. Some advocate for defending Puntland's constitutional rights as a federal member state of Somalia, while others propose engagement in dialogues. the complex dynamics surrounding Puntland's position within the federal structure and its interactions with the central government in Mogadishu.\nSSC-Khatumo\nWith the crisis in Las Anod, UN Special Representative Catriona Laing highlighted the displacement of approximately 280,000 people due to the conflict that erupted in February. The unrest resulted in substantial loss of lives and the disruption of livelihoods for those affected.\nTraditional elders from SSC-Khatumo have expressed support for holding Puntland's presidential elections on 8 January 2024. Notably, Puntland faces sharp differences between the ruling party, led by President Said Abdullahi Deni, and the opposition, with contrasting preferences for the election dates—January or February. SSC traditional elders advocate for the 8 January date and emphasize the need for the Puntland Electoral Commission (PEC) to conduct parliamentary polls within 12 months of the presidential elections. They also call for voting through the one-person-one-vote system.\nThe political landscape is further influenced by the ongoing SSC-Khatumo saga, impacting discussions about their future relationship with Puntland, even after their recent departure. Representatives from Sool, Sanaag, and Ayn in the 6th Parliament of Puntland contribute to the ongoing dialogue about SSC-Khatumo's position within the region.\nOn 24 December 2023, Deputy Chairman of Puntland Supreme Court, Ahmed Sheikh Omar Hassan, from SSC-KHATUMO, issued a personal legal opinion on SSC's exit, stating it lacks required legal procedures. Recommends Puntland proceed with elections, consider postponement, and designates sitting SSC MPs as temporary representatives in Puntland parliament until a resolution is reached.\nCandidates\nThis election marked a significant milestone in the political landscape of Puntland, widely regarded as one of the most challenging contests since the establishment of Puntland. Candidates included:\n*Abshir Omar Huruse, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs who resigned to participate.\n*Abdiweli Ali Gaas, the preceding president.\n*Hassan Shire Abgal, a former Minister of Finance.\n*Ahmed Isse Awad, former Somali Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n*Gullied Salah Barre, former Puntland Minister of Environmental and Chairman of the Transitional Puntland Electoral Committee (TPEC)\nResults\nOn January 8, 2024, Said Abdullahi Deni, the incumbent President of Puntland, was re-elected following an election held in Garowe, the capital of Puntland. Deni emerged victorious in the third round of the election, securing 45 votes, while Guled Salah Barre, the remaining candidate, received 21 votes. Deni became the first president of Puntland to be re-elected, and he held office for another five-year term.\nReactions\nInternational community\n: UNSOM – Somalia's international partners commend the peaceful conclusion of Puntland's presidential election on 8 January 2024.
