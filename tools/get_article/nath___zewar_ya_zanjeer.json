Krishna discovers Sukant inherited the ancestral house from Mrs. Narayan. Gauri betrays Krishna, claiming she is Sukant's wife and orders her to leave. Jeet eventually falls in love with Krishna and realizes Gauri's evil, but shortly afterwards Krishna is shot, falls off a cliff, and is presumed dead. Gopal suffers a heart attack during her wedding, at the same time as Krishna's attack. Gopala loses her memory and is left with Krishna's emotions, falling in love with Jeet and following him to the Narayan residence, convinced that he is her husband. Jeet initially rejects her, still in mourning for Krishna, but after escaping from Gauri's traps with the help of Gopala, he decides to accept Gopala's love and take her as his wife.

But Krishna and Jeet meet again, as Shiv and Gopika meet and become friends, forcing Krishna have to face her past again. This approach leaves Gauri scared and obsessive, as she now fears losing not only her position as Jeet's wife, but also her son, since Shiv is in reality not her biological son but his adopted one, and possibly the son of Krishna herself.
