Alternatively, under II.D.1(c) a candidate need not file signatures with a $10,000 contribution. The District of Columbia Republican Party certified Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul in lieu of petitions under II.D.1(c). Rick Santorum was not included on the ballot because he did not meet these requirements.\nThe District of Columbia Republican Party decided not to allow write-in votes for the primary.\nThe District of Columbia's three superdelegates are Chairman Bob Kabel, Republican National Committeewoman Betsy Werronen, and Republican National Committeeman Tony Parker. Kabel and Werronen both support Mitt Romney.\nResults\nThe candidate with the most votes in the primary, Mitt Romney, was awarded sixteen delegates. Romney received the most votes in each of the District of Columbia's eight wards, receiving the majority of votes in wards 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, and a plurality of votes in wards 5, 7, and 8. Paul received the second most votes in wards 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8, while Gingrich received the second most votes in wards 3 and 7. Romney also received the most votes, or tied for the most votes, in 129 of the 143 voting precincts.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | 2012 District of Columbia Republican presidential primary\n|-\n! rowspan=\"1\" width=\"160px\"| Candidate\n! rowspan=\"1\" width=\"75px\"| Votes\n! rowspan=\"1\" width=\"75px\"| Percentage\n! rowspan=\"1\" width=\"75px\"| Delegates\n|- align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"pink\"\n| align=\"left\"|  Mitt Romney\n| 3,577\n| 70.08%\n| 18\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\"| Ron Paul\n| 621\n| 12.17%\n| 0\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\"| Newt Gingrich\n| 558\n| 10.93%\n| 0\n|- align=\"right\" bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\"\n| align=\"left\" | Jon Huntsman\n| 348\n| 6.82%\n| 0\n|- align=\"right\"\n| colspan=\"3\"| Unprojected delegates:\n| 1\n|- align=\"right\"\n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\"| Under votes\n| 153\n|\n|\n|-\n| Total:\n| 5,257\n| 100%\n| 19\n|}\n{|\n|Key:\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\" |Withdrew prior to contest\n|}\nReferences"
