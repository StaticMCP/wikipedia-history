They dream of another life with a future. On the peeling walls of their tenement, Rosie prominently places a painting of an exotic beach that gives them both hope and something tangible to cling to.\nIn order to achieve their goal of leaving Kingston for another life, Rocksy devises a risky plan with his friend Malt (Greggory Nelson), to steal and fence a sports car belonging to a local Lebanese businessman Faris (Paul Shoucair).\nWhen Rosie leaves, Rocksy struggles to manage without her, he becomes even more desperate and he does the unthinkable. Something within him has changed, but does the political environment in Jamaica allow for change?\nProduction and release\nKingston Paradise is the first feature by the well-noted Jamaican filmmaker Mary Wells who also produced the film. The film was produced by CaribbeanTalesFlix, along with sales representative California Pictures, who took the title to 2014's Cannes Film Market.\nKingston Paradise had a September 2013 premiere at Toronto's CaribbeanTales Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. The film also won the Festival Programmer's Award for Narrative Feature at the Pan African Film Festival in 2014; and Best Diaspora Film at the 2014 Africa Movie Academy Awards.\nSee also\n*List of Jamaican films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kingstonparadisemovie.com/ Official site]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/index.php?lh=8510993c4a7b3d1b9332c46147db79bb&#!/kingstonparadisemovie Facebook page]"
