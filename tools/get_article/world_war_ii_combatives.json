These techniques include hand-to-hand fighting, advanced firearm point shooting methods, and skills with various weapons, such as knives, bayonets, and improvised implements. These techniques were initially developed and taught to Allied special forces during World War II by prominent instructors, including Rex Applegate and William Ewart Fairbairn.\nHistorical Background\nThe origins of World War II combatives can be traced back to the policing tactics employed by law enforcement forces in the Shanghai International Settlement. This period saw the pioneering of concepts akin to modern-day SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) units. These specialized police units operated in Shanghai, which was widely regarded as one of the most dangerous port cities in the world during that era.\nWorld War II application\nWith the outbreak of World War II, veterans of the Shanghai Municipal Police played a crucial role in training various Allied military units. These units included renowned elite forces such as the British Commandos, the Special Air Service (SAS), and the Special Boat Service (SBS), as well as the US and Canadian 1st Special Service Force, commonly known as the \"Devil's Brigade.\" Additionally, these techniques were taught to intelligence personnel within organizations like the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which served as the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The British Special Operation Executive, Marine Raider Units, and the US Army Rangers were among the many other military groups that received training in World War II combatives.\nRelated concepts and techniques\nNotable combat systems and martial arts techniques related to World War II combatives include Defendu, Defendo, Kapap, Krav Maga, and Sambo. These martial disciplines share commonalities with World War II combatives, emphasizing practical and effective methods for self-defense and close-quarters combat.\nSee also\n# \"Get Tough\" by William Ewart Fairbairn: A seminal work by Fairbairn, this book explores various combative techniques and their application.\n# \"Kill or Get Killed\" by Rex Applegate: Rex Applegate's comprehensive guide to close-quarters combat techniques and self-defense.\n# \"Cold Steel\" by John Styers: This book provides insights into combat with various edged weapons, such as knives and bayonets.\n# \"Do or Die: A Supplementary Manual on Individual Combat\" by Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr.: A.J.
