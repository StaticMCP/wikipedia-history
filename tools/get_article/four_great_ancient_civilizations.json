The concept is popularly used in Japan and China—for example in history textbooks—but not generally known in the western world.\nOrigin\nThe origins of the phrase are unclear. According to one theory, it originated with Japanese archaeologist ; his colleague Masaaki Sugiyama recalled that Egami used to say that he coined the phrase. The first known occurrence of the phrase \"four great civilizations\" can be traced to a textbook titled , published by in 1952 by the Yamakawa Publishing Company, where Egami worked.\nAnother theory is that the term originates with Liang Qichao, a Chinese intellectual that lived during the late Qing dynasty. Specifically, in his 1900 poem  (), he wrote \"there are four motherlands of ancient civilizations on earth: China, India, Egypt, and Asia Minor\" (). This view of civilization was also influenced by Japanese thinkers such as Fukuzawa Yukichi, Ukita Zautami and Kayahara Kazan, who in turn were influenced by the western concept of a cradle of civilization.\nLiang Qichao divided the history of the world into three ages: the river age, the sea age, and the ocean age. The Four Great Ancient Civilizations originated in the river age and all of them developed along rivers. Scholars believe that they were all built near rivers because there were fixed water sources that made it easier for agriculture and commerce to develop. Human beings are clearly inseparable from water, but some historians believe that at the beginning of Chinese civilization, it first occurred in the mountains and then expanded to river areas.\nThis four civilizations model is not universally used and has come under criticism from some Chinese historians in that the dates of the beginning of China's civilization does not place it in the first four.\nOverview\nHistory\nBetween 7000 and 5000 years ago, in the Northern Hemisphere, the Mesopotamia, Nile, Indus, and Ganges basins, as well as the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, successively produced the world's Four Great Ancient Civilizations. These four civilizations successively entered the Bronze Age from the Neolithic Age, and then entered the Iron Age. Much of the philosophy, science, literature, art and other aspects of knowledge that humans possess today can generally be traced back to the contributions of these ancient civilizations.\nAmong the social systems of the Four Great Ancient Civilizations, Egypt and Babylon adopted slavery, India implemented the caste system, and China adopted the feudal system and the well-field system before the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period. Each civilization had its own myths and legends. The state entities were born later. In ancient times, religious myths were used to strengthen monarchy. The ruler of Babylon Hammurabi claimed to be a descendant of the moon god Sin, the ancient Egyptian Pharaoh claimed to be the son of the sun god Ra, and the Chinese monarch claimed to be the Son of Heaven.\nThe Four Great Ancient Civilizations all have their own calendars, each year is divided into 12 months and has leap months. Each civilization created its own writing. Civilizations in the Indus, Yellow and Mesopotamia river basins all used pottery wheels to make pottery. Egypt and Mesopotamia both calculated pi earlier, and China discovered the Pythagorean theorem earlier (or its practical application), while India invented Indian numerals (Arabic numerals).\nSee also\n* Civilization state\n* Five thousand years of Chinese civilization\nReferences"
