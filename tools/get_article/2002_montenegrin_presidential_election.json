The elections were also overshadowed by the arrest of Deputy State Attorney Zoran Piperović for connections with human trafficking and forced prostitution.\nResults\nAlthough Dragan Hajduković was a member of the Greens of Montenegro, he ran as an independent.\nAftermath\nAlthough Filip Vujanović won the election with 86% of the vote, turnout was less than the required 50%, so the election was declared invalid. Fresh elections were held in February 2003, which were also invalidated, and then again in May when the turnout rule was abolished.\nReferences"
