On the first day of school, Su Zai-zai encounters the cool and aloof Zhang Lu-rang (Zhou Yiran), and falls in love with him at first sight.\nBehind Lu-rang's seemingly outstanding academic performance and privileged family background, he is a \"contradictory\" person - someone who appears to be quite confident on the outside, yet constantly doubts himself on the inside. Due to the presence of his genius younger brother Zhang Lu-li, Lu-rang is constantly compared to him by his mother. For over a decade, Lu-rang's life has been like living inside a thick shell. He is introverted and speaks little. He looks composed and polite, but keeps everyone at a distance.\nHowever, Lu-rang's life changes when he meets the bubbly and forward Zai-zai, and joins hands with old and new friends Gu Ran, Guan Fang, and Su Zai-zai's best friend, Jiang Jia. They help him understand the meaning of one's self and he slowly begins to understand how to plan his life. Lu-rang and Zai-zai work towards their goals while supporting one another, as romance begins to blossom throughout their friend group.\nCast\nMain\n* Zhou Yi Ran (周翊然) as Zhang Lu Rang (张陆让)\n: A cool and aloof high school student who transferred from Suyang No.1 High School.
