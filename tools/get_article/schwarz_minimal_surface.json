They were later named by Alan Schoen in his seminal report that described the gyroid and other triply periodic minimal surfaces.\nThe surfaces were generated using symmetry arguments: given a solution to Plateau's problem for a polygon, reflections of the surface across the boundary lines also produce valid minimal surfaces that can be continuously joined to the original solution. If a minimal surface meets a plane at right angles, then the mirror image in the plane can also be joined to the surface. Hence given a suitable initial polygon inscribed in a unit cell periodic surfaces can be constructed.\nThe Schwarz surfaces have topological genus 3, the minimal genus of triply periodic minimal surfaces.\nThey have been considered as models for periodic nanostructures in block copolymers, electrostatic equipotential surfaces in crystals, and hypothetical negatively curved graphite phases.\nSchwarz P (\"Primitive\")\nSchoen named this surface 'primitive' because it has two intertwined congruent labyrinths, each with the shape of an inflated tubular version of the simple cubic lattice. While the standard P surface has cubic symmetry the unit cell can be any rectangular box, producing a family of minimal surfaces with the same topology.\nIt can be approximated by the implicit surface\n: \\cos(x) + \\cos(y) + \\cos(z) = 0 \\ .\nThe P surface has been considered for prototyping tissue scaffolds with a high surface-to-volume ratio and porosity.\nSchwarz D (\"Diamond\")\nSchoen named this surface 'diamond' because it has two intertwined congruent labyrinths, each having the shape of an inflated tubular version of the diamond bond structure. It is sometimes called the F surface in the literature.\nIt can be approximated by the implicit surface\n: \\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\cos(z) - \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(z) = 0\\ .\nSome sources give the alternate implicit surface\n: \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(z) + \\sin(x)\\cos(y)\\cos(z) + \\cos(x)\\sin(y)\\cos(z) + \\cos(x)\\cos(y)\\sin(z) = 0\nwhich is equivalent up to a translation in all coordinates by \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\nAn exact expression exists in terms of elliptic integrals, based on the Weierstrass representation.\nSchwarz H (\"Hexagonal\")\nThe H surface is similar to a catenoid with a triangular boundary, allowing it to tile space.\nSchwarz CLP (\"Crossed layers of parallels\")\nIllustrations\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20010627215357/http://www.susqu.edu/brakke/evolver/examples/periodic/periodic.html Susquehanna University - Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces (Archived)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090614123646/http://www.indiana.edu/~minimal/archive/Triply/genus3.html Indiana University - Triply Periodic Surfaces of Genus 3 (Archived)]\n* [http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~biophys/index.php?lang=e&n1=research_tpms Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg - Bicontinuous cubic phases based on triply periodic minimal surfaces]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160225062057/http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~morahman/gallery/schwartz.html Université libre de Bruxelles - Schwartz's Surface (Archived)]\n* [http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/gallery_m.html Virtual Math Museum - 3DXM Minimal Surface Gallery]\nSee also\n* Gyroid\n* Lidinoid\n* Triply periodic minimal surface\nReferences"
