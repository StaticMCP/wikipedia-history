It runs from the western port of Banana though the cities of Kinshasa, Kananga, Mbuji-Mayi, Lubumbashi, and ends at Kasumbalesa in the southeast of the country where it connects with the T3 road in Zambia.

According to banking data made public by the  leaks, some of the toll revenue was redirected to the relatives and entourage of then president Joseph Kabila.\nIn 2019, the African Development Bank provided a XUA 50,570,000 loan to rehabilitate the section between Kinshasa and Batshamba, which was completed in 2021. In 2022, the ADB approved another $250 million for the section between Mbuji-Mayi and Kananga.\nSee also\n* National Road 2 (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\nReferences"
