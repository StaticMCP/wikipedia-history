In the , Hervey Range had a population of 295 people.\nGeography\nAs the name suggests, the locality includes the Hervey mountain range. The split between the two local government areas roughly follows the ridge line with the Townsville City Council responsible for the coastal (eastern) side of the locality and Charters Towers Regional Council responsible for the inland (western) side of the locality. Apart from the ridge itself, the land on the Townsville side is generally much lower (50–100 metres above sea level) compared with the higher land on the Charters Towers side (550–600 metres about sea level).\nThe now-closed Greenvale railway line passes through the locality with three tunnels and the now-abandoned Kadara railway station ().\nThe Hervey Range Developmental Road enters the locality from the north-east (Black River) and exits to the west (Dotswood).\nPart of the east of the locality is within the Pinnacles National Park which extends into neighbouring Granite Vale to the south-east.\nThe land in the north of the locality is mostly used for grazing on native vegetation, while the southern part of the locality is mostly unused land.\nHistory\nThe mountain range and the locality were both named in 1861 by Phillip Somers after Matthew Hervey of Dotswood pastoral station. Somers and Hervey were co-owners of Dotswood station and Somers was also a member of Allan Cunningham's expedition. Barringha is the local Aboriginal name for the Hervey Range which is also their name for the Western Silver Wattle.\nOn 14 May 2022, Australian international cricketer Andrew Symonds died in the locality following a single-vehicle road accident on Hervey Range Road, near the Alice River Bridge.\nDemographics\nIn the , Hervey Range had a population of 279 people.\nIn the , Hervey Range had a population of 295 people.\nHeritage listings\nHervey Range has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Eureka Hotel, Hervey Range Road[38]\n* Range Hotel site, Page Road (old Hervey Range Road)\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Hervey Range. The nearest government primary school is The Willows State School in Kirwan to the north-east.
