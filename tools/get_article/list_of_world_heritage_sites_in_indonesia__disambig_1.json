The convention established that cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Meanwhile, natural heritage consists of physical and biological formations, geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened flora and fauna), and natural sites with scientific, conservation, or aesthetic merits.\nThe Republic of Indonesia ratified the convention on 6 June 1989, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. , there are ten World Heritage Sites in Indonesia, six of which are cultural and four are natural. This means Indonesia possesses the highest number of sites in Southeast Asia. The first four sites to be inscribed to the list were the Borobudur Temple Compounds, the Prambanan Temple Compounds, Ujung Kulon National Park, and Komodo National Park in 1991. The most recent addition to the list was the Cosmological Axis of Yogyakarta and its Historic Landmarks in 2023. In 2011, the Tropical Rainforest Heritage of Sumatra was inscribed to the list of World Heritage in Danger, due to threats posed by poaching, illegal logging, agricultural encroachment, and plans to build roads through the site. In addition, the government of Indonesia has nominated 21 sites on the tentative list, meaning that they intend to consider them for World Heritage Sites nomination in the future.\n__TOC__\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.
