The first battlecruisers, the , were championed by the British First Sea Lord John Fisher and appeared in 1908, two years after the revolutionary battleship . In the same year, Germany responded with its own battlecruiser, . Over the next decade, Britain and Germany built an additional twelve and six battlecruisers, respectively. Other nations joined them:  entered service for the Royal Australian Navy in 1913, Japan constructed four ships of the  from 1911 through 1915, and in late 1912 Russia laid down the four s, though they were never completed. Two countries considered acquiring battlecruisers in this time, but chose not to: France looked at several battlecruiser design studies in 1913 and 1914, and the United States ordered six s in 1916 that were never built.\nThe British and German battlecruisers were used extensively during World War&nbsp;I between 1914 and 1918, including in the Battles of Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank, and most famously in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916, where one German and three British battlecruisers were sunk. The Japanese battlecruisers did not see action during the war, as the German naval presence in the Pacific was destroyed by the British in the early months of the war. Britain and Germany attempted to build additional battlecruisers during the war—the  for the former, and the  and es for the latter—but changing priorities in favor of smaller warships prevented their completion. At the end of the war, the German High Seas Fleet was interned and subsequently scuttled in Scapa Flow.\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War&nbsp;I, Britain, Japan, and the United States all considered new battlecruiser construction, including the British G3 class, the Japanese , and a revised version of the American Lexingtons. In the interest of avoiding another crippling naval arms race, the three countries, along with France and Italy, signed the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, which included a moratorium on new capital ship construction. A clause in the treaty, however, gave the British, Japanese, and Americans a chance to convert several of their battlecruisers into aircraft carriers. Only a handful of battlecruisers survived the arms limitation regime. In the 1930s, several navies considered new \"cruiser killer\" battlecruisers, including Germany's , the Dutch Design 1047, and the Soviet . The outbreak of World War&nbsp;II in September 1939 put a halt to all these plans.\nDuring the war, the surviving battlecruisers saw extensive action, and many were sunk. The four Japanese Kongō-class ships had been rebuilt as fast battleships in the 1930s, but all were sunk during the conflict. Of the three British battlecruisers still in service,  and  were sunk, but  survived the war. The only other battlecruiser in existence at the end of the Second World War was the ex-German , which had been transferred to Turkey during the First World War and served as Yavuz Sultan Selim.\nSeveral new wartime classes were proposed, including the Japanese Design B-65 class, and the American , two of which were built before the end of the war. The Alaskas were officially classified as \"large cruisers\", but many naval historians refer to them as battlecruisers. In the postwar drawdown of forces, Renown and the two Alaskas were withdrawn from service and eventually scrapped; Only Yavuz Sultan Selim, the last surviving battlecruiser in the world, lingered on until the early 1970s, when she too was sent to the shipbreakers. Only one country, the Soviet Union, considered building battlecruisers after the war. The three  ships, championed by Joseph Stalin, were laid down in the early 1950s, but were cancelled after his death in 1953. However, in the 1970s, the Soviet Union began the construction of a class of very large guided missile cruisers, much larger than any other surface combatant built since the Second World War. This new type, the , although designated as a \"heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser\" by the Soviet Navy, was generally referred to in the West as a \"battlecruiser\".\nKey\nThe list of battlecruiser classes includes all battlecruisers listed in chronological order by commission. Classes which did not enter service are listed by the date of cancellation or last work on the project.s and s and the French s are all sometimes referred to as battlecruisers. Since neither their operators nor a significant number of naval historians did/do not classify them as such, they are not included in this list.|group=N}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| Main guns\n| The number and type of the main battery guns\n|-\n| Armor\n| The maximum thickness of the belt armor\n|-\n| Displacement\n| Ship displacement at full combat load\n|-\n| Propulsion\n| Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated\n|-\n| Service\n| The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate\n|-\n| Laid down\n| The date the keel began to be assembled\n|-\n| Commissioned\n| The date the ship was commissioned\n|}\nGreat Britain\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ship\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Main guns\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Armor\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Displacement\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Propulsion\n! colspan=\"3\" | Service\n|- valign=\"top\"\n!
