However, Docking was soon shifted by Cronulla to the  position where he would develop into one of the club's mainstays from the day he led Cronulla to a victory over three-time premiers Parramatta in his fourth appearance in first grade. Docking was alongside Gary Belcher and Garry Jack the best broken-field runner in the Winfield Cup for most of his career, with a highlight being his brilliant display against the Brisbane Broncos in a play-off for fifth in 1989.\nDocking was chosen to represent New South Wales in one match during each of the State of Origin series of 1987 and 1988. However, at the close of the 1991 season, Docking was told by the Sharks that his services were no longer required due to the club's financial problems, and although he was only 28, no other Winfield Cup club sought Docking's services for 1992.\nReferences"
