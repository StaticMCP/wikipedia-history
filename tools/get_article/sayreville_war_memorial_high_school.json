The athletic director resigned; the head coach was transferred to an elementary school; and the seven students remained suspended for the duration of the 2014–2015 school year.

According to junior varsity players, \"the same thing had been done to them by upperclassmen when they were freshmen. It's been going on for a long time.\"\nAdministration\nThe school's principal is Richard Gluchowski.
