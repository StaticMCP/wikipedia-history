It was taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. The  building is still in use for various other purposes in 2016.\nHistory\nCentury mill was built early in the 20th century, spinning 40's counts on ring frames for general-purpose work.\nThe cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914–1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets and the independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Century Mill, Farnworth was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. In 2016 it was still standing and in use for non-textile purposes. Century Mill was under demolition during 2023 and 2024 to make way for a new housing estate. By October 2024 the landmark chimney was the only part of the mill remaining, however this was finally demolished by November 2024.\nArchitecture\nPower\nThe mill had a 1500&nbsp;hp cross compound engine by Hick, Hargreaves & Co. Ltd. built in 1902 which operated at 190psi. The cylinders were  26\"HP, 54\"LP on a  stroke. The   flywheel drove 45 ropes at 59rpm.\nEquipment\n* Ring frames\nOwners\n*Lancashire Cotton Corporation (1930s–1964)\n*Courtaulds (1964–\nSee also\n*Textile manufacturing\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cottontown.org/ www.cottontown.org]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20021214103004/http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/ www.spinningtheweb.org.uk]\n*[http://www.boltonrevisited.org.uk/s-catherine-walton.html Story of a half-timer Catherine Walton who started at Century mill aged 12 in 1917]"
