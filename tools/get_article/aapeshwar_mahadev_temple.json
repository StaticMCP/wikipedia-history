It houses a life-sized Swayambhu murti of Shiva, discovered during tilling in Vikram Samvat 1318 (c. 1261 CE), when a ploughshare halted and an Akashvani directed locals to excavate the site.\nHistory\nLocal tradition relates that in Vikram Samvat 1318 a farmer’s ploughshare suddenly stopped at this site. Upon digging, villagers unearthed a natural, life-sized murti of Shiva; an Akashvani (divine voice) was heard instructing its consecration as Aapeshwar (“Lord who manifested Himself”). According to legend, the village’s name derives from Lord Rama’s exile sojourn here, originally called Ramasayana.\nLocation\nThe temple is situated at 25°00′18″ N 72°32′50″ E, on the eastern bank of the outflow channel from Vitan Dam toward Sikwara, amid low hills and riparian vegetation.\nArchitecture and features\nThe sanctum enshrines the uncarved, life-sized murti of Shiva set directly on bedrock with minimal intervention. Outside the shrine is a stepped kund (tank), whose water devotees compare to that of Dwarka.\nFestivals and rituals\n* Aapeshwar Mahadev Mela: A seven-day fair beginning on Mahashivaratri (February–March), featuring devotional singing and folk performances, first reported on 4 March 2019.\n* Rudrābhishek: Annual ritual bathing of the murti, marking its approx. 687-year heritage.\n* Mahashivaratri and Shravan Mondays: Devotees observe fasts, offer milk and Bel leaves, and participate in night-long vigils and aratis.\nAdministration and access\nThe Shri Apeshwar Mahadev Sewa Trust manages temple maintenance and visitor amenities, offering daily darshan from 06:00 to 20:00.  Road access is via the district road network from Jalore and Bhinmal. The nearest railway station is Marwar Bhinmal.\nReferences"
