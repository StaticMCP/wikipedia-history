AMAA officials didn't issue any statement on the rumours until December 2013 when the founder, Peace Anyiam Osigwe came out at a Lagos press briefing on 19 December 2013 and  stated \"you will hear from me on January 1\". It was later revealed that both South Africa and Malawi have been bidding to host the event, but Osigwe stated that it was turned down as it would be difficult to tell the Nigerian people that the 10th AMAA ceremony will be held outside Nigeria.\nLydia Forson and Kunle Afolayan was selected as the year's Face of AMAA. According to Osigwe, the two were chosen because they understand what AMAA stands for and its visions. As AMAA Ambassadors, they will be travelling around the world to carry out various activities for a period of one year.\nRenamed and discontinued categories\nTo mark the 10th edition of the award ceremony, some changes have been employed in the AMAA categories; Nelson Mandela Madiba Africa Vision Awards has been introduced to be received by any film that captures vision of the category. Best Film in African Language was renamed to Sembene Ousmane Awards for Best Film in African Language while the Best Short Film Award category is now called Efere Ozako Award for Best Short Film. This development is to immortalize some exceptional African great men who have contributed to the growth and development of the film industry. The category Best Film by African Living Abroad has been cancelled while a new category Best Director First Feature Film has been introduced to encourage young and upcoming film directors.\nPeople's Choice Awards\n''People's Choice Awards (PCA)'' system was announced in December 2013; This will allow the public to vote for their bests from past winners in all the categories. This is different from the regular jury-based categories and will be awarded separately. Voters will have opportunity to win prizes ranging from phones, iPads and a car. AMAA@10 has also made available a $10,000 reward for three Journalists who can give the best three reports on AMAA in the last nine years. the first prize gets $5,000, while the second  and third prize get $3,000 and $2,000 respectively. Winners would be determined through the depth and accuracy of the report, how well they understand the AMAA brand and the style of writing.\nSee also\n*List of Africa Movie Academy Awards ceremonies\nReferences"
