S. and Maude Phillips, he received his D.D.S. from Dalhousie University in 1952.\nCareer\nHe practised dentistry for many years.\nIn 1957, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada representing the riding of Prince. A member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) until 1962.\nIn 1963, he was appointed to the Senate, representing the senatorial division of Prince, Prince Edward Island. A Progressive Conservative, he was the last senator serving in the Senate who was appointed for life. A change in the law meant that senators could only serve until turning 75. All senators for life who had been appointed before the change were grandfathered in to allow them to serve beyond that, but many agreed to abide by the law and resign at 75. Phillips was the last remaining life senator and chose to resign from the Senate upon turning age 75 in 1999.\nPersonal life\nHe married Marguerite Woodside in 1945. They had four children: Brian, Betty, Robert and Patricia.\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
