      "text": "# Multi-Domain Warfare Officer\n\nMulti-Domain Warfare Officer was a qualification of the US Air Force beginning in June 2018.  Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. David L. Goldfein directed the creation of this specialty and more than 150 officers completed the course. In 2022, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. C.Q. Brown called for the specialty to be ended after only three years, while expanding the concept of multi-domain warfare to the entire officer corps, he said then, “To continue outpacing near-peer adversaries, we must reinforce all Air Force members’ multi-domain expertise.”\nBadge\nThe badge was originally to be issued in basic, senior and master, but since the career field only lasted for three years - it is likely that very few earned more than the basic badge as officers generally require seven years to earn the senior badge.\nReferences"
