The first two expeditions, led by Ja‘far Khan Ustājlu and then by Mansur Khan Shāhsevan, ended in catastrophic defeats, with Ustājlu either killed or captured and Mansur Khan decisively routed at Ghurian. The imperial army consisted largely of untrained levies, while the generals were noted for their lack of tactical and strategic competence. In reaction, the Safavid government appointed Fath ‘Ali Khan Turkman, Mīr Shikār-bāshī, as commander-in-chief and dispatched him with a newly assembled column. To pay his men, he controversially ordered ornaments from the Imam Reza Shrine in Mashhad to be melted down and struck into coinage during his arrival in September 1716.\nBattle\nFath ‘Ali Khan Turkman marched from Mashhad toward Herat and engaged Asadullah Khan near Kusuya. The Safavid forces initially gained ground and appeared to hold an advantage. However, due to his inexperience, Fath ‘Ali Khan pursued the Abdāli forces with only 1,000 men, separating himself from his main body. Recognising the mistake, Asadullah rallied his warriors and launched an aggressive counterattack, overwhelming the isolated detachment, killing Turkman and most of his accompanying troops. The remaining Safavid troops panicked, broke, and fled, abandoning their artillery and full baggage train on the field.\nReferences"
