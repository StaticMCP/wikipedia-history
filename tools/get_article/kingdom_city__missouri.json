It is part of the Jefferson City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 128 at the 2010 census. The village lies north of the intersection of Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 54.\nHistory\nKingdom City has its origins in the building of US Route 40 in 1925, at the same time US Route 54 was being planned with the intention of intersecting US 40 somewhere along the route. The city of Fulton had hoped for US 40 to go from Columbia through Fulton and intersect US 54 in their city, but the final decision had the highways intersect in what would become Kingdom City, which was then just a rural farm and forested area south of McCredie. McCredie residents fought so hard for the highway that they staged a parade through the heart of Fulton with banners that read \"54-40 or Fight\". When the road was being built and huge numbers of workers were brought in to do the work, McCredie became a boom town, with future Kingdom City receiving its first gas station and a two-story hotel, which (however) burned down in 1930.\nSince the area had no name at the time the intersection was referred to only as the \"Y\", with people in Fulton wanting to name it \"North Fulton\" and the people in McCredie naming it \"South McCredie\". The Kingdom Oil Company, owned by B.P. (Bernard Parker) Beamer, suggested Kingdom City, in reflection of the nickname for Callaway County. Through the 1920s and 30s numerous dance halls, restaurants, cafés, and hotels would come and go in Kingdom City. In 1965, Gasper's (which became a local landmark) opened for business. In 1970, the McCredie Post Office moved to Kingdom City and took the community's name. This was the same year Kingdom City incorporated as a village and included the former unincorporated community of McCredie.\nThe Richland Christian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.\nGeography\nKingdom City is located along U.S. Route 54 about a half-mile north of I-70. McKinney Creek flows past the south edge of the community and Auxvasse Creek passes two miles to the north. The town of Auxvasse lies about five miles north along Route 54. As of May 2024, the Route 54/I-70 intersection was to be upgraded, with roundabouts and a flyover, part of a larger project to expand I-70 in Missouri.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which  of it is land and  is water.\nDemographics\n}}\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 128 people, 49 households, and 34 families living in the village.
