She is the recipient of the 2022 Margaret Edwards Award for her \"significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\". She is also the only two-time recipient of the Michael L. Printz Award for Dig (2019) and as editor and contributor to The Collectors: Stories (2023).\nBiography\nKing was born March 10, 1970, in Reading, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Exeter Township Senior High School in 1988, earned a degree in photography at The Art Institute of Philadelphia, and then moved to Dublin, Ireland, where she began writing novels in 1994. After two years in Dublin, she relocated to Tipperary, where she renovated a farm and taught literacy to adults. She returned to Pennsylvania in 2004 and published her first novel, The Dust of 100 Dogs, in 2009, after fifteen years of writing.\nCareer\nWorks\nKing is the author of numerous young adult books that have earned her recognition as \"one of the best YA writers working today\" by The New York Times Book Review. Her work is known for bridging the gap between young adult and adult readers. She also writes acclaimed middle grade novels under her full name, Amy Sarig King. Her short fiction for adults has been widely published and nominated for Best New American Voices.\nTeaching, presentations, and philanthropy\nKing is a former faculty member of the Writing for Children and Young Adults Master of Fine Arts program at Vermont College of Fine Arts. An experienced teacher and presenter, King spends many months of the year traveling the U.S. for school visits, conferences, workshops, and literary festivals. King devotes much of her time and platform to mental health advocacy. In her presentations, she often centers topics such as life skills, emotions, bullying, self-esteem, safe relationships, and trauma.\nIn 2023, King and her son founded Gracie’s House, a nonprofit that provides safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth to express themselves artistically and to enjoy nature and camping. The organization is named for King’s late daughter.\nAwards and honors\nIn 2015, King was named the \"Outstanding Pennsylvania Author\" for that year by the Pennsylvania School Librarians Associations; all of her novels are set in the state. In 2022, she won the American Library Association's Margaret Edwards Award, which recognizes an author and \"a specific body of his or her work, for significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\". In 2024, King was awarded the YALSA's Michael L. Printz Award, for the anthology The Collectors: Stories — the first time an anthology has won the award and the first time an author has won the award twice.\nAwards and honors for individual books are listed below.\nThe Dust of 100 Dogs\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Awards for The Dust of 100 Dogs\n!Year\n!Award\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n|2009\n|Cybils Award for Young Adult Fantasy & Science Fiction\n|Finalist\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults\n|Selection\n|\n|}\nPlease Ignore Vera Dietz\nPlease Ignore Vera Dietz is a Junior Library Guild book.

The book was named one of the best young adult books of the year by Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly. Andrew Harwell of HarperCollins Children's Books also favorited Ask the Passengers for 2013, stating, To my mind, King falls in a camp with George Saunders as a writer who flouts conventions of genre and structure out of a sense that the world is full of meaning, but it is also totally crazy. King's books repeatedly stretch the boundaries of YA fiction, and are always grounded by their unflinching looks at real, imperfect families. So while I would be hard-pressed to say which of her books was my favorite read in 2013, it would definitely be one of them, and I think that says it all.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Awards for Ask the Passenger\n!Year\n!Award\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-\n|2012\n|Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Young Adult Novel\n|Winner\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults\n|Selection\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|ALA Rainbow Book List\n|Top 10\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Amelia Elizabeth Walden Award\n|Finalist\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Lambda Literary Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature\n|Finalist\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Carolyn W.
