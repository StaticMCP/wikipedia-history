Season 2 also saw the show net its highest ever Nielsen ranking at #15, and except for their broadcast of Super Bowl XXXI in 1997, it was the highest Nielsen rating for any Fox show up to that point, even beating The Simpsons at times.\nProduction\nThe showrunners for the season was Mike Judge and Greg Daniels. Wes Archer, the supervising director, did a redesign on most of the characters to make them appear more realistic than they did in the first season. In his 2003 DVD commentary for the episode \"How to Fire a Rifle Without Really Trying\", Daniels reflected, \"in season two, because of the way animation works, there was a big overlap. The episodes from season one were coming back and requiring producing and music and editing while we were writing season two. So, during the first season we had a very pure experience of just writing them without any distractions, and in the second season it suddenly got a lot harder because you'd be trying to write, and something would come in requiring attention.\" Daniels added that, \"this was part of the time I kept having a lot of car accidents, because we were so tired.\" Early in the production of the season, Pamela Adlon couldn't come in for table reads due to the birth of her first daughter.\nA July 1997 article from USA Today revealed that the upcoming season would include guest appearances from Troy Aikman, Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Chris Rock, Green Day and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The article also mentioned that the Hill family would make a guest cameo as in-universe characters on an upcoming episode of The Simpsons (the episode, titled \"Bart Star\", aired on Fox in November 1997). The crossover featured the voice of Mike Judge, with Daniels (an ex-Simpsons writer) explaining to USA Today that, \"In the world of King of the Hill, The Simpsons exists only in that Bobby has a Bart doll. They exist as a TV show.\"\nThe Christmas episode \"The Unbearable Blindness of Laying\" originated from an idea that was jotted down on an index card, which sat alongside dozens of other story ideas on a conference-room wall, until executive story editor Paul Lieberstein decided to take the story further. It featured a sex scene between Hank's mother and her new boyfriend, which Daniels viewed as risque. On the night before the episode's table read, the writers spent until 5 a.m. reworking the script of this episode, changing both the sex scene and the personality of the boyfriend character, as Daniels deemed him as too plain. Regarding the sex scene, Daniels remarked at the time, \"we [needed] to find a way to have adults know what's going on but have kids see something else.\"\nIn the episode \"Traffic Jam\", the comedian character guest voiced by Chris Rock was originally called \"Busta Nut\" in the script. The Fox Standards & Practices department objected, claiming that \"Bust a nut\" was slang for masturbation. His name was then changed to \"Booty Sack\" and finally \"Booda Sack.\"\nBroadcast history\nThe episodes originally aired Sundays at 8:30–9:00&nbsp;p.m. (EST) on the Fox Broadcasting Company.\nReception\nIn his September 1997 review of \"How to Fire a Rifle Without Really Trying\", Chris Vognar of the Orlando Sentinel wrote that. \"King of the Hill continues to hit the funny bone because it's more real and touching than any non-animated comedy on the air.\" He went on to write, \"the show looks to have more of an edge this year; one future episode finds Hank and Dale mistaking crack for fishing bait, and the humor in week one is already carrying a more subversive tone without losing its human touch.\" In his 2004 review of the DVD release, IGN's Tal Blevins gave the season a positive review, writing, \"while the characters were still coming into their own in season one, the second season is where the show really gelled, and the characters were molded into how we know them today.\"\nMike Judge said in a 2006 interview with IGN that \"Junkie Business\" was one of his favorite episodes of the series.\nEpisodes\n|ProdCode=5E01\n|Viewers=17.34\n|ShortSummary=When Bobby displays a talent for target shooting, Hank signs up for a father–son fun shoot competition—only to discover a buried childhood memory is still sadly affecting his aim.Guest stars: Angela Kinsey as Angela and Wallace Shawn as Philip Ny\n|LineColor=006735\n}}\n|ProdCode=5E02\n|Viewers=15.81\n|ShortSummary=Hank must save Peggy and Luanne from a tornado after he regrets not showing remorse for throwing Luanne out of the house and moving her back to the trailer that she moved out of after her mother tried to kill her father.\n|LineColor=006735\n}}\n|ProdCode=5E04\n|Viewers=13.58\n|ShortSummary=Peggy's excitement over finding Indian artifacts in the front yard distresses Hank when a condescending university professor tricks Peggy into letting him dig in the Hills' yard.Jonathan Joss takes over the role of John Redcorn from this episode onward.Guest star: Maurice LaMarche as Professor Lerner\n|LineColor=006735\n}}\n|ProdCode=5E06\n|Viewers=17.92\n|ShortSummary=Hank goes to war with a litigious Evangelical Christian woman (Sally Field) bent on banning Halloween and indoctrinating the kids by inviting them to a hell house, and Peggy gives Luanne a piece of her mind when a freshly-converted Luanne says Peggy does not have good morals and values.\n|LineColor=006735\n}}\n|ProdCode=5E03\n|Viewers=19.64\n|ShortSummary=Hank finds himself facing possible jail time after mistakenly buying crack cocaine to use as fish bait and the only way out is to prove that crack cocaine can be useful as fish bait.\n|LineColor=006735\n}}\n|ProdCode=5E05\n|Viewers=20.04\n|ShortSummary=Hank is determined to save his son from humiliation after Bobby becomes a model for a husky boy clothing line.\n|LineColor=006735\n}}\n|ProdCode=5E07\n|Viewers=21.56\n|ShortSummary=Hank, Boomhauer, Bill and Dale face off in a paintball war against the teenage members of a garage band (guest-voiced by the members of the pop-punk band Green Day).Guest stars: Tre Cool as Cane Skretteburg, Billie Joe Armstrong as Face and Mike Dirnt as Zeus.\n|LineColor=006735\n}}\n|ProdCode=5E08\n|Viewers=18.30\n|ShortSummary=Bobby, Connie and Joseph run away to \"The Caves\" (where \"half of Arlen's unplanned pregnancies begin,\" according to Peggy) after Bobby and Connie get in trouble at school for disrupting class.\n|LineColor=006735\n}}\n|ProdCode=4E12\n|Viewers=18.17\n|ShortSummary=When a new housing development is in need of a propane supplier, Buck instructs Hank to show the owner, an obnoxious Northerner who acts like a Southerner, a good time.
