Nine weeks later, with the release of the poll on February 8, the streak that began with the February 2, 2009 poll would end at 232.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|

Coaches Poll is the second-oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest number of points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first-place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\n|Week2Date =Dec 7 |Week3Date =Dec 14 |Week4Date = Dec 21|Week5Date = Dec 28|Week6Date = Jan 4\n|Week7Date = Jan 11\n|Week8Date = Jan 18\n|Week9Date =
