Her request to participate was rejected because the organisation that nominated her was an unregistered NGO. Its lack of legal status meant that it did not have the authority to make such a nomination.\nCampaign\nCampaigning started in October 2011. During the campaign many of the candidates running against the incumbent president expressed their support for him, thus giving rise to suspicions that his victory was more or less guaranteed. According to an expert from the Chatham House, \"the vote [was] a democratic sham\" and an example of \"faux democracy\".\nResults\nReferences"
