For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3. c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n3 & 4 Geo. 6\nContinuing the fifth session of the 37th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 28 November 1939 until 20 November 1940.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 3 & 4 G. 6.\nPublic general acts\n|note4= }}\n|\n|  and the Government of Burma Act, 1935, in certain respects, and to make a consequential amendment in the Naval Discipline Act; and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1918, and the Road Haulage Wages Act, 1938, and to make provision with respect to any of the matters to which the said provisions relate; and to make a consequential amendment of the Holidays with Pay Act, 1938.|note4= }}\n|  with regard to the duration of the detention of mental defectives in institutions or under guardianship.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n-\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  by reason of their being members of the Local Defence Volunteers.|note4= }}\n|  and release them from contractual obligations to issue bearer bonder or bond certificates.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  relating to the power to direct reconsideration of minimum rates of wages, the constitution of the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board, and the appointment of chairmen of agricultural wages committees.|note4= }}\n|\n-\n|  in its application to persons engaged in war service.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  to reduce or remit rates.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n| known in Canada as the Constitution Act, 1940|public|36|10-07-1940|repealed=n|maintained=y|An Act to include unemployment insurance among the classes of subjects enumerated in section ninety-one of the British North America Act, 1867. }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and 1919; to make provision regarding the powers of the King's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer; to enable effect to be given to International Conventions affecting Scottish Courts; and to amend the law of Scotland relating to criminal procedure.}}\n|  }}\n|  Part II of the First Schedule thereto, and section thirty-six of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1934, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  and for purposes connected therewith.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|  the Naval Discipline Act, the Army Act and the Air Force Act.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Dumbarton Burgh.|po1=Dumbarton Burgh Order 1939|po1year=y|Provisional Order to extend the boundaries of the burgh of Dumbarton to make provision with respect to the local government and health of the burgh and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Glasgow Water and Tramways.|note4=|po1=Glasgow Water and Tramways Order 1939|po1year=y|Provisional Order to authorise the corporation of the city of Glasgow to construct waterworks and tramways and to borrow money for their water and tramway undertakings and to confer further powers on the Corporation with respect to those undertakings and for other purposes.}}\n|  relating to Aberdeen Corporation (Administration, Finance, &c.).|po1=Aberdeen Corporation (Administration, Finance, &c.)
