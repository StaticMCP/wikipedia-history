They differed in having the modular control system incorporated into the electrical cabinet. Originally it was intended to continue their number sequence from the last 1550, i.e. the first would have been 1577, but this would have required the 1600 class to have been renumbered, so they were instead numbered as the 2400 class.\n2401 was repainted in Queensland Railways' Bicentennial \"Egg and Lettuce\" Livery in 1988.\nBetween 1999 and 2002, eighteen were rebuilt as 2300 class locomotives at Redbank Railway Workshops. The remaining six were withdrawn with one exported in August 2013 to South Africa.\nReferences\n'' consist through Yeronga station in 1987]]"
