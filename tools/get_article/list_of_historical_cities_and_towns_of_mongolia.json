It is bordered by Russia to the north and China to the south, east and west. Ulaanbaatar, the capital and largest city, is home to about 45% of the population.\nSpecial characteristics\n\"Mongolian cities\" means those cities that were built in Mongolia as well those built in areas directly under Mongol influence. The special characteristic of Mongolian historical cities is that they came into being amidst a predominantly nomadic society. It is a misunderstanding to assume that there were no cities in Mongolia, or that all of the people were entirely nomadic all through their history. Based on current research, Mongolia's tradition of cities goes back over 2000 years.\nHistorical towns and settlements\nPrehistoric settlements\n*       Tamsagbulag Neolithic Settlement, Khalkhgol sum, Dornod Province\n*       Norovlin Neolithic Settlement, Bulgan sum, Dornod Province\nXiongnu period (209 BC-AD 93)\n*\tLungtang\n*\tLungcheng (Mongolian: Luut; Dragon City), capital of the Xiongnu Empire, Orkhon River valley\n*       Lungzi\n*\tCity built by Zhaoxin in 120 BC as ordered by the Shanyu\n*\tKherlen Tsagaan Aral\n*\tTerelj Hasar Balgas\n*\tBayanbulag Balgas\n*\tTsenkher Gol Kherem\n*\tShuvuutiin Gol Kherem\nRouran period (AD 330 - 555)\n*\tMume, capital of the Rouran Khaganate, Orkhon River valley\n*\tLungcheng\nGöktürk and Uighur period (AD 555-840)\n*\tToba Khan's Ord\n*\tBilge Khan's Ord\n*\tKhar Els\n*\tKhar Balgas\n*\tBaibalyk\n*\tKharkhurem\nKhitan Liao period (AD 907-1125)\n*\tZuun kherem\n*\tBaruun kherem\n*\tBars khot\n*\tChin Tolgoin Balgas (Zhenzhou, built in AD 994)\n*\tKhar Bukhyn Balgas\nMongol Empire and Yuan period (AD 1206-1368)\n*\tKhaidu Khan's Ord\n*\tTenduk\n*\tTataryn Kherem\n*\tGenghis Khan's Four Ordos\n*\tKarakorum, capital of the Mongol Empire\n*\tSuurin\n*\tTosokh\n*\tShar Ord\n*\tKhokh nuuriin Ord\n*\tOngiin Ord\n*\tKhogshin Teeliin Balgas\n*\tTsagaan Balgas\n*\tArlyn Balgas\nNorthern Yuan period (AD 1368-1635)\n*Choir - 1691\n*\tTsagaan Baishin (or White Palace of Tsogt Taij)\n*\tIkh Khuree (now the capital city Ulaanbaatar) - 1639\n*\tKhovd (city) - In 1685 founded by Galdan Boshugtu Khan on the bank of the Khovd River.\n*Tsetserleg (city) - 1631.
