During the period 10&nbsp;– 12 July 1944, the officers and men of this organization displayed great courage, endurance and dogged determination in the attack through the dense Foret de Mont Castre, France.  The position known as the \"Mahlman Line\" was part of the main enemy defensive line.  It consisted of dug-in positions, cunningly camouflaged in the tangled underbrush and other devices that utilized to the fullest the natural defensive qualities of the area.  Despite repeated fierce enemy counterattacks, the Battalion relentlessly drove forward and eliminated a battalion of parachute infantry and a company of parachute engineers, both of which were part of the elite 5th German Parachute Division.  By the end of the first day the Battalion Commander and 11 of the 17 officers were casualties but the advance had progressed to within 75 yards of the initial objective.  The following day the remnants of the three rifle companies, one of which had 20 men, were reorganized into one composite company with a strength of 126 men and commanded by a lieutenant.  In a renewed charge the depleted Battalion overran the objective, killed 40 enemy, captured 8 machine guns, bazookas and mortars.  On 12 July 1944 as it left the forest the Battalion, retaining its aggressiveness, fought with exceptional daring and great skill and took successive objectives.  The Battalion's break through the enemy's main\nposition contributed materially to the Division's advance.  The inspiring leadership of its officers and the gallantry displayed by all ranks were in accordance with the highest military tradition.\nBy command of Major General ROOKS:\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|22nd Infantry Regiment\n|U.S. Army\n|1944\n|Operation Cobra\n|PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION OF THE 22D INFANTRY REGIMENT\nThe 22d Infantry Regiment is cited for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action in Normandy, France, during the period 26 July to 1 August 1944. The 22d Infantry Regiment was the infantry element of an armored-infantry combat command which successfully effected a breakthrough of the German line of resistance west of St. Lo, forming the St. Gillis-Marigny gap, through which armored-infantry columns surged deep into German held territory. Operating against hardened infantry, artillery and panzer units, this regiment, often riding its accompanying tanks, met and overcame the stiffest German resistance in desperate engagements at St. Gillis, Canisy, le Mesnil Herman, Villebaudon, Moyen, Percy, and Tessy-sur-Vire. The 22d Infantry Regiment, in its first action with an armored division, after a short period of indoctrination, assumed the role of armored infantry with unparalleled success. Throughout the swiftly moving, seven-day operation, the infantry teams kept pace with the tanks, only resting briefly at night to relentlessly press the attack at dawn. Rear echelons fought with enemy groups by-passed in the assault. There was little protection from the heavy artillery which the Germans brought to bear on the American armor. Enemy bombers continually harassed the American troops at night. But in an outstanding performance of duty the 22d Infantry Regiment perfected an infantry-tank team which by the power of its determined fighting spirit became an irresistible force on the battlefield.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| Company A, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, 3rd Armored Division, VII Corps, First Army\n|U.S. Army\n|1944\n|Siegfried Line\n|GENERAL ORDERS No. 24 WAR DEPARTMENT 6 April 1945\nAs authorized by Executive Order No. 9396 (sec.

On 10 December 1944, Company A was assigned as the only infantry company of a task force which launched an attack on Echtz. Aware of the superiority in number of enemy troops which were dug in and heavily fortified, the men and officers of Company A attacked vigorously, and, with great determination, routed the enemy from its defensive positions and secured the village prior to nightfall.\nOn 12 December 1944. Company A, as part of a reconnaissance force, joined with tanks to reconnoiter a small village on the Roer River. The sector assigned to Company A required an advance of 1,500 yards over flat and open terrain and under complete enemy observation from the east bank of the river. Though the company on its left was driven back in its attempt to cross the fire-swept field, the officers and men of Company A, ignoring heavy explosive shells, direct tank fire, and withering automatic-weapons fire and suffering heavy casualties, unhesitatingly advanced across the fire-swept field to reach the edge of the town.\nWith very few leaders remaining and its ranks thinned by casualties, Company A continued to push forward aggressively and successfully captured the village, clearing the approaches to the town in preparation for the advance of another rifle company. The heroic actions and esprit de corps displayed by the officers and men of Company A, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, though weakened by heavy casualties, are worthy of high praise.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| Company C, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, 3rd Armored Division, VII Corps, First Army\n|U.S. Army\n|1944\n|Siegfried Line\n|GENERAL ORDERS No. 24 WAR DEPARTMENT 6 April 1945\nAs authorized by Executive Order No. 9396 (sec.

When the force came within 600 yards of the village, only four tanks remained in operation because of heavily mined areas and difficult terrain. The men of Company C, without command from their leaders, passed through the tanks and vigorously assaulted enemy positions, thus permitting adjacent units to advance with a minimum of casualties. Despite the loss of all of its officers and 55 men, Company C plunged forward, and, by sheer determination and gallantry, successfully captured its objective.\nTwo days later Company C acted as a reserve force as two battalions of infantry made an attack upon the village of Hoven. Severe casualties were suffered by assaulting elements, and Company C, though weakened by the losses sustained in the previous fighting, was immediately committed to action. Company C moved rapidly across the flat and open terrain, and, in the face of murderous fire from a numerically superior enemy, succeeded in clearing the town of all resistance.\nThe individual courage, valor, and tenacity displayed by the personnel of Company C, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, in the face of superior odds, are in keeping with the highest traditions of the armed forces and are worthy of emulation.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 1st Battalion, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, 3rd Armored Division, VII Corps, First Army\n|U.S. Army\n|1944\n|Siegfried Line\n|GENERAL ORDERS No. 54 WAR DEPARTMENT 12 July 1945\nAs authorized by Executive Order 9396 (sec.

The 1st Battalion, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, on 12 September 1944 was assigned the mission of supporting an armored task force in its drive to smash the defenses of the Siegfried Line. Antitank-obstacles retarded the progress of armor, and the battalion was committed to overrun strongly fortified defensive positions overlooking the obstacles.\nIn 2 days of fierce fighting against a determined enemy the 1st Battalion, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, succeeded in overpowering enemy defenses and penetrating the first fortified belt of the West Wall. Over difficult terrain overlooking the second fortified belt this fighting force then attacked to force a bridgehead through the second belt of dragon's teeth. Vigorous hostile action was counterbalanced by an insuperable urge to close with and destroy the enemy wherever found.\nAgainst tremendous odds the battalion succeeded in establishing a bridgehead and for 3 days repulsed vigorous enemy counterattacks launched against it in an effort to break the battalion's foothold north of the dragon's teeth on critical terrain. On 18 September 1944, after infantry elements on the left and right failed to advance, the 1st Battalion was given the vital mission of withdrawing from its salient and attacking the strongly fortified town of Munsterbusch. Its fighting spirit undimmed, the 1st Battalion withdrew under pressure and launched the assault. The enemy poured deadly fire into its ranks inflicting severe losses on the attackers. The enemy fought savagely which often resulted in hand-to-hand combat. Despite enormous losses incurred in this offensive the 1st Battalion allowed the enemy no respite. Defending the town stubbornly the enemy employed tank, mortar, artillery, and automatic weapons fire and fanatically held their positions until either killed or overpowered by unrelenting pressure.\nDuring the period 12 to 22 September 1944 the 1st Battalion demonstrated extraordinary heroism and exhibited gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in overcoming unusually difficult and hazardous conditions.\nThe unconquerable spirit displayed by the 1st Battalion, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment in attack missions against important objectives made possible more deadly blows against the enemy on German soil.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| Medical Section, 3d Battalion, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, 3rd Armored Division, VII Corps, First Army\n|U.S. Army\n|1944\n|Siegfried Line\n|GENERAL ORDERS No. 54 WAR DEPARTMENT 12 July 1945\nAs authorized by Executive Order 9396 (sec.

Throughout this bitter engagement, the Medical Section, 3d Battalion, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, labored unceasingly despite devastating hostile artillery, mortar, and small-arms fire, administering medical aid and evacuating casualties. Although several members of the section were painfully wounded, they denied themselves treatment or rest until their patients had been cared for. On one occasion, when an adjacent battalion was forced back leaving the aid station unprotected, the members of the section continued their care for the wounded, realizing that to move the patients would have been, in many cases, fatal. Litter squads operated in the face. of intense fire between the aid station and advanced units, evacuating casualties. Aid men moved with foremost assault units, rendering immediate medical treatment to the wounded.\nThe unflinching courage and superb devotion to duty displayed by the members of the Medical Section, 3d Battalion, 36th Armored Infantry Regiment, resulted directly in the saving of many lives, exemplifying the highest traditions of the military service.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|Division and 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division\n|U.S. Army\n|1944\n|Normandy\n|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|Division and 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (less 2nd Battalion, 401st Glider Infantry Regiment) and with the following attached unit: 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment. ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1945||valign=\"top\"|Battle of Bastogne|| CITADEL OF BASTOGNE\nAs authorized by Executive Order 9396 (sec.

This masterful and grimly determined defense denied the enemy even momentary success in an operation for which he paid dearly in men, material, and eventually morale.\nThe outstanding courage and resourcefulness and undaunted determination of this gallant force is in keeping with the highest traditions of the service.\n[General Orders No. 17, War Department, 13 March 1945.]\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|Easy Company, 117th Regiment, 30th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army||1944|| Battle of Aachen ||\nGeneral Order 91, Headquarters 30th Infantry Division, Office of the Commanding General, 2 May 1945:\nCompany E, 117th Infantry Regiment, United States Army, is cited for outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy on 16 October 1944, in Germany.  Company E was given the mission of making a diversionary attack to weaken enemy pressure along a sector in which the main effort was to be made by another Regiment for the purpose of completing the encirclement of Aachen, Germany.  Enemy observation was excellent and the nature of the terrain made the attack extremely hazardous.  Enemy fire was exceptionally heavy and caused many casualties within the company.  Displaying unexcelled personal courage, the company launched five attacks against the numerically superior enemy and though control and direction were extremely difficult due to the unfavorable terrain and heavy enemy fire, their attacks succeeded in diverting much of the enemy's fire from the main effort, although at the cost of heavy casualties to the company.  The individual heroism exhibited in this engagement reflects great credit on each participant and is in keeping with the high traditions of the Military Service.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|3rd Infantry Division ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1945||valign=\"top\"|Colmar Pocket ||War Department General Orders Number 44, 6 June 1945:  As authorized by Executive Order 9396 (sec.

The citation reads as follows:\nThe 3rd Infantry Division with the following-attached units: 254 Infantry Regiment, 99th Chemical Battalion, 168th Chemical Smoke Generator Company, 441st Antiaircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion, 601st Tank Destroyer Battalion (SP), 756th Tank Battalion, IPW Team 183, and the 2831st Engineer (C) Battalion fighting incessantly, from 22 January-6 February 1945, in heavy snow storms, through enemy-infested marshes and woods, and over a flat plain crisscrossed by numerous small canals, irrigation ditches, and unfordable streams, terrain ideally suited to the defense, breached the German defense wall on the northern perimeter of the Colmar bridgehead and drove forward to isolate Colmar from the Rhine. Crossing the Fecht River from Guemar, Alsace, by stealth during the late hours of darkness of 22 January, the assault elements fought their way forward against mounting resistance. Reaching the Ill River, a bridge was thrown across but collapsed before armor could pass to the support of two battalions of the 80th Infantry on the far side. Isolated and attacked by a full German Panzer brigade, outnumbered and outgunned, these valiant troops were forced back yard by yard. Wave after wave of armor and infantry was hurled against them but despite hopeless odds the regiment held tenaciously to its bridgehead. Driving forward in knee-deep snow, which masked acres of densely sown mines, the 3d Infantry Division fought from house to house and street to street in the fortress towns of the Alsatian Plain. Under furious concentrations of supporting fire, assault troops crossed the Colmar Canal in rubber boats during the night of 29 January. Driving relentlessly forward, six towns were captured within eight hours, 500 casualties inflicted on the enemy during the day, and large quantities of booty seized. Slashing through to the Rhone-Rhine Canal, the garrison at Colmar was cut off and the fall of the city assured. Shifting the direction of attack, the division moved south between the Rhone-Rhine Canal and the Rhine toward Neuf Brisach and the Brisach Bridge. Synchronizing the attacks, the bridge was seized and Neuf Brisach captured by crossing the protecting moat and scaling the medieval walls by ladder. In one of the hardest fought and bloodiest campaigns of the war, the 3d Infantry Division annihilated three enemy divisions, partially destroyed three others, captured over 4,000 prisoners, and inflicted more than 7,500 casualties on the enemy.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|32nd Infantry Division\n|valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army\n|valign=\"top\"|1943\n|valign=\"top\"|Kokoda Track campaign, Battle of Buna-Gona\n|General Orders Number 21, War Department, 6 May 1943: \"When (a) bold and aggressive enemy invaded Papua in strength, the combined action of ground and air units of these forces, in association with Allied units, checked the hostile advance, drove the enemy back to the seacoast and in a series of actions against a highly organized defensive zone, utterly destroyed him. Ground combat forces, operating over roadless jungle-covered mountains and swamps, demonstrated their courage and resourcefulness in closing with an enemy who took every advantage of the nearly impassable terrain. Air forces, by repeatedly attacking the enemy ground forces and installations, by destroying his convoys attempting reinforcement and supply, and by transporting ground forces and supplies to areas for which land routes were non-existent and sea routes slow and hazardous, made possible the success of the ground operations. Service units, operating far forward of their normal positions and at times in advance of ground combat elements, built landing fields in the jungle, established and operated supply points, and provided for the hospitalization and evacuation of the wounded and sick.

Lyle Bouck,  members of the unit were finally decorated. Fourteen of the 18 members were present. Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh presented the recognition.  The Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, 394th Infantry Regiment, 99th Infantry Division, distinguished itself by extraordinary heroism, in action against enemy forces on 16 December 1944 near Lanzerath. Belgium. The German Ardennes Offensive that began the Battle of the Bulge was directed initially against a small sector defended by the Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon. Following a two-hour artillery barrage, enemy forces of at least battalion strength launched three separate frontal attacks against the small Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon of 18 men. Each attack was successfully repelled by the platoon. The platoon position was becoming untenable as casualties mounted and ammunition was nearly exhausted. Plans were made to break contact with the enemy and withdraw under cover of darkness. Before this could be accomplished, a fourth enemy attack finally overran the position and the platoon was captured at bayonet point. Although greatly outnumbered, through numerous feats of valor and an aggressive and deceptive defense of their position, the platoon inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy forces and successfully delayed for nearly 24 hours a major spearhead of the attacking German forces. Their valorous actions provided crucial time for the American forces to prepare to defend against the massive German offensive. The extraordinary gallantry, determination and esprit de corps of the Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon in close combat against a numerically superior enemy force are in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Army and reflect great credit upon the Unit and the Armed Forces of the United States.\n|-\n|26th Infantry Division\n|U.S. Army\n|1945\n|Ardennes-Alsace\n|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|Combat Command \"B\", 7th Armored Division ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1948||valign=\"top\"|St. Vith (Ardennes Campaign) ||Dept. of the Army GO No. 48, dated 12 July 1948: \"Combat Command B. 7th Armored Division, composed of the following units: Headquarters and Headquarters Company; 17th Tank Battalion; 31st Tank Battalion; 23d Armored Infantry Battalion; 38th Armored Infantry Battalion; 87th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron Mechanized (less Troop D); 275th Armored Field Artillery Battalion; 434th Armored Field Artillery Battalion; 965th Field Artillery Battalion; 81st Engineer Combat Battalion (106th Infantry Division); 168th Engineer Combat Battalion; 1st Platoon, Company F, 423d Infantry Regiment (amended from 3rd Platoon in Defense Department Permanent Order #032-01, dated 1 February 1999); Company B, 33d Armored Engineer Battalion; and Company A, 814th Tank Destroyer Battalion (SP), is cited for outstanding performance of duty in action from 17 to 23 December 1944, inclusive, at St. Vith, Belgium. Combat Command B, 7th Armored Division, was subjected to repeated tank and infantry attacks, which grew in intensity as the German forces attempted to destroy the stubborn defenses that were denying to them the use of the key communication center at St. Vith. By the second day, the flanks were constantly threatened by enemy forces that had bypassed the St. Vith area and pushed far to the rear in an effort to encircle the command east of the Salm River. The attacking forces were repeatedly thrown back by the gallant troops who rose from their fox holes and fought in fierce hand-to-hand combat to stop the penetrations and inflict heavy losses on the numerically superior foe. As the command continued to deny the important St. Vith highway and railroad center to the Germans, the entire offensive lost its initial impetus and their supply columns became immobilized. By 21 December, the German timetable was so disrupted that the enemy was forced to divert a corps to the capture of St. Vith. Under extreme pressure from overwhelming forces, this command, which for 6 days had held the St. Vith area so gallantly, was ordered to withdraw west of the Salm River. By their epic stand, without prepared defenses and despite heavy casualties, Combat Command B,. 7th Armored Division inflicted crippling losses and imposed great delay upon the enemy by a masterful and grimly determined defense in keeping with the highest traditions of the Army of the United States.\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division\n|valign=\"top\"| U.S. Army\n|valign=\"top\"| 1944\n|valign=\"top\"| Battle of the Bulge, Rochelinval, Belgium\n|valign=\"top\"| for \"exceptional heroism\" at the beginning of the American counteroffensive in the Ardennes, Belgium, noting the \"heroic attack and seizure of the critical, heavily fortified, regimental German position\" of Rochelinval on the Salm River.

On 3 January 1945, the 551st from the division's line of departure at Basse Bodeux attacked against great odds and secured the imposing ridge of Herispehe. The next day, January 8, Hitler ordered the German Army's first pullback from the Battle of the Bulge. In fighting a numerically superior foe with dominant high ground advantage, the 551st lost over four-fifths of its men, including the death of its inspirational commander, Lieutenant Colonel Wood Joerg, as he led the last attack. The battalion accounted for 400 German dead, and took over 300 prisoners. The 551st Parachute Infantry Battalion fought with a tenacity and fervor that was extraordinary. In what United States Army historian Charles MacDonald called \"the greatest battle ever fought by the United States Army,\" the 551st demonstrated the very best of the Army tradition of performance of duty in spite of great sacrifice and against all odds.\n(Awarded on February 23, 2001, by U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen.

During the entire action the personnel of Company A, 612th Tank Destroyer Battalion were employed in the role of infantry, one for which they were not trained nor to which assigned, fighting with the courage and spirit of infantrymen and being responsible for, the capture of many enemy personnel and enemy materiel as well as the killing of numerous Germans. Their outstanding courage, bravery and discipline exhibited to all that this was a superior fighting unit and was instrumental in resisting the northern arm of the German Pincer aimed for Eupen, Belgium through Monschau, Germany. Had the enemy offensive successfully overrun the positions of Company A 612th Tank Destroyer Battalion, the entire northern flank of the First United States Army would have been endangered, and the major supply depots in the vicinity of Eupen and Verviers threatened.\n|-\n|761st Tank Battalion ||U.S. Army||1978|| ETO, World War II || General Order Number 5\n|-\n|1st Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment||U.S. Army|||| Guadalcanal ||Army citation\n|-\n|146th Engineer (Combat) Battalion||U.S. Army||1944|| Operation Overlord ||Landed H+03 minutes, Omaha Beach, D-Day, June 6, 1944\n|-\n|695th Armored Field Artillery Battalion||U.S. Army||1945||||Invasion behind enemy lines and capture of the French city Metz.\n|-\n|34th Field Artillery||U.S. Army||1943||North Africa\n|-\n|51st Combat Engineer Battalion||U.S. Army||1945||Ardennes|| Defense of several key Belgian cities against Kampfgruppe Peiper between December 17–22, 1944.\n|-\n|1st Battalion, 307th Infantry Regiment of the 77th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army||1945|| Okinawa, le Shima ||\"For assaulting, capturing and securing The Escarpment, a heavily fortified coral rock fortress which was the key to the famed Japanese Shuri defensive position on Okinawa, during the period 30 April to 5 May 1945, and making possible a general advance by all elements of the command.\"\n|-\n|505th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division ||U.S. Army||1944||D-Day&nbsp;– Normandy || for action at Sainte-Mère-Église\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|First Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (less Company \"A\") of the 82nd Airborne Division ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1945||valign=\"top\"|Operation Market Garden&nbsp;– Cheneux, Belgium||\nHEADQUARTERS 82D AIRBORNE DIVISION Office of the Division Commander\nA.P.O. 469, U.S. Army,  23 March 1945\nGENERAL ORDERS UNIT CITATION NUMBER 43\nThe First Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry (less Company \"A\") has been cited by the Commanding General, First United States Army, for outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy. The citation is as follows:\nThe First Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry (less Company \"A\") is cited for outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy on 20–21 December 1944, at Cheneux, Belgium. This force was ordered to seize and occupy the town which is situated on hilly terrain and was defended by a heavily reinforced battalion of armored SS Troops supported by a Mark VI tank, numerous machine guns, SP 20&nbsp;mm guns, SP 77&nbsp;mm guns, and 105&nbsp;mm howitzers. The position was further defended in depth by armored halftracks mounting triple 20&nbsp;mm cannon and SP 81mm mortars. The battalion attacked Cheneux in echelons of assault waves and stormed the strongly emplaced enemy through the heavy fire of 20&nbsp;mm cannon, machine gun, mortar and small arms. The first three waves suffered severe losses as they charged across 400 yards of open fields fenced with barbed wire. Despite heavy losses, these airborne soldiers kept going with grim determination, each succeeding wave getting closer until the enemy and his armored vehicles and cannon were finally overwhelmed in fierce hand-to-hand combat. When ammunition ran low the troopers drove the enemy from almost impregnable positions with bayonets and clubbed rifles. The stubborn enemy was completely routed from his perimeter defenses and the attack continued until a portion of Cheneux was seized, where reorganization was effected and preparations made for a counter-attack. At dawn, the enemy laid down a heavy artillery preparation, then launched five successive counter-attacks through the day. All of these were repelled and at dusk this undaunted force continued the attack and drove the Germans from the town and nearby high ground. In this battle for CHENEUX, the First Battalion of the 504th Parachute Infantry (less Company \"A\"), destroyed five companies of German SS Armored troops and large quantities of artillery, vehicles and one Mark VI tank. They sealed a trap for thirty tanks and ninety-five vehicles which were eventually completely destroyed. This airborne force sustained heavy casualties in the engagement, but, despite these losses and the fanatical ferocity with which the enemy defended key positions, it prevailed in a most outstanding manner through superb discipline, skill and teamwork. The superior fortitude, unparalleled élan and individual feats of gallantry and high courage on the part of every man and officer reflect credit on the traditions of the airborne forces of the United States Army.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|Company \"A\", 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1945||valign=\"top\"|Co. A for crossing Rhine River at Hitdorf, Germany on 6 April 1945 ||\nCompany \"A\" 504th Parachute Infantry, is cited for outstanding performance of duty in the armed conflict against the enemy in Germany on 6–7 April 1945. This company crossed the Rhine River at 02–30 hours 6 April 1945, and seized the mile-long town of Hitdorf on the east shore with the mission of providing a base for further patrolling and to cause the German High Command to commit disproportionate forces against them in the belief that it was to be a major river crossing. The enemy immediately counter-attacked, but the assault groups were met with great vigor and virtually destroyed to a man. Apparently under the impression that a strong American bridgehead had been established overnight, the Germans assembled and directed a considerable portion of two divisions to the mission of containing and annihilating the formidable thrust. In mid-afternoon the entire area was subjected to a withering and devastating artillery barrage for two hours after which counter-attacking forces in overwhelming strength with tank support assaulted the defending troopers from every direction and penetrated to the heart of the town. The troopers of Company A doggedly stood their ground, fought at close quarters, and at point blank range and inflicted terrible casualties on the masses of the enemy. Fighting with relentless ferocity throughout the afternoon and night, this gallant company held its ground and carried out its mission until it was finally ordered to withdraw to the west bank of the Rhine on the night of 6–7 April. Fighting was bitter and at close quarters. The German armor committed was destroyed with hand weapons, most of the troopers using captured German panzerfausts. The company fought its way back step by step during the hours of darkness to their boats. The courageous and skillful efforts of the officers and men of this brave group, although outnumbered numerically at least eight to one, is reflected in the total number of casualties inflicted on the German forces during the day's fighting . Eighty prisoners were taken and evacuated and conservative estimates indicate that 150 of the enemy were killed and 250 wounded. The conduct of Company A reflects great credit on the Airborne Forces of the United States Army.\n|-\n|505th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division ||U.S. Army||1944|| Operation Market Garden&nbsp;– Groesbeek, the Netherlands||\n|-\n|96th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army||2001|| Okinawa ||The 96th Infantry Division and attached units distinguished themselves during the period 1 April 1945 to 30 June 1945, by extraordinary heroism and gallantry in action against the enemy in the conquest of Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, Japan. On 1 April 1945 the 96th Infantry Division made an assault landing on the Hagushi beaches of Okinawa and within three days overcame all resistance in the large Sunabe Hill mass which dominated the XXIV Corps' landing beaches. The division then immediately attacked rapidly and skillfully south down the western half of the island, overrunning and destroying or driving in enemy outpost lines and strong points guarding the approaches to the main defense hub at Shuri. By 7 April, the division had penetrated the main outer ring. On 9 April, the division initiated a series of attacks against the powerful Japanese defense position at Kakazu Ridge. It was necessary to dig, blast and burn or bury forever the fanatical enemy defenders. By 15 April, the division had gained control of dominant portions of the ridge. On 16 April, the division became an interior division when a third division entered the line on its right flank. It continued its day after day assaults. Tombstone Hill was seized. Tanabaru and Maeda escarpments were captured. Needle Rock Hill 153 and the Gate were all taken. On 1 May, the division was withdrawn for nine days of rest and for reception and assimilation of replacements totaling over 4,000. On 9 May, the division reentered the lines on the left (east) bank, and began a series of bitter, bloody, hand-to-hand assaults designed to wrest from the Japanese Conical Hill, the vital key to the eastern section of the Shuri battle position. The desperate defenders struck back with all the fire and manpower at their command. Concentrations of artillery and medium and heavy mortar fire were placed upon our lines in durations previously unknown in the Pacific War. By 21 May, the crest and eastern slopes of Conical Hill had been captured, opening an envelopment route to turn Shuri. To the west of Conical Hill, the division captured Sugar Hill and broke through the Shuri Line to within 200 yards of the Nahi-Shuri-Yonabaru Road, the enemy's innermost and essential communication line. Loss of Conical Hill doomed the Shuri position, and the enemy withdrew, shortly after its fall, to final positions along the south tip of the island. The division continued its pursuit of the retreating enemy. On the final enemy positions on the Yuza-Yaeju-Dake escarpments, the two highest hills were in the zone of the 96th Division. The division assaulted heroically and with a fury that could not be stopped, using the same hand-to-hand, digging, blasting burning assaults required in earlier engagements. The 96th Division ended its portion of the organized fighting as it began it, closing to bayonet range with a gallantry, heroism and determination to win which carried its attacks forward despite terrible and crippling casualties and physical discomforts almost beyond human endurance. The division killed a total of 37,763 of the enemy in 73 days of fighting. Its own battle losses totaled 7,294, including 1,504 killed. The brilliant victories achieved by the 96th Division on Okinawa contributed greatly to the defeat of the large enemy garrison. The esprit, heroism, and continued demonstrations of raw courage throughout the battle exemplified the highest traditions of the military service.\n|-\n|2nd Battalion and one platoon of Company A, 749th Tank Battalion and one platoon of Company A, 776th Tank Destroyer Battalion of the 44th Infantry Division (United States) ||U.S. Army||1945|| France ||Defensive action starting on December 31, 1944, against the German offensive Operation Nordwind in Rimling, France.\n|-\n|503rd Regimental Combat Team ||U.S. Army||1945|| Battle of Corregidor (1945) ||Liberation the island of Corregidor in Manila Bay, 16–26 February.\n|-\n|222nd Infantry Regiment ||U.S. Army||2001|| Alsace ||24 & 25 January 1945 withstood repeated attacks from three enemy divisions\n|-\n|Third Platoon, Company C of the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion ||U.S. Army||1945||Alsace||14 December 1944 Set up their guns in full view of the enemy, acting as a decoy so other units could attack and take the town of Climback, France\n|-\n|5307th Composite Unit (\"Merrill's Marauders\")||U.S. Army||1966[http://www.marauder.org/history.htm]|| northern Burma\n|-\n|601st Tank Destroyer Battalion||U.S. Army||1942|| Battle of El Guettar ||23 March 1942 broke up an attack by strong elements of the 10th Panzer Division, destroying 37 tanks and receiving the Presidential Unit Citation.

Going to the rescue of the \"lost battalion\", 141st Infantry Regiment, it fought without respite for 4 days against a fanatical enemy that was determined to keep the \"lost battalion\" isolated and force its surrender. On the fourth day, although exhausted and reduced through casualties to about half its normal strength, the battalion fought doggedly forward against strong enemy small-arms and mortar fire until it contacted the isolated unit.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|442 Regimental Combat Team ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1945||valign=\"top\"|Serravezza, Carrara, and Fosdinovo, Italy||valign=\"top\"|War Department General Orders 34, 10 April 1946, as amended by War Department General Orders 106, 20 September 1946: 5 to 14 April 1945&nbsp;– It accomplished the mission of creating a diversion along the Ligurian Coast, which served as a feint for the subsequent break-through of the Fifth Army forces into Bologna and the Po Valley.

On 28 October 1944, the 2d Battalion secured its objective in a 2-day operation, which eliminated a threat to the flanks of two American divisions. In the face of intense enemy barrages and numerous counterattacks, the infantrymen of this battalion fought their way through difficult jungle-like terrain in freezing weather and completely encircled the enemy. Maintaining its admirable record of achievement in the vicinity of Massa, Italy the 2nd Battalion smashed through and exploited the strong Green Line on the Ligurian Coast. Surging over formidable heights through strong resistance, the 2nd Battalion, in 5 days of continuous, heavy fighting, captured a series of objectives to pave the way for the entry into the important communications centers of Massa and Carrara, Italy, without opposition. In this operation, the 2nd Battalion accounted for more than 200 Germans and captured or destroyed large quantities of enemy material.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|3rd Battalion, 442 Regimental Combat Team ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1944||valign=\"top\"|Biffontaine, France||valign=\"top\"|War Department General Orders 68, 14 August 1945: 27 to 30 October 1944&nbsp;– One of the battalions of another unit which had been advancing deep into enemy territory beyond the town of Biffontaine was suddenly surrounded by the enemy, and separated from all friendly units by an enemy force estimated at 700 men. The mission of the 3rd Battalion was to attack abreast with the 100th Battalion and four other battalions and relieve the entrapped unit. Though seriously depleted in manpower, the battalion hurled back two determined enemy counterattacks, and after reducing a heavily mined roadblock finally established contact with the besieged battalion.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|Companies F and L, 442 Regimental Combat Team ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1944||valign=\"top\"|Belmont, France||valign=\"top\"|War Department General Orders 14, 4 March 1945: 21 October 1944&nbsp;– Companies F and L, 442nd Regimental Combat Team, designated the O'Connor Task Force, launched an attack down the north slope of the wooded ridge, Foret de Belmont. In destroying the enemy main line of resistance and advancing the divisional front lines by approximately 2,000 meters, the task force captured 56 prisoners, killed 80 of the enemy, and captured considerable quantifies of enemy material and equipment.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|232d Engineer Combat Company (then attached to the 111th Engineer Combat Battalion), 36th Infantry Division ||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1944||valign=\"top\"|Bruyeres, France||valign=\"top\"|War Department General Orders 56, 17 June 1946: 23 October to 11 November 1944&nbsp;– Even though the engineers sustained 57 casualties in dead and wounded, they captured 27 German prisoners and killed many more as they worked. Almost continuous rain and snow made their task more difficult, and yet by sheer determination and grit, these men accomplished this magnificent feat of engineering. Without this road, the division operation could not have succeeded and it is due to the extraordinary achievement of the 11th Engineer Combat Battalion with the 232d Engineer Combat Company (attached) that the 36th Division was able to outflank the enemy forces in the Laveline-Corcieux Valley and pursue a disorganized enemy to the banks of the Meurthe River.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|254th Engineer Combat Battalion||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army||valign=\"top\"|1945||valign=\"top\"|Battle of the Bulge ||valign=\"top\"|General Orders No. 32, War Department, Washington D.C., 23 April 1945: The 254th Engineer Combat Battalion is cited for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy on 17 December 1944 in Belgium. Early in the morning of 17 December 1944, the battalion was ordered to take up a defensive position on the corp's right flank. Although armed only with small arms, machine guns, and rocket launchers, and completely unsupported, the battalion successfully resisted several vicious attacks by armored infantry and tanks (German 2nd SS Panzer Div). When finally overrun physically by enemy tanks, the battalion continued its determined and heroic resistance from successive positions for a period of 9 hours before relief finally arrived (by elements of American 1st Inf Div that moved up from a rest area). This gallant and courageous action enabled successful measures to be taken to secure the safety of the corp's right flank, permitted the evacuation of large stores of gasoline and rations sorely needed by the enemy, and denied him the use of three vital routes of approach. The determination, heroism, and esprit de corps displayed by the individual officers and men of the battalion in this successful action against a powerful enemy armored force, despite severe losses, prevented the enemy from penetrating the corp's rear areas and contributed materially to the ultimate failure of his counterattack. It reflects great credit on the 254th Engineer Combat Battalion and is in keeping with the finest traditions of the military service.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|4th Armored Division\n| U.S. Army\n| 1945\n| Ardennes\n| 22 December 1944&nbsp;– 27 March 1945; WD GO 54, 1945\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|30th Infantry Division||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Army ||valign=\"top\"|2020||valign=\"top\"|Mortain, France ||valign=\"top\" | Statement from the President, Washington D.C., 17 March 2020: At my direction, the United States Army will award the Presidential Unit Citation to the 30th Infantry Division.  More than 75 years ago, Soldiers of the 30th Infantry Division slept in their foxholes after hastily taking defensive positions around the small town of Mortain, France.  They woke to find themselves under attack by an entire German Panzer Corps.  Through this assault, Adolf Hitler gambled to keep American forces from breaking out of the Normandy beachhead and into the open countryside.  The Nazi plan required the Panzer forces to cut through the 30th Infantry Division en route to the sea.  However, the actions of the 30th Infantry Division would prove to be decisive in blunting this attack.\nNicknamed the \"Old Hickory Division\" because its Soldiers hailed from National Guard units from North and South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia&nbsp;– all States closely associated with President Andrew Jackson&nbsp;– the 30th Division Soldiers proved as tough as their unit's namesake.  The situation they faced on August 6, 1944, was dire.  They found themselves confronted by overwhelming enemy armor, and the German Panzers broke through their lines.  The Old Hickory Division, however, did not stop fighting.  It pressed its cooks, clerks, and drivers into service as riflemen.  The Division's artillery protected its encircled and isolated elements with a constant barrage of fire.  At daybreak, American and British close air support arrived to help.  By the afternoon of August 7, the German attack stalled and the Division quickly counterattacked to relieve its trapped elements, through another five days of fierce fighting.  More than 2,000 Old Hickory Soldiers were killed or wounded during the weeklong battle, but their efforts and sacrifice would have a profound impact on the course of history.\nAfter the War, eight units within the 30th Infantry Division were recognized with the Presidential Unit Citation.  Today, I am proud to direct the Army to honor the remainder of the Division and attached units with the Presidential Unit Citation for their heroic stand at Mortain.  This action rightfully recognizes our Veterans who triumphed against incredible odds, as well as those who died during a critical battle that helped ensure the Allied victory in Europe.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|254th Infantry Regiment, 63rd Infantry Division\n| U.S. Army\n| 1945\n| Colmar, France\n|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|2nd Battalion 254th Infantry Regiment, 63rd Infantry Division\n| U.S. Army\n| 1945\n| Jebsheim, France\n|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|1st and 3rd Battalions, 254th Infantry Regiment, 63rd Infantry Division\n| U.S. Army\n| 1945\n| Ensheim, Germany (Siegfried Line)\n|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|3d Battalion and Companies A and B, 253d Infantry Regiment, 63rd Infantry Division\n| U.S. Army\n| 1945\n| Kleinblittersdorf, Germany\n|\n|-\n|2nd & 3rd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment || U.S. Army || 1944 || New Guinea||\n|-\n|C Company and 2nd platoon, D Company, 134th Infantry Regiment, 35th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||Rhineland ||\n|-\n|1st and 2nd Battalions, 397th Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army||1946||Central Europe||HEILBRONN inscription\n|-\n|H Company, 397th Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army||1946||Ardennes-Alsace||RIMLING inscription\n|-\n|3rd Battalion, 397th Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army||1951||Ardennes-Alsace||RIMLING inscription\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 3rd Battalion, 398th Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division\n| rowspan=\"2\" | U.S. Army\n||1945||France||BITCHE inscription\n|-\n||1946||Central Europe||HEILBRONN inscription\n|-\n|1st Battalion, 399th Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army||1946||France||RAON L'ETAPE inscription\n|-\n|3rd Battalion, 399th Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army||1952||Central Europe||BEILSTEIN inscription\n|-\n|3rd Battalion, 313th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||France||OBERROEDERN inscription\n|-\n|1st Battalion, 314th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||Northern France||LA HAYE DU PUITS inscription\n|-\n|2nd Battalion, 314th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||Normandy||FORT DU ROULE inscription\n|-\n|A Company, 315th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||Rhineland||EMBERMENIL inscription\n|-\n|2nd Battalion, 315th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||Ardennes-Alsace (Battle of Hatten and Rittershoffen)||HATTEN inscription\n|-\n|F Company, 315th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||Rhineland||EMBERMENIL inscription\n|-\n|3rd Battalion, 315th Infantry Regiment, 79th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||Ardennes-Alsace (Battle of Hatten and Rittershoffen)||RITTERSHOFFEN inscription\n|-\n|310th Field Artillery Battalion, 79th Infantry Division ||U.S. Army|| ||Battle of Hatten and Rittershoffen||\n|-\n|B Company, 894th Tank Destroyer Battalion ||U.S. Army||1944||Anzio||For distinction during the period from 1 February through 16 February 1944\n|-\n|}\nArmy Air Forces\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" align=\"left\"\n!

The citations read as follows:\n***\n\"The 322nd Bombardment Group (M). For outstanding performance of duty in action in the European Theater of Operations from 15 May 1943 to 24 July 1944. Throughout this period the members of the 322nd Bombardment Group (M) distinguished themselves by their record of achievement both during the Air Offensive, Europe, and the campaign in Northern Europe, and in the course of operations the group demonstrated unusual ability and versatility in the perfection of new techniques of medium bombardment which were of particular importance in the orientation and training of the 9th Bombardment Division (M) as a whole. After its initial low-level B-26 tactics had proven unsuitable for operations in the type mission upon which the aircraft were dispatched, the 322nd Bombardment Group (M) embarked upon an intensive training program in medium-altitude formation bombing procedure, the success of which was instrumental in the adoption of the B-26 to play a vital role in aerial operations in the European Theater of Operations. The precision achieved in the development of blind formation bombing achieved by the group was an important factor in the employment of the B-26 in operations of great success. In addition, the members of the group distinguished themselves by their brilliant adoption of night bombing technique, which represented and important augmentation to the versatility of medium bombardment aircraft. The outstanding record achieved by the 322nd Bombardment Group (M) throughout these operations, together with the extraordinary success which attended the many innovations in operational procedure, have marked the group and its personnel with particular distinction. The perseverance, fortitude and devotion to duty displayed by the members of the organisation despite the difficulties and hazards of untried ways, place the 322nd Bombardment Group (M) among the ranks of those organisations which have contributed in large measure to the blazing of new trails for the Army Air Forces\"\n***\nBy command of Major General VANDENBERG:\nW.W.Millard Colonel, GSC C of S.\n|-\n|344th Bombardment Group\n|U.S. Army Air Force\n|1944\n|Cherbourg Peninsula, St. Lo area, Normandy, France\n|The 344th Bombardment Group (M) is cited for extraordinary heroism in armed conflict with the enemy from 24 to 26 July 1944. The 344th Bombardment Group (M) played a vital role in preparing the way for an Allied offensive on the Cherbourg Peninsula by attacking four vital enemy installations. On 24 July the group dispatched 39 aircraft to attack a key bridge over the Loire River near Tours, which was being used to bring hostile reinforcements into the St. Lo sector. Despite an intense barrage of antiaircraft fire which dispersed the lead flight and damaged 31 aircraft, the intrepid airmen dispatched their bombs with telling effect and destroyed the bridge. On the morning of the following day a full-strength attack was launched against enemy troop concentrations in the path of Allied troops advancing in the area of St. Lo. Four hours later the group attacked and severed a railroad viaduct at Maintenon, and, on 26 July, a formation of B-26 type aircraft from the group destroyed a large supply of fuel and ammunition. As a result of the gallant courage of the airmen and the determined efforts of the ground personnel, the Allied ground forces were able to advance over the area with minimum losses. By their bravery and determination, the officers and men of the 344th Bombardment Group (M) reflect great credit on themselves and the Army Air Forces.&nbsp; (General Orders 170, Headquarters Ninth Air Force, 31 August 1945, as approved by the commanding General, European Theater (Main).)\nBy order of the Secretary of War\nEDWARD F.

Participating in the operations which preceded and supported the Allied breakthrough at Cassino, Italy, the 320th Bombardment Group, displaying extraordinary accuracy in effectively bombarding rail and highway bridges, troop concentrations, airfields and shipping, repeatedly dropped all its bombs within 200 yards of pinpoint targets. On 12 May 1944, in direct support of the Fifth Army's advance along the coastal highway toward Rome, the 320th Bombardment Group achieved spectacular results in an attack on heavily defended enemy troop concentrations, including the famed 15th Panzer Grenadier Division, bivouaced near Fondi. At 1330 hours, thirty six B-26 Marauder aircraft of the 320th Bombardment Group took off from their Sardinian base and made landfall southeast of Sperlonga, Italy. Displaying superior flying skills and extraordinary heroism, the group pilots steadfastly held their flights intact through heavy and accurate anti-aircraft fire which tracked them from landfall to the target and back to the coast. So deadly was the hostile fire that, notwithstanding, the most skillful employment of vigorous evasive action, seventeen of their bombers were damaged and several crew members wounded. Resolutely continuing on a long, deliberate bomb run despite the intense barrage, determined pilots, expertly holding their unescorted Marauders in a superbly coordinated formation, enabled the bombers to release 3,978 fragmentation bombs with unerring precision. The concentrated pattern which blanketed the target area inflicted irreplaceable casualties and destruction upon the already hard pressed enemy, smashing this key concentration of reserves and rendering incalculable aid to the Allied ground forces in their drive northward. The outstanding results achieved which set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement are typical of the continuously superior precision bombing of the 320th Bombardment Group, and were possibly only through remarkable leadership, unstinted effort and superlative performance of duty by every member of the organization. Through their unsurpassed courage, skill in combat and steadfast devotion of duty, the personnel of the 320th Bombardment Group have reflected great credit upon themselves and the Military Service of the United States.\nBy Command of Major General Cannon:  Official: William Dick, Colonel, Adjudant General.

For outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy in the European Theater of Operations on March 15, 1945. In direct coordination with the Allied Offensive against the enemy ground forces in the Saar-Palatinate, the Seventh Army was ordered to attack directly through the strongly fortified Seigfried Line along a front east of Zweibrucken, Germany; the objective of this Marauder Group was to effectively blanket hostile pillboxes, and tank obstructions with heavy demolition bombs to sufficiently weaken that much vaunted line, enabling the ground forces to break through the enemy positions. Despite accurate anti-aircraft fire from the Seigfried defenses, the 320th Bombardment Group released a devastatingly accurate concentration of bombs to create inestimable damage to installations and personnel. The conspicuous part played by this group set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement and insured the success of these operations. Beginning at 0630 hours, on March 15, 1945, five waves of nineteen B-26 aircraft of the 320th Bombardment Group took off from this French base. Despite persistent and accurate ground fire, the Marauders resolutely persevered on unwavering axes of attack to execute long deliberate and flawless bomb runs releasing 1340 high explosives in perfect patterns within the assigned coordinates despite heavy ground haze, inflicting irreplaceable casualties upon the enemy personnel. After photographs revealed pillboxes, communication trenches, weapons pits and roads devastated within the target area with such effect that the Seventh Army made its initial breakthrough of the Seigfried Line with virtually no opposition over the areas attacked by the 320th Bombardment Group. This perfectly executed endeavor of air-ground coordination was carried through to its highly successful conclusion by a complete coverage of heavy, visibly limiting, ground haze. This was accomplished by the remarkable leadership of perfectly teamed pilot-bombardier combinations thoroughly trained in the revolutionary technique on non-visual Shoran bombing and the constantly proficient contributions of all personnel in this Marauder Group. This Operation is typical of the superior bombing of the 320th Bombardment Group, has reflected the greatest credit upon the Group and the Armed Service of the United States.\nBy Command of Major General Webster:  C.

Crumrine, Colonel, AC Chief of Staff.\n|-\n|3d Fighter Group, Fourteenth Air Force ||U.S. Army||1945||Mission \"A\", China||Between 1 May 1944 and 30 June 1944, the Chinese-American Composite Wing waged a campaign against a Japanese advance of 75,000 troops and a full mechanized division, across the Honan Plains. Although the Wing was composed of personnel of two nationalities, had arrived in the area only a few weeks previously, had local maps with only major checkpoints translated into English, and had to have all supplies air-lifted in, it caused the Japanese drive to falter. The Wing accounted for [an estimated] 2317 enemy troops killed or wounded, 1321 cavalry and pack animals destroyed, 865 enemy vehicles destroyed and damaged, 48 aircraft and damaged, and 110 river boats (two more 100 feet in length) destroyed. This while the Wing had an average of 799 officers and enlisted personnel (Chinese and American), with 31 fighter aircraft P-40 and 11 medium bombers B-25 For this, the CACW was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation on 18 Aug 1945.\n|-\n|387th Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army Air Force||1945|| Mayen, Germany, Railroad Bridge||The 387th Bombardment Group is cited for extraordinary heroism in armed conflict with the enemy on 23 December 1944, when the group was dispatched to attack a vital and strongly defended railway bridge at Mayen, Germany. While en route to the target the second box of B-26 airplanes, which was without fighter escort and was separated by several miles from the first box, was viciously attacked by from 15 to 25 Messerschmitt aircraft. Despite the determined defensive fire which took a large toll of the hostile fighters, the enemy pressed his attacks with such fury that the low flight was overpowered and four B-26 aircraft were forced down in flames. Although in the ensuing encounters every airplane in the remaining two flights sustained damage from the enemy attacks, the gallant airmen succeeded in driving four of the enemy airplanes to certain destruction and forcing four more to break away in flames. Meanwhile, the first box pressed on to the target despite intermittent flank and the imminence of fighter attack. Although a pathfinder failure occurred 1 minute before bomb-release time, the bombardiers synchronized on the target with such accuracy that extensive damage was inflicted on the bridge. Notwithstanding the heavy losses incurred during the enemy attacks the second box returned for an additional run on the target, and as a result of their determined efforts the central portion of the bridge span was completely destroyed. Despite the severe damage inflicted on the group's aircraft during the morning mission, the officers and men of the 387th Bombardment Group displayed great determination in embarking on another mission only 2 hours after the bombers had returned to base. A withering hail of antiaircraft fire was encountered over the target area at Prum, Germany, which damaged 21 of the 26 airplanes dispatched. In the face of this sustained barrage of flak the courageous airmen released their bombs with a high degree of accuracy upon the communications installations. In carrying out this dual blow against the enemy's communication and transportation facilities on this date, the officers and men of the 387th Bombardment Group displayed aerial skill, resolution, and devotion to duty in keeping with the finest traditions of the Army Air Forces.

On 17, 18, and 19 August 1944, during a period of concentrated bombing attacks against the huge Ploesti oil refinery in Rumania, the aircraft of the 154th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, preceding the bombers over this vital target, conducted an extensive pre-attack reconnaissance of the target's defensive system.  Prior to the attack the ground personnel worked tirelessly to have their aircraft at the peak of mechanical condition to insure the success of this maximum effort of the squadron.  Facing defending enemy fighters and intense barrages of anti-aircraft fire with supreme courage and utter disregard of the extreme hazards confronting them, the pilots of these lightly armed, unescorted reconnaissance aircraft circled, crossed and re-crossed the heavily defended target area while procuring target defense data.  The weather aircraft pilots, following the initial transmission of the assembled detailed data, continued to traverse the target area, photographing the progress and results of the attack and maintaining a flow of target information to the successive waves of bomber aircraft.  Using the vital data furnished by the 154th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron's pilots, the bomber forces carried out highly successful attacks, destroying large areas of vitally important refinery installations and supplies.  The aggressiveness, daring and high tactical efficiency, together with the outstanding teamwork displayed in the execution of these missions, while inaugurating new tactics against heavily defended targets is an outstanding example of efficiency and versatility.  By the untiring efforts and devotion to duty of the ground crews, together with the aggressiveness, courage and professional skill of the pilots, this mission, executed in keeping with the highest traditions of the Armed Forces of the United States of America, has contributed greatly to the hastening of the defeat of the enemy.\n|-\n|319th Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army|||1944||||| In March, it earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for raids on marshalling yards in Rome and Florence that damaged enemy communications without destroying cultural monuments.\n|-\n|330th Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army||1945||Mission 27 & 46||The group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for incendiary raids on the industrial sections of Tokushima and Gifu and for a strike against the hydroelectric power center at Kofu, Japan, in July 1945.

The citations read as follows : The 480th Antisubmarine Group, Army Air Forces, is cited for outstanding performance of duty in action with the enemy during the period 10 November 1942 to 28 October 1943 in the European and North African theaters of operation.  It was the pioneer organization in the establishment of Army Air Forces offensive antisubmarine operations in the Eastern Hemisphere. From the beginning of the existence of the Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command (activated 15 October 1942) this Group led Army Air Forces forces in the fight against the U-boat, carrying the offensive to the home waters of the enemy. Thereby it contributed significantly to the success of United Nations operations in North Africa and to the invasion of Europe. The Group participated in all phases of the Battle of the Atlantic and defeated the enemy above, on, and below the surface of the sea. Its activities reached a climax in the second week of July 1943, when the enemy made every effort to thwart the supply and reinforcement of our forces then undertaking the invasion of Sicily. In the 9 days between 6 and 14 July (inclusive) airplanes of this organization made 12 attacks on enemy submarines, 8 of which resulted in the destruction of, or probable damage to, the enemy. The authorized airplane strength of the Group was 24 B-24 type bombers. Over a period of 12 months this small force sent its airplanes out over the convoy and shipping lanes leading to Europe and North Africa on missions extending as far as 1,250 miles from base and lasting as long as 17 hours. Flying alone and often heavily outnumbered, the 480th Antisubmarine Group's airplanes encountered prowling Ju 88's and Fw 200's, and attacked and defeated them in air battles over convoys and when on patrol. Although outnumbered in these battles in the average ratio of 1 to 3 they destroyed 2 enemy airplanes for each 1 of their own aircraft lost. Its killed and missing personnel number 101 officers and men, nearly 50 percent of its authorized strength (240). The 480th Antisubmarine Group has contributed with heroism and superior efficiency to the winning of the Battle of the Atlantic. Its record is inspiring and worthy of emulation.

Following the Rhine River crossings made on a large scale by allied Armies, the 42nd United States Infantry Divisions arrived at the out skirts of the fortress city of Schweinfurt, Germany, an important communications center. With its advance towards Nuremberg and Munich impeded by numerous strong points in this city, which constituted one of the principle German held defense bastions, it was necessary to neutralize Schweinfurt by air bombardment. The magnificent air cooperation provided the 42nd Division by the 42nd bombardment Wing On this noteworthy occasion is an eloquent tribute to the effectiveness of air ground coordination and teamwork. The preeminent part played by the 17th Bombardment Group set it above and apart from other units participating in the same engagement and insured the effectiveness of these operations as a whole. After taking off from their base at Dijon, France, at 09.15 hours on 10 April 1945, sixty-eight B-26 aircraft from the Group commenced their bombing run near the objective amid a barrage of heavy and accurate anti-aircraft fire which damaged fifteen of the attacking Marauders. The twelve flights of bombers resolutely persevered on their course over the target in perfect formation and accomplished the bombing with incredible precision. Photo reconnaissance revealed that the 133 tons of bombs released on the objective by the 17th Bombardment Group achieved unparalleled destruction. Such extensive damage was inflicted upon the city by blast and fire that the military effectiveness of the enemy troops defending the city was paralyzed. The success of the mission, so typical of the superior bombing of the 17th Bombardment Group, was so catastrophic for the enemy that the 42nd Division was able to seize Schweinfurt with virtually no opposition, thereby accelerating the advance of the Seventh Army towards Nuremberg and Munich, thus bringing to a more rapid conclusion the ultimate victory of the Allies.  The thoroughness of the mission planning and the precision of the execution attests to the efficiency, élan, and determination of the combat crews. The superior results achieved are attributable to the extensive cooperation and devotion to duty displayed by the ground crews and the administration staffs who made possible such an exceptional achievement. The enormous damage inflicted upon the enemy installations by the 17th Bombardment Group in the Mediterranean and European Theater of Operations, during a period of twenty-nine consecutive months of air warfare was accomplished by a consistently high bombing accuracy which is believed to be without precedent. Through its unique and highly successful performance against the enemy in six hundred and six bombing missions, the 17th Bombardment Group has won for itself an enviable position in the Army Air Forces which reflected the greatest credit upon the Group conforming to the most illustrious traditions of the United States military service.\n|-\n|92nd Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army Air Force||1944|| Oschersleben, Germany|| Field Order _; Tuesday, 11 JAN 1944; Primary Target: Oschersleben, Secondary Target: Halberstadt, Formation: The 92nd Bomb Group (325th, 326th, 327th, 407th Squadrons) 40th Combat Wing, the 325th flew High Squadron-High Group, 407th Low Squadron.\n|-\n|389th Bomb Group ||U.S. Army Air Corps||August 1, 1943|| Câmpina, Ploiești, Romania||\n|-\n|450th Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army Air Corps||1944|| Regensburg, Germany||\nThe 450th Bombardment Group (H) is cited for outstanding performance of duty in armed conflict with the enemy. On 24 February 1944, the 450th Bombardment Group (H) was notified to prepare a maximum number of aircraft for a mission against the Prufening Aircraft Factory in Regensburg, Germany. The initial purpose of this attack was to destroy the important plant, capable of producing two hundred and fifty Messerschmitt Bf 109's monthly. A successful completion of the mission would cost the enemy 8 to 9 months of production and would materially diminish Nazi interception of allied strategic bombing on the continent. Throughout the evening prior to the attack the ground crews worked untiringly in a muddy field, determined to have their aircraft in perfect mechanical condition for this vital operation. On 25 February 1944, twenty nine B-24 type aircraft heavily loaded with maximum tonnage took off for their important destination in the lead of an entire wing formation. Hazardous weather was encountered shortly after the take off, and over 15 enemy fighters intercepted them while they were still 300 miles from the target. The gallant crews fought off the enemy onslaught, overcame the hazards of weather, and unwaveringly held to their course as a second wave of twenty Messerschmitt Bf 109's attacked them. The approach to the target and the target proper were heavily defended by flak batteries that threw up an intense barrage through which the formation flew undaunted to a precise bombing run, delivering a telling blow to the important factory and surrounding installations. This outstanding contributed immeasurably to the effective crippling of enemy production at a significant time. The palls of smoke issuing from the debris left in the wake of the bombers obscured observation, but subsequent reconnaissance revealed a complete destruction of the target. Throughout the serial battle the courageous crews fought two more enemy onslaughts en route and accounted for one enemy aircraft destroyed. Our own losses were held down to 4 lost, in a mission wrought with hazardous weather, intense ground defenses, and a total of over 60 enemy fighters. By the determination, outstanding professional skill, and heroic courage of the combat crews, together with the devotion to duty of the ground personnel, the 450th Bombardment Group (H) has rendered an invaluable contribution to the allied war effort, thereby reflecting great credit on themselves and the armed forces of the United States.\n|-\n|450th Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army Air Corps||1944||Ploesti, Romania||For outstanding performance of duty in armed conflict with the enemy. On 4 April 1944, the 450th Bombardment Group was notified to prepare a maximum number of aircraft for a mission against the Ploesti Marshalling Yards in Rumania. The initial purpose of this mission was disrupt the enemy's oil supply so vital to their operations on the Eastern front and to their interception of Allied strategic bombing. Prior to this operation, the ground crews worked zealously with grim determination to have their aircraft at the peak of mechanical performance to insure the success of the mission. On 5 April 1944, forty (40) B-24 type aircraft, heavily loaded with maximum tonnage, were airborne, and, after assuming the lead of the wing formation, set course for their destination. Nearin the target the formation was aggressively attacked by approximately fifty (50) enemy aircraft, firing rockets, cannon and heavy machine guns, in a desperate effort to break up and destroy the bomber formation before the objective was reached. Displaying outstanding courage and determination, realizing the strategic importance of their task, the gallant crew battled their way through to the target. Despite the persistence of the fighter attacks, the intense barrage of enemy flak and partial concealment of the target by a smoke screen, the group continued for a highly successful bombing run, inflicting grave damage to vital enemy installations, supplies and equipment. Throughout the aerial battle, these gallant crews, in the heroic defense of their aircraft, destroyed a total of twenty-seven (27) enemy fighters and probably destroyed or damaged many more, thus holding our losses to a minimum for such a long and extremely hazardous mission. By the conspicuous gallantry, professional skill and determination of the combat crews, together with the superior technical skill and devotion to duty of the ground personnel, the 450th Bombardment Group has reflected great credit upon itself and the Armed forces of the United States of America.\n|-\n|463rd Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army Air Force||1944|| Ploesti, Romania||The 463d Bombardment Group is cited for outstanding performance of duty in armed conflict with the enemy. Assigned the mission to attack and destroy the Romano Americano Oil Refinery, Ploesti, Romania, in an effort to reduce the total Axis oil production to a critical point in her military requirements. The ground crews worked enthusiastically and with grim determination to have their aircraft at the peak of mechanical perfection to insure the success of this mission despite the damages and losses suffered by their group through a sustained period of operations. On 18 May 1944, thirty-five B-17 type aircraft, heavily loaded with maximum tonnage, were airborne, and despite adverse weather conditions rallied with the wing formation and set course for their destination. Under continued adverse weather conditions encountered en route, the visibility became so limited, with dense cloud layers reaching to 30,000-foot elevation, that all other units returned to base. Undaunted by the seemingly overwhelming odds, the 463d Bombardment Group continued on alone through the dense cloud coverage, which rendered compact formation flying extremely hazardous. Despite intense, heavy, and accurate enemy anti-aircraft fire encountered over the target, the gallant crews, displaying outstanding courage, professional skill, and determination, though many of their airplanes were damaged severely, maintained their tight formation and brought their ships through the enemy defenses for a highly successful bombing run, inflicting grave damage to vital enemy installations and supplies. Rallying off the target after the bombing run and while unprotected by friendly fighters, the group was savagely attacked by approximately 100 highly aggressive enemy fighters. In the ensuing fierce engagement, while battling their way through the heavy enemy opposition, the group lost 7 bombers; however, in the gallant defense of the formation, the gunners accounted for 28 enemy aircraft destroyed, 30 probably destroyed, and 2 damaged. With the arrival of friendly fighters, the remaining bombers proceeded for a safe landing without further damage. By the extraordinary heroism, airmanship, and grim determination of the combat crews, together with the highly technical skill and intense devotion to duty of the ground personnel, the 463d Bombardment Group has upheld the highest traditions of the military service, thereby reflecting great credit on themselves and the armed forces of the United States.\n|-\n|463rd Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army Air Force||1945|| Berlin, Germany||The 463d Bombardment Group is cited for outstanding performance of duty in armed conflict with the enemy. On 24 March 1945, this group was notified to prepare maximum aircraft to lead a wing formation on a mission to attack and destroy the Daimler-Benz Tank Works in Berlin, Germany. A successful completion of this mission would materially reduce the enemy hopes of a prolonged defensive against the Red Army then deployed on the eastern banks of the Oder River. Realizing the strategic importance of this undertaking, the deepest escorted penetration ever attempted in the European Theatre of Operations, and one hitherto deemed all but impossible from bases in Southern Italy, the ground crews enthusiastically and sedulously labored day and night to bring all available aircraft to the peak of mechanical efficiency despite the extensive battle damages incurred in the almost daily operations of the preceding month. Operations and Intelligence personnel indefatigably applied their greatest efforts to supply the carefully selected crews with vital bomb and target data. On 24 March 1945, thirty-one B-17 type aircraft loaded with maximum bomb tonnage took off, made rendezvous with other groups of the Wing, and after assuming the lead, set course for the objective. The Alps crossed, and having bypassed all known flak areas in Austria and Czechoslovakia, the group had almost entered Germany proper when suddenly and without warning it was savagely opposed by a concentrated and sustained anti-aircraft barrage which inflicted heavy damage to nearly the entire formation and destroyed four heavy bombers. Despite the intensity and accuracy of the heavy guns, the gallant crews battled their way through the many defenses, reformed the temporarily demoralized and scattered aircraft of the wing, and were successful at holding the entire formation intact at this critical stage of the flight. Passing out of the effective range of the gun emplacements, the battered group was immediately attacked by 15 jet propelled enemy fighters firing cannon and rockets which were only dispersed by the belated but aggressive appearance of friendly fighters after another bomber was destroyed in the running battle. As the fight continued, the crippled airplanes were realigned into three squadrons for the dual purposes of protective cover and bombing accuracy. Nearing the specific target, the flak-riddled formation was for the third time subjected to a stiffened enemy resistance and a sixth ship was shot down, but not withstanding the severe damage sustained by the aircraft, the unnerving experiences just passed, the improvised character of the formation, the last minute change of bombing calculations, and the weariness induced by many hours spent at high altitude, the 463rd Bombardment Group relentlessly and unswervingly led the entire wing formation through for an exceptionally successful bombing run, with the complete bomb tonnage of its formation concentrated in the target area thus inflicting extensive damage to vital enemy installations and supplies so greatly needed by the enemy in its defense of the capital city. Turning off the target, the formation rallied and turned for home. The long and still hazardous trip through heavily defended enemy terrain over mountainous regions and finally over water was too great a strain for 6 of the 20 airplanes which had reached the heart of the enemy's productive system and these were forced down at friendly fields in northern Italy and Yugoslavia for medical treatment to the many wounded men as well as mechanical repairs to the crippled aircraft. Only 14 of the original attacking force were successful in reaching their home base, but in no instance was there a reported case of insufficient fuel, so brilliantly had this mission been planned and so skillfully flown. By the conspicuous courage, airmanship, and determination of the combat crews, together with the outstanding professional skill and devotion to duty of the maintenance crews, the 463rd Bombardment Group upheld the highest traditions of the armed forces of the United States.\n|-\n|483rd Bombardment Group ||U.S. Army Air Force||1944|| Germany ||For outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy on 18 July 1944. In connection with the counter air offensive against vitally import and high priority targets in Germany, the 483rd Bombardment Group (H) was ordered to attack and destroy the enemy airdrome and installations at Memmingen. En route to the target, the Group became separated from the other Groups in the formation and from the fighter escort by extremely severe and adverse weather conditions. Alone, the Group proceeded to the target area where it was aggressively attacked by approximately two hundred (200) enemy fighters. In the air battle which ensued, gunners of the Group shot down or damaged sixty-six (66) enemy aircraft at the same time losing fourteen (14) airplanes with their entire crews. Undismayed by the ferocity and viciousness of the attack and in spite of the severe losses suffered, the remainder of the Group proceeded, and with great heroism, gallantry and determination, carried out the bombing attack as ordered, though under the concentrated gunfire of the entire enemy fighter force. The bombs were dropped on the target with devastating effect, destroying all major installations and destroying or damaging an additional thirty-five (35) grounded enemy aircraft. Throughout the entire action which was carried out with exceptional gallantry and determination, and in spite of overwhelming opposition, crew esprit and individual heroism could not be excelled. By their professional skill and devotion to duty, their extraordinary display of heroism in the face of unparalleled odds and the exceptionally gallant manner in which this attack was carried out, combat and ground personnel, 483rd Bombardment Group (H), have reflected great credit upon themselves and the Armed Forces of the United States of America.\n|-\n|317th Troop Carrier Group ||U.S. Army Air Force||1945|| Battle of Corregidor, Philippines||For outstanding performance of duty in action in the Philippine Islands on 16 and 17 February 1945.  As part of the campaign to liberate Luzon it was necessary that American forces retake from the Japanese the historic island fortress of Corregidor at the mouth of Manila Bay so as to open the port of Manila to Allied shipping.  The 317th Troop Carrier Group was assigned the mission of transporting and dropping the parachute troops who were to land on the plateau at the western end of the rocky island.  Successful accomplishment of the operation demanded thorough preparation, sound judgment, and exceptional flying skill on the part of the crews of the C-47's.  The 2 zones into which the paratroopers and their supplies were to be placed were of such small size that each plane had to come over the target individually and drop not more than 8 men on each pass.  Corregidor, with its multitude of caves, tunnels, and dug-in positions, afforded ideal concealment for anti-aircraft gunners and was a hazardous target over which to fly unarmed, unarmored C-47's at a height of only 400 to 600 feet above the dropping zones.  On the morning of 16 February, 51 of the group's C-47's dropped a total of 1,021 paratroopers and 151 bundles of supplies in a period of one hour, more than 92 percent of the troops and supplies landing in the designated areas.  In a period of nearly 1½ hours on the afternoon of the same day 50 C-47's dropped 978 paratroopers and 159 bundles, 94 percent of the men and supplies landing in the target zones.  On the morning of 17 February, 43 C-47s dropped 197 bundles of supplies in less than an hour; 95 percent to 98 percent hit the target.  On the afternoon of 17 February, during a period of nearly 2½ hours, 785 bundles of supplies were dropped by 33 C-47s, 98 percent landing in the target zones.  In all, approximately 563 separate passes had to be made to put the 1,999 paratroopers and 1,292 bundles on Corregidor.  Anti-aircraft and small arms fire from the desperate and fanatical Japanese defenders of the island damaged 25 of the transports.  The outstanding courage and superb flying skill of its air crews and the tireless determination and exemplary technical proficiency of its ground echelon enabled the 317th Troop Carrier Group to play a significant role in the liberation of Luzon.  Its achievements have brought great honor to the armed forces of the United States.\nBy direction of the President, under the provisions of Executive Order No. 9396 (Section I, Bulletin 22, WD, 1943), superseding Executive Order No. 9075 (Section III, Bulletin 2, WD, 1942), and of Section IV, Circular No. 333, WD, 1943, the following units are cited by the Commanding General, Far East Air Forces:\n|-\n|442nd Troop Carrier Group ||U.S. Army Air Force||1944|| D Day: Operation_Overlord, France||For outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy on 5, 6, and 7 June 1944.  On these dates, members of Group Headquarters and of the 303d, 304th, 305th, and 306th Troop Carrier Squadrons of the 442nd Troop Carrier Group accomplished 108 sorties in unarmed and unarmored aircraft, in unfavorable weather, at minimum altitudes and airspeeds, over water, in troop carrier's bold leadership of the invasion of the European Continent.  The magnificent teamwork of the personnel of this unit, the expert performance of their duties with coolness and precision, despite formidable opposing ground fire, and the courage displayed in their dispatch of their loads of paratroops with extreme accuracy over vital zones are in keeping with the highest traditions of the service.\nGeneral Orders No 85, War Department, Washington 25, D.C., 3 November 1944\n|-\n|}\nNavy\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" align=\"left\"\n!

An aggressive veteran after a year of continuous and intensive operations in this area, the U.S.S. O'BANNON has taken a tremendous toll of vital Japanese warships, surface vessels, and aircraft. Launching a close-range attack on hostile combatant ships off Guadalcanal on the night of November 13, 1942, the O'BANNON scored three torpedo hits on a Japanese battleship, boldly engaged two other men o' war with gunfire and retired safely in spite of damage sustained. During three days of incessant hostilities in July 1943, she gallantly stood down Kula Gulf to bombard enemy shore positions in coverage of our assault groups, later taking a valiant part in the rescue of survivors from the torpedoed U.S.S. STRONG while under fierce coastal battery fire and aerial bombing attack and adding her firepower toward the destruction of a large Japanese naval force. In company with two destroyers, the O'BANNON boldly intercepted and repulsed nine hostile warships off Vella Lavella on October 7, 1943, destroying two enemy ships and damaging others. Although severely damaged, she stood by to take aboard and care for survivors of a friendly torpedoed destroyer and retired to base under her own power. The O'BANNON's splendid achievements and the gallant fighting spirit of her officers and men reflect great credit upon the United States Naval Service.\"\nFor the President, /s/ Frank Knox, Secretary of the Navy\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Navy||valign=\"top\"|1943||valign=\"top\"|Guadalcanal Campaign ||valign=\"top\"|Navy Citation, for service at Guadalcanal from August through December 1942:\n\"The vessel arrived off Guadalcanal on 7 August, disembarked her troops, unloaded her cargo, and left the Solomons two days later, bound for New Caledonia. Alchiba returned to Guadalcanal on 18 September. After unloading cargo to support marines struggling for that island, she sailed back to New Caledonia for more supplies and returned to Guadalcanal on 1 November. She was anchored off Lunga Point at 0616 on 28 November, when two torpedoes from the Japanese submarine 1–16 exploded on the vessel's port side. At that time, her hold was loaded with drums of gasoline and ammunition, and the resulting explosion shot flames  in the air. The commanding officer ordered the ship to get underway to run her up on the beach. This action undoubtedly saved the ship. Hungry flames raged in the ship for over five days before weary fire fighting parties finally brought them under control. Salvage operations began soon thereafter. Most of her cargo was saved, and temporary repairs were in progress when Alchiba was torpedoed again on 7 December. An enemy submarine's conning tower had been spotted shortly before two torpedoes were fired. One passed close under the cargo ship's stern, but the other struck her port side near the engine room. The blast killed three men, wounded six others, and caused considerable structural damage. Once the fires and flooding were controlled, salvage operations resumed and enabled the ship to get underway for Tulagi on 27 December 1942.\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Navy||valign=\"top\"|1944||valign=\"top\"|\nFor sinking the  in November 1944&nbsp;– the largest warship ever sunk by a submarine\n|The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION to the UNITED STATES SHIP ARCHERFISH for service as set forth in the following CITATION:\n\"For extraordinary heroism in action during the Fifth War Patrol against enemy Japanese combatant units in restricted waters of the Pacific.

Quickly laying down a heavy smoke screen, the gallant ships of the Task Unit waged battle fiercely against the superior speed and fire power of the advancing enemy, swiftly launching and rearming aircraft and violently zigzagging in protection of vessels stricken by hostile armor-piercing shells, anti-personnel projectiles and suicide bombers. With one carrier of the group sunk, others badly damaged and squadron aircraft courageously coordinating in the attacks by making dry runs over the enemy Fleet as the Japanese relentlessly closed in for the kill, two of the Unit's valiant destroyers and one destroyer escort charged the battleships point-blank and, expending their last torpedoes in desperate defense of the entire group, went down under the enemy's heavy shells as a climax to two and one half hours of sustained and furious combat. The courageous determination and the superb teamwork of the officers and men who fought the embarked planes and who manned the ships of Task Unit 77.4.3 were instrumental in effecting the retirement of a hostile force threatening our Leyte invasion operations and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\"\nFor the President,\n/signed/ JAMES FORRESTAL Secretary of the Navy\nThis unit also awarded the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation Badge for the same action, dated October 12, 1984.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Navy||valign=\"top\"|1945||valign=\"top\"|Battle of Okinawa\n|\n\"For extraordinary heroism in action as a Picket Ship on Radar Picket Station during a coordinated attack by approximately twenty-five Japanese aircraft near Okinawa on May 3, 1945. Shooting down two Kamikazes which approached in determined suicide dives, the U.S.S. Laffey was struck by a bomb from a third suicide plane as she fought to destroy this attacker before it crashed into her superstructure and sprayed the entire area with flaming gasoline. Instantly flooded in her after engine room and fireroom, she battled against flames and exploding ammunition on deck and, maneuvering in a tight circle because of damage to her steering gear, countered another coordinated suicide attack and destroyed three Kamikazes in rapid succession. Still smoking heavily and maneuvering radically, she lost all power when her forward fireroom flooded under a seventh suicide plane which dropped a bomb close aboard and dived in flames into the main deck. Unable to recover from this blow before an eighth bomber crashed into her superstructure bulkhead only a few seconds later, she attempted to shoot down a ninth Kamikaze diving toward her at high speed and, despite the destruction of nearly all her gun mounts aft when this plane struck her, took under fire the tenth bomb-laden plane, which penetrated the dense smoke to crash on board with a devastating explosion. With fires raging uncontrolled, ammunition exploding and all engine spaces except the forward engine room flooded as she settled in the water and listed to port, she began a nightlong battle to remain afloat and, with the assistance of a towing vessel, finally reached port the following morning. By her superb fighting spirit and the courage and determination of her entire company, the Laffey upheld the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\"\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Navy||valign=\"top\"|1942||valign=\"top\"|Naval Battle of Guadalcanal\n|\nShortly after midnight on 13 November 1942, at the start of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the destroyer USS Laffey was crippled early in the battle yet engaged two Japanese battleships and two destroyers at point-blank range.

On the morning of 23 April, the 1st Battalion was given the mission of cleaning out enemy pockets in the rear and on the right and left flanks of the 29th British Independent Brigade.  After fighting fiercely the entire day, the battalion was ordered to attack an enemy force estimated to be composed of two regiments which had forced the withdrawal of friendly troops resulting in the entrapment of the Belgian United Nations Battalion.  Under intense enemy small-arms, automatic-weapons, mortar, and artillery fire, the battalion launched a night attack which was pressed with such aggressiveness, determination, and skill that the enemy was required to commit his entire force to meet the onslaught, thereby relieving pressure on the Belgian Battalion and allowing them to withdraw all equipment and vehicles. Following the withdrawal of the Belgian Battalion, and although surrounded on three sides by enemy troops, the 1st Battalion immediately started a brilliantly executed disengagement. The 1st Battalion inflicted such staggering losses on the enemy that he was unable to continue action in that area. On the afternoon of 24 April, the battalion, after a movement of some 15 miles, took up positions of the 7th Infantry Regiment's main line of resistance with the mission of holding a sector of this line. During the night of 24–25 April, the enemy hurled the might of two whole divisions against the 7th Infantry Regiment's front. Although the enemy had succeeded In infiltrating to the rear of the battalion and its right Bank was completely exposed, the 1st Battalion and attached units fought with magnificent tenacity and courage, holding in line until all other units of the 3d Infantry Division had withdrawn. When ordered, the battalion withdrew under a series of enemy attacks. This gallant unit killed over 3,000 enemy troops and wounded an estimated 5,500 of the enemy.

On 23 November, the 2d Battalion, 7th Infantry, moved into defensive positions on a hill which was of vital importance to the ceasefire talks then in progress. Soon after assuming responsibility for this sector, the battalion was subjected to a heavy barrage of mortar and artillery fire as a prelude to a full-scale enemy attack. Shortly thereafter, an estimated two regiments of the enemy were observed moving frantically through their own supporting fire in an assault against the friendly positions. Wave after wave of the hostile troops came charging up the slope, only to be beaten back by the heavy fire poured into their ranks by the friendly force. The enemy, determined to take their objective at all costs, concentrated five battalions at one sector of the defense line and, under this tremendous pressure, one of the friendly companies was forced to execute a limited withdrawal to save itself from total annihilation, Although masses of the enemy were hurling themselves at the entire friendly line, the defenders, fighting fiercely against heavy odds, held them back except for this single penetration, The 2d Battalion, 15th Infantry, was immediately ordered to move forward and block the hostile troops attempting to push through the gap in the defense line. Upon reaching the area, one company immediately launched a spirited counterattack. Despite the heavy fire pouring down on them from all sides, the friendly troops pushed the enemy back steadily until the heavy casualties inflicted on them by the numerically superior hostile force made it necessary for them to halt their advance and occupy defensive positions on a newly won ridge. Another friendly company quickly moved through these positions and continued the attack until the enemy was repulsed and the breach in the friendly defense was closed. At this point, a fresh assault company advanced through the other two, who were in the process of consolidating their positions, and drove the enemy completely from the area with heavy casualties. The hostile force immediately launched a fierce counterattack but the friendly troops, exhibiting a matchless fighting spirit, repulsed the enemy repeatedly. Finally, seriously weakened by the tremendous casualties they had suffered, the hostile troops retreated, completely frustrated in their attempt to force the friendly troops from the strategic hill.  In this action, approximately 2,000 of the enemy were killed, approximately 8,000 wounded, and 8 taken prisoner. The 2d Battalion, 7th Infantry, and the 2d Battalion, 15th Infantry, 3d Infantry Division, and attached units displayed such superlative effectiveness in accomplishing their mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating in the action.

On the evening of 30 June, the 3d Battalion and attached units commenced their assigned mission which was to attack and seize Hill 717, the commanding terrain feature of the Chorwon-Kumhwa-Pyonggang area. A previous attempt by a friendly battalion to secure this vital objective had been unsuccessful because of the numerical superiority of the enemy force. Advancing nearly  over rugged and uncertain terrain in darkness, while continually under intense enemy small-arms, automatic-weapons, artillery, and mortar fire, the battalion and attached units moved up the precipitous slopes and pressed the attack with such aggressiveness, determination, and skill that the enemy was forced to abandon carefully prepared entrenchments. Throughout the night of 1 July, the hostile force savagely counterattacked, attempting to dislodge the battalion and attached units from their precarious positions on the slopes of Hill 717. On the morning of 2 July, the battalion and attached units resumed their assault against the enemy's fortified hill positions. Even though they had suffered severely from the previous night's engagement, these gallant units, imbued with a steadfast determination, continued to advance against vast numbers of the enemy, inflicting staggering losses on the hostile force. To supplement its seriously depleted force, the enemy was forced to commit additional reserves to prevent the seizure of this important hill by the friendly forces. The battle continued to rage throughout the night of 2 July, with the enemy force hurling its entire might against the 3d Battalion and attached units, repeatedly charging down on the friendly forces in suicidal waves. In the face of tremendous odds, the valiant members of these units engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat with such magnificent tenacity and courage that their positions remained intact and the enemy was repulsed with heavy casualties. The fierce battle went on until, late in the afternoon of 3 July, the stubbornly resisting hostile force was routed from its strongly defended hilltop emplacements. After repulsing several enemy counterattacks during the night, the positions of the friendly units were consolidated on 4 July. Throughout this heroic engagement, more than 1,500 casualties were inflicted on the hostile troops. The 3d Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 3d Infantry Division, and attached units displayed such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing their mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating in the action.

The enemy had broken through the main line of resistance and penetrated to the area north of Kapyong. The units listed above were deployed to stem the assault. The 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, moved to the right flank of the sector and took up defensive positions north of the Pukham River. The 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, defended in the vicinity of Hill 677 on the left flank. Company A, 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion, supported all units to the full extent of its capacity and, in addition, kept the main roads open and assisted in evacuating the wounded. Troops from a retreating division passed through the sector which enabled enemy troops to infiltrate with the withdrawing forces. The enemy attacked savagely under the clamor of bugles and trumpets. The forward elements were completely surrounded going through the first day and into the second. Again and again the enemy threw waves of troops at the gallant defenders, and many times succeeded in penetrating the outer defenses, but each time the courageous, indomitable, and determined soldiers repulsed the fanatical attacks. Ammunition ran low and there was no time for food. Critical supplies were dropped by air to the encircled troops, and they stood their ground in resolute defiance of the enemy. With serene and indefatigable persistence, the gallant soldiers held their defensive positions and took heavy tolls of the enemy. In some instances when the enemy penetrated the defenses, the commanders directed friendly artillery fire on their own positions in repelling the thrusts. Toward the close of 25 April, the enemy breakthrough had been stopped. The seriousness of the breakthrough on the central front had been changed from defeat to victory by the gallant stand of these heroic and courageous soldiers. The 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment; 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry; and Company A, 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion, displayed such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing their missions under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating in the campaign, and by their achievements they brought distinguished credit on themselves, their homelands, and all freedom-loving nations.\nBY COMMAND OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL VAN FLEET\nLeven C. Allen\nMajor General U.S. Army Chief of Staff\n|-\n|2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry || Canadian Army || 22 April to 25 April 1951 || Kapyong ||Only 2nd Battalion permitted to carry DUC streamer on Regimental Colour (see above for full citation, simultaneously awarded to 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment as well).\n|-\n|1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment || British Army || 23rd, 24th, and 25 April 1951 || Battle of the Imjin River || The citation reads as follows:-\nThe 1ST BATTALION GLOUCESTERSHIRE REGIMENT, BRITISH ARMY and TROOP C, 170TH INDEPENDENT MORTAR BATTERY, ROYAL ARTILLERY, attached, are cited for exceptionally outstanding performance of duty and extraordinary heroism in action against the armed enemy near Solma-ri, Korea on the 23rd, 24th and 25 April 1951. The 1st BATTALION and TROOP C were defending a very critical sector of the battle front during a determined attack by the enemy. The defending units were overwhelmingly outnumbered. The 83rd Chinese Communist Army drove the full force of its savage assault at the positions held by the 1st BATTALION, GLOUCESTERSHIRE REGIMENT and attached unit. The route of supply ran Southeast from the battalion between two hills. The hills dominated the surrounding terrain northwest to the Imjin River. Enemy pressure built up on the battalion front during the day 23 April. On 24 April the weight of the attack had driven the right flank of the battalion back. The pressure grew heavier and heavier and the battalion and attached unit were forced into a perimeter defense on Hill 235. During the night, heavy enemy forces had by-passed the staunch defenders and closed all avenues of escape. The courageous soldiers of the battalion and attached unit were holding the critical route selected by the enemy for one column of the general offensive designed to encircle and destroy 1st Corps. These gallant soldiers would not retreat. As they were compressed tighter and tighter in their perimeter defense, they called for close-in air strikes to assist in holding firm. Completely surrounded by tremendous numbers, these indomitable, resolute, and tenacious soldiers fought back with unsurpassed fortitude and courage. As ammunition ran low and the advancing hordes moved closer and closer, these splendid soldiers fought back viciously to prevent the enemy from overrunning the position and moving rapidly to the south. Their heroic stand provided the critically needed time to regroup other 1st Corps units and block the southern advance of the enemy. Time and again efforts were made to reach the battalion, but the enemy strength blocked each effort. Without thought of defeat or surrender, this heroic force demonstrated superb battlefield courage and discipline. Every yard of ground they surrendered was covered with enemy dead until the last gallant soldier of the fighting battalion was over-powered by the final surge of the enemy masses. The 1st BATTALION, GLOUCESTERSHIRE REGIMENT and TROOP C, 170th INDEPENDENT MORTAR BATTERY displayed such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing their mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set them apart and above other units participating in the same battle. Their sustained brilliance in battle, their resoluteness, and extraordinary heroism are in keeping with the finest traditions of the renowned military forces of the British Commonwealth, and reflect unsurpassed credit on these courageous soldiers and their homeland.\n|-\n|Belgian United Nations Command || Belgian Army Luxembourg Army || 23rd, 24th, and 25 April 1951 || Battle of the Imjin River ||Known as the Belgian and Luxembourg Volunteer Corps For Koriea.

Serving as a blocking element to deny hostile forces approach routes into Saigon and portions of Binh Chanh District, Company D and attached units repeatedly displayed outstanding acts of valor against superior forces in offensive, defensive, and ambush operations. During the period nine major contacts were made with elements of four North Vietnamese Army battalions and in each instance the enemy forces were routed from the battlefield by the aggressive action, teamwork, firepower, spirit, heroism, and outstanding tactics of the combined arms team. Maintaining pressure on the enemy forces to prevent their withdrawal, Company D dispersed and demoralized the units and prevented their reorganization, while killing 181 North Vietnamese Army soldiers and capturing ten prisoners of war, numerous weapons, equipment, and ammunition. Throughout the prolonged period of savage fighting the men of Company D by their relentless determination, undaunted courage and aggressive spirit performed countless acts of heroism as they defeated enemy forces with numerically superior automatic weapons, small arms, mortar and rocket fire. These actions significantly contributed to the overall defense of Saigon.

Company C was engaged by a battalion of the 272nd Regiment of the North Vietnamese Army which was fighting from a sheltered and fortified bunker complex.  The North Vietnamese had resisted hours of air support and artillery fire and was expected to overwhelm Company C, unless they were relieved. Company C's ammunition was running low, and was not mobile due to numerous casualties.  A lack of landing zones precluded relief or retreat. Troop A made a 4&nbsp;km march through difficult jungle terrain to mount a direct assault into the fortified North Vietnamese Army position.  Outnumbered three to one, Troop A's attack placed them into close range of the concealed defenders.

Throughout this period, Observation Squadron SIXTY-SEVEN (VO-67), operating in the Republic of Vietnam, successfully executed its primary mission of providing quick reaction, close air support, and combat logistics support for United States and Vietnamese military forces. In the face of extremely harsh climatic conditions at a remote operating base, while sustaining extensive operating damage and losses, the flight crews and ground support personnel of VO-67 carried out their highly important and extremely sensitive missions with outstanding skill and dedication. The Squadron flew countless missions implanting newly developed sensors to detect enemy movement. The support provided by VO-67 was instrumental in supplying real-time intelligence regarding the movement of North Vietnamese troops and supplies, which enabled U.S. Forces to prevent the total invasion of the U.S. Marine Combat Base at Khe Sanh during the Tet Offensive and contributed to saving countless lives. The squadron's operations were consistently characterized by prudent tactics while maintaining meticulous adherence to the rules of engagement, ensuring maximum deterrence of the enemy with minimum risk to friendly troops and civilians. VO-67' s successful initiation of this new mission provided a significant and vital contribution to the art of warfare. By their outstanding courage, resourcefulness, and aggressive fighting spirit in combat against a frequently well-equipped, well-trained, and often numerically superior enemy, the officers and enlisted personnel of Observation Squadron SIXTY-SEVEN reflected great credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"| and Carrier Air Wing Eleven||valign=\"top\"| U.S. Navy||valign=\"top\"|1969||valign=\"top\"|Vietnam War||valign=\"top\"|9 January 1969: The Presidential Unit Citation, covering 23 December 1967&nbsp;– 1 June 1968, was awarded to the U.S.S.

The heroic efforts, extraordinary bravery and professional competence displayed by the men of the 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry and attached units are in the highest tradition of the military service and reflect great credit upon themselves, their units and the Armed Forces of the United States.\"\n|-\n|9th Marine Regiment ||U.S. Marine Corps|| || Operation Dewey Canyon ||2 January 1969 to 18 March 1969 Army PUC.\n|-\n|| 26th Marine Regiment ||U.S. Marine Corps|||| Battle of Khe Sanh ||20 January to 1 April 1968\n|-\n|1st Mobile Communications Group ||U.S. Air Force||1969||Vietnam War||1 January 1967 to 15 February 1968\n|-\n|1879th Comminisation Squadron\n|U.S. Air Force\n|1969\n|Vietnam War\n|21 June 1968 to 30 June 1969 DAFSO GB-939/70\n|-\n|D Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment ||Australian Army||1968|| Battle of Long Tan ||18 August 1966&nbsp;– 19 August 1966\n|-\n|17th Special Operations Squadron||U.S. Air Force||1969||Vietnam War||1–30 June 1969 Combat in Southeast Asia, 1 June 1969–30 September 1971.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|834th Air Division||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Air Force||valign=\"top\"|1969||valign=\"top\"|Battle of Khe Sanh||valign=\"top\"|483rd Tactical Airlift Wing, 535th Tactical Airlift Squadron (C-7A Caribou) received the Navy Presidential Unit Citation and the Air Force Presidential Unit Citation for airlift support of Khe Sanh and other forward bases from January to May 1968.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|834th Air Division||valign=\"top\"|U.S. Air Force||valign=\"top\"|1971||valign=\"top\"|Battle of Dak Seang||valign=\"top\"|483rd Tactical Airlift Wing, 535th Tactical Airlift Squadron (C-7A Caribou) received the Air Force Presidential Unit Citation, Special Order GB-613 dated 3 September 1971, for extraordinary gallantry from 1 April 1970 to 30 June 1970 for participation in aerial resupply of the besieged Special Forces Camp at Deak Seang. Nearly all C-7A Caribou's sustained battle damage during this time. Six, 6, C-7A Caribou's and fifteen, 15, airmen were lost during this time due to extreme enemy fire. This amounts to almost one-half of C-7A Caribou losses since the U.S. Air Force took over the C-7A Caribou mission from the U.S. Army in 1967. The primary mission for C-7A Caribou's was to support Special Forces and Special Operations Group missions and bases located throughout South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.\n|-\n|| 3rd Marine Division ||U.S. Marine Corps||8 March 65–15 September 67||Vietnam War||For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong forces in the Republic of Vietnam from 8 March 1965 to 15 September 1967. Throughout this period, the Third Marine Division (Reinforced), operating in the five northernmost provinces of the Republic of Vietnam, successfully executed its three-fold mission of occupying and defending key terrain, seeking out and destroying the enemy, and conducting an intensive pacification program. Operating in an area bordered by over 200 miles of South China Sea coastline, the mountainous Laotian border and the Demilitarized Zone, the Third Marine Division (Reinforced) successfully executed eighty major combat operations, carrying the battle to the enemy, destroying many of his forces, and capturing thousands of tons of weapons and material. In addition to these major operations, more than 125,000 offensive counterguerrilla actions, ranging from squad patrols and ambushes to company-sizes search and destroy operations, were conducted in both the coastal rice lands and the mountainous jungle inland. These bitterly contested actions routed the enemy from his well-entrenched positions, denied him access to his source of food, restricted his freedom of movement, and removed his influence from the heavily populated areas. In numerous operations, the Third marine Division (Reinforced) demonstrated the great efficacy of combined operations with units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. In July 1966, the Third marine Division (Reinforced) moved to the north to counter major elements of the North Vietnamese Army moving across the Demilitarized Zone into the province of Quang Tri; its units fought a series of savage battles against the enemy, repeatedly distinguishing themselves and, time and again, forcing the enemy to retreat across the Demilitarized Zone. Imbued with an unrelenting combat spirit and initiative and undeterred by heavy hostile artillery and mortar fire, extremely difficult terrain, incessant heat and monsoon rains, the Third marine Division (Reinforced), employing courageous ground, heliborne and amphibious assaults, complemented by intense and accurate air, artillery and naval gunfire support, inflicted great losses on the enemy and denied him the political and military victory he sought to achieve at any cost. The outstanding courage, resourcefulness and aggressive fighting spirit of the officers and men of the Third marine Division (Reinforced) in battle after battle against a well-equipped and well-trained enemy, often numerically superior in strength, and the great humanitarianism constantly shown to the people of the Republic of Vietnam, reflected great credit upon the Marine Corps and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|| 1st Marine Division ||U.S. Marine Corps||29 March 65–15 September 67||Vietnam War||\n|-\n|| 1st Marine Aircraft Wing ||U.S. Marine Corps||1968||Vietnam War||For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Gong forces in the Republic of Vietnam, from 11 May 1965 to 15 September 1967. Throughout this period, the First Marine Aircraft Wing, operating in I and II Corps tactical -zones of the Republic of Vietnam, North Vietnam, and adjacent waters, sought out and destroyed determined enemy forces and provided combat air support to ground forces of the Free World and the Republic of Vietnam. Participating in 195 major operations, and thousands of other attacks, the Wing continuously and aggressively carried the battle to the elusive enemy in bitterly contested actions. Operations such as DOUBLE EAGLE, HARVEST MOON, STARLITE, HASTINGS, PRAIRIE, UNION, HICKORY, COCHISE, AND SWIFT, reflect the high degree of superior airmanship, valor, devotion to duty and professionalism exhibited by personnel of the Wing. Although heavily committed to increased combat operations, the Wing developed and successfully employed new weapons, tactics, and procedures against the hard-core communist forces with gratifying results. Through the aggressive actions of the Wing, military and political victories were denied the insurgent communist forces, thereby providing a more stable atmosphere for the legally constituted Government of the Republic of Vietnam. The establishment, and logistical support of many separate airfields throughout the I Corps tactical zone and the vital air supply support provided the III Marine Amphibious Force and its allied ground forces, was a tribute to the resourcefulness and determination of the Wing. This dependable support was provided under the most trying and difficult combat conditions. Flying in fair weather and foul, against a fanatical, well-armed enemy, the uncommon courage and intrepidity of the Marine pilots and supporting Wing personnel, acting in a concerted team effort, contributed to another glorious chapter in an already illustrious history. The valor, devotion to duty, aggressive spirit, professionalism, and ingenuity of the entire First Marine Aircraft Wing in battle against a well trained, dangerous, and determined enemy, reflected the highest degree of heroism and exemplary performance, and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|| 5th Marine Regiment ||U.S. Marine Corps||25 April-5 June 67||Vietnam War||\n|-\n|| 1st Marine Regiment ||U.S. Marine Corps||31 January-2 March 68||Vietnam War||\n|-\n|| 1st Marine Division ||U.S. Marine Corps||16 September 67–31 October 68||Vietnam War||\n|-\n| Seal Team One || U.S. Navy || 11 November 1968 || Vietnam War ||THE PRESIDENT of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the PRESIDENTIAL UNIT CITATION TO SEAL TEAM ONE for service as set forth in the following CITATION:\nFor exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 16 July 1966 to 31 August 1967, in the conduct of naval unconventional warfare operations against the Viet Cong in the Republic of Vietnam. Although often required to carry out their operations in treacherous and almost impenetrable mangrove swamps against overwhelming odds, SEAL TEAM ONE personnel maintained an aggressive operating schedule and were highly successful in gathering intelligence data and in interdicting Viet Cong operations. On one occasion, a six-man fire team ambushed one junk and two sampans, accounting for seven Viet Cong dead and the capture of valuable intelligence data. During this daring ambush, all members of the fire team remained in exposed, waist-deep mud and water in order to obtain clear fields of fire. As a result of their constant alertness and skillful reading of Viet Cong trail markers, patrols of SEAL TEAM ONE succeeded in discovering numerous well-concealed Viet Cong base camps and supply caches, and captured or destroyed over 228 tons of Viet Cong rice, as well as numerous river craft, weapons, buildings, and documents. The outstanding esprit de corps of the men of this unit was evidenced on 7 October 1966 when a direct hit by an enemy mortar round wounded sixteen of the nineteen men aboard the detachment's armed LCM, and again on 7 April 1967 when three members of the SEAL TEAM ONE LCM were killed and eleven were wounded in a fire fight with Viet Cong positioned along the banks of a narrow stream. On both occasions, SEAL TEAM ONE men who were able, even though seriously wounded, returned to their positions and continued to fire their weapons until the boat was out of danger, thereby helping to save the lives of their comrades. The heroic achievements of SEAL TEAM ONE reflect the outstanding professionalism, valor, teamwork, and selfless dedication of the unit's officers and men. Their performance was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|| 1st Marine Regiment ||U.S. Marine Corps||20 November-31 December 68||Vietnam War||\n|-\n|| Combined Action Program ||U.S. Marine Corps||1 January-31 December 68||Vietnam War||\n|-\n| Seal Team Two || U.S. Navy || 1970 || Vietnam ||\n|-\n|| Operation Sealords || Various units||1968–1972||Vietnam War||\n|-\n|| Operation Swift raiders ||Various units||6 December 1968&nbsp;– 31 March 1969||Vietnam War||\n|-\n|Mobile Riverine Force (Task Force 117)||U.S. Navy||29 January to 4 March 1968||Vietnam War||For exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 29 January to 4 March 1968 while engaged in armed conflict against communist insurgent (Viet Cong) forces in the Republic of Vietnam. Throughout the Tet (Lunar New Year) Offensive, the Mobile Riverine Force (MRF) was locked in nearly continuous combat as the enemy lay siege to or threatened to attack every large population center and military installation in the Delta.  During this hectic, 35-day campaign, the MRF played a vital role in driving the enemy out of My Tho and Vinh Long, the most severely ravaged of all the Delta cities, and in preventing enemy forces from launching sustained attacks on Can Tho, Binh Thuy, Sa Dec, Cai Be, Cai Lay, the Army Base at Đồng Tâm, and many other less populated areas.  In every battle, MRF personnel, both individually and collectively, although often matched against forces of much greater size than their own, displayed outstanding courage and professionalism in subduing the Viet Cong challenge.  Navy crewmen embarked in Monitors, Command and Communication Boats, Assault Support Patrol Boats, and Armored Troop Carriers were frequently ambushed at point-blank range from concealed positions along both banks of the narrow, jungle-enshrouded Delta streams.  In each instance, they succeeded in suppressing the enemy fire before maneuvering their assault craft out of ambush areas. Together, the MRF Army/Navy team successfully met the challenge posed by the Tet Offensive, probably saving the Delta from being overrun by insurgent forces.  The gallantry, professionalism, courage under fire, and devotion to duty displayed by the officers and men of the United States Navy Element of the Mobile Riverine Force were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|Commander Task Group 194.0 (Units Participating in Operation Sealords)||U.S. Navy||18 October to 5 December 1968||Vietnam War||For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty from 18 October to 5 December 1968 while engaged in armed conflict against enemy forces in the Republic of Vietnam. Commander Task Group 194.0 initiated and prosecuted the first of several interdiction campaigns to sever enemy lines of communication and resupply and to establish the legal government in areas previously held by the enemy. The naval units engaged in Operation SEA LORDS consistently displayed the striking power and professionalism which were to mark this and following campaigns.  Tasked with routing a myriad of enemy forces from their previous sanctuaries, personnel of Commander Task Group 194.0 ventured courageously into little-known canals and back-water areas, fighting valiantly through countless intense enemy rocket and automatic weapons attacks. The naval units, through their persistent and aggressive strikes against enemy strongholds, were eminently successful in their campaign to interdict enemy resupply routes and base areas throughout the lower Mekong Delta region. The courage, professionalism, and dedication displayed by the officers and men of Commander Task Group 194.0 reflected credit upon themselves and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|Commander Task Group 194.9 (Units Participating in Operation Giant Slingshot)||U.S. Navy||6 December 1968 to 31 March 1969||Vietnam War||For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty from 6 December 1968 to 31 March 1969 while engaged in armed conflict against enemy forces in the Republic of Vietnam.  Commander Task Group 194.9 initiated and prosecuted a determined interdiction offensive against the ingress of enemy personnel and war material from Southeast Cambodia into the upper Mekong Delta region of the Republic of Vietnam. The naval units engaged in Operation GIANT SLINGSHOT, including the Riverine Warfare and River Patrol Forces who supplied support, consistently distinguished themselves by their countless deeds of valiant service while carrying out patrols along the narrow, enemy-infested Vam Co, Vam Co Dong, and Vam Co Tay Rivers. Operating with limited logistic support under austere and dangerous conditions, personnel of Commander Task Group 194.9 countered intense rocket and automatic weapons barrages at point-blank range with unshakable determination. As a result of their intrepidity and resolution, the enemy threat was significantly diminished and vital routes of resupply were severed. The quantity of captured enemy war material reached staggering proportions, and the ever-increasing number of enemy casualties attested to the effectiveness of ingeniously developed individual and group offensive tactics. The selfless dedication and inspiring professional performance of the officers and men of Commander Task Group 194.9 reflected credit upon themselves and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|Mobile Riverine Force (Task Force 117)||U.S. Navy||25 January through 5 July 1969||Vietnam War||For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty from 25 January through 5 July 1969 while engaged in armed conflict against enemy forces in the Mekong Delta region of the Republic of Vietnam. With enemy forces planning to launch a large-scale, winter-spring offensive against Saigon and other cities of the upper Mekong Delta, the ships and assault craft of Task Force 117 provided waterborne mobile support to United States Army, Vietnamese Army, and Vietnamese Marine Corps troops. By riverine assault operations preempting enemy offensive operations, the Force made a significant contribution to thwarting the threat to Saigon and the Mekong Delta. Surprise attacks and routine fire fights on the narrow streams and canals were an almost daily occurrence, while rocket and mining attacks against the Mobile Riverine Bases were an ever-present danger. The courage and determination of Task Force 117 personnel contributed significantly to the successful completion of each Force objective. The skill, fortitude, perseverance, and sustained outstanding performance of the officers and men of the United States Navy Element of the Mobile Riverine Force reflected great credit upon themselves and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|Rung Sat Special Zone River Patrol Group||U.S. Navy||24 June 1969 to 28 February 1970||Vietnam War||For extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against an armed enemy in the Republic of Vietnam from 24 June 1969 to 28 February 1970.  During this period, the Rung Sat Special Zone River Patrol Group operated throughout the 405-square-mile maze of rivers, canals, waterways and mangrove swamps of the Rung Sat Special Zone and on the upper Saigon River.  When enemy sappers mounted an aggressive offensive against free-world merchant shipping in late spring of 1969, the Rung Sat Special Zone River Patrol Group, in conjunction with South Vietnamese forces, commenced a unique, unrelenting campaign of combined counter-offensive operations.  Over two-hundred successful combined operations with United States Army, Air Force and South Vietnamese ground, air and waterborne units were conducted, which routed the enemy from his sanctuaries, denied him access to his source of food, restricted his freedom of movement, and established security for the safe passage of 4,800 free-world merchant ships on the vital Long Tau shipping channel to Saigon.  Concurrent with operations in the Rung Sat Special Zone, the task group demonstrated great flexibility and response by initiating counter-offensive operations against threatening enemy forces on the upper Saigon River.  Despite extremely limited support facilities, incessant heat, and torrential monsoon rains, units of the task force fought a series of savage battles, repeatedly distinguishing themselves, and inflicted great losses on the enemy, denying him further use of a major infiltration route threatening the city of Saigon. The outstanding courage, resourcefulness, and perseverance displayed by the officers and men of the Rung Sat Special Zone River Patrol Group were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n|-\n|2nd Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, composed of: Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2d Brigade 3d Battalion, 47th Infantry, 3d Battalion, 60th Infantry, Company C, 4th Battalion, 47th Infantry, 3d Battalion, 34th Artillery||U.S. Army||29 January to 4 March 1968||Vietnam War||The foregoing assigned units of the 2d Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, United States Army component of the Mobile Riverine Force, distinguished themselves by displaying extraordinary heroism in action against an armed hostile force during the Tet Offensive and immediately thereafter from 29 January to 4 March 1968 in the Mekong Delta, Republic of Vietnam. Although the enemy possessed many tactical advantages due to an intimate knowledge of the area and detailed long range planning, his offensive was shattered within 5 weeks of its inception. In the Provincial capital of My Tho, 2d Brigade soldiers fought in a crowded city, an unfamiliar environment for infantry who were trained to fight primarily in a riverine environment. After restoring the security of the western sector of the city, the riverine forces commenced successive operations against enemy movements. At Cai Lai, they disrupted enemy attempts at regrouping. Strikes in and around Vinh Long and My Tho collapsed maturing enemy offensives which threatened these two key cities. Finally the riverine forces moved to the relief of the city of Can Tho, where, in 3 weeks of virtually continuous combat, the heaviest enemy attack of the entire Delta offensive was broken. The 2d Brigade engaged the enemy wherever he could be found and inflicted heavy casualties. The achievements of the riverine forces in turning back the enemy offensive represent a key factor in the operations that saved the Delta. The aggressiveness, determination, and exemplary courage under fire demonstrated by all members of the United States Army component are in the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon the 2d Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, the Mobile Riverine Force, and the United States Army.\n|-\n|1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, composed of: Headquarters and Headquarters Company 2nd Battalion, 39th Infantry-2nd Battalion 60th Infantry, and Attached Units: Company A, 15th Engineer Battalion-1st Battalion, 11th Artillery||U.S. Army||7 March 1968 to 22 June 1968||Vietnam War||The 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, and attached units distinguished themselves by extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against hostile forces in the Republic of Vietnam during the period 7 March 1968 to 22 June 1968. The 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division with attached units reopened and secured Highway 4, the vital link between the Mekong Delta and Saigon, in Dinh Tuong Province and conducted operations against main-force units operating in the area adjacent to Highway 4. In a series of operations, the 1st Brigade, with Company A, 15th Engineer Battalion (Attached) and the 1st Battalion, 11th Artillery in direct support, located and engaged superior enemy forces in some of the most difficult terrain in Vietnam. The swift, decisive and fierce actions of the maneuver and supporting elements annihilated three well equipped and well trained enemy battalions. The 1st Brigade succeeded in driving the Viet Cong from their traditional base areas in central Dinh Tuong Province. During these actions, 629 Viet Cong were killed and 144 captured along with 184 individual and crew served weapons captured and destroyed. The 1st Brigade's success in reopening Highway 4 restored use of this vital communications link to the Vietnamese populace.

During the period 12 November 2006 to 14 January 2007, Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 5th Squadron, 73d Cavalry Regiment and its subordinate units displayed extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy in and around Turki Village, Diyala Province, Iraq, while deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this period, the unit successfully built a capable and effective Iraqi Security Force which prevented enemy personnel and materiel from crossing through Iran into Iraq, denied safe haven to insurgents and provided a peaceful and secure environment for the Iraqi people. In addition, the unit conducted countless combat patrols and launched Operation Turki Bowl, an extremely successful offensive campaign which crushed the will of a Wahabist insurgent group known as \"The Council. \" The council had enacted a violent guerrilla campaign against the Iraqi Security Forces and local Iraqi civilian population, greatly threatening regional stability. However, the unit fearlessly met the threat head-on, conducting 14 squadron and troop-level operations over a 3-month period which set the stage for a classic linear battle in which over 250 Al Qaeda operatives were killed and over 100 caches discovered.

This awesome display of combat power was accomplished while simultaneously freeing the Iraqi people from more than 30 years of oppression and reestablishing basic infrastructure in the country. During the 33 days of combat, to the transition to civil-military operations, I MEF sustained tempo of operations never before seen on the modern battlefield, conducting four major river crossings, maintaining the initiative, and sustaining forces. The ferocity and duration of the campaign was made possible through the skills and determination of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coalition Partners comprising I MEF at all levels, all echelons, and in all occupational fields.
