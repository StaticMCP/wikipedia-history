The sculpture was designed by Karol Badyna, and unveiled on 11 June 2013. The monument was proposed by the Museum of Polish History, and financed by the city of Warsaw.\nIt was Badyna's sixth bench monument dedicated to Karski, after Washington, D.C. (2002), Kielce (2005), New York City (2007), Łódź (2009), and Tel Aviv (2009). They were criticized by Karski's family, stating that he was against being commemorated with monuments, as well as by them having form of benches.\nDesign\nThe monument depicts Jan Karski sitting on a left side of a large recliner armchair. He is depicted thinking, while wearing a suit, with his legs crossed, and his left arm on an armrest, with his hand rubbing his cheen. The right side of the chair, forms a bench, for passersby to sit on. The right armrest also features a sculpture of Karski's 1944 book Story of a Secret State. The monument is also equipped with a sound system, which plays a recording about Karski's memoris from before the start of the Second World War, and after its end, when he worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland. It is placed at a garden square, near the intersection of Anielewicza and Zamenhofa Streets, next to the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews and the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes. The left side of the armchair features a Polish insciption, which reads:\nGallery\nFile:Jan Karski Statue in Warsaw.JPG|The monumnet from the front.\nFile:2018 Warszawa ławeczka Jana Karskiego.jpg|The monument from the left side.\nFile:Jan Karski Bench in Warsaw 02.jpg|Sculpture of book Story of a Secret State\nFile:Jan Karski Monument Warsaw 05.jpg|Insciption on the side of the monumnet.\nReferences"
