In recent times, these baskets were used for both everyday and ceremonial uses including carrying bush foods, babies, message sticks and ceremonial objects. The jawun style of bicornal basket is unique to the rainforest Aboriginal peoples of North Queensland. Other unique lawyercane artefacts include the wungarr, which was used in freshwater creeks to catch eels.\nExamples of the jawun and other basket weaving styles are regularly shown in national exhibitions and older examples are kept in special \"keeping places\" which house important cultural artefacts. A \"keeping place\" has been built at Jumbun while the Girringun Aboriginal Corporation in Cardwell also has another (Davey \"Buckeroo\" Lawrence Education, Training and Cultural Centre on the Bruce Highway, 235 Victoria St Cardwell).\nTours\nJumbun has recently relaunched its cultural tours. These tours include an inspection of the Keeping Place before a cultural walk into the rainforest is undertaken to showcase the practical knowledge of plants and animals in the forest. Opportunities for basket weaving and traditional jewellery making with women from the community is a highlight of the tour, as well as the serenity of the Moombay campsite where the tour takes place, with the gentle sounds of birdsong and the Murray River making for a stunning backdrop for a unique cultural experience.\nSee also\n* Australian Aboriginal culture\nReferences"
