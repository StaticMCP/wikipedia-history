The monument commemorates what is called the \"Turning Point\" of the American Revolution—the surrender of British forces led by General John Burgoyne to the Americans under General Horatio Gates during the Battles of Saratoga. Today the monument is part of Saratoga National Historical Park.\nDescription\nThe Saratoga Battle Monument contains four niches intended for life size bronze statues of the American commanders associated with the Battle of Saratoga.\n}}\nSaratoga Monument Association\nOn 17 October 1856, a group met at the General Schuyler House in Schuylerville, New York to discuss creation of a monument to celebrate the American victory at the Battle of Saratoga. In 1859, the Saratoga Monument Association was organized, with a board of fourteen permanent directors: George Strover, William Wilcox, Henry Holmes, James M. Marvin, John A. Corey, James M. Cook, Leroy Mowry, Asa C. Tefft, Peter Gansevoort, Hamilton Fish, Phillip Schuyler, George W. Blecker, and Horatio Seymour. Hamilton Fish was elected first president. The association was incorporated by New York State in 1859. The trustees got as far as choosing the location for the monument before the Civil War intervened. The effort to build the monument was resumed in 1872. In 1874, the New York State Legislature approved an appropriation of $50,000 for construction of the monument. The association asked each of the thirteen original states to pledge $5,000 each, but only Rhode Island replied with a conditional offer.\nCornerstone\nOn 17 October 1877, 100 years to the day after Burgoyne's surrender, the cornerstone of the monument was laid with great pageantry, including a parade two miles long to the site, music, speeches and the reading of Fitz-Greene Halleck's \"The Field of Grounded Arms\":\n...\nAnd such were Saratoga’s victors—such\nThe Yeomen-Brave, whose deeds and death have given\nA glory to her skies,\nA music to her name.\nIn honorable life her fields they trod,\nIn honorable death they sleep below;\nTheir sons’ proud feelings here\nTheir noblest monuments.\nConstruction\nThe monument was designed by John C. Markham of New Jersey.\nThe capstone was placed on 3 November 1882, and the bronze statues were completed in August 1887.\nThe statues were designed by George Bissell (Gates), Alexander Doyle (Schuyler), and William O'Donovan (Morgan). Markham designed the sixteen bronze bas-relief plaques that line the interior of the first floor.\nThe monument was formally dedicated and turned over to the State of New York on 18 October 1912. In 1980, the state transferred the monument to the US National Park Service.\nFunding\nFinal funding for the Saratoga Battle Monument consisted of $2,300 from private donations, $95,000 from the federal government, and $10,000 from New York  State. Much of the labor and material was donated. In 1895, when the monument was transferred to New York State, a debt of $4,500 remained.\nRenovations\nBy 1987, the monument had deteriorated such that it had to be closed due to safety concerns. A renovation was undertaken at a cost of $3 million, and the monument was reopened on Columbus Day, 2005. Funding was provided by the National Park Service thanks to the efforts of Congressman  Gerald Solomon.\nSee also\n*Bennington Battle Monument\n*Boot Monument\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nps.gov/places/saratoga-monument.htm Saratoga Monument] (National Park Service)"
