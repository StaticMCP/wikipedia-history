Learning of what Tariq ibn Ziyad had done, he became envious and decided to take part in the success. Landing at Algeciras, the Visigothic guides led by Julian led Musa to conquer important towns that had not been captured. The Ummayads arrived at Medina-Sidonia, which had surrendered to them.\nThe Visigothic guides led Musa to the city of Carmona. The city of Carmona was the most well fortified town in Spain and was less likely to be taken by assault or siege. When the Ummayads arrived there, the guides told Musa that the city could only be taken by stealth. Musa then made a plan; he dispatched some of Julian's armed men to the city, pretending to be soldiers who fled from their enemies after a battle. Julian's men arrived at the gate called Cordoba's gate, explaining what happened, and the garrison opened the gates for them. In the night, Musa dispatched some cavalry to the city. The guides opened the gates for the Muslims, which allowed them to enter and kill the guards. Thus Carmona fell into Muslim hands.\nWith the fall of Carmona to the Muslims, the entire region east of Seville was clear from any Visigothic resistance, which allowed Musa to advance to Seville.\nReferences\nSources\n*David James (2012), A History of Early Al-Andalus, The Akhbar Majmu'a.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/A_History_of_Early_Al_Andalus/YSipAgAAQBAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=carmona+Musa+712&pg=PA54&printsec=frontcover]\n*Reinhart Pieter Anne Dozy (1913), Spanish Islam, A History of the Moslems in Spain.[https://www.google.ae/books/edition/Spanish_Islam/cnlpAAAAMAAJ?hl=ar&gbpv=1&dq=carmona+Musa+712&pg=PA233&printsec=frontcover]\n*Agha Ibrahim Akram (2004), The Muslim Conquest of Spain.[https://archive.org/details/TheMuslimConquestOfSpain_201807/page/n68/mode/1up]"
