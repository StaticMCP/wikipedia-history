      "text": "# Will Buckingham\n\n}}\nWill Buckingham (born 28 September 1971) is a novelist, non-fiction writer, and philosopher.\nBorn in Norfolk, his education includes a master's degree in anthropology from Durham (1997) and a PhD in philosophy from Staffordshire University (2007).\nBuckingham held various academic posts including \"Reader in Writing and Creativity\" at De Montfort University, \"Visiting Associate Professor\" at Sichuan University, and \"Visiting Professor of Global Cultures\" at the Parami Institute, Yangon.\nBuckingham's novels often incorporate elements of his academic interests in philosophy and anthropology. The theme of \"otherness\" is ever-present. This is explored in his book Stealing with the Eyes about his experience doing anthropological research in the Tanimbar Islands, Indonesia (also the setting of the novel Cargo fever). An interest in the I-Ching led him to learn Chinese, travel to China, and write a novel, 64 Pieces, that consisted of 64 short stories inspired by the 64 hexagrams. His fiction has been translated into many languages.\nThe children's book The Snorgh and the Sailor was shortlisted for the Coventry Inspiration Book Awards, 2013.\nBuckingham is currently based in Yangon, Myanmar where he teaches creative writing.\nIn 2019, The Bookseller announced that Granta Books had acquired the rights for Buckingham's new novel Hello Stranger to be published in 2020.\nBibliography\nNon-fiction\n* Stealing with the Eyes.
