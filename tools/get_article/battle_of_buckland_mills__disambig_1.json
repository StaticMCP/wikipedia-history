Union cavalry led by Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick were caught in a Confederate ambush and defeated.\nNear Buckland Mills, on Broad Run, Confederate cavalry commander Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, with Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton's cavalry division, were covering Gen. Robert E. Lee's retirement from his defeat at Bristoe to the Rappahannock River. On October 19, they turned on Kilpatrick's pursuing Federal cavalry, while Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's division charged the Federal flank. Kilpatrick was routed, fleeing five miles to Haymarket and Gainesville. The Confederates derisively called the affair \"The Buckland Races\", although some Confederate commanders likened it to a fox hunt. The Condeferate forces incurred 41 casualties. The Union forces lost about 261 men, most of which were taken prisoner.\nBattlefield preservation\nThe Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved  of the battlefield.\nReferences\n* Adams, James Truslow, Dictionary of American History, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1940.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060526095138/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/ABPP/battles/va042.htm National Park Service battle description]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108183146/http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Blackburns%20Ford%20to%20Buckland%20Mills.pdf CWSAC Report Update and Resurvey: Individual Battlefield Profiles]"
