In the , The Leap had a population of 664 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is bounded to the north-west by Constant Creek and to the north by its mouth () into the Coral Sea. Sand Bay is offshore ().\nThe locality has a number of named peaks, including:\n* Sugarloaf Peak ()\n* The Leap (Mount Mandurana) ()\n* The Sister ()\nThere is a section of the Pioneer Peaks National Park in the centre of the locality. To the immediate west and south of the national park are areas of rural residential housing. The land use in the rest of the locality is a mixture of grazing and crop growing (predominantly sugarcane).\nThe Bruce Highway enters the locality from the south-east (Farleigh) and exits to the south-west (Hampden). The North Coast railway line follows a similar route to the north of the highway but there are no railway stations on that line serving the locality. There is a network of cane tramways in the locality to transport the harvested sugarcane to the sugar mill for processing.\nHistory\nThe Leap is named for a historical event in which it is widely believed an Aboriginal woman carrying her daughter leapt off a cliff to evade capture by the Queensland Native Police circa 1860. The woman died but her daughter survived.\nThe Leap Provisional School opened on 13 March 1893. On 1 January 1909, it became The Leap State School. In 1919, Arthur Edward Hunter (of The Leap Hotel) donated  of land for the school. The school closed on 8 August 1969. As the land had been donated for school purposes, the usual practice was that the land was returned to the donor or their heirs. Two people made claims to be Hunter's relatives, but the Queensland Government did not find the claims to be proven and decided in 1988 to sell the land and kept the proceeds. The school was at 2105 Maraju Yakapari Road ().\nThe North Coast railway line reached The Leap in 1924,  with the area being served by the following now-abandoned stations (from south to north):\n* Wundaru railway station ()\n* Mapalo railway station ()\n* The Leap railway station ()\n*Yakapari railway station ()\nDemographics\nIn the , The Leap had a population of 673 people.\nIn the , The Leap had a population of 642 people.\nIn the , The Leap had a population of 664 people.\nHeritage listings\nThe Leap has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* The Leap Cane Lift, Bruce Highway ()\nEducation\nThere are no schools in The Leap.
