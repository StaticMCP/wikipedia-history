The Eastern Romans have had―for over 400 years―their own Greek-speaking Orthodox Church following the East–West Schism in 1054.\nAfter claiming the Ottoman throne, Mehmed II sends an unmistakable signal to Byzantine emperor Constantine XI. Genoese mercenary Justinianus comes to the aid of the vastly under-staffed Eastern Romans with barely 7,000 troops to defend 14 miles of Theodosian Walls.\nUnlike the dis-united Crusades from western Europe to Jerusalem, the Ottoman army was highly centralized under the leadership of Mehmed II focused on breaking into Constantinople.\n|LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Mehmed II uses the Basilica cannon to penetrate the Theodosian Walls.\nIn a flashback to Mehmed's childhood, the narration goes back to when Murad II appoints his teenage son as the governor of the Amasya Province.

In the shadow of betrayal, Giustiniani attacks the Ottoman fleet.\n|LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Amid a spiral of brutality and low morale, Mehmed makes Giustiniani an enticing monetary offer.\nThe coffers of the city-state of Constantinople have become empty since the last ruler John VIII; the old hub of the Roman Empire can't trade to generate any revenue. Constantine XI can't pay the few remaining soldiers fighting to keep the Roman Empire afloat while no aid arrives from western Roman Catholics. Constantine announces that \"God will pay\" the soldiers, ordering a raid on the assets and artifacts of the Greek Orthodox churches.\nThe grand vizier urges Mehmed to seek a truce with his rival.\n|LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Ottoman cannons reduce the city walls to rubble, and Venetian reinforcements arrive too late.\nCatholic Europeans don't answer the Crusade calls of the Greek-speaking Romans in Constantinople (although back in 1203 when the 4th Crusaders arrived, they overthrew the Roman Emperor to set up the Latin Empire.)\nMehmed II named himself the Caesar of Rome since Constantinople had become the new Roman capital a 1,000 years prior. Mehmed orders the execution of Notaras. Finally, Mehmed executes Halil Pasha, his Grand Minister, for not believing in him when he was a teenage king.\n|LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\nSeason 2 (2022)\n|ShortSummary    = Mehmed II solidifies his reign, but in nearby Wallachia, childhood friend Vlad the Impaler gains notoriety and seeks to challenge Mehmed's hegemony.\nHamza Bey is dispatched to forcibly bring Vlad to Constantinople.\nVlad travels to Buda to solidify a military alliance with Matthias Corvinus.\n|LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = Mehmed sends Mara to coax Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus into an alliance.\nMehmed's forces reach the port city of Nicopolis; an epic battle along the Danube River looms, and Vlad has the upper hand.\nIn a flashback, Radu and his brother Vlad the Impaler are being raised by Murad II in Constantinople to ensure that their father Vlad II Dracul doesn't join forces with Hungary to fight against Ottomans.\n|LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = In June 1462, Mehmed II's troops have crossed the Danube River into Wallachia; As the night attack at Târgoviște unfolds, Vlad employs guerrilla tactics to weaken his rival. A threat lurks in the imperial palace.\nRadu, Vlad's brother who was raised in the Ottoman royal court, is in Mehmed's camp.\n|LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n|ShortSummary    = As the war drags on and resources dwindle, Vlad wages biological warfare on Mehmed's army.\nRadu closes in on Vlad's castle to take Anastasia, Vlad's wife, hostage.

Rise of Empires: Ottoman delivers, with a similarly novel approach, a chronicle of historical events.  Daily History concludes that \"the series uses correct timeline and description of the attack on Constantinople is incredibly accurate from the Ottoman perspective.\"\nHowever, \"despite the historical accuracy of the show, the dramatized events are more geared towards a captivating watching experience rather than an actual depiction of events.\" Some historians, such as Florian George Calian, suggest that the historical accuracy of at least the first session might be open to question: \"In the Netflix production Mehmed enters an empty Hagia Sophia alone, thus converting the most wanted building in the world into a mosque. The scene is dubbed by interviews with contemporary scholars, making viewers interested in acquiring historical knowledge believe that the series is well documented. But unfortunately, everything depicted here is inaccurate.\"\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds an approval rating of 87% based on 66 reviews, and an average rating of 4.3/5.\nSee also\n* Fall of Constantinople\n* Night Attack at Târgoviște\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[https://dailyhistory.org/How_Historically_Accurate_is_the_Rise_of_Empires:_Ottoman_Series%3F How Historically Accurate is the Rise of Empires: Ottoman Series?] at [https://dailyhistory.org/Main_Page DailyHistory.org]"
