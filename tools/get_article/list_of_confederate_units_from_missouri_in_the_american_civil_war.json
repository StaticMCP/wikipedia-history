A border state with both southern and northern influences, Missouri attempted to remain neutral when the war began. However, this was unacceptable to the Federal government, and Union military forces moved against the capital to arrest the legislature and the governor. Governor Claiborne Jackson called out the Missouri State Guard to resist. Union forces under Gen. Nathaniel Lyon seized the state capital, and a minority of pro-Union members of the legislature declared the governor removed from office. They appointed a pro-Union governor, and the Federal government recognized him even though he had not been elected. This resulted in a civil war within the state, as Missourians divided and joined both the Union and Confederate armies. Missouri sent representatives to the United States Congress and the Confederate States Congress, and was represented by a star on both flags.\nEarly in 1861, the Missouri State Guard was formed as a replacement to a state militia force that had previously been in existence.  Sterling Price was selected by Governor Jackson to command the unit.  Volunteers for the Missouri State Guard were organized into companies of 50 to 100 men, which were then assigned to regiments.  Each regiment was designed to contain between six and eight companies, so a Missouri State Guard regiment would contain 600 to 800 men at full strength.  At the Battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861, Missouri State Guard units fought alongside Confederate States Army troops; both the Missourians and the Confederate troops were under the command of Confederate Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch.28}}  Beginning on November 25, 1861, the men of the Missouri State Guard were allowed to transfer from the Guard to official Confederate service.  At the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862, Price commanded a mixed force that contained both Confederate soldiers from Missouri and elements of the Missouri State Guard.  By July 1862, almost all of the Missouri State Guard had left the unit to join Confederate States Army units.\nThe list of Missouri Union Civil War units is shown separately.\nInfantry\n]]\ncarried by the 4th Missouri Infantry]]\n* 1st Missouri Brigade\n* 1st Infantry (1st-4th Consolidated Infantry)\n* 2nd Infantry (2nd-6th Consolidated Infantry)\n* 3rd Infantry (3rd-5th Consolidated Infantry)\n* 4th Infantry (1st-4th Consolidated Infantry)\n* 5th Infantry (3rd-5th Consolidated Infantry)\n* 6th Infantry (2nd-6th Consolidated Infantry)\n* 8th Infantry\n* 9th Infantry\n* 10th Infantry\n* 11th Infantry\n* 12th Infantry\n* 16th Infantry\n* Winston's Regiment, Infantry\n* 1st Battalion, Infantry\n* 3rd Battalion, Infantry\n* 8th Battalion, Infantry\n* Perkins' Battalion, Infantry\nSharpshooters\n* 9th Battalion, Sharpshooters\n* Searcy's Battalion, Sharpshooters\nCavalry\n]]\n* Shelby's Iron Brigade\n* 1st Cavalry (1st-3rd Btln.

Because Missouri Confederate troops were effectively driven out of the geographic area of Missouri after the Pea Ridge Campaign, except during raids by Generals Marmaduke, Shelby and Price, many of the Missouri units recruited heavily in Arkansas.  This practice led some Missouri units to be mislabeled as Arkansas units when Confederate service records were compiled by the United States War Department in the 1880s, and some Arkansas units being mislabeled as Missouri units. Troops living near the borders with other states often enlisted in the nearest unit, even if across the state line, resulting in Arkansas soldiers enlisting in units from Missouri, Louisiana and Tennessee.  The following is a list of Missouri units that contained large numbers of Arkansas soldiers:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Regiment !! Organization Date !! Commanders !!
