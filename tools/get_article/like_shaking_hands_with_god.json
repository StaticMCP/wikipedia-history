It was published in 1999. The first conversation occurred on October 1, 1998, at a book store on Union Square in Manhattan, and the second occurred the following evening at a cafe.\nLike Shaking Hands With God was meant to be a conversation about writing but turned into much more. As The Hartford Advocate said, it is \"...a book that is more about being than writing.\" In Like Shaking Hands With God the authors touch on the subject of writing, how to write, how a writer should view their audience and what the ultimate goal of writing should be.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Like Shaking Hands With God\n\n#REDIRECT Like Shaking Hands with God"
