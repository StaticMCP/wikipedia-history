Ward Centers serves as a retail hub for multiple shopping centers, including Ward Centre, Ward Village Shops, and the Ward Entertainment Center, a multimillion-dollar 150,000 square foot (14,000 m2) entertainment center. Notable tenants of the entertainment center include a theater complex owned by Consolidated Theatres and Dave and Busters, which is expected to shut down in 2025.\nRedevelopment in the Ward Centers\nThe Howard Hughes Corporation has planned to redevelop most of the Ward Centers by building condo towers, more retail, and will eventually have a Skyline Station. They already have transformed the Ward Centers such as the redevelopment of the Ward Warehouse, Ward Gateway center, Ward Farmers Market/Marukai and soon Ward Centre. They are already expected to complete the transformation later in the 2020s.\nChanges seen in the Ward Centers (Ward Village)\nIn 2016, the old Pier 1 Imports was demolished to make way for Anaha. In 2017, the Office Depot/Nordstrom Rack anchored building was demolished to make way for Aeo/Whole Foods. In late 2017, the Ward Warehouse building, built in the 1970s, was mostly demolished to make way for Gateway Towers. At the same time, The Marukai Ward store and surrounding warehouses was shut down and was demolished to make way for the public Victoria Ward park, and the A'alii, Kōʻula, and The Park Ward Village condos. In 2019, the Ward Plaza was demolished to make way for The Launiu. In 2021, The Ward Gateway center was demolished to make way for The Park Ward Village, Mahana, and the future Skyline Station. In 2024; the Ward Warehouse parking garage was finally demolished to make way for Kalae. The Ward Centre, built in the 1980s, will be demolished to make way for Melia and Ilima. The date is currently to be determined.\nEarly history\nVictoria Ward was the wife of Honolulu industrialist Curtis Perry Ward and daughter of influential British shipbuilder James Robinson. Victoria Ward and her husband owned a vast estate (over 100 acres) in central Honolulu that stretched from Thomas Square to the shores of Ala Moana. On the estate was their mansion, Old Plantation, the site of the present-day Neal S. Blaisdell Center. In 1882, Curtis Perry Ward died and left his holdings to his wife and daughters. Victoria Ward continued the family business, purchasing real estate which would be developed for commercial use.\nWard Village\nWard Village (Formerly Victoria Ward Limited) acts as the owner and operator of Ward Centers; it is owned under The Howard Hughes Corporation. The company owns approximately 65 acres in Honolulu, including the Ward Entertainment Center, Ward Centre, Village Shops, and current condo developments.\nReferences"
