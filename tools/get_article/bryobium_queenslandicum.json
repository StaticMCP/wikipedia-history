This orchid only occurs in tropical North Queensland.\nDescription\nBryobium queenslandicum is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb that forms dense clumps with crowded, cylindrical pseudobulbs  long and  wide. Each pseudobulb has two lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves  long and  wide. Between three and twelve cream-coloured or pinkish, resupinate flowers about  long and wide are arranged on a flowering stem  long. The flowers are cup-shaped, self-pollinating and hairy on the outside. The sepal and petals are about  long and  wide. The labellum is about  long and  wide with three lobes. The side lobes are erect and the middle lobe turns downward with two ridges near the base. Flowering occurs from August to October.\nTaxonomy and naming\nThe dingy urchin orchid was first formally described in 1948 by Trevor Edgar Hunt who gave it the name Eria queenslandica and published the description in The North Queensland Naturalist. The type specimen was collected by John Henry Wilkie who collected in on Mount Bellenden Ker. In 2002 Mark Clements and David Jones changed the name to Bryobium queenslandicum.\nDistribution and habitat\nBryobium queenslandicum grows on trees and rocks in rainforest between the McIlwraith Range and the Tully River.\nReferences"
