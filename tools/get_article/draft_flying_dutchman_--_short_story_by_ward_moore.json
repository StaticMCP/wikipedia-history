The servicing process is entirely automated using radio receivers and \"electronic impulses\" to operate refueling hoses, lubricating equipment, gas pumps, and other devices; no humans are present. While the control room clock and air conditioning work fine, the automatic calendar display appears to be stuck, always showing November 1998. The fueling process uses an integrated system by which the fueling of the airplane triggers a pump to refill the gas reservoir, a refinery to \"come to life\" to produce gasoline from crude oil and an oil rig to begin drilling for oil thousands of miles away. We learn that the \"grave men\" who created the war strategy had planned for all \"foreseeable eventualities\" to make sure that their automated \"push button war\" would continue on until victory, even if the devastation of war caused civilians to \"cower and chatter\" and lose resolve to continue the war.\nThe story ends with the Flying Dutchman taking off on route to an enemy country \"whose armies had been defeated and whose people had perished.\" Though the automated bomber plane flies on with \"outstretched wings and steady motors\", the Earth below it has lacked any living things for a long time and become a dead planet.\nThemes\nThe title \"Flying Dutchman\" is a reference to a legendary ghost ship that is doomed to sail forever and never reach port, the sight of which serves as an omen of doom. The story opposes the strategic interaction of reason and technology with natural human feelings and reactions, and suggests that lack of humane control over the implementation of technologies can automate and virtually mandate inevitable catastrophe. The setting of the story emphasizes darkness as the condition in which technology does its work by showing the complete darkness of the airport's automated control room, which would possibly perceive a human being as an \"intruder\" while using blackout curtains to eliminate the entrance of elements of the natural world, such as \"betraying moonbeams\". Maintaining this association of technology with darkness, the landing of the Flying Dutchman takes place on an unlit runway in the middle of the night, allowing the story to combine the pairing of technology and darkness with the danger of disembodied reason, as the airplane's landing is guided by equipment using \"precise mathematical calculation\", free of \"human perceptions and reactions\". The automated technology has been intentionally designed to circumvent the intervention of human emotion or perception, which might, during the terror of wartime, object to and bring to an end the devastation of war. The opposition of technology and humanity becomes complete as the story describes the technology itself as \"a creation of man no longer dependent on its creator\". At the story's end, this opposition of technology and humanity extends to include nature, as the Earth is seen from the perspective of the high-flying bomber, and the formerly organic \"bulge of the Earth\" appears merely as the geometric \"curving line\" of a long-dead planet.\nIn its presentation of human technologies continuing in the absence of human beings after nuclear disaster, the story is similar to the short story, \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" by Ray Bradbury, though \"The Flying Dutchman\" focuses on military technology while Bradbury's story deals with an automated home. For context, the first publication of \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" came just months before that of \"The Flying Dutchman\", and both stories appear in the Adventures in Tomorrow anthology in 1951.\nReferences\nExternal Links\n[https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?74284 Flying Dutchman] title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database"
