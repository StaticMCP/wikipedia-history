They are presented by the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences of Spain.\nThe first ceremony was held in 1987, a year after the founding of the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences, at the Teatro Lope de Vega in Madrid. They have since been also held in other Spanish cities (Barcelona, Seville, Málaga, Valencia, Valladolid, and Granada).\nHistory\nTo reward the best Spanish films of each year, the Spanish Academy of Motion Pictures and Arts decided to create the Goya Awards. The Goya Awards are Spain's main national film awards, considered by many in Spain, and internationally, to be the Spanish equivalent of the American Academy Awards. The inaugural ceremony took place on March 17, 1987, at the Lope de Vega theatre in Madrid. From the 2nd edition until 1995, the awards were held at the Palacio de Congresos in the Paseo de la Castellana. Then they moved to the similarly named Palacio Municipal de Congresos, also in Madrid. In 2000, the ceremony took place in Barcelona, at the Barcelona Auditorium. In 2003, a large number of film professionals took advantage of the Goya awards ceremony to express their opposition to the Aznar's government support of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In 2004, the AVT (an association against terrorism in Spain) demonstrated against terrorism and ETA, a paramilitary organization of Basque separatists, in front of the Lope de Vega theatre. In 2005, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was the first prime minister in the history of Spain to attend the event. In 2013, the minister of culture and education José Ignacio Wert did not attend, saying he had “other things to do”. Some actors said that this decision reflected the government's lack of respect for their profession and industry. The 2019 and 2023 editions of the awards took place in Seville, and in 2020 and 2021 in Málaga.\nTrophy sculpture\nThe award itself is a small bronze bust of Francisco Goya created by the sculptor José Luis Fernández, although the original sculpture for the first edition of the Goyas was by Miguel Ortiz Berrocal. The trophy sculpture is informally known as  (plural: ), 'bighead'.\nAwards\nThe awards are currently delivered in 28 categories, excluding the Honorary Goya Award and the International Goya Award, with an increase of up to five nominees per category established for the upcoming 37th edition. There was a maximum of four candidates for each from the 13th Edition (having been three candidates in the first edition, five in the 2nd and 3rd edition and three from the fourth to the twelfth edition) to the 36th edition.\n* Best Film\n* Best Director\n* Best Leading Actor\n* Best Leading Actress\n* Best Original Screenplay\n* Best Adapted Screenplay\n* Best New Director\n* Best Supporting Actor\n* Best Supporting Actress\n* Best New Actor\n* Best New Actress\n* Best Production Supervision\n* Best Cinematography\n* Best Editing\n* Best Original Score\n* Best Original Song\n* Best Art Direction\n* Best Costume Design\n* Best Makeup and Hairstyles\n* Best Sound\n* Best Special Effects\n* Best Animated Film\n* Best Animated Short Film\n* Best Documentary Short Film\n* Best Fictional Short Film\n* Best European Film\n* Best Documentary\n* Best Ibero-American Film\n* Honorary Goya Award\n* International Goya Award\nAward ceremonies\nThe following is a listing of all Goya Awards ceremonies since 1986.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable sticky-header\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!
