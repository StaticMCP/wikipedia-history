Edward Russell until 1694. He married Francis Lloyd, a widow, in 1688. They had no children.\nEdward Russell was son of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford (1616–1700). Edward was educated privately and at the University of Padua. At the time of the 1st Duke's death, Edward was the oldest surviving son, but the dukedom passed instead to Edward's nephew, the young Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford. This was because Wriothesley was the son of Edward's elder brother William Russell, Lord Russell.\nEdward Russell represented Tavistock in Parliament from 13 February 1679 to 23 March 1683. Russell was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Caernarvonshire in 1689 at the Glorious Revolution, and was Treasurer of the Chamber from 1694 to 1702. He was briefly the Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire, Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex, and Custos Rotulorum of Middlesex from 1700 until 1701, when his nephew Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford reached his majority and assumed those offices.\nReferences\n|-\n|-"
