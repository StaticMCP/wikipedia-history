It used the Avco Mark 4 reentry vehicle.\nThe W38 was 32 inches (81&nbsp;cm) in diameter and 82.5 inches (2&nbsp;m) long. It weighed  and had a design yield of 3.75 megatons with an airburst or contact fuze.\nThe W38 was the first thermonuclear ICBM warhead developed by the UCRL (University of California Radiation Laboratory), which is now known as the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\nThe W38 was superseded by the Titan II missile family with a W53 warhead and 9 megaton payload.\nSee also\n* List of nuclear weapons\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html List of all US nuclear weapons]"
