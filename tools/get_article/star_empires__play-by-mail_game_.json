Designed and published by Geoff Squibb in 1984 in the United Kingdom, the game was hand-moderated for the first year, later transitioning to computer moderation. Spellbinder Games in the UK later ran the game under license. Later versions included Star Empires II and Star Empires III. Players began with a colony and minimal resources and technology, expanding through exploration within a galaxy of 44,688 sectors. The game received generally positive reviews in Flagship in the 1980s and 1990s. Star Empires III was still active as of 2002.\nHistory and development\nStar Empires was a play-by-mail space opera. Designed by Geoff Squibb, the game was open-ended. Its first galaxy opened for gameplay in 1984. A second galaxy opened in August 1985. The game was initially published by Geoff Squibb who hand moderated the game (early turn results were hand-written). By 1985, turn results were generated by computer.\nBy 1996, an updated version, Star Empires II, was being developed and run by both Squibb and Spellbinder Games, the latter under license. Both were based in the United Kingdom. In 1998, Squibb announced his intent to launch Star Empires III. This version was still active as of 2002.\nGameplay\nPlayers led a colony with minimal resources and technology. The two-dimensional game map of the galaxy comprised 44,688 sectors. Galaxies included 30–40 player characters and various non-player elements. Exploration was central to successful early play. Early strategies included a focus on military power versus a focus on technology development.\nReception\nWilfrid Nixon reviewed the game in the Autumn 1985 issue of Flagship stating, \"If you'd like to try a game that doesn't need a degree in mathematics or accounting. yet poses some very subtle problems, and if like me you are a Sci-Fi nut, then you could do worse than give it a try.\" Simon Bracegirdle reviewed the game in a 1996 issue of Flagship, saying that it was \"an excellent game\" and that he was \"hooked\". He stated, \"If you relish a challenge and are prepared to invest time and effort in a game of some depth then Star Empires is probably exactly what you are after.\" Space Empires II placed first in the Space Opera Category  in ''Flagship's'' July–August 1998 PBM game ratings.\nSee also\n* List of play-by-mail games\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*"
