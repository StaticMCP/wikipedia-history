It emerged within the context of Chicago house music in the 1980s.\nOrigins and interpretations\nThe style is said to have developed in Chicago nightclubs like the Warehouse and the Power Plant, where house pioneer Frankie Knuckles was resident DJ, and Ron Hardy's Music Box, during the early 1980s.\nMusic journalist Simon Reynolds has argued that just as house music evolved from disco music (among other influences – see House music), jacking evolved from the expressiveness of disco dancing. Even more than disco, house music endorsed an “abandonment of subjectivity and self-will”, promoting the “ecstasy of being enthralled by the beat”. He sees jacking as a reflection of this abandonment of subjectivity:\nA similar account on the sexual content of jacking was suggested by Barry Walters in his 1986 article on house music in SPIN magazine:\nDJ and record producer Chip E. also explains the body movements in jacking with a reference to sexuality:\n\"Jackin' house\" as a style of music\nThe terms \"jacking\", \"jackin'\", or \"jack\" found their way into numerous titles of early house music records, such as the Jack Trax EP by Chip E. (1985), \"Jack'n the House\" (1985) by Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk (1985), \"Jack Your Body\" by Steve \"Silk\" Hurley (1986), \"The Jack That House Built\" by Jack 'n' Chill (1987), or \"Jack to the Sound of the Underground\" by Hithouse (1988).\nThe term is also transferred to certain styles of house music called \"jackin' house\".\nSee also\n* House dance\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cambridge.org/core/Services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A243FA2CF22949B6B44F1AB6BDDA49CB/S0149767700006446a.pdf/cmon_to_my_house_undergroundhouse_dancing.pdf Sally R.
