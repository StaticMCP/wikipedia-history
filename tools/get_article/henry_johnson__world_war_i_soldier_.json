On watch in the Argonne Forest on May 14, 1918, he fought off a German raid in hand-to-hand combat, killing multiple German soldiers and rescuing a fellow soldier while suffering 21 wounds, in an action that was brought to the nation's attention by coverage in the New York World and The Saturday Evening Post later that year. On June 2, 2015, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House.\nIn 1918, the French awarded Johnson with a Croix de guerre with star and bronze palm.\nJohnson died poor and in obscurity in 1929. There was a long struggle to achieve awards for him from the U.S. military. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart in 1996. In 2002, the U.S. military awarded him the Distinguished Service Cross. Previous efforts to secure the Medal of Honor failed, but in 2015 he was posthumously honored with the award. On May 24, 2022, The Naming Commission recommended that Fort Polk in Leesville, Louisiana, be renamed Fort Johnson after Henry Johnson, rather than its previous namesake, Confederate General Leonidas Polk. The post was renamed in Johnson's honor on June 5, 2023; the name change was reversed on June 20, 2025.\nEarly life and education\nJohnson stated that he was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on July 15, 1892, when registered for the World War I draft, but he used other dates on other documents and may not have known the exact date of his birth. He moved to Albany, New York when he was in his early teens and worked various jobs, such as a chauffeur, soda mixer, and as a redcap porter at the Albany Union Station on Broadway.\nMilitary career\n, 1943.]]\nHenry Johnson enlisted in the United States Armed Forces on June 5, 1917 as a 5-foot-4-inch young man. This was almost two months after the American entry into World War I, joining the all-black New York National Guard 15th Infantry Regiment, which, when mustered into Federal service, was redesignated as the 369th Infantry Regiment, and was then based in Harlem. The 369th Infantry joined the 185th Infantry Brigade upon arrival in France, but was relegated to labor service duties instead of combat training. The 185th Infantry Brigade was in turn assigned on January 5, 1918, to the 93rd Infantry Division.\n. Two wound chevrons can be seen on his lower right sleeve.]]\nAlthough General John J. Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) on the Western Front, wished to keep the American forces autonomous, he \"loaned\" the 369th to the 161st Division of the French Army. Supposedly, the unreported and unofficial reason he was willing to detach the African-American regiments from U.S. command was that vocal white U.S. soldiers refused to fight alongside black troops. These black regiments suffered considerable harassment by white U.S. soldiers and even denigration by the AEF headquarters, which went so far as to release the notorious pamphlet Secret Information Concerning Black American Troops, which \"warned\" French civilian authorities of the alleged inferior nature and supposed tendencies of African-American troops to commit sexual assaults. Johnson arrived in France on New Year's Day, 1918.\nThe French Army needed more men and welcomed the reinforcements. The 369th Infantry regiment, later nicknamed the \"Harlem Hellfighters\", was among the first to arrive in France, and among the most highly decorated when it returned. The 369th was an all-black unit under the command of mostly white officers, including their commander, Colonel William Hayward. The idea of a black New York National Guard regiment had first been put forward by Charles W. Fillmore, a black New Yorker. Governor Charles Seymour Whitman, inspired by the brave showing of the black 10th Cavalry in Mexico, authorized the project. He appointed Colonel Hayward to carry out the task of organizing the unit, and Hayward gave Fillmore a commission as a captain in the 15th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard. The 15th New York Infantry Regiment became the 369th United States Infantry Regiment prior to engaging in combat in France.\nThe 369th got off to a rocky departure from the United States, making three attempts over a period of months to sail for France before finally getting out of sight of land. Even then, their transport, which had stopped and anchored before it could get out of the harbor due to a sudden snowstorm, was struck by another ship due to poor visibility. The captain of the transport, the Pocahontas, wanted to turn back, much to the dismay of his passengers. The by-now angry and impatient members of the 369th, led by Hayward, took a very dim view of any further delay. Since damage to the ship was well above the waterline, the ship's captain admitted that there was no danger of sinking. Hayward then informed the captain that he saw no reason to turn back, aside from cowardice. Hayward's men repaired the damage themselves and the ship sailed on. According to Hayward's notes, they \"landed at Brest. Right side up\" on December 27, 1917. They acquitted themselves well once they finally got to France. Many months were to pass by, however, before they were to see combat.\nThe French Army assigned Johnson's regiment to Outpost 20 on the edge of the Argonne Forest in the Champagne region of France, equipping it with French rifles and helmets. While on observation post duty on the night of May 14, 1918, Johnson came under attack by a large German raiding party, which may have numbered up to 36 soldiers. Using grenades, the butt of his rifle, a bolo knife and his bare fists, Johnson repelled the Germans, killing four while wounding others, rescuing Needham Roberts from capture and saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. Johnson suffered 21 wounds during the ordeal. This act of valor earned him the nickname of \"Black Death\", as a sign of respect for his prowess in combat.\nThe story of Johnson's exploits first came to national attention in an article by Irvin S. Cobb entitled \"Young Black Joe\" published in the August 24, 1918 Saturday Evening Post.\nReturning home, now-Sergeant Johnson participated (with his regiment) in a victory parade on Fifth Avenue in New York City in February 1919. Johnson was then paid to take part in a series of lecture tours. He appeared one evening in St. Louis, and instead of delivering the expected tale of racial harmony in the trenches, revealed the abuse that black soldiers had suffered, such as white soldiers refusing to share trenches with blacks. Soon afterwards, a warrant was issued for Johnson's arrest for violating the regulations governing wearing his uniform (beyond the prescribed date of his commission). Paid lecturing engagements dried up.\nMilitary awards\nThe French government awarded Johnson the Croix de guerre with a special citation and a golden palm.\nIn June 1996, Johnson was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart by President Bill Clinton. In February 2003, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's second highest award, was awarded to Johnson. John Howe, a Vietnam War veteran who had campaigned tirelessly for recognition for Johnson, and U.S. Army Major General Nathaniel James, President of the 369th Veterans' Association, were present at the ceremony in Albany. The award was received by Herman A. Johnson, one of the Tuskegee Airmen of WWII, on behalf of Henry Johnson, then believed to be his father; the mistake was not clarified until 2015, a decade after the younger Johnson's death, as part of the further research done leading up to the senior Johnson's Medal of Honor.\nMedal of Honor\nOn May 14, 2015, the White House announced that Johnson would receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, presented by President Barack Obama. In the ceremony, held on 2 June 2015, Johnson's medal was received on his behalf by Command Sergeant Major Louis Wilson of the New York National Guard. Obama said, \"The least we can do is to say, 'We know who you are. We know what you did for us. We are forever grateful.'\"\nThe official citation reads:\nLater life and death\nVeterans Affairs records show that a \"permanent and total disability\" rating was granted to Johnson on September 16, 1927, as a result of his tuberculosis infection. Additionally, Johnson suffered approximately 21 different combat injuries, rendering him unable to return to his previous job as a porter. Also, Veterans Affairs records refer to Johnson receiving monthly compensation and regular visits by Veterans Affairs medical personnel until his death.\nJohnson died on July 1, 1929, in Washington, D.C., of myocarditis. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on July 6, 1929.\nLegacy\nIn 1919, co-founder of the American Legion Theodore Roosevelt Jr., son of former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, referred to Johnson as one of the \"five bravest Americans\" to have served in World War I.\nInterest in obtaining fitting recognition for Johnson grew during the 1970s and 1980s. In November 1991, a monument was erected in Albany, New York's Washington Park in his honor, and a section of Northern Boulevard was renamed Henry Johnson Boulevard.\nIn December 2004, the Postal facility at 747 Broadway was renamed the \"United States Postal Service Henry Johnson Annex\".\nOn September 4, 2007, the Brighter Choice Foundation in Albany, New York, dedicated the Henry Johnson Charter School, with Johnson's granddaughter in attendance.\nA 1918 commercial poster honoring Johnson's wartime heroics was the subject of a 2012 episode of the PBS television series History Detectives.\nAs of December 3, 2014, the national defense bill included a provision, added by Senator Chuck Schumer, to award Johnson the Medal of Honor.\nFor many years, it was thought that Herman Archibald Johnson was the son of Henry Johnson. In tracking Henry Johnson's genealogy prior to his being awarded the Medal of Honor, however, it was discovered that there was no family connection. The Army was quoted as saying, \"While we appreciate the Johnson family fighting for the award and keeping the memory and valorous acts of Henry Johnson alive, we regretfully cannot recognize them as PNOK,\" or primary next of kin.\nIn December 2014, the City School District of Albany established a Junior Reserve officers' Training Program (JROTC) at Albany High School named the Henry Johnson Battalion in honor of him. The program currently enrolls over 100 cadets.\nIn 2017, Albany-area PBS station WMHT aired a documentary about Henry Johnson entitled Henry Johnson: A Tale of Courage.\nJohnson's story is recounted in the song ''Don't Tread on Me (Harlem Hellfighters) by the Ukrainian death metal band 1914 on their album Where Fear and Weapons Meet'', released October 22, 2021.\nIn June 2023, Fort Polk in Louisiana, a U.S. Army base, was renamed for Johnson.\nIn 2025, Macho Goat Productions, finished a featured film entitled “The Battle of Henry Johnson”. The movie represents the battle in real time, as well as, moments of his life with flashbacks.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
