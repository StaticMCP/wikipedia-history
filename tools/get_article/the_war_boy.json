At times life appears to go on as normal: Jan plays with his dog and has a good relationship with his father Stephan (Kenneth Welsh). But after all a war is on, and with an occupation come midnight raids and violence in the form of street shootings and exploding mortar shells.\nJan's father helps a Jewish family stay in hiding, but also houses an SS officer (Slobodan Dimitrijević) passing through the town. Jan, who has already lost his mother, fears his father may ultimately not survive the war. His stepmother Maria (Helen Shaver) treats him with disdain, and flirts with the German officer. Like his father, Jan defies the Nazis by helping the Jews escape, but is also affected by the sight of wounded German soldiers passing by his home.\nJan's character is tempered by these events like \"the making of a fine sword\"; the boy will become a man ready to \"forge his future in a country without fear and hate.\"\nCast\n• Russian soldier/Soldier\n*Derrick Hart • Grandpa (George)\n*Slobodan Dimitrijević • SS Captain\n*Zlatko Pokupec\t• Circus leader(credited as Zlatko \"Pinky\" Pokupec)\n*Ðani Šegina • Matthew\n*Mustafa Nadarević • Mill manager\n*Semka Sokolović • Kati\n*Vida Jerman • Anton's mom\n* • Pityu (credited as Dado Habazin)\n*Ivan Nitikin • Clown\n*Zvonimir Ilijić • Hotel clerk (credited as Zvonko Ilijić)\n*Milan Balic • Maria's lover\n*Tom Stojkovic  • Russian officer (credited as Toni Stojkovic)\n*Demeter Bitenc • Arrow Cross officer (credited as Demetar Bitenc)\n*Sajo • Toby\n}}\nIn addition, various soldiers were played by Ilija Ivezić and Damir Mejovšek.\nVoice performers: Mary Beth Rubens, Peter Jobin, Michael Kirby, Jeff Pustil, and Robyn Jaffe.\nThemes\nThe War Boy has been compared to the \"similarly themed\" Empire of the Sun, a 1987 film by Steven Spielberg which also depicts \"a child's eye view of the horrors of war.\"\nProduction\nBackground and financing\nAfter making his first feature, A Sweeter Song (1976), Allan Eastman directed around a hundred television productions before undertaking a second feature, which was made with the support of Telefilm Canada.\nFilming\nThe film's working title was Point of Escape. Unlike A Sweeter Song, which was shot on 16mm film, The War Boy was shot on 35mm (Kodak 5247 and 5294). Principal photography took place in Zagreb, Croatia (then part of Yugoslavia) from 24 September to 28 October 1984.\nRelease and reception\nThe War Boy was released in 1985 and distributed by  Norstar Releasing, Peter Simpson's recently created (1984) Canadian independent distribution company.\nHome media\nThe War Boy was released on VHS, Betamax, and DVD.\nIn 2007, The War Boy was released as part of a war film anthology DVD box set of five discs by Eclectic called the ''Dogs o' War Collection, featuring ten films predominantly by Italian directors, prompting Chadwick Jenkins to call them \"Spaghetti War Flicks\" after Spaghetti Westerns.\nCritical response\nJenkins praises The War Boy'', saying it \"beautifully captures the contradictions of wartime and the devastating nature of simply living and growing up in such times.\" His only criticism of the film is that the \"News on the March\" opening sequence is undermined \"by having the credits roll over the newsreel.\" The film is \"unjustly underrated\", and when compared with Spielberg's big-budget Empire of the Sun (1987), is arguably \"more successful on an intimate, personal level in depicting a child's eye view of the horrors of war.\" Terry Rowan calls Jason Hopely's novice performance \"beautiful\", as does ''VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, which assigns the film 2.5 stars.\nThe Great Canadian Movie Guide, by sharp contrast, derides The War Boy as \"choppy and confusingly disjointed\", \"with somewhat stilted performances and dialogue\" and fails to develop most characters and scenes, or even the idea that the children were born in Canada.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090290/ The War Boy]'' on IMDb"
