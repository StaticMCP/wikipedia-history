Though an amateur historian, the radio presenter and one-time comedy star handles this dauntingly complex material with dexterity.\", noted \"That's not to say there isn't a fair amount of breezy surface narration and a number of subjects that seem ticked off rather than explored.\", and concluded \"Fidler's story ... leaves its readers with a sense of faith in the renewing, illuminating, social powers of historical narrative.\"\nThe Canberra Times wrote \"In the book, Fidler evokes the clash of civilisations, the fall of empires, the rise of Christianity and the knock-on effects throughout civilisation when Constantinople fell and became Istanbul. But he tells them in the context of sharing his discoveries with his son – a poignant chapter of family life.\" and The Australian called it an \"extraordinarily ambitious book\"\nLes Carlyon named it one of his best reads of 2016.\nGhost Empire has also been reviewed by Kirkus Reviews. and Publishers Weekly,\nIt achieved the shortlists of the 2017 Australian Indie Book Award, and the 2017 Australian Booksellers Association Nielsen BookData Booksellers Choice Award.\nReferences"
