The squadron initially operated the supersonic F-5E/F Tiger II fighter aircraft, but has been operating the locally modified & improved F-5S/T Tiger-IIs fighter aircraft since the early 1990s, these were retrofitted with new state-of-the-art avionics giving the aircraft capability of carrying out both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.\n144 Squadron has since been disbanded after the retirement of the F-5S/T Tiger-IIs in September 2015.\nAchievements\nThe squadron clinched the coveted Best Fighter Squadron award (Singapore Armed Forces Best Unit Competition) in 1995, 2005, 2009, and 2015. It first won the title in 1995.\nIt is regarded by many as the best fighter squadron in the RSAF, having dominated many local and international exercises. Operating the oldest fighter platform in the RSAF ORBAT requires superior skills, capability and professionalism, thus the squadron handpicks the top pilot graduates to join the team.\nMascot\nThe Blackite is 144 Squadron's adopted mascot. The Squadron's “Dare to Excel” motto amplifies the Blackite character; a mysterious bird that is unpredictable and deadly, but strikes her prey with precision and readiness at all times. Coupled with team excellence, perseverance, dedication and professionalism, the men and women of 144 Squadron Team Blackites do “Dare to Excel”.\nAircraft operated\n* 15 F-5S Tiger IIs\n* 7 F-5T Tiger IIs\nLatest photo\nFile:RSAF F-5 preparing to take off.jpg|An F-5S of 144 Squadron preparing for take-off.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080906140801/https://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/mindef_websites/atozlistings/air_force/assets/airbases_and_squadrons/Paya_Lebar_Air_Base.html RSAF web page on 144 Squadron & Paya Lebar Air Base (PLAB)]"
