Old prints of West Point show this monument located on a knoll near the flag pole. The monument was once used as a navigational aid for ships making the passage down the Hudson River.\nEleazer Wood\nEleazer D. Wood (1783 – September 17, 1814) was born in Lunenburg, Massachusetts.  Wood was one of the earliest graduates of the U.S. Military Academy, becoming the 17th graduate of the academy in 1806. He was well known among the army officer corps as an engineer and artillery officer.  He built Fort Meigs in Ohio as well as other fortifications. Fort Wood, an early 19th-century star-shaped fortification on Bedloe's Island (named after Isaac Bedloo), now called Liberty Island, was named in his honor,  as is Wood County, Ohio.\nHistory of the monument\nAt the conclusion of the War of 1812, Major General Jacob Brown contacted Colonel Sylvanus Thayer, Superintendent of the Military Academy, and ordered the monument's construction at West Point at his own expense.  The monument is a four-sided obelisk approximately  tall.  Erected in 1818, it was once prominently located near the site of present-day Trophy Point.  As the academy expanded, the monument was moved to the cemetery in 1885, where it is located next to the graves of the Warner sisters, Susan and Anna.  Its dedication in 1818 makes it the oldest monument at the academy.\nImage:The Plain at West Point in 1828.jpg|Wood's monument depicted in an 1828 painting\nReferences\n}}"
