It is based on the concept of data-processing modules linked into a network. Modules can perform complex audio signal analysis, transformations and synthesis. CLAM also provides a uniform interface to common tasks within audio applications, such as accessing audio devices and audio files. CLAM serves as a library for C++ application development, but a graphical interface also allows full applications to be built without coding. It won the 2006 ACM Multimedia Open Source Competition.\nReferences"
