      "text": "# List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Indian Wars\n\nThe Indian Wars is the name used by the United States government to describe a series of military conflicts between the United States and Indigenous peoples from 1776 to 1898.\nMedal of Honor\nThe Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. Receiving the award did not originally require that the recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States; that language was added later.\nDue to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously.\nA\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Image !!
