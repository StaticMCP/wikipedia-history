Because the battle was a running battle that extended over many hours and  of roads, the battlefield is more than  in size, extending in all directions around Cane Hill.  The northern section of the battlefield is an agricultural area that is little-altered except for the introduction of new roadways and rural buildings, and the abandonment of old roadway alignments.  The southern section is hillier and more wooded, and is altered in similar ways.\nThe battlefield area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas\nReferences"
