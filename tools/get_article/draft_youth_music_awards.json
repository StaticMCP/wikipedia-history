Held at The Troxy in London, the awards aim to promote diversity and inclusivity in the music industry by recognizing the achievements of young people from diverse backgrounds. The awards were first held in October 2019 and have been presented annually since, with the 2025 edition marking the seventh year of the event.\nHistory\nThe Youth Music Awards were established in 2019 by Youth Music, a UK-based charity that supports music-making projects for young people. The awards were created to highlight the talent and leadership of young musicians, producers, and leaders who have participated in Youth Music-funded initiatives. The inaugural event took place in October 2019 at The Troxy, a historic venue in London, and has since become an annual celebration of young talent in the music industry.\nThe awards have been held every year since their inception, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the 2020 and 2021 events were adapted to virtual and hybrid formats. As of 2025, the awards are in their seventh year, with the 2025 edition scheduled to take place later in the year.\nCategories\nThe Youth Music Awards feature a range of categories that recognize various aspects of music-making, leadership, and community impact.

Entrants can nominate themselves or others, provided they meet the eligibility criteria. Submissions are made through the Award Force platform, and a panel of music industry professionals judges the entries.\nThe judging panel typically includes notable figures from the music industry, such as musicians, producers, and executives. Past judges have included Fleur East, Joy Crookes, and members of the electronic duo Bicep.\nNotable Winners and Nominees\nThe Youth Music Awards have recognized a diverse range of talent, with several winners going on to achieve significant success in the music industry. Notable winners include:\n* English Teacher: A Leeds-based indie band that won the Rising Star Award (Artist) in 2022. The band later won the 2024 Mercury Prize for their debut album This Could Be Texas.\n* EVA: A Brighton-based musician who won three awards in 2023: Rising Star Award (Artist), Music Video Award, and Live Performance Award. EVA has since performed at major festivals and received support from artists like Fatboy Slim.\n* James Jones: Winner of the Music Producer Award in 2023 for his jazz-infused track \"Coconut Beach,\" presented by Bicep.\n* Ni Maxine: Winner of the Original Track Award (Solo) in 2023 for her song \"Strange Love,\" which explores themes of self-love and identity.\n* David Coke: Winner of the Young Leader Award in 2023 for his work with Heart n Soul, a creative arts charity supporting people with learning disabilities.\nNotable nominees include:\n* Beacons Cymru: Nominated for the Outstanding Project Award in 2023 for their work on the Forté Project, a Wales-wide music development initiative.\n* AutismAble and Future Collaborations: Winners of the Outstanding Project Award in 2023 for their inclusive music-making project uniting neurodivergent and neurotypical young people.\nImpact\nThe Youth Music Awards have had a significant impact on the careers of many winners and nominees, serving as a launchpad for further success in the music industry. For example, English Teacher’s win in 2022 led to a major label deal and performances at prominent festivals, while Sans Soucis, a 2021 winner, signed with Decca Records and performed at South by Southwest (SXSW).\nBeyond individual careers, the awards also highlight the importance of community and social action in music. Projects like AutismAble’s Future Collaborations, which won the Outstanding Project Award in 2023, have made significant contributions to inclusivity by providing music-making opportunities for neurodivergent youth and enhancing accessibility in the industry.\nThe awards are supported by various sponsors, including Hal Leonard Europe, Amazon Music, YouTube, and Levi's, which provide financial and promotional backing to the event.\nReferences"
