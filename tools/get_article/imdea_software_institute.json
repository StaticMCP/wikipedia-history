It focuses on producing the science and technology necessary to ensure that software systems are safe, reliable, and efficient. It was established in 2006 by the Madrid Regional Government, as part of the Madrid Institutes for Advanced Studies (IMDEA) initiative and is located at the Montegancedo Campus of the Polytechnic University of Madrid.\nHistory\nThe  institute was established as one of the seven IMDEA institutes by the Madrid Regional Government in 2006 to enhance scientific research and technological innovation in the region. It is legally constituted as an independent, non-profit foundation.\nIn 2025, the IMDEA Software Institute received the María de Maeztu accreditation, recognizing it as a Unit of Excellence in Research.\nResearch\nThe IMDEA Software Institute focuses on advancing the science and technology needed to develop high-quality, reliable, secure, and efficient software. Its research is primarily concentrated on three areas:\n* Logic and Verification: This area develops frameworks and tools to ensure software correctness in functionality, efficiency, and resource use, crucial for fields like avionics and financial technologies. Research includes verification of concurrent systems and static analysis techniques.\n* Programming Languages and Software Engineering: This research provides tools for creating clear and modular code, focusing on programming languages that express complex properties and techniques to simplify programming. It includes work on type systems, compilation, and AI applications to improve system performance.\n* Security and Cryptography: This area aims to secure computations and data storage in hostile environments, focusing on cryptography, network security, malware analysis, and privacy-enhancing technologies.\nEuropean Research Council (ERC) grants\nThe IMDEA Software Institute has secured several ERC grants:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Project !! Duration !! Funding !! Objective\n|-\n| PICOCRYPT || 2021–2026 || €2 million || Develop cryptographic protocols to ensure privacy and integrity in cloud computing environments. Led by Dario Fiore.\n|-\n| CRETE || 2021–2026 || €1.5 million || Enhance software correctness and security using refinement types. Led by Niki Vazou.\n|-\n| MATHADOR || 2016–2022 || €2 million || Establish mathematical foundations for verifying concurrent software systems. Led by Aleks Nanevski.\n|-\n| RACCOON || 2016–2021 || €1.5 million || Improve the scalability and consistency of distributed cloud databases through formal reasoning techniques. Led by Alexey Gotsman.\n|}\nMadQuantum-CM\nMadQuantum-CM is one of IMDEA Software's key research project. It focuses on  quantum cybersecurity by enhancing secure communications through a scalable quantum key distribution (QKD) network. Led by a consortium including the Technical University of Madrid and IMDEA Software, MadQuantum-CM integrates software-defined networking (SDN) and all-optical switches to dynamically establish quantum links across nine interconnected nodes in the Madrid metropolitan area. This initiative supports a wide range of QKD technologies and protocols, promoting interoperability and the integration of new devices, and setting a blueprint for future quantum communication infrastructures such as the EuroQCI project. The MadQuantum-CM project is part of broader efforts to strengthen Madrid's position in secure quantum communications, with an overall funding of €73 million from the Regional Government of Madrid, the Spanish Government, the European Union, and further supporters.\nGovernance\nThe institute operates as an independent foundation governed by a board of trustees, comprising representatives from academia, industry, and government. A scientific advisory board, consisting of international academics, provides guidance on the institute's scientific strategy and research activities. It is composed of Roberto Di Cosmo, Gustavo Alonso, María Alpuente, Anindya Banerjee, Patrick Cousot, Veronica Dahl, José Meseguer, Luís Moniz Pereira, Catuscia Palamidessi, Marta Patiño, Martin Wirsing, and Andreas Zeller.\nMedia Coverage\nThe institute's research has garnered substantial media attention. Their contributions to safety research in cryptography were covered by The Economist. Additionally, their development of a tool for tracking cybercrime was covered by several major outlets, including COPE. Their quantum communication network was covered by La Vanguardia. Their research on security threats in smart homes has been covered by El País, ElDiario.es, and 20 Minutos. Additionally, research on the economic aspects of cybercrime, specifically the hidden fortunes and overestimations in cybercrime revenue, was highlighted by Eurasia Review, Europa Press, and Madrimasd. The investigation into the use of disposable phone numbers in online frauds was also featured in an article by ADSLZone. Lastly, the hidden riches of cybercrime were explored in detail by Knowridge Science Report and El Mundo.\nSee also\n* IMDEA\n* IMDEA Nanoscience Institute\n* IMDEA Networks Institute\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://software.imdea.org/ IMDEA Software Institute Official Website]\n* [https://www.comunidad.madrid/ Community of Madrid]\n* [https://www.madrimasd.org/ Madri+d]"
