It resulted in a victory for Eric, forcing the dukes to retreat.\nBackground\nOn 19 August, in the midst of his rebellion against the king, Eric XIV, Duke John rode out at the head of ten banners of German and Scottish and eight banners of Swedish cavalry towards Södermanland all while the troops still loyal to the king gradually switched sides and joined the rebels.\nWhen word reached Eric that the rebels had reached Södertälje, and was now on its way towards Stockholm, he quickly organized the troops who were still loyal to him and quickly marched to meet the rebels head on. The forces still loyal to Eric were the Hovfanan, Upplandsfanan, One banner of \"black cavalry\" (Svarta ryttare), Eight ''Fähnlein's'' of cavalry from Finland, Norrland, Dalarna, and Roslagen, Gårdsfanan, and the Life Guards. In total, Eric's army consisted of around 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.\nIt is not unclear how large the rebel army was, but it consisted of nine banners and 15 Fähnlein's, therefore likely larger than Eric's force. However, one historian has claimed that the rebel vanguard consisted of 670 pikemen, 400 cavalry, and 120 handgunners.\n]]\nBattle\nOn 31 August, the two vanguards of the armies clashed at Botkyrka's church. Eric personally led 700 men in an assault against the advanced vanguard of the rebel army, led by Pontus De la Gardie. Eric sent a group of shooters to take up positions behind the churchyard wall and disrrupt the rebel advance. This succeeded, and Eric managed to break into the rebel forces, sword in hand. It was the first time he had personally participated in a battle and he did so bravely.\nAfter the successes of Eric's forces, the rebel vanguard pulled back to the main rebel force, chased by Eric's entire force.\nAftermath\nAfter the successes of Eric's forces, the rebel vanguard pulled back to the main rebel force, chased by Eric's entire force. When the main rebel army saw the retreat, they followed along, retreating backwards without having to fight. The Dukes decided it was best to make a tactical retreat and reorganize their foirces north of Mälaren, and on the way, they captured Gripsholm castle.\nDespite his victory, Eric did not have enough troops to combat the rebels, even if the navy and thousands of cavalrymen was still loyal to him.\nAccording to the historian Dick Harrison, if Eric XIV had followed up his victory at Botkyrka, it is likely that he would have remained on the throne.\nNotes\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*"
