The school opened in the 2007 school year with an initial freshman class of 100 students, and operated within the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.\nAs of the 2019–20 school year, the school had an enrollment of 210 students and 16.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.7:1.

It is part of the Cristo Rey Network of high schools nationwide, the original being Cristo Rey Jesuit High School in Chicago. The president of Christ the King Prep is Fr. Bob Sandoz.  Its founding principal was Kevin P. Cuddihy, the former principal of St. Peter's Preparatory School in Jersey City and former dean of students at Xavier High School in Manhattan.\nFor the 2016–17 school year, the cost per student was $12,835, defrayed through a $7,100 corporate internship and $2,700 in financial assistance provided to all students; the net tuition was $2,700 per student.\nStudents had to complete 40 hours of voluntary service in each of the first two years and 50 hours of service in both junior and senior years. Various retreat opportunities were offered and all students made a retreat in junior year.\nStudent ambassadors were selected to represent the school to the public, and there was an elected student council.\nOn May 7, 2020, the archdiocese announced that \"Cristo Rey Newark High School, a member of the Cristo Rey Network®, also will close due to lack of operational viability, as per a resolution adopted by the school’s Board.\"\nAthletics\nThe Christ the King Knights competed in the Super Essex Conference, following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA).\nSports offered include:\nBoys:\nBasketball,\nbaseball (pending)\nGirls:\nVolleyball,\nsoftball,\ncheerleading, and\nbasketball\nCo-Ed:\nBowling, fencing,\nsoccer,\ntrack & field,\ncross country,\ngolf, and swimming\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Kearney, G.
