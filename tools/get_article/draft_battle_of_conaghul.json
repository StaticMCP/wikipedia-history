The battle took place near Conaghul village in present-day Raichur district, Karnataka, India.\nBackground\nFollowing the fall of Tipu Sultan in 1799, Dhoondia Wagh(also spelled as Dhondia Waug)—formerly a Mysorean commander—escaped captivity and rallied a force of Maratha irregulars, disbanded Mysorean troops, and local insurgents. His growing influence in northern Karnataka posed a threat to British control in the region.\nMajor-General Arthur Wellesley, commanding British and allied forces in the Deccan, was tasked with suppressing Dhoondia’s rebellion. After weeks of pursuit, Wellesley’s cavalry caught up with the rebel force near Conaghul.\nThe Battle\nWellesley led a cavalry force of approximately 1,200, including the 19th Light Dragoons and native horsemen. Dhoondia Wagh’s army was estimated to include over 5,000 cavalry, though many were irregular and poorly coordinated.\nThe British cavalry executed a rapid and disciplined charge, breaking through Dhoondia’s formation. The rebel army was routed, and Dhoondia Wagh was killed in action, reportedly by a British sepoy.\nAftermath\nThe victory at Conaghul effectively ended Dhoondia Wagh’s rebellion and solidified British control over northern Karnataka. The battle also marked one of Arthur Wellesley’s earliest independent field commands, showcasing his tactical decisiveness and leadership—a precursor to his later campaigns in India and Europe.\nWellesley later described the campaign against Dhoondia as a formative experience, and the Battle of Conaghul remains a notable example of cavalry-led tempo warfare in colonial India.\nReferences"
