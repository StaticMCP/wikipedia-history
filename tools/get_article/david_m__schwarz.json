Schwarz (born January 26, 1951) is an American architect. He is the President & CEO of Washington, D.C.–based David M. Schwarz Architects, Inc. and serves as the chairman of the Yale School of Architecture's Dean's Council.\nSchwarz's work focuses primarily on contextual, humanistic design and urbanist planning principles. Schwarz himself has labeled his work, and that of his eponymous firm, as populist and neo-eclectic in style. In 2015, David Schwarz was awarded the University of Notre Dame's Richard H. Driehaus Architecture Prize on March 21, 2015, in Chicago for his work which embodies the highest ideals of traditional and classical architecture in contemporary society, and creates a positive cultural, environmental, and artistic impact.\nEarly life and education\nSchwarz was born in Los Angeles, California. He received his undergraduate degree from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1972 before attending the Yale School of Architecture and earning a Master of Architecture in 1974.\nImmediately following his graduation from Yale, Schwarz interned for noted architects Paul Rudolph, Edward Larrabee Barnes, and former Yale professor Charles Moore.\nCareer\nSchwarz moved to Washington, D.C., and founded David M. Schwarz Architectural Services in 1976. The firm was incorporated in 1978 and renamed David M. Schwarz Architects, Inc in 2008.\nWhile his early career was focused primarily on the renovation of row houses in historic districts of Washington, D.C., such as Adams Morgan, Dupont Circle, and Mount Pleasant, Schwarz has since applied his self-proclaimed populist style to arenas, schools, baseball stadia, performing arts venues, retail districts, healthcare facilities, apartment buildings, and academic campuses across the United States.\nOutreach and philanthropy\nSchwarz was among the first board members of the National Building Museum. During his time on the board of directors he helped create both the Vincent Scully Prize and the National Building Museum Honor Award. He now serves as the jury chairman for the Vincent J. Scully Prize Fund Endowement.\nDavid Schwarz served as the Davenport Visiting Professor at the Yale School of Architecture in the fall of 2008 and taught a fifth-year design studio at The University of Notre Dame in 2010. He is a Sterling Fellow of Yale University.\nNotable works\nFile:Smithcenterlv.jpg|The Smith Center for the Performing Arts in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA\nFile:American_Airlines_Center_(6246886325)_cropped.jpg|American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, USA\nFile:The Ballpark, home of the Texas Rangers major-league baseball team, Arlington, Texas LCCN2011633379.tif|Globe Life Park in Arlington in Arlington, Texas, USA\nFile:Basshall.JPG|Nancy Lee and Perry R.
