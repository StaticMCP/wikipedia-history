Each arm having their own remits.\nTermed \"illegals\", operatives without diplomatic accreditation, agents often spend years building up false identities, living a quiet life, though sometimes they then move location/country with their partner, who may or may not know of their espionage activities and any children, who will not know of any nefarious activities. They can be hard to identify, resembling normal people.\nThe threat of spies has been increasing in Europe, most of which are Russian. \"Counterintelligence efforts to look for illegals had intensified recently\".“The breadth of Moscow's spying operations made it a unique threat\", said Janez Stušek, director of Slovenia's SOVA intelligence agency until June 2022.\nEffectiveness of Russian spies\nWhilst it is clear that the opinion of Russian operatives regarding the willingness of Ukraine to enter into, and the preparedness of Ukraine for war, was a catastrophic failure, with the Russian military in February 2022 expecting to be welcomed with open arms, this is in part due to the fact that Russia's covert attempts to destabilise Ukraine in the second half of 2021 and early 2022 were a failure. There was also a Russian intelligence failure to comprehend the West's willingness to support Ukraine in the long term. In diplomatic circles we see failures, mainly due to the mass expulsion of diplomats. There have however been some successes, in cyber warfare, in the media and on the ground in occupied areas of Ukraine. It is much harder to determine effectiveness of spies on the ground in other countries.\nLegals\nIn addition to ‘’illegals’’, over 600 Russian diplomats have been identified and been declared ‘’persona non grata’’ in 2022 and 2023 and had their accreditation cancelled, with a number being described as ‘’intelligence officers masquerading as diplomats’’ or \"national security\" concerns. These expulsions of diplomats normally came at a cost, with retaliation by Russia against diplomats based at embassies in Russia.\nThe head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (\"MI6\"), Richard Moore, reported that roughly half of Russia's spies working under diplomatic cover were expelled from Europe by July 2022.\nIllegals\nDeep-cover spies, or ‘’illegals’’, a term for intelligence agents operating without diplomatic cover, have been uncovered in a number of countries. Resembling normal people, many have been uncovered through a combination of their recent activities and heightened awareness by the authorities.\nIn the 1920s the Soviet Union was not recognised by many countries and was therefore not given diplomatic representation. The interior ministry of the Soviet Union (NKVD) sent people overseas giving them false documentation and instructions to settle into their new country and acquire contacts that might be useful in the future. The KGB used the same system from the 1950s. In Russia they are called razvedchik, an approximation of the word ‘scout’.\nRussia is almost unique in the way it changes the nationality of its Russian born officers and gives them years to build up a false identity in another country, before being called forward to undertake a specific task that may take decades to complete. The number of Russian illegals is not thought to be high, probably less than 100, worked by GRU and SVR with their main aim to get close to political, cultural, industrial and military organisations to enable them to \"talent spot\", identify people who might be recruited by others.\n\"Illegals\" also cover locals recruited by Russia, espionage groups sent from Russia or other countries sympathetic to Russia to countries and migrant asylum-seekers who have been persuaded to collect intelligence.\nAlbania\nIn August 2022, three people, two Russians and one Albanian openly climbed over a wall of a weapons factory, were spotted by guards, whom they attacked with a chemical spray, before being arrested. One supposedly admitted to being a Russian spy, the factory is currently used to repair weapons. The three are being held in detention. One, a woman, had asked for asylum, claiming she would be persecuted if returned to Russia. Albania agreed to the asylum claim. Mikhail Zorin, a Russian who had used the spray, remains in prison in May 2023, the others have been released.\nAustralia\nIn February 2023 a large spy ring whose members included those posing as diplomats, as well a deep-cover identity operatives was uncovered. Operating for 18 months it was broken by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The people involved have had visas not renewed, or cancelled, forcing them to leave the country, rather than being expelled, to avoid retaliation against Australian diplomats.\nAustria\nA 39-year-old Greek citizen was uncovered as a spy in Vienna in March 2022 when police raided a house and discovered tracking devices, bugs, a device for finding hidden listening devices and cameras as well as phones, tablets and laptops containing 10 million files and a hazmat suit. The individual, whose father was a former Russian intelligence agent who had been a diplomat in Germany and Austria, had trained in Russia and made 65 trips to other countries since 2018. With no visible income, he owns property in Greece, Austria and Russia and whilst being monitored was seen to use drop boxes to pass information to Russian embassy staff in Vienna.\nBelgium\n* Belgium is the HQ of NATO. In October 2021 NATO expelled eight undeclared Russian intelligence officers from their NATO mission, reducing the mission to just 10 Russians. In retaliation, Sergey Lavrov said all staff at NATO's military mission in Moscow would be stripped of their accreditation. Both missions have now closed.\n* In March 2022, 21 Russian diplomats were expelled by Belgium. Masquerading as technicians, cleaners, attachés, and trade representatives, all were identified as members of GRU, SVR or FSB. They included Alexei Kuksov the embassy ambassador. Staff levels at the embassy have now fallen below 200.\n* A Russian national living in Belgium, running a business specialising in acquiring and sending coordinate-measuring machines to Russian defence businesses was identified in January 2024 as having previously had an address at the GRU dormitory in Moscow. Viktor Labin and his two sons Roman and Ruslan were identified by Russian media The Insider as owners of Groupe d'Investissement Financier in Belgium with Ruslan Labin owning Moscow based Sonatec LLC.\nBrazil\nPolice in Brazil are undertaking an investigation after three Russian spies have been identified recently with fake Brazilian identities. One, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Brazil in July 2022 for identity fraud. (see Greece, Norway and USA) An extradition request by the USA for Cherkasov was refused in July 2023 as Brazil had approved his extradition to Russia in April. The sentence was reduced by the court to 5 years.\nBulgaria\n* On 2 March 2022 Brigadier General Valentin Tsankov (:bg:Валентин Цанков) a reserve general in the Bulgarian Army and former military attaché to London 2003-7 and Washington 2007–11, which was terminated when it was discovered he had trained for 10 months with the KGB in Moscow had also been part of Bulgarian counter intelligence, was arrested after a 2–3-month investigation and accused of spying since 2016, by transferring data on flash drives to the Russian Embassy. Two diplomats working with him were expelled.\n* In July 2022 an explosion occurred at a weapons store in Bulgaria, the latest in a sequence of eight explosions going back to 2011. Owned by weapons dealer Emilian Gebrev, who in 2015 survived a Novichok poison attack, the substance having been put on his car door handle, which in 2020 resulted in the charging of three Russian nationals in absentia in connection with the attempted assassination. One of the accused, Denis Sergeyev, is also linked to the 2018 Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Six suspected Russian GRU agents are under currently under investigation. On 2 June 2023 another fire broke out at the same arms factory in Karnobat. Russian involvement is suspected, with the Bulgarian Minister commented that he was \"100 percent sure\" Russian operatives were responsible for the 2022 explosion.\n* In March 2023, Nikolai Malinov, a former Bulgarian lawmaker charged with spying and sanctioned by the USA for funding spy organisations, travelled to Moscow where he has been elected head of the International Movement of Russophiles, an organisation run under Russia's foreign ministry. Malinov, who is currently under investigation and banned from travelling, is standing for election in the April 2023 elections.\n* Concerns have been raised regarding Russian connections to the security services in Bulgaria, the heads of which are appointed by the President, who is pro Russia. A number of high profile cases regarding criminals undertaking extortion, narcotics and arms dealing have proven to have Russian connections which link to Politicians and the Judiciary and is not being countered effectively by the security services despite the Chief Prosecutor having been dismissed in June 2023.\n* In September 2023 the head of the Russian Orthodox Church in Sofia, Archimandrite Vassian, a Russian citizen, who was already banned from North Macedonia, and two Belarusian clerics, had their residency rights revoked and were expelled for being a risk to Bulgarian security, as was a Russian journalist Alexander Gatsak.\nCzech Republic\nIn September 2022 a senior Czech Republic diplomat, who worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was reportedly caught handing confidential information to Russia.
