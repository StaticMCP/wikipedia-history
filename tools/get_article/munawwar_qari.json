Like other Jadids, Munnawwar Qari worked as author, poet, teacher, journalist and in other occupations.\nLife\nMunawwar Qari was of an ethnic Uzbek origin. He was the youngest child in a family of Islamic scholars and received his education in Tashkent and Bukhara. In 1901, he opened Tashkent's first Maktab to follow the Jadids' new method of teaching. He also wrote textbooks for use in schools and published literary works of other authors, while publishing and editing The Sun, one of the first independent newspapers in Russian Turkestan.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, he continued working as a teacher, but was arrested and deported to a Gulag camp in 1925 and shot in 1931 after being convicted for \"counter-revolutionary activities\". His grave can be found in Moscow's Yagankovo cemetery.\nEducation\nSince his father was left a young orphan, he received his initial education from his mother.

For these schools, he wrote \"Adibi Avval\" (\"First Writer,\" 1907), a textbook for learning the alphabet, and \"Adibi Soniy\" (\"Second Writer,\" 1907). In these, \"Himmatli Faqir\" poem is included, and educational books were published several times. From 1904, he became involved in social, political, and cultural life. From 1906, he worked as a literary contributor for the \"Oʻrta Osiyoning Umurguzorligi\", and \"Taraqqiy\" newspapers. That year, he founded the \"Xurshid\" newspaper as an editor and a writer. In 1908, his collection \"Sabzazor,\" \"Yer Yuzi\" (about geography), and \"Tajvidal Qurʼon\" (teaching the Quran) books were published and used as textbooks in new-style schools. He also managed the \"Shuhrat\" (1907), \"Tujjor\" (1907), and \"Osiyo\" (1908) newspapers and carried out the duties of a literary contributor. Later, he worked as the responsible editor in the \"Sadoyi Turkiston\" (1914-1915) newspaper, the confidential editor in \"Al-Islah\" journal (1915-1917), and as a responsible editor in the \"Najot\" and \"Kengash\" (1917) newspapers.

He advocated for the adoption of European trade and industry, the advancement of science, and the cultivation of spiritual enlightenment. He actively fought against the policies of the Khanates and the Emirate, which leaned towards capitalism. He led the Enlightenment of Islam organization and ideologically guided society, sects, and organizations such as \"Turkiston\" National Autonomy, \"Ittihod va Taraqqiyot\", \"Milliy Ittihod\", and \"Nashri Ma'rifat\". He was a proponent of conscience freedom and supported the idea of a worldly democratic state. This is why he supported the Turkestan Autonomy (1917) formed in the city of Kokand.\nFamily\nHe was born into an Uzbek noble family in the Darxon neighborhood of Shaykhantakhur district in Tashkent city. His father, Abdurashidxon Sotiboldixon, was a teacher, and his mother, Khosiyat, was the daughter of the teacher Xonxoʻja Shorahimxoʻja. He was the third son in the family.
