Twenty-one All-Star Games have been held since the Tampa Bay Lightning entered the league in 1992, with at least one player chosen to represent the Lightning in each year except 1998. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off. Tampa Bay has hosted two All-Star games. The first was the 49th, which took place at the Ice Palace Arena. The second was the 63rd National Hockey League All-Star Game, which took place at Amalie Arena.\n* Selected by fan vote\n* Selected as one of four \"last men in\" by fan vote\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Tampa Bay Lightning players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 44th\n|1993\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 45th\n|1994\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 46th\n|1996\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 47th\n|1997\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 48th\n|1998\n|No Lightning selected\n|—\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 49th\n| 1999\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 50th\n|2000\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 51st\n|2001\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 52nd\n|2002\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 53rd\n|rowspan=\"3\" |2003\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 54th\n| rowspan=\"2\"|2004\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 55th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2007\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 56th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2008\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 57th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2009\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 58th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2011\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 59th\n|2012\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 60th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2015\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 61st\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 62nd\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2017\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"6\" | 63rd\n|rowspan=\"6\" |2018\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"6\" |\n|-\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| (Replaced Hedman)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" | 64th\n|rowspan=\"4\" |2019\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n| (Replaced Carey Price)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 65th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2020\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| (Replaced Tuukka Rask)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 66th\n|rowspan=\"3\" |2022\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|#\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 67th\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2023\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 68th\n|2024\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nCareer achievements\nHockey Hall of Fame\nThe following is a list of Tampa Bay Lightning who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Tampa Bay Lightning inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame\n! scope=\"col\" |Individual\n! scope=\"col\" |Category\n! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Lightning in category\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2017\n|2001–2006\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2010\n|1996–1998\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2017\n|2008–2009\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2000\n|1993–1995\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|2018\n|2000–2014\n|\n|}\nFoster Hewitt Memorial Award\nOne member of the Lightning organization has been honored with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award.

The most recently retired number is that of Vincent Lecavalier, whose number was retired on February 10, 2018. Also out of circulation is the number 99 which was retired league-wide for Wayne Gretzky on February 6, 2000. Gretzky did not play for the Lightning during his 20-year NHL career and no Lightning player had ever worn the number 99 prior to its retirement.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+ Tampa Bay Lightning retired numbers\n! scope=\"col\" |Number\n! scope=\"col\" |Player\n! scope=\"col\" |Position\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Lightning as a player\n! scope=\"col\" |Date of retirement ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |4\n|\n|\n|1998–2013\n|February 10, 2018\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |26\n|\n|\n|2000–2014\n|January 13, 2017\n|\n|}\nOther awards\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+ Tampa Bay Lightning franchise players who have received non-NHL awards\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Description\n! scope=\"col\" |Winner\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Guldpucken\n|The ice hockey player of the year in Sweden\n|\n|,\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Golden Hockey Stick\n|The ice hockey player of the year in Czech Republic\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*List of National Hockey League awards\nNotes\nReferences"
