The album was reissued on 16 May 1995 by Metropolis Records for distribution in the United States.\nReception\n}}\nAllMusic awarded Bioculture two and a half out of five possible stars. Sonic Boom said \"the band has not broken any new musical ground\" but \"gone are the childishly stupid cyber happy mentalities, the music actually has some semblance of structure.\" EST criticized the loud production but claimed \"Electro Assassin knows what is expected and delivers it with style; EA has taken care with the bass lines and percussion and could teach some of the bigger names a thing or two in the effective use of spoken word samples.\" The critic went on to say \"fans of FLA's Caustic Grip and all that came after it should definitely track Bioculture down.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the Bioculture liner notes.\nElectro Assassin\n* Kevin Gould&nbsp;– instruments\n* Richard McKinlay&nbsp;– instruments\n* Ian Taylor&nbsp;– vocals\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
