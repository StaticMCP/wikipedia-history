Led by Henry D. Washburn and Nathaniel P. Langford, and with a U.S. Army escort headed by  Lt. Gustavus C. Doane, the expedition followed the general course of the Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition made the previous year.\nDuring their explorations, members of the party made detailed maps and observations of the Yellowstone region, exploring numerous lakes, climbing several mountains, and observing wildlife. The expedition visited both the Upper and Lower Geyser Basins, and after observing the regularity of eruptions of one geyser, decided to name it Old Faithful, since it erupted about once every 74 minutes.\nOne member of the expedition, Montana writer and lawyer Cornelius Hedges, later wrote a number of articles for a Helena, Montana-based newspaper, describing the things the expedition had witnessed. In discussions with other members of the party and in his writing for the newspaper, Hedges was a vocal supporter of setting aside the Yellowstone region as a National Park, an idea originally proposed by former acting Montana Territorial Governor Thomas Francis Meagher.\nEncouragement\nThe Washburn party was clearly inspired by the journals kept by Charles W. Cook and David E. Folsom, as well as their personal accounts.  Immediately after the Cook–Folsom–Peterson Expedition, Folsom went to work as a surveyor for Washburn.\nAdditionally, Langford had personal connections with Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad well before their expedition.  Cooke was interested in the potential of the Yellowstone region to attract railroad business.  After the expedition, Cooke financed Langford's early 1871 speeches in Virginia City, Helena, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. about the 1870 expedition on behalf of the Northern Pacific Railroad.\nOn January 19, 1871, one of those speeches in Washington, D.C. was attended by geologist Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, who became inspired to conduct his next geological survey in the Yellowstone region.  The result was the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871.\nMembers of the expedition\n* Civilian Members\n** Henry D. Washburn – Elected leader, Surveyor-General of Montana\n** Nathaniel P.

From Mount Washburn the party can see south into the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, the Hayden Valley and Yellowstone Lake.\n* August 30, 1870 – The party reached the Yellowstone Falls and spent several days exploring the canyon and thermal features near the river.\n* September 3, 1870 – After crossing the Yellowstone river, the party proceeded up the valley to Yellowstone Lake, camping just east of the lake's outlet.\n* September 7, 1870 – By this date, the party had traveled south along the eastern shore of Yellowstone Lakes to its headwaters.  During this time, Langford and Doane ascended peaks in the Absaroka Range that were ultimately named for them: Mount Langford and Mount Doane.\n* September 9, 1870 – The party reached Two Ocean Pass, near the headwaters of both the Snake River and Yellowstone River.
