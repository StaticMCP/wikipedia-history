The third-longest reign (and longest of a king) was that of George III, who reigned for 59 years 96 days between 1760 and 1820.\nJames Stuart, the Old Pretender, was a pretender to the throne from 16 September 1701 until his death on 1 January 1766, a total of 64 years 108 days.\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was the monarch's spouse from 6 February 1952 until his death on 9 April 2021, for a total of 69 years 62 days, making him the longest-serving consort overall.

The longest-serving heir-presumptive of either sex was Robert II, who was heir-presumptive to Robert I and then David II for a total of 46 years, 353 days; he also served the longest single tenure ( as heir-presumptive to David II).\nEdward the Black Prince had the longest tenure as an heir who did not subsequently become monarch; he was heir apparent to Edward III for his lifetime of 45 years 357 days, but he died in 1376, one year before his father, who died in 1377.\nShortest\nThe shortest-reigning monarch was Lady Jane Grey who ruled for 9 days from 6 July until 15 July 1553 (although she was only proclaimed queen by the Lords of the council on 10 July).

''Note: Jane's reign is disputed''.\nThe king with the shortest definitively known reign was Edgar the Ætheling who ruled for 2 months, 12 days in 1066 before submitting to William the Conqueror.

This would also be the record for shortest total tenure as heir-presumptive (Elizabeth was later heiress-presumptive to her sister Mary).\nThe shortest total tenure as a male heir-presumptive was George I (54 days).\nThe shortest tenure as a female heir presumptive Mary, Queen of Scots who was heir presumptive from birth until her accession to the throne at the age of 6 days.\nPretenders in power\nDuring the Middle Ages and the mid-18th century, a number of pretenders to the throne controlled all or a substantial portion of England and Scotland:\n* Empress Matilda: Daughter and only surviving child of Henry I of England, was declared her father's heir, but her cousin Stephen usurped the throne. This led to a years long war, in which her son Henry II, was eventually declared Stephen's heir. This period is known as the Anarchy.\n* Henry the Young King, who was crowned junior king in 1170 at the age of 15, led a revolt against his father Henry II for several months in 1173–74 and controlled much of England.\n* Louis VIII of France: Controlled the Southeast of England and later the whole country briefly during the First Barons' War from 1215 to 1217.\n* Edward Balliol was crowned king of Scotland in 1332 and was able to control some parts of it until 1356.
