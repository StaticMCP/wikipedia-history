      "text": "# Suhail Warraich\n\nSohail Sarwar Warraich (; born 1961) is a Pakistani journalist and television host.\nCareer\nWarraich is the host of the GEO TV Programmes Ek Din Geo k Sath, an interview-based TV program on lifestyles of celebrities. He also used to host Left Right, a political talk show posing right-wing and left-wing political arguments. Warraich used to support the left wing on this TV show. He used to  come on a programme Meray Mutabiq every Sunday, an opinionated interview/talk show based on Warraich's analytical views on current issues along with TV journalists Hassan Nisar and Iftikhar Ahmad. Sohail Warraich is also a human rights activist responsible for Amnesty International Pakistan's Human Rights Project.\nThe core of the debate is not whether Warraich verbally supports democracy, but whether his actions and commentary serve to strengthen or weaken it.\nTo his critics, his recent work is evidence that he is a mouthpiece for the establishment, and his professed belief in democracy is secondary to maintaining a positive relationship with powerful generals.\nTo his defenders and himself, he is navigating the complex and delicate political landscape of Pakistan, where the military is an undeniable power player. In this view, his work offers pragmatic commentary rather than overt support.\nWarraich joined Dunya News as Executive Director on 23 January 2017. Later, he rejoined  Geo TV in 2020.\nWarraich is considered to be an authority on Punjab's political families, clans or 'biradari' system voting trend prevalent in Punjab's election politics.\nIn 2024, he was awarded the President's Pride of Performance for Journalism.\nBooks\n*Qatil Kaun?\n*Ghaddar Kaun?
