It is also the closest station to the town of Chipping Norton.\nThe station is on the Cotswold Line and is served by Great Western Railway trains.\nHistory\nWhen the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was extended from  to Wolvercot Junction (north of ) on 4 June 1853, there was no station between  and . On 10 August 1855 a branch line to  was opened by the Chipping Norton Railway, and a station, known as Chipping Norton Junction, was opened at the junction of the branch with the OW&W; this branch was purchased by the OW&W in 1859. The OW&W amalgamated with other railways on 1 July 1860 to form the West Midland Railway; this in turn amalgamated with the Great Western Railway on 1 August 1863. In the meantime, a second branch line from Chipping Norton Junction, the Bourton-on-the-Water railway, had opened on 1 March 1862; that railway was absorbed by the GWR on 1 February 1874.\nOn 1 June 1881 the first section of the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway was opened; this connected the  branch to the Cheltenham & Great Western Union line at Lansdown Junction, Cheltenham; and on 6 April 1887 a second section was opened, connecting the Chipping Norton branch to the Oxford and Rugby Railway at . The Great Western Railway took over the B&CDR on 1 July 1897, but for nearly twenty years, through trains running between  and  needed to reverse at Chipping Norton Junction.\nThe reversal was inconvenient for trains which did not need to call at Chipping Norton Junction, so for their benefit the GWR built a bridge to carry through trains between Banbury and Cheltenham over the Oxford and Worcester line; it opened to goods trains on 8 January 1906 and to passenger trains on 1 May 1906. The station was renamed Kingham on 1 May 1909.\nUpon the opening of this new link, a new express train service began to use the line, including the new flyover, once a day in each direction. This train, unofficially known as the Ports to Ports Express, was a collaboration between the North Eastern Railway, the Great Central Railway and the GWR, which from 1 May 1906 ran between  and  via , , , ,  and ; in August 1906 it was extended to serve , via the Barry Railway; in July 1909 a through coach to and from Hull was introduced. It ran non-stop between Banbury and , but even so, took 82 minutes for this  stretch. It was suspended during the First World War, reinstated on 12 July 1919 and extended to  in 1920; on the outbreak of war in September 1939, the service was again suspended, but when reintroduced in October 1946, it used a different route between Banbury and Newport.\nDuring the Second World War new sidings were installed in 1942 on both the Worcester and the Oxford sides of the station for marshalling trains and unloading munitions. By 1943 the area's road verges were stacked with shells and bombs and the depot was the largest US ammunition depot in England. In 1946-47 about 80 War Department (WD) 2-8-0 Austerity locomotives, some with military insignia,  were stored at Kingham  by the GWR pending decisions about their disposal and future use.\nIn 1953, rationalisation was carried out which resulted in the closure of the East and West signal boxes and the singling of the line between them for working purposes. The remaining track between the boxes formed the base of a self-contained triangle for turning engines. By this time, the line to King's Sutton was  open only for freight and a token passenger service operated to Chipping Norton.\nBritish Railways withdrew passenger services from Kingham to Cheltenham and Chipping Norton in 1962, and freight services in 1964. British Rail designated the Oxford and Worcester line \"The Cotswold Line\". Passenger traffic increased in the 1990s and 2000s.\nIn 2015, a car park extension was added with 100 car spaces. A new footbridge was also added, with provision for passenger lifts.\nLocomotive depot\nA small depot was constructed in 1881 for the Cheltenham extension; this was in the Chipping Norton branch fork, and had a  turntable, which was too small for a tender locomotive to be turned. This was replaced by a  turntable early in the twentieth century, large enough for a \"Dean Goods\" 0-6-0 tender locomotive; however, the depot closed in 1906. It was rebuilt, reopening again in 1913, as a sub-shed of Worcester, but the turntable was later removed, and the depot finally closed in December 1962.\nAppearances in television and film\nKingham station was used as the setting for an episode (S3 E5) of BBC comedy This Country. The episode was first broadcast on 16 March 2020.\nAccidents and incidents\n*On 15 July 1966, an express passenger train was derailed due to an unsecured switch blade on a set of points. Eighteen people were injured.\nServices\nGreat Western Railway operate all services at Kingham. The typical off-peak service at the station in trains per hour is:\n* 1 tph to London Paddington\n* 1 tph to  of which some continue to  and\n( on Sundays) |previous= |route=Great Western RailwayCotswold Line |col= }}\nLine and station open |previous=Line open, station closed |route=Great Western RailwayOxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway|col= }}\nLine and station closed |next=Line and station closed |route = Great Western RailwayBanbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway |col= }}\nBus services\nTwo bus routes serve the station.
