The region was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1535 to 1679, New France from 1679 to 1803, and part of the United States of America 1803&ndash;present.\nThe Plains Indian Wars directly affected the region during westward expansion.  The Dakota War of 1862 (also known as the Sioux Uprising) involved eastern Dakota Native Americans, the armed conflicts of this war were fought in Minnesota, their former lands.
