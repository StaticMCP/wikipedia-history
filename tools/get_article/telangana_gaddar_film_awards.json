      "text": "# Telangana Gaddar Film Awards\n\nThe Telangana Gaddar Film Awards (TGFA), also referred to as Gaddar Telangana Film Awards, are annual film awards instituted in 2025 by the Government of Telangana to honour excellence in Telugu cinema. They are presented through the Telangana Film Development Corporation (TFDC) and recognize both recent films and works from earlier years following the state’s formation.\nHistory and purpose\nAfter the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, Telangana did not conduct its own state film awards for over a decade. The TGFA were established to fill that gap. Importantly, the awards are named in tribute to the revolutionary Telugu poet and balladeer Gaddar, celebrating regional cultural identity and artistic contributions.\nStructure\n* The awards cover a wide spectrum: feature films, technical categories (direction, acting, cinematography, etc.), special categories (such as best children’s film, best film on heritage or environment), and honorary lifetime achievement awards.\n* Urdu language films are included for the first time in the Feature Film category.\n* The jury for the inaugural TGFA was chaired by veteran actress Jayasudha.\nReferences"
