It stars Deborah Kerr, Stewart Granger and Richard Carlson. It was adapted by Helen Deutsch, directed by Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\nPlot\nIn British East Africa (Kenya Colony) in 1897, experienced British safari guide Allan Quatermain is persuaded by Elizabeth Curtis to find her husband, who disappeared in the unexplored African interior while searching for the legendary King Solomon’s mines. She has a copy of the map that her husband had followed. Elizabeth and her brother John Goode join the adventure. Allan has no use for women on a safari, but during the long and grueling journey, he and Elizabeth begin to fall in love.\nThe party encounters Van Brun, a lone white man living with a tribe, and learn that he had met Mr. Curtis. However, when Allan recognizes him as a fugitive who will not let them depart, they take him hostage to leave the village safely. Van Brun tries to shoot Allan, killing his faithful right-hand man Khiva instead. Allan dispatches Van Brun and the party flees from the angry villagers.\nThey meet a tall mysterious native, Umbopa, who joins them. When they finally reach the region where the mines are believed to exist, they are met by people who resemble him and they discover that Umbopa is royalty who has returned to attempt to dethrone the usurper King Twala. Umbopa leaves with his supporters to raise a rebellion, while Allan, Elizabeth and John travel to a tense meeting with Twala at his kraal. With his last rifle bullet, John kills an attacker, temporarily quelling the natives.\nThe king's advisor Gagool communicates that the tribe has seen Mr. Curtis and leads them to a cave that contains a trove of jewels and skeletal remains. While they are distracted, Gagool triggers a booby trap that seals the adventurers inside. They find a way out through an underground river and return to Twala's compound just as Umbopa and his followers arrive.\nUmbopa's people decide a disputed kingship by having the two claimants duel to the death. Despite cheating by one of Twala's men, Umbopa wins. He then provides an escort for his friends' return trip.\nCast\n* Deborah Kerr as Elizabeth Curtis\n* Stewart Granger as Allan Quatermain\n* Richard Carlson as John Goode\n* Hugo Haas as Van Brun (\"Smith\")\n* Lowell Gilmore as Eric Masters\n* Kimursi as Khiva (credited as Kimursi of the Kipsigi Tribe)\n* Siriaque as Umbopa\n* Sekaryongo as Chief Gagool\n* Baziga as King Twala (credited as Baziga of the Watussi Tribe)\nProduction\nIn November 1946, MGM announced it had purchased film rights to the novel from Gaumont British, which had produced the 1937 adaptation. Sam Zimbalist was named as producer. In October 1948, Helen Deutsch was assigned to write the script.\nMGM typically produced one or two large-scale overseas films per year during this era. When Quo Vadis was postponed, MGM elected to film ''King Solomon's Mines'' on location in Africa. Production equipment was delivered by a convoy of Dodge trucks traveling a total distance of more than .\nAdaptation\nLike virtually all film versions, this also changes Haggard's plot to include a female lead. But it strays even further from the novel than the 1937 British adaptation ''King Solomon's Mines''. There are several African characters in the book, particularly Umbopa, a king in disguise. In the earlier film, Paul Robeson received top billing for the role, whereas in this version, Umbopa's importance is greatly reduced.\nCasting\nDeborah Kerr was announced as the female lead in July 1949. MGM wanted Errol Flynn to co-star. The same month Compton Bennett was signed to direct; he had just finished That Forsyte Woman for MGM with Flynn.\nFlynn eventually chose instead to star in Kim. Stewart Granger was signed to play the role in August 1949. Richard Carlson was cast in September.\nFilming\nFilming in Africa took place at Murchison Falls in Uganda; Astrida, \"the land of giant Watusis\"; Volcano Country and Stanleyville in the Belgian Congo; Tanganyika; and Rumuruti and Machakos in Kenya. The cave scene was filmed in the Slaughter Canyon Cave at Carlsbad Caverns National Park and some other scenes were shot at nearby Sitting Bull Falls in Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico.\nThe film marked the beginning of Eva Monley's career as a Hollywood script supervisor, producer and location scout specializing in African locations.\nIn February 1950, after five months of location filming in Africa, Andrew Marton replaced Compton Bennett as director. The official reason announced was that Bennett had fallen ill, but it was rumored that the cause was rooted in Bennett's disagreements with some of the cast.\nReception\nCritical\nBosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that \"there is more than a trace of outright hokum in this thriller ... but there is also an ample abundance of scenic novelty and beauty to compensate.\" Variety called the film a \"striking adventure film\" with \"high excitement in meetings with wild savages and beasts and a number of excellently staged fights-to-the-death.\" ''Harrison's Reports called the film \"a highly spectacular romantic adventure melodrama that has the rare quality of holding an audience captivated from start to finish.\" John McCarten of The New Yorker'' wrote, \"'King Solomon's Mines' undertakes to show what a safari through Africa might have been up against fifty years ago. In this, I think, the picture, which was shot in the African highlands, succeeds admirably.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin called the film \"a somewhat stilted epic, strangely lacking in excitement\", with Kerr seeming \"miscast and out of place.\"\nBox office\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $5,047,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $4,908,000 elsewhere. After production and other associated costs were deducted, the film returned a profit of $4,049,000, making it MGM's most successful film of 1950 and the second highest-grossing film of that year in the United States.\nThe film was the third most popular film at the British box-office in 1951. It was also a big hit in France, with admissions of 4,108,770.\nAwards and nominations\nRobert L. Surtees won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Color, while Ralph E. Winters and Conrad A. Nervig won for Best Film Editing. The film was nominated for Best Picture.\nRadio adaptation\n''King Solomon's Mines was presented on Lux Radio Theatre on December 1, 1952. The one-hour adaptation featured Kerr and Granger in their screen roles.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://archive.org/download/Lux_Fills_and_Upgrades/Lux-521201-806-KingSolomansMines-DKerrSGrangercomplete.mp3 King Solomon's Mines''] on Lux Radio Theater: December 1, 1952\n* [https://archive.today/20130615084010/http://www.zonetroopers.com/5/post/2011/10/king-solomons-mines-1985-1986.html Zone Troopers: Website about the different Allan Quatermain and King Solomon's Mine films]"
