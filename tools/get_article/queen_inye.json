Among her ten sons, three of the eldest became the reign kings (Sunjong, Seonjong, Sukjong) and three others became a Buddhist monk. She was the grandmother of Heonjong and Yejong, also ancestors of all goryeo kings after her husband.\nBiography\nEarly life and background\nThe future Queen Inye was born as part of the powerful Gyeongwon Yi clan. Her father was its leader, Yi Ja-yeon () and her mother was the daughter of Kim In-wi () from the Gyeongju Kim clan. As the first and oldest daughter, she had 8 brothers and 2 younger sisters who both would become King Munjong's wives, Consort Ingyeong and Consort Injeol.\nMarriage and palace life\nLady Yi was married to King Munjong of Goryeo as his second wife and honoured as Princess Yeondeok () since she stayed in \"Yeondeok Palace\" () and sometimes called as Consort Yeondeok (). They had their first son in 1047 and two years later, she gave birth into their second son and formally became the queen consort in 1052, which this event was celebrated by many provinces. Beside that, she also bore Munjong 8 other sons and 4 daughters, but two of their daughters died too early. Her position was further consolidated upon her eldest son crowned as the crown prince in 1054.\nIn 1083, her husband died and their eldest son ascended the throne as Sunjong of Goryeo. However, the new king was said to be very grieved for his father's death and died not long after that, which he was succeeded by his younger brother, Seonjong of Goryeo. In 1083, the king formally honoured his mother as a queen mother () after bestowed the Queen Dowager Palace () to her and congratulatory messages were sent from each province along with a whopping 100,000 pieces of cloth were given to her. Also, it was said that Tamna Province sent some envoy as a tribute to the royal palace. Since this, she lived in \"Jasu Hall\" () until her death.\nEfforts in Buddhism\nThe queen was said to personally like and always practiced Buddhism, as she was a devout Buddhist during her lifetime. She also prayed for the prosperity of her descendants at \"Gamro Temple\" (), which was built by her father.\nShe built \"Gukcheong Temple\" () in 1089 and delighted to hear about Jeontaegyo () from her fourth son. In addition, she transcribed the Yugahyeonyangron () into the silver book () and later finished by King Sukjong. In 1090, she went to the Three Horned Mountain () along with King Seonjong to visited Seunggagul () and \"Insu Temple\" (), came to \"Sinhyeol Temple\" () and participated in \"500 Buddhist Ceremony\" ().\nDeath and after life\nMeanwhile, the queen mother died in Seogyeong () on 5 October 1092 (9th years reign of King Seonjong) and her body was transported back to Gaegyeong to buried in Daereung Tomb ().\nHer works for Buddhist, which had been vigorously promoted, was completed by her 3rd and 4th son after her death. In 1096, King Sukjong held a Doryang () for three days at the Geondeok Hall () and read the entire Avatamsaka Sutra, which initiated and completed by his late mother. When Gukcheong temple was completed a year later, King Sukjong himself opened the Gyeongchandoryang () and wrote the Gyeongchansi () to respond Yusin ().\nHonors\nAfter her death, she was posthumously honoured as Queen Mother Inye Sundeok () or shortly Queen Mother Inye () by King Seonjong of Goryeo.\nUnder his command too, Banhon Hall () was built at Gukcheong Temple for her and she was enshrined in her husband's shrine. According to the \"Anthology of Daegak National Preceptor\" (), she was called as National Mother Inye (; \"The Benevolent and Perspicacious National Mother\").\nIn April 1140 (18th year reign of King Injong), she received name Seong-seon () and Hyo-mok () in October 1253 (40th year reign of King Gojong) as her full Posthumous name.\nAccording to the records left, she was said to have a beautiful heart and personality, docile, gentleness, and her virtuous conduct was no less than that of a famous ancient master.
