It derived its name from the area surrounding Scotland Road, which was historically a densely populated and predominantly Irish district in north Liverpool.\nThe ward formed part of the Liverpool Scotland (UK Parliament constituency), which gained prominence for being represented by T. P. O'Connor, an Irish Nationalist MP, from 1885 until his death in 1929. This made it the only British constituency outside Ireland to consistently elect an Irish Nationalist.\nThe North Scotland ward ceased to exist following boundary changes in the mid-20th century, as Liverpool reorganised its electoral map to reflect population shifts and urban redevelopment.\nGeography\nThe ward covered parts of the Vauxhall area in north Liverpool, centered on Scotland Road and its adjoining streets. It was bordered by wards such as Vauxhall, Exchange, and other Scotland-related divisions. Historically, it was a working-class area with a strong Irish Catholic community and proximity to Liverpool’s docks.\nLegacy\nAlthough the ward was dissolved, its history remains significant in Liverpool’s political and cultural narrative. The legacy of Irish influence and working-class activism in the area is still remembered, particularly in connection with Scotland Road and the constituency’s unique political history.\nElections\n1919\n1920\n1921\n1922\n1923\n1924\n1925\n1926\n1927\n1928\n1929\n1930\n1931\n1932\n1933\n1934\n1935\n1936\n1937\n1938\n1945\n1946\n1947\n1949\n1950\n1951\n1952\nBoundaries were readjusted and North Scotland was deleted after 1952.\nReferences"
