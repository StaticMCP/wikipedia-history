Three years later, it was reformed as the \"General Union\", with local unions in Bradford, Chorley, Halifax, Manchester, Nelson, Preston, Rochdale and Skipton affiliating.  Unusually for a textile union, it covered workers in a variety of materials, including cotton, wool and worsted.  It was also unusual in that it did not provide any support for industrial action, but instead saw its principal purpose as an employment exchange, helping unemployed members find work in other mills.  Within Yorkshire, it also recruited twisters and drawers, but those workers in Lancashire instead joined the Amalgamated Association of Beamers, Twisters and Drawers (Hand and Machine).\nAffiliates of the union included:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It affiliated to the Northern Counties Textile Trades Federation.  It lost members when the Chorley and Preston societies disaffiliated, but these later rejoined; however, membership did not recover, and by 1949 was down to only 1,040.  Faced with this decline, the Bradford and Halifax societies merged with two unaffiliated bodies: the Leeds Warpdressers and the Textile Daymen and Cloth Pattern Makers, forming the Yorkshire Society of Textile Craftsmen, the new organisation maintaining its affiliation.\nIn 1970, the union dissolved, its remaining constituents gradually merging into the Association of Preparatory Workers.\nGeneral Secretaries\n:1891: W.
