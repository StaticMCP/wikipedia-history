The work has sometimes been noted as Mann's most famous speech.\nBackground\nMann delivered the speech after the assassination of Walther Rathenau, the German foreign minister, on 24 June 1922, which had shocked him. In a letter to his friend Ernst Bertram, he decried the \"darkness in the minds of these barbarians\" (). After the assassination he wanted to reason with the German youth – which he saw as very conservative and romantic – by making a speech in support of the republic around Gerhard Hauptmann's 60th&nbsp;birthday. Gerhard Hauptmann was a German writer, who had won the 1912 Nobel Prize in Literature, and was known as one of the first intellectual supporters of the new German republic.\nBy delivering this speech, Mann also wanted to distance himself from conservative-reactionary forces within Germany, which revered Mann for his 1918 Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man.\nPersonally, 1922 was important for Mann as he reconciled during this year with his brother Heinrich, whom he had previously viciously attacked in the Reflections. Mann read a draft of the speech to a circle of friends including Heinrich on 6 October 1922.\nLecture\nIn his earlier Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man (1918), Mann had defended German authoritarianism and the \"culture\" of Germany against the \"civilization\" of the West. After the establishment of the Weimar Republic, his speech \"On the German Republic\" marked a turning point for Mann as he now – at least in part – supported the young republic.\nThe work was publicly delivered by Mann on 13 October 1922 in the Berlin Beethoven Auditorium ( 32) which was part of the  and later destroyed during World War II. Whether the work constitutes a lecture or an essay or a mixed form is debated by scholars.\nIn his lecture, Mann compares the seemingly antithetical writers Novalis – an 18th-century German romantic – and Walt Whitman – a 19th-century American \"poet of democracy\" and explains that they have more in common than one initially assumes.\nThe lecture heavily relies on quotations. The American academic Lawrence S. Rainey counts 75&nbsp;quotations from 12 persons (Gerhart Hauptmann, Stefan George, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Flaubert, Richard Wagner, Novalis, Walt Whitman, Adalbert Stifter, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, August von Platen-Hallermünde and Lothair I).\nReception\nContemporary\nIn the contemporary conservative press, Mann was sharply attacked for his lecture. ' (The Conscience) wrote \"Mann overboard\" () and ' (The Day) named him \"Saulus Mann\" (Saul Mann).' Some authors in the liberal press were also sceptical. ' (The Diary) noted that the speech was held in Berlin and not in Mann's adopted city of Munich where reactionary forces could have broken the windows of his home for the speech. The paper called this \"well-considered bravery\" in an ironic tone.\nMann family\nHis daughter Erika reflected positively on the work. In 1965 she wrote:\n}}\nModern reception\nModern literary criticism has received the work in a positive light. Lawrence S. Rainey remarks that the work \"offers pleasures, both in content and form\" and that \"its complex affirmation of the Weimar Republic was indeed a brave and prescient step.\" He particularly praises the \"guarded affirmation of male love\", which showed \"a level of tolerance that was unusual for its time\" and was \"still valuable today.\"\nThe German academic  has called the work \"perhaps [Mann's] most famous speech\".\nPublication history and translation\nThe lecture was first published in volume&nbsp;33 issue&nbsp;11 of Die neue Rundschau on pages 1072–1106 (1922) with the title \"Thomas Mann for the German Republic\" (). In 1923, it was published as a standalone work with the now common German title \"\". It is contained in the volume&nbsp;15.1 of the  (2002) – the editio maior of Mann's works – on pages&nbsp;514–559.\nThe work was translated into English for the first time in 1942 by Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter, albeit without the passages on homoeroticism, which Mann wanted to omit for an American readership. In 2007, a complete translation into English was provided by Lawrence S. Rainey for the academic journal Modernism/modernity.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nPrimary sources\n*\n*\nSecondary sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\nFurther reading\n*  Schöningh |year=2023 |isbn=978-3-657-79079-1 |editor-last=Deckers |editor-first=Daniel |pages=398–407 |language=de |chapter=Dienst an der Zeit |doi=10.30965/9783657790791 |chapter-url=https://doi.org/10.30965/9783657790791_042}}\n*"
