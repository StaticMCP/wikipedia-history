The five organizers were: Alexander Gillon, Peter Boquet, Michael Kalteissen, William Livingston and Gideon Dupont. Gillon and Kalteissen would later resign in the latter part of 1777. Gillon became commander of the vessels of war for South Carolina and Kalteissen would be appointed as the Provincial Army's Wagon-master-general for the state. They enlisted the following men, who became the German Fusiliers. The most noteworthy involvement of the German Fusiliers in the American Revolution was their participation in the battles of Port Royal Island and the Siege of Savannah.\nOriginal Company Roll:\nHenry Timrod, Peter Meurset, Jacob Sass, Joseph Kimmell, Christian Martin, Philip Will, John Groning, Martin Clime, Charles Gruber, Christian Gruber, Frederick Gravenstein, Jacob Warley, Charles Desel, Abraham Markley, William Snider, John Eichinger, James Gross, Adam Sigfrid, Jacob Frick, Jacob Stoll, Daniel Cobia, Christian Algir, Daniel Rupple, Herman Nieffer, Adam Petsch, Martin Miller, Paul Schlatter, Daniel Strobel, Philip Mintzing, Heinrich Blankenhorn, Robert Beard, Thomas Harris, John Kirchner, John Delka, Sr., Frederick D.
