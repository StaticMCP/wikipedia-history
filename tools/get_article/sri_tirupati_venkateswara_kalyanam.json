T. Rama Rao under his Ramakrishna Cine Studios banner. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Jaya Prada, Jayasudha, Nandamuri Balakrishna  and its music is composed by Pendyala Nageswara Rao.\nPlot\nThe film begins with the advent of Kali Yuga when depraved forces enact. So, Bhudevi issued a request to Vishnu through Narada to keep his foot on her, for which Goddess Lakshmi censured. At the same time, Saptarshi, helmed by Kasyapa, performs a Yagna, where Narada arrives and questions who the patron deity of the sacrifice is. As they are not in a position to answer, the sages bequeath the responsibility to Bhrigu, who moves to test Trimurthi. After cursing Siva & Brahma, Bhrigu reaches Vaikunta, but Vishnu keeps a deaf ear. Enraged, Bhrigu kicks Vishnu in his chest. To appease him, Vishnu held his legs and pressed the extra eye on his foot to symbolize his egotism, where the sage realized his folly and expressed regrets. But fuming Lakshmi quits Vaikunta, Vishnu backs her and keeps his first step on the earth at Tirumala hills, then she trembles. After that, Vishnu reaches his ardent devotee, Vakulamatha's ashram, whom he calls a mother, and she names him Srinivasa.\nAt one time, Srinivasa chases a wild elephant. In pursuit, he meets a charming girl, Padmavati, the daughter of Aakasa Raju, and they fall in love. After initial hesitation, Aakasa Raju agrees to their knitting, for which Srinivasa has debts from Kubera and promises to repay only the interest till the end of Kali Yuga. Soon after the nuptial, Narada notifies Lakshmi of what is happening when she confronts Vishnu. The clash between his two consorts leads Srinivasa to turn himself into a stone. Depressed, Padmavathi also takes the stone form and Vakula Devi as a garland. Now, Lakshmi shows her repentance and wants to reach the deity with a holy heart. So, she is incarnated in a lotus flower and reared by a Muslim King, and Bibi Nanchari becomes an exemplary devotee of Venkateswara. Muslim Priests condemn the act, and they decree Chief Commander Uggla Khan to bar her, who is about to seize her. At present, the Lord appears and replaces her in his heart.\nGenerations pass. Once a devotee, Bhavaji arrives from North India and renames the Lord Balaji. Anyhow, authorities forbid his entrance into the temple. From there, every night, the god spends some time with him by playing dice. One day, Balaji loses his ornament in the bet, and the officials accuse Bhavaji of being guilty of the deed. Right now, the King is conducting a test on Bhavaji by imprisoning him full of sugar cane, which he has to finish before dawn. During that plight, Venkateswara appears as an elephant and vanishes the sugar cane, startling everyone. Since then, he has been renowned as Hathiram Bhavaji, and the temple authority endorsed him. Finally, the movie ends with Hathiram Bhavaji praising the deity with Suprabhatam.\nCast\n*N. T.
