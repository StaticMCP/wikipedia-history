The founders of the new party were mostly former members of the Conservative People's Party and the Republicans' Coalition Party (these two parties had formed the Isamaa (Pro Patria) electoral cartel in 1992, together with the Christian Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Union).\nThe ''People's Party of Republicans and Conservatives contested the 1995 parliamentary election under the banner of Right-wingers (Parempoolsed''). The list got 27,053 votes (5.00%) and thus managed to pass the threshold, gaining five seats in the Riigikogu. The party remained in opposition throughout the four-year term.\nIn May 1998, the party merged with the non-parliamentary Peasant's Party (Talurahvaerakond), forming the new People's Party (Rahvaerakond). Toomas Hendrik Ilves was chosen as the first party leader. As the new party was unlikely to pass the Riigikogu threshold of 5%, it was soon decided to co-operate with possible partners. The People's Party decided to participate in the 1999 election as part of the Moderates' list, which led to a couple of nationalists leaving the party (e.g. Mart Nutt, who joined the Pro Patria Union list).
