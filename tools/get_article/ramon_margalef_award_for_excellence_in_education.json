Criteria for the award requires \"adherence to the highest standards of excellence\" in pedagogy as well as verification that the teaching techniques have furthered the field of aquatic science. The award is not affiliated with the Ramon Margalef Prize in Ecology, often referred to as the Ramon Margalef Award, given by the Generalitat de Catalunya in Barcelona. The award has been presented annually since 2009.\nWinners\nThe winners have included:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" rules=\"all\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; border: 1px solid #999; background-color: white\"\n|-----\n!
