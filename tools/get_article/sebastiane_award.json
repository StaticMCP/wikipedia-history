The goal intended, as it was already happening from 1987 on with the Teddy Award in the Berlinale, was that the prize would help gay-theme movies have more relevance in movies theatres as well as in mass media.\nKrámpack (Nico and Dani in English), from the film director Cesc Gay, was the first film awarded with Sebastiane Prize. The film reflected the sexual awakening of two teenagers, as one comes to terms with his homosexuality and the other with his heterosexuality. The jury of this edition was made up by the writer Luis G. Martin,  film critic Begoña del Teso, Angel Retamar from ZERO magazine, Gehitu members, Patricia García and David Montero.\nThe name given to the Award, \"Sebastiane\", honoured the film with the same name directed in 1976 by British Derek Jarman. It was his first film, in which he portrayed introspectively the Roman soldier Sebastian, martyr of Christianity, later a Middle Age Saint and eventually turned into a homoerotic icon.\nSaint Sebastian, patron saint of San Sebastián (Donostia), is a root symbol of the city itself,  venue of the Festival, but likewise it is too a symbol the homosexual culture itself. That serves a perfect picture to represent the Sebastiane Prize.\nAward\nThe Prize figurine was designed by Enrique Rojas. It represents the silhouette in metal of the image that traditionally has pictured San Sebastián martyr: a half naked body, which torso is pierced by arrows.\nWinners\n* 2000: Krámpack (Nico and Dani), by Cesc Gay.\n* 2001:  Le fate ignoranti (The Ignorant Fairies), by Ferzan Özpetek.\n* 2002:  Tani tatuwen piyabanna (Flying with one wing), by Asoka Handagama.\n* 2003:  Le soleil assassiné, by Abdelkrim Bahloul.\n* 2004:  Beautiful Boxer, by Ekachai Uekrongtham.\n* 2005:  Malas temporadas (Hard Times), by Manuel Martín Cuenca.\n* 2006:  Estrellas de la Línea (The Railroad All-Stars), by Chema Rodríguez.\n* 2007:  Caramel[http://www.laviedesfilms.com/actualite/palmares_san_sebastian2007.htm Palmarès du Festival de Cine de San Sebastián 2007 - La vie des films] by Nadine Labaki.\n* 2008:  Vicky Cristina Barcelona, by Woody Allen.\n* 2009:  Undertow (Contracorriente), by Javier Fuentes-León.\n* 2010:  80 egunean (For 80 Days), by José Mari Goenaga and Jon Garaño.[https://movie-on.blogspot.com/2010/09/58th-san-sebastian-international-film_25.html Movie On: 58th San Sebastian International Film Festival Awards Winners]\n* 2011: Albert Nobbs, by Rodrigo García.\n* 2012: Young & Wild, by Marialy Rivas.\n* 2013: Dallas Buyers Club, by Jean-Marc Vallée.\n* 2014: The New Girlfriend, by François Ozon.\n* 2015: Freeheld, by Peter Sollett.\n* 2016: In Between, by Maysaloun Hamoud.\n* 2017: BPM (Beats per Minute), by Robin Campillo.\n* 2018: Girl, by Lukas Dhont.\n* 2019: Monos, by Alejandro Landes.\n* 2020: Falling, by Viggo Mortensen.\n* 2021: The Power of the Dog, by Jane Campion\n* 2022: Something You Said Last Night, by Luis De Filippis\n* 2023: 20,000 Species of Bees, by Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren\n* 2024: Reas, by Lola Arias\nSebastiane Latino\nIn 2013, Sebastiane Latino becomes the second LGBT award given by Gehitu association during the San Sebastián Film Festival.
