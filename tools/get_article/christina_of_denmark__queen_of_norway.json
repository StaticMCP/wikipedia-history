Her marriage to Magnus was arranged by her maternal aunt, Malmfred, former Queen of Norway and the former stepmother of Magnus, and at the time the wife of Christina's paternal uncle Eric. Christina was engaged in 1131, and the marriage took place in 1132/33.\nKing Magnus supported the struggle of her father Canute and uncle Eric against King Niels of Denmark. In 1133, Eric and Malmfrid fled Denmark for Norway and the protection of Magnus. After Queen Christina, however, found out that Magnus had plans to betray them, she warned them, and Eric and Malmfrid allied themselves with Magnus' rival, Harald IV of Norway. King Magnus then separated from Queen Christina.\nChristina returned to Denmark, where the only remaining information about her is that she witnessed a document by king Eric Lam a couple of years later.\nReferences\nSources\n* Alf Henrikson: Dansk historia (Danish history) (1989) (Swedish)\n* Sven Rosborn (In Swedish): När hände vad i Nordens historia (When did what happen in the history of the Nordic countries) (1997)\n* Edvard Bull. »Magnus Blinde» I: Norsk biografisk leksikon, 1. utg.
