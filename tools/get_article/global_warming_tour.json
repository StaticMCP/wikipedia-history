We don't, because we're in the middle of it. This is Aerosmith, man. The second we get up there on stage, it's insane.\"\nPrior to the first leg, the band played a private event for Walmart shareholders. The first leg included 23 performances and lasted from late May through early August 2012.\nThe second leg included 14 performances in November and December 2012. Before the second leg, the band performed a brief set at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in mid September. Also prior to the second leg, to promote their new album in early November, the band played three nationally televised performances in New York City and did a special performance in front of their old Boston apartment.\nThe first two legs were held primarily in indoor arenas, with a couple outdoor shows and a few festivals on the first leg, including three in eastern Canada and Milwaukee's Summerfest.\nThe third leg of the tour ran from late April to mid May 2013 and saw Aerosmith playing their first shows in Australia since 1990, as well as their first shows in New Zealand and the Philippines. On May 30, the band played at the \"Boston Strong\" charity concert for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. In July 2013, the band played at the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia and at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. In August 2013, the band performed four concerts in Japan, but their first shows in China and Taiwan were cancelled due to poor ticket sales. The band performed in August at the Harley-Davidson 110th anniversary concert series in Milwaukee. Concerts were planned for Latin America in September and October, including their first shows in Uruguay, Guatemala and El Salvador.\nCheap Trick opened all dates on the first two legs bar a few festivals. The Dead Dasies, featuring Jon Stevens and Richard Fortus, opened the Australia/New Zealand leg. In Argentina and Brazil, Aerosmith toured with Whitesnake, including the Personal Fest in Buenos Aires and at the Monsters of Rock in São Paulo.\nThe tour promoted Music from Another Dimension!, released on November 6, 2012. In addition to hits and choice album cuts, the band performed four new songs from the album, three of them regularly (\"Oh Yeah\", \"Legendary Child\", and \"Lover Alot\").\nOn May 5, 2013, the band announced they had cancelled their first show in Jakarta due to safety concerns.\nIn 2014, Aerosmith played 17 concerts across Europe from May 14 to July 2. The Let Rock Rule Tour was scheduled to follow in July, August, and September 2014 and see Aerosmith play several dates in North America. This tour featured Slash (with Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators) as the opening act. Full details of the tour were announced on April 8, 2014. On May 14, 2014, the band announced that they had cancelled their concert in Istanbul after Turkey declared a three-day mourning for the victims of Soma mine disaster. The July 2, 2014 concert in Kyiv was cancelled due to civil unrest in Ukraine.\nStage setup\nThe stage was very close to the design of past tours. The main stage, occupying one end of the venue had the classic Aerosmith logo painted on top and two small platforms off to each side. Kramer's drums were at the back, Hamilton and Whitford were on the left side, and Perry was on the right side. The back-up musicians were at the back-left of the stage behind a stack of amps, the order usually went Melanie Taylor (backing vocals), Mindi Abair (saxophone and backing vocals) and Russ Irwin (keyboards and backing vocals). In the middle of the main stage was the catwalk, which ran through nine rows at each venue. At the end of the catwalk was a B-stage, which ran through the tenth row to the sixteenth row. Around the entire stage was a half-meter wide barricade that contained security and a few select fans.\nPerformance\nThe show would start with a video playing on the main video screen that was reminiscent of the original opening from The Outer Limits. Near the end of the video, smoke would arise from the end of the B-stage and from the main stage. When the video finished, Kramer, Whitford and Hamilton would kick into the opening song while Tyler and Perry would rise from a trapdoor at the end of the B-stage. For the first song, Tyler and Perry would stay on the B-stage and the rest of the band would stay on the main stage. After the first song finished, Hamilton, Whitford, Tyler and Perry would all go where they pleased. At \"What It Takes\", Tyler would look for an attractive girl to sing the opening lines, like in most tours. At the encore which was \"Dream On\" at every date, smoke would again appear from the end of the B-stage and Tyler on a white piano would appear from the same trapdoor as before. The piano had a few blocks beside it used as stairs by Perry and Tyler, as they would walk on top of the piano. They followed with a second encore – \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" – and at a few venues, a third encore was even played, either \"Mama Kin\" or \"Chip Away the Stone\". When the encores wrapped up, a few cannons fired silver confetti into the audience. After the confetti storm, Tyler would introduce the back-up musicians (Taylor, Abair and Irwin) and the members of Aerosmith. Finally, he would hand the microphone off to Perry, who would introduce Tyler. After the introductions, the band would walk out with \"Mannish Boy\" by Muddy Waters playing over the speakers.\n*Top 200 North American Tours 2012: #23\n*Total Gross: US $31 million\n*Total Attendance: 306,475 (33 concerts)\nTour dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!width=\"150\"|Date\n!width=\"150\"|City\n!width=\"150\"|Country\n!width=\"275\"|Venue\n!width=\"135\"|Attendance\n!width=\"125\"|Box Office\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\"|North America\n|-\n|June 16, 2012\n|Minneapolis\n|rowspan=\"3\"|United States\n|Target Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|June 19, 2012\n|Cleveland\n|Quicken Loans Arena\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|June 22, 2012\n|Chicago\n|United Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|June 27, 2012\n|Toronto\n|Canada\n|Air Canada Centre\n|13,177 / 13,177\n|$1,598,920\n|-\n|June 29, 2012\n|Albany\n|rowspan=\"4\"|United States\n|Times Union Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|July 1, 2012\n|Uniondale\n|Nassau Coliseum\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|July 5, 2012\n|Auburn Hills\n|The Palace of Auburn Hills\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|July 7, 2012\n|Milwaukee\n|Marcus Amphitheater\n|rowspan=\"4\"\n|rowspan=\"4\"\n|-\n|July 10, 2012\n|Laval\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Canada\n|Centre de la Nature\n|-\n|July 12, 2012\n|Quebec City\n|Plains of Abraham\n|-\n|July 14, 2012\n|Grand Falls\n|Centennial Park\n|-\n|July 17, 2012\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Boston\n|rowspan=\"19\"|United States\n|rowspan=\"2\"|TD Garden\n|rowspan=\"2\"| —\n|rowspan=\"2\"| —\n|-\n|July 19, 2012\n|-\n|July 21, 2012\n|Philadelphia\n|Wells Fargo Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|July 24, 2012\n|East Rutherford\n|Izod Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|July 26, 2012\n|Atlanta\n|Philips Arena\n|13,045 / 13,045\n|$1,309,188\n|-\n|July 28, 2012\n|Dallas\n|American Airlines Center\n|12,633 / 12,633\n|$1,391,440\n|-\n|July 30, 2012\n|Houston\n|Toyota Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|August 1, 2012\n|Denver\n|Pepsi Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|August 4, 2012\n|Oakland\n|Oracle Arena\n|11,073 / 12,296\n|$1,182,915\n|-\n|August 6, 2012\n|Los Angeles\n|Hollywood Bowl\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|August 8, 2012\n|Tacoma\n|Tacoma Dome\n|13,968 / 13,968\n|$1,253,120\n|-\n|August 12, 2012\n|Bristow\n|Jiffy Lube Live\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|November 8, 2012\n|Oklahoma City\n|Chesapeake Energy Arena\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|November 11, 2012\n|Wichita\n|Intrust Bank Arena\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|November 14, 2012\n|Kansas City\n|Sprint Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|November 16, 2012\n|Austin\n|Frank Erwin Center\n|8,816 / 11,977\n|$1,219,161\n|-\n|November 20, 2012\n|New York City\n|Madison Square Garden\n|11,894 / 13,173\n|$1,014,769\n|-\n|November 23, 2012\n|Atlantic City\n|Ovation Hall\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|November 25, 2012\n|Columbus\n|Nationwide Arena\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|November 27, 2012\n|Toronto\n|Canada\n|Air Canada Centre\n|7,225 / 8,100\n|$763,809\n|-\n|December 1, 2012\n|Paradise\n|rowspan=\"6\"|United States\n|MGM Grand Garden Arena\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|December 3, 2012\n|Los Angeles\n|Staples Center\n|10,858 / 13,401\n|$983,992\n|-\n|December 6, 2012\n|New Orleans\n|New Orleans Arena\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|December 9, 2012\n|Sunrise\n|BB&T Center\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|December 11, 2012\n|Tampa\n|Tampa Bay Times Forum\n|8,817 / 10,476\n|$873,223\n|-\n|December 13, 2012\n|Nashville\n|Bridgestone Arena\n| —\n| —\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#DFDFDF;\"|Australasia\n|-\n|April 20, 2013\n|Sydney\n|Australia\n|ANZ Stadium\n|\n|\n|-\n|April 24, 2013\n|Dunedin\n|New Zealand\n|Forsyth Barr Stadium\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|April 28, 2013\n|Melbourne\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Australia\n|Sidney Myer Music Bowl\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|May 1, 2013\n|Brisbane\n|Brisbane Entertainment Centre\n|8,095 / 8,370\n|$1,044,930\n|-\n|May 4, 2013\n|Melbourne\n|Rod Laver Arena\n|8,767 / 10,500\n|$1,539,700\n|-\n|May 8, 2013\n|Pasay\n|Philippines\n|Mall of Asia Arena\n| —\n| —\n|-\n|May 25, 2013\n|colspan=\"2\"|Singapore\n|The Meadow -

The song hadn't been played anywhere since 1974.\n*Aerosmith had to reschedule their show in Bristow, Virginia, because of reported voice problems by Tyler. Originally scheduled for July 3, it was moved to August 12. A difficult political situation in Ukraine meant the show in Kyiv was moved from May 21 to July 2, 2014.\n*Jesse Sky Kramer joined his father on percussion for many songs at every show.\n*This is the first tour where Aerosmith utilised back-up singers other than Russ Irwin.\n*Tyler joined Kramer on drums during \"Combination\" at every date.\n*At a few shows, saxophonist and back-up singer Mindi Abair jammed with Kramer during his drum solo.\n*On some nights Whitford played guitar and provided backing vocals on \"Ain't That a Shame\" or \"Surrender\" with opening act Cheap Trick. On other nights, Tyler would run out during \"I Want You to Want Me\", play with Trick bassist Tom Petersson and guitarist Rick Nielsen, help sing the chorus, then quickly exit.\n*Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin guested on \"Mama Kin\" at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n*Russ Irwin, Aerosmith keyboardist, occasionally performed the \"Abbey Road Medley\" (originally by The Beatles) with Cheap Trick during their set.\n*At the Sunrise, Florida, show on 12/09, longtime Aerosmith collaborator Richie Supa guested on \"Chip Away the Stone\".\n*On the 11/27 Toronto show, Aerosmith performed \"Red House\" as an homage to Jimi Hendrix on what would have been his seventieth birthday.\n*Before the Melbourne show, Hamilton suffered a chest infection and was flown home. David Hull from the Joe Perry Project was flown in from the United States to play in his place. Hamilton was set to return with the band after the Australian dates.\n*\"Throughout tonight's two-hour show,\" noted Classic Rock of June 27's Toronto fixture, \"the singer heaps generous praise on his bandmates, and name-checks (rather than hip-checks) Perry so many times that it borders on idolatry… Intoxicating stuff.\"\nList of songs played\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
