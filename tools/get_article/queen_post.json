      "text": "# Queen post\n\nA queen post is a tension member in a truss that can span longer openings than a king post truss. A king post uses one central supporting post, whereas the queen post truss uses two. Even though it is a tension member, rather than a compression member, they are commonly still called a post. A queen post is often confused with a queen strut, one of two compression members in roof framing which do not form a truss in the engineering sense.\nThe double punch truss appeared in Central Europe during the Renaissance.\nArchitecture\nA queen-post bridge has two uprights, placed about one-third of the way from each end of the truss. They are connected across the top by a beam and use a diagonal brace between the outer edges. The central square between the two verticals is either unbraced (on shorter spans), or has one or two diagonal braces for rigidity. A single diagonal reaches between opposite corners; two diagonal braces may either reach from the bottom of each upright post to the center of the upper beam, or form a corner-to-corner \"X\" inside the square.\nSee also\n* Timber roof trusses\n* Timber framing\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://pghbridges.com/basics.htm Bridge Basics]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080320002055/http://www4.bfn.org/bah/a/DCTNRY/q/queen.html Queen post]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2iXgby0Ffg King Post Truss vs Queen Post Truss] via YouTube"
