The Mendip district covers a largely rural area of  ranging from the Mendip Hills through on to the Somerset Levels. It has a population of approximately 110,000. The administrative centre of the district is Shepton Mallet but the largest town (with more than twice the population of Shepton Mallet) is Frome.\nA scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \"schedule\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; Historic England takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \"monument\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War.\nThere are 234 scheduled monuments in Mendip. These include a large number of bowl and round barrows and other neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age tumuli such as the Priddy Circles and Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. There are also several Iron Age hill forts on the hill tops and lake villages on the lowlands such as Meare and Glastonbury Lake Villages. The lake villages were often connected by timber trackways such as the Sweet Track. There are several Roman sites particularly around the Charterhouse Roman Town and lead mining. Some later coal mining sites are also included in the list.\nTwo major religious sites in Mendip at Glastonbury Abbey and Wells Cathedral and their precincts and dispersed residences, tithe barns and The Abbot's Fish House, are included in the list. Prehistoric defensive features such as Ponter's Ball Dyke were supplemented in the medieval period by motte-and-bailey castles such as Farleigh Hungerford, Nunney and Fenny Castle. Commercial and industrial development is represented by the Old Iron Works at Mells and various market crosses. The most recent site on the list is a World War II bombing decoy complex and anti-aircraft obstructions, which were built in 1940, on Black Down, the highest point of the Mendip Hills. The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the Historic England data sheets.\nMonuments\n|- class=\"vcard without_image\"\n! scope=\"row\" class=\"fn org\" | An area of the Romano-British linear village at Fosse Lane, Shepton Mallet\n| class=\"label\" | Shepton Mallet || class=\"category\" | Earthworks ||   || || Earthworks from a Romano-British village next to the Fosse Way.\n| || style=\"vertical-align:center; text-align:center;\"  ||\n|- class=\"vcard with_image\"\n! scope=\"row\" class=\"fn org\" | Ashen Hill barrow cemetery: a group of eight round barrows 500&nbsp;m southeast of Harptree Lodge\n| class=\"label\" | Priddy || class=\"category\" | Round barrows ||   || || Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries are a collection of round barrows, dating from the Bronze Age. The barrows sit on crests of land at either end of a field in an area of the Mendip Hills with several Neolithic remains. They are assumed to be related to the Priddy Circles which lie  to the north. Ashen Hill consists of six bowl barrows and two bell barrows aligned east to west while Priddy Nine Barrows divided into one group of seven round barrows and another pair slightly separated from the others. Excavations in 1815 uncovered cremation burials and grave goods. A geophysical magnetometry survey suggested that there may have been three further barrows.\n| || ]]||\n|- class=\"vcard without_image\"\n! scope=\"row\" class=\"fn org\" | Badger Hole, Wookey\n| class=\"label\" | St Cuthbert Out || class=\"category\" | Cave ||   || || Badger Hole is a dry cave on the slopes above the Wookey ravine near the Wookey Hole Caves resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during the Ice Age.

Building of the palace started around 1210 by Bishops Jocelin of Wells and Reginald Fitz Jocelin. The chapel and great hall were added by Bishop Robert Burnell between 1275 and 1292. The walls, gatehouse and moat were added in the 14th century by Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury. The Bishops House was added in the 15th century by Bishop Thomas Beckington. The great hall later fell into disrepair and was partially demolished around 1830. The palace was originally surrounded by a medieval deer park. When the walls were built, streams were diverted to form the moat as a reservoir. In the 1820s, the grounds within the walls were planted and laid out as pleasure grounds by Bishop George Henry Law, who created a reflecting pond near the springs. Parts of the buildings are still used as a residence by the current bishop, however much of the palace is now used for public functions and as a tourist attraction.\n| || ]]||\n|- class=\"vcard with_image\"\n! scope=\"row\" class=\"fn org\" | Bishop's tithe barn\n| class=\"label\" | Wells || class=\"category\" | Tithe barn ||   || || Local stone roughly squared, with Doulting ashlar dressings and a Westmorland slate roof.

The last abbot, Richard Whiting (Whyting), was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor in 1539. From at least the 12th century the Glastonbury area was frequently associated with the legend of King Arthur, a connection promoted by medieval monks who asserted that Glastonbury was Avalon.

The history of the building is not well documented, although the majority of the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century wooden building. The current front wall was added in the 16th century. It has been used as a merchant's house and possibly a shop and school. The building is currently in the guardianship of English Heritage and used as a tourist information centre. On the first floor is the museum of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society which houses artefacts from Glastonbury Lake Village.\n| || ]]||\n|- class=\"vcard without_image\"\n! scope=\"row\" class=\"fn org\" | Three bowl barrows at Green Ore, two 150&nbsp;m south east and one 420&nbsp;m south west of Newlands Farm\n| class=\"label\" | St Cuthbert Out || class=\"category\" | Bowl barrow ||   || || Three bowl barrows each around  in diameter.\n| || style=\"vertical-align:center; text-align:center;\"  ||\n|- class=\"vcard without_image\"\n! scope=\"row\" class=\"fn org\" | Three bowl barrows 400&nbsp;m north west of Haydon Hut\n| class=\"label\" | St Cuthbert Out || class=\"category\" | Bowl barrow ||   || || A bowl barrow which is  in diameter.\n| || style=\"vertical-align:center; text-align:center;\"  ||\n|- class=\"vcard without_image\"\n! scope=\"row\" class=\"fn org\" | Three bowl barrows in Big Plantation, 690&nbsp;m south west of Beechbarrow\n| class=\"label\" | St Cuthbert Out || class=\"category\" | Bowl barrow ||   || || Three bowl barrows each around  in diameter.\n| || style=\"vertical-align:center; text-align:center;\"  ||\n|- class=\"vcard with_image\"\n! scope=\"row\" class=\"fn org\" | Three of the Priddy Circles and one barrow, 400&nbsp;m west of Castle Farm\n| class=\"label\" | Priddy || class=\"category\" | Earthwork and enclosures ||   || || Priddy Circles are a linear arrangement of four circular earthwork enclosures.
