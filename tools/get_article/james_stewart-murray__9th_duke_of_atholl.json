He was educated at Eton and commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders on 3 January 1900. The following month, he left for South Africa to fight in the Second Boer War. With his battalion, he took part in operations in the Transvaal May and June 1900, including action near Johannesburg and Pretoria (early June 1900) and the Battle of Diamond Hill (11–12 June 1900); and in the Orange River Colony June to November 1900, including action at Wittebergen and Ladybrand. He was promoted to lieutenant on 29 May 1901, and subsequently seconded to serve with the 2nd Regiment of Scottish Horse, a yeomanry regiment raised from troops recruited by his father. For his service in the war, he was mentioned in dispatches and won two medals and six clasps. After the end of the war in South Africa in June 1902, he returned in January 1903 to his regiment.\nHe later fought in the First World War, where he was wounded, captured, and held as a Prisoner of War. He resigned from the army as a major. He became a Freemason in Lodge St. John, No. 14 (now the United Lodge of Dunkeld) at the same time as his elder brother George in 1914. In 1942, aged 62, he succeeded his elder brother John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl in the dukedom.\nAtholl died unmarried in May 1957, aged 77. On his death, the barony of Strange fell into abeyance while the barony of Percy was passed on to his kinsman Hugh Percy, 10th Duke of Northumberland. The baronies of Murray and Glenlyon and earldom of Strange became extinct. He was succeeded in the dukedom of Atholl and in other Scottish titles by a distant relative, Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl, his fourth cousin twice removed, who was descended from George Murray, Bishop of St David's, second son of the eighteenth century 3rd Duke.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n|-"
