He was feudal baron of Bampton in Devon.\nOrigins\nFulk Bourchier was the eldest son and heir of William Bourchier, 9th Baron FitzWarin (1407–1470) by his wife Thomasine Hankford, a  daughter and coheiress of Sir Richard Hankford (c. 1397 – 1431) of Annery, Devon, feudal baron of Bampton.\nMarriage and issue\n, Devon, sometimes shown with a chevron or between the dovecotes (Vivian, p.677, pedigree of Shapcott of Shapcott) impaling Dinham Gules, four fusils in fess ermine (quartering Arches Gules, three arches argent), Bampton Church]]\nFulk Bourchier married Elizabeth Dynham (died 19 October 1516), the daughter of Sir John Dinham  (1406–1458) of Nutwell by his wife Joan Arches (died 1497), and sister and coheir of John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham (died 1501). After the death of Fulk Bourchier, Elizabeth Dynham remarried twice, firstly to Sir John Sapcotes (died 1501) of Elton, Huntingdonshire; a stained glass heraldic escutcheon survives in Bampton church showing the arms of Sapcotes impaling Dinham. After the death of Sapcotes, Elizabeth Dynham remarried secondly to Sir Thomas Brandon (died 27 January 1510) of Duddington, Northamptonshire. There was no issue of Elizabeth Dynham's marriage to Thomas Brandon, and according to Gunn, after his death she took a vow of celibacy before Bishop Fisher on 21 April 1510. She died 19 October 1516, and was buried in the Greyfriars, London.\nBy Elizabeth Dynham, Fulk Bourchier had the following children:\n*John Bourchier, 1st Earl of Bath (20 July 1470 – 30 April 1539)\n*Joan Bourchier (died 3 March 1532), second wife of James Tuchet, 7th Baron Audley, who was beheaded 28 June 1497 on Tower Hill for his part in the Cornish rebellion, and buried at the Blackfriars, London.\n*Elizabeth Bourchier (before 1473 – 8 August 1557) who married, as his second wife, Sir Edward Stanhope (1462 – 6 June 1511), by whom she was the mother of Anne Stanhope (c. 1497 – 1587), the second wife of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (c. 1500 – 1552), brother of Queen Jane Seymour, uncle of King Edward VI and Lord Protector of England.
