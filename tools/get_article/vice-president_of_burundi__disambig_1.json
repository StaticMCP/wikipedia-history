It replaced the post of Prime Minister.\nHistory of the office\nInterim period (1998–2001)\nPierre Buyoya, a former president (1987–1993) who seized power in a 1996 military coup, was sworn in as president of the Republic on 11 June 1998. He appointed Frédéric Bamvuginyumvira, a Hutu member of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), as 1st vice-president. Mathias Sinamenye, a Tutsi member of Buyoya's Union for National Progress (UPRONA) party, was appointed 2nd vice-president.\nAccording to the transitional constitution, the vice-presidency consisted of two posts: The 1st vice-president (Responsible for political and administrative affairs) and the 2nd vice-president (Responsible for economic and social affairs).\nTransitional period (2001–2005)\nA new transitional power-sharing government took office on 1 November 2001. Interim president Pierre Buyoya became transitional president for a period of 18 months. At the end of his term in 2003, Hutu vice-president Domitien Ndayizeye took office and appointed a Tutsi (Alphonse-Marie Kadege) as vice-president. In November 2004, Kadege was sacked as vice-president and replaced by Frédéric Ngenzebuhoro. Although Ndayizeye's term was due to end in late 2004 following elections, the transitional period was extended and planned elections were delayed. Elections were held in mid-2005 and the transitional period is due to end on 26 August 2005, when the newly elected president takes office.\nVice-presidency 2005–2018\nBurundi's new constitution, approved in a 28 February 2005 constitutional referendum, calls for a two-member vice-presidency (similar to that of the interim period). The 1st vice-president will be responsible for political and administrative affairs, while the 2nd vice-president will handle social and economic affairs. One vice-president will be an ethnic Hutu and the other a Tutsi. Nominees must be approved by both chambers of parliament in order to take office.\nOn 29 August 2005, President Pierre Nkurunziza nominated Martin Nduwimana and Alice Nzomukunda for the posts of 1st and 2nd vice-president. Both received approval from parliament and were immediately sworn in. Nzomukunda resigned on 5 September 2006. She was replaced by Marina Barampama two days later.\nIn February 2007, Barampama was replaced by Gabriel Ntisezerana. In November 2007, Nduwimana was replaced by Yves Sahinguvu.\nIn August 2010, Sahinguvu was replaced by Therence Sinunguruza and Ntisezerana was replaced by Gervais Rufyikiri.\nVice-presidency since 2018\nNew constitutional amendments were approved in a 17 May 2018 constitutional referendum. The post of second vice-president will be abolished. The remaining vice-president, who will have limited powers, will be selected from a political party and ethnic group that differs from those of the president.\nKey\n;Political parties\n*|Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n*|Union for National Progress (UPRONA)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n*|National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD–FDD)|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\nList of officeholders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!rowspan=2|Name\n!rowspan=2|Portrait\n!colspan=3|Term of office\n!rowspan=2|Ethnic group\n!rowspan=2 colspan=2|Political party\n!rowspan=2|President(s)\n|-\n!Took office\n!Left office\n!Time in office\n|-\n| Frédéric Bamvuginyumvira\n|\n| rowspan=2| 11 June 1998\n| rowspan=2| 1 November 2001\n| rowspan=2|\n| Hutu\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| FRODEBU\n| Buyoya\n|-\n| Mathias Sinamenye\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Buyoya\n|-\n| Domitien Ndayizeye\n|\n| 1 November 2001\n| 30 April 2003\n|\n| Hutu\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| FRODEBU\n| Buyoya\n|-\n| Alphonse-Marie Kadege\n|\n| 30 April 2003\n| 11 November 2004\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Ndayizeye\n|-\n| Frédéric Ngenzebuhoro\n|\n| 11 November 2004\n| 29 August 2005\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Ndayizeye\n|-\n| Martin Nduwimana\n|\n| rowspan=2| 29 August 2005\n| 7 November 2007\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Alice Nzomukunda\n|\n| 5 September 2006\n|\n| Hutu\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| CNDD–FDD\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Marina Barampama\n|\n| 7 September 2006\n| 8 February 2007\n|\n| Hutu\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| CNDD–FDD\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Gabriel Ntisezerana\n|\n| 12 February 2007\n| 28 August 2010\n|\n| Hutu\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| CNDD–FDD\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Yves Sahinguvu\n|\n| 8 November 2007\n| August 2010\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Thérence Sinunguruza\n|\n| 28 August 2010\n| October 2013\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Bernard Busokoza\n|\n| October 2013\n| 1 February 2014\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Prosper Bazombanza\n|\n| 14 February 2014\n| 20 August 2015\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Gervais Rufyikiri\n|\n| 28 August 2010\n| 20 August 2015\n|\n| Hutu\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| CNDD–FDD\n| Nkurunziza\n|-\n| Gaston Sindimwo\n|\n| rowspan=2| 20 August 2015\n| rowspan=2| 23 June 2020\n| rowspan=2|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| NkurunzizaNdayishimiye\n|-\n| Joseph Butore\n|\n| Hutu\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| CNDD–FDD\n| NkurunzizaNdayishimiye\n|-\n| Prosper Bazombanza\n|\n| 23 June 2020\n| Incumbent\n|\n| Tutsi\n! style=\"background: ;\" |\n| UPRONA\n| Ndayishimiye\n|}\nSee also\n*Burundi\n**Politics of Burundi\n**List of kings of Burundi\n**President of Burundi\n***List of presidents of Burundi\n**Prime Minister of Burundi\n**List of colonial governors of Ruanda-Urundi\n***List of colonial residents of Burundi\n**Martyazo\n*Lists of Incumbents\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://burundi.news.free.fr/actualites/constitutionbu.html Constitution of Burundi (In French)]"
