It was released by Arista Records on September 28, 1982, in the United States. Her fifth album with the label, it was largely written by Barry Gibb and produced by Gibb, Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson;  Gibb and Galuten also served as musicians on the album. Warwick recorded the songs on Heartbreaker during the spring of 1982.\nHeartbreaker was released two years after Barry Gibb had written and co-produced the hugely successful album Guilty for Barbra Streisand. While their own careers as a band were now in decline (following the poorly received Living Eyes album in 1981), the brothers and Gibb-Galuten-Richardson production team now employed the same tactics that had made Streisand's album such a phenomenal success, but this time for Dionne Warwick. They would later go on to further successful collaborations with Kenny Rogers in 1983 and Diana Ross in 1985, before the Bee Gees experienced renewed success as a band themselves in the late 1980s.\nThe Heartbreaker  album sold an estimated three million copies worldwide and ranks as Warwick's highest-charting album in most international territories. It hit number one on the Norwegian Albums Chart and reached the top five in Sweden, the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands, also entering the top 20 in Austria, Germany, and on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. In the US, Heartbreaker was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales in excess of 500,000 copies.\nThe title track, the album's lead single, reached the top of charts around the world and stands as one of Warwick's biggest career hits, reaching number one in Poland, Portugal, Sweden and on the US Adult Contemporary chart. The following two singles were \"Take the Short Way Home\" and \"All the Love in the World\", the latter of which reached the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. The Heartbreaker Demos, a collection of Barry Gibb's demos, was released in 2006.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAllMusic editor Rob Theakston found that \"while it lacks the genius and soulful grit of Dionne Warwick's earlier classic work, the album was polished and painstakingly produced perfectly for adult pop stations [...] Starting off with a bang courtesy of the title track, Warwick and Gibb go through all of the motions [...] This is not the most definitive album of Warwick's career, but is definitely one of the few highlights that a pop-heavy '80s afforded her.\"\nTrack listing\nAll tracks produced by Gibb-Galuten-Richardson.
