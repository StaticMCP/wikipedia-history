The tour also featured the whole of The Dark Side of the Moon album played as well as one of the final performances of \"Echoes\" before being resurrected briefly in 1987; this performance of \"Echoes\" is notable for featuring saxophone performed by Dick Parry.\nThe show was recorded by the BBC and broadcast on BBC Radio 1 (Dark Side set only), on 11 January 1975 as part of Alan Freeman's programme.\nThe tracks on the Wish You Were Here Immersion box set were recorded on 15 November 1974.
