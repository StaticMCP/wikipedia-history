The area has no formally defined boundaries – those utilised here are: the river Thames to the north, Tower Bridge Road to the east, Bricklayers Arms/New Kent Road/Elephant and Castle to the south, and London Road/St George's Circus/Blackfriars Road to the west.\nA\n* Abbey Street – after Bermondsey Abbey, formerly located here\n* Alderney Mews\n* Alice Street\n* America Street\n* Angel Place – formerly Angel Alley, both after a former inn here of this name\n* Arch Street\n* Archie Street\n* Avon Place\n* Avonmouth Street – unknown; formerly Devonshire Street\n* Ayres Street – after Alice Ayres, local resident who died whilst saving the lives of three children in a house fire in 1885\nB\n* Baden Place\n* Bank End and Bankside – both after former earthen banks built to protect against the Thames\n* Barnham Street\n* Bartholomew Street – after a former hospital located near here run by St Bartholomew's Hospital\n* Bath Terrace\n* Battle Bridge Lane – after medieval landowners the abbots of Battle\n* Bear Gardens and Bear Lane – both after the sport of bear baiting formerly practised here\n* Becket Street – after Thomas Becket, murdered Archbishop of Canterbury, by association with the pilgrims who went this way to Canterbury\n* Bedale Street – after Bedale, Yorkshire; it was formerly York Street after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany but was changed in 1891 to avoid confusion with similarly named streets; further back still it was Foul Lane, a descriptive epithet\n* Bedford Row\n* Bell Yard Mews\n* Belvedere Buildings and Belvedere Place\n* Bermondsey Square and Bermondsey Street – understood to mean 'Beornmund's island'; but, while \"Beornmund\" represents an Old English personal name, identifying an individual once associated with the place, the element \"-ey\" represents Old English \"eg\", for \"island\", \"piece of firm land in a fen\", or simply a \"place by a stream or river\". Thus Bermondsey need not have been an island as such in the Anglo-Saxon period, and is as likely to have been a higher, drier spot in an otherwise marshy area.\n* Bickels Yard\n* Bittern Street\n* Blackfriars Road – named after Blackfriars Bridge in 1769/70;
