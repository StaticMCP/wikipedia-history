As New Jersey's largest city, Newark played a major role in New Jersey's journalistic history.  At its apex, The News was widely regarded as the newspaper of record in New Jersey.   For much of its life it had the largest circulation of any New Jersey newspaper, and in 1963 was the 20th ranked national newspaper by evening circulation numbers. The Newark News has been digitized by the Newark Public Library and Advantage Archives.\nHistory\nThe News was founded in 1883 by Wallace Scudder, with the first issue published Sept 1, 1883.  The grandson of Wallace Scudder, Richard Scudder, worked as the newspaper's publisher from 1952 until 1972.\nFor years, the paper thrived as a daily and Sunday paper.  It had bureaus in Montclair, Elizabeth, Metuchen, Morristown, Plainfield, Kearny, and Belmar.  There were also bureaus in the New Jersey State House in Trenton and in Washington, D.C.  The paper had had five editorial writers, an editorial cartoonist, a military writer, an aviation writer, and a Sunday magazine.\nIn 1970, the paper was sold to Media General. In February 1971, the newsroom, which had never been organized, voted to go out on strike and walked out in May 1971, which was supported by labor leaders around the state.\nThe strike lasted almost a full year — not settling until April 1972. It faced increasing competition from the Newark Star-Ledger, and for its final four months, the daily editions of the Newark Evening News were printed on Star-Ledger presses. That was because the paper's new owners had sold the presses, along with the Sunday News edition, to the Star-Ledger.\nThe paper folded on August 31, 1972.\nThe former headquarters of the paper in Downtown Newark at 215-217 Market St (or 111 Mulberry) is now a residential condominium.\nHistoric research\nSince its demise, the Newark Public Library acquired the paper's records. The Charles F. Cummings New Jersey Information Center at Newark Public Library owns the News's indices and clippings files, as well as a full run of microfilm. They have digitized the paper up through 1972.\nDistinguished Newark Evening News alumni\n*John T. Cunningham, prolific and wide-ranging writer on the history of New Jersey.\n* Lloyd M.
