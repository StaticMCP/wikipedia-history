He then taught at Sedbergh School, Doncaster Grammar School (1866–1876) and Stubbington House School. He collected extensively in the British Isles, notably at Wicken Fen, with a special interest in Micro-lepidoptera. After giving up teaching in 1882, he lived in Cambridge and devoted himself fully to entomology, publishing around 40 papers on British moths between 1878 and 1889. Notably, in 1887 he was the first to recognise Grapholita pallifrontana (Lienig & Zeller) (Lep: Tortricidae) as a British species of micro-moth, a species which now has the English name the Liquorice Piercer and is of conservation concern. Later in the same year he successfully bred the moth and described its larvae. In 1888, he moved to Chelsea, London, where he worked as a professional entomologist on Pyralidae and Geometridae in the British Museum (Natural History) and later, by the intervention of Albert Günther, for the Tring Museum, publishing over 80 more papers (partial list below). Warren made collecting trips to the Punjab, Brazil and Japan.\nHe was a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society of London 1886–1914.\nWorks\npartial list\n* 1894 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/24566#/summary New genera and species of Geometridae.
