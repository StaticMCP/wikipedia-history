Throughout the region, it is common to find limestone rock masses, caves grooved with small water courses and deep vertical tops.\nThe Morros de Macaira Natural Monument is located in the municipality of José Tadeo Monagas. The western boundary of the monument is determined by the road that connects Altagracia de Orituco with San Francisco de Macaira.\nIts main attraction is the calcareous formation of great paleontological and environmental value. It is constituted by three massifs, which lodge numerous caves crossed by fluvial torrents.\nThe vegetation is composed mainly of semideciduous forests and semideciduous thickets in the montane forest region of the mountain range of the coast of Venezuela.\nSee also\n*List of national parks of Venezuela\n*Laguna de Las Marites Natural Monument\nReferences"
