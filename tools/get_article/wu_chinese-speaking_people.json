Small Christian minorities.\n|related = Other Han Chinese subgroups\n}}\nThe Wu Chinese people, also known as Wuyue people (, Shanghainese: ), Jiang-Zhe people () or San Kiang (), are a major subgroup of the Han Chinese. They are a Wu Chinese-speaking people who hail from southern Jiangsu Province, the entirety of the city of Shanghai and all of Zhejiang Province, as well as smaller populations in Xuancheng prefecture-level city in southern Anhui Province, Shangrao, Guangfeng and Yushan counties of northeastern Jiangxi Province and some parts of Pucheng County in northern Fujian Province.\nHistory\nOrigins\nFor much of its history and prehistory, the Wuyue region has been home to several neolithic cultures such as the Hemudu culture, Majiabang culture and the Liangzhu culture. Both Wu and Yue were two kingdoms during the Zhou dynasty and many such allusions to those kingdoms were attributed in the Spring and Autumn Annals, the Zuo Zhuan and the Guoyu. Later, after years of fighting and conflict, the two cultures of Wu and Yue became one culture through mutual contact and cultural diffusion. The Chu state from the west (in Hubei) expanded into this area and defeated the Yue state.\nAfter Chu was conquered by Qin, China was unified. It was not until the fall of Western Jin during the early 4th century AD that northern Chinese moved to Jiangnan in significant numbers. The Yellow River valley was becoming barren due to flooding, lack of trees after intensive logging to create farmland and constant warfare during the upheaval of the Five Barbarians.\nIn the 10th century, Wuyue (Ten Kingdoms) was a small coastal kingdom founded by Qian Liu who made a lasting cultural impact on Jiangnan and its people to this day. The cultural distinctiveness that began developing over this period persists to this day as the Wuyue region speaks a branch of the Chinese language called Wu (the most famous dialect of which is Shanghainese), has distinctive cuisine and other cultural traits.\nThere have been many periods of mass-migrations to Wuyue areas from Northern China, sometimes overtaking the local Wuyue population. One notable example of this was when the Song dynasty fell in the north, large numbers of northern refugees flooded into the relocated capital Hangzhou mainly from the areas that are currently under the administration of modern-day Henan Province. Within just 30 years, contemporary accounts record that these Northern immigrants outnumbered the Wu natives of Hangzhou, altering the city's spoken dialect and culture.\nSubgroups\n*Shanghainese people\n*Wenzhou people\nCulture\nin Suzhou.]]\nEducation\nTraditionally, in the past, Wuyue people dominated the imperial examinations and were often ranked first in the imperial examinations as Zhuangyuan (), or in other positions of the Jinshi () degree. The Wu speaking region produced 59 out of 114 Zhuangyuan scholars during the Ming and Qing dynasty, and 10427 out of 51444 Jinshi scholars, despite currently only constituting 6% of China's population. Amongst the 2331 scholars promoted to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering since the institutions' establishment from 1955, over 30% are Wuyue people, with 450 are from Jiangsu, 375 are from Zhejiang, 84 are from Shanghai. In addition, 5 out of 12 Nobel laureates who are of Chinese descent are Wuyue people, including Tsung Dao Lee, Charles Kao, Steven Chu, Roger Tsien and Youyou Tu.\nLanguages\n*Changzhou dialect\n*Hangzhou dialect\n*Huzhou dialect\n*Jinhua dialect\n*Ningbo dialect\n*Shanghainese dialect\n*Shaoxing dialect\n*Suzhou dialect\n*Wenzhounese dialect\n*Wuxi dialect\nMusic\n*Jiangnan sizhu\n*Suzhou Pingtan (originated from Suzhou)\nOpera\nKunqu and Yue opera are amongst the most popular form of traditional opera in China, second to Peking Opera only.\n*Kunqu\n*Yue opera\n*Shanghai opera\n*Yongju, or Ningbo opera\nLiterature\n*Wo Bau-Sae\n*Butterfly Lovers ()\n*Legend of the White Snake ()\n*Dream of the Red Chamber\nPhilosophy and Religion\n*Yangming school of Neo-Confucianism\n*Tiantai school of Mahayana Buddhism\nArchitecture Heritage Sites\n*Tianyi Chamber\n*The Classical Gardens in Suzhou\nCultural Items\n*Silk, Jiangnan is the largest silk-producing region in China.

This study also suggests that Wu-speaking peoples genetically, bridge the gap between Northern Han and Southern Han populations and thus are an intermediate between both populations. Even though Wu-speaking peoples form a genetic cluster, DNA analyses also show that Wu-speaking peoples are genetically coherent with other Han Chinese populations.\nNotable Wu Chinese speakers\nScientists and inventors\nFile:Shen_Kua_sketch.jpg|Shen Kuo, a brilliant polymathic scientist and mathematician of the Song dynasty.\nFile:Tsien_Hsue-shen.jpg|Qian Xuesen, the father of Chinese space program.\nFile:TD_Lee.jpg|Tsung-Dao Lee, one of the first two Chinese Nobel prize laureates in Physics.\nChien-Shiung_Wu_(1912-1997)_in_1958.jpg|Chien-Shiung Wu, the first recipient of the Wolf Prize in Physics.\nTu_Youyou_5012-1-2015.jpg|Tu Youyou, the first Chinese Nobel prize laureate in Physiology or Medicine.\n*Shen Kuo (1031–1095), a brilliant polymathic scientist and mathematician of the Song dynasty.\n*Xu Guangqi (1562–1633), Chinese mathematician, agricultural scientist, astronomer, and scholar-bureaucrat under the Ming dynasty.\n*Wang Ganchang (1907–1998), one of the founding fathers of Chinese nuclear physics, cosmic rays and particle physics.\n*Tan Jiazhen (1909–2008), Chinese geneticist and the main founder of modern Chinese genetics.\n*Qian Xuesen (1911–2009), the father of Chinese space program, Qian was praised by Theodore von Kármán who said that Qian \"answered my questions with unusual precision.
