According to the current constitution, the president and vice-presidents are elected in the same ticket. From 1957 to 2006 and from 2010 onwards there are positions of first, second, and third vice-president commonly known as the presidential designates ().\nOnly during the Zelaya administration the vice-presidential position was held by one person, since the Congress reformed the Constitution in 2008 for that the vice-presidential charge would be held again by three persons. The position of vice president commissioner was created by former President Manuel Zelaya after Vice President Elvin Santos resigned in late 2008.\nFunctions and duties\nThe only constitutional duty of the vice presidents involves performing the functions of the president in their absence, usually due to incapacitation (one of the vice presidents is selected by the president to serve in the role on an temporary basis until the president's return). If the absence is considered to be permanent, then one of the three vicepresidents, selected by the National Congress, will fulfill the functions of the president until the end of the term. If all the vicepresidents are absent, the president of the National Congress takes over as acting president, and if the president of the National Congress is also absent then the president of the Supreme Court will become acting president until the end of the term.\nVice presidents are eligible to be impeached by the National Congress for poor performance or misconduct. Vice presidents are also not allowed to remain outside the country for more than 15 days without the permission of the National Congress.\nRequirements and restrictions\nThe requirements to be a vice president are the same as that of the president. A candidate must be Honduran by birth, be over the age of 30, have full civic rights, and may not be an active member of the leadership of any established religion.\nVice presidents may not be elected president while serving in the role, or within six months after the end of their term or resignation. Vice presidents can also not be elected as a deputy of the National Congress while serving in office.\nHistory\nThe following is a history of officeholders:\n1839–1954\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
