It had a display of coal mining memorabilia and an exhibition of art.\nOne of the main reasons for the display was to educate the next generation of children about the mining past of County Durham and to give opportunities to research coal mining history, especially local school groups in the area and visitors to the city.\nThe displays included mining pit lamps such as the famous Davy lamp, tools used in the mining trade and a selection of art by former miners. A computer facility showed photographs and there was also a section of books on mining.\nSee also\n* North East England Mining Archive and Resource Centre\n* Rhondda Heritage Park in the old South Wales coalfield\nExternal links\n* [http://www.durhamminers.com Durham Miners' Heritage Group website]"
