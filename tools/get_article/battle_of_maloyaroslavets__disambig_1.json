It was Mikhail Kutuzov's decisive battle to force Napoleon to retreat northwest over Mozhaisk to Smolensk on the devastated route of his advance with a higher probability of starvation. Kutuzov's next attack against the remnants of the , the Battle of Krasnoi, began on 15 November 1812, three weeks later.\nPrelude\nThe last major battle had been the Battle of Tarutino on 18 October 1812, that was won by the Russian army.\nA great part of the large mob of non-combatants, invalids from the hospitals, women, fugitive inhabitants of Moscow, whose number can only be guessed at, was directed upon Vereya and the straight road to Smolensk and only the fighting force was to march towards Kaluga.\nOn 19 October 1812, Napoleon had retreated from Moscow and marched south-west to Kaluga, Eugène de Beauharnais leading the advance\nThe French army leaving Moscow was estimated by Wilson: 90,000 effective infantry, 14,000 feeble cavalry, 12,000 armed men employed in the various services of artillery, engineers, gendarmerie, head-quarter staff, equipages, and commissariat, and more than 20,000 non-combatants, sick, and wounded.\nAlexis Joseph Delzons commanded the lead units going to the village of Maloyaroslavets. The bridges across Luzha River were destroyed by order of local authorities. Delzons' soldiers entered the city over a dam and built a pontoon bridge next to the destroyed one. Then Delzons attacked the heights on which the village rested. On the evening of October 23 Delzons placed two of his battalions in the village.\nBattle\nOn the 24 October 1812 General Dokhturov entered the town from the south and found the French spearhead had seized a bridgehead. Fierce fighting began. General Raevsky arrived with 10,000 more Russians; once more they took the town, though not the bridgehead. De Beauharnais threw in his 15th (Italian) division, under Domenico Pino (Minister of War of the Kingdom of Italy), and by evening they had again expelled the Russians. Armand Charles Guilleminot was the first who entered the city. During the course of the engagement the town changed hands no fewer than eight times and it was quoted that in particular the Italian Royal Guard under Eugène de Beauharnais 'had displayed qualities which entitled it evermore to take rank amongst the bravest troops of Europe'. Marshal Kutuzov arrived and decided against a pitched battle with the Grand Army the next day, and to retire instead to the prepared line of defense at Kaluga. The mainly French and Italian forces won a victory on the day, but Napoleon might have realized that \"unless with a new Borodino\" the way through Kaluga and Medyn was closed. This allowed Kutuzov to fulfill his strategic plans to force Napoleon on the way of retreat in the north, through Mozhaisk and Smolensk, the route of his advance that he had wished to avoid. French casualties were about 6,000–8,000, while the Russians lost about 8,000 men killed and wounded.\nKutuzov's strategy\nOn the 25 October 1812 at about two in the morning after the battle Kutuzov retired his army in perfect order southwards away from the French army behind the rivulet of Koricza to secure the road to Kaluga. Robert Wilson, a British general attached to the Russian army, favoured an aggressive strategy against Napoleon and protested against Kutuzov's strategy. According to Wilson's memoirs, Kutuzov replied by stating \"I am by no means sure that the total destruction of the Emperor Napoleon and his army would be such a benefit to the world; his succession would not fall to Russia or any other continental power, but to that which already commands the sea (i.e. Britain), and whose domination would then be intolerable.\"\nAftermath\nThe immediate result of the battle of Maloyaroslavets on the 24th had been a strange French tactical victory: the French army had secured a bridgehead, and instead of another attempt to hold on to the city (another \"Borodino\"), Kutuzov took up prepared defensive positions southwards; the Russian army had retreated but Napoleon did not follow them. The long-term result of the battle became a Russian strategic victory  as they had disturbed Napoleon's ability to wage a war.\nOn the 25th, at daybreak, Napoleon nearly was caught by a Cossack regiment but was saved by a corps of grenadiers.\nFrom then on, Napoleon carried a bag containing a lethal poison, hung by a string around his neck.\nOn the 26th, Napoleon decided to retreat over Mozhaisk and Borodino to Smolensk for reasons unknown resulting in the strange detour in the attached map of Napoleon's invasion of Russia at Maloyaroslavets.\nOn the 26th Napoleon again set out for Maloyaroslavets,...he ordered the retreat of his own army by Mozhaisk on Smolensk.\nBefore Napoleon could come to such a conclusion he must have been very conscious of the extreme weakness of his army, for the march he now decided on undertaking was one of two hundred and sixty miles through a devastated country, whose towns, sacked and burnt, offered no shelter or supply against the inclemency of winter.\nOn the night of October 27, the rear guard of the Grand Army left the ruins of the city, crossed to the northern bank of the Luzha and joined the general retreat.\nOn Kutuzov's order, Platov and his Cossacks directly followed Napoleon. The next major battle for the Russian army was the Battle of Vyazma on 3 November 1812.\nKutuzov \"escorted\" Napoleon off the more southern roads with better supply of food and shelter, securing the south against the French army. The next battle for Kutuzov was the Battle of Krasnoi on 15 November 1812.\nThe last battle in this campaign for Napoleon was the Battle of Berezina on 26–29 November 1812.\nSee also\n*List of battles of the French invasion of Russia\nExplanatory notes\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSources\n* [https://archive.org/details/memoirsofsergean00bour/page/n5/mode/2up  Bourgogne, Adrien Jean Baptiste François, Memoirs of Sergeant Bourgogne, 1812–1813]\n* [https://archive.org/details/histoiredelexpd00chamgoog/mode/2up Chambray, George de, ''Histoire de l'expédition de Russie]\n* [https://archive.org/details/warsagainstnapol0000fran Weider, Ben and Franceschi, The Wars Against Napoleon: Debunking the Myth of the Napoleonic Wars], 2007\n* [https://archive.org/details/moscow1812napole00zamo Zamoyski, Adam, Moscow 1812, Napoleon's Fatal March], 1980\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20240217185258/https://www.rbth.com/special_projects/discovering_russia_1/2016/12/02/maloyaroslavets-where-napoleons-fate-was-sealed_653127 Brumfield, William Craft, Maloyaroslavets: Where Napoleon's fate was sealed''], 2016\nExternal links\n*"
