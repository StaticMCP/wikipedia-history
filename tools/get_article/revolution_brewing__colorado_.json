Originally the brewery used a 3/4-barrel brewing system.  Later it used a six-barrel system.  Some of the beer was sold in a tasting room down the street from the brewery, some was available on tap at local restaurants, and some was distributed in cans.  The beer was not filtered or pasteurized.  It was made with water from nearby Mount Lamborn.  In 2018 the brewery was bought out by the Paonia United Brewing Company.\nBeers\nRevolution Brewing made a number of different beers.\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
