It is 11 stories tall, with  of space. The building has a rail line that enters the second floor and the walls are  thick concrete.\nHistory\nCentral Warehouse was built in 1927.\nIn 1981 the building began to have signs placed on it seen from I-787, and in 1983 one in particular \"Year of the Bible\" received numerous complaints, and the state began proceedings to have it removed. The signs violated the Federal Highway Beautification Act and were removed in 1986. Previous signs from 1981 to 1983 were not disputed by the state because Albany Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd had personally approved them, and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) chose not to enforce the law since it would be against Corning's wishes, Corning died in 1983.\nThe building was abandoned in the early 1990s. In 1996, the building was found to have up to  of ice built up on some floors. It was believed that the ice kept the ammonia in the refrigeration system from expanding, bursting pipes, and being released into the atmosphere. The ammonia was subsequently drained from the pipes.\nOn October 22, 2010, a fire began in the warehouse and lasted for days. The current owners claimed no structural damage was done to the building, and that plans to renovate the building into a residential and retail complex were still possible. Over $1 million had already been invested in cleaning the insides of the building.\nThe City of Albany declared a state of emergency on July 29, 2022 after chunks of the building's concrete wall began to fall near the train tracks below.  Amtrak, who uses this portion of the track for service west of Albany, temporarily suspended use of the track. On August 1, after the city made emergency repairs to the crumbling wall, Amtrak resumed use of the track.  The City billed the building's owner for the repair costs.\nIn October 2022, longtime owner Evan Blum lost control of the property after a judge ruled in favor of foreclosure. The building is now under the management of Albany County.\nIn August 2025, Governor Kathy Hochul presided over a demolition ceremony at the east entrance to the warehouse. Total funding earmarked for the abatement of asbestos and demolition of the warehouse is cited as $14.6 million by Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy.\nReferences"
