      "text": "# List of World Heritage Sites in Peru__disambig_1\n\n}}\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Peru ratified the convention on February 24, 1982, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.\n, Peru has 13 sites on the World Heritage List. The first sites within Peru were inscribed on the list at the 7th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Florence, Italy in 1983: \"City of Cusco\" and the \"Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu\". Nine sites are listed as cultural sites, two as natural, and two as mixed, meeting both cultural and natural selection criteria, as determined by the organization's selection criteria. The site Chan Chan Archaeological Zone was inscribed to the list in 1986 and immediately placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger as the adobe constructions are easily damaged by heavy rain and erosion. The Qhapaq Ñan, Andean Road System site is a transnational site, also shared with Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. In addition, there are eight sites on the tentative list.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\nIn danger|outline=silver}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n|City of Cuzco\n|\n|Cuzco\n| align=center| 1983\n|273; iii, iv (cultural)\n|Cuzco was developed by the Inca king Pachacutec, who ruled the Kingdom of Cuzco as it expanded to become the Inca Empire in the 15th century. It became the most important city of the Inca Empire, divided into distinct areas for religious and administrative use, and surrounded by an organized system of agriculture, artisan, and industrial uses. The Spanish conquered the empire in the 16th century. They built Baroque churches and buildings over the Inca ruins. Cuzco is one of the highest cities in the world.\n|-\n|Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu\n|align=center|\n|Cuzco\n| align=center| 1983\n| 274; i, iii, vii, ix (mixed)\n|At  above sea level, the site of Machu Picchu was constructed as an expansive mountain estate around the middle of the 15th century, and abandoned approximately 100 years later. It includes walls, terraces, and buildings constructed from rock that is earthquake-resistant. The city was home to about 1,200 people, mostly priests, women, and children. It was left abandoned prior to the Spanish arrival in Cuzco most likely due to smallpox.\n|-\n|Chavín (Archaeological Site)\n|align=center|\n|Ancash\n| align=center| 1985\n| 330; iii (cultural)\n|The Chavín culture developed in the Andean highlands between 1500 and 300 BC. The site is now known as Chavín de Huantar, which served as the center. The site consists of a complex of terraces and squares cut from rock. It is believed the Chavín were primarily a religious-based society whose influence resulted from their culture, rather than aggressive expansion.\n|-\n|Huascarán National Park\n|align=center|\n|Ancash\n| align=center| 1985\n|333; vii, viii (natural)\n|Huascarán National Park is located in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range of the Andes. It surrounds Huascarán, the tallest peak in Peru. The physical environment includes glaciers, ravines, and lakes, while the park is home to several regional animal species. The national park is uninhabited, but native llamas and alpacas graze in the lowlands.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffe6bd;\"|Chan Chan Archaeological Zone\n|align=center|\n|La Libertad\n| align=center| 1986\n|366; i, iii (cultural)\n|The city of Chan Chan served as the capital of the Chimú culture. The Chimú kingdom developed along the coast of northern Peru. Chan Chan is divided into nine walled units indicating political and social division. The Chimú were conquered by the Inca in 1470. The site was listed to the List of World Heritage in Danger when it was first inscribed, as the adobe constructions are easily damaged by heavy rain and erosion.\n|-\n|Manu National Park\n|align=center|\n|Cuzco\n| align=center| 1987\n|402; ix, x (natural)\n|The park spreads over  and from  to  above sea-level. Manu is home to 1,000 bird species, over 200 species of mammals (100 of which are bats), and over 15,000 species of flowering plants. Jaguars have been seen throughout the national park. The giant otter and giant armadillo are just a few rare species found in the national park. Prior to being recognized as a World Heritage Site in 1987, it was designated as a biosphere reserve in 1977.\n|-\n|Historic Centre of Lima\n|align=center|\n|Lima Province\n| align=center| 1988\n|500; iv (cultural)\n|Lima was founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535 as La Ciudad de los Reyes (City of the Kings). Until the middle of the 18th century, it was the most important city in Spanish South America. The architecture and decoration combine the style of both the local population and Europe, such as in the Monastery of San Francisco. Also, hospitals, schools and universities were built. San Marcos University was built in 1551. The city's social and cultural life was organized within these places, giving Lima a convent image which characterized its urban profile until half of the 20th century.\n|-\n|Rio Abiseo National Park\n|align=center|\n|San Martín\n| align=center| 1990\n|548; iii, vii, ix, x (mixed)\n|The park was created in 1983 in order to protect the region's rainforest habitat. The park is home to many endemic species such as the yellow-tailed woolly monkey, which was thought to be extinct. The site is also listed under cultural criteria, as over 30 Pre-Columbian sites have been discovered since 1985.\n|-\n|Lines and Geoglyphs of Nazca and Pampas de Jumana\n|align=center|\n|Ica\n| align=center| 1994\n|700; i, iii, iv (cultural)\n|The large designs in the Nazca Desert are believed to have been created by the Nazca culture between 400 and 650 AD. They were created by scratching lines into the ground surface. Designs include animals such as a monkey and hummingbird, plants, and geographic shapes on a large scale. It is believed that they served a ritualistic purpose.\n|-\n|Historical Centre of the City of Arequipa\n|align=center|\n|Arequipa\n| align=center| 2000\n|1016; i, iv (cultural)\n|Arequipa is built primarily on top of sillar, a white volcanic rock, the product of nearby El Misti volcano. The architecture of the city is known for its combination of traditional indigenous styles with the new techniques of the European colonial settlers.\n|-\n|Sacred City of Caral-Supe\n|align=center|\n|Lima\n| align=center| 2009\n|1269; ii, iii, iv (cultural)\n|The archaeological site belonged to the Norte Chico civilization that inhabited the area during the Late Archaic period. Caral is one of 18 complex urban settlements in the region and features many monuments and pyramids. Caral is the earliest known American settlement. A quipu recovered from the site demonstrates its influence on later Andean cultures.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#D0E7FF;\"|Qhapaq Ñan, Andean Road System*\n|align=center|\n|several regions\n| align=center| 2014\n|1459; ii, iii, iv, vi (cultural)\n| The site covers an extensive road system in the Andes built over several centuries by the Incas, partly based on pre-Inca infrastructure. The system spans over more than  running through various geographical terrains – the coast, rainforests, valleys, deserts, and mountainous regions above  of altitude. The site includes 273 component sites in six countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\n|-\n|Chankillo Archaeoastronomical Complex\n|align=center|\n|Ancash\n| align=center| 2021\n|1624; i, iv (cultural)\n| The Chankillo Archaeoastronomical Complex is a prehistoric site (250–200 BC), located in the Casma Valley, and comprises a set of constructions that functioned as a calendrical instrument. Possibly dedicated to a solar cult, the site was used to define dates throughout the year utilizing the sun. The complex is able to mark out the solstices, the equinoxes, and all the dates of the year with a precision of 1–2 days.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to the sites inscribed on the World Heritage list, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage list are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. , Peru recorded 24 sites on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (region)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\"| UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Historic Center of the City of Trujillo\n|\n| La Libertad\n| 1996\n| (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The Great Inka Trail: state transportation system originally named \"Qhapac Ñan\"\n|\n| several regions\n| 2001\n| ii, iii, iv, v, vi (cultural)\n| \"The Great Inka Trail\" is an entry exclusive to Peru. \"The Sistema Vial Andino/Qhapaq Ñan\" is a site also listed by Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. The movement to include the road system was initiated with Peru's addition of it to the tentative list in 2001. Argentina and Chile joined the movement shortly afterwards. On January 29, 2003, the six Andean states approached the World Heritage Centre, requesting that it take charge of coordinating the joint project. The latter site was inscribed to the list in 2014.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| The Historic Centre of Cajamarca\n|\n| Cajamarca\n| 2002\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lake Titicaca\n|\n| Puno\n| 2005\n| ii, iii, v, vi, vii, x (mixed)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Santa Bárbara mining complex\n|\n| Huancavelica\n| 2017\n| ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Salt Mines of Maras\n|\n|Cusco\n|2019\n|iii, v (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Baroque Temples of Collao\n|\n|Puno\n|2019\n|ii, iv (cultural)\n|San Francisco de Asis temple, Ayaviri; San Geronimo Temple, Asillo; Santiago apostol temple, Lampa; San Carlos Borromeo temple, Puno; San Pedro Martir Temple, Juli; Santa Cruz de Jerusalen temple, Juli; Nuestra Senora de Rosario or Santiago Apostol temple, Pomata; San Pedro Temple, Zepita\n|-\n|Rural Temples of Cusco\n|\n|Cusco\n|2019\n|ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Nasca Aqueducts\n|\n|Ica\n|2019\n|iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Archaeological Complex of Toro Muerto\n|\n|Arequipa\n|2019\n|iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Archaeological complex of Marcahuamachuco\n|\n|La Libertad\n|2019\n|iii (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Chachapoyas sites of the Utcubamba Valley\n|\n|Amazonas\n|2019\n|iii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Battlefield of Ayacucho\n|\n|Ayacucho\n|2019\n|vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Wineries and Vineyards for traditional Pisco Production\n|\n|Ica\n|2019\n|ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Las Huaringas Lagoons\n|\n|Piura\n|2019\n|v, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Peruvian Central Railway\n|\n|Lima\n|2019\n|ii, iv (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Cultural Landscape of the Sondondo Valley\n|\n|Ayacucho\n|2019\n|iii, iv, vi (cultural)\n|\n|-\n|Paleontological Sites of Pisco and Camana Basins\n|\n|Ica\n|2019\n|viii (natural)\n|\n|-\n|Ceremonial Centers and Forests in the La Leche Valley\n|\n|Lambayeque\n|2019\n|iv, vi, x (mixed)\n|\n|-\n|Sierra del Divisor National Park\n|\n|Ucayali\n|2019\n|vii, x (natural)\n|\n|-\n|Huayllay National Sanctuary\n|\n|Pasco\n|2019\n|vii, viii (natural)\n|\n|-\n|Guano Islands, Islets, and Capes National Reserve System form Peru (RNSIIPG)\n|\n|Lima\n|2019\n|x (natural)\n|\n|-\n|Landscape Reserve Sub Cuenca del Cotahuasi\n|\n|Arequipa\n|2019\n|vii, viii (natural)\n|\n|-\n|The Coastal Lomas System of Peru\n|\n|Lima\n|2019\n|ix (natural)\n|\n|-\n|Real Felipe Fortress\n|\n|Callao\n|2023\n|iv (cultural)\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Intangible Cultural Heritage elements in Peru\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=PE&language=S Comisión Nacional Peruana de Cooperación con UNESCO]\n* [http://www.unesco.org/new/es/lima/home/ UNESCO Office in Lima]"
