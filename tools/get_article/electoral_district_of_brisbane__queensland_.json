      "text": "# Electoral district of Brisbane (Queensland)\n\nBrisbane was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Queensland from 1912 to 1977.\nBased in inner central Brisbane, north of the Brisbane River, it was first created as a single member constituency for the 1912 state election, largely replacing the dual member constituency of Brisbane North. It was abolished at the 1977 state election and replaced by the new district of Brisbane Central.\nIt was historically a safe seat for the Labor Party.\nMembers for Brisbane\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Mick Kirwan\n| Labor\n| 1912–1932\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Robert Funnell\n| Labor\n| 1932–1936\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Johnno Mann\n| Labor\n| 1936–1969\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Brian Davis\n| Labor\n| 1969–1974\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| Harold Lowes\n| Liberal\n| 1974–1977\n|-\n|}\nElection results\nSee also\n* Electoral district of Brisbane City, which existed 1873 to 1878\n* Electoral districts of Queensland\n* Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly by year\n* :Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly by name\nReferences"
