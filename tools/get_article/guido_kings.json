He received his doctorate in 1994 and habilitation in 2000 at the University of Münster. In 2001, he held a research professorship at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn. He has been a full professor at the University of Regensburg since 2001.\nKings has done research in arithmetic geometry, the theory of automorphic forms, Iwasawa theory, polylogarithms, and special values of L-functions.\nHe was the speaker of the research group Algebraic Cycles and L-Functions funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Since 2012, he has been the speaker of the collaborative research centre (SFB) Höhere Invarianten – Wechselwirkungen zwischen Arithmetischer Geometrie und Globaler Analysis, also funded by the DFG.\nAwards\nTogether with his coauthor Annette Huber-Klawitter, Kings was the recipient of the award of the Universitätsgesellschaft Münster for young scientists in 1999. Kings and Huber-Klawitter were also invited speakers at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing in 2002.\nSince 2012, he has been a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.\nIn 2025, Kings and his former student Johannes Sprang received the Frontiers of Science Award for their joint paper Eisenstein-Kronecker classes, integrality of critical values of Hecke L-functions and p-adic interpolation, which appeared in Annals of Mathematics).\nExternal links\n* [https://www.uni-regensburg.de/mathematik/mathematik-kings/startseite/index.html Website at the University of Regensburg]\n*\nReferences"
