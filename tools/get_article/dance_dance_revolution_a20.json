The game was released on new, golden cabinets on March 20, 2019, in Japan. A software upgrade for older cabinets for Japan and Asia was released on July 24, 2019, with South Korea receiving a localized release on August 1, 2019, and North America on September 24, 2019. A location test in Europe began on October 7, 2019, and ended on March 16, 2020.\nDance Dance Revolution A20 Plus is an expansion pack that adds 106 new songs, 19 new courses, and other content. It was released on July 1, 2020, for Japanese 20th Anniversary cabinets and on July 6, 2020, for cabinets using an upgrade kit.\nDevelopment\nOn July 4, 2018, Konami opened a Dance Dance Revolution Twitter account in preparation of the series' 20th anniversary, which was celebrated on September 26, 2018. Dance Dance Revolution 20th Anniversary was announced at JAEPO 2019 as a placeholder. The game was first announced on January 26, 2019, during the Dance Dance Revolution A grand final of The 8th KONAMI Arcade Championship finals.\nFeatures\nThe game features the notable return of courses, which was removed in Dance Dance Revolution (2013). There are two kinds of courses, only selectable on the first stage: Nonstop and Class. Unlike the previous main Dance Dance Revolution arcade games, courses are accessed from the song selection screen instead of a separate menu, similar to both Dancing Stage EuroMix games. Both Nonstop and Class play four songs back-to-back. All NONSTOP courses can be switched to CHALLENGE MODE if the LIFE GAUGE option is set to RISKY or LIFE4. Class, intended to measure the player's skill, places a stricter rules on the gameplay; the player cannot change Turn and Assist options and is forced to play on the \"Grade\" life gauge, which starts out full and depletes faster if it goes down. Players are given a martial arts-inspired \"dan rank\" certification based on the player's chosen course difficulty.  Class is available for golden cabinets only and unavailable in Versus Play. With the installation of the blue interface, it's possible to switch languages in-game, including Japanese, English and Korean as options.\nAll 14 characters from Dance Dance Revolution A return in this game. Victory Concent is only available as a randomly selected character. Dark Alice, Dark Emi, Black Rinon and a 6th KAC costume for Yuni can be unlocked. Additionally, when playing the song Yuni's Nocturnal Days, Yuni wears her X2 costume and is automatically selected as a character.\nThe game introduces a new cabinet design based on the Dance Rush cabinet, but colored gold.\nEvents\nExtra Stage\nThe Extra Stage system retains the star requirement introduced in Dance Dance Revolution X3 VS 2ndMix. The player is required to obtain 9 stars in a round to be allowed an extra song, the number of stars of which is determined by the player's grade. Extra Stages can only be obtained in Premium Mode. For players in Asia territories and North America, this requires \"Premium Play\" to be selected when the game starts. For players in Japan, Premium Play requires Konami's PASELI payment system.\nExtra Exclusive\nThis folder is essentially a replacement for the traditional Extra Stage system of the previous games: the songs in this folder are marked in red and can only be played in Extra Stage.\nExtra Savior Plus\nOriginally from Dance Dance Revolution A, Extra Savior, now renamed Extra Savior Plus, was added on July 16, 2020, and allows the player to unlock hidden songs by playing them in Extra Stage. These not only include new additions for this game, but also some hidden songs yet to be unlocked for the general public from previous games. This time around, EXTRA SAVIOR works more akin to EXTRA ATTACK from the 2014 game, where charts must be unlocked in order: BEGINNER (only in SINGLE and is unlocked by selecting song) → BASIC → DIFFICULT → EXPERT. Players will earn the same amount of unlock progress regardless of what difficulty is played during EXTRA STAGE. Unlocking a chart requires either clearing the song, or enough failed attempts to unlock it. EXPERT charts require two stage clears or equivalent progress from failed attempts.  Using ASSIST options will lower clear progress.\nSummer Dance Camp\nThe Summer Dance Camp event is a collaboration event between Dance Dance Revolution series and DANCERUSH STARDOM. Stamps can be earned by playing either Dance Dance Revolution A20 (Plus) or DANCERUSH STARDOM. Three stamps are offered once per day, one for the game being played and two for the opposite game. By collecting a certain number of stamps for a specific game, songs will be unlocked for the respective game.

Part 2 started on July 7, 2020, and ended on September 7, 2020, and all songs are unlockables via EXTRA SAVIOR PLUS since March 8, 2021.\nDance Dance Revolution 20th Anniversary Grand Finale\nThe Dance Dance Revolution 20th Anniversary Grand Finale event began on September 5, 2019, and ended on December 31, 2019.

On May 29, 2019, Round One confirmed that all of its American locations will receive A20 in the form of imported golden cabinets. This initially introduced the game to 32 locations at the time of release, most of which also feature a localized version of Dance Dance Revolution A.

They are a series of courses ranked so that each course is harder than the last. Unlike the Beatmania IIDX series though, the starting level in DanceDanceRevolution is 1st Dan (初段). Since July 25, 2019, Dan courses allow for short breaks in-between songs, referred to as \"Break Time\". Dan courses are exclusive for golden cabinets. Courses marked in bronze requires bronze class in the golden league, in silver requires silver class and in gold requires gold class.\nDance Dance Revolution A20\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:lavender;\" | Dan (段位認定)\n! style=\"background:lavender;\"|SINGLE\n! style=\"background:lavender;\"|DOUBLE\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1st Dan (初段)\n|style=\"background:#dfd\"|1. \"HIGHER\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"Slip Out\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"Shine\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"Fever\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"IN THE ZONE\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"STILL IN MY HEART\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"B4U\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"think ya better D\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|2nd Dan (二段) 🔒\n|style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"Do The Evolution\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"escape\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"Flourish\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;;\"|2. \"south\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"Heatstroke\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"DANCE ALL NIGHT (DDR EDITION)\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"will\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"INTO YOUR HEART (Ruffage remix)\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|3rd Dan (三段) 🔒\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"Decade\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"MAKE IT BETTER (So-REAL Mix)\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"A Geisha's Dream\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"oarfish\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"In The Breeze\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"ルミナスデイズ\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"Theory of Eternity\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"Beautiful Dream\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|4th Dan (四段) 🔒\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"Beautiful Dream\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"Desert Journey\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"DYNAMITE RAVE\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"stoic (EXTREME version)\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"TECH-NOID\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"heron\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"S・A・G・A\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"PARANOIA EVOLUTION\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|5th Dan (五段) 🔒\n|style=\"background:#DDE6FF;\"|1. \"You are a Star\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"Do The Evolution\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"十二星座の聖域\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"DROP OUT\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DDE6FF;\"|3. \"sakura storm\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"ALGORITHM\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DDE6FF;\"|4. \"Diamond Night\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"Healing Vision ～Angelic mix～\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|6th Dan (六段) 🔒\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"on the bounce\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"siberite\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DDE6FF;\"|2. \"AM-3P (\"CHAOS\" Special)\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"Horatio\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"Pierce The Sky\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"The Least 100sec\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"MAX 300\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"エンドルフィン\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|7th Dan (七段) 🔒\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"Nostalgia Is Lost\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"SILVER☆DREAM\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DDE6FF;\"|2. \"Amalgamation\"\n|style=\"background:#DDE6FF;\"|2. \"IMANOGUILTS\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"The legend of MAX\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"PARANOIA survivor MAX\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"True Blue\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"SUPER SAMURAI\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|8th Dan (八段) 🔒\n|style=\"background:#DDE6FF;\"|1. \"Monkey Business\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|1. \"TRIP MACHINE PhoeniX\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"嘆きの樹\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|2. \"Arrabbiata\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DDE6FF;\"|3. \"PARANOIA survivor MAX\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|3. \"Truare!\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"POSSESSION\"\n| style=\"background:#dfd;\"|4. \"ÆTHER\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;
