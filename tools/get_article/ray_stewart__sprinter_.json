As a junior athlete Stewart found much success at the CARIFTA Games, winning five gold medals within a four-year period. In 1984 he reached the 100&nbsp;m Olympic final and won an Olympic silver medal for the 4×100 metres relay. At the 1987 World Championships he took silver in the 100&nbsp;m and bronze with the Jamaican relay team. A leg injury in the 1988 Olympic final of the 100&nbsp;m ruined his medal chances in both the individual and relay events.\nA new personal best of 9.97&nbsp;seconds at the NCAA Outdoor Championships made him the number one ranked 100&nbsp;m athlete in 1989 and the first Jamaican to officially break the 10-second barrier. At the competition he also recorded the third fastest relay time ever. He won his first Commonwealth Games medal the following year, taking bronze in the relay. Stewart recorded a national record of 9.96&nbsp;seconds at the 1991 World Championships but this was surprisingly only enough for sixth place; two continental records and the world record were broken in the race. Stewart reached his third consecutive Olympic 100&nbsp;m final in 1992, becoming the first man to do so. He reached the 1993 and 1995 World Championship finals of the 100&nbsp;m but failed to medal. He attended his last Olympics in 1996.\nStewart had a career that lasted almost twenty years, competing at four successive Olympic Games and six World Championships. He also won the 100&nbsp;m at the Jamaican national championships seven times. His 100&nbsp;m personal best of 9.96&nbsp;seconds makes him the fifth fastest Jamaican sprinter in the event, after Usain Bolt, Asafa Powell, Nesta Carter and Yohan Blake.\nHe went on to coach a number of prominent sprinters, including Jerome Young, but received a life-ban from athletics in 2010 as he had allegedly obtained performance-enhancing drugs for his athletes.\nCareer\nStewart attended Camperdown High School, and was coached by Glen Mills.
