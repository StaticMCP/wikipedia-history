In her poems she writes about the frustration of educated women, who were not allowed to have a career, nor were they accepted by men as intellectual equals. The Huaiqing Tang ji contains over 200 of her poems. She also wrote three chuanqi plays; Fanhua meng (Dream of Glory), Quan fu ji (Complete Happiness) and You xian meng (A Dream Visit to the Immortals).\nSources\n*, via web.archive.org\n\n---\n\n## Wang Yun (Qing Dynasty)\n\n#REDIRECT Wang Yun (Qing dynasty)"
