From 30 November 2015, the government no longer referenced counties and parishes in land information systems however the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying retains a record for historical purposes.\nThe center of local government for the County is Jundah, Queensland to the north, the only town of the county is Windorah, Queensland and the postcode is 4481.\nThe county is named for the Tanbar Billabong.\nSee also\n* Tanbar, Queensland\nReferences"
