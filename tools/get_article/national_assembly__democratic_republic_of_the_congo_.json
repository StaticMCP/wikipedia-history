It is one of the two legislative bodies along with the Senate. The National Assembly is composed of deputies (fr. députés) who are elected by the citizens of the DRC. The deputies serve as the voice of the people and are responsible for enacting legislation, representing their constituents' interests, and overseeing the executive branch of government. The National Assembly is responsible for deliberating and passing laws that impact the nation and its citizens. It was established by the 2006 constitution, which provided for a bicameral parliament consisting of the National Assembly and the Senate. It is located at the People's Palace () in Kinshasa.\nThe inaugural session of the 2024–2028 National Assembly will take place 29 January 2024 with 477 provisionally elected deputies attending.\nElectoral system\nThe National Assembly is elected every five years by universal suffrage.  For the 2023 elections 484 seats of the assembly were apportioned among 179 electoral districts based on voter registration numbers.  The remaining 16 seats were reserved for the districts of Kwamouth, Masisi, and Rutshuru territories which did not participate in the election due to armed conflict.  The assembly as a whole will consist of 65 members elected in single member constituencies by first-past-the-post and the remaining 435 members elected in multi-member constituencies by open list.\nPresidents of the National Assembly\nNumber of deputies for each constituency by province\nThe number of deputies elected from each subdivision in parentheses.\nBas-Uele (7)\n* City of Buta
