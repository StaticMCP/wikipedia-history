      "text": "# Warm Water Cove\n\nWarm Water Cove is an outdoor, formerly industrialized picnic area in San Francisco, California, located near Pier 80 and the Dogpatch neighborhood.\nThe park contains works of graffiti art, abandoned warehouses, and punk concerts. Free, all-ages shows are set up a few times every month by local Bay Area and touring musicians. Along with 924 Gilman Street, it is one of a few punk rock venues in the Bay Area where D.I.Y. music is performed.\nThe park underwent some cleanup and renovation in 2007.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Warm_Water_Cove Warm Water Cove at FoundSF website]"
