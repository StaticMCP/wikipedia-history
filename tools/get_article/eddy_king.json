Only the brother combinations of Ronnie & Richie Anderson and Brent & Brian Patterson were more successful. His best known nickname \"King Edward\" is an obvious play on his name feeding off of the cultural knowledge of famous British kings named Edwards. Other nicknames included \"Silver Bullet\" \"Eddy the King\" and \"The Dynamic Duo\" which he shared with Diamondback teammate Harry Leary. He was particularly dominant as an amateur winning most of his racing titles at that stage of his career. He would go on to be a professional for the remaining six years of his 14-year career. King would stay his entire professional career with Diamondback and would be associated with that company.\nRacing career milestones\nNote: Professional first are on the National level unless otherwise indicated. Included under the title of \"National\" are American Bicycle Association (ABA) Gold Cup Qualifiers.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n!style=\"width:20em\"| Milestone\n!style=\"width:35em\"| Event Details\n|-\n|Started racing:  ||Friday January 15, 1975 age 10.

He was 24 years old. He retired after his contract with Diamondback expired. He was basically burned out of the sport and felt it was time to do other things:\nThe 1988 ABA Grandnational in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma for Eddy King represented a changing of the guard. It was the same race in which his younger brother Mike King won the 1988 ABA National No.1 pro title. Eddy himself came in sixth place in Pro Open, winning US$210 (US$367.99 in 2007). Eddy King's last race as a Senior Pro was the ABA Winternationals on February 19, 1989. He came in eighth place last in \"AA\" pro. He would race on at least two more occasions post retirement. He raced in the ABA Springnationals in Bakersfield, California on March 20 & 21, 1993 in the new Veteran Pro class with fellow retired pros including Tommy Brackens, Perry Kramer and Rod Beckering. He came in fourth on Saturday and fifth on Sunday. His old teammate Harry Leary won both days.

He was laid up until the ABA National in Ogden, Utah.\nMiscellaneous\nIn an interview in the August 1987 issue of BMX Action Eddy King admitted that himself and allegedly Harry Leary along with four other people considered using anabolic steroids to race since BMX tracks at that time was focused on the power racer more than the racer that relied more on finesse and jumping ability. He also stated that he knew of a couple of racers that actually used them:\n\"''Right now, pro racing is all power. I know of a couple of pros who are taking steroids and about half a dozen have looked at it, including myself and Harry. The doctors told us, 'No way. Don't do it.' Maybe the association will have to crack down on it like in other sports. Or change the tracks.\" ---BMX Action August 1987\nIronically, the tracks did change from an emphasis in power to those of skill and finesse in the mid-1990s. During this time comparatively small framed pro racers like Alan and Brian Foster and in the early 21st century Mario Soto and Donny Robinson racers that relied on finesse to make up for a lack of power started to do well. This coupled with drug testing instituted by the ABA in the late 1990s and later by the NBL, USA Cycling and the UCI, allegations of steroid use against BMX racers-either out of jealousy or real knowledge-fell.\nPost BMX career\nAfter retiring after the 1988 season, Eddy King became a full-time real estate broker (fellow BMX racer Cheri Elliott would become one as well approximately 14 years later after her mountain bike (MTB) racing career). Indeed, his career in that field started before retirement selling his first house, his own in the summer of 1987 for US$180,000, which was the equivalent to US$328,468.31 in 2007([http://www.aier.org/research/cost-of-living-calculator Cost of Living Calculator] ).\nOther significant sibling combinations in BMX\n*Ronnie & Richie Anderson\n*Brent & Brian Patterson\n*Eric & Robby Rupe\n*Alan & Brian Foster\n*Rich & Gary Houseman\nBMX press magazine interviews and articles\n*\"Agility and ability make Eddy a BMX winner\" the California BMX Rider'' Summer 1976 Vol.1 No.2\n*\"Ask the Experts...: 'What type of tires do you use?'\" BMX Plus!
