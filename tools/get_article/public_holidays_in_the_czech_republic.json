In addition to public holidays, this law also defines other holidays and significant days . Public holidays and other holidays are non-working days, significant days are working days (unless they fall on a Saturday or Sunday). Public holidays (unlike other holidays) \"should remind citizens of the traditions, noble goals and historical twists and turns on which Czech statehood is built\".\nOn some national and other holidays, the opening hours of some stores are limited by law.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
