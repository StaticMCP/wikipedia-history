Also known as Naamans Creek Road, the route runs from U.S. Route&nbsp;202 (US&nbsp;202) in Concord Township east to the Delaware border in Lower Chichester Township.  In the state of Delaware, the highway runs for  as a connector between the Pennsylvania border and DE&nbsp;92 near Claymont, Delaware. PA&nbsp;491 runs closely parallel to the Delaware border throughout its route. It intersects PA&nbsp;261 in the Booths Corner section of Bethel Township. The western portion of PA&nbsp;491 was first designated as part of Legislative Route&nbsp;135 in 1911. In the 1920s, the Delaware portion of road was built as a state highway while PA&nbsp;491 was created in 1928.\nRoute description\nPennsylvania\nPA&nbsp;491 begins at an intersection with US&nbsp;202 in Concord Township, Delaware County, heading east-southeast on two-lane undivided Naamans Creek Road. The route passes through residential areas, crossing into Bethel Township at the Pyle Road intersection. Upon reaching the community of Booths Corner, PA&nbsp;491 passes businesses and comes to an intersection with PA&nbsp;261. Following this intersection, the route runs past more neighborhoods as it enters Upper Chichester Township. Upon reaching the community of Ogden, PA&nbsp;491 turns to the southeast as it crosses CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line at-grade. After crossing into Lower Chichester Township, the route passes under I-95 as it heads south into woodland to the Delaware border.\nDelaware\nUpon crossing into Delaware, the road becomes DE&nbsp;491, which carries the name Hickman Road. A short distance past the state line, the road passes an entrance to the former Tri-State Mall and the intersection with residential Woodfield Drive. The road continues south to the east of Naamans Creek between a business to the west and homes to the east prior to ending at DE&nbsp;92 in Claymont at a right-in/right-out intersection with the westbound lanes of DE&nbsp;92.\nHistory\nWhat is now PA&nbsp;491 west of Zebley Road was designated as part of Legislative Route&nbsp;135 in 1911, a legislative route defined in the Sproul Road Bill that ran from West Chester to the Delaware border in Bethel Township. By 1920, the entire alignment of PA&nbsp;491 and DE&nbsp;491 existed as an unimproved county road. By 1925, the Delaware portion of road was completed as a state highway. PA&nbsp;491 was designated onto its current alignment running from US&nbsp;122/PA&nbsp;29 (now US&nbsp;202) east to the Delaware border in 1928. When first designated, the Pennsylvania portion of the road was paved. The route has remained on the same alignment since.\nMajor intersections\n|notes=Western terminus of PA&nbsp;491\n}}\n|notes=\n}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of DE&nbsp;491\n}}\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/de-491/ DE&nbsp;491 at AARoads.com]\n* [https://www.aaroads.com/guides/pa-491/ PA&nbsp;491 at AARoads.com]\n* [https://www.pahighways.com/state/PA451-500.html#PA491 Pennsylvania Highways: PA&nbsp;491]"
