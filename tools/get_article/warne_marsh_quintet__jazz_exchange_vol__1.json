Marsh and Konitz often thought alike musically, and this set certainly has its exciting moments. ... Highly recommended, as are the two following volumes\".\nTrack listing\n# \"April\" (Lennie Tristano) – 9:38\n# \"Blues by Lester\" (Lester Young) – 7:44\n# \"Lennie-Bird\" (Tristano) – 8:28\n# \"You Stepped Out of a Dream\" (Nacio Herb Brown, Gus Kahn) – 10:10\n# \"Kary's Trance\" (Lee Konitz) – 4:04\n# \"Background Music\" (Warne Marsh) – 10:50\n# \"Subconscious-Lee\" (Konitz) – 11:02 Bonus track on CD reissue\n*Recorded at the Café Montmatre in Copenhagen, Denmark on December 3, 1975 (track 6), December 4, 1975 (tracks 1, 5 & 7) and December 5, 1975 (tracks 2–4)\nPersonnel\n*Warne Marsh – tenor saxophone\n*Lee Konitz – alto saxophone\n*Ole Kock Hansen – piano\n*Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen – bass\n*Alex Riel (track 6), Svend Erik Nørregard (tracks 1–5 & 7) – drums\nReferences"
