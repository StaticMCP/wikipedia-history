Dating from the earliest part of the 9th century Persian Renaissance following the liberation of Shiraz from the Abbasid Caliphate, it was built over a pre-existing religious compound, most likely a fire temple.\nToday it functions as a Shi'ite Friday mosque. The 9th-century mosque is the oldest mosque in Shiraz, and was built in celebration of the reconquest of Shiraz from the Abbasids by Amr-e Laith Saffari of the Saffarid dynasty in  and was completed in . The mosque has been restored many times; and most of the present day structure a four-iwan courtyard mosque dates from the 17th century.\nIn the center of the mosque's sahn is the Khuda Khane ().}} Commissioned by Inju'id ruler Mahmud Shah (1325-1336) in 1351 for the storage of Qur'ans, this small kiosk is also known as Bayt al-Mashaf (). Both the mosque and Khuda Khane are aligned with qibla slightly east of south.\nOverview\nThe Atigh Jameh Mosque is located to the east of Shah Cheragh Shrine. Its various nocturnal areas (Shabestans) feature beautiful tile works on their ceilings. In the southern part of this mosque, there is a wall called “Nodbeh” which features a colourful depiction of a cedar. It is believed that on the night of Miraj, Buraq passed from this wall. The north gate, known as the \"Imam Gate\", is decorated with Muqarnas tiles.\nThe main structure was completed in the 9th century. In the 11th century, two iwans were added; and during the 12th century, the main prayer hall, dome, sahn, and madrasa were completed. The southern and western iwans and arcades were added during the 17th century; and major renovations and expansions were finalised in the latter part of the 18th and early 20th centuries.\nThe mosque, including \"Khuda Khane\", were both added to the Iran National Heritage List on 6 January 1932, administered by the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran.\nArchitecture\nConstruction of the Friday Mosque of Shiraz was completed in 895 CE during the reign of Saffarid ruler, Amir ibn al-Layth (878-900 CE). It was rebuilt, restored, and expanded various times thereafter; including substantive modifications, predominately during the 17th century. Damaged by numerous earthquakes, it was repaired and restored extensively after 1935.\nKhuda Khane\nThe kiosk known as Khuda Khane consists of a rectangular core, with a loggia of three arched bays on each side, with solid circular towers projecting at the outer corners. The ensemble is raised on a marble platform. Of the original structure, only the towers, the platform and the ruined inner walls remained, as of the early twentieth century. It was rebuilt between 1937 and 1954 by the Archaeological Service of Iran based on the original design.\nElongated on the north-south axis, the rectangular core of the Khuda Khane contains a square hall with four central doorways, and a small vestibule to its north housing a spiral staircase for roof access. The four doorways on its exterior three for the square hall and one leading into the vestibule are flanked by engaged columns and topped with flat muqarnas crowns.\nThe core, which measures approximately , is enveloped by  loggias to the east, west and north. The southern loggia, which faces the mosque sanctuary, is  wide. The twelve pointed arches of the veranda are carried on marble columns with bulbous bases and muqarnas capitals and square columns built into the corner towers. The arches of the east and west loggias are slightly wider; they are separated with rectangular panels resting on two pairs of columns at the center. A muqarnas cornice wraps around the loggia arcades and the corner towers below the flat roof.\nThe Khuda Khane is built of rubble masonry and clad entirely with alternating square and rectangular panels of cut stone. It is adorned with a wide tile band below the muqarnas cornice containing a white Thuluth inscription on a blue background with floral arabesques. The sides of the base platform are carved in relief with floral medallions. The date of construction  is seen on the southeast tower.\nGallery\nAtiq Jameh Mosque of Shiraz, Iran 1999 VB 01.jpg|The mosque dome\nJameh Mosque of Atigh.jpg|The mosque at night\nAli 0504.jpg|The mosque sahn, iwan, and minarets\nAli 0503.jpg|Khuda Khane\nAtigh mosque.jpg|Tiled interior muqarnas on the northern iwan\nSee also\n}}\n* Shia Islam in Iran\n* List of mosques in Iran\n* List of oldest mosques in Iran\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
