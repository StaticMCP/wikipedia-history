Deadline reported that Chad Feehan was briefly brought in as a showrunner \"out of necessity\" but soon departed the series in September 2019. When the resumption of filming was announced, Jakob Verbruggen was listed as director and executive producer with Amy Kaufman, Andrew Baldwin and Elisa Ellis also executive producers; however, it was subsequently reported that Amanda Marsalis had also directed some episodes. The first season was reported to have a $200million budget. On December 8, 2021, Apple renewed the series for a second season. The show was renewed for a third season on February 13, 2024.\nCasting\nDeadline revealed in August 2020 that Neill, Anderson, Farahani, Nassar, and Kutsuna were all to be part of the cast.\nFilming\nFilming was originally planned to start in mid-2019, with Kinberg directing, but was delayed due to his work on the feature film The 355. According to a report by Deadline, Invasion planned to film in New York, Manchester, Morocco and Japan. \"Portions of the series had been shot in New York and Morocco, and producers were prepping for the UK shoot when the coronavirus-related industry shutdown started in mid-March.\" In February 2021, filming occurred in Greenwich, one of the series' last filming locations. Filming for the first season concluded on March 15, 2021.\nRelease\nThe series premiered on Apple TV+ on October 22, 2021, with the release of its first three episodes; the first season concluded on December 10, 2021. Its second season premiered on August 23, 2023. The third season premiered on August 22, 2025.\nReception\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 48% approval rating with an average rating of 5.6/10, based on 42 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Invasion attempts a slow burn but inadvertently lets its tension completely fizzle out with leaden pacing that will leave viewers impatient for the alien apocalypse to finally arrive.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 51 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\nRogerEbert.com reviewer Nick Allen called the series \"a thrilling series about people, not aliens\", adding that the series \"is a refreshing and often thrilling juggling of plot-threads that involve incredibly flawed or hurtful decisions made in the name of survival\".\nAndrew Webster, writing for The Verge, said that \"Apple's Invasion feels like the first chapter of a sci-fi epic\", adding \"This all means that when the aliens do finally appear, it’s a huge deal.\"\nDaniel Fienberg, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, said that \"Invasion verges on 10 episodes of setup so pure and unfulfilling that a better title would be Evasion\". He called the series, \"amusing at first, then annoying, and finally, simply confusing\", but praised Sam Neill's single-episode performance in the pilot.\nFor the second season, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 67% approval rating with an average rating of 6.1/10, based on 12 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"A marked improvement if not a wholehearted vindication, Invasion second season explores the fallout of an alien takeover with impressive scope.\" Metacritic gave it a score of 63 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Chase Hutchinson, writing for Collider, said \"In its ten-episode return, the science fiction series makes its first season more like a prologue for the story it really wanted to tell.\"\nFor the third season, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 67% approval rating, based on 6 reviews.\nAccolades\nInvasion was nominated in the category of Outstanding Effects Simulations in an Episode, Commercial, Game Cinematic or Real-Time Project at the 22nd Visual Effects Society Awards.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
