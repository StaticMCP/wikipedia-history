      "text": "# Rereading Ancient Philosophy\n\nRereading Ancient Philosophy: Old Chestnuts and Sacred Cows is a 2018 book edited by Verity Harte and Raphael Woolf, in which the authors examine key texts and debates in ancient philosophy. The book is dedicated to the philosopher M. M. McCabe.\nReception\nRereading Ancient Philosophy received a mixed review from Jay R. Elliott in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. The book was also reviewed by the classicist Christopher Rowe in the Journal of the History of Philosophy.\nElliott considered the essays included in the book a \"fitting tribute\" to McCabe. However, he found them of uneven value, writing that while they were generally rewarding, some suffered \"from the pursuit of novelty\" and wrongly suggested that \"progress in ancient philosophy is currently being impeded by an abundance of widely-accepted but unexamined dogmas\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/rereading-ancient-philosophy/A28FC94572A7E5FC6FE1B021EE51E167 Rereading Ancient Philosophy: Old Chestnuts and Sacred Cows]"
