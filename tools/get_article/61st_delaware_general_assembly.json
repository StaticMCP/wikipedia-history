Elections were held the first Tuesday after November 1 and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, Delaware, convening January 5, 1841, two weeks before the beginning of the first and second year of the administration of Governor William B. Cooper.\nThe apportionment of seats was permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. Population of the county did not effect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a Whig majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Charles Polk Jr., Kent County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Robert Houston, Sussex County\nMembers\nSenate\nSenators were elected by the public for a four-year term, some elected each two year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*Abraham Boyce\n*Thomas Deakyne\n**Andrew S.
