      "text": "# Endemic flora of the Three Kings Islands\n\nOf the 199 plant taxa found on the Three Kings Islands, an archipelago  north-west of New Zealand, 177 are native to New Zealand and only a fraction Add to this five non-vascular species and two new species from 2008 and 2014 to get 19.}} are endemic (found nowhere else). The islands have likely been isolated from the mainland since the early Tertiary period and so the flora has been driven by allopatric speciation. Of note is that all of the vascular endemics are woody, other than the sedge Carex elingamita and the fern Davallia tasmanii subsp. tasmanii. In addition, the Three Kings Islands are regarded as a hotspot for seaweed endemism.\nThe islands: Great Island, South West Island, North East Island, West Island and the Princes Islands, cover a combined area of . The geography is jagged and cliffed with the highest point being . A warm current flows around them, creating a high humidity, misty environment. Before their eradication in 1946, the flora was so depleted by goats it lead two species: Pennantia baylisiana and Tecomanthe speciosa to each be reduced to a single plant. As a result, the New Zealand Threat Classification System lists these species as Nationally Critical. Other endemics are given the status Naturally Uncommon or Nationally Vulnerable because of their small geographic range, and their relatively slow recovery.\nVascular plants\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nNon-vascular plants\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
