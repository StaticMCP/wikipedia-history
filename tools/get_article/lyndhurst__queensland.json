In the , Lyndhurst had a population of 11 people.\nGeography\nThe terrain is mostly mountainous and bounded to the east by the Great Dividing Range and to the west by the Gregory Range and Gilbert Range. Named peaks include (from north to south):\n* Butlers Knob ()\n* Watch Hill ()\n* Mount Margaret ()\n* Horse Mountain ()\n* Mount Lookout ()\n* Pine Hill ()\n* Mount Devlin ()\n* Teddy Mountain ()\n* Mount Remarkable ()\nThe Einasleigh River rises in the south of the locality and flows north. The Copperfield River rises in the west of the locality and flows to the north-west of the locality. The two rivers have their confluence at the town of Einasleigh in the locality to the immediate north of Lyndhurst. The Einasleigh River has a catchment area of . Following its confluence with the Gilbert River, they spill into a vast estuarine delta approximately  wide that largely consists of tidal flats and mangrove swamps across the Gulf Country. The Einasleigh River descends  over its  course.\nBlackbraes National Park is in the south of the locality with a small extension into neighbouring Porcupine. Apart from this protected area, the predominant land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nThe Kennedy Developmental Road enters the locality from north-west (Conjuboy) and exits to south-west (Porcupine).\nThe Lyndhurst pastoral station occupies much of the northern part of the locality. In 1918 the station was reported to be purchased by the government and an area of 1,000 square miles.\nHistory\nThe town name is derived from the Lyndhurst pastoral station located close to the airstrip in Lyndhurst.\nThe Lyndhurst pastoral station / pastoral run was established about 1863 by Mr Barnes and John Fulford. The property bred prize-winning Hereford cattle.\nLyndhurst Provisional School opened in 1958 but closed on 5 December 1959. The children were transferred to the Lucky Downs school.\nThe locality was officially named and bounded on 23 June 2000. Although the origin of the name of the locality is not recorded, it presumably takes its name from the pastoral station.\nDemographics\nIn the , Lyndhurst had a population of 8 people.\nIn the , Lyndhurst had a population of 11 people.\nEconomy\nThere are a number of homesteads in the locality (from north to south(:\n* Welfern ()\n* Ballynure ()\n* Lyndhurst () with its airstrip () with IATA code LTP and ICAO code YLHS.\n* Oak Park ()\n* Werrington ()\n* Black Braes ()\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Lyndhurst. For students living in the eastern part of Lyndhurst, the nearest government primary school is Greenvale State School in neighbouring Greenvale to the east.\nHowever, the distance would be too great for a daily commute from other parts of Lyndhurst. Similarly, there are no nearby secondary school options for any part of Lyndhurst. The alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences"
