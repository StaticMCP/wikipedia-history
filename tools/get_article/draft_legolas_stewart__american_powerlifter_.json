He began strength training at age 13, inspired by WSM competitions. During his freshman year at age 15, Stewart lifted an Olympic barbell for the first time in his school’s weight room, performing over 10 repetitions with 315 lbs. This experience led him to pursue competitive powerlifting and he gained recognition among peers for his strength. At this time, he set a lifelong goal to deadlift over 1,000 lbs. Stewart began training for competitive powerlifting, entering his first competition at 16 in the 148 lb weight class. He currently works as a butcher at Manchester Market, balancing his career with training.\nPowerlifting Career\n{| style=\"float:left; margin:0; border-spacing:0;\"\n|-\n|\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; font-size:0.9em; padding:0; width:200px;\" | Legolas Stewart at the 2024 Michigan State Powerlifting Championships\n|}\nStewart competes in the APF in raw and wrapped divisions, spanning teen, junior, and open classes across weight classes from 148 lb to 220 lb.
