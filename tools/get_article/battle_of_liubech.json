It was part of the Kievan succession crisis of 1015–1019 that broke out between the brothers after the death of prince Volodimer I of Kiev (1015).\nIn Rus' chronicles\nThe most extensive narrative of the battle is found in the Primary Chronicle (PVL) sub anno 6524 (1016). Similar but divergent narratives are found in the Older and Younger Editions of the Novgorod First Chronicle (NPL).\nInitially, the eldest son Sviatopolk took the throne of Kiev (modern Kyiv), and in an attempt to get rid of other contenders for princely power, killed his brothers Boris, Gleb, and Sviatoslav the Derevlian. Sviatopolk was opposed by Yaroslav, who gathered a large army in Novgorod and then marched south. The two armies met near Liubech and reportedly did not dare to start fighting for three months.\nEventually, in late 1016, a decisive battle took place at Liubech. The main textual witnesses of the Primary Chronicle provide conflicting accounts on details (in lines 141.17–142.22) of the battle, with additional variants in the Novgorod First Chronicle.\nSynodal manuscript (NPL St.) starts in the middle of a sentence about the Battle of Liubech. The preceding folios have been lost.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+ }}\n! style=max-width:2em | Line (PVL)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Hypatian (Ipa)Radziwiłł (Rad)Academic (Aka)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Khlebnikov (Xle)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Laurentian (Lav)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Novgorod First Chronicle (NPL)Older Edition (St.)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Novgorod First Chronicle (NPL)Younger Edition (Ml.)\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.13b\n| colspan=5 align=center | И бысть сѣча\tзъла,\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align=center | –\n| colspan=4 align=center bgcolor=lightgrey | –\n| align=center | оже за рукы емлющеся сЂчаху и по удолиемъ кровь течаше; мнозЂ вЂрнии видяху аггелы божиа помагающа Ярославу;\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.14\n| colspan=3 align=center | (и) не бѣ льзѣ озеръмь Печенѣгомъ помогати,\n| colspan=2 rowspan=5 align=center bgcolor=lightgrey | –\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.15–16a\n| colspan=3 align=center | и притиснуша Святопълчь съ вои къ озеру.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.16b\n| colspan=3 align=center | И въступиша на ледъ,\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.16c–17a\n| align=center bgcolor=lightgrey | –\n| и обломисѧ ле с вои ст҃опочи и мнѡѕи потопоша въ вода. и\n| и ѡбломисѧ с ними ледъ. и\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.17b\n| colspan=3 align=center | одолати нача Ярославъ.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.17c–18\n| colspan=2 align=center | Видѣвъ же Святопълкъ, побеже, и одолѣ Ярославъ.\n| align=center | lacuna\n| colspan=2 align=center | и до свЂта победиша Святопълка.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.19a\n| colspan=3 align=center | Святопълкъ же бѣжа въ Ляхы,\n| colspan=2 align=center | И бЂжя Святопълкъ въ ПечЂнЂгы,\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align=center | –\n| colspan=4 align=center bgcolor=lightgrey | –\n| align=center | и бысть межи Чахы и Ляхы, (...).\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.19b–20\n| colspan=2 align=center | Ярославъ же сѣде Кыевѣ на столѣ отьни.\n| align=center | ꙗрославъ же сѣде кыевѣ\tна столѣ ѡтьни и дѣдни·\n| colspan=2 align=center | а Ярослав иде Кыеву, и сЂде на столЂ отця своего Володимира.\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\n|+ Textual comparison of PVL and NPL manuscripts on the Battle of Liubech in English\n! style=max-width:2em | Line (PVL)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Hypatian (Ipa)Radziwiłł (Rad)Academic (Aka)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Khlebnikov (Xle)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Laurentian (Lav)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Novgorod First Chronicle (NPL)Older Edition (St.)\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Novgorod First Chronicle'' (NPL)Younger Edition (Ml.)\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.13b\n| colspan=5 align=center | And the battle was terrible,\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| align=center | –\n| colspan=4 align=center bgcolor=lightgrey | –\n| align=center | with them clutching each other's hands and blood flowing through the valleys; many of the faithful saw God's a[n]gels helping Yaroslav;\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.14\n| colspan=3 align=center | (and) due to the lake, the Pechenegs could not help.\n| colspan=2 rowspan=5 align=center bgcolor=lightgrey | –\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.15–16a\n| colspan=3 align=center | And they pushed Sviatopolk with [his] soldiers to the lake.\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.16b\n| colspan=3 align=center | And (when) they went onto the ice,\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| 142.16c–17a\n| align=center bgcolor=lightgrey | –\n| and the ice weakened under Sviatopolk's soldiers and many drowned in the waters.\n| and the ice weakened under them.

Yaroslav entered Kiev and for the first time became prince of Kiev.\nResearcher Donald Ostrowski (2006) reasoned that the majority reading in the Hypatian (Ipa), Radziwiłł (Rad), and Academic (Aka) manuscripts represent the original text; the ice neither weakened nor broke in the original story. Nevertheless, Ostrowski comments that the later texts may well have influenced Sergei Eisenstein's 1938 historical drama film Alexander Nevsky, detailing the events of the Battle on the Ice in 1242. Rather than simply taking place \"on the ice\" (just like in the 1016 Battle of Liubech), Eisenstein's film depicts the popular misconception of the ice breaking and many Teutonic Knights drowning, differing from any of the primary sources describing the battle.\nIn the Chronicon Thietmari and the Eymund Saga\nAt the same time, the literature suggests that Yaroslav's opponent in the battle of Lyubech might not have been Sviatopolk, who, according to Thietmar of Merseburg fled to Poland immediately after Volodimer's death, and Mstislav the Brave or Sviatoslav the Derevlian.\nAccording to certain scholarly interpretations of the Eymundar þáttr hrings saga, the Varangian chief Eymund may have participated in this battle with Varangian mercenaries on Yaroslav's side, but this is contested.\nReferences\nBibliography\nPrimary sources\n* Primary Chronicle ( 1110s).\n**  (First edition published in 1930.
