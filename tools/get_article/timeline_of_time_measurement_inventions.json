Sometimes inventions are invented by several inventors around the same time, or may be invented in an impractical form many years before another inventor improves the invention into a more practical form. Where there is ambiguity, the date of the first known working version of the invention is used here.\nClassical antiquity\n*  - Egyptian obelisks are among the earliest shadow clocks.\n*  - The oldest of all known sundials, dating back to the 19th Dynasty.\n*  - A shadow clock is developed similar in shape to a bent T-square.\n* 3rd century BC - Berossos invents the hemispherical sundial.\n* 270  - Ctesibius builds a water clock.\nMedieval era\n* 11th century - Sets of hourglasses were maintained by ship's pages to mark the progress of a ship during its voyage\n* 11th century - Large town clocks were used in Europe to display local time, maintained by hand\n* 1335 - First known mechanical clock, in Milan\n* 1502 - Peter Henlein builds the first pocketwatch\n* 1522 - The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe.\nModern era\n* 1656 - Christiaan Huygens builds the first accurate pendulum clock.\n* 1676 - Daniel Quare, a London clock-maker, invents the repeating clock, that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes).\n* 1680 - Second hand introduced\n* 1737 - John Harrison presents the first stable   marine chronometer, thereby allowing for precise longitude determination while at sea\n* 1850 - Aaron Lufkin Dennison starts in Roxbury, Mass.U.S.A. the Waltham Watch Company and develops the American System of Watch Manufacturing.\n* 1884 - International Meridian Conference adopts Greenwich Mean Time for consistency with Nevil Maskelyne's 18th century observations for the Method of Lunar Distances\n* 1893 - Introduction by Webb C. Ball  of the General Railroad Timepiece Standards in North America: Railroad chronometers\n* 1921 - The Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock becomes the first clock more accurate than the rotation of the Earth\n* 1927 - Joseph Horton and Warren Marrison describe the first quartz clock at Bell Telephone Laboratories.\n* 1946 - Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell develop nuclear magnetic resonance\n* 1949 - Harold Lyons develops an atomic clock based on the quantum mechanical vibrations of the ammonia molecule\n* 1983 - Radio-controlled clocks become common place in Europe\n* 1994 - Radio-controlled clocks become common place in USA\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* 588 |oclc=10999639 |location=New York |doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01343.x|s2cid=88503681 |url=https://archive.org/details/bstj27-3-510}}"
