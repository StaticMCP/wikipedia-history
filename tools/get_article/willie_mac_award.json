It has been presented annually since 1980 to the most inspirational player on the San Francisco Giants, as voted upon by Giants players, coaches, training staff, and more recently, Giants fans. McCovey personally presented the winner with the award in a pregame ceremony at AT&T Park near the conclusion of each season until his death on October 31, 2018.\nWinners\n]]\n]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\";\"|Year||style=\";\"|Player||style=\";\"|Position\n|-\n|||||RF\n|-\n|||||LF\n|-\n|||||2B\n|-\n|||||1B\n|-\n|||||C\n|-\n||| ||P\n|-\n||| ||P\n|-\n|||||2B\n|-\n|||||SS\n|-\n|||||P\n|-\n|||||P\n|-\n|||||2B\n|-\n|||||CF\n|-\n|||||C\n|-\n||| colspan=2|(not awarded due to strike)\n|-\n|rowspan=2|||||P\n|-\n||||1B\n|-\n|||||SS\n|-\n||| ||1B\n|-\n|||||2B\n|-\n|||||CF\n|-\n|||||RF\n|-\n|rowspan=2|||||P\n|-\n||||C\n|-\n|||||3B\n|-\n|||||CF\n|-\n||| ||1B\n|-\n|||||C\n|-\n|||||SS\n|-\n||| ||C\n|-\n||| ||C\n|-\n|||||P\n|-\n|||||CF\n|-\n|||||P\n|-\n|||||C\n|-\n|||||RF\n|-\n|||||P\n|-\n|||||3B\n|-\n|rowspan=2|||||P\n|-\n||||SS\n|-\n|||||C\n|-\n|||||P\n|-\n|||Kevin Pillar||CF\n|-\n|||Mike Yastrzemski||RF\n|-\n|||LaMonte Wade Jr.||LF\n|-\n|||Wilmer Flores||2B\n|-\n|||Thairo Estrada||2B\n|-\n|||Matt Chapman||3B\n|-\n|||Willy Adames||SS\n|}\nPlaques with the names of each winner are placed in the ground surrounding the statue of Willie McCovey on the southern shore of China Basin, unofficially known as McCovey Cove.\nMatt Duffy was the first rookie winner of the award.\nSimilar MLB awards involving Giants players\nThe Hutch Award is for the \"active player who best exemplifies the fighting spirit and competitive desire to win\".
