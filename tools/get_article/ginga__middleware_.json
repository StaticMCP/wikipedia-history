Ginga is also ITU-T Recommendation for IPTV Services. It is also considered in ITU-T recommendations for Cable Broadcast services (ITU-T J.200 Recommendation series: Rec. ITU-T J.200, Rec. ITU-T J.201 and Rec. ITU-T J.202) and for Terrestrial Broadcast services by ITU-R BT.1889, ITU-R BT.1699 and ITU-R BT.1722. Ginga was developed based on a set of standardized technologies but mainly on innovations developed by Brazilian researchers. Its current reference implementation was released under the GPL license.\nGinga is divided into two main integrated subsystems, which allow the development of applications following two different programming paradigms. Those subsystems are called Ginga-NCL (for declarative NCL applications) and Ginga-J (for imperative Java applications).\nIn the case of the Brazilian Terrestrial Digital TV System, and any other Digital TV Systems following the definitions in the ABNT standards for the Ginga Middleware ABNT 15606, Ginga-J is required to be supported in fixed receivers and it is optional in portable receivers. For IPTV services following the H.761 ITU-T Recommendation, only the Ginga-NCL subsystem is required, for any terminal type.\nDevelopment\nGinga was developed by Telemídia Lab from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) and by LAViD from Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB).\nSee also\n* Nested Context Language\n* Broadcast Markup Language\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ginga.org.br/en Ginga Official Web Site]\n* [http://www.gingancl.org.br/en Ginga NCL and Ginga Communities]\n*[http://www.softwarepublico.gov.br/index_en.html Ginga Community at \"Software Público Brasileiro\"]\n*[http://www.ncl.org.br/index_en.html NCL (Nested Context Language)]\n*[http://dev.openginga.org/ Ginga Code Development Network] (Portuguese language)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714180721/http://www.nextvlatam.com/Nota.aspx?IdContenido=784 Intel and Sun will develop Ginga-J in Brazil] (16 March 2009)\n*[http://nextvlatam.com/index.php/4-free-to-air-dtt/itu-passed-ginga/ ITU passed Ginga] , NexTV Latam (6 April 2010)\n*[http://www.telemidia.puc-rio.br/ Telemídia Lab]\n*[http://www.lavid.ufpb.br/ LAViD]\n*[http://www.tmira.com/ tmira solutions] Ginga [https://web.archive.org/web/20090511114848/http://www.tmira.com/en/products/tmbroadcast broadcast server] and Ginga [https://web.archive.org/web/20090721000504/http://www.tmira.com/en/products/tmplayer iTV browser].\n*[http://www.nextvlatam.com/Nota.aspx?IdContenido=1782 Brazil invested US$27 million in five years (between 2005 and 2010)  to develop interactive TV]\n*[http://nextvlatam.com/index.php/4-free-to-air-dtt/fujitsu-launches-dtt-stbs-with-ginga/ Fujitsu launches DTT STBs with Ginga] , NexTV Latam (4 March 2011)\n*[http://nextvlatam.com/index.php/4-free-to-air-dtt/brazil-wants-to-reach-2015-with-the-100-of-tv-set-fitted-with-ginga/ Brazil wants to reach 2015 with the 100% of TV set fitted with Ginga] , NexTV Latam (14 November 2011)\n*[http://nextvlatam.com/index.php/4-free-to-air-dtt/brazil-prepares-its-ginga-pilot-run-with-return-channel/ Brazil prepares its Ginga pilot run with return channel] , NexTV Latam (14 February 2012)\n*[http://nextvlatam.com/index.php/4-free-to-air-dtt/argentina-launches-interactive-tv-soccer-app/ Argentina launches interactive TV soccer app] , TV Pública Digital (Argentina), NexTV Latam  (8 March 2012)\n*[http://nextvlatam.com/index.php/4-free-to-air-dtt/venezuela-tries-out-free-software-apps-for-dtt/ Venezuela tests free software apps for DTT] , NexTV Latam (22 Aug. 2012)\n*[http://www.abntcolecao.com.br/norma.aspx?ID=88713], ABNT NBR 15606-1\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120223011323/http://www.forumsbtvd.org.br/materias.asp?id=112], SBTVD Forum - Digital TV Standards\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706161323/http://portal.sbc.org.br/bibliotecadigital/download.php?paper=625 Ginga-J: The Procedural Middleware for the Brazilian Digital TV System ]\n*[http://www.ginga.org.br/en Official page for Ginga]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714180721/http://www.nextvlatam.com/Nota.aspx?IdContenido=784 Intel and Sun will develop Ginga-J in Brazil] (16 March 2009)\nOthers links\n* [http://gingadf.com.br], User Group Ginga-DF (Ginga Distrito Federal - BR)"
