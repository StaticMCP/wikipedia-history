Numan promoted the song on many popular television shows such as The Saturday Show and Crackerjack. It peaked at No. 20 on the UK singles chart, and was Numan's final Top 20 hit until 2003.\nOf the song Numan commented: \"Warriors was about how I felt being a pop star more or less, I felt I was losing it and slipping down the ladder of success. The line \"The ghost of the white faced clown\" was a direct reference back to the old images that I'd had before and I wanted to establish that was all done and gone, I was over my Star Wars, Buck Rogers type period\".\nThe music video for the song shown on Top of the Pops shows Numan's love of flying and his new Mad Max-style image. He commented: \"I had a lot of fun making the video for the single, sort of a mix between joy and terror. I think 'Warriors' is probably by far my favourite song on the album\".\nTrack listing\n* 12\" Single\n# \"Warriors\" – 5:51\n# \"My Car Slides (1)\" – 3:05\n# \"My Car Slides (2)\" – 4:45\n* 7\" Single\n# \"Warriors\" – 4:08\n# \"My Car Slides (1)\" – 3:01\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
