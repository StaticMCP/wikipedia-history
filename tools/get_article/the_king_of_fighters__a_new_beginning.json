It was serialized on Kodansha's digital platform Magazine Pocket from January 2018 to August 2020, with its chapters collected in six  volumes. It is an adaptation of SNK's 2016 fighting game The King of Fighters XIV. In North America, the manga was licensed by Seven Seas Entertainment, with its six volumes released from March 2020 to August 2021.\nThe series follows an ensemble of fighters drawn into a global tournament organized by a mysterious figure named Antonov. Among them is the veteran martial artist Tung Fu Rue, who mentors his students through the competition's escalating battles. As Azuma handled both writing and artwork, SNK staff collaborated closely to ensure the manga remained faithful to the game's canon.\nCritical reception to the series has been mixed, with early chapters criticized for prioritizing fight scenes over narrative development. However, critics consistently praised the faithful character designs and dynamic fight choreography, particularly in their treatment of fan-favorite characters from the game's roster.\nPlot\nYears after the last fighting tournament, \"The King of Fighters\", a fighter Antonov opens his own competition. The elder martial artist Tung Fu Rue brings his students, Shun'ei and Meitenkun's, to enter the competition and test their new powers. In the first team battle, Japan Team composed of Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon faces the Yagami Team composed of Iori Yagami, Vice and Mature. As Benimaru and Daimon win their respective fights, Iori gets turned into a berserker by the demon Orochi brought by unknown, resulting in a double knock out of both Iori and Kyo.\nIn the next match, Shun'ei faces off Art of Fighting Team's Ryo Sakazaki, but is defeated due to losing control of his powers. However, Tung and Meitenkun defeat Ryo's teammates Robert Garcia and Yuri Sakazaki. In the third match a trio of mercenaries, The Ikari Team, face the team of Mexican wrestlers. Angel, formerly a terrorist working for NESTS, loses her match against Leona Heidern, almost getting mind controlled by the power of Orochi, similar to Iori. As Ralf Jones and Clark Still win their battles against Team Mexico, Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou aid the investigation into Angel's recent change. The tournament progresses with the K' Team, composed of the former NESTS experiments (K', Kula Diamond and Maxima), face against the Team South America, composed of Nelson, Zarina, Bandeiras Hattori. NESTS's influence cause Nelson and Kula to go out of control and nearly kill K'. Meanwhile, Kyo helps Athena and Sie find an army of Kyo's replicas created by the former NESTS leader, Igniz, who aims to control one of them as his new body. Enraged, Kyo decapitates Igniz and destroys all of his replicas. Igniz tries to escape but gets incinerated by K', freeing the NESTS experiments.\nWith NESTS defeated, the tournament is interrupted by a supernatural creature, responsible for the Orochi's summon who starts to yell Verse. A criminal fighter Geese Howard battles Verse and absorbs its power, resulting into a fight against Fatal Fury Team and Team China. As this happens, the wraiths of previously deceased beings who supported Orochi and NESTS are risen by Verse's power, and face Kyo and other teams from the tournament. Once Shun'ei defeats Geese and dislocates him from his Verse-powered Nightmare form, the wraiths disappear. However, the Ikari Team learn after Verse's was defeated, its power produced the revival of more people, including the wraiths they fought and the missing Ash Crimson.\nPublication\nThe series, authored by , was first announced in November 2017 by Kodansha for free serialization on its online platform Magazine Pocket. Azuma's work was reviewed by Akihiko Ureshino, the writer behind most The King of Fighters novelizations. The King of Fighters XIV director Yasuyuki Oda noted that while the story could fit within the franchise's canon, it might significantly influence future works, as A New Beginning aimed to stay true to the game's narrative. While the original The King of Fighters XIV included additional characters as downloadable content, Azuma chose not to incorporate them.\nThe series started on January 1, 2018, and the first  volume was released on August 9, 2018. The series sold well, with Azuma noting in 2019 that the third Japanese volume ran out of print, and due to fan demand Kodansha re-printed more copies. In January 2019, the series went on a one-month hiatus due to editorial issues. However, Azuma confirmed there were no major problems and ensured the manga would resume serialization smoothly. The manga ended serialization on August 10, 2020.\nIn July 2019, Seven Seas Entertainment announced that it licensed the manga for a North American release. The six volumes, with Japanese-to-English translation handled by Daniel Komen and J.P. Sullivan, were released from March 10, 2020, to August 31, 2021.\n| OriginalISBN = 978-4-06-514076-5\n| LicensedRelDate = April 28, 2020\n| LicensedISBN = 978-1-64505-184-8\n| LineColor = E62020\n|ChapterList =\n*Round 6：\n*Round 7：\n*Round 8：\"Interval\"\n*Round 9：\n*Round 10：\n}}\n| OriginalISBN = 978-4-06-515407-6\n| LicensedRelDate = July 28, 2020\n| LicensedISBN = 978-1-64505-481-8\n| LineColor = E62020\n|ChapterList =\n*Round 11：\n*Round 12：\n*Round 13：\"Briefing\"\n*Round 14：\n*Round 15：\n}}\n| OriginalISBN = 978-4-06-517585-9\n| LicensedRelDate = November 24, 2020\n| LicensedISBN = 978-1-64505-788-8\n| LineColor = E62020\n|ChapterList =\n*Round 16：\n*Round 17：\n*Round 18：\"Strategy\"\n*Round 19：\n*Round 20：\n}}\n| OriginalISBN = 978-4-06-519051-7\n| LicensedRelDate = May 18, 2021\n| LicensedISBN = 978-1-64827-216-5\n| LineColor = E62020\n|ChapterList =\n*Round 21.\n*Round 22：\n*Round 23：\n*Round 24：\n*Round 25.\n}}\n| OriginalISBN = 978-4-06-520854-0\n| LicensedRelDate = August 31, 2021\n| LicensedISBN = 978-1-64827-280-6\n| LineColor = E62020\n|ChapterList =\n*Round 26. \"Cracks in the Sky\"\n*Round 27. \"Verse\"\n*Round 28. \"Reverse\"\n*Round 29. \"Conclusion\"\n*Round 30. \"A New Beginning\"\n}}\nReception\nThe series received generally positive reviews for its dynamic fight sequences and artwork, though some critics found the narrative lacking. Anime UK News awarded the first volume an 8 out of 10, commending its faithful adaptation of the game and the well-illustrated battles, particularly the clash between Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, which the reviewer found engaging due to their established rivalry. The OSAG rated it three out of five stars, criticizing the underdeveloped introduction of the cast but praising the tournament battles. Anime News Network argued that the manga would primarily appeal to existing fans of the franchise.\nManga Sanctuary thought, while the first volume felt like promotional material, the second one was an improvement with the introduction of Orochi, whose influence triggered Iori Yagami's berserk state—a callback to earlier games—making his battle with Kyo more compelling. The reviewer also praised Shun'ei's fight against Ryo Sakazaki for solidifying his role as Kyo's successor. AkibaStation observed that by the fourth volume the plot expanded with the reveal of manipulative factions like NESTS, which antagonized the cast in earlier games as it give Kula Diamond a more sinister portrayal.\nRegarding the artwork, AkibaStation highlighted the visually striking duel between Kyo and Iori, noting Azuma's adherence to the games' aesthetic. Manga News praised the fight choreography for mirroring The King of Fighters XIV and appreciated Azuma's game-inspired omake. Anime News Network offered mixed criticism, stating that only the female characters were well-drawn. The OSAG maintained that the art and action sequences were the manga's strongest aspects, moreover enhanced by Azuma's detailed backgrounds.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
