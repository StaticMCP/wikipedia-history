      "text": "# Admiralty in the 16th century\n\nThe Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office (1546–1707), previously known as the Admiralty Office (1414–1546),  was a government department of the Kingdom of England, responsible for the Royal Navy. First established in 1414 when the offices of the separate Admiral of the North and West were abolished and their functions unified under a single centralised command, it was headed by the Lord High Admiral of England. The department existed until 1707 when England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, after which it was known as the British Admiralty.\nUnder Henry VIII, the Admiralty supervised the creation of a \"Navy Royal\", with its own secretariat, dockyards and a permanent core of purpose-built warships. It later helped repulse the 1588 Spanish Armada during the 1585 to 1604 war with Spain, although attacks on the Spanish mainland were far less successful. By the end of the 16th century, corruption within the Admiralty had seriously weakened the Royal Navy, leading to a government enquiry and calls for naval reform.\nHistorical overview\nAlthough a small permanent navy was first established during the ninth century, it quickly disappeared and pre-16th century monarchs largely relied upon requisitioned merchant ships for their needs. Maritime affairs were managed directly by the Crown until the appointment of a Lord High Admiral in 1385,  with administration and operations divided into three regions, the North Sea, English Channel and Irish Sea, each commanded by an admiral. These regional commands were abolished in 1414 and their functions and jurisdiction centralised under a single Admiralty Office, although they did not disappear entirely disappear; the Admiral of the Narrow Seas, first established in 1412, continued to exist as a separate command subordinate to the Lord High Admiral.\nAs the Royal Navy expanded under Henry VIII of England, increasing costs and complexity required the appointment of specialist departments, including Clerk of the Acts, Comptroller of the Navy (Navy Board), Treasurer of the Navy and Surveyor of the Navy. In 1546, these offices and functions were brought together in the Council of the Marine, a group directed by the Lieutenant of the Admiralty until 1557. Later known as the Navy Board, this was the first permanent attempt to establish an effective naval administration, with responsibility for ship building, maintenance and administration of the Royal Navy Dockyard, although operational matters remained under the Lord High Admiral.\nA fifth officer, the Surveyor of Marine Victuals, was added in 1550 with responsibility for food and drink, along with a Board of Ordnance under a Master of the Ordnance, an independent body which supervised the storage and issuing of weapons and gunpowder at the main naval Bases. For the next six decades, this system of administration did not change, except in 1557 the Treasurer of the Navy took over supervision of the Navy Board, which remained independent until 1628 when it became a subsidiary body of the Board of Admiralty. The Treasurer also reported independently to the Lord High Treasurer in order to provide funds for the navy, although spending and administration remained the responsibility of the Navy Board.\nOrganisational structure\nDuring the 16th century, the Admiralty consisted of the Lord Admiral of England, supported by the Vice-Admiral of England and the Lieutenant of the Admiralty, responsible for the control and direction of naval operations, civil affairs, logistical support and judicial administration of the admiralty courts.\nLord Admirals of England\nFirst established in 1385 as \"High Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine\", the position was re-styled \"Lord Admiral of England\" in 1512, then \"Lord High Admiral\" from 1638 onward. As titular head of the Royal Navy and one of the Great Officers of State, the role was generally filled by a member of the senior nobility or Royal family, such as Henry's illegitimate son Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset. His official duties included civil and judicial administration of the admiralty courts as head of the High Court of Admiralty, as well as naval operations, although many of the latter responsibilities were absorbed by the Council of the Marine in 1545 leaving the Lord Admiral to concentrate on judicial affairs.\nHigh Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine, 1500–1512\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

At that time there were three such courts, appointed by Admirals responsible for waters to the Admiral of the North, Admiral of the South and Admiral of the West of England. In 1483 it absorbed the jurisdiction of the deputies and courts these regional courts eventually amalgamated into a single High Court of Admiralty, administered by the Lord High Admiral of England. The Lord High Admiral directly appointed judges to the court, and could remove them at will. From its inception in 1483 until 1657 the Court sat in a disused church in Southwark, and from then until 1665 in Montjoy House, a private premises leased from the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral. The function of an admiralty court initially in the 14th century was to deal with piracy and other offences committed upon the high seas. However, it did not take long for those early courts to seek to manifest control over all things to do with shipping, such as mercantile matters. This led to a running battle between the admiralty courts and the common law courts as to which court had jurisdiction over particular issues.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #  !! Post !! Dates !!

A vice-admiralty court is in effect an admiralty court. The word “vice” in the name of the court denoted that the court represented the Lord Admiral of the United Kingdom. In English legal theory, the Lord Admiral, as vice-regal of the monarch, was the only person who had authority over matters relating to the sea. the holder of the post Vice-Admiral of the Coast was responsible for the defence of one of the twenty maritime counties of England, the North and South of Wales. The Lord Admiral would authorize others as his deputies or surrogates to act. Generally, he would appoint a person as a judge to sit in the court as his surrogate.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Bothwell, J.S. (2004).
