The album was released on September 22, 2009. Led by the single \"Fire Burning\", the album peaked at number 37 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart with 13,000 copies sold in the first week of release. The next week it fell to number 87.\nBackground and composition\nThe majority of the album was produced by J.R. Rotem, while also featuring productions from Detail, RedOne, Emanuel Kiriakou, DJ Frank E and others. Kingston worked with various songwriters on Tomorrow, including then-unknown American singer Bruno Mars, who co-wrote five tracks, Philip Lawrence, Diane Warren and Somali-Canadian rapper K'naan.\nTomorrows sound is significantly different from the sound of his debut, Sean Kingston. In this new LP, he explores sounds of 1990s eurodance and electropop, using instruments such as the Roland 808 drum machine, the Auto-Tune effect and synthesizers, while retaining his signature pop and reggae style.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = About.com\n| rev1Score =  [http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/seankingstontomorrow.htm link]\n| rev2 = AllMusic\n| rev2Score =  [ link]\n| rev3 = BBC\n| rev3Score = fairly positive [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/9crg/ link]\n| rev4 = Boston Globe\n| rev4Score = fairly positive [http://www.boston.com/ae/music/cd_reviews/articles/2009/09/21/sean_kingstons_tomorrow_targets_the_wrong_season/ link]\n| rev5 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev5Score = C+ [https://ew.com/article/2009/09/16/tomorrow-2]\n| rev6 = Now\n| rev6Score =  [http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/discs.cfm?content=171405 link]\n| rev7 = Rolling Stone\n| rev7Score =  [https://web.archive.org/web/20100316132708/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/30067259/review/30083964/tomorrow link]\n| rev8 = USA Today\n| rev8Score =  [https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2009-09-21-listen-up-kingston_N.htm link]\n}}\nDavid Jeffries of AllMusic favored songs \"Fire Burning\", \"Face Drop\", \"My Girlfriend\", \"Shoulda Let U Go\", and \"Ice Cream Girl\" and feels \"\"Tomorrow\" proves Kingston can provide a whole album's worth of pool-side entertainment even without the 'Beautiful Girls'-sized single.\" Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone said \"For the most part--despite Auto-Tuned slow songs--Kingston's mix of young-adult desire and disco heat shows he can cross over in unexpected directions.\" Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly felt that \"Although he's got plenty of hooks, personality is in much shorter supply\". While some of his reviews are positive, others feel his album lacks novelty and interest. Jason Richards of Now Magazine said that although he is a good singer-songwriter, his album lacks novelty and feels irritating.  Apparently to Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, Kingston's collections of \"silly lyrics and robotic tempos of Sean Kingston’s sophomore album slide if it were mid-July and we were in the mood for Euro-disco/reggae mash-ups, and straight-up electro-pop.\" Bill Lamb of About.com:\nIt's abundantly clear on Tomorrow that Sean Kingston plans to stick around for awhile. He demonstrates he can play well with other artists on the bouncy \"Shoulda Let Go\" which is co-produced by Drum Up (LaMar Seymour, LaNelle Seymour) for Drum Up Digital and featuring a rock chorus from Good Charlotte and a rhythmic vocal workout with Wyclef Jean on \"Ice Cream Girl.\" At least half of the songs here could be pop hit singles and fit easily into contemporary pop radio playlists. Sean Kingston may want to consider stripping his sound down a bit more, but Tomorrow is far from an unpleasant listening experience. Sean Kingston has successfully delivered the goods he has to offer a second time around.\nTrack listing\n| length1 = 0:57\n| title2 = War\n| extra2 = J.R.
