It was used by Ming and Qing emperors to perform sacrifices to Xiannong (先农), the mythical Emperor Yandi (c. 2900 BC-2800 BC), who is said to have invented the plow, discovered the medicinal uses of plants, and created the first marketplaces.\nThe temple's Jufu Hall was included in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund (WMF) when it was in danger of collapse, and again in 2000 along with the rest of the temple. In 1998, American Express provided funding through WMF for the restoration of the structure. Other structures on the site were subsequently restored, and the work included stabilization, wood treatment, repair and conservation of the tiles, and consolidation and preservation of the painted decoration. Today, the site has the status of Major Site Protected at the National Level of China.\nIn artwork\nSee also\n* Nine Altars and Eight Temples\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110516181717/http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_article/pg_28-33_xiannontang.pdf Erling Ho, ICON Magazine, \"Rites of Spring: Beijing’s Xiannontang, an imperial altar complex honoring the gods of agriculture, gets a long-overdue facelift,\" Spring 2004, p. 28-33.]\n*[http://www.chinaharmonytravel.com/guide/attraction.aspx?aid=560 Altar of Agriculture (Xiannong tan)]"
