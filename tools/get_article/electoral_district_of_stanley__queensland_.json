From 1878 it became a two-member constituency through incorporation of part of the Electoral district of West Moreton\nfrom which it had been derived in 1872. Stanley was abolished in the 1949 redistribution which placed most of it in the new Electoral district of Somerset.\nMembers\nThe following people represented Stanley:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
