Originally the '''Hawker's Sports Ground, it was built and owned by the Hawker Aircraft company who had factories in Kingston-upon-Thames. The ground was known prior to 1948 as the Leyland Motors Ground''', due to Hawker leasing their factory to Leyland Motors, a lease which expired in 1948. The aircraft factory was demolished in 1990 which alongside storage units were converted into a residential area keeping the sports ground. Since 2001 the ground has been maintained by the YMCA St Paul's Group under a lease by the Borough.\nCricket\nThe first recorded match on the ground was in 1944, when Leyland Athletic played London Counties. The ground hosted its first first-class match in 1946, when Surrey played Hampshire. These first matches were organised to help raise money to repair the damage done to The Oval in the Second World War. A venue for first-class cricket from 1946 to 1953, it hosted first-class cricket for no less than seven teams, with the final first-class match at the ground in 1953 seeing an England XI play a Commonwealth XI.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/558.html Hawker's Sports Ground] on CricketArchive\n*[http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/ground/57080.html Hawker's Sports Ground] on Cricinfo\n*[https://ymcastpaulsgroup.org/centres/ymca-hawker/ Hawker Centre] on [YMCA St Paul's group]"
