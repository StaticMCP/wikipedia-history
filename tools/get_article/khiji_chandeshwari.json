They have their own traditions, cultures, language and customs etc. The rest are NEWAR, Bhujel and Sherpa also indigenous, and Pariyar (Hindu caste), Bishokarma also (Hindu caste). Indigenous people are not Hindu caste.\nOccupations\nAround 95% of villagers are depended on agriculture. They have little piece of land where they cultivate crops in a traditional way. The agriculture products last for only 6–8 months and the rest of the year they just live with half stomach.\nEducation\nEducation is light of life.

After the completion of lower secondary and high secondary education the students need to walk at least 90 minutes to reach the 10+2 which are situated in other Villages. There are very few students who have the luck to see the college and university. They can be count on fingers.\nश्री चन्डेश्वरी माध्यमिक विद्यालय, खिजी ओखलढुङ्गा Shree Chandeshwari Madhyamik Vidyalaya Koshpala, Khiji, Okhaldhunga, Nepal\nDevelopment\nThe district headquarters is approximately 35 kilometers from the village. Almost all local development administrations are situated in the headquarters of the district. Being an uneducated people, there is no one to support for the development of the village. There is no infrastructural development in the village except a health post and a lower secondary school. It takes around 18 hours to reach the close road transportation from the village. Many people even just day dream about motor-bus and aero-planes. They did not see the real motor buses and aero planes in their life. There is no electricity, so the villagers have to depend on wood fuel. There is no safe drinking water and irrigation for agriculture. There is no any scientific cultivation system. People just follow traditional agriculture system and depend on rainfall for cultivation. All the above-mentioned truths are the true story of Khijee Chandeswari Village.\nLanguage\nSunuwar koich Lo sunuwar\nHalli Game\nHalli is Game of Sunuwar : हाल्ली खेल\nSakela Naach\nSunuwar culture\nTrekking area\nKhiji Tholedemaba trek and route of Everes Base camp\nKhiji-school.JPG|At School (Thai Guest)\nKhijee-agriculture.JPG|Rice Field\nFile:Khijee-village.jpg|Gaun, village\nFile:Khijee-Gaungtol.jpg|House\nFile:Khiji-hydro.JPG|Powerhouse\nFile:Khijee-tholedamba.jpg|Tholedemba\nFile:Khijee-toledamba.jpg|Tholedemba\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.facebook.com/khijee khijee]\n*[http://durgasunuwar.wix.com/khijee khijee web]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrduIwwqgM8 khijee video]\n*[http://www.un.org.np/maps/district-maps/mid-eastern/Okhaldhunga.pdf UN map of the municipalities of Okhaldhunga District]"
