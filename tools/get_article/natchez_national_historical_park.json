It was later renamed Fort Panmure and controlled in turn by Great Britain, Spain, and the United States.  The fort site is open to the public.\nThe William Johnson House was the home of William Johnson, a 19th-century free African American barber and resident of Natchez whose diary has been published.\nMelrose was the estate of John T. McMurran, a lawyer, state senator, and planter who lived in Natchez from 1830 until the Civil War.\nForks of the Road marks what was the second-busiest slave trading market in the Deep South between 1832 and 1863. This unit of the park opened in an official ceremony on June 18, 2021.\nBoth Melrose and the William Johnson House contain furnishings related to life in antebellum Natchez and other exhibits.  The collection at Melrose's two-story Greek Revival mansion and its slave quarters include painted floor cloths, mahogany, a punkah, a set of Rococo Revival parlor furniture, a set of Gothic Revival dining room chairs, and bookcases with books dating to the 18th century.  These were collected from Natchez families, including the McMurran family.  The collection in the Johnson house includes furnishings from his life and family.  Archaeological objects found in the park are also on display.\nLegal history\nThe National Historical Park was authorized on October 7, 1988 (, ).  The William Johnson House was added to it on September 28, 1990 (, ).  As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, the park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nFort Rosalie was already included in the National Register as part of the 1972 NRHP-listed Natchez Bluffs and Under-the-Hill Historic District;  the William Johnson House, at 210 State St., is a few blocks from the Fort Rosalie site and is both separately NRHP-listed and also included in the Natchez On-Top-of-the-Hill Historic District.  Melrose is located about two miles southeast of Fort Rosalie.\nReferences\n* The National Parks: Index 2001–2003.
