The population was 1,637 at the 2020 census and is estimated to be 2,330 as of 2023.\nHistory\nPrior to English colonization, the area of Warsaw, Virginia was occupied by a group of Rappahannock Native Americans, who would fish on the nearby creeks for shad and herring. By 1667, the Rappahannock people had been forced to sell all their land north of the Rappahannock River to English settlers, including the modern site of Warsaw.\nAfter the division of the Old Rappahannock County in 1692, Richmond County was created. The new county had its seat at Richmond Court House, which was originally along the shores of the Rappahannock River. The site of Richmond Court House was moved inland to modern Warsaw in 1730, and the modern court house was built in 1748. The area was also the home of Robert Wormeley Carter, who represented Richmond County in the Virginia House of Burgesses and the Continental Congress as a supporter of the American Revolution; he owned the historic house of Sabine Hall, located near Richmond Court House. Additionally, the region was subjected to intense British raids during the War of 1812, and many free men of the town were rallied in its defense from the British army. During this time, the area's economy grew reliant on tobacco, as a small group of wealthy planters grew the crop with the labor of indentured settlers and enslaved Africans.\nIn January 1832, the town's name was changed to Warsaw, after the news of \"great uprisings in Old World Warsaw\" in 1830 and 1831 reached residents. This change was due to local popular support for the November Uprising in Poland. As with Richmond Court House, a number of other small towns in the United States changed their names to Warsaw at this time, such as Warsaw, Kentucky.\nFollowing the Civil War, the area's newly emancipated freedmen made efforts to secure their own churches and schools. Ultimately, the region's schools and churches would be formally desegregated with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, though all schools in the region would not be fully integrated until the 1970s.\nToday, Warsaw is one of many small towns in Virginia's Northern Neck region. The town prides itself on its schools, natural beauty, and quality of life.\nGeography\nWarsaw is located at  (37.957617, −76.758302).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all  land.\nClimate\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters.
