An area of disturbed weather developed within the vicinity of the Caroline Islands during the second week of July. A tropical depression developed southeast of Guam on July&nbsp;12, and on the next day, intensified into a tropical storm. Tracking generally west-northwest, Warren deepened into a typhoon on July&nbsp;14. The storm subsequently entered a period of rapid intensification, commencing with Warren reaching its highest intensity on July&nbsp;16. The following evening, the typhoon brushed Luzon, resulting in a weakening trend, although Warren was still a typhoon when it made landfall near Shantou. Warren rapidly dissipated inland.\nAcross the Philippines, 3,560 houses were damaged and 21,329 more were destroyed, displacing 19,224 families. Six people were killed and damage was estimated at US$11.4&nbsp;million. In Hong Kong, severe flooding occurred, especially in low-lying areas, several trees were downed, and there were reports of five landslides. There, 13 people were injured. In Shantou, six people died, 106 were injured, 4,500 homes were destroyed and 38,000 were damaged. Throughout Guangdong Province, 150,000 homes were damaged and 13,000 were destroyed. Overall, 17 people died and 153 were wounded. Financial damage was estimated at $270&nbsp;million.\nMeteorological history\nTyphoon Warren developed from an area of disorganized convection in the eastern Caroline Islands that was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on July&nbsp;11. An increase in organization and improved upper-level outflow promoted the JTWC to raise its development chances. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system, which was located around  southeast of Guam, at 05:30&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;12. Shortly thereafter, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the system a tropical depression|group=\"nb\"}}|group=\"nb\"}} At noon, satellite images showed a central dense overcast and satellite intensity estimates supported winds of . At 16:00&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;12, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical depression. Tracking westward, the depression passed within  north of Guam. On the morning of July 13, the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Warren by the JTWC, although post-storm analysis revealed that the depression actually became a tropical storm late on July&nbsp;12. At 00:00 UTC on July 14, the JMA declared the system a tropical storm, with the JTWC upgrading Warren to a typhoon that evening.\nTracking west-northwestward while also accelerating, Warren continued to gradually deepen. On the morning of July&nbsp;15, the JMA designated Warren a severe tropical storm. At the time of the upgrade, Warren was located around  east of Manila. Twenty-four hours later, the JMA upped Warren into a typhoon. Around this time, the storm entered a rapid intensification phase, with the JTWC estimating that Warren reached its peak intensity of , equal to a low-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, on July&nbsp;16. Around the same time, the JMA estimated that Warren achieved its peak intensity of  and a minimum barometric pressure of .\nWhile tracking across the Philippine Sea, many tropical cyclone forecast models showed Warren tracking northward near Taiwan and eventually recurving out to sea. Forecasters at the JTWC continued to predict a westward motion because satellite imagery and mid-level synoptic analysis showed a subtropical ridge to its north. According to the JTWC, the typhoon weakened slightly on July&nbsp;17, though data from the JMA suggested that Warren maintained its maximum intensity until Warren skirted Luzon that evening. Land interaction resulted in some weakening, with the JTWC and JMA lowering the intensity of the typhoon to  and  at 00:00&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;18. After entering the South China Sea, Warren made landfall near the city of Shantou on the morning of July&nbsp;19. At the time, the JTWC estimated winds of  while the JMA reported winds of . The storm rapidly weakened overland, and the storm dissipated on July&nbsp;20 over the province of Guangdong.\nPreparations and impact\nThe inner core of the typhoon brushed the northern Philippines, prompting flooding that resulted in the suspension of classes. Around 60&nbsp;people fled their homes in Baguio. Somewhere in the northern portion of the country, a man was killed when his motorcycle skidded on a slippery road as he went to inspect storm damage. Nationwide, the storm damaged  of rice and  of corn. Approximately 1,600&nbsp;families lost access to drinking water. A total of 3,560&nbsp;homes were damaged and an additional 21,329&nbsp;were destroyed, which resulted in 102,169&nbsp;people or 19,224&nbsp;families that either sought shelter or were homeless. Six people were killed in the country. The storm inflicted US$11.4&nbsp;million in damage to the country, including $10.1&nbsp;million from infrastructure.\nFurther north, in Hong Kong, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued on July&nbsp;18. Later that day, the signal was increased to a No. 3 signal, but on July&nbsp;20, all signals were dropped. A minimum pressure of  was recorded at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory (HKO) on July&nbsp;19, when the storm made its closest approach to Hong Kong. Tai Mo Shan recorded a peak wind speed of . Meanwhile, Tate's Cairn observed a peak wind gust of . North Point observed  of rain over a five-day period, including  in a 24-hour period. In Hong Kong, severe flooding occurred, especially in low-lying areas, several trees were downed, and five minor landslides were reported. Many village houses were submerged. In Sheung Shui, more than 20&nbsp;people were stranded. About  of ponds were flooded and  of fish were lost, worth $760,000. In addition,  of agricultural land were also flooded, resulting in the drownings of 1,370&nbsp;pigs and 133,000&nbsp;poultry. Along the Tuen Mun Highway, a  tree collapsed, damaging a van and injuring two men. Seventeen flights were called off at the airport and ferry services to Tap Mun, Macau, and mainland China were suspended. Throughout Hong Kong, 12&nbsp;people were injured and a 5-year-old boy was reported missing after falling into the sea at a local park.\nThroughout Shantou, six people were killed and 106&nbsp;people were injured. There,  of food were lost. About 4,500 houses and 14,000&nbsp;huts collapsed, and 38,000&nbsp;houses sustained damage. About  of agricultural area were destroyed, of which  were paddy fields.
