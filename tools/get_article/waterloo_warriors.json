The Warriors have found success over certain spans in football, hockey, rugby, golf and basketball among others, and the Warriors have won national championships in ice hockey (1974), basketball (1975), and women's swimming (1975). For many years from the 1960s through the 1990s, Warrior basketball games attracted the largest and rowdiest basketball crowds in the country. The Warriors Football teams have won two Yates Cup Championships, in 1997 and in 1999.\nThe Warriors have two sites used for varsity athletics; The Physical Activities Complex (PAC) located on the main campus is the site of the Carl Totzke Court, which is used primarily for basketball, while the Columbia Ice Field (CIF) complex on the north campus houses the Columbia Icefield Arena for Ice hockey, as well as Warrior Field on the opposite end, which has been the home of Warriors football since 2011.\nPrior to 2011 the Warriors football team shared University Stadium with the nearby Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks. The stadium was originally built for the Warriors Football program, but was sold to the Regional Municipality of Waterloo in 1974 when the department could not afford repairs to the stadium. The stadium was later sold by the City of Waterloo to Wilfrid Laurier University in 1992, where it is now the home of the Golden Hawks.\nVarsity sports\n{| class=\"wikitable\"; style= \"text-align: \"\n! width= 150px style=\"\"| Men's sports\n! width= 150px style=\"\"| Women's sports\n|-\n| Badminton || Badminton\n|-\n| Baseball ||  Basketball\n|-\n| Basketball || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country || Curling\n|-\n| Curling || Fencing\n|-\n| Fencing || Field hockey\n|-\n| Figure skating || Figure skating\n|-\n| Football || Golf\n|-\n| Golf || Ice hockey\n|-\n| Ice hockey || Lacrosse\n|-\n| Nordic skiing || Nordic skiing\n|-\n| Rowing || Rugby\n|-\n| Rugby || Soccer\n|-\n| Soccer || Softball\n|-\n| Squash || Squash\n|-\n| Swimming || Swimming\n|-\n| Tennis || Tennis\n|-\n| Track and field || Track and field\n|-\n| Volleyball || Volleyball\n|}\nFootball\nThe Waterloo Warriors football team has been in operation since 1957, winning two Yates Cup conference championships in 1997 and 1999.
