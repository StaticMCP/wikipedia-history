He was the son of Zeno, the Isaurian general and future emperor, and Ariadne, a daughter of the emperor Leo I (). Leo II was made co-emperor with his grandfather Leo I on 17 November 473, and became sole emperor on 18 January 474 after Leo I died of dysentery. His father Zeno was made co-emperor by the Byzantine Senate on 29 January, and they co-ruled for a short time before Leo II died in late 474. He is sometimes surnamed with the epithet \"the Small\" (; ), probably to distinguish him from his grandfather and augustus Leo I ().. \"After the coronation of the child the two Leos would be distinguished as Λέων ὁ Μέγας and Λέων ὁ Μικρός, and this I believe, must be the origin of the designation of Leo as 'the Great'; just as reversely Theodosius II. was called 'the Small', because in his infancy he had been known as ὁ μικρός βασιλεύς to distinguish him from Arcadius. Leo never did anything which could conceivably earn him the title of Great in the sense in which it was bestowed by posterity on Alexander or Constantine.\"}}\nHistory\nof Leo II, showing Leo and Zeno enthroned and nimbate and each holding a mappa, marked:  (\"the Welfare of the State\")|alt= Gold coin showing two figures seated on a throne.

He was the maternal grandson of Emperor Leo I and Empress Verina. As the grandson of Leo I, Leo II had a strong claim to succeed his throne. Leo I, who was becoming increasingly ill, felt obligated to declare a successor to the imperial throne, but passed over his son-in-law on account of his unpopularity. Accordingly, Leo II was made  (heir to the throne) by Leo I around October 472, and other authors relied for the 473 date on the arguments of Otto Seeck, who followed Theodorus Lector and Kedrenos in linking Leo II's elevation to ' with the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. However, modern scholars date the event to 472.}} and was later promoted to ' (also by Leo I) in November 473, making him co-emperor alongside his grandfather. He was crowned at the Hippodrome of Constantinople, and the ceremony was presided over by the Ecumenical Patriarch Acacius. The 10th-century ' gives a detailed account of his coronation as ', which is dated to 17 November 473. This, however, would necessitate labeling the entire document as fake, which is highly unlikely.}} He was also appointed as the sole consul for 474 around this time.\nWhen Leo I died of dysentery on 18 January 474, Leo II acceded to the throne as sole . The historian Warren Treadgold wrote that during the reign of Leo II, his father Zeno was the true power behind the throne. On 29&nbsp;January 474, hence why Leo's death is usually given as 18 January. However, and contradictorily, scholars often used 9 February for Zeno's coronation.}} the Byzantine Senate, with the approval of Empress Verina, made his father Zeno co-' under Leo II, as Leo was too young to sign official documents. Leo II died in Constantinople shortly after 10 October 474. The 6th-century writer John Malalas states that he reigned \"1 year and 23 days\", which, reckoning from his coronation as ', would give a death date of 8/9 December. However, he also states that Leo died on \"November of the 13th indiction... as was written by the most learned Nestorianos, whose chronicle ended with Leo\". Theodorus Lector, another 6th-century historian, states that Leo II died after a rule of 10 months, that is, from January to November 474. This is also corroborated by the 9th-century writer Theophanes the Confessor. The 20th-century Byzantinist George Ostrogorsky simply wrote that Leo II died sometime in the autumn of 474. He died aged 7, which is corroborated by the 6th-century writers John Malalas and John of Ephesus. The death of Leo II left Zeno as sole emperor.\nHis death having occurred so soon after he became emperor has led to speculation among some modern scholars that he was poisoned by either his mother or father so that Zeno could become sole emperor. However, no contemporary sources raised this suggestion even though Zeno was unpopular; thus it is considered likely that Leo II's death was natural, especially taking into account the high child mortality rate of the time. Victor of Tunnuna, a 6th-century chronicler, says that Leo II did not actually die, but was rather taken by Ariadne and hidden at a monastery. This is likely a confusion with Basiliscus, the son of the Byzantine commander Armatus. Basiliscus was crowned  in 476 and was almost executed in 477 after his father was murdered by Zeno, but was saved by Ariadne. The confusion likely stems from the fact that Basiliscus was renamed Leo in order to avoid association with the usurper who rose against Zeno.\nZeno was vastly unpopular due to a lack of dynastic prestige, with his only familial ties to the imperial throne being his marriage to Ariadne, the daughter of Leo I, and through his now-dead son Leo II. Additionally, because he was an Isaurian, he was seen as a foreigner by the Byzantine elite, and the treasury was empty on his ascension. Zeno's sole rule was opposed by general Basiliscus, brother of Verina, the widow of Leo I, who proclaimed him as emperor in January 475. Zeno fled, and Basiliscus ruled for 20 months before Zeno returned and retook the throne. Zeno's rule was marked by constant revolts, and it was only through cunning, bribery and luck that he managed to rule for 17 years until his death on 9 April 491.\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nPrimary sources\n*Anonymus Valesianus II (Anonymous, 6th century).\n*Chronicon Paschale (Anonymous, 7th century).\n*Makhtbhanuth Zabhne (Bar Hebraeus, 13th century).\n*Chronicle of Domninos (6th century).\n*Ecclesiastical History of Evagrius Scholasticus (6th century).\n*Book XIV of the Chronographia of John Malalas (6th century).\n*Romana (Jordanes, 6th century).\n*Chronicle of Michael the Syrian (12th century).\n*Chronicle of Nestorianos (6th century).\n*Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor (8th century).\n*Chronicle of Victor of Tunnuna (6th century).\n*Extracts of History (Joannes Zonaras, 12th century).\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* |author-link=Alison E.
