Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nMichigan voted for the Democratic candidate, Lewis Cass, over Whig candidate Zachary Taylor and Free Soil candidate Martin Van Buren. Cass won his home state, for which he was serving as a United States Senator, by a margin of 10.44%. This was the last time until 1968 that a Democrat would carry Michigan without winning the presidency.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Michigan\nReferences"
