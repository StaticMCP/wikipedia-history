In September 2020, Saudi Media Company (SMC) obtained the management rights for operating the stadium. In October 2020, SMC signed a deal with Al Nassr FC for the Al-Awwal Park to become their home stadium. The stadium has a current capacity of 25,000.\nIt is set to be a venue for the 2034 FIFA World Cup and has a proposed capacity of 46,319 people following refurbishments, where it will host fixtures in the group stage and round of 32. It will also host matches for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, specifically the group stage and round of 16.\nDescription\nRefurbishments\nThe stadium began construction in 2011 and was opened in May 2015. Refurbishments will take place from 2030 to 2032, in preparations for the 2034 World Cup.\nThe renovated stadium will feature an elliptical lightweight spoke-wheel roof and strategically placed amenities designed to ensure accessibility and compliance with FIFA standards. Located on the King Saud University campus in western Riyadh, the stadium offers convenient access from the city center. Surrounding the stadium are additional sports facilities, such as an arena, swimming pool, and tennis courts. Adjacent to the venue is the bustling U Walk, a mixed-use King Saud University development that includes commercial and retail spaces.\nPost-2034\nFollowing the World Cup, the stadium will serve as the home for King Saud University teams, supporting university sports, community activities, and women’s football. At this stage, part of the upper tier will be removed, reducing the stadium’s capacity to 33,000.\nHistory\nThe construction work on the campus of King Saud University in Western Riyadh started in Spring 2011 and the opening took place in May 2015. The construction work was commissioned to Hashem Contracting Company, based on designs by Michael KC Cheah and his wife Steph, expanding their architectural portfolio of Saudi-based football stadia.\nHashem Contracting Company delivered the stadium following specifications (and FIFA rules for international games) within the budget of 215 million riyals ($57m). The stadium may seem soil-brown or gold depending on the sunlight due to its perforated and metallic outer skin. Mrsool Park went through a renovation at the end of 2020 and this will continue going forward to transform it into a young and family-friendly destination with fan zones and entertainment areas for everyone to enjoy.\nIn 2020, the stadium went through a re-branding operation becoming Mrsool Park in November 2020, following the signing with the delivery company Mrsool.\nIn 2021, the stadium hosted the Maradona Cup between Boca Juniors and FC Barcelona to honor Diego Maradona, who died the previous year.\nIn April 2023, the stadium was renamed Al-Awwal Park after Saudi Awwal Bank signed a $15 million sponsorship deal for the next three years.\nNotable matches\n* 2024 Supercopa de España final\n* 2023 Supercoppa Italiana final\nEvents\n* WWE Crown Jewel (2018)\n* WWE Crown Jewel (2022)\n* PFL 10 (2024)\nGallery\nPlayers tunnel - King Saud University Stadium.jpg|Al-Awwal Park players tunnel\nMrsool Park Locker Room.jpg|Al-Awwal Park locker room\nSee also\n*List of football stadiums in Saudi Arabia\n*Lists of stadiums\nReferences"
