The film stars Josh Holloway, Chris Brown, Laz Alonso, Caity Lotz, and Josh Peck.\nBattle of the Year is based upon Lee's award-winning 2007 documentary Planet B-Boy, about the b-boying competition of the same name. The feature film includes cinematography by Vasco Nunes, Lee's director of photography on the original documentary.\nThe film was released theatrically on September 20, 2013 by Sony Pictures Releasing. It received negative reviews from critics, and grossed $16 million against a budget of $20M.\nPlot\nDante Graham enlists Jason Blake to coach the United States' b-boy team to compete in the Battle of the Year, as the US has not won in 15 years. Blake puts together a team of the best b-boys across America à la Dream Team.\nAfter overcoming their differences and learning to work as a team, the Dream Team makes it to the semi-finals, beats the reigning champion French team and finds themselves against the favorites, the Koreans. Ultimately, they lose by one point. Blake resolves to resume training as soon as possible to win next year.\nCast\n* Josh Holloway as Jason Blake\n* Chris Brown as \"Rooster\"\n* Josh Peck as Franklyn\n* Laz Alonso as Dante Graham\n* Caity Lotz as Stacy\n* Jon \"Do Knock\" Cruz as \"Do Knock\"\n* Ivan \"Flipz\" Velez as \"Flipz\"\n* Richard Carmelo Soto as \"Abbstarr\"\n* Terrence J as himself\n* Sway Calloway as himself\n* Anis Cheurfa as Anis\n* Weronika Rosati as Jolene\n* Alex Martin as \"Punk\"\n* Dominic Sandoval as \"Grifter\"\n* Steve Terada as \"Sight\"\n* Victor Kim as \"Aces\"\n* Jesse \"Casper\" Brown as \"Rebel\"\n* David \"Kid David\" Shreibman as \"Kid\"\n* Luis \"Luigi\" Rosado as \"Bambino\"\n*Sawandi Wilson as \"Sniper\"\nDevelopment\nFilm company Screen Gems first began planning for a feature film adaptation of Lee's documentary Planet B-Boy in 2009 after discovering that while interest in breakdancing had declined in the United States, it still enjoyed popularity in other countries. Chris Brown and Josh Holloway were announced as being attached to the project in October 2011. Filming began in late 2011 in Los Angeles, with more filming taking place in Montpellier, France.\nMarketing\nThe first trailer for Battle of the Year was released in July 2013, with Adam Chitwood, Associate Editor of Collider stating that \"if B-boy competitions are your thing I assume you'll have some interest in Battle of the Year.\" Screen Crush commented that the 3D aspect \"could be a lot of fun with a film like this\" but questioned whether the film would stand out against \"an A-list title\".\nReception\nHome media\nBattle of the Year was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on December 10, 2013.\nCritical response\nBattle of the Year was universally panned by critics and audiences alike.\nBox office\nThe film grossed roughly $16 million and failed to recoup its budget of $20 million.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
