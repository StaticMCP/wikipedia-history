The team played home games at Revolution Ice Gardens (formerly The Rink at Warwick), in Warwick Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. The team continues to play for Philadelphia furthermore, currently the team is registered under the Tier 1 Hockey Federation, an AAA league.\nHistory\nThe Revolution joined the Eastern Junior Hockey League (EJHL) for the 2009–10 season after the owners of the Tier III Junior B Tri-State Selects of the Empire Junior Hockey League (EmJHL) purchased the Boston Jr. Shamrocks EJHL franchise. The organization would become the Philadelphia Revolution and field Tier III teams in the Junior A EJHL, Junior B EmJHL, and the Junior B Eastern States Hockey League (ESHL).\nIn 2013, Tier III junior hockey leagues underwent a reorganization that led to the dissolution of the EJHL. The Revolution joined the Atlantic Junior Hockey League which then re-branded itself as the Eastern Hockey League (EHL). The Revolution organization also field teams at the U19 Elite Level, the U16 Elite Level in the Elite Prospects League. Their former Junior B team in the EmJHL began playing in the Metropolitan Junior Hockey League (MJHL) after the EmJHL joined the United States Premier Hockey League in 2013. The MJHL Revolution team then joined the EHL-19U Elite Division in 2016. They dropped their Junior B ESHL team when that league disbanded in the 2013 reorganization. In 2017, the EHL re-branded again, dropping the Premier name from their top division and renamed the Elite Division to Premier.\nThe team was removed from the EHL website prior to the 2020-21 season and appeared to drop all junior level teams. The organization was still running youth hockey teams through the midget level. The team resides in the THF now and supports many age groups of youth hockey subsequent to 2023.\nSeason-by-season records\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Season !! GP !!
