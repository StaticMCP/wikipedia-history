On 15 May 2015 Roberto Rosario, president of the Central Electoral Board, said that there would be about 4,300 seats up for election in the \"most complex elections in history\".\nBackground\nThe previous parliamentary elections were held in 2010, and fresh elections would have usually been due in 2014 as Congress has a four-year term. However, in an effort to revert to the pre-1996 system and synchronize the dates of presidential and parliamentary and local elections in a single electoral year, the congressional term starting in 2010 was exceptionally extended to six years in order for the next congressional and municipal elections to be held alongside the next presidential elections due in 2016.\nOn 19 April 2015 the political committee of the ruling Dominican Liberation Party decided, without consensus, to amend the constitution to allow a president to be re-elected once, allowing incumbent President Danilo Medina to be presented for re-election, based on his high poll ratings. This led to tensions between party members and leaders, especially amongst supporters of Leonel Fernandez who was a pre-candidate for the elections. There was also an impasse in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, where senators and representatives close to Fernandez stated that they would not vote in favour of the Act to Call the Revising National Assembly to amend the constitution. After several weeks of internal disputes, the political committee, including Fernandez and Medina, agreed on 28 May to vote for the amendment. The amendment passed the Chamber on June 2.\nElectoral system\nThe president was elected using the two-round system; if no candidate had received more than 50% plus 1 of the vote, a second-round runoff would have been held in June 2016. Presidents are limited to serving two consecutive terms of four years.\nIn the Congress, the 190 members of the Chamber of Deputies were elected in three groups; 178 were elected using proportional representation from 32 multi-member constituencies based on the 31 provinces and the Distrito Nacional, with the number of seats based on the population of each province. A further seven were elected by proportional representation in a separate constituency for expatriates and five allocated nationally to parties that received at least 1% of the vote, with preference given to those that did not win any of the 178 constituency seats. The 32 members of the Senate were elected from the 31 provinces and the Distrito Nacional using first-past-the-post voting.\nCoalitions\nThe coalition led by the Dominican Liberation Party includes:\n*Dominican Revolutionary Party\n*Alternative Democratic Movement\n*Social Democratic Institutional Bloc\n*Civic Renovation Party\n*Liberal Reformist Party\n*Green Socialist Party\n*Christian Democratic Union\n*Dominican Workers' Party\n*Institutional Democratic Party\n*Christian People's Party\n*Liberal Party of Action\n*People's Democratic Party\n*Citizen's Will National Party\n*Independent Revolutionary Party\nThe coalition led by the Modern Revolutionary Party includes:\n*Social Christian Reformist Party\n*Dominican Humanist Party\n*Broad Front\n*Dominicans for Change\nResults\nPresident\nCongress\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ifes.org/faqs/elections-dominican-republic-2016-general-elections Elections in the Dominican Republic: 2016 General Elections] IFES"
