It took place on the 12 February 1863 between Polish Insurgents and the Russian Army.\nBackground\nAfter the battles in Wąchock, Marian Langiewicz set up two camps – one under the command of Dionizy Czachowski at the foot of the mountain, in Nowa Słupia, and the other in a former Benedictine monastery on Łysa Góra. He stayed there for several days, wanting to gather the insurgents scattered after the battles in Wąchock (his unit then numbered about 1,000 people).\nThe Battle\nRussian troops consisting of six infantry companies and 60 Cossacks set out against the Poles. Xaverius Chengeri also set off with five companies, half a squadron of dragoons and several dozen Cossacks. At around 9 a.m., he divided his forces and attacked the insurgents stationed in Słupia and on the hill. The insurgents took up favorable positions near the forest near Słupia Nowa. On the hill, the Russians were fired upon from behind the walls and windows of the monastery, forcing them to retreat. During the battle wooden cannons were used. The battle ended after four hours. The next day Langiewicz left Święty Krzyż and made his way to Staszowa.\nThe use of wooden cannons during the battle was described in the memoirs of Władysław Zapałowski:\nJan K. Janowski, a veteran of the Uprising, writes in his memoirs about the victory as follows:\nAftermath\nThe exposed Russians suffered heavy losses (according to Jan K. Janowski's Memoirs of the January Uprising, the Russians must have had at least 60 killed). The insurgents' losses were minor – historian Stanisław Zieliński gives the number of 18 insurgents killed.\nJan K. Janowski also writes his memoirs about the aftermath:\nMonuments and commemoration\n* Commemorative plaque on the wall of the monastery building, which now houses the Świętokrzyski National Park Museum.\n* On 15 September 2013, a ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of the January Uprising was held at the monastery in Święty Krzyż. On the same day, a commemorative plaque dedicated to the January Uprising was unveiled, located in the porch of the Basilica in Święty Krzyż.\nIn popular culture\n* In 1963 Jerzy Pietrzakowski painted Walki na Świętym Krzyżu (English: Battles on Swięty Kryż) and it is displayed at the Wąchock Abbey).\n*Stanisław Prauss painted Partia Powstańcza na Św. Krzyżu rok 1863 (English: The Insurgent Party at Swięty Kryż in 1863).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://powstanie1863.zsi.kielce.pl/index.php?id=w04 Święty Krzyż]\n* [http://powstanie1863.zsi.kielce.pl/index.php?id=z12 Jerzy Kowalczyk (1938–2015)]"
