It is the successor to World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks, released the year before.\nGameplay\nThe game takes place in a fixed third-person perspective as the player pilots a variety of futuristic aircraft in order to do battle with enemies on the ground and in the air while collecting power-ups and in-game currency known as \"bux\". Players can take two different jets into battle and switch between them using a collectable power-up. In all, there are nine different airplanes, thirty-three arenas, and five game modes. Most of the game modes fall into common categories such as search and destroy along with capture the flag.\n| GR_PS2 = 57%\n| MC_PS2 = 59/100\n| Allgame_PS =\n| Allgame_PS2 =\n| GI_PS2 = 5.5/10\n| GameRev_PS2 = D+\n| GMaster_PS2 = 34%\n| GSpot_PS = 4.6/10\n| GSpot_PS2 = 6.6/10\n| IGN_PS2 = 5.5/10\n| JXV_PS = 8/20\n| JXV_PS2 = 9/20\n| NGen_PS2 =\n| OPMUK_PS2 = 2/10\n| OPM_PS =\n| OPM_PS2 =\n}}\nThe PlayStation 2 version received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Frank Provo, writing for GameSpot, said of the same console version that the developers deserved credit for \"creating a dog-fighting system that is simultaneously intuitive and diverse\". He went on to criticize the graphics, specifically, \"muddy textures, 2D explosions, blocky structures, disappearing polygons, and frequent slowdown\". David Smith of IGN shared similar sentiment with regards to the graphics of the same console version, noting the dull palette of greens, browns, and grays and the muddy textures. He went on to praise the simple controls and entertaining voice acting, but denounced the gameplay as dull and easy. He concluded that \"Four-player support should have been included.\" Rob Smolka of NextGen said of the same console version, \"There's a lot to see and do, but the bell-shaped fun curve peaks too soon, and you'll likely lose interest before the end.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
