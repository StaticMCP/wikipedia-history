The category was established at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2022, and was split into two awards honoring live action and animated programs at the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards in 2024.\nThe inaugural winner of the award was We the People. The most recent recipients are Once Upon a Studio and Elmo and Jesse Remember Uncle Jack.\nBackground\nOn November 17, 2021, the NATAS announced the creation of the Children's and Family Emmy Awards to recognize the best in children's and family television. The organization cited an \"explosive growth in the quantity and quality of children’s and family programming\" as justification for a dedicated ceremony. Many categories of the awards were previously presented at the Daytime Emmy Awards.\nFor the 3rd Children's and Family Emmy Awards, the maximum runtime for episodes was lowered from nine to eight minutes, and the category was split into Outstanding Live Action Short Form Program and Outstanding Animated Short Form Program.\nWinners and nominations\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"10%\" | Series\n! width=\"30%\" | Producers\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n! width=\"3%\" | Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=6 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2022(1st)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n|We the People\n| Kenya Barris, Antonio Canobbio, Nick Carmen, Tonia Davis, Ben Kalina, Joe Nash, Chris Nee, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Chris Prynoski, Shannon Prynoski, Emily Ricard, Priya Swaminathan (executive producers); Justin Harris, Billy Mack (senior producers); Ada Chiaghana, Will Feng, Jess Pierik, Erynn Sampson, Peedee Shindell (producers); Tim Rauch (supervising director); Benjy Brook, Everett Downing, Trisha Gum, Daron Nefcy, Jorge R.
