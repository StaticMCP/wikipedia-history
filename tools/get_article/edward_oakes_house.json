It is a -story timber-frame house, five bays wide, with a gambrel roof, wood shingle siding, and a brick foundation.  A rear leanto section gives the house a saltbox appearance.  The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows.  It was built c. 1728, probably by Edward Oakes.  It is one of the oldest surviving wood-frame houses in Medford, and is unusual for the period due to its gambrel roof.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Medford, Massachusetts\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts\nReferences"
