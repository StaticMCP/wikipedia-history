Until 31 March 2021, official broadcasts of the full complement of radio services of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) using the digital audio broadcasting standard were also available in the state. From April 2021 until the summer of 2024, unlicensed, low-powered DAB multiplexes operated in a small number of locations.\nDigital Terrestrial Television\nAll of RTÉ's digital radio services, and the private radio service Radio Maria Ireland, are available on Saorview.\nGeneric DVB receivers generally need mains power, but are typically cheaper than DAB radios. Many portable DAB radio sets have th to th of the running time of an AM/FM set, typically giving only 6 hours use. There are also in-dash DVB Terrestrial receivers for cars, though it is illegal for the driver to watch the TV channels.\nDigital Satellite\nA number of public and private radio services from Ireland are available nationwide on both Saorsat and Sky where 99% of geographic coverage is possible.\nInternet Radio\nA number of public and private radio services are available across the state from broadband internet and mobile phone networks receivable on smartphones, Internet radio devices and smart speakers.\nDigital Audio Broadcasting\nThe national (though less than 50 % coverage) DAB operated by RTEN/2RN closed in March 2021. The extra RTE Digital stations created for DAB (largely automated)remained on Satellite and DVB-T. They were to close in November 2023 and will finally close in December 2025. These are RTÉ Radio 1 Extra, RTÉ 2XM, RTÉ Pulse and RTÉjr Radio.\nDigital Audio Broadcasting in Ireland is due to be trialled for 12 months beginning Spring 2025 by [https://failtedab.ie/ Fáilte DAB].\nBoth Wireless Ireland and Bauer Media Audio Ireland have announced plans to operate services on the platform.\nCurrently six transmission sites are being utilised using frequency blocks 5B, 7D and 10D\nServices on Fáilte DAB\n* 8Radio\n* Bob FM\n* Dublin's Q102\n* Eirewave\n* Energy Dance\n* Freedom\n* GHR\n* GoLoud\n* LazerHits\n* Newstalk\n* Nova Classic Rock\n* Onic 80s\n* Onic 90s\n* Onic Alternative\n* Onic Christmas\n* Onic Country\n* Onic Gold\n* Onic Hits\n* Onic Kids\n* Onic Movies\n* Onic R&B\n* Onic Rock\n* Radio Maria Ireland\n* Raidió Rí-Rá\n* Rewind\n* SPIN 1038\n* Spirit Radio\n* Sunshine Soul\n* Today FM\n* UCB Ireland\nPrior to this, a number of national multiplexes in the republic have ceased transmissions. A small number of unlicensed low-powered, small-scale DAB multiplexes did run in the state after the cessation of the RTÉ DAB multiplex, but they all ceased during the summer of 2024. Areas near the border of Northern Ireland can receive overspill reception of UK national, Northern Ireland local and small scale multiplexes.\nFormer National Multiplexes\nDAB Ireland Mux1 (RTÉ - 2006 to 2021)\nThe first national public service multiplex operated on Block 12C (227.360&nbsp;MHz) by RTÉ from just five transmitters: Three Rock, Co. Dublin; Kippure, Co. Wicklow; Clermont Carn, Co. Louth; Spur Hill, Cork; and Woodcock Hill, Limerick. Hence the service was only available in parts of Ireland. Its line-up has varied considerably since its launch on 1 January 2006. All stations were provided by RTÉ. It carried the following stations:\n* RTÉ Radio 1, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* RTÉ Radio 1 Extra, 64&nbsp;kbit/s Mono (part-time service, used bandwidth from Chill)\n* RTÉ 2fm, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* RTÉ lyric fm, 160&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, 112&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* RTÉ Gold, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* RTÉ 2XM, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* RTÉ Junior, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo (07:00-21:00, timeshared a slot with RTÉ Chill). Drops to 96&nbsp;kbit/s Mono when required\n* RTÉ Chill, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo (21:00-07:00, timeshared a slot with RTÉ Junior). Drops to 96&nbsp;kbit/s Mono when required\n* RTÉ Pulse, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo.\nIt was proposed to close the RTÉ DAB service as well as the Digital only RTÉ radio channels as part of the November 2019 cost saving plan. This proposed closure was set to take place in April 2020 but was delayed pending review through the outcome of a commissioned report.\nIn March 2021, RTÉ announced that it is to cease transmission of its radio services on the Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB) network on 31 March 2021. A report commissioned by the broadcaster found that just 0.5% of adults in Ireland listen to radio via DAB while 77% of adults in Ireland listen on FM.\nDAB Ireland Mux2\n;2007–08\nNo longer operating since November 2008, this multiplex launched in mid-March 2007 and operated from Three Rock Mountain and Clermont Carn on Block 12A (223.936&nbsp;MHz). It carried ten services: four stations supplied by Communicorp, two by Digital Audio Productions, two by UTV Radio, and two privately held. As of July 2008, it consisted of:\n* All 80s, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Dublin's 98FM, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* FM104, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Mocha, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Newstalk, 64&nbsp;kbit/s Mono\n* Phantom FM, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Q102, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Radio Kerry, 96&nbsp;kbit/s Mono\n* Today FM, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* SPIN 1038, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Raidió Rí-Rá\nRadio stations licensed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland ceased broadcasting on Ireland's second digital radio multiplex (Mux 2) on Sunday, 30 November 2008. The stations were broadcasting on Mux 2 as part of a digital radio trial. RTÉ continues to broadcast on the RTÉ multiplex. ComReg and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland are currently exploring regulatory frameworks for digital radio multiplex licensing and broadcast licences.\nDB Digital Broadcasting (2012 to 2017)\nDB Digital Broadcasting launched a national multiplex in some areas of Ireland in July 2012. Plans to expand to Limerick were dropped in 2014. The multiplex closed on 30 June 2017 due to a lack of enthusiasm for DAB from the commercial sector and after its licence from ComReg expired. The operator was attempting to relaunch a national service after the announcement of the closure of the first national multiplex.\nTrial Multiplexes\nDAB was launched to the public on 30 November 2006, with a number of trials taking place in 1998, 2001 and 2006. Before April 2021, 52% of Ireland's population — mainly in Counties Cork and Limerick and the North East – could receive permanent DAB services. Geographic coverage on a portable or car radio was much less. The service began to be marketed in May 2007 by a collective of commercial broadcasters, digitalradio.ie; and receivers to this day are still sold by most major electronics retailers.\nSince 2010, a number of privately run trial broadcasts have been made.\nTrial multiplex\nFáilteDAB (Spring 2025 - Spring 2026)\n[https://failtedab.ie/ Fáilte DAB] were granted a licence by ComReg to commence a one year DAB+ trial starting in Spring 2025 for a multiplex that will cover six transmitter sites across the eastern part of the republic with the view to expand nationally during the trial period.\nFormer trial multiplexes\nSouth-East (TOTAL-DAB) DAB trials (2010 to 2012)\nDAB and DAB+ trials were begun in April 2010 in the South-East area of Ireland on channel 9B (204.64&nbsp;MHz) by Total Broadcast Consultants Ltd, a broadcast engineering company. The company initially obtained a 1-year test and trial licence from ComReg to perform tests from sites, initially just in Waterford City. But from mid May, the trial multiplex was expanded to cover much of the South East of Ireland via a high site in the Blackstairs Mountains, providing coverage in Co. Wexford, Co. Carlow, Co. Kilkenny and East Co. Waterford. In March 2011, a 1-year extension was granted. This was the first DAB multiplex in Ireland to be operated by an independent/private organisation (RTÉ NL operating previous multiplexes), and the first known broadcasts of DAB+ content in Ireland. In addition to all local and regional radio stations, it was carrying several stations previously unavailable in the region. Past trial participants have included Christmas FM, Zenith Classic Rock & Raidió Rí-Rá.\n* 4fm, 160&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Beat 102 103, 192&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Sunshine, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* KCLR 96FM, 48&nbsp;kbit/s DAB+ Stereo\n* Phantom FM, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Radio Nova, 192&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* RTÉ 2XM, 72&nbsp;kbit/s DAB+ Stereo\n* South East Radio, 88&nbsp;kbit/s DAB+ Stereo\n* Talksport, 56&nbsp;kbit/s Mono\n* Tipp FM, 56&nbsp;kbit/s DAB+ Stereo\n* UCB Ireland, 32&nbsp;kbit/s AAC+\n* WLR FM, 64&nbsp;kbit/s AAC+ Stereo\nDublin 2018 trial\nA test service in Dublin served parts of the city on Channels 5A and 5B carrying both RTÉ and Independent local radio services from both Dublin and Cork.\nCork City 2018/19 DAB Trial (éirdab)\nA small scale DAB trial launched in August 2018 in Cork City, Ireland on channel 11A (216.928&nbsp;MHz). It was operated by Viamux Ltd (éirdab), a DAB/DAB+ digital radio solutions company. éirdab has a 1-year test and trial licence from Comreg to perform tests from a site in Cork City. éirdab has invited all local and regional radio stations to join the multiplex. It also carried stations previously unavailable to listeners in the area. Stations include:\n* Radio Maria, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* United Christian Broadcasters, 128&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\n* Juice Cork, 192&nbsp;kbit/s Stereo\nFormer unlicensed DAB multiplexes\nA small number of unlicensed independent DAB multiplexes were available in a few locations until the summer of 2024.\nIreland FreeDAB Network (FreeDAB)\nThe FreeDAB network carried a number of low-powered multiplexes in Cork, Dublin, the north and north east of Ireland and Sligo. The broadcaster was raided by the Garda in 2020 and resumed broadcasting in Cork, Dublin, Sligo, Waterford, Dundalk, Limerick. These transmissions have ceased.\nSee also\n* Radio in the Republic of Ireland\nReferences\nExternal links\nDigital Terrestrial Television Platform\n* [https://www.saorview.ie Saorview]\nDAB Multiplex Operators\n* [http://www.dbdb.ie dB Digital Broadcasting]\n* [https://failtedab.ie FáilteDAB]\n* [http://www.freedab.ie FreeDAB]\nOther sites\n* [http://www.wohnort.org/DAB/ireland.html DAB Ensembles Worldwide - technical information about DAB transmissions in Ireland]"
