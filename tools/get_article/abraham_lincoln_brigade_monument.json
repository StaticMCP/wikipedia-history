The Monument was designed by Ann Chamberlain and Walter J. Hood with US$400,000 in funding from the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives to honor the Lincoln Battalion and XV International Brigade, formed to fight for the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. It was dedicated on March 30, 2008 and is part of the San Francisco Arts Commission collection.\nOne side of the monuments' panels show portraits of the volunteers. The other side of the panels contain annotated maps of the front lines between 1936 and 1938, as well as quotes of volunteers Abe Osheroff, Dave Smith, Alvah Bessie, Edwin Rolfe, Frederick Martin, Ruth Davidow, Robert Colodny, and Steve Nelson. The remainder panels contain words about that period from historians, labor organizers, writers, and musicians, such as Dolores Ibarruri, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Paul Robeson.\nIntermittent repairs occurred in the decade since the Monument was installed. In August 2018, the onyx stone panels were removed and taken offsite for repair, due to a combination of design issues and neglect. The Monument was restored by May 2020.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.hooddesignstudio.com/abrahamlincoln The Abraham Lincoln Brigade | Hood Design Studio]"
