He was tried in a number of key positions as well as in the ruck and kicked 48 goals from full-forward in 1965 to top the club's goal kicking. This tally included a bag of nine goals against Geelong at Lake Oval mid-season.\nThe second half of Kingston's career was spent in South Australia. It started at Norwood in 1968 but he could only manage 21 games over three years due to injury. His injury problems kept him out of action for the entire 1970 SANFL season and when he returned the following year it was at Port Adelaide, with whom he played until retiring in 1974.\nHe also played five interstate matches for South Australia, two of which came at the 1972 Perth Carnival.\nReferences\n*\n*"
