The season officially started on May 15, in the Eastern Pacific—designated as the area east of 140°W—and on June 1, in the Central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140°W. The season officially ended in both basins on November 30. These dates typically limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. Lasting 24&nbsp;days, Hurricane Tina became the longest lived North Pacific tropical cyclone on record. Its longevity broke the old record for the Eastern and Central Pacific of 20 days, set by Hurricane Fico in 1978; and the old record for the Western Pacific of 22 days, set by Typhoon Rita in 1972.\nThis timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, have been included.\nThe graphical bar below gives a brief overview of storm activity during the season, and for convenience, the storm's maximum intensity is included as a color bar.\nTimeline of events\nJanuary\n;January 28\n*0600 UTC (8:00&nbsp;pm HST January 27)&nbsp;- Tropical Depression One-C developed 1,007&nbsp;mi (1,620.6&nbsp;km) south of Hilo, Hawaii.\n*1800 UTC (8:00&nbsp;am HST)&nbsp;- Tropical Depression One-C intensified into Tropical Storm Ekeka.\n;January 30\n*0000 UTC (2:00&nbsp;pm HST January 29)&nbsp;- Tropical Storm Ekeka intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.\n;January 31\n*1800 UTC (8:00&nbsp;am HST)&nbsp;- Hurricane Ekeka intensified into a Category 2 hurricane.\nFebruary\n;February 2\n*0000 UTC (2:00&nbsp;pm HST February 1)&nbsp;- Hurricane Ekeka intensified into a Category 3 hurricane.
