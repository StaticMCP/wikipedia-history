The population was 152,486 at the 2020 census. The county seat is Hanford.\nKings County comprises the Hanford-Corcoran, CA metropolitan statistical area, which is also included in the Visalia-Porterville-Hanford, CA combined statistical area. It is in the San Joaquin Valley, a rich agricultural region.\nHistory\nThe area was inhabited for thousands of years by Native Americans including the Tachi Yokuts tribe. They continue to live in the area on the Santa Rosa Rancheria. It was colonized by Spain, Mexico and the United States.\nAn 1805 expedition probably led by Spanish Army Lieutenant Gabriel Moraga recorded discovering the river, which they named El Rio de los Santos Reyes (River of the Holy Kings) after the Three Wise Men of the Bible.  At the time of the United States conquest of California in 1848, the new government changed the name to Kings River after which the county was named.\nIn 1880, a dispute over land titles between settlers and the Southern Pacific Railroad resulted in a bloody gun battle on a farm  northwest of Hanford; seven men died. This event became known as the Mussel Slough Tragedy.\nKings County was formed in 1893 from the western part of Tulare County.  In 1909, by an act of the state legislature,  of Fresno County territory was added to the northwest portion of Kings County.\nSettlers reclaimed Tulare Lake and its wetlands for agricultural development. In surface area, it was formerly the largest body of freshwater west of the Great Lakes, and supported a large population of migratory birds as well as local birds and wildlife. Monoculture has sharply reduced habitat for many species.\nIn 1928, oil was discovered in the Kettleman Hills located in the southwestern part of Kings County. The Kettleman North Dome Oil Field became one of the most productive oil fields in the United States.\nDuring the Great Depression, over 18,000 cotton pickers in the southern San Joaquin Valley, mostly migrant Mexican workers, went on strike in the California agricultural strikes of 1933. During the strike, 3,500 striking farm workers lived in a four-acre camp on the land of a small farmer on the outskirts of Corcoran. Ultimately, the federal government intervened to force both sides to negotiate a settlement.\nLemoore Army Airfield was established for training and defense during World War II. In 1961, the U.S. Navy opened NAS Lemoore  west of Lemoore, not far from the earlier site.\nThe completion of the California Aqueduct in the early 1970s brought needed water for agriculture and domestic use to the west side of the county.\nHistoric sites\n* Kingston\n* Mussel Slough Tragedy\n* El Adobe de los Robles Rancho built by Daniel Rhoads\n* Vaca Adobe\n* Cox & Clark Trading Post and Steamboat Landing\n* Witt Site\nGeography\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (0.2%) is water.\nKings County is bordered on the north and northwest by Fresno County, on the east by Tulare County, on the south by Kern County and a small part of San Luis Obispo County and on the west by Monterey County.\nTable Mountain is the highest point in Kings County at an elevation of . It is located in the Diablo Range in southwestern Kings County on the boundary between Kings and Monterey counties.\nMost of the historic Tulare Lake was within Kings County. Although reclaimed for farming late in the 19th century, it was the largest freshwater lake west of the Great Lakes.\nDemographics\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census1790–1960 1900–19901990–2000 2010 2020\n}}\n2020 census\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Kings County, California – Racial and ethnic composition\n!Race / Ethnicity (NH = Non-Hispanic)\n!Pop 1980\n!Pop 1990\n!Pop 2000\n!Pop 2010\n!style=\"background-color: #ffffb3;\" | Pop 2020\n!% 1980\n!% 1990\n!% 2000\n!% 2010\n!style=\"background-color: #ffffb3;\" |% 2020\n|-\n|White alone (NH)\n|47,211\n|54,426\n|53,817\n|53,879\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |44,361\n|64.03%\n|53.64%\n|41.57%\n|35.22%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |29.09%\n|-\n|Black or African American alone (NH)\n|3,504\n|7,747\n|10,418\n|10,314\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |8,300\n|4.75%\n|7.63%\n|8.05%\n|6.74%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |5.44%\n|-\n|Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH)\n|725\n|905\n|1,304\n|1,297\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1,690\n|0.98%\n|0.89%\n|1.01%\n|0.85%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |1.11%\n|-\n|Asian alone (NH)\n|2,189\n|3,408\n|3,884\n|5,339\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |5,511\n|2.97%\n|3.36%\n|3.00%\n|3.49%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3.61%\n|-\n|Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander alone (NH)\n|x\n|x\n|192\n|228\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |331\n|0.15%\n|0.15%\n|0.15%\n|0.15%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.22%\n|-\n|Other race alone (NH)\n|282\n|432\n|229\n|803\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |713\n|0.38%\n|0.43%\n|0.18%\n|0.52%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |0.47%\n|-\n|Mixed race or Multiracial (NH)\n|x\n|x\n|3,156\n|3,256\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |4,973\n|x\n|x\n|2.44%\n|2.13%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |3.26%\n|-\n|Hispanic or Latino (any race)\n|19,827\n|34,551\n|56,461\n|77,866\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |86,607\n|26.89%\n|34.05%\n|43.61%\n|50.90%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |56.80%\n|-\n|Total\n|73,738\n|101,469\n|129,461\n|152,982\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |152,486\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|100.00%\n|style='background: #ffffe6; |100.00%\n|}\n2011\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Population, race, and income\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Total population\n| colspan=\"2\" | 152,335\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;White\n| 109,704\n| 72.0%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Black or African American\n| 10,988\n| 7.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;American Indian or Alaska Native\n| 1,927\n| 1.3%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Asian\n| 5,751\n| 3.8%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander\n| 353\n| 0.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Some other race\n| 17,832\n| 11.7%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;&nbsp;Two or more races\n| 5,780\n| 3.8%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | &nbsp;Hispanic or Latino (of any race)\n| 76,401\n| 50.2%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Per capita income\n| colspan=\"2\" | $18,296\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Median household income\n| colspan=\"2\" | $48,838\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Median family income\n| colspan=\"2\" | $51,932\n|}\nPlaces by population, race, and income\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed sortable\" style=\"width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"9\" | Places by population and race\n|-\n!

Kings County is 10th among California counties in agricultural production. The top commodity in 2018 was milk with a value of $676.7 million. Other major agricultural commodities included pistachios, cotton, cattle and calves, almonds and processing tomatoes. Another major employer is NAS Lemoore, the U.S. Navy's newest and largest master jet base. According to a Navy study in 2008, payroll, base spending, retiree and veterans' checks total more than $1 billion in annual economic impact to the region.  Other important employers include a Del Monte Foods tomato processing plant, Adventist Health, the J. G. Boswell Company, an Olam International tomato processing facility, Leprino Foods, the largest mozzarella cheese maker in the world, the Kings County Government and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation which operates three state prisons in Kings County.\nIn 2011–2013, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the median household income in the county was $47,035 and that 17.6% of the population was below the poverty line. In 2018, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, average per capita income was $35,306 in Kings County, which ranked it last of California's 58 counties. Per capita personal income is calculated by dividing the population by the total personal income of the area's residents. In Kings County's case, the U.S. Census Bureau's estimated population of 151,366 was used for that calculation. However, the population estimate includes incarcerated persons with little or no income.\nThe homeownership rate was 54.2% at the time of the 2010 census. According to Zillow Real Estate Research, an estimated 24% of homeowners in the county owned their homes free and clear in the third quarter of 2012.\nTaxable sales in 2015 totaled about $1.7 billion.\nKings County did not escape the effects of the Great Recession. The unemployment rate in May 2012 was 14.9%, up from 10.1% in July 2008. However, the rate had dropped to 9.8% in February 2020 at the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate had risen to 16.8% in April of that year.

By mid-2009, the price paid to milk producers had dropped to a point that was far below the cost of production according to a July 2009 quote from Bill Van Dam, CEO of the Alliance of Western Milk Producers. By December 2010, milk prices had increased to about $13 per hundredweight from a low of below $10 in 2009. However, the price of corn used for feed had increased because of its use by the ethanol industry. Van Dam was quoted that month as saying that at current prices, dairy operators are at or close to the break-even point.  By the summer of 2012, it was reported that despite a milk price of about $15 per hundredweight, the rising cost of cattle feed had caused many dairy farmers to sell all or part of their herds and even file for bankruptcy.  In 2014, milk prices were topping $22 per hundredweight and the value of milk sold rose to $970 million in that year.  However, by March 2016 milk was reportedly selling closer to $13 per hundredweight.\nCulture\nKings County has a large annual celebration held each May called Kings County Homecoming Week.
