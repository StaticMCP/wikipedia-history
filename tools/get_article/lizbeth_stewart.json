She was awarded a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Moore College of Art and Design in 1971.  In 1990, she  married Matthew C. Gruskin.  For 30 years, she taught ceramics at the University of the Arts (Philadelphia), before retiring as a professor emeritus in December, 2012.  She died June 24, 2013, of lung cancer at her home in Yardley, Pennsylvania.\nStewart is best known for her hand-built ceramic portrayals of animals.  Typically, the modeling is realistic, but the painting is stylized.  Monkey with Roses, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is typical of her larger works and demonstrates this dichotomy, as well as her use of separate ceramic flowers to create an environment.  The Hermitage Museum (St. Petersburg, Russia), the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington, D.C.), and the Winterthur Museum (Winterthur, Delaware) are among the public collections holding work by Lizbeth Stewart.\nFootnotes\nReferences\n* Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, Three Centuries of American Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1976, pp.&nbsp;641–642\n* Torchia, Richard, From the Ground Up: Ten Philadelphia Clay Artists, Moore College of Art and Design, 1992, pp.&nbsp;15–16\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131114165129/http://articles.philly.com/2013-07-05/news/40373464_1_animals-american-art-museum-husband Cook, Bonnie L., \"Lizbeth Stewart, ceramicist known for her animals\" in The Inquirer, July 05, 2013]\n* [http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=6282 Smithsonian American Art Museum website]"
