Roosevelt was the first president to fly in an aircraft while in office. In January 1943 he flew in a Pan American Airways Boeing 314 flying boat, named Dixie Clipper, to Casablanca to meet with British prime minister Winston Churchill. It was soon realized that the president would need a dedicated aircraft; a C-54 transport was converted to serve as the presidential aircraft and named Sacred Cow. Roosevelt made only one trip in the Sacred Cow. That was to the Yalta Conference in February 1945 to meet with Churchill and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to make plans for the reconstruction of Europe after the impending Allied victory.\nAircraft used as the primary presidential aircraft:\n(Numbers in parentheses are the official U.S. Air Force tail numbers for each aircraft.)\n* Sacred Cow, VC-54C (42-107451) used by Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman from February 1945 to July 1947.\n* Independence, VC-118 (46-0505) used by Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower from July 1947 to May 1953.

Retired in April 1966.\n* SAM 970, VC-137A/B (58-6970) used by Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy from August 1959 to 1962.

Its sister aircraft, SAM 29000 (82-9000), serves as the primary backup presidential aircraft.\n(The dates shown above are the dates when the aircraft was used as the primary presidential aircraft. Most were retained in service for several years after the dates shown.)\nOther presidential aircraft\nIn addition to the above, a number of other aircraft have been used by presidents for trips of short duration. Below is a listing of aircraft types assigned to the 89th Airlift Wing for use by, or in support of, the president or other senior government officials.\nCurrently in service\n* C-20C – A military variant of the Gulfstream III, upgraded and with secure communications, often utilized as backup aircraft accompanying the VC-25A aircraft when it is operating as Air Force One\n* C-32 – Four C-32As, a military variant of the (Boeing 757-200), were acquired in 2002 (98-0001, 98-0002, 99-0003, and 99-0004), three more in 2010 (09-0015, 09-0016, 09-0017) and an additional one in 2019 (19-0018).\n* C-40B – Two C-40Bs (01-0040 and 01-0041), a military variant of the Boeing 737-700C have been in service since 2002.\n* C-37A – Three C-37As (one delivered in 2005 and two in 2006 with tail numbers 99-0404, 01-0027, and 01-0028), a military variant of the Gulfstream V, are currently in service.\n* C-37B – Three C-37Bs (18-1942, 18-1947, and 20-1941) are currently in service.\nFormerly in service\n* VC-118A (53-3240) – A military variant of the Douglas DC-6, in service from 1947 to 1965. Used to access airfields with shorter runways\n* U-4B – Two Aero Commander U-4Bs (55-4647 and 55-4648) were in presidential service from 1956 to 1960. Retired in 1977\n* VC-137A/B – Three VC-137A/Bs (58-6970, 58-6971 and 58-6972), a military variant of the Boeing 707, were in service from 1959 to 1996. These were the first jet aircraft used to transport the president and also provided transportation to very senior government officials (i.e. first ladies, vice presidents, and secretaries of state) during their service.\n* VC-137C – Four VC-137Cs, a military variant of the Boeing 707, were acquired in 1962 (62-6000), 1972 (72-7000), 1985 (85-6973), and 1987 (85-6974) respectively and served to the early 2000s. The two acquired in 1962 (62-6000) and 1972 (72-7000) served respectively as the primary presidential aircraft until the acquisition of two VC-25As in 1990.\n* VC-140B – Six VC-140Bs (61-2488, 61-2489, 61-2490, 61-2491, 61-2492 and 61-2493), a military variant of the Lockheed JetStar, were in service from the early 1960s to the 1980s.\n* VC-6A – One VC-6A (66-7943), a Beechcraft King Air B90, was used to transport President Lyndon B.

C-17's also typically proceed presidential travel by bringing the presidential limousine, Marine One, and other Secret Service vehicles and equipment to an area for a visit.\nCall signs\nThe following air traffic control call signs designate aircraft transporting the president:\n* Air Force One, any U.S. Air Force aircraft with the president on board\n* Marine One, the presidential helicopter\n* Army One, usually a helicopter. The U.S. Army shared the duty of transporting the president by helicopter with the U.S. Marine Corps until 1976, when the latter took on sole responsibility.\n* Navy One, this designation has been used only once, when in 2003 an S-3 Viking airplane flew then President George W. Bush to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.\n* Coast Guard One; this call sign has not yet been used, although then-Vice President Joe Biden did fly on Coast Guard Two in 2009.\n* Space Force One; this call sign has not yet been used.\n* Executive One, any civilian aircraft carrying the president. This designation has been used only once, when in 1973 Richard Nixon flew with a United Airlines DC-10 from Dulles International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport.\nRail cars\n* United States (1865), constructed in 1863 and 1864. Abraham Lincoln never used the \"elaborately appointed\" car.

Ronald Reagan used it for his whistlestop tour across Ohio in 1984.\nSee also\n* Transportation of the president of the United States\nReferences"
