It was co-written by Misia and Jun Sasaki and produced by Misia. \"Koi wa Owaranai Zutto\" was released as a single simultaneously with the Tour of Misia Japan Soul Quest concert DVD on June 20, 2012, through Ariola Japan. The title track served as theme song for the NHK drama series Hatsukoi, starring Yoshino Kimura.\nBackground and release\n\"Koi wa Owaranai Zutto\" is Misia's first single in over a year and first since the release of her tenth studio album, Soul Quest. The first pressing of the physical release includes a poetry anthology written by Misia on the theme of \"first love\", titled . Along with the title track, the single features the B-side \"Hyakunen Ai\", co-written by essayist Mayumi Satō, a stripped-down, acoustic piano version of \"Koi wa Owaranai Zutto\" and a remixed version of Misia's Japanese-language rendition of \"Ribbon in the Sky\" by Stevie Wonder, from the cover album Misia no Mori: Forest Covers. A digital exclusive version, dubbed the Deluxe Edition, including an additional remix of \"Koi wa Owaranai Zutto\", was released a week later, on June 27, 2012.\nArtwork\nThe artwork for the single was designed by Japanese balloon art group Daisy Balloon, who also designed the costumes for the Tour of Misia Japan Soul Quest Grand Finale 2012. The single's cover art depicts Misia wearing a floral headpiece and shoulder ornaments, made entirely of balloon material, and holding a bear-shaped balloon. The red apple sitting on the bear's head is meant to represent the intensity of a first love.\nComposition\n\"Koi wa Owaranai Zutto\" was written by Misia and composed and arranged by Jun Sasaki. It is Misia's first single to be co-written by Sasaki since \"Aitakute Ima\". The song is composed in the key of A-flat major and set to a common time tempo of 77 beats per minute. Misia's vocals span from G3 to E5. The lyrics, written specifically to echo the plot of Hatsukoi, tell the story of a protagonist who is unable to forget her first love. The series marks the second collaboration between Misia and screenwriter Miho Nakazono, since Yamato Nadeshiko (2000), for which Misia's \"Everything\" served as theme song. In a press release, Misia explained, \"love, even if lost, is something that lives on in our memories and can change the course of our lives.\" After reading the script, Misia describes being inspired to put into song the feeling of \"endless love\".\nCritical reception\n\"Koi wa Owaranai Zutto\" was praised as \"authentic\" by CDJournal critics, and compared to \"Everything\" for the analogous vocal restraint shown by Misia. Her vocal performance was described as \"passionate\". Misia and Sasaki received acclaim for their musical compatibility.\nMusic video\nBackground\nThe music video for \"Koi wa Owaranai Zutto\" was filmed in May 2012 in Hokkaido and was directed by Mitsuo Shindō.
