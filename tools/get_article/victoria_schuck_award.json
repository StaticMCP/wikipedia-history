The award is named in honor of the political scientist Victoria Schuck. Although a number of area-specific sections of the American Political Science Association have dedicated book awards, the Schuck Award is one of only a few awards given directly by the Association rather than by a subsection of it.\nHistory\nThe prize was established in 1986 by the American Political Science Association's Executive Director Thomas E. Mann, its President Aaron Wildavsky, and its Executive Council, at the urging of Victoria Schuck. It was originally endowed by Schuck at a value of $500 per award, out of a fund that she donated totaling $3000. By 2020 the award carried a prize of $750.\nThe committee that awards the prize consists of political scientists who are members of the American Political Science Association; the first prize was awarded by Susan J. Carroll, Jean Bethke Elshtain, and Norma Noonan.\nPast winners\nThe past recipients of the prize in each year are as follows:\n* 1988 Rebecca E.
