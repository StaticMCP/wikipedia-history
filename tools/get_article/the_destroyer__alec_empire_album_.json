Destroyer is also the name given to a series of EPs by Empire released two years before. Unlike his previous albums for Mille Plateaux, The Destroyer had a much heavier sound more akin to that of his band Atari Teenage Riot, and is considered one of the earliest examples of a breakcore record. Producer Enduser named the album as an inspiration for his music. The album peaked at #54 on the CMJ Radio Top 200 in the U.S.\nTrack listing\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.discogs.com/release/7582 The Destroyer CD] at Discogs\n*[http://www.discogs.com/release/24858 The Destroyer LP] at Discogs\n*[https://alecempire.bandcamp.com/album/the-destroyer-original-digital-hardcore-masters The Destroyer] on Bandcamp\n*[http://www.digitalhardcore.com Official Digital Hardcore Recordings site]"
