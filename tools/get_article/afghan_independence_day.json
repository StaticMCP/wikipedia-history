The treaty established a completely neutral relation between the Emirate of Afghanistan and the United Kingdom and was the start of Afghanistan's relations with other countries, as well as Amanullah Khan's modernization campaigns.\nBackground\nThe First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42) led to the British force taking and occupying Kabul. After this, due to strategic errors by Elphinstone, the British force was annihilated by Afghan forces under the command of Akbar Khan somewhere at the Kabul–Jalalabad Road, near the city of Jalalabad. After this defeat, the British-Indian forces returned to Afghanistan on a special mission to rescue their prisoners of war (POWs) and then withdrew. The British returned later in the Second Anglo-Afghan War.\nAt the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80), Abdur Rahman Khan who was an opponent to the British, became the new emir and established friendly British-Afghan relations. The British were given control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs in exchange for the prevention of a British resident in Kabul, as was one of the British objectives, and protection against the Russians and Persians.\nIn 1919, the Third Anglo-Afghan War led the British to give up control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs.\nObservances\n* The Taq-e Zafar was built in Paghman to commemorate independence in 1928.\n* At the centenary anniversary in 2019, some international landmarks hoisted the Afghan flag tricolor, including the world's tallest building Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The day also coincidenced with the completion of the renovation of the Darul Aman Palace in Kabul, where official celebrations took place.\n* On 15 August 2021, the Taliban captured Kabul and reinstated the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. During the Afghan Independence Day rallies in Jalalabad and other cities on 18 and 19 August, the Taliban killed three people and injured over a dozen others for removing Taliban flags and displaying the tricolor Afghan flags.\nGallery\n2011 Afghan Independence Day-4.jpg|2011\n2011 Afghan Independence Day-6.jpg|2011\n2011 Afghan Independence Day-7.jpg|2011\nSee also\n* Culture of Afghanistan\n* Hotak dynasty\n* Durrani Empire\nReferences"
