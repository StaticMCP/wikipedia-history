These battles were delaying actions fought by Allied units under the overall command of the British 1st Armoured Brigade against the German 9th Panzer Division, to cover the Allied escape from their positions at Mt. Vermion toward the new defensive line of Mt.Olympus – river Aliakmon – Mt. Siniatsikon.\nFootnotes"
