His research suggested exercise training (rather than bed rest) as a more effective treatment for chronic heart failure. He is known for putting forward the \"muscle hypothesis\" of heart failure. In addition to this, Coats is a fundraiser, university administrator, and inventor. His Imperial College patents have formed the basis of companies specialising in the treatment of cachexia (Myotec and PsiOxus).\nEarly life and education\nAndrew Stewart Coats was born and raised in Melbourne. His father, Douglas A. Coats, was a Professor of Resuscitation who first described essential fatty acids.\nStewart Coats was educated at Melbourne Grammar School, where he was proxime accessit Head of School and a School Officer; St Catherine's College, Oxford, where he graduated with a B.A. in Physiological Sciences with First-Class Honours and won the Rose Prize; and Clare College, Cambridge, where he read medicine, earning a M.B. B.Chir., and was top of his year with two distinctions.\nCareer\nMedical career\nAfter qualifying in medicine in 1980, Stewart Coats started his career at St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne under Professor David Penington and then at the University of Oxford under Professor Peter Sleight. In 1991, he was appointed Senior Lecturer, supported by the British Heart Foundation, at the National Heart and Lung Institute [NHLI] under Professor Philip Poole-Wilson.\nIn 1996, he was appointed the Viscount Royston Professor of Cardiology at Imperial College. He was also honorary consultant physician at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, and its Clinical Director for Cardiology and its Associate Medical Director. In 2002, Stewart Coats became the 17th Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sydney. In 2006, he was appointed Deputy Vice-Chancellor (External Communications) of the University of Sydney. In 2009, Stewart Coats was appointed the second Norwich Research Park Professor-at-Large, second to Baron Solly Zuckerman. In 2011, Stewart Coats was appointed chief executive officer of the Norwich Research Park. In 2013, he took up the position of Joint Academic Vice-President of Monash University, Australia and the University of Warwick, UK.\nResearch career\nStewart Coats commenced his research career in hypertension, where he did some of the early work on the clinical value of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. His subsequent career, forming the bulk of his more than 550 research papers, has been in the field of heart failure where he conducted the first ever randomised trial of exercise training in chronic heart failure.\nHe coined the term \"The Muscle Hypothesis\", the now accepted explanation for the generation of exercise-limiting symptoms in chronic heart failure, but at the time a radical theory.\nHe has been chairman or a member of the steering committee of many large-scale international drug trials that have influenced treatment of cardiovascular disease. These include the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) Trial, OPTIMAAL (angiotensin receptor antagonist in heart failure), and SENIORS (management of heart failure in the elderly).\nHe has published over 450 items on PubMed  and has been Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Cardiology since 1999.\nIn 2016, he was the keynote speaker at the International Conference of Undergraduate Research, held concurrently in Australia, the UK, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, South Africa and the US.\nNational and international work\nStewart Coats was appointed chair of Australia's peak policy body for Health Informatics, the Australian Health Information Council (AHIC). He sat on many committees and chaired the New South Wales Ministerial Advisory Committee on Health and Medical Research (MACMHR). In his three years as Deputy Vice-Chancellor in charge of External Relations and Development at Sydney, the university achieved the highest ever fund-raising total for any Australian university, in excess of A$50 million per year.\nCommercial career\nStewart Coats completed an MBA at London Business School and subsequently became a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors and a member of London's Institute of Directors.
