The sigmoid package is a dependency of the rnn package and therefore automatically installed with it.\nReception\nWith the release of version 0.3.0 in April 2016 the use in production and research environments became more widespread. The package was reviewed several months later on the R blog The Beginner Programmer as \"R provides a simple and very user friendly package named rnn for working with recurrent neural networks.\", which further increased usage.\nThe book [https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/neural-networks-with/9781788397872/ Neural Networks in R] by Balaji Venkateswaran and Giuseppe Ciaburro uses rnn to demonstrate recurrent neural networks to R users. It is also used in the r-exercises.com course \"Neural network exercises\".\nThe RStudio CRAN mirror download logs\nshow that the package is downloaded on average about 2,000 per month from those servers\n, with a total of over 100,000 downloads since the first release, according to RDocumentation.org, this puts the package in the 15th percentile of most popular R packages\n.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://github.com/bquast/rnn Repository] on GitHub\n*[https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnn rnn package] on CRAN"
