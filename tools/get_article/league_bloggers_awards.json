Formerly called Naija Premier League Online Award, it started in 2009 and was rebranded to become League Bloggers Awards in 2012. Awards (Player Of The Month & Coach Of The Month) were initially on a monthly basis from 2009 before the first End Of Season Award kicked off in 2012. The end-of-season awards ceremony wasn't held in 2015, 2018, 2020 & 2021 for various reasons.\nHistory\nFounded in 2009 by Ojeikere Aikhoje and George Akpayen as the Naija Premier League Online Awards when both men met during the Super 4 Pre-Season Tournament, in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State. The awards were initially on a monthly basis before becoming a seasonal event in 2012 when it was rebranded as the League Bloggers Awards (LBA). Reuben Gabriel was the first winner of the Player Of The Season Award. The awards ceremony have held in Lagos every year since 2012, except in 2018 when the League was suspended and in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic.\nMain categories\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Season\n!Player of the Season\n!Rookie of the Season\n!Coach of the Season\n!Club of the Season\n!Top Scorer\n!Women Player of the Season\n!NNL Player of the Season\n|-\n|2012\n| Reuben Gabriel (Kano Pillars)\n| Andrew Abalogu (ABS F.C.)\n| Dominic Iorfa (Lobi Stars)\n| Kano Pillars\n| Sibi Gwar (Niger Tornadoes)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2013\n| Rabiu Ali (Kano Pillars)\n| Oghenekaro Etebo (Warri Wolves)\n| Mohammed Babagananu (Kano Pillars)\n| Kano Pillars\n| Victor Namo (Nasarawa United)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2014\n| Mfon Udoh (|Enyimba FC)\n| Chisom Chikatara (Abia Warriors)\n| Okey Emordi (Kano Pillars)\n| Kano Pillars\n| Mfon Udoh (|Enyimba FC)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Gbolahan Salami (Warri Wolves)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2016\n| Chisom Egbuchulam (Rangers International)\n|\n| Imama Amapakabo (Rangers International)\n| Rangers International\n| Godwin Obaje (Wikki Tourists)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2017\n| Anthony Okpotu (Lobi Stars)\n| Peter Eneji (Plateau United)\n| Kennedy Boboye (Akwa United)\n| Plateau United\n| Anthony Okpotu(Lobi Stars)\n| Rasheedat Ajibade (FC Robo)\n| Michael Ohanu (Kwara United)\n|-\n|2018\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Junior Lokosa (Kano Pillars)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019\n| Mfon Udoh (|Enyimba FC)\n|\n| Usman Abd'Allah (Enyimba)\n| Enyimba Football Club\n| Mfon Udoh (Enyimba Football Club)\nSunusi Ibrahim (Nasarawa United)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019-20\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Israel Abia (Rangers International)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2020-21\n| Silas Nwankwo (|Nasarawa United)\n|\n| Kennedy Boboye (Akwa United)\n| Akwa United\n| Charles Atshimene (Akwa United)\nSilas Nwankwo (Nasarawa United)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2021-22\n| Chijioke Akuneto (Rivers United)\n|\n| Stanley Eguma (Rivers United)\n| Rivers United\n| Chijioke Akuneto (Rivers United)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2022-23\n| Chukwuemeka Obioma (Enyimba Football Club)\n| Robert Mizo (Bayelsa United)\n| Daniel Ogunmodede (Remo Stars)\n| Remo Stars\n| Chukwuemeka Obioma (Enyimba Football Club)\n|\n|\n|-\n|2023-24\n| Chijioke Mbaoma (Enyimba FC)\n| Suleiman Sani (Akwa United)\n| Fidelis Ilechukwu (Rangers International)\n| Rangers International\n| Chijioke Mbaoma (|Enyimba FC)\n| Emem Essien (Edo Queens)\n| Kparobo Arierhi (Beyond Limits F.A.)\n|-\n|2024-25\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nSponsorship\nIn 2014, Betting brand, 1960BET sponsored the awards and presented a brand new car to the Player of the Season, Mfon Udoh  Football engagement platform, 54footballx, initially signed a two-year deal with the LBA in 2024 as Sponsor.\nReferences"
