The lowest versions required to run the software are PHP 5.3, Apache2, and MySQL 5.0. The software architecture is written in the way to allow on-the-fly extension with native and third-party plugins available in the  Oxwall Store.\nThe open source platform behind the software allows third-party developers and freelance programmers to substantially modify the code, as well as create new independent plugins and themes for SkaDate. The level of support for third-party modifications is significant, compared to other similar products.\nHistory\nThe SkaDate software was first developed in 2004 by Skalfa LLC (formerly Skalfa eCommerce). Mobile dating applications developed by a third-party were added in 2012. After going through 9 stable versions as a stand-alone software product, SkaDate switched to Oxwall platform in 2014. In-house developed native iOS application replaced the third-party one late in 2014, with Android application released in the beginning of 2015. The adoption of Oxwall platform allowed for the non-commercial release of the developer version of the software, as well as opened doors for software extension through plugins created by Oxwall developers community. Speaking at 2016 iDate Online Dating Conference SkaDate creator Emil Sarnogoev said that industry focus dictates shifting, even more, development focus towards further refining mobile apps for social community and dating markets.\nReferences\n* [http://www.internetdatingconference.com/2016/LA/topic-mobile-dating-software.htm 2016 iDate Online Dating Conference]\n* [http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2012/02/interview-with-emil-sarnogoev-ceo-founder-of-skalfa-software.html Interview With Emil Sarnogoev, CEO & Founder Of Skalfa Software]\n* [http://onlinedatingpost.com/archives/2014/10/skalfa-releases-skadate-x-dating-software/ Skalfa Releases SkaDate X Dating Software]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6MyenEXpGE Emil Sarnogoev, CEO of Skalfa (Skadate) On Mobile Dating Software at iDate L.A.
