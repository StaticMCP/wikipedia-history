The lead vocals were performed by Randy Crawford. The song was a hit in the US, reaching number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, and in Europe, where it peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart. A modified version of the song was featured in the films ''Sharky's Machine and Jackie Brown, while the original appeared in the television program Better Call Saul and in the enhanced versions of the 2013 game Grand Theft Auto V'' on the in-game radio station, WorldWide FM.\nBackground\nThe inspiration from the song came from the beginner's ski slope at Mammoth Mountain in California. Joe Sample said he \"'saw people falling, running into each other... it was absolute chaos. It looked like a boulevard of madness.'  And I said, 'That's what street life is.'\" Sample teamed up with lyricist Will Jennings, who said that \"the lyric, all that came right off of Hollywood Boulevard\".\nSample first met Crawford when he played on her debut album Everything Must Change in 1976. After having good reviews about her song, but not being commercially successful, Crawford was then asked by Sample to sing the vocals for the song. As a result of this, the Crusaders produced her fourth album Now We May Begin, which became very successful.\nJazz reviewer Scott Yanow wrote \"Although the Crusaders could not have known it at the time, their recording of 'Street Life'... was a last hurrah for the 20-year old group. Their recordings of the next few years would decline in interest until the band gradually faded away in the ’80s.\" Whereas, for Crawford, this song brought her recognition and effectively marked the beginning of her career.\nTrack listings\n7\"\n# \"Street Life\" – 3:58\n# \"The Hustler\" – 3:50\n12\"\n# \"Street Life\" (Special Full Length US Disco Mix) – 7:50\n# \"The Hustler\" – 5:25\n12\" US promo\n# \"Street Life\" – 6:02\n# \"Street Life\" – 6:02\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Chart (1979)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|79\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nOther recordings and samples\n* In 1979, trumpeter Herb Alpert released a cover of the song from his album Rise.
