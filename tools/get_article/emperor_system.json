In a broad sense, \"Emperor system\" includes even the .\nUnder Empire of Japan's political system, which called for the legitimacy of political domination by Tennō rule, the term \"Emperor system\" was officially prohibited; it became an academic term when free discussions on the term \"Emperor system\" were held in postwar Japan and research papers using the term \"Emperor system\" were published.\nHistory\nAround the A.D. 3rd century, the decomposition of the primitive community progressed, and the leaders of the primitive community elevated themselves as priests of the primitive religion to transcendental beings close to God and reigned as military and political rulers. In this phone call from the primitive monarchy to the ancient monarchy, regimes were formed in each Japanese region with the powerful head as the king. In it, the head of power in Kinai formed the Yamato regime, calling it \"Okimi\" as the leader of a coalition of governments.\nThe title \"Emperor\" (天皇) was in 689 (Jitō period) that the Japan's king. Under the Ritsuryō established at the beginning of the 8th century, the emperor established himself as a Chinese style emperor with diplomatic and military authority, control authority, appointment of officials, and punishment rights. However, at the end of the 12th century, when Minamoto no Yoritomo destroyed the Taira clan and established the Kamakura Shogunate, he effectively deprived the emperor of an important part of his rule, and later, before the Meiji era, the Shogunate system was maintained as the de facto ruler of Japan for a long time.\nBy the end of the Edo period, the Sonnō jōi movement had spread, while the Tennō emerged as the core of the  (倒幕運動, lit. \"anti-Shogunate movement\"). The new Meiji government overthrew the Edo Shogunate and established the Meiji Restoration and established the Meiji Constitution, establishing the Tennō as the head of state.\nGovernment of Meiji Japan is recognized the introduction of a parliamentary system amid the disgruntled shizoku rebellion and the growth of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. The Meiji government was modeled after that of the German Empire. Under this style of government, Japan became a modern state; the culture of sanctifying the emperor helped it to achieve unity.\nDuring the prewar Shōwa era, ultranationalism was exploited by militarists and statist politicians who put forward Tennō is authority, which was considered sacred, leading to World War II.\nThe Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, which occupied Japan after its defeat in the Pacific War, dismantled the \"Emperor system\". Among its results was the Humanity Declaration issued by the then reigning Tennō, Hirohito. The \"Emperor system\" was replaced by the \"Symbolic Emperor System\", with the Tennō as a national symbol with no political power.\nSee also\n* Anti-monarchism in Japan\n* Emperor-system fascism\n* Gozen Kaigi\n* Kokutai\n* Reigning Emperor\n* Statism in Shōwa Japan\nReferences"
