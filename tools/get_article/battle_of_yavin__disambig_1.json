It serves as the chronological reference point for the franchise’s in-universe dating system, with years denoted as Before or After the Battle of Yavin (BBY/ABY).\nFollowing the Battle of Scarif, the Rebels obtain the plans for the Death Star, a massive Imperial space station with planet-destroying capability. The Empire locates the Rebel base on Yavin 4 and prepares to eliminate it using the Death Star. A hidden structural weakness is discovered, prompting the Rebels to launch a last-ditch assault. As the Death Star enters orbit, Rebel starfighters engage Imperial forces led by Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker, using the Force, successfully exploits the station’s vulnerability and destroys it. Vader survives and escapes.\nThe battle marks the Rebel Alliance's first major victory, though they are soon forced to relocate. Vader continues to pursue them, targeting leadership and key operatives.\nThe event is depicted in the 1977 film Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope. It was produced primarily using practical special effects and is further explored in related novels, comics, and video games.\nUniverse\n, the weapon of the Jedi, and a red lightsaber, the weapon of the Sith.]]\nThe Star Wars universe is set in a galaxy inhabited by humans and various alien species. It centers on the conflict between Jedi Knights and Sith Lords, Force-sensitive individuals who possess psychic abilities. The Jedi use the light side of the Force to maintain peace, while the Sith draw on the dark side to pursue power and domination.\nSince Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, Star Wars exists in two versions: \"Legends\" and \"Canon.\" Both include the six original films and the series The Clone Wars. \"Legends\" includes additional content released before 2014 in books, comics, games, and TV movies. \"Canon\" includes all material released since 2014.\nBackground\nYears before the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems begins developing a superweapon capable of destroying planets: the Death Star. Following the war in 19 BBY, the Galactic Republic becomes the Galactic Empire, and Grand Moff Tarkin oversees the Death Star’s construction, completed nearly two decades later. The weapon is designed to suppress opposition.\nFrom the Empire’s formation, resistance groups emerge, such as those led by Saw Gerrera and the crew of the Ghost. Following the massacre on Ghorman and Mon Mothma's condemnation of Emperor Palpatine as its perpetrator, the rebel cells merge together into an organized rebellion, the Rebel Alliance.\nPrelude\nOfficial Universe\nEngineer Galen Erso, involved in the Death Star’s design, secretly adds a fatal flaw. He sends a message to Saw Gerrera, urging his daughter Jyn Erso to retrieve the plans. With Rebel Alliance leadership refusing to openly oppose the Empire, Jyn defies orders and leads a small team with the improvised callsign Rogue One to the Imperial archive on Scarif. Rogue One is initially heavily outnumbered, but receives support from the newly-arrived Alliance Fleet. A battle follows, both on the planet and in space involving rebel forces and Imperial troops led by Darth Vader. Jyn successfully transmits the Death Star plans before the station destroys the facility. The plans are received by the Tantive IV, which escapes under Princess Leia Organa's command.\nLegends Universe\nOn the planet Toprawa, Rebel agents steal the Death Star plans and transmit them to the orbiting Tantive IV. The ship is intercepted by Darth Vader’s Star Destroyer and forced to flee.\nCommon part\nThe Tantive IV is intercepted by Darth Vader's Star Destroyer above Tatooine. Before capture, Princess Leia Organa hides the Death Star plans in the droid R2-D2, who escapes in a pod with C-3PO. On the planet’s surface, the droids are captured by Jawas and sold to Owen Lars, who assigns them to his nephew, Luke Skywalker. Luke discovers Leia’s message intended for Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, requesting help for the Rebellion. R2-D2 leaves to find Kenobi, followed by Luke and C-3PO. After an ambush by Tusken Raiders, they are rescued by Kenobi and taken to his home.\nkeeps the Death Star plans until he returns to Yavin 4.]]\nMeanwhile, Leia is imprisoned aboard the Death Star. With the Imperial Senate dissolved, she loses her political immunity. Grand Moff Tarkin demands the location of the Rebel base and threatens to destroy Alderaan. Although Leia names Dantooine, Tarkin orders Alderaan’s destruction.\nOn Tatooine, Luke learns his father was a Jedi, and Kenobi gives him his father’s lightsaber. Upon discovering his aunt and uncle killed by Imperial troops, Luke decides to join Kenobi and the droids. In Mos Eisley, they hire smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca to transport them to Alderaan. Pursued by stormtroopers, they flee the planet aboard the Millennium Falcon.\nThe group exits hyperspace into an asteroid field where Alderaan once existed. Following Imperial fighters, they approach a moon—only to realize it is the Death Star. Captured by a tractor beam, they infiltrate the station disguised as stormtroopers and rescue Leia. Obi-Wan Kenobi confronts Darth Vader, ultimately sacrificing himself so the others can escape.\nThey reach the Rebel base on Yavin 4, where R2-D2 delivers the Death Star plans. Rebel engineers identify a structural weakness. However, the Empire had placed a tracker on the Falcon, allowing Tarkin and Vader to locate the base and send the Death Star to destroy it.\nBattlefield\naround Yavin.]]\nThe battle takes place in orbit around the gas giant Yavin, near its fourth moon, Yavin 4. It occurs both in open space and within the Death Star’s surface trenches.\nTechnologies\n.]]\nThe Imperial forces consist of the Death Star, a mobile battle station capable of destroying entire planets, supported by TIE fighters, the Empire’s standard combat vessels. Darth Vader participates in the battle aboard his customized TIE Advanced X1, optimized for performance and fitted to his armor.\npilot in front of Luke Skywalker's X-wing interceptor.]]\nThe Rebel forces include two squadrons: Gold Squadron, led by Jon \"Dutch\" Vander, composed of Y-wing bombers; and Red Squadron, led by Garven Dreis, composed of X-wing fighters. They are supported by the Millennium Falcon, piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca.\nCourse\nWhen the Death Star arrives at Yavin, it must maneuver into position before it can target the Rebel base. This delay allows the Rebels to launch an assault. The station’s weakness lies in a small exhaust port that, if hit by a proton torpedo, will trigger a chain reaction. Red and Gold squadrons launch their attack. Luke Skywalker, designated \"Red 5,\" joins the mission with R2-D2 as his astromech. TIE fighters intercept the assault, engaging Red Squadron while Gold Squadron attempts a trench run.\nGold Squadron is destroyed by Vader, prompting Red Squadron to take over. One by one, they are eliminated, leaving only Skywalker. As Vader closes in, the Millennium Falcon intervenes, damaging one TIE fighter and causing another to crash into Vader’s ship, sending him out of control. Guided by Obi-Wan Kenobi's voice, Luke uses the Force to fire a successful torpedo shot, destroying the Death Star moments before it can fire on Yavin.\nReview\nThe Battle of Yavin is a victory for the Rebel Alliance. The Death Star and nearly all of its personnel are destroyed. Darth Vader is the only known Imperial survivor, escaping in his damaged fighter.\nRebel losses are considerable. Aside from the Millennium Falcon, only three ships return from the original assault, including those piloted by Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles. Both squadron leaders are killed in action.\nConsequences\nFollowing the battle, the Empire begins constructing a second, larger Death Star near Endor. With their Yavin 4 base compromised, the Rebels relocate to the ice planet Hoth in the Outer Rim. The second Death Star is later destroyed in a subsequent engagement.\nConcept and creation\nused for special effects in the film A New Hope.]]\nPrior to filming A New Hope, George Lucas collaborated with model maker Colin Cantwell and artist Ralph McQuarrie. Cantwell designed early versions of the Y-wing and Millennium Falcon, while McQuarrie illustrated key scenes, including a Y-wing attack on the Death Star.\nOnly one full-scale X-wing was constructed, shown in the Yavin 4 hangar. Space battle scenes were created using practical effects. A single cockpit set was used, with actors rotating through it and droids swapped as needed.\nIn the 1997 and 2004 re-releases, several space battle scenes were enhanced with digital effects. These updates included additional rebel ships, improved explosions, and a shockwave added to the Death Star’s destruction.\nAdaptation\nBeyond films, novels, and television, the Battle of Yavin appears in various Star Wars-related derivative works.\nVideo games\narcade game vertical terminal.]]\nThe battle is featured in numerous video games. In Star Wars: Empire at War (2006), players can control either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance during the conflict around Yavin. Star Wars: X-Wing (1993) and Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (1998) allow players to assume the role of Luke Skywalker in missions involving the Death Star assault.\nIts sequel, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron II - Rogue Leader (2002), opens with the trench run sequence. The mobile game Star Wars: Trench Run (2009) simulates the trench battle from a pilot’s perspective.\nThe arcade game Star Wars (1983) includes scenes based on the surface of the Death Star.\nFigurines\nNumerous action figures depict characters from the battle., Hasbro released figures of Red Squadron and Imperial pilots in 2012, as well as earlier figures of Wedge Antilles, General Jan Dodonna, and Dutch Vander in 2004–2005.\nLEGO released a Yavin 4 playset in 2012 (Set #9677), which includes a model of Luke Skywalker’s X-wing.\nAmusement parks\nA segment of the original Star Tours ride at Disney parks was inspired by the Battle of Yavin. Riders, aboard a Starspeeder 3000, join a Rebel assault on a third Death Star. This version of the ride existed at Disneyland and Walt Disney World (until 2010), Tokyo Disney Resort in Japan (until 2012), and Disneyland Paris in France (until 2016) before being replaced by Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.\nReception\nScreen Rant ranks the battle third among the original Star Wars trilogy, praising its visual effects and Han Solo’s intervention. In a separate list covering the entire saga, it places the battle first for its tension and pacing. PubSquare Media also ranks it first, while Looper ranks it fifth, citing its smaller scale compared to later battles.\nPosterity\nIn fan culture\nFan estimates of casualties aboard the Death Star vary, though figures often suggest approximately one million personnel were present at the time of its destruction. Online creators have reimagined the battle, including a video simulating the Death Star laser’s real-world appearance and a LEGO animation recreating the trench run with some liberties. Some fans humorously parody real-world conspiracy theories by suggesting the Empire may have intentionally allowed the Death Star’s destruction.\nThe battle is referenced in pop culture, notably in The Simpsons. In \"My Sister, My Sitter\" from Season 8, Bart hears a voice advising him like Obi-Wan. In \"Pygmoelian\" from Season 11, a line referencing Darth Vader is used. A comic from 1999 also parodies the scene with Santa’s Little Helper wearing Biggs Darklighter’s helmet.\nStar Wars timeline reference point\nThe Battle of Yavin serves as the baseline for the Star Wars dating system, with years marked as BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin) and ABY (After the Battle of Yavin), using a 365-day year. For instance, the Battle of Geonosis occurs in 22 BBY, and the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY.\nHowever, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Guide (2019) adopts a different reference point—the Battle of Starkiller Base from The Force Awakens (2015).\nNotes and references\nNotes\nReferences\nSee also\n* Star Wars\n* List of Star Wars films\n* List of Star Wars'' television series\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*  }}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.starwars.com/ Official Star Wars website]\n*\n* [https://www.starwars-holonet.com/encyclopedie/evenement-yavin.html#fiche_2 Article on the Battle of Yavin, on Star Wars Holonet]"
