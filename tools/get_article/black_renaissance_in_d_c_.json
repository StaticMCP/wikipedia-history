Washington, D.C. had the country's largest Black community from 1900 to 1920, heavily influencing the development of the Black Renaissance in the area.\nWhile the Black Renaissance movement ultimately began in Harlem, Manhattan, New York, with the Harlem Renaissance, the movement ultimately spread to cities across the United States. In Washington, D.C., the movement began on July 19, 1919, with the alleged sexual assault of a white woman by a black predator. The event was never confirmed, but it incited inflammatory responses from the four daily newspapers in the city. Several hundred whites formed a mob near Murder Bay off of Pennsylvania Avenue, a neighborhood known for prostitution and violence. The mob went on to assault a Black couple who were walking on 9th and D Streets, Southwest. Many prominent figures in the Harlem movement had strong roots in Washington, D.C. and heavily influenced the movement there.\nDevelopment\nMusic\nU Street and Shaw was known as a place of entertainment and jazz music during this era. As a result of its cultural importance, U street was often referred to as \"Black Broadway\".\nCharacteristics and themes\nImportant figures\nSee also\n*African-American art\n*African-American culture\n*African-American literature\n*Black Arts Movement\n*Blackbirds of 1928\n*Chicago Black Renaissance\n*Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance (book)\n*Harlem Renaissance\n*List of African-American visual artists\n*List of female entertainers of the Harlem Renaissance\n*List of figures from the Harlem Renaissance\n*New Negro\n*The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke\n*Niggerati\n*Roaring Twenties\n*Shuffle Along\n*William E.
