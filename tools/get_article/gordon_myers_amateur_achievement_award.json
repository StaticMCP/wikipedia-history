It recognizes \"significant contributions to astronomy or amateur astronomy by those not employed in the field of astronomy in a professional capacity.\" The contributions can be done in the fields of both observational astronomy or astronomical technologies. The award has been given to amateur astronomers from various countries since 1979 and has become one of the most geographically diverse astronomical awards.\nAward winners receive a commemorative plaque, which is presented at the Annual Meeting Awards Banquet. The monetary value of the award is US$500. Candidates can be nominated by any member of the astronomical community (with the exception of the nominees themselves and their families) and the nominations should be accompanied by other letters of support. All the nominations have to be delivered to the Astronomical Society of the Pacific by December 15 of the nominating year and remain valid for three years. The winners are selected by the Awards Committee appointed by the Board of Directors. The committee have the right not to award any of the nominees if they do not consider their achievements exceptional enough, which has already happened several times.\nWinners\nRecipients of the award have been:\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!scope=col| Year\n!scope=col width=130 | Name\n!scope=col| Nationality\n!scope=col style=\"text-align:left\"| Field\n!scope=col| Notes\n|-\n| 1979\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Occultations\n|\n|-\n| 1980\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Variable stars\n|\n|-\n| 1981\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Novae/Comets\n|\n|-\n| 1982\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Problicom\n|\n|-\n| 1983\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Asteroids\n|\n|-\n| 1984\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Photoelectric photometry\n|\n|-\n| 1985\n!scope=row|  & Robert Evans\n|\n| Supernovae\n|}\n|\n|-\n| 1986\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Computational astronomy\n|\n|-\n| 1987\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Variable stars\n|\n|-\n| 1988\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Astrophotography\n|\n|-\n| 1989\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Double stars\n|\n|-\n| 1990\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Meteorites\n|\n|-\n| 1991\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Asteroid orbits\n|\n|-\n| 1992\n!scope=row|  &Helen Lines\n|\n| Photoelectric photometry of variable stars\n|\n|-\n| 1993\n!scope=row|\n| /\n| Comets\n|\n|-\n| 1994\n!scope=row|\n|\n| ALPO founder\n|\n|-\n| 1995\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Planetary imaging\n|\n|-\n| 1996\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Variable stars\n|\n|-\n| 1997\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Variable stars/occultations\n|\n|-\n| 1998\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Variable stars/comets\n|\n|-\n| 1999\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Trans-Neptunian objects\n|\n|-\n| 2000\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Deep-sky imaging/Comet Hyakutake\n|\n|-\n| 2001\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Computing comet orbits\n|\n|-\n| 2002\n!scope=row|\n| colspan = 3| No award\n|-\n| 2003\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Near-Earth asteroids\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Imaging and image processing\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Light pollution\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Visual and CCD observations of variable stars/comets\n|\n|-\n| 2007\n!scope=row|\n|\n| R Coronae Borealis stars/variable star monitoring\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n!scope=row|\n|\n| CCD imaging\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Developing CCD instrumentation and a worldwide sky survey program\n|\n|-\n| 2010\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Adapted Canadian Meteorological Centre forecast products for the purpose of planning observing sessions with highly accurate high resolution point forecasts of cloud cover, transparency, seeing, darkness, wind, temperature and humidity over North and Central America\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Advancing the fields of extra-solar planet research and stellar astrophysics\n|\n|-\n| 2012\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Photoelectric photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n!scope=row|\n| colspan = 3| No award\n|-\n| 2014\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Instrumental in helping redefine the Z Cam sub-type of dwarf novae, and discovered the recurrent nova V745 Sco in outburst in the morning sky, triggering an AAVSO Alert Notice and significant attention from the astronomical community\n|\n|-\n| 2015\n!scope=row|\n|colspan=3| No award\n|-\n| 2016\n!scope=row|\n|colspan=3| No award\n|-\n| 2017\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Supernovae/Comets\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n!scope=row|\n|\n| Exoplanets\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n!scope=row|\n|colspan=3| No award\n|-\n| 2020\n!scope=row|\n|colspan=3| No award\n|-\n| 2021\n!scope=row|\n|colspan=3| No award\n|-\n|2022\n!scope=row|\n|\n|Solar eclypses, divulgation, occultations\n|\n|}\nSee also\nOther Astronomical Society of the Pacific awards:\n* Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal\n* Klumpke-Roberts Award\n* Robert J.
