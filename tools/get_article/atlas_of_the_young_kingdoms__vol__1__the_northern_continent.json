What it doesn't do is read very well. All right, so the author makes a real effort to embellish his copy with all manner of lurid detail and clever turns of phrase, but he seems to do so in such a way that it makes reading this supplement almost painful — it's all so horribly clichéd. This is a shame, because it means that instead of racing through it, eagerly devouring each paragraph as you progress, you end up either having to force yourself, or you waste time laughing over phrases such as, 'Her head lies unnoticed in a far corner, a beatific smile still carved on her lips'. That's a little more detail than I need about a smashed statue, but thanks anyway.\"\nReviews\n* #4 (as \"Le Continent Nord: Atlas des Jeunes Royaumes, Vol. 1\")\n*Australian Realms #30\n*Casus Belli #108 (as \"Atlas des Jeunes Royaumes Vol. 1, Le continent nord\")\nReferences"
