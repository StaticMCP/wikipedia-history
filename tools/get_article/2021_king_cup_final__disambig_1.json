This was the eighth King Cup final hosted in the King Fahd International Stadium following those in 1988, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2019 and 2020.\nThe King Fahd International Stadium was built in 1982 and was opened in 1987. The stadium was used as a venue for the 1992, 1995, and the 1997 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup. Its current capacity is 68,752 and it is used by the Saudi Arabia national football team, Al-Hilal, Al-Shabab, and major domestic matches.\nBackground\nAl-Taawoun reached their third final after a 3–2 win against Al-Fateh. This was Al-Taawoun's second final in three years. Al-Taawoun won their first title in 2019 after defeating Al-Ittihad and finished as runners-up in 1990.\nAl-Faisaly reached their second final, after a 1–0 away win against Al-Nassr. This was Al-Faisaly's first final since 2018, which they lost against Al-Ittihad.\nThe two teams met twice earlier in the season with both matches ending in draws. This was the first meeting between these two sides in the King Cup and the 46th meeting between them in all competitions. In the clubs' 45 previous meetings, Al-Taawoun won 21, Al-Faisaly won 13 and the remaining 11 were drawn.\nRoad to the final\nNote: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\n{| width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=top bgcolor=#99ccff\n!colspan=2 style=\"width:40%\"|Al-Taawoun\n!Round\n!colspan=2 style=\"width:40%\"|Al-Faisaly\n|- valign=top bgcolor=#c1e0ff\n|Opponent\n|Result\n|bgcolor=#c1e0ff|2020–21 King Cup\n|Opponent\n|Result\n|-\n|Damac (A)\n|2–1\n|bgcolor=#c1e0ff|Round of 16\n|Al-Ettifaq (A)\n|0–0 (9–8 p)\n|-\n|Al-Qadsiah (H)\n|2–1\n|bgcolor=#c1e0ff|Quarter-finals\n|Al-Batin (A)\n|2–1\n|-\n|Al-Fateh (H)\n|3–2\n|bgcolor=#c1e0ff|Semi-finals\n|Al-Nassr (A)\n|1–0\n|}\nMatch\nDetails\n|time       = 21:00 AST\n|team1      = Al-Taawoun\n|score      = 2–3\n|report     = https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2021/05/27/saudi-arabia/champions-cup/al-taawon-buraidah/al-faysaly-al-majmaah/3495719/\n|team2      = Al-Faisaly\n|goals1     =\n*Tawamba\n*Kaku\n|goals2     =\n*Tavares\n|stadium    = King Fahd International Stadium, Riyadh\n|attendance = }}\n|referee    = Szymon Marciniak (Poland)\n}}\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK ||1 || Cássio\n|-\n|RB ||2 || Yassin Barnawi\n|-\n|CB ||33|| Ahmed Assiri (c) ||  ||\n|-\n|CB ||4 || Iago Santos\n|-\n|LB ||14|| Hassan Kadesh || ||\n|-\n|CM ||17|| Cédric Amissi ||  ||\n|-\n|CM ||55|| Sandro Manoel || ||\n|-\n|RW ||29|| Abdullah Al-Jouei\n|-\n|AM ||10|| Kaku\n|-\n|LW ||8 || Sumayhan Al-Nabit ||\n|-\n|CF ||3 || Léandre Tawamba\n|-\n|colspan=3|Substitutes:\n|-\n|GK ||23|| Hussain Shae'an\n|-\n|DF ||6 || Mohammed Al-Ghamdi || ||\n|-\n|DF ||25|| Faisal Darwish\n|-\n|DF ||85|| Nawaf Al-Sobhi || ||\n|-\n|MF ||5 || Ryan Al-Mousa\n|-\n|MF ||11|| Ali Al-Nemer\n|-\n|MF ||66|| Mohammed Abousaban || ||\n|-\n|FW ||24|| Mohammad Al-Sahlawi || ||\n|-\n|FW ||27|| Abdoulaye Sané\n|-\n|colspan=3|Manager:\n|-\n|colspan=3| Nestor El Maestro\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK ||28|| Ahmed Al-Kassar (c)\n|-\n|RB ||14|| Ali Majrashi  ||\n|-\n|CB ||87|| Meshal Al-Sebyani || ||\n|-\n|CB ||24|| Waleed Al-Ahmed\n|-\n|LB ||18|| Mohammed Qassem\n|-\n|CM ||6 || Hicham Faik\n|-\n|CM ||52|| Alexander Merkel\n|-\n|RW ||77|| Khalid Kaabi || ||\n|-\n|AM ||23|| Romain Amalfitano || ||\n|-\n|LW ||25|| Ismail Omar ||  ||\n|-\n|CF ||19|| Júlio Tavares\n|-\n|colspan=3|Substitutes:\n|-\n|GK ||26|| Mustafa Malayekah\n|-\n|DF ||2 || Abdullah Al-Hassan\n|-\n|DF ||17|| Mohammed Al-Nukhylan ||  ||\n|-\n|DF ||51|| Hussain Qassem || ||\n|-\n|MF ||8 || Khaled Al-Samiri\n|-\n|MF ||12|| Shaye Sharahili || ||\n|-\n|MF ||47|| Mustafa Bassas\n|-\n|MF ||88|| Abdulaziz Al-Sharid || ||\n|-\n|FW ||80|| Mohammed Al-Saiari\n|-\n|colspan=3|Manager:\n|-\n|colspan=3| Péricles Chamusca\n|}\n|}\n{| width=100% style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|\nAssistant referees:\nTomasz Listkiewicz (Poland)Pawel Sokolnicki (Poland)\nFourth official:\nMajed Al-Shamrani\nVideo assistant referee:\nTomasz Musiał (Poland)\nAssistant video assistant referees:\nFaisal Al-Qahtani\n|}\n|style=\"width:60%;vertical-align:top\"|\nMatch rules\n*90 minutes\n*30 minutes of extra time if necessary\n*Penalty shoot-out if scores still level\n*Nine named substitutes\n*Maximum of five substitutions, with a sixth allowed in extra time\n|}\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+First half\n|-\n!
