In the , Daisy Hill had a population of 6,925 people.\nGeography\nLocated 4 km east of Logan central and 22 km south-east of central Brisbane. The suburb's southern boundary is the Pacific Motorway, A large proportion of Daisy Hill is protected by the Daisy Hill Conservation Park.\nHistory\nThe Dennis family were first Europeans to settle at Daisy Hill. James Dennis immigrated in 1864 on the ship Flying Cloud. In 1867, he married Mary Ann Markwell. Around 1870 they began selecting land in the now Daisy Hill area, eventually acquiring over . They named the property Daisy Hill, because their daughters saw Olearia nernstii growing in proliferation on the hill.\nSlacks Creek Provisional School opened on 19 May 1873 in the original Wesleyan Church located on Markwell property on Loganlea Road. In July 1879 it relocated to a new site on Loganlea Road. Due to flooding at that site, it was moved in 1893 to Logan Road near the intersection with Daisy Hill Road. On 1 January 1909 it became Slacks Creek State School. In 1964, due to the increasingly heavy traffic on Logan Road, the school was relocated to its current site. On 14 October 2016 it was renamed Daisy Hill State School as changes to the suburban boundaries had resulted in the school no longer being within Slacks Creek but was within Daisy Hill.\nThe Daisy Hill State Forest was declared a timber reserve in 1874. In 1917 it was declared a State Forest and in 1986 a State Forest Park. The forest was used for timber gathering, honey making, gold mining and grazing. In 2006, it was gazetted as Daisy Hill Conservation Park to be used for habitat conservation and recreation; it contains the Daisy Hill Koala Centre which was opened in May 1995. In June 2017, the Queensland State Government allocated Daisy Hill Koala Centre $3.3 million to upgrade the premises, in the lead up to the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.\nA Reserve for Rifle Range was gazetted in 1901 from part of the west side of the original timber reserve. It was proposed for use by the Forest Rangers Rifle Club of Slacks Creek with a recommendation from the Queensland Defence Force. Initially the range consisted of , , with the line of fire terminated by a natural rise. The range was re-gazetted as reserve R.799 in 1902 with an increase in area towards and behind the targets for safety, forming a total area of around . In 1908, the military officer supervising rifle clubs in Queensland reported that the range was not then in use due to destruction of mantlets and targets by bush fire. The land was reinstated as part of the State Forest in 1952.\nOther early pioneers were the Usher family, who grew grapes and made and sold wine.\nDaisy Hill was once part of the Shire of Tingalpa.\nThe first Catholic Church of St Edward the Confessor was opened circa May 1978. It burned down on 11 January 1988. On 26 August 1988, the new Catholic Church of St Edward the Confessor was officially opened by Archbishop Francis Rush.\nSt Edward the Confessor Catholic School opened in 1978.\nJohn Paul College opened on 26 January 1982.\nDemographics\nIn the , Daisy Hill had a population of 6,255 people, 49.7% female and 50.3% male.
