It is taken for granted that the audience would swallow anything if it has the label of a 'devotional' film. There is a couple of interesting computer graphics. But graphics can do only that much, when the screenplay is so weak\". Indiainfo wrote \"Many of the deeds of Ramya and counter by the goddess give the ample scope to put full power the graphics. Ramya does a good job in the title role. It looks as if the director has (Bharathi Kannan) has weaved an interesting tale only to suit the graphics\". The Hindu wrote \"All the lead stars have dual roles to play. Ramki does not have much to do. Ramya Krishnan hogs the limelight and does justice to her roles. `Nizhalgal' Ravi does a neat job. Ponnambalam and Thyagu are adequate. Vadivelu's comedy is average. Bhanupriya as the goddess has nothing much to offer\". Screen India wrote \"Director Bharathi Kannan has tried his best to weave an interesting tale to suit the graphics man and in the process lost out on the narration\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://broadband.bigflix.com/bigflicks/faces/jsp/movieDetails.jsp?titleId=1229 broadband.bigflix.com, Sree Raja Rajeswari film details]"
