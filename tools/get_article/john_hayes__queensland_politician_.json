He was a Labor Party member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1932 to 1947, representing the electorate of Nundah.\nHayes was born at Ipswich, Queensland, the son of John Patrick Hayes and his wife Mary Jane (née McGrath). He was educated at St Mary's Catholic Primary School and the Christian Brothers College, both in Ipswich. On leaving school he was a draper's assistant, working in Ipswich, Maryborough, and Brisbane before becoming an insurance salesman. A long-time member of the Shop Assistants and Warehouse Employees Union, he became its executive officer and a union delegate, and was the secretary of the Nundah branch of the Labor Party. He married Eleanore Ann O'Neill on 3 November 1923 (died 1970) in Brisbane; together they had one son (died 1961) and four daughters.\nHe was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1932 election. In 1942, he obtained leave from parliament to serve in World War II, serving as a corporal in the 8th Australian Motor Corps of the Second Australian Imperial Force until 1944. Hayes lost preselection for the 1947 state election to Frank Roberts and retired from politics. After leaving politics, he was a clerical officer and investigator for the Queensland Government Tourist Bureau.\nHayes died in June 1986 and was buried at the Pinnaroo Lawn Cemetery. He remained involved with the Labor Party at a local level until his death, and was the second-last surviving member of the 1932-1942 Forgan Smith government.\nReferences"
