They ran diagonally across the river from Counihan Road (see map). These rocks were partially removed in the 1860s to make the river more navigable. However, some of the rocks survived and were marked with beacons to warn shipping. Between 1960 and 1966 all of the remaining rocks were removed to widen the river and allow access for marine vessels to further reaches of the river.\nA Bible Christian Chapel (a denomination of Methodism) was opened in Seventeen Mile Rocks in July 1869.\nSeventeen Mile Rocks State School opened circa 1874. It closed in 1966. It was Goggs Road opposite the junction with Seventeen Miles Rocks Road () which is now within the suburb of Jindalee. Jindalee Home shopping centre is now on that site.\nA portion of Seventeen Mile Rocks comes from the Wolston Estate, consisting of 54 farms on an area of 3000 acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901.

Only three of the farms sold at the original auction.\nThe suburb was previously an industrial one; but in recent years new housing estates have been developed greatly increasing the residential population.
