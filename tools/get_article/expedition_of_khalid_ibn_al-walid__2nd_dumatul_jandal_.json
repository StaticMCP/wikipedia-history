He also ordered Khalid to destroy an idol that was worshipped by the Bani Kalb tribe.\nThis was the second time Khalid was sent on a military invasion to Dumat Al-Jandal. He was also sent to Dumatul Jandal in March 631 to invade the land of a Christian prince who ruled the area.\nWadd\nWadd () meaning the God of Love and Friendship, also known as Almaqah, ʻAmm and Sīn, was the Minaean moon god. Snakes were held sacred to the believers of Wadd.
