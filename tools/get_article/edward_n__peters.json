He attended Saint Louis University, majoring in political science, graduating in 1979. He earned his Juris Doctor degree from University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law in 1982, during the third year of which he was a teaching assistant in the Legal Research and Writing Program for Tate Hall. After graduation, Peters was admitted to the Missouri Bar Association.\nProfessional career\nIn 1988, Peters earned his Licentiate of Canon Law degree from the Catholic University of America School of Canon Law and was named Quasten Fellow for doctoral studies there, completing doctoral course work in 1990, and defending his doctoral dissertation, Penal Procedural Law in the 1983 Code of Canon Law, in August 1991.\nOver the next twelve years, Peters served as director of the Office for Canonical Affairs, vice-chancellor and chancellor, Defender of the Bond, and collegial judge for diocesan and appellate tribunals for the dioceses of Duluth and San Diego.
