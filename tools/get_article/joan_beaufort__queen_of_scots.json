During part of the minority of her son James II (from 1437 to 1439), she served as the regent of Scotland, the first dowager Queen of Scotland to do so since the 13th century.\nBackground and early life\nJoan Beaufort was a daughter of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, a legitimised son of John of Gaunt by his mistress (and later third wife) Katherine Swynford. She was born in 1404. Joan's mother was Margaret Holland, the granddaughter of Joan of Kent (wife of Edward the Black Prince) from her earlier marriage to Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent. Joan was also a half-niece of King Henry IV of England, first cousin once removed of Richard II, and great-granddaughter of Edward III. Her uncle, Henry Beaufort, was a cardinal and Chancellor of England.\nKing James I of Scotland met Joan during his time as a prisoner in England, and knew her from at least 1420. She is said to have been the inspiration for King James's famous allegorical romantic poem, The Kingis Quair, written during his captivity, after he saw her from his window in the garden. The poem described her as ‘beautee eneuch to mak a world to dote.’\nThe marriage was at least partially political, as their marriage was part of the agreement for his release from captivity under the Treaty of London (4 December 1423). From an English perspective an alliance with the Beauforts was meant to establish Scotland's alliance with the English, rather than the French. Negotiations resulted in Joan's dowry of 10,000 marks being subtracted from James's substantial ransom.\nQueen of Scotland\nOn 12 February 1424, Joan Beaufort and King James were wed at St Mary Overie Church in Southwark. They were feasted at Winchester Palace that year by her uncle, Cardinal Henry Beaufort. She accompanied her husband on his return from captivity in England to Scotland, and was crowned alongside him at Scone Abbey.\nAs queen, she often pleaded with the king for those who might be executed. In 1429, Alexander Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, was captured after burning and pillaging the Scottish Highlands and she pleaded for him to be pardoned.\nThe royal couple had eight children, including the future James II, and Margaret of Scotland, future spouse of Louis XI of France. She also remained in contact with her English family, with her brothers and uncles visiting Joan and her husband ahead of formal embassies.\nRegency\nJames I was assassinated in the Dominican Friary in Perth on 21 February 1437. Joan had also been a target of assassination along with her husband and was wounded, but managed to survive her injuries. She put her husband’s mutilated body on display, causing shock and anger at the brutality of the murder throughout Europe.\nJoan successfully directed her husband's supporters to attack his assassin Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, but was forced to give up power three months later. The prospect of being ruled by an English woman was unpopular in Scotland. The Earl of Douglas was thus appointed to power, though Joan remained in charge of her son and represented his interests.\nLater life\nIn July 1439, she married James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorne, after obtaining a papal dispensation for both consanguinity and affinity. After the marriage she was styled Queen Dowager Joan of Scotland. She was the second Scottish queen mother to remarry.\nJames was an ally of the latest Earl of Douglas, and plotted with him to overthrow Alexander Livingston, governor of Stirling Castle, during the minority of James II. Livingston arrested Joan on 3 August 1439 and forced her to relinquish custody of the young king until his majority. She was released on 31 August 1439. Joan died in 1445 at Dunbar Castle and was buried beside her first husband in the Carthusian Priory at Perth.\nIssue\nand Queen Joan Beaufort, from the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh.]]\nWith James I of Scotland Joan had six daughters and two sons:\n* Margaret Stewart, Princess of Scotland (1424–1445) married Dauphin Louis later King Louis XI of France.\n* Isabella Stewart, Princess of Scotland (1426–1494) married Francis I, Duke of Brittany.\n* Mary Stewart, Countess of Buchan (c. 1428 – 1465) married Wolfart VI van Borsselen in 1444.\n* Joan of Scotland, Countess of Morton (c. 1428–1486) married James Douglas, 1st Earl of Morton.\n* Alexander Stewart, Duke of Rothesay (born and died 1430); twin of James II.\n* King James II of Scotland (1430–1460) married Mary of Guelders on 3 July 1449.\n* Eleanor Stewart, Princess of Scotland (1433–1484) married Sigismund, Archduke of Austria.\n* Annabella Stewart, Princess of Scotland (c. 1436 – 1509) married and divorced firstly Louis of Savoy, and then married and divorced secondly George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly.\nWith James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorne:\n* John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl (c. 1440 – 1512), married firstly Margaret Douglas, Fair Maid of Galloway, and secondly Eleanor Sinclair.\n* James Stewart, 1st Earl of Buchan (1442–1499), married Margaret Ogilvy.\n* Andrew Stewart, Bishop of Moray from 1483-1501.
