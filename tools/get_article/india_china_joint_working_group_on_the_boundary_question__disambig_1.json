It was officially announced in a joint press communique in Beijing on 23 December 1988. A total of fifteen meetings of the JWG were held between 1989 and 2005. The last meeting was held on 30–31 March 2005.\nWhile the JWG was not able to resolve the boundary question, it was an important bilateral mechanism through which India and China gradually resolved certain aspects of the border problem. A \"hotline\" was set up between military commanders, border posts were opened, mechanisms for conveying troop positions were just some of the incremental changes accomplished.\nBackground\nThe relevant part of the joint press communique reads:\nThe JWG would be led by the Indian foreign secretary and the Chinese deputy foreign minister. The JWG had a three-point mandate, summarised as, make recommendations and maintain border peace pending a final solution utilising the expertise of military experts, communications experts, legal experts etc.\nRounds\n# 30 June – 4 July 1989\n# 30–31 August 1990\n# 12–14 May 1991\n# 20–21 February 1992\n# 27–29 October 1992\n# 24–27 June 1993\n# 6–7 July 1994\n# 18–20 August 1995\n# 16–18 October 1996\n# 4–5 August 1997\n# 26–27 April 1999\n# 28–29 April 2000\n# 31 July – 1 August 2001\n# 21–22 November 2002\n# 30–31 March 2005\nSee also\n* India–China border agreements\n** 1988: Joint press communique, 23 December\n** Confidence building measures\n*** 1993: Border Peace and Tranquility Agreement\n*** 1996: Agreement on Military Confidence Building Measures\n*** 2005: Protocol for the Implementation of Military Confidence Building Measures\n** Political measures\n*** 2003: Declaration on Principles for Relations and Comprehensive Cooperation\n*** 2005: Agreement on the Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for the Settlement of the India–China Boundary Question\n** 2012: Agreement on the Establishment of a Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India–China Border Affairs\n** 2013: Border Defence Cooperation Agreement\n** 2020: 5 point statement\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n*\n*"
