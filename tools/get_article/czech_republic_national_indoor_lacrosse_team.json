Team consists of amateur players, who are members of Czech box lacrosse league NBLL. A few Canadian players from the National Lacrosse League with Czech ancestors are also members of this team. Box lacrosse is the most popular form of lacrosse in the Czech Republic, the team has had better results than in field lacrosse.\nWorld Indoor Lacrosse Championship\nCzechs took part in the first World Indoor Lacrosse Championship (WILC) ever, held in Canada in 2003. They were overmatched by the international competition, but since they have become the best European box lacrosse national team. In 2007 they still weren't able to get to the semi-finals and finished in 7th place. In 2008, the Czech Republic was chosen as the host of 2011 WILC. Jim Veltman, one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time, became the Head Coach for this tournament. The Czech team showed plenty of improvements in Prague and they were able to beat England in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, they met the Iroquois Nationals, but this team was out of their powers. Although they lost to Team USA in the bronze medal game too, they presented themselves well and finished as the best European team.\nRoster\n2011 FIL World Indoor Lacrosse Championship roster\n{| border='0' cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n!width=30|#\n!width=60  align=center|Pos.\n!width=206 align=left|Player\n!width=250 align=left|Team\n|-\n|align=center|38\n|align=center|G\n|Kurtis Wagar\n| Philadelphia Wings\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|G\n|Tomáš Říha\n| LCC Radotín\n|-\n|align=center|25\n|align=center|G\n|Marek Dobrý\n| LC Jižní Město\n|-\n|align=center|61\n|align=center|D\n|Aleš Veselý\n| LC Jižní Město\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|D\n|Martin Mrlík (A)\n| TJ Malešice\n|-\n|align=center|77\n|align=center|D\n|Radek Derganz\n| TJ Malešice\n|-\n|align=center|15\n|align=center|D\n|Martin Hodaň\n| LCC Radotín\n|-\n|align=center|28\n|align=center|D\n|Ladislav Kopfstein\n| TJ Malešice\n|-\n|align=center|13\n|align=center|D\n|Tomáš Říha\n| LC Pardubice\n|-\n|align=center|16\n|align=center|D\n|Marek Brada\n| LC Slavia Praha\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|T\n|Jakub Nováček\n| LC Jižní Město\n|-\n|align=center|20\n|align=center|T\n|Adam Kostka\n| LCC Radotín\n|-\n|align=center|33\n|align=center|T\n|Martin Kostka\n| LCC Radotín\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|T\n|Radek Skála\n| LCC Radotín\n|-\n|align=center|97\n|align=center|T\n|Kyle Ross (A)\n| Toronto Rock\n|-\n|align=center|21\n|align=center|T\n|Chet Koneczny\n| Washington Stealth\n|-\n|align=center|29\n|align=center|F\n|Dominik Pešek\n| LCC Radotín\n|-\n|align=center|10\n|align=center|F\n|Pavel Došlý (C)\n| LC Jižní Město\n|-\n|align=center|9\n|align=center|F\n|Jiří Košťál\n| LCC Radotín\n|-\n|align=center|73\n|align=center|F\n|Petr Poupě (A)\n| LCC Radotín\n|-\n|align=center|24\n|align=center|F\n|Tomáš Beran\n| TJ Malešice\n|-\n|align=center|11\n|align=center|F\n|Jan Skokan\n| LC Pardubice\n|-\n|align=center|67\n|align=center|F\n|Jamie Plunkett\n| LC Jižní Město\n|-\n|}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.lacrosse.cz Official website of Czech Republic]"
