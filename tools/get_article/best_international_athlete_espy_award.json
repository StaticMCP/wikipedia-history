From 2008 to 2009, the award was split into Best Female International Athlete ESPY Award and Best Male International Athlete ESPY Award. The women's version of the award for 2008 and 2009 was presented to Mexican professional golfer Lorena Ochoa. The award was discontinued after 2009, but was reinstated in 2012.\nIn 2018, the award was restricted to soccer and renamed '''Best International Men's Soccer Player''', and a women's version of the award, also specific to soccer, was introduced at that time. Eligibility was still based on citizenship, regardless of the player's club affiliation. The 2018 and 2019 awards for the women's version were given to Australian soccer player Sam Kerr. The award's name was changed again in 2021 to '''Best International Athlete, Men's Soccer''', with the women's award undergoing an identical name change. The eligibility criteria also changed; both awards are now presented to soccer players who play at club level outside the United States, without regard to citizenship. The 2021 women's version of this award, and the first under the current eligibility criteria, was presented to Sam Mewis, an American who played her club soccer at Manchester City.\nBalloting for the award was conducted over the Internet by fans from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee. The ESPY Awards ceremony has been conducted in June or July since the 2002 ceremony; all awards conferred in that period reflect performance and achievement over the twelve months previous to presentation, which may span one or two seasons depending upon the recipient's particular sport. The award was not awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Best International Athlete ESPY Award winners\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Year\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!scope=\"col\"| Sportsperson\n!scope=\"col\"| Nation of birth\n!scope=\"col\"| Team\n!scope=\"col\"| Competition,federation,or league\n!scope=\"col\"| Sport\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=8 |Best International Athlete (2006–2017)\n|-\n|2006\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|St. Louis Cardinals\n|Major League Baseball\n|Baseball\n|\n|-\n|2007\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|\n|ATP Tour\n|Tennis\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|\n|ATP Tour\n|Tennis\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|\n|\n|Athletics\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|FC BarcelonaArgentina\n|La LigaFIFA/UEFA/AFA\n|Football\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|  (2)\n|\n|\n|\n|Athletics\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|Real MadridPortugal\n|La LigaFIFA/UEFA/FPF\n|Football\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|  (2)\n|\n|FC BarcelonaArgentina\n|La LigaFIFA/UEFA/AFA\n|Football\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|  (2)\n|\n|Real MadridPortugal\n|La LigaFIFA/UEFA/FPF\n|Football\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|  (3)\n|\n|\n|\n|Athletics\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=8 |'''Best International Men's Soccer Player (2018–2020)'\n|-\n|2018\n|\n!scope=\"row\"| (3)\n|\n|Real MadridPortugal\n|La LigaFIFA/UEFA/FPF\n|Football\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|\n!scope=\"row\"| (3)\n|\n|FC BarcelonaArgentina\n|La LigaFIFA/UEFA/AFA\n|Football\n|\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n|2020\n| colspan=7 align=center|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=8 |'Best International Athlete, Men's Soccer (2021–2022)'''\n|-\n|2021\n|\n!scope=\"row\"| (4)\n|\n|JuventusPortugal\n|Serie AFIFA/UEFA/FPF\n|Football\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|\n!scope=\"row\"|\n|\n|Paris Saint-GermainFrance\n|Ligue 1FIFA/UEFA/FFF\n|Football\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*AP Athlete of the Year\n*United Press International Athlete of the Year Award\nReferences"
