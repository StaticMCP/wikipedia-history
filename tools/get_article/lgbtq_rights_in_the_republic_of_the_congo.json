Homosexuality is legal in the Republic of the Congo, but same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections as opposite-sex couples, with reports of discrimination and abuse towards LGBTQ people.\nLaws regarding same-sex sexual activity\nSame-sex relationships have been legal in the Republic of the Congo since 1940. The text of the 1940 Penal Code, as amended in 2006, only prohibits same-sex sexual behaviour with a person younger than 21 years. There is an unequal age of consent, with it being 18 for opposite-sex sexual activity.\nRecognition of same-sex relationships\nThere is no legal recognition of same-sex unions.\nDiscrimination protections\nThere is no broad legal protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. However, some limited protections based on sexual orientation regarding personal data are in place.\n*Article 19 of Law No. 27-2020 on the Fight against Cybercrime states \"Anyone who, except in the cases provided for by law, places or stores on a computer medium or memory, without the express consent of the person concerned, personal data revealing, directly or indirectly, the person's ethnic origin, political, philosophical, or religious opinions, or trade union membership, or relating to the person's health or sexual orientation, shall be punished by imprisonment of at least one year to a maximum of five years and a fine of one million to ten million CFA francs, or both.\"\n*Articles 8, 10 and 15 of Decree No. 2025-66 relating to the Personal data of Air Passengers protects sexual orientation.\n*Law No. 29-2019 on the Protection of Personal Data protects a person's sexual life as sensitive and personal data in its Articles 4, 14 and 40.\nLiving conditions\nThe U.S. Department of State's 2010 Human Rights Report found that,\nThere was not a large openly gay or lesbian community due to the social stigma associated with homosexuality ... There were no known cases of violence or discrimination against gays, lesbians, or transgendered individuals during the year. While discrimination may exist due to the social stigma surrounding homosexuality, no such cases were reported to the NGOs or covered by the media.\nSummary table\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Same-sex sexual activity legal\n|  (Since 1940)\n|-\n| Equal age of consent\n|  (Since 1947)\n|-\n| Anti-discrimination laws in hate speech and violence\n|\n|-\n| Anti-discrimination laws in employment\n|\n|-\n| Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services\n|\n|-\n| Same-sex marriage\n|\n|-\n| Recognition of same-sex couples\n|\n|-\n| Step-child adoption by same-sex couples\n|\n|-\n| Joint adoption by same-sex couples\n|\n|-\n| Gays and lesbians allowed to serve openly in the military\n|\n|-\n| Right to change legal gender\n|\n|-\n| Conversion therapy made illegal\n|\n|-\n| Access to IVF for lesbians\n|\n|-\n| Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples\n|\n|-\n| MSMs allowed to donate blood\n|\n|}\nSee also\n* Human rights in the Republic of the Congo\n* LGBT rights in Africa\nReferences"
