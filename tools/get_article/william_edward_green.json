He was credited with nine aerial victories while flying the Airco DH.4, making him one of the few World War I aces who were bomber pilots.\nAfter World War I, he transferred from the Royal Air Force to the Territorial Army, serving until his death in action on 23 May 1940.\nEarly life\nWilliam Edward Green was born in Ipswich, Suffolk, England on 20 October 1898 the son of Henry Douglas and Caroline Green. He joined the Royal Flying Corps in June 1917.\nWorld War I\n\"Bill\" Green was commissioned a second lieutenant in August 1917. He completed training and was posted to 57 Squadron on 29 September 1917. He scored his first aerial victory on 6 January 1918. On 2 July 1918, Green was promoted to temporary captain (customarily accompanied by appointment as Flight Commander).\nOn a bombing run that 20 July, the eve of the Second Battle of Bapaume, his flight encountered the combination of blinding rain and Pfalz D.III scouts. He afterwards wrote to Dr. Joseph Kirkland, the father of Lieut. James Tweeddale Kirkland: ... About Kirkland and Riley, what happened was this: They were on a bomb raid which I was leading. The weather was very bad, and we had been followed around by Pfalz scouts. Just as we got to the objective and had dropped our bombs, a thunder storm burst right on top of us. The rain which followed absolutely blinded every one of us, with the result that the formation got split up.  I eventually collected a few of them, and having seen them across the lines, I waited for about ten or fifteen minutes, but seeing nothing I came home to find that Kirkland had not arrived. Later on we got a report through from the line that he had been seen going down over Hunland with the Huns following. Probably his engine was hit, or something like that. We are extremely sorry as he was such a topping fellow and awfully stout, and Riley no less so.\nOn 29 August 1918, Green scored his eighth win, only to be seriously shot about by a Fokker biplane; however, both he and his observer escaped unscathed. He scored his final win on 19 September 1918, having scored his nine victories incidental to his duties as an Airco DH.4 pilot. His Distinguished Flying Cross was gazetted after the armistice ended World War I, on 3 December 1918. The citation makes no mention of his acedom.\nA skilful, courageous pilot and a brilliant leader, conspicuous for his sound judgment. No difficulties daunt him, and he has never failed to carry out any task that he may have been set. He sets a splendid example to the whole squadron.\nList of aerial victories\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Date/time\n!Aircraft\n!Foe\n!Result\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 1\n| align=\"center\"| 6 January 1918 @ 1200 hours\n| Airco DH.4 serial number A7904\n| Albatros D.V\n| Driven down out of control\n| Lichtervelde\n| Observer/gunner: 2 Lt E H Wilson\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2\n| align=\"center\"| 24 January 1918 @ 1130 hours\n| Airco DH.4 s/n A2161\n| Fokker Triplane\n| Set afire; destroyed\n| Northwest of Roulers\n| Observer/gunner: 2 Lt H S Gros\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 3\n| align=\"center\"| 24 January 1918 @ 1130 hours\n| Airco DH.4 s/n A2161\n| Albatros D.V\n| Driven down out of control\n| Northwest of Roulers\n| Observer/gunner: 2 Lt H S Gros\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 4\n| align=\"center\"| 3 February 1918 @ 1245 hours\n| Airco DH.4 s/n A7674\n| Albatros D.V\n| Driven down out of control\n| Menen\n| Observer/gunner: 2 Lt H S Gros\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 5\n| align=\"center\"| 31 March 1918 @ 1115 hours\n| Airco DH.4 s/n A7904\n| Pfalz D.III\n| Driven down out of control\n| Bapaume\n| Observer/gunner: 2 Lt H S Gros\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 6\n| align=\"center\"| 10 August 1918 @ 1830 hours\n| Airco DH.4 s/n D9262\n| Fokker D.VII\n| Driven down out of control\n| Between Bray and Péronne\n| Observer/gunner: 2 Lt C G Smith\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 7\n| align=\"center\"| 10 August 1918 @ 1830 hours\n| Airco DH.4 s/n D9262\n| Fokker D.VII\n| Driven down out of control\n| Bray-Péronne\n| Observer/gunner: 2 Lt G C Smith\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 8\n| align=\"center\"| 29 August 1918 @ 0800 hours\n| Airco DH.4 s/n 9262\n| Fokker D.VII\n| Driven down out of control\n| Ytres\n| Observer/gunner: Lt A M Barron MC\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 9\n| align=\"center\"| 19 September 1918 @ 1725 hours\n| Airco DH.4 s/n D8419\n| Fokker D.VII\n| Driven down out of control\n| Havrincourt\n| Observer/gunner: Lt A M Barron MC\n|-\n|}\nPost World War I\nOn 3 February 1920 Green went on the unemployed list and surrendered his commission in the Royal Air Force upon appointment into the British Territorial Force.\nOn 9 April 1921, he was promoted temporary captain in 5th (Huntingdonshire) Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment.
