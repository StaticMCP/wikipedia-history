The short contains one of the earliest clear examples of the oriental riff that would become popular as a leitmotif for Asian culture following the release of the 1974 song Kung Fu Fighting.\nSynopsis\nBetty is the MC of \"Making Stars\", a stage revue introducing the \"stars of tomorrow\": a series of performing babies.  Acts include the Colorful 3 (a trio of stereotyped Black babies singing \"Hi De Ho\"), an Asian baby marksman, and a bouncing Russian baby named \"Little Miss Trotsky.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Making Stars on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnEB0Hh5bsI YouTube].\n* Making Stars at the [https://archive.today/20130117171839/http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/1680-Making_Stars.html Big Cartoon Database].\n* Making Stars at [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026669/ IMDb]."
