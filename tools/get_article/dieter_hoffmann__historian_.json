He completed his dissertation there in 1976 on the topic \"Stages in the Interaction between Science and Production: an attempt at Periodization using the Example of the History of Semiconductor Research.\" He completed his habilitation in 1989 with \"Studies on the Life and Work of Ernst Mach (1838-1916). Between 1975 and 1991 he worked at the Institute for Theory, History and Organization of Science under Hubert Laitko at the Academy of Sciences of the GDR. In 1978, together with Horst Kant, he created a working group on the history of physics in the Physical Society of the GDR, which Kant led until the reunification of Germany in 1990.\nAfter the reunification, Hoffmann was a scholar at the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and worked at the Physikalisch-Technischen Bundesanstalt. Between 1992 and 1995 he was also a member of the research focus on the history of science in Berlin. Since 1996 he has been a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, and since 1997 he has also been a  Privatdozent at the Humboldt University of Berlin. an der Humboldt-Universität Berlin.
