At the time of its release, it climbed to number six on the US Billboard 200 album chart, and has remained highly regarded by her fans over the ensuing decades. Presented as a sort of song cycle, the album opens and closes with two versions of the title song and the songs on each side segue directly into one another.\nThe Spanish language track \"Corazón\" (the Spanish word for \"heart\", also used as a term of endearment, as in this song's lyrics) was a moderate hit single from the album, as was \"Believe in Humanity\". The flip side of the latter single, \"You Light Up My Life\", charted separately from its A-side.\nCritical reception\n|rev2 = ''Christgau's Record Guide\n|rev2Score = B\n|rev3 = Rolling Stone\n|rev3score = (not favorable)\n}}\nRecord World'' described \"Corazón\" as being \"mostly instrumental and highly Latin\nflavored\" and with an \"outstanding rhythm track.\" AllMusic critic Jason Elias said that \"'Corazón' has Latin intonations and King certainly doesn't embarrass herself.\"\nRecord World said of the single \"Believe in Humanity\"/\"You Light Up My Life\" that \"'Believe' is a fine rocking tune with great orchestrations, while 'Light Up My Life' is a gently wistful ballad.\" Elias regarded \"Believe\" as being the best song on the album, saying that \"all of the elements coalesce and might make listeners wish they took the harder sound and well-meaning messages even further, even for the hell of it.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Carole King - vocals, piano, backing vocals, string and horn arrangements\n*David T.
