It was weakened by a split in 1888, when numerous members including Henri Rochefort followed General Georges Ernest Boulanger who synthesized Jacobin nationalism with socialism and many saw Boulangism as a possible way to socialism. Following the Boulangist dissidence, Vaillant re-centered the party around the idea of syndicalism and strike. The CRC was further reinforced in 1896 by the affiliation of the Revolutionary Communist Alliance (ACR), formed by dissidents of the Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (POSR).\nThe CRC was dissolved into the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1898.\nNotable members\n* Édouard Vaillant\nSee also\n*History of the Left in France\n*Socialist Revolutionary Party"
