The original house was constructed about 1847–1848, and is a -story, stuccoed brick house with a gable roof and side-passage plan.\nHistory\nThe house has sustained several periods of alteration and now manifests the proportions and details of the Colonial Revival style. Also on the property are the contributing Italianate style brick stable (c. 1847); a brick smokehouse; and a two-story single-pile dwelling that dates from the late-19th century and is known as the Office.\nMonterosa was built from 1847 to 1848 as the Warrenton home of former Virginia Governor, Congressman, and Confederate General William \"Extra Billy\" Smith. Smith had various structures built including the main house, a brick smokehouse, and an Italianate brick stable used for the U.S. Postal Service.\nDuring the American Civil War, the house changed hands between the Union and the Confederacy 67 times. This is largely due to the house's large size and strategic location along transportation routes.\nThe East Virginia Mineral and Warrenton Improvements Company purchased Monterosa from Smith's daughter, Mary Amelia Smith, in 1890 for $20,000 as part of a planned community south of Warrenton. Following the planned community's failure to materialize, Monterosa was sold to James Kerfoot Maddux in 1895 for $5,500.\nFollowing his purchase, Maddux renamed the property to Neptune Lodge after one of his racehorses. Maddux made renovations to the property adding Colonial Revival elements such as the porch. In 1930, Winifred May Maddux sold the property after inheriting it from her father. It has been privately owned since.\nMonterosa was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register in 1990. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.\nIn 2024, the Warrenton Historic District was expanded to include various properties including Monterosa. Later in 2024, the Town of Warrenton used Monterosa along with other historic buildings as justification for a code change allowing fines for neglectful property owners. The Town specifically referenced the property's missing windows and overgrown lot.\nReferences"
