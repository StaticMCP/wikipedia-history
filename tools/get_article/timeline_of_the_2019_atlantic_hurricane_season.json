It was the fourth consecutive above-normal Atlantic hurricane season.}} The season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2019, and ended on November&nbsp;30, 2019. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical systems form. However, storm formation is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated in 2019 by the formation of the season's first named storm, Subtropical Storm Andrea, on May&nbsp;20. The final storm of the season, Tropical Storm Sebastien, transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on November&nbsp;25.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2019 seasonal outlook called for 1017 named storms, including 59 hurricanes and 24 major hurricanes. Altogether, the season produced 18 named storms, including six hurricanes of which three intensified into major hurricanes.) and higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson wind speed scale are considered major hurricanes.}} Two major hurricanes, Dorian and Lorenzo, became Category 5 storms, causing the season to become the fourth consecutive with at least one Category 5 hurricane. Dorian inflicted catastrophic damage across the Bahamas. The hurricane killed at least 70 people and caused at least US$3.4 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane in the country's history.  While Lorenzo did not affect land as a Category 5 hurricane, it caused US$367 million in damage and killed 19, with over half of the deaths being attributed to the sinking of a tugboat known as the Bourbon Rhode. In March 2021, the name Dorian was retired from reuse in the North Atlantic by the World Meteorological Organization.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). The National Hurricane Center uses both UTC&nbsp;and the time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. The time zones utilized (east to west) prior to 2020 were: Atlantic, Eastern, and Central. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first with the respective regional time included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following the convention used in the National Hurricane Center's products. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nMay\nMay 20\n* 18:00&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. AST) at Subtropical Storm Andrea forms
