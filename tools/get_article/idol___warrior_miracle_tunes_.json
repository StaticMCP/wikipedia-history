The show is the first installment of the Girls × Heroine Series conceived by Takara Tomy and OLM, Inc. with the assistance of Shogakukan and EXPG Studio, aimed towards a female demographic between ages 2 to 6. The general director of the series is Takashi Miike, supported by a staff full of newcomer screenwriters and directors. The series stars Asaka Uchida, Suzuka Adachi, Yuzuha Oda, Rina Usukura, and Mio Nishiyama. The plot is centered on Japanese idol girl group Miracle² (pronounced \"miracle miracle\"), elementary and middle school girls who transform into Idol Warriors to retrieve the Sound Jewels, artifacts from the Music Kingdom, to stop the Demon King from taking over the world.\nAuditions were held in December 2015, and the cast was announced at Ciao Summer Festival in August 2016.

The show also launched a brief singing career for the main cast, with Miracle² holding music activities in real life to promote the show.\nDespite low television ratings, the show was a success for its primary demographic and was credited as the start of a \"new genre\" aimed towards elementary school girls, especially because of Miracle²'s music activities and the show's toy line. The series achieved a wide demographic appeal to girls, due to it being a live-action show centered on female interests, and with parents, who enjoyed the dancing and music. Two manga adaptations and a video game were released. Along with several dubs in Thailand, South Korea, and China, the show also received an Italian remake in 2018.

In addition, the official social media accounts had only 6,000 followers. However, in spite of this, Confidence magazine and Oricon determined it started a \"new genre\" for shows aimed at the female toddler to primary school age demographic. 1,000 people appeared at the first toy event, and the toys were sold out during the Christmas season. The show received over 100,004,000 total views when it was first broadcast in China in July 2018.\nThe first DVD compilation box peaked at #19 on the Oricon Weekly DVD Chart and sold 1,444 copies in its first week. The third DVD compilation box peaked at #13 and sold 1,291 copies in its first week.\nIdol × Warrior Miracle Tunes! was viewed as a new female counterpart to the Super Sentai series due to including female-oriented interests like Japanese idols, which were often seen in media targeted to young girls. Other editors at Real Sound believe the popularity of Idol × Warrior Miracle Tunes! came from the revived interest in live-action tokusatsu shows aimed at a female audience, which had declined in the early 1990s due to competing toy sales with Sailor Moon and growing interest in magical girl series in anime format.\nShogakukan project manager Reiko Sasaki stated that parents thought Idol × Warrior Miracle Tunes! was a new J-pop act at first, but the dancing and music had drawn in parents, after which viewership increased. Sumiko Kodama from Confidence noted that the show's integration of J-pop elements in collaboration with LDH also made the presentation easy for audiences of all ages to enjoy, as Miracle²'s real-life debut would remind older audiences of Speed. Eriko Ishii from Real Sound praised the show for paying attention to details that would make the show appealing to its main female demographic while comparing the music to Tetsuya Komuro and stating that parents who are drawn in by the J-pop appeal would also want to \"cheer for them.\"\nAs for the music activities of the show's main cast, the music video for Miracle²'s debut song, \"Catch Me!\", amassed more than 5 million views on YouTube. \"Catch Me!\" also sold over 5,000 copies within the first week of sales, with 3,000 people attending the release event. Miracle Best: Complete Miracle² Songs sold over 31,000 copies, with 24,000 copies sold on its first week of release. A consecutive total of 3,000 people attended their final concert tour in March 2018, with a total of 1,500 people for each of their two shows.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://miracle2.jp/ Official Miracle² website]"
