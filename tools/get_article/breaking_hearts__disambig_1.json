It was released on 18 June 1984 through John's Rocket label in the UK and Geffen Records in the US. Like the preceding Too Low for Zero (1983), the album was produced by Chris Thomas and features the classic Elton John Band lineup of Davey Johnstone on guitar, Dee Murray on bass, and Nigel Olsson on drums.\nUpon release, Breaking Hearts was a commercial success, peaking at number two in the UK and number 20 in the US. \"Sad Songs (Say So Much)\" was released as the album's lead single and reached number five in the US and number seven in the UK. Four further singles were released, including \"Passengers\", which reached number five in the UK, as well as \"Who Wears These Shoes?\" and \"In Neon\", both of which reached the top 40 in the US.\nBackground\nThis album would be the last to feature all (core) members of the \"classic Elton John Band lineup\" playing their instruments (although they would reunite to provide backing vocals on John's Reg Strikes Back album). It was the last of Elton John's studio albums to feature bass from Dee Murray, who would die in 1992 of skin cancer, and it was the last studio album until 2001's Songs from the West Coast that would feature Nigel Olsson on drums. It was also the last recorded album in which John played both piano and keyboards in the studio by himself.\nBreaking Hearts was also the first album since Victim of Love to not feature a string or horn section on any track. This is one of only two albums with John's classic band to which (unofficial member) Ray Cooper did not contribute at all, the other being 1973's ''Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player''. Shortly after the tour, the band line-up would change and Gus Dudgeon, John's former producer, would produce the next two albums. In the US, it was certified gold in September 1984 and platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA.\nJohn has continued performing \"Sad Songs (Say So Much)\" as of 2023, as he included the song in his Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour setlist. Apart from the 1984 Breaking Hearts Tour (both the European and the North American leg), no other songs from the album have been performed live except \"Restless\" and \"Passengers\", on the following 1985–1986 Ice on Fire World Tour (the latter song only performed on the UK leg).\nTrack listing\n* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1–10 on CD reissues.\nPersonnel\nTrack numbering refers to CD and digital releases of the album.\nMusicians\n* Elton John – lead and backing vocals, synthesizers (tracks 1–3, 5–7, 9, 10), pianos (tracks 3–5, 7–10), Hammond organ (track 5), Fender Rhodes (track 7), clavinet (track 10)\n* Davey Johnstone – backing vocals (tracks 1–4, 6–10), electric guitar (tracks 1–3, 5, 7–9), acoustic guitar (tracks 2, 6–8, 10), sitar (track 9)\n* Dee Murray – bass guitar (tracks 1–3, 5–10), backing vocals (tracks 1–4, 6–10)\n* Nigel Olsson – drums (tracks 1–3, 5–10), backing vocals (tracks 1–4, 6–10)\n* Andrew Thompson – saxophone (track 5)\nProduction\n* Chris Thomas – producer\n* Renate Blauel – recording\n* Tim Young – mastering (UK)\n* Greg Fulginiti – mastering (US)\n* David Costa – art direction, design\n* Richard Young – photography\n* Patrick Jones – band photography\n* Herb Ritts – Bernie Taupin photo\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for Breaking Hearts\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984–1985)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n|1\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon)\n|54\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Spanish Albums (AFYVE)\n|5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Year-end chart performance for Breaking Hearts\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984)\n!scope=\"col\"|Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n|16\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)\n|26\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon)\n|98\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|New Zealand Albums (RMNZ)\n|46\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Swiss Albums (Swiss Hitparade)\n|11\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Albums (OCC)\n|33\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
