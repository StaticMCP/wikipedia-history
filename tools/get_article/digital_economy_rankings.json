      "text": "# Digital economy rankings\n\nDigital economy rankings was published as a one-off exercise by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the follow-up to their previous e-readiness rankings. This was done to reflect the increasing influence of ICT in economic (and social)\nprogress. The report was titled \"Beyond e-readiness\".\n, the Economist has not published a follow-up to the 2010 report, leaving it substantially outdated. A much more comprehensive and up-to-date index is the UN's ICT Development Index.\nSee also\n* e-Government\n* ICT Development Index\nReferences"
