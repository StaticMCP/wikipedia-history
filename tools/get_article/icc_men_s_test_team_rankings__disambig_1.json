The rankings are based on international matches that are otherwise played as part of regular Test cricket scheduling, with no consideration of home or away status.\nAfter every Test series, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula involving both teams' previous rating and the result of the series. Each team's points total from matches over the last 3–4 years is divided by a figure based on their total number of matches and series played, to give a \"rating\".\nA drawn match between higher and lower rated teams will benefit the lower-rated team at the expense of the higher-rated team. An \"average\" team that wins as often as it loses, while playing a mix of stronger and weaker teams, will have a rating of 100.\nThe top ranked Test team was previously awarded the ICC Test Championship mace, until the inauguration of ICC World Test Championship. From 2003 to 2019, the mace was transferred whenever a new team moved to the top of the rating list. The team that was top of the ratings table on 1 April each year also won a cash prize.\nCurrent rankings\nHistorical rankings\nThe ICC provides ratings for the end of each month back to June 2003. Until the inauguration of the ICC World Test Championship in 2019, the team leading the ratings at any point were also awarded the Test Championship Mace. A cash prize was given to the team leading the Championship at the start of each April.\nThe teams that have successively held the highest rating since that date, by whole month periods are:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

However, from 2009, several teams (Australia, South Africa, India, England, New Zealand, and Pakistan) have competed for the top positions.\nThe ICC retrospectively applied the current rating system to results since 1952 (providing ratings for the end of each month from then). The table only begins then, as prior to 1952 there is insufficient data available due to the infrequency of matches and the small number of competing teams in these earlier periods.\nThe teams that have successively held the highest rating from January 1952 until May 2003, by whole month periods are:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Find the series points for each team\n* Award 1 point to a team for each match won.\n* Award  point to a team for each match drawn or tied.\n* Award 1 bonus point to the team winning the series.\n* Award  bonus point to each team if the series is drawn.\nStep 2. Convert these series points to actual ratings points\nIf the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the series was less than 40 points\nThe ratings points for each team equals:\n-->\n{|\n|-\n|''(The team's own series points) x (The opponent's rating + 50) + (The opponent's series points) x (The opponent's rating − 50)''\n|}\nAs each match won earns a team 1 series point and their opponent 0, losing earns them 0 series points and their opponent 1, and drawing earns both teams  series point, each match played therefore earns teams ratings points as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\"| Single match result\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\"| Ratings points earned\n|-\n| Win || Opponent's rating + 50\n|-\n| Draw or tie || Opponent's rating\n|-\n| Lose || Opponent's rating − 50\n|}\nAs this formula only applies when the gap between the ratings of the two teams at the start of the series was less than 40 points, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating they already had, and losing a match will always earn a team fewer rating points than the rating they already had. Drawing a match will earn the weaker team more rating points than the rating they already had, and the stronger team fewer.\nThe difference between winning and losing a single match is therefore 100 points. Also, whether the outcome of a match is a win & lose or a draw, the total rating points earned by the two teams from that match will be the sum of the two teams' ratings before the series began. The total rating points earned from a series will therefore equal the sum of the two teams' ratings before the series began multiplied by (the number of matches + 1).\nIf the gap between the ratings of the two teams before the series was at least 40 points\nThe ratings points for the stronger team equals:\n-->\n{|\n|-\n|''(The team's own series points) x (The team's own rating + 10) + (The opponent's series points) x (The team's own rating − 90)\n|}\nand the ratings points for the weaker team equals:\n-->\n{|\n|-\n|(The team's own series points) x (The team's own rating + 90) + (The opponent's series points) x (The team's own rating − 10).''\n|}\nAs above, each match played therefore earns teams ratings points as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\"| Single match result\n! style=\"background: #BFB6A3;\"| Ratings points earned\n|-\n| Stronger team wins || Own rating + 10\n|-\n| Weaker team loses || Own rating − 10\n|-\n| style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Stronger team draws or ties || style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Own rating − 40\n|-\n| Weaker team draws or ties || Own rating + 40\n|-\n| style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Stronger team loses || style=\"border-width:4px 1px 1px 1px;border-style:solid;border-color:pale grey\" | Own rating − 90\n|-\n| Weaker team wins || Own rating + 90\n|}\nTherefore, again, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating they already had, and losing a match will always earn a team fewer rating points than the rating they already had. Drawing a match will earn the weaker team more points than the rating they already had, and the stronger team fewer.\nFor both teams, the difference between winning and losing a single match is still 100 points. Also, whichever of the three outcomes happens, the total rating points earned by the two teams from that match will be the sum of the two teams' ratings before the series began.\nUpdate the ranking table\nFor each team:\n*Add the ratings points scored to their total ratings points already scored (in previous matches).\n*Update the number of matches played by adding the number of Series points available. This is one more than the number of games in the series, as there is an additional point available for the series winner (a two Test match series will result in the match count getting incremented by three).\n*Divide the new rating points total by the updated number of matches to get the updated Rating.\nExample\nSuppose two teams, initially with ratings of 120 and 90, play a 3-match series, and the team with the higher initial rating wins 2–1:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! width=\"50\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Team\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Ratings before the series\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | The series\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #ffdead;\" | Ratings after the series\n|-\n| width=\"60\" | Matches || width=\"60\" | Points || width=\"60\" | Rating || width=\"60\" | Matches won || width=\"60\" | Matches drawn || width=\"60\" | Series points || width=\"200\" | Ratings points || width=\"60\" | Matches || width=\"60\" | Points || width=\"60\" | Rating\n|-\n| A || 30 || 3600 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 120 || 2 || 0 || 3 || 3x(90+50) + 1x(90–50) = 460 || 30+3+1=34 || 3600+460=4060 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 119.4\n|-\n| B || 36 || 3240 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 90 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1x(120+50) + 3x(120–50) = 380 || 36+3+1=40 || 3240+380=3620 || style=\"background: #ACE1AF;\" | 90.5\n|}\n*The total Ratings points available from the series (460+380=840) is the same as the initial ratings of the teams multiplied by the number of Series points available ((120+90)x4=840).\n*The two teams' total ratings is almost exactly the same after the series (119.4+90.5=209.9) as before the series (120+90=210). The series has therefore not generated any extra ratings, but has just redistributed the ratings the two teams already had. When these ratings are published in the official table in their rounded form (119 and 91), the total ratings after the series will be exactly the same as before the series. There is therefore no points 'inflation' in this system, which means that comparisons of ratings over time are meaningful.\n*Despite winning the series, Team A's rating has reduced, and despite losing the series, Team B's rating has increased. If Team A had won the series 3–0 then its rating would have increased to 122.4.\nSee also\n*ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings\n*ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings\n*ICC Women's ODI and T20I rankings\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/test ICC Men's Test Team Rankings]"
