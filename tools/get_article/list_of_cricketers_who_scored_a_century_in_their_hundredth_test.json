Cowdrey was the first Test cricketer of any nationality to play 100 Test matches. Pakistan's Javed Miandad was the first batsman to have scored a century on Test debut as well as in their hundredth Test match; West Indian Gordon Greenidge is the only other cricketer to have achieved the feat. Greenidge also scored a century on his 100th One Day International appearance, making him one of two to have made a century in their hundredth ODI and hundredth Test match; he was joined by David Warner. Englishman Joe Root has the highest score in a hundredth Test match; he was the first player to have scored a double century (200 runs or more) in their hundredth Test match. Australian Ricky Ponting is the only player to have scored two centuries in their hundredth Test match; Ponting made scores of 120 and 143 not out against South Africa in Sydney in 2006. David Warner became only the second batsman to turn it into a double century, doing so in December 2022.\nAustralia, England, Pakistan and South Africa are the only teams to have had more than one different player score a century in their hundredth Test match. England have had three different players achieve this feat, the most of any country. The West Indies and Bangladesh are the only other teams to have had a player score a century in their hundredth match. No player has ever scored a century in their hundredth Test match and also been on the losing side.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n! scope=col | Symbol\n! scope=col | Meaning\n|-\n! scope=row | Runs\n| Number of runs scored by the batsman\n|-\n! scope=row | Inn\n| Innings in which the batsman made a century\n|-\n! scope=row | Date\n| Date on which the match started\n|}\nPlayers\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
