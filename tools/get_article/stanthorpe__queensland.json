In the , the locality of Stanthorpe had a population of 5,286 people.\nThe area surrounding the town is known as the Granite Belt.\nGeography\nStanthorpe lies on the New England Highway near the New South Wales border  from Brisbane via Warwick,  north of Tenterfield and 811m above sea level. The record low temperature of -10.6&nbsp;°C (12.9&nbsp;°F) was registered on June 23, 1961 in Stanthorpe. This is the lowest temperature recorded in Queensland.\nStanthorpe was developed around Quart Pot Creek which meanders from south-east through the centre of town and then out through the south-west, where its confluence with Spring Creek forms the Severn River. Quart Pot Creek forms part of the south-western boundary of the locality, while the Severn River forms part of the south-western boundary.\nThe New England Highway passes through the locality from Applethorpe in the north to Severnlea in the south. Originally it passed through the town centre along the main street, Maryland Street. However, it now bypasses to the west of the main developed area of the town. The Stanthorpe–Texas–Inglewood Road connects Stanthorpe and Broadwater to the west, then travels south-west to Texas.\nThe land within the boundaries of Stanthorpe is primarily used for urban purposes: housing, recreational, commercial and industrial with some undeveloped land on the hillier slopes. Although an agricultural centre of the Granite Belt, there is little agriculture within the town's boundaries. Crops grown in the surrounding area include vegetables, apples, grapes and stone fruit. Wine is also produced in the area, and sheep and cattle grazing is also prevalent.\nThe town lies in the valley of Quart Pot Creek and its tributary Funkers Gap Creek () at  above sea level.\nThe locality has the following mountains:\n* Lees Hill, south of the town ()\n* Mount Banca, north-west of the town ()\n* Mount Marlay, north-east of the town ()\nHistory\nPrior to British settlement, the Kambuwal were an Indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland. Norman Tindale estimated that the Kambuwal's territory stretched over . They straddled the border between Queensland and New South Wales, from south of Millmerran, and Inglewood to Bonshaw. Their eastern flank ended around Stanthorpe, Wallangarra and the western scarp of the Great Dividing Range.\nStanthorpe was founded by tin miners. People came from many countries to mine tin from 1872. Prior to 1872 this area boasted some large pastoral runs and a few prospectors in bark huts.  At that time, the area was known as 'Quart Pot Creek'. The Private Township of Stannum existed in the area along one side of the present main street. With the discovery of tin and the influx of miners and new businesses, a 'more suitable' name was sought by the town fathers. Thus, Stanthorpe became the name which encompassed all, as this area became for a time, the largest alluvial tin mining and mineral field in Queensland. Stanthorpe literally means 'tintown', as Stannum is Latin for 'tin' and thorpe is Middle English for 'village'. The Queensland Surveyor General, Augustus Charles Gregory, is credited with coining the name in 1872.\nWhen the tin prices fell, many miners turned to farming. The subtropical highland climate was very suitable for growing cool climate fruits and vegetables. Grapes were first planted here in the 1860s with encouragement from the local Catholic parish priest Father Jerome Davadi to produce altar wine. His Italian descent made grape growing and wine production a familiar pastime and the notion caught on in the area. There were plenty of Italian settlers and wine was made for home enjoyment.\nMount Marlay was named  after Edward Marlay, a selector and tin miner. On 3 July 1872 he purchased Allotment 1, Section 1  in the Town of Stanthorpe.\nIn July 1872, Presbyterian minister John McAra arrived in Stanthorpe and established a congregation.

However, they contracted the construction of post offices in Queensland to the Public Works Department of the Queensland Government and the Stanthorpe Post Office is believed to be one of the first ordered by the Commonwealth Government. It was designed by the first Commonwealth Government Architect John Smith Murdoch.\nThe cool dry climate was valued as an aid to health from the early nineteenth century especially for those suffering from tuberculosis or chest conditions. Following the First World War, Stanthorpe was a major resettlement area for soldiers recovering from mustard gas exposure. Many of these Soldier Settlers took up the land leased to them in the areas around Stanthorpe which now bear the names of First World War battlefields.\nStanthorpe State High School opened on 23 January 1961.\nThe Stanthorpe Regional Art Gallery was established in 1972.\nStanthorpe Adventist Primary School opened on 25 January 1982 and closed in 2002.\nThe Stanthorpe Library opened in 1987 with a major refurbishment in 2004.\nThe College of Wine Tourism was opened in 2007.\nDemographics\nIn the , the locality of Stanthorpe had a population of 5,406 people.\nIn the , the locality of Stanthorpe had a population of 5,286 people.\nHeritage listings\n]]\nStanthorpe has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* El Arish, 94 Greenup Street\n* Masel Residence, 98 High Street\n* Central Hotel, 140 High Street\n* Stanthorpe Post Office, 14 Maryland Street\n* Stanthorpe Soldiers Memorial, Lock Street\n* Quart Pot Creek Rail Bridge, Quart Pot Creek\n* Cherry Gully Tunnel, Warwick-Stanthorpe railway line\nEducation\nStanthorpe State School is a government primary (Early Childhood to Year 6) school for boys and girls at Marsh Street ().
