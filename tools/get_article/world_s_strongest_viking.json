It was held as a winter edition from 2014 to 2023, and as a summer edition from 2023 onwards, both with participation of top strongman athletes in the world. At the end of each edition, the winner is conferred with the title 'World's Strongest Viking'.\nHistory\nThe roots of the competition goes back to the Nordic Strongman Championships which was continued until 2013 with participation of athletes from Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark. In 2014, Giants Live upscaled it to global level, officially renaming the competition and the title to 'World's Strongest Viking'. In 2015, Strongman Champions League took over.\nDuring the initial nine editions, it was held under freezing and perilous weather conditions in winter at Vinstra, Norway, testing the athletes to their limits. The first nine editions also extensively featured vintage Viking events. Upon the introduction of summer format in 2023, the competition was shifted to the months of June to August and was held in Hämeenlinna and Joensuu in Finland.\nEvents\nAmong the most iconic events were Viking deadlift, Viking boat pull, Viking press, Viking ship mast super yoke, Hercules hold, power stairs and Atlas stones. The competitions were noted for their heavily wood crafted implements and replicating historical feats of strength. One of the most legendary moments of the competitions came in 2015 when Iceland's Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson surpassed the historical 1,000 years old Viking ship mast (Ormrinn langi) feat of strength by carrying a , 10 metres (33 ft) long,  circumference Viking ship mast on his back for 5 steps in −20&nbsp;°C weather.\nChampionship results\nWinter format (the competitions were also known by the names Giants Live Norway in 2014 and SCL Norway from 2015 to 2021).\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"display: inline-table\"\n!Year\n!Champion\n!Runner-up\n!3rd place\n!Location\n|-\n|2014\n| Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson\n| David Nyström\n| Terry Hollands\n|\n|-\n|2015\n| Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson\n| Krzysztof Radzikowski\n| Jean-François Caron\n|\n|-\n|2016\n| Jean-François Caron\n| Matjaz Belsak\n| Krzysztof Radzikowski\n|\n|-\n|2017\n| Jean-François Caron\n| Krzysztof Radzikowski\n| Luke Herrick\n|\n|-\n|2018\n| Krzysztof Radzikowski\n| Dennis Kohlruss\n| Luke Herrick\n|\n|-\n|2019\n| Krzysztof Radzikowski\n| Ole Martin Kristiansen\n| Mika Törrö\n|\n|-\n|2020\n| Sean O'Hagan\n| Aivars Šmaukstelis\n| Mika Törrö\n|\n|-\n|2021\n| Dainis Zageris\n| Kelvin de Ruiter\n| Henrik Hildeskor\n|\n|-\n|2023\n| Johan Espenkrona\n| Eric Dawson\n| Øyvind Gustavsen\n|\n|}\nSummer format\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"display: inline-table\"\n!Year\n!Champion\n!Runner-up\n!3rd place\n!Location\n|-\n|2023\n| Kane Francis\n| Ervin Toots\n| Sigfús Fossdal\n|\n|-\n|2025\n| Adam Roszkowski\n| Kevin Hazeleger\n| Jesper Hansson\n|\n|}\nSignature world records\n* Viking ship mast (Ormrinn langi) carry – , 10 m (33 ft) long, 1.41 m (4 ft 8 in) circumference log for 5 steps Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson (2015)\n* Viking boat pull (with the sails intact) –  harness only/ no rope for 25 meters 'in ice terrain' - 18.87 seconds Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson (2015)\n* Viking boat pull (with the sails intact) –  harness only/ no rope for 20 meters 'in ice terrain' - 16.12 seconds Mika Törrö (2019)\n* Viking boat pull (without the sails) – 3,000 kg (6,614 lb) harness only/ no rope for 25 meters 'in ice terrain' - 16.67 seconds Krzysztof Radzikowski (2017)\n* Viking press (for reps) –  x 19 reps Bjørn Andre Solvang (2017)\n* Viking sword front hold () – 1 minute 33.01 seconds David Nyström (2014)\n* Viking lumberjack tree-sledge pull –  harness only/ no rope for 24 meters 'in ice terrain' - 26.06 seconds Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson (2014)\n* Viking wheel of pain –  for  within a 60 seconds time limit 'in ice terrain' Øyvind Gustavsen (2023)\nReferences"
