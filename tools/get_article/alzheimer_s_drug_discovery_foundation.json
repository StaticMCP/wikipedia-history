Lauder and Ronald S. Lauder of the Estée Lauder Companies cosmetics family  and led by Howard Fillit, a geriatrician and neuroscientist. The ADDF provides funding to scientists who are conducting promising, innovative Alzheimer's disease drug research worldwide. The ADDF funds early-stage research and early-phase clinical trials that might otherwise go unfunded. By supporting research projects around the world, it seeks to increase the chances of finding treatments for Alzheimer's disease, related dementias and cognitive aging. The ADDF has invested nearly $65 million to fund some 450 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs and clinical trials in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 countries.\nFunding model\nThe ADDF is a biomedical venture philanthropy. Many of its grants are structured as investments, providing a return that is reinvested in new drug research. After initial ADDF funding, grantees have received commitments of over $2 billion in follow-on funding from government, pharmaceutical companies and venture capital firms to further advance drug research.\nADDF programs\nThrough its programs, the ADDF has invested close to $65 million to fund nearly 450 Alzheimer's drug discovery programs and clinical trials in academic centers and biotechnology companies in 18 countries. From 2000 to 2004, the ADDF provided seed funding for Amyvid, the first FDA-approved diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease. The ADDF also funded PrecivityAD, the first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.\nPartnership Programs\nThe ADDF partners with family foundations, government, non-profit organization, the pharmaceutical industry and corporate organizations to leverage collective funding power.\nScientific Conferences\nThe ADDF sponsors a number of scientific conferences, including the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s Disease (AD/PD), the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease conference (CTAD), and the World Dementia Council Summit. The ADDF also organizes advisory panels focused on key issues surrounding drug discovery and development for Alzheimer's.\nCognitive Vitality\nThe ADDF's microsite, Cognitive Vitality, provide evidence-based answers to pressing questions about healthy brain aging. Resources include:\n* Expert ratings of scientific evidence for and against suggested cognitive vitality strategies including: health management and drugs; nutrition and supplements; and environmental and physical considerations\n* Practical information on safety, efficacy and drug dosage\n* Digestible translations of scientific findings\nAwards\nMelvin R. Goodes Prize for Excellence in Drug Development\nThe Melvin R. Goodes Prize for Excellence in Drug Development, also known simply as the Goodes Prize, was first awarded in 2015. It is awarded annually by the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation for innovations in research that have made a significant and lasting impact in the Alzheimer’s field. Recipients receive an engraved medal and a monetary award of $150,000 to support their continued research in Alzheimer’s therapeutics, biomarkers, or prevention programs.\nThe award is named in honor of Melvin R. Goodes, a former Chairman and Chief Executive of Warner-Lambert. Goodes established the prize with his wife, Nancy, and in partnership with the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation after his own diagnosis with Alzheimer’s disease in 2009.\nGoodes prize recipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Recipient\n!Institution\n!Country\n!Research focus\n!Ref\n|-\n|2025\n|Daniel Skovronsky, MD, PhD\n|Eli Lilly\n|United  States\n|Dr. Skovronsky’s team developed the Amyvid PET scan, the first PET scan for Alzheimer’s disease, and helped bring the Alzheimer’s drug Kisunla to market.\n|\n|-\n|2024\n|Henrik Zetterberg, MD, PhD\n|University of Gothenburg\n|Sweden\n|Dr. Zetterberg is developing biomarkers and diagnostic tests for Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n|\n|-\n|2023\n|Rhoda Au, PhD, MBA\n|Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine\n|United  States\n|Dr. Au is utilizing new technologies to promote equitable science and to develop and validate passive, multimodal digital biomarkers.\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Miranda E.
