The Medal of Honor was created during the American Civil War and is the highest military decoration presented by the United States government to a member of its armed forces. The recipient must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an \"enemy of the United States\" or an \"opposing foreign force\". Due to the nature of this medal, it is commonly presented posthumously.\nWorld War II, or the Second World War, was a global military conflict, the joining of what had initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German and Soviet invasion of Poland. This global conflict split the majority of the world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers.\nThe United States was drawn into World War II on December 8, 1941, a day after the Axis-member Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Honolulu that killed almost 2,500 people in what was considered the biggest peacetime loss on American soil inflicted by foreign people at that time.\nFor actions during World War II, 472 United States military personnel received the Medal of Honor. Seventeen of these were Japanese-Americans fighting in both Europe and the Pacific, many of which were upgraded from Distinguished Service Crosses during the Clinton administration. Additionally, Douglas Albert Munro was the only serviceman from the United States Coast Guard in United States military history to receive the Medal for his actions during the war.\nThe earliest action for which a U.S. serviceman earned a World War II Medal of Honor was the attack on Pearl Harbor, for which 17 U.S. servicemen were awarded a Medal, although they did so \"while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force\" rather than \"enemy\" since the United States was neutral during the events of December 7, 1941. The last action to earn a contemporaneous Medal of Honor prior to the August 15, 1945, end of hostilities in World War II, were those of Melvin Mayfield, on July 29, 1945 – though several honorees may have been cited for their Medal after Mayfield's recognition on May 31, 1946. Additionally, seven African-American and twenty-two Asian-American soldiers who had received the Distinguished Service Cross during the war were awarded the Medal of Honor in 1997 and 2000 – most of them posthumously – after two studies determined that racial discrimination had caused them to be overlooked at the time.\nA\n, indicates that the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Image !!

Several days later, he single-handedly attacked and killed two groups of Japanese soldiers. On July 7, Baker's position came under attack by a large Japanese force. Although seriously wounded early in the attack, he refused to be evacuated and continued to fight in the close-range battle until running out of ammunition. When a comrade was wounded while trying to carry him to safety, Baker insisted that he be left behind. At his request, his comrades left him propped against a tree and gave him a M1911 pistol, which had eight bullets remaining. When American forces retook the position, they found the pistol, now empty, and eight dead Japanese soldiers around Baker's body.\n|-\n|\n| }}\n|\n| near Viareggio, Italy\n| }}&nbsp;– }}\n| Demonstrated outstanding courage and leadership in destroying enemy installations, personnel and equipment during his company's attack against a strongly entrenched enemy in mountainous terrain. One of seven African-American soldiers who received their medals belatedly, after a 1993 study revealed discrimination that caused them to be overlooked at the time.\n|-\n|\n| }}\n|\n| near Carano, Italy\n| }}\n|\"With his platoon heavily engaged during an assault against forces well entrenched on commanding ground, 2d Lt. Barfoot (then Tech. Sgt.) moved off alone upon the enemy left flank. He crawled to the proximity of 1 machine gun nest and made a direct hit on it with a hand grenade, killing 2 and wounding 3 Germans. He continued along the German defense line to another machine gun emplacement, and with his tommygun killed 2 and captured 3 soldiers. Members of another enemy machine gun crew then abandoned their position and gave themselves up to Sgt. Barfoot. Leaving the prisoners for his support squad to pick up, he proceeded to mop up positions in the immediate area, capturing more prisoners and bringing his total count to 17. Later that day, after he had reorganized his men and consolidated the newly captured ground, the enemy launched a fierce armored counterattack directly at his platoon positions. Securing a bazooka, Sgt. Barfoot took up an exposed position directly in front of 3 advancing Mark VI tanks. From a distance of 75 yards his first shot destroyed the track of the leading tank, effectively disabling it, while the other 2 changed direction toward the flank. As the crew of the disabled tank dismounted, Sgt. Barfoot killed 3 of them with his tommygun. He continued onward into enemy terrain and destroyed a recently abandoned German fieldpiece with a demolition charge placed in the breech. While returning to his platoon position, Sgt. Barfoot, though greatly fatigued by his Herculean efforts, assisted 2 of his seriously wounded men 1,700 yards to a position of safety. Sgt. Barfoot's extraordinary heroism, demonstration of magnificent valor, and aggressive determination in the face of pointblank fire are a perpetual inspiration to his fellow soldiers.\"\n|-\n|\n| }}\n|\n| near St. Laurent-sur-Mer, France\n| }}\n| Joined the United States Army in Albany, New York, he was a member of, 18th Infantry, 1st Infantry Division.

The Japanese forces began a frontal attack using machine guns, grenades and mortars against the American heavy machine guns. Basilone commanded two sections of machine guns that fought for the next 48 hours until only Basilone and two other men were still able to continue fighting. Basilone moved an extra gun into position and maintained continual fire against the incoming Japanese forces. He repaired another machine-gun and personally manned it, holding the defensive line until replacements arrived. With the continuous fighting, ammunition became critically low and supply lines were cut off. Basilone fought through hostile lines and returned with urgently needed ammunition for his gunners. He was killed on Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945. He was the first Enlisted Marine to receive The Medal of Honor, Purple Heart, and Navy Cross.\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n|\n| South Pacific area\n| }}&nbsp;– }}\n| For extraordinary heroism and conspicuous courage as Squadron Commander of Marine Fighting Squadron TWO TWELVE in the South Pacific Area during the period May 10 to November 14, 1942.\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n|\n| Peleliu Island, Palau Group\n| }}\n| During combat at Peleliu, he covered an exploding Japanese hand grenade in order to protect his comrades, and died of his wounds three days later.

When evacuation became necessary, he voluntarily stayed behind to cover the withdrawal. The next morning he moved to another command post, and again defended it against a continued assault by strong German forces and voluntarily covered the withdrawal of friendly forces when the post was abandoned. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor one year later, on January 10, 1946.\n|-\n|\n| }}\n|\n| near Arloncourt, Belgium\n| }}\n| Near Arloncourt, Belgium, he used hand grenades and his carbine to single-handedly destroy two German machine gun positions before working his way through a honey-combed series of enemy foxholes—killing and capturing German soldiers as he went. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry Truman seven months later, on August 30, 1945.\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n|\n| near Bagac, Bataan Province, Philippines\n| }}\n| After the action near Bagac in the Bataan Province, Bianchi was among the troops captured by the Japanese at the fall of Bataan, on April 9, 1942. He was part of the Bataan \"Death March,\" and was imprisoned in several Japanese prisoner of war camps, enduring horrible conditions. He was known for his compassion and efforts to better the lot of his fellow prisoners by bartering with their captors for extra food and medicine. On January 9, 1945, while imprisoned in an unmarked Japanese prison ship, Bianchi was killed instantly when an American plane, unaware that the ship contained American prisoners, dropped a 1,000-pound bomb in the cargo hold.\n|-\n|\n| }}\n|\n| near Soy, Belgium\n| }}&nbsp;– }}\n| When presenting the medal to Biddle, Truman whispered \"People don't believe me when I tell them that I'd rather have one of these than be President.\" Biddle was decorated with 17 other soldiers that served in the Eastern Theater of Operations.\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n| Navy\n|\n| USS Fletcher, off Corregidor Island, Philippines\n| }}\n| While assisting minesweeping operations prior to landings on Manila Bay's Corregidor Island, Fletcher was hit by an enemy shell penetrated the No. 1 gun magazine, igniting several powder cases. Bigelow picked up a pair of fire extinguishers and rushed below in a resolute attempt to quell the raging flames. Refusing to waste the precious time required to don rescue-breathing apparatus, Bigelow plunged through the blinding smoke billowing out of the magazine hatch and dropped into the blazing compartment. Despite the acrid, burning powder smoke which seared his lungs, he succeeded in quickly extinguishing the fires and in cooling the cases and bulkheads, thereby preventing further damage to the ship. However Bigelow was badly injured and succumbed to his injuries the following day.\n|-\n|\n| }}\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Army\n|\n| near Altavilla, Italy\n| }}\n| Near Altavilla, Italy, he single-handedly attacked and destroyed two German machine gun emplacements and a mortar position.\n|-\n|\n| }}\n|\n| near Firenzuola, Italy\n| }}\n| Near Firenzuola, Italy, he led three soldiers in an attack on enemy positions which resulted in the capture of nineteen prisoners and the silencing of five machine gun nests.\n|-\n|\n| }}\n|\n| Petit-Coo, Belgium\n| }}\n| While his comrade provided covering fire from across the street, Bolden tossed grenades through a window, rushed to the door, and began firing.

Christensen repeatedly distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry above and beyond the call of duty in the continuous heavy fighting which occurred in this area from 16 – July 19,. On July 16, his platoon engaged in a savage fire fight in which much damage was caused by 1 enemy machine gun effectively placed. 2d Lt. Christensen ordered his men to remain under cover, crept forward under fire, and at a range of 15 yards put the gun out of action with hand grenades. Again, on July 19, while attacking an enemy position strong in mortars and machine guns, his platoon was pinned to the ground by intense fire. Ordering his men to remain under cover, he crept forward alone to locate definitely the enemy automatic weapons and the best direction from which to attack. Although his rifle was struck by enemy fire and knocked from his hands he continued his reconnaissance, located 5 enemy machine guns, destroyed 1 with hand grenades, and rejoined his platoon. He then led his men to the point selected for launching the attack and, calling encouragement, led the charge. This assault was successful and the enemy was driven from the positions with a loss of 4 mortars and 10 machine guns and leaving many dead on the field. On August 4, 1944, near Afua, Dutch New Guinea, 2d Lt. Christensen was killed in action about 2 yards from his objective while leading his platoon in an attack on an enemy machine gun position. 2d Lt.

They ran into an enemy force in the woods estimated to be an infantry company. T/Sgt. Coolidge, attempting to bluff the Germans by a show of assurance and boldness called upon them to surrender, whereupon the enemy opened fire. With his carbine, T/Sgt. Coolidge wounded 2 of them. There being no officer present with the force, T/Sgt. Coolidge at once assumed command. Many of the men were replacements recently arrived; this was their first experience under fire. T/Sgt. Coolidge, unmindful of the enemy fire delivered at close range, walked along the position, calming and encouraging his men and directing their fire. The attack was thrown back. Through 25 and October 26, the enemy launched repeated attacks against the position of this combat group but each was repulsed due to T/Sgt. Coolidge's able leadership. On October 27, German infantry, supported by 2 tanks, made a determined attack on the position. The area was swept by enemy small arms, machine gun, and tank fire. T/Sgt. Coolidge armed himself with a bazooka and advanced to within 25 yards of the tanks. His bazooka failed to function and he threw it aside. Securing all the hand grenades he could carry, he crawled forward and inflicted heavy casualties on the advancing enemy. Finally it became apparent that the enemy, in greatly superior force, supported by tanks, would overrun the position. T/Sgt. Coolidge, displaying great coolness and courage, directed and conducted an orderly withdrawal, being himself the last to leave the position. As a result of T/Sgt. Coolidge's heroic and superior leadership, the mission of this combat group was accomplished throughout 4 days of continuous fighting against numerically superior enemy troops in rain and cold and amid dense woods.\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n| Marine Corps\n|\n| Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands\n| }}&nbsp;– }}\n|For leading his battalion in a successful night attack up a fiercely defended hill, personally killing many Japanese before he himself was killed.\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Army\n|\n| near Krinkelter Wald, Belgium\n| }}\n|\n|-\n|\n| }}\n|\n| Hen Hill, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands\n| }}\n|\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n|\n| near Favoratta, Sicily\n| }}\n| Single-handedly located and destroyed an Italian machine gun nest; then, when encountering superior enemy forces, ultimately chose to sacrifice himself by laying down covering fire for his entire platoon to retreat to safety.\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n|\n| Haguenau, France\n| }}\n| When a house defended by some of his men came under intense attack from German soldiers and a tank, he ordered the men to withdraw while he held the position alone.

His courageous actions inspired similar attacks from other destroyers in the task unit, prompting the task unit commander, Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, to order all destroyers in the task unit to break formation and attack. When enemy shellfire obliterated the bridge of his ship, Commander Evans shifted his command to the fantail, steering the ship by giving orders through an open hatch to men turning the rudder by hand. Despite suffering the severe mutilation of his left hand early in the attack and being covered in blood from his wounds, he continued to outmaneuver and outgun the opposing force in what amounted to almost three hours of combat. The attacking Japanese force was ultimately driven into retreat, preventing a deadly assault on the Army landing forces at Leyte. His ship eventually sank from the battle damage and the remaining survivors endured over 70 hours in shark-infested waters.

About eighty Germans advanced under the cover of an artillery barrage in the darkness and were within about 200 yards of the platoon's positions when they were discovered by Johnston who was at his gun. He manned his machine gun and the attack was halted. All during the day, without relief, he remained with his weapon and fired at every target that presented itself. One German worked up the draw so close to the position that the machine gun could not be brought to bear upon him. Johnston drew his pistol and killed him. As the day wore on, it became evident that if the Company was to escape it would have to begin its movement. Not everyone could get out. Johnson volunteered to stay. Afterwards an artillery shell made what almost amounted to a direct hit on Johnston's position and shell fragments penetrated into the left portion of his chest. An examination indicated that he was dying. The rapid advance of large numbers of the Germans prevented any evacuation. A few minutes later one of the last men to withdraw saw Johnston trying to crawl up to his machine gun. At Johnston's request he was helped to his gun and left believing that he was dying. A few minutes later the Company heard the machine gun in action. It continued to fire for about 10 minutes. Afterwards the gun went silent. The Germans passed him as he lay in his position, and, believing him to be dead, stole his shoes. The next day, he painfully worked his way through the German lines to the 180th Regiment, after having been reported by the Company as killed in action. Despite his weakened condition, he gave accurate and vital information about the German positions on the base of which effective firing that was compiled.\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\" | }}\n| Navy\n|\n| Pearl Harbor, Hawaii\n| }}\n|Organized and led a party to supply ammunition to the antiaircraft battery of USS California after the mechanical hoists were put out of action when he was fatally wounded by a bomb explosion.

Boxed in by blazing tankers, a freighter, transport, and several destroyers, he blasted two of the targets and cleared the area. Twenty-four hours later, he made contact with another heavily escorted convoy. In the midst of relentless enemy fire, he sent two torpedoes into the first and second transports and an adjacent tanker. He charged the enemy at high speed, exploding the tanker in a burst of flame, smashing the transport dead in the water, and blasting the destroyer. He fired his last two torpedoes at the remnants of the convoy before the second torpedo malfunctioned, performing a circular run and hitting the Tang in the stern.

The strong point objective had previously received, firstly, a barrage from an allied cruiser off the Normandy coast, before heavy artillery and tank fire – all to no avail. It was after this that Sgt Peregory made his way up the hill (strong point approach), under heavy fire.  He successfully negotiated the hill approach and entered a trench killing eight enemy and capturing three.  After passing the prisoners onto command, he re-entered the trench at a point further along towards the strong point.  According to witnesses in Peregory's company, after considerable time, Sgt Peregory eventually reappeared from out of the trenches with thirty-two German prisoners.  Fellow soldiers who witnessed Sgt Peregory's actions, state that he had used hand grenades in the incursion (having no rifle or handgun on his person), before the remaining Germans surrendered.  The 116th Infantry (of which Sgt Peregory was contingent), was reassigned two days after actions at Grandcampe-les-Bains, on the 13th June.  The following day, Sgt Peregory assaulted an enemy machine gun position and was killed in action.

Volunteering for a perilous mission unsuccessfully attempted by the pilot's squadron mates and a PBY plane, Lt. Comdr. (then Lieutenant) Preston led PT-489 and PT-363 through 60 miles of restricted, heavily mined waters. Twice turned back while running the gauntlet of fire from powerful coastal defense guns guarding the 11-mile strait at the entrance to the bay, he was again turned back by furious fire in the immediate area of the downed airman. Aided by an aircraft smoke screen, he finally succeeded in reaching his objective and, under vicious fire delivered at 150-yard range, took the pilot aboard and cleared the area, sinking a small hostile cargo vessel with 40-mm. fire during retirement. Increasingly vulnerable when covering aircraft were forced to leave because of insufficient fuel, Lt. Comdr. Preston raced PT boats 489 and 363 at high speed for 20 minutes through shell-splashed water and across minefields to safety. Under continuous fire for  hours, Lt. Comdr. Preston successfully achieved a mission considered suicidal in its tremendous hazards, and brought his boats through without personnel casualties and with but superficial damage from shrapnel.

On his own initiative, he left the platoon, accompanied by a comrade, and continued forward to a house 60 yards from the objective.\nAlthough under constant enemy observation, the two men remained in this position for an hour, firing at targets of opportunity, killing more than 35 Japanese and wounding many more. Moving closer to the station and discovering a group of Japanese replacements attempting to reach pillboxes, they opened heavy fire, killed more than 40 and stopped all subsequent attempts to man the emplacements. Enemy fire became more intense as they advanced to within 20 yards of the station. From that point Pfc. Reese provided effective covering fire and courageously drew enemy fire to himself while his companion killed seven Japanese and destroyed a 20-mm. gun and heavy machine gun with hand grenades. With their ammunition running low, the two men started to return to the American lines, alternately providing covering fire for each other as they withdrew. During this movement, Pfc. Reese was killed by enemy fire as he reloaded his rifle.

Caught in his own bomb blast, Commander Van Voorhis crashed into the lagoon off the beach, sacrificing himself in a single-handed fight against almost insuperable odds, to make a distinctive contribution to our continued offensive in driving the Japanese from the Solomons and, by his superb daring, courage and resoluteness of purpose, enhanced the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.

He was the highest ranking U.S. officer in captivity during his three years as a prisoner of war. The general would witness the surrender of the Japanese forces aboard the USS Missouri that brought about the end of the war. Wainwright was nominated for the Medal of Honor early in his captivity, but it was rejected due to the opposition of General Douglas MacArthur, who felt that Corregidor should not have been surrendered.
