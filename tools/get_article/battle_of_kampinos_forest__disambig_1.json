They were withdrawing through the large forest complex towards Warsaw and the Modlin Fortress.\nThe route was adopted by the  Pomorze Army, under Gen. Władysław Bortnowski, the Poznań Army, under Gen. Tadeusz Kutrzeba. At the same time the German Wehrmacht tried to cut the Polish forces out by assaulting the forests both from the north and from the south.\nSee also\n* List of World War II military equipment of Poland\n* List of German military equipment of World War II\nReferences"
