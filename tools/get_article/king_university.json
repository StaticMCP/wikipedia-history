Founded in 1867, King is independently governed with covenant affiliations to the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC).\nHistory\nIn April 1866, the Holston Presbytery assembled at the old Pleasant Grove Church in Bristol, Tenn., to establish a Christian college. The college was built on  of land in Bristol that had been donated by Reverend James King, in whose honor it is named.  The first classes were offered in August 1867.\nWhen the college outgrew its small campus, King's grandson Isaac Anderson donated land on a hillside east of Bristol and in 1917, the college moved to its present location.\nIn January 2013, King College announced that it would change its name to King University. The name change reflects the master's-level, comprehensive benchmark that King has reached in recent years.  Becoming a university was the natural unfolding of King's strategic plan, unveiled in 1998, to create an even broader mix of programs based on a university model. On June 1, 2013, King College officially became King University.\nIn December 2013, King University was granted a Level V designation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), after a two-year application and review process. As a result, King University began its first doctoral program, a Doctorate of Nursing Practice, in the Fall 2014.\nCampus\nThe King University campus is located on  approximately  from downtown Bristol, Tennessee.
