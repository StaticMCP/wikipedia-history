Eleonore was considered a cultivated woman, and her and her husband's wealthy and cultured lifestyle was often displayed at court. The marriage produced two children:\n* Maria Anna of Schwarzenberg (1706–1755); married Louis George, Margrave of Baden-Baden in 1721.\n* Joseph I Adam of Schwarzenberg (1722–1782); married Princess Maria Theresia of Liechtenstein (1721–1753) in 1741.\nAfter 31 years of marriage her husband was killed in a hunting accident on imperial land near Brandýs nad Labem-Stará Boleslav, today in the Czech Republic. Emperor Charles VI fired the deadly shot, and the prince just happened to be in the way. Afterwards, the emperor took Eleonore's son to his court in Vienna, and she was paid a baronial maintenance of 5,000 guldens.\nPrincess Eleonore died on 5 May 1741 in the Palais Schwarzenberg in Vienna. Franz von Gersdorf, the emperor's physician, requested an autopsy from which the cause of death has been diagnosed as cervical cancer.\nLegacy\nThe 2007 Austrian documentary The Vampire Princess features Eleonore as the supposed inspiration for Gottfried August Bürger's work Lenore (ballad).\nEleonora’s dramatic maelstroms are researched and interpreted in the historical novel ‘The Case of Princess Schwarzenberg 1757’ by Martina Grenze.\nStyles\n* 20 June 1682 – 6 December 1701: Her Serene Highness Princess Eleonore of Lobkowicz\n* 6 December 1701 – 1703: Her Serene Highness The Hereditary Princess of Schwarzenberg\n* 1703 – 1732: Her Serene Highness The Princess of Schwarzenberg\n* 1732 – 5 May 1741: Her Serene Highness The Princess Dowager of Schwarzenberg\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://archduchessinvestigates.com The Case of Princess Schwarzenberg 1757]"
