They were based at Pring depot near Bowen, and were a standard General Electric export model (similar locomotives were also used in Brazil, Nigeria and Tunisia). Between July 2000 and May 2001, all 13 were rebuilt by A Goninan & Co with cab extensions (the stock GE cab was replaced with the standard Queensland Rail \"maxicab\"). Their weight increased to . They were then placed in service on the Mount Isa line.\nAll were withdrawn in 2011 and in May 2012 exported to South Africa with seven going to African Rail & Traction Services and six to RRL Grindrod.\nReferences"
