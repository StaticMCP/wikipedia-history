It is the first British television drama series to have a predominantly East Asian cast.\nVery loosely inspired by ancient Chinese myths and legends, the show follows Bo, her sister Jen, and fellow schoolchildren Vicky, Trix and Martin who, during a trip to a museum, are transported to a parallel spirit world. Once there, they find themselves transformed into Spirit Warriors, each with his or her own special spirit power. With the help of their mentor Shen, a dragon, they have to use their new-found skills to navigate the realms of Wood, Water, Earth and Fire and find twelve legendary spirit pieces before the evil warlord Li and his henchman Hwang can get their hands on them.\nThe series was created and written by Jo Ho and produced by Nick Pitt. The working title was Bo and the Spirit World. Jon East, who had previously won a BAFTA for the children's docu-drama That Summer Day, was the executive producer, and directed half of the episodes including the start and end of the series. Episodes 4 to 8 were directed by the Australian director Mat King.\nThe show has been picked up internationally by Norway, South Korea, New Zealand and Singapore.\nCast\nThe BBC initially sought two young British Chinese or other East Asian actors to play Bo and her brother Timothy, characters aged 13 and 11. The role of Timothy was later changed to female, and it was announced in June 2009 that 16-year-old Jessica Henwick had been cast as Bo. Within the next month, announcements were made about the rest of the cast, including Alicia Lai in the role of the younger sister Jen.\n* Bo played by Jessica Henwick\n* Shen voiced by Burt Kwouk\n* Jen played by Alicia Lai\n* Vicky played by Little Simz\n* Trix played by Gilles Geary\n* Martin played by Karl Rogers\n* Li played by Benedict Wong\n* Hwang played by Tom Wu\n* Fei-Yan played by Daphne Cheung\n* Ding-Xiang played by David Yip\n* Qi-Shi played by Andy Cheung\nEpisodes\nThe first episode premiered on the CBBC channel on Friday 22 January 2010 at 5:45pm, titled \"A Warrior is Born\".\nFollowing the transmission of the final episode, a backstage documentary exclusive called Spirit Warriors: Backstage aired on 26 March, which included cast interviews and footage from behind the scenes.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #FF80C0;\"| # !! style=\"background-color: #FF80C0;\"| Title !! style=\"background-color: #FF80C0;\"| Director !! style=\"background-color: #FF80C0;\"| Writer(s)!! style=\"background-color: #FF80C0;\"| Airdate !! style=\"background-color: #FF80C0;\"| Code\n|WrittenBy=Jo Ho\n|DirectedBy=Jon East\n|ProdCode=101\n|ShortSummary=After Bo's mother Fei-Yan is discovered mysteriously injured, Bo and her younger sister Jen are sent on a school trip to attend an exhibition of ancient Chinese warriors.

I feel like holding a party to celebrate. Watching Spirit Warriors is like finally meeting a friend who's ten years late for a party – you're disappointed that they've taken so long but once here you can't help smiling. For truth be told a drama starring East Asian actors as the leads has been long overdue... the BBC have obviously pushed the boat out and got fully behind this series which is great to see.\"\n* From the \"Observer\" review of the first episode:\n\"...clever new fantasy drama for children which includes \"Crouching Tiger\"-style martial arts with CGI characters and live action\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
