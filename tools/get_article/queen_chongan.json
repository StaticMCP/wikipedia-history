She was queen consort of Joseon from 1398 and was honoured as Queen Tŏk () until her husband's abdication in 1400 after which she was honoured as Queen Dowager Sundŏk ().\nBiography\nEarly life\nLady Kim was born during King Gongmin of Goyreo's 4th year of reign on 30 January 1355 into the Gyeongju Kim clan as the eldest daughter of Kim Ch'ŏnsŏ and Lady Yi of the Damyang Lee clan. Lady Kim had two older brothers and five younger siblings.\nLady Kim is descended from the Silla Dynasty's Gyeongju Kim clan. During the reign of King Shinjong of Goryeo, her grandfather, Kim Pongmo (; ?–1209), served as P'yŏngjangsa () and received the posthumous title of Chŏngp'yŏng (). He later established the P'yŏngjangsa Branch () of the clan.\nThrough her 6th great-grandfather, Lady Kim was a 12th great-granddaughter of King Gyeongsun of Silla and Princess Nakrang through their second son, Kim Ŭnyŏl. She and Queen Jeongsun are distantly related as they share Kim Chŏnggu (; 973–1057) as their last common ancestor, and was also the grandson of Kim Ŭnyŏl.\nThrough her great-great-grandmother, Lady Kim was a fourth cousin twice removed of Queen Wŏn'gyŏng as they shared Min Yŏngmo as their ancestor, and would eventually become her sister-in-law through marriage.\nIt is unknown what year she married Yi Panggwa, the second son of Yi Seong-gye and Lady Han.\nRoyal life\nIn 1398, at the age of 42-43, she became Crown Princess Consort Tŏk when her husband, Prince Yŏngan (the future King Jeongjong), became Crown Prince. Her father was given the royal title of \"Internal Prince Wŏlsŏng, Kim Ch'ŏnsŏ\" (), and her mother was given the royal title of \"Internal Princess Consort Samhanguk of the Damyang Lee clan\" ().\nShe was then referred as \"Queen Consort Tŏk\" () from the 5 September 1398 until her husband's abdication.\nIn the aftermath of the , when her husband abdicated in favor of his younger brother, Prince Chŏngan on 28 November 1400, along with him being bestowed the courtesy title of \"King Emeritus Inmungongye\" (), she was bestowed the courtesy title of \"Queen Dowager Sundŏk\" () by her royal brother-in-law.\nDeath and posthumous title\nQueen Tŏk later died on 11 August 1412 during her brother-in-law's, King Taejong, reign. Her husband outlived her by seven years and both are buried within Hureung in Yeongjeong-ri, Kaepung County, North Hwanghae Province, North Korea. She had no issue with King Jeongjong.\nShe was given the posthumous title of Queen Chŏngan () after her death, but was also given another lesser-known posthumous title \"Queen Anjŏng\" () during King Yeonsan's 10th year of reign and King Gwanghae's 1st year of reign.\nIn 1681, 270 years after her death, King Sukjong added Onmyŏngjangŭi () to her posthumous title.\nFamily\nParent\n* Father — Kim Ch'ŏnsŏ ()\n* Mother — Internal Princess Consort Samhanguk of the Damyang Lee clan ()\nSibling\n* Older brother — Kim Sŏkjun (; 1336–?)\n* Older brother — Kim Su, Prince Wolseong, Duke Jeongho (; 1338–1409)\n* Younger brother — Kim Samwŏn (; 1357–?)\n* Younger sister — Lady Kim of the Gyeongju Kim clan (; 1359–?)\n* Younger brother - Kim Ŭiyŏl (; 1360–?)\n* Younger sister — Lady Kim of the Gyeongju Kim clan (; 1361–?)\n* Younger sister — Lady Kim of the Gyeongju Kim clan (; 1382–?)\nConsort\n* Husband — King Jeongjong of Joseon (; 18 July 1357 – 15 October 1419) — No issue.\nIn popular culture\n* Portrayed by Kim Hae-sook in the 1983 MBC TV series The King of Chudong Palace.\n* Portrayed by Park Yun-seon in the 1996–1998 KBS TV series Tears of the Dragon.\n* Portrayed by Kim Seo-yeon in the 2021–2022 KBS TV series The King of Tears, Lee Bang-won\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n}}\n}}\n}}"
