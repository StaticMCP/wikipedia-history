This article gives events year by year and serves as an index to the linked articles. It includes the Bahamas and the Guyana coast since they are closely related to the Caribbean. It also includes events outside the Caribbean and before 1600 when they are needed to understand Caribbean history. Events in Spanish America are excluded since the article is mainly a history of the arrival on the non-Spanish powers.\nOutline: In the sixteenth century Spain built a land empire in the new world, while Portugal built a sea empire in the Indian Ocean and along the Brazilian coast. In the seventeenth century the Dutch, French and English built empires of their own. Although Spain claimed the whole new world except Brazil, by 1600 they had not occupied the Guyanas, the Lesser Antilles, the Bahamas, or the North American coast except Florida. These were the areas taken by the non-Spanish in the seventeenth century.  After around 1650, the introduction of sugar and slavery made the Lesser Antilles immensely profitable. The Spanish did little to block the non-Iberians. (see list at bottom) The Dutch had the most advanced economy and were everywhere engaged in legal and illegal trade. Their trade built up the French and English colonies so that by 1700 they were stronger than the Dutch. The main English base was Barbados, while the French were centered in Martinique and Guadeloupe. Many islands were settled from Anglo-French St Kitts. Most places were taken in the period 1621-1655. The last islands taken were the Carib islands of Dominica in 1690 and St Vincent in 1719. Along the coasts there were various pirates, buccaneers, castaways, temporary settlements and adventurers who left few records. These were often at a place before its official foundation. In wartime the numerous pirates became privateers.\nBefore 1600\n}}\n*1492: Columbus in the Caribbean\n*1521: Spanish take Mexico\n*1532: Spanish take Peru\n*1555: some French pirates in the Caribbean (early Caribbean piracy not well documented)\n*1562: Sir John Hawkins sells slaves in the Caribbean\n*1565: Spanish expel French from Florida.\n*1568-1648: '''Eighty Years' War Dutch secede from Spain\n*1580: Spanish-Portuguese Iberian Union until 1640 makes Portuguese colonies fair game for Dutch.

These were the areas taken by the non-Spanish in the seventeenth century. The only changes in European-occupied areas were Jamaica (English from Spanish in 1655) and \"Dutch Guyana\" (Dutch from English in 1667). During the Second Anglo-Dutch War there were a number of temporary changes. In the next century the English took many places from the French and Dutch. The small places on the Guyana coast and Tobago changed hands so many times that a list would be impractical.\nSpanish counterattacks:\nThe few Spanish attempts to drive out the foreigners were ineffectual. Most were directed at places that came too close to Spanish settlememts. This list excludes minor actions and may be incomplete. 1605: Dutch expelled from the Araya salt pans. 1629: St Kitts raided. 1629: English and French expelled from Tortola. 1633: Dutch expelled from Anguilla after 2 years. 1641: Providence Island retaken from English. 1633: St Martin, an important source of salt, was occupied until 1648. 1647: Spanish raid Tortola near Puerto Rico (also 1640,1646). 1650: Saint Croix, V. I.: force from Puerto Rico expels English. 1684:Spanish raid Bahamas.\nCompanies:''' The large national companies managed most of the slave trade and sometimes ruled some of the islands.
