Alaska was the only state where neurosurgeon Ben Carson carried a jurisdiction over the course of the primary, albeit one of the country's least populated.\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:180px;\" |Poll source\n! style=\"width:135px;\" |Date\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |1st\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |2nd\n! style=\"width:100px;\" |3rd\n!Other\n|-\n|- style=\"background:Moccasin;\"\n|Caucus results\n|March 1, 2016\n|Ted Cruz 36.37%\n|Donald Trump 33.64%\n|Marco Rubio 15.16%\n|Ben Carson 10.83%, John Kasich 3.99%, Other 0.01%\n|-\n|Alaska Dispatch News/Ivan Moore Research\nMargin of error: –\nSample size: 651\n|January 23, 2016\n|  |Donald Trump27.9%\n|Ted Cruz\n23.8%\n|Ben Carson\n8.5%\n|Jeb Bush 7.3%, Marco Rubio 6.9%, Chris Christie 3.3%, Rand Paul 3.0%, John Kasich 1.7%, Other 4.1%, Undecided 13.4%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ± 5.3%\nSample size: 337\n|July 31 – August 3, 2014\n|  |Ted Cruz16%\n|  |Rand Paul15%\n|  |Mike Huckabee14%\n|Chris Christie 12%, Jeb Bush 12%, Sarah Palin 11%, Scott Walker 7%, Paul Ryan 6%, Marco Rubio 5%, Someone else/Not sure 4%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ± 5.5%\nSample size: 313\n| rowspan=\"2\" |May 8–11, 2014\n|  |Ted Cruz15%\n|  |Jeb Bush14%\n|  |Chris Christie14%\n|Sarah Palin 12%, Rand Paul 11%, Mike Huckabee 11%, Paul Ryan 4%, Scott Walker 4%, Marco Rubio 3%, Someone else/Not sure 11%\n|-\n|  |Chris Christie16%\n|  |Jeb Bush15%\n|  |Ted Cruz15%\n|Rand Paul 14%, Mike Huckabee 10%, Paul Ryan 5%, Scott Walker 5%, Marco Rubio 4%, Someone else/Not sure 16%\n|-\n|Magellan Strategies\nMargin of error: ± 7%\nSample size: 190\n|April 14, 2014\n|  |Ted Cruz16%\n|  |Rand Paul15%\n|  |Jeb Bush13%\n|Mike Huckabee 12%, Chris Christie 11%, Marco Rubio 7%, Scott Walker 6%, John Kasich 1%, Undecided 19%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ± 4.7%\nSample size: 442\n| rowspan=\"2\" |January 30 – February 1, 2014\n|  |Rand Paul15%\n|  |Ted Cruz13%\n|  |Sarah Palin13%\n|Jeb Bush 12%, Mike Huckabee 11%, Chris Christie 10%, Marco Rubio 6%, Paul Ryan 4%, Scott Walker 4%, Someone Else/Undecided 12%\n|-\n|  |Ted Cruz16%\n|  |Jeb Bush14%\n|  |Rand Paul14%\n|Mike Huckabee 13%, Chris Christie 9%, Marco Rubio 8%, Paul Ryan 7%, Scott Walker 5%, Someone Else/Undecided 15%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ± 4.4%\nSample size: 507\n| rowspan=\"2\" |July 25–28, 2013\n|  |Rand Paul18%\n|  |Sarah Palin14%\n|Chris Christie\n13%\n|Jeb Bush 11%, Marco Rubio 9%, Paul Ryan 9%, Ted Cruz 8%, Rick Santorum 5%, George Zimmerman 2%, Someone Else/Undecided 12%\n|-\n|  |Rand Paul20%\n|Jeb Bush\n15%\n|Chris Christie\n14%\n|Paul Ryan 14%, Marco Rubio 10%, Ted Cruz 9%, Rick Santorum 6%, Someone Else/Undecided 12%\n|-\n|Public Policy Polling\nMargin of error: ± 4.2%\nSample size: 537\n|Feb. 4–5, 2013\n|  |Marco Rubio18%\n|  |Mike Huckabee14%\n|Rand Paul\n12%\n|Chris Christie 11%, Paul Ryan 10%, Jeb Bush 9%, Sarah Palin 9%, Bobby Jindal 6%, Rick Perry 1%, Someone Else/Undecided 10%\n|}\nResults\nDelegates were awarded to candidates who got 13% or more of the vote proportionally.\nControversy\nAt the Republican National Convention, Alaska's floor votes were all recorded for Donald Trump by the convention secretary, even though the Alaska delegation read their votes according to the results of the caucuses- 12 for Cruz, 11 for Trump and 5 for Rubio. An Alaska delegate challenged the results as recorded. However, RNC chair Reince Priebus defended the actions of the convention secretary, saying that the delegates were bound to Trump.\nReferences"
