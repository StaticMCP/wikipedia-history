It portrays the Battle of Aspern-Essling fought on 21–22 May 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars. Fought just after Napoleon's forces had captured the Austrian capital Vienna, it was a significant defeat for the Grande Armée at the hands of the Austrian Army led by Archduke Charles. It is also known by the longer title Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, with his Staff at the Battle of Aspern-Essling.\nIn 1821 it was purchased by the Prince of Liechtenstein, who had fought at the battle. In 1838 Krafft produced another version of the painting, which is now also in the Liechtenstein Collection.\nSee also\n* The Battle of Wagram, an 1836 painting of Horace Vernet depicting another battle from the same campaign\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Bryan, Michael.
