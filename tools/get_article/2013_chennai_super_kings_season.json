      "text": "# 2013 Chennai Super Kings season\n\nChennai Super Kings (CSK) is a franchise cricket team based in Chennai, India, which plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). They were one of the nine teams that competed in the 2013 Indian Premier League. They were captained for the sixth season in succession by Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni.\nBackground\nBy the end of October 2012, all IPL teams were given an opportunity to trim their squad with which CSK retained 16 players of their 2012 squad. They released George Bailey, Doug Bollinger, Joginder Sharma, Suraj Randiv, Yo Mahesh, Abhinav Mukund, Scott Styris, Sudeep Tyagi, K Vasudevadas, G Vignesh from their squad.\nPre-season player signings\nBefore the auction, coach Stephen Fleming hinted that the team is looking to boost the local bowling option and also the pace department. At the auction, the Super Kings did not bid for a single batsman. They picked up five bowlers instead, which Gurunath Meiyappan, who was part of the Super Kings auction team, said was their sole objective.\nDirk Nannes was their first buy, but their most surprising purchase was South Africa's bowling allrounder Chris Morris for $625,000. Soon after getting Morris, the Super Kings went after the Sri Lankan spinner Sachithra Senanayake too, but lost him to Kolkata Knight Riders. Towards the end of the auction they picked up Australian seamer Ben Laughlin, Sri Lankan spinner Akila Dananjaya and the towering West Indian quick Jason Holder, all at their respective base prices.\nPost-auction, CSK first signed up the Indian U-19 all-rounder Baba Aparajith and also uncapped Tamil Nadu player Vijay Shankar. In a continuation of their auction strategy, Chennai Super Kings beefed up their bowling department further by signing five Indian uncapped bowlers. The bowlers signed-up were UP duo of Imtiyaz Ahmed and Ankit Rajpoot, Haryana quick Mohit Sharma, Karnataka pacer Ronit More and Tamil Nadu left-arm spinner R Karthikeyan.\nSquad\nPlayers with international caps before the start of the 2013 IPL season are listed in bold.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Name\n!Nationality\n!Birth date\n!Batting style\n!Bowling style\n!Notes\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Batsmen\n|-\n|03|| Suresh Raina ||  ||  || Left-handed || Right-arm off break ||  Vice-captain\n|-\n|13|| Francois du Plessis ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm leg break || Overseas\n|-\n|33|| Subramaniam Badrinath ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm off break ||\n|-\n|48|| Michael Hussey ||  ||  || Left-handed || Right-arm medium || Overseas\n|-\n|77|| Anirudha Srikkanth ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm off break ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| All-rounders\n|-\n|02|| Chris Morris ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium || Overseas\n|-\n|05|| Baba Aparajith ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm off break ||\n|-\n|12|| Ravindra Jadeja ||  ||  || Left-handed || Slow left arm orthodox ||\n|-\n|26|| Vijay Shankar ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm off break ||\n|-\n|47|| Dwayne Bravo ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium-fast || Overseas\n|-\n|81|| Albie Morkel ||  ||  || Left-handed || Right arm medium-fast || Overseas\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Wicket-keepers\n|-\n|06|| Wriddhiman Saha ||  ||  || Right-handed ||&nbsp;– ||\n|-\n|07|| Mahendra Singh Dhoni ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium || Captain\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"  style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\"| Bowlers\n|-\n|01|| R Karthikeyan ||  ||  || Right-handed || Slow left arm orthodox ||\n|-\n|04|| Akila Dananjaya ||  ||  || Left-handed || Right-arm off break ||Overseas\n|-\n|18|| Mohit Sharma ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium-fast ||\n|-\n|22|| Ronit More ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium-fast ||\n|-\n|27|| Shadab Jakati ||  ||  || Left-handed || Slow left arm orthodox ||\n|-\n|28|| Ben Hilfenhaus ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm fast-medium || Overseas\n|-\n|29|| Dirk Nannes ||  ||  || Right-handed || Left-arm fast-medium ||Overseas\n|-\n|43|| Ankit Rajpoot ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium-fast ||\n|-\n|55|| Ben Laughlin ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm fast-medium ||Overseas\n|-\n|63|| Imtiyaz Ahmed ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm fast-medium ||\n|-\n|92|| Nuwan Kulasekara ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm fast-medium || Overseas\n|-\n|98|| Jason Holder ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium-fast ||Overseas\n|-\n|99|| Ravichandran Ashwin ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm off break ||\n|}\nIndian Premier League\nMatch I: Super Kings started their season again with a loss, in their home ground, in a tight match against Mumbai Indians. Though the bowlers started restricting and take regular wickets, Pollard's onslaught helped Mumbai Indians reach 148. Super Kings batsmen stumbled through the chase with many of them falling for cheap shots. The skipper and captain of Chennai Super Kings Mahendra Singh Dhoni got the Chennai Super Kings back into the game by a scoring an amazing 51 of just 26 ball including 5 boundaries and 3 maximums and a strike rate of 196.15.

Winning the toss and opting to bowl, CSK's bowlers were constantly taking the wickets and bowled out KXIP for 138. David Hussey and Gurkeerat Singh helped KXIP to stabilize in the middle overs until Ashwin and Bravo struck back. Michael Hussey and Murali Vijay started the chase in a slow and steady manner. Once they were settled Hussey's blows made the run chase too easy with CSK winning it with 10 wickets and 16 balls to spare. Vijay playing the second fiddle reached his half century in run a ball. Mike Hussey was awarded Man of the Match for his clean-hit 86 off 54 balls.\nMatch III: CSK's third match was one of the best matches in all of the IPL so far. the Arch-rivals of CSK, RCB made 165 with the help of Kohli's 58 and AB De Villiers' cracking 64 off 32 balls. Batting CSK lost its openers cheaply at a poor runrate. Badrinath and Raina doing the repairs at the middle stages, Dhoni and Jadeja tweaking in the pre-last stages, CSK was made to get 29 runs from last 11 balls when Dhoni got out. With short cameos from Bravo and Morris, it was all down to Ravindra Jadeja to score 2 runs in the last ball. Off which, he gave a catch to the third man. Kohli was rejoicing the win and seeing the umpire giving the no-ball, it was confirmed a CSK's win. Post Match, many Jadeja's jokes started to revolve the Internet. MSD tweeted \"When you give Sir Ravindra Jadeja one ball to get 2 runs he will win it with one ball to spare !!\"\nMatch IV: Playing their 3rd game at home and facing a relatively low-threatening Pune Warriors India, CSK played one of its most lethargic display at the field.

CSK in the end won the encounter by 5 wickets and 5 balls to spare.\nMatch VII: Playing their 4th match in their home ground, CSK once again lost the toss was asked to bowl by the Rajasthan Royals captain Rahul Dravid.

Karan Sharma's maiden in the final overs gave the much needed pressure but Dhoni emphatically pulled the match easily. From 0 off 6 balls, he surged to 67 off 37 balls thus winning the MoM unanimously.\nMatch IX: In the reminiscent of the last year finals, Current Champions Kolkata Knight Riders faced current runners up CSK in the Chepauk Stadium for the 38th match of IPL 6. Batting first CSK once again showed its batting strength with Hussey and Newcomer Saha smashing 100 in the 10th over. With heavy top order hitting from Saha, Raina and Hussey, CSK reached 200. KKR's innings featured some glimpse of last year finals with Bisla going hammer and tonks at the CSK Bowlers'. With some intelligent and tight bowling from Morris and Bravo's 19th and 20th over, CSK won the game convincingly. Hussey's master class 95 with an astonishing strike rate of 161 earned him the MoM once again.\nMatch log\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Venue\n!Result\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Scorecard\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 1 ||  || Mumbai Indians || Chennai || Lost by 9 runs ||[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598002.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 2 ||  || Kings XI Punjab || Mohali || Won by 10 wickets, MoM&nbsp;–  Mike Hussey 86* (54) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598007.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 3 ||  || Royal Challengers Bangalore || Chennai || Won by 4 wickets, MoM&nbsp;–  Ravindra Jadeja 38* (20) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/current/match/598012.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 4 ||  || Pune Warriors India || Chennai || Lost by 24 runs || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598015.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 5 ||  || Delhi Daredevils || New Delhi || Won by 86 runs, MoM&nbsp;–  Mike Hussey 65* (50) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598020.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 6 ||  || Kolkata Knight Riders || Kolkata ||Won by 4 wickets, MoM&nbsp;- Ravindra Jadeja 36* (14) & 3/20 || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598022.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 7 ||  || Rajasthan Royals || Chennai || Won by 5 wickets, MoM&nbsp;–  Mike Hussey 88 (51) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598026.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 8 ||  || Sunrisers Hyderabad || Chennai || Won by 5 wickets, MoM&nbsp;–  Mahendra Singh Dhoni 67* (37) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598030.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 9 ||  || Kolkata Knight Riders || Chennai || Won by 14 runs, MoM&nbsp;–  Mike Hussey 95 (59) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/current/match/598034.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 10 ||  || Pune Warriors India || Pune || Won by 37 runs; MoM&nbsp;–  Mahendra Singh Dhoni 45* (16) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/current/match/598038.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 11 ||  || Kings XI Punjab || Chennai || Won by 15 runs; MoM&nbsp;-  Suresh Raina 100* (53) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598041.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 12 ||  || Mumbai Indians || Mumbai || Lost by 60 runs || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598046.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 13 ||  || Sunrisers Hyderabad || Hyderabad || Won by 77 runs; MoM&nbsp;-  Suresh Raina 99* (52) & 1/4 (1 Over) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598051.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 14 ||  || Rajasthan Royals || Jaipur || Lost by 5 wickets || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598058.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8;\"\n| 15 ||  || Delhi Daredevils || Chennai || Won by 33 runs; MoM&nbsp;–  Mahendra Singh Dhoni 58* (35) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598062.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 16 ||  || Royal Challengers Bangalore || Bengaluru || Lost by 24 runs || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/current/match/598068.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#c3fdb8\"\n| 17 ||  || Mumbai Indians (Qualifier #1)|| New Delhi || Won by 48 runs, MoM&nbsp;–  Mike Hussey 86* (58) || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598070.html Scorecard]\n|- style=\"background:#fbb;\"\n| 18 ||  || Mumbai Indians (Finals) || Kolkata || Lost by 23 runs || [http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/engine/match/598073.html Scorecard]\n|}\nReferences"
