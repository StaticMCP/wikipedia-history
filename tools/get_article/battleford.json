Although there has been occasional talk of the two communities merging, they remain separate entities. The local economy is fuelled mainly by agriculture.\nHistory\nThe Battleford area, dating from the 1770s, was the site of fur trading houses of numerous independent companies as well as the Hudson's Bay Company (that opened its Battleford, or Battle River post circa 1868). William Holmes operated a trading post for the North West Company just above the confluence of the Battle and Saskatchewan rivers in 1784. At least three posts were in use between 1868 and 1914.\nThe town itself was founded in 1875 as a fur trading post and North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) fort. Its post office opened in 1877. Between 1876 and 1883, Battleford was the territorial capital of the North-West Territories (now Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nunavut, northern Quebec, northern Ontario and the Northwest Territories) and the NWMP fort (Fort Battleford) located there played an important role in the 1885 North-West Rebellion. It is also the terminus of the historic Swift Current-Battleford Trail.\nIn 1883, the Battleford Industrial School opened. A residential school for First Nations children in Battleford, it operated from 1883 to 1914. It was the first residential school operated by the Government of Canada with the aim of assimilating Indigenous people into the society of the settlers. The school was one of three industrial schools opened by the Government of Canada in the early 1880s. The senior officials of the Department of Indian Affairs arranged for various religious denominations to administer and operate the schools. The federal government delegated responsibility for the Battleford school to an Anglican minister.\nIn 1888, the Canadian Pacific Railway was completed in the area. In 1892, Hudson's Bay Company opened a new store in Battleford, which closed in 1910.\nLooting of Battleford\nOn March 30, 1885, during the North-West Rebellion, the town of Battleford was looted by a party of Cree, who were short on food due to declining bison populations. When the Cree approached Battleford, the 500 residents fled to the nearby North-West Mounted Police post, Fort Battleford. The Crees then took food and supplies from the abandoned stores and houses. Two people died during the looting. Crooked Leg was accused of killing John Payne, and Man Without Blood was accused of killing a farmer named Tremont. They were convicted of murder and hanged later that year.\nGeography\nBattleford is located along the North Saskatchewan River near the mouth of the Battle River. It is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Battle River No. 438, as well as by the city of North Battleford and a small section of the Rural Municipality of North Battleford No. 437.\nClimate\nClimate data is taken from North Battleford Airport located  northeast of the town.\nNorth Battleford and the surrounding area experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb).
