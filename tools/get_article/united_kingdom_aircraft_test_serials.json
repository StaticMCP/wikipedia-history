They can be used for testing experimental and prototype aircraft or modifications, pre-delivery flights for foreign customers and are sometimes referred to as \"B\" class markings.\n1930s\nAn initial set of markings was introduced in 1929, each company was allocated a letter to which would follow a number, sometimes with a hyphen or a gap between. For example, A was allocated to the Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft and A 1 was used in March 1930 on an Armstrong Whitworth Starling. Sometimes Hawker and Vickers would also add the letters PV to the markings to indicate a private venture (that is a type in development not paid for by the Air Ministry).\n1940s\nshowing the wartime presentation]]\nThe presentation was changed to look like a military serial for security reasons during the Second World War. For example, the prototype de Havilland Mosquito was allocated test markings E-0234.\n1948\nFollowing a change back to the original system in 1946 a new system was introduced on 1 January 1948. Each company was allocated a number which followed the British nationality marking G and then followed by an individual identity number. For example, Blackburn Aeroplane & Motor Company were allocated G-2 and the first allocation G-2-1 was used on a Miles Messenger used as an engine testbed for the Cirrus Bombardier. Companies could allocate and re-use the identities as they liked, some ran in sequence from 1 and others used the aircraft manufacturers serial number as part of the marking, for example G-51-200 was a Britten Norman Islander with a manufacturers serial number of 200. Allocations of codes from defunct companies have been reallocated.\nLetter sequence 1929–1947\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Allocation\n!Company\n!Notes\n|-\n|A\n|Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-1 in 1948\n|-\n|B\n|Blackburn Aeroplane & Motor Company\n|Replaced by G-2 in 1948\n|-\n|C\n|Boulton Paul\n|Replaced by G-3 in 1948\n|-\n|D\n|Portsmouth Aviation\n|Replaced by G-4 in 1948\n|-\n|E\n|de Havilland\n|Replaced by G-5 in 1948\n|-\n|F\n|Fairey Aviation\n|Replaced by G-6 in 1948\n|-\n|G\n|Gloster Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-7 in 1948\n|-\n|H\n|Handley Page\n|Replaced by G-8 in 1948\n|-\n|I\n|Hawker Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-9 in 1948\n|-\n|J\n|Parnall Aircraft\n|Out of use by 1946\n|-\n|J\n|Reid & Sigrist\n|From 1947, replaced by G-10 in 1948\n|-\n|K\n|Avro\n|Replaced by G-11 in 1948\n|-\n|L\n|Saunders-Roe\n|Replaced by G-12 in 1948\n|-\n|M\n|Short Brothers\n|Replaced by G-14 in 1948\n|-\n|N\n|Supermarine\n|Replaced by G-15 in 1948\n|-\n|O\n|Vickers Armstrongs\n|Replaced by G-16 in 1948\n|-\n|P\n|Westland Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-17 in 1948\n|-\n|R\n|Bristol Aeroplane\n|Replaced by G-18 in 1948\n|-\n|S\n|Spartan Aircraft\n|Out of use by 1936\n|-\n|S\n|Heston Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-19 in 1948\n|-\n|T\n|General Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-20 in 1948\n|-\n|U\n|Phillips & Powis later Miles Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-21 in 1948\n|-\n|V\n|Airspeed\n|Replaced by G-22 in 1948\n|-\n|W\n|G & J Weir\n|1933–1946\n|-\n|X\n|Percival Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-23 in 1948\n|-\n|Y\n|British Aircraft Manufacturing\n|Out of use by 1938\n|-\n|Y\n|Cunliffe-Owen\n|1940–1947, replaced by G-24 in 1948\n|-\n|Z\n|Auster Aircraft\n|Replaced by G-25 in 1948\n|-\n|AB\n|Slingsby Sailplanes\n|Replaced by G-26 in 1948\n|}\nNumeric sequence since 1948\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Allocation\n!Company\n!Notes\n|-\n|G-1\n|Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft later Hawker Siddeley Aviation\n|1948–1967\n|-\n|G-1\n|Rolls-Royce\n|Since 1969\n|-\n|G-2\n|Blackburn Aircraft later Hawker Siddeley Aviation\n|Used at Brough\n|-\n|G-3\n|Boulton Paul\n|\n|-\n|G-4\n|Portsmouth Aviation\n|1948–1949\n|-\n|G-4\n|Miles Aviation\n|Since 1969\n|-\n|G-5\n|de Havilland later Hawker Siddeley Aviation\n|Used at Hatfield then Chester\n|-\n|G-6\n|Fairey Aviation later Westland Helicopters\n|\n|-\n|G-7\n|Gloster Aircraft\n|1948–1961\n|-\n|G-7\n|Slingsby Sailplanes\n|Since 1971\n|\n|-\n|G-8\n|Handley Page\n|1948-1970\n|-\n|G-9\n|Hawker Aircraft later Hawker Siddeley Aviation\n|Mainly used on Hawker Hunters and Hawker Sea Fury's\n|-\n|G-10\n|Reid & Sigrist\n|1948–1953\n|-\n|G-11\n|Avro later Hawker Siddeley Aviation\n|Used at Woodford\n|-\n|G-12\n|Saunders-Roe later Westland Aircraft then British Hovercraft Corporation\n|G-12-1 was used on the first practical hovercraft, the SR-N1; G-12-1 had been used previously on the Saro SR/A1\n|-\n|G-13\n|Not used\n|\n|-\n|G-14\n|Short Brothers\n|\n|-\n|G-15\n|Supermarine\n|1948–1968\n|-\n|G-16\n|Vickers-Armstrongs later British Aircraft Corporation\n|\n|-\n|G-17\n|Westland Aircraft later Westland Helicopters\n|\n|-\n|G-18\n|Bristol Aeroplane later British Aircraft Corporation\n|Used at Filton (Bristol) and Oldmixon (Weston-super-Mare)\n|-\n|G-19\n|Heston Aircraft\n|1948–1960\n|-\n|G-20\n|General Aircraft\n|1948–1949\n|-\n|G-21\n|Miles Aircraft later Handley Page Reading\n|1948–1963\n|-\n|G-22\n|Airspeed\n|1948–1952\n|-\n|G-23\n|Percival Aircraft later British Aircraft Corporation\n|1948–1966\n|-\n|G-24\n|Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft\n|1948–1949\n|-\n|G-25\n|Auster Aircraft\n|1948–1962\n|-\n|G-26\n|Slingsby Sailplanes\n|1948–1949\n|-\n|G-27\n|English Electric later British Aircraft Corporation\n|\n|-\n|G-28\n|British European Airways later British Airways Helicopters\n|\n|-\n|G-29\n|D.
