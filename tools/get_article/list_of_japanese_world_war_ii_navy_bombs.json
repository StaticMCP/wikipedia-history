      "text": "# List of Japanese World War II navy bombs\n\nA diagram of a Type 98 No.25 \"Land Bomb\" showing the typical construction of Japanese Navy land bombs, a thin walled steel cylinder with a nose and tail screwed and welded on.\nThis is a complete list of all aerial bombs  used by the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Second World War.\nTypes\nThe Japanese navy produced a large number of different types of bombs, these were sub-divided into three main categories:\n* Land bombs - for use against land targets. They were normally not produced to a high standard consisting of a simple cylindrical case, riveted or welded to a cast steel nose.\n* Ordinary bombs - for use against ships. They were produced in general purpose and semi-armor-piercing types. They were of higher quality and generally had a smooth machined case\n* Special bombs - for various purposes.\nColor coding system\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| Bomb type/mark\n!colspan=4| Marking scheme\n!colspan=4| Alternate marking scheme\n!rowspan=2| Purpose\n|-\n!

Only two saw service, the Type 3 No.25 Mk 4 armor-piercing rocket bomb, and the Type 3 No.6 Mk.27 air-to-air rocket bomb.\n{|class=wikitable  style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n! Model || Weight || Description\n|-\n! Type&nbsp;3&nbsp;No.25&nbsp;Mk&nbsp;4&nbsp;Mod&nbsp;1\n| 315&nbsp;kg\n| Work on this design began in 1935 and production commenced in 1943. 1.9 meters long, the bomb is an armor-piercing design, with a thick forged steel nose. The bomb attained a speed of about 100 meters per second when launched. The principal drawback was the small 3.5-kilogram bursting charge.\n|-\n! Type 5 No.1 Mk 9 Mod 1\n|\n| An experimental design, intended for use against surfaced submarines. The bomb carried  of explosives, and had a velocity of about 230 meters per second. Experiments were conducted in June 1944, and it was adopted in 1945. Production had started at the end of the war, but it had not been used. Capable of penetrating up to 25&nbsp;mm of armor.\n|-\n! Type 3 No.6 Mk 9\n|\n| An experimental design, intended for use against landing craft and small ships. The bomb carried  of explosives, and had a velocity of about 230 meters per second.\n|-\n! Type 3 No.6 Mk 27\n|\n| An anti-aircraft rocket that replaced the Type 99 No.3 Mk.3 in air-to-air bombing. It consisted of a large rocket motor with a  incendiary shrapnel warhead triggered by a clockwork time fuze with an adjustable delay of up to 10 seconds. The rocket had a maximum velocity of around 270&nbsp;m/s, and the warhead contained 140 iron pellets with white phosphorus embedded in them, these were scattered in a 60 degree cone when the warhead was triggered. The bomb was designed in January 1944 and adopted in February 1945.\n|-\n! Type 3 No.1 Mk 28\n|\n| An experimental anti-aircraft rocket with a  high-explosive warhead. Experiments were conducted in late 1944. This rocket used 2&nbsp;kg of propellent and had a maximum velocity of 400&nbsp;m/s.\n|}\nIncendiary bombs\n* Type 99 No.3 Mk 3\n* Type 3 No.6 Mk 3 bomb model 1\n* Type 2 No.25 Mk 3 bomb model 1\n* Type 98 No.7 Mk 6 bomb model 1\n* Type 98 No.7 Mk 6 bomb model 2\n* Type 1 No.7 Mk 6 bomb model 3 mod 1\n~ Type 45 No.44 Mk 6 bomb model 1\nGas bombs\n*No. 6 Mk 1\n*Type 1  No.6 Mk.1\n*Type 4 No.6 Mk 1\nCluster type bombs\n* Type 2 No.6 Mk 21 bomb model 1\n* Type 2 No.6 Mk 21 bomb model 2\n* 1&nbsp;kg hollow-charge bomb\n* 1&nbsp;kg anti-personnel bomb\nPractice bombs\n* 1&nbsp;kg Practice bomb Mod 2\n* 1&nbsp;kg Practice bomb Mod 3\n* No.3 Practice bomb Model 1\n* Type 99 No.3 Practice bomb\nFlares\n* Type 96 landing flare\n* Landing flare\n* 5&nbsp;kg parachute flare Model 2 mod 1\n* Type 0 parachute flare Model 1\n* Type 0 parachute flare Model 1 mod 1\n* Type 0 parachute flare Model 2\n* Type 0 parachute flare Model 3 mod 1\n* Experimental model 11 parachute flare\n* Type 94 float light\n* Experimental float light\n* Type 94 model 2 float light\n* Type 0 model 1 float light\nSmoke floats and markers\n* 2&nbsp;kg smoke float\n* 43&nbsp;kg smoke float\n* Type 0 Model 1 sea marker\n* Type 0 Model 2 sea marker\n* Cardboard type sea marker\n* Type 3 No.6 target marker bomb\n* Type 2 2&nbsp;kg target indicator\nMisc\n* 2&nbsp;kg Window (Chaff) bomb\nFuzes\nJapanese Navy bomb fuzes designation system was unknown to the Allies until after the end of the Second World War.  As a result, a designation system was created to describe the fuzes as follows. It consists of a capital letter, a numeral and a lower-case parenthetical letter.\nThe capital letter designates the fuzes type as follows:\n* A - nose impact\n* B - tail impact\n* C - long delay fuze\n* D - airburst fuze\n* E - protective fuze\nThe numeral approximates the order in which the fuzes were captured by the allies. Finally the lower-case letter in parentheses indicates the different but similar designs.\nWhere possible the original Japanese designation is given.\n* A-1(a)\n* A-1(b)\n* A-1(c)\n* A-3(a) Type 97 Mk 2 nose fuze\n* A-3(b) Type 1 nose fuze model 2\n* A-3(c) Type 2 nose indicator\n* A-3(d) Type 97 Mk 2 nose fuze Model 1\n* A-3(e) Type 3 nose indicator\n* A-3(f) Type 2 No.50 Ordinary bomb fuze model 1\n* A-3(g)\n* A-5(a)\n* B-2(a) Type 99 No.25 Ordinary bomb fuze\n* B-2(b) Type 99 No.80 Mk 5 Bomb fuze\n* B-3(a) Type 15 tail fuze model 2\n* B-3(b) Type 15 tail fuze model 1\n* B-5(b)\n* B-5(c)\n* B-6(a) Type 97 rail initiator\n* B-9(a) tail fuze\n* B-10(a) tail fuze\n* C-1(a) Type 99 special bomb fuze\n* C-2(a) Type 99 special bomb nose fuze\n* D-2(a)\n* D-2(b)\n* D-2(c)\n* D-3(a)\n* D-4(a) parachute flare fuze\n* Type 3 electric firing device\nSee also\n* List of Japanese World War II army bombs\nReferences"
