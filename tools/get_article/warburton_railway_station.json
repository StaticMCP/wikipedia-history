The station opened on 13 November 1901 and closed with the line on 1 August 1965. The site is now at one end of the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail, which follows the route of the former railway.\nOn 3 May 1909, to provide better facilities for the loading of timber from the numerous mills in the area, the track was extended to La La Siding, a short distance beyond Warburton station. The extension closed with the line in 1965.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/railways/image.aspx?ID=777 Photo of the station and rail siding, post-1920]\n*[http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/railways/image.aspx?ID=929 Photo of train entering Warburton, circa 1910]\n*[http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/railways/image.aspx?ID=930 Photo of the station, circa 1910]\n*[http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/railways/image.aspx?ID=931 Photo of the station and goods yard, circa 1910]\n*[http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/railways/image.aspx?ID=5515 Photo of the station shortly before closing, 26 November 1964]\n*[http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/railways/image.aspx?ID=5520 Photo of the goods shed shortly before closing, 26 November 1964]\n*[http://www.visitwarburton.com.au/ The Official website Visit Warburton - Warburton Valley Community and  Economic Development Association (CEDA)]"
