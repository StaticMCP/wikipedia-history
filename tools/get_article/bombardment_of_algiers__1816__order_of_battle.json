However, there was no vessel by that name in the French Navy between 1786 and 1861. Other sources refer to Ciotat as a gabarre or a corvette, and make no mention of her being a man-of-war.\nCitations\nReferences\n* Anon. \"By a Friend of the National Maritime Museum\" (1941) \"The Battle of Algiers\", ''Mariner's mirror'' (October 1941), Vol. 27, pp.&nbsp;324–338.\n*\n*"
