There are not many records about the Kazakh-Dzungar Wars because the Kazakh people did not have a written tradition of transmitting information at the time. The folk legend about the battle recorded in 1905 by the researcher and collector of Kazakh folklore, A. A. Divaev, tells that the battle took place between Lakes Balkhash and Alakol in present-day Almaty Region. The war between Kazakhs and Dzungars lasted for 7 years (1723–1730). The war ended with the victory of a single force consisting of members from all three main clans (jüzes) under the supreme command of Kazakh ruler Abu'l-Khair Muhammed Khan (1710–1748).\nLocation\nThe Añyraqai Mountains and Lake Alakol (Almaty region) were important strategic points during the entire period of the Kazakh-Dzungar confrontation. Access to the Sarysu, the Karkaraly Mountains and mountains of Ulytau took place from the river Chu. The different mountain landscapes provided good opportunities for cavalry attacks and maneuvers, and the tugai forests near the battle area allowed for covert concentration of troops.\nThe Anrakai gorge of Chu-Ili district is an important cultural and historical landmark, since the final battle and the end of the eight-year war took place here.\nBattle\nDue to the resumption of the Second Oirat–Qing War in early spring of 1729, the Dzungar Khuntaiji Galdan Tseren hastily mobilized the majority of the able-bodied male population to the Southern Front. As a result, by the spring of 1730, only small Dzungar detachments remained on the northwestern border of Dzungaria.\nTaking advantage of the situation in northwestern Dzungaria, Abul Khair Khan moved Kazakh forces toward Jetisu (the Semirechye direction) in late April 1730. The Kazakh advance toward Ańyraqai was launched from Saryarka, southern Kazakhstan, and the southwestern shores of Lake Balkhash.\nSome military units advanced on the Dzungar positions from Saryarka in the north (at the foothills of the southwestern slopes of the Khantau Mountains), moving southeast toward the central part of the Anyrakai mountain range, from where they penetrated the northeastern slopes of the hills and attacked small scattered Oirat groups with volleys of arrows. Another, larger group of troops moved from the western shore of Lake Balkhash and from the Aksuyek River area, following the Great Kalmyk Road southeast toward the Kalmak-Tobe fortification, where the main Dzungar forces of about 7,000—8,000 men were concentrated. A third force approached the same fortification from the south, through the Chu Valley, along the right bank of the Sarybulak River. The total number of Kazakh warriors advancing toward the Anyrakai area did not exceed 3,000 to 4,000 men.\nDuring the rapid advance of the western (second) and southern (third) Kazakh groupings toward the northern sections of the Kopaly and Sarybulak river valleys, fierce battles broke out in the Anyrakai area between Kazakh warriors and Dzungar dzangirs. The largest and fiercest hand-to-hand clashes occurred near the Kalmak-Tobe fortification, and the Dzungars stationed there were decisively driven out by the forces of the western and southern groups to the right bank of the Sarybulak River. They were then pushed by Kazakh detachments from the northeast of the area into its interior, toward the deep gorges of the Anyrakai Mountains. There, the retreating Dzungars were met by Kazakh warriors from the northern (first) group, who sought to weaken the Oirats by blocking access to springs located at the mountain foothills.\nDriving the Dzungar forces toward the Añyaqai Mountains, the Kazakh detachments herded them into deep gorges such as Almalu, Koshkarsai, and Shoptysay, where warriors from all three groupings surrounded the scattered Oirat groups from different directions and destroyed them piece by piece.\nThe victory at Añyraqai was a major triumph over the Dzungars, resulting in the expulsion of the Oirats from northwestern Jetisu and bringing the Kazakhs closer to the Oirat nomadic encampments on the left bank of the Ili River.\nFolk legends about the battle of Anrakai were common in Western Semirechye among local old-timers, but due to the great distance of this region from the settled agricultural countries of Central Asia, they were out of sight of Russian, Muslim and Chinese chroniclers of that time.\nA monument opened on the 35th kilometer of the highway Almaty – Bishkek. The monument is a composition of two monoliths standing in the center of a circle framed by 12 stones with signs of animals of the Turk 12-year cycle. The monument symbolizes the confrontation between the two peoples. A higher monolith made of red granite symbolizes Kazakhs, and a lower gray monolith symbolizes Dzungars.\nReferences"
