The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations.\nWhile many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed, not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties.\nA marker on the site of the assassination of Aurora Aragon Quezon in Bongabon was rededicated on the site on April 28, 2013, after the original marker dated February 13, 1991, went missing.\nThere has been an issue regarding the possible relocation of a historical marker dedicated to Francisco \"Soc\" Rodrigo in Bulakan over ownership issues of the heritage house.\nThe historical marker for José Rizal in Tarlac City was reported to be in a state of rot in 2011. The marker was relocated and put in a better position in front of the city plaza after 58 years of neglect.\nOn June 3, 2016, it was the first time for the NHCP to unveil a marker for a nameless personality. A marker was installed in Macabebe, commemorating the leader of the Battle of Bangkusay Channel, the \"first native to give up his life for independence.\"\nThe first historical marker in the Kapampangan language was unveiled on August 17, 2017, for the Holy Rosary Parish Church of Angeles City. This also served as a rectification for the earlier marker of the Pamintuan Mansion saying that the said house was the site of the first anniversary celebration of the independence of the Philippines. Thus, replacement markers were also installed for the said house.\nThis article lists two hundred twenty-six (226) markers from the region of Central Luzon, including eight (8) that are part of the Philippine Nationhood Trail markers series.\nAurora\nThis article lists seven (7) markers from the province of Aurora.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Marker title\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| English Translation\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Type\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Description\n! style=\"width:20%; background:#efefef;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Language\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Date Issued\n! style=\"width:10%; background:#efefef;\"| Image\n|-\n| Aurora Aragon Quezon (1888–1949)\n|\n| Building\n| House\n| First Lady of Manuel Quezon and became the first head of the Philippine Red Cross.\n| Aurora Aragon Quezon Ancestral House, Rizal St., Baler\n| Filipino\n| February 19, 1985\n|\n|-\n| Bayan ng Baler\n|Town of Baler\n|\n|\n| An old community of Barrio Sabang before the arrival of the Spaniards, established as a Franciscan mission in 1609.\n| Baler Plaza, Baler\n| Filipino\n| 2009\n|\n|-\n| Birthplace of Manuel Luis Quezon\n|\n| Structure\n| Monument\n| Site of the house where Manuel Quezon was born on August 19, 1878.\n| Museo Baler, Quezon St., Baler\n| English\n| 1948\n|\n|-\n| Dikaloyungan\n|\n| Site\n| Site\n| Site of declaration of defiance against the Spaniards in Aurora.
