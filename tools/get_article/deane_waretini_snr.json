He was possibly the first Maori singer to be commercially recorded, together with his cousin Ana Hato. His son Deane Waretini would also be a first with his no 1 hit The Bridge, which became the first Maori language song to be no 1 in the New Zealand music charts.\nBackground\nIn 1926/27, he and his cousin Hato began recording. During a performance for the Duke and Duchess of York, they were recorded by Parlophone Records technicians from the label's Australian branch. This was recorded on small portable acoustic equipment. This resulted in the first locally recorded commercial music that was to be released on shellac 78rpm disc format.\nAlong with his cousin Hato, he was contracted to Parlophone Records. An advertisement from Parlophone in the 1930s showed that they already had two solo releases under his name, as well as four in duet with his cousin.\nWaretini died in December 1967.\nLater years\nAfter his funeral, a relative George Tait, took his son Deane under his wing and would become his mentor and manager.\nIn 1996, the Ana Hato – raua ko Deane Waretini, Legendary Recordings 1927–1949 album was released by the Kiwi label.\nIn 2015, some of his records turned up at the St Michael's and Kelburn Village Fair's vintage and clothing and bric-a-brac in Wellington. Someone pointed out to organizer Patricia Thompson some boxes and suitcases of very old 78s. Among some of the records that were covered in mouse droppings were eight recordings by Ana Hato, and Waretini. One of them was \"Medley and Haka\" by Ana Hato and himself. These were made during a performance in Rotorua when the Duke and Duchess of York visited in 1926.\nDiscography (selective)\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Singles (solo)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Release info\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Haere Tonu\" (War Song) / \"Ka Mate\" (War Song)\n| Parlophone A2804\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"May I Not Love?\" / \"Po Ataru\" (With Ana Hato)\n| Parlophone A2806\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \"Karu Karu\" (Traditional Fishing Chant) / \"Te Arawa\" (Canoe Action Song)\n| TANZA Z12\n| 1950\n| Side A, Deane Waretini with The Arawa Concert PartySide B, The Arawa Concert Party\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+ Albums\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Release info\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ana Hato – raua ko Deane Waretini, Legendary Recordings 1927–1949\n| Kiwi  SLC-242\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
