When Ghoshal announces the exhibition and subsequent auction of a crown once worn by Emperor Babushah, Chindi challenges him that he is going to steal this priceless crown, and Ghoshal accepts the challenge and hires private security guards. Chindi carries out the theft, and two of the security guards, Vikram and Ajay, and an accomplice, John D'Souza, become prime suspects and are on the run. They must apprehend Chindi and recover the crown to absolve themselves of this crime. While being chased by security guards, the trio crashes into a wall and is transported back to the 10th century, straight into the palace of Emperor Babushah himself. The trio thinks they are on the set of a Bollywood film and takes nothing seriously until they are imprisoned. It is then the hapless trio realise that they must not only escape but must also take the crown, back with them to the 21st century to absolve themselves of this crime. Only a miracle can get them back to the 21st century.\nCast\n* Paresh Rawal as John \"Johnny\" D’Souza\n*  Iqbal Khan as Vikram \"Vicky\" Rajput\n* Anuj Sawhney as Ajay \"Ajju\" Sharma\n* Gulshan Grover as Chindi Chor / Babushah\n* Natanya Singh as the First Princess Junali\n* Raima Sen as the Second Princess Rudali\n* Farida Jalal as Mrs. Preeti D'Souza / Hiraka\n* Rushali Arora as Maria / Shalaka\n* Kader Khan as Bhaleram / Goatherd\n* Mushtaq Khan as the Bhaleram Assistant\n* Kanwarjeet Paintal as Scientist of 10th century\n* Narendra Jha as Babushah's Commander\n* Ashish Vidyarthi as Ghoshal Roshan\n* Bobby Darling as One of Maharaj Babushah's 40 wives\n* Veerendra Saxena as Inspector Chhatri Pal\n* Niloufer as Maharaj Babushah's 1st wife\n* Kavi Kumar Azad as Royal Guard/Goon on Juhu Beach\n* Amitabh Bachchan as Narrator\nMusic\nThe songs are written by Pravin Rai, Nitin Raikwar and Amitabh Verma.\nReception\nTaran Adarsh of IndiaFM gave the film 1.5 out of 5, writing, \"On the whole, FUN2SHH has an interesting first half, but an uninspiring second half takes away the sheen from the enterprise. The film has some curiosity value, but the content [script] does not match the expectations one has from a subject like this. \" Jyoti Shukla of Rediff.com wrote, \"Fun2shh appears to be a mix of a few episodes of the television serial Chandrakanta, a few Asterix comics and some Bollywood song and dance masala. The result is neither satirical nor comical. Just a test of the viewers' patience.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
