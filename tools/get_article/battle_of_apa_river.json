There, Paraguayans began to develop gardens and raise cattle. The Brazilian forces of the 17th Battalion of Volunteers of the Fatherland, who would later be part of the campaign called Withdrawal from the Lagoon, approached the farm and started the confrontation, on May 12, 1867. The Paraguayans tried to disable the farm, setting the fields on fire, harassing the cattle, then fleeing.\nReferences"
