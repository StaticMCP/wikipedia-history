In 1884 and 1885, Littlestown played exclusively as members of the Independent level Keystone Association.\nHistory\nThe Keystone Association and the member teams were formed at a March 3, 1884, meeting in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Carlisle, Pennsylvania and West Chester, Pennsylvania were franchises initially admitted to the league but never played.\nThe Littlestown Brown Stockings began play in 1884, as the Keystone Association played as a five–team Independent league.
