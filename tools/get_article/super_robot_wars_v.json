Studio and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. Released as part of Super Robot Wars 25th anniversary, it is the eighth standalone entry to the series since Super Robot Wars NEO, with the game's continued focus on the massive crossover between different mecha anime series released in Japan. It is released in Asia on February 23, 2017. A Nintendo Switch and Steam ports of the game were released on October 3, 2019.\nGameplay\nSimilar to the previous entries in the series, Super Robot Wars V is a Tactical RPG game with story elements and utilizes the same graphics engine seen in 3rd Super Robot Wars Z, but with an inclusion of a 3d isometric map unlike its predecessor. It follows the same basic structure as in previous games: when a stage begins, the character receives introductory dialogue between playable characters, leading to the scenario on the battlefield. To complete a scenario, the player must accomplish scenario objectives. Some scenarios are longer, with multi-part missions or have new objectives added as the story unfolds. On battlefield, the player and enemy take turns to order their units with commands available, such as movement, attacking, forming squads and casting \"Spirit Commands\", a set of magic-like spells unique to each pilot. Once the scenario is cleared, more dialogue is exchanged between characters before the player is taken to an intermission menu. Here, units can be upgraded or optional parts installed, characters' stats and skills can be changed or upgraded, and other maintenance actions can be performed before the player continues on with the game.\nNewer gameplay elements have also been brought into the game with the reintroduction of the Beginner's Mode. It also introduces a new Skill Route and Skill Program function, which allows players to fully customize pilots' skills using Tactical Points, which were obtained through the game's play-through. The game also features two new gameplay mechanics: Extra Order and Extra Action. Extra Action allows player units to use ExC points in each stage to gain advantage in battle while Extra Order allows battleship units to raise spirits of each units. Aside from the new features, combination attacks also return in the game as well as a Remote Play and Cross Save function to play the game in both the Vita and the PlayStation 4 without losing progress. Both games will not allow any recording and screenshots except to certain scenes of the game. Downloadable content has also been made available for the title.\nPlot\nThe creation of the first unified government over all humanity, the Earth Federation, marked the beginning of a new era: New Correct Century, and the beginning of humanity's expansion into space. However, it was also said to be the beginning of a new era of war. The battle between Earthnoids and Spacenoids that began with the One Year War raged on through Char's Rebellion, giving way to the so-called 10 Year Void, a decade-long gap in recorded history.\nA century has passed since then, and after the end of the Jupiter War, the Earth Federation was invaded by an alien species known as the \"Gamillas\". The Gamillas established a forward base on Pluto, and launched planet bombs at Earth. The planet bombs destroyed the space colonies and devastated Earth. The oceans were evaporated, the air was polluted, and the survivors were forced to retreat to shelters deep underground. Scientists estimated that only one year remained before humanity's extinction.\nThe story revolves around Soji Murakumo and Chitose Kisaragi, who were caught up with the war with the Gamillas in the New Correct Century. While on their escape to the last hope of mankind: the space battleship Yamato, Soji/Chitose stumble upon a mysterious mobile unit constructed by the federation. Dubbed the VangRay, he/she pilots it in order to fend off the Gamillas invasion and buy time for the Yamato to appear and score humanity's first victory against them. With a promise of salvation from a distant planet known as Iscandar, Soji/Chitose join up with the Yamato crew in order to save mankind and depart on a journey of one hundred and sixty-eight thousand light years to Iscandar, not knowing they will encounter strange dimensional disturbances on the way.\nDevelopment\nFirst announced at the 25th Anniversary Live Event alongside Super Robot Wars Original Generation: The Moon Dwellers, Super Robot Wars V continues the trend of the series for being a crossover tactical role-playing game featuring various mecha anime series from other studios. It is also announced in the live event that it is the second game in the series to officially receive an English release in Asia and the first game in series to be given a C rating by CERO. In addition to the enhanced animation and graphics seen in 3rd Super Robot Wars Z: Celestial Prison Chapter, the game also includes a cross-save feature like the previous entry.\nThe game itself marks a lot of new entries to the series and also a lot of returns. The game marks the return of both Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ and Mobile Suit Crossbone Gundam into the series proper, the first introduction of the second Brave Series into the game in the form of The Brave Express Might Gaine, and the debut of a non-mecha space opera anime series into the game in the form of Star Blazers: Space Battleship Yamato 2199,.
