Nine senior leagues – all governed by AFL Queensland (AFLQ) – held competitions, with the highest-level being the Queensland Australian Football League (QAFL) and the QAFL Women's (QAFLW).\nMost AFLQ leagues operated with a single senior division (one for men and one for women), consisting of a home-and-away season and a finals series, along with lower-grade reserves and junior competitions. Only one competition, the Queensland Football Association (QFA), used a promotion and relegation system.\nQAFL\nwon the QAFL premiership for the 11th time, defeating  by five points in the 2024 QAFL Grand Final.\nwon the QAFLW premiership for the first time, defeating  by 35 points in the 2024 QAFLW Grand Final at People First Stadium.\nCairns\n| image            =\n| imagesize        =\n| caption          =\n| teams            = 7\n| premiers1        = South Cairns\n| count1           = 10\n| minor premiers1  = South Cairns\n| mpcount1         =\n| top goal scorer1 =\n| bestandfairest1  =\n| premiers2        = Cairns City\n| count2           = 1\n| minor premiers2  = Cairns City\n| mpcount2         =\n| top goal scorer2 =\n| bestandfairest2  =\n| development      = South Cairns\n| div3            = Cairns\n| prevseason      =\n| nextseason      =\n}}\nThe 2024 AFL Cairns season was the 69th season of the AFL Cairns (AFLC) men's competition and the 15th season of the women's competition.\nSouth Cairns won the men's premiership for the tenth time, defeating North Cairns by 32 points in the grand final.

Scores were tied at the final siren, and as the extra time rules were unclear, a coin toss was conducted – the Tigers wanted two five-minute terms, while the Buffaloes wanted two ten-minute terms. The Buffaloes won the coin toss, and ultimately won the match at the end of extra time.\nAlthough AFLMI had hoped to start an official women's league in 2024, no such competition took place. Instead, informal women's matches took place throughout the year, with teams selected on the day. One of these matches was played as a curtain raiser to the grand final.\nLadder\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+\n! style=\"width:10px\" |\n! style=\"width:35%;\" | Team\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n! style=\"width:30px;\"|\n!

It included three age-based divisions – primary (grades 4–6), junior (grades 7–9) and senior (grades 10–12) – for both male and female players. A record 745 teams and 16,269 players participated.\nFor a second straight year, Palm Beach Currumbin State High School won all four secondary school titles, while St Vincent's Primary School and Marymount Primary School claimed the primary male and female titles respectively. All four players named best-on-ground in the secondary school grand finals were members of the Gold Coast Suns Academy.\nNotes\nReferences"
