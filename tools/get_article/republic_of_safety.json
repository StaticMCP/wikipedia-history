The original members were vocalist Maggie MacDonald, guitarist Jonny Dovercourt, bassists Kat Gligorijevic and Kate McGee and drummer Evan Davies.  The final lineup featured MacDonald and Dovercourt with Marlena Kaesler, a vocalist, bass and guitar player from Caledonia, Ontario, Steve Sidoli (drums) and Martin Eckart (saxophone).\nThe band's first EP, Passport, was released on Sonic Unyon Records in 2005, and their follow-up release, Vacation came out on Ta Da! Records in 2006.  The latter release included guest appearances by Owen Pallett and Reg Vermue, and was produced by Don Pyle. Both EPs received airplay on Canadian campus radio and CBC Radio 3.\nCiting creative differences and day jobs, the band ended as of early 2008. Their final gig on January 26, 2008, also doubled as a release for their third and final EP entitled Succession.\nBand members\n*Maggie MacDonald\n*Kat Gligorijevic\n*Kate McGee\n*Evan Davies\n*Jonny Dovercourt\n*Marlena Kaesler\n*Martin Eckart\nDiscography\nEPs\n* Passport (2005)\n* Vacation (2006)\n* Succession (2008)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20051229093119/http://www.republicofsafety.ca/\n* [http://www.eyeweekly.com/music/streetspirit/article/15853/ Article on break-up/final gig/EP]"
