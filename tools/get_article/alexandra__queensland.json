In the , Alexandra had a population of 189 people.\nGeography\nAlexandra is flat low-lying land bordered to the north by the Pioneer River and to the south by Bakers Creek. The Peak Downs Highway passes from east to west through the centre of the locality; there is a junction with the Mackay–Eungella Road which exits the locality in the north-west. Most of the housing is clustered around these two roads. Most of the land in the suburb is used for sugarcane farming.\nThe Finch Hatton branch of the Mackay Railway ran through the locality from east to west with the local area served by the now-dismantled Alexandra railway station (). After the closure of the railway, a sugarcane tramway replaced it to provide transport for the harvested sugarcane from the canefields to the sugar mills.\nHistory\nThe suburb's name is taken from the Alexandra sugar mill. The mill, in turn, was named by mill owner Thomas Henry Fitzgerald after Princess Alexandra of Denmark who married Prince Edward (later King Edward VII) of Great Britain on 10 March 1863.\nThe mill was constructed in 1868 and was the largest sugar mill in Queensland. It operated until 1884. It was located immediately south of the Alexandra railway station ().\nDemographics\nIn the , Alexandra had a population of 193 people.\nIn the , Alexandra had a population of 189 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Alexandra.
