There are numerous novels, nonfiction books, films, TV shows, and video games, all taking a critical view of surveillance. Some well known examples include George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1948), Peter Jackson's film adaptations of The Lord of the Rings (2001–2003), and Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight (2008).

It does so automatically, without any human interventions (only seven people in the world are aware of its existence). The Machine has the purpose of preventing terrorist attacks, but it sees crimes involving ordinary citizens. It provides the authorities with the SSN of the person of interest, which is either a target or a perpetrator. The NSA has been trying to access the Machine but the software is so well encrypted that no operating system can crack it. Harold Finch is convinced that the government would abuse the Machine if they can access it, and he vows to make sure that no one else gets hold of the Machine. In one episode, an employee of the NSA discovered the existence of the Machine and a black ops unit is ordered to kill him.\nVideo games\n* Freedom Wars is a PSVita action role-playing game which set in the dystopian future.

And the criminals were forced to hard labors of finding resources in the outside world, and then contribute to their government to exchange for few years amnesty or gain access to several human rights.

He also discovers that the engineers of these integrated systems are also in the process of establishing a program that can predict human behavior and thus be used for mass social engineering purposes.  On several occasions, these systems are also used against Aiden to send law enforcement or criminal enforcers after him in efforts to apprehend or kill him.  The game also demonstrates the possibility of taking control of an entire city through unauthorized access and misuse of an integrated infrastructure.\nOptimistic about mass surveillance\n* The Light of Other Days is a science-fiction book that praises mass surveillance, under the condition that it is available to everyone.
