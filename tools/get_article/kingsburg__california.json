In the early 1870s, Swedish natives settled in a railroad town called \"Kings River Switch\". Kingsburg started out as a flag stop on the Central Pacific Railroad called Kings River Switch. In 1874 Kingsburg was called Wheatville and had a post office, later that year they changed the name to Kingsbury. During this time period, Josiah Draper and Andrew Farley each owned a quarter section, about , Draper on the east side of the railroad tracks and Farley on the west side of the tracks. So it was suggested that the east side be called Drapersville and the west side called Farleyville. Two years after that it became Kingsburgh and in January 1894 took on its present spelling, \"Kingsburg\", which was finally established as a town in 1908. By 1921, ninety-four percent of the population within a three-mile radius of Kingsburg was Swedish-American, giving the community the nickname of \"Little Sweden\". To keep up with the town's Swedish history most retail businesses are designed in Swedish architecture.\nGeography\nKingsburg is located in the central portion of the Central Valley of California.

Kingsburg is home to the world's largest box of raisins, built by students at California State University, Fresno.\nPoints of interest and events\nOne of the notable landmarks in the community is the Kingsburg water tower, which is shaped like an antique Swedish coffee pot. The water tower was originally built in 1911 and was modified in 1985, inspired by a resident's visit to the similarly decorated water tower in Stanton, Iowa; the Kingsburg coffee pot water tower is  tall, lit at night, and visible from SR 99.

The Kingsburg Swedish Festival, which is one of the biggest and best known festivals that bring people in from all over the country, is held annually during the third weekend in May. Activities include a Swedish pancake breakfast, a parade and the coronation of the Swedish Festival Queen. Many booths, rides and activities are set up all along the side of Downtown Kingsburg's Draper Street. This festival, which has traditionally been held on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, was scheduled for only Saturday and Sunday in 2009 after the town's centennial due to the suffering economy, but in 2011, Thursday activities were added to the festival.\nEducation\nKingsburg Elementary schools operate on a charter school system.
