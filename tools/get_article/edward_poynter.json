He was born in Paris, France, though his parents returned to Britain soon after his birth. He was educated at Brighton College and Ipswich School, but left school early for reasons of ill health, spending winters in Madeira and Rome. In 1853, he met Frederick Leighton in Rome, who made a great impression on the 17-year-old Poynter.  On his return to London he studied at Leigh's Academy in Newman Street and the Royal Academy Schools, before going to Paris to study in the studio of the classicist painter Charles Gleyre where James McNeill Whistler and George du Maurier were fellow-students.\nIn 1866 Poynter married the famous beauty Agnes MacDonald, daughter of the Rev. G. B. MacDonald of Wolverhampton, and they had three children. Her sister Georgiana married the artist Edward Burne-Jones; her sister Alice was the mother of writer Rudyard Kipling; and her sister Louisa was the mother of three-times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Stanley Baldwin.\nPoynter's sister Clara Bell became a noted translator of literary and scientific works.\nCareer\n[[File:Edward John Poynter by J.

Mayall] from Artists at Home, published 1884, [https://www.nga.gov/research/library/imagecollections.html Department of Image Collections, National Gallery of Art Library], Washington, DC]]\nHe became best known for his large historical paintings such as Israel in Egypt (1867; Guildhall Art Gallery, London), followed by St George for England (1869), a mosaic for the Central Lobby of the Palace of Westminster, depicting St George and the Dragon and perhaps culminating with The Visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon (1884&ndash;90; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney). He was admitted as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1869.\n'', 1890]]\nPoynter held a number of official posts: he was the first Slade Professor at University College London from 1871 to 1875, principal of the National Art Training School from 1875 to 1881 and director of the National Gallery from 1894 to 1904 (overseeing the opening of the Tate Gallery). He became a full Royal Academician in 1876. In 1896, on the death of Sir John Millais, Poynter was elected President of the Academy. He received a knighthood in the same year and an honorary degree from Cambridge University in 1898. It was announced that he would receive a baronetcy in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 for the (subsequently postponed) coronation of King Edward VII, and on 24 July 1902 he was created a Baronet, of Albert Gate, in the city of Westminster, in the county of London.\nPoynter's old school, Brighton College, held an exhibition of Poynter's paintings and drawings entitled Life at Arms Length in its Burstow Gallery in November–December 1995.\nWorks\nPaintings\nFile:At low tide.jpg|At Low Tide\nFile:The Siren by Edward John Poynter (1864).jpg|The Siren (1864)\nFile:Sir Edward John Poynter  — Cave of the Storm Nymphs.jpg|The Cave of the Storm Nymphs (1903; Private collection)\nFile:Edward John Poynter - Psyche in the Temple of Love - Google Art Project.jpg|Psyche in the Temple of Love\nFile:Edward John Poynter - Faithful Unto Death - Google Art Project.jpg|Faithful Unto Death, 1865\nFile:1869 Edward Poynter - Andromeda.jpg|Andromeda, Edward Poynter, 1869\nFile:Edward Poynter - The Fortune Teller.jpg|The Fortune Teller (1877)\nFile:Lillie Langtry00.jpg|Portrait of Lillie Langtry, 1878\nFile:Zenobia Captive.jpeg|Zenobia Captive, 1878\nFile:Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) - Diadumenè - 77-1969 - Royal Albert Memorial Museum ^ Art Gallery.jpg|Diadumenè (1884)\nFile:Corner of the marketplace, by Edward John Poynter.jpg|Corner of the Marketplace (1887)\nFile:Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) - On the Temple Steps - BURGM-paoil173 - Towneley Hall Art Gallery And Museum.jpg|On the Temple Steps (1889)\nFile:Pea Blossoms.jpg|Pea Blossoms\nFile:1867 Edward Poynter - Israel in Egypt.jpg|Israel in Egypt (1867)\nFile:Catapulta by Edward Poynter.jpg|Catapulta\nFile:Edward John Poynter - Barine.jpg|Barine (1894)\nFile:Water Babies).jpg|Water Babies (1900)\nFile:Edward John Poynter - The Vision of Endymion, 1902.jpg| The Vision of Endymion (1902)\nFile:Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) - A Visit to Aesculapius - N01586 - National Gallery.jpg|A Visit to Aesculapius (1880)\nFile:Wild Blossoms.jpg|Wild Blossoms (c. 1880)\nFile:The Ides of March Edward John Poynter (1836–1919).jpg|The Ides of March (1883)\nFile:Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) - Corner of the Market Place - VIS.LI.757 - Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust.jpg|Corner of the Market Place (1887)\nFile:Sir Edward John Poynter - The Ionian Dance Motus doceri gaudet Ionicos, Matura virgo, et fingitur artibus.jpg|The Ionian Dance (1895)\nFile:Sir Edward John Poynter — Cave of the Storm Nymphs.jpg|Cave of the Storm Nymphs (1903)\nFile:Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) - The Bells of Saint Mark's, Venice - 1916P30 - Birmingham Museums Trust.jpg|''The Bells of Saint Mark's Venice'' (1903)\nStained glass\nEarly in his career, Poynter designed some works\nin stained glass.
