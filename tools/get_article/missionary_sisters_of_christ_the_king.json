It was founded in 1959 by the Servant of God, Father Ignacy Posadzy, priest of the Society of Christ (exact date of establishment - November 21, 1959; approval under papal rights - November 24, 1996).\nThe vocation of each missionary is boundless love for the cause of God among the Polish diaspora abroad and the desire for self-sacrifice and joyful sacrifice of strength, comfort and life for the good of the Polish diaspora.\nThe sisters live in a community whose inner motto is Paul's exclamation: \"May only Christ be proclaimed\" (Phil 1:18). At the center of their lives is Christ, reigning from the throne of the cross. Together with their immigrant brothers, they share the joys, sorrows and longings of everyday life. In a foreign land, missionary sisters want to strengthen their faith and build a scrap of their beloved homeland by spreading the cult of the Eucharist, catechesis, and nurturing Polish culture, tradition and language.\nReferences"
