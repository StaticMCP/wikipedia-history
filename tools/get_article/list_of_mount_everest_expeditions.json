These mountaineering expeditions were for a variety of purposes, including geographic exploration, sport, science, awareness raising, and fundraising.\nThere have been many expeditions throughout the 20th (1900s) and 21st (2000s) centuries, with the amount increasing dramatically in the late 20th century before skyrocketing in the 2000s.\nIntroduction\nThe early slowness of expedition frequency reflected the many difficulties of mounting one at that time, which included expense, travel by conventional means from distant Europe, language and culture barriers, the need to hire large numbers of native porters, access to the mountains (including permission of respective governments), extremely limited communications, and, simply, the unknown, as no-one had ever attempted to climb so high before.\nAlong with explorations of both poles, the challenge of reaching the highest point on the Earth spurred a late, great burst of effort to complete the Age of Discovery on Earth, with only the deep marine trenches remaining.\nThe first expedition was a reconnaissance in 1921, and after a few decades (heavily interrupted both by access problems and the Second World War), a 1953 British expedition reached the top of Everest. Early Everest expeditions had a reputation for grandiosity, both because they were such large undertakings and the character of the elite Europeans mounting them, with the 1953 expedition hiring 320 porters to carry supplies from Kathmandu across a remote, barely explored, wilderness. The 1963 American expedition had over 900 porters that carried over 25 tons of supplies, supporting a climbing crew of dozens.  Over time the absolute size of expeditions shrank – in part thanks to helicopter deliveries of both supplies and personnel that began to occur late in the 20th century – but, with commercial expedition companies proliferating, the number of climbers in a party that may have begun with hundreds or even close to 1,000 members in all with only as few as two summitting shrank, while the number bidding to reach the top could swell into double-digits with a single outfitter's effort.\nList\nPrior to 1960\n*1921 British reconnaissance\n*1922 British\n*1924 British (included the Affair of the Dancing Lamas)\n*1933 British aerial reconnaissance\n*1933 British\n*1935 British reconnaissance\n*1936 British\n*1938 British\n*1951 British reconnaissance\n*1952 Swiss\n*1953 British, first successful expedition\n**The ninth British expedition was led by John Hunt and organized and financed by the Joint Himalayan Committee.

This was the first time men had reached the top of Mount Everest.\n*1956 Swiss Expedition\n**The second Swiss expedition was led by  and the summit of Everest was reached on May 23, 1956, by four Swiss mountaineers, Ernst Schmied, Jürg Marmet, Dölf Reist, and Hansruedi von Gunten\n1960s\n*1960 Chinese\n*1963 American First ascent by an American: Jim Whittaker, accompanied by Nawang Gombu Sherpa who later went on to become the first man to climb Everest twice in 1965; first ascent of the West Ridge on May 22 by Americans Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld.
