They also share a free trade agreement called the Japan–United Kingdom Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, a tax treaty, and a reciprocal access agreement; the United Kingdom is one of only three countries to share the latter with Japan, and is the only European country to do so.\nHistory\nThe history of the relationship between Japan and England began in 1600 with the arrival of William Adams (Adams the Pilot or Miura Anjin), who became the first of very few non-Japanese samurai after arriving on the shores of Kyushu at Usuki (present-day Ōita Prefecture). There were no formal relations between the two countries during the Sakoku period (1641–1853), with the Dutch acting as intermediaries.\nFormal diplomatic ties began with the treaty of 1854, which eventually led to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. This marked the end of the \"splendid isolation\" philosophy Britain had followed since 1815, while Japan received much-needed British support ahead of the looming Russo-Japanese War. Japan's victory over Russia solidified the alliance, which lasted for two decades, but pressure from the United States and the subsequent Four-Power Treaty of 1921 brought it to an end. Relations deteriorated rapidly during the 1930s due to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and the cutoff of oil supplies in 1941 further escalated tensions. Japan declared war in December 1941 and used overwhelming force to seize most British possessions east of the British Raj (present-day India) such as Borneo (with its vital oil reserves), Burma, Hong Kong, Malaya, and Singapore. However, the British began pushing Japanese forces back after they reached the outskirts of India.\nBeginning in the 1950s, relations between Japan and the United Kingdom improved notably as memories of the past conflict faded. In the 1970s, Emperor Hirohito and Queen Elizabeth II paid state visits to each other's countries. The United Kingdom and Japan currently have strong economic ties, with both being members of the G7 and CPTPP. The two are also collaborating in the field of defence, most notably through the GCAP Programme alongside Italy.\nTimeline of relations\n1500s\n*1577.
