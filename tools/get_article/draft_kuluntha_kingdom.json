It is mentioned in the  or Urangkhathat ().\nHistory\nEarly settlements\nThe polities develope as the salt source\nChenla – Dvaravati period: 6th–10th centuries\nIn the 8th century, the Dvaravati culture from the central plain of modern Thailand had pushed north to create several city-states in the central Mekong Valleys. Of those, Sri Gotapura (Sikhottabong) near Tha Khek was the strongest of these early city-states and controlled trade throughout the middle Mekong region. These city-states were loosely bound politically, but were culturally similar and introduced Therevada Buddhism from Sri Lankan missionaries throughout the region.\nArchaeological surveys discovered that several\nAngkorian period: 10th–12th centuries\nAfter Jayavarman II declared independence from Java and established Kambujadesa in 802, he annexed several chiefdoms in the north and northeast region of Tonlé Sap and then moved to capital northward to Angkor in the late 9th century. With this strategic location, Angkor began to expand its influence to the Chi–Mun Valleys to the north around the 10th century. No contemporary record regards the socio-political aspect found in the area, the mentioned presumption was established based on the later Khmer architectural styles found in several former Dvaravati settlements. Woodward speculates that Jayavarman II possibly defeated Wen Dan, the precursor of Kuruntha, or allied with the polities in Mun and Chi watersheds against Si Thep to the west. The upper Mun Valley centered at Phimai was integrated into the Kambujadesa approximately around 1000 CE during the reign of Suryavarman I of Shailendra dynasty, 200 years after Jayavarman II established Angkor as the Khmer capital, but no record about the political conditions of the polities in the Chi Valley to the north. However, the northernmost Laotian polity, Muang Sua, was said to be the vassal of Angkor when the Khmer peaked in power during 1070–1128 and 1185–1191, as well as Vientiane which was mentioned by the Vietnamese inscription of Duke Đỗ Anh Vũ as a vassal of Khmer in 1135; thus, the Chi polities potentially fell into the same condition during the period mentioned.\nThe Memory of the World of the  legend, which was compiled by Laotian king around 1638–1641, asserts that the kingdom was founded in the first century CE; however, various details in the text, including references to Ayodhaya and Inthapat Nakhon (; commonly known as Yaśodharapura) during the kingdom's early period, suggest that the events likely transpired post-10th century, coinciding with the era when the Lao people began to extend their influence into the Mun-Chi basins.\nThe story begins with two kings, Phraya Sri Amarani () and Phraya Yothika (), who were companions, giving their thrones to Phraya Sri Amarani's son named Phraya Suriyawongsa Sitthidet (). This merger enabled the kingdom to reach its peak in power, with several surrounding city-states under Saket Nakhon's authority. Its territory was said to be reached Mueang Bua () in Kaset Wisai District to the south, Mueang Fa Daet Song Yang to the north, Mueang Champasri to the west, and Mueang Prai () in Selaphum District to the east.\nThe region was depopulated around the 11th-12th century following the decline of Angkor, and was almost left abandoned in 13th centuries. In this period, the Chi-Mun Basins, except the Phimai region, were sparse in population. Subsequent to this population collapse, the principal center of Kuruntha at Saket Nakhon diminished to a small village. Its vassals seceded, resulting in the emergence of multiple city-states or mueangs, such as Chiang Hian – Ban Iat (), Si Kaeo – Phaek Wean (), Muang Hong – Muang Thong (), Muang Pheng (), and Mueang Fa Daet. These mueangs are said to have close relationships with Muang Nong Han (Nong Han Noi, ), also called Chatitanakorn (), to the north in the modern-day Nong Han district, Udon Thani province. Muang Nong Han also had dynastic relations with the northernmost Laotian polity of Muang Sua, also known as Sri Sattanak, as says in the local legend of Phadaeng Nang Ai.\nLan Xang period: 13th–18th centuries\ns in the Chi-Mun Valleys during the 13th-14th century, before the unification of Lan Xang by Fa Ngum in the mid-14th century.|350px]]\nPrior to the relocation of the capital of the Kingdom of Lan Xang to Vientiane in 1560, the Chi-Mun was characterized by multiple city-states or mueangs, which shared ethnolinguistic origins with the more prominent northern polities centered on Vientiane and Muang Sua. The small polities in the Chi Basin and the northern bank of the Mun River were later absorbed into Lan Xang in the 17th century, while the territory to the south of the Mun River to the Dângrêk Mountains, except for the Phimai region, was repopulated by the Kuy people, who fled the Tboung Khmum Kingdom which has been subjugated by the Khmer Longvek in the 15th–16th centuries.\nIn the early 18th century, the abandoned Saket Nakhon was repopulated by Lao people from Lan Xang Champasak and was known by the locals as a small village named Ban Kum Hang'' (). It was under Mueang Thong Sri Phum (; later known as ), built in 1713 as the western fortress of the Laotian Kingdom of Champasak. Later in 1765, a conflict over the succession at Thong Sri Phum caused the polity to royal under the Ayutthaya Kingdom instead. After the Fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, Thong Sri Phum enjoyed a short 7-month independence and then was under the Ayutthaya's successor, the Thonburi Kingdom.\nRattanakosin period: after 18th century\nIn 1775, during the Thonburi period, Ban Kum Hang gained more recognition as the people led by a noble named Tont (), son of Kaew Mongkon () of , relocated there following the conflict over the succession at Mueang Suwannaphum. Tont renamed the settlement to its ancient name mentioned in the local legend, Roi Et, then established it as an independent polity from Mueang Suwannaphum, and was enthroned as the inaugural governor. It was merged with other easternmost polities to create Monthon Lao Kao in 1891, which was later split into Monthon Roi Et and  in 1912. These Monthons were incorporated into the  in 1926. The Monthon system was abolished in 1933, Roi Et became a province, and Mueang Suwannaphum was a district in the said province.\nRoi Et and other Siamese tributaries were completely incorporated into Siam in 1897 when the agnatic succession in local dynasties was abolished by Siamese King Chulalongkorn.\nReferences\n:Category:Former countries in Thai history\n:Category:Former countries in Southeast Asia\n:Category:Former monarchies of Asia\n:Category:Indianized kingdoms\n:Category:States and territories established in the 9th century\n:Category:9th-century establishments in Thailand\n:Category:13th-century disestablishments in Thailand\n:Category:1st millennium in Thailand\n:Category:Former monarchies of Southeast Asia"
