      "text": "# Believer Book Award\n\nBeliever Book Award was an American literary award presented yearly by The Believer magazine between 2005 and 2021. The award was given to those novels and story collections, nonfiction books or essay collections, poetry collections, and, beginning in 2021 (awarded to books published in 2020), works of graphic narrative that the magazine's editors thought were the \"strongest and most under-appreciated\" of the year. A shortlist and longlist were announced for each genre, along with readers' favorites, then a final winner was selected by the magazine's editors.\nThe inaugural award was in 2005 for books published in 2004. The last award was given in 2021, when the magazine ceased production. The magazine was bought by McSweeney's in 2022 and resumed publication. It is not known whether the book award will also resume.\nWinners and shortlist\n2004–2018\nThe year below denotes when the books were published; the award is announced the following year. Thus below, the inaugural 2004 books were announced in early to mid-2005. From 2004 to 2018, a single award was presented.
