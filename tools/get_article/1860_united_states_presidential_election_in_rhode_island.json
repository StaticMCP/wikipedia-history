However, unlike in the other three states the electors on the Democratic ticket in Rhode Island were pledged solely to Douglas, therefore some sources credit the Democratic popular vote to the Northern Democratic nominee.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Rhode Island\nReferences"
