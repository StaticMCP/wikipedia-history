The series is primarily set in fictional forests. Published by HarperCollins, the series is written by authors Kate Cary and Cherith Baldry, as well as others, under the collective pseudonym Erin Hunter. The concept and plot of the pilot series were developed by series editor, Victoria Holmes.\nThere are currently nine sub-series (\"arcs\"), each containing six books: The Prophecies Begin, The New Prophecy, Power of Three, Omen of the Stars, Dawn of the Clans, A Vision of Shadows, The Broken Code, A Starless Clan, and Changing Skies. Other books have been released in addition to the main series, including lengthier \"Super Edition\" novels, several novellas, many guide books, several volumes of original English language manga, and graphic novels. The series has also been translated into several languages, and has sold over 80 million copies worldwide.\nInspiration and origins\n, which became the base for the forest the cats live in|alt=A forest with trees, grass, and water]]\nThe series first began when publisher HarperCollins asked Victoria Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats. Holmes was initially not enthusiastic, since she \"couldn't imagine coming up with enough ideas\". She worked with the concept, however, expanding the storyline with elements of war, politics, revenge, doomed love, and religious conflict.\nAlthough the original plan was for a stand-alone novel, enough material was created for several books, and the publisher decided on a six-volume series. The first volume, Into the Wild, was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym \"Erin Hunter\" and was completed in about three months. Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details. Cherith Baldry joined the team to write the third book, Forest of Secrets. Later, after she wrote the first Warriors field guide, Tui Sutherland became the fourth author to use the pseudonym Erin Hunter.\nThe authors have named several other authors as sources of inspiration when writing the novels. In an online author chat, Cherith Baldry listed the authors that inspire her as including Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Shakespeare. In the same chat, Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson, Kathy Reichs, and J. K. Rowling are some of the authors that inspire her. According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton, Lucy Daniels, Ellis Peters, Tess Gerritsen, Kate Ellis, Lisa Gardiner, and Meg Cabot.\nThe authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The New Forest in southern England was the basis for the forest where the series takes place. Other influential locations include Loch Lomond, as well as the Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the Warriors series. His book, ''Culpeper's Herbal, is used as a source by the authors for the many herbal remedies that the cats use. The film series Rambo has also been cited as a source of inspiration.\nSetting and universe\nThe Warriors'' universe centers around a large group of feral cats who initially reside in a forest, and later, around a lake. The cats are split into five groups called Clans: ThunderClan, WindClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, and SkyClan. Each Clan has adapted to its own terrain. Relationships between different Clans are usually tense, and the Clans often come into conflict with one another. However, the Clans also sometimes show concern for each other; the idea of one Clan being destroyed usually causes deep distress and prompts urgent action on behalf of all Clans. The Clans have a unique naming and hierarchy system, in that their names are generally determined by their rank in the Clan.\nThe Clan cats have a faith system based on the concept of StarClan, a group of the spirits of the Clans' deceased ancestors, who occasionally provide guidance to the living Clan cats. After death, the spirits of most Clan cats join StarClan and reside in a paradisaical forest similar to Heaven. StarClan often provides guidance to the Clans through dreams and other signs like omens. In addition to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, also known as The Place of No Stars, which takes the form of a never-ending forest, similar to Hell. The spirits of cats who caused great pain and suffering to others while alive reside there as a form of punishment.\nCats who live outside of the Clans are categorized into three groups: housecats, who are called \"kittypets\" by Clan cats and are looked down upon for their cozy and lazy lifestyle; loners, who live outside of the Clans, usually by themselves; and rogues, who live on their own and intend to do harm to the Clans. In some instances, stray cats may form large groups of their own. It is rare for a stray cat to join a Clan, as outsiders are generally distrusted and scorned by Clan cats.\nSeries plot summaries\nWarriors: The Prophecies Begin (2003–2004)\nThe original Warriors series consists of six books: Into the Wild (21 January 2003), Fire and Ice (27 May 2003), Forest of Secrets (14 October 2003), Rising Storm (6 January 2004), A Dangerous Path (1 June 2004), and The Darkest Hour (5 October 2004).

One reviewer praised the authors for \"creating an intriguing world ... and an engaging young hero\". However, another criticized the characters and imagined world as being \"neither ... consistent nor compelling\".\nThe manga has also earned praise: a reviewer for ''Children's Bookwatch noted that Into the Woods \"ends on a tense cliffhanger, leaving the reader in anxious anticipation for more... Into the Woods... is especially recommended for cat lovers everywhere.\" Its sequel, Escape from the Forest, was also well reviewed: a reviewer for Publishers Weekly'' believed that girls would benefit from reading about Sasha leaving the powerful Tigerstar due to his \"growing violence\". The art was also praised, with the reviewer writing that \"Hudson's artwork brings Sasha's emotional journey to life, showing each moment of fear, anxiety, contentment, and joy. The cat's-eye perspective of many of the panels, in addition, add a dramatic, energizing element to the book.\" The reviewer also wrote that \"a twist at the end will leave fans eager for the next installment of Sasha's saga\", and that the book would appeal to young adults trying to find their place in the world. Lisa Goldstein for School Library Journal also gave the book a positive review, writing that the plot would attract new fans and appeal to old fans. The reviewer also wrote that \"though the cover claims that this is a 'manga,' the straightforward illustrations are drawn in a simple, realistic style.\"\nThe large number of characters involved in the series has often been seen as a negative point; though one reviewer compared the \"huge cast\" to that of a Greek drama, others wrote that it was \"hard to follow\" and \"a little confusing\". The characters have also been criticized as being \"somewhat flat\" and \"limited essentially to each individual's function within the Clan\".\nAs one reviewer put it, the cats in the series are \"true to their feline nature\", leading another to jokingly comment that the books will \"leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously\", and wondering \"what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat\". However, this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence, with one critic stating that it is \"not for the faint of heart\". Several critics have compared Warriors to Brian Jacques' Redwall series, though one commented that it was \"not as elegantly written\". The New York Times called the series a \"hit with young readers\", specifically because of its \"sprawling universe\", and the series appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list for a total of 117 weeks, as of 24 November 2013.\nAwards and recognitions\nInto the Wild was nominated for the Pacific Northwest Library Association's 2006 Young Reader's Choice Awards, but lost to Christopher Paolini's Eragon. It was also listed on Booklists Top 10 fantasy books for youth in 2003 and was a Book Sense 76 Pick. The Sight was nominated for the best Middle Readers book in Amazon's Best Books of the Year (2007) and placed sixth out of the ten nominees, with six percent of the total votes. It was also nominated for the Children's Choice Book Awards. In 2006, Warriors also received an honourable mention for the best book series for ''Publishers Weekly's'' \"On the Cuff\" awards.\nThemes\nHolmes has said that one of the good things about writing a book about cats is that \"we can tackle difficult human issues such as death, racial intolerance, and religious intolerance [without seeming so heavy]\".\nThe series often revolves around forbidden love. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons stated in the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series is \"faith and spirituality\" regarding StarClan. All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present. Thus, the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are \"equally valid\". This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes remarked that \"ignorance is a very scary thing!\" Non-belief is also explored in the storylines through characters who do not believe in StarClan.\nAnother theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil. Holmes has said she is fascinated by these \"shades of gray\" in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions. Another example she gave of this is how antagonist Tigerstar, even with all of his faults, is still courageous and fiercely loyal. Similarly, Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil. A third major theme is nature versus nurture. For example, Brambleclaw's father is the murderer Tigerstar, but Brambleclaw demonstrates that he is not evil himself, despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father's legacy.\nA reviewer for Publishers Weekly noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels, while another reviewer pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life. A Storysnoops reviewer noted that a theme enforced in Warriors is that \"it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside\". In Dawn, the importance of cooperation is explored. The four Clans, normally hostile to each other, are forced to work together in order to find a new home. Other themes include family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules.\nPublication history\nAll of the Warriors books except for the manga (excluding all manga published from A Shadow in RiverClan onwards) have been published as hardcovers, and the majority of them have also been published as paperbacks, audiobooks, and e-books. The New Prophecy's audiobooks are spoken by Nanette Savard, whose performance has been praised by reviewers. A reviewer for AudioFile wrote: \"Nanette Savard brings out the youth of the cats who are struggling to help their clan survive and to protect each other from outside danger\". The Omen of the Stars audiobooks are spoken by voice actress Veronica Taylor.\nForeign editions\nThe Warriors series was first published in the United States and United Kingdom. The editions published of the first two series—The Prophecies Begin and The New Prophecy—in the United Kingdom had slight variations in cover design from their United States counterparts. Warriors is also sold in New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. Translations into other languages such as Czech, Norwegian, Lithuanian, Finnish, Japanese, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, and Korean have also been published. The first six books have been published in Italy and Latin America, and the first five series in Germany and the Netherlands. Fans also exist in Trinidad and Singapore. Several series have been published in Poland as well.\nOther media\nWebsite\nThe Warriors website previously featured Warriors screensavers, videos on topics such as the process of writing a manga book, and quizzes. In addition, there were browser-based games including the New Prophecy Adventure and the Warriors Adventure Game. An additional game for the website was planned for release in 2010, but was never released despite a report of having completed first-round testing. It has been stated that there is no plan for an official video game, but if one were to be made, it would likely be based on a movie adaptation of the Warriors series. Many fans have resorted to making their own games and websites, many of these sites being play-by-post role-playing game forums. The website was later re-designed and is now accessible via both browsers and an official mobile application. Much of the old content was not carried over to the new version of the website, though two new games, several character profiles, and an updated version of the family tree have been added.\nFilm\nOn 20 October 2016, Victoria Holmes announced that Alibaba Pictures had bought the production rights for a film adaptation with David Heyman as producer, and a movie poster was released. On 14 May 2018, it was announced that STX Entertainment had come on board to co-produce the Warriors film, with STX board member Gigi Pritzker working alongside Heyman. It was also announced that screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger would write the screenplay for the movie.\nOn 25 January 2024, it was announced that Coolabi Group, which Working Partners is a part of, had signed a deal with Tencent Video to create an \"animation\" of Warriors.\nShort stories\nThe first short story published is \"Spottedleaf's Honest Answer\". On 20 January 2009, another short story, \"The Clans Decide\", was released on the Warriors Ultimate Leader Election site, starring Firestar, who won an election through an online fan vote conducted in recognition of US President Obama's Inauguration Day. Two short stories, \"After Sunset: The Right Choice?\" and \"The Elders' Concern\", were previously available through the defunct Warriors mobile application. In 2009, an educator's guide was released.\nPlays\nWritten by Victoria Holmes for a tour, a play titled After Sunset: We Need to Talk was first premiered on 28 April 2007 at the Secret Garden bookstore in Seattle, Washington. It details a meeting between Leafpool of ThunderClan and Crowfeather of WindClan after the events of Sunset. The script was released to the public on the old official site for the Warriors series.\nDuring a fundraising event in Russellville, Arkansas, ''Brightspirit's Mercy was performed by various high school drama students. The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, Brightspirit's Mercy is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. In the play, the characters go to a Gathering where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving. Three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, who were created in memory of a 10-year-old Warriors fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy, all three of whom were killed in a tornado in February 2007. They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans.\nPhysical media\nIn the Chinese translation of the series, \"3-D trading cards\" are packaged in each book. The 3-D effect is produced using stereoscopic lenticular printing. These cards feature pictures of various characters, their Chinese and English names, and biographical information. In 2019, when the official Warrior Cats Hub app was released, several pieces of official, licensed merchandise were released as well. This included posters, pins, bracelets, bookmarks, stationery, figurines, necklaces, bags, and shirts, among other things. Small plush heads and full-sized plush toys of various characters have also been produced.\nMobile application\nOn 30 June 2011, an official iOS application and Android application was released on the iTunes App Store and Google Play Store. It contained a multitude of information about the books, characters, and settings, as well as two exclusive short stories, a trivia game, and a list of all the Warriors books that had been released at that point. The app was eventually removed from the App Store. In 2019, an updated Warriors app was released, called Warrior Cats Hub. Through this app, one can access blogs and analyses written by the editors of the series, play games, shop for merchandise and books, browse fanart, participate in art challenges, and vote in polls, some of which affect the plot of the Warriors series.\nGames\nAn official Warriors roleplay Roblox'' game was released to the public on 7 May 2021 under the pillar of Coolabi Group's digital business, called Warrior Cats: Ultimate Edition. It has since become one of the highest-ranking branded games on the platform, and number two on the list of Top 10 Roblox Brand Games in July 2023, having been played more than 430 million times.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
