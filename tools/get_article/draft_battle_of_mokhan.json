The fall of Makhoni and other neighboring towns marked a turning point in the regional power balance, leading to increased Kabardian and Russian influence.\nHistory\nIn 1562, a joint force of Kabardians nobles, Nogai allies, and a Russian detachment under Grigory Pleshcheyev and Temryuk Idar conducted a military campaign in the central North Caucasus. Several Ingush settlements, including Makhoni, Engir, and Kavan, were captured. Russian sources report the towns were taken and tribute imposed. The campaign expanded Kabardian influence and marked early Russian involvement in the Caucasus.\nReferences"
