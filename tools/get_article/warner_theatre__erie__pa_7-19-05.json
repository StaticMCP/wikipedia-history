It was recorded on July 19, 2005, at the Warner Theatre in Erie, Pennsylvania.  It was released on October 16, 2020.  The album contains a complete concert performed by the 2001 to 2014 lineup of the band – Gregg Allman (keyboards, vocals), Warren Haynes (guitar, vocals), Derek Trucks (guitar), Oteil Burbridge (bass), Butch Trucks (drums), Jaimoe (drums), and Marc Quiñones (percussion, vocals).\nCritical reception\nIn Rock & Blues Muse, Mike O'Cull wrote, \"... the Warner Theatre show turned out to be the greatest Allman Brothers show you've never heard and is proof positive that even the musicians, themselves, never knew when the magic was going to happen.... The Allman Brothers Band’s rep as one of the best live bands the USA has ever produced will never be tarnished. Allman fans know the songs in this concert well but never tire of hearing them. Shows like this are the reason why.\"\nIn Jazz Weekly, George W. Harris wrote, \"The great thing about the latter period Allman Brothers is that, like the best of jazz bands, the song itself is not as important as the soloing, which changes from night to night. The guitar work by Trucks and Haynes is simply exhilarating, swirling like a tornado through a rural town, while the rhythm section is like a Class IV white water run on the Ocoee River.\"\nIn American Songwriter, Lee Zimmerman said, \"It's all exceptional of course, a truly stand-out performance, although Allmans enthusiasts might note that there's little here that hasn’t been heard before. On the other hand, like true [Grateful Dead] devotees, fans often compulsively collect repeated live performances taken from various venues. In the case of this Warner Theatre show, it can easily be considered among the band's very best.\"\nIn American Highways, John Apice wrote, \"Some believe this is one of the best Allman performances captured live.... Nothing sounds rehashed or reheated. This was the last and longest lineup. For Allman Brother fans and the newly curious – this is a meticulous set, well-recorded and performed without losing any of the enduring quality of what made the Allman Brothers a truly memorable, original and historic American band.\"\nTrack listing\nDisc 1\n:First set:\n#\"Mountain Jam\" (Donovan Leitch, Gregg Allman, Duane Allman, Dickey Betts, Jai Johanny Johanson, Berry Oakley, Butch Trucks) – 12:11\n#\"Statesboro Blues\" (Will McTell) – 5:16\n#\"Firing Line\" (G.
