      "text": "# List of Queen's Counsel in England and Wales appointed in 1951\n\nA '''Queen's Counsel (post-nominal QC), or King's Counsel (post-nominal KC''') during the reign of a king, is an eminent lawyer (usually a barrister or advocate) who is appointed by the monarch to be one of \"Her Majesty's Counsel learned in the law.\" The term is recognized as an honorific. Appointments are made from within the legal profession based on merit rather than a particular level of experience. Members have the privilege of sitting within the bar of court. As members wear silk gowns of a particular design (see court dress), appointment as Queen's Counsel is known informally as taking silk, and hence QCs are often colloquially called silks.\nThe rank emerged in the sixteenth century but came to prominence over the course of the nineteenth. An appointment was open to barristers only until 1995. The first women KCs had been appointed only in 1949. In 1951, 16 people were appointed, all of them men.\n1951\n3 April 1951\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"20%\" |Name\n! width=\"15%\" |Inns of Court\n! width=\"20%\" |University\n!Notes\n!Ref\n|- height=\"19\"\n| height=\"19\" |Sir Alan Edward Ellis, KCB\n|Inner Temple and Lincoln's Inn (1920)\n|Brasenose College, Oxford\n|Born in 1890, Ellis attended the independent Cheltenham College before university.

He grew up in Birmingham, attending King Edward's School there, before going up to Oxford. After being called to the bar in 1931, he joined Geoffrey Tyndale's chambers and was advised to change his name, adopting the more English-sounding Rawden Temple (formally in 1939). His growing practice was interrupted by service in the Second World War, as an officer in the Royal Artillery and the War Office. After the war, he enjoyed further success at the bar, practicing in the probate and divorce division. He was appointed Vice-Chairman of the General Council of the Bar in 1960, serving until 1964 (the same year he was appointed CBE). He had hoped to be appointed a High Court Judge, but never was, instead of becoming a National Insurance Commissioner in 1969 and then Chief National Insurance Commissioner in 1975; he retired in 1981, having been knighted in the previous year's Birthday Honours. He was Treasurer of the Inner Temple in 1983, having been a Bencher since 1960.

After Gresham's School, he went up to Cambridge to read English. His initial career at the bar was interrupted by wartime service in the Royal Tank Regiment, which included a period commanding a special service squadron in Operation Ironclad (1942), the Allied invasion of Vichy-France-controlled Madagascar. He was then posted to India and served in the Burma campaign, ending the war a Lieutenant-Colonel. Returning to the bar, he was often junior to Seymour Karminski, KC. In the 1951 general election, he successfully stood as the Conservative candidate for Middlesbrough West; shortly afterward, he was appointed PPS to the Attorney-General and three years later sat on the Percy Commission on mental health law, which eventually led to the Mental Health Act 1959. He was Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Home Office from 1957 to 1958 (helping to pass the Homicide Act 1957) and then Financial Secretary to the Treasury (1958–59), before he was appointed Solicitor-General and (by convention) knighted. He was, however, compelled to relinquish that office and his seat in the Commons in 1962 when he was appointed President of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division of the High Court. In 1971, he has created Baron Simon of Glaisdale, and later that year became a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. He retired in 1977 owing to poor health. Simon was especially concerned with family law; although generally liberal (and increasingly libertarian politically), he was conservative in his views about the family as an institution and about children's wellbeing, which he felt were being eroded by easier access to divorce. However, he also believed that women were often treated unfairly in divorce proceedings and he campaigned to have property and pensions divided more equally. He also firmly believed in the separation of the judicial and legislative branches of government, which led him to make conservative rulings even as he was involved in reform activities outside of court. His retirement from the judiciary allowed him to speak about legislative matters more frankly in the House of Lords, where he remained active until he gave his last speech in 2004; he was highly valued there for his legal expertise. He died in 2006; his wife and three children (including the judge Sir Peregrine Simon, QC) survived him.\n|S. M.

He practiced for only three years before the Second World War broke out and he served in the Royal Artillery with the Territorial Army. On demobilization, he resumed his legal career and was appointed Recorder of Blackpool in 1952, serving until 1960. He was also an appeal judge for the Isle of Man from 1956 to 1960. For the following seven years, he was Recorder of Manchester and was a Crown Court Judge there, before he was appointed a High Court Judge in 1967, taking the conventional knighthood that year. He retired in 1977 and died in 1985; he was survived by his wife and three children.\n|\n|- height=\"19\"\n| height=\"19\" |Sir Daniel James Brabin, MC\n|Inner Temple (1936)\n|Trinity College, Cambridge\n|Brabin was born in 1913 and educated at Douai School before he went up to Cambridge. A pupil of Lord Shawcross, his legal career was interrupted by service in the Royal Artillery during Second World War, wherein he earned the MC. He was appointed Recorder of Bolton in 1953, serving until 1962 when he became a High Court Judge and was given the conventional knighthood. In 1966 Brabin carried out an inquiry into the guilty verdict handed down to Timothy Evans, who had been hanged for the murder of his wife and daughter in 1950; the report found that Evans probably did not commit the murder and that his neighbor John Christie, who had subsequently been found to be a serial killer, most likely did. The report led to Evans being posthumously pardoned and the case generated much controversy about the use of the death penalty. Brabin died in 1975, while still a High Court Judge. He was survived by his wife.\n|\n|}\nSource: [https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/39190/page/1757/data.pdf The London Gazette], 3 April 1951 (no. 39190), p.&nbsp;1757.\nReferences"
