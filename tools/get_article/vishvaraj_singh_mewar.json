He was elected as MLA from Nathdwara constituency.\nPersonal life\nHe is married to Mahima Kumari Mewar, a royal family member and the daughter of Vidya Devi of Bandhi Talukdari (Madhya Pradesh) and Jagdishwari Prasad Singh Deo of Panchkote. She also supports him in canvassing. They have two children, one daughter named Baisa Jayati Kumari and a son named Devajaditya Singh.\nHe did his schooling from Ajmer and went to Mumbai for completing college studies and settled there in Mewar House. He has been visiting Udaipur frequently.\nPolitical life\nHis father, Mahendra Singh Mewar, made his electoral debut with the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 1989 Lok Sabha elections. He later joined Indian National Congress, after which he lost the 1991 Lok Sabha elections in Chittorgarh and 1996 Lok Sabha elections in Bhilwara.\nHis maternal grandfather Manabendra Shah, was an eight-time Member of Parliament from Tehri Garhwal and also a member of Bharatiya Janata Party.\nHe is the grandson of Bhagwat Singh of Mewar, the last Maharana of Mewar, and descendant of Rajput warrior Maharana Pratap.\nHis father Mahendra and his uncle Arvind both are claiming to be 76th custodian of the House of Mewar. The matter is currently sub judice. The Royal Family of Udaipur (former Maharanas) were not direct rulers rather they were considered as custodians of the kingdom of Mewar on behalf of Eklingji (form of Shiva).\nHe defeated incumbent C.P. Joshi, five-term incumbent MLA  and former Speaker of the Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha.\nHe is an MLA from Nathdwara constituency in 16th Rajasthan Assembly. This is his electoral debut and re-entry of his family into Bharatiya Janata Party after 3 decades. His entry in Bharatiya Janata Party is attributed to Diya Kumari, Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan.\nHe had written to PM Narendra Modi and the CBFC in 2017 to stop the release of Bhansali's Padmaavat movie to prevent inaccurate portrayal of history and hurting of public sentiments. He had also written to the PM, S Jaishankar (Minister of External Affairs), and G Kishan Reddy (Minister for Tourism) with respect to the consent not being taken for their disputed property being used in G20 Summit.\nReferences"
