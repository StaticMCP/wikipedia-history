This may include a process done within the country or one between Australia and another country.\nInterstate extradition\nThe Commonwealth Parliament has concurrent power with the states to make laws for the extradition of persons between and among the Australian states. The power is conferred by s 51(xxiv) of the Australian Constitution which says that the Commonwealth Parliament shall, subject to the Constitution, have the power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to (inter alia):\nthe service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States.\nIn respect of Australian territories, the power is exclusive.\nInterstate extradition procedures are governed by Part 5 of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 (Cth), which provides that a person named in an extradition warrant issued in any state may be arrested in accordance with that warrant in another state. Upon apprehension, that person must be brought before a magistrate of the state in which they were apprehended along with the warrant or a copy of the warrant. The local jurisdiction has priority in respect of offences committed in that jurisdiction so that a person charged or in prison in the jurisdiction must be processed and serve time before extradition to the other state.\nInternational extradition\nThe Extradition Act 1988 sets out the requirements that must be met before Australia can make or accept an extradition request, which may be supplemented or varied by requirements contained in a multilateral or bilateral treaty. One of the requirements is that the offence in the other country is not minor. The Act also ratifies a number of treaties to which Australia is a party, either in the right of the Commonwealth of Australia, by being bound by treaties which the United Kingdom executed on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, or multilateral treaties to which Australia is a signatory. Australian law also prohibits anyone from being extradited to another country if they could face the death sentence in the requesting country.\nThe absence of an extradition treaty does not, in theory, prevent the arrest or extradition to or from another country e.g. through the London Scheme for Commonwealth member states, or through regulation (e.g., Cambodia). Extradition between Australia and New Zealand is governed by a separate and distinct regime, known as the \"backing of warrants\" system.\nThe federal Attorney-General's Department is Australia's central authority for international extradition matters, except that extradition between Australia and New Zealand is administered by police forces and prosecuting authorities in Australia and New Zealand.\nMap of Countries\nCommonwealth of Australia (shown in purple) has extradition treaties with the countries shown in blue.
