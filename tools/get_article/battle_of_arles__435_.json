The Visigoths and the Romans had previously been in peace after having fought each other at Arles in 425, but in 435 the Visigothic king Theodoric I again broke the peace treaty and invaded Gaul, laying siege to Arles once more. He was however defeated and driven away by the Romans under the leadership of  Flavius Aetius and his largely Hunnic army. Two years later, Theodoric was defeated at a decisive battle at Narbonne.\nSources\n*"
