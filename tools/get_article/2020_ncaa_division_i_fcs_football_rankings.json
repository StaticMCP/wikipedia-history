Unlike the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), college football's governing body, the NCAA, bestows the national championship title through a 24-team tournament. The following weekly polls determine the top 25 teams at the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision level of college football for the 2020 season. The STATS poll is voted by media members while the Coaches' Poll is determined by coaches at the FCS level.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|+ Legend\n|-\n| style=\"background:#bbffbb;
