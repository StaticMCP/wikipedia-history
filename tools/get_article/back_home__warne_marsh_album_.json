      "text": "# Back Home (Warne Marsh album)\n\nBack Home, is an album by saxophonist Warne Marsh, recorded in 1986 and released on the Dutch Criss Cross Jazz label.\nReception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1Score =\n}}\nThe AllMusic review states that \"the tenor master and Tristano disciple works through a set of tunes that, in true Tristano fashion, are built entirely upon the harmonic foundations of popular standards... Marsh's peculiar linear logic and behind-the-beat phrasing are the aural equivalent of well-aged scotch, and his rapport with Barry Harris represents a felicitous union of straight bebop and one of its most enigmatic tributaries, the Tristano school\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by Warne Marsh except where noted\n# \"Leave Me\" (Lennie Tristano) – 5:16\n# \"See Me Now, If You Could\" – 5:41\n# \"Two Not One\" (Tristano) – 5:08\n# \"Big Leaps for Lester\" – 4:57\n# \"Back Home\" (Tristano) – 8:04\n# \"Heads Up\" – 5:31\n# \"Good Bait\" (Tadd Dameron, Count Basie) – 8:11\n# \"Rhythmically Speaking\" – 4:31\n# \"Joy Spring\" (Clifford Brown) – 7:26\n# \"Big Leaps for Lester\" [alternate take] – 4:43 Bonus track on CD reissue\n# \"Good Bait\" [alternate take] (Dameron, Basie) – 6:34 Bonus track on CD reissue\n# \"Back Home\" [alternate take] (Tristano) – 4:48 Bonus track on CD reissue\nPersonnel\n*Warne Marsh, Jimmy Halperin (tracks 1, 3, 5 & 12) – tenor saxophone\n*Barry Harris – piano\n*David Williams – bass\n*Albert Heath – drums\nReferences"
