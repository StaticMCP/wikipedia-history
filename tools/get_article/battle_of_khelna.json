Mughal emperor Aurangzeb ordered for the Fort of Khelna to be besieged. Mughal general Asad Khan launched an offensive and besieged the fortress. After about a three-month siege, Maratha commander, Parashurampant surrendered under the condition that he and his garrison would be allowed to march out unharmed.\nReferences"
