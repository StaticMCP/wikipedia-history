The club is based in the regional Victorian city of Warrnambool and has played in the Hampden Football League since 1933.\nHistory\nBelieved to have formed in 1902, the club initially played in the Warrnambool District Football Association competition in 1904 against Allensford, Rainbow and West End. In 1918, South Warrnambool and Railways Football Club merged and won the Warrnambool District Football Association premiership, defeating Koroit. In 1919 and 1920, Roy Cazaly coached South Warrnambool side during the finals series. It was Cazaly who saw the immense talent in Colin Watson and enticed him to try out with the St. Kilda Football Club.\nWhen the Warrnambool DFA decided to merge with the Corangamite FA to form the Western District Football Association in 1924, South Warrnambool merged with Warrnambool City to form the Warrnambool Football Club. The newly-merged club, “Warrnambool”, won the inaugural flag. Three years later, in 1927, South Warrnambool reformed as a standalone club to provide stronger opposition to the Warrnambool team and entered the Western District Football Association.\nThe admission of Hamilton into the Western District FA in 1926, caused additional traveling costs and problems with extra time away from home. In 1926, Camperdown members joined the Colac Football Association, only to rejoin the Western District FA after a couple of seasons. In 1928, the league played zone football, a fixture for eastern clubs and one for the western clubs, with finals between the top clubs at the end of the year.\nIn 1930, delegates voted to end zone football and have just one fixture covering all clubs. The Hampden Football League was formed in 1930, when the four founding clubs broke away from the Western District FL. Terang and Camperdown did not want to continue to travel to Hamilton because their players were farmers who could not spend all day away from the farm to play football. Mortlake agreed with Camperdown and Terang and resigned from the WDFL; Cobden requested admittance to the new league. The Western District FL countered by admitting Portland to the competition in 1930. This incurred extra travelling costs and it was noticeable that gate takings were down.\nSouth Warrnambool were runners up in 1931 and again in 1932 in the Western District Football Association. In 1933, South Warrnambool and Warrnambool joined the Hampden Football League, as takings at the gate had been greater when playing Camperdown or Terang that against any team in the WDFL.\nFootball Competitions Timeline\n*1902 to 1903 – SWFC established.
