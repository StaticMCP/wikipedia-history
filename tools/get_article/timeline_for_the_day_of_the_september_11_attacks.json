Instant worldwide reaction and debate were made possible by round-the-clock television news organizations and by the internet. As a result, most of the events were known by a large portion of the world's population as they occurred.\nThe attacks themselves lasted less than two hours; the first hijacking commenced at approximately 8:14 am, and the final hijacked plane crashed at 10:03 am. All times given are in Eastern Daylight Time, (UTC−04:00).\nMajor events\n7:59&nbsp;a.m.: American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 with registration number N334AA, carrying 76 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are on board. Hijacker and ringleader Mohamed Atta would pilot the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.\n8:14: United Airlines Flight 175, a Boeing 767, with registration number N612UA carrying 56 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and 9 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston, bound for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are on board. Lead hijacker-pilot Marwan al-Shehhi would pilot the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.\n8:14: Flight 11 is hijacked over central Massachusetts, turning first northwest, then south heading straight to New York.\n8:20: American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with registration number N644AA with 58 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and 6 crew members, departs 10 minutes late from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are on board. Lead hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour will pilot the plane into the West side of The Pentagon.\n8:42: United Airlines Flight 93, a Boeing 757 with registration number N591UA with 37 passengers (excluding the hijackers) and 7 crew members, departs 42 minutes late from Newark International Airport (later Newark Liberty International Airport), bound for San Francisco International Airport. Four hijackers are on board. Lead hijacker-pilot is Ziad Jarrah. At this time, Flight 175 is being hijacked and Flight 11 is about to descend to New York and is 4 minutes away from crashing.\n8:42–8:46 (approx.): Flight 175 is hijacked above northwest New Jersey, about  northwest of New York City, continuing southwest briefly before turning back to the northeast. At this time estimate, Flight 11 is about to descend over New York and is just minutes away from crashing.\n8:46:40: Flight 11 crashes into the north face of the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 93 and 99. All passengers aboard are instantly killed with an unknown number inside the building. The aircraft enters the tower on impact.\n8:50–8:54 (approx.): Flight 77 is hijacked above southern Ohio, turning to the southeast. The transponder is turned off by hijacker-pilot Hani Hanjour.\n9:03:00: Flight 175 crashes into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85. All passengers and crew are killed together with an unknown number inside the building. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the building from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away.\n9:28: Flight 93 is hijacked above northern Ohio, turning to the southeast.\n9:37:46: Flight 77 crashes into the western side of The Pentagon. All 58 passengers and crew were killed aboard the aircraft, as well as an additional 125 (including emergency workers) on the ground. The crash starts a violent fire.\n9:45: United States airspace is shut down by the Federal Aviation Administration; all operating aircraft are ordered to land at the nearest airport, and international flights are not permitted into the airspace.\n9:57: The passengers aboard Flight 93 begin a revolt, planned by Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham, Tom Burnett, Jeremy Glick, and others, moving against the hijackers in an attempt to take back the plane.\n9:59:00: The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 56 minutes after the impact of Flight 175. Impact speed of the plane is considered one of the likely factors of the shorter amount of time between impact and collapse than that of the North Tower.\n10:03:11: Flight 93 is crashed by its hijackers as a result of fighting in the cockpit  southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes and were resisting the hijackers. The 9/11 Commission believed that Flight 93's target was either the United States Capitol building or the White House in Washington, D.C. but Khalid Sheikh Mohammed claims that the United States Capitol was the main target.\n10:15: All five stories of the Pentagon on the West side where American 77 crashed collapse due to the fire started by the crash.\n10:28:25: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 1 hour and 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed.\n5:20:33&nbsp;p.m.: 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story building, collapses after fires started inside the building.\nDetailed timeline of events\n5:00 a.m.\n5:01: Ziad Jarrah in Newark calls Marwan al-Shehhi in Boston; this call was most likely to confirm the hijackers were ready to carry out the attacks.\n5:33: Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari check out of their room at a Comfort Inn in South Portland, Maine, and leave the hotel to drive their rental car to nearby Portland International Jetport.\n5:43: Atta and al-Omari check in at the US Airways counter at Portland International Jetport, receiving their boarding passes for Colgan Air Flight 5930 to Boston Logan International Airport in Massachusetts. Atta asks for their boarding passes for their connecting flight, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles International Airport, as well. Ticket agent Mike Tuohey informs Atta that the pair will need to check in again upon arrival in Boston to receive their second boarding passes. Tuohey would later recall that Atta appeared angry when told of this, leading him to briefly worry that the pair could be terrorists before they moved on.\n5:45: Atta and al-Omari pass through security at Portland International Jetport, consisting of a walk-through metal detector and an X-ray screener for bags. Atta is randomly selected by the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), requiring his checked bags to undergo extra screening for explosives, but does not receive any additional scrutiny himself.\n6:00 a.m.\n6:00: Colgan Air Flight 5930 departs from Portland with Atta and al-Omari on board.\n6:00: Polls open for primaries for the New York City mayoral elections, as well as other local offices.\n6:15: Hamza al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi arrive at Boston Logan International Airport by taxi, having stayed the night at a Days Inn in Brighton, Massachusetts.\n6:20: The al-Ghamdi brothers check in at the United Airlines ticket counter. Both men were reportedly confused by the standard security questions they were asked, but they received their boarding passes without incident.\n6:22: Nawaf al-Hazmi and several men who have not been conclusively identified check out of the Residence Inn by Marriott in Herndon, Virginia.\n6:31: President George W. Bush goes for an early-morning jog around the Colony Beach and Tennis Resort in Longboat Key, Florida, where he and his staff had spent the night.\n6:45: Colgan Air Flight 5930 arrives at Logan International Airport, and Atta and al-Omari deplane. Separately, Satam al-Suqami, Waleed al-Shehri, and Wail al-Shehri arrive at Logan in their own rental car at the same time.\n6:48: Jarrah checks out of the Days Inn in Newark, New Jersey.\n6:52: Al-Shehhi calls Atta's cell phone from a payphone in Logan's Terminal C to confirm that the plans for the attacks are set.\n7:00 a.m.\n7:04–7:40: Jarrah and his hijacking team arrive at Newark International Airport (now Newark Liberty International Airport) and check in for United Airlines Flight 93.\n7:15: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed arrive at Washington Dulles International Airport and check-in for American Airlines Flight 77.\n7:18: Al-Mihdhar and Moqed arrive at the security checkpoint at Washington Dulles International Airport. Both set off alarms and are consequently given a more thorough search.\n7:23–7:28: Al-Shehhi and his hijacking team board Flight 175.\n7:35–7:40: Atta and his hijacking team board Flight 11.\n7:35: Hani Hanjour arrives at the security checkpoint at Washington Dulles International Airport. He passes through the checkpoint without suspicion or setting off any alarms.\n7:39–7:48: Jarrah and his hijacking team board Flight 93.\n7:40: Flight 11 is pushed back from Gate B32 at Logan International Airport.\n7:50: Hanjour and his four fellow hijackers board Flight 77.\n7:58: United Airlines Flight 175 is pushed back from Gate C19 at Logan International Airport.\n7:59: Flight 11, a Boeing 767 carrying 81 passengers and 11 crew members, departs 14 minutes late from Logan International Airport in Boston. Its destination is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in Los Angeles, California.\n8:00 a.m.\n8:00: President Bush has his daily intelligence briefing. The material is routine, mostly concerning the Al-Aqsa Intifada and other Israeli-Palestinian issues. He calls Condoleezza Rice about one item, but there is no mention in the report of Osama bin Laden or al-Qaeda, nor are there any final warnings about the terrorist plot now actively in motion. The briefing lasts about twenty minutes, after which he says goodbye to the resort staff and departs in his motorcade. As the President's scheduled event is considered a garden variety trip to promote his education agenda, accompanied by low-level aides and reporters, Chief of Staff Andrew Card remarks to him \"It should be an easy day.\"\n8:01: United Airlines Flight 93 is pushed back from Gate A17 at Newark International Airport.\n8:09: Flight 77 is pushed back from Gate D26 at Dulles International Airport.\n8:13–8:20: Flight 11 is hijacked. Waleed and Wail al-Shehri rise from seats 2A and 2B and stab flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui. Atta rises from seat 8D and approaches the cockpit. Passenger Daniel Lewin rises from seat 9B and tries to stop Atta but is fatally stabbed by hijacker Satam al-Suqami, who sat in 10B. The hijackers also spray Mace in the first and business class cabins, forcing everyone in those sections to vacate to the back of the airplane. Flight attendant Madeline Amy Sweeney reports being shown a bomb by one of the hijackers.\n8:13:35: Flight 11 has its last routine communication with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (hereinafter \"Boston Center\").\nBoston Center: American 11, turn twenty degrees right.\nAmerican Airlines Flight 11: Turning right, American 11.\n8:13:52: Boston Center Sector 46 controller Pete Zalewski instructs Flight 11 to climb to 35,000 feet twice, but receives no reply. He informs the Athens Sector controller that the flight is \"NORDO\" (no radio). Boston Center continues to attempt to re-establish contact with the flight without success.\n8:14: Flight 175, another fully fueled Boeing 767, carrying 56 passengers and nine crew members, also departs from Logan International Airport in Boston; its destination is also Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard. One of them, most likely al-Shehhi, communicated with Mohamed Atta shortly before American Airlines Flight 11's takeoff.\n8:19: Betty Ong, a flight attendant on Flight 11, alerts an American Airlines reservations center in Cary, North Carolina, to the hijacking via an airphone: \"[I'm] number 3 in the back. The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class—and I think there's Mace—that we can't breathe—I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\" She then tells of the stabbings of two flight attendants.\n8:20: Flight 77, a Boeing 757 with 58 passengers and six crew members, departs from Washington Dulles International Airport, for Los Angeles International Airport. Five hijackers are aboard.\n8:21: Flight 11's transponder signal is turned off, but the flight can still be tracked via primary radar by Boston Center; prior to the 9/11 Commission's report, news organizations reported this time as 8:13 or immediately thereafter.\n8:24: Boston Center receives a radio transmission from Flight 11. Atta is heard saying \"Eh..... We have some planes. Just stay quiet, and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport.\" It is believed that Atta mistakenly held a button directing his voice to radio rather than to the plane's cabin as he intended. A few seconds later, a second transmission is received, in which Atta says \"Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.\" This leads Boston Center flight controllers to conclude that Flight 11 has probably been hijacked.\n8:26:30: Flight 11 makes a 100-degree turn to the south, following the Hudson River toward New York City.\n8:29:24: Boston Center alerts the neighboring Cleveland and New York ARTCCs regarding Flight 11. The flight's position is estimated to be  southwest of Albany. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is not yet alerted.\n8:33: Flight 175 reaches its assigned cruising altitude of 31,000 feet.\n8:33:59: A third transmission from Atta onboard Flight 11: \"Nobody move, please. We are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves.\"\n8:34: Boston Center traffic manager Dan Bueno notifies the tower controller at Otis Air National Guard Base at Cape Cod of the hijacking of Flight 11. The controller directs Bueno to contact Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS), the northeast sector of NORAD. The controller then notifies Otis Operations Center that a call from NEADS might be coming. Two F-15 pilots begin to suit up.\n8:37: Flight 175 confirms sighting of hijacked Flight 11 to flight controllers,  to its south.\n8:37:30: Flight 11 begins a rapid descent at 3,200 feet per minute, starting from an altitude of 29,000 feet. This descent continues until the moment of impact with the North Tower. Half a minute later, having descended one thousand feet, the flight makes a slight southward turn.\n8:37:52: Boston Center control notifies NEADS of the hijacking of Flight 11, the first notification received by NORAD of a hijacking that morning. The controller requests military help to intercept the jetliner. As NEADS is running a training exercise at that point, it inquires as to the veracity of the request, with Boston Center responding that it is \"not an exercise, not a test.\"\nThe World Trade Center towers seen from the cockpit of an aircraft over the Hudson River. American Airlines Flight 11 was traveling in roughly the same direction the camera is facing before it crashed.\n8:41: The FAA's New York Center requests information about Flight 11 over the radio. Flight 175 responds: \"We heard a suspicious transmission on our departure out of Boston with someone, [it] sounded like someone keyed the mic and said: 'everyone stay in your seats'\". New York Center acknowledges and says it will pass the information on.\n8:41: NEADS drives two fighter pilots at Otis Air National Guard Base to battle stations.\n8:42: Flight 93, a Boeing 757, takes off with 37 passengers and seven crew members from Newark International Airport (now Newark Liberty International Airport), bound for San Francisco International Airport, following a 42-minute delay due to congested runways. Four hijackers are aboard. Its flight path initially takes it close to the World Trade Center, which is within four minutes of being struck, before moving away westbound. All four planes are now in the air.\n8:42–8:46 (approx.): In the skies over northern New Jersey, Flight 175 is hijacked. Most likely, two of the \"muscle hijackers\", Fayez Banihammad and Mohand al-Shehri, make the first moves, stabbing a flight attendant and then storming the cockpit, killing both pilots. Hamza al-Ghamdi and Ahmed al-Ghamdi then order remaining passengers and crew to the back of the plane, allowing their leader, Marwan al-Shehhi, to take control.\n8:43:30: While descending at 10,000 feet, Flight 11 makes a final turn, turning south-southwestward towards New York City, aiming for the World Trade Center.\n8:44–8:46: Flight attendant Amy Sweeney, aboard Flight 11, reports by telephone to Michael Woodward at the American Airlines Flight Services Office in Boston, \"Something is wrong. We are in a rapid descent. We are all over the place.\" A minute later, Woodward asks her to \"describe what she sees out the window\". She responds, \"I see the water. I see the buildings. I see buildings.\" After a short pause, she reports, \"We are flying low. We are flying very, very low. We are flying way too low.\" Seconds later she says, \"Oh, my God, we are way too low.\" The call ends with a burst of very loud, sustained static. At the same time, Betty Ong's call with the American Airlines reservation office in Cary, North Carolina and operations center in Fort Worth, Texas is also cut off, and attempts to reestablish contact with her are in vain, assuming the worst has happened.\nimpacted the North Tower]]\n8:46: NIST reports 8:46:30 a.m., and some other sources claim 8:46:26 a.m.}} Flight 11 crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.  The plane plows almost directly midway into the North Tower's central core at roughly , while striking the center of the north face between floors 93 and 99. Hundreds are killed instantly, including everyone on the plane and untold others inside the North Tower. The impact gouges a plane-shaped hole spanning nearly the width of the skyscraper and triggers an explosion that can be seen and heard for miles. At least 166 windows are broken in the North Tower. The blast also shatters windows in the adjacent South Tower as its western and northern facades are battered by debris. Sweltering heat is felt by South Tower occupants across from the burning floors, and the smoke, blowing southeast, seeps into the building through air vents. Additionally, Flight 11's explosion sends ignited jet fuel pouring down through various passages in the North Tower, causing fatal injuries nearly a hundred floors below when a fireball sweeps through the main lobby. Severed water pipes, collapsed walls, dislodged ceiling tiles and severed electrical wires are reported from the lobby to the 92nd floor. All three stairwells from the roof to the ground (labeled A, B and C) are clustered together in the impact region, with just  of space between each one. The impact of the plane, given its size, instantly severs all three, rendering escape from the impact zone or above impossible. The 92nd floor, though technically the last floor below the impact zone, is also cut off from the rest of the tower due to the stairwells being blocked by debris from Flight 11's impacted 93rd through 99th floors immediately above and the elevators being destroyed or inoperable from the 50th floor upward. People in the North Tower below the impact zone, as well as in the South Tower, start to evacuate.\nBBC correspondent Stephen Evans was sitting in the foyer of the South Tower and described hearing a \"huge bang like somebody dropped a skip full of rubbish\" followed by \"two or three similar huge explosions\", as the South Tower shook. French filmmaker Jules Naudet and Czech immigrant Pavel Hlava videotape the crash of Flight 11 with their video cameras from different locations. A camera belonging to local New York television station WNYW captures the sound of the approaching airplane and the crash. While the impact is not seen directly, it generates a weak electromagnetic pulse that causes the WNYW camera's video signal to drop out for a small fraction of a second. The camera begins recording an image of the North Tower on fire approximately 13 seconds after the initial impact.\n, who made the first fire department radio message advising the FDNY Manhattan Fire Dispatch Office of the crash.]]\n8:46:43: Chief of the New York City Fire Department's 1st Battalion, Joseph W. Pfeifer, makes the first fire department radio message advising the FDNY Manhattan Fire Dispatch Office of the crash. Chief Pfeifer and personnel from other fire companies were several blocks north, on the corner of Church Street and Lispenard Street investigating an odor of gas in the street, and witnessed the attack, along with Jules Naudet, who was accompanying the firefighters at the time:\nBattalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): Battalion 1 to Manhattan.\nManhattan Dispatch: Battalion 1, K [go ahead].\nBattalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): We just had a plane crash into the upper floor of the World Trade Center. Transmit a 2nd Alarm and start relocating companies into the area.\nManhattan Dispatch: 10-4 [message received], Battalion 1.\n8:46:48: Two F-15 fighter jets are ordered to scramble from Otis Air National Guard Base, intended to intercept Flight 11.\nSergeant Jeremy W. Powell: This is HUNTRESS with an active air defense scramble for Panta 45, 46, time 12:46, authenticate delta x-ray. Scramble immediately, Panta 45, 46, heading 280, flight level 290, contact HUNTRESS on frequency 228.9, back-up 364.2. All parties acknowledge with initials.\nBecause Flight 11's transponder is off, the pilots do not know the location of their target. When Flight 11 crashed, its track disappeared from radar. NEADS spends the next several minutes watching their radar screens in anticipation of Flight 11 returning a radar contact. However, unknown to NEADS at the time, Flight 11 has already impacted the North Tower. NEADS will not become aware of the crash at the World Trade Center until 8:50 am.\n8:48:08: WNYW breaks into a Paramount Pictures movie trailer for Zoolander to make the first broadcast report of an incident at the World Trade Center, less than two minutes after Flight 11's crash. One of the station's camera crews, already out on location at City Hall Park that morning for New York's mayoral primary election, takes the first live pictures of black smoke coming from the North Tower. As these pictures are broadcast, the voice of reporter Dick Oliver is heard as he reports from the scene to anchor Jim Ryan, who was not in the studio at the time:\nThree minutes later, Jim Ryan corrected the location of the first plane crash from the South Tower to the North Tower.\n8:48:29: The first radio report of the incident is heard on WCBS-AM through traffic reporter Tom Kaminski. WCBS' traffic reports are delivered every ten minutes \"on the 8s\", meaning that Kaminski's traffic report was to come within two minutes of the initial impact of Flight 11 (although there is no record of how much time actually passed). At the time Kaminski was in \"Chopper 880\", WCBS' helicopter that he reports from for morning and evening rush hour traffic reports. The following consists of WCBS anchor Pat Carroll crossing to Kaminski in the chopper before he files his report.\nPat Carroll: WCBS news time, 8:48, it's traffic and weather together sponsored by Henry Miller's Theatre. Tom Kaminski, Chopper 880.\nTom Kaminski: Alright uh, Pat, we are just currently getting a look at the World Trade Center, We have something that has happened here at the World Trade Center. We noticed flame and an awful lot of smoke from one of the towers of the World Trade Center. We are just coming up on this scene, this is easily three-quarters of the way up. We are… This is… Whatever has occurred has just occurred, uh, within minutes and, uh, we are trying to determine exactly what that is. But currently we have a lot of smoke at the top of the towers of the World Trade Center, we will keep you posted.\n8:49: The first report of an incident at the World Trade Center crosses the Associated Press newswire.\n8:49:03: Local New York public radio station WNYC host Mark Hilan broadcasts the station's first report of the incident.\nCNN breaking the news of a plane crash at the World Trade Center\n8:49:34: The first network television and radio reports of an explosion or incident at the World Trade Center. CNN breaks into a Ditech commercial at 8:49. The CNN screen subtitle first reads \"WORLD TRADE CENTER DISASTER\". Carol Lin, the first TV network anchor to break the news of the attacks, says:\nJust a minute later, Sean Murtagh, CNN vice president of finance, in an on-air phone call, says from his office in the CNN New York bureau that a large passenger commercial jet was seen to hit the World Trade Center. The first email bulletins of breaking news from CNN and MSNBC report \"fire at tower of World Trade Center\". Both CNN and MSNBC's websites receive such heavy traffic that many of their web servers fail under the strain of the vast amounts of traffic. BBC News web servers remain operational, and their website shows a picture of the North Tower on fire. Minutes later, email news bulletins revise the reports of fire to a plane crash.\n8:50: NEADS is notified that a plane has struck the World Trade Center as its on-duty personnel continue to try to locate Flight 11 on radar.\n8:50: FDNY 1st Battalion chief Joseph Pfeifer is the first fire chief to enter the World Trade Center after the North Tower impact. He is joined by several FDNY companies on entry as he starts setting up command in the tower.\n8:50: Local New York radio station WOR news anchor Ed Walsh makes the station's first on-air report of the incident.\n8:50: WCBS-TV in New York breaks away from the CBS network to cover the attack, with anchor Mike Pomeranz providing the station's first report.\n8:50: On CNBC's Squawk Box, host Mark Haines is interviewing a mutual fund portfolio manager, Bill Nygren of the Oakmark Select Fund, when he sees pictures of the burning North Tower. \"Is that the World Trade Tower?\" he asks. His on-air colleague Joe Kernen tells him that a plane had hit the tower.  CNBC is the first NBC outlet to begin reporting on the disaster.\n8:50: Local New York cable television channel NY1 anchor Pat Kiernan begins the channel's coverage of the incident.\n8:50: Local New York radio station WABC news anchor George Weber broadcasts the station's first report of the incident.\n8:50–8:54 (approx.): As it nears the border of West Virginia and Ohio, Flight 77 is hijacked. But unlike the other hijackings in which they killed members of the flight crew, the pilots of Flight 77 are sent to the back of the aircraft with all the other passengers and crew while Hani Hanjour takes the controls.\n8:50:07: The traffic management units for Boston Center and New York Center state that they have both lost the primary target that they were tracking, referring to Flight 11. Roughly a minute later, New York Center passes on information supplied by Kennedy Tower about a fire at the World Trade Center.\nNew York Center: Kennedy Tower reports...you serious? Kennedy Tower reports that there was a fire at the World Trade Center. And that's, ah, that's the area where we lost the airplane.\n8:50:47: Local New York television station WNBC breaks away from the NBC network to begin its coverage of the attack, with anchor Jane Hanson providing the station's initial report.\n8:51–10:28:}} With Flight 11 leaving more than a thousand people still alive but trapped in the top 18 floors of the now-burning North Tower, some 100–200 people plummet from the skyscraper. Most of the victims witnessed falling are left with no choice but to take their own lives by jumping to escape the heat, smoke, and flames, although some of the falls are accidents caused by people losing their grip or balance. No form of airborne evacuation is attempted as smoke is too dense for a successful landing on the roof of either tower.\n8:51: ABC, the first terrestrial television network to break news of the attack, was airing Good Morning America in the eastern half of the country at the time. After returning from a commercial break, WABC-TV in New York breaks away from the ABC network, with anchor Steve Bartelstein beginning the station's own local coverage of the disaster, while on the network, GMA host Diane Sawyer makes this statement:\nWe want to tell you what we know, as we know it, but we just got a report in that there's been some sort of explosion at the World Trade Center in New York City.\nOne report said, and we can't confirm any of this, that a plane may have hit one of the two towers of the World Trade Center, but again, you are seeing the live pictures here. We have no further details than that. We don't know anything about what they have concluded happened there this morning. But we're going to find out, and of course, make sure that everybody knows on the air.\nCoverage of the incident began on the rest of the ABC network a minute later.\n8:51: Matt Lauer, co-host of NBC News' Today, interrupts an interview with author Richard Hack and says to the audience, \"We wanna go live right now, and show you a picture of the World Trade Center, where I understand... Do we have it?\" However, NBC did not immediately have the picture ready and went to a regularly scheduled commercial break. They return with a shot of the burning tower.\n8:51: GloboNews anchor Leila Sterenberg makes the first Brazilian television report of the first plane crash.\n8:51: A flight controller at the FAA's New York Center notices that Flight 175 had changed its transponder code twice four minutes earlier; he tries to contact the flight. Another flight in the area, Delta Air Lines Flight 1489, reports the sight of smoke coming from lower Manhattan to New York Center. This is the first word any pilots in flight receive of the incident.\n8:51: New York City's Amateur Radio Emergency Service net is activated, with ham operators in the area assisting with emergency communications.\n8:51:34: WINS-AM interrupts its 8:51 traffic report and anchor James Faherty relays word of the crash of Flight 11 to the listening audience, with the station having been notified by one of its employees who lives near the site.\n8:52: Lee Hanson receives a phone call from his son, Peter, a passenger on United 175, who says: \"I think they've taken over the cockpit—an attendant has been stabbed—and someone else up front may have been killed. The plane is making strange moves. Call United Airlines—tell them it's Flight 175, Boston to LA.\" Also on board Flight 175, a flight attendant calls a United Airlines office in Chicago, reporting that the flight had been hijacked, both pilots had been killed, a flight attendant had been stabbed, and the hijackers were probably flying the plane.\n8:52: The F-15s at Otis Air National Guard Base are airborne. Still lacking an intercept vector to Flight 11 (and not aware that it has already crashed), they are sent to military controlled airspace off Long Island and ordered to remain in a holding pattern until between 9:09 and 9:13.\n8:52: Anchor Chris Jansing makes the first announcement on MSNBC of a plane crash into the World Trade Center.\n8:52: CBS interrupts The Early Show to report the news of the attack. Bryant Gumbel makes the announcement that a plane has crashed into the World Trade Center.\n8:52: CBC Newsworld anchor Mark Kelley makes the first Canadian television report of the first plane crash.\n8:52: Sky News presenter Kay Burley breaks the news of the first plane crash to the UK.\n8:52:50: Fox News comes back from a commercial break to report the attack. E. D. Hill informs viewers that a plane crashed into the North Tower.\n8:53: Network Ten news anchor Sandra Sully makes the first report of the incident over Australian television.\n8:53:23: Business presenter John Terrett puts out the first report of the disaster over BBC News 24 in the UK.\n8:54: Flight 77 deviates from its assigned course, turning south over Ohio and then heads back east towards Washington DC.\n8:54: BBC World news anchor Nisha Pillai makes the channel's first report of the disaster. The channel does not start continuous coverage until 9:00.\n8:54: Rede Globo anchor Carlos Nascimento makes the first Brazilian terrestrial television report of the first plane crash. Minutes after, the network resumes its regular programming (children's show Bambuluá) until starting continuous coverage of the events at 8:57.\n8:55 (approx.): An announcement is made over the building-wide PA system by officials in the superficially damaged South Tower, \"The building is secure, please return to your desks.\" The South Tower's occupants react in numerous ways, ranging from going back to their offices as suggested, ignoring it and evacuating anyway, or congregating in common areas such as the 78th floor sky lobby.\n8:55: President George W. Bush arrives at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, as part of a scheduled visit to promote education and is reading The Pet Goat when White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, who is with Bush, informs him that a small twin-engine plane has crashed into the World Trade Center. Before entering the classroom, the President speaks to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who is at the White House. She first tells him it was a twin-engine aircraft—and then a commercial aircraft—that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\"\n8:56: Ten minutes after the North Tower of the World Trade Center was hit by Flight 11, the transponder on Flight 77 is turned off and even primary radar contact with the aircraft is lost. During radar blackout Flight 77 turns east, unnoticed by flight controllers. When primary radar information is restored at 9:05, controllers searching for Flight 77 to the west of its previous position are unable to find it. Flight 77 travels undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east toward Washington, D.C.\n8:57: TV Azteca Hechos anchor Ramón Fregoso starts broadcasting the first report of the incident over Mexican television.\n8:58: Flight 175 makes a final turn toward New York City.\n8:59: Flight 175 passenger Brian Sweeney leaves a message via airphone to his wife Julie:\nJules, this is Brian. Listen, I'm on an airplane that's been hijacked. If things don't go well, and it's not looking good, I just want you to know I absolutely love you, I want you to do good, go have good times, same to my parents and everybody, and I just totally love you, and I'll see you when you get there. Bye, babe. I hope I call you.\n9:00 a.m.\n9:00: The first French television report of the disaster is broadcast over La Chaîne Info by anchor Marianne Kottenhoff.\n9:00: The first Spanish television report of the disaster is broadcast over Antena 3 by news anchor Matías Prats Luque.\n9:00: Lee Hanson receives a second call from his son Peter, aboard Flight 175, telling him that his plane is about to crash:\n\"It's getting bad, Dad. A stewardess was stabbed. They seem to have knives and Mace. They said they have a bomb. It's getting very bad on the plane. Passengers are throwing up and getting sick. The plane is making jerky movements. I don't think the pilot is flying the plane. I think we are going down. I think they intend to go to Chicago or someplace and fly into a building. Don't worry, Dad. If it happens, it'll be very fast. My God, my God.\"\nThe call ends abruptly just as Lee hears a woman scream. Shortly afterward, he witnesses the second aircraft impact the South Tower on live TV.\n9:01–9:02: A manager from the FAA's New York Center tells the Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Herndon, Virginia:\nNew York Center: We have several situations going on here. It's escalating big, big time. We need to get the military involved with us.\nATCSCC: We're, we're involved with something else, we have other aircraft that may have a similar situation going on here.\n9:01: FAA's New York Center contacts New York terminal approach control and asks for help in locating Flight 175. The flight is now in Central New Jersey headed for lower Manhattan.\n9:01: News anchor Lynne White of local New York television station WPIX (channel 11) begins the station's report on the attack.\n9:01: The first Japanese television report of the disaster is made over NHK Television by news anchor Masaaki Horio.\n9:02: Evacuation of both World Trade Center towers is ordered by FDNY Battalion Chief Joseph Pfeifer, who was stationed in the lobby of the North Tower. Although it is uncertain whether the South Tower's deputy fire safety director receives this order, an announcement is made over the tower's PA system to \"begin an orderly evacuation if conditions warranted\".\n9:02: Air traffic controllers at New York Center watch Flight 175 as it descends rapidly to a very low altitude. During its descent, it barely avoids colliding with Tampa-bound Delta Air Lines Flight 2315.\n]]\n9:03:}} Flight 175 crashes at about  into the south face of the South Tower (2 WTC) of the World Trade Center, between floors 77 and 85. The exploding jet fuel generates a massive fireball emerging from the southern, eastern and northern facades of the South Tower. East face windows on the already-burning North Tower are smashed as the shockwave from the explosion hits them. Parts of the plane, including the starboard engine, leave the South Tower from its east and north sides, falling to the ground six blocks away. All 65 people on board the aircraft die instantly on impact, and unknown hundreds in the building as well. The impact causes the tower to sway at a very low frequency, described by at least one building occupant, Brian Clark, as feeling like his floor, floor 84, moved laterally by between six and eight feet, or between 1.8 and 2.4 metres. By this time, several media organizations, including the three major American broadcast television networks (which have interrupted their morning shows), are covering the immediate aftermath of the first plane crash, and so millions of viewers see the impact live. New York's WNYW is among the first to specifically report that a second plane has crashed into the complex (many other news agencies do not realize that a second plane has crashed until several minutes later):\nJim Ryan: As you look at the picture from our chopper now, arriving at the scene, uh, Jim Friedl in Hoboken, uh, said it appeared to bank sharply and smash directly, perhaps purposefully into... Oh, my goodness. There's another one. Oh, my goodness. There's another one!\nLyn Brown: This seems to be on purpose.\nJim Ryan: Oh, my goodness. Now you...\nKai Simonsen (WNYW helicopter reporter): Was that a plane?\nJim Ryan: Now it's obvious. I think that there's a second plane just crashed into the World Trade Center. I think we have a terrorist act of proportions that we cannot begin to imagine at this juncture.\nKai Simonsen: Oh, my God.\nJim Ryan: My goodness, a second plane now has crashed into the other tower of the World Trade Center. [sigh] Obviously, suicide terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. What we have... what we have been fearing... [interrupted by unintelligible talkdown from Kai Simonsen] What we have been fearing for the longest time here apparently has come to pass. A disastrous terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Both towers, planes smashing into each one.\nA massive evacuation begins in the South Tower below its impact zone. One of the stairwells in the South Tower remains unblocked from the top to the bottom of the tower because of the plane hitting at an offset from the vertical center line of the building, but it is filled with smoke. This leads many people to mistakenly go upwards towards the roof for a rooftop rescue that never comes. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey kept the two sets of heavy metal doors leading to the building's only roof exit tightly locked. The impact severs communication with several television and radio broadcast towers at the WTC; WPIX's satellite feed freezes on a still image of the second impact which is all the station broadcasts until alternate transmitters are set up hours later. The affected television stations' terrestrial signals go off the air, however, they continue to broadcast, with their signals still receivable through local cable TV systems in the area, and WCBS-TV having backup transmitter facilities atop the Empire State Building.\nBecause of the North Tower's obstruction of the South Tower from certain camera angles, some are initially unaware that a second plane has struck the South Tower, and instead mistakenly believe that the second explosion has occurred in the North Tower. As instant replays of the second plane crash are shown, the anchors on the three major broadcast networks speculate on whether they are witnessing a terrorist attack or some sort of very rare accident. CNN changes its headline to read \"Second plane crashes into World Trade Center.\" The crash occurred as CNN was taking a feed from WABC-TV, and anchor Steve Bartelstein first assumed that the explosion seen was caused when the fuselage of the first plane exploded.  This was also the assumption that Regis Philbin initially made during the day's airing of Live with Regis and Kelly, which began at 9:00 AM.\n9:03:18: The FAA's New York TRACON stops all departures from airports in its jurisdiction. Ground movements at those airports are not yet stopped.\n9:03: President Bush enters a classroom as part of his school visit.\n9:03: FAA's New York Center notifies NORAD (NEADS) of the hijacking of Flight 175, at the same time it crashes.\n9:04: Fox News anchor Jon Scott mentions Osama bin Laden as a possible suspect.\n9:04 (approximately): The FAA's Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center stops all departures from airports in its jurisdiction (New England and eastern New York State).\n9:05: After brief introductions to the Booker elementary students, President Bush is about to begin reading The Pet Goat with the students when Chief of Staff Andrew Card interrupts to whisper to the president, \"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\" The president stated later that he decided to continue the lesson rather than alarm the students.\n9:06: The FAA begins imposing blanket temporary flight restrictions, with the first restriction banning takeoffs of all flights bound to or through the airspace of New York Center from airports in that Center and the three adjacent Centers—Boston, Cleveland, and Washington. This is referred to as a First Tier groundstop and covers the Northeast from North Carolina north and as far west as eastern Michigan.\n9:06: CNBC news anchor Alina Cho reports the evacuation of the New York Stock Exchange.\n9:08: The FAA bans all takeoffs nationwide for flights going to or through New York Center airspace. ABC News reports later that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that runs the New York-area airports, asked the FAA for permission to close down the New York Center airspace.\n9:11: The last PATH train leaves the World Trade Center. The station was vacant when the towers collapsed.\n9:11: Live With Regis and Kelly interrupts its regular taping and joins WABC-TV's coverage.\n9:11: ABC News anchor Peter Jennings begins reporting on the disaster.\n9:13: The F-15 fighters from Otis Air National Guard Base leave military airspace near Long Island, bound for Manhattan.\n9:14: President Bush returns to an adjacent classroom commandeered by the U.S. Secret Service. The classroom contains a telephone, a television showing the news coverage, and several senior staff members. The president speaks to Vice President Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller, and prepares brief remarks.\n9:15: NBC News reports unconfirmed statements from employees at United Airlines that an American Airlines aircraft had been hijacked prior to its destruction.\n9:17: The FAA closes down all New York City-area airports. The city had initially asked the FAA to close down the airports.\n9:17:02: CBS News correspondent Jim Stewart in Washington mentions that in the intelligence community, Osama bin Laden is a probable suspect.\n9:18: CNN makes reference to foul play for the first time, stating the FBI was investigating a report of plane hijacking. CNN changes headline to read \"AP: Plane was hijacked before crashes\".\n9:19: United 93 en-route to San Francisco is over Central Pennsylvania. United Airlines flight dispatcher Ed Ballinger begins sending warning text messages to his flights: \"Beware any cockpit intrusion—Two a/c [aircraft] hit World Trade Center.\" Because he was sending this warning to his 16 transcontinental flights, this takes several minutes. His message would not be received onboard United 93 for another 4 minutes.\n9:21: All bridges and tunnels into Manhattan are closed. The George Washington Bridge is however kept open to allow vehicle traffic to evacuate from Manhattan, and the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges are kept open for pedestrian evacuation. In addition, New Jersey Transit continues its train service into New York Penn Station to allow more people to evacuate the island.\n9:21: Transport Canada, Canada's transportation agency, activates its Situation Centre (SitCen) in Ottawa.\n9:23: Ballinger's warning message is sent to both Flight 93 and 175, and is received in the cockpit of Flight 93 a minute later.\n9:24-9:38 (approximately): Three people either try to climb down or fall from a 79th floor window, 79-351, at the South Tower's east face close to the southeast corner. Firefighter Danny Suhr is preparing to enter the South Tower when he is struck by a jumper. Suhr and the jumper are both killed instantly. Besides these three individuals, nobody else is seen falling from the South Tower, an obvious dissimilarity from the situation in the North Tower, where more than 100 people fell to their deaths for nearly the entire time it burned.\n9:24: The FAA notifies NORAD (NEADS) about the suspected hijacking of Flight 77. The FAA and NORAD establish an open line to discuss Flight 77, and shortly thereafter Flight 93.\n9:25: ABC News correspondent John Nance mentions the possibility of the plane that hit the South Tower being a Boeing 767, among other types of planes.\n9:25: The Otis-based F-15s establish an air patrol over Manhattan.\n9:25: A video teleconference begins to be set up in the White House Situation Room, led by Richard A. Clarke, a special assistant to the president, that eventually includes the CIA, the FBI, the departments of State, Justice, and Defense, and the FAA.\n9:25: The Associated Press informs CNN that the two plane crashes in the World Trade Center appeared to be an \"act of terrorism\".\n9:26: The FAA bans takeoffs of all civilian aircraft regardless of destination—a national groundstop.\n9:26: White House counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke indicates he gave the instruction to raise the worldwide force protection condition for U.S. military bases at around this time. This is likely the earliest instance this actual order was issued. Other evidence suggests the threat condition increase took place in steps, with the next step occurring sometime over the next hour. See link\n9:26: Flight 93's pilot, Jason Dahl, replies to Ballinger's text message, \"Ed, confirm latest mesg plz – Jason\".\n9:26: NBC News correspondent Andrea Mitchell reports to MSNBC anchor Lester Holt that a top U.S. government official informed her that one of the two planes that hit the Twin Towers was an American Airlines plane from Boston to Los Angeles that was hijacked.\n9:28:05: Flight 93 suddenly begins to descend as hijackers storm the cockpit and take over the flight. The entry of the hijackers is overheard by flight controllers at Cleveland. The flight descends roughly 700 feet before the autopilot corrects the altitude.\n9:29: The FDNY's Citywide Tour Commander issues a total recall of the Department, ordering all off-duty firefighters in New York City to report to their fire stations.\n9:29: President Bush makes his first public statements about the attacks, in front of an audience of about 200 teachers and students at the elementary school. He states that he will be going back to Washington. \"Today, we've had a national tragedy,\" he starts. \"Two airplanes… have crashed… into the World Trade Center… in an apparent terrorist attack on our country,\" and leads a moment of silence. No one in the President's traveling party has any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing.\n9:30: Reuters reports that a plane was hijacked from Boston.\n9:30: In the North Tower, six men escape express elevator Car 69-A. The elevator, which had been designed to traverse much of the building to reach the upper floors more quickly, had gotten stuck at the 50th Floor when Flight 11 hit the tower. With no exit at this floor, window cleaner Jan Demczur used his squeegee to attempt to cut a hole in the Sheetrock lining the elevator shaft. When the squeegee’s blade broke off and fell down the elevator shaft, he and the other five people in the elevator alternately used the handle to scrape away at the lining, eventually cutting a hole large enough for them to escape into an adjacent bathroom. They are found by firefighters, who immediately escort them to a stairwell. All six safely leave the tower five minutes before it collapses.\n9:31: On C-SPAN, Washington Journal host Steve Scully starts the channel's coverage of the morning's incidents.\n9:32: A radio transmission from Flight 93 is overheard by flight controllers at Cleveland: \"Ladies and gentlemen, here is the captain please sit down. Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board. So sit.\"\n9:32: Controllers at the Dulles Terminal Radar Approach Control in Virginia observe \"a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\", referring to Flight 77.\n9:33–9:34: A tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport tells Secret Service operations center at the White House that \"an aircraft is coming at you and not talking with us,\" referring to Flight 77. The White House is about to be evacuated when the tower reports that Flight 77 has turned and is approaching Reagan National Airport.\n9:34: The FAA's Command Center relays information concerning Flight 93 to FAA headquarters.\n9:35: The President's motorcade departs from the elementary school, bound for Sarasota–Bradenton International Airport and Air Force One.\n9:35: Flight 93 reverses direction over northeast Ohio and starts flying eastwards.\n9:35: Based on a report that Flight 77 had turned again and was circling back toward the District of Columbia, the Secret Service orders the immediate evacuation of the Vice President from the White House.\n9:36: Cleveland advises the FAA Command Center that it is still tracking Flight 93 and inquires whether someone had requested the military to launch fighter aircraft to intercept the aircraft.\n9:37: Vice President Cheney enters a tunnel leading to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, located under the White House East Wing.\nLincoln Town Car taxicab was hit by a lightpole as American Airlines Flight 77 passed over Washington Boulevard and crashed into the Pentagon.]]9:37: Flight 77 crashes into the western side of the Pentagon at  and its jet fuel starts a violent fire. The section of the Pentagon hit consists mainly of newly renovated, unoccupied offices. All 64 people on board are killed, as are 125 Pentagon personnel.\n9:39: Another radio transmission is heard from Ziad Jarrah aboard Flight 93: \"Uh, this is the captain. I would like you all to remain seated. We have a bomb on board and are going back to the airport, and to have our demands, so please remain quiet.\"\n9:39:12: NBC News Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski reports that \"it felt, just a few moments ago, like there was an explosion of some kind here at the Pentagon.\" NBC and MSNBC relay reports of the explosion but do not relay word of the crash of Flight 77 as they do not know the cause.\n9:40: Video teleconference in White House Situation Room begins with the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. They are not yet aware of the Pentagon crash.\n9:40:49: CNN's Breaking News bulletin reads \"Reports of fire at Pentagon.\"\n9:41: Local Washington, DC television station WUSA breaks away from the CBS network, with anchor Andrea Roane beginning the station's local coverage of the explosion at The Pentagon.\n9:41:15: The photograph The Falling Man is taken.\n9:42: ABC News broadcasts its first pictures from Washington, D.C. of heavy smoke, from a perspective on the other side of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is situated a block west of the White House. Peter Jennings confirms a fire at The Pentagon two minutes later.\n9:42: The main CBS network reports an explosion at the Pentagon.\n9:42: Senior FAA traffic manager Ben Sliney issues the execution order for SCATANA grounding all air traffic over the United States and diverting any incoming international traffic to alternate destinations.\n9:43: Fox News correspondent David Asman reports, \"We – we are hearing – right now that another explosion that – has taken place. At the Pentagon.\"\n9:43: Abu Dhabi TV reports it received a call from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, claiming responsibility for the World Trade Center attack, but this is soon denied by a senior officer of the group.\n9:43: The White House and the Capitol are evacuated and closed.\n9:45: United States airspace is shut down. No civilian aircraft are allowed to take off, and all aircraft in flight are ordered to land at the nearest airport as soon as possible. Nearly all international flights headed for the U.S. are redirected to Canada, while some flights from South America are diverted to Mexico. Transport Canada orders a complete closedown of Canadian airspace, but the Mexican airspace does not shut down. The FAA announces that civilian flights are suspended until at least noon September 12, while Transport Canada gives similar orders; the FAA further ordered that diverted U.S.-bound international flights should be taken in, launching the agency's \"Operation Yellow Ribbon\", with CFB Goose Bay being the first Canadian air facility to receive airliners originally bound for the U.S. Other airports across Canada received varying numbers of airliners; Gander International Airport in Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador hosted 38 planes, consisting of 6,122 passengers and 473 crew, the second largest number out of any Canadian airport other than Halifax. The groundings would eventually last until September 14. Military and medical flights as well as Con Air flights continue. This is the fourth time all commercial flights in the U.S. have been stopped, and the first time a suspension was unplanned. All previous suspensions were military-related (Sky Shield I-III), from 1960 to 1962. Many newspapers (including The New York Times) mistakenly print that this is the first time flights have been suspended. This was, however, the first time commercial flights in Canada were stopped.\n9:45: CNN receives initial reports that, in addition to a fire at the Pentagon, there is also a fire at the National Mall. These reports on the National Mall, however, are later proven to be false.\n9:46: A message is sent to Flight 93 from San Francisco, \"PLZ CONFIRM ALL IS NML... THX\"\n9:46:36: The ARD news magazine Tagesthemen, hosted by Ulrich Wickert, broadcasts news of the attacks to Germany.\n9:49: The FAA Command Center at Herndon suggests that someone at FAA headquarters should decide whether to request military assistance with Flight 93. Ultimately, the FAA makes no request before it crashes.\n9:50 (approximately): The Associated Press reports that Flight 11 was apparently hijacked after departure from Boston's Logan Airport. Within an hour this is confirmed for both Flight 11 and Flight 175.\n9:51: Chief Orio Palmer of the FDNY's 7th Battalion reaches the 78th Floor Sky Lobby of the South Tower along with Fire Marshal Ronald Bucca. Palmer reports that there are two pockets of fire and numerous dead bodies.\n9:52: The National Security Agency intercepts a phone call between a known associate of Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and someone in the Republic of Georgia, announcing that he had heard \"good news\", and that another target was still to be hit.\n9:53: CNN confirms a plane crash at the Pentagon.\n9:55: A CNN correspondent mentions Osama bin Laden as someone determined to strike the US.\n9:55: Air Force One leaves Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport.\n9:57: Passenger revolt begins on Flight 93.\n9:57: President Bush leaves Sarasota, Florida, on Air Force One. The plane reaches cruising altitude and circles for approximately 40 minutes while the destination of the plane is discussed.\nbeing reduced to dust and debris as the structures below its impact zone fail to hold the weight of the upper floors.]]\n9:59: The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses, 56 minutes for simplicity. If the Commission’s claim that the South Tower was struck at 9:03:11 is to be believed, then the collapse began 55 minutes and 48 seconds after the crash, not 56 minutes.}} after the impact of Flight 175. Its destruction is viewed and heard by a vast television and radio audience. As the roar of the collapse goes silent, tremendous gray-white clouds of pulverized concrete and gypsum rush through the streets. Most observers think a new explosion or impact has produced smoke and debris that now obscures the South Tower, but once the wind clears the smoke, it becomes clear that the building is no longer standing. No one who is still inside the South Tower at the time of its collapse survives. NY1 correspondent Kristen Shaughnessy, on the scene of the disaster, reports on the collapse of the South Tower at the instant it begins, while ABC News correspondent Don Dahler, who was home at the time of the incident and lived near the site, reports to anchor Peter Jennings on air that he has witnessed the tower collapse; Dahler's report is perhaps the first broadcast specific confirmation of a collapse as his report is filed seconds after the event.\n9:59: As the South Tower collapses, Father Mychal Judge, OFM, chaplain to the FDNY, is struck by falling debris on the lobby level of the North Tower. He dies of blunt force trauma to the head. He is found by Chief Pfeifer, Jules Naudet, and others from the North Tower Command Post who fled when they heard the South Tower collapse and took refuge in the nearby escalator as the debris cloud engulfed them. As Judge's body is the first recovered and certified by the medical examiner's office, he will be designated \"Victim 0001\" of the September 11 attacks.\n10:00 a.m.\n10:00: FDNY Battalion Chief Joseph Pfeifer (inside of the still standing North Tower) orders all FDNY personnel to evacuate, via radio.\nBattalion 1 Chief (Chief Pfeifer): Command post, Tower 1, all units. Evacuate the building. Command post, to all units.\nDue to many communication limitations, numerous firefighters within the tower do not receive this transmission. Some personnel who do not hear the order only leave the building after being told by other firefighters that an evacuation order has been given. Others never receive the order at all.\n10:01: The FAA Command Center advises FAA headquarters that an aircraft had seen Flight 93 \"waving his wings,\" the hijackers' efforts to defeat the passengers' counterattack.\n10:02: Communicators with the Vice President in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center begin receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft—presumably hijacked—heading toward Washington. This is Flight 93.\n10:02: CNN announces that the Sears Tower in Chicago has been evacuated.\n10:03 (approximately): The National Military Command Center learns from the White House of Flight 93's hijacking.\n10:03: Flight 93 crashes at   southeast of Pittsburgh in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, concluding the attacks. Later reports indicate that passengers had learned about the World Trade Center and Pentagon crashes on cell phones and at least three were planning on resisting the hijackers; the resistance was confirmed by Flight 93's cockpit voice recording, on which the hijackers are heard making their decision to down the plane before the passengers succeed in breaching the cockpit door. The terrorists are believed to have been aiming for the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building, both of which had been evacuated and closed 18 minutes before Flight 93 went down. The flight was still at least 10 minutes away from D.C. at the time of its crash, and probably closer to 20.\n10:05: Andrea Mitchell, reporting for NBC from outside the Pentagon, reports that Osama bin Laden may have been involved in the attacks.\n10:05: CNN's headlines read: \"SOUTH TOWER AT WTC COLLAPSES.\"\n10:05: The IDS Center in Minneapolis is evacuated.\n10:07: NBC reports for the first time that the South Tower of the World Trade Center has collapsed. Prior to this time they have said only that a section of the building has fallen away.\n10:07: NEADS, controlling the only set of fighters over Washington, first learns of the hijacking of Flight 93, 4 minutes after it actually crashed.\n10:08: Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Herndon reports to FAA headquarters that Flight 93 may be down near Johnstown, Pennsylvania; at 10:17 the Command Center concludes it is so.\n10:10: British Prime Minister Tony Blair makes his first comments on the attacks at a meeting of the Trades Union Congress in Brighton, calling the attacks \"the new evil in our world today\".\n10:10: National Military Command Center directs Threat Condition Delta for U.S. military bases worldwide.\n10:10: Part of the west side of the Pentagon collapses.\n10:10: NEADS emphatically tells fighter pilots over Washington, \"Negative clearance to shoot.\" [i.e. they were not authorized to shoot.]\n10:10–10:15 (approximately): Vice President Cheney, unaware that Flight 93 has crashed, authorizes fighter aircraft to engage the inbound plane, reported to be  from Washington, based not on radar (from which it has disappeared) but speed and trajectory projections.\n10:13: Thousands are involved in an evacuation of the United Nations complex in New York.\n10:13–10:22: The 9/11 Commission's estimated arrival of Flight 93 over Washington had it not crashed in Pennsylvania.\n10:14–10:19: A lieutenant colonel at the White House repeatedly relays to the NMCC that the Vice President has confirmed that fighters are cleared to engage inbound aircraft if they can verify that the aircraft was hijacked.\n10:15: CNN's headline reads, \"EXPLOSION ON CAPITOL HILL.\"\n10:15: Five stories of part of the Pentagon collapse due to the fire.\n10:18: NBC reports that Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), has denied complicity in the attacks and is appalled by them.\n10:20: President Bush, aboard Air Force One, tells Vice President Cheney that he has authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary.\n10:23: The Associated Press reports a car bomb has exploded outside the State Department in Washington, D.C. This and several other reports of terrorist acts in the capital are quickly found to be false.\n10:24: Two men who were being evacuated through the underground shopping mall below the South Tower when it collapsed on them are able to climb up through thirty feet of debris to safety. 1010 WINS in New York City reports an explosion at the U.S. Supreme Court building. This is later revealed to be erroneous.\n10:28: The North Tower of the World Trade Center collapses. Due to the destruction of the gypsum-encased stairwells on the impact floors (unlike most skyscraper stairwells, which are encased in reinforced concrete), no one who was above the 91st floor in the North Tower escapes the collapse. Unlike the South Tower's collapse, which killed everyone still inside the building, 16 individuals who were inside the collapsing North Tower survived and would later be rescued. The Marriott Hotel, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed. The second collapse is also viewed live on television and heard on radio. The North Tower collapses 1 hour and 42 minutes after the impact of Flight 11—the building had continued burning even after the attacks ended with the crash of Flight 93. The cascade of debris from that collapse gouges out a portion of the south side of 7 World Trade Center and sets the bottom of the building on fire. New York City's 1010 WINS reports the collapse live as it happens, broadcasting a live phone call with WINS news director Ben Mevorach, who witnessed the collapse from the Manhattan Bridge. On NBC News, Katie Couric says: \"The other tower of the World Trade Center has just collapsed.\"\nSeveral long-distance videos of the collapse, such as CNN, were able to notice that, after the cloud of dust had partially cleared away, a portion of the building was still standing. It appeared to be the lower half of the northwest corner column of the North Tower, which, like a spire, grew larger and had more structure still standing near the bottom. The portion rose to a fairly good height considering the collapse around it, as it appeared to rise nearly forty stories off the ground. This piece remained standing for a few seconds after the initial collapse before it also came down. The debris cloud from the North Tower's collapse is also significantly larger and more far-reaching than that of the South Tower's, due to dust from that collapse being kicked up as the North Tower fell.\n10:31: NORAD first communicates the Vice President's shootdown authority to NEADS.\n10:35: Air Force One, carrying the President, turns for Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, Louisiana.\n10:37: Associated Press reports that officials at the Somerset County Airport confirm that a large plane has crashed in western Pennsylvania.
