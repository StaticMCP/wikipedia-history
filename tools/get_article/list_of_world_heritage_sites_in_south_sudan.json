Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. The Republic of South Sudan accepted the convention on 9 March 2016 . There are no World Heritage Sites in the country, but there are three on the tentative list. It has not served any terms on the Heritage Committee.\nTentative list\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural. In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list.\nIn 2017, South Sudan formally listed its tentative sites to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre. It was the first time South Sudan listed its sites to the organization for future inclusion. Three sites were listed throughout the country.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location (State)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Deim Zubeir – Slave route site\n|\n| Western Bahr el Ghazal,\n| 2017\n| 6275; ii, iii, vi\n| Deim Zubeir is a historical slave camp which was used in the slave trade in the 19th century.
