It took place on June 8, 1997, at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nThe main event was a standard wrestling match for the WWF Championship. The Undertaker defeated Faarooq to retain the title. The undercard included the 1997 King of the Ring tournament, which was won by Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Other matches on the undercard included Shawn Michaels versus Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Hart Foundation (Owen Hart, The British Bulldog, and Jim Neidhart) versus Sycho Sid and The Legion of Doom in a six-man tag team match and Goldust versus Crush.\nProduction\nBackground\nKing of the Ring was a pay-per-view (PPV) event held annually in June by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1993. The PPV featured the King of the Ring tournament, a single-elimination tournament that was established in 1985 and held annually until 1991, with the exception of 1990; these early tournaments were held as special non-televised house shows. The winner of the tournament was crowned \"King of the Ring.\" Unlike the non-televised events, the PPV did not feature all of the tournament's matches. Instead, several of the qualifying matches preceded the event with the final few matches then taking place at the pay-per-view. There were also other matches that took place at the event as it was a traditional three-hour pay-per-view. Considered one of the WWF's \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with the Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, the company's five biggest shows of the year, the 1997 event was the fifth King of the Ring PPV and 11th tournament overall. It was held on June 8, 1997 at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nStorylines\nKing of the Ring consisted of professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that were played out on Raw Is War—WWF's main television program. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe pay-per-view event included the annual King of the Ring single elimination bracket tournament. The tournament started on the May 12, 1997 episode of Raw is War, with Ahmed Johnson defeating Hunter Hearst Helmsley in the first quarter-final match by disqualification. On the May 19 episode of Raw is War, Helmsley got another spot in the tournament because he was not properly instructed before his match with Johnson and thus threatened to sue WWF with legal action. He replaced Vader, who was originally scheduled to wrestle Crush but had been injured in a No Holds Barred match against Ken Shamrock at In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell. Helmsley defeated Crush and advanced to the semi-finals. On the May 26 episode of Raw is War, Jerry Lawler defeated Goldust in the third quarter-final match. The final quarter-final match was held on the June 2 episode of Raw is War, as Mankind defeated Savio Vega.\nThe predominant rivalry heading into the event was between The Undertaker and Faarooq over Undertaker's WWF Championship. On the May 12 episode of Raw is War, The Undertaker had nearly defeated Faarooq's Nation of Domination teammate Savio Vega in a non-title match until Faarooq interfered and attacked The Undertaker. On the May 31 episode of Shotgun, Faarooq, Crush, and Vega defeated The Undertaker, Mankind, and Vader in a six-man tag team match. It would eventually lead to a title match between Undertaker and Faarooq at King of the Ring. During this period, The Undertaker was once again under the management of Paul Bearer, despite his reluctance. Bearer, who had previously betrayed him, leveraged a hidden secret to manipulate The Undertaker into complying with his demands.\nAnother predominant rivalry heading into the event was between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels. On the May 26 episode of Raw is War, Austin and Michaels defeated Owen Hart and British Bulldog to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. However, after the title win, Austin went to fight Bret Hart and Michaels was attacked by the rest of The Hart Foundation, which created jealousy between the new champions. On the June 2 episode of Raw is War, Austin and Michaels began fighting each other during a title defense against the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal). This led to a match between Austin and Michaels at King of the Ring to determine the captain of the team.\nEvent\n{| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ Other on-screen personnel\n|-\n!Role:\n!Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Commentator\n|Vince McMahon\n|-\n|Jim Ross\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Spanish Commentators\n|Carlos Cabrera\n|-\n|Tito Santana\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|French Commentators\n|Ray Rougeau\n|-\n|Jean Brassard\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewer\n|Todd Pettengill\n|-\n|Dok Hendrix\n|-\n|Ring announcer\n|Howard Finkel\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Referee\n|Tim White\n|-\n|Jack Doan\n|-\n|Earl Hebner\n|-\n|Mike Chioda\n|-\n|}\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher) wrestled Bart Gunn and Jesse James on Free For All. Headbangers hit Gunn with a Powerbomb Diving Leg Drop Combo, which they called Stage Dive and pinned Gunn to win the match.\nPreliminary matches\nHunter Hearst Helmsley won the 1997 King of the Ring tournament.]]\nAs the show began, the semi-final round of the King of the Ring tournament started with Hunter Hearst Helmsley taking on Ahmed Johnson. Johnson dominated most of the match and had nearly won the match until Helmsley's female bodyguard Chyna climbed the apron and distracted Johnson. Helmsley took advantage and hit Johnson with a Pedigree for the victory.\nIn the next semi-final match, Mankind wrestled Jerry Lawler. The match occurred outside the ring on many occasions. Lawler tried to finish the match by attempting a Piledriver on Mankind. However, Mankind reversed it into a Mandible claw, forcing Lawler to submit to the hold.\nThe third match was between Goldust and Crush. During the match, Crush's teammate D'Lo Brown tried to interfere on his behalf by attacking Goldust but was thwarted off. Goldust hit Crush with a DDT and pinned him for the victory.\nNext was a six-man tag team match pitting The Hart Foundation (Owen Hart, The British Bulldog, and Jim Neidhart) against Sid and The Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal). Sid tried to finish the match with a Powerbomb on Bulldog. However, Owen Hart, who was the legal man, took advantage and pinned Sid with a Sunset Flip for the victory.\nMain event matches\nThe fifth match was the tournament final of the 1997 King of the Ring between Mankind and Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Mankind dominated the match but Chyna's interference in the match prevented Mankind from winning. Helmsley hit Mankind with a Pedigree on the broadcast table outside the ring. As Mankind was trying to get back into the ring, Chyna hit him hard with the scepter. Helmsley threw Mankind into the ring and performed another Pedigree to pin Mankind for the victory. As a result, Helmsley won the 1997 King of the Ring tournament. However, Helmsley broke his King of the Ring crown by smashing it in Mankind's back. After the match, Bret Hart issued an open challenge to any five American wrestlers to wrestle him and his Hart Foundation at In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede.\nNext was a Singles match between the WWF Tag Team Champions Shawn Michaels and Stone Cold Steve Austin to determine the team captain. The referee was knocked out during the match. Austin hit Michaels with a Stone Cold Stunner. He picked up the referee and hit him too with a Stone Cold Stunner. This gave Michaels time to recover and hit Austin with a Sweet Chin Music and tried to pin Austin. A second referee came out in the match but instead of counting the pinfall for Michaels, he checked on the first referee. This angered Michaels and he attacked the replacement referee. The third referee Earl Hebner came in and disqualified both Austin and Michaels for attacking the referees. As a result, the match resulted in a double disqualification but Michaels and Austin continued to fight with each other.\nThe Undertaker defended the WWF Championship against Faarooq at King of the Ring.\nThe main event was between The Undertaker and Faarooq for the WWF Championship. Due to numerous interferences by Nation of Domination, Faarooq was able to dominate the match. However, late into the match, Crush and Savio Vega began arguing with each other which distracted Faarooq. Faarooq left the ring to investigate. This gave Undertaker time to regain his momentum. Undertaker hit Faarooq with a Tombstone Piledriver, and pinned him to retain the title. After the match, Ahmed Johnson made a run-in and argued with Undertaker. The argument ended with Johnson hitting Undertaker with a Pearl River Plunge.\nAftermath\nFollowing Ahmed Johnson's attack on The Undertaker at King of the Ring, Johnson and The Undertaker were teamed together for a tag team match against Faarooq and Kama Mustafa on the June 16 episode of Raw is War. Johnson turned on The Undertaker during the match, allowing Kama to pin The Undertaker for the victory. As a result, Johnson became a villain and ended his rivalry with Faarooq's Nation of Domination by joining the faction.\nAfter losing the WWF Championship match at King of the Ring due to an argument between his teammates, Crush and Savio Vega, Faarooq fired them from the Nation of Domination and converted it into a faction of black wrestlers, leading to a racial gang war as the White American Crush formed Disciples of Apocalypse (DOA) and the Hispanic Vega formed Los Boricuas. The Nation, DOA, and Los Boricuas battled each other throughout 1997.\nAs a result of Hunter Hearst Helmsley defeating Mankind to win the King of the Ring tournament, Mankind and Helmsley feuded with each other for several months. After ending his rivalry with Mankind and his alter ego, Dude Love, Helmsley found immediate success by forming the comedic faction D-Generation X with Shawn Michaels, Chyna and Rick Rude.\nResults\n|note1  = ffa\n|match1 = The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher) defeated Bart Gunn and Jesse James\n|stip1  = Tag team match\n|time1  = 6:10\n|match2 = Hunter Hearst Helmsley (with Chyna) defeated Ahmed Johnson\n|stip2  = King of the Ring semi-final match\n|time2  = 7:42\n|match3 = Mankind defeated Jerry Lawler by submission\n|stip3  = King of the Ring semi-final match\n|time3  = 10:24\n|match4 = Goldust (with Marlena) defeated Crush (with D'Lo Brown and Clarence Mason)\n|stip4  = Singles match\n|time4  = 9:56\n|match5 = The Hart Foundation (Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart and The British Bulldog) defeated Sycho Sid and The Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal)\n|stip5  = Six-man tag team match\n|time5  = 13:37\n|match6 = Hunter Hearst Helmsley (with Chyna) defeated Mankind\n|stip6  = King of the Ring final match\n|time6  = 19:26\n|match7 = Shawn Michaels vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin ended in a double disqualification\n|stip7  = Singles match\n|time7  = 22:29\n|match8 = The Undertaker (c) (with Paul Bearer) defeated Faarooq (with Savio Vega, D'Lo Brown, Crush and Clarence Mason)\n|stip8  = Singles match for the WWF Championship\n|time8  = 13:44\n}}\nTournament brackets\nThe tournament was held between May 12 and June 8, 1997. The tournament brackets were:\n| RD1-team4=Crush\n| RD1-score3=Pin\n| RD1-score4=18:56\n| RD1-team5=Goldust\n| RD1-team6=Jerry Lawler\n| RD1-score5=Pin\n| RD1-score6=11:55\n| RD1-team7=Mankind\n| RD1-team8=Savio Vega\n| RD1-score7=Pin\n| RD1-score8=14:35\n| RD2-team1=Ahmed Johnson\n| RD2-team2=Hunter Hearst Helmsley\n| RD2-score1=Pin\n| RD2-score2=7:42\n| RD2-team3=Jerry Lawler\n| RD2-team4=Mankind\n| RD2-score3=Sub\n| RD2-score4=10:24\n| RD3-team1=Hunter Hearst Helmsley\n| RD3-team2=Mankind\n| RD3-score1=Pin\n| RD3-score2=19:28\n}}\n1.  Helmsley was allowed another spot in the tournament because he was not properly instructed prior to his match with Ahmed Johnson the previous week that he could be eliminated via disqualification and thus threatened the WWF with legal action; Vader was originally in this spot but sustained a broken nose after his No Holds Barred match with Ken Shamrock at In Your House: A Cold Day in Hell on May 11. This gave Helmsley the opportunity to fill in the vacant space and face Crush. Vader fought Ahmed on the May 26 episode of Raw Is War for his spot, but lost.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100812073234/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering97/ King of the Ring 1997 at Online World of Wrestling]\n* [http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/kotr97.html WWF King of the Ring 1997 at Complete WWE]"
