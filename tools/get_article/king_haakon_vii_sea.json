The IHO 2002 draft was never approved by the IHO (or any other organization), and the 1953 IHO document (which does not contain the name) remains currently in force.   Most leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use the name, including the 2014 10th edition World Atlas from the National Geographic Society.\nBy a narrow proposed definition, this sea would be between the Weddell Sea and a proposed Lazarev Sea name, and thus stretch only along Princess Martha Coast from Cape Norvegia at 12°18′W, the easternmost point of the Weddell Sea, to Fimbul Ice Shelf close to the Prime Meridian at 0°0′, which is proposed as the western border of Lazarev Sea.\nFrom the Norwegian point of view, which also does not recognize Lazarev Sea, King Haakon VII Sea is situated along the entire coast of Queen Maud Land between 20°W and 45°E and stretches for about  from the Stancomb-Wills Glacier at 19°W on Princess Martha Coast in the west  to  Shinnan Glacier at 44°38′E on the eastern border of Prince Olav Coast  in the east.\nThe water here is covered by ice most of the year. During autumn pack ice forms which does not break up until spring. The rough coordinates of the proposed sea area would be .\nThe area is an important habitat for the Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii).\nHistory\nOn 27 January 1820 Russian Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen made the first confirmed sighting of Terra Australis (Antarctica) as he was cruising this area near the Fimbul Ice Shelf at Princess Märtha Coast.\nThe area is named in honour of Haakon VII, the first king of Norway after the dissolution from Sweden.\nFurther reading\n* Beau Riffenburgh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fRJtB2MNdJMC&dq=%22King+Haakon+VII+Sea%22&pg=PA816 Encyclopedia of the Antarctic, Volume 1], P 816\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110711021744/http://images30.fotki.com/v1037/file6DSy/b3ebc/9/969565/4396778/ANSH11.jpg Picture from the King Haakon VII Sea]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095432/http://lima.nasa.gov/pdf/A3_overview.pdf Overview map of the area from NASA]"
