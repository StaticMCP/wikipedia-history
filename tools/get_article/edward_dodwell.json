He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.\nDodwell travelled from 1801 to 1806 in Greece, which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire, and spent the rest of his life for the most part in Italy, at Naples and Rome. He died in Rome from the effects of an illness contracted in 1830 during a visit of exploration to the Sabine Mountains. Dodwell's widow, a daughter of Count Giraud and thirty years his junior, subsequently became famous as the \"beautiful\" countess of Spaur, and played a considerable role in the political life of the papal city.\nDodwell published A Classical and Topographical Tour through Greece (1819), of which a German translation appeared in 1821; Views in Greece, with thirty colored plates (1821); and Views and Descriptions of Cyclopian or Pelasgic Remains in Italy and Greece (London and Paris, with French text, 1834).\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.s4ulanguages.com/dodwell.html Facsimile copies of the 1st editions of Dodwell's three books]"
