Records. The tracks were recorded at One on One Studios, Can Am Recorders, Cherokee Studios, The Village Recorder, The Record Plant, and Artisan Sound Recorders. The album produced four singles: \"Love Touch\", \"Another Heartache\", \"In My Life\", and \"Every Beat of My Heart\". In the United States, the album was released under the eponymous title of Rod Stewart.\nContent\nIncluded on this album is the song \"Love Touch\", which gained popularity as the theme to the Robert Redford film Legal Eagles. \"Love Touch\" was written by Holly Knight, Mike Chapman, and Gene Black. The album also includes a cover of Lennon–McCartney's \"In My Life\", one of several times Rod covered them.  It was released as a single which failed to chart. According to the liner notes, this album is dedicated to Rod's parents Bob and Elsie Stewart. \"Every Beat of My Heart\" was the biggest hit of the album and reached number two in the UK Singles Chart in July 1986.\nCritical reception\nA contemporary review for Rolling Stone by David Wilde called the album an improvement on predecessor Camouflage but criticized \"Love Touch\" as well as \"In My Life\" as a cover choice. By contrast, a retrospective review on Allmusic by Dave Thompson dubbed Stewart's version of \"In My Life\" one of the two best songs on the album alongside the title track, giving the overall album two stars. Another review of the album by Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it 'an utter lack of convincing popcraft' and 'the worst the singer recorded.'\nCash Box said of the title track that it's \"a rock ballad that shimmers with solid production values and the singer's trademark grainy voice.\"  Billboard called it a \"emotional ballad about belonging, delivered with believability.\"\nTrack listing\n#\"Here to Eternity\" (Rod Stewart, Kevin Savigar) – 5:58\n#\"Another Heartache\" (Bryan Adams, Jim Vallance, Stewart, Randy Wayne) – 4:29\n#\"A Night Like This\" (Stewart) – 4:06\n#\"Who's Gonna Take Me Home\" (Stewart, Savigar, Jay Davis) – 4:38\n#\"Red Hot in Black\" (Stewart, Jim Cregan, Kevin Savigar) – 3:30\n#\"Love Touch\" (Mike Chapman, Gene Black, Holly Knight) – 3:59\n#\"In My Own Crazy Way\" (Stewart, Frankie Miller, Troy Seals, Eddie Setser) – 3:17\n#\"Every Beat of My Heart\" (Stewart, Kevin Savigar) – 5:18\n#\"Ten Days of Rain\" (Stewart, Savigar, Tony Brock) – 5:21\n#\"In My Life\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) – 2:00\nPersonnel\n* Rod Stewart – lead vocals\n* Kevin Savigar – keyboards\n* Nicky Hopkins – keyboards\n* Bob Ezrin – keyboards, backing vocals\n* Randy Wayne – keyboards\n* Paul Fox – keyboards\n* Jim Cregan – guitars, backing vocals\n* Robin Le Mesurier – guitars\n* Robert Athis (Kane Roberts) – guitars\n* John Corey – guitars, electric sitar\n* Gene Black – guitars\n* Steve Cropper – guitars\n* Nils Lofgren – guitars\n* David Williams – guitars\n* Jay Davis – bass guitar\n* Patrick O'Hearn – bass guitar\n* Scott Edwards – bass guitar\n* Tony Brock – drums\n* Tom Scott – brass, reeds\n* Larry Williams and Co. – brass, reeds\n* Devon Dickinson – bagpipes\n* Harry Farrar – bagpipes\n* Kevin Weed – bagpipes\n* Tray Galaway, Phil Perry, Kevin Dorsey, Daryl Phinnesse, Oren Waters – The Singers\n* Albert Hammond, Joe Turano, Holly Knight, Mike Chapman, Darlene Koldenhoven, Clydene Edwards, Carmen Twillie, Jennifer Repo, Jeoffrey Repo, John Batdorf – backing vocals\nProduction\n* Producers – Bob Ezrin (Tracks 1–5 & 7–10); Michael Chapman (Track 6).\n* Production Coordinator on Tracks 1–5 & 7–10 – Malcolm Cullimore\n* Engineers – Paul Lani (Tracks 1–5 & 7–10); George Tutko (Track 6).\n* Additional Recording on Tracks 1–5 & 7–10 – Jeff Bennette, Brian Christian, Peter Lewis and David Tickle.\n* Remixing – Bob Ezrin and David Tickle (Tracks 1–5 & 7–10); George Tutko (Track 6).\n* Assistant Remixing on Tracks 1–5 & 7–10 – David Ahlert, Jim Dineen, Craig Engle, Stan Katayama and Bob Loftus.\n* Technical Director on Tracks 1–5 & 7–10 – Robert Hrycyna\n* Mastered by Doug Sax at The Mastering Lab (Los Angeles, CA).\n* Art Direction – Jeff Ayeroff and Jeri McManus\n* Design – Jeri McManus\n* Photography – Phillip Dixon\n* Management – Randy Phillips and Arnold Stiefel\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1986)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Australian Albums (Kent Music Report)\n| 26\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1986)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)\n| 14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Dutch Albums (Album Top 100)\n| 74\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n| 32\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade)\n| 19\n|}\nCertifications\n}}\n}}\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rodstewartfanclub.com/about_rod/disco/album_detail.php?album_id=9 About.com]"
