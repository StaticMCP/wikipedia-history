The deployment of Italian troops to the Crimea, and the gallantry shown by them in the Battle of the Chernaya (16 August 1855) and in the siege of Sevastopol (1854–1855), allowed the Kingdom of Sardinia to attend the peace negotiatiatons for ending the war at the Congress of Paris (1856), where Cavour could raise the issue of the Risorgimento with the European great powers.\nOrder of Battle of the Expeditionary Corps\nA total of 18,061 men and 3,963 horses and mules embarked in April 1855 on British and Sardinian ships in the harbor of Genoa. While the infantry of the line and cavalry units were drawn from soldiers, who had volunteered for the expedition, the Bersaglieri, artillery and sapper troops were dispatched from their regular units. I.e. each of the army's 10 regular Bersaglieri battalions dispatched its first two companies for the expedition, while i.e. the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Provisional Regiment consisted of volunteers from the army's 3rd Line Infantry Regiment. The corps disembarked at Balaklava between 9 May and 14 May 1855.\nStaff\n* Expeditionary Corps Commander in Chief: Lieutenant General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora\n** Chief of Staff: Lieutenant Colonel Petiti Di Roreto\n** Staff Major: Major Giuseppe Govone\n** Artillery Staff Major: Major Della Rovere\n** Commander, Artillery: Colonel Valfre Di Bonzo\n** Commander, Engineers: Major Staglieno\n** Commander, Bersaglieri: Lieutenant Colonel De Saint Pierre\n** Commander, Support Services: Major General Paolo Antonio de Cavero (until 17 August 1855, then handled by Major Della Rovere after, De Cavero took over the Reserve Brigade when its commander Major General Giorgio Ansaldi died)\n** Commander, Medical Services: Dr. Comisetti\n** Garrison Commander Balaklava: Lieutenant Colonel Della Chiesa Della Torre\n** Garrison Commander Constantinople: Lieutenant Colonel Paolucci\n** British Liaison officer: Colonel George Cadogan\n** French Liaison officer: Capitaine le Duc de Dino Talleyrand-Périgord\nStaff Units\n* Provisional Cavalry Regiment (Colonel De Savoiroux)\n** Regimental Staff, from the Regiment \"Cavalleggeri di Alessandria\"\n** 1st Squadron - 1st Squadron of the Regiment \"Cavalleggeri di Novara\"\n** 2nd Squadron - 1st Squadron of the Regiment \"Cavalleggeri di Aosta\"\n** 3rd Squadron - 1st Squadron of the Regiment \"Cavalleggeri di Saluzzo\"\n** 4th Squadron - 1st Squadron of the Regiment \"Cavalleggeri di Monferrato\"\n** 5th Squadron - 1st Squadron of the Regiment \"Cavalleggeri di Alessandria\"\n* Provisional Fortress (Coastal) Artillery Battalion (Major Marabotto)\n** 1st Fortress Battery, from the 1st Fortress Artillery Brigade\n** 2nd Fortress Battery, from the 1st Fortress Artillery Brigade\n** 7th Fortress Battery, from the 2nd Fortress Artillery Brigade\n** 8th Fortress Battery, from the 2nd Fortress Artillery Brigade\n* Mixed Artillery Workers Company, providing maintenance support for the corps' artillery guns (Captain Maraldi)\n* Provisional Sappers Battalion (Major Serra) with troops from the Army's Sappers Regiment\n** 1st Sappers Company\n** 2nd Sappers Company\n** 6th Sappers Company\n** 7th Sappers Company\n* Army Train, providing logistic support to the corps (Captain Raimondi)\n** 1st Army Train Company\n** 2nd Army Train Company\n* Carabinieri Detachment, 50 men providing headquarters security\nCombat Forces\n* 1st Division (Lieutenant General Giovanni Durando)\n** II Brigade (Major General Manfredo Fanti)\n*** 2nd Provisional Regiment (Lieutenant Colonel Beretta)\n**** 1st Battalion, with troops from the 3rd Infantry Regiment (Brigade \"Piemonte\") (Major Gibbone)\n**** 2nd Battalion, with troops from the 4th Infantry Regiment (Brigade \"Piemonte\") (Major Garavelli)\n**** 3rd Battalion, with troops from the 5th Infantry Regiment (Brigade \"Aosta\") (Major Brignone)\n**** 4th Battalion, with troops from the 6th Infantry Regiment (Brigade \"Aosta\") (Major Regis)\n*** II Bersaglieri Battalion (Major Bonardelli)\n**** 9th Bersaglieri Company, from the III Bersaglieri Battalion\n**** 10th Bersaglieri Company, from the III Bersaglieri Battalion\n**** 13th Bersaglieri Company, from the IV Bersaglieri Battalion\n**** 14th Bersaglieri Company, from the IV Bersaglieri Battalion\n*** 7th Field Battery with 6x guns (Captain Melli;
