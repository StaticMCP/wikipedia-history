      "text": "# John Warkworth\n\nJohn Warkworth DD (c. 1425 – 1500) was an English churchman and academic, a Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. He is no longer considered to be a chronicler of Edward IV, the so-called ''Warkworth's Chronicle'' now being attributed to one of two other fellows of Peterhouse. Warkworth has been subject to another confusion, with another fellow of Peterhouse of the same name.\nReferences"
