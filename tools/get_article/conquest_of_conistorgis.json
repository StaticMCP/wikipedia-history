Caesarus was initially defeated; however, while fleeing, they managed to turn the battle around, killing 9,000 Romans in the end. Mummius used his 5,000 remaining soldiers and attacked the Lusitanians by surprise, slaying a large number of them.\nThe Battle\nThe Lusitanians on the other side of the Tagus, led by Caucenus, invaded the Cunei, who were subject to Rome, and captured Conistorgis.\nAftermath\nIn response to the Lusitanian battles, Mummius pursued the Lusitanian forces into Africa. Mummius successfully defeated the Lusitanian rebels and ended the siege at Ocile.\nSee also\n*Battle of the Tagus (153 BC)\n*Siege of Ocile\n*Conquest of Oxthracae\n*Lusitanian War\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
