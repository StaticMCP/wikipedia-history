Warszawa Land was divided into three counties: Warsaw, Tarczyn and Blonie.\nThe boundaries of Warszawa Land were established in the 14th century, and remained unchanged until the Partitions of Poland. Its total area was 2860&nbsp;km2, and in the 16th century, its southwestern corner was densely populated by poor szlachtas. Warsaw was located in the middle of the province.\nSources\n* Adolf Pawiński: Polska XVI wieku pod względem geograficzno-statystycznym. T. 5: Mazowsze. Warszawa: Księgarnia Gebethnera i Wolffa, 1895"
