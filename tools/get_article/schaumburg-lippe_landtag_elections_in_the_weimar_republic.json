Results with regard to the total vote, the percentage of the vote won and the number of seats allocated to each party are presented in the tables below. On 31 March 1933, the sitting Landtag was dissolved by the Nazi-controlled central government and reconstituted to reflect the distribution of seats in the national Reichstag. The Landtag subsequently was formally abolished as a result of the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" of 30 January 1934 which replaced the German federal system with a unitary state.\n1919\nThe 1919 Schaumburg-Lippe state election was held on 16 February 1919 to elect the 15 members of the Landtag.\nElections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany Elections in Germany}}\nReferences"
