It is available for Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. Conky is highly configurable and is able to monitor many system variables including the status of the CPU, memory, swap space, disk storage, temperatures, processes, network interfaces, battery power, system messages, e-mail inboxes, Arch Linux updates, many popular music players (MPD, XMMS2, BMPx, Audacious, etc.), weather updates, breaking news, and much more. Unlike system monitors that use high-level widget toolkits to render their information, Conky is drawn directly in an X window. This allows it to be configured such that it consumes relatively few system resources.\nConky was hailed as \"one of the best maintained, and definitely one of the most useful, programs in the world of open source\" in Linux Magazine.\nIt comes pre-configured in the default installation of Pinguy OS and CrunchBang Linux.\nHistory\nConky is a fork of [https://torsmo.sourceforge.net/ torsmo], a system monitor that is no longer maintained. Torsmo, however, continues to be used in systems where applications that use minimal resources are preferred. Damn Small Linux, for example, runs torsmo in its desktop root window on the default installation of its Live CD. Conky derives its name from a character in the Canadian television programme Trailer Park Boys.\nCommon uses\nWhile Conky is suited for use as a system monitor, it can also be used to gather and display many other sources of information and can be extended with the Lua programming language.\nConky has also been ported to devices such as the Nokia N900 and can be ported to practically any system with GCC and an X11 implementation.\nUsers have created and distributed many customized scripts, demonstrating Conky's modularity and versatility in function and appearance.
