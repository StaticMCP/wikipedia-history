It is located on the border with Bedfordshire, approximately  east of Newport Pagnell,  west of Bedford and  north-east of Central Milton Keynes.\nThe village name is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means \"east wood\".\nBuildings and landmarks\nMost of the older buildings in the village have thatched roofs making for a quaint rural setting.\nThe churchyard of the parish church of St Peter is considered by some as being one of the prettiest in the county. The Grade II-listed church dates from 1154 and includes a 14th-century window, bells dating from the 15th and 17th centuries, and a clock installed in 1774. It was closed to public worship in 2015, and in 2025, the church was put up for sale with planning permission for conversion into a three-bedroom home.\nAstwood and Hardmead civil parish\nTogether with the neighbouring village of Hardmead, it forms the civil parish of Astwood and Hardmead.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
