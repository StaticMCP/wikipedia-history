It will use an English translation of the Septuagint from the Codex Vaticanus for the Old Testament and the 1904 revision of the Patriarchal Text for the New Testament. The ACSB will feature \"synthetic patristic\" notes that align with pericopes rather than verse-by-verse commentary, as well as borrowing various study materials from the New Oxford Annotated Bible.\nHistory\nIn summer 2024, Oxford University Press (OUP) commissioned the ACSB. OUP established an editorial board, led by editors-in-chief Eugen J. Pentiuc, who served as an Old Testament general editor for the Orthodox Study Bible, and Paul M. Blowers, Dean E. Walker Professor of Church History at Emmanuel Christian Seminary.\nIt was first announced to the public on 8 July 2025 through the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America's press arm, the Orthodox Observer. Despite close relation to the Scriptural traditions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, particularly the use of the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Patriarchal Text as basis for the New Testament, the project carries an ecumenical focus, with plans to include annotations from the Oriental Orthodox traditions and from scholars outside Orthodox traditions.\nIt is currently unknown whether it will receive any sort of formal approval from Orthodox jurisdictions or their bishops.\nThe ACSB is currently in \"phase two\" of development, translating the Greek texts and developing the study notes. It is expected to release in one volume (complete with Old and New Testaments) by the end of 2027.\nStudy materials\nThe majority of ACSB annotations will be what it describes as \"synthetic patristic notes\", which follow the structure of pericope readings as opposed to verse-by-verse or line-by-line commentary, including:\n# Textual notes detailing variant OT readings from the Hebrew Bible, Peshitta, Vulgate, Greek variants of the Old Testament found in later Hellenistic Jewish translations, variants among codices that include the Septuagint, and various other manuscript fragments. The textual notes of the New Testament will also include variants from other Greek lectionaries.\n# Exegetical notes, namely to aid in establishing the various contexts of the respective pericope.\n# Patristic notes, to show interpretations from Church Fathers and other writers from the first millennium. The ACSB's announcement claims that patristic interpretations are selected through \"hermeneutical creativity\" and \"Nachleben,\" the use of ancient perspectives to support \"the Church's\" (presumably the Church pre-schism) teachings.\nThe ACSB will also include materials from the New Oxford Annotated Bible, including essays, maps, diagrams, tables, and a \"substantive selection of new essays.\"\nIt will feature the following essays:\n# Greek Patristic Interpretation of the Bible by Paul M. Blowers\n# ''Ancient Greek Philosophy's Impact on Ancient Christian Biblical Interpretation by Athanasios Despotis\n# Biblical Interpretation in Oriental Churches (Coptic, Ethiopic, Syriac, and Armenian) by Mary Farag\n# The Biblical Canon in Eastern Byzantine Church by Eugen J.

David Stark\nTranslators and editorial personnel\nThe editorial board consists of 2 editors-in-chief and 5 associate editors:\n# Eugen J. Pentiuc, Archbishop Demetrios Distinguished Professor of Biblical Studies and Christian Origins, Dean of Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology, Brookline, MA\n# Paul M. Blowers, Dean E.
