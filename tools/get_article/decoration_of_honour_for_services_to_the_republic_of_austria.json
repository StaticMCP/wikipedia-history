It is divided into 15 classes and is the highest award in the Austrian national honours system.\nHistory\nThe Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria was first established by federal law on 4 November 1922. It initially had ten grades; later, it was expanded to sixteen grades. It was replaced in 1934 by the Austrian Order of Merit (Österreichischer Verdienstorden).\nThe modern iteration of the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria was established by the National Council in 1952. It is conferred by the Republic of Austria to honour people (from Austria and abroad) who have rendered meritorious services to the country. Recipients are selected by the government. The awards are made by the President in accordance with the respective laws. The State President of Austria automatically receives the \"Grand Star of the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria\" by being elected to the office and holds this honour for life. This decoration should not be confused with other decorations in the Austrian honours system, such as the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.\nClasses\nThe Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria is divided into 15 classes, as follows:\n# Grand Star (Groß-Stern)\n# Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash (Großes Goldenes Ehrenzeichen am Bande)\n# Grand Decoration of Honour in Silver with Sash (Großes Silbernes Ehrenzeichen am Bande)\n# Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Star (Großes Goldenes Ehrenzeichen mit Stern)\n# Grand Decoration of Honour in Silver with Star (Großes Silbernes Ehrenzeichen mit Stern)\n# Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold (Großes Goldenes Ehrenzeichen)\n# Grand Decoration of Honour in Silver (Großes Silbernes Ehrenzeichen)\n# Grand Decoration of Honour (Großes Ehrenzeichen)\n# Decoration of Honour in Gold (Goldenes Ehrenzeichen)\n# Decoration of Honour in Silver (Silbernes Ehrenzeichen)\n# Decoration of Merit in Gold (Goldenes Verdienstzeichen)\n# Decoration of Merit in Silver (Silbernes Verdienstzeichen)\n#  Gold Medal (Goldene Medaille)\n# Silver Medal (Silberne Medaille)\n# Bronze Medal (Bronzene Medaille), no longer awarded\nThe \"Gold Medal for Services to the Republic of Austria\" may also be conferred as \"Gold Medal with Red Riband\" awarded for bravery and lifesaving.\nNotable recipients\nSee also List of honours of Austria awarded to heads of state and royalty\nBelow is a list of all Grand Star recipients and other notable recipients, in chronological order with year of award in parentheses:.\nGrand Star recipients\nRoyal Houses\n*Pakubowono X, Susuhunan of Surakarta from 1893 to 1939 (1926)\n*Hussein bin Talal, King of Jordan from 1952 to 1999 (1976)\n*Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974 (1954)\n*Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Emperor of Iran from 1941 to 1979 (1958)\n*Empress Farah, Empress Consort of Iran from 1959 to 1979 (1965)\n*Albert II, King of the Belgians from 1993 to 2013, now former King (1958)\n*Queen Paola of Belgium, Queen of the Belgians from 1993 to 2013, now former Queen (1997)\n*Bhumibol Adulyadej, King of Thailand from 1946 to 2016 (1964)\n*Sirikit, Queen of Thailand from 1950 to 2016 (1964)\n*Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth Realms from 1952 to 2022 (1966)\n*Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh consort of Elizabeth II from 1952 to 2021 (1966)\n*Olav V, King of Norway from 1957 to 1991 (1966)\n*Akihito, Emperor of Japan from 1989 to 2019, now Emperor Emeritus (1999)\n*Empress Michiko, Japanese empress consort from 1989 to 2019, now Empress Emerita (1999)\n*Qaboos bin Said al Said, Sultan of Oman from 1970 to 2020 (2001)\n*Margrethe II of Denmark, Queen of Denmark from 1972 to 2024, now former Queen (1964)\n*Carl XVI Gustaf, King of Sweden since 1973 (1967)\n*Queen Silvia of Sweden, Queen of Sweden since 1976 (1979)\n*Azlan Shah, Sultan of Perak from 1984 to 2014 and Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia from 1989 to 1994\n*Hassan II, King of Morocco from 1961 to 1999\n*Harald V, King of Norway since 1991\n*Queen Sonja of Norway, Queen of Norway since 1991 (1978)\n*Abdullah II, King of Jordan since 1999 (2001)\n*Queen Rania of Jordan since 1999 (2001)\n*Princess Anne, Princess Royal (1969)\n*Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein since 1989 (1991)\n*Princess Marie, Princess consort of Liechtenstein from 1989 to 2021 (2004)\n*Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, Grand Duke of Luxembourg from 2000 to 2025, now former Grand Duke (2013)\n*Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, from 2000 to 2025, now former Grand Duchess (2013)\n*Juan Carlos I, King of Spain from 1975 to 2014 now former King (1978)\n*Queen Sofía of Spain, Queen of Spain from 1975 to 2014 now former Queen (1978)\n*Haitham bin Tariq, Sultan of Oman, (2001)\n*Philippe of Belgium, King of the Belgians since 2013 (2022)\n*Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, King of the Netherlands since 2013 (2022)\n*Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, Queen of the Netherlands since 2013 (2022)\nPoliticians\n*Tassos Papadopoulos, Former President of the Republic of Cyprus from 2003 -
