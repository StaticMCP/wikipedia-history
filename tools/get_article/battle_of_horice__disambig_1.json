The Hussites were led by Jan Žižka (who was completely blind at the time of the battle), while the Catholics were led by the repeatedly-converting Čeněk of Wartenberg. The battle took place on the Gothard plateau, near Hořice. Thanks to a strategic position, which allowed perfect use of Hussite war wagons and Žižka's tactical skills, the Hussites eventually won the battle.\nHussites took the high ground and built their wagon fort there. The Catholic cavalry could not ride up such a steep hill and was forced to dismount. The cannons owned by the nobles could not fire effectively uphill. These circumstances made it a battle between infantry behind fortifications and heavily armored infantry in the field. Žižka's men held the Wagenburg against repeated attacks by dismounted cavalry. Then, Žižka decided that the time was right to counterattack. With some cavalry, the Hussites charged downhill and swept Catholic forces from the battlefield.\nReferences\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060304001712/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/matthaywood/main/Hussite_Battles_and_Significant_events.htm The Battles of the Hussite Wars]\n* \"The Hussite Wars (1419-36)\", Stephen Turnbull, Osprey Publishing ()"
