A Swedish force from Viborg under the command of Herman Fleming entered Kexholm, destroying almost all of the 400 buildings there, along with killing anyone they encountered.\nBackground\nEarlier in the 1560s, Herman Fleming had been commander of Weissenstein in Estonia on many occasions, and in the start of the Long Wrath the commander of Viborg (modern-day Vyborg). However, this post was handed to Henrik Klasson Horn and Erik Håkansson Slang. Fleming's forces were also significantly weakened in the autumn, when parts of it were sent to Livland and Sweden. However, the amount of cavalry was increased. Eventually, Horn was replaced by Gustaf Banér, who was also quickly replaced by Fleming as commander of the forces in Finland after John III was dissatisfied with his inactivity during the spring.\nInvasion\nIn late December, Fleming marched from Viborg with 3,000–15,000 men, most of them being cavalry. He marched along Äyräpää into Kexholm, plundering all the way to Korela Fortress. He burned the surrounding town on both sides of the Vuoksi river, along with a harbour warehouse and a monastery. During the invasion, most of the 400 buildings in Kexholm were destroyed. After, Fleming went towards Kronoborg (Kurkijoki) where the Swedes razed the village along with a church and two monasteries. Fleming's men went along Ladoga's shore, razing villages and killing anyone they encountered. The men usually managed to escape with skii's, while women, children, and the elderly were killed. Fleming eventually returned to Viborg on 8 January 1573 having completed his objective after a raid into Nöteborg county and all the way to the Neva.\nAftermath\nSoon after the attack, a Russian force of a few thousand men invaded Koporye county, but the invasion failed, with thousands of Russians being killed, along with several boyars being captured.\nSee also\n*\n*\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*"
