The land on which this Coffee Tavern is erected was purchased by Viscountess Ossington from Philip Handley, Esquire of Newark, at the cost of 4549l. for this purpose. The building, designed by Messrs, Ernest George and Peto, architects, Argyll-street, London, W., for a Coffee Tavern and Hostelry, at the cost of some 12,000l., exclusive of the site, and contains on the ground floor - general coffee room, boys'-room, kitchen, offices, &c. On the first floor, assembly-rooms for market dinners and other large gatherings; also a reading room, library, and club room for Masonic and other benefit societies. On the second floor there is a billiard-room and dormitories for travellers. There is also stabling for 30 horses, with cart shed, &c., for farmers on market days, a tea garden for refreshments in summer time, and a bowling alley. The work was carried out by Messrs. Smith and Lunn, buildings, of Newark-on-Trent, Mr. C. Leach being clerk of the works.\nThe tavern was opened on 23 November 1882 and named after Lady Ossington, widow of Evelyn Denison, 1st Viscount Ossington, who had funded its construction. The final cost of construction was £13,500 () and Lady Ossington endowed it with £20,000. Including the initial cost of the land, the total contribution from Lady Ossington was £38,049 ().\nThe carving of the woodwork, including the ceilings and cornices was by Walker Smith of London. The river side of the tavern included a garden planted with limes which was intended as a German \"Bier Garten\" to provide a space for outdoor musical entertainment in the summer. The garden also contained a large oak summer-house, and a flagstaff  tall. On the south east of the tavern facing Castle Gate was another garden planted with acacias and enclosed with iron railings. The establishment also included stables for 48 horses and a carriage-house. Messrs Benham and Sons of London equipped the kitchen with the latest facilities.\nThe building was not a successful commercial venture as a temperance tavern and in 1889 it became a private hotel.\nIn 1942 it was taken over by the Air Ministry to accommodate airmen from RAF Winthorpe.\nIn 1971 it was designated a Grade II* listed building.\nIn 2014 it was sold to become a Zizzi pizza restaurant with other residential and retail units. In 2021 this branch of Zizzi's closed, leaving the ground floor empty.\nIn January 2024, Stray's café and bistro moved from their Middlegate location in Newark to The Ossington and returned it to its original purpose. In March 2025, it was announced that Stray's was closing.\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Nottinghamshire\n*Listed buildings in Newark-on-Trent\nReferences"
