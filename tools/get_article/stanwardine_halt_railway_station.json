It was opened in the 1930s as part of the GWR's halt construction programme, aimed at combatting growing competition from bus services. Today the route is part of the Shrewsbury to Chester line. Nothing now remains on the site.\nHistorical services\nExpress trains did not call at Stanwardine Halt, only local services. No freight or parcels traffic was handled here.\nReferences\nNeighbouring stations\n| previous =\n| route    = Great Western RailwayShrewsbury to Chester Line\n| col      = }}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#341,323,1 Stanwardine Halt on navigable 1946 O.S. map]"
