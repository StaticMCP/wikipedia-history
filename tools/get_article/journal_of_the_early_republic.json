The journal is published by The University of North Carolina Press on behalf of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. The first issue published, Vol. 1, No. 1, was released in 1981. As of date, the current editors-in-chief are Johann Neem and Ronald Angelo Johnson.\nWhen it was founded, the journal first issued stated it was dedicated to study of \"the first six decades of the United States under the Federal Constitution\", approximately 1789 to 1850, in the interest of breaking down barriers between the traditional periodization of the time into the Federalist Era, Jeffersonian Era, and Age of Jackson.\nReferences\nSources\n* }}"
