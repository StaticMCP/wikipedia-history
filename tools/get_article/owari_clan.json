They share this history with the Izumo clan of Izumo-taisha, the Aso clan of Aso Shrine, the  of Munakata Taisha, the Amabe clan of Kono Shrine and the Yamato clan of Ōyamato Shrine.\nHistory\nOrigins and genealogy\nIn Shinsen Shōjiroku, the descendants of Amatsuhikone, Ame-no-hohi, and , together with the descendants of Amenohoakari are referred to as Tenson-zoku. The Tenson-zoku descended from Takamagahara (Plain of High Heaven) to Owari and Tanba provinces, and are considered to be the ancestors of the Owari clan, as well as three other clans , Amabe, and  clans.\nHowever, Toshio Hoga argues that , which records these four clans as descendants of Amenohoakari, is a forged document, and that these clans actually descended from the sea deity Watatsumi. In addition, Owari clan's genealogy includes the great-grandson of Watatsumi, Takakuraji, as their ancestor, and he argues this is the original genealogy.\nAtsuta Shrine\nThe \"Daijingu engi\" records show that during Emperor Temmu's time, the divine sword Kusanagi no Tsurugi was returned to the palace. Seven guardians were then appointed to oversee its worship. These guardians were linked to Miyazu-hime and .\nMiyazu-hime the wife of Yamato Takeru was a member of the clan\nAccording to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the 43rd year of Emperor Keiko's reign (景行天皇43年, equivalent 113 AD).  The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow Miyazu-hime venerated his memory in a shrine at her home. Sometime later, these relics and the sacred sword were moved to the current location of the Atsuta Shrine.\nNihonshoki explains that this move occurred in the 51st year of Keiko's reign, but shrine tradition also dates this event in the 1st year of Emperor Chūai's reign.\nThe Owari clan established the Atsuta Shrine in 192, and held the position of the shrine's high priest since ancient times, passing it down from generation to generation. Yamato Takeru and Miyazu-hime and her brother  are worshipped at the shrine.\nWhen Miyasuhime died, a shrine was set up in her honor in Hikami. Her clan members became priests there. Inatane, the eleventh descendant of Amenohoakari, founded the Owari clan. As a result, Atsuta Myojin became the Owari clan's Ujigami.\nThe shrine, originally a Betsugu, later became a Sessha. It was founded in the fourth year of Chtiai (195), about 80 years after Yamato Takeru no Mikoto's death. Miyasuhime was young when she knew Yamato Takeru no Mikoto.\nLater history\nThe \"Owariuji keizu\" and shrine records reveal that during the times of Emperors Temmu, Jito, and Mommu, Owari no Muraji Inaki and his son, Owari no Muraji Inaoki, were Daiguji. Tadashika held this office for 40 years, from 1045 to 1084. His grandson, Suenori, succeeded him.\nTadanobu's eldest son, Tadayori, was the first Horishi, later called Gonguji. Other positions included Sokengyo and Ouchibito. The Tajima Daiki, and Baba families were known as the Shinkwan.\nBelow the Shinkwan were the Negi, also called Churo. Notable families included Awata Mabito, Ohara Mabito, Hayashi Asomi, Matsuoka Mabito, and Kume. Some had rights to worship at Hikami Jinja.In 1114, Kazumoto handed the position over to Fujiwara no Suenori, who was from the Fujiwara clan. Since then, the Fujiwara clan became the head of Atsuta Shrine, while the Owari clan stepped down to the position of adjutant chief priest (gongūji).\nIn Hoei I (1704), the Daiguji's decision to appoint an Atsuta Hoshi from Jingu-ji led to protests from the Negi families. The protest was not successful.\nCultural influence\nAccording to one theory, Danpusan Kofun is the tomb of a powerful chieftain of the Owari clan, perhaps , who is mentioned in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles of the Nara period, and whose daughter married the semi-legendary Emperor Keitai and who was the mother of Emperor Ankan and Emperor Senka. According to legend Miyazu-hime a member of the clan is buried in Danpusan Kofun.\nThe Owari clan was influential on the development of the Kujiki. It was mainly written as a compilation of elements from the Kojiki, Nihongi and Kogo Shui, likely by an author from the Mononobe clan. However it also contains unique elements from neither. Book 5 is believed to preserve traditions of the Mononobe and Owari clans not found elsewhere, and Book 10 preserves the earlier historical record the .\nThe Owari clan established the Atsuta Shrine.'s birthplace, Suenori's villa, at Seigan-ji.]]\nGenealogy\nNotes\nReferences"
