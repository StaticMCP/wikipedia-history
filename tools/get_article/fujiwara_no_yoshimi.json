A deep believer in Buddhism, his long habit of abstaining from meat and eating simple food meant that all his life he was extremely thin.\nThe same text records a number of anecdotes about his life, as follow:\n*Once, when Emperor Ninmyō had boiled some medicine to remove its impurities, he ordered his retainers to taste it to determine its consistencies. Nervous, nobody would try it, but Yoshimi took the cup and drank it all. Ninmyō is said to have praised Yoshimi for respecting his duty to his master.\n*Yoshimi studied Buddhist writings and was familiar with the Shingon school. When his wife died in Yoshimi's thirties, he immersed himself in prayer to shake off his desires and never remarried.\nLegends\nThe Konjaku Monogatarishū contains a story in which Yoshimi defends Ono no Takamura who was still a student, when the latter is accused of a crime. Later, Yoshimi dies of sickness and is taken before Enma in Hell. Takamura, now working in Enma's palace as a retainer and assisting in his judgments, intervenes, and Yoshimi is forgiven and returned to life.\nGenealogy\n*Father: Fujiwara no Fuyutsugu\n*Mother: , daughter of\n*Wife: Daughter of\n**Eldest son:\n**Son:\n**Son:\n*Other children:\n**Son:\n**Eldest daughter: , court lady of Emperor Montoku\n**Daughter: , court lady of Emperor Seiwa\n**Daughter: wife of\nAlthough Yoshimi had many children, his eldest son Tokitsura died young after advancing to the rank of dainagon, and none of his other descendants were able to reach the level of kugyō. However, Yoshimi's obituary entry in the Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku does praise the talent and conduct of Tadakata and Naokata, and especially Tadakata's ability with clerical script. Yoshimi's brothers Yoshifusa and Nagara married their daughters to emperors Montoku and Seiwa and were thus able to become the grandfathers of the emperors born of those marriages, but while Yoshimi married off his daughters similarly, neither of them was fortunate enough to bear the emperor any children.\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
