The group included Ministers Mandisi Mpahlwa, Jeff Radebe and Pallo Jordan and Deputy Minister Sue van der Merwe. Mbeki met with Republic of the Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso on the trip. Mbeki also addressed a joint session of the Parliament of the Republic of the Congo.\nIn October 2009, the Congolese government signed an agreement to lease 200,000 hectares of land to South African farmers.
