The Hussites were led by Jan Žižka, while the Imperial forces were led by King Sigismund. The Hussite army surprised a several thousand strong Hungarian force, part of the Sigismund-led army, resting near the village of Nebovidy (in central Bohemia, near Kolin). The Hungarians had no time to mobilize and regroup and the Hussites were victorious. This was the final battle of a larger conflict – the battle of Kutna Hora.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Battle of nebovidy\n\n#REDIRECT Battle of Nebovidy"
