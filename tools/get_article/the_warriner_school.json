The school was founded in 1971 and now has 1,500 pupils in the 11–18 age range, having opened a sixth form in September 2013. It has Technology College status and serves the villages in the northern half of the Cherwell District. It is notable for operating a large school farm.\nThe school is named after Doreen Warriner who was born nearby and is buried in Bloxham.\nFarming and rural studies\nThe school premises contain a farm,  in size and fully organic for livestock and grassland. The school has won the NFU's Rural School Of The Year Award 2005 and SSAT's Most Improved Schools Club Award 2005–06. The farm sells its produce, including, meat, eggs, and livestock, although school farm produce is not used for student consumption. In late 2015, the Warriner School farm shop closed down due to lack of sales. The farm itself still runs.\nThe Warriner Farm is also used for educational purposes for the students of The Warriner School.\nPartnership and academy status\nA school partnership is a group of schools that are usually primary schools feeding into the same secondary school.\nThe Warriner Partnership contains the following schools:\n* Bishop Loveday School in Bodicote, Oxfordshire\n* Bishop Carpenter School in North Newington, Oxfordshire\n* Sibford Gower Endowed Primary School in Sibford Gower, Oxfordshire\n* Christopher Rawlins School in Adderbury, Oxfordshire\n* Hornton School in Hornton\n* Bloxham Primary School in Bloxham, Oxfordshire\n* Shenington School in Shenington, Oxfordshire\n* Wroxton School in Wroxton, Oxfordshire\n* Dr Radcliffes School in Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire\n* Deddington School in Deddington, Oxfordshire\nIn August 2015, The Warriner School converted to academy status and is now part of The Warriner Multi Academy Trust.\nFebruary 2023 protests\nOn 24 February 2023, the students of The Warriner School staged a protest sparked by an email regarding uniform changes.
