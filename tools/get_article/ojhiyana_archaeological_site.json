The 2000-01 excavation yielded white painted black and red wares, terracotta bulls, cow figurines, copper tools, and various beads, dating from the 3rd to 2nd millennium B.C.\nExcavations\nThe Jaipur Circle of the Survey, led by B.R. Meena and Alok Tripathi, conducted excavations at Ojiyana, 30&nbsp;km southwest of Beawar in the hilly region of District Bhilwara. The site's unique hill slope location distinguishes it from other Ahar culture sites in Ahar river valleys.\nExcavation details\nThe site revealed a single-culture deposit with a thickness of about 7.5 m, divided into three phases based on pottery and structural evidence. Initial settlers used sun-dried mud-bricks for houses on the natural rock. In Phase II, locally available stones were used for construction, marking a shift. Phase III showed a decline with evidence of a devastating fire.\nCultural continuity\nDespite changes, the excavation displayed cultural continuity from the 3rd millennium B.C. to mid-2nd millennium B.C., indicating permanent settlement, growth, development, and decline, alongside the assimilation of new ideas.\nAntiquities\nUnique findings include terracotta bulls, white-painted and stylized, termed \"Ojiyana bulls,\" possibly used in ceremonies. Terracotta cow figurines, a copper chopper, Harappan-type faïence, and various beads were discovered. Ornaments included copper and shell bangles, copper rings, and pendants. Agricultural tools like saddle-querns and hammer-stones were also unearthed.\nReferences"
