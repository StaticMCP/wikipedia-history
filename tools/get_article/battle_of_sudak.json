The Sultan resolved into military action and appointed the governor of Sinop, Husam al-Din Choban, to lead a military campaign against Sudak.\nArriving at Sudak, Husam al-Din found the city anxious to come to terms. The people declared themselves as loyal to the Sultan and offered to pay tribute. However, it was a ruse, as they attempted to collect time while a combined Rus-Kipchak army came to their aid. Husam, however, refused these terms and began landing his troops and holding a banquet.\nThe next morning, he was surprised by the newly arrived army. The Seljuks successfully fought off the attack with fierce struggle.\nAfter this defeat, the Russians sent an envoy to Husam declaring loyalty. He agreed on the condition that the Rus would pay tribute. He also sent slaves and booty back to Anatolia. Husam then marched to the city itself and was successfully captured after a fierce fight. The Seljuks imposed the Islamic law. A mosque was built and Muslim scholars were appointed. Husam then returned to Anatolia, leaving a garrison in the city.\nReferences\nSources\n*A. C. S.
