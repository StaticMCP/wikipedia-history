The government adopted the policy in March 2016 in place of the New Exploration Licensing Policy 1997.[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=137638] [https://www.financialexpress.com/market/commodities/from-nelp-to-help-can-a-new-policy-transform-the-oil-and-gas-exploration-and-production-sector-in-india/428346/]\nMain features of the policy\n* Uniform license for exploration and production of all forms of hydrocarbon  such as coal bed methane, shale gas and oil, tight gas and gas hydrates.\n* An open acreage policy that allows companies to select the exploration blocks on their own without waiting for the formal bidding round from the government.\n* Easy to administer revenue sharing model as the government needs to audit only the production and revenue of companies (not costs). The subjective criterion of cost recovery has ended.\n* Marketing and pricing freedom for the crude oil and natural gas produced.\nReferences\n1. https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cabinet-relaxes-nelp-pre-nelp-pact-rules/article24454109.ece\n2.http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=137638"
