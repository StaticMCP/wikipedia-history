It is located in Independence Square (formerly Torrington Square) in the Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo. It also houses the Independence Memorial Museum.\nThe monument was built at the location where the formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester occurred at a special podium on 4 February 1948.\nLocated at the head of the monument is the statue of the first prime minister of the country Rt. Hon. Don Stephen Senanayake \"The Father of the Nation\". Most of the annual National Independence Day celebrations have been held here. Apart from being a monument, it served  as the ceremonial assembly hall for the Senate of Ceylon and the House of Representatives of Ceylon until the parliament was moved to the new parliament complex. Currently it is the venue for religious events and annual national day celebrations.\nDesign\nThe building was designed by a group of eight notable architects led by Tom Neville Wynne-Jones CBE, and included F. H. Billimoria, Shirley de Alwis, Oliver Weerasinghe, Homi Billimoria, Justin Samarasekera, and M. B. Morina. The design of the building is based on the Magul Maduwa (Celebration Hall), the Royal audience hall of the Kingdom of Kandy the last native kingdom of the island, where on 5 March 1815 the Kandyan Convention was signed between the British and the Kandyian Chieftains (Radalas) ending the Kingdom of Kandy.\nIn popular culture\nThe Memorial Hall was featured as a pit stop on the 4th season of The Amazing Race Asia, the 1st season of The Amazing Race Australia, and the second season of the Israeli edition of The Amazing Race.\nEvents\n* Independence Celebrations\n* Oaths ceremony of President Maithripala Sirisena\n* Funeral of President Ranasinghe Premadasa\n* Funeral of Gamini Dissanayake\n* Funeral of Lakshman Kadirgamar\n* Funeral of W.
