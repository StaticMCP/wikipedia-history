The BPFI was formed in 2014 from the merger of the Irish Payment Services Organisation with the Irish Banking Federation (IBF). Its predecessor, the Irish Banking Federation, was founded in 1973 upon Ireland's accession to the European Communities. The IBF in turn succeeded the Irish Banks Standing Committee established upon independence in 1922.\nFormer Fianna Fáil Senator and Party General Secretary Pat Farrell is the chief executive.\nThe group comprises domestic and international banks and financial services institutions operating in Ireland, and works with members, government, the Central Bank of Ireland and other groups to support the development and growth of the banking sector in Ireland. In 2009, the group ran seminars for the Irish financial services industry on data protection, customer relationship management and fraud prevention.\nThe Federation is a member of the European Banking Federation and the International Banking Federation.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ibf.ie Irish Banking Federation]"
