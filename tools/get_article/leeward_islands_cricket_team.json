Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, Montserrat, British Virgin Islands, US Virgin Islands and Sint Maarten are members of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association. The team does not participate in any international competitions (though Antigua and Barbuda took part at the 1998 Commonwealth Games), but rather in inter-regional competitions in the Caribbean, such as the Regional Four Day Competition and the Regional Super50. The team competes in regional cricket under the franchise name Leeward Islands Hurricanes.\nThe Leeward Islands has won a total of ten domestic titles – four in first class cricket and six in one-day cricket, but their last title was in 1997–98 when they won the double (although the first-class title was shared with Guyana). The list of prominent cricketers who have played for the Leewards Islands includes Curtly Ambrose, Eldine Baptiste, Kenny Benjamin, Winston Benjamin, Sheldon Cottrell, George Ferris, Ridley Jacobs, Viv Richards, Richie Richardson, Andy Roberts and Hayden Walsh Jr.\nHistory\nThe Leeward Islands played their inaugural first-class game in 1958, and lost by an innings and 19 runs to Jamaica. Their first win did not come until 1968–69, when they beat Guyana by 43 runs at the Warner Park Sporting Complex ground. From 1965–66 to 1980–81 the team competed as the Combined Islands in first-class cricket, along with the best cricketers from the Windward Islands. However, when regular one-day competitions began in 1975–76 the island groups were separate, and the Leeward Islands won on their third outing in 1977–78.\nIn 1981–82 the Leeward Islands made their debut in the Shell Shield with a 57-run win over the Windward Islands (the season after the Combined Islands had won the title), but it was to take eight seasons until they could lift the first-class trophy – which by then had been renamed the Red Stripe Cup. From 1989–90 to 1997–98, the Leeward Islands won three outright first-class titles with one shared and three outright one-day titles with one shared. Since then their only major trophy has been their 2010–11 WICB Cup triumph.\nSquad\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Birth date\n! Batting style\n! Bowling style\n!
