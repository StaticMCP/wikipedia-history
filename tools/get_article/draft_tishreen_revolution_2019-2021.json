It was one of the largest protest movements in Iraq since 2003, mainly led by youth, civil activists, and students, demanding an end to corruption, unemployment, poor public services, and foreign (especially Iranian) influence.\nBackground\nIraq had faced decades of political instability, corruption, and weak governance following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. By 2019, frustration grew among Iraqis due to unemployment, electricity shortages, lack of basic services, and perceived dominance of foreign powers, particularly Iran, over Iraqi politics.\nEvents\nThe protests began in Baghdad and quickly spread to southern provinces including Najaf, Karbala, Basra, and Nasiriyah. Demonstrators occupied public squares such as Tahrir Square and faced violent crackdowns by security forces and Iran-backed militias. Despite repression, the movement persisted, forcing the resignation of Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi in late 2019.\nIn 2020–2021, Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi attempted reforms and promised early elections, which were eventually held in October 2021.\nParticipants\nProtesters\n* Iraqi youth, students, civil activists, labor groups.\n* Carried Iraqi flags and banners calling for reform and national sovereignty.\nGovernment and Militias\n* Iraqi Government security forces.\n* Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF).\n* Iran-backed militias such as:\n** Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq\n** Kata'ib Hezbollah\n** Badr Organization\nResults\n* Partial victory for protesters.\n* Resignation of Adil Abdul-Mahdi government (December 2019).\n* Early elections held in 2021.\n* Rise of pro-Tishreen parties in parliament.\n* Decline of Iranian influence and weakening of militia power.\n* Protesters failed to completely overthrow the political system.\nSee also\n* 2019–2021 Iraqi protests\n* Arab Spring\n* Iran–Iraq relations\nReferences"
