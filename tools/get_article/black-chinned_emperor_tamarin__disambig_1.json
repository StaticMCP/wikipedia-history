Unlike the bearded emperor tamarin, it has no beard. It is distributed throughout the rainforests of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. Not much on its conservation is known, so it is listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN. After a gestation period of 140–145 days, females usually give birth to one or two young. It is the same size as the emperor tamarin and it eats almost the same food: bugs, spiders, fruit, tree sap, and nectar.\nReferences\n* Rylands, A.B. & Mittermeier, R.A. 2008.
