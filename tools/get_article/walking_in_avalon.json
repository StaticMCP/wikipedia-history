It is distributed by CMC International. In late 1999, CMC re-released the package as two single-album releases.  The studio album is entitled Red Room, and the hits live release is Christopher Cross - Greatest Hits Live.\nWriting and production\nWritten and produced with Rob Meurer, and featuring multi-instrumentalist/co-producer Scott Frankfurt, the two-CD set comprises music.\nThe first record of new compositions by Cross and Meurer. Backing tracks created by Frankfurt and orchestral settings by Jeremy Lubbock are included.\nThe second record is a 74-minute live concert recording in which Cross performs nearly all of his earlier hits (including \"Sailing\", \"Ride Like the Wind\", \"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\", and \"Think of Laura\") as well as a number of his lesser-known mid-period songs. Through a printing error, the band credits for this concert were omitted from the CD notes.\nBesides Cross on vocals and guitar, featured are Rob Meurer (keyboards, dulcimer, vocals), Chas Thompson (bass, vocals), Gigi Worth (percussion, guitar, vocals), Kiki Ebsen (keyboards, vocals), and Jody Cortez (drums), with Joel Peskin on alto saxophone and a special guest appearance by Michael McDonald.\nTrack listing\nDisc 1\n#\"In a Red Room\"\n#\"Walking in Avalon\"\n#\"Hunger\"\n#\"When She Smiles\"\n#\"It's Always Something\"\n#\"Dream Too Loud\"\n#\"I Know You Well \"\n#\"Kind of I Love You\"\n#\"Curled Around the World\"\n#\"Rainy Day in Vancouver\"\nDisc 2 (Live)\n#\"Rendezvous\"\n#\"Never Be the Same\"\n#\"Back of My Mind\"\n#\"Sailing\"\n#\"Every Turn of the World\"\n#\"Deputy Dan\"\n#\"In the Blink of an Eye\"\n#\"Swept Away\"\n#\"Think of Laura\"\n#\"Minstrel Gigolo\"\n#\"Open Up My Window\"\n#\"Alibi\"\n#\"Is There Something\"\n#\"Arthur's Theme\"\n#\"Ride Like the Wind\"\n#\"All Right\"\nSee also\n* Back to Avalon\nReferences"
