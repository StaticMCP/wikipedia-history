As with earlier censuses, the form asked whether any \"lunatics\", \"imbeciles\" or \"idiots\" lived in the household, causing the Registrar General to observe that: \"It is against human nature to expect a mother to admit her young child to be an idiot, however much she may fear this to be true. To acknowledge the fact is to abandon all hope.\"\nThe total population of England, Wales and Scotland was recorded as 29,707,207.\nNotables named in the census included Winston Churchill, Karl Marx and Charles Darwin.\nIndexing\nThe 1881 census was the first UK census to be indexed in its entirety. In the 1980s, in a project that has been characterised as \"the largest collection of historical source material to be made available in computerised form\", and \"the first major 'crowd-sourced' exercise in the world\", the Genealogical Society of Utah began collaborating with the Federation of Family History Societies and the Scottish Association of Family History Societies to produce an index to the 1881 census for England, Wales, Scotland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.\nIn 1994 and 1995 the resulting index was published, county by county, on microfiche, and made available to institutions.\nIn 1999 the index was published on a set of 24 CD-ROMs and made available to the general public.\nIn August 2001 the index for Scotland was made available online on Scots Origins, then the official data site of the General Register Office for Scotland, and is now available on its successor ScotlandsPeople. In February 2003, the remaining material was made available free of charge on the FamilySearch website.\nFree access to the online index is now available from several other sites, though the Scottish data remains exclusive to ScotlandsPeople.\nResults\nScotland\nThe 1881 census in Scotland was the first census to count the numbers of Gaelic speakers.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:140px;\"| Registration county !!
