Williams had already had great success with his albums named after Henry Mancini's Oscar winners from 1961 and 1962, \"Moon River\" and \"Days of Wine and Roses\", and was asked to sing Mancini and Johnny Mercer's title song collaboration  from the 1963 film Charade at the Academy Awards on April 13, 1964, after it was nominated for Best Original Song, but the winner that year was the other song that Williams performed at the ceremony, \"Call Me Irresponsible\".\nThe album made its first appearance on Billboard magazine's Top LP's chart in the issue dated May 9, 1964 and remained on the album chart for 63 weeks, peaking at number five. it also debuted on the Cashbox albums chart in the issue dated May 9, 1964, and remained on the chart for in a total of 56 weeks, peaking at four. It received Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America on December 18, 1964.\nAs the B-side of the single \"A Fool Never Learns,\" the album's opening track, \"Charade\", made its debut on the Billboard Hot 100 on January 18, 1964, spending its only week on the chart at number 100.\nThe album was released on compact disc as one of two albums on one CD by Collectables Records on March 23, 1999, along with Williams's 1964 Columbia album, The Great Songs from \"My Fair Lady\" and Other Broadway Hits.  This same pairing was also released as two albums on one CD by Sony Music Distribution in 2000. The Academy Award-Winning \"Call Me Irresponsible\" and Other Hit Songs from the Movies was included in a box set entitled Classic Album Collection, Vol. 1, which contains 17 of his studio albums and three compilations and was released on June 26, 2001.\nReception\n| rev2 = The Encyclopedia of Popular Music\n| rev2Score =\n| rev3 = Record Mirror\n| rev3score =\n}}\nWilliam Ruhlmann of Allmusic was complimentary. \"The songs tended to be evocative of a mood rather than specific, and Williams's warm, yet homogenized approach, backed by sympathetic orchestral arrangements with occasional vocal choruses, brought out their haunting, romantic qualities.\" He even singled out specific tracks. \"Especially impressive here were 'Laura,' a version of 'Gigi' with the introductory verse, and a restrained (well, compared to Mario Lanza) 'Be My Love.' But the whole album suggested that Williams and movie songs remained perfect partners.\"\nIn their capsule review at the time of its release, Billboard magazine described the album as a \"fine collection\" and noted that \"Andy's singing is most enjoyable\".\nCashbox mentions \"his renditions of “More,” “Gigi,” “Love Letters,” “Charade” are Warm and winning, and superb listening\".\nVariety notes \"Williams' very effective way with a ballad, in particular way those adult lyrics, is demonstrated here with lucid performances of such songs as 'Charade', 'Laura',  ... and among others.\nRecord Mirror noted \"he has a great understanding with M. D. Robert Mersey. \"Never Stop Loving is a great track\"\nTrack listing\nSide one\n# \"Charade\" (Henry Mancini, Johnny Mercer) – 2:35\n# \"Mona Lisa\" (Ray Evans, Jay Livingston) – 2:54\n# \"Call Me Irresponsible\" (Sammy Cahn, Jimmy Van Heusen) – 3:10\n# \"I'll Never Stop Loving You\" (Nicholas Brodszky, Cahn) – 2:38\n# \"Madrigal\" (Malcolm Arnold, Mack David) – 3:11\n# \"Be My Love\" (Nicholas Brodszky, Cahn) – 3:15\nSide two\n# \"More\" (Norman Newell, Nino Oliviero, Riz Ortolani) – 2:32\n# \"Laura\" (Mercer, David Raksin) – 2:50\n# \"Anniversary Song\" (Saul Chaplin, Al Jolson) – 2:58\n# \"Gigi\" (Alan Jay Lerner, Frederick Loewe) – 4:07\n# \"The Song from Moulin Rouge\" (Georges Auric, William Engvick) – 2:26\n# \"Love Letters\" (Edward Heyman, Victor Young) – 2:57\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1964)\n!Peak\nposition\n|-\n|US Top LPs (Billboard)\n| align=\"center\" |5\n|-\n|US Cashbox\n| align=\"center\" |4\n|}\nSingles\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Title\n!U.S. Hot 100\n|-\n|1964\n|\"Charade\"\n| align=\"center\" |100\n|-\n|}\nGrammy nominations\nThis album brought the fifth of six Grammy nominations that Williams received over the course of his career, this time in the category for Best Vocal Performance, Male. This nomination did not focus on the performance of a particular song but rather Williams's performance of the album as a whole.
