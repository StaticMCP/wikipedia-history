It was designed by English sculptor David Backhouse and unveiled in November 2004 by Anne, Princess Royal.\nHistory\nThe memorial was inspired by Jilly Cooper's 1983 book Animals in War, and was made possible by a specially created fund of £1.4 million from public donations of which Cooper was a co-trustee. The memorial consists of a 55&nbsp;ft by 58&nbsp;ft (16.8&nbsp;m by 17.7&nbsp;m) curved Portland stone wall: the symbolic arena of war, emblazoned with images of various struggling animals, along with two heavily laden bronze mules progressing up the stairs of the monument, and a bronze horse and bronze dog beyond it looking into the distance.\nLocated on Park Lane, at the junction with Upper Brook Street, on the eastern edge of the park, The Animals in War Memorial was officially opened on 24 November 2004 by Anne, Princess Royal.\nIn May 2013 it was one of two London war memorials vandalised on the same night. The word \"Islam\" was spray-painted on it causing £2,766 in damage, and the nearby RAF Bomber Command Memorial suffered £6,500 in damage. A 31-year-old man later admitted to vandalising the memorials and was charged for a total of 94 vandalism and destruction of property offences carried out over several weeks against homes, cars, memorials and a church, causing over £50,000 in damage.\nInscriptions\nThe inscriptions are in various forms and sizes and are all uppercase designed and cut by Andrew Whittle. Other than the featured messages, there are several inscriptions on the rear or outside, and on the inner edges of the wings (in the gap), attributing the creators and funders.\nOn the face of the right wing when viewed from the front or inside:\n: Main heading; the largest and heaviest cut inscription\n: Directly beneath the main heading\n: Beneath and to the right of the main heading\nOn the face of the left wing when viewed from the rear or outside (on the reverse of the main heading):\nSee also\n* Dickin MedalInstituted in 1943 in the United Kingdom by Maria Dickin to honour the work of animals in World War II\n* PDSA Gold MedalRecognised as the animal equivalent of the George Cross; acknowledges the bravery and devotion to duty of animals\n* Purple poppyA symbol of remembrance in the United Kingdom for animals that served during wartime\n* Horse Memorial, Port ElizabethA monument to the horses that served and died in the Second Boer War, erected in 1905\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.animalsinwar.org.uk/ The Official Animals in War Memorial Fund Website]\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/realmedia/2004/11/animals_in_war.ram \"Somerset sculptor designs Animals in War memorial\"] at BBC News (includes RealAudio download)\n* [http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/featuring/war03.html The Animals in War Memorial] at Purr 'n' Fur—Another brief article, featuring a number of pictures of the memorial]\n* [http://www.harrygray.co.uk/animals.htm Animals in War.
