It was named for the Darling Downs region.\nThe district covered rural areas in southern Queensland to the immediate west and north of Toowoomba, not including the city itself. Darling Downs included the towns of Dalby, Oakey and Crows Nest. The electorate was first created for the 2001 election.\nIn 2008, Darling Downs was abolished – with effect at the 2009 election – following a redistribution undertaken by the Electoral Commission of Queensland. Its former territory and voters were divided between the districts of Warrego, Nanango, Toowoomba North and a new seat called Condamine.\nAn earlier district based in the same region was also called Darling Downs. It existed as a single member electorate from 1873 to 1878 and as a dual member electorate from 1878 to 1888.\nMembers for Darling Downs\nFirst incarnation (1873–1888)\nSingle member electorate (1873–1878)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Image\n!Member\n!Party\n!Term\n!Notes\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Edward Wienholt\n| Ministerialist\n| 4 November 1873 –1 February 1875\n| Resigned so he could travel to Europe\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| William Graham\n| Unaligned\n| 23 March 1875 –26 November 1878\n| Won by-election.
