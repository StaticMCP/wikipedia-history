The sculpture is in the center of the large rectangular Piazza Grande, or Piazza Napoleone, in front of the palace had been cleared in 1806 by the Napoleonic government, in the process razing houses, warehouses, and the church of San Pietro Maggiore. Initially a statue honoring Napoleon had been planned for this spot, but Maria Luisa, who held a personal antipathy to the former French emperor and his family (Napoleon's sister Elisa Bonaparte had ruled Lucca as Princess of Lucca and Piombino until 1814), squelched that idea in favor of a monument to Charles II, Duke of Parma. That monument was putatively moved to the ramparts of the town. In 1823, the year before the death of Maria Luisa, it was decided to dedicate a statue in her honor in gratitude for her patronage of the city aqueduct. The monument was designed by the Neoclassical Tuscan sculptor Bartolini.\nBartolini's Monument to Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi\nThe awkward statue depicts the somewhat rotund Duchess with naked boy at her side. He holds a cornucopia, she holds a roll of paper and a peculiar staff. The arrangement, also somewhat awkwardly, does have some similarities (woman with staff beside a young boy) with Bartolini's earlier Monument to Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi.\nReferences"
