The first essay, \"Lying in Politics\" looks for an explanation behind the administration's deception regarding the Vietnam War, as revealed in the Pentagon Papers. \"Civil Disobedience\" examines the opposition movements, while the final \"Thoughts on Politics and Revolution\" is a commentary, in the form of an interview on the third essay, \"On Violence\".\nOn Violence\nIn \"On Violence\", the third of these essays, Arendt breaks with the predominant conception of power as derived from violence, and that violence is an extreme manifestation of power. Power and violence are separate phenomena:\n}}\nThe explanation is that governmental violence requires organisation, i.e. power:\n}}\nMore generally, Arendt defines power as property of a group:\n}}\nThough violence is not a precondition for power, it may nevertheless be a means of power.\n}}\nBureaucracies then attract violence since they are defined as the \"rule by no one\" against whom to argue. Thus, bureaucracies exclude the relations with the people they rule over.\nThe Arendt-Agamben Correspondence\nOn February 21, 1970, twenty-seven-year-old Giorgio Agamben ground-mailed a typewritten request for Hannah Arendt to review his \"On the Limits of Violence\" and that he had \"take[n] the liberty of enclosing an essay on violence...\" In a response drafted less than a week later, Arendt admitted that \"it will take me quite a while to read it because my Italian is not just lousy, but almost nonexistent.\" Arendt had previously claimed that literati Zera S. Fink's 1945 book on \"Venetian vogue\" for \"stability\" by mixed government, and the 1942 article in which Fink first examined il Discorsi passages quoted in the works of James Harrington, partially germinated her research for On Revolution. Arendt confirmed that she was \"indebted to Zera Fink's important study The Classical Republicans...for the influence of Machiavelli upon Harrington and the influence of the ancients upon seventeenth-century English thought, see the excellent study by Zera S. Fink.\"\nAgamben introduced himself to Hannah Arendt as a \"young writer and essayist for whom discovering your books [Between Past and Future] last year has represented a decisive new experience.\" In the twenty-eighth issue of Bidoun, the Italian philosopher recalled that he had told Henry Kissinger that \"you understand absolutely nothing in politics\" at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. But that was only after he disclosed to Arendt that he had \"the pleasure of attending the seminars of Heidegger convened at Provence in the Summers of 1966 and 1968.\" Heideggerian Jean Beaufret and French poet René Char, the latter a renowned proponent of the French Resistance, attended those particular Le Thor seminars, presumably conducted in French and ancient Greek, on Hegelian dialectic as well as arche and ontological unity of opposites in fragments of Heraclitus. Arendt's editors—or Arendt herself—only included Agamben's \"On the Limits of Violence\" in a footnote for the 1969-70 German edition of Arendt's \"Reflections on Violence\" (1969), first published in full in the New York Review of Books, and as a long essay in the Crises of the Republic (1973). Agamben published his essay for an Italian-language literary periodical later in 1970 and for the English-language Diacritics in 2009. Almost fifteen years earlier, Agamben had critically reassessed, and reformulated, Arendt's \"We Refugees\" (1943).\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n** Lying in Politics [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/599112efcd39c3b3ad2118b0/t/59bdb6bbf7e0abb9af99c283/1505605322777/Hannah+Arendt%2C+%E2%80%9CLying+in+Politics%2C%E2%80%9D+Crises+of+the+Republic%2C+3%E2%80%9313.pdf full text]\n**\nBibliographic notes"
