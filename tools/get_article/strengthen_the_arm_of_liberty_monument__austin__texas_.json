The bronze replica was cast by the Friedley-Voshardt Company and erected by the Boy Scouts of America in 1951.\nBackground\nStrengthen the Arm of Liberty was the theme of the Boy Scouts of America's fortieth anniversary celebration in 1950. Approximately 200 BSA Statue of Liberty replicas were installed across the United States.\nThe replica stands on a Texas limestone base and was originally installed southwest of the Capitol, along with a time capsule. The capsule was buried at the scout camp near Bastrop in 2008, and is scheduled to be re-opened in 2076.\nSee also\n* 1951 in art\n* Strengthen the Arm of Liberty\nReferences"
