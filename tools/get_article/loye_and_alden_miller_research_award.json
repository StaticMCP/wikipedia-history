The namesakes were Loye H. Miller and his son Alden H. Miller, both of whom focused largely on ornithology.\nSince the merger of the Cooper Ornithological Society with the American Ornithologists' Union to form the American Ornithological Society in 2016 the award has been presented by the latter.\nRecipients of the award\nSource: [https://americanornithology.org/awards-grants/senior-professional/loye-and-alden-miller-research-award/  American Ornithological Society]\n;Cooper Ornithological Society\n* 1993 – George Bartholomew\n* 1994 – Storrs Olson\n* 1995 – Barbara De Wolfe\n* 1996 – William Dawson\n* 1997 – Robert Storer\n* 1998 – Russell Balda\n* 1999 – Gordon Orians\n* 2000 – Ernst Mayr\n* 2001 – Frank Pitelka\n* 2002 – Richard Holmes\n* 2003 – Peter and Rosemary Grant\n* 2004 – Alexander Skutch\n* 2005 – John Wiens\n* 2006 – Robert Ricklefs\n* 2007 – Robert Payne\n* 2008 – Peter Marler\n* 2009 – Frances James\n* 2010 – Keith A.
