Based in Beijing, it operates under the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Established to support research and innovation, CGMCC preserves microbial biodiversity and provides strains and related services for use in scientific research, industry, agriculture, healthcare, and environmental protection.\nHistory\nThe China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) began in 1931 with the creation of the Department of Fermentation and Mycology at the Huanghai Chemical Research Institute. Two decades later, in 1951, the Microbial Strain Management Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was formed, laying the groundwork for a national system of microbial strain preservation and distribution.\nWhen the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, was established in 1958, CGMCC became a crucial part of China's growing microbiology infrastructure. Its formal establishment as the National Microbial Strain Management Committee came in 1979, coordinated by the State Science and Technology Commission.\nCGMCC's role expanded significantly starting in 1985 when the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) officially designated it as a depository for biological materials relevant to patent procedures. Then, in July 1995, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recognized CGMCC as an International Depositary Authority (IDA) under the Budapest Treaty, a testament to its international standing.\nFurther strengthening its reputation, CGMCC achieved ISO 9001 Quality Management System certification in 2010, becoming the first microbial resource center in China to do so. Most recently, in 2018, the National Health Commission designated it as a national-level preservation center for human-transmissible pathogenic microorganisms, allowing it to preserve and share these critical strains.\nHoldings\nAs of 2025, CGMCC holds:\n* Over 115,000 preserved microbial strains, across more than 15,500 species\n* More than 35,000 strains for patent-related deposit\n* A metagenomic clone library with over 750,000 clones\nInternational recognition\nCGMCC is a member of the World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) and maintains collaborations with international counterparts such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ). Its status as an International Depositary Authority ensures international compliance for patent submissions involving biological material.\nSee also\n* Culture collection\n* Budapest Treaty\n* Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.wfcc.info/ World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC)]"
