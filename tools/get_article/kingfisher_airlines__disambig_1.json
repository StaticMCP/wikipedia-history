It was established in 2003 and started its commercial operations in 2005. Through its parent company United Breweries Group, it had a 50% stake in low-cost carrier Kingfisher Red.\nUntil December 2011, Kingfisher Airlines had the second largest share in India's domestic air travel market. However, the airline ran into continuous losses since its inception, ran high debts and finally closed its operations on 20 October 2012. Its chairman Vijay Mallya subsequently fled to London to allegedly hide from creditors.\nHistory\nEarly years\n(MAA)]]\nKingfisher Airlines was established in 2003. It was owned by the Bengaluru based United Breweries Group. The airline started commercial operations on 9 May 2005, right after Mallya's son Sidhartha's 18th birthday, reportedly as a birthday gift, with a fleet of four new Airbus A320-200s operating a flight from Mumbai to Delhi. It started its international operations on 3 September 2008 by connecting Bengaluru with London. Kingfisher's head office was located in the Kingfisher House in Vile Parle (East), Mumbai, but later moved to The Qube in Andheri (East), Mumbai. Its registered office was located in UB City, Bengaluru. In November 2005, during the World economic forum, the airlines CEO Vijay Mallya announced the airlines intention to launch an IPO to raise 200 million dollars for the airlines expansion and possible takeovers (including that of Air Sahara which was being eyed at that time). It later transpired that the airlines was already heavily in debt and going each year in heavy losses.\nBankruptcy, suspension of license and cessation of operations\nIn November 2011, it started to report losses. The acquisition of loss-making Bengaluru-based Air Deccan in 2007 made matters worse. It was believed that Vijay Mallya and his team failed to follow due diligence with the airline and that it was this deal that brought down his empire; courtesy of N M Rothschild consultants who brokered the deal. An initial name change to Simplifly Deccan, followed by Kingfisher Red, and promotion as the domestic budget Kingfisher airline failed to stem losses and Kingfisher suffered a loss of over  for three consecutive years.\nIts low cost carrier Kingfisher Red was shut down in 2011 and in 2012 employees were not being paid salaries so they went on strike. In a disclosure statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), he explained: \"The company has incurred substantial losses and its net worth has been eroded. However, having regard to improvement in the economic sentiment, rationalization measures adopted by the company, fleet recovery and the implementation of the debt recast package with the lenders and promoters including conversion of debt into share capital, these interim financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the company is a going concern and that no adjustments are required to the carrying value of assets and liabilities.\" This filing was widely covered by Indian and international print and electronic media and analysts. Kingfisher Airlines Lenders later stated they considered the company viable. On 15 November 2011 the airline released poor financial results, indicating that it was \"drowning in high-interest debt and losing money\". Mallya indicated that his solution was for the government to reduce fuel and other taxes. The government was engaged in assessing whether to bail out the company and other airlines or let market forces determine which survived.\nIn December 2011, for the second time in two months, Kingfisher's bank accounts were frozen by the Mumbai Income Tax department for non-payment of dues. The firm owed  to the tax department at the time.\nBy early 2012, the airline accumulated losses of over  with half of its fleet grounded and several members of its staff going on strike. Kingfisher's position in top Indian airlines on the basis of market share had slipped from second to last due to the crisis. Mallya was looking for buyers for the Vile Parle Kingfisher House. With the freezing of the bank accounts of the airline by the Indian Income Tax Department, the airline was in financial disarray.\nOn 20 October 2012, Kingfisher Airlines suspended its operations after its licence was suspended by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation after it failed to address the Indian regulator's concerns about its operations. On 25 February 2013, its international flying rights and domestic slots were scrapped by the Indian aviation authorities.\nIn July 2014, Kingfisher Airlines' indebtedness appeared as the country's state-owned banks' top non-performing asset after failing to repay loans of over .\nOn 2 March 2016 after nearly four years of the bankruptcy of Kingfisher Airlines, the consortium of 13 Indian Banks led by State Bank of India moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal to recover its dues which included Rs 9,000 crores owed by its promoter Vijay Mallya. By that time  Mallya had left India for the UK despite court proceedings by Indian banks initiated against him. Two years later the British Courts ordered extradition of Mallya after a prolonged legal battle and Mallya could be brought back to India if his appeal against the court order is not turned down.\nDestinations\nThe airline's first long-haul destination was London, England, which was launched in September 2008. It had plans to launch long-haul flights to cities in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania with deliveries of new aircraft. All long-haul routes were operated on the Airbus A330-200.\nOn the day of suspension of all international operations, 10 April 2012, Kingfisher Airlines served 25 domestic destinations within India.\nAt that time, all routes were operated with the Airbus A320 family, ATR 42s, and ATR 72 aircraft.\nKingfisher employees\nKingfisher Employees had their dues prior to the carrier suspending its operations.[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/kingfisher-airlines-owes-3000-employees-rs-300-crore-in-salary/articleshow/51336437.cms Kingfisher Airlines owes 3,000 employees Rs 300 crore in salary - The Economic Times] Employee dues outstanding are worth approximately  Crore.\nCodeshare agreements\nPrior to the suspension from IATA, Kingfisher had codeshare agreements with:\n*American Airlines (Oneworld)\n*Asiana Airlines (Star Alliance)\n*Finnair (Oneworld)\n*Philippine Airlines\nFleet\n]]\n.

The ATRs and a few aircraft from the A320 family were used for Kingfisher Red services.\nBy October 2012, Kingfisher Airlines had the following, already heavily downsized fleet:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\"\n|+ Kingfisher Airlines Fleet\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Aircraft\n!rowspan=2|Total\n!colspan=3|Passengers\n!rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!P\n!Y\n!Total\n|-\n|Airbus A319-100\n|3\n|&ndash;\n|144\n|144\n|\n|-\n|Airbus ACJ319\n|1\n|colspan=3|VIP\n|Operated for UB Group\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Airbus A320-200\n|rowspan=3|10\n|20\n|114\n|134\n|rowspan=3|\n|-\n|&ndash;\n|174\n|174\n|-\n|&ndash;\n|180\n|180\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Airbus A321-200\n|rowspan=2|6\n|32\n|119\n|151\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n|&ndash;\n|199\n|199\n|-\n|ATR 42-500\n|2\n|&ndash;\n|48\n|48\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|ATR 72-500\n|rowspan=2|16\n|rowspan=2|&ndash;\n|66\n|66\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n|77\n|77\n|-\n|Boeing 727-100\n|1\n|colspan=3|VIP\n|Operated for UB Group\n|-\n!Total\n!39\n!colspan=\"4\"|\n|}\nAt the time the airline ceased operations, it had Airbus A320, Airbus A350 and Airbus A380 aircraft on order.[http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/kingfisher-becomes-first-indian-customer-for-a380-a350-a330/ Kingfisher becomes first Indian customer for A380, A350, & A330 - Commercial Aircraft - Airbus]\nServices\nCabin\nDomestic\n;Kingfisher First\nThe domestic Kingfisher First, offered on some Airbus A320 family aircraft only, provided seats with a  and 126-degree recline.
