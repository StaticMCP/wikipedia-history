The Kings received the seventh overall pick in the 1993 NBA draft, and selected point guard Bobby Hurley out of Duke University. The Kings started the regular season by winning three of their first four games, but then continued to struggle, losing 16 of their next 18 games leading to an awful 5–17 start, including eight straight losses.\nOn December 12, 1993, Hurley was seriously injured in a life-threatening car accident, following a 112–102 home loss to the Los Angeles Clippers at the ARCO Arena II. Hurley, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was thrown from his vehicle into a ditch after a collision with another vehicle; he suffered two collapsed lungs, multiple rib fractures, and also suffered trauma to the head, back and neck. Hurley was out for the remainder of the season after only playing just 19 games, averaging 7.1 points and 6.1 assists per game.\nWith Hurley out, Spud Webb would return to the starting lineup after playing off the bench as backup point guard for Hurley. Also in December, the team signed free agents Trevor Wilson and LaBradford Smith, who were previously released by the Los Angeles Lakers and the Washington Bullets, respectively. The Kings continued to struggle, holding a 15–32 record at the All-Star break. At mid-season, the team traded Pete Chilcutt to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Olden Polynice. The Kings finished in sixth place in the Pacific Division with a 28–54 record, and missed the NBA playoffs for the eighth consecutive year.\nMitch Richmond averaged 23.4 points and 1.3 steals per game, led the Kings with 127 three-point field goals, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. In addition, Wayman Tisdale averaged 16.7 points and 7.1 rebounds per game, while Lionel Simmons provided the team with 15.1 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.4 steals per game, Webb contributed 12.7 points and 6.7 assists per game, and Polynice averaged 9.8 points and 11.4 rebounds per game in 31 games with the Kings after the trade, and finished tied in seventh place in Most Improved Player voting.\nOff the bench, second-year forward Walt Williams provided with 11.2 points per game, but only played 57 games due to a stress fracture in his left leg, while Wilson averaged 8.0 points per game in 52 games, Randy Brown contributed 4.5 points per game, and Duane Causwell averaged 4.4 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game, but only played just 41 games due to injury.\nDuring the NBA All-Star weekend at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Richmond was selected for the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, as a member of the Western Conference All-Star team, and also participated in the NBA Three-Point Shootout for the second time.\nFollowing the season, Tisdale signed as a free agent with the Phoenix Suns, and Wilson and Smith were both released to free agency.\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n!
