Officially styled Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the vice president is directly elected together with the president to a four-year term of office.\nKashim Shettima is the 15th and current vice president of Nigeria, he assumed office on 29 May 2023.\nEligibility\nCandidates eligible for the office of vice president must be a citizen of Nigeria by birth, at least 40 years of age, a member of a political party and is sponsored by that political party.\nOath of office\nThe Constitution of Nigeria specifies an oath of office for the vice president of the federation. The oath is administered by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria or the person for the time being appointed to exercise the functions of that office. It is the same oath recited by deputy state governors, ministers, commissioners and special advisers to the president.\nFunctions of the vice president of Nigeria\nThe executive functions of the Nigerian vice president includes participation in all cabinet meetings by statute and membership in the National Security Council, Federal Executive Council, and a constitutional role of being the chairman of the National Economic Council. Although the vice president may take an active role in establishing policy in the executive branch by serving on such committees and councils, the relative power of the Nigerian vice president depends upon the duties delegated by the president. The vice president as the second highest official in the Nigerian government also has a role of representing the president in diplomatic occasions, military occasions, council meetings, federal committees and events or any occasions as necessary. However, contrary to some opinions that the vice president has a statutory function of representing the president in any of these occasions, according to the Nigerian constitution, it is still the prerogative of the president to choose whoever is serving in the federal cabinet or the executive branch of government to represent him in any of those occasions. The vice president cannot make executive orders or decisions without the assent of the president because the president holds full executive and presidential powers. The vice president by a matter of law is not an assistant to the president, the office is fully and independently presidential, it's executive powers are hibernated until the president is unable to function by any means, in which case he or she becomes the acting president. In the instance of resignation, impeachment or death of the president, the vice president being the first in line of succession becomes the president of Nigeria.\nList of vice presidents\nMilitary government (1966–1979)\nMajor Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu orchestrated the bloody military coup d'état of 1966 which overthrew the First Republic, parliamentary system of government was abolished and the office of the Vice President was established with Babafemi Ogundipe becoming the first Vice President as Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Chief of Staff\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2| Military\n! rowspan=2| Head of State\n|-\n!\n!
