Its highest peak is the Hirschberg (493 m). About 60% of the ridge lies on the territory of the parish of Bindlach, the other 40% is divided between the town of Bayreuth and the parish of Heinersreuth. A number of lakes and streams have their origin in these hills and are an important source of drinking water for the surrounding settlements.\nParishes\nTo the north and east lies the hills are in the parish of Bindlach, in the south in the borough of Bayreuth, in the west on the parish of Heinersreuth.\nThe following villages lie on the hill range:\nPeaks\n* Hirschberg (493 m above NN)\n* Hohe Wart, Victory tower (Siegesturm)  (463 m ANN) - erected after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/71\n* Kühnleite (457 m ANN)\n* Schupfenschlager Höhe  (452 m ANN)\nRivers and lakes\nRivers/streams:\n* Hirschbach rises on the Hirschberg and flows into the Trebgast (White Main)\n* Eisbach begins at the Eisbachsee and flows into the Trebgast\n* Cottenbach begins at the Hirschbergsee and flows into the Red Main\n* Altbach rises at the foot of the Schupfenschlager Höhe and flows into the Trebgast\nLakes:\n* Eisbachsee\n* Hirschbergsee\n* Schupfenschlager Weiher\nCrags\nTourism\nThe main tourist attraction in the region is the Victory Tower (Siegesturm) in Bayreuth, on the Hohe Warte. The eastern part is less popular. Almost the entire areas is a protected landscape. The ridge is also called the \"Gateway to the Bavarian Northern Forests\" (Tor zum Bayrischen Nortwald, the old name for the Franconian Forest and Fichtel Mountains, because it was the first range of hills in the Fichtel Mountains from the valley of the Red Main. The Bavarian Nortwald hiking trail also begins at Hirschberg.\nEconomy\nThe region is important for forestry, being used and maintained by the Bavarian State Forests.\nThe source region around the Hohe Wart is almost exclusively used to supply water to the town of Bayreuth and there is also an elevated drinking water reservoir.\nEast of the Hohe Warte lies the hospital named after it, the Klinik Hohe Warte\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://panoramaleben.de/index.php?datei=siegesturm&region=Bayreuth&version=ImmervisionPlayer&player=auto  View from the Hohe Warte]\n* [http://fichtelgebirge.de/ The Fichtel Mountains]"
