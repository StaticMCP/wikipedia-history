The Kings have now equalled  the Golden State Warriors between 1994–95 and 2005–06 as the third-longest NBA postseason drought on record, behind only the Timberwolves above and the fifteen-season drought by the Buffalo Braves, San Diego Clippers and Los Angeles Clippers between 1976–77 and 1990–91 inclusive. The Kings now need three more losing seasons to break the NBA record for most consecutive losing seasons, which the Kings set between 1983–84 and 1997–98 and had been previously suffered by the Pistons between 1956–57 and 1969–70 inclusive.\nDraft picks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#5b2b82; color:white\" width=\"10%\"| Round\n! style=\"background:#5b2b82; color:white\"  width=\"10%\"| Pick\n! style=\"background:#5b2b82; color:white\"  width=\"20%\"| Player\n! style=\"background:#5b2b82; color:white\" width=\"15%\"| Position\n! style=\"background:#5b2b82; color:white\" width=\"15%\"| Nationality\n! style=\"background:#5b2b82; color:white\" width=\"20%\"| College / Club\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1\n| 5\n| De'Aaron Fox\n| PG\n|\n| Kentucky\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1\n| 15\n| Justin Jackson\n| SF/SG\n|\n| North Carolina\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 1\n| 20\n| Harry Giles\n| PF/C\n|\n| Duke\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| 2\n| 34\n| Frank Mason III\n| PG\n|\n| Kansas\n|}\nEach of the Sacramento Kings' picks they acquired this year would be had via trades. The fifth pick of the draft, which was originally placed to be a likely 8th pick, had them move up into the Top 3 before the Philadelphia 76ers activated their pick swapping rights with them moving down from a likely fourth spot to the fifth pick due to the trade where they gave up Nik Stauskas, Carl Landry, Jason Thompson, their unprotected 2019 first round pick, and the rights for Philadelphia to swap first round picks in 2017 in exchange for the rights of Artūras Gudaitis and Luka Mitrović. Meanwhile, both their second Top 10 first round pick (at pick 10) and their sole second round pick came from the New Orleans Pelicans, where they gave up their star center DeMarcus Cousins and Omri Casspi in order to acquire both the Pelicans' first round pick and the second round pick that the Philadelphia 76ers held this year, as well as gain the return of Tyreke Evans, last year's All-Rookie team member Buddy Hield, and Langston Galloway. As for their own second round selection (which was worst then the second round pick they got from the 76ers via the Pelicans), they originally traded it away to the Cleveland Cavaliers back when it originally considered a first round pick alongside the aforementioned Omri Casspi for JJ Hickson before Cleveland traded it out to the Chicago Bulls alongside Andrew Bynum, the rights to swap first round picks with the Cavaliers, and multiple second round picks from the Portland Trail Blazers for Luol Deng.\nWith Sacramento's first pick (acquired from Philadelphia), they selected De'Aaron Fox, a freshman point guard from the University of Kentucky. Under his only season with Kentucky, De'Aaron averaged 16.7 points, 4.6 assists, 3.9 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game in 36 games played (34 started) while also earning the Southeastern Conference's Tournament MVP, the All-SEC Freshman Team honors, and All-SEC First Team honors there. As for their first round pick that was acquired from Philadelphia, they traded that selection (who became freshman center Zach Collins from Gonzaga University) to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for their first two first round picks this year. With Portland's first pick, they selected Justin Jackson, a junior small forward/shooting guard from the recent champion North Carolina University. During his time there, he would help the Tar Heels out in their quest for a redemption championship by averaging 18.3 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game out in North Carolina. He would also earn the ACC's Player of The Year Award that year, as well as be named a consensus All-American First Team member and All-ACC First Team member, as well as previously be named a member of the All-ACC Freshman Team of 2015. As for their second and final selection that was previously held under Portland's name, the Kings would select another former #1 draft prospect late in the first round, this time being freshman power forward Harry Giles from Duke University. Similar to Skal Labissière before him, Giles was also a former #1 draft prospect. However, a torn ACL his senior year of high school and other knee issues resulted in what would be considered a disappointing freshman year at Duke, averaging 3.9 points and rebounds per game (as well as 0.7 blocks and 0.4 assists and steals) in 26 games (6 of which he started in) there before declaring early. Finally, with their sole second round pick (acquired from Philadelphia via New Orleans), Sacramento would select Frank Mason III, a senior point guard from the University of Kansas. As the consensus college basketball player of the year, Frank would average 20.9 points, 5.2 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.3 steals per game in 36 games played that year for Kansas as he (alongside Josh Jackson) would help the Jayhawks compete for the NCAA Tournament that year before unfortunately losing out to Oregon University at the Elite Eight.\nRoster\nStandings\nDivision\nConference\nGame log\nPreseason\n|- style=\"background:#bfb;\"\n| 1\n| October 2\n| San Antonio\n|\n| Frank Mason III (17)\n| Frank Mason III (6)\n| George Hill (5)\n| Golden 1 Center16,000\n| 1–0\n|- style=\"background:#fcc;\"\n| 2\n| October 6\n| @ San Antonio\n|\n| Willie Cauley-Stein (14)\n| Willie Cauley-Stein (9)\n| De'Aaron Fox (6)\n| AT&T Center18,082\n| 1–1\n|- style=\"background:#fcc;\"\n| 3\n| October 8\n| @ LA Lakers\n|\n| Zach Randolph (16)\n| George Hill (8)\n| Bogdanovic, Hill, Randolph (3)\n| T-Mobile Arena13,094\n| 1–2\n|- style=\"background:#fcc;\"\n| 4\n| October 9\n| Portland\n|\n| Justin Jackson (16)\n| Willie Cauley-Stein (8)\n| Marcus Williams (5)\n| Golden 1 CenterN/A\n| 1–3\n|- style=\"background:#fcc;\"\n| 5\n| October 12\n| @ L.A.
