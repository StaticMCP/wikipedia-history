These instruments are typically used during royal events, weddings, and festivals. For weddings and royal events, the musicians playing the instruments would wear traditional Cambodian attire. Just like the Chinese, with regard to playing context, there is no conductor in traditional Cambodian music because musicians generally learned and memorized how to play the instruments aurally. These instruments provide a sense of identity for the Cambodian people.\nSee also\n*Music of Cambodia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.istov.de/htmls/cambodia/cambodia_start.html The traditional music and instruments of Cambodia]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWX3S8Sjwjo Rebuilding the musical instruments of the ancient Khmer]. 26 February 2016. tuk-tuk.tv\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68PfplM3MNo Mysteries of the Khmer harp]. 9 April 2016. tuk-tuk.tv"
