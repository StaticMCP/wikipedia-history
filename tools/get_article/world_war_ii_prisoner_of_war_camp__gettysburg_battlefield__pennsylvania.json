On January 22, 1945, the U.S. Employment Service began using Gettysburg POWs for pulpwood cutting, and in June the camp opened with 500 German POWs (932 by July),  POW employment ended February 23, 1946; and by April 13, 1946, only guards remained at the POW Camp (guards had numbered as high as 50.)[https://books.google.com/books?id=majmwEcrFPMC&pg=PA117] The last commander was Captain James W Copley, and before the camp was opened, Captain Lawrence Thomas had been the commander of both Gettysburg facilities and the Camp Michaux interrogation facility near Pine Grove Furnace State Park.\nReferences"
