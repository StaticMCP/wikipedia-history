In 1921, following the establishment of National Southeast University, the society was renamed the Nanko-Tungta Historical and Geographical Society. After Nanjing Higher Normal School was merged into National Southeast University in 1923, it became known as the Southeast University Historical and Geographical Society, but it is commonly referred to by its original name, the Nanko Historical and Geographical Society.\n(Shidi Xuebao) was a renowned academic publication founded by the society.In academic circles, the group is sometimes regarded as a school of thought and referred to as the Nanko Historical and Geographical School. However, some scholars argue that the Nanko Society was primarily an academic organization rather than a faction advocating a specific ideological stance. The Nanko Historical and Geographical School was a key representative of the broader Nanko School. Publications by Nanko scholars—including , , and The Critical Review —as well as other magazines such as , , , and Xiangjun, served as major critics of the New Culture Movement led by New Youth, a journal associated with Peking University. Members of the Nanko Historical and Geographical Society maintained close ties with the Xueheng School and the . Scholars from the Nanko Society were key contributors to  The Critical Review (Chinese journal) School, with figures such as Liu Yizheng and  serving as important writers for Xueheng magazine.\nOrigins\nGeological Society\nThe predecessor of the Historical and Geographical Society was the Geoscience Society of Nanjing Higher Normal School, established on October 1, 1919. At that time, Nanjing Higher Normal School did not yet have a Department of History and Geography, which led students to propose the formation of a Geoscience Society. Their initiative was supported and assisted by two professors, Liu Yizheng and , with  serving as the first executive secretary. After a re-election on January 19, 1920,  became the new chair of the society.On May 13 of the same year, during a society meeting, the founding members noted that “geoscience and history are closely related and should not be emphasized at the expense of the other.” After a discussion at the general assembly, it was decided to rename the Geoscience Society as the Historical and Geographical Society, and a revised constitution was adopted.The purpose of the Historical and Geographical Society was defined as “the study of history and geoscience.” Membership was open to “students from the departments of history, geoscience, or any other departments with an interest in historical and geographical studies,” as well as to “alumni of the school who wished to join the society.”\nThe Journal of History and Geography\nThe Journal of History and Geography (Shidi Xuebao) was first published in 1920. Initially issued as a quarterly, it was later changed to a monthly journal starting with Volume 2, Issue 2, except during summer and winter vacations. In July 1921, the content for the first issue was compiled and sent to the Commercial Press in Shanghai. However, due to the press being overloaded with printing tasks, the issue was not published until November of that year.The journal experienced a brief suspension in 1925 and ultimately ceased publication after October 1926, having released a total of 4 volumes and 21 issues. The Journal of History and Geography served as the official publication of the Nanko Historical and Geographical Society.In addition to this journal, Nanko scholars also edited and published several other academic periodicals at different times, including History and Geoscience, Geographical Journal, Gazetteer Monthly, Historical Studies Journal, Guofeng, and Historical and Geographical Journal. Scholars from the Nanko Historical and Geographical School were also key contributors to The Critical Review.\nEditors-in-Chief / Editorial Directors (in chronological order): Chang Ch'i-yun, , Miao Fenglin, and  Lu Weizhao.\nChinese Society for Historical and Geographical Studies，Chinese Historical Society\nIn 1926, Liu Yizheng, Chu Coching, , Chen Xunci, Chang Ch'i-yun, , , ,  , , Hu Huanyong, , and others initiated the founding of the  in Nanjing. In the same year, they launched the journal History and Geoscience (Shixue yu Dixue).In January 1929, the Chinese Historical Society of Nanjing was established, and in March, it began publishing the Historical Studies Journal (Shixue Zazhi). Scholars from the Nanko School, including Chen Xunci, Zhang Qiyun, and Miao Fenglin, subsequently promoted the founding of the Zhejiang Chinese Historical and Geographical Society in Hangzhou and the Wu-Yue Historical and Geographical Research Society in Shanghai.In 1933, Zhu Kezhen, Zhang Qiyun, and Weng Wenhao initiated the establishment of the Chinese Geographical Society in Nanjing.\nOn March 24, 1943, the inaugural meeting of the Chinese Historical Society was held at the National Central Library. More than 120 individuals attended the event, including Gu Jiegang, Fu Sinian, Fang Hao, Lei Haizong, Miao Fenglin, Chen Xunci, Zhang Qiyun, Zheng Hesheng, Wei Juxian, and Wu Qichang. Gu Jiegang served as the chair of the meeting and delivered the opening address. During the meeting, the Constitution of the Chinese Historical Society was adopted, and directors and supervisors were elected, including 21 directors.On March 26, 1943, the first joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the society was convened. Gu Jiegang, Fu Sinian, Zhu Xizu, Miao Fenglin, and Chen Xunci, among others, were elected as executive directors, totaling nine in all.\nThought\nThe Historical and Geographical School differed from previous approaches to historiography by first distinguishing between the actual events of the past and the narratives written about them—asserting that history is not equivalent to historical texts. As Miao Fenglin observed, “What is organized into a book is history as written, not history in its essence; it is the history of history, not the true image of history. So, what is the true image of history? It is simply evolution and activity.”Similarly, Liu Shanli stated, “History is the record of human or collective human activity—traces of thoughts, words, and actions.”\nThe Historical and Geographical School’s understanding of the function of the history discipline shared certain similarities with traditional historiography, yet also diverged significantly from it. Miao Fenglin believed that the value of studying history lay in \"using the past as a mirror\" to draw lessons and moral insights. Chen Xunci pointed out that history should be regarded as the most universal form of knowledge, closely linked to society, and capable of influencing people’s lives. These views reveal the Historical and Geographical School’s emphasis on the educational function of history.Xu Zeling stated, “History is the study of the individual’s process of adapting to life.” Chen Xunci and Chang Ch'i-yun further elaborated on Xu’s idea, arguing that historical research is closely related to nationalism and national culture.\nNotable members\nSuccessive Executive Secretaries: , , Hu Huanyong, and .\nAdvisors: Liu Yizheng, Chu Coching, Liang Qichao, , , , Chen Hengzhe, , , , , , among others.\nIn addition to having many leading scholars of the time as advisors, the Nanko Historical and Geographical Society also produced numerous students and members who made significant contributions to the development of Chinese historiography and geography. Many went on to become pioneers and founding figures in various academic fields of modern Chinese history and geography, including Chang Ch'i-yun, Hu Huanyong, , Wang Yong, and others.\nReferences\nCitation\nBibliography\nWu Zhongliang.
