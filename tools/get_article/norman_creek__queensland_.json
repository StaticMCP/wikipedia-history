      "text": "# Norman Creek (Queensland)\n\nNorman Creek is a tributary of the Brisbane River in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The headwaters of the creek are located on the northern slopes of Toohey Mountain and Mount Gravatt in southern Brisbane.\nOrigin of the name\nThe name of the name is disputed.\nOne claim is that Edmund Lockyer named the waterway Norman Creek in 1825, after Colour-Sergeant John Norman of the 40th Regiment during this detachment's movement from Redcliffe to Brisbane in 1825.\nAnother claim is that it derives from a corruption of Gorman's Creek which appears in a 1846 atlas, named after Lieutenant Owen Gorman, of H. M. 8th Foot - the last commandant of the Moreton Bay penal settlement.\nGeography\nDrainage in Tarragindi\nThe creek drains the suburbs of Tarragindi and Holland Park West then flows northwards through Greenslopes, Norman Park and East Brisbane before entering the Brisbane River at Humbug Reach.\nThe total catchment area is . Coorparoo Creek in Coorparoo is a sub-catchment of Norman Creek. Other sub-catchments include Sandy Creek and Ekibin Creek. There are four significant bridges that cross the creek.\nAt Stones Corner the tidal part of the creek funnels out into a thin gully. From here south, parts of the creek have been channelised into cement drains.\nInvasion by weeds, the dumping of rubbish and in the past, sewage discharges have posed problems for the environmental health of this highly urbanised waterway. Volunteer conservation groups are attempting to redress the problems.\nBrisbane City Council (BCC) is currently developing a master plan called \"Norman Creek 2026\" for the catchment. Community feedback and genuine actioning is critical for the success of the project to be able to deliver a healthy ecosystem.\nIn March 2011, the BCC announced $14.5 million worth of funding to make the creek more resistant to the threat of flooding and to improve the landscape along its course.\nThe Eastern Busway at Stones Corner is built over the creek. The Anglican Church Grammar School backs onto the creek.\nThe construction of floodgates at the mouth of the creek has been suggested by a local emeritus professor, in order to stop flooding of the Brisbane River pushing into the creeks and stormwater drains which flow into Norman Creek.\nSee also\n*Bulimba Creek\n*Oxley Creek\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://n4c.org.au/ Norman Creek Catchment Coordinating Committee]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120925003150/http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/environment-waste/natural-environment/creeks-and-waterways/saving-our-waterways/norman-creek-2026/index.htm Norman Creek 2026]"
