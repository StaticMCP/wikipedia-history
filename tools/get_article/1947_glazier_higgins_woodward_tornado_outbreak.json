The outbreak generated at least 12, and possibly 17&nbsp;or more, tornadoes, many of which were significant. On Wednesday, April&nbsp;9, a series of related tornadoes spawned by a single supercell, dubbed the Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes, swept through the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Most of the damage and nearly all of the deaths are still blamed on one large tornado, known as the Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornado, that traveled  from Texas to Oklahoma, beginning over the South Plains. This event, up to nearly  in width, was often compared to the Tri-State tornado, because it was originally thought to have left a  path, was similarly large and intense for much of its path, and was also retroactively rated F5 on the modern-day Fujita scale, but it is now believed to have been part of a  family of nine&nbsp;or 10&nbsp;tornadoes.}}\nBackground\nEarly on April&nbsp;9, the United States Weather Bureau in Amarillo, Texas, forecast late-afternoon temperatures of about  over the Texas panhandle. At the time, dense, low-lying stratus and a layer of fog were present, with temperatures ranging from the upper 40s to low 50s °F. However, an approaching warm front—then extended from Sherman, Texas, to Raton, New Mexico—would later combine with a robust trough aloft to enhance conditions for severe weather. In tandem with this, a low-pressure area over northeastern New Mexico, along with an attendant dry line, would gradually eject, leading to stronger low-level wind shear and more pronounced lapse rates. Around 2:00&nbsp;p.m. CST (18:00&nbsp;UTC), helicity was near 135&nbsp;m2/s2, but would decline afterward. As it did so, however, an unexpected decrease in cloud cover allowed for greater-than-expected diurnal heating, leading to a substantial rise in atmospheric instability and associated buoyancy. By 6:30&nbsp;p.m. CST (00:30&nbsp;UTC), the low-pressure center was situated over southern Colorado, and a  jet stream existed  above sea level. Surface-based temperatures quickly reached the upper 60s °F. In the mixed layer, the convective available potential energy (CAPE) rose above 1,100&nbsp;j/kg, and the lifted condensation level (LCL) was just  above ground level, along with a level of free convection (LFC) of . Mixed-layer convective inhibition by then had decreased, offsetting the loss of helicity, and the presence of the warm front acted in concert with the aforementioned factors to favor supercells capable of generating strong tornadoes. Gusts of  attended the passage of a cold front overnight.\nConfirmed tornadoes\n*A possible tornado may have flattened a barn just south of Carpenter, Oklahoma, on April&nbsp;9.\nPrior to 1990, there is a likely undercount of tornadoes, particularly E/F0–1, with reports of weaker tornadoes becoming more common as population increased. A sharp increase in the annual average E/F0–1 count by approximately 200 tornadoes was noted upon the implementation of NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in 1990–1991. Most countries only recorded tornadoes that produced severe damage or loss of life. Significant low biases in U.S. tornado counts likely occurred through the early 1990s, when advanced NEXRAD was first installed and the National Weather Service began comprehensively verifying tornado occurrences.}} 1974 marked the first year where significant tornado (E/F2+) counts became homogenous with contemporary values, attributed to the consistent implementation of Fujita scale assessments. Numerous discrepancies on the details of tornadoes in this outbreak exist between sources. The total count of tornadoes and ratings differs from various agencies accordingly. The list below documents information from the most contemporary official sources alongside assessments from tornado historian Thomas P. Grazulis.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ List of confirmed tornadoes in the tornado outbreak of April 9–11, 1947\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:2%; text-align:center;\"|F# Tornado ratings were retroactively applied to events prior to the formal adoption of the F-scale by the National Weather Service.

When it struck the tiny town of Glazier, it may have been as much as  wide. Most structures in town were swept completely away and scattered. Vehicles in the area were thrown hundreds of yards and mangled, shrubbery was debarked, and ground scouring occurred. Glazier was considered completely destroyed, with 17 dead, a major percentage of the populace. Press reports told of two people who were known to be together in Glazier before the tornado struck were found  apart afterward. The tornado maintained its intensity as it slammed into Higgins, on the Texas–Oklahoma border, which was also devastated. The accepted death toll here was 51; again, a major fraction of the residents of the town were killed or injured. Much of downtown Higgins was completely demolished, and entire rows of homes were swept away. At one residence, a  lathe was reportedly ripped from its anchors and broken in half.\nAfter killing at least one&nbsp;other person, the tornado crossed the state line and entered Oklahoma. There the tornado was at its worst—the deadliest storm in that state's tornado-troubled history. Six&nbsp;more people were killed when the tornado swept away about 60&nbsp;ranches and farms south of Shattuck, Gage, and Fargo. During its trek, the funnel was so wide and low to the ground that it did not resemble a prototypical tornado. The tornado then moved into Woodward, where it devastated the town and killed an estimated 107&nbsp;people. The damage that occurred in Woodward was catastrophic. There, the tornado was  wide and destroyed 100&nbsp;city blocks. Many homes and businesses were leveled or swept away, and as the tornado struck the town's power plant, a  steel boiler tank was lofted and thrown a block and a half. Large trees sustained severe debarking as well. The tornado finally dissipated in Woods County, west of Alva, where it wrecked 36&nbsp;homes and injured 30&nbsp;people.\nCleanup in the region was made more difficult because of cold and snow that followed the tornado. Four-year-old Joan Gay Croft and her sister Jerri were among refugees taking shelter in a basement hallway of the Woodward hospital. As officials sent the injured to different hospitals in the area, two men took Joan away, saying they were taking her to Oklahoma City. She was never seen again. Over the years, several women have come forth saying they suspect they might be Joan, although none of the claims have been verified. She is likely deceased. The Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornado was the sixth deadliest in U.S. history, killing 184&nbsp;and injuring 980; of these figures, 116&nbsp;deaths and 782&nbsp;injuries occurred in Oklahoma. An undetermined number of additional fatalities may have occurred in both states affected. In all, the tornado destroyed 626&nbsp;homes and damaged 920&nbsp;others, becoming the costliest on record in Oklahoma history.\nAftermath and recovery\nA US Weather Bureau report on the Woodward, Oklahoma Tornado of April&nbsp;9, 1947, gives the following figures on the damage caused in its \"Original Summary\" section.\n*Lipscomb County, Texas – 36 homes flattened, 1 damaged\n*Hemphill County, Texas – 83 homes leveled, 116 damaged\n*Texas total – $1,505,000\n*Ellis County, Oklahoma – $1,264,000\n**52 homes destroyed, 133 damaged\n**223 other buildings destroyed, 107 damaged\n*Woodward County, Oklahoma – $6,608,750\n**430 homes destroyed, 650 damaged\n**925 other buildings destroyed, 975 damaged\n*Woods County, Oklahoma – $950,000\n**25 homes destroyed, 34 damaged\n**110 other buildings destroyed, 90 damaged\n*Kansas total – $200,000\nTotal damage estimates were $173,489,564 (equivalent to $747,850,050 in 2008 dollars).\nSee also\n*Tornadoes of 1947\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*}}\n*\n*\n*\n*}}\n*\n**\n**\n**\n**\n*\nExternal links and sources\n* (http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/075/mwr-075-04-0070.pdf)"
