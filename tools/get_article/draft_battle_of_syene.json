The battle was recorded by Greek geographer Strabo who was alive when the battle happened. The battle was a major Roman victory and sent the Nubian forces scattering.\nStrabo records the Romans had “less than ten thousand infantry and eight hundred cavalry\" against thirty thousand Kushite men in Syene. The Kushites fought with “large, oblong shields made of raw ox-hide” and simple weaponry such as axes, pikes, and swords. Because of this, they were overwhelmed by Petronius' attack. Strabo describes the Kushite forces as \"badly marshaled.\"\nhttps://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/17A3*.html\nReferences"
