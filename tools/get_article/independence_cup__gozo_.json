The first Independence Cup took place in the season 1964–1965 — that is the same year that Malta gained its independence and the last edition was held during the 2012–2013 season. Generally the final was held on the Independence Day – that is 21 September.\nFormat\nSix teams of the First Division were chosen by lot to participate in the preliminary round.
