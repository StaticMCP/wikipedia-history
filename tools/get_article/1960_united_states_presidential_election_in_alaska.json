This was the first presidential election that Alaska participated in. Voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nAlaska was narrowly won by incumbent Vice-president Richard Nixon (R-California) with 50.9% of the popular vote against U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) with 49.1%; a 1.8% margin. Prior to the election, The New York Times declared Kennedy the favorite in the state.\nInterior Department Chief Legal Officer (Solicitor) Ted Stevens managed Nixon's campaign in the state, being key to Nixon's narrow victory in what was then a solidly Democratic state which hadn't elected a Republican to state-wide office since James Wickersham was elected at-large Territorial Delegate in 1930. Stevens would become a U.S. Senator 8 years later.\nThis is the only time a Democrat was elected without carrying Bethel.\nKennedy's 49.06% vote share remains the second best of any Democrat in a presidential election in the state, after Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory in the following election.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1960 United States presidential election in Alaska\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#FF3333; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican\n| Richard Nixon\n| align=\"right\" | 30,953\n| align=\"right\" | 50.94%\n| align=\"right\" | 3\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| John F.
