During the supply of meat, \"carnage\", for the troops that were there, coming from the resumption of Corumbá, a small squad of Paraguayan vapors had gone up the river in pursuit of the Brazilians, after the first ones had been defeated. The Paraguayan attack was of initial surprise, but they were defeated by the men of Lieutenant Colonel Antônio João da Costa. The loss and reconquest of the Brazilian steam Jauru stood out.\nThe naval battle\nThe troops were returning to the capital when, on July 11, Jaurú and Antônio João, who were towing a total of 6 boats, docked at the port of Alegre. Provision of supplies, mainly meat for soldiers, begins. The works are carried out without any concern, when in the afternoon, 3 Paraguayan vapors appear that were in pursuit of the troop that caused them defeat in Corumbá. At this moment the Paraguayan Salto de Guaíra steam of Commander Romualdo Nuñez rises at a fast speed and begins to approach the Brazilian steam Jaurú.\nImmediately, a live firearm of artillery placed in the ravines and an engagement with the National Guard snipers of Lieutenant Colonel Antônio João da Costa begins, achieving initial victory in the approach of Jaurú. Soon the steamboat Antônio João comes under the command of Balduíno de Aguiar, a veteran in the battle of the Fort of Coimbra. Brazilian steam forces the withdrawal of Salto de Guaíra and then approaches Jauru, which at that time was controlled by thirty Paraguayans, and takes the ship back to Brazilians again. The fight ended with the victory of the Brazilians to a balance of 33 dead and injured and a sunk ship.\nThe Paraguayans did not lose any ship, but suffered many human loses.\nReferences"
