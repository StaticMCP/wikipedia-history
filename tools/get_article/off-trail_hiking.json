It is also known as bushwhacking.\nThere is some concern that off-trail hiking cause trailbraiding (creating multiple paths which can damage vegetation), erosion, new trail creation, and other negative environmental impacts.  The off-trail community claims that the activity is limited to open, unrestricted public areas where it is permitted.\nSee also\n* Orienteering\n* Scrambling\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
