Much of his earlier research focused on imprinting and maternal behavior in rats, but later in his career, he shifted to using positron emission tomography to research sexual behavior in humans. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and served as president of the International Society for Developmental Psychobiology. Shortly after his death in 2004, the Illinois General Assembly passed a resolution in his honor.\nReferences"
