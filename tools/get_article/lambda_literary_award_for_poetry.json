Beginning with the 3rd Lambda Literary Awards in 1991, the poetry award was split into two separate awards for Gay Poetry and Lesbian Poetry, which have been presented continuously since then except at the 20th Lambda Literary Awards in 2008, when a merged LGBTQ poetry award was again presented for that year only. In 2016, an award for Transgender Poetry was introduced and has been presented every year since; likewise an award for Bisexual Poetry has been presented since 2019.\nIn 2024, an award for LGBTQ+ Poetry was again shortlisted, in addition to the 4 newer categories.\nHonorees\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n|+ Lambda Literary Award for LGBTQ+ Poetry winners and finalists\n!
