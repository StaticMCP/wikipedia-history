Founded on September 18, 2025 by General Secretary Peter Sprigg, the PRC describes itself as a small-scale communist state and a work of political satire. Despite its humorous origins, the PRC maintains a defined structure of governance, economy, and national identity.\nHistory\nThe People's Republic of Caledon was proclaimed in 2025, following what its founder described as \"the revolutionary rediscovery of a surplus of bell peppers.\" The declaration of independence was informal and unrecognized, but marked the symbolic beginning of Caledon’s “People’s Era.”\nThe PRC continues to function as a parody of Cold War–style socialist states, with formal-sounding ministries, public holidays, and an emphasis on civic pride in agricultural yield (specifically peppers).\nGovernment and politics\nThe PRC operates as a one-party socialist republic, headed by General Secretary Peter Sprigg. Though described as having “free elections,” political power remains concentrated in the office of the General Secretary, whose leadership is considered both inevitable and unopposed.\nGeography\nThe PRC occupies a suburban section of Caledon East. It has no fixed borders and exists entirely within Canadian territory. Administrative meetings are typically held wherever there is shade and Wi-Fi.\nEconomy\nThe PRC’s economy is decorative in nature. Its primary export and national symbol is the **bell pepper**, which also serves as a token of entry for visitors. Citizens and guests traditionally receive a free pepper upon entering the republic.\nDemographics\nOfficial census reports list three active citizens. Approximately one hundred additional individuals reside within PRC territory without awareness of its existence.\nCulture\nThe PRC embraces political satire and civic humor as central cultural values. State events often include mock parades, readings of revolutionary quotations, and pepper-themed festivities.\nInternational recognition\nThe People's Republic of Caledon is recognized by no other nations. It maintains an ongoing “rivalry” with the defunct state of East Germany, largely for symbolic and comedic purposes.\nSymbols\n* Flag: Designed by the founder, featuring symbols of unity and agriculture.\n* Anthem: The Internationale\n* Motto: \"A Bell Pepper for Every Comrade\" (unofficial)\n* Currency: Canadian dollar (CAD)\nSee also\n* Micronation\n* List of micronations\n* Political satire\n* Caledon, Ontario\nExternal links\n* Sandbox page for editing practice\n* (Proposed) Official website of the People’s Republic of Caledon"
