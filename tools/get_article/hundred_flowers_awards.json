They are classified as the Chinese equivalent of the United States' Golden Globes.\nThe awards were inaugurated by China Film Association in 1962 and sponsored by Popular Cinema () magazine, which has the largest circulation in mainland China.\nThe awards were formerly voted by the readers of Popular Cinema annually. Recent polls allow voters to cast ballots through SMS, the Internet, or by phone call. Voting is now no longer confined to readers of Popular Cinema. Award recipients receive a statuette in the shape of a goddess of Flowers ().\nHistory\nThe 2nd Hundred Flowers Awards poll was held in 1963, but the poll was not conducted again until 1980 due to the Cultural Revolution. It became an annual event from 1980 until 2004. Since 2004, the Hundred Flowers Awards ceremonies have been held biennially on alternate years with the Golden Rooster.\nIn 1992, the Golden Rooster and the Hundred Flowers Awards were combined into a single national festival.\nFrom 1980 to 2004, the annual Hundred Flowers poll selected three films with the most tallied votes as the Best Pictures of the year. Since 2006, films from the previous two years are considered eligible for awards, including Chinese-language films from Taiwan and Hong Kong. The film with the highest number of votes is chosen as Best Picture, with two runners-up.\nNew Ballot Rules\nChina Film Association updated the ballot rules in 2006.\nThe first ballot will result in a list of 8-10 pre-candidate films, whose domestic box-office earnings were greater than five million yuan, by the 100 cinema managers of China City Film Developing Association and members of China Film Association.\nThe second ballot will have the public selecting the five film nominations in each category by internet, mobile network, magazine votes, and SMS. Each nominee will receive a \"Hundred Flowers Awards Nomination Certificate\".\nFor the final ballot, a China official notary will randomly select 101 audience members who voted in the second round and hold dedicated screenings for all nominated pictures. The 101 audience members will then have a secret ballot and subsequently announce the winners.\nOther Categories\n*Best Picture ()\n*Best Director ()\n*Best Writing ()\n*Best Actor ()\n*Best Actress ()\n*Best Supporting Actor ()\n*Best Supporting Actress ()\n*Best Newcomer () - Since 2006\nIrregular categories:\n*Best Co-produce Film\n*Best Chinese Opera Film\n*Best Animation\n*Best Documentary\n*Best Cinematography\n*Best Original Score\n*Best Art Direction\nReferences\nSee also\n*Huabiao Awards"
