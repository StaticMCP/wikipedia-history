The 2011 census recorded 57,076 people born in New Zealand residing in England, 1,292 in Wales, 3,632 in Scotland and 584 in Northern Ireland. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, in 2015, the New Zealand-born population of the UK stood at around 59,000.\nAround 80 per cent of New Zealanders have some British ancestry and an estimated 17 per cent are entitled to British nationality by descent.\nDistribution\nEvery one of the top ten most popular places in Britain for New Zealand expatriates is in London, Acton being home to 1,045 New Zealand-born people (representing 0.7 per cent of the local population), with Hammersmith, Brondesbury, Hyde Park, Cricklewood and Fulham following.\nMāori\nAccording to Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, at the start of the millennium, approximately 8,000 Māori resided in England alone (as opposed to the United Kingdom as a whole). Historically Māori have been known in the UK for their athletic prowess on the rugby field as well as their various artistic skills. In the 1900s, Māori artistic performers toured the UK and some of them decided to stay. Mākereti (Maggie) Papakura of  is one example of an early Māori immigrant who came to the country touring with a troupe of performers; she married in 1912 and lived in the UK for the rest of her life. During World War I, significant numbers of Māori troops came to the UK in order to help fight with the British Army (at this period military service was one of the main reasons for Māori emigration). Many of these were actually housed in Papakura's Oxfordshire mansion. Later on in the 1950s, a small group of Māori residing in the British capital established the London Māori Club. The aim was to promote Māori culture through the performance of traditional songs and war dances. In 1971 the group renamed itself  Māori Club. To this day the  cultural group hosts weekly meetings, language classes and celebrations.\nNotable New Zealanders in Britain\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\nAcademia and Science\n* James Belich, historian\n* Alan F.
