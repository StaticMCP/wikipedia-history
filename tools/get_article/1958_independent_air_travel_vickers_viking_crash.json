The crew was cleared by Air Traffic Control to descend to 3000 feet, but they were unable to maintain this altitude and continued descending. A Mayday call was made from the aircraft at 06:32 GMT, shortly before it crashed into a row of houses on Kelvin Gardens, Southall, Middlesex.  The aircraft burst into flames on impact, killing all three crew members as well as four people on the ground, a mother and three children. Witnesses reported that they saw one of the crew waving from inside the aircraft just before it crashed.\nCause\nAccording to the Public inquiry which investigated the accident, the probable cause of the accident was that \"the aircraft was allowed to lose height and flying speed with the result that the pilot was no longer able to exercise asymmetric control.\" While the reasons for the loss of power and the subsequent loss of height and speed were not known, the public inquiry found a number of serious flaws in the operation of Independent Air Travel and the maintenance of the aircraft. Maintenance had been carried out on one of the aircraft propellers at Heathrow on the night before the accident by personnel who were not qualified to carry out the work.  The aircraft was overloaded and the pilot had not had adequate rest, having effectively been on duty for 31 hours 30 minutes compared with the 16 hours required by the regulations (This took advantage of a loophole in regulations that allowed crew to carry out flights during \"rest\" hours if no passengers or cargo was carried.). Check flights, which should have tested the pilot's ability to handle the aircraft at high weights and with one engine out were found to be \"perfunctory\" and did not adequately prove the pilot's ability to handle the aircraft with one engine failed.\nThe report stated that \"it is quite clear...that the policy of this company was to keep its aircraft in the air at all costs and without any real regard for the requirements of maintenance.\" and that \"it is not difficult for employers who are not unduly concerned to observe the regulations, to drive their employees and . . . to induce them to disregard the regulations designed to ensure safety in the air.\"\nAftermath\nBrian Gibbons, a 14-year-old schoolboy, was awoken by the crash, which ignited a fire in his house. Despite receiving severe burns to his body he managed to save himself and his infant nephew by jumping from his window into the arms of rescuers. For his heroism he received the civilian class of the George Medal from Elizabeth II in 1959 making him the youngest male to have received the award.\nReferences\n* \"[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=35364 Morning Disaster]\".
