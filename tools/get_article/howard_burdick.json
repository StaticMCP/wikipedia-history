He and his son, Clinton D. Burdick, are the only known pair of father-son flying aces.\nBiography\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Howard Burdick joined the Air Service, United States Army in 1917 and was deployed to France. He was assigned to the 17th Aero Squadron, and flew British Sopwith Camels while attached to the Royal Air Force. For his actions in combat, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for eight aerial victories, often flying in company with George Vaughn, his flight commander.\nBurdick forced down an enemy Fokker biplane with Vaughn on 14 October 1918. Burdick was excited with worry about the fate of his friend Howard Knotts, who had fallen behind enemy lines, and took his revenge on the downed German, shooting him to death on the ground.\nEventually settling in California, Burdick died in Los Angeles in January 1975.\nAerial victory list\nHoward Burdick achieved all his victories while flying a Sopwith Camel for the 17th Aero Squadron.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No.\n!Date/time\n!Foe\n!Result\n!Location\n!Notes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 1\n|| 18 September 1918 @ 1100 hours\n|| LVG reconnaissance craft\n|| Destroyed\n|| Rumilly\n||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2\n|| 24 September 1918 @ 1040 hours\n|| Fokker D.VII fighter\n|| Destroyed\n|| Northwest of Havrincourt\n||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 3\n|| 28 September 1918 @ 1745 hours\n|| LVG reconnaissance craft\n|| Destroyed\n||\n||\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 4\n|| 28 September 1918 @ 1810 hours\n|| Fokker D.VII fighter\n|| Destroyed\n|| Cambrai\n||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2 October 1918 @ 0910 hours\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| DFW reconnaissance craft\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Destroyed\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| East of Awoignt\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Victory shared with George Vaughn\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 6\n|| 14 October 1918 @ 0710 hours\n|| Halberstadt reconnaissance craft\n|| Destroyed\n|| East of Bazeul\n|| Victory shared with George Vaughn and another pilot\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 7\n|| 14 October 1918 @ 1400 hours\n|| Fokker D.VII fighter\n|| Destroyed\n|| Northeast of Hausey\n|| Victory shared with George Vaughn\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 8\n|| 25 October 1918 @ 1055 hours\n|| Fokker D.VII fighter\n|| Set afire and destroyed\n|| Mormal Woods\n||\n|}\nHonors and awards\nDistinguished Service Cross\nThe Distinguished Service Cross is presented to Howard Burdick, Second Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action northwest of Cambrai, France, September 28, 1918. Attacked by two Fokker biplanes, Lieutenant Burdick outmaneuvered both machines, shot one into flames and routed the other one. Later, seeing three Fokkers attacking an American aviator, he at once dove into the combat to his assistance, shooting down one and driving off the other two. His quick and unhesitating attack, single-handed, on the three Fokkers save the life of his fellow pilot. General Orders No. 38, W.D., 1921\nDistinguished Flying Cross\nFor skill and gallantry. On 25 October, while on an offensive patrol, this officer attacked a formation of five Fokker biplanes over the forest of Mormal and succeeded in shooting down one in flames. On another occasion he dived on an enemy two-seater but was in turn attacked by two Fokkers, one of which he succeeded in shooting down in flames. Later he attacked three enemy aircraft who were attacking one of our machines and shot down one which dived straight into the ground and crashed. This officer has now destroyed five EA (three in flames) and has at all times displayed the greatest gallantry, skill and disregard of danger.\nSee also\n* List of World War I flying aces from the United States\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Over the Front: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914-1918 (1992).
