      "text": "# Wee Warriors\n\nWee Warriors Ltd. was a game company formed shortly after the birth of role-playing games (RPGs) in the mid-1970s to publish RPG accessories. It was notable for publishing the first stand-alone  adventure for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, and for publishing the first character sheets for an RPG. The company thrived for several years while TSR distributed their unlicensed products. When TSR stopped distributing unlicensed materials, Wee Warriors tried diversifying, but ultimately ceased publication in 1978.\nHistory\nWhen TSR's Dungeons & Dragons began its quick rise to popularity, Pete and Judy Kerestan of El Segundo, California formed Wee Warriors in 1975 to publish accessories for the new game. For two years, Wee Warriors produced a variety of innovative products related to the D&D RPG market, notably the first stand-alone adventure, and the first set of character sheets. Although they did not have a license to produce D&D accessories, their early products were both promoted and distributed by TSR.\nThen in late 1977, with the release of the new Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules, the rapidly expanding TSR stopped distributing third-party materials. Wee Warriors tried diversifying, designing a Star Trek board game, and promoting a new science fiction play-by-mail game. But the company was unable to regain traction in the marketplace, and ceased publication in 1978.\nIn 2019, the intellectual property rights of Wee Warriors were acquired by Precis Intermedia.\nPublished material\nD&D adventures\n* ''Dungeon Master's Kit #1: Palace of the Vampire Queen'' (1976) - The first stand-alone RPG adventure module, set on the dwarven Isle of Baylor in the Misty Isles archipelago.)

The first several printings were loose-leaf pages; later printings were in stapled pamphlet-sized booklet form.\n* Dungeon Masters Kit #2: The Dwarven Glory (1977) - Another early adventure module also set on Baylor, although unrelated to the previous adventure.\nFor a time, TSR was the main distributor of the first two adventures, despite the fact that these were unlicensed products.\n* ''Dungeon Master's Kit #3: Misty Isles (1977) - A third adventure module, this involved travel to the other islands of the archipelago.
