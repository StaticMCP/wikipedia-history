      "text": "# Miss Island Queen Pageant\n\nMiss Island Queen (now Miss SOFIAS) is a faʻafafine pageant held annually in American Samoa. It is noted for being the longest standing pageant of its kind in the South Pacific. It was first held in 1979 before undergoing a series of changes. No pageant was held in 1980 and 1982 as it endured shifts in ownership and in 2020 and 2022 due to the covid pandemic. It was canceled in 1986 due to a tropical cyclone and failed to take place in both 1999 and 2002 when it struggled with funding. In 1996 It was held simultaneously on the same evening as another faʻafafine pageant Empress of Samoa. In 2008 the pageant coincided with the Festival of Pacific Arts and became the closing event of festivities. After undergoing extensive reestablishment in 2010 the pageant has since been held during Flag Day week and broadcast live on KVZK-2. It is now known as Miss SOFIAS and maintains yearly advocacy and charity programs.\nHistory\nThe pageant began as a marketing show for Herb & Sia's motel a family owned business, in its heyday it was a staple for Polynesian revues and local musicians. A gathering of faʻafafines shepherd by educators Leroy Lutu and Vena Sele led to pioneering the first fully organized beauty pageant in 1981. It came to prominence in the late 1980s when organizers incorporated educational awareness, community service and charitable causes in both American Samoa and neighboring Apia, Samoa. Governor A. P. Lutali was the first territorial leader to officially support the pageant in 1987 in years that followed numerous local dignitaries and politicians became fixtures at the event. The pageant was hugely successful by 1990 it spawned a faʻafafine performance troupe. The troupe entertained across the islands at public ceremonies and private events popularizing a streak of song and dance routines among them the apartheid anthem Gimme Hope Jo'anna, music from the soundtrack of Sarafina! and Samba in the night by Daniel Rae Costello many selections were opening themes of past island queen pageants. Power struggles corrupted the pageant in the mid-1990s resulting in the exploitation of faʻafafines in countless beauty pageants publicized for financial gain. Vena Sele and Leroy Lutu harbored creative differences and parted ways. Lutu went on to establish \"Empresses of Samoa\" and \"Mizz Corona\" pageants and Sele continued with Island Queens before leading \"Miss American Sevens\". American Sevens was originally operated under a netball association but at the height of its success became known as Seven Islands of American Samoa.\nIn the 2000s Miss American Sevens and Miss Island Queens pageants dominated the territory. In 2010 American Sevens and Island Queens communally retired uniting to become S.O.F.I.A.S (Society of Faʻafafine in American Samoa). Organizers also preserved history honoring past winners under its retooled name. Three distinctive awards were awarded during the history of both pageants. In 2000 high chief Tiumalu Sia Scanlan was presented with a special award, in 2006 longtime serving member Rosie Moimoi was recognized by Island Queens and in 2005 founder Vena Sele was honored by the American Sevens for her legacy and service to both the faʻafafine community and her pioneering career. Sele was the first fa'afafine to earn a doctorate degree, for a short term Sele was president of American Samoa Community College becoming the highest ranking fa'afafine at the time. Sele retired in 2005 and in 2007 published her autobiography \"Memoirs of a Samoan, Catholic and Fa’afafine\". Sele is widely known to have inspired many fa'afafines to pursue education many of whom affectionately call her \"Mama\". Sele lives in Tacoma, WA. Leroy Lutu rose to great success with the Department of Education and retired in 2011. He was a popular local personality well known for his fashionable taste and socialite status. In 2008 both Sele and Lutu returned for the 25th anniversary of Miss Island Queens it was their last time together on stage. Lutu died in 2012.\nNotable Contestants and Winners\n* Cindy Filo was 3rd runner up in 1987’s Miss Island Queen.
