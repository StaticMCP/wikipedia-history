The National Weather Service defines river flooding as \"the inundation of normally dry areas as a result of increased water levels in an established water course.\"\nA typical warning will state the forecast point covered by the warning, the current flood stage, the established flood stage, and the expected crest, which is issued by the River Forecast Center. The crest will usually occur at least six-seven hours after the start of the event and the flooding can be caused by heavy rain in the vicinity of the river, melting snow, or ice jams.\nExample\nThe following is an example of a River Flood Warning issued by the National Weather Service office in Peachtree City, Georgia.\nWGUS42 KFFC 240703\nFLWFFC\nGAC135-250658-\nBULLETIN - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED\nFLOOD WARNING\nNATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE PEACHTREE CITY GA\n158 AM EST TUE JAN 24 2006\n...RIVER FLOOD WARNING FOR PARTS OF THE SUWANEE CREEK...\nFOR THE SUWANEE CREEK NEAR SUWANEE...\nTHE LATEST STAGE WAS 7.9 FEET AT 2 AM TUESDAY.\nFLOOD STAGE IS 8.0 FEET.\nTHE FORECAST FOR THE SUWANEE CREEK NEAR SUWANEE...\nTHE RIVER WILL RISE ABOVE FLOOD STAGE AROUND 4 AM TUESDAY.\nTHE RIVER WILL CREST NEAR 8.2 FEET AROUND 7 AM TUESDAY.\nTHE RIVER WILL FALL BELOW FLOOD STAGE AROUND 12 PM TUESDAY.\nAT 8.0 FEET...FLOOD STAGE IS REACHED.
