She then says it is time for him to slay the demon lord threatening the land, shocking him.\n}}\n}}\nReception\nAlthough the series was well received in Japan, with its web serialization being popular with readers on Twitter, it was less popular internationally. GNN recommended the series to readers interested in the topic, calling it visually appealing with well done coloring. Comic Book Resources like the series' premise, and wrote that the series makes good use of the manga format, with its first-person perspective.\nAnime Anime thought that the format of the anime adaptation worked well, as one can watch several of the short episodes in one sitting, although Comic Book Resources noted that the anime had a hard time adapting the manga's point-of-view presentation. The Fandom Post was critical of the series, calling it \"trashy\" and full of bad messages, but well animated and having \"just stunning\" ending artwork for the episodes. They heavily panned episode 8, where Doge pretends to be a baby, as \"a whole new level of embarrassing in a big way\", but still found it funny to see Kanan turn things on Doge in episode 3, and thought the book talk in the beginning of episode 4 was cute.\nSee also\n*Addicted to Curry, a manga series by the same author\n*Yokai Girls, a manga series by the same author\n*Sundome!!
