      "text": "# List of ancient cities in Thrace and Dacia\n\n}}\nThis is a list of ancient cities, towns, villages, and fortresses in and around Thrace and Dacia. A number of these settlements were Thracian and Dacian, but some were Celtic, Greek, Roman, Paeonian, or Persian.\nA number of cities in Thrace and Dacia were built on or close to the sites of preexisting Dacian or Thracian settlements. Some settlements in this list may have a double entry, such as the Paeonian Astibo and Latin Astibus. It is believed that Thracians did not build true cities even if they were named as such; the largest Thracian settlements were large villages. The only known attempt to build a polis by the Thracians was Seuthopolis., although Strabo considered the Thracian cities with \"bria\" ending polises. Some of the Dacian settlements and fortresses employed the traditional Murus Dacicus construction technique.\nNote: Throughout these lists, an asterisk [*] indicates that the toponym is reconstructed.\nThracian and Dacian\nduring Burebista]]\nMany city names were composed of an initial lexical element affixed to -dava, -daua, -deva, -deba, -daba, or -dova, which meant \"city\" or \"town\"   Endings on more southern regions are exclusively -bria (\"town, city\"), -disza, -diza, -dizos (\"fortress, walled settlement\"), -para, -paron, -pera, -phara (\"town, village\"). Strabo translated -bria as polis, but that may not be accurate. Thracian -disza, -diza, and -dizos are derived from Proto-Indo-European *dheigh-, \"to knead clay\", hence to \"make bricks\", \"build walls\", \"wall\", \"walls\", and so on. These Thracian lexical items show a satemization of PIE *gh-. Cognates include Ancient Greek teichos (\"wall, fort, fortified town\", as in the town of Didymoteicho) and Avestan da?za (\"wall\").\nIt is suggested that the \"dava\" endings are from the Dacian language, while the rest from the Thracian language. However \"dava\" towns can be found as south as Sandanski and Plovdiv. Some \"dava\" toponyms contain the same linguistic features as \"diza\" toponyms, e.g. Pirodiza and Pirodava. The first written mention of the name \"Dacians\" is in Roman sources. Strabo specified that the Daci are the Getae, identified as a Thracian tribe.  The Dacians, Getae and their kings were always considered as Thracians by the ancients (Dio Cassius, Trogus Pompeius, Appian, Strabo, Herodotus and Pliny the Elder) and were said to speak the same language. The Dacian language is considered a variety of the Thracian language. Such lexical differentiation -dava vs. para, would be hardly enough evidence to separate Dacian from Thracian, thus they are classified as dialects. It is also possible that '-dava' and '-bria' mean two different things in the same language, rather than meaning the same thing in two different languages. Thus bria could have been used for urbanized settlements, similar in scale and design to those of the \"civilised\" peoples like Greeks and Romans, whereas '-dava' could mean a settlement which is rural, being situated in the steppe-like part of the Thracian lands.\n* Abydos\n* Acidava (Acidaua), a fortress town close to the Danube, located in today's Piatra-Olt, Olt County, Romania\n* Acmonia
