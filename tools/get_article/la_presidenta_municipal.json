The film was shot at Tlayacapan, Morelos, Mexico.\nPlot\nIn the small town of Chipitongo el Alto (in English: High Chipitongo), the political boss Don Mario N. Cruz is the only presidential (town mayor) candidate of that municipality. When the town's clumsy and blind pressman Don Casimiro Buenavista prints \"María\" instead of \"Mario\" on all the ballots, the presidential candidacy automatically reverts to María Nicolasa Cruz, an illiterate and indigenous potter. Once informed, María Nicolasa accepts her new job as municipal president of Chipitongo el Alto only to rebuke the town's corrupt secretaries. Mario Nicanor Cruz, the former candidate, plans several schemes along with lawyer Topillo in order to get rid of María.\nCast\n*María Elena Velasco as María Nicolasa Cruz\n*Adalberto Martínez as Cabo Melquiádes\n*Pancho Córdova as Mr. Peppermint\n*Fernando Soto as Don Chepito Domínguez\n*Joaquín García Vargas as Secretario López (credited as Joaquín García)\n*Raúl Meraz as Mario Nicanor Cruz\n*José Chávez Trowe as Pedro\n*Polo Ortín as Licenciado Hugo T.
