The Waite Islands are off Cape Waite, the northwest extremity of the peninsula.\nMarelli Glacier drains northeast from the peninsula into the Abbot Ice Shelf.\nMapping and name\nThe King Peninsula was photographed from the air by United States Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47.\nIt was plotted from these photos as a long island, or possible peninsula.\nPhotos taken by the United States Navy in 1966 show it is a peninsula.\nKing Peninsula was named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King, United States Navy, Chief of Naval Operations from 1942 to 1945, who approved the preliminary work for Operation Highjump (OpHjp).\nGlaciers\nGlaciers flowing into Peacock Sound are, from northwest to southeast,\nStapleton Glacier\nGlacier about  long flowing east  from King Peninsula just north of Morelli Glacier.\nNamed by US-ACAN after Jo Anne Stapleton, United States Geological Survey (USGS), Reston, Virginia, geographer and map specialist, participated in Antarctic map production from the 1980s to the present, part of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) team that compiled the 1:5,000,000-scale Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer maps of Antarctica and the 1: 250,000-scale Landsat TM image maps of the Siple Coast area.\nMorelli Glacier\n.\nA glacier in the west part of King Peninsula,  southeast of Cape Waite, draining northeast  to Abbot Ice Shelf in Peacock Sound.\nMapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-66.\nNamed by US-ACAN for Panfilo S. Morelli, glaciologist at Byrd Station, 1961-62.\nRignot Glacier\nGlacier about  long draining north from the King Peninsula into Abbot Ice Shelf.\nNamed by US-ACAN after Eric J. Rignot, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, geophysicist; uses field and remotely sensed data to study Antarctic glacier mechanics from the 1990s to the present.\nRosanova Glacier\nGlacier about  long flowing north from King Peninsula into the Abbot Ice Shelf.\nNamed by US-ACAN after Christine E. Rosanova, United States Geological Survey (USGS), Flagstaff, AZ; specialist in the use of satellite imagery for geological and glaciological studies from the early 1990s to 2002; a pioneer in the use of imagery for glacier velocity measurements.\nFeatures\nFeatures surrounding the peninsula include, clockwise from the south,\nCosgrove Ice Shelf\n.\nAn ice shelf  long and  wide, occupying the inner (east) part of the embayment between King Peninsula and Canisteo Peninsula.\nMapped from air photos taken by United States Navy OpHjp, 1946-47.\nNamed by US-ACAN for Lieutenant Jerome R. Cosgrove, United States Navy Reserve, assistant communications officer on the staff of the Commander, United States Navy Support Force, Antarctica, during United States Navy OpDFrz, 1967 and 1968.\nFerrero Bay\n.\nA body of water about  wide, lying immediately west of Cosgrove Ice Shelf and occupying the outer (west) part of the embayment between King and Canisteo Peninsulas.\nMapped from air photos taken by United States Navy OpHjp in December 1946.\nNamed by US-ACAN for Lieutenant Commander H.H. Ferrero, communications officer on the staff of the Commander, United States Navy Support Force, Antarctica, 1966-68.\nEarly Islands\n.\nGroup of small islands lying just west of Cosgrove Ice Shelf in the southeast  corner of Ferrero Bay, Amundsen Sea.\nMapped by USGS from ground surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-66.\nNamed by US-ACAN for Tommy Joe Early, biologist with the Ellsworth Land Survey, 1968-69.\nBurke Island\n.\nAn ice-covered island about  long and  wide, lying  southwest of Cape Waite, King Peninsula.\nDelineated from aerial photographs taken by United States Navy Squadron VX-6 in January 1960.\nNamed by US-ACAN for Admiral Arleigh A. Burke, United States Navy, Chief of Naval Operations during United States Navy Deep Freeze operations of 1956-61.\nWaite Islands\n.\nA group of small islands in Amundsen Sea, lying  west of Cape Waite, the northwest extremity of King Peninsula.\nMapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-66.\nNamed by US-ACAN for their proximity to Cape Waite.\nCape Waite\n.\nCape at the northwest extremity of King Peninsula, marking the southwest side of the entrance to Peacock Sound.\nDelineated from air photos taken by United States Navy OpHjp in December 1946.\nNamed by US-ACAN for Amory H. Waite, member of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1933-35, and communications specialist on the Atka vovage of 1955 and the United States Navy Bellingshausen Sea Expedition of 1959-60.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* }}\n*"
