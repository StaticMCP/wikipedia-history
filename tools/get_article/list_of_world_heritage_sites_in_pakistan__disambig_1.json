      "text": "# List of World Heritage Sites in Pakistan__disambig_1\n\n}}\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Pakistan ratified the convention on 23 July 1976, making its sites eligible for inclusion on the list.\nThere are six World Heritage Sites in Pakistan, and a further 26 on the tentative list. The first three sites were listed in 1980, the Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro, Buddhist Ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Neighbouring City Remains at Sahr-i-Bahlol, and Taxila. Two sites were listed in 1981 and the most recent site added to the list was the Rohtas Fort, in 1997. All six sites are cultural.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\"| Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Archaeological Ruins at Moenjodaro\n|\n| Sindh\n| 1980\n| 138; ii, iii (cultural)\n| Mohenjo-daro was one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation and was the first planned city in South Asia. Located on the banks of the Indus River, it flourished between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE. The city was mostly built with baked brick and followed a strict grid plan. There were public baths, a granary, and an elaborate drainage system. A Buddhist stupa was built over the ruins in the 2nd century CE. The excavations at the site have been ongoing since 1922, with about one third of the city having been explored so far.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Taxila\n|\n| Punjab\n| 1980\n| 139; iii, vi (cultural)\n| Taxila, which was already inhabited in the Neolithic, was an important Buddhist centre of learning between the 5th century BCE and 2nd century CE. The archaeological site comprises the remains of four settlements which reveal the urban development of the site. The city was located on one of the branches of the Silk Road and was influenced by the Achaemenid Empire and by the Greeks. The Bhir Mound is associated with the entrance of Alexander the Great into Taxila in 326 BCE. Some of the monuments include the Jaulian monastery, the Mohra Muradu stupa, the Dharmarajika Stupa, the Jandial complex, and the city of Sirkap (the remains of a stupa at the site pictured).\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Buddhist Ruins of Takht-i-Bahi and Neighbouring City Remains at Sahr-i-Bahlol\n|\n| Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\n| 1980\n| 140; iv (cultural)\n| The Buddhist monastery of Takht-i-Bahi (pictured) was founded in the 1st century CE and remained in use until the 7th century. Due to its location on the crest of a steep hill, it remained well preserved despite successive invasions of the region. The monastery and the remains of the nearby city of Seri Bahlol from the Kushan period are some of the most important Buddhist monuments in the Gandhara region. The monastery is the most complete Buddhist monastery in Pakistan and comprises several groups of stupas, monastic cells, temples, and secular buildings.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Historical Monuments at Makli, Thatta\n|\n| Sindh\n| 1981\n| 143; iii (cultural)\n| Makli is a large necropolis in the city of Thatta.

The Fort is located at the northwest corner of the Walled City of Lahore and has been destroyed and rebuilt several times during its history. The extant monuments date from the 16th century, during the reign of Akbar. The Shalimar Gardens were constructed under the emperor Shah Jahan in 1642. They are an example of Mughal gardens which were influenced by Persian and Islamic traditions.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Rohtas Fort\n|\n| Punjab\n| 1997\n| 586; ii, iv (cultural)\n| The fort was constructed under Sher Shah Suri, following his victory over the Mughal Emperor Humayun in 1541. It is an exceptional example of early Islamic military architecture in the gunpowder era, integrating artistic traditions from Turkey and the Indian subcontinent. It served as a model for the later Mughal architecture. It was never conquered in battle and remains intact today.\n|}\nTentative list\nIn addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination. Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list. Pakistan has 26 properties on its tentative list.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\" | Site\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\" | Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\" | Location\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" | UNESCO criteria\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Badshahi Mosque, Lahore\n|\n| Punjab\n| 1993\n| (cultural)\n| This mosque in the city of Lahore is an exceptional example of Mughal architecture.

The technology probably developed in the 1st millennium BCE in Persia and then spread to arid and semi-arid areas of China, South Asia, Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. Tapping into the subterranean water sources allowed settlement and agriculture in areas that would otherwise be unexploitable. More than 1000 such systems are still operational in Pakistan, four are listed in the nomination.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Nagarparkar Cultural Landscape\n|\n| Sindh\n| 2016\n| iii, iv (cultural)\n| The cultural landscape is located in Nagarparkar, on the border of the Thar Desert. It was a centre of a thriving Jain community which was active in maritime trade, as the area was located at the coast of the Arabian Sea as late as in the 15th century. Several Jain monuments remain from the period between the 12th and 15th centuries, including the Gori Temple (pictured). Due to the changes of the coastline due to silting by the Indus River system, the community declined in numbers, with the last members leaving following the partition of India in 1947.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Central Karakoram National Park\n|\n| Gilgit Baltistan\n| 2016\n| ix, x (natural)\n| The national park covers large part of the central Karakoram mountain range. Four peaks over  are located in the park, as well as several glaciers (the Baltoro Glacier pictured). The area is a highly active tectonic zone, as a result of the Himalayan orogeny. The area is also an important stopover for migrating birds and home to endangered mammal species, including markhor, musk deer, snow leopard, urial, and Marco Polo sheep.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Deosai National Park\n|\n| Gilgit Baltistan\n| 2016\n| ix, x (natural)\n| Deosai National Park is an alpine plateau with an altitude between . The landscape is mostly flat with rolling hills. Due to its location at the meeting of the Himalayan and Karakorum-Pamir ecoregions, the area is rich in biodiversity. Some of the species that live here include the Himalayan brown bear, Tibetan wolf, Himalayan ibex, and Golden marmot. The Sheosar Lake (pictured), at the altitude of , represents a unique type of alpine wetland.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Ziarat Juniper Forest\n|\n| Balochistan\n| 2016\n| x (natural)\n| The juniper (Juniperus excelsa polycarpos) forests around the city of Ziarat are located at the meeting point of five vegetation zones. The large forest is home to trees that are believed to be thousands of years old, but the ecosystem is vulnerable in view of climate change. The area is home to the Balochistan black bear, Himalayan brown bear, markhor, numerous bird species, and several plant species with medicinal properties that are used by the local people.\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | The Salt Range and Khewra Salt Mine\n|\n| Punjab\n| 2016\n| v, viii (mixed)\n| The geological formation of Salt Range formed 800 million years ago with the evaporation of a shallow sea, resulting in thick deposits of rock salt. Due to lack of plant cover, the area provides an excellent opportunity to study geological layers from the Cambrian to the Paleogene, with several layers bearing fossils. The salt reserves at Khewra have been known at least since the 4th century BCE when Alexander the Great crossed the area, while the salt mine (pictured) has been in operation for over a thousand of years.\n|}\nSee also\n* List of Intangible Cultural Heritage elements in Pakistan\n* Cultural heritage in Pakistan\n* List of parks and gardens in Pakistan\n* List of forts in Pakistan\n* List of museums in Pakistan\nReferences\nExternal links"
