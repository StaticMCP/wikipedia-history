The result was a Roman victory and end of the Second Samnite War.\nAftermath\nThe consul Tiberius Minucius Augurinus died of his wounds during or after the battle.The battle of Bovianum at last completely crushed the spirit of the Samnites, who, unable to continue the war, were obliged to accept the terms dictated by Romans. The Romans won the Battle of Bovianum and the Saints declined after 314 BC the Samnites to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies.\nReferences\nSources\n* Livy, Ab urbe condita 9, 44, 5-16\n* Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca historica 20, 90, 3-4"
