It was released as a single in 1979. Grant's original version was not a hit, but the song was remade three years later by Rockers Revenge, a studio project assembled by producer Arthur Baker, which became the hit version.\nRockers Revenge version\n| released   = 1982\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = Post-disco\n| length     = 3:44 (7\")9:30 (Vocal, 12\")\n| label      =\n| writer     = Eddy Grant\n| producer   = Arthur Baker\n| chronology = Rockers Revenge\n| prev_title = Sunshine Partytime\n| prev_year  = 1982\n| next_title = The Harder They Come\n| next_year  = 1982\n}}\nRockers Revenge released their version as a single in 1982, with vocals by Donnie Calvin. It peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top thirty in Belgium, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. The single did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100, but was number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart for one week and also peaked at number 63 on the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart. The song's bassline would later be sampled in Eleanor's 1988 song \"Adventure\", itself a number-one Dance Club Play hit in 1988.\nPersonnel\n* Fred Zarr – bass guitar, keyboard instrument\n* Donnie Calvin – vocals\n* Bashiri Johnson – percussion\n* Jellybean Benitez and Arthur Baker – mixers\nChart performance and certifications\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n!
