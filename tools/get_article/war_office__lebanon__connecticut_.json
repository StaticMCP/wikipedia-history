Joseph Trumble Store and Office, is a historic commercial building on the Lebanon Green in Lebanon, Connecticut, built about 1732 as a commercial building. It is most significant as the place from which Governor Jonathan Trumbull conducted military business during the American Revolutionary War.  It is now part of the museum property managed by the Connecticut Society of the Sons of the American Revolution that also includes the Trumbull House and the Wadsworth Stables.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\nDescription and history\nThe War Office is located facing Lebanon's elongated village green on the west side of West Town Street north of the Governor Jonathan Trumbull House, a National Historic Landmark.   It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central brick chimney, and clapboarded exterior.  Its façade has the main entrance on the left side and two sash windows irregularly spaced.  The side elevations have single windows on the ground floor and attic levels.  The interior is plainly finished and houses museum exhibits.\nThe War Office was built around 1732 by Captain Joseph Trumbull as a place to conduct his merchant business, but it is most significant for its use during the American Revolutionary War.  It served as the war office of Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull, with more than 1,000 councils of war taking place there.  Visitors to the office included George Washington, Rochambeau, Lauzun, Lafayette, Admiral de Ternay, Generals Henry Knox, John Sullivan, and Israel Putnam, and political leaders Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay.  The Lebanon Green was also where the French Army's cavalry wintered in 1780-81 before joining the rest of their army for the march to Yorktown, Virginia. The War Office was abandoned and in deteriorating condition when it was given to the Connecticut chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution in 1891, and it has served as a museum since.\nSee also\n*March Route of Rochambeau's army\n*List of historic sites preserved along Rochambeau's route\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.sarconnecticut.org/historic-sites/trumbull-war-office// Trumbull War Office] - CT Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution"
