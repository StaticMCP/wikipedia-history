It is particularly notable as being one of the best selling contemporary Christian music (CCM) albums during the 1980s in the UK.\nThe album's tracks were all originally released during Richard's renaissance period of the late 1970s and early 1980s on his studio albums, live albums, and the B-side of his pop singles. The track selection wraps up most of the Gospel tracks Richard released in the period that were not included on his two Gospel studio albums of the period, Small Corners (1978) and ''Now You See Me, Now You Don't (1982). A follow-up gospel compilation album It's a Small World'' was released the following year (1985), but it only contained two tracks not already available on earlier Richard albums; namely, \"Tiny Planet\" (previously unreleased) and \"Moving In\" (B-side of \"Carrie\", 1980).\nTrack listing\nAs per the album liner notes and record centre-label:\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.jasperian.org/crisis-magazine/jun12 Tony Jasper's Crisis Magazine June 2012]"
