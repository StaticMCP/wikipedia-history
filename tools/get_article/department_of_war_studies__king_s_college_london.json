Amongst them are former Prime Minister of Jordan Marouf al-Bakhit; Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Iraq Nickolay Mladenov, the Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Tom de Bruijn, the Swedish Minister for Defence Pål Jonson and former Commandant General Royal Marines Sir Robert Fry. It also houses research institutes and centres, including the Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives.\nIt draws much of its faculty and visiting staff from the Euro-Atlantic intelligence, defence and diplomatic communities. They include former GCHQ chief David Omand; former foreign secretary Malcom Rifkind; former British ambassador to the US Nigel Sheinwald; ex-national security advisor Mark Lyall Grant; former head of MI6 John Sawers; and former chair of the UK’s Joint Intelligence Committee Peter Ricketts.\nSince 2023, the Head of Department has been Matthew Moran. The Department of War Studies is located on the 6th floor of the Grade I listed King's Building on the Strand Campus of King's College London. It offers a range of undergraduate, postgraduate, doctoral and post-doctoral programmes and opportunities, as well as a unique three-year War Studies bachelor's degree.\nHistory\nA Department of Military Science existed at King's College London from 1848 to 1859. Military science was subsequently approved as a subject for the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science general degrees from 1913-14, and was taught under the Faculty of Arts as well as the Faculty of Engineering.\nIn 1926 the intervention of William Norton Medlicott prevented the Department of History from ridding itself of the lectureship in military history. With War Office support, the Military Studies Department was established in 1927 by the University of London following University of Oxford's example, and formed part of the Faculty of Arts, with Major General Sir Frederick Barton Maurice holding the Chair. It became known as the War Studies Department in 1943 but was discontinued in 1948, although the subject continued to be taught under the Department of Medieval and Modern History.\nFollowing World War II, there was an initiative by senior members of University of London notably Lionel Robbins, Sir Charles Webster and Keith Hancock, to revive military studies at the university. In 1953, Sir Michael Howard was appointed to the Lectureship in Military Studies, and by 1962 Sir Michael was able to reinstate the Department of War Studies to offer postgraduate courses.\nA Bachelor of Arts degree in War Studies was offered from 1992 onwards. The department became part of the School of Humanities in 1989 and the School of Social Science and Public Policy in 2001.\nIn 2022 the department celebrated its 60th anniversary with a series of events.\nUkraine conflict research and analysis\nSince the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, academics from the department have played a world-leading role in providing research and commentary on the war.\nIn the first 12 months of the war, staff from the department contributed expertise to 26,120 articles and news broadcasts, including syndicated articles and repeat broadcasts, for outlets such as The Financial Times, The Washington Post, The Associated Press, The Sunday Times, Newsweek, the BBC and Channel 4, among others.\nThe department received recognition for its contribution to global understanding of the conflict from the Public Relations and Communications Association, receiving highly commended for its 'Ukraine Explained' series, which brought together over 40 essays from its academics on the crisis.\nIn 2022, the department launched the London Defence Conference in collaboration with current affairs analysis and news site Reaction. In 2023, following the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke at the conference, where he described the People's Republic of China as an \"epoch defining challenge to us\".\nNotable alumni and students\nGovernment and politics\n|155px]]\n|155px]]\n*Marouf al-Bakhit (PhD 1990), former Prime Minister of Jordan\n*Martin Bourke (MA 1970), former Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands\n*Tom de Bruijn (MA 1974), Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation\n*Eoghan Murphy (MA 2005), former Irish Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.\n*Tan Chuan-Jin (MA 1999), Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore\n*Kayode Fayemi (PhD 1987), Nigerian Governor\n*Mark Francois (MA 1987), Conservative Member of UK Parliament\n*John Freeman (PhD 1984) Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands\n*Christopher Geidt, Baron Geidt (MA 1987),  Crossbench peer\n*Natalia Gherman (MA 1999), former Acting Prime Minister of Moldova\n*John Hillen (MA 1993), former US Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs\n*Dan Jarvis (MA 2011), Labour Member of UK Parliament\n*Imran Ahmad Khan (BA, 1996), Conservative Member of UK Parliament\n*Nickolay Mladenov (MA 1996), UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process\n*Jiří Šedivý (MA 1994), Director of European Defence Agency, former Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic to NATO\n*Keith Simpson (postgraduate research 1972), former Conservative Member of Parliament\n*Pritam Singh (MA 2004), Singaporean Opposition Leader\n*Shaun Spiers (MA 1985), former Labour Member of the European Parliament\n*Eleni Stavrou (MA; PhD), Member of the Cyprus House of Representatives\n*Tsai Ming-yen (diplomat) (PhD), Director-General of the National Security Bureau (Taiwan)\nMilitary, security and diplomacy\n|155px]]\n|155px]]\n|155px]]\n*A.T.M.

The rivalry between 'Peace Studies' and 'War Studies' was featured on the Financial Times list of \"Great college sports rivalries\". The competition is named after War and Peace, the 1869 novel written by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. The \"trophy\" is a framed copy of the book. It is kept by the department of the current winners.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/index.aspx Official website of the Department of War Studies]"
