In medieval times, it came to refer to the religious conquest by reputed founders of the major Hindu renunciate traditions, namely Madhva, Sankara, Chaitanya, and Vallabha.\nMilitary and moral conquest\nDigvijaya as a military conquest is often mentioned in Indian history and mythology, for example, the digvijaya of Bharata Chakravartin. It was followed by rituals confirming the divine grace and imperial authority of the conqueror. With his conquest, the Chakravartin unified India as a \"moral empire\" governed by a higher order.  The Buddhist Digha Nikaya (Chapter 26.6-7), also talks about a wheel-turning monarch (Cakravartin), who propagates Dharma in the four corners under his rulership.\nReligious conquest\nAccording to Sax, the religious connotation to the term digvijaya may have emerged as a response to the decline of the imperial digvijaya, consequent to the Muslim conquest  of most of India.\nMadhva Digvijayam\nSumadhva Vijaya, (\"The story of the victory of Madhva,\") also referred as Sri Madhva Vijaya, (or simply as Madhva Vijaya) is a 14th century hagiographical work of the Dvaita philosopher Madhvacharya. It was composed by Narayana Panditacharya, who was the son of Trivikrama Panditacharya, a direct disciple of Madhvacharya and a famous Advaita exponent before his conversion to the Madhva tradition.\nSumadhva Vijaya is a Mahakavya, ''('great poem'), a specific Sanskrit literary genre, containing sixteen \"sargas\"'' or cantos. It starts with a description of the first two avatars of Vayu, namely Hanuman and Bhima. It then proceeds to describe the life of Madhva, who is considered the third avatar, giving detailed descriptions of various incidents of Madhva's life.\nSeveral commentaries have been written on it, including one written by Narayana Panditacharya, called Bhava Prakashika. The next oldest commentary  on Sumadhva Vijaya is by Vedanga Tirtha, called Padartha Dipika. Another relevant commentary is the Padartha Dipikodbodhika by Vishwapati Tirtha of Pejawara Matha. \"Mandopakarini\" of Chalari Sheshacharya is also quite popular\nShankara Vijayams\nShankara Vijayams (IAST ) are traditional hagiographies of the Advaita Vedanta exegete Adi Shankara, describing his 'conquest of the four quarters'. In these hagiographies, Shankara is deified as a ruler-renunciate, bringing harmony to the four quarters. The genre may have been modelled on the digvijayas of Madhva, since the oldest Shankara-hagiography post-dates Madhva (1238-1317). The Shankara-digvijayams mimick the royal digvijayams, as his 'conquest of the four quarters' and the establishment of his kingdom is followed by his coronation with this ascent of the Throne of Omniscience (sarvajña-pīṭha), akin to the rajasuya rites.\nThe main Shankaravijayams are:\n* Anandagirīya Shankaravijayam (of Anandagiri, not extant)\n* Anantanadagiri Shankaravijayam (extant from 15th century, but controversial in nature)\n* Cidvilāsīya Shankaravijayam (of Chidvilasa, c. between 15th century and 17th century\n* Keralīya Shankaravijayam (extant in Kerala, c. 17th century)\n* Madhavīya Shankara (Dig)vijayam (of Madhava). Usually attributed to Madhava-Vidyaranya, and dated to the 14th century. The attribution and dating is disputed; the author was a Madhavi, and the correct date seems to be the 17th or even 18th century.\nSee also\n* Shiva Digvijaya\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n;Madhva\n* [http://vyasamadhwa.org/upanyasa/SumadhwaVijaya/ Discourse on Sumadhva Vijaya (Kannada) by Vidwan Vyasanakere Prabhanjanacharya.]\n* [http://www.dvaita.org/madhva/index.shtml Biographical links to Madhvacharya and other dvaita resources]\n* [http://www.dvaita.net Madhva and other Dvaita saints text resource]\n* [http://shivallibrahmins.com/section/english/great-acharyas/shriman-madhvacharya/ Complete Biography of Sriman Madhvacharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094621/http://geocities.com/Augusta/Fairway/1533/sumadhwa.htm]\n* [http://gyanasampat.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7&Itemid=11 Madhwa Vijaya Audio]\n;Shankara\n*[http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/sankara-vijayam.html The Sankaravijaya Literature]&mdash;  a detailed discussion of the various Shankara Vijayams"
