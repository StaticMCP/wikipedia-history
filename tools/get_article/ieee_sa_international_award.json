Recognition consists of a crystal globe and certificate.\nAchieving acceptance of an IEEE standard for worldwide implementation, harmonizing an IEEE standard with international market requirements, and interacting with national and international bodies to enhance their understanding of the breadth and strength of the SA standards program are but examples of promoting the world-class leadership goal.\nThe International Award is to recognize an IEEE-SA member who whatever the venue or activity, has excelled in this endeavor.\nRecipients\n*2019 - W.
