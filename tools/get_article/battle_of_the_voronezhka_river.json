The first attack proved fruitless, the Swedes suffered heavy losses and retreated to the Voronezhka River. 5 days later, Svyatoslav came with the Novgorodians and defeated the Swedes. According to the chronicle, \"they escaped and died a little\" (the wounded).\nThe Novgorodians won, led by their posadniks Zahariya and Nezhatoy and Novgorod Prince Svyatoslav Rostislavich. Information about the siege of Ladoga and the Battle of Voronezh remained in the The First Novgorod Chronicle. According to legend, in honor of this victory, St. George's Church was built in the Ladoga Fortress.\nAfter this defeat, the Swedes did not attack the Novgorod lands for 76 years.\nMemory\nSince 2012, in the village Samushkino Volkhovsky district is hosting the Victory of the Russian Soldiers holiday.\nExternal links\n* [http://nestoriana.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/voronezzka / http://nestoriana.wordpress.com Sergey Kuzmin.
