The album was released on August 26, 2003, by Artemis Records. Zevon began recording the album shortly after he was diagnosed with inoperable pleural mesothelioma (a cancer of the lining of the lung), and it was released just two weeks before his death on September 7, 2003. The album was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and \"Disorder in the House\", performed by Zevon with Bruce Springsteen, won the Grammy for Best Rock Vocal Performance (Group or Duo). Songs from the album were nominated for an additional three Grammys.\nRecording and release\nUpon learning of his cancer diagnosis, Zevon became determined to record a final studio album. His record label gave him a large budget to record, and he got assistance from high-profile friends such as Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Jackson Browne, and Billy Bob Thornton. Zevon was inspired to include a Bob Dylan cover after Dylan performed several of his songs in concert in 2002.\nCritical reception\nThe record was regarded by Robert Christgau as \"one of those nearness-of-death albums\", along with Mississippi John Hurt's Last Sessions (1972), Neil Young's Prairie Wind (2005), and Johnny Cash's ''American VI: Ain't No Grave (2010).\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Jorge Calderón and Warren Zevon, except where indicated.\nPersonnel\nAdapted credits from the liner notes of The Wind''.\n;\"Dirty Life and Times\"\n* Warren Zevon&nbsp;– vocals and acoustic guitar\n* Ry Cooder&nbsp;– guitar\n* Jorge Calderón&nbsp;– bass guitar\n* Don Henley&nbsp;– drums\n* Billy Bob Thornton&nbsp;– backing vocals\n* Dwight Yoakam&nbsp;– backing vocals\n;\"Disorder in the House\"\n* Warren Zevon&nbsp;– vocals\n* Jorge Calderón&nbsp;– bass guitar, acoustic guitar and percussion\n* Jim Keltner&nbsp;– drums\n* Bruce Springsteen&nbsp;– electric guitar and backing vocals\n;\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\"\n* Warren Zevon&nbsp;– vocals\n* Jorge Calderón&nbsp;– backing vocals, bass\n* Brad Davis&nbsp;– electric guitar and backing vocals\n* Steve Gorman&nbsp;– drums\n* Randy Mitchell&nbsp;– slide guitar and backing vocals\n* Tommy Shaw&nbsp;– 12-string acoustic guitar and backing vocals\n* Billy Bob Thornton&nbsp;– backing vocals\n* John Waite&nbsp;– backing vocals\n;\"Numb as a Statue\"\n* Warren Zevon&nbsp;– vocals and piano\n* Jorge Calderón&nbsp;– bass guitar, maracas and backing vocals\n* Jim Keltner&nbsp;– drums\n* David Lindley&nbsp;– lap steel guitar\n;\"She's Too Good for Me\"\n* Warren Zevon&nbsp;– vocals and acoustic guitar\n* Jorge Calderon&nbsp;– bass guitar\n* Luis Conte&nbsp;– drums and percussion\n* Don Henley&nbsp;– backing vocals\n* Timothy B.

Eddie Vedder performed the song for David Letterman's award ceremony in 2017 for the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, with Vedder noting Letterman's role in introducing him to Zevon's music. Further covers of the song have included Christine Albert's 2014 album Everything’s Beautiful Now, Wesley Schultz on his 2018 album Vignettes, a 2023 single release by Fantastic Cat, and by Willie Nelson for his 2024 album Last Leaf on the Tree. Nelson's cover was noted by American Songwriter for capturing a similar view on mortality as Zevon's original performance, with Nelson's guitarwork with Trigger sounding similarly aged and \"beat up.\"\n}}"
