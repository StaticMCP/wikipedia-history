The suburb is a popular destination in Brisbane due to its coastline, jetty and tidal wading pool. In the , Wynnum had a population of 14,036 people. Wynnum and the adjoining suburb Manly were once known as twin towns.\nGeography\n, North Stradbroke Island and mangroves from Wynnum]]\nWynnum is on the shores of Moreton Bay in Brisbane, Australia, about  by road east of the Brisbane GPO.\nToponymy\nWynnum likely derives from a Durubalic word meaning pandanus palm (aka 'breadfruit') or mud crab.\nHistory\nAboriginal history of Quandamooka (Moreton Bay) stretches back over 25,000 years and Aboriginal connection to the Wynnum area (Originally Winnam) has remained strong throughout European colonisation. Thomas Petrie, a visitor in the 1840s, described Wynnum as a large Aboriginal camp (centred on what is now Elanora Park , referred to as Black's Camp as late as the 1980s) for launching expeditions to hunt turtle, dugong and flying fox on the neighbouring islands. European settlement first appeared at North Wynnum (around the mouth of Wynnum Creek) at the fringe of Black's Camp.\nAboriginal men from Black's Camp helped build the original Wynnum jetty in the 1850s, and in 1886, three local Aboriginal men, 'Johnny Murray, Tommy Nuggin and Sam', saved three European women from drowning in Wynnum Creek. Local Aboriginal people also ran fishing, oyster-catching and turtle hunting enterprises from Wynnum into the early 1900s, with these tours advertised in Brisbane's newspapers. There were some tensions with the European newcomers, including an unprovoked attack by local ruffians on the Aboriginal camp in Wynnum in 1884. Well known Jagera chief 'King Sandy' Kerwalli (aka Gairballie) died at Black's Camp in 1900.\nThe area remained sparsely settled by Europeans until the arrival of the railway in the late 1880s, but then grew fairly rapidly. On Saturday 22 November 1890, 95 subdivided allotments of Wynnum Station Estate were auctioned by R. J. Cottell. A map advertising the auction show them to be near Bridge Street and close to Wynnum Railway Station.\nOn 20 August 1890, a Wesleyan Methodist church was opened in Wilde Street, the first church built at Wynnum. It was  and built by John Iley Green of Thompson Estate. Having become too small for the congregation, another church was built at 24 Ashton Street (), which was officially opened on Wednesday 2 April 1902 with the first service being conducted on Sunday 6 April 1902. It was also built by John Iley Green in the Carpenter Gothic style. A Sunday School hall was added in February 1929. In early 1958 the church was closed while it was extended by a further  with services being held temporarily in the hall. The church officially re-opened on Sunday 11 April 1958. In June 1977 it became part of the Uniting Church of Australia. Following the amalgamation of a number of local congregations to form the Bayside Uniting Church, the church was closed with a final service on 8 July 1990. It was sold in November 1990 into private ownership for $112,000 and was converted into a residence. On 1 January 2004 the 1902 church building was listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register.\nIn October 1892 the adherents of the Church of England in Wynnum decided to buy half an acre of land in Charlotte Street (now 77 Charlotte Street, ) for £50 to erect a church. After some years of fund raising, on Saturday 8 October 1896 the foundation stone was laid in the presence of the Bishop of Brisbane William Webber and the Premier of Queensland James Dickson. St Peter's Anglican Church was officially opened and dedicated on Thursday 9 March 1899.\nWynnum State School  opened on 24 February 1896. In 1910 it was renamed Wynnum Central State School.

Wynnum Central State School's website was archived.\nThe former Wynnum Shire Council was created in 1902, and twelve years later Wynnum became a municipality with its own town council and the right to elect a mayor. Black's Camp was disbanded in 1908, and the area was redeveloped into Elanora Park in the 1930s. The Wynnum Town Council was absorbed into the enlarged City of Brisbane in 1925.Wynnum North State School was established in 1911. The school originally opened in 1882 as Lytton State School but in 1911 the buildings were relocated from Lytton to Wynnum North on the corner of Tingal Road and Prospect Street () and the school renamed Wynnum North State School in 1911. It closed on 31 December 2010 as it was amalgamated with Lindum State School and Wynnum Central State School to create a new Wynnum State School. Wynnum North State School's website was archived.\nIn 1912, a Baptist church opened in Wynnum. Prior to the opening of the church, Baptist services were held in the Wynnum Shire Hall. Having purchased 3 allotments in Edith Street, a stump-capping ceremony was held on Sunday 13 October 1912. The dedication ceremony for the completed church was held on Saturday 21 December 1912. As the congregation grew, the need to enlarge the church resulted in a decision in 1930 to relocate the church building to 168 Bay Terrace on land donated by couple Edward Robert and Catherine Harriet Humphreys (members of the congregation). The building is still extant and listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register, but no longer in use as a church.\nGuardian Angels Catholic Primary School was officially opened by Archbishop James Duhig on Sunday 4 October 1914. It was operated by the Sisters of Mercy. The first principal was Sister Mary Winifred who commenced lessons on Monday 5 October 1914. By the end of 1914, the school had an enrolment of 73 students. In 2004, the school expanded to a second campus, formerly occupied by Mount Carmel Catholic Secondary School (which relocated to Thornlands).\nIn November 1914, the Wynnum Sports Ground Estate was advertised as being available for sale on the ground by Cameron Bros. In July 1921, Wavell's Vineyard Estate was advertised as being available for sale by public auction on the ground by Isles, Love & Co.\nA congregation of the Church of Christ began meeting in the home of Mr and Mrs A. Hinrichsen in Bride Street, who then donated land in Mary Street (now 55 Berrima Street, ) for a chapel. On Saturday 12 December 1925, the congregation built most of the chapel in a day with the assistance of members of other congregations (about 60 men were involved). The opening service was held on Sunday 20 December 1925. In March 1930, a hall was built adjoining the chapel, doubling the floor area. The interior of the chapel was refurbished in 1972. Due to declining attendances and rising costs, the chapel held its final service on Sunday 29 September 2013.\nSt John's Anglican Church was dedicated circa 1929. It was at 54 Randall Road (approx ). It closed circa 1995.\nOn 9 January 1932, a stump-capping ceremony was held for a new Presbyterian Church in Tingal Road. The 1918 church was demolished so it might be remodelled as the new church.The Wynnum Seventh-day Adventist Church was established in late 1937 with the first minister being Pastor Septimus Wilfred Carr. Initially they met in private homes and then held at Wynnum RSL Hall and then at the Wynnum St Peters Church of England Hall. In 1947, a block of land was purchased at the corner of Sunflower and Carnation Street, Wynnum and in 1948 the Mitchelton Methodist Hall was purchased and moved to the site as the congregations' first church.\nOn 21 August 1941, the Minister for Works and Education, Harry Bruce, laid the foundation stone for Wynnum State High School. The school was to occupy part of Russell Park (now Memorial Park) which had belonged to the Brisbane City Council. In return for giving up part of the park, the Queensland Government gave the council the land which is Primose Park today. Wynnum State High School was completed in time to open in February 1942, but, due to fears of a Japanese invasion, the Queensland Government delayed the re-opening of schools that year. The school finally opened on 2 March 1942, but it was not until Saturday 3 July 1943 that the school was officially opened by the Minister for Education, Arthur Jones.\nIn 1956, Anglicans in Wynnum constructed a Sunday school at Primrose Parade (Sibley Road end, approx ). In 1964 they constructed a church hall, which was dedicated on 3 May 1964 by Coadjutor Bishop John Hudson as St Margaret's Anglican Church Hall. In 1984 the new St Peter's Anglican Church opened at 77 Charlotte Street  and this led to the closure of St Margaret's Church Hall on 11 August 1985, after which St Margaret's was relocated to Murarrie to become St Clare's Anglican Church and the Primrose Parade site was sold for residential development.\nMount Carmel Catholic Secondary School College opened in 1957. It closed on 31 December 1992, when it relocated to Thornlands, re-opening as Carmel College.\nSt Oswald's Anglican Church in Wynnum North was dedicated circa 1957. It was in Prospect Street.
