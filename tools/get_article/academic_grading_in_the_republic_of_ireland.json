It is usually the number of points awarded to the student that forms the basis for the student's acceptance or otherwise into a course of higher education (e.g. a university degree course).\nA number of points between 0 and 100 are awarded to students for each Leaving Certificate exam sat. The students then combine the points from their six top scoring exams, to obtain a final total score between 0 and 625.\nThe number of points awarded for a particular grade depend on whether the student sat the exam for the 'Higher Level' course or the 'Ordinary Level' course. Points are awarded for foundation level maths for admission only on some courses.\nAnything below a H8 or O7 is considered a failing grade, and no points are awarded.  25 bonus points will continue to be awarded for Higher Level Mathematics for H6 grades and above. For example, if an applicant receives a H6 grade, an additional 25 points will be added to the 46 points already awarded for a H6 grade i.e. Higher Level Mathematics now carries a points score of 71 for this applicant.\nChanges to the points system can be found at the [http://www.cao.ie Central Applications Office].\nSee also\n* Junior Certificate\n* Leaving Certificate\n* Central Applications Office\n* Education in the Republic of Ireland\n* Grading in education\nReferences"
