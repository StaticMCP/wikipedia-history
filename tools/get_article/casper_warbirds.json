The Warbirds play their home games at Casper Ice Arena in Casper, Wyoming.\nHistory\nDespite the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the USPHL added the Provo Riverblades as an expansion franchise in the summer of 2020. The team began play in the Premier (Tier III) division and played three largely unsuccessful seasons. After their second year, the club was rebranded as the 'Provo Predators' and, one year later, they were promoted to the NCDC (Tier II) division along with five other western teams.\nJust as the Predators were able to find their stride, the franchise was sold. The team moved to Casper, Wyoming and became the Warbirds.\nSeason-by-season records\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Season !! GP !! W !! L !! OTL !! SOL !! Pts !! GF !!
