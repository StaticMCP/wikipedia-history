He joined the surviving members of the Catholic League including 400 horse and 1,000 foot soldiers, led by Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne. They besieged and took Vesoul. Velasco and Mayenne then advanced toward Dijon intending to relieve the besieged city. Henry IV, hearing of their movements, quickly assembled 3,000 troops and hastened to Troyes.\nThe battle\nOn 5 June, Henry narrowly avoided death near Fontaine-Francaise when he ran into a large contingent of Spanish horsemen, while conducting reconnaissance with 1,200 cavalry and 600 mounted arquebusier. Henry charged right away and, after an intense struggle, was able make his escape. The king then gathered his soldiers and the local peasantry on a hill, arming them with scythes and any other metal object that would catch sunlight, thus attempting to make his opponents believe he had a larger army. Fernández de Velasco, seeing reconnaissance forces rejoining Henry's main force, became convinced that Henry's forces had superior numbers, and decided to retreat.\nAftermath\nThe French royal victory marked an end to the Catholic League, although the Wars of Religion would not come to a complete end until the signing of the Peace of Vervins on 2 May 1598, under which the Spanish ceded their remaining captured French towns.\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
