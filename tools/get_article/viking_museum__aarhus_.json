It is located at Sankt Clemens Torv (square of St. Clement), beneath the Nordea bank building. The Viking Museum is administered by the Moesgård Museum and financed by both Aarhus Municipality and Nordea.\nHistory\nThe museum was established in 1968, after archaeologists from the Moesgård Museum had excavated the site in 1963-1964 in connection with the construction of an office building.  The museum underwent a renovation in 2008.\nThe Viking Museum is in situ, ie. situated upon the very site of the archaeological excavations it exhibits. The excavations conducted in the 1960s,  below street level, revealed various Viking Age structures, items, and parts of a human skeleton. The museum provides information regarding the history of Viking Age Aarhus in general and also features copies of items on display at the much larger Moesgaard Museum to the south of Aarhus.\nGallery\nFile:Vikingemuseet 01.JPG|Viking Era display at Vikingemuseet\nFile:Vikingemuseet 4.JPG|Display of everyday items\nFile:Model of viking age Aarhus 05.JPG|Scale model of Aarhus in the Viking Age\nFile:Vikingemuseet 02.JPG|Viking Age runestone\nSee also\n*Viking Ship Museum (Roskilde)\n*Viking Ship Museum (Oslo)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150604063525/http://www.moesgaardmuseum.dk/vikingemuseet// Viking Museum website] Moesgård Museum"
