Pontypool and Usk in South Wales made a reputation for tôle imitating Japanese lacquer starting in the early 19th century.Segal, Troy \"Three types of toleware\"\nIn American collectibles and antiques, toleware refers to kitchen-related objects created from metal, typically tin or thin steel, and are often in decorative styles such as Arts and Crafts and Pennsylvania Dutch.  Decorative painting on these items is common but not necessary.  This style of decorative art spread from Europe to the United States in the 18th century, and was popular in US kitchens in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nIn the field of handicrafts, tole painting on metal objects is a popular amateur pastime.\nToleware was featured on a United States Postal Service 1979 15-cent stamp, and in 2002 as part of the American Design Make-up stamp series with a value of 5 cents.\nReferences"
