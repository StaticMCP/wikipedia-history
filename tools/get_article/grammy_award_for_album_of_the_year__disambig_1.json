A list of the top twenty records was given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who then selected the top five records to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot. The rest of the members then voted on a winner from the five nominees. In 2018, it was announced the number of nominated albums would be increased to eight. In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for album of the year would be decided by votes from members. Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10. However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. This allowed Taylor Swift's Evermore and Kanye West's Donda to be nominated as they were the albums that received the highest number of votes besides the other eight nominees. As of the 2024 ceremony, the number of nominees has been reduced back to eight.\nWinners and nominees\n1950s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:1.00em; line-height:1.5em;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"30%\" | Album\n! width=\"65\" | Artist(s)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1959\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| The Music from Peter Gunn\n| Henry Mancini\n|-\n| Come Fly with Me\n| Frank Sinatra\n|-\n| Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Irving Berlin Song Book\n| Ella Fitzgerald\n|-\n| Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely\n| Frank Sinatra\n|-\n| Tchaikovsky: Concerto No. 1, In B-Flat Minor, Op.23\n| Van Cliburn\n|-\n|}\n1960s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:1.00em; line-height:1.5em;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"30%\" | Album\n! width=\"25%\" | Artist(s)\n! width=\"40%\" | Production team\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1960\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Come Dance with Me!\n| Frank Sinatra\n|\n|-\n| Belafonte at Carnegie Hall\n| Harry Belafonte\n|\n|-\n| More Music From Peter Gunn\n| Henry Mancini\n|\n|-\n| Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3\n| Van Cliburn\n|\n|-\n| Victory at Sea, Vol. I\n| Robert Russell Bennett\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1961\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart\n| Bob Newhart\n|\n|-\n| Belafonte Returns to Carnegie Hall\n| Harry Belafonte\n|\n|-\n| Brahms: Concerto\n| Sviatoslav Richter\n|\n|-\n| ''Nice 'n' Easy\n| Frank Sinatra\n|\n|-\n| Puccini: Turandot\n| Erich Leinsdorf\n|\n|-\n| Wild Is Love\n| Nat King Cole\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1962\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Judy at Carnegie Hall\n| Judy Garland\n|\n|-\n| Breakfast at Tiffany's\n| Henry Mancini\n|\n|-\n| Genius + Soul = Jazz\n| Ray Charles\n|\n|-\n| Great Band with Great Voices\n| Si Zentner & Johnny Mann Singers\n|\n|-\n| The Nat King Cole Story\n| Nat King Cole\n|\n|-\n| West Side Story (Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| John Green\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1963\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| The First Family\n| Vaughn Meader\n|\n|-\n| I Left My Heart in San Francisco\n| Tony Bennett\n|\n|-\n| Jazz Samba\n| Stan Getz & Charlie Byrd\n|\n|-\n| Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\n| Ray Charles\n|\n|-\n| My Son, the Folk Singer\n| Allan Sherman\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1964\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| The Barbra Streisand Album\n| Barbra Streisand\n|\n|-\n| Bach's Greatest Hits\n| Ward Swingle & The Swingle Singers\n|\n|-\n| Days of Wine and Roses and Other TV Requests\n| Andy Williams\n|\n|-\n| Honey in the Horn\n| Al Hirt\n|\n|-\n| The Singing Nun\n| Soeur Sourire\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1965\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Getz/Gilberto\n| Stan Getz & João Gilberto\n|\n|-\n| Cotton Candy\n| Al Hirt\n|\n|-\n| Funny Girl\n| Various Artists\n| Bob Merrill & Jule Styne, composers\n|-\n| People\n| Barbra Streisand\n|\n|-\n| The Pink Panther\n| Henry Mancini\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1966\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| September of My Years\n| Frank Sinatra\n| Sonny Burke, producer\n|-\n| Help!\n| The Beatles\n| George Martin, producer\n|-\n| My Name Is Barbra\n| Barbra Streisand\n| Bob Mersey, producer\n|-\n| My World\n| Eddy Arnold\n| Chet Atkins, producer\n|-\n| The Sound Of Music (Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| Various Artists\n| Julie Andrews, featured artist; Neely Plumb, producer\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1967\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| A Man and His Music\n| Frank Sinatra\n| Sonny Burke, producer\n|-\n| Color Me Barbra\n| Barbra Streisand\n| Bob Mersey, producer\n|-\n| Doctor Zhivago (Original Soundtrack)\n| Maurice Jarre\n| Jesse Kaye, producer\n|-\n| Revolver\n| The Beatles\n| George Martin, producer\n|-\n| What Now My Love\n| Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass\n| Herb Alpert & Jerry Moss, producers\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1968\n|-style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| '''Sgt.
