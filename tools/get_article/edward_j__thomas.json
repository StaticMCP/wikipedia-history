Thomas\n\nEdward Joseph Thomas (30 July 1869 – 11 February 1958) was an English classicist, librarian and author of several books on the history of Buddhism.\nBiography\nThomas was born in Thornhill, West Yorkshire. He was the son of a gardener at Thornhill Rectory. Thomas left school and worked as a gardener for twelve years. In 1896, he enrolled and under the supervision of John Burnet obtained a master's degree in classics from the University of St Andrews in 1900-1901. He studied linguistics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1905. He was the curator of the university's library for many years and was appointed Dean of the Oriental Languages Department.\nHis works, mainly concerned with Theravada Buddhism and reflecting Western scholarship, nonetheless remain widely cited for their clarity and accuracy. The Life of Buddha as Legend and History is inevitably cited in Buddhist research. Thomas's ability as a Pali scholar and translator was noted in his time.\nThomas has been described as \"one of England’s most brilliant Buddhist scholars\".\nPublications\n* [https://archive.org/details/jatakatales00fran Jataka Tales] (1916) [with Henry Thomas Francis]\n* [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001923509 The Life of Buddha: As Legend and History] (1927, 3rd. ed. 1952)\n* The Perfection of Wisdom, The Career of the Predestined Buddhas, A Selection of Mahayana Scriptures translated from the Sanskrit (London, J.
