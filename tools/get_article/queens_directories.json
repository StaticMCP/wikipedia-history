In 1898, 30% of the western part of the old Queens County was absorbed into New York City. Before 1898, Nassau County covered the eastern 70% of the old Queens County. The older, larger Queens County was mostly agricultural, and within it were several towns, villages, and hamlets. In the mid- to late-19th century, cemeteries constituted one of the larger industries in Queens, Kings (Brooklyn), and Westchester (north of The Bronx) Counties. As of 1898, Queens County, New York, and the Borough of Queens, New York City, geographically, have been the same. Both Queens and Brooklyn are on Long Island.

Long Island was known as \"Nassau Island\" during the Colonial Dutch era, and later, the \"Island of Stirling\" after the Earl of Stirling (c. 1567–1640) acquired it, with other lands in North America exceeding ten million acres in 1621 and 1625 from Charles I. However, The Duke of York (who became James II), bought back the land for seven thousand pounds, but failed to pay the debt to Charles I. Ownership, namely for Long Island, reverted to the Earl of Stirling, although, the Plymouth Colony claimed it. King Charles, on April 22, 1636, instructed the Plymouth Colony to give Long Island to the Earl of Stirling. On April 20, 1637, the Earl of Stirling gave James Farret power of attorney to sell his land on Long Island. In 1641, James Farret, on behalf of the Stirling Estate, sold most of the eastern portion to the New Haven and Connecticut Colonies. (see Robins Island) Farret was allowed to choose 12,000 acres (49 km2) for his personal use. He chose Shelter Island.

The name changed to Hastings when the British took over New Netherland in 1664, then New Towne (Newtown) in 1665. In 1896, two years before Queens County was incorporated into the Greater City of New York, the town was renamed Elmhurst. The namechange was influenced by Cord J. Meyer (1854–1910), who owned and developed real estate in the village.\n|-\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|1683:\n|width=\"15%\" style=\"text-align:left\"| Province of New York\n|width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 1px darkgray; border-style: none none solid none;\"| On November 1, 1683, the British colony of New York – aka Province of New York – was organized as twelve counties.

These were used for the election of various municipal offices, and would later be used to define the boundaries of larger electoral districts. Prior to the formation of the so-called City of Greater New York in 1898, what is now New York City comprised multiple municipalities that had different histories with wards. (see Wards of New York City)\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" | 1785\n| width=\"15%\" | New-York Manumission Society\n| width=\"80%\" | The New-York Manumission Society, an abolitionist advocacy group, was founded in 1785. New York State, on February 22, 1788, passed \"An Act Concerning Slaves,\" that authorized a slave owner to free any slave in a procedure called \"manumit.\" The procedure required the owner to procure from the Overseers of the Poor a certificate certifying that the slave is under the age of fifty years, and of sufficient ability to provide for themself, and the certificate shall be registered in the Clerks office of the town.\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" | 1799\n| width=\"15%\" | Gradual Emancipation Act of New York\n| width=\"80%\" | New York, in 1799, passed a Gradual Emancipation Act, a law that freed no living slave; but after the date of passage, children born to slave mothers were required to work for the mother's master as indentured servants until age 28 (men) and 25 (women). The last slaves were freed of this obligation on July 4, 1827 – 28 years after 1799. African Americans celebrated with a parade. (see History of slavery in New York & ).\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" | 1836:\n| width=\"15%\" | College Point\n| width=\"80%\" | In 1836, about 33 years before being incorporated as College Point, Rev. William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796–1877), an Episcopal Priest, began working to establish St. Paul's College and Grammar School to train priests. The college opened in 1839 and closed in 1847. Before 1836, William Lawrence (1622–1680), a slave owner, had owned nearly 900 acres – all of Tew's Neck – as grantee of a patent from the Dutch in 1645. Tew's Neck had been named for Michael Tew, the first settler. Eliphalet Stratton (1745–1831), in 1789, purchased 320 acres from the descendants of William Lawrence and established the village of Strattonport. In 1851, one of Stratton's daughters, as trustee, sold 141 acres – south of 15th Avenue – to real estate developers John A. Flammer (related to John G. Flammer; né Johann Gottlieb Flammer; 1807–1886) and Peter W. Longley, who established Flammersburg. Stratton's daughter retained the balance of one hundred and eighty acres for the Stratton family. Flammer and Longley subdivided the property into 80 building lots. By 1856, the three subdivisions – Strattonport, Flammersburg, and College Point – were commonly referred to as College Point. College Point was incorporated in 1867 or 1870. At the time, because many residents had immigrated from Germany, College Point was sometimes referred to as the \"Little Heidelberg\". Flammer was one of the original directors of the Third Avenue Railway and, in 1869, one of the original incorporators of The West Side Bank at 464 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" | 1837:\n| width=\"15%\" | Panic of 1837\n| width=\"80%\" |\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" | 1837:\n| width=\"15%\" | Village of Flushing\n| width=\"80%\" | Village of Flushing was incorporated on April 15, 1837.\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" |1861–1865:\n| width=\"15%\" | Civil War\n| width=\"80%\" | No major battle occurred on Long Island during the Civil War.

Blissville also included Francis Duryea's farm. One of Neziah Bliss' sons, Archibald Meserole Bliss (1836–1923), became a U.S. Congressman.\n|-\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|1870:\n|width=\"15%\" style=\"text-align:left\"| Long Island City\n|width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 1px darkgray; border-style: none none solid none;\"| Captain Levy Hayden, superintendent of a marine railway formerly at Hunters Point, predicted, as early as 1853, that the area around Hunters Point would become a city. He even proposed that it be named \"Long Island City.\" Thomas H. Todd (1835–1901), who, on October 20, 1865, published the first issue a newspaper bearing the name The Long Island City Star. Long Island City, on May 4, 1870, incorporated as a city from the merger of the Village of Astoria and the hamlets of Ravenswood, Hunters Point, Blissville, Sunnyside, Dutch Kills, Steinway, Bowery Bay, and Middleton – all separating from the Town of Newtown. At the time of its incorporation, Long Island City had between 12,000 and 15,000 residents. When it consolidated with New York City in 1898, it was  old.\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" |1882:\n| width=\"15%\" | Ozone Park\n| width=\"80%\" | As in \"fresh air,\" not \"ozone layer.\" Benjamin W.

It was known as the \"Coney Island of Queens.\"\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" |1889:\n| width=\"15%\" | Murray Hill\n| width=\"80%\" | Murray Hill in Queens, geologically, has no hill. Albeit, its namesake is from William King Murray (1839–1918), a Flushing horticulturist and nurseryman who, with Robert Bowne Parsons (1821–1898) (also a horticulturalist and nurseryman), sold property in the late 1880s to a real estate development firm headed by Frederick William Dunton (1851–1931). Dunton, by way of his mother, Lois Dunton (née Corbin; 1819–1893), was a nephew of Austin Corbin (1827–1996), President of the LIRR from 1881 until his death. On November 2, 1898, Robert Bowne Parsons was struck and killed instantly by a westbound LIRR train at Newtown while attempting to cross the track to catch a departing eastbound train home to Flushing. The original Murray Hill neighborhood in Manhattan is the namesake of Robert Murray (1721–1786), a New York City merchant and shipping tycoon and wife, Mary Lindley (maiden; 1726–1782). William King Murray, by way of his mother, Mary Ann King Murray (née Mary Ann King; 1790–1872), was a nephew of Joseph Harris King (1811–1887), who was married to Anna Lawrence Bloodgood (1810–1843), daughter of James Bloodgood (1781–1826),(\"Inscriptions\" → St. George's Episcopal Church Yard, Vol. 4. 1912. p.&nbsp;85. → ) a widely-known horticulturist and nurseryman from Flushing.\n|-\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|1890:\n|width=\"15%\" style=\"text-align:left\"| Trow Settlement\n|width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left\"|John Libby was, in 1890, one of the four buyers of the block between 28th and 29th Streets and 14th and 15th Avenues in Beechhurst.

The rest of Hempstead and the Towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay split from Queens County to form Nassau County in 1899. Prior to consolidation, Lloyd Neck, which was then part of the Town of Oyster Bay and had earlier been known as Queens Village, seceded from Queens County and became part of the Town of Huntington in Suffolk County in 1885.\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable static-row-numbers\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"color: black; background-color: #FFFFFF; font-size:90%; width:100%; text-align:left;\"\n|- class=\"static-row-header\" style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom;\"\n! style=\"text-align:left; background:#eaecf0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\" colspan=2\" | Selected name origins\n|- class=\"static-row-header\" style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom;border-style: solid; border-color: #008200; border-width: 10px 0px 0px 0px;\"\n!

Willets, in 1901, sold it to the New England Development Company (New England Development & Improvement Company), a syndicate of East Coast investors that developed several residential projects in the Eastern U.S. The company subdivided Willets' farm into lots and streets and renamed it Auburndale. The LIRR opened a station there in May 1901 and named it Auburndale Station. The original Auburndale station was moved and converted into a church that survived until 1973. The name comes from Auburndale, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and home of Lewis Henry Green (1868–1941), who then was President of the company.\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" | 1909:\n| width=\"15%\" | Jackson Heights\n| width=\"80%\" | Jackson Heights, until 1909, was known as Trains Meadow.\n|-\n| width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\" | 1925:\n| width=\"15%\" | Rego Park\n| width=\"80%\" | Rego Park and Middle Village was settled by Dutch farmers in 1653 as Whitepot, then part of Newtown. \"Rego\" is a portmanteau of \"Real Good Construction Company\" that began developing the area in 1925.\n|-\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|1970:\n| width=\"15%\" | Flushing\n|width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:left; border: 1px darkgray; border-style: none none solid none;\"| Flushing is host to one of three large Asian American communities in the New York City. The other two are Chinatown on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and Sunset Park in Brooklyn. Outside of New York City, but within its metropolitan area, Bergen County, New Jersey – on the other side of Manhattan, just across the Hudson River – has the second largest concentration, per capita, of Asian Americans in New Jersey. Manhattan's Chinatown, the city's oldest Asian American neighborhood, began to flourish around 1870. Flushing, the second oldest, began to flourish in the 1970s, with the first wave of immigrants from Taiwan. Sunset Park, the newest in Queens, began to flourish as an Asian community in 1990.\nThe city is home to about twelve Asian communities, including one in Corona, one in Whitestone, and one in Eastern Queens. Other city neighborhoods with emerging Asian communities include East Harlem, Manhattan. Outside of New York City, but within the city's metropolitan area, Edison, New Jersey, has a sizable Asian community.\nBensonhurst, Brooklyn, is reputed to have the largest China-born population in New York City, but the neighborhood is not so densely populated as the Asian neighborhoods of those of Manhattan, Flushing, and Sunset Park.\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible static-row-numbers\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"color: black; background-color: #FFFFFF; font-size: 90%; width:100%;\"\n|- class=\"static-row-header\" style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom;\"\n! style=\"text-align:left; background:#eaecf0; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 0px\" colspan=2 | Printers, publishers, and compilers of Queens directories\n|-style=\"border-style: solid; border-color: #bfaea6; border-width: 10px 0px 0px 0px;\"\n|-\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"5%\" style=\"text-align:right\"|1791–1795:\n|width=\"95%\" style=\"text-align:left\"|The New-York Directory and Register published – William Duncan (–1795) (compiler); John McComb (1763–1853) (cartographer); Cornelius Tiebout (1777–1832) (engraver); T. & J.

In July 1872, the State of New York, on behalf of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), for $26,250 (), purchased 70 acres of level land from Creed, and, on June 21, 1873, opened an outdoor firing range with assistance of (i) the U.S. War Department (Army Corps of Engineers), (ii) the State of New York under the auspices of the New York Army National Guard, and (iii) the City of New York. Its name was selected by newspaper man, Col. Henry G. Shaw ( Henry Glenville Shaw; 1843–1907). He initially named it Creed's Moor, a geographical reference, and the name eventually became Creedmoor Rifle Range. The Central Railroad of Long Island – on a line that ran from Long Island City to Bethpage – opened its Creedmoor branch January 8, 1873. Creedmoor's international match, first held in 1874, was the forerunner of the Palma trophy competition. In 1892, as a result of declining public interest and mounting noise complaints from the growing neighborhood, the NRA deeded its land back to the state. In 1908, the State Legislature dedicated the land for use by the Long Island State Hospital. In 1912, the property became the Farm Colony of Brooklyn State Hospital, which eventually became the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, located south of the interchange of Grand Central and the Cross Island Parkways.
