A remarkable number—writers especially—volunteered as ambulance drivers for the Allied Powers. In many cases, they sympathized strongly with the ideals of the Allied Powers, but did not want, or were too young or old, to participate in a combat role. For women, combat was not an option at the time. Several of the Americans on the list volunteered before the United States' 1917 entry into the war. Many of the American writers would later be associated with the Lost Generation.\nBusinessmen\n*Tony Hulman – American businessman, owner and operator of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and volunteer with the American Red Cross Motor Corps\n*Ray Kroc – American entrepreneur of McDonald's Corporation fame – trained to become an ambulance driver, though the war ended before he saw action\nComposers\n*Maurice Ravel – volunteer ambulance driver or truck driver\n*Albert Roussel – Red Cross transport driver\nFilmmakers\n*Julien Bryan – combat photographer, filmmaker and documentarian who volunteered with the American Field Service for the French Army in World War I, driving an ambulance in Verdun and the Argonne, and subsequently wrote a book Ambulance 464 about his experience illustrated with his photographs.\n*René Clair – served as an ambulance driver in WWI before being invalided out for a spinal injury.
