His mother, Maria Mackenzie (bef. 1751 &ndash; 29 January 1826), was parental granddaughter of William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth and maternal one of Alexander Stewart, 6th Earl of Galloway. From 1781 to 1786, Howard was a Page of Honour to George III.\nMilitary career\n'' by George Jones. Effingham played a ceremonial role during George IV's Coronation in 1821.]]\nHoward was gazetted to an ensigncy in the Coldstream Guards, 21 April 1786, and served with his regiment in Flanders from February 1793 to May 1795, being wounded at St. Amand 8 May 1793. He was promoted lieutenant and captain 25 April 1793 (acting as adjutant of his regiment from December 1793 to December 1797), captain-lieutenant and lieutenant-colonel 30 December 1797, and brigade-major to the foot-guards 17 April 1798, in which capacity he served throughout the Irish rebellion of that year and the Duke of York's expedition to Holland in 1799. He was present in every action of the last-named campaign. He was gazetted captain and lieutenant-colonel 25 July 1799, and was connected with the foreign troops in the English service as deputy inspector-general, inspector-general, and commandant of the foreign depôt. This latter office he resigned on being appointed colonel and aide-de-camp to the king, 1 January 1805. He became second major of his regiment 4 August 1808, and major-general 25 July 1810.\nIn January 1811 Howard joined the army in the Peninsula, being placed in command of a brigade of the 1st Division in succession to Sir William Erskine (Wellington Supplementary Despatches, xiii. 544). In the following July, he was transferred to the 2nd Division, as second-in-command under Lord Hill till August 1812. In November of that year, he was selected to command the 1st brigade of guards in the 1st Division, and was in entire command of that division under Sir John Hope from June 1813 to the end of the war. He was present at the battles of Fuentes de Oñoro, Arroyo de Molinos, and Almaraz, and was on the two latter occasions specially commended for gallantry in Lord Hill's despatches (Wellington Despatches, viii. 381–3, 388, ix. 184–5), and was thanked by the home government (Sidney, Life of Lord Hill, pp.&nbsp;199–200). He took continuous part in the operations on the frontier, 1813–14, and received the medal and one clasp for Vitoria and the passage of the Nive. On the conclusion of the war he became Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth and General Officer Commanding South-West District. The duties of this post prevented his joining the army in Belgium, but after Waterloo he was placed in command of the 1st Division of the British Army during the occupation of France, with the local rank of lieutenant-general.\nHoward succeeded his third cousin Richard Howard, 4th Earl of Effingham as 11th Baron Howard of Effingham in 1816. In 1837 he was created Earl of Effingham.\nFamily\nLord Effingham married Lady Charlotte Primrose (c. 1776 &ndash; 17 September 1864), daughter of Neil Primrose, 3rd Earl of Rosebery, on 27 May 1800, by whom he had five children:\n* Lady Charlotte Howard (30 October 1803 &ndash; 8 March 1886).\n* Henry Howard, 2nd Earl of Effingham.\n* Charles Howard (6 December 1807 &ndash; 8 March 1882).\n* Lady Arabella Georgina Howard (25 January 1809 &ndash; 10 December 1884), married Francis Baring, 1st Baron Northbrook (as his second wife).\n* Reverend Hon.
