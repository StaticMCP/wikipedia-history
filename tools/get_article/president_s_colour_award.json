It is also known as Nishaan'', which is an emblem that is worn by all unit officers on the left-hand sleeve of their uniform.\nThe presentation of the award or standards by the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of India (President of India) is an acknowledgement of the unit's meritorious service. While the practice of carrying the Colour into battle has stopped, the tradition of receiving, holding and parading the Colour continues even today in the Armed forces. To this day, the President's Colours is very significant, if the unit lose their colours, it is a disgrace for that unit and, if the unit captured the enemy's colours then it is a great honour for that unit.\nThe 'Standards' are awarded to Heavy Cavalry and the 'Guidons' are awarded to Light Cavalry.\nHistory\nIn military organizations, the practice of carrying colours, standards or guidons, both to act as a rallying point for troops and to mark the location of the commander, is thought to have originated in Egypt some about 5,000 years ago.\nIn Indian context, 'Colours or Standards' are also known as 'Dhwajs or Patakas'. The concept of dhwajs has also roots in the 'Vedas' and 'Puranas'. The armies of the king or emperor were also carries the 'Dhwajs'. If the army lost its dhwaj to the hands of enemy, then it means disgrace and if the army capture the dhwaj of the enemy, then it means an honour. If the army accept the dhwajs of the King/Emperor, then it means that the army has accepted the supremacy of that King/Emperor.\nIn regiments of infantry of British Army and other armies of commonwealth nations, each battalion carries two colours, which collectively are called as stand. These are large flags 36in × 45in and mounted on a pike which is 8ft7½ in long; the king's/queen's version is usually the version of country's national flag, often trimmed with gold fabric, and with the regiment's insignia placed in the centre. The Regimental colour is a flag of a single colour, usually the colour of the uniform facing (collar/lapels/cuffs) of the regiment, again often trimmed and with the insignia in the centre. Most of the regiments that are designated as 'royal' regiments (that is either have the word 'Royal' or have the sponsorship of a royal personage in their name) have a navy blue colour Regimental Colour. Irish Regiments, today the Royal Irish Regiment, have a dark green Regimental Colour.\nWith East India Company coming under the control of the English, the regiments in India started as carrying colours of the British Crown. Later, it became the President's Colours.\nIndia became a republic on 26 January 1950. One day earlier on 25 January, all 33 of the King's Colours which had been presented to the Indian Army, Royal Indian Navy, Royal Indian Air Force and their respective commands were \"laid up\" at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun. From, 26 January 1950 onwards, the use of the prefix 'Royal' was discontinued. Later, they became the colours of the President of Republic of India.\nOn 27 February 1951, the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Navy, Vice Admiral Sir Edward Parry, wrote to the defence minister Baldev Singh: \"As you know that India became a Republic, Naval Custom was to parade the King's Colours ashore on the special ceremonial occasions. On and after 26 January 1950, however this practice was ceased and the ordinary Naval Ensign has been paraded instead. It would be a privilege of which the service would be extremely proud if the President of India would honour the Indian Navy by presenting to it a special flag which would be paraded on important occasions in the same manner as the King's Colours used to be.\"\nFollowing the British tradition of the Navy being the senior of the three branches of the Indian Armed Forces, the Indian Navy was the first to presented with the President's Colours on 27 May 1951. In the years that followed, as the Navy grew in size and the function, President's Colours were presented to the Naval Commands and the Fleets.\nThe President's Colours/Standard/Guidon is one of the greatest honours bestowed upon in recognition of exceptional service rendered by it to the nation, both during war and peace.\nDesign of the Colour\nArmy Unit Presidential Colour\nThe President's Colours of Indian Army infantry battalions (both regular line and rifle and scout infantry) follow the format of the line infantry regimental colours of the armies of the Commonwealth (and the King's/Queen's Colours of the Foot Guards of the British Army, in the case of the Brigade of the Guards). Each Colour is gold fringed and is brought out on major ceremonies. In the center, the heraldic badge and distinctive unit insignia of the reporting regiment is stationed, surrounded by wreaths in which the battalion motto can be seen. On the sides of the colour, which is in the facing colour of the regiment, are the recognized battle honours won by the battalion and the whole of the regiment. Some battle honours of the regiments of line, light and rifle infantry, granted prior to independence to units for battles or campaigns in India against the local rulers or nationalist forces, have been declared as 'repugnant' and are not celebrated or held in esteem, and as in the case of the President's Colours, are not displayed. The recognized battle honours are displayed on gold scrolls that surround the unit badge. Unlike the British Army, which does not have colours for the light infantry and rifle regiments, the Indian Army also has President's Colours present in some of these units (following the Russian precedent adopted after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War), with the first light infantry battalion colour being presented in 1968. These colours follow a similar design to that of the line infantry. The regimental centre colour, regardless of regiment, follows the same design as the battalion colour but with the heraldic arms of the regiment, and carries all the recognized battle honors of that regiment and the regimental motto instead of the battalion's.\nThe same design of colours is used by the combat and service support formations of the Army with the service or unit badge, motto and the battle honours.\nArmy Unit President's Standard/Guidon\nThe President's Standards and Guidons of Indian Army armoured and cavalry formations of the Indian Army Armoured Corps, smaller than the colours of the Infantry, have a similar design. All have gold fringe surrounding them, and the unit badge and its motto at the centre of it, surrounded by the recognized battle honors of the unit, all in the facing colour of the unit. The same case for repugnant honours goes for all of these formations of the Armoured Corps. The Standard of the Armoured Corps Centre carries all the Armoured Corps' recognized battle honours.\nUnits awarded the President's Standard have a design similar to the heavy cavalry regiments of the Commonwealth. Units however granted with the President's Guidon carry a similar design to those of the light cavalry regimental guidons, which are swallow-tailed.\nNavy President's Colour\nIt was the Indian Navy that was the first branch of the Armed Forces to receive the President's Colour in May 1951, one year after India became a republic of the Commonwealth. This colour, the President's Colour of the Navy, is the basis of the President's colours of all commands and services of the Navy. It is also awarded to ground naval bases and, as the President's Standard, to all naval combat and service support formations.\nSimilar to the case of the Royal Navy, all colours share the identical design of the President's Colour, which in turn, is based on the former design of the Indian Naval Ensign. Unlike the RN Ensign the old design was unique that it has a golden elephant, symbol of the nation, on the bottom left side of the colour. It as always been in white and fringed in gold, with the national flag on the canton with the St. George's Cross, symbolizing the roots of the Navy in the Royal Indian Marine, with the State Emblem of India at the center, in gold, under which, written in Devanagari script, is the national motto Satyameva Jayate (Truth Alone Triumphs). There are no battle honours in the President's Colours unlike those in the other services.\nIn 2022 a new design of the President's Colours and Standards for the Navy and all naval commands, services and bases and formations was released to replace the old design. It retains much the design of the 2001-04 ensign and the gold fringe, but instead of the arms of that emblem, its feature on the fly is a octagonal navy blue shield—the official new heraldic emblem of the force—based on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's's royal seal surrounding the heraldic arms in gold, which also corrects a long omission from that ensign as well—the addition of, in Devanagari, the official motto of the Navy—May the Lord of Waters Be Auspicious Unto Us (Shaṁ No Varunaḥ). The shield is also gold fringed with two gold borders. The octagon represents the Navy's missions of national maritime defense and its multi-directional reach. The new design of the arms is the State Emblem atop a clear anchor in gold. Atop the emblem is the State Emblem and the national motto from the old design.\nAir Force President's Colour/Standard\nAll Indian Air Force air combat and combat support formations carry the President's Standard, which is in sky blue with the squadron or helicopter unit heraldic arms with the recognized battle honours given to these formations similar to those of the Army. Since it was established in 1932, there are no repugnant battle honours in these Standards, as the battle honours for these formations date beginning to the Second World War, the force's baptism of fire, and onwards.\nThe President's Colour is carried by Indian Air Force service support, education and training institutions and it uses the same design as in the President's Standard. It is also carried by air base and air station personnel and carries the same battle honours.\nThe Air Force itself has its own President's Colour—a gold fringed version of the official service ensign with the gold elephant on top of the air force roundel.\nThe ceremony of presentation of colours\nThe formation for the ceremonial parade is a battalion-sized (100–500 soldiers) formation of military units of an armed forces formation (from either the navy, army and air force) or a law enforcement formation. Four to eight companies is the usual size of the parade and a military band combined with a pipe band providing the ceremonial music is present. The parade commander, the Field Officer holding the rank of a major or lieutenant colonel (commander or lieutenant commander in the navy, wing commander or squadron leader in the air force), takes his place in the center of the parade field, assisted by the Second-in-Command and the Parade Adjutant. All wear full dress uniform.\nThe President of India, the ceremony's guest of honour, arrives as the parade renders a full National Salute as the National Anthem Jana Gana Mana is played by the band and a 21-gun salute is fired (occasionally by the Indian Army Regiment of Artillery). After the anthem, the parade is inspected, as the band plays a slow march. If any old colours are present, they are marched out of the field for the final time as the new colours of the unit are about to replace these colours, and the parade renders a salute as the audience in the grandstand stands in respect and the President, together with the service chiefs, salutes it one final time.\nThen, the Sarvadharma Samaroh begins. A drum altar had been formed by members of the band and the unit pipe band, and the new colour, which had already been removed of its cloth case, is brought there by the quartermaster of the unit. Afterwards, the Nishaan is consecrated by military chaplains of religions represented in the Armed Forces (Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam). Then, the President's Colour is received by an officer designated as Nishan Adhikari on behalf of the military or police unit (in question) during the parade by the President or any other designated person on behalf of him or her, who serves as the unit ensign (holding rank of lieutenant in the Army, sublieutenant in the Navy and flying officer in the Air Force). Then, the ceremony ends with the National Anthem as the colour is marched into the parade formation, which salutes the colour.  The drummers then return to their places in the band. Following that, the battalion marches past in quick time with the new colours before returning to their places. (If in the Navy, the Colour is dipped in the President's presence while marching past, and is recovered after passing the grandstand). If the parade marches past in slow time before the quick march segment the same pattern is observe with the sole exception of the Navy's colour which is also dipped in a slow time march.\nWith this portion being complete, the President or delegated reviewing officer will briefly address the regiment of which he/she presented the colours to, which will be concluded with the speaker expressing confidence in the unit, before that the unit commander makes his address of gratitude thanking the reviewing officer for their words and for their presence in the ceremony. After that, an Advance in Review Order is done, and one final National Salute is rendered. After the final salute, the battalion, together with the band and pipes and drums, marches off in quick time, and the colour guard squad marches off the field.\nFor Indian Armed Forces if the President is absent\nIn the absence of the President of India, the Vice President of India does not present colours to regiments, ships or air squadrons. The responsibility of being the guest of honour in his or her absence is prerogative of the Services Chiefs and as such, a General Salute is performed as the band plays appropriate music.\nFor federal and state police forces and organizations if the President is absent\nWhen the president is absent, the federal Minister of Home Affairs or at times the Vice President or Prime Minister serves as delegate in any colour presentation ceremony to federal and/or state police forces. As such, a General Salute is performed by the parade assembled as the band plays appropriate music unless the National Anthem is played in the Vice President's presence.\nSalutes are also given in a presentation ceremony to state governors who are acting on behalf of the President and in the name of their state governments.\nPresident's Colours awarded to the State and UT Police Forces\n{| class=wikitable\n|+List of President's Colours awarded to the State and UT Police Forces\n!Sr no.\n!Police\n!Date and place\n!Awarded by\n!Info\n|-\n|1\n|Uttar Pradesh Police\n|23 November 1952, at Lucknow\n|Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru\n|UP Police celebrates the flag day every year on 23 November.\n|-\n|2\n|Delhi Police\n|1954, at Delhi\n|President Dr. Rajendra Prasad\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Maharashtra Police\n|1961, at Mumbai\n|Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru\n|\n|-\n|4\n|Jammu and Kashmir Police\n|26 June 2003, at Udhampur\n|President A.
