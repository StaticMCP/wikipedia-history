The league imposed a 22-game suspension in 1928 after he was reported for 'kicking' and he subsequently missed the entire 1929 season. He later played with and coached Footscray District Football League club Kingsville.\nReferences\n*\n*\n*Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007). The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers. 7th ed.
