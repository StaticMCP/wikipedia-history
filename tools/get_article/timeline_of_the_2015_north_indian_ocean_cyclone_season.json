Despite inactivity in the Bay of Bengal caused by the ongoing El Niño, the season produced an above-average number of tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea. The first storm of the season, Ashobaa, formed on 7 June, while the final storm of the season, Megh, ultimately dissipated on 10 November.\nA total of twelve depressions were recorded, of which nine intensified into deep depressions. Of these nine, a total of four further strengthened into cyclonic storms, while two attained their peaks as extremely severe cyclonic storms. In early June, Cyclonic Storm Ashobaa produced significant flooding in eastern Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Later that month, Deep Depression ARB 02 resulted in the worst floods in the Amreli district of Gujarat in 90 years. The storm resulted in 80 deaths and an estimated 16.5 billion Indian rupees in damage in the state. In late July and early August, Cyclonic Storm Komen resulted in between 187 and 280 deaths in northeastern India, Bangladesh and Myanmar due to torrential rains as it slowly moved through the region. In early November, Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Chapala, the strongest storm of the season, became the first recorded tropical cyclone to produce hurricane-force winds in Yemen. During the storm's passage, areas in southern Yemen received  of rainfall over 48 hours, or 700% of the average yearly precipitation. Just days after Chapala produced widespread damage in Yemen and the Puntland region of Somalia, Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Megh passed through the same region causing further destruction. Megh was judged to have been the worst tropical cyclone ever to affect the Yemeni island of Socotra, and resulted in 18 deaths on the island. The final storm of the season to form, Deep Depression BOB 03, produced significant flooding in southern India and resulted in at least 71 deaths in the region in early November.\nWithin the northern Indian Ocean, tropical cyclones were monitored by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) at the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in New Delhi. The IMD designated tropical cyclones forming in the Arabian Sea with the prefix \"ARB\", tropical cyclones forming in the Bay of Bengal with the prefix \"BOB\" and tropical cyclones forming overland with the prefix \"LAND\". In addition, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued unofficial warnings within the region, with tropical cyclones forming in the Arabian Sea assigned the suffix \"A\" and tropical cyclones forming in the Bay of Bengal assigned the \"B\" suffix. The IMD used the IMD Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale and measured average sustained wind speeds taken over a three-minute period, while the JTWC measured average sustained wind speeds taken over a one-minute period and used the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.\nThis timeline includes information from post-storm reviews by the IMD and the JTWC. It documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthenings, weakenings, landfalls, extratropical transition, and dissipations during the season. Reports among warning centers often differ; therefore, information from both agencies has been included.\nTimeline of events\nImageSize = width:781 height:191\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/06/2015 till:31/12/2015\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/2015\nColors     =\nid:canvas value:gray(0.88)\nid:GP     value:red\nid:TD   value:rgb(0,0.52,0.84)      legend:Depression_(31–50_km/h)\nid:DD     value:rgb(0.43,0.76,0.92)    legend:Deep_Depression_(51–62_km/h)\nid:TS     value:rgb(0.3,1,1)    legend:Cyclonic_Storm_(63–88_km/h)\nid:ST     value:rgb(0.75,1,0.75)        legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(89–117_km/h)\nid:VS     value:rgb(1,0.85,0.55)        legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(118–165_km/h)\nid:ES     value:rgb(1,0.45,0.54)    legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(166–220_km/h)\nid:SU     value:rgb(0.55,0.46,0.9)    legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_(≥221_km/h)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Hurricane\nbar:Month\nPlotData=\nbarset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\nfrom:07/06/2015 till:12/06/2015 color:TS text:Ashobaa (CS)\nfrom:20/06/2015 till:21/06/2015 color:TD text:BOB 01 (D)\nfrom:22/06/2015 till:24/06/2015 color:DD text:ARB 02 (DD)\nfrom:10/07/2015 till:12/07/2015 color:TD text:LAND 01 (D)\nfrom:26/07/2015 till:02/08/2015 color:TS text:Komen (CS)\nfrom:27/07/2015 till:30/07/2015 color:DD text:LAND 02 (DD)\nbarset:break\nfrom:04/08/2015 till:04/08/2015 color:TD text:LAND 03 (D)\nfrom:16/09/2015 till:19/09/2015 color:DD text:LAND 04 (DD)\nfrom:09/10/2015 till:12/10/2015 color:DD text:ARB 03 (DD)\nfrom:28/10/2015 till:04/11/2015 color:ES text:Chapala (ESCS)\nfrom:05/11/2015 till:10/11/2015 color:ES text:Megh (ESCS)\nfrom:08/11/2015 till:10/11/2015 color:DD text:BOB 03 (DD)\nbar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\nfrom:01/06/2015 till:30/06/2015 text:June\nfrom:01/07/2015 till:31/07/2015 text:July\nfrom:01/08/2015 till:31/08/2015 text:August\nfrom:01/09/2015 till:30/09/2015 text:September\nfrom:01/10/2015 till:31/10/2015 text:October\nfrom:01/11/2015 till:30/11/2015 text:November\nfrom:01/12/2015 till:31/12/2015 text:December\nJune\n6&nbsp;June\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reports that Tropical Depression 01A has formed from an area of low pressure while located roughly  northwest of Lakshadweep, India.\n7&nbsp;June\n*03:00&nbsp;UTC (8:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The India Meteorological Department (IMD) designates Tropical Depression 01A as Depression ARB 01 while the system is located roughly  west of Goa.\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The JTWC reports that Tropical Depression ARB 01 (01A) has intensified into a tropical storm while located roughly  west of Goa.\n8&nbsp;June\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The IMD reports that Depression ARB 01 (01A) has intensified into a deep depression while located roughly  west of Porbandar, Gujarat.\n*03:00&nbsp;UTC (8:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The IMD reports that Deep Depression ARB 01 (01A) has intensified into a cyclonic storm and names it \"Ashobaa\" while the system is located roughly  west of Porbandar, Gujarat.\n9&nbsp;June\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The IMD reports that Cyclonic Storm Ashobaa (01A) has reached its peak intensity, with maximum 3-minute sustained wind speeds of , while located roughly  southeast of Muscat, Oman.\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The JTWC reports that Tropical Storm Ashobaa (01A) has reached its peak intensity, with maximum 1-minute sustained wind speeds of , while located roughly  southeast of Muscat, Oman.\n11&nbsp;June\n*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The IMD reports that Cyclonic Storm Ashobaa (01A) has weakened into a deep depression while located roughly  southeast of Muscat, Oman.\n12&nbsp;June\n*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The IMD reports that Deep Depression ex-Ashobaa (01A) has weakened into a depression while located roughly  southeast of Muscat, Oman.\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The JTWC reports that Tropical Storm Ashobaa (01A) has weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated while located roughly  southeast of Muscat, Oman.\n*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The IMD reports that Depression ex-Ashobaa (01A) has weakened into a well-marked low-pressure area while located roughly  southeast of Muscat, Oman.\n20&nbsp;June\n*03:00&nbsp;UTC (8:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) at &nbsp;– The IMD reports that Depression BOB 01 has formed while located roughly  south of Bhubaneswar, Odisha.
