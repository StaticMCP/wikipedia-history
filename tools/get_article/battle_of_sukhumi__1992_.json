The battle marked the start of 1992–1993 War in Abkhazia.\nBackground\nOn 23 July 1992, the Abkhaz faction of Abkhazia's legislative body, Supreme Council, announced its sovereignty from Georgia. In response, Eduard Shevardnadze, the new leader of Georgia, interrupted his trip to Western Georgia, where the Civil War had been going on between his government and supporters of former President, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, ousted during the December 1991 Coup. Shevardnadze announced that the decision had been taken without consulting and considering the opinion of the majority of the population of Abkhazia.\nSukhumi\nOn 11 August 1992 armed supporters of former Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia kidnapped Georgian Interior Minister Roman Gventsadze and five other officials  in a hit-and-run operation in the town of Zugdidi. In response, Shevardnadze declared battle against them and sent troops to the town, which is close to the border with Abkhazia. The rebels proceeded to take the hostages to an unknown hiding-place in Abkhazia. The Georgian troops entered Abkhazia to free hostages, but also to enforce security at unprotected railroads, since the area was only loosely controlled by the government due to insurgency and the railroads were often robbed by unknown bands in that location, with one out of every 10 trains being targeted on average. However, the separatist militias clashed with the Georgian troops and the battle for Sokhumi began. Georgian tanks and APC's moved through the streets in Sukhumi, battling Abkhaz militias who were armed with machine guns and formed barricades in the streets, while hurling Molotov cocktails as they lacked heavy anti-tank weapons. Georgian units used artillery against Abkhaz separatists in the places they controlled within the city.\nDespite Abkhaz resistance, the Georgian units were heavily armed and took the city within a matter of days. On 18 August, the Parliament of Abkhazia was stormed by the Georgian National Guard, and the Georgian flag was raised on the Council of Ministers buildings. All of Sukhumi was taken by August 18.\nCasualties and abuses\nOn August 16, 19 people were killed and 39 severely injured, but on August 18 the death toll has increased to at least 50 people killed.\nAfter taking Sukhumi, Georgian forces (including Mkhedrioni paramilitaries) engaged in \"vicious, ethnically based pillage, looting, assault and murder.\" In addition to the looting, Abkhaz cultural monuments were destroyed in a manner that, according to some reports, suggested deliberate targeting. University buildings were sacked and museums and other cultural collections broken up. The irreplaceable Abkhaz national archives were burned by Georgian troops. Reportedly, local firefighters didn't attempt to douse the blaze. A family of Abkhaz refugees from Sukhumi claimed that drunken Georgian troops broke into their apartment firing automatic weapons, and telling them \"to leave Sukhumi forever, because Sukhumi is Georgian.\" According to the family, the Georgian soldiers stole jewelry, assaulted the husband, and then threw them all out into the street. The same witnesses reported seeing dead Abkhaz civilians, including women and elderly people, scattered in the streets, even though the fighting had ended days before.\nAftermath\nAbkhaz forces retreated to Guduata, and started to arm themselves for a counterattack.\nReferences"
