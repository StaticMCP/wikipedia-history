Jugtown Road in the Goose Lake Prairie State Natural Area, near Morris, Illinois. The site, as well as the nearby tile works site, was part of a large White and Company plant used to manufacture stoneware and tile. The manufactury, which operated from 1855 to 1866, was one of the earliest large-scale stoneware plants in Illinois. The company chose the site for its plant due to the abundant clay resources around Goose Lake, which it used in its products. A town known as Jugtown was settled nearby for the plant's employees; the town reached a population of 114 by 1860. The stoneware site now mainly contains waste products from the stoneware production process, including kiln furniture and waster sherds.\nThe site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 6, 1998.\nReferences"
