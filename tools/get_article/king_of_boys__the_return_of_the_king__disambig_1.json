It was initially planned as a movie but ended up being made into a television series. A 4-minute teaser of the film was released on 16 September 2020. Filming lasted 3 months and ended on 3 November 2020. The official trailer was released on Monday 16 August 2021. It was released on 27 August 2021 exclusively on Netflix.\nToni Tones used method acting for her role as young Eniola, She had to learn the Yoruba language  as a significant proportion of her lines were in the language. She was tutored by Dele Adetiba.\nReception\nSola Sobowale received numerous accolades for her acting in the series. In a review for Pulse Nigeria, Precious Nwogu wrote \"'The Return of the King' makes good its promise of nostalgia but struggles through some barely sellable subplots and less endearing characters. The main plot following Eniola's governorship race and power tussle with the Randles is convincing, fresh and sufficiently takes its audience through the seven-episode series.\" A reviewer for Culture Custodian noted that the subplot surrounding Dapo Banjo and his family was \"long and overdrawn\" while Makanaki's role as a villain was underplayed. The reviewer however concluded that \"Ultimately, The Return of the King is worth the wait!\" While the reviewer for KemiFilani News praised Adetiba for her use of lights, shadows and angles saying \"Ultimately, a great deal of a film’s tone is reflected by its lighting and KOB; the return of the king scored 100%.\" the Pulse Nigeria reviewer noted that \"'The Return of the King' opts for high-key lighting that strips it of mystery.\" A Daily Trust reviewer noted that the film was dotted with unnecessarily long scenes as is the usual Nollywood fashion. A reviewer for The Cable praised the acting in the series noting that there was \"no overacting or underacting\" exempting Titi Kuti and Charly Boy. The reviewer also gave KOB praise for the theme and dialogue but gave low ratings for the plot, musical score, visual and sound effects.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
