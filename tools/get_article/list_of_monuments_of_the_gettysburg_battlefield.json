Most are located within Gettysburg National Military Park; others are on private land at battle sites in and around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Together, they represent \"one of the largest collections of outdoor sculpture in the world.\"\nMost are listed as contributing structures within Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District, which was approved by the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places on January 23, 2004.\nAs of 2008, the National Park Service unit managed 1,320 monuments and markers, 410 cannons, 148 historic buildings, and  of roads (8 miles of them, unpaved).\nThe largest concentration of monuments is at the Gettysburg National Cemetery, where President Abraham Lincoln gave his Gettysburg Address.\nAbout this list\n* Confederate and Union monuments are listed separately.\n* State monuments and monuments to individuals are listed alphabetically within their sections.\n* Regimental monuments are grouped within a state's section by type: Artillery / Cavalry / Infantry / Other (engineers, militia, reserves, sharpshooters).\n* Maryland has a section on both the Confederate and Union lists.\n* Most of the listings include the monument's GPS coordinates.\nConfederate monuments\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+valign=top style=\"background:#BEBEBE\" | Confederate monuments\n!

He commanded the 1st California and the entire brigade until his death in October 1861, after which the four were renamed as the 69th, 71st, 72nd and 106th Pennsylvania Regiments.
