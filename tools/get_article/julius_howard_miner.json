In the United States, he received a Bachelor of Laws from Chicago-Kent College of Law in 1917, and a Master of Laws from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1945. He was in private practice in Chicago, Illinois, from 1917 to 1924, when he was appointed a Master in Chancery for the Circuit Court of Cook County. He served in that role until he became a judge of that court in 1940; he served until his appointment to the federal bench. He was a lecturer at the John Marshall Law School from 1938 to 1949, and began lecturing at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1945.\nIn 1946, Miner wrote a paper criticizing trial by jury in the United States.\nDivorce cases and Strack family photo\nIllinois judges could not allow for a no-fault divorce until 2016, so someone divorcing their spouse had to prove in court that their spouse's behavior was serious and irreparably ruined the marriage. Miner was concerned about the effect of divorce on the children of affected couples. He believed that most failed marriages are reconcilable—and that women's greater role in American society during World War II undermined, Business Insider writes, women's \"responsibilities as wives and mothers\", thus leading to divorces. By the late 1940s, Miner essentially acted as a marriage therapist in every divorce case he preceded, trying to get couples to reconcile, and only allowed a divorce under extreme circumstances.\nMiner preceded over a 1948 case in which Chicago resident Anna Strack wanted to divorce her husband, Steve Strack, over his habitual alcoholism. This led to a famous photo taken right before Anna presented her case for divorce to Miner, which shows Steve kneeling before her and holding her hands, begging her not to divorce him, while she looks disinterested. The protest ultimately did not convince her to stay with him. After the photo appeared in the Chicago Tribune that year, the newspaper interviewed Miner over his thoughts on this and other divorce cases; Miner said he tried, but ultimately could not get, the Stracks to stay together. Anna successfully divorced Steve; he later remarried, while she did not. The photo, described by Business Insider as \"evocative\", went viral on social media platforms such as Reddit in the 2020s.\nFederal judicial service\nMiner was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 23, 1958, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois vacated by Judge John P. Barnes. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 25, 1958, and received his commission on February 27, 1958. Miner served in that capacity until his death on March 13, 1963.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n|years=1958–1963}}"
