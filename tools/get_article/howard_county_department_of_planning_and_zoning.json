Roughly 60 percent of land in Howard County is dedicated, protected for rural uses, with the remaining 40 percent shifting over time from suburban to focused, mixed use nodes. Affluent Howard County offsets higher infrastructure costs of low-density development with high-valued homes that generate greater property and transfer taxes.\nThe Department of Planning and Zoning provides staff and guidance to several citizen volunteer boards, including the Planning Board, the Agricultural Land Preservation Board the Historic District Commission, the Design Advisory Panel, and the Cemetery Preservation Advisory Board.\nThe Director of the Department operates as executive secretary of the planning board with five members with five-year terms.  The planning board advises on comprehensive zoning, the General Plan, amendments to the zoning regulations, and conditional uses.  The Board also is the design authority for most sketch plans and certain site development plans.\nThe department recommends zoning regulations to align with the County general plan. As of 2013, the county operates 41 separate zoning classifications. A comprehensive zoning review occurs every ten years. Zoning regulations are also created and changed in \"comp-lite\" reviews, as well as from council bills.\nHistory\nPlanning was managed by the state of Maryland until the First edition of Howard County Subdivision and Land Development Regulations on 7 March 1961\n* 1934 – Elkridge became the first in county to deploy water without federal aid.\n* 1943 – The Metropolitan District was formed to bring water and sewer to Ellicott City, sponsored by P.G.
