Several flying clubs are headquartered at the park, including branches of COPA and RAA.\nThe park is located within Boundary Bay park and borders the Boundary Bay Wildlife Management Area.\nHistory\nThe air park was established in the early 1960s and by the 1970s it housed about 120 aircraft. The 85th chapter of the Recreational Aircraft Association of Canada (RAA 85) constructed an aircraft hangar and clubhouse on the site in the 1970s.\nIn 1995 the park was acquired by Metro Vancouver who planned on turning the land into a park. An agreement was reached between Metro Vancouver and RAA 85 to allow flying to continue within the air park.\nAs of 2020, about 60 aircraft were stationed at the park including many antiques.\nThe park hosts an annual fly-in.\nSee also\n* List of airports in the Lower Mainland\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.deltaheritageairpark.org/ Delta Heritage Airpark]"
