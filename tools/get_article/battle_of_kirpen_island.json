On 29 November 1915 the German U-boat SM UC-13  was shadowing five Russian merchant ships when she ran aground off the mouth of the Sakarya River in poor weather. Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, the German commander of the Ottoman Navy sent two gunboats to recover the wreck. During the following cruise, the three Russian Derzky-class destroyers Derzky, Gnevny and Bespokoiny encountered the gunboats Taşköprü and Yozgat. In the ensuing combat the Russian gunners fired accurately and quickly sank both of the gunboats off Kefken Island on 10 December 1915.\nOrder of battle\nOttoman Navy:\n*Taşköprü, gunboat\n*Yozgat, gunboat\nRussian Navy:\n*Derzky, destroyer\n*Gnevny, destroyer\n*Bespokoiny, destroyer\nReferences"
