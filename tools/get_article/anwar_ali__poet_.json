He is also a literary editor and critic, translator, screenwriter, and documentary filmmaker.\nCareer\nLiterature\nAnvar Ali's first collection of poems, Mazhakkalam (The Rainy Season, 1999), established him as a prominent voice in contemporary Malayalam poetry. Ali's poetry collections include Aadiyaadi Alanja Marangale (Ye Trees, Swaying Ramblers, 2009) and Mehaboob Express (2020). Eternal Sculptures (2007) is a collection of his poems in English translation. His novella, Njan Rappai, was published in 1995.\nAli's poems have been translated into various Indian and foreign languages and have been included in several anthologies of contemporary poetry, such as Innan Ganges flyter in i natten (A Swedish Anthology of Indian Poetry in Hindi, Malayalam and English, edited by Tomas Lofstrom and Birgitta Wallin); Singing in the Dark - A Global Anthology of Poetry Under Lockdown (edited by K. Satchidanandan and Nishi Chawla); Oxford India Anthology of Modern Malayalam Literature, Volume 1 (edited by P. P. Raveendran and GS Jayasree); and The Tree of Tongues (edited by E V Ramakrishnan).\nAli translated Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window, the Japanese autobiographical memoir of Tetsuko Kuroyanagi – a literary classic, into Malayalam in 1994. He co-translated Sirpi Balasubramaniam’s poetry collection Oru Gramathile Nadi (A River in a Village, 2010). He has translated a series of modern Anglophone African poems and poems from Indian languages like Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, and Assamese into Malayalam.\nOn Anvar Ali’s contribution to Malayalam poetry, his friend and fellow poet Anitha Thampi has highlighted Ali’s unique exploration and transformation of the language of poetry in Malayalam. Further, Amrith Lal of The New Indian Express, a cultural columnist and critic, observes, \"Ali has carried forward the poetic language, constantly experimenting with its structures, drawing from Malayalam’s rich inheritance of story-telling and narrative poetry, the careful moulding of poetic metres, cross-fertilisation of the vocabulary by borrowing from popular culture, street talk and community lingo, using classical modes as well as parody, leaning on cinema and performance traditions to energise the art.\"\nOther works\nAnvar Ali has notably experimented with the performance of his poetry. In 2015–2017, he created a poetry band, Leaves of Grass, with guitarist and composer John P. Varkey. The band's performances combined the stylistic aspects of performance poetry with rock music.\nIn 2018, he collaborated with Olam, an instrumental band, to perform Mehboob Express, a long narrative poem that has gained acclaim as a chronological, sociocultural saga and critique of Indian politics. In 2017, in the maiden show at Uru Art Harbour, Mattancherry, curated by artist Riyas Komu, Ali showcased the living culture around legendary Mattancherry singer Mehboob (singer) through an audio-visual installation . Produced under the banner of Image Commune (2015), Ali's debut documentary film on Attoor Ravi Varma, Maruvili (Call from the other Shore), was selected for the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala (2015); Mumbai International Film Festival (2016); Jaffna International Film Festival, Sri Lanka (2016); and SIGNS Festival of Federation of Film Societies of India, Kerala (2015).\nHe co-wrote the screenplay of Margam (2003), an acclaimed Malayalam feature film, and co-directed a documentary series on the history of Malayalam cinema for Kerala State Film Development Corporation. He contributed to Shasthra Kouthukam, a science programme that aired in Doordarshan between 1991 and 1995, on behalf of the Centre for Development of Imaging Technology.\nAli co-edited the journals Pakshikkoottam (Flock of Birds), an alternate journal and publishing house, and Kavithakku Oru Idam (A Space for Poetry), a journal for new poetry in Malayalam. He was the chief content editor of Seventy-Five Years of Malayalam Cinema, a digital encyclopaedia produced\nby Kerala State Chalachitra Academy (2003).\nAli was invited to South Korea for the Writer-in-Residence Program of the Literature Translation Institute of Korea  in 2007 and attended the 2007 Afro-Asian Literature Festival in Jeonju, Korea. He has presented his work in various poetry, literary, and film festivals, including Young Poets Meet, New Delhi (1997); The New Voices, Trivandrum (2004); Asselieh Film Festival, Morocco (2004); Kavi Bharati, Bhopal (2005); Paju Book Festival, South Korea (2014); Sharjah International Book Fair (2014 & 2018); Bharatiya Kavita Samaroh, Patna (2014); Samanvay: IHC Indian Languages' Festival, New Delhi (2014); Jaffna International Film Festival, Sri Lanka (2016); and Kokrajhar Literary Festival, Bodoland, Assam (2021).\nAli's distinctive poetic idiom illuminates the lyrics of Annayum Rasoolum (2013), one among the films that brought a paradigm shift in Malayalam cinema. In his subsequent work, he has continued to experiment with fresh and bold poetic imagery and style, thus treading away from tradition and gaining much popularity among young audiences and filmmakers. Some of his notable works include Njan Steve Lopez (2014), Kammatipaadam (2016), Kismath (2016), Mayaanadhi (2017), Eeda (2018), Thottappan (2019), Kumbalangi Nights (2019), Nayattu (2021 film) (2020), Bhoomiyile Manohara Swakaryam (2020), Malik (film) (2021), and Oru Thekkan Thallu Case (2022).\nAwards\nLiterary awards\n* 1992- Kunchu Pillai Award\n* 2000- Kanakasree Endowment Award of Kerala Sahitya Akademi\n* 2021- Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Poetry  for Mehaboob Express.\nFilm awards for lyrics\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!\n!Award\n!Song\n!Notes\n|-\n|2018\n|65th Filmfare Awards South-Best Lyricist\n| \"Mizhiyil Ninnum\" (Mayanadi)\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|CPC Cine Awards - Best Original Song\n| \"Cherathukal\" (Kumbalangi Nights)\n| Award shared with Sushin Shyam and Sithara Krishnakumar\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2020\n|rowspan=2|Kerala State Film Award for Best Lyricist\n|Smaranakal Kaadayi(Bhoomiyile Manohara Swakaryam)\n|rowspan=2|\n|-\n| \"Theerame Theerame\"(Malik)\n|-\n| 2024\n| 69th Filmfare Awards South-Best Lyricist\n| \"Ennum En Kaaval\" (Kaathal – The Core)\n|\n|}\nOther awards\n* Kerala State Film Award for Best Screenplay (2003): Margam\n* The South-South Film Encounter, Morocco (2003) - Best Screenplay: Margam\n* Fajr International Film Festival (2003) - Best Screenplay: Margam\n* SIGNS Festival - Best Biopic Award (2015): Maruvili\nLiterary works\n*1994 –  Janalakkarikile Penkutty (Translation of Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window )\n*1995 – Njan Rappai (Novella)\n*1999 – Mazhakkalam (Poems)\n* 2007–  Eternal Sculptures(Poetry Collection in English)\n* 2009 – Aadiyaadi Alanja Marangale (Poems)\n* 2010 – Oru Gramathile Nadi (Translation of Poetry Collection by Sirpi Balasubramaniam)\n* 2025 –  Gaandhithodalmaala (Poetry Collection)\nAs lyricist\nFilm songs\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Song(s)\n!Title\n!Notes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2013\n|\"Kando Kando\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Annayum Rasoolum\n|\n|-\n|\"Vazhivakkil\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Aaru Ninte Naavikan\"\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |2014\n|\"Theruvukal Nee\"\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Njan Steve Lopez\n|\n|-\n|\"Ooraake Kalapila\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Chirakukal Njan Nee Dooramaay\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Muthu Penne\" (Research)\n|\n|-\n|\"Ulakam Vayalaakki\"\n|Jalamsham\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2016\n|\"Para Para\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Kammatipaadam\n|\n|-\n|\"Kaathirunna Pakshi Njaan\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Puzhu Pulikal\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Kisa Paathiyil\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Kismath\n|\n|-\n|\"Chilathunaam\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Vinnu Churanna\"\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2017\n|\"Lokam Ennum\"\n|Sakhavu\n|\n|-\n|\"Mizhiyil Ninnum\"\n|Mayaanadhi\n|\n|-\n|\"Thambiran\"\n|Ezra\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2018\n|\"Swapnam Swapnam\"\n|Padayottam\n|\n|-\n|\"Marivil\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Eeda\n|\n|-\n|\"Udalin\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Mizhi Niranju\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Kinavu Kondoru\"\n|Sudani from Nigeria\n|\n|-\n|\"Plathoore Sivantambalathin\"\n|Kuttanpillayude Sivarathri\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2019\n|\"Uyirullavaram\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Valiyaperunnal\n|\n|-\n|\"Thazhvarangal\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Pranthan Kandalinl\"\n|Thottappan\n|\n|-\n|\"Cherathukal\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Kumbalangi Nights\n|\n|-\n|\"Uyirilthodum\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Kurumali Puzhel\"\n|Pengalila\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2020\n|\"Smaranakal Kaadaayi\"\n|Bhoomiyile Manohara Swakaryam\n|\n|-\n|\"Muttathu\"\n|Halal Love Story\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" |2021\n|\"Odiyodippoya\"\n|Vishudha Rathrikal\n|\n|-\n|\"Chiramabhayamee\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Aarkkariyam\n|\n|-\n|\"Doore Maari\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Kinarilu\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Appalaale\"\n|Nayattu\n|\n|-\n|\"Odiyodippoya\"\n|Vishudha Rathrikal\n|\n|-\n|\"Theerame Theerame\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Mālik\n|\n|-\n|\"Aaraarum Kaanaathe\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Pakaliravukal\"\n|Kurup\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"14\" |2022\n|\"Arike Varathe\"\n|Kuttavum Shikshayum\n|\n|-\n|\"Badarile\"\n|rowspan=2|19(1)(a)\n|\n|-\n|\"Paravakal\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Yentharu\"\n|rowspan=3|Oru Thekkan Thallu Case\n|\n|-\n|\"Prema Neyyappam\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Paathirayil\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Mazhappattu\"\n|rowspan=5|Padavettu\n|\n|-\n|\"Maloor Thottam\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Panju Panju\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Public Veedu\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Padarvalli\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Kodum Ravil\"\n|Veyil\n|\n|-\n|\"Chaayum Veyil\"\n|Saudi Vellakka\n|\n|-\n|\"Oro Manavum\"\n|1001 Nunakal\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\" |2023\n|\"Etho Vaathil\"\n|Djinn\n|\n|-\n|\"Thaaraattayi\"\n|Iratta\n|\n|-\n|\"Devi Neeye\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Thankam\n|\n|-\n|\"Vichara Mazha\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Adam Mala\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Thuramukham\n|\n|-\n|\"Karakkenne\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Maravi\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Koorambay\"\n|Garudan\n|\n|-\n|\"Paathakal\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Vela\n|\n|-\n|\"Bambadiyo\"\n|\n|-\n|\"Chathayadina Paatu\"\n|Maharani\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2024\n|\"Nebulakal\" (Travel Song)\n|Manjummel Boys\n|\n|-\n|\"Aalunnu Neeye\"\n|Rifle Club\n|\n|}\nNon-film songs\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
