At the beginning of its activities, the Permanent Council considered a number of important issues and prepared several reforms, including a Decree on Free Ploughmen.\nWith the establishment of ministries and the Committee of Ministers in 1802, insignificant and intricate cases came to the consideration of the Permanent Council, and after the establishment of the State Council, the Permanent Council was finally abolished.\nSee also\n*Private Committee\nSources\n*\n*\n\"Decree “On the Establishment of an Permanent Council for Considering Important State Affairs\"\n|headerstyle=background:#ccccff\n|style=text-align:center;\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090109182722/http://www.gov.spb.ru/culture/personal/monarch/alexander_i Emperor Alexander I]"
