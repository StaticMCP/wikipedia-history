The falls are just under 70' tall from top to bottom, with the main falls at 60'. It is an extremely popular waterfall, due to ease of access to the falls directly on the side of the road.  There is a path that leads to the plunge pool. During the winter when the falls freeze solid, they are popular Ice Climbing destination.\nWintertime view of Looking Glass Falls\nAccording to local Emergency Services personnel, there have been many injuries and deaths at the falls, mainly due to individuals who rock climb near the edge of the falls and accidentally fall in the plunge pool, or persons who jump in the plunge pool. In 1990, South African kayaker Corran Addison kayaked over the falls successfully, but injured his back in the process.  Persons who visit Looking Glass Falls should take care to respect both basic safety rules and the fragile environment that exist at the falls.\nNearby falls\n*Slick Rock Falls\n*Moore Cove Falls\n*Sliding Rock\n*Cedar Rock Falls\n*Cove Creek Falls\n*Daniel Ridge Falls\n*Twin Falls\n*Log Hollow Falls\n*Falls on Log Hollow Branch\n*Key Falls\nSee also\n* List of waterfalls\n* List of waterfalls in North Carolina\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.ncwaterfalls.com/looking_glass1.htm NCWaterfalls.com Looking Glass Falls Page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070630002915/http://www.cs.unca.edu/nfsnc/recreation/wncwaterfalls/lookingglassfalls.htm National Forests in North Carolina]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090923191719/http://www.ashevillenow.com/s_outdoorActivities/waterfalls/transylvania_county_nc_waterfalls.asp Looking Glass and Other Waterfalls in Transylvania County]"
