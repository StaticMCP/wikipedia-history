An independent candidate is one who runs for office with no formal party affiliation.\nParties with ballot access in states holding 270 or more electoral votes are listed first in this article because 270 electoral votes represent a majority of the 538 electoral votes in the Electoral College.\nBallot access to all 538 electoral votes\nReform Party nomination\nReform candidates\n* Ross Perot&nbsp;– party founder and businessman from Texas\n* Richard Lamm&nbsp;– former Governor of Colorado\n* David L. Boren – former Senator from and former Governor of Oklahoma (declined)\n* Lowell P. Weicker Jr. – former Senator from and former Governor of Connecticut (declined)\n* Tim Penny – former Representative from Minnesota (declined)\nFile:Ross Perot 7 Allan Warren.jpg|Party Founder Ross Perot, from Texas\nFile:Richard Lamm.jpg|Former Governor Richard Lamm of Colorado\nFile:Senator David Boren (cropped).jpg|Former Senator David Boren from Oklahoma (declined)\nFile:Lweicker.jpg|Former Governor Lowell Weicker  of Connecticut (declined)\nFile:Congressman Timothy Penny.jpg|Former Representative Tim Penny from Minnesota(declined)\nThe United States Reform Party had great difficulty in finding a candidate willing to run in the general election. Lowell Weicker, Tim Penny, David Boren and Richard Lamm were among those who toyed with the notion of seeking its presidential nomination, though all but Lamm decided against it; Lamm had himself come close to withdrawing his name from consideration.\nUltimately, the Reform Party nominated its founder Ross Perot of Texas in its first election as an official political party. Although Perot easily won the nomination, his victory at the party's national convention led to a schism as supporters of Lamm accused him of rigging the vote to prevent them from casting their ballots. This faction walked out of the national convention and eventually formed their own group, the American Reform Party, and attempted to convince Lamm to run as an Independent in the general election; Lamm declined, pointing out a promise he made before running that he would respect the Party's final decision.\nEconomist Pat Choate was nominated for Vice President.\nLibertarian Party nomination\nLibertarian candidates\n* Harry Browne&nbsp;– writer and investment analyst from Tennessee\n* Rick Tompkins&nbsp;– former candidate for senator from Arizona\n* Irwin Schiff&nbsp;– writer and prominent figure in the tax protester movement from Nevada\n* Douglas J.

In 1996 the situation ultimately proved the same, though Pat Buchanan for a time was widely speculated to be planning on bolting to the Taxpayers' Party should the expected Republican nominee, Senator Bob Dole, name a Pro-Choice running-mate. When Jack Kemp, who is Pro-Life, was tapped for the position Buchanan agreed to endorse the Republican ticket. Again, Phillips found himself at a temporary post that was made permanent, with Herbert Titus being nominated for the Vice Presidency.\nPhillips and Titus drew 182,820 votes (0.19% of the popular vote).\nBallot access to fewer than 270, but more than 50 electoral votes\nGreen Party nomination\nGreen candidate:\nFile:Naderspeak.JPG|Political Activist, Author, and Attorney Ralph Nader from Connecticut\nThe Green Party of the United States&nbsp;– Ralph Nader of Connecticut was drafted as a candidate for President of the United States on the Green Party ticket.
