They also increased their share of the vote to their highest since 1987.\nThe Labour Party substantially increased their share of the vote and made gains for the first time since 2001, but did not overtake the Conservatives. Labour received its highest share of the vote in England since 1997.\nThe Liberal Democrats, led by Tim Farron saw their previous leader Nick Clegg lose his seat; as Sheffield Hallam was gained by the Labour candidate, Jared O'Mara. They also lost their by-election gain at Richmond Park to Zac Goldsmith of the Conservatives; whose resignation on 25 October 2016 triggered the by-election initially. They also gained some seats, including the recovery of Twickenham by former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable who had lost it to the Conservatives two years previously. Cable succeeded Farron as party leader on 20 July 2017.\nUKIP saw their share of the vote collapse to almost negligible levels. They failed to gain any new seats and their one success from 2015, Clacton, returned to Conservative control. Paul Nuttall resigned as party leader on 9 June 2017 after finishing in third place at Boston and Skegness.\nThe Green Party decreased its share of the vote and failed to make any gains, but retained Brighton Pavilion. The party deliberately chose not to contest many seats, in order to give Labour an increased chance of winning over Conservative candidates.\nRegional results\nRegional vote shares and changes are sourced from the House of Commons Library.\nEast Midlands\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! colspan=\"5\" |Seats\n! colspan=\"3\" |Aggregate Votes\n|-\n!

Both parties increased their share of the popular vote. The Liberal Democrats and Greens failed to make any improvement on the 2015 result, while UKIP saw its support collapse.\nIn the ceremonial county of West Midlands Labour won twenty seats and the Conservatives won eight. Gisela Stuart retired and was succeeded in Birmingham Edgbaston by Sandwell councillor Preet Gill, making her the first female Sikh in the House of Commons. Work & Pensions spokesman Jack Dromey (husband of Harriet Harman) was re-elected in Birmingham Erdington. Shadow Europe minister Khalid Mahmood achieved a fifth term as MP for Birmingham Perry Barr. Second Church Estates Commissioner Dame Caroline Spelman was returned im Meriden. Business minister Margot James won a third term in Stourbridge. Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell held Sutton Coldfield. Walsall councillor Eddie Hughes defeated the long-serving Labour backbencher David Winnick on a 12-point swing. Tom Watson, deputy Labour leader, was re-elected in West Bromwich East and Valerie Vaz, shadow leader of the Commons, held Walsall South.\nThe Conservatives made a clean sweep of Worcestershire for the third consecutive election. Their six MPs included communities secretary Sajid Javid and three junior ministers (Harriett Baldwin, Robin Walker and Mark Garnier).\nThe Conservatives also maintained their sweep of Shropshire from 2015. Five MPs were elected, including Philip Dunne (incumbent Minister of State for Health) and Owen Paterson (who had headed the Northern Ireland Office and Defra under the coalition).\nIn Staffordshire the Conservatives won nine seats and Labour the remaining three. Junior whips Andrew Griffiths and Christopher Pincher secured re-election, as did their predecessor Michael Fabricant in Lichfield, while Chief Whip Gavin Williamson increased his majority by two thousand. The Moorlands gave a third term to culture secretary Karen Bradley. Conservative Jack Brereton defeated Rob Flello, ending sixty-seven years of Labour representation in Stoke-on-Trent South.\nIn Warwickshire the Labour party gained Warwick and Leamington (county councillor Matt Western defeated Chris White, ending seven years of Conservative ascendancy.) The Conservatives held the five other seats, electing attorney-general Jeremy Wright, DCLG minister Marcus Jones and PPS Mark Pawsey.\nIn Herefordshire Jesse Norman and Bill Wiggin were both returned to Parliament.\nYorkshire and the Humber\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Party\n! colspan=\"5\" |Seats\n! colspan=\"3\" |Aggregate Votes\n|-\n!

UKIP had polled strongly in 2015 but this year declined to insignificance. The Green Party continued to have negligible presence.\nAll three Kingston-upon-Hull constituencies were held by Labour: Diana Johnson and Karl Turner were re-elected by large majorities, while former Home Secretary Alan Johnson retired and was replaced by Hessle town councillor Emma Hardy.\nIn the East Riding of Yorkshire, the four Conservative MPs (David Davis, Graham Stuart, Greg Knight and Andrew Percy) were all re-elected with substantially increased shares of the vote.\nLabour made a clean sweep across South Yorkshire, holding the thirteen which they had already (including Doncaster North for former leader Ed Miliband and Doncaster Central for former Chief Whip Dame Rosie Winterton) as well as gaining Sheffield Hallam from the former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.\nIn West Yorkshire five Conservatives (Craig Whittaker, Alec Shelbrooke, Andrea Jenkyns, Stuart Andrew and Philip Davies) were re-elected. Two others (Jason McCartney and Kris Hopkins) were defeated by Labour, as was the only Liberal Democrat Greg Mulholland. Labour held the fourteen seats it had won in 2015, returning shadow Lord Chancellor Richard Burgon and leadership contender Yvette Cooper as well as actress Tracy Brabin who had been elected the previous autumn following the murder of Jo Cox.\nNo constituencies changed allegiance in North Yorkshire: Labour's Rachael Maskell was re-elected in York Central while all seven other seats were held by the Conservatives, including vice-chamberlain and junior whip Julian Smith and transport minister Andrew Jones.\nIn North and North East Lincolnshire Nic Dakin and Martin Vickers were both re-elected. Melanie Onn also won re-election in Great Grimsby.\nResults by county\nThe below tables summarise the results by county as used by the Boundary Commission for England at the time of the last boundary review.\nAvon\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; font-size:95%;\"\n|+\n!
