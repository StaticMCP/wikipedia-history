      "text": "# When Two Worlds War\n\nWhen Two Worlds War is a 1993 video game developed by Impression Games. It is a strategic simulation of interplanetary conflict.\nCritical reception\nAmiga Format thought the game was neither simplistic nor shallow. Meanwhile, CU Amiga Magazine felt the game was identical to Utopia in every way, sans the fun.\nComputer Gaming Worlds Martin Cirulis praised the packaging and the manuals, with the interface being described as \"exceptionally clear and easy to use.\" However on the gameplay front, he felt that the game lacked personality, with \"potential strengths... left unexplored.\" He also found the AI too easy to defeat, even at the highest level. Overall, he concluded that while the game was not bad, it fell short of its potential, comparing the game to getting Battlestar Galactica when Star Wars had been promised.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
