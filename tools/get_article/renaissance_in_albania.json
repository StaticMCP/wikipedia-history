It was a part of the Southern renaissance and came from the Italian Renaissance.\nDuring the 15th century AD, the ideas of the Renaissance would reach Albania through coastal trade cities such as Scutari, Durrës, Ulcinj, Kotor, and Tivar, with these cities evolving into Adriatic trading centers. The ideas of the Renaissance would lead to Albanian development in art, literature, education, science, and diplomacy.\n, the oldest Albanian book.]]\nWith the end of the Albanian–Ottoman Wars (1432–1479), many humanist scholars would migrate to foreign countries such as Italy to escape Ottoman rule. This led to most early Albanian documents being lost or forgotten and most texts written by Albanians in this time being in Latin. Few scholars would remain in Albania, such as Gjon Buzuku, Pjetër Budi, Pjetër Bogdani, Frang Bardhi, and Onufri. Scholars that lived outside of Albania, such as Marin Barleti, Dhimitër Frëngu, or Marin Beçikemi, dedicated most of their work to Skanderbeg and his \"heroics\", picturing him as a national hero.\nOverview\nPre-Renaissance Albania\nBefore the Renaissance, Albania had little development in science and in preserving its own language. Most schools focused on religious studies instead of scientific ones. In terms of literature, Albanians did not use their own language. Despite having their own, in books, documents, and daily interactions they would use Greek or Latin. This usage of foreign languages was also documented by the bishop of Tivar, Guillem Adam, who in a letter to the French king in 1332 would state:\nThe first known document originally written in Albanian that was later translated to Latin is the \"Baptismal formula\" by the bishop of Durrës, Pal Engjëlli, in 1462, which today is located in the library of Florence. The second known document is a part of the Easter Gospel Pericope though to have been written around the late 15th century – early 16th.\nArrival of the Rennaisance\nThrough coastal cities on the Adriatic coast such as Scutari, Durrës, Ulcinj, Kotor, and Tivar, the ideas of the renaissance would reach Albania via books and documents near the end of the 15th century. Due to Ottoman rule, many scholars migrated to Italy where they would create works on Skanderbeg and Albanian nationalism, while the ones that remained in Albania would focus on preserving Albanian traditions, language, and culture through religious works. The period was also characterized by the opening of schools and universities.\nLiterature\nFrom authors that remained in Albania, the most notable were Gjon Buzuku, Pjetër Bogdani, Pjetër Budi, and Frang Bardhi. Gjon Buzuku wrote the first-ever Albanian book, originally written in the Gheg dialect, Meshari, in 1555. Meshari is the translation of the main parts of the Catholic Liturgy into Albanian. It contains the liturgies of the main religious holidays of the year, comments from the book of prayers, excerpts from the Bible, and excerpts from the ritual and catechism. Pjetër Bogdani would also publish a book focused on Catholicism, the Çeta of Prophets (Cuneus Prophetarum). Pjetër Budi is another writer known for his works and translations on religion which would be published in Rome, and in 1618 he wrote 100 pages of prose as well as 3,200 verses of poetry, which would be published in the Christian Doctrine. He is also known for writing the book \"Pasqyra e të rrëfyemit\" Frang Bardhi was another notable Albanian writer and bishop, known for trying to preserve the Albanian language. In 1635, he published the first Albanian dictionary, Dictionarium latino-epiroticum (Latin-Albanian dictionary), and in 1636 he wrote a biography of Skanderbeg, titled The Apology of Scanderbeg.\nDiaspora literature\nFrom the Albanian authors that lived outside of Albania, the most notable would be Demetrio Franco (Dhimitër Frëngu), Marin Barleti, Marin Beçikemi, and Anonimi Tivaras. One of the earliest books written by the Albanian diaspora was Historia Skanderbegiae (History of Skanderbeg), also known as History of the Kastrioti named Skanderbeg, published in 1480 in Venice by Anonimi Tivaras. Other books published on Skanderbeg during this time were Siege of Shkodra and Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis (1504) by Marin Barleti and Gli illustri e gloriosi gesti e vittoriose imprese fatte contro i Turchi dal Signor Don Georgio Castriotto detto Scanderbeg, principe d' Epiro by Dhimitër Frëngu, who also wrote a biography on him. Marin Beçikemi would be another author known for his works on Albania after the Ottoman invasion, as well as the translation of ancient Roman texts.\nPoetry\nof Yahya bey Dukagjini.]]\nDuring the 16th-17th centuries poetry would also experience a growth in popularity. Most Albanian poets from this time would live in Istanbul, writing diwan poetry in the Ottoman Turkish alphabet. Many of these poems would play a crucial role in classical Turkish literature. Of these poets, the most notable were Mesihi of Prishtina, Yahya bey Dukagjini and Suzi Çelebi. Mesihi is known for writing the poem \"Murabba' -i bahâr\" (Ode to Spring) which would later be translated by Orientalist William Jones. It remained for a long time as the best known Turkish poem in Europe. Yahya Bey Dukagjini also played a crucial role in Albanian-Ottoman poetry. He is known for writing a Khamsa of five poems, from which the most famous are \"Shâh u gedâ\" (The King and the Beggar) and \"Yusuf ve Züleyha\" (Yusuf and Züleyha), a poem which regards the romance and love of two youths. Suzi Çelebi is known for writing the epic poem \"Gazavatname Mihaloğlu''\", which narrates the 15th century Ottoman conquest of the Balkans as well as the glory and battles of Ottoman commander Mihaloğlu Ali Bey. Çelebi also founded the first open library in the Ottoman Balkans in Prizren.\nHistorical texts\nHistory would be another field which would see large developments during the Albanian renaissance with the ideas of preserving Albanian culture and language. During this time the most notable historians would be Frang Bardhi, Marin Barleti (who were also writers) as well as Gjon Muzaka. Frang Bardhi and Marin Barleti are known for writing the aforementioned, \"Apology  of Skanderbeg\" together with the \"Siege of Shkodra\" and the \"The history of the life and deeds of Scanderbeg, the Prince of Epirus\". \"The Apology of Skanderbeg\" depicts the entire life of the Albanian general. Written in 1631, the book was made in a pique of anger of Bardhi towards a Bosnian Slav who claimed that Skanderbeg wasn't Albanian. \"The Siege of Shkodra\" is a book on the Siege of Shkodra during (1478–1479) which Barleti wrote after being an eyewitness of the battle. The book depicts the \"bravery\" of the Albanian people in times of war and describes events from the siege. \"The history of the life and deeds of Scanderbeg, the Prince of Epirus\" is one of the earliest and well-known books about Skanderbeg, with it being used as a primary source on many publications. Despite this, some events from Barleti's books are not real or different from real events and are criticized, such as the correspondence between Vladislav II of Wallachia and Skanderbeg which he wrongly assigned to the year 1443 instead of 1444, as well as the correspondence between Skanderbeg and Sultan Mehmed II to match his interpretations of events.\nGjon Muzaka is known for writing the Muzaka chronicles in 1510, a series of documents which describe the history of Muzaka Principality as well as the other Albanian noble houses during the Middle Ages, however Gjon Muzaka is criticized for his chronicles having \"bias\" with him depicting his house as a higher one oppose to the others.\nArt\nIn Albania, the most notable painters were Onufri and his son Nikolla. Art during the Renaissance in Albania focused mostly on Christian religious figures. Many painters would paint in churches or monasteries, with most of their works focusing on prophets or Jesus, such as Nikolla who painted in the Church of St. Vllaherna in Berat. The artistic works of this period, especially from Onufri, would leave an influence on Albanian art up until the 19th century. Onufri introduced a new style of painting with him using natural color dies as well as introducing the color pink into paintings. He would paint religious and historical figures as well as nature. Onufri also established the first Albanian art school in Berat, which would later be passed down to Nikolla.\npainted by Onufri]]\nSome sources also state that Marco Basaiti, famous Venetian painter came from an Albanian family, with him also writing texts and supporting the Albanian school of Venice.\nScience and Philosophy\nDuring the Renaissance the most practiced fields of science were Medicine, Mathematics and Astronomy. One of the most notable Albanian humanists that studied science was Gjon Gazuli, a professor at the University of Padua. Gazuli's \"expertise\" was mathematics and astronomy, with his scientific works receiving praise across Italy and Hungary. Nicholas Leonicus Thomaeus  (Albanian: Nikollë Leonik Tomeu) is also considered to be an Italian-born Albanian scientist and philosopher, though some sources refer to him as Greek. Tomeo was a teacher at the University of Padua, lecturing about ancient Greek texts, mainly those by Aristotle. His philosophical ability was admired by several scholars such as Desiderius Erasmus. Tomeo also wrote a series of Latin philosophical dialogues in 1524, the first of which was \"Trophonius, sive, De divinatione\". His most notable work is the \"Opuscula\".\nMedicine during the Albanian Renaissance was mainly practiced through means of Traditional medicine. This form of medicine gained popularity among the Northern Albanians, who used endemic plants, mainly Sideritis (mountain tea) and Origanum Vulgare for herbal treatments. Research from the 2000s showed that these treatments were effective for anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties.\nEducation\nPreviously the main form of education in Albania came from Monasteries or churches where the main subject was theology. This education system aimed to make students grow up and be monks or priests. This form of education became widespread during the 13th century with the arrival of Franciscan and Dominican missionaries, who opened several churches in larger cities. The Renaissance would bring the appeal of critical thinking to education, leading to the teachings of the seven liberal arts (both trivium and quadrivium). The University of Durrës would \"flourish\" during this time; however, it would be abandoned by its staff in the Ottoman invasion.  They opened a new university in Tivar. Many Albanians living outside of the country would also achieve education in multi-cultural colleges such as the College of Loreto and the Illyrian College of Fermo. Education among Albanians in Italy would also be received in the Albanian school of Venice also known as \"Scuola degli Albanesi\" established by Albanian immigrants between 1500 and 1504. Although primarily serving as a trade school, students would also receive general education. It would operate until the 18th century, with it educating the children of some of the most notable Albanian humanist scholars. The institution would be supported by many key-figures of the Albanian and Italian Renaissance's, including Italian artist Vittore Carpaccio who painted several murals in the school. Schools were also established; however, the earliest known schools come in the later Renaissance period. The earliest known Albanian school is the school of Veles in Mirdita, opened in 1632, but there was also a school opened in Kurbinë the same year which could have been older. Other schools included the school of Himarë, the school of Pllana in Karadak, of Blinisht, of Shkodër, Orosh, Janjevë, Durrës, Gjakova, and Peja.\nArchitecture\nArchitecture was another field which gained popularity in Albania with the coming of the Renaissance. It had influence from the Byzantine style as well as the roman and gothic styles. Most famous Albanian architects at this time worked on projects outside of Albania, mainly in the Ottoman Empire and Italy. Some of the most famous architects that worked in the Ottoman lands were Architect Kasemi and Sedefkar Mehmed Agha, while from the architects that worked in Italy the most famous was Andrea Alessi, who also worked in Dalmatia. From architectural works in Albanian lands, only a handful of monuments built around the 14th-15th centuries, mainly churches, remain such as the Churches of Shirgji, St. Stephan, Vaut in Deja, Berat and Myzeqe. After the Ottoman invasion most churches would be destroyed and replaced with mosques.\nArchitect Kasem and Mehmed Agha were famous for working on mosques in Istanbul, with their style having large ottoman influence. Mehmed Agha is famous for constructing the Blue Mosque also known as the Sultan Ahmed Mosque. Architect Kasem would be another famous architect who is known for works such as the Baghdad Kiosk, Revan Kiosk and Tiled Kiosk in the Topkapı Palace, as well as the projecting of the Spice Bazaar in Istanbul which is the second largest covered shopping mall. Kasem would also create many structures in Albania such as inns, bridges, roads and baths.\nSome also theorise that the Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, who was one of the architects of the Topkapı Palace who also projected many other bridges and mosques in ottoman lands, to have been of Albanian origin.\n]]\nAndrea Alessi would be another architect famous for his unique style. His most notable work was the Baptistry of Trogir, located in Trogir, Croatia. Alessi also projected many merchant statues and cathedral expansions. Most of his work would be carried out in Dalmatia.\nSt. Mary Church of Moscopole\nThe Church of Saint Mary in Voskopojë is a post-Byzantine orthodox church built during 1694–1699.
