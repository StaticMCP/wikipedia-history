The organisation carried out terrorist actions in Europe and Australia. The organisation was active throughout the territory of Yugoslavia in the early and mid-1960s. Its aim was to start an uprising in Yugoslavia and to establish an independent Croatia. This mission failed due to the intervention of the State Security Administration,  Yugoslav secret police.\nActions\n* Action Kangaroo (July 1963) The objective was to focus on the Croatian villages and provincial enterprises in northern Yugoslavia, spreading anti-Communist propaganda and promoting civil unrest.\n* Belgrade cinema bombing in 1968\n* Belgrade train station bombing in 1968\n* Uprising attempt in Bugojno, 1972\n* Action Kaktus; a sabotage attempt on the 1975 tourist season\nNotable members\nSome notable CRB members were:\n*Jure Maric\n*Ilija Tolic\n*Josip Oblak\n*\n*\n*Blaž Kraljević\n*\n*\nThese people were also members of Ante Pavelić's Croatian Liberation Movement (HOP) but they left that organisation because they decided they would not achieve their goals through the political route.\nUDBA, the Yugoslav secret police, attempted to curb the group's terrorist activities by engaging in covert assassinations of its members. Geza Pašti was killed in Nice in 1965, and Marijan Šimundić was killed in Stuttgart in 1967.\nThe CRB/HRB's motto was: \"Život za Hrvatsku\" [\"Life for Croatia\"].\nSee also\n*Croatian National Resistance\n*Croatian Revolution Hackers\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
