It entered into force on 8 September 1947 and according with article VI paragraph 2 of its text, it remained in force for a period of fifty years.\nAccording to Marc Trachtenberg, the German threat was a pretext for defence against the USSR.\nThis Treaty preceded the Treaty of Brussels of 1948 (also known as the \"Brussels Pact\"), which established the Western Union among Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, that became Western European Union in 1955, after the entry into force of the Treaty of Brussels of 1954 (also known as \"Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT)\"), when Italy and West Germany were admitted.\nSee also\n* North Atlantic Treaty\n* Treaty establishing the European Defence Community\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/treaty_of_alliance_and_mutual_assistance_between_the_united_kingdom_and_france_dunkirk_4_march_1947-en-1fb9f4b5-64e2-4337-bc78-db7e1978de09.html Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and France]\n* [http://www.ena.lu/signing_treaty_dunkirk_march_1947-020703059.html Signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk]"
