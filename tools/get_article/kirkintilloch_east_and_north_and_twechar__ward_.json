It elects three Councillors. The current entity was technically created in 2017 following a boundary review, but has largely the same boundaries as the 2007 Kirkintilloch East and Twechar ward, which as its name suggests encompassed the eastern parts of Kirkintilloch (neighbourhoods between the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Luggie Water, including Harestanes, Hillhead, Merkland and Waterside) and the separate village of Twechar further east, up to the boundary with Kilsyth and Cumbernauld in North Lanarkshire.\nThe 2017 amendments involved the addition of the Kirkintilloch neighbourhoods north of the canal / along the A803 road from the defunct Campsie & Kirkintilloch North ward with the name also altered to reflect this, although the number of representatives did not change. In 2020, the ward population was 18,251.\nCouncillors\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Election\n!colspan=6|Councillors\n|-\n!2007\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=4|John Jamieson(SNP)\n|rowspan=6; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=6|Stewart MacDonald(Labour)\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=3|Jack Young(EDIA / Ind.)\n|-\n!2012\n|-\n!2012\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|-\n!2017\n|rowspan=2; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=2|Susan Murray(Liberal Democrats)\n|-\n!2022\n|rowspan=2|Pamela Marshall(SNP)\n|-\n!2025\n|rowspan=1; style=\"background-color: \" |\n|rowspan=1|Aidan Marshall(Labour)\n|}\nElection results\n2025 by-election\nA by-election was held on 13 February 2025.\n2022 election\n2022 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2017 election\n2017 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2012 election\n2012 East Dunbartonshire Council election\n2007 election\n2007 East Dunbartonshire Council election\nReferences"
