The Admiralty controlled global deployment of the navy until 1964 when that department was abolished and replaced by the new Navy Department, Ministry of Defence.  These geographic commands usually comprised fleets, squadrons, flotillas, and single ships. In 1954, major re-structuring of the composition of the navy was undertaken, leading to downsizing and warships being rotated between the various fleets and stations.  In 1954 and 1971, many of these commands were abolished or amalgamated into larger geographic commands. In November 1971, nearly all British naval forces were brought under the command of a single fleet whose headquarters was at Northwood, Middlesex then under the control of Commander-in-Chief Fleet. In 2012, that post was abolished and replaced by the Fleet Commander who now operated from Navy Command Headquarters in Portsmouth, Hampshire.\nOrganizational changes\nNote: Command structure organizational changes took place within Royal Navy post war period the term Flotilla was previously applied to a tactical unit until 1951 which led to the creation of three specific Flag Officers, Flotillas responsible for the Eastern, Home and Mediterranean fleets the existing destroyer flotillas were re-organized now as administrative squadrons.\nDeployments\nIncluded:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! from !! to !! deployed to !! additional notes\n|-\n| 1951 || 1952 || Mediterranean Fleet  ||\n|-\n| 1953 || 1955 || Home Fleet ||\n|-\n| 1956 || 1957 || Mediterranean Fleet ||\n|-\n| 1958 || 1959|| Home Fleet ||\n|-\n|}\nComposition\nIncluded:\n, Mediterranean Fleet 1951\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Corunna\n* HMS Gabbard replaced by HMS Aisne (1951)\n* HMS St. James replaced by HMS Jutland (1951)\n, Mediterranean Fleet 1952\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Aisne\n* HMS Corunna\n* HMS Jutland\n, Home Fleet 1953\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Aisne\n* HMS Corunna\n* HMS Jutland\n, Home Fleet 1954\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Aisne\n* HMS Barrosa\n* HMS Corunna\n, Home Fleet 1955\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Aisne\n* HMS Barrosa\n* HMS Corunna\n, Mediterranean 1956\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Aisne\n* HMS Barrosa\n* HMS Corunna\n, Mediterranean 1957\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Alamein\n* HMS Barrosa\n* HMS Corunna\n, Home Fleet 1958\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Alamein\n* HMS Barrosa\n* HMS Corunna\n, Home Fleet 1959\n4th Destroyer Squadron\n* HMS Agincourt (Leader)\n* HMS Alamein\n* HMS Barrosa\n* HMS Corunna\nSquadron commander\nIncluded:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
