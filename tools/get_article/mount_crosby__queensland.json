In the , Mount Crosby had a population of 1,860 people.\nGeography\nThe locality of Mount Crosby is bounded to the south-west and south by the Brisbane River (known by locals as the \"Devil's elbow\"), to the south-east by Mount Crosby Road and a second section of the Brisbane River, and to the north by Lake Manchester Road and Swensons Road.

He and Lieutenant Butler climbed the mountain (now known as Mount Crosby) naming it Belle Vue Mountain. The origin of the current name is uncertain, but there are two theories. The first theory is that first farmers to take up land in the area came from Crosbie-on-Eden on the England-Scotland border and they named the mountain Mount Crosbie. The second theory is that a gold prospector George Crosby worked here in the early days.\nIn 1824, Allan Cunningham explored a shallow part of the Brisbane River () at the south-eastern corner of the present-day locality of Mount Crosby. This ford was later named Colleges Crossing after farmer George College or Colledge (his name was spelled with both variants) who immigrated to Brisbane on the ship Artemisia in 1849 and acquired land in the area circa 1852.\nThe Crosby postal receiving office opened on 1 January 1882; it was renamed Mount Crosby receiving office in June 1917.

Mount Crosby Provisional School opened on 30 January 1882 with 22 pupils under teacher Arthur Leigh. It closed on 31 December 1892, but soon reopened on 11 September 1893 as Mount Crosby State School under head teacher Samuel Rea. This original school was located at 655 Mount Crosby Road and is now heritage-listed.\nThe Mount Crosby Pumping Station and the first Mount Crosby weir opened in 1892 to supply water to Brisbane. A small village was established to accommodate the workers, consisting of 60 cottages and other facilities such as a church/hall, store, and bowls club.\nA tramway was built from Tivoli to convey coal from the Ipswich Coalfield to the station.\nIn the early 1940s, about  of land was sold to Scouts Australia. This was developed as the Tyamolum Scout Camp.\nOn 13 May 1948, Queensland Premier Ned Hanlon officially opened the first section of the Mount Crosby East Bank Water Treatment Plant.\nThe Autism Therapy & Education Centre opened on 1 March 1985 and closed on 5 June 2003.
