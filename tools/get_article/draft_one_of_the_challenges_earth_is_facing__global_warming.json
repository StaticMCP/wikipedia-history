It refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases. Global Warming is one of the biggest issues in surviving, yet humanity tends to forget about it.How can we prevent our world from faltering?\nCauses of Global Warming\nGlobal warming is the gradual heating of the atmosphere. It is caused by the number of gases released daily which then get trapped in the atmosphere. For instance;\n➢ Carbon Dioxide - exhaled by living organisms\n➢ Human Caused Greenhouse Gases - pollution, ocean pollution, climate change, global warming, etc.\n➢ Burning Fossils- garbage, coal, wood, etc.\n➢ Any kind of smoke from vehicles, factories, and more. Effects of Global Warming\nThe effect of Global Warming threatens every living thing on Earth, because of the amount of heat trapped, it then radiates heat which causes temperature to rise by an unusual number.In which heat-related disasters occur more than usual like forest fires or melting of ice in Antarctica which threatens the animals living there.\nHistorical records of Global Warming\nA historical record shows Earth's average temperature has risen over 1°C (2°F) since the late 19th century, with the rate of warming accelerating significantly since 1980. Accurate global temperature records, which began in 1850, indicate that the ten warmest years on record have all occurred in the past decade (2015-2024). This warming trend is linked to human activities, with scientists using direct measurements, as well as ice cores and other climate proxies, to track changes in Earth's climate history.\nKey Aspects of Global Warming’s Record\nPre-Industrial vs. Modern Era:\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, Earth's temperature was stable, but human activities have since released greenhouse gases that warm the planet.\n➢ Record-Keeping: Reliable global temperature data has been collected since 1850, providing a crucial baseline for understanding long-term trends.\n➢ Accelerated Warming: While the Earth has warmed since 1850, the rate of warming has more than doubled since 1980 compared to the preceding period.\n➢ Recent Warmest Years: The most recent decade, 2015-2024, holds the record for the warmest years ever recorded, with each of the last four decades being warmer than the one preceding it.\nHow Scientists Track Past Climate\n➢ Direct Temperature Readings: Modern records provide precise measurements of surface temperatures.\n➢ Paleoclimate Proxies: To understand climate changes before record-keeping began, scientists use proxy data, such as ice cores, which contain trapped atmospheric information that reveals past temperatures.\n➢ Satellite Data: Satellite records, which began in 1993, provide a comprehensive view of sea level changes and other global climate indicators.\nPrevention of Global Warming\nTo prevent this from getting worse, daily practices are encouraged;\n➢ Saving energy - include turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using LED bulbs, unplugging devices from the wall, taking shorter showers, installing a programmable thermostat, and improving home insulation.\n➢ Public transportation - for reducing CO2 emissions by replacing individual car journeys with shared, more energy-efficient modes of transport like buses, trains, and electric vehicles.\n➢ Eat more vegetables - lowers our environmental impact and generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land and water.\n➢ Switch to an electric vehicle - unlike other vehicles, an electric vehicle does not produce smoke.\n➢ Reduce, reuse, repair & recycle - to avoid extracting raw materials and to manufacturing and transporting goods to market.\nSocieties must also prepare for and adapt to the changes that are already occurring and will continue to happen. By practicing these daily, we gradually lessen the amount of gases released and less waste produced which slowly removes the heat trapped in the atmosphere. Global warming isn't just any minor challenges, it is a crucial human-caused problem with widespread environmental and societal impacts, including rising temperatures, sea-level rise, and more extreme weather.\nReferences"
