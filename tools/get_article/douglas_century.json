One of the miracles of this book is that it occurred at all.\" Publishers Weekly called the debut book, \"At once mesmerizing, humorous and tragic... a heady mixture of reportage and memoir.\"\nTakedown: The Fall of the Last Mafia Empire\nCentury's second book, about Operation Wasteland, was Takedown: The Fall of the Last Mafia Empire (coauthored with NYPD Detective First-Grade Rick Cowan) was a The New York Times best-seller, a finalist for the 2003 Edgar Award (\"Best Fact Crime\"), and a finalist for the 2003 Audie Awards (\"Best Audiobook of the Year, Non-Fiction, Abridged,\" as read by actor Christopher Meloni). Newsweek says the book is a \"new gangland epic.\"\nBarney Ross: The Life of a Jewish Fighter\nAfter the publication of his third book, the best-seller Barney Ross, Century toured extensively, speaking across the United States and Canada about the life and times of Ross (born Dov Ber Rasofsky), the Hall of Fame boxing great and World War II hero. \"This is an excellent story of a man and his times,\" wrote boxing historian Bert Randolph Sugar in The New York Times Book Review. \"... proof positive that time does not relinquish its hold over men or monuments. In a sport devoted to fashioning halos for its superstars, Ross wore a special nimbus, and this book properly fits him for that.\"\nBrotherhood of Warriors and If Not Now, When?\nCentury is the coauthor of Brotherhood of Warriors: Behind Enemy Lines with a Commando in one of the World’s Most Elite Counterterrorism Units, with former Israeli special forces operative Aaron Cohen, published by Ecco/HarperCollins in April 2008. The book recounts Cohen's work in the mid-1990s as a member of Duvdevan Unit (Hebrew: דובדבן; lit. cherry) a controversial Special Forces outfit which runs missions targeting wanted terrorist suspects in the occupied territories of the West Bank, often while posing in undercover disguise as Palestinian Arabs.\nIn October 2008, the Penguin Group published the memoir of Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Colonel Jack H. Jacobs, ''If Not Now, When?: Duty and Sacrifice in America's Time of Need, coauthored by Douglas Century, with a foreword by NBC Nightly News anchor and managing editor Brian Williams.

The Associated Press said the book is \"as cool as its namesake... a fascinating memoir, the pages of which are jam-packed with tales of a guy who ‘actively did everything I rhymed about.’\"\nThe New York Times Book Review said it is the embodiment of \"hip-hop's Horatio Alger\" myth: \"Ice-T, in short, is someone hip-hop might have invented if he hadn't invented himself,\" reviewer Baz Dreisinger wrote. \"A goes-down-easy mélange of memoir, self-help, and amateur criminology. Ultimately, Ice showcases an eminently reasonable, positively likeable guy, the gangsta rapper even a parent could love.\"\nIn July 2022, Century again collaborated with Ice-T writing Split Decision: Life Stories (Gallery Books), a dual memoir about Ice-T and his former partner-in-crime, Spike, as well as their early days as jewel thieves and street hustlers in Los Angeles and their vastly diverging life trajectories. Publishers Weekly in a starred review called the book \"a propulsive chronicle...This grave and astonishing account will leave fans in awe,\"  while Booklist called Split Decision \"an astounding and provocative tale... a powerful memoir of diverging lives.\"\n''Hunting El Chapo: The Inside Story Of The American Lawman Who Captured The World's Most-wanted Drug Lord\nIn April 2018, Century coauthored Hunting El Chapo'' (HarperCollins) with former DEA Special Agent Andrew Hogan, an account of Hogan's eight-year investigation tracking down and eventually capturing the world's most-wanted drug-trafficker Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera a.k.a. El Chapo. Dateline profiled Inside the Hunt for El Chapo on April 8, 2018; it was hosted by Lester Holt. The book was published worldwide in many languages including Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Dutch, and Japanese. USA Today described the book as \"Cinematic... captivating... the most authentic glimpse inside the world of El Chapo—because Hogan actually went there and did what few thought possible.\"\nIn March 2017, Variety reported that Sony Pictures with 3 Arts Entertainment optioned Hunting El Chapo for a feature film with Michael Bay set to produce it.\nNo Surrender: A Father, A Son, And An Extraordinary Act Of Heroism That Continues To Live On Today\nIn 2019, Century coauthored No Surrender (Harper One) with Pastor Chris Edmonds, a work of narrative nonfiction chronicling the World War II experiences of Edmond's late father, U.S. Army Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds of the 106th Infantry Division. Captured during the vicious fighting in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, imprisoned in Germany's Stalag IXA, Master Sgt. Edmonds refused the order of a Nazi major to identify the Jewish servicemen among the prisoners saying, \"We are all Jews here.\" For his defense of Jewish servicemen at the POW camp, Edmonds was posthumously awarded the title \"Righteous Among the Nations\" from Yad Vashem, Israel's highest honor for non-Jews who risked their own lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. Of 25,000 people to receive the award, Edmonds was the fifth of five Americans, and the only active serviceman during World War II.\nFor writing No Surrender, Century received a 2020 Christopher Award; it was recognized as being one of the best nonfiction books of the year.\nThe Last Boss of Brighton: Boris \"Biba\" Nayfeld and the Rise of the Russian Mob in America\nIn July 2022, Century published The Last Boss of Brighton (William Morrow), a true crime book which tells the rise and fall of notorious Belarusian-Jewish mobster Boris Nayfeld as well as the history of Soviet-emigre organized crime in the United States. Kirkus Reviews in a starred review called The Last Boss of Brighton \"a fascinating, page-turning story of a genuine scoundrel. Century thrillingly chronicles Nayfeld’s criminal career, \"True-crime fans will find this one irresistible.\"\nReviewing the book in the Sunday Telegraph Jack Kerridge called The Last Boss of Brighton \"a brilliant, blood-soaked biography ... so enjoyably mayhem-crammed as to make Howard Marks' drug-smuggling memoir Mr Nice read like Barbara Pym... Nayfeld is a fiendishly compelling presence on the page.\"\nIn her January 7, 2023, review in the Globe and Mail, Emily Donaldson opined that it is an \"exciting\" break from true-crime conventions: \"Douglas Century’s The Last Boss of Brighton offers up the sordidly riveting tale of Belarusian heroin trafficker Boris Nayfeld... The stories themselves are as mind-boggling in their extremity as they are disarming in their honesty. As he recounts, in granular detail, crimes ranging from pickpocketing to violent hold-ups to a massive gas-tax swindling scheme that netted him millions, Nayfeld gives us a tour of a parallel criminal world, with all its attendant rules and 'ethics.' Some of The Last Boss’s most head-spinny moments occur when that world intersects with banal aspects of our own.\"\nCritical studies and reviews\n* \"Punching Through\"  Barney Ross reviewed in The New York Times Book Review by Bert Randolph Sugar, February 19, 2006.\n* \"Two-Fisted Hero\" Barney Ross reviewed in The Washington Post by Jonathan Yardley, January 17, 2006.\n* \"A Jew in the Modern World\" Barney Ross reviewed in The New York Sun by Carl Rollyson, February 8, 2006.\n* \"Ice-T, Living Out Loud,\" Ice reviewed in The New York Times Book Review by Baz Dreisinger, April 22, 2011.\n*  Review of The dark art.\nBibliography\n*Street Kingdom: Five Years Inside the Franklin Avenue Posse (New York: Warner Books, 1999), a portrait of hip-hop and gangster subculture set in Brooklyn.\n*Takedown: The Fall of the Last Mafia Empire, (New York: G.P.
