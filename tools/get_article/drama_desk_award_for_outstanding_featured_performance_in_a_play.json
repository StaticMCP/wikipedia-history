From 1975 to 2022, acting awards were presented in eight categories: separate categories by gender; further divided by lead or featured performer; producing four acting awards each for plays and musicals.\nIn 2023, the Drama Desk organization announced that, starting with that year's awards, the eight acting categories had been retired and replaced with four gender neutral categories with twice the winners and nominees: separate categories by lead or featured performer; producing two acting categories each for plays and musicals. The former awards for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play and Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play were merged to create this Outstanding Featured Performance in a Play category.\nWinners and nominees\n;Key\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Year\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Actor\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Title\n! style=\"width:30%;\" |Character\n! style=\"width:10%;\" |Ref.\n|-\n! rowspan=\"13\" |2023\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Miriam Silverman\n|'The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window\n|Mavis Parodus Bryson\n|rowspan=12|\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#DCEEFF\n|Brandon Uranowitz\n|Leopoldstadt\n|Ludwig Jakobovicz / Nathan Fischbein'\n|-\n|Emily Bergl\n|Good Night, Oscar\n|June Levant\n|-\n|Danielle Brooks\n|The Piano Lesson\n|Berniece\n|-\n|Amelda Brown\n|Love\n|Barbara\n|-\n|Ray Fisher\n|The Piano Lesson\n|Lymon\n|-\n|K.
