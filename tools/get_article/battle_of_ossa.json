An insurgent unit under Ludwik Żychliński clashed with a detachment of the Imperial Russian Army.\nPolish forces numbered well over 1,000 men (200 zouaves, 300 riflemen, 600 kosynierzy and additional 200 insurgents who lacked any weapons). They camped at Ossa, and began their military exercises, when on July 10, 1863 at 6 p.m., were attacked by the Russians. The attack was fought off by the zouaves, who, with support of the kosynierzy, managed to break Russian positions. The Russians retreated towards Nowe Miasto nad Pilicą, leaving behind 28 bodies. Polish losses were 4 dead and 16 wounded.\nReferences\nSources\n* Stefan Kieniewicz: Powstanie styczniowe. Warszawa: Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1983. ."
