He is credited to have written the first English grammar books in Odia for the native students.

His father was the Mukhtar of Balasore, while his mother, Begum Muner un nisa was the first cousin of Abdullah Al-Mamun Suhrawardy and Hassan Suhrawardy. Ibrahim was brought up in his maternal home.

Ibrahim later resigned from his post in response to Gandhiji's call for boycotting the posts of British government during the non-cooperation movement. He served as the headmaster of George High School, Sambalpur from 1928 to 1934. Ibrahim later joined the nationalist movement and remained a close associate of Raja Baikuntha Nath Dey.\nHe realised that the native Odia students faced a lot difficulties in understanding the nuances of English language as it was completely alien to them. Thus he wrote and published English grammar books in Odia in order to provide a better understanding of English  language to the students. Both his books were included in the school curriculum of Puri Zilla School.\nHe was also a member of Mohammedan Literary Society. He had participated in the 1930 salt satyagraha at Inchudi led by Gopabandhu Choudhury and had extended a helping hand to the nationalist workers during the civil disobedience movement.
