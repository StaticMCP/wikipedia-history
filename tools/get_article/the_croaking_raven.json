It is the thirty ninth in the long-running series of books featuring Mitchell's best known creation, the psychoanalyst and amateur detective Mrs Bradley.

She is soon drawn in to investigating the suspicious death of the house's last owner who died two years before. On top of everything else the ruins of the castle appear to be haunted by a singing ghost.\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Magill, Frank Northen.
