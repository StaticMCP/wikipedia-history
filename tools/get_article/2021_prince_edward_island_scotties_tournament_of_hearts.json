The winning Suzanne Birt rink represented Prince Edward Island at the 2021 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Calgary, Alberta, and finished with a 4–4, just missing the championship round. The event was held in conjunction with the 2021 PEI Tankard, the provincial men's championship.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, many teams could not commit to the quarantine process in order to compete at the national championship. Clubmates Suzanne Birt and Darlene London were the only two teams to enter the event. Team Birt won the best of five series in just three games.\nTeams\nThe teams are listed as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Skip\n! scope=\"col\"| Third\n! scope=\"col\"| Second\n! scope=\"col\"| Lead\n! scope=\"col\"| Alternate\n! scope=\"col\"| Club\n|-\n| Suzanne Birt || Kathy O'Rourke}} || Meaghan Hughes || Michelle McQuaid || Marie Christianson || Montague Curling Club, Montague\n|-\n| Darlene London || Robyn MacDonald || Shelly Rice || Gail Greene || || Montague Curling Club, Montague\n|}\nResults\nAll draw times are listed in Atlantic Time (UTC−04:00).\nStandings\nFinal Standings\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!width=150|Skip\n!width=20|\n!width=20|\n!width=20|\n!width=20|\n!width=20|\n!width=20|\n!width=20|\n!width=20|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Suzanne Birt || 3 || 0 || 34 || 3 || 14 || 3 || 0 || 9\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Darlene London || 0 || 3 || 3 || 34 || 3 || 14 || 2 || 0\n|}\nDraw 1\nFriday, January 29, 4:00 pm\n|0|0|0|0|0|0|X|X|X|X| |0\n}}\nDraw 2\nSaturday, January 30, 11:00 am\n|2|2|2|0|3|0|3|X|X|X| |12\n}}\nDraw 3\nSaturday, January 30, 4:00 pm\n|1|4|0|3|0|2|X|X|X|X| |10\n| team2 = Darlene London\n|0|0|0|0|1|0|X|X|X|X| |1\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
