At the same time, Azad Khan Afghan marched on Shiraz and defeated local tribal forces near Persepolis, capturing the city with an army of around 12,000 men. Karim Khan then established his base in Kazerun, with support from the townsmen under Ali Qoli Khan Kazaruni and levies from Dashtestan. He also sought assistance from Nasir Khan of Lar, who cautiously maintained neutrality while commanding a sizeable force.\nBattle\nIn September 1754, Azad Khan’s forces advanced on Kazerun. Karim Khan’s smaller army, consisting of Zand troops, townsmen, and Dashtestan levies, was forced to evacuate the town and retreat westward to the village of Khesht near the Kamarej Pass. There, Karim was reinforced by around 4,000 musketeers under Mirza Ali Beg Khurmuji and Raʾis Ahmad Shah Tangestani. The villagers, led by Rostam Soltan, provided supplies and support. Meanwhile, Fath Ali Khan, commanding the bulk of Azad’s army, occupied Kazerun. The Afghan troops massacred much of the remaining population for having supported the Zands, devastating the town and ensuring that it could not serve as a base for resistance.\nAftermath\nFollowing the fall of Kazerun, Azad Khan’s forces advanced towards Khesht, leaving Karim Khan in a precarious position. At this stage, the Zand leader had suffered multiple defeats and faced the real possibility of losing his remaining stronghold. The massacre at Kazerun also discouraged further resistance in the region. Despite these setbacks, Karim Khan would later recover and eventually establish the Zand dynasty as the dominant power in southern Iran.\nReferences"
