The battle ended with a Danish strategic victory but was tactically inconclusive. No ships were lost on either side but many soldiers were either dead or wounded – Sweden: 478, Denmark: 612.\nTiming of events\n*Vice admiral Christen Thomesen Sehested flew his flag from HDMS Justitia as commander of the vanguard of Raben's fleet which was sent on 9 July 1715 to Pomerania to ensure passage of troop transports of 6000 men to the land forces on Rügen besieging Stralsund. (Admiral Knud Reedtz had been assembling these troop transports in Grønsund between the Danish islands of Falster and Møn from midsummer 1714.)\n*On 20 July Admiral Raben, in command of the main Danish fleet, retreated to Øresund (off Copenhagen) when faced with an overwhelming Swedish force until he could be reinforced - leaving Sehested's squadron to occupy the Swedish fleet without engaging them.\n*Before the battle, Sehested had been replaced by vice admiral Just Juel and his flagship, Justitia, was now commanding the rear guard of the Danish fleet. In the battle of 8 August vice admiral Juel was killed.\nAftermath\nThe battle, although inconclusive in naval terms, forced the Swedish fleet to withdraw and allowed the troop transports to proceed. Nydyb was taken on 25 -26 September, the island of Rügen\nsurrendered after the Battle of Stresow on 15 November  and Stralsund itself  two days before Christmas 1715.\nNotes\nReferences\nCitation\n*T.
