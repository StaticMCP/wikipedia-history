The expedition was conducted by the combined navies of Sweden-Norway and Denmark to pressure the Moroccan sultanate into agreeing to the reversal of several old unfair treaties and to put a halt to the annual payment of tribute to Morocco in exchange for safe passage through the Mediterranean. After months of negotiations, the Moroccan sultan, Abd al-Rahman, eventually caved under the pressure from the allied powers in April 1845 in Larache as Morocco was very weak at this time due to them simultaneously fighting in the Franco-Moroccan War. The treaty was later ratified in Stockholm in May.\nStipulations\n* Sweden-Norway pays a final sum of 133 532 riksdalers to Morocco.\n* The payment of an annual tribute to Morocco for safe passage seizes without any repercussions from the sultanate.\n* Morocco does not receive any payments or gifts previously promised by Sweden-Norway and Denmark including 56,000 piasters.\nSee also\n* Moroccan expedition (1843-45)\nReferences"
