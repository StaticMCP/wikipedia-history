It maps the HTTP protocol onto Python's object-oriented semantics. Requests's design has inspired and been copied by HTTP client libraries for other programming languages. It is implemented as a wrapper for urllib3, another third-party Python HTTP library.\nKenneth Reitz, the original author, handed control over to the Python Software Foundation in 2019 after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2015.\nFeatures\nRequests supports TLS/SSL verification, cookies, compression, SOCKS, timeouts, a variety of request methods, and custom headers.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
