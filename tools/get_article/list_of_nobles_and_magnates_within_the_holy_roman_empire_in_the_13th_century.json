The empire was a lot larger than modern day Germany and included the modern day countries Austria, the low countries, large parts of Eastern France, Northern Italy, Slovenia, parts of the northern Baltic, and Switzerland. Although the main culture was Germanic, this was not necessarily a single cultural identity and there were large differences in local dialect. Additionally many foreign cultures had influence on the culture and language of the border territories (France, Italy, Poland, Denmark, Hungary). The structure of the nobility is complicated in that many different titles were used across the empire and do not necessarily mean the same thing in different contexts. It is also complicated because the number of lords holding land directly from the Emperor is so high and each of these lordships functioned as a semi-independent state pursuing their own interests. The vassals of the Emperor would generally have vassals of their own such as Knights, Castellans, and Ministerialis. Occasionally they would have lords as their vassals if they were powerful enough. Sometimes a knight or lord would act as a vogt (an advocate) for a prelate or prince-bishop (a bishop who owns a large fief and has secular rights). These vogts would be responsible for leading the bishops troops and administering justice by the sword (giving them quite a bit of power).  Many of the German nobles did not practice primogeniture and had their estates split between their male heirs, though often they worked together in their common interests.\nThe 13th century was a particularly fragmented time in the history of the Holy Roman Empire due to the great interregnum (1245-1275). Even with one Emperor who had enough land and power to wield kingly power the Holy Roman Empire was split into hundreds of fiefdoms whose holders were often at war with each-other. Although the Empire started off as probably the greatest power in Europe, at the time under Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor who ruled the duchy of Swabia, the kingdom of Sicily, and the kingdom of Jerusalem, Imperial power slowly disintegrated as the pope encouraged anti-kings to curb Frederick's power due to his invasions into northern Italy. When Frederick died in 1250 there were two claimants to the throne: his son Conrad IV, and William II of Holland supported by the pope. Both of these kings died before 1257 and left a massive power vacuum which foreign royalty sought to use to become Emperor (Richard of Cornwall, Alfonso X). Richard of Cornwall was very rich and was able to gain four votes using bribes. He was crowned King of the Romans in Aachen by the Archbishop of Cologne in 1257 while Alfonso never even set foot in Germany. After Richards death in 1272 the powerful Swabian expansionist Count Rudolf I of Germany was elected emperor and reigned until 1291. Following his death the count of Nassau Adolf, King of the Romans took over as king of the Romans. However he was deposed in 1298 by a coalition of powerful nobles spearheaded by the King of Bohemia, the Archbishop of Cologne, and the Margrave of Brandenburg for his aggressive policy in Thuringia. The previous King Rudolf's son Albert I of Germany was elected and the Interregnum finally ended.\nEmperors and emperor claimants\nThe rulers of the Holy Roman Empire were crowned in the city of Aachen as King of the Romans (or King of Germany) by the archbishops of Cologne. Under normal circumstances they would also be crowned as Emperor by the Pope but throughout most of the thirteenth century this was not the case.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!House of Hohenstaufen\n!House of Welf\n!House of Thuringia\n!House of Plantaganet\n!House of Holland\n!House of Ivrea\n!House of Habsburg\n!House of Nassau\n|-\n|Philip of Swabia (1198–1208)\n|Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor (1198–1215)\n|Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia (1246–1247)\n|Richard of Cornwall (1257–1272)\n|William II of Holland (1247–1256)\n|Alfonso X of Castile (1257–1275)\n|Rudolf I of Germany (1272–1291)\n|Adolf, King of the Romans (1292–1298)\n|-\n|Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (1212–1250)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|Albert I of Germany (1298–1308)\n|\n|-\n|Henry (VII) of Germany (1220–1235)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Conrad IV of Germany (1237–1254)\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\nLords with imperial immediacy\nThe Holy Roman empire was essentially a confederacy of rulers who theoretically owed allegiance to the Emperor who was elected from the 7 prince-electors Prince-elector.  From the start of the 13th century there was a dispute between the House of Welf and the House of Hohenstaufen over who was the rightful ruler of the empire which resulted in a fractured empire for most of the 13th century. The main political players within the Holy Roman Empire were the prince-electors, anointed kings, princes, and other palatine lords who wielded large amounts of influence on their vassals and also their smaller neighbors. They were also direct vassals of the emperor himself and possessed palatine powers.
