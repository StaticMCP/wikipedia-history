The 24-date tour began on July 4, 1996 in Phoenix, Arizona and ended August 8, 1996 in Panama City, Florida.\nThe tour featured a main stage and a second stage, on which bands alternated so that as one band finished playing, the band on the other stage would begin. The band lineups and running orders on the two stages differed between dates. Some shows also featured a third stage with additional bands. All shows were held in outdoor venues with the exception of the shows in Washington D.C. and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The former show was originally scheduled for Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland, but due to issues with the venue, the show was moved at the last minute to the much smaller  The Capitol Ballroom nightclub.  The tour headliners included Fishbone, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, NOFX, Pennywise, and Rocket from the Crypt.\nThis was the first Warped Tour for The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, NOFX, Pennywise, and Blink-182, all of which played on multiple future Warped Tours. According to tour founder Kevin Lyman, the addition of punk bands such as NOFX and Pennywise helped establish the tour as a \"credible\" punk festival, thus making it more successful than the first year's eclectic lineup. A 2011 Warped Tour retrospective article in the Dallas Observer deemed the 1996 lineup one of the four best ever Warped Tour lineups in its 17-year history up to that point.\nVans sponsorship\nLyman sought a sponsor after promoters refused to pay for the tour in its second year because the first edition of the tour the year before had not made money. After a planned meeting with Calvin Klein was delayed by a blizzard, he received a call from Vans who wanted to launch an amateur skateboarding contest at the festival. Lyman, who was \"desperate for money to keep the tour going\", convinced them to sponsor the tour for $300,000. Vans later gave Lyman an additional $100,000 to buy back merchandising rights to the tour that he had already sold to another company. With the sponsorship, Lyman said that the tour \"just survived the second year\" and \"paid everyone back from the first year.\"\nBands\n* 311\n* The Alkaholiks\n* Beck\n* Blink 182\n* CIV\n* Dance Hall Crashers\n* Deftones\n* Dick Dale\n* Down By Law\n* Face To Face\n* The Figgs\n* Fishbone\n* Fluf\n* Goldfinger\n* The Mighty Mighty Bosstones\n* NOFX\n* Mushroomhead\n* Pennywise\n* Reel Big Fish\n* Rocket From the Crypt\n* Sense Field\n* Unwritten Law\n* Lagwagon\n* White Kaps\n* The Meices\n* Screaming Bloody Marys\nTour dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! width=\"150\"| Date\n! width=\"150\"| City\n! width=\"150\"| Country\n! width=\"300\"| Venue\n|-\n|July 4, 1996 || Phoenix || rowspan=\"5\"|United States || Desert Sky Pavilion\n|-\n|July 5, 1996 || San Diego || San Diego Sports Arena\n|-\n|July 6, 1996 || Carson || Olympic Velodrome\n|-\n|July 7, 1996 || San Francisco || Crissy Field\n|-\n|July 9, 1996 || Salem || LB Day Amphitheater\n|-\n|July 10, 1996 || Vancouver || Canada || Plaza of Nations\n|-\n|July 11, 1996 || Tacoma || rowspan=\"12\"|United States || Tacoma Dome\n|-\n|July 13, 1996 || Salt Lake City || Utah State Fair\n|-\n|July 14, 1996 || Morrison || Red Rocks Amphitheatre\n|-\n|July 16, 1996 || Bonner Springs || Sandstone Amphitheater\n|-\n|July 19, 1996 || Milwaukee || Eagles Ballroom\n|-\n|July 20, 1996 || Maryland Heights || Riverport Amphitheater\n|-\n|July 21, 1996 || Chicago || United Center\n|-\n|July 22, 1996 || Clarkston || Pine Knob Music Theatre\n|-\n|July 23, 1996 || Pittsburgh || IC Light\n|-\n|July 24, 1996 || Cleveland || Cloverleaf Flea Market\n|-\n|July 25, 1996 || Cincinnati || Riverbend Second Stage\n|-\n|July 26, 1996 || Buffalo || La Salle Park\n|-\n|July 27, 1996 || Bowmanville || rowspan=\"2\"|Canada|| Mosport Park\n|-\n|July 28, 1996 || Montreal || Blue Bonnets (raceway)\n|-\n|July 30, 1996 || Northampton || rowspan=\"8\"|United States || Northampton Airport\n|-\n|July 31, 1996 || Washington, D.C. || The Capitol Ballroom\n|-\n|August 1, 1996 || Camden || Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center\n|-\n|August 2, 1996 || Vernon || Action Park\n|-\n|August 3, 1996 || East Falmouth || Barnstable County Fairgrounds\n|-\n|August 4, 1996 || Asbury Park ||The Stone Pony\n|-\n|August 6, 1996 || Jacksonville ||Metropolitan Park\n|-\n|August 8, 1996 || Panama City || Club LaVela\n|-\n|August 9, 1996 || Cocoa || Cocoa Expo\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
