The memorial became a Grade II* listed building in December 2016 ; the church itself is Grade I listed.\nCommemoration\nThe memorial commemorates 2,130 men from the parish – and the neighbouring City of London parishes of St Peter le Poer and St Benet Fink with which it was merged in 1906 – who served in the British armed forces in the First World War.  About 170 died in the war, listed on a roll of honour kept in the church.\nDescription\nIt was designed by Richard Reginald Goulden; he had served in the Royal Engineers during the war.  A maquette is held by the Imperial War Museum.  The completed  high memorial comprises a Portland stone pylon, topped by a bronze sculptural group cast by the foundry of A.B. Burton in Thames Ditton.  The main figure of the sculpture depicts a standing Archangel Michael with wings erect, wearing Roman segmented armour and a helmet, holding up a flaming sword.  By the angel's right foot are two lions, one biting the other, representing war; by the left foot are four putti looking upwards, representing peace.\nThe angelic figure stands on a cast bronze block, which bears the inscription: .\nUnveiling\nThe memorial was unveiled on 1 November 1920 at a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor of London James Roll, with the Rector of the church Rev John Henry Joshua Ellison, and the Archdeacon of London Ernest Holmes.   \tThe London Troops War Memorial was unveiled outside the Royal Exchange just 11 days later.\nSimilar works by the same artist\nGoulden designed several other war memorials in the 1920s, including the Bank of England War Memorial nearby, others in or near London at Middlesex Guildhall, Redhill and Kingston, and some further afield, at Brightlingsea, Dover, Gateshead, and Malvern.  The Malvern memorial also includes an angelic figure with wings erect; others – such as Redhill, Kingston and Dover – feature a figure without wings but holding an object aloft.\nCopies\nA copy of the St Michael memorial was unveiled in 1927 by Field Marshall Lord Plumer at the Chapeau Rouge crossroads near La Groise in France, on the road from Landrecies to Guise, as a memorial to the 1st Division BEF, which retreated past the location in 1914 and advanced past it again in 1918.  A similar sculpture is the centrepiece of the war memorial of Hornsey County School, Pemberton Road, Harringay, which was moved to St Paul's Church, Harringay in 1970 but damaged in a fire in 1984, and now on display at Hornsey Town Hall.\nFile:Church of St Michael, 2013 (3).JPG|Entrance to St Michael, Cornhill\nFile:War Memorial, Great Malvern - geograph.org.uk - 1005125.jpg|Malvern\nFile:The War Memorial and United Reformed Church - geograph.org.uk - 19393.jpg|Redhill\nFile:Kingston upon Thames War Memorial 01.jpg|Kingston\nFile:Dover war memorial goulden 2.jpg|Dover\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed war memorials in England\nReferences\n* [https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1439646 St Michael's, Cornhill War Memorial], National Heritage List for England, Historic England\n* [http://www.c20society.org.uk/war-memorials/london-memorial-at-st-michael-cornhill/ 20th Century Society]\n* [http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/st-michael-cornhill-ww1-memorial London Remembers]\n* [http://www.victorianweb.org/sculpture/goulden/3.html The Victorian Web]\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/11652 St Michaels Church, Cornhill], Imperial War Museum\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/11190 Maquette for the Memorial at St Michael, Cornhill, City of London], Imperial War Museum\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/11970 Hornsey County School], Imperial War Museum\n* [https://harringayremembers.wordpress.com/war-memorials/old-hornseyans-school-war-memorial/ Old Hornseyans School War Memorial]\n* [http://www.harringayonline.com/forum/topics/an-open-letter-to-claire-kober-about-harringay-s-dislocated-war-m An open letter to Claire Kober about Harringay's dislocated war memorial]"
