Through cost control and production process optimization,The company has gradually become an ODM/OEM supplier for the brands Philips and Electrolux. According to industry statistics, starting in 2004, its vacuum cleaner production and sales ranked among the global leaders, reaching an annual output of 8 million units that year. During this period, the company’s business was heavily reliant on exports, with low brand recognition in the domestic market.\nIn 2009, the company began targeting the domestic market and launched its proprietary brand \"LEXY,\" marking a strategic shift from ODM/OEM to brand operations. In 2011, it introduced the \"Cyclone\" vacuum cleaner, which combined vacuuming and mopping functions. In 2014, the company developed a BLDC vacuum cleaner motor with a speed of up to 80,000 RPM, and launched the Ismart robotic vacuum cleaner product line. In May 2015, Kingclean was listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (stock code: 603355).\nIn the same year as its listing, the company entered the water purification market with its new brand \"Bewinch,\" launching its first product, a smart, installation-free RO reverse osmosis water purifier equipped with a water quality monitoring system. The product line later expanded to include ultrafiltration purifiers and countertop purifiers. The establishment of the Bewinch brand is considered a strategic extension of the company’s efforts to expand into the health appliance sector.\nReferences"
