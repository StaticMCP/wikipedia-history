It connects Estery Street and Nowy Square with Jakuba Street and the area of the Remah Cemetery.\nHistory\nUntil the 19th century, a hospital and an old people's home were located on this street. The name Warszauera Street was established in 1908, derived from the surname of Jonathan Warschauer, a physician and social activist of Jewish origin associated with Kraków. Previously, it was called Ubogich Street.\nBuildings\n* 1 Warszauera Street (8 Estery Street) – Tenement house, early 20th century.\n* 2 Warszauera Street (6 Estery Street) – Tenement house.
