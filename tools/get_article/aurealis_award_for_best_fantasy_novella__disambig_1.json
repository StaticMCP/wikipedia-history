To qualify, a work must have been first published by an Australian citizen or permanent resident between 1 January and 31 December of the corresponding year; the presentation ceremony is held the following year. It has grown from a small function of around 20 people to a two-day event attended by over 200 people.\nSince their creation in 1995, awards have been given in various categories of speculative fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have attracted the attention of publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has identified the award as an honour to be taken seriously.\nThe results are decided by a panel of judges from a list of submitted nominees; the long-list of nominees is reduced to a short-list of finalists. Ties can occur if the panel decides both entries show equal merit, however they are encouraged to choose a single winner. The judges are selected from a public application process by the Award's management team.\nThis article lists all the short-list nominees and winners in the best fantasy novella category. Alan Baxter and Tansy Rayner Roberts share the record for most nominations (3), while Jason Fischer, Stephanie Gunn, Nikky Lee, Kirstyn McDermott, and Angela Slatter follow, each having been nominated twice. This is as of the 2021 Awards, as the winners were announced in late May 2022.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of the story's eligibility; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\" article. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the short story was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\nWinners and joint winners\nNominees on the shortlist\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\"|Year\n! width=\"20%\"|Author(s)\n! width=\"35%\"|Novella\n! width=\"34%\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"Defy the Grey Kings\" || Beneath Ceaseless Skies (#180) ||\n|-\n|  || \"Lodloc and The Bear\" || coeur de lion (Dimension6) || rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|  || \"Broken Glass\" || Ticonderoga Publications (Hear Me Roar)\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Ticonderoga Publications (Bloodlines)\n|-\n|  || \"Haunting Matilda\" || Horror Australis (Cthulhu: Deep Down Under)\n|-\n|  || \"Of Sorrow and Such\" || Tor.com\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"Forfeit\" || (self-published) (The Towers, the moon) ||\n|-\n|  || \"Raven's First Flight\" || Cohesion Press (SNAFU: Black Ops) || rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|  || \"By the Laws of Crab and Woman\" || Review of Australian Fiction (Vol 17, No 6)\n|-\n|  || || Seizure Press\n|-\n|  || \"Burnt Sugar\" || PS Publishing (Dreaming in the Dark)\n|-\n|  || \"Finnegan's Field\" || Tor.com\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || || (self-published) ||\n|-\n|  || || PS Publishing || rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|  ||\"Remnants\" || coeur de lion (Dimension6 11)\n|-\n|  & Kim Wilkins || || Ticonderoga Publications\n|-\n|  || \"Braid\" || Review of Australian Fiction (Vol 24, No 1)\n|-\n|  || || Less Than Three Press\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"\" || Penguin Random House Australia(The Book of Magic)\n|\n|-\n|  || \"This Side of the Wall\" || Metaphorosis Magazine (January 2018) || rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|  || \"Beautiful\" || Ticonderoga Publications (Aurum)\n|-\n|  || || Twelfth Planet Press\n|-\n|  || \"\" || (self-published)(''Mnemo's Memory and Other Fantastic Tales)\n|-\n|  ||  || PS Publishing\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"Scapes Made of Diamond\" || Interzone (#280) ||\n|-\n|  || \"Like Ripples on a Blank Shore\" || Meerkat Press (Cohesion: Stories) || rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Andromeda Spaceways Magazine (#76)\n|-\n|  || \"Out of Darkness\" || Things in the Well (Tales of the Lost Vol 1)\n|-\n|  || \"To Hell and Back\" || Aurealis (#120)\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n|*\n|\"Dingo and Sister\"\n|Andromeda Spaceways Magazine (#78)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Generation Gap\"\n|Clarkesworld (#161)\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\"By Touch and By Glance\"\n|Ticonderoga Publications (Songs for Dark Seasons)\n|-\n|\n|\"Karkinos\"\n|Deadset Press (Cancer)\n|-\n|\n|\n|(self-published)\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" |\n|*\n|\n|Inkprint Press\n|\n|-\n|\n|\"Echo and Narcissus\"\n|Sheep Might Fly\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|IFWG (Coralesque and Other Tales to Disturb and Distract)\n|-\n|\n|\"Mother in Bloom\"\n|13th Dragon Books (The Gulp'')\n|-\n|\n|\n|Falstaff Books\n|}\nSee also\n*Ditmar Award, an Australian science fiction award established in 1969\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://aurealisawards.org/ Aurealis Awards]"
