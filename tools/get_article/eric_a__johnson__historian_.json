Johnson specializes in the history of crime and violence, the Holocaust, and the history of modern Germany.\nEducation\nJohnson was born in Salem, Massachusetts on May 9, 1948. He studied at Brown University and the Stockholm University. In 1976 he received his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania.\nCareer\nJohnson joined Central Michigan University in 1976. He has taught an array of courses, primarily focused on modern Europe, giving lectures especially on the history of Europe, Germany, and the Holocaust, and social science methods and approaches to historical study.\nJohnson has worked at several universities in Europe and held visiting professorships of varying lengths. In the academic year of 1988-1989 Johnson taught at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland as part of an exchange program. Between 1989 and 1995 he was a visiting professor at the Center for Historical Social Research of the University of Cologne. Whilst there, Johnson was in charge of a small research team working on a study of the terror in Nazi Germany.

Fortunately, the dry numbers are leavened with individual portraits, like those of the local Eichmanns, that keep the narrative moving\".\nBooks\n*   2013 - Murder and Violence in Modern Latin America.
