      "text": "# 2025 St. Louis Battlehawks season\n\nThe 2025 St. Louis Battlehawks season is the fourth season for the St. Louis Battlehawks as a professional American football franchise and the second season in the United Football League (UFL). The Battlehawks will play their home games at The Dome at America's Center and will be led by third year head coach Anthony Becht.\nIn 2025, the Battlehawks re-signed 2024 Offensive Player of the Year wide receiver Hakeem Butler for his third stint. In week four, starting quarterback Manny Wilkins was lost for the season when he tore his right achilles tendon against the Arlington Renegades.\nThe Battlehawks finished the season with an 8–2 record, which is the best in the league, and in team history. For the second consecutive year, the Battlehawks hosted the XFL Conference Championship Game, but played the DC Defenders rather than the San Antonio Brahmas. The Battlehawks were defeated, 18-36.\nDraft\nThe UFL held its first draft since the creation of the league on July 17, 2024.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!\n!\n!Player\n!\n!College\n|-\n!1\n!5\n|Chevan Cordeiro\n|QB\n|San Jose State\n|-\n!2\n!13\n|Cody Schrader\n|RB\n|Missouri\n|-\n!3\n!21\n|Pheldarius Payne\n|DE\n|Virginia Tech\n|-\n!4\n!29\n|Bradley Ashmore\n|OT\n|Vanderbilt\n|-\n!5\n!37\n|Carl Jones Jr.\n|LB\n|UCLA\n|-\n!6\n!45\n|Isaiah Coe\n|DT\n|Oklahoma\n|-\n!7\n!53\n|Jelani Baker\n|WR\n|Limestone\n|-\n!8\n!61\n|Jadon Janke\n|WR\n|South Dakota State\n|-\n!9\n!69\n|Myles Sims\n|CB\n|Georgia Tech\n|-\n!10\n!77\n|Myles Jones\n|CB\n|Duke\n|}\nFinal Roster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Inactive=6}}\nStaff\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ style=\";font-weight:bold;\" colspan=\"7\" |St. Louis BattleHawks staff\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:right;\" |\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\" |\n;Front office\n*Director of team operations – Anastasia Ali\n*Director of media relations – Brian Stull\n*General manager – Dave Boller\n;Head coach\n*Head coach – Anthony Becht\n;Offensive coaches\n*Offensive coordinator/Wide receivers – Phil McGeoghan\n*Quarterbacks – Seneca Wallace\n*Running backs/special teams – Kyle Caskey\n*Offensive line – Marc Colombo\n| width=\"35\" |&nbsp;\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n| style=\"font-size: 95%;vertical-align:top;\" |\n;Defensive coaches\n*Defensive coordinator – Donnie Abraham\n*Defensive line – La'Roi Glover\n*Linebackers – Chris Claiborne\n*Secondary – Martin Bayless\n;Team operations\n*Athletic trainer – Eric Avila\n*Equipment manager – Todd Hewitt\n*Video manager – Brendan Taylor\n|}\nSchedule\nAll times Central\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" style=\"\" | Week\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" style=\"\" | Day\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"90\" style=\"\" | Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"90\" style=\"\" | Kickoff\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" style=\"\" | TV\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" style=\"\" | Opponent\n! colspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" style=\"\" | Results\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" style=\"\" | Location\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Attendance\n|-\n! width=\"60\" style=\"\" | Score\n! width=\"60\" style=\"\" | Record\n|-style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n! 1\n| Friday\n| March 28\n| 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| Fox\n| at Houston Roughnecks\n| 31–6\n| 1–0\n| Space City Financial Stadium\n| 7,124\n|-style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n! 2\n| Sunday\n| April 6\n| 5:30&nbsp;p.m.\n| FS1\n| San Antonio Brahmas\n| 26–9\n| 2–0\n| The Dome at America's Center\n| 32,115\n|-style=\"background:#ffcccc\"\n! 3\n| Sunday\n| April 13\n| 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| ABC\n| DC Defenders\n| 15–27\n| 2–1\n| The Dome at America's Center\n| 30,014\n|-style=\"background:#ffcccc\"\n! 4\n| Saturday\n| April 19\n| 11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n| ABC\n| at Arlington Renegades\n| 15–30\n| 2–2\n| Choctaw Stadium\n| 9,614\n|-style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n! 5\n| Saturday\n| April 26\n| 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| ESPN\n| Michigan Panthers\n| 32–27\n| 3–2\n| The Dome at America's Center\n| 30,406\n|-style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n! 6\n| Friday\n| May 2\n| 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| Fox\n| Arlington Renegades\n| 12–6\n| 4–2\n| The Dome at America's Center\n| 26,684\n|-style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n! 7\n| Sunday\n| May 11\n| 2:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| ESPN\n| at Memphis Showboats\n| 19–9\n| 5–2\n| Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium\n| 4,215\n|-style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n! 8\n| Saturday\n| May 17\n| 12:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| Fox\n| Birmingham Stallions\n| 29–28\n| 6–2\n| The Dome at America's Center\n| 30,114\n|-style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n! 9\n| Friday\n| May 23\n| 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| Fox\n| San Antonio Brahmas\n| 39–13\n| 7–2\n| The Dome at America's Center San Antonio was the designated home team for this game.}}\n| 27,890\n|-style=\"background:#ccffcc\"\n! 10\n| Friday\n| May 30\n| 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n| Fox\n| at DC Defenders\n| 13–8\n| 8–2\n| Audi Field\n| 12,624\n|}\nGame summaries\nWeek 1: at Houston Roughnecks\n;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week 1: St. Louis BattleHawks at Houston Roughnecks&nbsp;– Game summary\n|date=\n|time=7:00&nbsp;p.m. CDT\n|road=BattleHawks\n|R1=6|R2=12|R3=0|R4=13\n|home=Roughnecks\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=6\n|stadium=Space City Financial Stadium, Houston, Texas\n|attendance=7,124\n|weather=\n|referee=Kole Knueppel\n|TV=Fox\n|TVAnnouncers=Curt Menefee, Joel Klatt and Brock Huard\n|reference=[https://www.theufl.com/scores/47]\n|scoring=\nFirst quarter\n* STL – Jacob Saylors 4-yard run (2-pt Conversion No Good), 4:44.
