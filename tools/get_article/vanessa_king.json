She plays a troubled girl who accuses her father of sexually abusing her. Tom Barrett of The Vancouver Sun wrote that King's performance \"is remarkable, showing a poise and subtlety beyond the range of most child actors.\" Critic Ray Loynd of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the role was \"very well played ... in a believably spiteful, hateful way\". John Haslett Cuff of The Globe and Mail wrote that she \"so effectively captures the confusion and rebelliousness of the young girl that viewers' doubts about her story are genuine from the beginning.\" The Austin American-Statesman stated, \"The acting is low-key and honest, with young King turning in a powerful performance as the enigmatic child.\" Critic Victor Dwyer, writing in ''Maclean's'', said that King \"does a convincing job as Kelley, portraying the young girl as equal parts crafty and oddly naive, her measured performance giving nothing away.\" The Toronto Star'''s TV critic, Greg Quill, called King's performance \"a stunning debut\".\nFilmography\nFilm\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
