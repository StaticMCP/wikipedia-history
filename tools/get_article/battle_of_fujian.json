By October 1864 around 12,000 pro-Taiping forces commanded by the Shi King Li Shixian had captured Jianning, Shaowu, Tingzhou and Zhangzhou. They held the city for several months until surrendering in the next summer. The Qing recovered territories in Fujian previously lost to the rebels.\nReferences\n* Draft History of Qing"
