It took place on 19 July 1940 in the Mediterranean Sea off Cape Spada, the north-western extremity of Crete.\nPrelude\nThe action occurred when a Commonwealth squadron patrolling the Aegean encountered two Italian cruisers en route from Tripoli to Leros, an Italian colony in the Dodecanese Islands. The Commonwealth squadron was commanded by the Australian Captain John Collins aboard the light cruiser  with the H-class destroyers , , ,  and the similar   of the Royal Navy. The Italian 2nd Cruiser Division was commanded by Vice-Admiral Ferdinando Casardi aboard the fast light cruiser  which included , another light cruiser.\nBattle\nWhen the Italians encountered the Allied destroyers at about 07:30, Sydney and Havock were  to the north on a sweep for submarines. The other destroyers led the Italian cruisers on a chase northwards to give Sydney time to come to the rescue. Sydney sighted the Italians at 08:26, opening fire at 08:29, and the Italian cruisers turned away to the south-west. In the chase that followed, Bartolomeo Colleoni was hit several times by Sydney and a shell tore through her unarmored hull; the boilers and guns were disabled at 09:23, leaving her dead in the water.\nThe crew of Bartolomeo Colleoni fought on but were unable to manoeuvre or use the main armament; despite the fire from her  guns, she was sunk by three torpedoes launched from Ilex and Hyperion at 09:59. Sydney continued to engage Bande Nere. Sydney was hit in the funnel by an Italian shell but hit Bande Nere at least twice, killing eight in the bow and the hangar. Later, Sydney disengaged because she was short of ammunition, Bande Nere returned to Benghazi, shadowed by the battleship  and a screen of destroyers.\nDespite their speed advantage, the Italian cruisers failed to outrun Sydney because they had to steer south-southwest, instead of the most obvious route of escape to the south, to avoid being trapped between their opponents and the Cretan coast. This gave the Australian cruiser the chance to close the range. The light armour of Colleoni and Bande Nere was unable to withstand Sydneys shells. The lack of aerial reconnaissance was another factor contributing to the successful Commonwealth chase.\nFile:HMAS Sydney in 1936 (9916488333607636).jpg|HMAS Sydney (D48) in 1936\nFile:Sailors of the light cruiser HMAS Sydney peer through a hole in a funnel 4166485.jpg|The hole in Sydney's forward funnel\nAftermath\nCasualties\nOf the crew of Bartolomeo Colleoni there were 555 survivors but 121 men, including the captain, Umberto Novaro, died.\nSubsequent operations\nThe British destroyers were bombed by Italian aircraft after the battle, damaging Havock, whose no. 2 boiler was flooded. A floatplane from Warspite, which was searching for Bande Nere, ditched in the sea and was lost near Tobruk, the crew being taken prisoner by the Italians. Allied Convoy AN 2 was ordered to sail back to Port Said and remain there until Bande Nere reached Benghazi.\nOrders of battle\nItaly\n2nd Cruiser Division Regia Marina (Rear-Admiral Ferdinando Casardi)\n* Light cruiser\n**  (sunk)\n**\nCommonwealth\n2nd Destroyer Flotilla Royal Navy (Captain John Collins)\n* Light cruiser\n**\n* Destroyer\n**\n** HMS Havock\n** HMS Hero\n** HMS Hyperion\n** HMS Ilex\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n* |first1=I.
