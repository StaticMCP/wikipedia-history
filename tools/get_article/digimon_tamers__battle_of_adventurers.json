The film was released in Japan on July 14, 2001, as part of Toei Animation Summer 2001 Animation Fair, featuring alongside Mōtto! Ojamajo Doremi: The Secret of the Frog Stone and Kinnikuman: Second Generation films.\nThe film takes place during the Tamers' summer vacation, where Mephistomon sends Digimon to invade the Real World through a virus called the \"V-Pet\".\nThe film marks the first film for Digimon Tamers, and was followed by Runaway Locomon (2002).\nPlot\nAs Takato and Henry arrive at Okinawa for their summer trip, they part ways as Takato stays with his cousin Kai and his grandfather, while Henry visits the underwater ruins offshore. Meanwhile, Rika, who's staying home in Tokyo, fights a Pteramon at an oil plant, with her and Renamon noticing a suspicious motive for its attacks. The next morning, Takato, Kai, and Guilmon save a girl named Minami from Tylomon. Minami explains to Takato later that night that she was being chased by many Digimon, because her laptop carried an original prototype V-Pet. Much later, Scorpiomon and Divermon tries to capture Minami, but Seasarmon appears from the laptop screen and saves her, but Mantaraymon escapes with Minami.\nMeanwhile, V-Pets are causing technical viruses around the globe, and taking over the entire computer system. Takato and the others goes to an island where Minami is held captive. Inside, Minami's father reveals that the prototype is carrying a vaccine program, and Tameshiro, the head of the V-Pet manufacturing company, is revealed to be a Digimon named Mephistomon that sent the Digimons to capture Minami. As Seasarmon tries to attack Mephistomon, he is bested and de-evolves to Labramon, resembling Minami's late puppy, Mei. Henry and Rika arrives via Omegamon's help, who've revealed that it has been hunting for Mephistomon from the beginning.\nTakato and the others fight and seemingly deletes Mephistomon, while Minami's cry over Labramon's death activates the vaccine, which cures the computer system over the world. Mephistomon evolves into Gulfmon and overpowers the partner Digimon. Calumon enables the partner Digimons to Ultimate-levels and defeats Gulfmon, setting everything back to normal.\nVoice cast\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Character !! Japanese voice cast !!
