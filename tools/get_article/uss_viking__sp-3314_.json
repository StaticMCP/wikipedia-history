Caesar later was renamed Viking while under private ownership. She operated at Norfolk, Virginia, while in private use.\nOn 5 September 1918, the U.S. Navy inspected Viking for possible naval service, and on 24 September 1918 acquired her from her owner, Mrs. E. S. Wood, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She served as USS Viking (SP-3314), probably in a non-commissioned status.\nAssigned to the 5th Naval District, Viking operated in the vicinity of Norfolk, presumably on patrol duties, at least through the end of World War I.\nOn 2 February 1919, the United States Secretary of the Navy authorized the Commandant of the 5th Naval District to dispose of Viking as junk. She was stricken from the Navy List on 19 February 1919 and sold on 20 February 1919.\nReferences\n*\n*[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/OnlineLibrary/photos/sh-civil/civsh-v/viking15.htm Department of the Navy Naval History and Heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images: Civilian Ships: Viking (American Motor Boat, 1915).
