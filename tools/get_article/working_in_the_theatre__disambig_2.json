The series profiles notable members of the industry, and provides a closer look at unique stories and important work. Working in the Theatre aims to inform audiences about typically less well-known aspects of the theatre by sharing The Wing's extensive knowledge of the industry. The series has been running for more than four decades, and has featured extraordinary work from numerous members of the industry. Working in the Theatre receives leadership support from Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and The Dorothy Strelsin Foundation. The series is also supported, in part, by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.\nHistory\nWorking in the Theatre was initially broadcast from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, led by Wing chair at the time Isabelle Stevenson, and moderated by various board members. Until 2005, the series was only available for viewing on CUNY-TV, a local New York City television station, or at a few NYC libraries. In March 2005 it was announced that The Wing would be releasing Working in the Theatre episodes for free streaming online.\nCurrent production\nIn July 2017, The Wing was $60,000 in National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grants, $25,000 of which will directly support Working in the Theatre.\nEpisode list\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season\n!Episodes\n|-\n|46\n| Camden Rep; Direction and Writing - Appropriate; Circus Arts, Acrobats & Choreo - Water for Elephants;\n|-\n|45\n| Setting the Show - The Year of Magical Thinking; Direction and Design - The Piano Lesson; The Neo-Futurists;\n|-\n|44\n| Phantom Returns;Live: Company Part 1 and 2; Pressing On - Girl From the North Country; Taking Chances - Titanique The Musical;\n|-\n|-\n|43\n| A Community Comes Together - Carnegie Mellon University; Radial Park at Hallets Point; The Seagull on the Sims 4; Irish Rep - Together in Isolation; Ratatouille on TikTok;\n|-\n|42\n| Creating in Quarantine; Play at Home; The 24 Hour Plays Viral Monologues; Creating the Show; Virtual Theatre in the Classroom, American Conservatory Theater; Virtual Theatre in the Classroom, SUNY New Paltz\n|-\n|41\n| Orchestrations; Odd Jobs 2; Specialty Props; Expansive Technology; Documentary Theatre; Devised Theatre; Before the Show: Zulema Clares\n|-\n|40\n| Adaptation; Odd Jobs; D.I.Y.
