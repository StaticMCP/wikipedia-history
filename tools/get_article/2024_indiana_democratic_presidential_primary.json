Incumbent President Joe Biden was the only candidate who met the requirements. \"Uncommitted\" did not appear on the ballot and write-in votes were not allowed. This was the second contest in the Democratic Party where there was one candidate on the ballot since the Alaska caucuses.\nResults\nSee also\n* 2024 Indiana Republican presidential primary\n* 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* 2024 United States presidential election in Indiana\n* 2024 United States elections\nReferences"
