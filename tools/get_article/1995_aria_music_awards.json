There had been a 18-month gap since the previous award ceremony which was moved to be \"closer to the business end of the music industry's year\" and so reflect that year's works. Presenters distributed 28&nbsp;awards from 1060&nbsp;eligible submissions. Big winners for the year were Silverchair with five&nbsp;awards and Tina Arena with four, including Album of the Year and Song of the Year – both first time they were won by a female.\nIn addition to previous categories, the former category Best Pop/Dance Release was split into Best Pop Release and Best Dance Release. Another new category Best World Music Album was also presented for the first time. The ARIA Hall of Fame inducted: The Seekers.\nCeremony details\nPresenters and performers\nThe ARIA Awards ceremony was hosted by radio and TV personality Richard Stubbs.

The jargon term, ecstasy, for a psychoactive drug was bleeped for the TV broadcast. In 2005 Mac explained that he did not expect to win and so had no speech prepared.\nAwards\nFinal nominees are shown, in plain, with winners in bold.\nARIA Awards\n*Album of the Year\n**'Tina Arena –
