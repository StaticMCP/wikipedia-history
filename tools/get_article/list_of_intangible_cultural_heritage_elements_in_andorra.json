As part of a country's cultural heritage, they include celebrations, festivals, performances, oral traditions, music, and the making of handicrafts. The \"intangible cultural heritage\" is defined by the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, drafted in 2003 and took effect in 2006. Inscription of new heritage elements on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists is determined by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, an organisation established by the convention.\nAndorra ratified the convention on 8 November 2013.\nIntangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\nRepresentative List\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n! style=\"width:25%\" | Name\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Image\n!
