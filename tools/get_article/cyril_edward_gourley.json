He was mobilised with his unit on the outbreak of war in August 1914 and went with it to the Western Front in September 1915. His battery was transferred to CCLXXVI (276) Brigade in 1916. In September 1917, he was serving near Ypres and was awarded the Military Medal for conspicuous gallantry in putting out a fire near an ammunition dump.\nVictoria Cross\nGourley was 24 years old, and a sergeant in D (Howitzer) Battery of 276th (West Lancashire) Brigade, RFA, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.\nOn 30 November 1917 at Little Priel Farm, east of Epehy, France, during the Battle of Cambrai, Sergeant Gourley was in command of a section of howitzers of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division. During an enemy advance, when their forces were within a few hundred yards of him, both to the front and on one flank, and though plagued by snipers, Sergeant Gourley managed to keep one gun firing. At one point he pulled the gun out of the pit and engaged a machine-gun at 500 yards, knocking it out with a direct hit. All day he held the Germans in check, firing over open sights on enemy parties, thereby saving his guns, which were withdrawn at nightfall.\nThe citation for his VC reads:\n}}\nGourley was originally denied an officer's commission due to \"defective eyesight\", but, after being made a second lieutenant in the RFA, later rose to the rank of captain.\nPost-war\nFrom 1919, Gourley worked for Lever Brothers, travelling widely to open up new business for the company. On his retirement a director of the company spoke of \"...his quiet, gentle courteousness and his readiness to do all he could for other people. In fact he was a jolly good man to have beside you when you were in trouble\". In 1925, the Gourley family moved to Hill Close, School Lane, off Column Road, Grange, West Kirby; the house was later renamed Gourley Grange and the lane renamed Gourley's Lane in his honour. The gardens created by the Gourley family have now been redeveloped as a small housing estate.\nDuring the Second World War, Gourley was a firewatcher in Liverpool, and dealt with many of the air raids on Liverpool.\nIn 1952, Gourley, \"a modest, kindly and courteous gentleman\", moved to Haslemere, Surrey, where he died on 31 January 1982, at the age of eighty-nine. He is buried in Grange Cemetery, West Kirby, Wirral. Gourley never married.\nThe Trustees of The Cyril Edward Gourley Victoria Cross Endowment, Registered Charity 525987, set up in his honour after the First World War from local donations, provide grants to University Students who attended schools, or reside in the Hoylake and West Kirby area, subject to certain conditions.\nThe medal\nHis VC, along with his other medals which include the Croix de Guerre, is held by the Royal Artillery Museum.\nFootnotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n* Anon, History of the 359 (4th West Lancs.)
