According to WorldCat, the book is held in 725 libraries.\nHe became interested in totem poles at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in Seattle in 1909 and later traveled to southeast Alaska and eventually lived there. He lived and taught in native villages for about 15 years, and became  working \"in the Indian service,\" as he put it (meaning perhaps employment with the Bureau of Indian Affairs), living mainly among the Tlingit and Haida people.\nHe was Curator and Librarian at the Alaska Historical Library and Museum from 1941.\nBibliography\n* Monuments in Cedar.
