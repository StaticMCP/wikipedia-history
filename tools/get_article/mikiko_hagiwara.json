She won a silver medal with the Japan women's national basketball team at the 1994 Asian Games. Hagiwara also competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics, where Japan's team came in seventh place. Hagiwara would also play in the WNBA for one year from June 1997 to July 1998.\nHagiwara was drafted by the Sacramento Monarchs with the 14th pick in the WNBA Elite Draft. Her WNBA debut took place on June 21, 1997 in a 73 - 61 win over the Utah Starzz where she recorded 3 points in 16 minutes of playing time. She was traded to the Phoenix Mercury on July 31, 1997 and played 12 games for them, averaging 2.8 points and 1.2 rebounds. She remained with the Mercury partially for the 1998 season, playing 10 games for them between June 26 - July 20, 1998 but played significantly fewer minutes (5.9 minutes per game) and averaged 2.2 points.\nHagiwara was waived by the Mercury on July 31, 1998 (exactly one year after being traded to the team) and would never play in the WNBA afterwards. Her final WNBA game was played on July 20, 1998 in a 88 - 67 win over her former team, the Sacramento Monarchs.
