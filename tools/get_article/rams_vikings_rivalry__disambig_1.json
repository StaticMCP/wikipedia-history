To-date, the Vikings are the Rams second most played playoff opponent with eight games and the Rams are the most played playoff opponent for the Vikings.\nThe Vikings lead the overall series, 27–20–1. The two teams have met eight times in the playoffs, with the Vikings holding a 5–3 lead.\nNotable moments and games\n* The 1972 game was the highest-scoring game of the year for both of those teams, as Fran Tarkenton of the Vikings threw for 319 yards and four touchdowns. For his part, Roman Gabriel of the Rams would complete 25 passes in the game, which at that time was his second-highest career total ever in that category.\n* Playing inside a mud-soaked Los Angeles Coliseum in the divisional round of the '77 playoffs, the Vikings jumped out to a 14–0 lead before holding on for a 14–7 victory. Despite the mud, both teams found considerable traction in their running games. Rams running back Lawrence McCutcheon and Vikings running back Chuck Foreman each rushing for over 100 yards.\n*In 1985, it was a defensive battle, as all of the first half scoring came on two Rams field goals to give them a 6–0 lead. Eric Dickerson then scored a touchdown in the third quarter to make it 13–0. The Vikings mounted a bit of a comeback, scoring on a Ted Brown touchdown run and a Jan Stenerud field goal, but it wasn't quite enough as the Rams held on to win 13–10.\n*In 2015, the Vikings defeated the Rams 21–18 in overtime following an illegal hit to Minnesota quarterback Teddy Bridgewater by Rams' cornerback Lamarcus Joyner. Mike Zimmer famously declined receiving the ball in overtime after winning the toss due to favorable wind conditions for a possible game-winning kick. The Vikings ended up stopping the Rams, getting the ball, and kicking a game winning field goal.\nConnections between the two teams\nShortly after the Rams won Super Bowl LVI, the Vikings hired Rams offensive coordinator Kevin O'Connell as their new head coach following the firing of Zimmer at the end of the season. O'Connell brought several assistants from the Rams to work with him in Minnesota, with the most notable one being current Vikings offensive coordinator and former Rams tight end coach Wes Phillips.\nSeason-by-season results\n;|title=Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams vs. Minnesota Vikings Season-by-Season Results}}\n;|title=1960s (Vikings, 9–6–1)|Season||at Los Angeles Rams |at Minnesota Vikings||Notes}}\n|-\n|\n|\n|style=\"| Rams  31–17\n|style=\"| Vikings  42–21\n| Tie  1–1\n| Vikings join the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team and are placed in the Western Conference.\n|-\n|\n|style=\"|\n|style=\"| Vikings  38–14\n| Tie  24–24\n| Vikings  2–1–1\n| Game in Los Angeles is the Vikings' first road win in franchise history.
