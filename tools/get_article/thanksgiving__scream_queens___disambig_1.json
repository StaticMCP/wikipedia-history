LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A−, citing \"Again—and I can’t stress this enough—the episode is fun. Humor is apart [sic] of that, but it’s really an enjoyable episode to watch from top to bottom.\" IGN's Terri Schwartz gave the episode 8.5 out of 10 and said, \"Scream Queens was losing me for a while, but the twist that Wes is the father of the bathtub girl's twins genuinely surprised me, and added a fun new, personal layer to the Red Devil Killer(s) mystery. Add that to a fun game of who-dunn-it and the introduction of the absolutely hatable Radwells and this was a great return to form for the FOX series.\"\nReferences"
