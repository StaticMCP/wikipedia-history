He also established the first Ahl al-Hadith mosque at Zaldagar, Srinagar in 1897, where he served as imam.\nHe wrote Islamic poetry in Persian and Kashmiri language, including Taleem Sunnat and Basharatul Mumineen; his later works include Dewan Anwar and Guldasta Anwari, a Kashmiri poetic collection.\nBiography\nHe was born in the Shopian district of Jammu and Kashmir. He received his basic islamic education outside the state and is believed to have studied under Hafiz Abdul Manan Wazirabadi, a prominent Muslim scholar of the period.\nAfter completing his education, he returned to the Kashmir Valley and traveled across several regions, including Kishtwar and Turtuk, Nubra, and Ladakh, to propagate a puritan form of Islam.\nCriticism and controversy\nAnwar's teachings, particularly his criticism of shrine veneration and clerical authority, drew opposition from religious leaders. He criticized clerics, reportedly stating that \"mullas are misleading people.\" He was reportedly involved in several legal cases and was charged under the blasphemy law for allegedly insulting revered shrines and Sunni practices, though later released. He was also imprisoned at different times on accusations of inciting sectarian discord.\nFirst period (1857–1890)\nDuring the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh (1857–1885), the Wahhabi movement began to influence Kashmir. According to Walter Roper Lawrence in The Valley of Kashmir, the Maharaja closely monitored reformist groups and often imprisoned their activists.\nAround this time, Anwar traveled to undivided Punjab for further studies, where he met Islamic scholars from Bengal, including Molana Yaqoub of Dinajpur (now in Bangladesh), an admirer of Shah Ismail Shaheed Dehlvi. This period marked a turning point in his intellectual development. After returning to Kashmir, he preached a puritanical interpretation of Islam and opposed practices such as shrine veneration, which he referred to as \"asthana wa qabar parasti\" (\"worship of shrines and graves\"). His views provoked opposition, and there were reportedly several unsuccessful attempts on his life.\nThe Kashmiri literary figure Akhtar Mohiuddin later described him in Indian Literature (Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi):\nMolvi Anwar Shah of Shopian belonged to the Wahhabi sect of Muslims. His poetry was devoted to religious themes and his creed. While he versified hadith and Islamic codes of conduct, he denounced grave worship and superstition. He urged people to fear none but Allah and wrote satires against outdated customs, often targeting clerics whom he accused of preaching superstition instead of true religion.\nSecond period (1890–1939)\nBy the early 20th century, Anwar had gained support for his movement, and in 1912 the first Ahl-i Hadith mosque in Kashmir was built at Zaldagar, Srinagar. He later visited Qadian in Punjab, where he met Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement, and opposed his prophetic claims. After returning to Kashmir, he actively campaigned against the Ahmadis, who were commonly referred to by opponents as \"Qadianis.\"\nThe Kashmiri political leader Molana Mohammad Sayeed Masudi later wrote of him:\nHad Molana Anwar not been active in Kashmir, the southern part of the valley would have professed the Qadiyani faith. It was his spirit and endeavour which blocked the activities of the Qadiyanis.\nWorks\n* Dewan-e-Anwar (A collection of poems in the form of anthology according to Arabic alphabetical order) published in 1935 in Lahore.\n* Taleem-e-Sunnat (The only versified book in Kashmiri language which provides you the way of life in the light of Hadith.
