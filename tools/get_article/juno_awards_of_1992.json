Rick Moranis was the host for the ceremonies, which were broadcast on CBC Television from 9 pm Eastern.\nNominations were announced on 12 February 1992. Bryan Adams was nominated in 7 categories setting a Juno record, while Tom Cochrane received nominations in 6.\nAdams sparked controversy in the Canadian music industry several months earlier when he openly criticised Canadian content regulations when his album project, Waking Up the Neighbours, was disqualified as Canadian for radio airplay purposes. That album was created largely with the help of non-Canadian producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, therefore the songs fell below the legal Canadian content threshold. However, Adams qualified for the 1992 Juno nominations as an individual Canadian citizen. The 1992 Juno Awards thus became viewed as a showdown between Adams and Tom Cochrane, as the latter met Canadian content requirements.\nWhen all the 1992 Juno Awards were presented, Tom Cochrane was the major winner with 4 Junos, compared to 3 for Adams. 1992's awards also featured an unprecedented three-way tie for winners in the Best Jazz Album category.\nNominees and winners\nCanadian Entertainer of the Year\nDetermined by public ballot.\nWinner: Bryan Adams\nOther Nominees:\n* Blue Rodeo\n* Celine Dion\n* Colin James\n* The Tragically Hip\nBest Female Vocalist\nWinner: Celine Dion\nOther Nominees:\n* Lee Aaron\n* Loreena McKennitt\n* Sarah McLachlan\n* Mitsou\nBest Male Vocalist\nWinner: Tom Cochrane\nOther Nominees:\n* Bryan Adams\n* Bruce Cockburn\n* Maestro Fresh-Wes\n* Robbie Robertson\nMost Promising Female Vocalist\nWinner: Alanis\nOther Nominees:\n* Kerri Anderson\n* Meryn Cadell\n* Darby Mills\n* Chrissy Steele\nNote: Julie Masse was originally nominated here but was disqualified prior to the awards because her album was deemed to have been released 21 August 1990.
