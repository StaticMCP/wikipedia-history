Seering bought Kingsbarns' dam Lady Tapit for $675,000 who was offered at the 2013 Keeneland September Yearling Sale and raced her before her career came to an abrupt halt after a training accident. Kingsbarns was the second foal from Lady Tapit. His sire Uncle Mo since entering stud in 2012, stands for $150,000 at Ashford Stud in Versailles, Kentucky has been among the top sires in the Northern Hemisphere. As of April 2024 he ranks 20th overall in lifetime progeny earnings.\nKingsbarns sold for $250,000 at the 2021 Saratoga Select Yearling Sale to Tom McCrocklin as an agent for Champion Equine. He was then pinhooked and sold to Spendthrift Farm for $800,000 at the 2022 March Fasig-Tipton Two-Year-Olds in Training Sale.\nKingsbarns was trained by US Hall of Fame trainer Todd A. Pletcher.\nKingsbarns was retired in August 2024 after straining a leg ligament in training, and will stand the 2025 breeding season at Spendthrift.\nStatistics\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; font-size:85%\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Distance\n! scope=\"col\" | Race\n! scope=\"col\" | Grade\n! scope=\"col\" | Track\n! scope=\"col\" | Odds\n! scope=\"col\" | Field\n! scope=\"col\" | Finish\n! scope=\"col\" | WinningTime\n! scope=\"col\" | Winning(Losing)Margin\n! scope=\"col\" | Jockey\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref\n|-style=\"background-color:white\"\n|align=\"left\" colspan=12|2023 – Three-year-old season\n|-\n|\n|  1 mile\n|  Maiden Special Weight\n|\n| Gulfstream Park\n| 3.00*\n| 11\n| 1\n| 1:39.18\n|  lengths\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n| 1 mile & 40 yards\n|  Allowance Optional Claiming\n|\n| Tampa Bay Downs\n|0.50*\n| 7\n| 1\n| 1:40.78\n|    lengths\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|   miles\n| Louisiana Derby\n| II\n| Fair Grounds\n|4.50\n| 12\n| 1\n| 1:57.33\n|   lengths\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|   miles\n| Kentucky Derby\n| I\n| Churchill Downs\n|11.72\n| 18\n| 14\n| 2:01.57\n|  ( lengths)\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|   miles\n| Pegasus Stakes\n| Listed\n| Monmouth Park\n|0.50*\n| 6\n| 2\n| 1:57.73\n|  (neck)\n|\n|\n|-style=\"background-color:white\"\n|align=\"left\" colspan=12|2024 – Four-year-old season\n|-\n|\n|  7 furlongs\n|  Allowance Optional Claiming\n|\n| Gulfstream Park\n|0.60*\n| 8\n| 1\n| 1:22.47\n|    length\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|   miles\n| Ben Ali Stakes\n| III\n| Keeneland\n|1.68*\n| 9\n| 1\n| 1:57.74\n|    lengths\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|   miles\n| Pimlico Special\n| III\n| Pimlico\n|0.70*\n| 7\n| 2\n| 1:57.73\n|  ( length)\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|   miles\n| Stephen Foster Stakes\n| I\n| Churchill Downs\n|9.95\n| 8\n| 1\n| 1:48.09\n|    lengths\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes:\nAn (*) asterisk after the odds means Kingsbarns was the post-time favorite.\nPedigree\n}}\nReferences"
