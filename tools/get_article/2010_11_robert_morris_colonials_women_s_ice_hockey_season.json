The following day, she registered a pair of goals Saturday to help the Colonials come back from an early deficit to claim a 2-2 tie. With her two points on Friday, Delaney has moved into second place on the all-time RMU points list and finished the weekend with 78 points for her career.\n*December 10–11: Imbrogno recorded a goal in both of the Colonials games. In the two game series, she led the team in shots on goal (9) and shooting percentage (.222) while tying for the team lead with a +2 plus/minus.\n*January 21–22: Despite the Colonials being swept by Mercyhurst, Thea Imbrogno collected a goal and an assist in the series.

In the January 21st defeat, Brianna Delaney registered her team-leading seventh multi-point game of the season. She had a goal and an assist in the 6-3 setback. It was her 22nd career multi-point game which allowed her to become the first player in Robert Morris history to tally three 20-point seasons in her career. In addition, she also combined with her younger sister, Cobina, to assist on a goal for the second time this season.\n*January 8, 2011: Against the University of Connecticut Huskies, Brianna Delaney scored the first two goals of the game. Both goals were assisted by her sister Cobina Delaney. This was the first time in their careers at Robert Morris that Cobina had assisted on a goal by Brianna. Both goals were scored within eight minutes of the game. With the two goals, Brianna became just the second Colonial to surpass the 80 point plateau in her career. In addition, she became just the third Colonials player to score 40 career goals as her second goal of the game was the 40th of her Robert Morris University career. In addition, it was the 21st multi-point game of her career.\n*January 9, 2011: In the second consecutive game versus Connecticut, Brianna picked up a third period assist to break the all-time Robert Morris University school record for assists in a career.
