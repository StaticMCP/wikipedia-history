But Mughals had not granted any written deeds for these Parganas. After death of Maharana Amar Singh II, Bahadur Shah granted Pur Mandal to Ranbaz Khan Mewati in Feb-March, 1711 AD. Ranbaz Khan moved with his own army, along with 5-7 thousand-strong force sent by Mir Bakhshi Zulfikar Khan, to take control of the territory.\nPreparation\nNews of invasion reached Udaipur and Maharana Sangram Singh - II dispatched a large army, consisting of various chiefs of Mewar:\n* Devbhan Chauhan of Kotharia\n* Umaid Singh of Shahpura\n* Jai Singh of Badnor\n* Rawat Maha Singh of कानोड़\n* Rawat Surat Singh, brother of Rawat Maha Singh\n* Rawat Sangram Singh of Deogarh\n* Samant Singh of Salumbar\n* Surajmal Solanki of Desuri\n* Rawat Gangdas of Baansi\n* Suraj Singh Rathore of Limara\n* Devi Singh Chundawat of Begun\n* Hathi Singh Dodiya\n* Prithviraj Chundwat of Amet\n* Sahab Singh Rathore, ancestor of Rathores of Rupaheli\n* Surat Singh Mertiya of Ghanerao\n* Kothari Bhim Singh of Begun\nBattle\nMughal and Mewari forces met near Khari river. Mughal forces had archers on elephants and horses. Attack of Mewar forces was so quick, that the Mughal archers could draw only once and the Mewar cavalry reached very near and hand-to-hand combat ensued.\nMaha Singh of Kanore fell in the battle, Jai Singh of Badnore and Samant Singh of Salumbar were wounded in the battle. Rao of Begun had sent his Kamdar, Kothari Bhim Singh of Begun, who fought on the battlefield of Bandanwara with great vehemence and vigour, he fell in the battle fighting bravely. Ranzbaz Khan, along with his brother Nahar Khan and other close relatives, were killed in the battle. Mughal forces suffered massive casualties and were defeated. Deendar Khan fled with remaining army to Ajmer, his camp was captured by Mewari forces. With this battle, Mewar succeeded to retain its control on this territory.\nMewar Bhupal Infantry(currently known as 9th Grenadiers (Mewar), had the Battle of Bandanwara (1711) listed on its state forces colours, before it was merged into Indian Army.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
