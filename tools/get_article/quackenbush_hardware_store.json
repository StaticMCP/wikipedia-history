The store opened in 1903 under the name '''J. W. Quackenbush's''', selling farm implements, hardware, and horse-drawn vehicles. Gradually the inventory shifted to kitchen items and dinnerware, toys, and gift items. The store closed in 1980.\nThe 1.5-story building is of red brick construction in an American stretcher bond, commercial style characterized by large display windows on the ground floor. The architect and builder are unknown. In 1969 the building was saved from urban renewal demolition by a group of concerned citizens.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Lane County, Oregon\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
