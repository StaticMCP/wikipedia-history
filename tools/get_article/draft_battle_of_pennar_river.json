This conflict was part of the larger struggle of the declining but tenacious Vijayanagara state and the emergent Deccan Sultanates. The battle is especially remarkable for the desperate resistance offered by the imperial Vijayanagara forces commanded by their general Ramaiya against an army from the Golconda placed at a numerical disadvantage led to the victory of Vijayanagara forces and rout of Qutb shahis.\n}}\n*Vijayanagara Empire extended till Tungabhadra River\n| combatant1        = Vijayanagara Empire\n**Recherla Nayakas\n**Thanjavur Nayaks\n**Pemmasani Nayaks\n| combatant2        = Qutub Shahi dynasty\n| commander1        = Venkatapati RayaRaghunatha NayakJagadeva RayaManuprajPapia SamywarPavia ChittiGulrang Setti\n| commander2        = Muhammad Qutub ShahRustam KhanKhasim Khan\n| strength1         = 50,000–100,000\n| strength2         = *20,000 Persian arquebusiers\n*15,000 Ottoman artillery\n*40,000 Deccani infantry\n*25,000 Arab  mercenaries\n----\nTotal : 100,000\n| casualties1       = 3000\n| casualties2       = 88,000\n| image             = Vijayanagar under Venkatapati Deva Raya II.jpg\n| caption           = Vijayanagar under Venkatapati Deva Raya\n}}\nBackground\nVenkatapati Raya  was the fourth and the youngest son of the Emperor Tirumala Deva Raya and his Queen-consort Vengalamba and the younger brother of the Emperor Sriranga Deva Raya. He served as the governor of Chandragiri and the Viceroy of Tamil Country before ascending the throne of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1585.\nA Grant dated to 1589 mentions that Venkatapati Raya came into conflict with Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda, as soon as former was coronated as emperor . The causes of the conflict were the ambitions of reclaiming the lost territories of Vijayanagara during the reign of Raya's predecessors.\nPrelude\nUndaunted as he was , bold in his actions Venkatapati Raya made some serious incursions in Qutub Shahi dominions, forcing Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of Golconda to take actions against Vijaynagar in 1586 besieging its at the time present base of Penukonda. Despite the ferocious efforts made by Qutb Shahi forces to capture the fort , the garrison led by Govinda Raja and Pavya Chitti prevailed in repulsing the besiegers. In the mean time  , Raghunatha, the son of Achyuta Nayaka of Thanjavur came with a relief force to Penukonda.\nThe upcoming downpour which would widen the Krishna river bed cutting off the communication lines of Golkonda's army to its base and reinforcements from Thanjavur compelled Muhammad to retreat leaving a few troops behind who were immediately defeated and unalived by Raghunatha and Venkatapati Raya joined by Penukoda's garrison.\nBattle\nVenkata took the chance given to him from the absence of Muhammad Qutb Shah to mount a serious campaign of reconquest of Gandikota. Venkata’s Vijayanagara army laid siege to Gandikota while the Qutb Shahi army struck at Cuddappah, finding stiff resistance. After a series of inconclusive skirmishes the two sides engaged in a stalemate.\nIn order to assist his commander Murtaza Khan at Gandikota, Qutb Shah sent reinforcements under Rustum Khan. The two armies set up camp on opposite banks of the Pennar. During this time, a decorated bull from the Vijayanagara camp charged into the Qutb Shahi lines, while Rustum Khan was reportedly startled and began to retreat in confusion and panic. With the Golconda camp under siege, the Vijayanagara army mounted a ferocious assault. Murtaza Khan’s actions gave many of his men the chance to run away, but the Qutb Shahis suffered a crushing defeat, losing their camp and the royal umbrella. The army fleeing Golconda was pursued in full flight.\nAftermath\nTo further consolidate his position, Venkata Deva compelled Muhammad Qutb Shah to agree to a stringent treaty that designated the River Krishna as the frontier separating their realms. Seeking to restore his damaged prestige, Muhammad launched a campaign against Kalahasti, encountering only weak resistance from local forces. He plundered wealth, desecrated a temple, and returned to Golconda. Although the expedition offered little in terms of strategic or political gains, it was publicly declared a success.\nReferences"
