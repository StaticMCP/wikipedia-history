This marked the second straight year that the ceremony was scheduled for a Monday; while it was described as an \"unusual\" move, since only NBC typically aired the Emmys on Mondays since 2014 (due to NBC Sunday Night Football''), it would prevent the broadcast from interfering with potential overruns by Fox's Sunday afternoon football coverage. The ceremony was produced by Jesse Collins Entertainment, taking over for Done and Dusted and Hudlin Entertainment, with Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon, and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay serving as producers.\nDue to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike that began on May 2, 2023, the Television Academy allowed companies to cancel scheduled For Your Consideration events without penalty. Members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) were also told to not attend promotional events while the strike was ongoing. The 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike then began on July 14. The Television Academy reportedly planned to postpone the ceremony should either strike continue into August (following the postponement of the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards, which was originally scheduled earlier for June 16). The last time the Primetime Emmys were delayed was in 2001 following the September 11 attacks. The Television Academy first told vendors in late July that the ceremony would be delayed, though no official announcement was made at the time. According to several reports, the Television Academy preferred a November makeup date, while Fox preferred a January date due to fall broadcast commitments.\nOn August 10, the ceremony was officially rescheduled for January 15, 2024, falling on the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. The final round of voting still occurred in late August as scheduled. Anthony Anderson was announced as the host on December 13. Alex Rudzinski and Rick Kimbrel served as director and musical supervisor for the ceremony, respectively. Instead of utilizing play-off music, Anderson's mother, Doris Bowman, reminded award recipients when their time was up to end their acceptance speeches. Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker made an appearance during the telecast's opening segment playing Phil Collins's song \"In the Air Tonight\".\nIn honor of the Emmys' 75th anniversary, producers Collins, Harmon, and Rouzan-Clay announced that the ceremony would feature cast reunions or recreations of memorable moments from popular television series throughout history. In an interview with Variety, Rouzan-Clay elaborated on the segments saying, \"I think they'll be talking about the ones that they may see on the screen. Those are going to be a big talking point, a big watercooler moment, if you will. It was a grand task to figure out how to celebrate 75 years of television. If we can bring some nostalgia to that stage, then I think that we've done a good deed.\" Among the television series that were honored were All in the Family, Ally McBeal, Cheers, ''Grey's Anatomy, and The Sopranos''. The statuettes for these ceremonies also featured the number 75 etched in the base.\nCategory and rule changes\nIn June 2022, the Television Academy announced the elimination of the \"hanging episode\" rule for the 2023 ceremony. In previous years, episodes that aired after the May 31 eligibility deadline but before nominations voting began could be placed on a Television Academy platform for viewing. Following the rule change, all episodes must air for a national audience by May 31, or those episodes will be moved to the following ceremony; if the program does not air a new season in that following year, the episodes would be eligible for individual achievement awards only.\nFollowing a realignment between the Primetime Emmy Awards and Daytime Emmy Awards for the 2022 ceremonies, the Television Academy and the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced in August 2022 that game shows would move to the primetime ceremony. New categories include Outstanding Game Show and Outstanding Host for a Game Show. To accommodate the change, the eligibility window for game shows spanned from January 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023. Additionally, to avoid confusion over where programs qualify, Outstanding Competition Program was renamed to Outstanding Reality Competition Program. Game shows featuring children as contestants are eligible for the Children's and Family Emmy Awards only.\nMore rule changes were announced in December 2022. Most notably, the variety categories were rearranged, with Outstanding Variety Talk Series and Outstanding Variety Sketch Series becoming Outstanding Talk Series and Outstanding Scripted Variety Series. The first category covers programs focused on \"unscripted interviews or panel discussions between a host/hosts and guest celebrities or personalities\", while the second covers those that \"consist of discrete scenes, musical numbers, monologues, comedy stand-ups, sketches, etc.\" The move was seen as an attempt to resolve the dwindling number of variety sketch series and to separate news-focused programs from more variety-focused talk shows; the existing categories were initially merged in late 2020 before being split again a few months later. Other changes included caps on nominations-round voting and changes to tracked categories.\nCategories to be shown during the main broadcast were originally set in November 2023, with Outstanding Variety Special (Live) replacing Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special and Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series (which had rotated from year to year). Following pushback from the WGA, the Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series category was added back to the broadcast.\nCritical reviews and viewership\nThe broadcast received generally positive reviews from critics. Aramide Tinubu of Variety wrote, \"The heartfelt tone and attention to detail made the 75th Primetime Emmys a joy to watch. If Jesse Collins Entertainment wished to produce a flawless awards show, they got pretty damn close.\" She also commended the segments paying tribute to past television programs noting, \"It was fabulous to see these distinguished casts reunite all these years later.\" The Boston Globe television critic Matthew Gilbert quipped, \"It was a relief to get an old-fashioned Emmy Awards show, one not straining to be snarkier than thou or heavily meme-able.\" He also contrasted the show with the previous week's Golden Globes ceremony saying the Emmys were \"a straightforward and largely sincere telecast\" compared to the Globes. The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg said that despite having a repeat slate of winners and being held in an unfavorable time slot, \"They made a good awards show, a smartly produced telecast that was crafted with the tacit acknowledgment that they couldn't count on this slate of winners to carry the night in a deeply satisfying way. The producers knew they had to have actual ideas for how to fill three hours and, in that, they generally succeeded.\"\nAlan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone was more critical of the ceremony, noting that some of the segments honoring past television shows did not work and saying, \"Putting Anderson into the rubber suit from American Horror Story Season One was sweaty on multiple levels, and Peter Dinklage looked miserable paraphrasing some of his Game of Thrones finale dialogue while presenting the night's final award to Succession.\" NPR's Linda Holmes commented that the decision to let Bowman interrupt Jennifer Coolidge's acceptance speech was \"terribly awkward\". Columnist Ben Travers of IndieWire reserved praise for host Anderson and the winners' emotional acceptance speeches, but criticized some production decisions writing, \"Why did the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme serve as a lead-in for the Cheers reunion? Why am I expecting to see David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson on stage after The X-Files music hits, only to then hear Don Draper cracking jokes?\"\nCompeting with the 2023–24 NFL playoffs on ABC and ESPN and cable news coverage of the Iowa Republican caucuses, the ceremony averaged 4.46 million viewers, making it the least-viewed in Emmys history, representing about a 25% decrease over the previous ceremony in 2022. It achieved a 0.87 rating among adults ages 18–49.\nIn Memoriam\nRob Reiner and Sally Struthers introduced the annual In Memoriam segment, which included a special tribute to All in the Family creator Norman Lear, and featured Charlie Puth and The War and Treaty performing a medley of \"See You Again\" and \"I'll Be There for You\".\n* Adan Canto – performer\n* Richard Roundtree – performer\n* Mark Margolis – performer\n* Annie Wersching – performer\n* Eugene Lee – production designer\n* Ron Taylor – executive\n* Gabrielle Beaumont – director\n* David Jacobs – writer\n* Angela Lansbury – performer\n* Stephen \"tWitch\" Boss – choreographer\n* Richard Belzer – performer\n* Ron Cephas Jones – performer\n* Treat Williams – performer\n* Angus Cloud – performer\n* Lance Reddick – performer\n* Suzanne Somers – performer\n* John Beasley – performer\n* Bruce Gowers – director\n* Chris Ledesma – music editor\n* Jules Bass – producer\n* Budd Friedman – producer\n* Deborah Barak – executive\n* Thomas W.
