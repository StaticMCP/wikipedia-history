      "text": "# Kurt Maschler Award\n\nThe Kurt Maschler Award (1982 to 1999) was a British literary award which annually recognised one \"work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other.\" Winning authors and illustrators received £1000 and a bronze figurine called the \"Emil\". The Award was founded by Kurt Maschler, best known as the publisher of Emil and the Detectives by Erich Kästner (1929). By the time of its discontinuation after the 1999 publications, it was administered by BookTrust and Tom Maschler, a British publisher and the son of the founder. At that time, it was announced in December of the publication year.\nWinners\nSeven of the 18 winning works were written and illustrated by one person, including two by Anthony Browne. As an illustrator, Browne won three awards (but five Emils overall), and Helen Oxenbury won two. Each won for work on an edition of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll (1865). Browne and Carroll were the only authors of two winning works.\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Winners of the Kurt Maschler Award\n!

Among these, the 1983 winner, Gorilla, illustrated by Anthony Browne, and the 1999 winner, Helen Oxenbury's edition of Alice in Wonderland, were named two of the top ten Greenaway-winning works (1955–2005) during that Medal's 50-year celebration in 2007.\nThree other Maschler winners were highly commended runners-up for the Greenaway Medal, a distinction awarded roughly annually at the time: Browne's edition of Alice, Oxenbury for So Much, and Patrick Benson for The Little Boat.\nSee also\n* Caldecott Medal\n* Kate Greenaway Medal\n* Mother Goose Award\nReferences"
