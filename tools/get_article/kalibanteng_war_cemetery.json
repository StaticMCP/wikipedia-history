It is one of two Dutch war cemeteries in Semarang, the other being Candi War Cemetery.\nGraves and memorials\nThe cemetery contains 3,100 civilian and military casualties of the Pacific War. The vast majority of graves belong to Dutch women and children from the Japanese-run internment camps Ambarawa VI and VII in Ambarawa, and camps 10 and 11 near Banyubiru and Semarang.\nIt is unclear how many Dutch nationals are buried at this cemetery, as many graves lack identification. The cemetery contains a monument in memory of all women who died in Japanese-run women's internment camps, and another monument for the boys who lost their lives in the Japanese-run internment camps for boys older than 10.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [https://oorlogsgravenstichting.nl/begraafplaatsen/nederlands-ereveld-kalibanteng-te-semarang Kalibanteng War Cemetery] on the website of the Netherlands War Graves Foundation (OGS)\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20030707233457/http://ogs.nl:80/docs/222030_Kalibanteng(1).pdf OGS leaflet about Kalibanteng War Cemetery]\n*  [https://issuu.com/oorlogsgraven-stichting/docs/ogs_brochure_zo_azie_eng?fr=xKAE9_zU1NQ OGS brochure about Dutch war graves in Southeast Asia]"
