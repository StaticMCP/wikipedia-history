During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories honoring films released in 1985. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Stanley Donen and directed by Marty Pasetta. Actors Alan Alda, Jane Fonda, and Robin Williams co-hosted the show. Fonda hosted the gala for the second time, having previously been a co-host of the 49th ceremony held in 1977. Meanwhile, this was Alda and Williams's first Oscars hosting stint. Eight days earlier, in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on March 16, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Macdonald Carey.\nOut of Africa won seven awards, including Best Picture. Meanwhile, fellow Best Picture nominee The Color Purple failed to win any of its eleven nominations. Other winners included Cocoon and Witness with two awards and Anna & Bella, Back to the Future, Broken Rainbow, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Mask, ''Molly's Pilgrim, The Official Story, Prizzi's Honor, Ran, The Trip to Bountiful, White Nights, and Witness to War: Dr. Charlie Clements with one. The telecast received mixed reviews, and it garnered 37.8&nbsp;million viewers in the United States.\nWinners and nominees\nThe nominees for the 58th Academy Awards were announced on February 4, 1986, by Academy president Robert Wise and actress Patty Duke. The Color Purple and Out of Africa led all nominees with eleven each. Winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 24, 1986. With its 11 nominations and zero wins, The Color Purple'' joined 1977's The Turning Point as the most nominated films in Oscar history without a single win. By virtue of her father John and grandfather Walter's wins for Best Director and Best Supporting Actor respectively for 1948's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Best Supporting Actress winner Anjelica Huston made them the first three-generation Oscar winning family. For the first time in Oscars history, all lead acting nominees were born in the United States. Argentina's The Official Story became the first Latin American film to win the Best Foreign Language Film category.\nAwards\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface and indicated with a double dagger ().\n{| role=\"presentation\" class=wikitable\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\n*'Out of Africa&nbsp;– Sydney Pollack, producer'\n**The Color Purple&nbsp;– Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Quincy Jones, producers\n**Kiss of the Spider Woman&nbsp;– David Weisman, producer\n**''Prizzi's Honor&nbsp;– John Foreman, producer\n**Witness&nbsp;– Edward S.

The following February, actor and comedian Robin Williams was selected as host of the 1986 telecast. Actor Alan Alda and two-time Oscar-winning actress Jane Fonda were later announced to join Williams in sharing emceeing duties.\nSeveral other people were involved with the production of the ceremony. Marty Pasetta was hired as director of the telecast. Lionel Newman served as musical director and conductor for the ceremony. Actress Teri Garr performed the titular song from Flying Down to Rio during the opening segment. Singer Irene Cara sang the Frank Sinatra song \"Here's to the Losers\" in honor of unsuccessful Oscar nominees throughout history. A song-and-dance number featuring actor and singer Howard Keel and several actresses including Cyd Charisse, Leslie Caron, and Debbie Reynolds paid tribute to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals.\nBox office performance of nominated films\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 5, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $119 million with an average of $23.9 million. Witness was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $68.7&nbsp;million in the domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Out of Africa ($55.6&nbsp;million), The Color Purple ($46.4&nbsp;million), ''Prizzi's Honor ($26.7&nbsp;million) and Kiss of the Spider Woman ($13.4&nbsp;million).\nOf the 50 grossing films of the year, 42 nominations went to 12 films on the list. Only Back to the Future (1st), Cocoon (4th), Witness (5th), Jagged Edge (20th), The Color Purple (21st), Prizzi's Honor (30th), Agnes of God (32nd) were nominated for Best Picture, directing, acting, or screenplay. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were Rambo: First Blood Part II (2nd), Mask (14th), White Nights (22nd), Silverado (27th), Young Sherlock Holmes (44th), and Ladyhawke'' (46th).\nCritical reviews\nTerrence O'Flaherty of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \"Last night's sustained-release Oscar pill moved faster through the system than most, but from a standpoint of taste it was the worst in years.\" Regarding Alda, Fonda, and Williams's hosting performance, he commented, \"Together they immediately placed a fatal suggestion in the viewer's mind that there must be a shortage of elegant people in the movie business today.\" Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel noted that after co-host Williams opened the ceremony with a slew of humorous jokes, \"The show regrettably returned to its old bad habits with a boring onstage production number intended to be a tribute to old movies.\" The Record's Joel Pisetzner remarked, \"The program might as well have begun with the announcement 'Dead, from L.A. it's Academy night!' \"\nTelevision columnist John J. O'Connor of The New York Times quipped, \"Suddenly, it seemed, somebody had listened to the complaints that had grown deadeningly familiar over the years.\" He also added, \"Mr. Williams's improvisational, on-the-precipice style of humor brought the event's comic tone thumpingly into the 1980s.\" Yardena Arar from the Los Angeles Daily News said, \"This time, the ABC telecast didn't drown in the thank yous–or, for that matter, boring presentation speeches and production numbers.\" Furthermore, she observed, \"The writing was by and large brisk, the production numbers fair (in the case of the Oscar-nominated songs) to fabulous (Keel's medley with a bevy of former leading ladies).\" Houston Chronicle television critic Ann Hodges remarked, \"Oscar 1986 goes into the record books as a very good year–the year the Academy parked the pompous and let the show biz show.\" She also lauded the winners' acceptance speeches and the various musical numbers during the broadcast.\nRatings and reception\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 37.8 million people over its length, which was a 2% decrease from the previous year's ceremony. Moreover, the show drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 27.3% of households watching with a 43% share. At the time, it earned the lowest viewership for an Academy Award telecast and the lowest ratings for any broadcast.\nIn July 1986, the ceremony presentation received four nominations at the 38th Primetime Emmys. The following month, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Outstanding Art Direction for a Variety Program (Roy Christopher).\nSee also\n* List of submissions to the 58th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.oscar.com/ Academy Awards official website]\n* [http://www.oscars.org/ The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences official website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/oscars Oscars' channel] on YouTube run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n;Analysis\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/aa85.html 1985 Academy Awards Winners and History] Filmsite\n;Other resources\n*"
