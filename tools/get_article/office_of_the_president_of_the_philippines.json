The convention was held on March 22, 1897, which saw the election of Emilio Aguinaldo as President of the Revolutionary Government of the Philippines.\nThe OP was abolished after the capture of Aguinaldo in 1901 by the Americans and was reinstated after the proclamation of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935.\nThen-newly elected President Rodrigo Duterte reorganized the OP on June 30, 2016, when he issued his first Executive Order as president.\nBy 2025, the budget of the OP reached ₱15.8 billion under President Bongbong Marcos, a 461% increase from the ₱2.8 billion OP budget in 2016 under President Benigno Aquino III.\nPowers\nMandate\nThe Office of the President's mandate is to provide administrative, advisory, consultative and other support services to the President in the latter's exercise of their powers and functions as Head of State and of the Executive Branch.\nCore function\nThe executive powers of the President under the 1987 Constitution from which the Office of the President mandate emanates, includes among others the President's power of control over all the executive departments, bureaus and offices, as well as the constitutional duty of those executive departments, bureaus, offices, and the Chief Executive to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed.
