It has an earth-filled closed spandrel masonry arch, and is built of square cut stone in irregular courses.  Its railings are built of the square cut stone.  It is a two-lane bridge,  long and  wide bridge.\nIt was designed by Napa County Surveyor O.H. Buckman and was built by A.C. Martini, one of many masonry arch bridges built in the county in the late 1800s and early 1900s which survive today, due to the design efforts of Buckman and the availability of high quality stone and skilled stonemasons.\nIt is located on Aetna Springs Rd., about  west of Pope Valley Rd.\nReferences"
