The initial screenplay drafts were written by James Ellroy in the late 1990s under the title The Night Watchman.\nThe film was released in theaters on April 11, 2008, and was followed by a direct-to-video stand-alone sequel Street Kings 2: Motor City in 2011, with Clifton Powell returning as a corrupt cop.\nPlot\nTom Ludlow, an alcoholic undercover detective for the LAPD's Vice-Special unit, arranges an arms deal with Korean gangsters suspected of kidnapping two teenage girls. He provokes the gangsters into beating him and stealing his car, allowing him to track them to the gang's hideout. Ludlow storms the hideout and kills the gangsters, staging the scene to make the shootings appear justified, and rescues the captive girls. While Captain Jack Wander and the rest of his unit congratulate him, Ludlow is confronted by his former partner, Terrence Washington, who disapproves of the unit's corrupt tactics. Ludlow is later approached by Captain James Biggs of Internal Affairs, but Wander warns that Washington has reported Ludlow to Biggs.\nLudlow follows Washington to a convenience store, where they are ambushed by two gunmen under the pretense of a robbery. Accidentally shot when Ludlow returns fire, Washington is killed by the gunmen. Wander advises Ludlow to remove the surveillance footage, telling the press Ludlow was first on the scene but too late to save Washington. Temporarily reassigned to fielding civilian complaints, Ludlow enlists the help of Detective Paul Diskant, determined to find the killers himself. Washington is implicated in stealing drugs from the evidence room and selling them to the gunmen, identified as criminals Fremont and Coates.\nJoined by a reluctant Diskant, Ludlow brutalizes informants until a drug dealer, Scribble, leads them to the bodies of the real Fremont and Coates in a shallow grave, killed long before Washington. Giving the surveillance footage to Washington's widow, Linda, Ludlow reveals that he lost his own wife and vows to avenge Washington. He and Diskant pose as dirty cops, forcing Scribble to arrange a meeting with the killers masquerading as Fremont and Coates. Diskant recognizes them, but he and Scribble are killed in the ensuing gunfight. Ludlow kills both assailants, but sees on the news that they were Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies.\nDeclared a \"cop killer\", Ludlow is arrested by fellow detectives Santos and Demille, who admit to killing the real Fremont and Coates and planting evidence to frame them for Washington's murder. Ludlow realizes that Washington was actually informing on Wander, who is really behind the evidence room theft. Before Santos and Demille can execute him, Ludlow manages to break free and kill them both. He saves Linda from Sergeant Mike Clady, sent by Wander to recover the surveillance footage and kill her, subduing Clady and locking him in his trunk.\nLudlow confronts Wander at home, handcuffing him after a brawl. Wander confesses that he has incriminating evidence against high-ranking officials to use to become LAPD chief and, eventually, mayor. Revealing a stash of ill-gotten money and blackmail documents hidden inside his walls, Wander declares his actions were for the sake of Ludlow and their unit, but Ludlow shoots him dead. Biggs arrives, admitting he used Ludlow to bring down Wander on behalf of those in power, and tells him that the department still needs him.\nCast\n* Keanu Reeves as Detective Tom Ludlow\n* Forest Whitaker as Captain Jack Wander\n* Hugh Laurie as Captain Jimmy Biggs\n* Chris Evans as Detective Paul \"Disco\" Diskant\n* Cedric the Entertainer as Winston \"Scribble\"\n* Jay Mohr as Sergeant Mike Clady\n* Terry Crews as Detective Terrence Washington\n* Naomie Harris as Linda Washington\n* Common as Fake Coates\n* The Game as \"Grill\"\n* Martha Higareda as Grace Garcia\n* John Corbett as Detective Dante Demille\n* Amaury Nolasco as Detective Cosmo Santos\n* Cle Shaheed Sloan as Fake Fremont\n* Noel G. as \"Quicks\"\n* Clifton Powell as Sergeant Green\n* Daryl F.
