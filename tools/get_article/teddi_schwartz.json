She is mainly remembered today for her singable English translation of Dona, Dona which she cowrote with Arthur Kevess.\nBiography\nShe was born Theodora Rothfarb on July 14, 1914 in East Harlem to Yiddish-speaking Russian Jewish immigrant parents. Her mother was called Anna; her father Mendl \"Max\" Rothfarb was a Klezmer cornet player and tailor, and her grandfather was also a musician who taught music to the family. She studied in public schools and then at the Manhattan School of Music. In 1937 she married a lawyer named Harry Schwartz.\nShe was influenced by the folk music revival of the 1930s and 1940s and in particular the work of Alan Lomax and Pete Seeger She started to translate American songs into Yiddish, collaborating with Arthur Kevess, who often translated Yiddish and German songs.

It was republished in the magazine Jewish Currents in 1958 along with their English versions of Tumbalalaika and The Partisan Girl. That version was recorded by Joan Baez in 1960, as well as by Donovan and Mary Hopkin.
