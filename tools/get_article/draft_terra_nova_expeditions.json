It specializes in small-ship, immersive voyages—principally to Antarctica—with an emphasis on authentic exploration over luxury cruising. The company operates with a team of 11–50 employees, led by founder and Antarctic specialist Greg Carter , alongside Beth Mercier, Global Sales Director previously at Quark Expeditions. They operate the 112 passenger Hebridean Sky in the Antarctic and market the vessel as the Polar Sky. The team draws on significant Antarctic experience with a team of seasoned professionals from the Antarctic expedition sector.\n----Mission & Approach\nTerra Nova aims to rekindle the spirit of purposeful exploration. Its trips are designed for individuals seeking meaningful encounters with polar environments, prioritizing time on land and genuine connection over onboard indulgence. Their voyages emphasize environmental awareness, sustainable travel, and experiential learning\n----Key Features\n* Boutique group travel: Small, curated groups ensure personalized experiences, expert-led excursions, and intimate exploration.\n* Destination-driven: Voyages focus on landings, wildlife viewing, scientific education, and the wild landscapes of regions like the Ross Sea.\n* Authenticity over luxury: Ships are modest yet well-equipped, with minimal onboard frills in favor of purposeful engagement onshore.\n* Sustainability: The company emphasizes low-impact itineraries with environmental stewardship at the forefront.\n----Historical Inspiration\nTerra Nova draws inspiration from early 20th‑century polar exploration, particularly the 1910–1913 Terra Nova Expedition led by Robert Falcon Scott. That historic voyage combined the goal of reaching the South Pole with major scientific objectives. Although Scott’s team reached the pole on 17 January 1912, they found Amundsen’s team had preceded them by 34 days. Tragically, Scott and his four companions perished during the return journey, marking one of the most storied tales of human endurance and scientific endeavour in Antarctic history\nMuch like its namesake, the original Terra Nova ship served both exploratory and scientific purposes, carrying researchers, motor sledges, ponies, and dogs to Antarctica. It weathered ice-bound voyages and played a central role in geology, biology, and meteorology studies along Victoria Land and the Ross Ice Shelf\n----Program Highlights\n* Immersive landings: Zodiac and shore visits offer access to Antarctica’s wildlife—seals, penguins, seabirds—and untouched landscapes.\n* Educational leadership: Expeditions are led by experienced guides and naturalists, providing insights into history, climate science, geology, and ecology.\n* Intimate ship environment: Small group sizes promote camaraderie, flexible scheduling, and direct engagement with environments rather than luxury amenities.\n----Company Structure\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Details\n!Information\n|-\n|Founded\n|2024\n|-\n|Headquarters\n|Sydney, Australia\n|-\n|Company Size\n|11–50 employees\n|-\n|Key People\n|Greg Carter (CEO, Antarctic expert), Beth Mercier (Global Sales Director)\n|}\n----Legacy & Brand Values\nTerra Nova Expeditions positions itself as a counterpoint to luxury polar cruising. It appeals to travelers who value exploration, environmental respect, and small-group connection. The company’s branding and voyage design reflect reverence for the historical Terra Nova Expedition, celebrating its blend of adventure and scientific purpose, even in the face of hardship.\n----Note\n* Not to be confused with Terra Nova Equipment Ltd, a UK outdoor gear manufacturer specializing in tents and expedition equipment terra-nova.co.uk, or Terra Nova Expedition Services Ltd (UK), now dissolved, which operated custom expeditions .\n----External Links\n* Official website: www.terranova-expeditions.com\n* LinkedIn profile: Terra Nova Expeditions – Travel Arrangements, Sydney https://www.linkedin.com/company/terra-nova-expeditions/\n----\nReferences"
