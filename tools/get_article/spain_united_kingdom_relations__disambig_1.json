Both countries are members of the Council of Europe and NATO. Spain is a European Union member and the United Kingdom is a former European Union member.\nHistory\nThe history of Spanish–British relations is complicated by the political and religious heritages of the two countries. Neither the United Kingdom nor Spain have a unique constitutional ancestor; Britain was originally created by a union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland (and later joined by Ireland), whilst the Kingdom of Spain was initially created by a union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon (and later joined by Navarre). For centuries, the role of England, and subsequently Britain, in Iberia was coloured by the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. Relations with Portugal always have been closer than those with Spain, and Spain and Britain have gone to war twice over Portugal's independence. Relations have also been complicated by the fact that the United Kingdom and Spain were both imperial powers, often after the same land, an occurrence which is being played out to this day with the disputed ownership and status of Gibraltar.\nDuring the turn of the 19th century, Anglo-Spanish relations were at a low point. Spain remained neutral in the First World War. During the Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939, the Conservative government in London was neutral, and took the lead in imposing an arms embargo against both the Republican government and Franco's Nationalists.\nPostwar\nThe British Labour Party opposed Franco and after it came to power in 1945 relations were frosty. After Franco died in 1975 and the democratisation movement gained power, relations grew friendly, and trade and tourism grew rapidly.\nPresent day\nIn the present day, Spain and the United Kingdom maintain civil relations, both being members of NATO, and the OECD. They share a number of regulations due to their previously shared membership of the European Union, several of which remain in force in the UK after its exit from the bloc.\nGibraltar\nThe Rock of Gibraltar.\nThe status of Gibraltar is a major point of contention in relations between the two nations, dating back to the conflicts in the early 18th century. The official status of Gibraltar is that of a British overseas territory. Captured by Dutch and British troops in 1704, king Philip V of Spain transferred the territory to Great Britain in 1713 under the terms of Article X of the Treaty of Utrecht.\nIn two referendums, held in September 1967 and November 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected any proposal for the transfer of sovereignty to Spain. The 2002 referendum was on a proposal for joint sovereignty which at one stage was supported by the UK Government.\nConsidering the Gibraltarians decolonisation subjects, Spain asserts it is a bilateral issue between sovereign nations on the grounds of the \"territorial integrity\" clause UN Resolutions, which according to Spain prevails over the right to self-determination to the colonists themselves. On the other hand, Gibraltar's authorities consider Gibraltarian people the legitimate inhabitants of the territory, and therefore entitled to the self-determination right in compliance of the same United Nations' resolutions. Gibraltar's 2006 Constitution Order endorsed and approved by Her Majesty's Government states:\n:Her Majesty’s Government will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes.\nIn 2008, the UN 4th Committee rejected the claim that a dispute over sovereignty affected self-determination, which was a basic human right.\nFrom May 2000 to May 2001  moored in Gibraltar, for repairs on the cooling system of its nuclear reactor. The presence of the nuclear vessel in Gibraltar caused outrage among environmentalists and strained relations between Spain and the UK.\nIn February 2002, the UK formally apologised when a unit of Royal Marines accidentally invaded La Linea de la Concepción's beach instead of Gibraltar's where their planned military training was to be conducted.\nIn 2004, Spain and the United Kingdom established the Tripartite Forum for Dialogue on Gibraltar, with equal representation of both countries and the British Overseas Territory.\nWaters around Gibraltar, declared by the United Kingdom as territorial waters according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (to a three-mile limit), and claimed by Spain, are another source of contention, with the Government of Gibraltar actively backing the British position naming the disputed waters as \"British Gibraltar territorial waters\". In December 2008, the European Commission approved a Spanish request designating most of the waters around Gibraltar as one of Spain's protected nature sites under EU law. This decision is being currently challenged in the European Court of Justice by the Government of Gibraltar, backed by the British government. The Commission will defend its position and, in doing so, will be backed by Spain In May 2009 Gibraltar authorities complained about the presence of a Guardia Civil Maritime Service vessel into the three-mile waters around Gibraltar, escalating to the intervention of Royal Navy Gibraltar Squadron and a diplomatic protest by the Government of the United Kingdom. Further incidents occurred in November 2009, and in February 2019.\nin 2013]]\nIn July 2009 Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs visited Gibraltar to meet the British Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, and Gibraltar's chief minister, Peter Caruana, becoming the first Spanish official to visit the territory since Spain closed its consulate in Gibraltar in the 1950s. The sovereignty issue was not dealt with, given its controversial nature, and the three-way talks focused on other subjects such as cooperation on the environment, maritime matters, and ways of further facilitating the Moroccan community in Gibraltar to transit Spain en route to and from Gibraltar and Morocco.\nIn December 2009, a Guardia Civil launch entered the Gibraltar harbour. Three armed officers landed in Gibraltar illegally and, along with a fourth, were arrested by the Royal Gibraltar Police. Many such incidents occur, with a more recent event being the arresting of Gibraltarian fisherman inside the waters of Gibraltar, confiscation of equipment and transfer of the individuals to Spain. This was strongly condemned by the UK Government, and the UK's method of quiet diplomacy with Spain was criticised by a local newspaper, which called for more 'open' diplomacy.\nBetween January and November 2012, around 200 incursions by Spanish vessels into Gibraltar waters were recorded, as opposed to 23 in 2011 and 67 in 2010. In December 2012, one day after an incursion by a Spanish warship, a Royal Navy Type 23 frigate, HMS Sutherland arrived on a scheduled visit. Rather than taking on stores and fuel and proceeding as had been planned, the frigate and its Merlin helicopter conducted a patrol of Gibraltar waters as a message.\nThe intensity of the disagreement about Gibraltar has been perceived in different ways by the two countries. According to former Spanish prime minister Felipe González, \"For the British, Gibraltar is a visit to the dentist once a year when we meet to talk about it. For us, it is a stone in the shoe all day long\".\nFishing dispute\nThe United Kingdom and Spain have had several recent disputes over fishing rights, particularly with regards to the European Union's Common Fisheries Policy. When Spain became a member state in 1986, it had the world's sixth largest fishing fleet, and much of the economies of Galicia, Asturias, and Cantabria depended upon catches by Spanish boats outside Spain's national Exclusive Economic Zone, just as they do today.\nTo prevent the fleets of other EU members (particularly Spain) taking up the UK's Common Fisheries Policy quota, the UK sought to create a framework that discriminated between British- and Spanish-owned boats, regardless of flag flown, so that its waters wouldn't be over-fished by foreign-owned trawlers. Due to fishing's importance to some of the regional economies of Spain, the Spanish government protested vehemently, but had no power to prevent the UK determining its own domestic policies. However, when the Single European Act was implemented, in 1987, this became illegal under EU law, and a Spanish company successfully challenged the right of the British government to prevent Spanish fishermen taking up the British quota in what has now become known as the Factortame case. In total, £55m has been paid out by the British government to Spanish parties (both public and private) for loss of earnings.\nTo this day, the large Spanish fishing fleet does the majority of its fishing outside Spain's EEZ, as far away as Canada and Namibia. Nonetheless, a large part of its business comes from fishing in the waters of northern Europe, particularly those of the United Kingdom and Ireland. At times of debate of the United Kingdom's declining fish stocks, this has caused strained relations between Spain and the UK, and particularly between Spain and the membership of the devolved Scottish institutions, since Scotland is more dependent upon fishing than the rest of the UK.\nScotland and Catalonia\nScotland held a referendum on independence from the UK on 18 September 2014. In November 2013 the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had stated that an independent Scotland would have to reapply for membership of the European Union, causing considerable irritation to the Scottish Government. Relations between the Spanish and British governments deteriorated further when the Scottish Government alleged that a senior UK Treasury official visited Spain ostensibly to co-ordinate British and Spanish opposition to the independence movements in Scotland and Catalonia. Rajoy was one of the few European heads of government to explicitly voice opposition to Scottish independence, primarily due to his fears that it would encourage the separatist drive in Catalonia. On the issue of Catalan independence, Prime Minister David Cameron had said that \"I don't believe that, in the end, [it's right to] try to ignore these questions of nationality, independence, identity\"... I think it's right to make your arguments, take them on and then you let the people decide\" though he also added that \"I would never presume to tell people in Spain how to meet these challenges themselves; it's a matter for the Spanish Government and the Spanish Prime Minister.\"\nMigration\nThe 2001 UK Census recorded 54,482 Spanish-born people living in the UK. In comparison, it is estimated that 990,000 British-born people live in Spain. Of these, according to the BBC and contrary to popular belief, only about 21.5% are over the age of 65.\nIn 2011, Spanish migration to the UK went up 85%. As for 2012, it was recorded that 69,097 Spanish-born people live in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, in the same period 397,535 British-born people were living in Spain\nTwinnings\nThe list below is of British and Spanish town twinnings.\n* Carmarthen, Wales and As Pontes, Galicia\n* Chesham, England and Archena, Region of Murcia\n* Edinburgh, Scotland and Segovia, Castile and Leon\n* Glasgow, Scotland and Barcelona, Catalonia\n* Kilmarnock, Scotland and Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Catalonia\n* Lymington, England and Almansa, Castilla–La Mancha\n* Manchester, England and Córdoba, Andalusia\n* Nuneaton and Bedworth, England and Guadalajara, Castilla–La Mancha\n* Peterborough, England and Alcalá de Henares, Community of Madrid\n* Plymouth, England and San Sebastián, Basque Country\n* Sherborne, England and Altea, Valencian Community\n* Stafford, England and Tarragona, Catalonia\n* Totnes, England and Santa Fe, Andalusia\nEconomic relations\nThe United Kingdom and Spain have close economic ties based on significant bilateral trade flows and investment. In 2024, the United Kingdom exported goods and services worth £20.9 billion to Spain and imported goods and services worth £44.5 billion from Spain. This made Spain the seventh largest trading partner for the British. In the same year, Spanish direct investment in the UK amounted to around £18 billion. Conversely, British investment in Spain amounted to around £90 billion in 2016, including investments by global British corporations in the pharmaceutical, energy, and automotive industries. Numerous large companies from both countries have gained a foothold in each other's markets. The expansion of Spanish companies in the UK since the 2000s is particularly striking. For example, Banco Santander has acquired several British banks and employs almost 20,000 people in the UK. Numerous major British companies such as Rolls Royce, GSK, Diageo, and BP, as well as numerous banks and insurance companies, are also represented in Spain. In 2011, the Spanish airline Iberia merged with British Airways to form the International Airlines Group (IAG).\nTourism plays a prominent role in economic relations. Spain has been the favourite travel destination for British tourists for decades. In 2019, over 18 million British tourists visited Spain, accounting for around 21–22% of all foreign visitors to Spain. This made the United Kingdom by far the largest source market for the Spanish tourism sector, ahead of Germany and France. British tourists, many of whom are regular visitors, spent just under €18 billion in Spain, more than visitors from any other country. Conversely, many Spaniards also travel to the UK, albeit in significantly smaller numbers. City tourism (e.g., to London) and the language travel market (English courses) are important in this regard. Millions of people commute across the border every year: air traffic between the UK and Spain alone was among the busiest in the world before the crisis, with over 30 million passengers per year. This means that the volume of travel between the UK and Spain even exceeds that of neighbors such as the US and Canada.\nFollowing Brexit, Trade between the United Kingdom and Spain is governed by the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement since 1 January 2021.\nCultural relations\nCultural relations between the United Kingdom and Spain are intense and diverse, supported by exchanges in areas such as education, language, art, popular culture, and civil society. An important vehicle for cultural relations is mutual language and educational exchange. As early as 1940—in the midst of a politically difficult period—the British Council opened its first office and school in Madrid to promote the English language and British culture in Spain, and today it has several branches throughout the country. A bilingual education programme has been in place since the 1990s, and English is widely spoken as a foreign language in Spain. Conversely, Spain is keen to maintain a presence for its culture in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1991, the Instituto Cervantes runs a cultural centre in London and branches (e.g., in Manchester and Leeds) that offer Spanish courses and organise Spanish cultural events. Spanish is very popular as a foreign language in the UK; it is one of the most popular second foreign languages in schools and universities. Close ties also exist in the field of higher education and research. Following the end of British participation in the Erasmus Programme, a bilateral education agreement was signed in 2023 to mutually recognise university entrance qualifications and promote exchange programs.\nThere is lively mutual reception in the arts and media. British literature—from Shakespeare to Harry Potter—is widely read in Spain, while Spanish authors (such as Cervantes' Don Quixote or contemporary writers such as Carlos Ruiz Zafón) are well known and have been translated in the UK. There are also diverse contacts in film and music: British musicians regularly perform at major festivals in Spain, and Spanish filmmakers find an interested audience in London. Joint productions and cultural exchange programmes (e.g., as part of the British Council Arts Program or Spanish Culture Weeks in the UK) strengthen mutual understanding. In 2016, Spain and the UK jointly celebrated the 400th anniversary of the deaths of Miguel de Cervantes and William Shakespeare with events on both sides of the Channel.\nSport plays a special role as a unifying element of popular culture. In football —the most popular sport in both countries and brought to Spain by British immigrants — there is a natural rivalry as well as mutual appreciation. Spanish football stars (such as David Silva, Fernando Torres, and David De Gea) have played in the Premier League, while British coaches and players such as John Toshack, David Beckham, and Jude Bellingham have been or are active in Spanish clubs. European Cup matches between top English and Spanish teams attract a lot of attention in both countries and the Spanish and English national football teams have also faced each other frequently, including in important matches such as the final of the UEFA Euro 2024.\nDiplomatic missions\nThe Embassy of Spain is located in London. Spain also has consulates general in Edinburgh and Manchester.\nThe Embassy of the United Kingdom is located in Madrid. The United Kingdom also has a consulate general in Barcelona and consulates in Alicante, Ibiza, Las Palmas, Málaga, Palma de Mallorca and Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\nFile:Embassy of Spain in London 1.jpg|Embassy of Spain in London\nFile:Torre Espacio (Madrid) 18.jpg|Embassy of the United Kingdom in Madrid\nSee also\n* Foreign relations of Spain\n* Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n* List of ambassadors of Spain to the United Kingdom\n* Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Spain\n* United Kingdom–European Union relations\n* Spanish in the United Kingdom\n* British in Spain\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Dadson, Trevor J.
