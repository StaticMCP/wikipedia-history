It is located about 2 km from village Keterisi where local population lives only seasonally.\nThis limestone was formed when carbonate minerals precipitate out of ambient temperature water. Travertine in some places is covered with a thin layer of transparent water on the white surface of the slopes where intensive development process is still ongoing.\nIt is part of Kazbegi Protected Areas along with Kazbegi National Park and five Natural Monuments:\n*Sakhizari Cliff,\n*Abano Mineral Lake,\n*Truso Travertine,\n*Jvari Pass Travertine,\n*Keterisi Mineral Vaucluse.\nReferences"
