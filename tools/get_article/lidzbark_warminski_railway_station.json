The railway was officially closed in 2005. The station is now a local museum, and a waiting room for the bus terminal.\nHistory\nThe station was opened on 1 October 1899, with its first passenger railway connection to Górowo Iławeckie. In the same year, on 15 November, the line to Czerwonka opened. These railway connections urbanised Lidzbark Warmiński, with numerous new homes and factories being built around the station, bringing jobs to the local area. On 1 September 1905, a new railway line opened from Orneta, via Lidzbark Warmiński to Sątopy-Samulewo. This made the station a junction. In 1916, a connection to Bartoszyce was opened.\nThe last passenger train departed the station on 1 June 1996. The station was officially closed in 2005, with all tracks being dismantled in 2012.\nIn 2022, the abandoned station building was completely restored with a new waiting room (for the bus terminal), a local museum, and a tourist gift shop. The restoration costed 4.2 million PLN.\nProposed restoration\nIn June 2025, the mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński, Jacek Wiśniowski, proposed the restoration of the railway in Lidzbark Warmiński. A petition to the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship to bring back rail connections to Lidzbark Warmiński was brought to public consultations, and received 741 signatures, 131 of whom added comments and opinions.\nThe restoration railway is estimated to cost 1 billion PLN. Lidzbark Warmiński mayor Jacek Wiśniowski is pushing for a rail connection to the existing station in Dobre Miasto, Bartoszyce, and ultimately to Olszytn.\nReferences"
