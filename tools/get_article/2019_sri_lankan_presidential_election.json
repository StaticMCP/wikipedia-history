Incumbent president Maithripala Sirisena did not run for a second term. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, brother of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, was the candidate of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and was endorsed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Sajith Premadasa, son of former president Ranasinghe Premadasa and deputy leader of the United National Party was the candidate of the ruling party.\nThe results were announced on 17 November 2019. Rajapaksa won the election in a landslide victory, receiving 52% of the vote compared his main opponent Premadasa's 42%. The results of the election subsequently brought the Rajapaksa family back to power after a 5-year interregnum.\nSirisena's term of office would have ended on 9 January 2020. They were the first presidential elections in Sri Lanka in which no sitting president, prime minister or opposition leader ran for president.\nBackground\nIn 2015 the newly elected UNFGG government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe passed the nineteenth amendment to the constitution, which restored the two-term limit on the presidency (which had been removed in 2010) and reduced the presidential term from six to five years. The amendment also curtailed certain executive powers by strengthening independent commissions and increasing the role of Parliament.\nPolitical tensions escalated in 2018 during a constitutional crisis when Sirisena attempted to dismiss Wickremesinghe and dissolve Parliament, leading to a standoff that was ultimately resolved by the Supreme Court. The Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in 2019 killed more than 250 people and exposed major failures in security coordination and government oversight.\nAs the term of office of the president was reduced to five years, Sirisena's term would have ended on 9 January 2020. He was constitutionally eligible to call an early presidential election after completing four years of his term on 9 January 2019, but he decided not to do so and later announced he would not seek a second term in office. Therefore, the next presidential election was scheduled to be held between 9 November and 9 December 2019.\nElectoral system\nThe President of Sri Lanka is elected via limited ranked voting. Voters can express up to three ranked preferences for President. If no candidate receives over 50% of valid votes on the first count, all candidates except for the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes are eliminated. The second and third preferences of the eliminated candidates are distributed until one of the remaining two candidates receives an outright majority. In practice, this system has seen little use until 2024, as each direct election going back to the first in 1982 has resulted in a candidate from one of the two major parties or alliances at the time winning in the first count. For this reason, many citizens opt to mark only one candidate, and many are wholly unaware that multiple candidates can be ranked at all.\nTimeline\n;2018\n*26 October–16 December – 2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis: Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena conspire to take the office of Prime Minister before the election.\n;2019\n*9 January – President Maithripala Sirisena becomes constitutionally eligible to call for presidential elections at anytime.\n*31 January – President Sirisena is approved unanimously as the candidate of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party during the Party's Anuradhapura district convention.\n*6 March – Gotabaya Rajapaksa submits application through the United States Embassy to renounce his US citizenship.\n*26 March – Gotabaya Rajapaksa travels to the United States for a personal visit, where he also expects to expedite his request to renounce his citizenship.\n*7 April – While in the United States, Gotabaya Rajapaksa is served with notice of two separate civil lawsuits against him in California over the assassination of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge as well as on behalf of Roy Samathanam, a Tamil torture survivor.\n*12 April – Gotabaya Rajapaksa returns to Sri Lanka from the United States.\n*21 April – The 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings occur.\n*27 April – Gotabaya Rajapaksa announces he will run for president.\n*11 August – Mahinda Rajapaksa and his party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, officially declares Gotabaya Rajapaksa as its presidential candidate.\n*12 August – Several members of the United National Party organize a rally in Badulla to promote Sajith Premadasa as the UNP candidate, though the party was yet to name an official candidate.

Earlier circulated polls prediction which was claimed done by National Intelligence Service was proved false and manipulated.\nNominations\nSri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)\nAfter the landslide victory they won at the 2018 local elections, the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna intended to field their own candidate in the presidential election, with Chamal, Basil and Gotabaya (all brothers of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa) being mentioned as potential candidates. Calls for Gotabaya Rajapaksa to run were made even though he was ineligible to run due to his possession of foreign citizenship. Basil also held foreign citizenship and was therefore ineligible.\nChamal Rajapaksa had also signaled his potential candidacy saying he would \"willingly consider it if the party nominates him as the next presidential candidate\", soon after the announcement made by his brother. Chamal Rajapaksa was unsure whether to contest from the SLFP or the SLPP but preferred a candidate that had the support of both parties.\nOn 12 January, Gotabaya announced he was ready to run in the elections if he had the support for it, though his announcement stunned senior SLPP leaders. Gotabaya Rajapaksa was a leading government figure during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War and the development processes of the Colombo metropolitan area and the Northern Province.\nIn March, Chamal denied that neither him nor Basil would contest but avoided commenting on Gotabaya. Meanwhile, the SLPP announced that they favoured Gotabaya unless someone better is found.\nGotabaya Rajapaksa already had a well organized campaign promoting him and according to D. B. S Jeyaraj, the Rajapaksa family had chosen to support Gotabaya as the candidate and that he would renounce his US citizenship.\nGotabaya Rajapaksa announced he would run for presidency on 11 April, six days after the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings. On 11 August, Mahinda Rajapaksa and the SLPP officially announced that his brother Gotabaya would be its presidential candidate, while Mahinda would run as his prime ministerial candidate.\nUnited National Party (UNP)\nThe United National Party did not field their own presidential candidate in either the 2010 or 2015 presidential elections and supported a common candidate in both elections. Though Maithripala Sirisena, the UNP-backed candidate, won the 2015 election, UNP expenditure for the election period was 500 million LKR and relations between Sirisena and the UNP had been shaky from the start. The power struggle between the president and UNP prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe led to the 2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis. In the aftermath of the events, most UNP members publicly expressed their regret for supporting a common candidate in 2015 and promised to field their own presidential candidate in the 2019 elections.\nInitially, party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe seemed to be the obvious choice for the candidacy and he reportedly expressed his intentions to run for the presidency in a meeting with other senior members. However, several dissident UNP MPs including Mangala Samaraweera, Harin Fernando, Ajith Perera, Harsha de Silva and Sujeewa Senasinghe preferred deputy leader Sajith Premadasa as the UNP candidate, and organized a rally in Badulla where Premadasa himself openly expressed his intentions to be the UNP candidate.\nAmidst growing support for deputy leader Sajith Premadasa and party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe refusing to make a move, Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya released a statement signaling his intention to run for presidency to end the confusion and avoid a rift within the party. However, the Sajith faction showed that they had the popular support among party members and followers by organizing successful rallies in Matara, Kurunegala, and Matugama.\nOn 26 September 2019, the working committee of the United National Party unanimously picked Sajith Premadasa as the UNP presidential candidate. Announcing the official statement, UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that Ranil Wickremesinghe would continue to function as the prime minister and leader of the UNP.\nSri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)\nIncumbent president and SLFP leader Maithripala Sirisena was eligible to run for a second term. Although he had previously stated that he would only serve a single term, after being sworn in in 2015, he had since expressed his desire to stay for a second term. However, with many party seniors choosing to support the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, the SLFP was weakened and suffered a humiliating loss at the 2018 local elections, thus losing the credibility it had as the main opposition to the UNP.\nThe SLFP pledged to support SLPP candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa on 9 October.\nNational People's Power (NPP)\nThe National People's Power party announced Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake as their candidate in a massive rally on 18 August at Galle Face.\nCandidates\nA total of 35 candidates submitted their nominations on 7 October to the election commission.\nMajor candidates\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\" | Candidate\n!Political office and constituency\n!Endorsements\n!Notes\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:lavender;\" | Sajith Premadasa ()\n|Minister of Housing and Construction (2015–2019)Deputy Leader of the United National Party (2014–2020)Former Deputy Minister of Health (2001–2004)Colombo\n|\n*United National Party\n*Sri Lanka Muslim Congress\n*All Ceylon Makkal Congress\n*Jathika Hela Urumaya\n*Tamil Progressive Alliance\n*Tamil National Alliance\n*Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga\n|\n*Son of former president Ranasinghe Premadasa\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:lavender;\" | Gotabaya Rajapaksa ()Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna\n|Former Secretary for the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development (2005–2015)\n|\n*Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna\n*Sri Lanka Freedom Party\n*Ceylon Workers' Congress\n*Mahajana Eksath Peramuna\n*Jathika Nidahas Peramuna\n*Lanka Sama Samaja Party\n*Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal\n*Pivithuru Hela Urumaya\n*Eelam People's Democratic Party\n*Democratic Left Front\n*National Congress\n*Communist Party of Sri Lanka\n|\n*Brother of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa\n|-\n|\n| style=\"background:lavender;\" | Anura Kumara Dissanayake ()National People's Power\n|Former Minister and Chief Opposition Whip (2015–2018)Leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (since 2014)Leader of the National People's Power (since 2015)Colombo\n|\n*Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna\n*National Front for Good Governance (NFGG)\n*United Left Front\n|\n|}\nOther candidates\nIn addition to the 3 candidates mentioned above, 32 other candidates also ran in the election.
