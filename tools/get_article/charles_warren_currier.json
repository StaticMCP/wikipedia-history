His parents were Warren Green Currier (born in New York) and  Deborah Heyliger of the Netherlands.\nHe studied at the College of Our Lady of the Assumption, Roermond, Limburg, the Netherlands, and at Saint Alphonsus Seminary in Wittem, Limburg. He joined the missionary order the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists) in 1875 and was ordained a priest on November 24, 1880, in Amsterdam by Bishop Henry Schaap (vicar apostolic of Surinam). In January 1881, he arrived in Surinam for his first missionary assignment where he remained until 1882.  In November 1891 he was allowed to leave the Redemptorists and then worked in the Archdiocese of Baltimore.\nOn June 25, 1910, he was appointed Bishop of Zamboanga, Philippines, by Pope Pius X, but he declined.  Because he had published articles on Cuban history, he was appointed on April 26, 1913, as the first Bishop of Matanzas. In Rome, on July 6, 1913, he was consecrated by Cardinal Diomede Falconio, O.F.M., and assisted by Domenico Serafini, titular archbishop of Seleucia Pieria, and  Donato Sbarretti, titular archbishop of Ephesus, bishop emeritus of Havana.\nHe arrived in Matanzas on November 3, 1913, and took position of the archdiocese the following day. He repaired and redecorated the Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo that was in poor condition.  Due to his poor health he resigned his position as Bishop of the Archdiocese of Matanzas on February 11, 1914, and was appointed titular bishop of Etalonia on June 15, 1915.\nBishop Currier knew Greek and Hebrew and was fluent in Latin, English, Dutch, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.\nBishop Currier died on September 23, 1918, on a train traveling from Waldorf, Maryland, to Baltimore to assist in the funeral of Cardinal John Murphy Farley, archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York. His funeral took place in the Cathedral of Baltimore, where he is also buried.\nSelected publications\n*[https://archive.org/details/historyofreligio00curr/page/n6 History of Religious Orders] (1898)\nReferences\n* [https://cardinals.fiu.edu/obispos/bio-c.htm#Currier Episcopologio de la Iglesia Católica en Cuba]\nExternal links"
