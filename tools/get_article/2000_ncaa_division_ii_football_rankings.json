For the preseason and the first 3 weeks of the season, the poll consisted of 25 teams. Starting with week 4 of the season, the poll was segregated into four regions, with 10 teams ranked in each region. 2000 was the only year this regional poll was attempted. In 2001, the AFCA went back to a \"Top 25\" nationally.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase
