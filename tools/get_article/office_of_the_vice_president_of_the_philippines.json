The vice president's office then took office at the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) and the PNB Financial Center, both in Pasay. During Vice President Jejomar Binay's tenure, the OVP was hosted at the Coconut Palace. During Vice President Leni Robredo's tenure and the first month of her successor Sara Duterte's term, the OVP was hosted at the Quezon City Reception House. The present office is hosted at Robinsons Cybergate Plaza in Mandaluyong. By July 2022, the OVP established satellite offices for the first time in its history.\nUnder Duterte's tenure, the OVP has been characterized by its compartmentalized structure, with Duterte directly interacting with the office's various divisions instead of having the chief of staff function as an intermediary. From 2022 to 2023, Duterte directly coordinated with special disbursing officer Gina F. Acosta in the handling of the office's confidential and intelligence funds (CIF), who would then disburse them to Col. Raymund Dante P. Lachica, chief of the Vice Presidential Security and Protection Group (VPSPG), for further disbursement.\nCurrent staff\n*Chief of Staff to the Vice President: Zuleika Lopez\n**Assistant Chief of Staff to the Vice President: Lemuel Ortonio\n*Spokesperson: Ruth Castelo\n*Director for Administrative and Financial Services: Rosalynne Sanchez\n*Director for Strategy Management: Sunshine Charry Fajarda\n*Director for Operations: Norman Baloro\n*Chief of Public Assistance Division: Winnie Dayego\nTimeline\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
