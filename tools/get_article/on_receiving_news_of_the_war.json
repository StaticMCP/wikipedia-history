      "text": "# On Receiving News of the War\n\nOn Receiving News of the War is a poem by Isaac Rosenberg which he wrote after hearing of the outbreak of World War I while in Cape Town, South Africa. Unusually, it takes an anti-war stance in contrast to much of the initial patriotic poetry produced during the early months of the war.\nThis poem was published in 1922, in London. It was one of his most famous poems, but it did not gain success until 1948.\nThe poem\nSnow is a strange white word.\nNo ice or frost\nHas asked of bud or bird\nFor Winter's cost.\nYet ice and frost and snow\nFrom earth to sky\nThis Summer land doth know.\nNo man knows why.\nIn all men's hearts it is.\nSome spirit old\nHath turned with malign kiss\nOur lives to mould.\nRed fangs have torn His face.\nGod's blood is shed.\nHe mourns from His lone place\nHis children dead.\nO! ancient crimson curse!\nCorrode, consume.\nGive back this universe\nIts pristine bloom.\nReferences\n*\n\n---\n\n## On receiving news of the war\n\n#REDIRECT On Receiving News of the War"
