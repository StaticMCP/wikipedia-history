The empire succeeded the Safavid Empire after years of political chaos and invasions, restoring Iran’s territorial integrity and influence across the region.\nOrigins\nThe Afsharid dynasty emerged in the early 18th century following the decline of the Safavids, who had ruled Iran since 1501. After Afghan forces captured Isfahan in 1722, Nader, a brilliant general serving under Tahmasp II, led campaigns to drive out the Afghans and restore central authority. His victories earned him national prominence and eventually the Iranian throne.\nReign of Nader Shah\nIn 1736, Nader was crowned Shah at the Mughan plain, founding the Afsharid Empire. His reign was marked by ambitious military conquests, administrative reforms, and efforts to unify the fractured Iranian state. Nader Shah’s campaigns extended Iranian control over Afghanistan, parts of Central Asia, and northern India.\nHis most famous expedition was the invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739, culminating in the capture of Delhi and the seizure of immense wealth, including the Peacock Throne and the Koh-i-Noor diamond. These victories made Iran one of the most powerful empires in Asia during the mid-18th century.\nAdministration and Military\nNader reorganized Iran’s military along modern lines, introducing new artillery and tactics influenced by Ottoman and European models. He attempted to centralize authority and reduce the power of local tribes and religious elites. To diminish sectarian conflict, he proposed reforms in Islamic practice, advocating for a more inclusive interpretation of Shi’a and Sunni Islam — though these efforts met limited success.\nDecline and Fall\nIn the final years of his rule, Nader Shah became increasingly autocratic and suspicious, leading to widespread discontent. His assassination in 1747 plunged the empire into turmoil. After his death, the Afsharid realm quickly fragmented, with Ahmad Shah Durrani founding the Durrani Empire in Afghanistan and other regional powers emerging across Iran.\nAlthough remnants of the Afsharid line held power in Khorasan for several decades, the dynasty effectively ended by the late 18th century with the rise of the Zand and later Qajar dynasties.\nLegacy\nThe Afsharid Empire is remembered for briefly restoring Iran’s status as a major regional power after the Safavid collapse. Nader Shah remains one of Iran’s most celebrated — and controversial — rulers, admired for his military genius but criticized for his later tyranny. The empire’s history marks a key transitional period in Iranian statehood and identity."
