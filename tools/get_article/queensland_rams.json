The Rams were one of the founding teams of the Claxton Shield in 1934 and competed as Queensland until 1988. Between 1988 and 1999, the Claxton Shield was awarded to the winner of the Australian Baseball League. In 1999, the Rams were invited to join the International Baseball League of Australia in which they competed for 2 seasons (1999-2000 and 2002). After this point, the Claxton Shield reverted to a competition similar to that of 1988.\nHistory\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Season !!
