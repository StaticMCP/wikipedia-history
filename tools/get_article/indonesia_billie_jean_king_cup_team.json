They have not competed in the World Groups since 2006.\nHistory\nIndonesia competed in its first Fed Cup in 1969.  Their best result was reaching the quarterfinals in 1991.\nIn 2006, Indonesia qualified for World Group II, but refused to play Israel and forfeited their play-off match against the Israel Fed Cup team in Tel Aviv,[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/fed/2006-07-06-israel-indonesia-forfeit_x.htm \"Israel wins Fed Cup match when Indonesian team refuses to play,\"] USA Today. [http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2508937 Indonesia pulls out of Fed Cup match against Israel] [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/sports/04iht-world.2116160.html?mtrref=www.google.com&gwh=F09083CECF6B97C5E9FD8C00359A9D75&gwt=pay \"Indonesia refuses to play in Israel\" - The New York Times]  and hence was relegated.  Israel thus won by forfeit, and advanced to the 2007 Fed Cup World Group II.[http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2511082 \"Israel wins Fed Cup match vs. Indonesia by forfeit\"]  It was reported that the Indonesian Tennis Association was instructed to forfeit by the Indonesian government.[http://tennis.quickfound.net/wta_results_2006/fed_cup_results_2006.html 2006 \"Fed Cup Women's Tennis Results\": QuickSports]\nThe International Tennis Federation's President Francesco Ricci Bitti said the Federation was saddened by the decision. The ITF fined the Indonesian Tennis Association $31,600, and banned it from 2007's tournament.[https://www.jpost.com/Sports/Indonesia-fined-by-Tennis-Federation \"Indonesia fined by Tennis Federation,\"] The Jerusalem Post.  The fine consisted of $20,000 to host Israel, $6,600 to compensate the ITF`s spending on preparations for the Israel Fed Cup, and $5,000 for pulling out of the match. Indonesia had been in the World Group II playoffs in 2007, but the sanction relegated Indonesia to Group II of the Asia/Oceanic Zone in 2008.\nResults\nFrom 2008 to 2016, Indonesia largely alternated between Asia/Oceania Zone Group II and Group I. In the 2016 Fed Cup, was not able to achieve promotion to Group I, and hence will again start the 2017 campaign in Group II. Sri Utaminingsih was the Indonesian coach in 2016.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"50\"| Year\n! width=\"300\"| Competition\n! width=\"190\"| Rank\n! width=\"150\"| Result\n! width=\"150\"| Players\n! width=\"150\"| Opponent\n! width=\"50\"| Score\n|-\n| 2008 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group I ||5th || Remained in Group I || Sandy Gumulya Ayu Fani Damayanti Lavinia TanantaVivien Silfany Tony ||||align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\"| 2–1\n|-\n| 2009 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group I ||4th || Remained in Group I || Sandy GumulyaAyu Fani DamayantiLavinia Tananta Jessy RompiesSuzanna Anggarkusuma (Captain) ||||align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\"| 0–3\n|-\n| 2010 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group I ||8th || Relegated to Group II || Yayuk BasukiAyu Fani DamayantiLavinia TanantaJessy RompiesSurya Wijaya Budi (Captain) ||||align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\"| 0–3\n|-\n| 2011 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group II ||1st || Promoted to Group I || Ayu Fani DamayantiLavinia TanantaJessy RompiesYayuk Basuki||||align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\"| 2–1\n|-\n| 2012 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group I ||7th || Relegated to Group II || ||  ||align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\"| 0–3\n|-\n| 2013 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group II ||1st || Promoted to Group I || ||  ||align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\"| 2–0\n|-\n| 2014 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group I ||7th || Relegated to Group II || Vita Mediana, Tami Grende, Lavinia Tananta, Deria Nur Haliza  ||||align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\"| 2–0\n|-\n| 2015 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group II ||3rd || Remained in Group II || Ayu Fani Damayanti, Lavinia Tananta, Deria Nur Haliza  ||  || align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFA07A\"| 1–2\n|-\n| 2016 ||Asia/Oceania Zone Group II ||5th || Remained in Group II || Lavinia Tananta, Jessy Rompies, Deria Nur Haliza, Beatrice Gumulya ||  Pacific Oceania || align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#98FB98\"| 2–0\n|}\nSee also\n*\n*Boycotts of Israel in individual sports\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
