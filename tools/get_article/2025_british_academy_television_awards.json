Therefore, two television categories were created: Children's Scripted and Children's Non-Scripted. The former for scripted drama or comedy content either live-action or animation, and the latter for non-scripted such as factual, factual entertainment, documentary and news.\nNon-competitive awards\nThe BAFTA Fellowship was presented to Scottish journalist, broadcaster, and presenter Kirsty Wark. In a statement accompanying the announcement, BAFTA CEO Jane Millichip said “I am beyond delighted to present this year’s BAFTA Fellowship to Kirsty Wark. Kirsty’s dedication is unwavering when it comes to telling the stories that really matter. Her legacy is unmatched in the world of news and current affairs broadcasting. Her ability to inform and engage her readers, listeners and viewers is truly inspiring. And she does all this with enormous charm and wit.
