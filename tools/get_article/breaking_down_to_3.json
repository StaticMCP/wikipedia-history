He manages to be different and clever without ever lapsing into pretension or cliches.\"\nChuck Thurman of Monteray County Weekly says, \"It's as if the album was created from the deep, ragged breath drawn by a bloodied boxer just before the bell rings for the next round.\"\nTom Dooley of Eclectica reviews Breaking Down to 3 and writes, \"This is the kind of album that transcends the folk genre from which it originates. If you like Dire Straits, Greg Brown, Johnny Cash; if you're into country, rock, blues, or folk; if you like music, I'm betting you'll be blown away by this album.\" He concludes with, \"On a groovy factor scale of one to five, we're talking a five or better here.\"\nJay Haeske of Back Road Bound concludes his review with, \"One of the overlooked gems in the Singer/Songwriter field of the past 15 years, that's for sure.\"\nTrack listing\nMusicians\n*Dave Moore – vocals, guitar, harmonica\n*Rick Cicalo – acoustic bass, electric bass\n*Steve Hayes – drums\n*Bo Ramsey – electric guitar, lap steel guitar, vocals\n*David Zollo – piano\nProduction\n*Producer – Bo Ramsey, Dave Moore\n*Mastering – David Glasser\n*Engineer – Brent Sigmeth\n*Mixing – Tom Tucker\n*Photography – Sandy L.
