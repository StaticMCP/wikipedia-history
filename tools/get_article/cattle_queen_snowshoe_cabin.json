It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\nIt is significant as \"one of the oldest surviving backcountry patrol cabins in Glacier National Park. This is reflected in the structure's unrefined, nonstandard design and relatively primitive construction. The building is both indicative of its wilderness setting and of the earliest efforts of NPS administrators to \"protect\" the park's backcountry. For many years, in common with some three dozen other backcountry structures, the Cattle Queen Cabin was an important overnight stop for rangers on backcountry patrol, winter and summer.\"\nIt is a one-room wood-floored cabin with a gable roof having extended purlins creating a large front porch.  When listed in 1999, it was painted brown, was very weathered, and had a corrugated metal roof, which had covered original shingles.\nIts ridgepole and purlins were cracked by a tree fall in the 1970s.\nReferences"
