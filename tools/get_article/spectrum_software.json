It was founded in February 1980 by Andy Thompson. Initially, the company concentrated on providing software for Apple II systems.\nOne of the earliest products was Logic Designer and Simulator. Released in June 1980, this product was the first integrated circuit editor and logic simulation system available for personal computers. In many ways it was the forerunner of the Micro-Cap products. Its primary goal was to provide a “circuit creation and simulation” environment for digital simulation.\nIn August 1981, the analog equivalent of the first program, Circuit Designer and Simulator, was released. Its integrated text editor created circuit descriptions for a simple, linear, analog simulator. September 1982 saw the release of the first Micro-Cap package as a successor to the Circuit Designer and Simulator. The name Micro-Cap was derived from the term Microcomputer Circuit Analysis Program.\nAs of July 4, 2019, the company has closed and the software is now free.   In early 2023, their website went offline.\nReferences\n* [http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MCG.1984.276090 Micro-CAP: An Analog Circuit Design System for Personal Computers]\n* [http://electronicdesign.com/article/embedded/spice-programs-computerized-circuit-analysis-for-a.aspx Spice Programs: Computerized Circuit Analysis For Analog EEs]\n* [http://user.unob.cz/biolek/DF/DFa.htm Analysis of digital filters via SPICE-family programs]\n* [http://home.fnal.gov/~kubik/Noise.pdf Modeling IIj Noise in HEMTS with SPICE-Based Micro-Cap]\n* [http://user.unob.cz/biolek/veda/articles/CSCC07.pdf AC Analysis of Idealized Switched-Capacitor Circuits in Spice-Compatible Programs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100928040701/http://www.russandrews.com/downloads/ZapperatorDocJA4.pdf White Paper: A New Zobel Network for Audio]\n* [https://archive.today/20130103161801/http://www.edn.com/article/481000-Get_more_power_with_a_boosted_triode.php Get more power with a boosted triode]\nExternal links\n*"
