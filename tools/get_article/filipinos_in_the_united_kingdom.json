Filipinos also account for the largest foreign-born population in the London Borough of Sutton. Other towns and cities with significant Filipino communities include Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Leeds, Southampton, Worthing, Gloucester and Barrow-in-Furness, which is home to a sizeable flourishing Filipino community. Fiestas are held during June, July and August in various cities throughout the UK.\nEconomics\nAccording to the Institute for Public Policy Research, 85.4 per cent of new immigrant Filipinos to the UK of working age are employed (as opposed to inactive - a category which includes students - or unemployed), with 12.8% being low earners (people making less than £149.20 a week – half the UK median wage) and 0.61 per cent are high earners (people earning more than £750 a week). 78% of settled Filipino immigrants to the UK are employed, with 15.4% being low earners and 1.28 per cent being high earners. In 2020, 18,500 Filipinos were employed by the National Health Service; as of April 2020, of NHS workers who have died of COVID-19, 20% were Filipino.
