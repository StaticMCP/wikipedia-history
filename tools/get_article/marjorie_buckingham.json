She wrote one called \"All These Things\" a quote from the famous text \"In all these things we are more than conquerers\". The typical girl of 18 who had been raised in church and Sunday School ethics simply loved, adored and devoured it\".\nBooks\n* In All These Things (1949, New Life Publications)\n* Broad is the Way (1953, Oliphants), described as \"suitable for teenage girls\"\n* They Shall Be Mine: A School Story (1954, Oliphants)\n* The Adventures of Tina and Tim: A Story for Girls and Boys (1954, Oliphants)\n* Strait is the Gate (1956, Oliphants)\n* This My Son (1960, Oliphants)\n* Many Waters (1965, Oliphants)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Deslandes, Elizabeth (1981) Fastened to the Rock: Reflections on the Life of Marjorie Buckingham (Vital Publications)\n* The Sunday Companion, 26 September 1953, article on Buckingham"
