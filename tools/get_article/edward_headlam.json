On 3rd Feb 1923 Indian Mercantile Marine Committee was appointed to consider and report what measures could be taken to further the objectives of the resolution, which were:\n# to recognise the need for the training of Indians for nautical careers and encouraging the creation of an Indian Mercantile Marine.\n# to accept the policy and measures recommended by the Indian Mercantile Marine Committee.\n# to take early steps for the training of Indians in a suitable training ship in Indian waters, for the provision of facilities for future training as apprentices in our mercantile marine ships, and for their employment after completion of their training.\n# to arrange from the establishment of primary nautical schools in selected marine stations, and the introduction of Marine Engineering as a subject of instruction in the Engineering College at Sibpur. and\n# to announce his intention to adopt in the near future a system of licensing in respect of the coastal trade of India.\nThe committee was presided by Capt. Headlam, and consisted of Sir Arthur H Froom, Lalubhai Samaldas, Jadu Nath Roy, Sir John Biles, and Diwan Bahadur Tiruvenkata Rangachariar. J H Green served as secretary.\nCommittee had important observations and recommendations.\n* The repeal of the Indian Coasting Trade Act of 1860.\n\"We are of opinion that in the interests of the growth of an Indian Meroontile Marine it is necessary to dose the coasting trade of this country to shins belonging to the subjects of foreign nations\"\n* Regarding training and apprenticeship, the committee observed.It is our considered opinion that the provision of facilities for the training of Indian officers and engineers alone is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the case and that some further steps are required to achieve the object in view. These further steps, we recommend, should be in the form of the eventual reservation of the Indian coasting trade for ships the ownership and controlling interests in which are predominantly Indian.\n* The Committee added that for the fulfillment of these conditions a ship should conform to the following conditions;\n*# Ship should be registered in India.\n*# It should be owned and managed by an individual Indian or by a Joint Stock Company (public or private) which is registered in India with rupee capital, with a majority of Indians on the Directorate and with a majority of its shares held by Indians.\n*# Management of such company is predominantly in the hand of Indians.\n* The Committee recognised that the Royal Indian Marine should be reorganised into an Indian Navy for the defence of India's coast, harbours, and shipping.\n* That a training ship on the lines of the Worcester or the Conway should be established at Bombay to train young Indians to be- come Sea-officers.\nRawlinson Committee\nBased on the recommendations of the Headlam Committee's report another independent committee was set up for \"the reorganization of the Royal Indian Marine\". The committee convened in Feb 1925 and was presided by Gen Lord Rawlinson. Headlam was also part of this committee. The goal was to draw up a scheme for the purpose of putting into effect a policy to \"The reconstruction of the Royal Indian Marine as a combatant force, to enable India to enter upon the first stage of her own naval development, and ultimately to undertake her own naval defence\".\nThe Indian Navy Bill and the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act 1934\nBased upon the previous two committee reports, the Indian Navy bill was tabled in the British parliament on 2 Mar 1927. After much debate, the Bill was passed on the third reading in the House of Commons, and on the second reading in the House of Lords, on 5 and 28 April respectively. The bill received royal assent on 29 June, and became the Government of India (Indian Navy) Act 1927 (17 & 18 Geo. 5. c. 8).\nThe act empowered the Indian Legislature to enact and adapt the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act, 1934, which assented to by the Viceroy on 8 Sep 1934.\nOn 2 October 1934 at Bombay, the Royal Indian Marine ceased to exist and the Royal Indian Navy was inaugurated.\nAwards and honours\n* On 14 October 1900 he received a Bronze Medal from the Royal Humane Society for rescuing a Sepoy who had fallen overboard from the transport ship \"Wardha\" off Taku.\n* Medal and Mentioned in Despatch, China, 1900-01.\n* He was mentioned in dispatch dated 17 Jan 1901 by Gen.
