The Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) claimed Do Ye-jong (도예종, 都禮鐘), Yang Choon-woo (양춘우, 楊春遇), Park Hyun-chae (박현채) and ten other individuals organized the People's Revolutionary Party.  According to the National Intelligence Service (successor to the KCIA in 1981), this was \"an organization attempting to overthrow the Republic of Korea according to North Korean programs\"  that \"tried to recruit more people from various backgrounds to expand the party structure.\"  Do, Yang and Park and other six were sentenced to six years imprisonment, while the others were sentenced to a year of imprisonment and three years probation.\nThe second incident\nThe second incident, also known as the \"Committee for Re-establishment of the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP) Incident\" (in Korean: 인민혁명당 재건위원회 사건) in South Korea, took place on 9 April 1975. In December 1972, the Park Chung-Hee government launched the \"Yushin-system\": an anti-constitutional system in favor of Park's autocracy named after the Meiji Restoration of Japan. Also, the abduction of Kim Dae-jung, a leading politician of the opposing party added to the anger of South Korean people caused by the Yushin system. From October 1973, demonstrations against the Park government gained strength.\nMeanwhile, on 3 April 1974, Park announced the existence of an extreme socialist group: the \"People's Revolutionary Party\", and prohibited all activities related to the party.\nAs demonstrations increased against the Park dictatorship, the KCIA arrested 1024 individuals without warrant on 25 April 1974 under the National Security Law. 253 of them were imprisoned. On 9 April 1975, the Supreme Court of South Korea sentenced eight men to death. Only 18 hours after the announcement of the death penalty, the government executed the eight individuals:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! English name !! Korean name !!

Confessions were obtained using methods such as torture and coercion. It is now widely evidenced that such a \"People's Revolutionary Party\" never existed in reality, and that it was fabricated by the KCIA.\nIn January 2007 a Seoul court posthumously acquitted all eight victims of the incident. In August 2007 the Seoul Central District Court awarded compensation in excess of 63 billion won to the families of the victims.\nSee also\n*Third Republic of South Korea\n*Fourth Republic of South Korea\n*South Korean National Liberation Front Preparation Committee\nReferences"
