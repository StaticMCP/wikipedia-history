The player must choose whether to regain control of this colony and win the queen's favor, or break free and find his or her own path. The land of Sacramentum contains a network of old, ruined Haven fortresses. Capturing and rebuilding them is a major part of building the main character's power.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
