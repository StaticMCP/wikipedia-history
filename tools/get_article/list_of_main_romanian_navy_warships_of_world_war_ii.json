It includes major surface warships and submarines. Each surface warship in this list is armed with at least two main guns of a caliber greater than 4 inches (102 mm) or with torpedo tubes, and has a range of over 1,200 km (650 nautical miles). The fore-mentioned range is the minimum required for a journey along the maximum East-West extent of the Black Sea, which amounts to a distance of 1,175 km (730 miles or 635 nautical miles). The Black Sea was the naval front where the Royal Romanian Navy operated throughout the war.\nMajor surface warships\n{| class=\"wikitable \"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background: lavender;\"| Destroyers (4)Frigates (1)Torpedo boats (5)Monitors (7)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:9%;\"|Picture\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:19%;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:19%;\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:24%;\"|Ships\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Displacement (standard)\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:20%;\"|Note\n|-\n| Regele Carol I-class\n|\n| Seaplane tender/Minelayer\n|\n| Regele Carol I\n| 2,653 tons\n| Built in Glasgow as passenger steamer and commissioned in 1898, converted to seaplane tender and minelayer in 1916 and sunk in October 1941\n|-\n| Regele Ferdinand-class\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Destroyer\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| Regele FerdinandRegina Maria\n| 1,422 tons\n| Built in Italy in the early 1930s\n|-\n| Vifor-class\n|\n| MărăștiMărășești\n| 1,432 tons\n| Built in Italy during the First World War\n|-\n| Amiral Murgescu-class\n|\n| Minelaying frigate\n|\n| Amiral Murgescu\n| 812 tons\n| Largest Romanian-built warship of the Second World War\n|-\n| 250t-class\n|\n| Torpedo boat\n|\n| NălucaSborulSmeul\n| 262 tons\n| Built in Austria-Hungary during the First World War\n|-\n| No. 10-class\n|\n| Fast attack craft\n|\n| No. 10No. 11No. 12No. 13\n| 65 tons\n| German motor torpedo boats with a range of 700-750 nautical miles, acquired on 14 August 1944\n|-\n| Brătianu-class\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Monitor\n|\n| Mihail KogălniceanuLascăr CatargiuIon BrătianuAlexandru Lahovari\n| 650 tons\n| Built in sections in Austria-Hungary then assembled and launched in Romania between 1907 and  1908\n|-\n| Sava-class\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| Bucovina\n| 580 tons\n| Built in Austria-Hungary during the First World War\n|-\n| Enns-class\n|\n| Basarabia\n| 540 tons\n| Built in Austria-Hungary during the First World War\n|-\n| Temes-class\n|\n| Ardeal\n| 442 tons\n| Built in Austria-Hungary during the First World War\n|}\nSubmarines\nSource:\n{| class=\"wikitable \"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background: lavender;\"|Fleet submarines (3)Midget submarines (5)\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:9%;\"|Picture\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:19%;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:19%;\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:24%;\"|Ships\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:15%;\"|Displacement (standard)\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:20%;\"|Note\n|-\n| Delfinul-class\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" | Submarine\n|\n| Delfinul\n| 650 tons\n| Unique submarine built in Italy for the Romanian Navy, commissioned in 1936\n|-\n| Marsuinul-class\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| Marsuinul\n| 620 tons\n| Unique submarine built in Romania, laid down in 1938 and commissioned in 1943\n|-\n| Rechinul-class\n|\n| Rechinul\n| 585 tons\n| Unique minelaying submarine built in Romania, laid down in 1938 and commissioned in 1943\n|-\n| CB-class\n|\n| Midget submarine\n|\n| CB-1CB-2CB-3CB-4CB-6\n| 35 tons\n| Italian midget submarines captured in late 1943\n|}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*"
