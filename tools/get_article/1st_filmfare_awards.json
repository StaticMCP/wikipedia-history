The Chief Guest of function was George Allen, US Ambassador to India. The ceremony was compared by actor David, and it started with actress Nalini Jaywant singing the national anthem. This was followed by song and dance performance by various actors, musical performances by Talat Mehmood, Geeta Roy and Mohammed Rafi. Next two performances were classical dance performances by Vyjayanthimala and Surya Kumari. The finale of the performance section was a folk-dance performance, \"Lure of Rajasthan\" by Kamini Kaushal and her troupe.\nThis led to the section where David announced the awards. No nominations were announced, just the winners. Keep with the voting process, where the readers of the magazine, decided the winners through postal votes, even the awards were given away by readers, chosen via a lucky draw. For example, the Best Film trophy was given by Ambassador Allen to a reader, Saijuddin from Hyderabad, who in turn presented it to Bimal Roy. This was followed by Best Actress which was won by Meena Kumari for Baiju Bawra and Best Actor went to Dilip Kumar for Daag. Next, ace music director Naushad won his first and only Filmfare Award, for Best Music for Baiju Bawra. The final award, the Best Director was won by Bimal Roy, present by Sonny Cordiero, a reader from Mumbai.\nIncidentally, Bimal Roy and Dilip Kumar were the first winners of Best Director and Best Actor respectively, and remained almost 6 decades later, the ones with the most wins in either category, with 7 and 8 awards respectively. Additionally, Meena Kumari, who was the first winner for Best Actress, held the record for the most wins in the category (4) for 13 years, till her record was broken by Nutan with her 5th win at the 26th Filmfare Awards.  Fearing similar mob of fans as outside Metro Cinema, the venue of the award party was not announced publicly. Later, around hundred invitees gathered at Wellington Gymkhana Club.\nHollywood star Gregory Peck was invited to be the guest of honour at the awards but could not make it to the function since his flight from Colombo got delayed. However, Peck did attend the after-party banquet that followed the award night at Wellington Gymkhana Club, Mumbai.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Film\n|-\n|colspan=2|\n*'Do Bigha Zameen – Bimal Roy Productions\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Director\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Music Director\n|-\n|valign=top|\n*Bimal Roy – Do Bigha Zameen\n| valign=top|\n*Naushad – Baiju Bawra for Tu Ganga Ki Mauj\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Actor\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"|Best Actress\n|-\n|valign=top|\n*Dilip Kumar – Daag as Shankar\n|valign=top|\n*Meena Kumari – Baiju Bawra as Gauri'\n|}\nSuperlatives\nThe following films had multiple wins\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"| Movie\n!style=\"background:#EEDD82;\"| Awards\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Baiju Bawra\n|rowspan=2|2\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Do Bigha Zameen\n|}\nSee also\n* 2nd Filmfare Awards\n* Filmfare Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000245/1954 Winner and nomination of 1st Filmfare Awards] at Internet Movie Database\n*"
