      "text": "# Monumental Welsh Women\n\nMonumental Welsh Women is a project to provide the first five statues of real Welsh women in Wales. It was started by a group of women, including Helen Molyneux, in 2016 and later became formalised as the not-for-profit Monumental Welsh Women Ltd. They work with other organisations, such as public art specialist group Studio Response, to raise funds and commission the statues.\nFollowing publicity and public consultations, a short-list was drawn up. The final five were chosen and there was a series about them on the BBC in 2019.\nThe women selected were:\n* Betty Campbell Monument in Cardiff (September 2021); the statue was commissioned from Eve Shepherd.\n* Elaine Morgan in Mountain Ash (March 2022); the statue was commissioned from Emma Rodgers.\n* Sarah Jane Rees (Cranogwen) in Llangrannog (June 2023); the statue was commissioned from Sebastien Boyesen.\n* Lady Rhondda in Newport (September 2024); the statue was commissioned Jane Robbins.\n* Elizabeth Andrews (2025).\nReferences"
