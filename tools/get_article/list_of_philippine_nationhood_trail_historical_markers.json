      "text": "# List of Philippine Nationhood Trail historical markers\n\nThe following is a list of historical markers unveiled by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) as part of the Philippine Nationhood Trail to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the Philippine declaration of independence in 1898 including the subsequent struggles of the First Philippine Republic leading to General Emilio Aguinaldo's capture in 1901.\nBackground\nInspired by the NHCP's project in 2021 for the Quincentennial Commemorations where 34 quincentennial historical markers were unveiled at sites all over the Philippines that the Magellan expedition visited, the commission launched the Landas ng Pagkabansang Pilipino (Filipino for \"Philippine Nationhood Trail\") where 100 sites in the country will be given a standard memorial and historical marker. The NHCP held a program at Fort San Pedro in Cebu City on August 3, 2022, where they announced the project and unveiled the logo with the theme of \"Kalayaan. Kinabukasan. Kasaysayan.\" (Freedom. Future. History.). During a forum held in December 2023, the NHCP stated that 43 markers would be unveiled in 2024 with a total of 74 up to 2026.\nThe first marker was unveiled in Bacoor, Cavite on August 1, 2023, and the second at the Aguinaldo Shrine in nearby Kawit on August 31, 2023 (originally announced to be unveiled on June 23).\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n!
