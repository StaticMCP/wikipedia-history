The organization is particularly noted for its 1998-1999 sit-in before the Korean National Assembly demanding passage of the \"Special Act on investigation of suspicious deaths\", which was passed in December 1989. The Association's 422-day protest is generally viewed as a major contributor to the bill's passage.\nAward\nIn 2002, the group was awarded the Gwangju Prize for Human Rights of the May 18 Memorial Foundation. The prize recognizes \"individuals, groups or institutions in Korea and abroad that have contributed in promoting and advancing human rights, democracy and peace through their work.\"\nReferences"
