The series aired from July 31, 2018, to August 26, 2021, on NBC.\nThe show features craftspeople skilled in different media competing to be named the \"Master Maker\" and win $100,000. Each week, competitors make two handmade projects—a \"Faster Craft\" and a \"Master Craft.\" The winner of each challenge earns a patch. For the Faster Craft, makers have three hours to create an item. For the Master Craft, they have a longer time to create a more elaborate themed collection. At the end of every episode, one person is sent home based on their performance in the Master Craft.\nCast\nHosts\n* Amy Poehler\n* Nick Offerman\nJudges\n* Dayna Isom Johnson\n* Simon Doonan\nShop Master\n* Jimmy DiResta\nContestants\nSeason 1\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
