The museum also features seasonal displays, temporary exhibits, classroom and the museum store. Changing exhibits include Native American history, ice harvesting, maritime, circus, local sports, and early agricultural.\nHistory\nThe David Taylor House, built in the early 1850s by Sheboygan County Judge David Taylor, a prominent citizen in the early years of Sheboygan. The house became county property around 1900 and was later used for the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office and county jail from 1915 to 1936, when the Sheboygan County Courthouse was completed.\nThe house was then used by the caretaker of Taylor Park for many years and was leased to the Sheboygan County Historical Society in 1949. The road leading to the park known as Taylor Drive eventually became a west-side local beltline road for the city.\nThe Sheboygan County Historical Museum was originally on the first floor of the David Taylor House. In the early 1970s, the museum expanded to the entire building. The Taylor House served as the main museum building until the new museum was opened in 1997 across the grounds.\nSee also\n* David Taylor House\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.sheboygancounty.com/departments/departments-f-q/historical-museum Sheboygan County Historical Society Museum]"
