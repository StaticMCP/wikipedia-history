King attracts students from 30 towns in the Fairfield County, Connecticut and Westchester County, New York areas. It operates as a 501c(3) non-profit institution and serves approximately 700 students.\nCampus\nThe King School's thirty-six acre campus is located on Newfield Ave. in northern Stamford, approximately forty miles from Manhattan. The campus consists of two historic buildings that house the lower and upper schools, a new middle school, and a new performing arts center. The new middle school building and performing arts center were completed in 2013.\nIn 2016, Campus sustainability efforts earned the school a nomination from the Connecticut State Department of Education to be considered one of the United States Department of Education's Green Ribbon Schools.\nHistory\nKing School has its origins in three different schools that merged over time to become the King Low-Heywood-Thomas School by 1988.\nThe Low-Heywood School, an all-girls school, was the oldest of the three. Low-Heywood was founded in 1883 when Louisa Low and Edith Heywood purchased the Richardson School that had existed on Willow Street in Stamford since 1865.\nThe King Day School, a boys' school, was founded by Hiram King and T. F. Leighton in Stamford in 1875 and first called The Collegiate School. By 1876, it had moved into the buildings of the defunct Wilcox Academy under the name H.U. King School for Boys. After moving its location several times, the King School purchased a property on Newfield Avenue in 1963. In 1969, the Low-Heywood school moved from Shippan Point to an adjacent property on Newfield Avenue.\nThe Thomas School, an all-girls school, was founded in 1922 by school teacher Mabel Thomas on the grounds of her family's estate following the death of her father. Thomas served as the school's headmistress until 1953. It merged with Low-Heywood in 1975, and became the Low-Heywood Thomas School girls' school.\nThe King School merged with the Low-Heywood Thomas School in 1988 to become the co-educational King & Low-Heywood Thomas school.\nAcademics\nKing School is listed among the best private schools in the NYC suburbs.\nThe school offers multiple programs that allow for independent study and off-campus experiences.
