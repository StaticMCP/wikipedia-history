The capture led to the hoisting of the Union Jack on the British factory in Canton and the resumption of trade between the British and the Chinese.\nNarrative\nFollowing the Convention of Chuenpi in January 1841, which among other clauses ceded the island of Hong Kong to Great Britain, the furious Qing Daoguang Emperor fired Imperial Commissioner Qishan. In his place the emperor appointed his nephew Yishan as \"General-pacifier of the Rebellious\" (jìngnì靖逆), with Lungwan (Long Wen,隆文) and Yang Fang as ministerial attaches to assist him. On20 March, British Plenipotentiary Charles Elliot announced the re-opening of trade after negotiations with Yang Fang as Lungwan and Yishan did not arrive in Canton until 14April.\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n* }}\n*\n*"
