      "text": "# Gawad Urian Award\n\n}}\nThe Gawad Urian Awards are annual film awards in the Philippines presented since 1977 by the Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino (), an organization composed of film critic, writers, and scholars. It is the regarded as the highest award for a film given by critics in the Philippines and is seen as the counterpart of the United States' New York Film Critics Circle.\nThe name \"Gawad Urian\" is from Tagalog terms urian (a standard for gold) and gawad (award). It is the only major award-giving body in the Philippines to use the vernacular in awards shows and in the presentation of the awards. The official name for the Best Film category is Pinakamahusay na Pelikula, for example.\nHistory\n}}\nThe Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino was formed by a host of scholars, film writers and other award-winning writers on May 1, 1976, as a critics' voice to rival the then-only award-giving body in the Philippines, which is its Oscars, the FAMAS Awards. Three years earlier, what would be the members of the Manunuri were included in the judges' roster of the FAMAS after a shocking 1972 Best Actress tie materialized between major star Boots Anson-Roa and then-rising star Vilma Santos. A tie was unheard of at that time, which resulted in accusations of lessening prestige on the part of FAMAS. After a voting stint at the FAMAS, these future Manunuri members set up the Gawad Urian Awards.\nThe Gawad Urian Awards were established to \"examine Filipino films, bolster the interest of the masses and the Philippine film industry, study and celebrate the achievement that will help define the good Filipino film, and cultivate the knowledge and skills that the film medium was designed for, which is to be a medium of communication and expression of our culture according to the standards and conditions of filmmaking in our country.\"\nIt then went on to become one of the most prestigious film award-giving bodies in the Philippines. Unlike the other award-giving bodies in the country, it has never been tainted with any accusations of vote buying or scandals. This distinction made the Gawad Urian a highly coveted award in the Philippine film industry that is only given to the most deserved winners.\nThe Gawad Urian is known for its infamous ties. At a time when the Filipino award-giving bodies were adamant about awarding ties after the FAMAS rock-up in 1972, the Gawad Urian has given ties in the Best Film category (3 ties), Best Screenplay category (1), Best Actress category (6) and Best Supporting Actress category (2), a dozen ties all in all. It is also known for awarding several lesser-known films produced by small independent production companies. In 2004, Ebolusyon ng Isang Pamilyang Pilipino, a landmark Filipino drama, was awarded Pinakamahusay na Pelikula (Best Film) by Gawad Urian, while it did not receive a single nomination from any award-giving body that year.\nIn 1988, the awards for the films of 1987 were not held because the Manunuri deemed that there was a \"lack of deserving winners,\" which was a first in Filipino awards history.\nIn 2006, the Gawad Urian became the first award-giving body in the Philippine to welcome digital films into competition. Its nominees were swamped with achievement from digital films that year, which prompted the other award-giving bodies to include digital films in its roster of nominations the next year.\nIn 2024, Iti Mapukpukaw became the first animated film in Philippine history to win Best Film at the Gawad Urian.\nAwards ceremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable defaultleft col3center\"\n!Ceremony\n!Date\n!Best Film\n!Lifetime Achievement Award\n|-\n|1st\n|1977\n|Ganito Kami Noon, Paano Kayo Ngayon?\n|Manuel de Leon (producer)\n|-\n|2nd\n|1978\n|Hubad na Bayani\n|Gerardo de Leon (director)\n|-\n|3rd\n|1979\n|Pagputi ng Uwak, Pag-itim ng Tagak\n|Manuel Conde (director, producer)\n|-\n|4th\n|1980\n|Jaguar\n|Manuel Silos (director)\n|-\n|5th\n|1981\n|Manila by Night\n|Lamberto Avellana (director)\n|-\n|6th\n|1982\n|Salome\n|Anita Linda (actress)\n|-\n|7th\n|1983\n|Oro Plata Mata\n|Luis Nolasco (director, writer)\n|-\n|8th\n|1984\n|Broken Marriage\n|Mike Accion (cinematographer)\n|-\n|9th\n|1985\n|Sister Stella L\n|William Smith (sound engineer)\n|-\n|10th\n|1986\n|Kapit sa Patalim\n|Tito Arévalo (actor)\n|-\n|11th\n|1987\n|Takaw Tukso\n|Rosa Rosal (actress)\n|-\n|12th\n|1989\n|Itanong Mo sa Buwan\n|Not awarded\n|-\n|13th\n|1990\n|Pahiram ng Isang Umaga\n|Richard Aberlardo (director)\n|-\n|14th\n|1991\n|Gumapang Ka sa Lusak\n|Susana de Guzman\n|-\n|15th\n|1992\n|Ipagpatawad Mo\n|Mary Walter (actress)\n|-\n|16th\n|1993\n|Ikaw Pa Lang ang Minahal\n|Levi Celerio (film score composer)\n|-\n|17th\n|1994\n|Makati Ave. Office Girls\n|Leopoldo Salcedo (actor)\n|-\n|18th\n|April 29, 1995\n|The Fatima Buen Story\n|Eddie Romero (director)\n|-\n|19th\n|May 11, 1996\n|Sana Maulit Muli\n|Pancho Magalona (actor)\n|-\n|20th\n|May 10, 1997\n|Segurista\n|Felipe Sacdalan (cinematographer)\n|-\n|21st\n|March 28, 1998\n|MIlagros\n|Dolphy (actor)\n|-\n|22nd\n|March 28, 1999\n|Bata, Bata, Paano Ka Ginawa?\n|Mona Lisa (actress)\n|-\n|23rd\n|March 11, 2000\n|Bayaning Third World\n|Nida Blanca (actress)\n|-\n|24th\n|March 24, 2001\n|Tuhog\n|Manahan sisters (makeup artists)\n|-\n|25th\n|May 11, 2002\n|Batang West Side\n|Fernando Poe, Jr. (actor)\n|-\n|26th\n|May 17, 2003\n|''Dekada '70\n|Ricardo Lee (screenwriter)\n|-\n|27th\n|June 19, 2004\n|Babae sa Breakwater\n|Gloria Romero (actress)\n|-\n|28th\n|June 4, 2005\n|Ebolusyon ng Isang Pamilyang Pilipino\n|Jess Navarro (editor)\n|-\n|29th\n|August 3, 2006\n|Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros\n|Eddie Garcia (actor, director)\n|-\n|30th\n|September 13, 2007\n|Kubrador\n|Marichu Vera Perez-Maceda (producer)\n|-\n|31st\n|October 1, 2008\n|Tirador\n|Kidlat Tahimik (director)\n|-\n|32nd\n|September 19, 2009\n|Serbis\n|Peque Gallaga (director)\n|-\n|33rd\n|April 29, 2010\n|Kinatay\n|Armida Siguion-Reyna (actress, producer)\n|-\n|34th\n|May 17, 2011\n|Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria\n|Jose Lacaba (screenwriter)\n|-\n|35th\n|June 13, 2012\n|Ang Sayaw ng Dalawang Kaliwang Paa\n|Rody Lacap (cinematographer)\n|-\n|36th\n|June 18, 2013\n|Ang Paglalakbay ng mga Bituin sa Gabing Madilim\n|Mila del Sol (actress)\n|-\n|37th\n|June 17, 2014\n|Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan\n|Mike de Leon (director)\n|-\n|38th\n|June 16, 2015\n|Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon\n|Nora Aunor (actress)\n|-\n|39th\n|June 22, 2016\n|Taklub\n|Romy Vitug (cinematographer)\n|-\n|40th\n|July 20, 2017\n|Women of the Weeping River\n|Vilma Santos (actress)\n|-\n|41st\n|June 14, 2018\n|Balangiga: Howling Wilderness\n|Winston Raval (film score composer)\n|-\n|42nd\n|June 18, 2019\n|BuyBust\n|Gloria Sevilla (actress)\n|-\n|43rd\n|November 10, 2020\n|Babae at Baril\n|Fiel Corrales Zabat (production designer)\n|-\n|44th\n|October 21, 2021\n|Aswang\n|Lav Diaz (director)\n|-\n|45th\n|October 27, 2022\n|On the Job: The Missing 8 and Big Night!
