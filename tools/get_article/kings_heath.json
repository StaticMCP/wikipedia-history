Historically in Worcestershire, it is the next suburb south from Moseley on the A435 Alcester Road. Since 2018 it has been part of the Brandwood and Kings Heath Ward.\n]]\nHistory\nKings Heath came into being as a village in the 18th century when improvements to the Alcester to Birmingham road acted as a catalyst for the development of new houses and farms. Prior to this the area was largely uninhabited heathland, alternating under the control of Bromsgrove, Moseley, and Kings Norton.\nThe streets running off High Street are dominated by pre–1919 terraced, owner-occupied housing.\nOn 28 July 2005, Kings Heath was hit by a major tornado (by European standards) which damaged several shops on High Street and All Saints' Church. The tornado then moved on to damage many houses in Balsall Heath. There were no fatalities.\nIn 2008, the businesses agreed to establish a Business Improvement District, which top-slices a proportion of their local business taxes to go directly into improvements and promotion of the area. A number of independent shops have taken advantage of comparatively cheap rents in the side roads off High Street, leading to an influx of boutiques and the start of an (organic) café culture.\nDespite being part of Birmingham for over a century – and being closer in size to a town than a suburb – Kings Heath is referred to as a 'village' by some members of the community. A focal point of the suburb is All Saints Square, located at one end of the High Street at the junction of Alcester Road South and Vicarage Road. This was created in the mid-2010s when the churchyard of All Saints' Church was redeveloped into a public square. It is used as the venue for the suburb's monthly farmers' market and other seasonal events.\nResidents and businesses hosted the first annual Queens Heath Pride in September 2021 after \"The Gayborhood Foundation\" named the area one of the world's best 'gayborhoods' alongside the likes of The Castro in San Francisco and The Marais in Paris. The foundation and parade were later revealed to be the brainchild of local resident and comedian Joe Lycett in response to an increase in anti-LGBTQ protests outside schools in Birmingham. Even after this fact was revealed, Queens Heath Pride continues to take place annually on York Road.\nEducation\nKings Heath has several notable schools including  Kings Heath Secondary School, Wheelers Lane Technology College, King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys, King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Girls, and Bishop Challoner Catholic College.\nPublic transport\nKings Heath is served by bus routes 11A/C, 27, 35, 50, 50A, 76 and 150 by National Express West Midlands (11A, 27, 35, 50 and 76) and  Diamond (50, 50A, 150).\nSet to open by the end of 2025, the Camp Hill line will bring three new stations to the area, Pineapple Road, Kings Heath, and Moseley Village, linking directly from Kings Norton to Birmingham New Street and Shrewsbury. The business case has been opened to explore the feasibility of a fourth station, to be rebuilt at the historic Brighton Road Station site, as Balsall Heath.\nFeatures\nThe central shopping area runs along High Street and Alcester Road, and the shops include branches of national chain stores, independent bakeries, butchers and greengrocers, charity shops, supermarkets, electrical retailers and opticians. There are also a number of pubs, churches and schools on and around High Street.\nKings Heath has one park, Kings Heath Park, which is famous as the setting for the popular ATV series Gardening Today. Kings Heath Park has \"Green Flag\" status. It features a Victorian-styled tea room and is the venue for the annual Gardener's Weekend Show, which comes under the Royal Horticultural Society and is one of the top regional events for gardening enthusiasts to show off their vegetables, floral displays, etc.\nThough technically in neighbouring Moseley, Highbury Park is often considered to be Kings Heath's second park. Since the reconfiguring of ward boundaries in 2018 (and the merging of Kings Heath and Brandwood into a single ward) it could be argued that Dawberry Fields Park is also a part of Kings Heath.\nThe Hare & Hounds public house, in Kings Heath High Street, was the location of the first concert by UB40 on 9 February 1979, which is commemorated by a PRS for Music plaque. The pub was rebuilt in 1907, but is Grade II listed, as it has retained many original Art Nouveau internal fixtures.  The pub is still an important local music venue.\nSport and leisure\nKings Heath Stadium was a greyhound track that existed from 1927 until its closure in 1971. The site was first developed in 1923 at Alcester Lane's End on the southern outskirts of Kings Heath as the venue for the annual Kings Heath Horse Show. The ground was converted to include a greyhound track and the first race took place on 21 May 1927. After the Horse Show moved elsewhere in the 1960s, the ground was exclusively used for greyhound racing until being permanently closed in 1971. The land was eventually sold for housing development.\nAn 18-hole golf course opened in 1926 just to the south of the race track along the Alcester Road. This is also the site of the modern Cocks Moors Woods sports and leisure centre, the largest of its kind in south Birmingham.\nKings Heath Baths was an indoor facility on Institute Road that first opened on 15 August 1923. For many years, the swimming pool was drained and floored over during the winter so it could be used as a dance hall, with additional badminton courts also provided. The baths closed in 1987 and the building was subsequently demolished.\nThe Kingsway Cinema opened on High Street in March 1925 and remained open for more than fifty years until its closure in May 1980. The cinema was later converted into a bingo hall, first run by Essoldo Bingo, then Gala Bingo, but eventually closed in 2007. The building was largely destroyed by a fire on 17 September 2011. It was auctioned off in 2016 to a local building development company and demolition work was carried out at the rear of the building in early 2018. The Grade A locally listed facade at the front was largely unaffected by the 2011 fire and the redevelopment plans include restoring this to its former glory.\nNotable residents\n;People born in Kings Heath\n* Tommy Green (1873–1921), footballer who played for West Bromwich Albion\n* Sydney S.

This became a Pride event, and also a theme in his standup show. After four years of Pride promotions, this has stuck, and \"Queens Heath Pride\" runs annually on York Road and Heathfield Road. The event is free to the public, supported by donations, with performances, and food and drink stalls.\nSee also\n* A435 Alcester Road\n* Brandwood Ward\n* Moseley and Kings Heath Ward\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/ Birmingham City Council]\n*[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=Lib-Kings-Heath%2FPageLayout&cid=1223092586607&pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper History of Kings Heath]\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/mapsheet.asp?sheetid=10125&ox=2349&oy=2425&zm=4 1884 Ordnance Survey map of King's Heath]\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/mapsheet.asp?sheetid=9257&ox=1400&oy=1275&zm=2&czm=2&x=189&y=177 1887 Ordnance Survey map of King's Heath]"
