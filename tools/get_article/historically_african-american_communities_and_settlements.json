Many of these municipalities were established or populated by freed slaves either during or after the period of legal slavery in the United States in the 19th century.\nIn pre-segregation Oklahoma, many African-American migrants from the Southeast found a space whereby they could establish municipalities on their own terms. Chief among them was Edward P. McCabe, who envisioned so large a number of African-Americans settling in the territory that it would become a Black-governed state.\nMonroe Work's Negro Year Book editions included a listing of \"Negro Towns and Settlements in the United States.\"\nList\nPlaces marked in italics are no longer populated.
