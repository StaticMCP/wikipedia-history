The recall of public officials is also provided for in many municipalities.\nHistory\nThe progressive movement started discussions about adopting direct democracy across the United States, and Massachusetts developed a local branch. The state branch of the Populist Party adopted the statewide initiative and referendum in its 1895 platform. State representative Henry Stirling proposed some of the first legislation for direct democracy in 1900. It was eventually enacted in 1917 at the state constitutional convention.\nState government\nInitiatives\nThe state allows an indirect form of initiative for laws and constitutional amendments, and the state is considered one of the most restrictive of the states that allow initiatives.\nExcluded subjects\nInitiatives must be confined to one subject and cannot relate to judges and courts, relate only to specific municipalities of the state, relate to religion, make specific appropriations of money, or restrict the Declaration of Rights in the state constitution. The Office of the Attorney General of Massachusetts may do an informal review to ensure it passes these requirements.\nFree petition\nMassachusetts has a unique form of direct democracy in the free petition. This allows any person or group to file a bill in the state legislature, which are treated equally as a bill filed by a representative. The petition must be considered by the legislature and are submitted to a committee for public discussion, and may be voted on and enacted like any other piece of legislation.\nIn practice, this form of direct democracy is rarely successful in enacted new laws. In the 2015-2016 session there were at least 177 bills filed by private individuals in the state, with only four leaving committee for a floor vote and none being enacted.\nMassachusetts is the only state in the country to allow citizens to file bills directly into the legislature.\nAdvisory questions\nThe General Court may put a non binding public policy question on the ballot, and constituents may also hold a nonbinding vote to instruct a representative in the legislature how they should vote on laws. The General Court may also put amendments to the US constitution on the ballot, but they are only advisory\nList of referendums\n1631-1779\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |Summary of Referendums 1631-1779\n|-\n|Accepted\n|11\n|-\n|Rejected\n|3\n|-\n|Unknown\n|1\n|-\n|Total\n|15\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Result\n!Description\n|-\n|1639\n|Accepted\n|Approval of the Body of Liberties\n|-\n|1643\n|Accepted\n|Approval of the Articles of the New England Confederation\n|-\n|1644\n|Rejected\n|Election of deputies by countries instead of towns\n|-\n|1644\n|Unknown\n|Providing compensation for magistrates and deputies\n|-\n|1647\n|Rejected\n|Reducing the number of deputies to one from each town.\n|-\n|1689\n|Accepted\n|Resumption of the Charter revoked in 1684\n|-\n|1689\n|Accepted\n|Further consideration of the above question\n|-\n|1765\n|Accepted\n|Compensation for damages done by the mob in Boston\n|-\n|1776\n|Accepted\n|Approval of the Declaration of Independence\n|-\n|1776\n|Accepted\n|Permitting Council and the House of Representatives to frame a constitution.\n|-\n|1777\n|Accepted\n|Instructing Representative to act with Council in framing a constitution\n|-\n|1778\n|Rejected\n|Approval of the Articles of Confederation of the United States\n|-\n|1778\n|Rejected\n|Ratification of the Constitution of 1778\n|-\n|1779\n|Accepted\n|To determine whether the people desire a new constitution\n|-\n|1779\n|Accepted\n|Shall the representatives call a new constitutional convention?\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Source\n|}\n2000-\n* 2002 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2004 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2006 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2008 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2010 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2012 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2014 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2016 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2018 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2020 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2022 Massachusetts ballot measures\n* 2024 Massachusetts ballot measures\nSee also\n* Elections in Massachusetts\n* Direct Democracy\n* Initiatives and referendums in the United States\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
