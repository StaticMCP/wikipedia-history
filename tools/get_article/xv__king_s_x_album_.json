It is the band's second album after 2005's Ogre Tones to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 145. The album also charted on the Independent Albums chart (peaking at No. 12) and Billboard Comprehensive Albums (peaking at No. 167). The Roman numeral XV means 15, as this is their 15th album, counting live albums and compilations.
