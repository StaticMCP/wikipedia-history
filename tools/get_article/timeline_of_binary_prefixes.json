Early decimal computers included the ENIAC, UNIVAC&nbsp;1, IBM 702, IBM 705, IBM 650, IBM 1400 series, and IBM 1620. Early binary addressed computers included Zuse Z3, Colossus, Whirlwind, AN/FSQ-7, IBM 701, IBM 704, IBM 709, IBM 7030, IBM 7090, IBM 7040, IBM System/360 and DEC PDP series.\nDecimal systems typically had memory configured in whole decimal multiples, e.g., blocks of 100 and later . The unit abbreviation  or  if it was used, represented multiplication by . Binary memory had sizes of powers of two or small multiples thereof. In this context,  or  was sometimes used to denote multiples of  units or just the approximate size, e.g., either '64K' or '65K' for  (216).\n1790s\n1793\n* The French Commission temporaire de Poids & Mesures rêpublicaines, Décrets de la Convention Nationale, proposes the binary prefixes double and demi, denoting a factor of 2 (21) and  (2−1), respectively, in 1793.\n1795\n* The prefixes double and demi are part of the original metric system adopted by France (with kilo for 1000) in 1795. These were not retained when the decadic SI prefixes were internationally adopted by the 11th CGPM conference in 1960.\n1870s\n* Metric prefix \"\" established in 1873.\n1930s\n* Metric prefixes \"\" (established 1795) and \"\" (established 1873) are widely used as decimal multipliers 1,000 and 1,000,000 for units of frequency and impedance in the electronics industry.\n* The Committee of the Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker publishes suggested names and symbols for the metric prefixes with decimal meaning, i.e.,  (&nbsp;=&nbsp;109) and  (&nbsp;=&nbsp;1012).\n1940s\n1943–1944\n* J. W. Tukey coins the word \"bit\" as an abbreviation of \"binary digit\".\n1947\n* \"The Whirlwind I Computer is planned with a storage capacity of  numbers of 16 binary digits each.\"\n1948\n* Tukey's \"bit\" is referenced in the work of information theorist Claude Shannon.\n1950s\n* In the 1950s, \"1 bit\" meant  bits:\n** \"In the '50s, amazingly enough—and only total coincidence—I actually was given the job of writing the operational specifications [...] for what was called cross telling. They handed me this thing and said, 'You're going to define how the hand-over process works between direction centers', [...] and I had no idea what they were talking about. But we had [...] one-kilobit lines connecting the direction centers and I thought, 'Good God!  bits a second. Well, we'll surely be able to figure out something to do with that. — Saverah Warenstein, former programmer at Lincoln Laboratory, IBM\n1952\n* The first magnetic core memory, from the IBM 405 Alphabetical Accounting Machine, is tested successfully in April 1952. (The image shows 10&nbsp;×&nbsp;12 cores; presumably one of 8)\n** \"Teaming up with a more experienced engineer, [Mike Haynes] built a core memory with just enough capacity to store all the information in an IBM punched card: 960 bits in an 80&nbsp;×&nbsp;12 array. In May 1952 it was successfully tested as a data buffer between a Type 405 alphabetical accounting machine and a Type 517 summary punch. This first functional test of a ferrite core memory was made in the same month that a four-times smaller 16&nbsp;×&nbsp;16-bit ferrite core array was successfully tested at MIT.\"\n* The IBM 701, a binary-addressed computer containing 72 Williams tubes of  bits each, is released in April.\n** Principles of Operation Type 701 does not use prefixes with lengths of words or size of storage. For example, it specifies that memory tubes hold  words each.\n** The IBM 737 optional magnetic core storage stores  36-bit words. Each plane stored 64&nbsp;×&nbsp;64 =  bits.\n1955\n* The IBM 704 (a binary machine) manual uses decimal arithmetic for powers of two, without prefixes\n** \"Magnetic core storage units are available with capacities of either  or  core storage registers; or two magnetic core storage units, each with a capacity of  core storage registers, may be used. Thus, magnetic core storage units are available to give the calculator a capacity of , , or  core storage registers.\"\n** \"Each drum has a storage capacity of  words.\"\n1956\n* The IBM 702 (a decimally addressed machine)  Preliminary Manual of Information uses decimal arithmetic for powers of ten, without prefixes.\n** \"Electrostatic memory is the principal storage medium within the machine. It consists of cathode ray tubes which can store up to  characters of information in the form of electrostatic charges ... Additional storage, as required, may be provided through the use of magnetic drum storage units, each having a capacity of  characters.\"\n** \"A character may be a letter of the alphabet, a decimal number, or any of eleven different punctuation marks or symbols used in report printing.\"\n** \"Each one of the  positions of memory is numbered from  to  and each stored character must occupy one of these positions.\" (page 8)\n* The word byte, meaning eight bits, is coined by Dr. Werner Buchholz in June 1956, during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer.\n* IBM 650 RAMAC (a decimal addressed machine) announcement\n** \"The 650 RAMAC combines the IBM 650 Magnetic Drum Data Processing Machine with a series of disk memory units which are capable of storing a total of 24-million digits.

The 32K store started mass production in 1956; it is the standard now for large machines and at least 200 machines of the size (or its equivalent in the character addressable machines) are in existence today (and at least 100 were in existence in mid-1959).\n1955–1961\n* A search of the Computer History Museum's Stretch collection of 931 text documents dated from September 1955 through September 1961 shows no usage of 'k' or 'K' to describe main storage size.\n1961\n*  bits)''' per second.}}\n** Quoted in OED as first instance of \"bit\", though \"it is more usual\" suggests it is already in common use (see timeline entry for 1957)\n* Described device contains 512 words, 24 bits each (=&nbsp; bits)\n* \"It is no longer reasonable to spend as much time to transmit an 80-bit address as 12&nbsp;bits of message information – a 1500 to 1 ratio&nbsp;...
