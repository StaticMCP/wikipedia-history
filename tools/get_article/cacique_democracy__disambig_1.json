The term was originally coined by Irish-American political scientist Benedict Anderson.\nHistory\nThe Philippines was a colony of Spain from the late sixteenth century until the Philippine Revolution of 1898. But the United States, despite promising independence like Cuba, bought the country and wrestled control, succeeding by 1902. The U.S. administration subsequently introduced many commercial, political and administrative changes, trade limits, agricultural and immigration sanctions, and machine importation restrictions. They were sometimes quite progressive and directed towards the \"modernization\" of government and commerce in the Philippines. However, the local traditional Filipino elites, being better educated and better connected than much of the local population, were often able to take advantage of the changes to bolster their positions.\nEtymology\nThe Spanish word  comes from the Taíno word , meaning \"to keep house.\" In Spanish America, Brazil, Spain, and Portugal, the term also has come to mean a political boss or leader who exercises significant power in the political system known as , and is sometimes translated as \"Bossism.\" In various Austronesian languages, , along with its cognates, is a title similar to , and had historically been conferred upon the ruler of a maṇḍala or precolonial fiefdom.\nSee also\n*Kedatuan\n*Maṇḍala\nReferences"
