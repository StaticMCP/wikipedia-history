Created in 1991 in memory of book editor and publisher Gordon Montador, the award was presented until 1999, when it was superseded by a reorganization of the Writers' Trust Awards. The Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing, presented for the first time in 2000, encompassed much of the same subject area; although the Cohen award was never formally stated by the organization to be an official replacement for the Montador award, no new winner was ever announced for the Montador award after the Cohen award was introduced.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n!Year\n!Author\n!Title\n!Result\n!Ref.\n|-style=background:#FAEB86\n! align=center rowspan=6| 1993\n| Ronald Wright\n| Stolen Continents\n| Winner\n|\n|-\n| Doris Anderson\n| The Unfinished Revolution\n| rowspan=5| Shortlist\n| rowspan=5|\n|-\n| Pat Capponi\n| Upstairs at the Crazy House\n|-\n| Mordecai Richler\n| Oh Canada!
