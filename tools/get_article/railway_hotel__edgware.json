E. Sewell for Truman Hanbury Buxton, brewers,  and opened in 1932.\nThe historic building closed in 2006 after not reaching health and safety standards. In 2013 the building was added to Historic England’s Heritage At Risk register. On 11 July 2016, having been empty, the building caught fire in the early morning.\nDamage and uncertainty\nThrough the 2010s there were several owners, none making any significant progress. In 2016 an arson attack left a portion of the ground floor destroyed and the public began to fear developers would build new apartments after a lack of support from the council.\nA petition, launched in 2016 to Historic England in an attempt to try and restore the building, received 2,287 signatures.\nAnnounced in 2017 the building was listed at public auction with a minimum value of £2 million.\nRenovation\nIn September 2018, it was announced that the building would be renovated and turned into a restaurant. Work on this was reported to be underway, although it has yet to be completed as of 2024.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*http://www.francisfrith.com/uk/edgware/edgware-railway-hotel-1948_e126003\n*http://boakandbailey.com/2016/08/pub-preservation-railway-hotel-edgware/"
