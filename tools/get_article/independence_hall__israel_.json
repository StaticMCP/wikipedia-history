It is located on the historic Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv, Israel.\nIt was originally built as the home of Meir Dizengoff and his wife Zina. Dizengoff later entrusted architect Carl Rubin to redesign the building in the International Style. Dizengoff gifted the building to the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality, and it housed the Tel Aviv Museum of Art from 1932 to 1971. It is currently a museum dedicated to the signing of the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the history of Tel Aviv;  it is closed to the public for renovations.\nHistory\nDizengoff\nAt the vicinity of where Independence Hall now stands, sixty-six families gathered on April 11, 1909, to conduct a lottery for plots of land in a new Jewish neighborhood, to be known as Ahuzat Bayit. Meir and Zina Dizengoff acquired plot number 43, on which they built their home. It was originally a simple and symmetrical house, built of kurkar stone.\nMeir Dizengoff served as the head of the new neighborhood council. In 1910, at a general meeting, the residents of Ahuzat Bayit, inspired by Theodor Herzl's Altneuland (English: Old-New Land), unanimously decided to rename their neighborhood Tel Aviv. As the neighborhood grew and became a city, Dizengoff became its first mayor. Zina was a socialite and hosted European-style salon gatherings at the home.\nDizengoff made several renovations to the property, including the addition of a rear wing where the declaration of independence took place. Dizengoff hired the architect, Carl Rubin, who redesigned the building in the international style.\nTel Aviv Museum of Art\nIn 1930, after the death of his wife, Dizengoff donated his house to his beloved city of Tel Aviv and requested that it be turned into a museum. The house underwent extensive renovations and became the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1932. In 1933, the museum hired the art historian, Dr. Karl Schwarz to head the burgeoning museum. Schwarz immigrated to Mandatory Palestine to take up the position, leaving behind his role as head of Berlin's first Jewish museum. At the time of his appointment he wrote a guest column for Haaretz newspaper, setting out his vision for the museum: \"A nurturing institution, from which education will emerge, reflecting the artistic development in other countries; where one can study the works of the country's great artists; [and] which fosters and provides for artists living and working in the country—a place where new ideas are given impetus. That is what the Tel Aviv Museum should be.\" He stayed on with the museum until 1947, enhancing the art collection, preparing exhibitions and creating a library for the history of art and cinema.The museum moved to its current location at 27 Shaul Hamelech Blvd, in 1971. The larger, purpose-built building was more appropriate and allowed the museum to expand.\nIndependence declaration\n, Ben Gurion's biographer, lecturing in the restored main hall, 2012]]\nIn the main hall of the building, at 4 PM on May 14, 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), in the presence of the members of the Vaad Leumi (Jewish National Council) and the leaders of the Yishuv, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel, eight hours before the British Mandate of Palestine was due to end.\nAfter Ben-Gurion read the Declaration of Independence, Rabbi Fischman (Maimon) recited the Shehecheyanu blessing, and the Declaration was signed. The ceremony concluded with the singing of Hatikvah, now Israel's national anthem.\nIn the 24 hours prior to the ceremony, considerable efforts were made to prepare the hall. A $200 budget was allocated for the decor and decorations, and Israeli flags were loaned from the Jewish National Fund. Seating for the audiences was also provided by nearby cafes. A small stage was also constructed, made from timber purchases at a thrift store. A portrait of Theodor Herzl was also hung in a central position above the stage. Art works portraying nudity were covered, carpets were laid on the floors and windows were darkened over fears of an air raid. The invited guests were sworn to secrecy and the art museum was closed to the public during these preparations. In spite of the pact of secrecy, a crowd formed outside the building at noon on the day of the ceremony. The declaration and celebrations were photographed by Rudi Weissenstein.\nRecent history\nBy the 1970s, the building was in a neglected physical state, crumbling and with mice problems. In 1978, the hall was restored to resemble its appearance at the time of the declaration of independence and opened to the public. It has since been a museum dedicated to the signing of the declaration and the history of Tel Aviv-Yafo. The upper floors of the building have housed a Bible museum, featuring archaeological artifacts and works of art with biblical themes.\nHowever, as the surrounding Rothschild Boulevard underwent a revival, and neighboring properties were restored, the hall appeared shabby and rundown in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2009, the \"Independence House Law\" was enacted to \"restore and preserve the building [...] as it is of national and historical importance in the history of the people and the state.\" Urgent renovations on the building were undertaken by  architect Uri Glazer in 2012. During these works, a ceramic relief by German-born Israeli artist, Chava Samuel was discovered behind a board.\nIn 2013, it was revealed that the building was earmarked for a major renovation project in the coming years, creating an \"innovative museum\" in the space. The building is currently closed to the public as it undergoes these extensive renovations. Glazer and Gal & Matsliah Architects won a design competition to restore the building and are being assisted by the engineer, Moshe Kazes.\nGallery\nFile:PikiWiki Israel 69787 telaviv council in dizengoffi39s house.jpg|16 Rothschild Boulevard (Dizengoff House), home of Meir and Zina Dizengoff, in 1910, Dershowitz collection\nFile:Karl Schwarz Tel aviv musem003.jpg|Art historian, Dr. Karl Schwarz, who headed TA Museum of Art, 1935\nFile:Karl Schwarz Tel aviv musem004.jpg|Dr. Karl Schwarz at Tel Aviv Art Museum in 1935\nFile:Karl Schwarz Tel aviv musem005.jpg|Carl Rubin, Meir Dizengoff and Moshe Kaniuk during the renovation of the Tel Aviv Museum, 1935, Meir Dizengoff Collection, Eretz Israel Museum.\nFile:Karl Schwarz Tel aviv musem007.jpg|Walter Tzedek, Meir Dizengoff's coffin placed in the Tel Aviv Museum, September 24, 1936.
