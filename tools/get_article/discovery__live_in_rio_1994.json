It was recorded in December 1994 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil as part of the Discovery Tour. It was originally released as a concert film on VHS and LaserDisc in 1995, before being reissued in its original standard-definition video format on DVD alongside the live album in 2021.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Clash\n| rev2score = 9/10\n| rev3 = Pitchfork\n| rev3score = 8.1/10\n}}\nReviewing the album for AllMusic, Paul Simpson called the release on CD and DVD \"long overdue\" and the concert \"electric\", writing that \"the duo know when to dial the energy down a notch from time to time, so that everyone involved avoids the risk of short circuiting and burning out\" and \"the arrangements totally embrace the type of hyper-glitzy Euro-dance which was everywhere at the time\". Emma Harrison of Clash felt that the concert \"showcases their musical prowess with ease\", describing it as \"an exhilarating celebration of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe's illustrious back catalogue\". Nadine Smith of Pitchfork complimented the \"queerer take\" on Blur's 1994 song \"Girls & Boys\", as well as Tennant and Lowe \"seamlessly\" mashing up their own tracks \"One in a Million\" and \"Left to My Own Devices\" with \"contemporary club cuts\" \"Mr. Vain\" by Culture Beat and \"The Rhythm of the Night\" by Corona, respectively. Smith also felt that by doing reinterpretations of other's work as well as their own, the duo \"suggest pop's potential as a living medium beyond recorded product, a songbook of standards that express universal sentiments but are open to individual reinterpretation\". She concluded that \"In their hands, the setlist becomes a collage, curating a century of pop music history in one jukebox.\"\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Discovery: Live in Rio 1994\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2021)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
