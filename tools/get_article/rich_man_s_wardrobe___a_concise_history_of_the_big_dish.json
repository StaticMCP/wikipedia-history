No tracks from the band's 1991 album Satellites are included.\nBackground\nVirgin first made plans to release a Big Dish compilation album in 1991, following the band's Top 40 success with their single \"Miss America\", released on East West Records. Lindsay was critical of the band's former label's decision and he told the New Musical Express in 1991, \"We've heard that Virgin are already putting together a compilation of the first two albums to cash in on the 'Miss America' success – the bastards. They couldn't give a shit when we were actually on the label and now they're doing this.\"\nCritical reception\n}}\nUpon its release, Record Collector considered ''Rich Man's Wardrobe'' to be a \"respectful collection\" and described the Big Dish as \"basically a pop vehicle for Steven Lindsay's quaint observations on life\". They added, \"Although at first glance the Big Dish seemed to be cynically commercial, there was a certain aplomb to Lindsay's talents that lent his songs a similar appeal to those of say, Momus.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nProduction\n* Ian Ritchie – producer (tracks 1, 3, 12, 14–15)\n* Paul Wickens – producer (tracks 2, 9)\n* Bruce Lampcov – producer (tracks 4, 7–8, 10–11)\n* Paul Hardiman – producer (track 5)\n* The Big Dish – producers (tracks 6, 13)\nOther\n* Walker Evans – church photography (front cover)\n* Simon Fowler – front cover photography\n* Ronnie Gurr – sleeve notes\nReferences"
