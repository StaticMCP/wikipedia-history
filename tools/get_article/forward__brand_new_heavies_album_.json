The album peaked at No. 15 on the UK Hip Hop and R&B Albums Chart and No. 37 on the UK Independent Singles and Albums Chart.\nCritical reception\n| rev2      = Daily Express\n| rev2score =\n}}\nAndy Kellman of AllMusic, in a 3.5/5 star review, with praise wrote \"Forward is more uptempo and disco-oriented than the slower and slightly funkier Get Used to It. N'Dea Davenport joins the band's core trio once more...Forward is a delightful return that focuses on the Heavies' love of smooth late-'70s/early-'80s sounds.\"\nKen Capobianco of the Boston Globe claimed, \"The Brit funk-soul band’s first record in six years is a solid, if uneven, effort that marks a reunion with N’Dea Davenport...The Heavies hardly veer from their organic party vibe, and it sounds as if the last 15 years in pop music never happened...Mostly, the Heavies stay true to the groove.\"\nStephen Unwin of the Daily Express, in a 3/5 star review, remarked, \"Sitting pretty on that CD stack, sandwiched between En Vogue and Sade, is something by The Brand New Heavies and it just, you know, feels right?\"\nTrack listing\nReferences"
