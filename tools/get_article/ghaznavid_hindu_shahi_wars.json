Led primarily by Mahmud of Ghazni () the Ghaznavids aimed to expand their empire through conquest and plunder, targeting the wealth of the Indian subcontinent.\nThe wars culminated in the decisive defeat of the Hindu Shahis by 1026 CE, resulting in the loss of their territories, to the Ghaznavids. These conflicts marked the end of Hindu Shahi rule and facilitated the expansion of Islamic influence into northern India, setting the stage for further Muslim conquests in the region.\nBackground\nThe Ghaznavid Empire was Turco-Persian Muslim dynasty that ruled from 977 AD to 1186 AD. Their empire extended from the Oxus River to the Indus Valley, encompassing Persia, Transoxiana, Afghanistan, and parts of northern India.\nGovernor of Ghazna Alp-Tegin fought against the Hindu Shahi dynasty. Following the accession of Sabuktigin (), numerous expeditions were carried out against Jayapala, annexing the frontier of his kingdom upto Lamghan. After Mahmud was recognised as a independent sovereign by the Abbasid Caliph in 998, he resolved to lead an expedition to India every year.\nCampaigns under Sabuktigin\nConflicts with Hindu Shahi and Lawik\nBattle of Charkh (977 AD)\nBöritigin, was a slave of Alp-Tegin, served as the Samanid governor of Ghazna from 974/975 to 977. During his rule, the people of Ghazni revolted against Samanids, and invited Abu Ali Lawik of the formerly ruling Lawik dynasty to come back to Ghazni, take the throne, and overthrow Böritigin. The Hindu Shahis supported the Lawiks and Jayapala sent his son to help Lawiks in the invasion with 40,000 forces. When the allied forces reached Charkh on the Logar River, they were attacked by 500 cavalry forces of (son-in-law of Alp-Tegin) Sabuktigin, who killed both Abu Ali Lawik and Jayapala's son and captured a huge number of enemy army, ten elephants.\nBattle of Ghuzak (987 AD)\nWhen Sabuktigin ascended the throne in 977, he captured Bost, Qusdar, Bamyan, Tokharistan, Ghur and some frontier parts of Hindu Shahi during his early reign. For retaliation, Jayapala arranged big number of troops to attack Ghaznavids around 986-7 AD. Sabuktigin met Shahis near the hill called Ghuzak. Both forces started to attack each other and fought bravely, but the sudden snowstorm created havoc in the army of Jayapala and he was forced to sue for peace. Mahmud who was a prince at that time advised his father to continue fight against Jayapala. But Sabuktigin feared that if he continues fight against them then Hindus will burn themselves so all the valuables gifts and rich peace offering he might lose. Peace was granted to Jayapala and he paid 1,00,000 dirhams, 50 elephants and some frontiers forts to Sabuktigin. Sabuktigin annexed the whole of the territory between Lamghan and Peshawar and introduced Islam among the people of this region who were probably followers of Buddhism.\nSabuktigin kept some relatives of Jayapala as a hostage and also sent some officers with Jayapala to take command of those forts.\nBattle of Laghman (991)\nJayapala was sued for peace shortly after rejected the treaty. When Sabuktigin's envoys reached for tribute, Jayapala captured and imprisoned the officers and declared “I will not release these men, unless Sabuktigin sets free the hostages he has taken from me.” This move of Jayapala made Sabuktigin angry that he marched against the Shahi territory, Plundered Laghman, destroyed temples and set fire to houses.\nSabuktigin's bold move forced Jayapala to retaliate and he asked for help from Hindu Rajas of Delhi, Ajmer, Kannauj and Kalinjar. He gathered 100,000 forces, including infantry and cavalry. Two powerful troops met in Laghman and it is said that Sabuktigin climbed the top hill to get information about the allied army\nSabuktigin immediately called the meeting of his officers for new strategy and he broke up his all forces into light squadron of 500 horses. He orders his officers to attack the specific points till it broke, the strategy worked and they defeated Shahi forces and drove the Jayapala and his allies back to Indus, annexing Lamghan and Peshawar.\nCampaigns under Mahmud\nConflicts with Jayapal\nBattle of Peshawar (1001 AD)\nMahmud ascended the throne in 998 AD. In 1000 AD, he launched his first campaign in India seizing few fortresses. In September 1001, he marched against Hindu Shahi at Peshawar with picked 10,000 or 15,000 cavalry. Jayapala brought 12,000 cavalry, 30,000 infantry and 300 elephants to face Muslims.\nOn 28 November 1001, the engagement occurred and continued till noon but Hindu Shahi's unable to stand against the repeated attack of Muslim cavalry, broke and fled away leaving 5,000-15,000 dead on the battle ground. Jayapala alongside with his fifteen sons and grandsons were taken prisoners. Mahmud then marched to the capital Waihand, where the Hindus ensued second battle but was defeated. Although peace was concluded between them and Jayapala had to pay 250,000 dinars as ransom with 50 war elephants. Later Jayapala immolated himself due to the humiliation, succeeding Anandapal to the throne. According to al-Utbi, Mahmud enslaved 500,000 people during this invasion. Mahmud then returned to Ghazni in April 1002.\nConflicts with Anandapal\nBattle of Indus (1006 AD)\nMahmud turned his attention towards Multan and the route was under the control of Anandapal. Mahmud asked for permission to let him pass but Anandapal rejected the permission which filled Mahmud with anger.\nMahmud marched to punish Anandapal before attacking Multan. Both forces met face to face but sultan inflicted a crushing defeat on Anandapal and he escaped to Kashmir. Mahmud continues his march against the ruler of Multan, defeated him after the siege of seven days and brought Multan under his control. Sultan wanted to bring whole region under his control but in the meantime he heard the news that his kingdom was invaded by Kara-Khanid Khanate. He put Sukhapala in charge of Multan and marched to Khorasan.\nRebellion of Sukhapala (1007-8)\nAnandapala and his son Sukhapala converted to Islam. The territory of Bhera was assigned to Sukhapala as his new name was Nawaz Shah. While Sultan Mahmud was busy in war with Kara-Khanid Khanate Sukhapala abjured Islam and revolted.

Anandpal appealed to the rulers of Ujjain, Gwalior, Kalinjar, Kannauj, Delhi, Ajmer and local pagan Gakhars marched to the Punjab with their troops. Anandapal sent his son with huge forces and taken up his position in the Chach's plain to prevent the Ghaznavid army from crossing the river.\nThe armies were inactive for 40 days and hesitating to come in open field, but sultan decided to attack first and sent 6,000 archers to provoke Hindus to begin the fight. They crossed the river and fought against Shahis and in the meantime 30,000 Khokhar with various weapons attacked and rushed into the armies of Mahmud and killed 5,000 forces of Mahmud in a short time.

Mahmud marched from Ghazna in 1013 AD but was forced to return because of heavy snow falls. He started again in 1014 AD during spring and marched to Nandana. Trilocanapala}} learned the intentions of Mahmud, so he put his son Bhimpala incharge of fort and hurried to Kashmir for seeking help.\nBhimapala took up his position in a narrow pass and ordered some lines of elephants to strengthen fort. Mahmud spread his warriors and Afghans spearmen around to provoke Shahis into action. It took him some days before he could lure Hindu's detachment into plain and then put it to rout.\nBhimapala received fresh troops. Believing in his superior numerical forces, he left his plans and position and began to give battle in open. Bhimapala ordered the charge of elephants but sharpshooter of Ghaznavids poured showers of arrows on their trunks and eyes. It cause panic in elephants and Hindus position was broken down.

But some how eight personal bodyguards of Sultan jumped into the river and crossed it which boosted the morale of other soldiers. All jumped into the river and successfully crossed it without a loss of single life.
