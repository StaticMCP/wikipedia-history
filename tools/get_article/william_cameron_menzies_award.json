Named after the pioneering American production designer and director William Cameron Menzies, the award recognizes individuals who have contributed extraordinary achievements in production design or visual storytelling that reflect Menzies' innovative legacy.\nBackground\nWilliam Cameron Menzies (1896–1957) was an acclaimed American art director and filmmaker, widely considered one of the founding figures of modern production design. He was the first person to be credited as a \"production designer\" for his work on Gone with the Wind (1939), a title created to reflect his overall visual authority on the project.\nThe Menzies award is not given annually, but on a select basis to recipients whose contributions to the visual arts in film or television are deemed truly outstanding.\nRecipients\nThe William Cameron Menzies Award has been presented to the following recipients:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ List of Recipients\n!
