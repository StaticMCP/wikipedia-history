John Robbins, author of the influential book Diet for a New America, and his son, Ocean Robbins, sought to create a platform that could empower individuals to make informed food choices and advocate for systemic change in food systems.\nPrior to co-founding Food Revolution Network, both John and Ocean Robbins had founded the non-profits: EarthSave International and YES! (Youth for Environmental Sanity), respectively. But after becoming frustrated with the financial limitations of non-profits, John and Ocean created a social profit organization: Food Revolution Network.\nFood Revolution Network launched in 2012 with its first online program, The Food Revolution Summit — an annual online event featuring dozens of experts in plant-based nutrition, health, the environment, and the industrialized food system. Notable former speakers include Paul McCartney, Tony Robbins, and Jane Goodall.\nSince 2023, the event has adopted a docuseries format after previously being audio-only.\nSee also\n*Baskin-Robbins\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[https://vegnews.com/the-untold-vegan-story-of-baskin-robbins The Untold Vegan Story of Baskin-Robbins]\n*[https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2022/1/john-robbins John Robbins]\n*[https://www.today.com/health/meet-man-who-walked-away-baskin-robbins-empire-t149050 The man who walked away from the Baskin-Robbins empire]"
