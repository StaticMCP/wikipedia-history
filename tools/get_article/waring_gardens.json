It was designed by John Waring, the first Town Clerk of Deniliquin,  and built from 1880 to 1888 by staff of the Deniliquin Council. It is also known as Cressy St Gardens.\nHistory\nWhen John Waring arrived in Deniliquin in 1855, the lagoon was a dirty water hole being blamed for sickness and death in the community.\nIn 1869 when he held the position of Town Clerk he advised the council to turn the lagoon into a garden. In 1880 the Council cleared the area and planted willows, continuing to plant various shrubs and trees in the following years. The gardens were set up as a Botanic Garden to experiment and see what would grow in the area. The gardens also contained a large aviary.\nIn 1885 a curator of the gardens was appointed. Waring died that same year and in 1888 a ceremony was performed to officially open the gardens, and an obelisk erected in Waring's honour.\nImprovements continued. A band pavilion were built in 1913 and was in use for many years until a fire in 1960 almost destroyed it. In 1961 the deck was lowered from the original height of 7 feet from the ground down to 3 feet as \"people complained the music was going over their heads\". Local builderBrian Smith was contracted to do the alterations.\nThe Soldiers Memorial was unveiled in 1922.\nWhen the School of Arts was demolished in 1974, the three statues (The Muses) were placed in the gardens (these have subsequently been relocated to the corner of Edwardes and Cressy Street at the Multi Arts Centre complex).\nThe Boer War Memorial, originally erected in 1902 at the intersection of Cressy and Edwardes Streets, was relocated to a position in the Waring Gardens, then shifted back to its original site at the intersection in 2001.\nThe fence surrounding the Waring Gardens was originally a white picket fence. This was replaced by a woven wire fence, and then by a low brick fence. The cannon/ gun was removed from the garden in 2004 to be refurbished by the Deniliquin RSL sub branch.\nDescription\nImportant fixtures are still located in the gardens, such as the obelisk honouring John Waring, a small pavilion, band rotunda,  fountain, and the War Memorial Gates at the north west corner of the gardens. The old footbridge has been replaced with one of modern materials. Children's play equipment has been introduced, as have modern seats.
