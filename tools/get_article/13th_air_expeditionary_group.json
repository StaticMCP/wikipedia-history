The group was equipped with a mix of Douglas B-18 Bolos and North American B-25 Mitchells.  In June, the group moved to Orlando Army Air Base, Florida.\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, the group was ordered to search for German U-boats off the southeast coast.  Although the Navy was responsible for long range patrolling, it lacked the aircraft to perform the mission and the Army Air Forces (AAF) performed the mission, even though its crews lacked proper training. As antisubmarine warfare assets were realigned to meet the growing threat in the North Atlantic, the 13th Group moved to Westover Field, Massachusetts in January 1942. The following month, the 3d Reconnaissance Squadron was assigned to the group, and, in April, became the 393d Bombardment Squadron.\nIn October 1942, the AAF organized its antisubmarine forces into the single Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command, which established the 25th Antisubmarine Wing the following month to control its forces operating over the Atlantic. Its bombardment group headquarters, including the 13th, were inactivated.\nExpeditionary operations\nThe group was converted to provisional status, redesignated the 13th Air Expeditionary Group and assigned to Pacific Air Forces to activate or inactivate as needed.  It has been used primarily to control operations or exercises for Thirteenth Air Force.  This has included acting as the air component of Joint Task Force-Support Forces Antarctica.   The group commander is dual hatted as the deputy commander, JTF-SFA.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 13th Bombardment Group (Medium) on 20 November 1940\n: Inactivated on 30 November 1942\n* Redesignated 13th Air Expeditionary Group and converted to provisional status\n:: Activated 2 October 2003\n:: Inactivated 31 October 2003\n:: Activated 2 February 2004 for Exercise Balikatan 04\n:: Inactivated 1 April 2004\n:: Activated 5 February 2004 for Exercise Cope Tiger 04\n:: Inactivated 9 March 2004\n:: Activated 11 January 05 for Exercise Cope Tiger 05\n:: Inactivated 8 February 2005\n:: Activated 30 January 2006 for Exercise Cope Tiger 06\n:: Inactivated c.
