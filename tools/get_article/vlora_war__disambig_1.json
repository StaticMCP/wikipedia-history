Vlorë, occupied by Italy since 1914, was attacked four times by Albanian nationalists. While repelling the attacks, the Italian troops suffered from an outbreak of malaria and could not receive support as the Bersaglieri of Ancona refused to be sent to Albania, in the context of the Biennio Rosso agitations. Italian prime minister Giovanni Giolitti, considering the occupation of Vlorë pointless and unpopular, negotiated a treaty of compromise with the Albanians. This resulted in Italy abandoning its plans to make Albania a mandate and ending the occupation of Vlorë, while it retained diplomatic protection over Albania to ensure its independence and annexed the island of Saseno. The armistice agreement was confirmed a year later by the Conference of Ambassadors of the League of Nations, confirming Albanian sovereignty and the Italian special interests.\nThe Vlora War is considered an important moment in the history of the Albania's independence. At the same time, the 1920 treaty of Tirana is considered the first of the Treaties of Tirana, which gradually brought Albania into the Italian sphere of influence. Both the Albanian committee and the Italian foreign ministry claimed victory and expressed satisfaction with the agreements; many authors do not treat these clashes as forming an actual conflict and the very concept of a \"Vlora War\" is rare in historiography.\nBackground\nBefore joining the Triple Entente as an ally in World War I, the Kingdom of Italy signed the secret Treaty of London. Under this agreement, Italy promised to declare war on Germany and Austria-Hungary within one month in exchange for territorial gains at the end of the war. Articles 6 and 7 of the treaty dealt with the promised territories in Albania that Italy would receive:\nAt the Paris Peace Conference in 1920, the Allies had not yet decided on the future of Albania, but Italy's claims to sovereignty over Vlorë had never faced a significant challenge. Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti also sought a mandate over the rest of the country following the secret Treaty of London.\nCourse of war\nThe conflict began on 4 June 1920, after Italian General Settimo Piacentini refused to cede control of the Vlora district to the Albanian government. Previously, Albania had successfully expelled most of the Italian occupation from the country. After Italy refused the request of Ahmet Zogu—the Albanian Minister of the Interior at the time—to continue the evacuation, the Albanians formed the National Defense Committee, led by Qazim Koculi, and began recruiting volunteers. Ahmet Lepenica took command of the force, which consisted of about 4,000 soldiers. The Albanian rebels were poorly armed; some did not carry firearms and resorted to sticks and stones. In the area around Vlora, there were about 25,000 Italian soldiers equipped with artillery.\nThe Albanians fought in the Vlora region and were joined by local volunteers, resulting in a force of over 10,000 irregular fighters. Despite the increase in numbers, only up to 4,000 Albanians participated in the conflict. This force included the , an Albanian military band formed in the United States that traveled by boat for 23 days to reach Durrës. The advance of the Albanian troops and the communist revolutionary movements, coupled with riots in the Italian army, made it impossible to reinforce the Italian soldiers in Vlora. As a result, the Italian soldiers barricaded themselves in Vlora, facing malaria and communist agitation in their ranks, and without receiving any orders; they defended the city from four attacks on 5 June, 6 June, 11 June, and 24 July.\nEnd of hostilities\nThe military stalemate continued for three months until the Italian and Albanian governments signed the Treaty of Tirana on 2 August 1920, which ended the conflict.\nIt was the first diplomatic agreement between Albania and a foreign country. The pact prevented further partition of the territory of the Albanian state. Albania managed to achieve full recognition by the Western powers of its independence within its 1913 borders.\nThe armistice, introducing a ceasefire on August 5th, contained these main points:\n# The Italian Government completely acknowledged the independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of Albania, within the frontiers defined in 1913 by the Conference of Ambassadors in London.\n# The Italian government relinquished its protectorate proclaimed in 1917 and the occupation and administration of Vlorë and its hinterland, and renounced all claims against Albania and all interference in Albanian political affairs, and abandoned the idea of a mandate over the country.\n# The Italian government agreed to withdraw its war materials from Vlorë and its hinterland, to evacuate all its holdings on the Albanian mainland, and to repatriate at an early date the Italian troops actually stationed in Vlorë and on the littoral, and all its forces still remaining in other parts of Albanian territory with the exception of the garrison on the island of Sazan at the entrance of the Vlorë bay; Italy retained the permanent possession only of the island of Sazan, but remained in temporary occupation of Cape Linguetta and cape Treporti, both dominating Vlorë bay, with the right to fortify them; the detachment of troops at Shkodër was also to remain in that town.\n# There would take place an exchange of prisoners, the liberation of arrested persons under a general mutual amnesty, and the settlement of outstanding questions concerning the private interests of Albanian and Italian subjects.\nThe Treaty of Tirana was ratified by the League of Nations Conference of Ambassadors in November 1921. It recognized Italian special interests in Albania while reaffirming Albanian independence. Giovanni Giolitti, the Italian Prime Minister at the time, expressed his satisfaction with the treaty in these words:\nHowever, Benito Mussolini referred to Vlora as the \"Albanian Caporetto\". Upon taking power, he also ensured Albanian independence and caused the 1923 Corfu crisis after a border disagreement with Greece.\nOrders of battle\nAlbanian order of battle\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed collapsible\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Albanian order of battle\n|-\n!Force\n!Commander\n|-\n|Forces from Shullëri\n|Commander Kalo Telhai\n|-\n|Forces from Kutë\n|Commander Rrapo Çelo and Halim Rakipi\n|-\n|Forces from Dukat\n|Commander Sheme Sadiku and Hodo Zeqiri\n|-\n|Forces from Lumi i Vlorës\n|Commander Sali Vranishti\n|-\n|Forces from Fëngu\n|Commander Muço Aliu\n|-\n|Forces from Kanina\n|Commander Beqir Velo\n|-\n|Forces from Salari\n|Commander Selam Musai\n|-\n|Forces from Kurvelesh\n|Commander Riza Runa\n|-\n|Forces from Fterra\n|Commander Xhaferr Shehu\n|-\n|Forces from Mallakastër\n|Commander Bektash Çakrani and Halim Hamiti\n|-\n|Forces from Skrapar\n|Commander Riza Kodheli\n|-\n|Forces from Berat\n|Commander Seit Toptani and Izedin Vrioni and Fani Shuka\n|-\n|Forces from Peqin\n|Commander Adem Gjinishi\n|-\n|Forces from Gjirokastër\n|Commander Javer Hurshiti and Xhevdet Picari\n|-\n|Forces from Çamëria\n|Commander Alush Seit Taka and Muharrem Rushiti\n|-\n|Forces from Korça\n|Captain Ferit Frashëri and Tosun Selenica\n|-\n|Forces from Tirana\n|Captain Ismail Haki Kuçi\n|-\n|Albanian-American Volunteers\n|Captain Aqif Përmeti and Kareiman Tatzani\n|}\nItalian order of battle\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed collapsible\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Italian order of battle\n|-\n!
