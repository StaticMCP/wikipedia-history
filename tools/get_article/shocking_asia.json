A co-production between West Germany and Hong Kong, the film was banned in Finland due to its graphic content. A sequel titled Shocking Asia II: The Last Taboos was released in 1985.\nContent\nAs with most other films of similar nature (such as Faces of Death and Traces of Death), Shocking Asia does not follow a traditional narrative structure, instead neglecting plot for images and video footage of bizarre and macabre situations such as animal cruelty, strange rituals, footage of deformed children and a sex change operation. Most of the clips used are claimed to be real, although this has yet to be verified.\nC. Spencer Yeh's \"Shocking Asia\" is a sequel which was on view at Empty Gallery, Hong Kong, in February 2018.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
