The revolt was led by seven Muslim leaders in Xinjiang, including Walī Khan, Katta Khan, Kichik Khan and Tawakkul Khoja. The rebels, backed by Kokand Khanate, attacked on Kashgar, Yarkand and Yangi Hisar in the name of a \"holy war\". The revolt was unsuccessful, but it could in some ways be seen as the initial stages of the uprisings against Qing rule in Altishahr.\nSee also\n* Xinjiang under Qing rule\n* Afaqi Khoja revolts\nReferences"
