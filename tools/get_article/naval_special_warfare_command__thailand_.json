A small element within the Navy SEALs has been trained to conduct maritime counter-terrorism missions. The unit has close ties with the United States Navy SEALs and conducts regular training exercises.\nHistory\nIn 1952, the Thai Ministry of Defence considered forming a diving unit. At a meeting with the Royal Thai Army and Royal Thai Police, it was agreed that the Royal Thai Navy would be responsible for establishing the unit. Representatives of the Thai Navy met with officers from the United States Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to discuss possible training. On 13 June 1952, the Thai Navy approved the training program for the diving unit that included Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) training. Unfortunately at the time there were not enough instructors from the United States to conduct training, and so it was temporarily put on hold.\nIn 1953, the Overseas Southeast Asia Supply Company (SEA Supply), a CIA front company that provided assistance to the Thai Police, offered to provide the initial diving training to the Thai Navy and also to the Thai Police, which had received parachute training. The Thai Navy approved a contingent of seven personnel and the Thai Police approved a contingent of eight personnel to receive training at Saipan island in the United States. At Saipan island, the Thai Navy and Thai Police received eleven weeks training. The Thai Navy contingent requested further training and the establishment of a Thai Navy Underwater Demolition Team on 24 November 1953 under the command of a Lieutenant.\nIn 1956, the Royal Thai Navy formed a small combat diver unit. In 1965, the unit was expanded and reorganized with US Navy assistance.  Three years later, it was again reorganized with US Navy assistance, dividing the unit between an underwater demolitions team and a SEAL team. The UDT was tasked with salvage operations, obstacle clearance, and underwater demolitions. The SEAL team was tasked with reconnaissance and intelligence missions.\nIn the 1991 book South-East Asian Special Forces by Kenneth Conboy, the author wrote that the Navy SEALs were organized into two units, SEAL Teams One and Two, with a strength of 144 personnel with each SEAL Team divided into four platoons. On 18 March 1991, the Navy SEALs were re-designated as the Naval Special Warfare Group, Royal Thai Fleet and were to report directly to the Royal Thai Fleet. The unit was expanded and organised into three divisions: special combat, special warfare school, and support.\nOn 7 August 2008, the Naval Special Warfare Group was re-designated as the Naval Special Warfare Command, Royal Thai Fleet, in order to increase the unit size and its capability for dealing with any future threats.\nOrganization\n* Naval Special Warfare Command Headquarter\n** Naval Special Warfare Training Center\n** 1st Naval Special Warfare Group\n** 2nd Naval Special Warfare Group\nTraining Course\nTraining on an assault course takes about 7–8 months. It is considered the longest military training course in Thailand, divided into 5 periods as are following;\n* Introduction to basic training practicing exercise and solving various obstacles takes approximately 3 weeks.*\n* Actual training, lasting 6 weeks.\n* Intense training, known as \"Hell Week\", lasting 120 hours continuously without breaks.\n* Various tactical training\n* Tactical training in real conditions, lasting approximately 2 months.\nOperational deployments\nMost of the operations of the Navy SEALs are highly sensitive and are rarely divulged to the public. Navy SEALs have been used to gather intelligence along the Thai border during times of heightened tension.\nNavy SEALs have participated in anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Thailand. They have also participated in salvage and rescue operations, and have supported Royal Thai Marine Corps training exercises.\nThai Navy SEALs have deployed on Royal Thai Navy warships for anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia as part of Combined Task Force 151. The CTF 151 was established on 12 January 2009 as a response to piracy attacks in Somalia. The task eventually were succeed as a piracy events in the region have been reduced.\nOn February 13, 2013, the Battle of Bacho occurred when 50 RKK members attacked a Royal Thai Marine base garrisoned by the 2nd Rifle Company, 32nd Task Force Narathiwat. The base had already prepared due to receiving clues about the plans to attack the stronghold 2–3 days before. The marine commander had put in a defensive strategy with reinforcements consisting of 11 members of Recon and 17 Thai Navy SEALs. The clash resulted in 16 attackers killed in action and no casualties on the Thai side.\nIn June 2018, Navy SEALs responded to a request for assistance to search for a junior football team in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave system. The Navy SEALs coordinated a rescue of the football team from the flooded cave system with assistance from international cave and support divers.\nTotally 127 current and former Navy SEALs participated in the rescue. While delivering supplies for the rescue, former Navy SEAL Petty Officer 1st class Saman Kunan died after losing consciousness underwater and could not be resuscitated. A year after the rescue, another Navy SEAL, petty officer 1st class Beirut Pakbara died following a blood infection he contracted in the caves.\nHowever, all junior football team members including 12 junior football players together with their assistant coach were safely rescued.\nEquipment\nSmall arms\n{| class=\"wikitable\";\" width=\"70%\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"width=\"18%\"|Name\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"width=\"20%\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\"width=\"18%\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; background:#acc;\"width=\"18%\"|Caliber\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Notes\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | Pistol\n|-\n| H&K USP Compact || || Semi-automatic pistol || 9×19mm Parabellum ||\n|-\n| Glock 19 || || Semi-automatic pistol || 9×19mm Parabellum ||\n|-\n| Heckler & Koch P7 ||  || Semi-automatic pistol || 9×19mm Parabellum || P7M8\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | Assault rifle\n|-\n| Heckler & Koch G36 ||  || Assault rifle || 5.56×45mm NATO || G36KV\n|-\n| SCAR-H and SCAR-L ||  || Assault rifle || 7.62×51mm NATO 5.56×45mm NATO || SCAR-H and SCAR-L.\n|-\n| Bushmaster M4 ||  || Assault rifle || 5.56×45mm NATO ||Carbon-15\n|-\n| SIG Sauer SIG516 ||  || Semi-automatic rifle || 5.56×45mm NATO ||\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | Grenade launcher\n|-\n| Heckler & Koch AG36 ||   || Grenade launcher || 40mm  ||\n|-\n| Milkor MGL ||   || Grenade launcher || 40mm ||Milkor M32\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | Submachine gun\n|-\n| Heckler & Koch MP5 ||  || Submachine gun || 9×19mm Parabellum ||MP-5KA4/MP-5SD3\n|-\n| Heckler & Koch UMP ||  || Submachine gun|| 9×19mm Parabellum ||UMP-9\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | General-purpose machine gun\n|-\n| Heckler & Koch HK23E ||  || General-purpose machine gun || 5.56×45mm NATO ||\n|-\n| M60 machine gun ||  || General-purpose machine gun|| 7.62 x 51mm NATO ||U.S. Ordnance M60E4\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" |Anti-materiel rifle and Sniper Rifle\n|-\n| KAC SR-25 ||  || Designated marksman rifle || 7.62 x 51mm NATO ||\n|-\n| Heckler & Koch PSG1 ||  || Semi-automaticSniper rifle || 7.62 x 51mm NATO ||\n|-\n| Heckler & Koch MSG-90 ||  || Semi-automaticSniper rifle || 7.62 x 51mm NATO ||\n|-\n| Accuracy International AW50 ||  ||  Anti-materiel rifle  || 12.7 x 99mm ||\n|-\n| Barrett M82 ||  || Anti-materiel rifle || 12.7 x 99mm ||\n|-\n| Barrett M98B ||  || Sniper Rifle || .338 Lapua Magnum ||\n|-\n|}\nSpecial Operations Crafts\n{| class=\"wikitable\";\" width=\"70%\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"width=\"15%\"|Class\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"width=\"18%\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\"width=\"28%\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Notes\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | Special Operations Craft\n|-\n| Por.51 ||  || Special Operations Craft||4 x Marsun M18 FAB\n|-\n| Tor.241 ||  || Special Operations Craft ||3 x Seafox Mk.IV SWCL\n|-\n|Zodiac||  || Combat Rubber Raiding Craft||Zodiac Rigid-Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB)\n|-\n|}\nEngagements\n* Cold War\n** Communist insurgency in Thailand\n** Communist insurgency in Malaysia\n** Third Indochina War\n** Vietnamese border raids in Thailand\n* Global War on Terrorism\n** OEF - Horn of Africa\n** Combined Task Force 150\n** Anti-Piracy operation in Gulf of Aden\n* Southern Insurgency\n** Battle of Bacho (2013)\n* Anti-Piracy in strait of Malacca\n** MT Orkim Harmony hijacking\n* Tham Luang cave rescue\n* 2025 Cambodia–Thailand clashes\nIn popular culture\n* 2018: The Crown Princess is a Thai television series, premiered on May 14, 2018  and last aired on June 19, 2018 on Channel 3.
