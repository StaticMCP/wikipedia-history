It was formed on May 27, 1943, by Executive Order 9347.\nIt was headed by James F. Byrnes, a former U.S. Senator and Supreme Court Justice. Byrnes had previously been head of the Office of Economic Stabilization, which controlled prices and taxes. The OWM supervised the OES, and also the War Production Board and other agencies. It was re-titled the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion on October 3, 1944.\nByrnes' authority as head of the OWM was so far-reaching, he was dubbed the \"assistant President\".\nSee also\n*Office of War Information\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://archive.today/20121212015755/http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/brochures/Mobilization/mobpam.htm Mobilization in World War II] brochure at the US Army Center of Military History."
