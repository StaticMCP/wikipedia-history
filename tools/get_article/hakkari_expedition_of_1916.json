On May 23, they left to Bashqalan and reached Qudchanis on May 27 and found only a thousand cossacks guarding it.\nBattles in the mountains of Hakkari\nFrom Qudchanis the Assyrians split into two branches the first under the leadership of Malik Ismail went to darawa where he met Tyaraye who had re-established themselves in their former villages and the second under Dawid Mar Shimun went on the road to Jurlamerk, they reached Tkhuma and found it in ruins and empty. In Tkhuma both forces met and, after several fierce battles, many inaccessible Kurdish castles and fortresses were destroyed.\nSoon after the army returned for Chal, whose fortress was in very mountainous terrain, but after the Assyrians divided themselves in three groups (the first led by Malik Ismail, the second led by Malik Khammo of the Baz tribe and the third led by Malik Shamizdin), the Assyrians attacked all the villages around and looted many sheep and cattle. Dawid Mar Shimun waited until the whole Assyrian force pulled out and the booty from the looting was divided.\nAssyrian retreat into Urmia\nBefore leaving Malik Ismail told the Tyaraye who had reestablished themselves in their homes that the Russian Army had returned from Qudchanis to Bashqalan and that the assyrians that returned to Hakkari wouldn't withstand the Ottomans and Kurds on their own and that it would be best for them to join the Assyrians in Urmia and Salmas. On June 29, all the Assyrian fighters who partook in the expedition returned to Russian occupied Iran.\nSee also\n* Battle of Seray Mountain\n* Urmia Clashes\n* Battle Charah\n* Battle of Suldouze\n* Persian Campaign\n* Sayfo\n* Assyrian Rebellion\n* Assyrian Volunteers\n* Assyrian Levies\n* Mar Benyamin Shimun\n* Mar Paulos Shimun\n* Agha Petros\n* Malik Khoshaba\n* Surma Mar Shimun\n* Simko Shikak Revolt (1918-1922)\n* Simko Shikak Revolt (1926)\nReferences"
