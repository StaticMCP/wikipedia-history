The role of the Church Historian and Recorder is to keep an accurate and comprehensive record of the church and its activities. His office gathers history sources and preserves records, ordinances, minutes, revelations, procedures, and other documents. The Church Historian and Recorder also chairs the Historic Sites Committee and Records Management Committee, and may act as an authoritative voice of the church in historical matters.\nHistory\nThis office is based on revelations to Joseph Smith calling for keeping records and preparing a church history. Oliver Cowdery, the first in this position, originally recorded meeting minutes, patriarchal blessings, membership information, priesthood ordinations, and a kind of narrative church history. For a time, the callings of Church Historian and Church Recorder were separate, but in 1842 these callings were merged and now the Church Historian also acts as the Church Recorder.\nIn 1972, the '''Church Historian's Office was renamed to become the Historical Department. In 2000, this department was merged with the Family History Department to become the Family and Church History Department. On March 12, 2008, the Church Historian separated again from the Family History Department to become the Church History Department.\nWhile the majority of Church Historians and Recorders have been general authorities of the church, there have been some exceptions to the practice.\nChronology\nIn the following tables, general authorities are listed in bold. The date ranges span from the sustaining date to the release date unless otherwise indicated.\nChurch Historian and Church Recorder\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 1095px\"\n|-\n!

Therefore, he is widely regarded as the first unofficial Church Historian and Recorder.\n|-\n| 1831-35\n| John Whitmer\n|\n|\n|\n| Whitmer was called to be the Church Historian by a revelation to Smith, which is now Doctrine and Covenants [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/47?lang=eng section 47]. He was the first official historian of the Latter Day Saint church.\n|-\n| 1835-37\n| John Whitmer\n|\n| Oliver Cowdery\n|\n| Beginning in 1835, a new calling of \"Recorder for the Church\" was created, with Oliver Cowdery being the first appointee.\n|-\n| 1837-38\n| John Whitmer\n|\n| George W. Robinson\n|\n| Robinson was sustained \"as General Clerk & recorder of the whole Church\" to replace Cowdery.\n|-\n| 1838\n| John Corrill\n|\n| George W. Robinson\n|\n| Corrill and Higbee were both called to this position at the same time.
