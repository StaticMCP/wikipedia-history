The first single from the project, titled \"Push It Down\", was released on 24 April 2023, accompanied by a music video. Following that, the second single, \"Misscommunikaty\", was released on 20 July 2023. Devine described the song as being \"about feeling disconnected in an overly connected world\". On 29 August 2023, the album was announced for pre-order, coinciding with the release of its third single, \"Laundry Day\". A fourth single, \"Slippin Away\", was released on 6 October 2023.\nTrack listing\n| length7      = 3:02\n| title8       = Placeholder\n| length8      = 3:41\n| title9       = Bully\n| length9      = 3:39\n| title10      = On and Off\n| writer10     =\n| length10     = 2:30\n| title11      = Hater\n| length11     = 2:44\n| title12      = Laundry Day\n| length12     = 3:09\n}}\nPersonnel\n* Olivia Devine – lead vocals (all tracks), production (tracks 1, 5, 7, 11)\n* Jay Flew – production\n* Barry Grint – mastering\n* Nathan Boddy – mixing\n* Gabi King – drums (tracks 2–4, 10)\n* Joe Atkinson – piano (track 2)\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Chart performance for Digital Heartifacts\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Release dates and formats for Digital Heartifacts\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Format(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Label\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Various\n| 2 February 2024\n|\n| AWAL\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" |\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.clashmusic.com/features/l-devine-breaks-down-new-album-digital-heartifacts/ L Devine's track by track explanations of Digital Heartifacts] at Clash website"
