Edward Pulsifer, a prominent Hennepin businessman, had the house built in 1844, four years after he came to the city. Pulsifer began his enterprise by running a general store with his brother; his later ventures included local real estate and a shipping business on the Illinois River. His house is designed in the Federal style and is one of Putnam County's best remaining examples of the style. The -story brick house is topped by a gable roof; the brick in the gables forms a projecting coping at the top, and each gable has paired chimneys at its peak. Brick parapets connect the pairs of chimneys, a stylistic element often seen in Federal architecture in Illinois. The entrance and the roof line feature matching dentillated entablatures; the entrance also features a transom, sidelights, and flanking pilasters.\nThe house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1979.\nReferences"
