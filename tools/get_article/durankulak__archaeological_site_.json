Prehistoric settlement commenced on the small island approximately 7000 BP and lasted for thousands of years.\nThe first inhabitants were the Hamangia culture, dated from the middle of the 6th millennium to the middle of 5th millennium BC, and were the first manifestation of the Neolithic life in Dobrudja. Hamangia people were small-scale cultivators and plant collectors who built houses, made pottery, herded and hunted animals. Around 4700/4600 BC the stone architecture was already in general use and became a characteristic phenomenon in the settlement that was unique in Europe. Durankulak lake was a well-organized aggregation of buildings of substantial size with several rooms. They were coherently laid out according to a plan that was repeated over successive generations of house reconstructions. Buildings were rectilinear and large, narrow paths separated individual houses, which stood alone or abutted by other buildings. The structures were robust and made of large wooden posts sunk into foundation trenches and joined with wooden planks or branches covered with mud or clay. In all building horizons, except for in the earliest ones, buildings were internally divided into separate, mainly rectilinear, rooms.\nStone structures and bases from the houses are well preserved and there is a cave and some cisterns to see. Durankulak is one of few monuments left from early farming societies in Europe and tell us about daily life.\nThe excavation in Durankulak took part between 1974 and 1997 when 1204 prehistoric burials were carefully recorded and the remains of 25 houses were found.\nFile:Sgrada 5 VII 96.jpg|Durankulak, eneolithic stone foundations\nFile:Sofia - Skeleton from the Durankulak Necropolis.jpg|Burial at the Durankulak necropolis\nFile:08 ENEOLIT-Ceramik.tif|Eneolithic ceramic vessels from the Golemja Ostrov Tell near Durankulak (RIM-Dobrich)\nFile:Bilding-24-VII.jpg | Building No. 24/VII – Hamangia IV culture.
