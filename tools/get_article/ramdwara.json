It is a place of worship for the people who believe in Ramsnehi Sampradaya, which advocates chanting of \"Ram\" (राम). Ramsnehi means \"People who love God\". Their way of worshipping God is simple. People of all faiths, castes, sections etc. visit at the Ramdwaras. This concept of Ram or Rama is distinct from the Hindu deity Rama.\nOrigin of Ramsnehi\nRamsnehi Sampradaya is a spiritual and religious tradition originating in 1817 Vikram Samwat in Bhilwara city of Rajasthan by the disciple of Swami Shri Ram Charan Maharaj who provided the spiritual and philosophical basis for the sect.\nIn present time, Ramsnehi Sampradaya has four major monasteries. All are in Rajasthan, India.  They are in the following cities:\n*Shahpura, Rajasthan\n* Banwara, Rajasthan\n*Sodha, Rajasthan\n*Bhilwara, Rajasthan\nSmaller Ramdwara centres are located at various places in states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi.\nSwami Ji Shree Ram Charan Ji Maharaj came to Shahpura from Bhilwara and did Tapasya (deep meditation).\nAt the place where Swami Ram Charan Ji Maharaj's body was cremated, a giant Ramdwara has been built. This is now the chief Ramdwara of Ramsnehi Sampradaya.\nThis Ramdwara is also called Ram Niwas Dhaam or Ram Niwas Baikunth Dhaam.\nConstruction\nThe Shahpura Ramdwara was sponsored by the then King of Shahpura, Maharaja Amar Singh, and his brother Chattra Singh.\nIt was built by constructors named Jarror Khan and Kushal Khan. This is also a great example of the brotherhood of Hindus and Muslims in India.\nAll the marble stones used in construction were sourced from a place near the north border of nearby village named Kanti.\nThere is a speciality in all used marble stones that each marble stone has a picture and stone mark on it as of Hindi (Devnagari) alphabets of the construction of word \"Ram\" (Lord Ram), bow, saint, India's map, sword, lion, monkey and other natural pictures.\nThe main (and base) structure of Shahpura Ramdwara is an octagon shaped shiny marble pillar which is about 12 feet long. This pillar is situated at the cremation place of Ram Charan Maharaj. This pillar is called the Samadhi Stambh.\nThe floor above the pillar is called Baradari (a kind of summer house with several open marble gates). A rectangular stone is placed in the center of Baradari which is just over the main pillar.\nThe Baradari has 108 small pillars which make 84 open gates.\nThe construction was done in different phases.\nMonks of Ramdwara\nThe monks of RamSnehi Sampradaya are identical by their dressing code. They wear a robe coloured a very light pink. After taking oaths, monks can not return to their family and must treat the whole world equally and fairly, without any prejudices. They are supposed to follow all the defined rules strictly.\nWay of worship and belief\nRamsnehis believe in the name of God (Ram राम) and do not believe in idolatry. A Ramsnehi only follows the simple and easily defined rules. Ramsnehis just do Darshan of the chair of current Acharya and monks. They pay respects to all the previous (departed) acharyas and saints as well.\nRamsnehis remember the name राम (Ram, a name of the Lord).  Three main pillars of the ideology are:\n*Have the Name of God (राम) in your Heart\n*Have mercy for every living being\n*Be ready to serve any needy person\nSpiritual succession (leaders) in Ramsnehi Sampradaya\nThe following are the Acharyas who successively led the Ramsnehi Sampradaya after Ram Charan:\n#Ram Jan\n#Dulhe Ram\n#Chhatra Das\n#Narayan Das\n#Hari Das\n#Himmat Ram\n#Dilshudh Ram\n#Dharam Das\n#Daya Ram\n#Jagram Das\n#Nirbhay Ram\n#Darshan Ram\n#Ram Kishor\n#Ram Dayal (present)\nRam Dayal is the present Acharya.\nGallery\nfile:frontbaradari.JPG|Baradari Picture From Front\nfile:ramdwara2.JPG|Another View of Ramdwara\nfile:doorwaytoSS.jpg|Door Way to Samadhi Stambh\nfile:SamadhiStambh.JPG|Samadhi Stambh\nSee also\n* Shahpura, Bhilwara\nReferences\nSources\n*Sant LakshyaRam  (Vikram Samwat 2015).
