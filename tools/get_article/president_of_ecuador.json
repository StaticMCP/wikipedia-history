It is the highest political office in the country as the head of the executive branch of government. Per the current constitution adopted in 2008, the president can serve two four-year terms. Prior to that, the president could only serve one four-year term.\nThe current president of Ecuador is Daniel Noboa, who was first elected in 2023 and re-elected in 2025. Having been sworn in at age 35, Noboa is the second youngest president in Ecuadorian history, after Juan José Flores.\nHistory\nThe presidency of Ecuador has been marked by periods of instability, causing the office to change hands frequently throughout the history of the country. At least five times, presidential duties have been assumed by a provisional government or a military junta. Often, the office has been left to an interim or acting president, many of whom would go on to become president. The president who has had the most terms in office is José María Velasco Ibarra, who served five.\nIn May 2017 Rafael Correa became the first President in over two decades to complete his terms in office since Sixto Durán Ballén, who served from 1992 to 1996. Before Correa, a period of deep political instability from 1996 to 2006 also saw a grave economic crisis in 1998–2000. During this time, Durán Ballén's three elected successors, Abdalá Bucaram, Jamil Mahuad and Lucio Gutiérrez, were deposed in popular revolts, followed by military or legislative ''coups d'état'', in 1997, 2000, and 2005, respectively. Since Correa, Lenín Moreno had also completed a full, four-year term (2017–2021), despite a large 2019 popular revolt that nearly toppled his government.\nList of presidents\nLatest election\n|vp6=Verónica Silva\n|party6=Socialist Party – Broad Front of Ecuador\n|votes6=53940\n|cand7=Jimmy Jairala\n|vp7=Lucía Vallecilla\n|party7=Democratic Center\n|votes7=40559\n|cand8=Jorge Escala\n|vp8=Pacha Terán\n|party8=Popular Unity\n|votes8=40483\n|cand9=Henry Cucalón\n|vp9=Carla Larrea\n|party9=Movimiento Construye\n|votes9=37316\n|cand10=Luis Felipe Tillería\n|vp10=Karla Rosero\n|party10=Avanza\n|votes10=33239\n|cand11=\n|vp11=Blanca Sacancela\n|party11=Creating Opportunities\n|votes11=26768\n|cand12=Víctor Araus\n|vp12=Cristina Carrera\n|party12=People, Equality and Democracy\n|votes12=22678\n|cand13=Carlos Rabascall\n|vp13=Alejandra Rivas\n|party13=Democratic Left\n|votes13=22270\n|cand14=Enrique Gómez\n|vp14=Inés Díaz\n|party14=SUMA Party\n|votes14=18815\n|cand15=Juan Cueva\n|vp15=Cristina Reyes\n|party15=AMIGO Movement\n|votes15=17545\n|cand16=\n|vp16=María Luisa Coello\n|party16=\n|votes16=11985\n|invalid=765649\n|invalid2=763180\n|blank=243573\n|blank2=75956\n|total=11264489\n|total2=11394247\n|electorate=13732194\n|electorate2=13731145\n|source=[https://elecciones2025.cne.gob.ec/ CNE (first round)], [https://resultados2025.cne.gob.ec/ CNE (first round)], [https://elecciones2025-2v.cne.gob.ec/ CNE (second round)], [https://resultados2025-2v.cne.gob.ec/ CNE (second round)]\n}}\nSee also\n*Politics of Ecuador\n*List of presidents of Ecuador\n*Vice President of Ecuador\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080912173904/http://www.presidencia.gov.ec/modulos.asp?id=89 Official website of the Ecuadorian government on their presidential history]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20021124103603/http://www.edufuturo.com/educacion.php?c=206 Edufuturo's website on Presidents of Ecuador]  (Retrieved 14 January 2024)"
