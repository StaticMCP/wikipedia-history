After the Trpimirović dynasty, they are the most well known Croatian dynasty in the Early Middle Ages.\nThe dynasty was named after Domagoj, the first member of the dynasty known by name. The most famous of the Domagojević dynasty members are Domagoj (founder) and Branimir, but the relation between Domagoj and Branimir is controversial, as some historians think that Branimir was a son of Domagoj, other think they were in some other family relation, or that there was no family relationship between them at all.\nDukes of Croatia\n*Domagoj (864&ndash;876)\n*Unnamed son of Domagoj (876&ndash;878)\nUncertain\n*Branimir (879&ndash;892)\nSee also\n* List of rulers of Croatia\n* Duchy of Croatia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Croatia.html Members of the Domagojević family among the Croatian statesmen (in English)]\n*\n*[http://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/Povijest_Hrvatske_I._(R._Horvat)/Ban_Domagoj The History of Croatia (in Croatian)] by Rudolf Horvat"
