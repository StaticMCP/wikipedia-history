At the close of voting, it had received 11 points, placing sixth in a field of 16.\nBackground\nThe song is in the chanson style and features Jürgens wondering why bad things need to happen, such as flowers dying and the object of his affections ignoring him.\nThe song was recorded in English (first by Matt Monro, with later versions by Brenda Lee with Richard Williams, Peter Grant, Al Martino, Nancy Wilson and Timi Yuro among others), in Italian and in Spanish as \"Vete por favor\" by Matt Monro, on each occasion featuring similar sentiments.\nFollowing the contest,  representative Matt Monro had a hit with his English-language version of \"Warum nur, warum?\", entitled \"Walk Away\" (lyrics by Don Black, with whom Monro attended the Eurovision contest). Monro came second in the 1964 Eurovision Song Contest with the Tony Hatch song,  \"I Love the Little Things\".\nChart performance\nMatt Monro version\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1964-65)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|UK Singles (Official Charts Company)\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|US Billboard Middle-Road Singles\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|23\n|}\nExternal links\n*[http://www.diggiloo.net/?1964at Lyrics to \"Warum nur, warum\" at The Diggiloo Thrush website]\nReferences"
