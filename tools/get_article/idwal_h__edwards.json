He was a distinguished commander, rated command pilot, combat observer and aircraft observer.\nEarly life and education\nHis father was Daniel Edwards, a native of Wales, Pennsylvania, and a Baptist minister who served churches across Pennsylvania. Idwal Edwards entered Bloomsburg State Normal School in December 1911 to prepare for a teaching career, graduating with the class of 24 June 1914. He was honored at commencement for excelling in both scholarship and teaching ability.\nBefore joining the military, Edwards became principal of schools in Sterling, near Scranton, and entered Brown University in fall 1916. According to the Welsh Nation newspaper, Idwal Edwards was a Welsh-speaker, Cymraeg being his family language.\nAfter joining the Army and gaining his commission as an officer, Edwards attended the Command and General Staff School before attending the Army War College in 1938.\nMilitary career\nHe entered the Army in 1917 in the Infantry branch, and in February 1918 was transferred to the Army Air Service, a part of the Signal Corps at the time. Edwards was later chief of staff for the European Theater of Operations during a period of World War II. He helped create the Code of Conduct for U.S. servicemen who become prisoners of war at the direction of President Dwight D. Eisenhower because of the \"brain washing\" of American prisoners during the Korean War.\nEdwards is credited as a force that helped to bring the practice of segregation in the military to an end. While assigned as deputy chief of staff for personnel, concerning the issue of integrating the military, Edwards stated segregation was unnecessary, promised eventual integration, but also stated that segregation remained Air Force policy. As evidence of progress, Edwards pointed to the peaceful integration of black officers in training at Randolph Field. Edwards further stated that air force policy was considered \"the best way to make this thing work under present conditions.\" Later Edwards told Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington, perhaps some recommendation \"looking toward the integration of whites and negroes in the same units may be forthcoming\" from the Air Board's study of racial policy which was to commence the first week in May. 26 July 1948, President Harry S. Truman's executive order eventually ended racial segregation in the armed forces with the last all-Black unit disbanded in 1952.\nAssignments\n* 1917 – Enlisted in the Army\n* 1918 – Transferred to the Army Air Corps\n* Until World War II, assigned in the Philippines, in Hawaii, and at many stations in the continental United States.
