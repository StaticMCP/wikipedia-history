All members met in secondary school in Waterford and for these years went under a number of guises, performing covers in pubs and clubs throughout  Waterford city. The five went to college in Cork and during this period, evolved into an original outfit now called O Emperor in 2009.\nDebut album: Hither Thither\nHither Thither was record after the individual members left college in 2009. The group located to a country house in Kinsale, County Cork and over the course of 9 months, self recorded and produced their debut album.\nThe record was released through Universal Records Ireland in October 2010 and went on to the nominated for a Choice Music Prize (Irish Album of the Year 2010)\nPresent\nThe group spent most of 2012 recording material for their second album Vitreous, which was released on June 14, 2013. Two tracks from this session Electric Tongues/Erman Gou were issued as a standalone double A-side single in November 2012.\nVitreous was self-recorded and produced in the band's very own studio (Big Skin HQ) in Cork city. Big Skin was (literally) built from the ground up and everything from label administration to recording happens inside its grubby, fire-stained walls. The resulting recordings are a direct representation of this operation, being the band's most potent and distinct work to date; a stamp moulded from their many meandering sessions there.\nWhile debut Hither Thither could be described as a lush tapestry displaying a classical use of depth and shading, Vitreous presents the listener with a starker, polychrome and pixelated picture. Heavily distorted drums take their place alongside syrupy analogue synths and disgusting fuzz guitars sounding like bees buzzing inside tin cans. Beautiful landscapes are destroyed with disparate, abrasive sounds in perverse displays of artistic self-destruction.\nIn March 2015, the EP Lizard was released.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! style=\"width:220px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications\n|-\n!style=\"width:5em;font-size:85%\"|IRL\n|-\n|2010\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Hither Thither\n*Released: October 1, 2010\n*Label: Universal Music Ireland\n*Formats: CD, digital download\n| 6\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|2012\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Hither Thither (Expanded Version)\n*Released: April 16, 2012\n*Label: K&F Records\n*Formats: CD, digital download\n| —\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|2013\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Vitreous\n*Released: June 14, 2013\n*Label: BigSkin\n*Formats: CD, digital download, LP\n| 38\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|2018\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jason\n*Released: November 2, 2018\n*Label: BigSkin\n*Formats: CD, digital download\n|  —\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:90%\"| \"—\" denotes a title that did not chart.\n|}\nExtended plays\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! style=\"width:220px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n!style=\"width:5em;font-size:85%\"|IRL\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2010\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Persephone\n*Released: January 13, 2010\n*Label: Self Released\n*Formats: CD\n| —\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Reverie\n*Released: April 16, 2010\n*Label: Universal Ireland\n*Formats: CD, digital download\n| 32\n|-\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2015\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lizard\n*Released: March 2, 2015\n*Label: BigSkin\n*Formats: CD (Only on stage), digital download\n| —\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:90%\"| \"—\" denotes a title that did not chart.\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.oemperor.com Official Website]\n* [http://www.facebook.com/OEmperor Facebook]\n* [http://www.last.fm/music/O+Emperor Last FM]"
