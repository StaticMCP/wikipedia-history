The comedic routine must air in the United States during the calendar year for eligibility; and must be released on any variety of cable, pay-per-view, or streaming services—but social media accounts do not qualify.\nEligibility is open to both individual comedians or an ensemble group as well. Finally, there will be a total of six nominees per year.\n\"The Golden Globes has a rich history of supporting and celebrating the work of comedians, and we’re thrilled to honor their brilliance,\" Golden Globes president Helen Hoehne stated, upon revealing new categories.\nWinners and nominees\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"70%\"\n|-\n!
