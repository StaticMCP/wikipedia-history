She repelled in 1804 the attack of a French privateer in a single-ship action. A collier ran Queen Charlotte down and sank her on 26 October 1826.\nCareer\nThe Old Shipping Company of Leith painted a white strip on the hulls of its vessels. This resulted in their vessels being known as \"White siders\". Vessels belonging to other companies followed different colour schemes.\nQueen Charlotte first appeared in ''Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1802. The Old Ship Company advertised that she had been armed by the government. The government had a program of arming merchantmen to enable them to protect themselves from French privateers.\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n!

The privateer fired a shot and called on Nisbet to surrender. Nisbett fired back and an engagement of more than an hour and a half ensued before the privateer sailed away empty-handed. In the fight, Nisbett and another seaman were wounded.\nThe carronades were mounted on the non-recoil principal. Nisbett reported that he would have liked more guns, but that Queen Charlottes armament was sufficient to have protected other trading vessels. The owners of the company gave Captain Nesbit a reward of £105.\n{| class=\" wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Master\n! Owner\n! Trade\n! Source & notes\n|-\n| 1805\n| Wm.

On 27 October the collier Silvia (or ), of Shields ran into her off Lowestoffe and cut her in half. Nicholson barely had time to get his crew and passengers aboard Silvia before Queen Charlotte sank without a trace.\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*"
