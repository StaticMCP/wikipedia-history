The nominations for the Golden Raspberry Awards were announced on January 30, 2006. The most nominated film of the year was Son of the Mask with eight nominations, followed by The Dukes of Hazzard with seven, Dirty Love with six, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo and Bewitched with five. The only picture to take home multiple penalties was Dirty Love, with four. The official press release announcing the 2005 winners proclaimed Dirty Love \"...a little stinker that no one but [Razzie voters] even seem to know existed.\"\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n!
