The Belle Glade site,  west of the city of Belle Glade, which gave its name to the culture, and Big Mound City,  south of Belle Glade, were partially excavated in 1933 and 1934 by a Civil Works Administration project supervised by Matthew Stirling. A report and analysis of the two sites was published by Gordon Willey in 1948. The best known site, Fort Center, was the subject of major excavations under the direction of William Sears during the 1970s. Other sites are known from test excavations and/or aerial surveys.\nThere is little evidence to support the idea that there was a separate and distinct Belle Glade culture. The sites other than Fort Center necessary to support the theory have never been excavated in the almost sixty years after Sears' work and conclusions at Fort Center in the 1960s. The literature does however reveal an attempt by Sears and others to distance the Calusa culture from any and all of the earthwork projects in the Lake Okeechobee Basin area. Based on the archaeology from 1895 to 1945, a view of a single south Florida culture region was established, based on a predominant type of plain ceramics in the region as early as 950 BC in Perico Island and up to 1700 at Marco Island. By 1949 both Gordon Willet and John Goggin authored complete taxonomies and chronologies for the Glades region. Goggin's dates which began earlier, seem to be closer to the actual dates for the various southern sequences.\nIn 1960, John Goggin and William Sturtevant argued that the Calusa and the lake culture worked together. The same decade, William Sears set out to disprove this commonly held view. In 1980 Sturtevant and Jerald Milanich changed the taxonomy adding two additional culture regions, Okeechobee and Caloosahatchee, making the Glade region smaller and more southern. Vague references to the monumental ceremonial mound complexes were used to support the change. No new archaeology and data resulted in the changed taxonomy. In 2000, state archaeologist Ryan Wheeler authored yet another south Florida taxonomy adding more regions and totally eliminating a Glades Region. Recently, University of Florida graduate student Nathan Lawres 2015, 2017, 2018), has undertaken research and dating of the Okeechobee region. Besides referencing the prehistoric inhabitants by name, the Mayaimi, Lawres sees \"alignments\" between the Calusa and the Mayaimi, thus bringing the archaeology full circle to the original view. Subsequent research will definitively prove or disprove the existence in fact of a separate Belle Glade culture beginning in 1000 BC and who engineered the monumental mound complexes independently.\nGeographic context\nThe cultural area is defined on the basis of a unique combination of mounds, earthworks and pottery, which have been found around Lake Okeechobee and as far north as Lake Kissimmee. The area has poor, sandy soils, low elevation with low relief (with some higher relief along the western and northern edges of the Kissimmee Valley), and many bodies of water and wetlands. The area consists of pine and palmetto flatwoods, wet prairies, hammocks of live oak and cabbage palm, and cypress swamps. The pine and palmetto flatlands of eastern Martin and Palm Beach counties, sometimes called the East Okeechobee area, and the Kissimmee Valley north of Lake Kissimmee to Lake Tohopekaliga may have also been part of the Belle Glade culture, based on the presence of high numbers of Belle Glade type pottery, and in the northern Kissimmee Valley, similar mounds and earthworks.\nSites\n* Belle Glade, Palm Beach County\n* Big Mound City, Palm Beach County\n* Big Gopher, Palm Beach County\n* Maple Mound, Hendry County\n* South Lake Mounds, Hendry County\n* Tony's Mound, Hendry County\n* Clewiston Mounds, Hendry County\n* Fort Center, Glades County\n* Ortona Mounds, Glades County\n* Mulberry Mound, Glades County\n* Circle Canal Site, Glades County\n* North Fisheating Creek Circle, Glades County\n* Lakeport Circle Ditch, Glades County\n* Pestle Earthwork, Glades County\n* Oxer Borrow, Glades County\n* Fort Kissimmee Earthworks, Okeechobee County\n* Fulford Earthworks, Okeechobee County\n* Clemens Square and Mound, Okeechobee County\n* Underhill Sawgrass Pond Site, Okeechobee County\n* Barley Barbar, Martin County\n}}\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* Reissued 2017 .\n*\n*\n*\nSources\n*}}\n* Reissued 2017 ."
