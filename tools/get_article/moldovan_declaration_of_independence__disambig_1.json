This founding act of the Republic of Moldova is celebrated as the National Day or Independence Day.\n2001 Moldovan stamp marking the 10th Anniversary of the declaration of independence\nThe original document that was approved and signed by 278 parliamentary deputies in 1991 was burned during the April 2009 Moldovan parliamentary election protests, but an identical document was restored in 2010.\nControversy\nThe Moldovan Declaration of Independence clearly and directly claims Moldovan sovereignty over the territory of Transnistria as \"a component part of the historical and ethnic territory of our people\". This caused controversy, since that region had declared independence from the Moldovan SSR in 1990 and formed the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (PMSSR); however, the PMSSR had not been recognised as a legitimate Soviet republic by either the Soviet Union or the Moldovan SSR.\nSee also\n* Independence Day (Republic of Moldova)\n* Dissolution of the Soviet Union\n* Disputed status of Transnistria\n* Transnistrian Declaration of Independence\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_the_Republic_of_Moldova Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova]"
