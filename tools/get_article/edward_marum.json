Edward studied at St. Patrick's College, Carlow, earning a BA and LLB from the University of London, he subsequently studied at the King's Inns and was called to the bar in 1848.\nHe stood unsuccessfully as a Home Rule candidate for the United Kingdom House of Commons at a by-election in Kilkenny city in 1875.   He was subsequently elected as Member of Parliament for County Kilkenny as a Parnellite Home Ruler in 1880, topping the poll, and held the seat until the constituency was divided for the 1885 general election. He was then elected for the new North Kilkenny constituency, and held that seat until his death.\nHe was a very eloquent speaker. He supported Horace Plunkett's efforts to establish agricultural co-operatives by addressing local meetings, but died of heart disease before he had been able to attend more than three or four.\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*Horace Plunkett (1904) Ireland in the New Century, London, John Murray\n*Brian Walker (ed.)
