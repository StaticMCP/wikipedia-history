      "text": "# Backup software\n\nBackup software are computer programs used to perform a backup; they create supplementary exact copies of files, databases or entire computers. These programs may later use the supplementary copies to restore the original contents in the event of data loss; hence, they are very useful to users.\nKey features\nThere are several features of backup software that make it more effective in backing up data.\nVolumes\nVoluming allows the ability to compress and split backup data into separate parts for storage on smaller, removable media such as CDs. It was often used because CDs were easy to transport off-site and inexpensive compared to hard drives or servers.\nHowever, the recent increase in hard drive capacity and decrease in drive cost has made voluming a far less popular solution. The introduction of small, portable, durable USB drives, and the increase in broadband capacity has provided easier and more secure methods of transporting backup data off-site.\nData compression\nSince hard drive space has cost, compressing the data will reduce the size allowing for less drive space to be used to save money.\nAccess to open files\nMany backup solutions offer a plug-in for access to exclusive, in use, and locked files.\nDifferential and incremental backups\nBackup solutions generally support differential backups and incremental backups in addition to full backups, so only material that is newer or changed compared to the backed up data is actually backed up. The effect of these is to increase significantly the speed of the backup process over slow networks while decreasing space requirements.\nSchedules\nBackup schedules are usually supported to reduce maintenance of the backup tool and increase the reliability of the backups.\nEncryption\nTo prevent data theft, some backup software offers cryptography features to protect the backup.\nTransaction mechanism\nTo prevent loss of previously backed up data during a backup, some backup software (e.g., Areca Backup, Argentum Backup) offer\nTransaction mechanism (with commit/rollback management) for all critical processes (such as backups or merges) to guarantee the backups' integrity.\nSee also\n* Backup\n* Cloud storage\n* List of backup software\n* Comparison of backup software\nReferences"
