BAFTA digital channels broadcast pre- and post-ceremony content; the ceremony was broadcast as deferred live, with an approximately one-hour delay, on BBC One in the United Kingdom and on various BritBox platforms internationally. In his introduction to the ceremony, Tennant performed \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\" by The Proclaimers before his monologue full of dad jokes—his scripted gags were of a similar tone throughout. Though the ceremony overran significantly, editing kept the broadcast ceremony to a \"brisk\" two hours.\nThe Best Children's & Family Film was awarded for the first time in 2025, having been announced in 2023 as the first new category since the introduction of Best Casting in 2020; during the ceremony, Deadline Hollywood suggested there was \"a little too much overlap\" between it and the Best Animated Film category. Other changes to the awards for 2025 include the introduction of new requirements for nomination to the Best Film and Outstanding British Film categories.\nThe nominees in 2025 made it the most genre-diverse ceremony, with horror and musicals well-represented among more traditional award ceremony genres. In terms of individual nominees, Anora filmmaker Sean Baker earned the second-most nominations for an individual at a single ceremony with five (Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Casting, and Best Editing) and filmmaker Rich Peppiatt became the most-nominated debut director at the BAFTAs with four personal nominations for Kneecap.\nDuring the technical awards, the ceremony sound cut out as Best Sound was presented, though this was fixed for broadcast. Multiple winners were noted for their lack of acceptance speech preparation and the endearingly rambling comments they made instead, including Nick Park (for Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl) and Jesse Eisenberg (for A Real Pain). Ahead of the acting and other major awards being announced, Take That performed their song \"Greatest Day\", which featured prominently in nominee Anora. Two awards later, the first of two montages of other awards to not receive as-live broadcasts was shown; this included Emilia Pérez winning Best Film Not in the English Language, the clip notably cutting out director Jacques Audiard paying tribute to controversial star Karla Sofía Gascón in his speech. Winners considered surprising were David Jonsson for the EE Rising Star Award and Mikey Madison winning Best Actress in a Leading Role, while A Complete Unknown failing to win any of its six nominations was considered a surprising snub. Favourites in the supporting performance categories, Zoe Saldaña (for Emilia Pérez) and Kieran Culkin (for A Real Pain) won their categories, which was said to make them all but guaranteed to win at the 97th Academy Awards.\nThere were relatively few political comments made at the ceremony, with Tennant making jokes about Donald Trump – though some, including comparing Trump to the character Beetlejuice, as well as jokes about Conclave, were cut from the broadcast; Peppiatt saying that everyone \"should have their language respected, their culture respected and their homeland respected\"; and Edward Berger accepting Outstanding British Film for Conclave by vaguely referring to elections in Germany and describing the time as \"a crisis of democracy\". When presenting Best Film, Mark Hamill referred to \"troubling times\" before deliberately not naming Trump. In reference to which comments were cut, the BBC stated editing decisions were \"made due to time constraints\".\nIn Memoriam\nThe In Memoriam was accompanied by Jeff Goldblum performing \"As Time Goes By\" on piano and paid tribute to the following:\n* Alain Delon – actor, producer\n* Anouk Aimée – actress\n* Samantha Davis – actress\n* Pat Heywood – actress\n* John Amos – actor\n* Louis Gossett Jr. – actor\n* Mitzi Gaynor – actress, dancer, singer\n* Reuben Barnes – projectionist, technical manager\n* Phyllis Dalton – costume designer\n* James Earl Jones – actor\n* Shelley Duvall – actress\n* Jim Abrahams – director, writer\n* Roger Corman – director, producer, actor\n* Jenne Casarotto – agent\n* Lynda Obst – producer\n* Teri Garr – actress\n* Donald Sutherland – actor\n* James Hambidge – art director, production designer\n* Ray Chan – art director, production designer\n* Robert Towne – writer\n* Jon Landau – producer\n* Kris Kristofferson – actor, musician\n* Gena Rowlands – actress\n* Dame Joan Plowright – actress\n* Lisa Westcott – make up & hair designer\n* Loulia Sheppard – hair designer\n* Paul Engelen – make up designer\n* Robert Watts – producer, production manager\n* Adam Somner – producer, assistant director\n* Norman Spencer – producer, production manager\n* David Korda – producer, financier\n* Dick Pope – cinematographer\n* Roger Pratt – cinematographer\n* David Lynch – director\n* Dame Maggie Smith – actress\nDeadline Hollywood opined that there \"were no egregious omissions\" from the segment.\nStatistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Films that received multiple nominations\n! style=\"background:;\"| Nominations\n! style=\"background:;\"| Film\n|-\n| 12\n| Conclave\n|-\n| 11\n| Emilia Pérez\n|-\n| 9\n| The Brutalist\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 7\n| Anora\n|-\n| Dune: Part Two\n|-\n| Wicked\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 6\n| A Complete Unknown\n|-\n| Kneecap\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 5\n| Nosferatu\n|-\n| The Substance\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\"| 3\n| The Apprentice\n|-\n| Blitz\n|-\n| Gladiator II\n|-\n| Sing Sing\n|-\n| Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\n|-\n| The Wild Robot\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 2\n| Flow\n|-\n| Hard Truths\n|-\n| The Outrun\n|-\n| A Real Pain\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+\n! style=\"background:;\"| Awards\n! style=\"background:;\"| Film\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 4\n| The Brutalist\n|-\n| Conclave\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\"| 2\n| Anora\n|-\n| Dune: Part Two\n|-\n| Emilia Pérez\n|-\n| A Real Pain\n|-\n| Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\n|-\n| Wicked\n|}\nSee also\n* Film award ceremonies in 2025\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
