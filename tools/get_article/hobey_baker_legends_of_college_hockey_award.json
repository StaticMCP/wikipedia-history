While the Hobey Baker Award is given to the individual selected as the outstanding NCAA men's ice hockey player of the current year, the \"Legends of College Hockey Award\"  honors a player, coach, or administrator who has made outstanding historic contributions to the sport.\nAward winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Year !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Winner !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Position !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| School !! bgcolor=\"#e5e5e5\"| Ref\n|-\n| 1981 || John \"Snooks\" Kelly || Coach || Boston College 1933–1942, 1946–1972 ||\n|-\n| 1982 || Vic Heyliger || Player, coach || Michigan 1934–1937 (player)Michigan 1944–1957;
