The serious resistance of the companies led the commander of the Moravian Division to introduce the 14th Serbian Infantry Regiment into battle, and later against the village of Turokovtsi was included the 2nd Company of the 2nd Serbian Infantry Regiment.\nThe Serbs, with considerable numerical superiority, resumed the offensive. The 2nd and 4th companies of the 3rd Bdina Regiment opposed the pressure on the northern flank. However, the Serbs reached the trenches and went into hand-to-hand combat. The officers personally lead their soldiers. Platoon commander Georgi Tonev, gave the command \"Forward!\", \"Hurray!\", And the whole platoon followed the example of their commander. This resulted in massive damage was inflicted on the Serbian front lines and the offensive was stopped.\nThe Moravian Division retreated to the peak of Golemi Rui, and its artillery occupied firing positions in the area of the villages of Zabel and Turokovtsi.\nIn the evening at 11 pm, the commander of the Tran detachment, Nikola Genev, received an order, due to the retreat of the Serbian positions near Vrabcha and the detachment also began to retreat to the Trun-Breznik road as Milan I offered to begin peace negotiations.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n* Христов, Х. и др., Сръбско-българската война 1885.
