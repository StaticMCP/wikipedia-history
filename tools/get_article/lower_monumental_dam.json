Located on the lower Snake River in southeast  Washington, it bridges Franklin and Walla Walla counties; it&nbsp;is  south of Kahlotus and  north of Walla Walla.\nLower Monumental Dam with the lock in the center of the river (far side in photo), the power generation on the northwest side of the river, and spillway in the middle of the dam, between the powerhouse and the lock.\nConstruction began in June 1961, and the main structure and three generators were completed  in 1969, with an additional three generators finished in 1981. Generating capacity is 810 megawatts, with an overload capacity of 932 MW. The spillway has eight gates and is  in length.\nBuilt and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lower Monumental Dam is part of the Columbia River Basin system of dams.\nBehind the dam, Lake Herbert G. West is the reservoir; it extends  east to the base of Little Goose Dam. Lake Sacajawea, formed from Ice Harbor Dam, runs   southwest, downstream from the base of the dam.\n;Navigation lock\n* Single-lift\n* Width:\n* Length:\nSee also\n*List of dams in the Columbia River watershed\n*Lower Granite Dam\n*Little Goose Dam\n*Ice Harbor Dam\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051126051648/http://www.nww.usace.army.mil/dpn/dpn_project.asp?project_id=92 Lower Monumental Lock & Dam @ US Army Corps of Engineers]"
