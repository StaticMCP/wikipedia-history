It stars Saskia Axten, Vanessa Redgrave, Sophie Vavasseur, Steven Berkoff, Elijah Rowen, Slavoj Žižek and Carol Cleveland.\nPremise\nThe film follows Alice (Saskia Axten) a young student who stumbles into a bizarre version of London after her night with a newfound lover, Rabbit (Elijah Rowen) appears to suddenly have never happened. The night in question just happens to be the evening of the UK's 2016 referendum on EU membership.\nThe film itself periodically shifts to different layers of narrative, from the Alice in Wonderland adapting narrative of Alice's search for Rabbit in an upside-down version of London, to a satirical \"real world\" scenario, showing philosophers and the \"director\" (played by director Adam Donen) reacting to the film they are planning.\nFestival appearances\nThe film had its World Premiere on the 25th of November at the 2021 PÖFF Film Festival, Tallinn, Estonia as part of the First Features strand. It subsequently was featured in the 2022 International Fuse Festival lineup. Further in 2022, after a UK premiere at London Rocks Festival, the film featured at Liverpool Film Festival, and North East International Film Festival in October and November respectively. In November 2022, it was screened at South Africa Independent film Festival. In March 2023, it was screened at the Idyllwild International Festival Of Cinema in California.\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Award/Film Festival\n!Date of Ceremony\n!Category\n!Recipients\n!Result\n!References\n|-\n|POFF film Festival Estonia\n|2021\n|First Feature\n|Adam Donen\n|Nominated\n|\n|-\n|North East international Film Festival\n|2022\n|Best Director Feature film\n|Adam Donen\n|Won\n|\n|-\n|London Rocks Film Festival\n|2022\n|Best Performer\n|Saskia Axten\n|Won\n|\n|-\n|South African Independent Film Festival\n|2022\n|Best feature\n|Adam Donen\n|Won\n|\n|-\n|Idyllwild International Festival Of Cinema\n|2023\n|Best Feature film, Best International film,\nBest Director, Best Screenwriter, Best Cinematography, Best Actress, Best Ensemble Cast\n|Adam Donen, Jason Elis, Saskia Axten, Steven Berkoff, Carol Cleveland, Alan Ford, Vanessa Redgrave, Elijah Rowen, Joerg Stadler, Sophie Vavasseur\n|Nominated\n|\n|}\nMajor cast\n* Saskia Axten as Alice\n* Vanessa Redgrave as the Narrator\n* Adam Donen as \"Adam\"\n* Steven Berkoff as \"The Executive Producer\"\n* Slavoj Zizek as himself\n* Elijah Rowen as Rabbit\n* John Locke as the Old Banker\n* Adrian McLoughlin as PC Dum/Justice Dum\n* Lewis Allcock as PC Dee/Lord Dee\n* Sophie Vavasseur as Emma\n* Joerg Stadler as the Caterpillar\n* Alan Ford as the Chairman\n* Julian M.
