Two months before the awards gala, Cates selected actor and comedian Billy Crystal to host the show for the second consecutive year. Crystal made light of the honor by saying, \"It's a great honor, and I hope to bring the show in under nine hours.\"\nAs with last year's theme of \"Around the World in 3 1/2 Hours,\" Cates centered the show around a theme. He christened the ceremony with the theme \"100 Years of Film\" in celebration of the centennial of the development of both the kinetoscope by Thomas Edison and celluloid film by Eastman Kodak. In tandem with the theme, the show featured an ambitious opening segment. Actor Michael Caine introduced the segment live via satellite from the Salon Indien du Grand Café in Paris, where the short film ''L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat'' made its debut in 1895. After a brief clip of the film, the show cut back to the Shrine Auditorium stage, where actress Jasmine Guy and other dancers performed while a montage of film clips was projected in the background. Filmmaker Chuck Workman filmed a vignette featuring actors such as Sally Field, Andy García, and Anjelica Huston discussing the first movie the actors watched.\nSeveral other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director for the ceremony. Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed a dance number showcasing the Best Original Score nominees. Despite losing eight members of her band in a plane crash, a visibly emotional Reba McEntire performed the Best Original Song nominee \"I'm Checkin' Out\" from the film Postcards from the Edge. At the beginning of the ceremony, wrangler Lisa Brown escorted host Crystal, and Beechnut, a horse that was prominently featured in the upcoming film City Slickers.\nThis ceremony was the last year in which there were no official nominees for Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. Back to the Future Part III, Dick Tracy, Ghost and Total Recall advanced to a second stage of voting, but only Total Recall received the requisite average, and it was given a special achievement Oscar.\nBox office performance of nominees\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on February 12, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees at the US box office was $458.2 million with an average of $41 million per film. Ghost was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees, with $213.5 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Dances With Wolves ($104.3 million), The Godfather Part III ($62.5 million), Goodfellas ($41 million), and finally Awakenings ($36.7 million).\nOf the top 50 highest-grossing films released in 1990, 51 nominations went to 12 films on the list. Only Ghost (2nd), Pretty Woman (3rd), Dances With Wolves (8th), Dick Tracy (9th), The Godfather Part III (17th), Goodfellas (30th), and Awakenings (34th) were nominated for Best Picture, directing, acting, or screenwriting. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were Home Alone (1st), The Hunt for Red October (5th), Total Recall (6th), Days of Thunder (12th), and Edward Scissorhands (22nd).\nCritical reviews\nThe show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Rick DuBrow of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"It was a long day's journey into night for Oscar, one of the most effective sleeping pills of the year.\" He also added that while host Crystal started out strong, his jokes fell flat as the night progressed. The Washington Post television critic Tom Shales noted that Crystal, \"followed many gags by instantly rating the reaction of the audience, as if it were up to them to please him instead of the other way around.\" In addition, he commented, \"The Oscars seemed more of a fizzle than usual this year.\" Columnist Dan Craft of The Pantagraph remarked, \"The Oscar show has become innocuously hip and yuppified. Kitsch and nostalgia have given way to efficiency and upward mobility. Everyone is tiresomely well-behaved and, worse, well-dressed.\" He also commented that host Crystal's insider showbiz jokes fell flat and were confusing to television audiences.\nOther media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Columnist Harold Schindler of The Salt Lake Tribune wrote, \"Billy Crystal kept things moving Monday night in such a manner that the extra quarter-hour was scarcely noticeable.\" He also said of the telecast's theme of film history, \"The Academy used its film library to excellent advantage.\" Film critic Leonard Maltin remarked, \"Emotions ran high and they gave us all a chance to feel vicariously what it might be like to win this kind of award...good guys finishing first and the part of Hollywood we like best, a happy ending.\" Orlando Sentinel film critic Jay Boyar complimented Crystal for invigorating the gala, noting that his \"clever remarks at the academy's 63rd annual awards presentation struck an entertaining balance between inside-Hollywood quips and general-audience jests.\"\nRatings and reception\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 42.7 million people over its length, which was a 6% increase from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 76 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony, with 28.4% of households watching over a 48 share. It was the most watched Oscars telecast since the 56th ceremony held in 1984.\nIn July 1991, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations at the 43rd Primetime Emmys. The following month, the ceremony won three of those nominations for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Program (Gil Cates), Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program (Billy Crystal), and Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program (Hal Kanter, Buz Kohan, Billy Crystal, David Steinberg, Bruce Vilanch, and Robert Wuhl).\nSee also\n* 11th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 33rd Grammy Awards\n* 43rd Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 44th British Academy Film Awards\n* 45th Tony Awards\n* 48th Golden Globe Awards\n* List of submissions to the 63rd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\nOfficial websites\n* [http://www.oscar.com/ Academy Awards Official website]\n* [http://www.oscars.org/ The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Official website]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/oscars Oscar's Channel]  at YouTube (run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences)\nAnalysis\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/aa90.html 1990 Academy Awards Winners and History]  Filmsite\n* [https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/1991 Academy Awards, USA: 1991]  Internet Movie Database\nOther resources\n*"
