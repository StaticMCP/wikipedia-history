She is known for her lead role as Cinta in the Indonesian 2001 film Ada Apa Dengan Cinta?\nEarly life and education\nSastro was born on 16 March 1982 in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Ariawan Sastrowardoyo (1955–1995), an artist, and Dewi Parwati Sastrowardoyo (née Setyorini), a university lecturer. Sastro was born as a Christian and raised as a Roman Catholic but later converted to Islam. Her paternal grandfather, Dr. Sumarsono Sastrowardoyo (1922–2008), was a physician, surgeon, and book author. Her uncle, Dr. Aswin Wisaksono Sastrowardoyo (b. 1957), is a musician turned physician. She is also the grandniece of both Sunario (1902–1997), Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1953 to 1956; Dra. Sukanti Suryochondro (1915–2004), a former instructor in women's studies at the University of Indonesia; and Subagio Sastrowardoyo (1924–1995), a noted poet and literary critic. Her paternal great-grandfather, Sutejo Sastrowardoyo (1878–1967), traced the family's ancestry back to the 15th century Javanese. Sastro's family name is derived from sastra (Sanskrit, \"writings\") and wardaya (\"heart\", hence both: \"writings of the heart\").\nShe attended junior high school at the SMP Vincentius Otista Jakarta and high school at the SMA Tarakanita 1. Then, she continued her higher studies at the University of Indonesia where she studied law briefly before moving to the Faculty of Literature, where she obtained her bachelor's degree in philosophy in July 2007. She did her post-graduate degree at the School of Economics at the same institution, where she studied Finance Management as her major and earned a Master's in Management degree. She graduated cum laude in August 2014.\nCareer\nSastro began her modelling career in 1996 as the cover girl of Gadis, a popular teen magazine in Indonesia after she won the teen beauty pageant Gadis Sampul at the age of 14. She went on to secure a main role in Pasir Berbisik as Daya, which was a critical success and won her many awards, including the Best Actress award in the Deauville Asian Film Festival. She rose to prominence with her starring role as Cinta in the cult classic romance 2002 movie Ada Apa dengan Cinta?, which was a box office hit not only in Indonesia, but also in Malaysia a year later in January 2003. From the role, she won the Citra Award for Best Actress. Since then, she has established herself as one of Indonesia's most bankable actresses, starring in films such as Banyu Biru, Ungu Violet, and Belahan Jiwa, as well as international films such as the Malaysian production Puteri Gunung Ledang.\nOther television appearances include playing Raya in Dunia Tanpa Koma and a brief stint as the host of the television game show Kuis Super Milyarder 3 Milyar which is the spin-off second season in Indonesian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The show aired on ANTV. Apart from her acting career, she has been the face model of L'Oréal Paris Indonesia since 2010.\nSastro is the goodwill ambassador for the MTV EXIT youth campaign, a multimedia initiative produced by MTV EXIT Foundation to raise awareness and increase prevention of human trafficking and modern slavery through live events, video content, and youth engagement. She hosted a special programme for the campaign in 2012 titled Enslaved, produced for thirteen Asian countries.\nIn 2016, she reprised her role as the titular character in Ada Apa Dengan Cinta? 2, the sequel to Ada Apa dengan Cinta? alongside actor Nicholas Saputra.\nIn 2016, Sastro starred as Indonesia's national heroine in the biographical drama movie Kartini. In 2018, Dian starred in Aruna dan Lidahnya (Aruna and Her Palate), a film based on the Laksmi Pamuntjak written book novel of the same name.\nIn 2020, she starred in the comedy film Crazy Awesome Teachers and it released directly on Netflix.\nIn 2023, Sastro starred in Kamila Andini and Ifa Isfansyah's directed Netflix series Cigarette Girl as Jeng Yah co-starring with Ario Bayu, Putri Marino, Sha Ine Febriyanti, Rukman Rosadi and Tutie Kirana.\nPersonal life\nSastro married businessman Maulana Indraguna Sutowo, the son of business tycoon Adiguna Sutowo, on 18 May 2010. The couple have two children: Shailendra Naryama Sastraguna Sutowo (born 17 July 2011) and Ishana Ariandra Nariratana Sutowo (born 7 June 2013).\nFilmography\nFilms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n!
