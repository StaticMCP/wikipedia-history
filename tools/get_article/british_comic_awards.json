Winners were selected by a judging committee; the awards were given out on an annual basis from 2012 to 2016 for comics made by United Kingdom creators published from September of the previous year until September of the current year. Award presentations were held at the Leeds Thought Bubble Festival, in the fall of the year.\nThe British Comic Award took the place of the National Comics Awards (1997–2003) and the Eagle Awards, both of which had petered out by the early 2010s.\nOverview\nThe British Comic Awards were given out in five categories:\n* Best Book — \"for long-form comics and collections\"\n* Best Comic — \"for short-form, self-contained stories\"\n* Young People's Comic Award — \"for short and long-form comics suitable for children voted for by young people\"\n* Emerging Talent — \"to recognize irrepressible talent and potential in a young or new creator\"\n* Hall of Fame — \"to commemorate the career and legacy of an influential figure from Britain's rich comic history\"\nAward recipients — except the Hall of Fame winner — were selected from a list of five nominees in each category. Before the nominees were whittled down to five, the BCA committee would release a longlist of eligible books, comics, and people. Nominations were accepted from the general public via a form on the BCA website.\nThe BCA committee, which changed slightly each year, was made up of from seven to nine British individuals from academia and the arts. Committee members at various times included Lisa Wood, Maura McHugh, Jamillah Knowles, and Andy Oliver. The BCA committee chose that year's Hall of Fame recipient.\nThe judging committee changed every year; it generally had five to seven members. Judges at various times included Eddie Argos, Kate Beaton, Hunt Emerson, John Freeman, and Stephen L. Holland of the Nottingham-based comics retailer Page 45.\nThe Young People's Comic Award was not selected by the BCA judges; it was chosen by children from a selection of British schools and libraries.\nHistory\nThe Awards were founded in 2012 by Adam Cadwell. There were some complaints after the first set of nominations was announced that the Awards seemed to favor alternative and independent titles rather than \"mainstream\" British comics like 2000 AD, The Beano, and The Dandy.\nFor the 2015 awards, the BCA opened a call for nominations from the general public, which could be submitted through its website; at that point, the Awards also partnered with the Nottingham-based comics retailer Page 45. The 2015 awards were managed by BCA Founder Adam Cadwell.\nThe 2016 awards were co-sponsored by the Thought Bubble Festival and the Leeds Library & Information Service; they were limited to the Young People's Comic Award only. The nominated titles were sent to over a dozen schools across Leeds and throughout the country for young readers to read and judge. Their winning title was revealed at a special ceremony on 4 November in Leeds as part of the 10th anniversary of Thought Bubble; over 100 of the young judges were in attendance.\nFollowing the 2016 awards, it was announced that the British Comic Awards were \"on hiatus\" and would return, but in the years since they have disappeared.\nAwards\n; Winners listed by year; for some categories, other nominees are listed after the winner.\nBest Book\n* 2012: Nelson, edited by Rob Davis and Woodrow Phoenix\n** Don Quixote: Volume 1 by Rob Davis\n** Goliath by Tom Gauld\n** Hilda and the Midnight Giant by Luke Pearson\n** Science Tales by Darryl Cunningham\n* 2013: The Nao of Brown by Glyn Dillon\n** The Gigantic Beard That Was Evil by Stephen Collins\n** Judge Dredd: Trifecta by Al Ewing, Rob Williams, Simon Spurrier, Henry Flint, D’Israeli, Carl Critchlow, and Simon Coleby\n** The Man Who Laughs by David Hine and Mark Stafford.
