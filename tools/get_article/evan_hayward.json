      "text": "# Evan Hayward\n\nEvan Hayward (2 April 1876 – 30 January 1958) was a Liberal Party politician in England.\nBackground and education\nHayward was born in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire and attended Katherine Lady Berkeley's Grammar School where he studied politics and law.\nPolitical career\nHayward was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for South East Durham at the January 1910 general election, and held the seat until the constituency was abolished at the 1918 general election. He then stood for the new Seaham constituency in County Durham, as a Liberal candidate; he had been issued with the \"coalition coupon\", but repudiated it. Nonetheless, the Conservative Party did not field a candidate in Seaham, and Hayward won the seat with a comfortable 17% majority over his Labour Party opponent. However, at the 1922 general election, the Conservatives did field a candidate. Hayward was pushed into a poor third place with only 15.5% of the votes, and Labour's Sidney Webb took the seat with nearly 60% of the votes.\nAfter his defeat, Hayward did not stand for Parliament again.\nElectoral record\n.\n}}\nPersonal life\nHayward married Elizabeth Marion Bergfeldt at Kensington Chapel on 6 December 1913.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
