      "text": "# Crusade (Young novel)\n\nCrusade is a novel by Robyn Young set during the end of the ninth and final crusade. It was first published by Dutton in 2007.\nPlot summary\nCrusade, like Brethren before it, follows Will Campbell, a Templar involved in a secret order known as the Anima Templi, as he tries to secure peace in the Holy Land with the help of Kalawun, a high-ranking officer in the Mamluk court ruled by Sultan Baybars. Both of these men face plots from within their own organisations to throw the Holy Land into war: in Acre, Will must stop a cabal of merchants seeking to start a war by stealing the Muslim relic known as the Black Stone; while in Egypt, Baybars' son Baraka Khan and soothsayer Khadir al-Mihrani are plotting to overthrow Baybars and redouble the attack on the last remaining Franks in the Holy Land. Meanwhile, Will's childhood friend, Garin de Lyons, is now in the employ of King Edward I and has returned to Acre to extort money from the Anima Templi and to pursue his own, more selfish ends; and Will faces a threat from Baybars as the sultan gets nearer and nearer to discovering that it was Will who, many years before, ordered an assassination attempt which had failed but had taken the life of Baybars' closest friend.\nHistorical Figures\nThe following characters in the book were real historical figures:\n*Al-Ashraf Khalil: Son of Qalawun, sultan of Egypt and Syria from 1290 to 1293.

In a positive review for on-line review site My Shelf, John Washburn stated that Young was \"careful to maintain historical accuracy while at the same time bringing her characters to life in a brilliant manner.\". He claimed to be \"mesmerized by the brutal emotion found in this book, much in the same way I was with the first book.\" and ended the review with \"I am more than pleased, and I eagerly anticipate the third installment.\". These sentiments were mirrored by A. Jurek, writing for Curled Up'', who stated that \"the plot moves swiftly despite complexities and complications exploding on each page.\"; praising Young's \"use of dramatic irony\" and, of the characters, stated that \"they are complex, human, and deeply flawed, driven as they are by their flaws to commit unspeakable betrayals and barbarities for the sake of ideals, hoping to achieve some good with their questionable acts.\". In a mostly positive review for Reviewing the Evidence, Christine Zibas stated that \"For those who are particularly interested in this historical time frame, Crusade is sure to pique their interest; for the more general reader, it may require a bit more slogging through the first part of the story to get truly involved in the book's characters and action.\".\nAndre Delicata, writing for Malta's The Times was a little more critical of the novel, stating that the novel's problem is that \"there is simply too much setting with meticulous descriptions where everything is dealt with in equal depth, resulting in a text with several climaxes and anti-climaxes but no real focus.\", and that without this \"modulation of detail\" the reader is simply left with an \"information overload\". Delicata also comments that \"if the spirit of an age is what you're after, then look no further than Crusade, which captures it voluminously and thoroughly satisfies those with a passion of detail verging on the obsessive.\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
