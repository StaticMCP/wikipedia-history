The album was re-issued in 1998 with an expanded and rearranged track listing by Re-Constriction Records.\nReception\nScott Hefflon of Lollipop Magazine gave Choking on Lilies a positive review, saying \"a nice break from all the boring electro\" and \"a band like this that carries off the aloof aggression of electro, rocking out, and sweet, ethereal vocals is quite a find.\" Despite criticizing the overabundance of remixes, Sonic Boom also gave the album a positive write-up, saying that \"Katie had a very strong vocal range that could be very lush on slower tracks like 'Everything and Nothing' or more aggressive such as on 'Only Human'. Ian's guitar work was always complimentary, never dominating or hiding in the final mixdown. These elements combined with Jonathan's obvious electronic wizardry was bordering on perfection.\"\nTrack listing\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0em 1em 1em 0pt\"\n!Year\n!Publication\n!Country\n!Accolade\n!Rank\n!class=unsortable|\n|-\n|align=center|1998    ||CMJ New Music Monthly    ||United States\n| \"Dance\"    ||align=center|12    ||\n|-class=\"sortbottom\"\n|colspan=6 style=font-size:8pt; align=center|\"*\" denotes an unordered list.\n|}\nPersonnel\nAdapted from the Choking on Lilies liner notes.\nHexedene\n* Katie Helsby&nbsp;– lead vocals\n* Ian Palmer&nbsp;– guitar\n* Jonathan Sharp&nbsp;– programming, guitar, photography\nProduction and design\n* Séba Dolimont&nbsp;– production and engineering (11)\n* Loretta Sterling&nbsp;– production, photography\n* Stuart Turnbull&nbsp;– photography\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
