In the 1950s, local Italian-Australian Efim Zola began a canal development project which involved raising unused farmland and renamed the area Isle of Capri after Capri island in Italy. Future Gold Coast Mayor Bruce Small took over the project in 1958 and completed unfinished developments.\nAs of the early 2000s, the Isle of Capri is considered an affluent neighbourhood of the Gold Coast.\nThe original 1960 two lane bridge between the Isle of Capri and Surfers Paradise was replaced by a four lane bridge in 2022.\nReferences"
