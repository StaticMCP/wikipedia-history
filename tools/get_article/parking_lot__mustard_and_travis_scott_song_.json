It was released through 10 Summers and BMG Rights Management as the lead single from Mustard's fourth studio album, Faith of a Mustard Seed, on June 21, 2024. The song was produced by Mustard himself, Nic Nac, Keanu Beats, and Farmer, all of whom wrote it with Travis Scott and Quintin Gulledge.\nOn June 17, 2024, Mustard announced the title of the song, along with its cover art and release date. The next day, he announced that Travis Scott would be the other co-lead artist of the song and shared a video of them recording it in a studio, in which a snippet of the chorus plays in the background.\nLyrics and composition\nMustard's production is described as \"soulful\" while it's noted that the song is about how Travis enjoys \"a woman’s company in a parking lot during the summer\". The track is described as \"Mustard's hard-hitting grooves\" synced with \"Scott's psych-trap sound\".\nCritical reception\nHotNewHipHops Danilo Castro stated that Travis' \"trademark woozy delivery fits perfectly over the repetitive beat\" and that the track \"adopts some of Scott's production flourishes on the back end, which serves as a nice change-up\".\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"Parking Lot\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia Hip Hop/R&B (ARIA)\n| 19\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Greece International (IFPI)\n| 34\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2024 year-end chart performance for \"Parking Lot\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2024)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard)\n| 67\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Rhythmic (Billboard)\n| 36\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
