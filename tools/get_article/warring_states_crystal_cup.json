It has a round opening and is transparent. The 'glass' is not glass, but is made from a natural high-quality crystal. The artifact is on the list of Chinese cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad, a list of objects that can never leave Chinese soil.\nDiscovery\nIn 1990, the cup was unearthed in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province during an archaeological dig. Specifically, it was found in Banshan town (), Shitang village () in a Warring states period mausoleum. It was found underground about one&nbsp;metre deep. Du Zhengxian () insisted on the archaeological digging even when other archaeologists had already labeled that area of the village a worthless wasteland. After two months of digging, he found the cup, along with other treasures. It became the biggest find of the Warring states tombs.\nSee also\n* Hardstone_carving#Asia_and_the_Islamic_world\n* Chinese jade\n* Ancient Chinese glass\nReferences"
