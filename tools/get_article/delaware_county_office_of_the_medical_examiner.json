In 1979, the county updated the medicolegal death investigation system to a modernized Medical Examiner system in response to public demand, and facilitated by the home rule charter. The Administrative Headquarters of the office is located within the Fair Acres Complex in Lima, with a connected morgue building.\nOrganization\nThe Office of the Medical Examiner is staffed by five Board Certified Forensic Pathologists, a Chief Investigator, several Medicolegal Investigators, an autopsy technician, an office manager, and an office administrator.  The Office is currently headed by Dr. Frederic Hellman, Chief Medical Examiner and Dr. Bennett Preston, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Forensic Pathology Division\n!Forensic Investigation Division\n!Administrative Division\n|-\n|Chief Medical Examiner\n|Chief Medicolegal Investigator\n|Office Administrator\n|-\n|Deputy Chief Medical Examiner\n|Medicolegal Investigator\n|Office Manager\n|-\n|Associate Medical Examiner\n|\n|\n|-\n|Autopsy Technician\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
