These tables went beyond the tables of Henry Briggs, Adriaan Vlacq, and Gaspard de Prony.\nPersonal life\nSang was born in Kirkcaldy on 30 January 1805, the son of Jean Nicol and Edward Sang, Provost of Kirkcaldy. He attended the Subscription School in Kirkcaldy and from there went on to study at the University of Edinburgh.\nIn the 1830s he is listed as a teacher of mathematics living at 32 St Andrew Square in Edinburgh.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in May 1836. In 1884 he was awarded their Makdougall-Brisbane Prize. He served as their Vice President 1883 to 1885.\nIn 1841 he took the role of Professor of Mechanical Science at Manchester New College. In 1854 he briefly served as Professor of Mechanical Science in Constantinople. He returned to Edinburgh in 1854 to again teach mathematics.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of the Arts in 1828, and was its president from 1857 to 1858.\nIn 1884 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.\nSang died at his home, 31 Mayfield Road, Edinburgh Newington on 23 December 1890.\nGrave\nHe is buried with his wife and children in Newington Cemetery, Edinburgh. The grave can be found when entering from Dalkeith Road, near the cemetery lodge, and then going straight for about 50 meters until meeting a circular plot of graves. Sang's grave is slightly towards the left, on the second circle from the outside. The inscription on the tombplate is\nSacred to the memoryof Edward Sang, LL.D., F.R.S.E., F.R.S.S.A., corres. memb. royal academy, Turin,honor. memb.

In 1851, he invented a planimeter which he called \"platometer.\"\nMathematical work\nDemonstrating the rotation of the Earth\nIn 1836, Sang explained how a spinning top could be used to demonstrate the rotation of the Earth, anticipating Foucault's pendulum. (see Johann G. Hagen: La rotation de la terre, ses preuves mécaniques anciennes et nouvelles, 1911)\nTrigonometric and logarithmic tables\nSang worked for many years on trigonometric and logarithmic tables. Summaries of his tables were published by Alex Craik.\nSang's 1871 table and his project for a 9-place million table were (re)constructed as part of the [http://locomat.loria.fr LOCOMAT] project.\nVarious other works\n* Edward Sang's logarithmic method for constructing a skew arch.\nPublications\nThe following list is certainly still incomplete. Some page ranges may be slightly incorrect. Note that Pebble's list of publications contains more items, but some of them seem spurious, and others are not actual publications. Nevertheless, the present list is very likely incomplete.\nCommunications are marked with \"(communication)\" and are reviews or summaries of communicated papers.
