Hilary struggles with bipolar disorder, lives alone, has been prescribed lithium by her GP, and is having extramarital sex with her boss Donald Ellis.\nNew employee Stephen, who is Black British and lives with his mother Delia, a nurse, starts his new job at the cinema. Hilary is taken with the handsome and charming Stephen, and the two bond when she shows him the cinema's beautiful but disused upper floor. Hilary becomes jealous when Stephen begins hanging out with Janine, a younger employee. While watching New Year's Eve fireworks from the cinema roof, Hilary impulsively kisses Stephen. The two of them begin a sexual relationship. Hilary cuts off Donald and, happy about the new relationship, stops taking her medication.\nHilary sees Stephen being harassed by a group of skinheads on the street and later deal with a racist customer and Stephen confides in her about the racism he faces. Hilary and Stephen go to the beach, where Stephen tells her about his first love, Ruby, who works at the same hospital as his mother. When Stephen asks about her past, she goes on an agitated rant about men and angrily destroys a sand castle they had been building. Neil, a colleague, discovers their relationship and warns Stephen of Hilary's mental health. He tells Hilary it would be best if they end their sexual affair. Donald informs the workers that the cinema has been chosen for the regional premiere of Chariots of Fire. At the premiere, a manic Hilary gets on stage and delivers an agitated speech before informing Donald's wife about their affair. Hilary's mental health deteriorates. While Stephen is at her flat checking on her, mental-health authorities break down her door and take her to be re-institutionalised.\nWeeks later, back at the theatre, Donald has been replaced and Stephen begins training with Norman, the cinema's projectionist. He runs into Ruby at the cinema, and they start dating again. Hilary is released from the hospital and returns to work. Stephen advises her to see a movie at the cinema, something she has never done. During her welcome-back party, a skinhead crowd marches past the theatre. When they see Stephen, they break in and assault him. Hilary accompanies him to the hospital, where she meets Stephen's mother. As Stephen recovers, Hilary initially stays away. Norman confides in her that he has a son he has not seen in many years because he abandoned his family and advises her not to run away. She visits Stephen in the hospital. His mother tells Hilary that she makes Stephen happy. An overjoyed Hilary rushes back to the theatre and has requests Norman to play any movie for her; Norman picks Being There.\nStephen returns to the cinema but informs Hilary that, following her advice, he has decided to return to college and will be leaving town. Stephen remembers his times with Hilary at a going-away dinner with Ruby and his mother. The two meet in a park, where Hilary gives him a book and finally bids him goodbye. As Stephen leaves on the train, he reads from the book High Windows by Philip Larkin.\nCast\nProduction\nCinema signage was changed to \"Empire Cinema\" during production of the film.]]\nIt was announced in April 2021 that Sam Mendes had set his next film, which he would write and direct himself at Searchlight Pictures. Olivia Colman was in talks to star and Roger Deakins was announced as cinematographer. Colman was confirmed in July, with Micheal Ward also joining the cast. In December, Colin Firth, Toby Jones, Crystal Clarke and Tanya Moodie were added to the cast. Tom Brooke and Hannah Onslow were confirmed to star in late February. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the film's score.\nFilming began on 7 February 2022 at Margate on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. The Dreamland Margate Cinema building was remodelled and renamed until 15 May 2022.\nThe film includes several pieces of music that are being played on a record player in the film, such as Bob Dylan's \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\", Cat Stevens's \"Morning Has Broken\" and Joni Mitchell's \"You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio\".\nRelease\nEmpire of Light premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on 3 September 2022. It received a limited theatrical release by Searchlight Pictures in the United States on 9 December 2022 and was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2023.\nThe film was released for VOD on 7 February 2023, followed by a Blu-ray and DVD release on 21 February 2023.\nReception\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 45% of 242 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Empire of Light contains some fine performances and a few flashes of brilliance, but this tribute to the magic of cinema is disappointingly mundane.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". A more favourable review in The Guardian said the film was a \"poignant, wonderfully acted drama\".\nMatt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, rating the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, wrote that it \"starts out a bit dim and unfocused and becomes sharper and more illuminating as it unreels.\" He also praised Roger Deakins' cinematography and Olivia Colman's performance, but was more critical of the character of Stephen: \"[H]e remains an abstraction for too long, to the point where it looks like the film is setting him up as more of a plot device (or sacrificial lamb) than a man. The movie trembles with intimations of impending doom for Stephen, and the dialogue mentions then-recent racial incidents. But [Sam] Mendes presents his anger, fear and distress with the same dissociated stare that freezes Hilary in her tracks when she sees skinheads tormenting Stephen on a sidewalk.\"\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%;\"| Date of ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25%;\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:35%;\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| AARP Movies for Grownups Awards\n| 28 January 2023\n| Best Grownup Love Story\n| Empire of Light\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Academy Awards\n| 12 March 2023\n| Best Cinematography\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Roger Deakins\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Alliance of Women Film Journalists\n| 5 January 2023\n| Best Cinematography\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| American Society of Cinematographers\n| 5 March 2023\n| Feature Film\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Black Reel Awards\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 6 February 2023\n| Outstanding Supporting Actor\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Micheal Ward\n|\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Outstanding Breakthrough Actor\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| British Academy Film Awards\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 19 February 2023\n| Best Actor in a Supporting Role\n|\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n| Outstanding British Film\n| Sam Mendes and Pippa Harris\n|\n|-\n| Best Cinematography\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Roger Deakins\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Critics' Choice Awards\n| 15 January 2023\n| Best Cinematography\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Florida Film Critics Circle\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 22 December 2022\n| Best Cinematography\n|\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Best Score\n| Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Golden Globe Awards\n| 10 January 2023\n| Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama\n| Olivia Colman\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Golden Reel Awards\n| 26 February 2023\n| Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing – Feature Dialogue / ADR\n| Oliver Tarney and Rachael Tate\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Guild of Music Supervisors Awards\n| 5 March 2023\n| Best Music Supervision in a Trailer – Film\n| Matthew Bailey and Shawn Stevens (\"Home\")\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Hollywood Music in Media Awards\n| 16 November 2022\n| Best Original Score – Feature Film\n| rowspan=\"2\"| Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Houston Film Critics Society\n| 18 February 2023\n| Best Original Score\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\"| Las Vegas Film Critics Society\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 12 December 2022\n| Best Actress\n| Olivia Colman\n|\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Best Cinematography\n| Roger Deakins\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| London Film Critics' Circle\n| 5 February 2023\n| British Actress of the Year\n| Olivia Colman\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Satellite Awards\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 3 March 2023\n| Best Cinematography\n| Roger Deakins\n|\n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Best Costume Design\n| Alexandra Byrne\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Toronto International Film Festival\n| 8–18 September 2022\n| TIFF Ebert Director Award\n| Sam Mendes\n|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Washington D.C.
