In the , Basilisk had \"no people or a very low population\".\nGeography\nThe locality is almost entirely composed of the Basilisk Range which rises from land close to sea level at the east to a series of unnamed peaks of from 200 to 400 metres. The central and southern area of the locality forms the Basilisk Range National Park. While the northern part of the locality is freehold land, it is mostly undeveloped. The land use in the west of the locality is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe name Basilisk was the original name of the nearby town South Johnstone until 1954. The name comes from the Royal Navy ship  which, under the command of Captain John Moresby, undertook hydrographic surveys off the coast in the early 1870s. The neighbouring locality of Moresby was named after the captain, while  the nearby Mourilyan Harbour and related places are named after the ship's first lieutenant, Thomas Longley Mourilyan.\nDemographics\nIn the , Basilisk had \"no people or a very low population\".\nIn the , Basilisk had \"no people or a very low population\".\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Basilisk.
