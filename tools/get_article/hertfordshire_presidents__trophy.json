It was first introduced during the 1999–00 season, with the inaugural winners being Datchworth.  It is the third most important rugby union cup competition in Hertfordshire, behind the Hertfordshire presidents' Cup and Hertfordshire presidents' Tankard.\nThe presidents' Trophy is currently open to the first teams of club sides based in Hertfordshire that play in tier 9 (Herts/Middlesex 1) and tier 10 (Herts/Middlesex 2) of the English rugby union league system.  The format is a knockout cup with a first round, semi-finals and a final to be held at Allianz Park (Saracen's home ground) in April–May, on the same date and same venue as the Cup and Tankard finals.\nHertfordshire presidents' Trophy winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"|\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n|  style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"|\n| style=\"border:0;\"|'''Hertfordshire presidents' Tankard Finals'''\n|  style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"|\n|}\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Season\n!  style=\"background:#efefef\"|Winner\n!  style=\"background:#efefef\"|Score\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Runners–up\n!  style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Venue\n|- align=left\n|-\n| 1999–2000 || Datchworth ||\n|-\n| 2000–01 || Stevenage Town ||\n|-\n| 2001–02 || Tring ||\n|-\n| 2002–03 || Tring ||\n|-\n| 2003–04 || Tring || || Old Ashmolean ||\n|-\n| 2004–05 || Hitchin ||\n|-\n| 2005–06 || Old Ashmolean || || Hemel Hempstead ||\n|-\n| 2006–07 || Hemel Hempstead || || Barnet Elizabethans || War Memorial Sports Ground, Northwood, London\n|-\n| 2007–08 || Hemel Hempstead || 21–6 || Hitchin || Woollam Playing Fields, St Albans, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2008–09 || Old Ashmolean || 16–13 || Datchworth || War Memorial Sports Ground, Northwood, London\n|-\n| 2009–10 || Verulamians || || Royston ||\n|-\n| 2010–11 || Verulamians || 67–5 || Chess Valley || Redbourn Lane, Harpenden, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2011–12 || Watford || 5–3 || Verulamians ||\n|-\n| 2012–13 || Royston || 38–10 || Borehamwood || Radlett Road, Watford, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2013–14 || Verulamians || 18–8 || Royston || Hobbs Way, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire\n|-\n| 2014–15 || Royston || 14–7 || Cheshunt || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2015–16 || Verulamians || 46–10 || Watford || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2016–17 || Verulamians || 53–10 || Barnet Elizabethans || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2017–18 || Royston || 28–12 || Barnet Elizabethans || Allianz Park, Hendon, London\n|-\n| 2018–19 ||\n|-\n|}\nNumber of wins\n*Verulamians (5)\n*Royston (3)\n*Tring (3)\n*Hemel Hempstead (2)\n*Old Ashmolean (2)\n*Datchworth (1)\n*Hitchin (1)\n*Stevenage Town (1)\n*Watford (1)\nSee also\n* Hertfordshire RFU\n* Hertfordshire presidents' Cup\n* Hertfordshire presidents' Tankard\n* English rugby union system\n* Rugby union in England\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.hertsrugby.co.uk Hertfordshire RFU]"
