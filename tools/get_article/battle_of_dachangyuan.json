Chenheshang grew up in a military family and was familiar with both archery and horse-riding.\nChenheshang led the Zhongxiao (Loyalty) army which consisted of various ethnic groups that were attacked by the Mongols. These included other Mongols, Naimans, Uyghurs, Tanguts, Han Chinese and even Kipchaks.\nJin historian and poet, Yuan Haowen wrote that Chenheshang personally led 400 of his elite cavalry to attack 8,000 soldiers in open battle. Due to the bravery and ferocity demonstrated during the attack, they were successful in lifting the siege. Yuan called this the greatest victory that the Jin Dynasty had seen in its 20 years of war with the Mongols.\nAftermath\nBefore the battle, Jin forces captured a Mongol messenger, Ögölen. After the battle was over, Yila Pua released the messenger and sent him back to Ögedei Khan with the following message: “We’ve got all our soldiers and horses ready - come on over and fight!”.\nÖgedei was furious upon hearing the news of defeat and dismissed Doqolqu, the commander in charge from his post. He also called back Subutai from the Russian front to join the campaign against Jin.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*"
