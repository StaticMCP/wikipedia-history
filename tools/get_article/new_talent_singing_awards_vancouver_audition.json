The winner of the contest will represent the city of Vancouver in the NTSA International Finals, usually held in Hong Kong, organized by TVB.\nContest format\nOriginal Format: Regional - North America - Hong Kong\nFrom its start in 1994, 15 finalists ( 12 finalists from 1996 onwards ) competed in NTSA Vancouver for the top 2 spots.  Those two contestants will then enter the NTSA North American Finals.  12 to 15 regional winners (and some runners-up) from Canada and the US would compete for the title of North American champion.  The North American champion would then compete as the \"overseas contestant\" in the NTSA Finals in Hong Kong.\nInternational Event: Regional - Canada - International\nWith the emergence of several Australian, European and Asian cities like Melbourne, London, Amsterdam and Shanghai wanting to be included in the event, in 1997, TVB Hong Kong created the NTSA International Finals.  Instead of having one \"overseas contestant\" from North America competing in the NTSA Finals ( now renamed the NTSA Hong Kong Regional Finals ), now each participating country would send regional representatives to compete in the NTSA International Finals ( much like an international beauty pageant would ).\nWith that, the North American Finals were cancelled starting that year.  Fairchild TV continued to host the NTSA Canadian Finals to search for National representatives while the American cities just sent their regional winners directly to the NTSA International Finals.\nIn the NTSA Canadian Finals, representatives from 7 Canadian cities ( Toronto and Vancouver always sent two representatives while other cities: Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Victoria and either Ottawa or Montreal sent one ) would compete for the top 3 places, which would give them the opportunity to represent Canada and their city in the NTSA International Finals.\nNew Century, New Format: Regional - International\nIn 2000, Fairchild TV decided to scrap the NTSA Canadian Finals, and have one representative from each of the three cities that Fairchild TV is based in: Vancouver, Toronto, and Calgary ( although sometimes Calgary and Edmonton would combine to produce one contestant representing Alberta ) to compete in the NTSA International Finals.   Since this was the case, the winner of the regional competitions in those cities would directly enter the International Finals.  The same year, Fairchild TV Vancouver decided to reduce the number of finalists from 12 to 8, making the competition extremely intense.  The number of finalists temporarily increased back to 12 in 2007, but dropped back to 8 finalists in 2008.\nContest venues\nNTSA Vancouver is one of the two big annual productions for Fairchild Television Vancouver ( the other being Miss Chinese (Vancouver) Pageant ) and has been held at many state-of-the-art venues.\n*1994 Orpheum Theatre\n*1995 Gateway Theatre\n*1996 Plaza of Nations Outdoor Stage\n*1997 Tom Lee Music Theatre\n*1998 Plaza of Nations Indoor Glass Dome\n*1999 Radisson Hotel Ballroom\n*2000 Plaza of Nations Indoor Glass Dome\n*2001 Plaza of Nations Indoor Glass Dome\n*2002 Plaza of Nations Outdoor Stage\n*2003 The Centre in Vancouver for Performing Arts\n*2004 The Centre in Vancouver for Performing Arts\n*2005 The Centre in Vancouver for Performing Arts\n*2006 Chan Shun Concert Hall at Chan Centre for the Performing Arts\n*2007 The Centre in Vancouver for Performing Arts\n*2008 The Centre in Vancouver for Performing Arts\n*2009 The Centre in Vancouver for Performing Arts\n*2010 River Rock Show Theatre at River Rock Casino Resort\n*2011 River Rock Show Theatre at River Rock Casino Resort\n*2012 River Rock Show Theatre at River Rock Casino Resort\nSpecial performing guests\nFaichild TV would sometimes hire Asian singers or local artists to be the Special Guest(s) performing in the finals.\n*1994 No Special Guest\n*1995 Liz Kong 江希文\n*1996 Karen Tong 湯寶如 (1991 NTSA Top 5)\n*1997 No Special Guest\n*1998 Kenneth Wong 黃君諾 (1995 NTSA Vancouver Winner), Daniel Kwan 關浩正 (1996 NTSA Vancouver Winner), Phillip Lau 劉健濤 (1997 NTSA Vancouver Winner)\n*1999 No Special Guest\n*2000 Gabriel Harrison 海俊傑 (1994 NTSA Winner)\n*2001 Fei Fei Ding 丁菲飛\n*2002 JanaJana\n*2003 Brenda Lo 盧業瑂, Annabelle Louie 雷安娜, Albert Lui 雷有曜 (of the band 太極 Tai Chi)\n*2004 Pansy Lau 劉鳳屏, Thelma Leung 梁聖子, William Ho 何活權\n*2005 Wilfred Lau 劉浩龍 (1997 NTSA International Winner)\n*2006 Niki Chow 周麗淇\n*2007 Stephanie Cheng 鄭融\n*2008 Kay Tse 謝安琪\n*2009 Tat Dik 狄易達, JJ Jia 賈曉晨\n*2010 Prince@Lollipop 邱勝翊（王子）, Xiao Jie@Lollipop 廖俊傑（小傑）\n*2011 Jonathan Wong 王梓軒\n*2012 Ivana Wong 王菀之\nMajor award winners\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;text-align:center\"\n!width=\"5%\"|Year\n!width=\"15%\" |Winner\n!width=\"15%\" |1st Runner-Up\n!width=\"15%\" |2nd Runner-Up\n!width=\"15%\" |Golden Voice Award\n!width=\"15%\" |Best Stage Performance Award\n|-\n|1994\n||13.
