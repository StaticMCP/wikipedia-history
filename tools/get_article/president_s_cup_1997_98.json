The series was a best of three games and Zimbabwe lifted the trophy after winning the first two finals. It was Zimbabwe's first silverware since receiving Test status in 1992.\nIn the first final, Alistair Campbell won the toss and sent Kenya into field. Openers Grant and Andy Flower put on 154 for the first wicket to help Zimbabwe to 281 for 8 from their 50 overs. Campbell chipped in with a half century and for Kenya Steve Tikolo took 3/41. Kenya could only manage 172 in reply despite 67 from Maurice Odumbe in the middle order. Guy Whittall and Grant Flower took a couple of wickets each.\nCampbell won the toss in the second final and again decided to bat first. This time it was the 3rd wicket partnership that set up the Zimbabwean innings, with Grant Flower and Gavin Rennie putting on 150 runs. Both scored 70s and Zimbabwe finished with 6 for 272. Kenya lost their first 3 wickets to Man of the Match Andy Whittall and were never in the hunt. At one stage they were at 7/71 but Aasif Karim scored his maiden ODI half century and put on a 100 run partnership with Hitesh Modi who also scored a 50. Kenya were eventually dismissed for 190 with Paul Strang joining Whittall on 3 wickets.\nExternal links\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/KENYA/1997-98_KENYA_Kenya_Cricket_Association_Presidents_Cup_1997-98.html Cricket Archive]"
