It includes one overdrive gear, a lightweight aluminum housing, and adaptability for four wheel drive use.\nOriginally designed by Borg-Warner, it was manufactured by TREMEC until 2010.\nHistory and design\nThe T-5 was originally designed by Borg-Warner based on the T-4 and earlier SR4, and was sold as the Borg-Warner T-5 until the design was sold to TTC (aka Tremec) in the late 1990s. The SR4 was a light-duty 4-speed manual that used ball and needle bearings on the countershaft with bronze synchronizer rings. The T4 improved this design with tapered roller bearings on the input and output shafts and a straight roller bearing on the counter gear. The T-5 is a T4 with an added overdrive gear. The T-5 carries a part number of 1352-000-xxx, where xxx is a three-digit application-specific number ranging from 001 to 260 that also can be used to distinguish World Class from Standard T-5 transmissions.\nThe first T-5s were installed in the AMC Spirit/Concord. In 1982, GM began fitting the T-5 to the S-10/S-15 compact pickup trucks; then in 1983, both Ford (Mustang) and GM (Camaro/Firebird) picked up the T-5 for their pony cars.\nThe T-5 has become a popular restomod option for older and classic manual transmission cars, as the overdrive gear can improve fuel economy. In general, retrofitting the T-5 is straightforward for many rear-drive Fords from the 1960s and 1970s, as they are dimensionally compatible.\nModels\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:15em;\"\n|+Differences between World Class and Standard transmissions\n!

Compared to the Standard, the WC changes bearing types and blocker ring materials. Externally, the tapered roller bearing race for the countershaft at the front of the WC, facing the clutch and below the input shaft, can be distinguished from the corresponding straight roller bearing cup of the STD. If this is not visually accessible, the color of the synchronizer rings can be used to distinguish the two types, with the oil fill plug removed. WC transmissions should be filled with automatic transmission fluid, while STD models use 50W gear oil.\nSTD transmissions are rated at up to  of input torque with a 2.95:1 first gear. Most STD transmissions have a first gear of 3.75 to 4.10:1 for smaller-displacement engines; these so-called 4-cylinder T-5s are rated up to  of input torque.\nWC transmissions initially carried the same maximum input torque rating of  until hardened first gears were introduced in approximately 1990, raising the rating to . Typical first gear ratios for the WC ranged from 3.35 to 3.97:1; the Ford Mustang SVO had a unique 3.50:1 first gear for 1986.\nApplications\n* 1982-83 AMC Spirit\n* 1982-83 AMC Concord\n* 1982-88 AMC Eagle\n* 1982-86 Jeep CJ-7\n* 1984-86 2.5L Inline 4, 2.8L V6, and turbo diesel Jeep Cherokee XJ/Comanche MJ\n* 1984-86 Ford Mustang SVO (World-Class T-5 1985-1986)\n* 1983.5-1995 V8 Ford Mustang (World-Class T-5 1985-1995)\n* 1993-1995 V8 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra (BorgWarner T-5)\n* 1983.5-1986 V8 Mercury Capri (World-Class T-5 1985-1986)\n* 1994-2010 V6 Ford Mustang\n* 1983-1993 Inline-4 Ford Mustang\n* 1983-1986 Inline-4 Mercury Capri\n* 1983-1988 Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe and Mercury Cougar XR-7\n* 1986-2004 Ford Falcon\n* 1985-1987 Ford Sierra RS Cosworth\n* 1988 Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth\n* 1988-1989 Ford Sierra Cosworth Sapphire 2wd\n* Chevrolet S-10 Blazer\n* 1983-1992 Chevrolet Camaro (Non-World-Class T-5 to 1987 and World Class from 1988 - 1992with RPO code MK6)\n* 1993-2002 Chevrolet Camaro (V6 models World-Class)\n* 1986-1989 Chevrolet Astro\n* 1986-1989 GMC Safari\n* 1982-1995 Chevrolet S-10\n* 1982-1983 (Datsun) Nissan 280ZX Turbo\n* 1984-1986 Nissan 300ZX Turbo\n* 1989-1995 Holden Commodore VN - VS S1\n* Panther Solo 2\n* 1983-1992 Pontiac Firebird (Non-World-Class T-5 to 1987 and World Class from 1988 - 1992 with RPO code MK6)\n* 1993-2002 Pontiac Firebird (V6 models World-Class)\n* 2004-2010 Mustang V6 4.0L\n* Ssangyong Musso\n* Ssangyong Korando\n* TVR Griffith 500\n* TVR Chimaera 500\n* TVR Cerbera\n* TVR Tuscan with the option of a close ratio gearset on 1st, 2nd & 3rd gears for the Tuscan S\n* TVR T350\n* TVR Tamora\n* TVR Sagaris with the option of the close ratio gearset used in the Tuscan S\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
