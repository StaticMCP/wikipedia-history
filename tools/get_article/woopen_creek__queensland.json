In the , Woopen Creek had a population of 135 people.\nGeography\nThe Russell River forms the northern boundary of the locality while mountainous regions form its other boundaries. There are two flatter valleys formed by Woopen Creek in the southern part of locality and Vorris Creek in the northern part of the locality. Although the land is predominantly freehold, only the flatter valleys are developed for use for agriculture while the more mountainous areas remain undeveloped. The principal agricultural use is growing sugarcane and bananas.\nAlthough the Bruce Highway does not pass through the locality,\nMount Mirinjo () in the Francis Range is in the southernmost part of locality, close to the boundary with Ngatjan. It is  above sea level compared with approximately  above sea level at the northernmost part of the locality.\nHistory\nBy 1940, residents of Woopen Creek had agitated for some years to have a school in their district. In November 1941 tenders were called to erect the school. However, the school was not built at this time, probably because the fear of a Japanese invasion in 1942 resulted in the closure of schools in coastal areas and reserving all construction materials exclusively for military purposes. In March 1951 residents made another attempt to establish a school at Woopen Creek. In 1951 the Queensland Government decided relocate the school building from Nerada State School (which closed in 1945) to establish Woopen Creek State School. The school opened on 4 February 1952. It closed on 8 December 1967.\nIn 2005 the Broken Nose Vanilla farm was established, an example of a wider trend of diversifying the agriculture of the Cairns region.\nDemographics\nIn the , Woopen Creek had a population of 141 people.\nIn the , Woopen Creek had a population of 135 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Woopen Creek.
