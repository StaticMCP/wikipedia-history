Voters chose eight representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nTennessee cast seven electoral votes for the Democratic-Republican candidate and incumbent President James Monroe, as he ran effectively unopposed. The electoral votes for vice president were cast for Monroe's running mate Daniel D. Tompkins from New York. The state was divided into electoral districts, with each district being assigned an elector who was chosen by the voters. However one elector died before the electoral votes were cast and was not replaced; therefore, only seven votes were cast for Monroe and Tompkins, instead of eight.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1820 United States presidential election in Tennessee\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic-Republican\n| James Monroe (incumbent)\n| align=\"right\" | 1,336\n| align=\"right\" | 80.34%\n| align=\"right\" | 7\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#c0c0c0; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |\n| Others\n| align=\"right\" | 327\n| align=\"right\" | 19.66%\n| align=\"right\" | 0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#c0c0c0; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | None\n| Not Cast\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | –\n| align=\"right\" | 1\n|-\n|-bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Totals\n| align=\"right\" | 1,663\n| align=\"right\" | 100.0%\n| align=\"right\" | 8\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Tennessee\nReferences"
