It is included in the Catholic Church's list of Latin titular sees.\nDiscovery\nThe site of Olba, within the broader Olbian region, was identified by archaeologist Theodore Bent and his wife in March 1890, during their survey of part of Cilicia Tracheia.\nHistory\n, Olba.]]\nOlba was a city of Cetis in Cilicia Aspera, later forming part of Isauria.   It was situated at the foot of the Taurus Mountains, on a tributary of the Calycadnus.\nAccording to Greek mythology, Olbe had been built by Ajax, half-brother of Teucer; it contained a temple of Zeus, whose priest once ruled over all Cilicia Aspera.\nStrabo described it:\n:\"Above this [Kyinda] and Soloi [in Kilikia] is a mountainous country, in which is a city Olbe, with a temple of Zeus, founded by Aias the son of Teukros. The priest of this temple became dynast of Kilikia Trakheia; and then the country was beset by numerous tyrants, and the gangs of pirates were organized. And after the overthrow of these they called this country the domain of Teukros, and called the same also the priesthood of Teukros; and most of the priests were named Teukros or Aias.\"\nThe temple would have been closed when Christianity was introduced during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.\nDuring the 1st century BC, it was ruled by the local tyrants Zenophanes and his daughter Aba.  Later, it became a Roman colony. Strabo calls it Olbe (Ὄλβη). Ptolemy calls it Olbasa (Ὄλβασα). Stephanus of Byzantium calls it Olbia (Ὀλβία).\nA coin of Diocæsarea, Olbos; Hierocles (Synecdemus, 709), Olbe; Basil of Seleucia (Mirac. S.Theclæ, 2, 8) and the Greek Notitiæ episcopatuum, Olba.  The primitive name must have been Ourba or Orba, found in Theophanes the Chronographer, hence Ourbanopolis in \"Acta S. Bartholomei\".\nIn Christian times, it was regarded as belonging to Isauria, and was the seat of a bishop.\nIts ruins, north of Silifke in the Turkish province of Mersin, are called Oura in Turkish.\nEcclesiastical history\nOlba was a suffragan of the Metropolitan of Isauria's provincial capital Seleucia, but faded like most sees in Asia Minor. Olba maintained a sizable Christian population in the 4th and 5th centuries, when the Temple of Zeus was converted into a church.\nMichel Le Quien (Oriens christianus, II, 1031) gives four bishops between the fourth and seventh centuries; but the Notitiæ episcopatuum mentions the see until the thirteenth century.\nTitular see\nThe diocese was nominally restored as titular bishopric of the episcopal (lowest) rank under the name Olba (Latin and Curiate Italian); Latin adjective Olbiensis.\nIn 1927 it was suppressed, having had the following incumbents, all of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank:\n* Louis-François-Alexandre de Jarente de Senas d’Orgeval (1780.12.11 – 1788.05.28), Coadjutor Bishop of Orleans (France) (1780.12.11 – 1788.05.28), succeeding as Bishop of Orléans (1788.05.28 – retired 1801.10.29); died 1805\n* Antonio Luis Gaona, Military Order of Saint James the Sword (O.S.)
