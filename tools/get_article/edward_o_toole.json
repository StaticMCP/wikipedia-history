      "text": "# Edward O'Toole\n\nEdward O’Toole (December 27, 1866 – October 2, 1940) was an American businessman and the first general superintendent U.S. Coal & Coke Company, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel Corporation. His leadership contributed to rapid economic development in southern West Virginia. O’Toole served on the staffs of two West Virginia governors, held the position of President of the Adkins District School Board, and played a key role in organizing multiple national banks. Internationally recognized as an authority in his field, he traveled around the world advising on various mining operations. He later built a movie studio in Florida and served as an executive for Colonnade Pictures Corporation.\nEarly life and education\nEdward O’Toole was born in Salineville, Ohio, to Edward and Margaret (Collins) O'Toole. His father, born in the town of Shrule in County Mayo, Ireland in 1828, was the son of a surgeon, while his mother, born in the parish of Islandeady in County Mayo in 1828, descended from a family of noted Irish scholars and farmers.\nThe younger Edward received his early education in the common schools of Columbiana County, Ohio. He began working in the coal mines during the summer between school terms, starting at 9 years old.\nCareer in coal\nEdward O'Toole emerged as a leader through his early immersion in coal mines and dedicated career in the field. His contributions encompassed mining, prospecting, purchasing, development, and sales. Beyond operational roles, he earned acclaim as an inventor, securing patents for machinery and advancing coal processing methods.\nO’Toole's served as an engineer at H.C. Frick Coke Company where he assisted Orran W. Kennedy, the general superintendent of coal operations in Scottdale, Pennsylvania, in 1888. The consolidation of H.C. Frick Coke Company and U.S. Coal & Coke Company into U.S. Steel marked a pivotal moment in O'Toole's career. Thomas Lynch, previously from H.C. Frick Coke Company and then president of U.S. Steel's coal mining subsidiaries, appointed top-tier individuals for U.S. Coal & Coke Company to elevate mining in southern West Virginia. Lynch, already familiar with O'Toole's capabilities, facilitated his relocation to Gary, West Virginia, in 1903, where he assumed the role of an assistant to Jared M. B Reis, the general manager of operations. In 1904, O'Toole was promoted to become the longest-serving general superintendent in U.S. Coal & Coke Company history.\nAccomplishments\nO'Toole directed the development of coal mines of U.S. Steel in West Virginia and Lynch, Kentucky for over 30 years. He acquired multiple U.S. Patents for inventions that include the O'Toole-Jeffrey Over Cutting Machine, the O'Toole Cutting and Loading Machine, and a pioneering coal cleaning process devised for the American Coal Cleaning Corporation.\nO'Toole contributed to the establishment and advocacy of Workmen's Compensation Laws in 1920s West Virginia. His political involvement with the Republican Party included serving as Colonel on the staff of Governor William M.O. Dawson from 1905-1909 and later as General on the staff of Governor William E. Glassock from 1909-1913. In 1905, O'Toole was elected as President of the Board of Education in the Adkins District, West Virginia and served in that role for 26 years.\nHe presented at the American Society of Mechanical Engineers on coal mine mechanization and the American Iron and Steel Institute on the benefits of dry cleaning coal. He also spoke to officials from the Norfolk and Western Railway, known for its expertise in operational efficiency.\nHe conducted mine inspections in Germany, Belgium, France, and England, contributing to the advancement of the U.S. Steel coal mining branch. His commitment to industrial exploration also led him to South America, where he conducted multiple trips to assess the coal market for the Central Pocahontas Coal Company and Crystal Block Companies.\nLegacy\nO'Toole, known as \"Colonel,\" contributed to the economic development of southern West Virginia and southeastern Kentucky. Upon his arrival in McDowell County in 1903, the area was largely wilderness. By the 1930s, it had transformed into a well-established region with \"top-notch schools\", modern houses, and state-of-the-art mining plants. O'Toole formed a company baseball club, occasionally recruiting big-leaguers from as far as New York for important games against neighboring camps.\nThe town of Sarah Ann, West Virginia acquired its name from the wife of Edward O’Toole. O'Toole was manager of the coal company when the town applied to the government for a post office.\nHe was instrumental in the formation of the following institutions:\n* National banks of Gary, West Virginia, Anawalt, West Virginia and Lynch, Kentucky\n* Central Pocahontas Coal Company\n* Crystal Block Coal & Coke Company\n* Crystal Block Mining Company\n* Crystal Supply Company\n* Tug River Electric Company\n* Kentucky River Power Company\nU.S. Patents\nO’Toole is credited with the approval for numerous U.S. Patents between 1914-1936.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|+Approved U.S. Patents\n!Patent No.\n!Title\n!Granted\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1096795 1096795]\n|Method of and apparatus for sinking shafts\n|1914\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1143897 1143897]\n|Mining-machine\n|1915\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1283880 1283880]\n|Mining-machine\n|1918\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1491060 1491060]\n|Car-dumping apparatus\n|1924\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1495352 1495352]\n|Mine shaft\n|1924\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1517095 1517095]\n|Mining apparatus\n|1924\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1534461 1534461]\n|Mining machine\n|1925\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1534462 1534462]\n|Mining machine\n|1925\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1534463 1534463]\n|Longwall mining machine\n|1925\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1561481 1561481]\n|Longwall mining machine\n|1925\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1581686 1581686]\n|Screen\n|1926\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1583992 1583992]\n|Mining machine\n|1926\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1588987 1588987]\n|Method of mining\n|1926\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1617688 1617688]\n|Rotary screen\n|1927\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1638507 1634434]\n|Mining and loading machine\n|1927\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1638507 1638507]\n|Mining and loading machine\n|1927\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1667331 1667331]\n|Cleaning and sizing apparatus\n|1928\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1687306 1687306]\n|Mining machine\n|1928\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1687949 1687949]\n|Heading machine\n|1928\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1683297 1683297]\n|Mining machine\n|1928\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1693861 1693861]\n|Apparatus for cleaning coal\n|1928\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1735974 1735974]\n|Roof support\n|1929\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1737327 1737327]\n|Mining machine\n|1929\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1789252 1789252]\n|Airplane and propeller\n|1931\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1888636 1888636]\n|Screening and concentrating apparatus\n|1932\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1914282 1914282]\n|Filter for removing dust from the air\n|1933\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1949324 1949324]\n|Apparatus for dry cleaning of coal\n|1934\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1950861 1950861]\n|Method and apparatus for feeding, and separating, dry coal from refuse\n|1934\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/1951705 1951705]\n|Apparatus for the separation of coal and the like\n|1934\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/2009273 2009273]\n|Apparatus for dry cleaning of coal\n|1935\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/2044628 2044628]\n|Treating coal, ore, grain, and similar materials\n|1936\n|-\n|[https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/2154180 2154180]\n|Dry coal cleaning apparatus\n|1939\n|}\nMotion Picture Executive\nO’Toole retired from U.S. Steel in 1933 at age 66, moving from McDowell County in 1935.
