This list is a complement to the list in Books of the Latin Vulgate. It is an aid to finding cross references between two longstanding standards of biblical literature.\nPreliminary note\nThere are 66 books in modern printings of the King James Bible; 39 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament. Originally, when published in 1611, the King James Bible also contained 14 Books of the Apocrypha but these were gradually omitted from the early 1800s. The Catholic Bible contains 73 books; seven, called the deuterocanonical books taken from the 14 books of the Apocrypha . These seven are considered canonical by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, and the Church of the East, but not generally by other  Christians.\nWhen citing the Latin Vulgate, chapter and verse are separated with a comma, for example \"Ioannem 3,16\"; in English Bibles chapter and verse are separated with a colon, for example \"John 3:16\".\nThe Psalms of the two versions are numbered differently. The Vulgate follows the Septuagint numbering, while the King James Version follows the numbering of the Masoretic Text. This generally results in the Psalms of the former being one number behind the latter. See the article on Psalms for more details.\nOld Testament\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! King James Bible).
