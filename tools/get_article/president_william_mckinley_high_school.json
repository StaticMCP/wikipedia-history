It serves grades nine through twelve. McKinley is one of three schools in the Kaimuki-McKinley-Roosevelt Complex Area which includes Kaimuki High School and Roosevelt High School. It was founded as Fort Street English Day School in 1865. Later known as Honolulu High School, it was renamed in memorial to William McKinley, the twenty-fifth President of the United States, in 1907. President William McKinley High School is one of the oldest secondary schools in the state and several of its buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The campus displays sculptures by Satoru Abe (1926–2025) and Bumpei Akaji (1921–2002). McKinley High School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.\nHistory\nThe high school was established in 1865 as the Fort Street English Day School and was founded by Maurice B. Beckwith. In November 1869, it was moved to Keōua Hale, the former palace of Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani. In 1895, it was renamed to Honolulu High School. In 1907, it was moved to the corner of Beretania and Victoria Streets and renamed President William McKinley High School. It finally moved to its present campus on King Street in 1923.\nOn June 5, 1938, the school gave diplomas to 1,288 students, the largest number of diplomas in the history of the school.\nCrosswalk incident\nIn February 2023, McKinley High School junior Sara Yara was killed in a hit and run after a driver ran her over on a crosswalk near the school.
