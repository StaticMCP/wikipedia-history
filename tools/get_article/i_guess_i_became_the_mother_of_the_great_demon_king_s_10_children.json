Deciding to play an adventure game her mother got her long ago, Akari ended up summoned into it as the prophesied saintess by the demons. She has to give birth to Demon Lord Gran's ten children, to lead the demons to victory against the humans. However, the humans think the demons are the evil ones, when the demons are only fighting to keep humans out of their territory, all the while a third race, known as Celestial, observe.\nCharacters\n;\n:A high school girl who was summoned to another world, due to her desire to be a mother. Her relationship with Gran starts out poorly, but they start to understand each other through missing their parents. Most of her children were born unnaturally due magical conception. Akari lacks any magical powers, having to rely on her negotiation skills and children.\n:Akari essentially has her life fast forwarded by the events of the story, skipping out on her remaining carefree adolescence and straight to motherhood. Despite this, Akari is loving mother to her children.\n;\n:The current Demon Lord, succeeding his captured mother and missing father; his father was human, also from Akari's world. Due to being forced to mature as a leader early, Gran grew up with diminished empathy. Having Akari teach him about parenting helps Gran soften and focus more on giving his children a happy life.\nThe Children\nThe Children of prophecy are each born with a great skill that can cause destruction. However, it is an exaggeration; their given skills are more about helping others and only a danger if someone corrupts the children. With the exception of the triplets, none of the children were conceived naturally, while the rest were created magically; they are all born of eggs that pop out of Akari via the magic way. Three of them were accidents due to the magic bway. Akari names them all after French numbers.\n;\n:The first daughter. She has the skill to be a great cook and can make delicious, nutritional meals.

She was born from Akari drinking a potion of Gran's magic.\n;\n:The first son. He has the skill to master any tool. Rather than weapons, Deux works to help produce better harvesting and building tools.

He is able to command animals and understand them, keeping the vicious beasts in line and playing with the fluffy ones. He was born by accident when Akari who was wearing his grandmother's magic fertility dress touched Gran.\n;\n:Twin sister of Trois. She is a master craftsman, able to build anything so long as she has a blueprint. Quatre has a  admiration for Albert.

When she met the first hero, Ciel began feeling a bond and ignored her hunger. However, once he fell in love with the demon queen, Ciel flew into a jealousy that made her angrier because she could not eat her own misery.
