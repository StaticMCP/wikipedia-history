The new club won the league and the Doherty Cup in their debut season. The next season, the club progressed into the North West League Division 2 and earned promotion to the North West Division 1.\nIn 1979, Portstewart applied to join the Northern Ireland Intermediate League (NIIL). The most defining moment in the club's history came when they appointed Frankie Moffatt, for the first of two spells, as manager in 1984. Moffatt delivered the league title in his first year in charge and followed this up with success in the NIIL Challenge Cup and NIIL League Cup. Following spells at Ballymoney United and then Coleraine, Moffatt returned as manager in 1991.\nPortstewart created history in 1994, when they defeated Limavady Utd 1–0 in the William Youngers Intermediate Cup final, becoming the first junior team in over 100 years of the competition to lift the trophy. In 2003, Portstewart were accepted into newly created Irish league Division 2.\nMoffatt's decision to step down as manager resulted in his assistant Trevor McKendry taking charge of team affairs. McKendry led the team to the North West Cup final in 2004 when they were narrowly defeated by Tobermore United. In the 2005/06 season, when Portstewart gained promotion to second tier of Irish League football for the first time in the club's history. Portstewart won the 2007/08 Craig Memorial Cup beating Tobermore United, 2–1.\nIn 2016, the club was relegated from the Northern Ireland Football League, but was promoted back after one season. The 2016/17 season saw Portstewart win the Northern Ireland Intermediate League, Intermediate Challenge Cup and Intermediate League Cup. The club also reached the fifth round of the Irish Cup where they got defeated by Glenavon.\nIn the 2017/18 season, Portstewart reached the final of Craig Memorial Cup, losing 2–1 to Maiden City. On 17 July 2018, the club announced the resignation of long-serving manager and former captain, Gary Taylor. 3 days later, Johnny Law was appointed as the new manager.\nDuring the 2018/19 season, a match between Portstewart and Sport & Leisure Swifts was abandoned after 70 minutes when a fan joined a \"mass brawl\" between players and coaches. Further controversy followed when Portstewart lost their place in the Irish Intermediate Cup final, following a protest from Queen's University about the eligibility of one of Portstewart's players.\nPortstewart beat Moyola Park 1–0, to win the 2019 Craig Memorial Cup. The 2019/20 season was disrupted in March by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the club still unbeaten in the league and sitting 2nd after 14 games.\nStadium\nThe club's home ground, Mullaghacall, was officially opened in 1997 by Harry Gregg MBE. A revamp in the Irish league saw a number of clubs demoted in 2008 into an interim league until ground improvements were completed. A new stand was built at Mullaghacall in 2009 and the club once again entered into the reformed Irish league. The Mullaghacall ground has regularly hosted games in the SuperCupNI youth tournament.\nHonours\nIntermediate honours\n*Irish Intermediate Cup: 1\n**1993–94\n*IFA Intermediate Second Division: 1\n**2005–06\n*Craig Memorial Cup: 4\n**1985–86, 2007–08, 2019–20, 2021–22\n*Northern Ireland Intermediate League: 2\n**1984–85, 2016–17\n*Intermediate Challenge Cup: 1\n**2016–17\n*Intermediate League Cup: 1\n**2016–17\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
