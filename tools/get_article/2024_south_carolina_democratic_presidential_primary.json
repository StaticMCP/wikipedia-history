CNN and Associated Press called the race early, for incumbent President Joe Biden. Biden won in a landslide of the total turnout of 4% of registered voters, receiving no less than 94% of the vote in every county.\nScheduling\nUnder the Democratic Party's 2024 calendar that was released in February 2023, South Carolina was scheduled to hold the first primary on February 3, with New Hampshire and Nevada expected to hold their primaries on February 6. However, due to New Hampshire state law requiring that its primary must be held first, the state held a primary boycotted by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on January 23, which incumbent president Joe Biden won as a write-in candidate. The election marked the first time that South Carolina hosted the first primary of the Democratic nominating process supported by the DNC.\nProcedure\nChristale Spain, the first black woman state chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, was put in charge of running the primary. South Carolina holds open primaries, so any registered voter in the state can participate.\nSouth Carolina will choose 65 delegates, of which 10 will be unpledged superdelegates and seven will be party leaders and officials who are pledged to a candidate. The remaining delegates will be allocated proportionally based on the results of this primary. 36 delegates will be allocated by congressional district, and the other 12 will be allocated at large. Candidates who receive less than 15% of the vote in a congressional district or at large will not receive any delegates from that district.\nCandidates\nThe following candidates were certified by the executive council of the South Carolina Democratic Party as candidates:\n* Joe Biden\n* Dean Phillips\n* Marianne Williamson\nFailed to make ballot\nThe following candidates filed, although they were not certified by the council:\n* Eban Cambridge (incomplete candidate filing)\n* Cenk Uygur (disqualified due to not being a natural-born citizen)\nIn December 2023, Uygur's campaign filed a lawsuit against the state party for rejecting his candidate filing.\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable tpl-blanktable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!
