He was known as \"Ned Wymarke\".\nWymarke was a fringe official who collected revenue for the crown from concealed lands and was reimbursed from the proceeds. In 1597, he was returned as Member of Parliament for Chippenham after the elected candidate Thomas Edmunds was sent abroad as an ambassador. He succeeded to the estates of his father in 1599. In 1601 he was re-elected MP  for Chippenham. He sold his revenue collection office and register of lands in 1602. In 1604 he was elected MP for Peterborough. He was re-elected MP for Peterborough in 1614. He was also elected MP for  Liverpool and Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1614 but it is not known which was his chosen seat. He lived comfortably in London, and is noted as bemusing his friends by going out by \"owl light to the Star and to the Windmill\".\nWymarke died probably unmarried  in 1634 and was buried in St. Botolph’s, Aldersgate. He left his estate to his sister Frances Green, wife of John Green of Market Overton, Rutland.\nReferences"
