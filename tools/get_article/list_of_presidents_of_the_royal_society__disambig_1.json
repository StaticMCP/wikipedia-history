King Charles II granted the society a Royal Charter on 15 July 1662, formally establishing it as the \"Royal Society of London.\" The Royal Charter nominated William Brouncker as president and stipulated that future presidents should be elected by the Council and Fellows of the Society at anniversary meetings each year on St. Andrew's Day (30 November).\nThe details of the presidency were described by the second Royal Charter in 1663, which did not set any limit on how long a president could serve. There were considerable fluctuations in the president's term of office until well into the 19th century. By then, sentiment had turned against electing wealthy amateurs solely because they might become patrons of the society, and in 1847 the society decided that Fellows would be elected solely on scientific merit. Since the 1870s, it has been usual (with a few exceptions) for each President to serve for exactly five years. Under the current statutes, a president cannot serve for more than five years. The current President is Sir Adrian Smith who began his 5-year tenure on 30 November 2020.\nHistorically, the duties of the president have been both formal and social. Under the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, the President was one of only a few people authorized to certify that a particular experiment on an animal was justified, and in addition he acted as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor for scientific matters. At the same time, the President was tasked with entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.\nThe changeover of presidents occurs on the Royal Society Anniversary Day, the weekday on or nearest to 30 November, after the departing President's Anniversary Address. Of the 26 presidents since 1901, 18 have been Nobel laureates (seven in Physiology or Medicine, four in Physics and seven in Chemistry). Many past presidents, including all those in the 20th century, have been appointed to the Order of Merit.\nSir Joseph Banks was the longest serving president of Royal Society, serving from 1778 to 1820.\nPresidents of the Royal Society\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=text-align:center; border=\"1\"\n|+\n! scope=col |\n! scope=col width=\"100px\" | Term\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Portrait\n! scope=col width=\"160px\" | President\n! scope=col class=unsortable | Profession\n|-\n|1\n| 1662–1677 ||  || William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|| Mathematician\n|-\n|2\n| 1677–1680 ||  || Sir Joseph Williamson || Civil servant and politician\n|-\n|3\n| 1680–1682 ||  || Sir Christopher Wren || Architect, astronomer and physicist\n|-\n|4\n| 1682–1683 ||  || Sir John Hoskyns, 2nd Baronet|| Lawyer\n|-\n|5\n| 1683–1684 ||  || Cyril Wyche || Lawyer, politician and administrator\n|-\n|6\n| 1684–1686 ||  || Samuel Pepys || Civil servant and politician\n|-\n|7\n| 1686–1689 ||  || John Vaughan, 3rd Earl of Carbery|| Politician\n|-\n|8\n| 1689–1690 ||  || Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke|| Politician\n|-\n|9\n| 1690–1695 ||  || Sir Robert Southwell || Diplomat\n|-\n|10\n| 1695–1698 ||  || Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|| Poet and Statesman\n|-\n|11\n| 1698–1703 ||  || John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|| Jurist and Statesman\n|-\n|12\n| 1703–1727 ||  || Sir Isaac Newton || Physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, and theologian\n|-\n|13\n| 1727–1741 ||  || Sir Hans Sloane, 1st Baronet || Physician and collector\n|-\n|14\n| 1741–1752 ||  || Martin Folkes || Antiquarian\n|-\n|15\n| 1752–1764 ||  || George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield|| Astronomer\n|-\n|16\n| 1764–1768 ||  || James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton|| Astronomer\n|-\n|17\n| 1768–1768 ||  || Sir James Burrow || Legal reporter\n|-\n|18\n| 1768–1772 ||  || James West || Politician and antiquarian\n|-\n|19\n| 1772–1772 ||  || Sir James Burrow || Legal reporter\n|-\n|20\n| 1772–1778 ||  || Sir John Pringle, 1st Baronet || Physician\n|-\n|21\n| 1778–1820 ||  || Sir Joseph Banks || Naturalist and botanist\n|-\n|22\n| 1820-1820 ||  || William Hyde Wollaston || Chemist\n|-\n|23\n| 1820–1827 ||  || Sir Humphry Davy, 1st Baronet || Chemist and inventor\n|-\n|24\n| 1827–1830 ||  || Davies Gilbert || Engineer, author and politician\n|-\n|25\n| 1830–1838 ||  || Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|| Sixth son of George III of the United Kingdom\n|-\n|26\n| 1838–1848 ||  || Spencer Compton, 2nd Marquess of Northampton|| Nobleman\n|-\n|27\n| 1848–1854 ||  || William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|| Astronomer\n|-\n|28\n| 1854–1858 ||  || John Wrottesley, 2nd Baron Wrottesley|| Astronomer\n|-\n|29\n| 1858–1861 ||  || Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet|| Physiologist and surgeon\n|-\n|30\n| 1861–1871 ||  || Sir Edward Sabine ||  Astronomer, geophysicist, ornithologist and explorer\n|-\n|31\n| 1871–1873 ||  || Sir George Biddell Airy || Mathematician and Astronomer\n|-\n|32\n| 1873–1878 ||  || Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker || Botanist and explorer\n|-\n|33\n| 1878–1883 ||  || William H.
