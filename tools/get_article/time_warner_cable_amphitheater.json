The structure later was used for covered parking until it was removed in April 2012.\nWith a location along the banks of the Cuyahoga River, the structure offered scenic views of the city lights and the river bridges. The amphitheater typically hosted 25&ndash;30 events per year, including festivals such as Great American Rib Cook-off and the Taste of Cleveland. Shows sometimes began as early as April and typically ran through September.\nIn 2006, the building played host to such acts as Chicago, Rob Zombie, Dave Chappelle and Alice Cooper.\nTime Warner Cable Amphitheater was owned and operated by Live Nation, a company that also runs Jacobs Pavilion and Blossom Music Center.\nSee also\n*List of contemporary amphitheatres\nReferences"
