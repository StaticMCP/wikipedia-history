The clash allowed the Duchy of Milan to recover a big part of Bassa Bresciana. The battle resulted in the deaths of many Venetians and, as a result of the defeat the Serenisima Republica removed Jacopo Piccinino from command of its armies. The Treaty of Lodi was signed the next year in April. In order to secure his lands and avoid further conflict with Milan Piccinino married Drusiana Sforza, the illegitimate daughter of the Milanese Duke Francesco Sforza in 1464.\nReferences"
