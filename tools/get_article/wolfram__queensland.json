It was also known as Wolfram Camp. It is at an altitude of approximately 538 metres.\nHistory\nThe mineral wolfram (from which the town derives its name) was discovered in the area in 1891 and attracted miners from neighbouring mining regions such as Thornborough and the Palmer River, forming a settlement known initially as Wolfram Camp.\nWolfram today\nToday there are few visible remains of the settlement. There are some concrete foundations of long-gone buildings, headstones in the cemetery, and a row of mango trees that mark where the school used to be.\nHeritage listings\nWolfram has a number of sites listed on the Queensland Heritage Register including:\n* La Société Française des Métaux Rares treatment plant, Main Street\n* Thermo Electric Ore Reduction Corporation Mill, Wolfram Road\nNotable people\n* Bunny Adair, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Cook was born in Wolfram\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
