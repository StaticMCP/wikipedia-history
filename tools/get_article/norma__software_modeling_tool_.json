Since the early 1990s, talented staff at ServerWare, Asymetrix Corporation, InfoModelers Incorporated,\nVisio Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Neumont University worked to develop state of the art CASE tools to support the specific ORM method discussed in this book.\" (Preface, xxvi)\nORM2\nORM2 contains improvements to the original ORM1 specification. ORM2 is implemented in NORMA. Dr. Terry Halpin led the original NORMA effort whilst serving as a Professor at Neumont University and from 2007, continued via The ORM Foundation, a UK-based non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of the fact-based approach to information modeling\nORM2 is defined in an ORM2 metamodel that was created by using the NORMA tool.\nNORMA is an open source project. As at 3 March 2019, NORMA for Visual Studio 2017 includes fixes for 38 bugs that were found in the 2015 versions. The remaining issues are being handled within the NORMA Plus JIRA project that you can read about here.  https://ormfoundation.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa.  Ken Evans 10:58, 3 March 2019 (UTC)\nThis link shows the current list of unresolved issues in NORMA.\nhttps://ormfoundation.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=issuetype%20%3D%20Bug%20AND%20status%20in%20(%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20%22To%20Do%22)\nThe main objectives for the ORM2 graphical notation are:\n* More compact display of object-role models without compromising clarity\n* Improved internationalization (e.g. avoid English language symbols)\n* Simplified drawing rules to facilitate creation of a graphical editor\n* Full support of textual annotations (e.g. footnoting of textual rules)\n* Use of views for selectively displaying/suppressing detail\n* Support for new features\nProject\nIn September 2016, the \"NORMA Plus\" JIRA project was established to document the code and to resolve current issues.[https://ormfoundation.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa].Ken Evans 14:37, 18 July 2017 (UTC)\nAs at 3 March 2019, the NORMA Plus project has resolved 38 of the bugs were found in the 2015 version of NORMA.
