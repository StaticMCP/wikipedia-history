This was Zhirinovsky's fourth campaign for the Russian presidency, as he had previously run in the 1991, 1996, and 2000 elections.\nCampaigning\nDuring the campaign Zhirinovsky released a video in which he fired a rifle at targets bearing the faces of his opponents.\nZhirinovsky generated controversy on the campaign trail by espousing severe and ludicrous proposals. For instance,  he suggested that Russia should drop nuclear bombs into the Atlantic in order to create a tsunami that would flood Great Britain.\nRather than distancing himself from the scandal-ridden LDPR party member Andrey Lugovoy, who was wanted by Scotland Yard for murder, Zhirinovsky intentionally sought to be photographed beside him.\nPlatform\nZhirinovsky took rather extreme positions on many issues. For instance, he proposed a locking down and closing all of Russia's borders immediately after the election. He declared, \"If you think that these are the actions of a police state, well, be my guest. I promise that I will take these actions.\"\nSee also\n*Vladimir Zhirinovsky 1991 presidential campaign\n*Vladimir Zhirinovsky 1996 presidential campaign\n*Vladimir Zhirinovsky 2000 presidential campaign\n*Vladimir Zhirinovsky 2012 presidential campaign\n*Vladimir Zhirinovsky 2018 presidential campaign\nReferences"
