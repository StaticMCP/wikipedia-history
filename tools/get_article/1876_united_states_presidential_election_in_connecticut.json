Voters chose six representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nConnecticut voted for the Democratic nominee, Samuel J. Tilden, over the Republican nominee, Rutherford B. Hayes. Tilden won the state by a narrow margin of 2.37%. It was the first time since 1852 that a Democratic presidential candidate won Connecticut. Likewise, this was the first election in which a Republican presidential candidate won without Connecticut.\nTo date, this is the most recent presidential election in which the Democratic nominee carried the town of Hartland.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Connecticut\nReferences"
