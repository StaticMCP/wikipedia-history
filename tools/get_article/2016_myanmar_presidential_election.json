Members of the Assembly of the Union voted for the country's President, and two Vice-Presidents.\nThe elections were the second presidential elections held under the 2008 constitution.\nHtin Kyaw, Myint Swe, and Henry Van Thio were elected President, First Vice-President, and Second-Vice President respectively.\nBackground\nMyanmar, previously known as Burma, has been under a dictatorship for the majority of its independent history. First, under Ne Win and his Burma Socialist Programme Party, and then under a military junta. In 2007, large scale demonstrations took place during the Saffron Revolution, which was organized by the vast monastic community of Myanmar. The revolution was suppressed, but lead to political reforms and the 2008 constitution.\nIn the yearly 2010s, Myanmar transitioned into a state of semi-democracy, finally culminating in the 2015 elections, where democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi became State Counsellor, and her party the National League for Democracy won a landslide victory. This put the party in a very powerful position ahead of the presidential elections.\nElectoral system\nUnder the 2008 constitution, Myanmar has a President, and two Vice-Presidents. They are elected by the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, the national legislature.\nThe Pyidaungsu Hluttaw consists of two chambers, Pyithu Hluttaw, and Amyotha Hluttaw. Most seats are directly elected, but a quarter of the seats in both chambers are appointed by the Tatmadaw.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Chamber\n! Type\n!

The whole Pyidaungsu Hluttaw then votes, with all three nominees on the ballot together and each of the 664 MPs being entitled to one vote. The vote is a secret ballot. The candidate that receives the highest number of votes is President, the candidate with the second highest number of votes is 1st Vice-President, and the remaining candidate is 2nd Vice-President. This system guarantees the military at least one Vice-President.\nCandidates\nThe candidates were nominated on 11 March 2016.\nPyithu Hluttaw committee\nHtin Kyaw was nominated by the committee from Pyithu Hluttaw.
