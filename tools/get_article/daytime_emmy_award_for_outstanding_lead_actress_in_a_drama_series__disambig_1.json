It is given to honor an actress who has delivered an outstanding performance in a leading role while working within the daytime drama industry.\nThe 1st Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony was held in 1974, with Elizabeth Hubbard receiving the award for her role as Althea Davis on The Doctors. The award has undergone several name changes, originally honoring actresses in leading and supporting roles. Following the introduction of a new category in 1979, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, the award's name was altered to Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series, before changing once again, to its current title, years later. The awards ceremony was not aired on television in 1983 and 1984, having been criticized for voting integrity. In 1985, another category was introduced: Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series; one criterion for this category was altered, requiring all actresses to be aged 26 or above.\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 29 actresses. One Life to Live is the show with the most awarded actresses, with a total of eleven, including Erika Slezak and her record six wins. Susan Flannery and Kim Zimmer have since received four wins each. Susan Lucci has one win from 21 nominationsthe most nominations of any actress in the category. For her portrayal of Amanda Sinclair on The Young and the Restless, Mishael Morgan made Daytime Emmy history by winning the award in 2022, making her the first Black actress to receive this honor. This milestone follows Debbi Morgan's nomination in 2009, where she became the first Black woman nominated in the category. As of the 2025 ceremony, Nancy Lee Grahn is the most recent winner in this category, for her portrayal of Alexis Davis on General Hospital.\nWinners and nominees\nListed below are the winners of the award for each year, as well as the other nominees.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table key\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86; height:20px; width:20px\"|\n| Indicates the winner\n|}\nwas the first winner, for her role as Althea Davis on The Doctors.
