Duke, who was described by relatives as an \"anti-communist crusader\", eventually turned to making a living by off flying anti-Castro Cubans to U.S. exile for $1,000 a job. In May 1960, he was ambushed by police after touching down on Highway 15 west of Havana, and was killed after they opened fire as he attempted to return to the sky.\nReferences"
