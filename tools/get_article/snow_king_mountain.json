The mountain is Jackson's original 1936 ski hill, located on the southeast edge of the city, and was the first ski area in Wyoming. Locals sometimes refer to Snow King as \"The Town Hill,\" and it offers skiing, hiking, an alpine slide, and a planetarium.\nHistory\nIn 1936, the Civilian Conservation Corps created a switch-back horse and hiking trail to the top of the mountain and the trail became one of Snow King's first skiing racecourses. The Jackson Hole Ski Club was established in 1937, and two years later lift-served skiing began on Wyoming's first ski area with the addition of a  rope tow. While previously named Kelly's Hill or the town hill, it was officially named Snow King in 1938. The first chairlift was installed in 1946, a converted ore tram from Salida, Colorado that utilized single-chairs instead of ore cars. In the 1950s, the single-chairs were replaced with double chairs.\nIn 1978, The Rafferty double was constructed on the east slopes of the resort near the Snow King Hotel. A double chairlift was installed in 1981 and known as the Summit lift.\nIn the summer of 2014, after almost 35 years of service, the Rafferty Double chair was removed and replaced by a Doppelmayr quad chairlift going four hundred feet higher than the prior lift. The Summit lift was uninstalled in 2021 and replaced by a gondola lift. Manufactured by Leitner-Poma, each gondola car can ferry eight passengers from the base of the mountain to the summit.\nIn 2025, the hotel at the base of the mountain, Snow King Resort, was sold to Castle Peak Holdings for an undisclosed amount, purportedly around $84 million USD. There are plans to renovate the hotel and potentially expand the hotel by adding more wings to the building.\nAttractions\nOutside of the skiing, Snow King features several other attractions. The gondola is open year round, operating as a ski lift in the winter and a scenic transport in the summer months. In 2015, the Cowboy Coaster, a  alpine coaster opened. The coaster is open year round, and can reach speeds of up to  In 2022, a  long zipline opened that can reach speeds of up to . The resort also features a miniature golf course, an alpine slide, and a maze. Snow King Observatory and Planetarium opened at the summit in 2024.\nLifts\nThe resort features three chairlifts, one rope tow, three magic carpet lifts, and a gondola lift.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.snowkingmountain.com/ Snow King Mountain]\n* [https://snowkingmountain.com/mountain/master-plan/ the master plan]"
