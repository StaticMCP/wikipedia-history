Howard worked on mixing, recording and engineering, as well as studio installations. They had studios in New Orleans, Kingsway, Emila Court on St Charles Ave, and a Victorian mansion at 1305 Soniat St, Mexico, and in San Francisco.

He was nominated at the Canadian Juno awards for producer of the year. In 1994, Howard worked on post-production for Emmylou Harris's Wrecking Ball at the studio he shared with Lanois in San Francisco.\nHoward then opened a studio called the Teatro, in Oxnard, California, in an abandoned 1920s theatre. At this studio Howard and Lanois co-produced the soundtrack to the movie Slingblade, and Howard then produced Chris Whitley's Terra Incognita. In 1995, Howard co-produced with Ian Moore the latter's second studio album, Modernday Folklore.\nIn 1996, Bob Dylan began work with Howard and Lanois on Time Out of Mind at the Teatro, and recorded at Miami's Criteria Studios for a month before returning to the Teatro to finish recording the album. The record went on to win three Grammys, including Album of the Year. In Dylan's acceptance speech, he thanked Mark Howard, commenting that \"we got a particular sound on this record which you don't get every day\".\nThe Teatro studio in Oxnard, California, an abandoned theatre that Howard turned into a recording studio.\nIn 1997, Howard and Lanois recorded Willie Nelson's Teatro, named after the studio.
