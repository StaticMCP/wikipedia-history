This topology uses three insulated-gate field-effect transistors (IGFET) and eighteen diodes. The bidirectional switches (composed of four diodes and one IGFET circuit) are connected in a delta topology. The rectifier output does not require a divided DC-link circuit as required in the Vienna rectifier topology.\nSee also\n*Vienna rectifier\nReferences"
