The 56th Brigade was assigned to the 19th (Western) Division and served on the Western Front from 1915 and was disbanded after the war. The brigade saw service at the Battle of Loos in late 1915, and at during the Somme offensive, at Albert and Pozières and later at Messines in June 1917, Third Ypres and, in 1918, at Sambre, part of the Hundred Days Offensive.\nOrder of battle\n* 7th (Service) Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) (disbanded February 1918)\n* 7th (Service) Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment (disbanded February 1918)\n* 7th (Service) Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment (disbanded February 1918)\n* 7th (Service) Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) (disbanded February 1918)\n* 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (from 3 December 1915 to 19 December 1915)\n* 56th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 14 February 1916, moved to 19th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 14 February 1918)\n* 56th Trench Mortar Battery (formed 17 June 1916, broken up 5 February 1918, reformed 6 March 1918)\n* 9th (Service) Battalion, Cheshire Regiment (from February 1918)\n* 1/4th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry (from February 1918)\n* 8th (Service) Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment (from February 1918)\nCommanders\n* Brigadier-General B.

The brigade consisted of three Regular Army infantry battalions that had all seen service overseas: the 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers (SWB), which had fought in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, 2nd Battalion, Essex Regiment and 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, which both fought at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940.\nfile past a knocked out German Panther tank on a road near Tilly-sur-Seulles, France, 19 June 1944.]]\nThe 56th Brigade took part in the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944, as part of the Allied invasion of Normandy, where it formed the right flank of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division on Gold Beach. It remained attached to the 50th Division until 10 June, after which it was attached to the 7th Armoured Division until 12 June, then reverting to the 50th Division and came under command of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division in early August 1944. On 20 August the brigade was permanently attached to the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, then commanded by Major General Evelyn Barker, a decorated veteran of the Great War. Serving alongside the 56th Brigade in the division were the 146th and 147th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting divisional units. The brigade replaced the 70th Brigade, which was disbanded due to heavy losses.\nThe 56th Brigade took part in the Normandy landings, liberated Bayeux on 7 June leaving the town mainly intact. All its battalions were involved in the taking of Tilly-sur-Seulles with the 2nd Essex finally investing the town. Later actions were north of St Germain d'Ectot and the liberation of Thury-Harcourt in the Suisse Normande. It was prominent in the drive towards Le Havre and the 49th was one of the assault divisions taking the city in Operation Astonia in September 1944. Continuing to fight in Belgium at Poppel and then the Netherlands it was the assault brigade for the final assault on Arnhem in April 1945. The 56th served well, and ended the war in Germany. The division came mainly under command of First Canadian Army throughout the campaign.\nOrder of battle\n* 2nd Battalion, South Wales Borderers (until 27 April 1945)\n* 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment\n* 2nd Battalion, Essex Regiment\n* 7th (Merionethshire & Montgomeryshire) Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers (from 27 April 1945)\nCommanders\n* Brigadier E.C.

(The Brigade was named in memory and recognition of 56 Division of Second World War fame.) The Foot Guards Lieutenant Colonels therefore ceased to command their Regiments. The Brigade Headquarters, commanded first by Brigadier DH B-H Blundell, was made responsible for administration and training of all London District units.\nThe Gulabin sources gave the Deputy Commander London District and Brigade Commander, March 1985-May 1988 as Dermot H. Blundell-Hollinshead-Blundell.\nAntony Beevor's book Inside the British Army gave the formation date of the brigade as January 1987. Brigadier A G Ross, Scots Guards, was in command of the brigade when the 1992/93 training directive was issued. The brigade was disbanded in 1993.\nVictoria Cross recipients\n* Lieutenant Thomas Orde Lawder Wilkinson, 7th (Service) Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), First World War\n* Private James Miller, 7th (Service) Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), First World War\nFootnotes\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140504204634/http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/jscsc/jscsc-library/archives/operation-overlord/the-d-day-landings/CONF105_56InfBrigadeAdmOrd.pdf/view Administrative Order No. 1: 56th Brigade] - administrative orders issued in May 1944 in preparation for the Normandy landings"
