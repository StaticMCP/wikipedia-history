      "text": "# Light Novel Award\n\nThe  was a literary award handed out by the Japanese publisher Kadokawa Shoten for light novels, and was only held once in 2007. The novels which were applicable to receive the award were either published by Kadokawa Shoten under their Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko light novel label, or by three other publishing companies affiliated with Kadokawa Shoten in the Kadokawa Group—Enterbrain, Fujimi Shobo, and MediaWorks. The novels by Enterbrain were published under their Famitsu Bunko label; the novels by Fujimi Shobo were published under their Fujimi Fantasia Bunko or Fujimi Mystery Bunko labels; and the novels by MediaWorks were published under their Dengeki Bunko label (which encompasses their sub label Dengeki Game Bunko as well). There were five categories in the contest—romantic comedy, school setting, action, mystery, and novelization (for novels based on previously published material)—with four novels being picked for each category (one from each publisher) during the semi-final round. The final round picked one novel from each of the four listed in each category which became the winner in that given category. The winners were decided by readers of the novels themselves.\nPrize winners\n{|\n|valign=top|\n;Romantic comedy: Toradora!, Yuyuko Takemiya\n:;Runners-up\n::Goshūshō-sama Ninomiya-kun, Daisuke Suzuki\n::Kamisama Game, Shū Miyazaki\n::''Magician's Academy, Ichirō Sakaki\n;School setting: Chrome Shelled Regios, Shūsuke Amagi\n:;Runners-up\n::Andaka no Kaizōgaku, Akira\n::Asura Cryin', Gakuto Mikumo\n::Gakkō no Kaidan, Takaaki Kaima\n;Action: Rental Magica, Makoto Sanda\n:;Runners-up\n::Kōtetsu no Shiro Usagi Kishi Dan, Kō Maisaka\n::Rengoku no Escudo, Junichirō Takane\n::Toaru Majutsu no Index, Kazuma Kamachi\n|valign=top|\n;Mystery: Book Girl series, Mizuki Nomura\n:;Runners-up\n::Danshō no Grimm, Gakuto Coda\n::Makizoe Holic, Ryōta Azuma\n::Shi-No, Amane Kōzuki\n;Novelization: Monster Hunter (adapted from the video game), Yūkinrin\n:;Runners-up\n::Eureka Seven, Tomonori Zugihara\n::Gunparade Orchestra, Ryōsuke Sakaki\n::Karin Zōketsuki'', Tōru Kai\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/lightnovel-award/ Official website]"
