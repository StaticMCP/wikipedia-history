Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring about changes in what he sees as some of the greatest problems the world is facing today.\nThe Work of the People (a community of artists, storytellers, filmmakers, poets and theologians) created a music video for Webb's song A New Law which is available for viewing on their website.\nTo broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website www.freederekwebb.com, where it was available for download until December 1, 2006. Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nBand\n*Derek Webb&nbsp;– vocals, acoustic guitar, bells (tracks 3, 5, 8, 10), Mellotron (track 7)\n*Cason Cooley&nbsp;– piano, mellotron (tracks 3, 5, 7), bells (tracks 4, 6, 11), Rhodes piano (tracks 4 & 5), electric guitar (track 5)\n*Mark Polack&nbsp;– bass guitar\n*Will Sayles&nbsp;– drums, percussion\nAdditional musicians\n*Jordan Brooke Hamlin&nbsp;– French horn (tracks 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11), trumpet (tracks 4, 6, 10, 11)\n*David Henry&nbsp;– cello (tracks 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n*Sandra McCracken&nbsp;– vocals (track 9), acoustic guitar (track 5)\nTechnical\n* Derek Webb – producer, additional engineer, design concept, direction\n* Cason Cooley – producer\n* Shane D.
