The Clemengers' gift was made in 1991 and the first award was made in 1993. The final award was made in 2009, after which the award ended.\nThe award was based upon an artist's corpus of work and not upon a particular piece. The value of each prize varied, with the final, 2009 award being worth A$50,000.\nComplete List of Winners\n*1993 (inaugural) - Bea Maddock\n*1996 - Richard Larter\n*1999 - John Nixon\n*2003 - John Mawurndjul\n*2006 - Judy Watson\n*2009 (final) - Ah Xian\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080731102047/http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/clemenger2006/ Clemenger Award 2006 webpage at the NGV website]"
