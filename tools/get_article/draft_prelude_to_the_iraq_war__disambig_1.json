He first became aware of the significance of Iraq in February 2002, when Gen. Tommy Franks told him the Bush administration had made the decision to begin to de-emphasize Afghanistan in order to get ready for Iraq. In September, the Senate Intelligence Committee met with George Tenet, Director of the CIA, and Graham requested a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq. Tenet responded by saying \"We've never done a National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq, including its weapons of mass destruction.\" and resisted the request to provide one to Congress. Graham insisted \"This is the most important decision that we as members of Congress and that the people of America are likely to make in the foreseeable future. We want to have the best understanding of what it is we're about to get involved with.\" Tenet refused to do a report on the military or occupation phase, but reluctantly agreed to do a NIE on the weapons of mass destruction. Graham described the Senate Intelligence Committee meeting with Tenet as \"the turning point in our attitude towards Tenet and our understanding of how the intelligence community has become so submissive to the desires of the administration. The administration wasn't using intelligence to inform their judgment; they were using intelligence as part of a public relations campaign to justify their judgment.\"\nCongress voted to support the war based on the NIE Tenet provided in October 2002. However, the bipartisan \"Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Prewar Intelligence\" released on July 7, 2004, concluded that the key findings in the 2002 NIE either overstated, or were not supported by, the actual intelligence. The Senate report also found the US Intelligence Community to suffer from a \"broken corporate culture and poor management\" that resulted in a NIE that was completely wrong in almost every respect.\nSee also\n* Outline of the Iraq War\n* International reactions to the prelude to the Iraq War\n* Oil-for-Food Programme\n* Operation Northern Watch\n* Prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/iraq/ Frontline: \"The War Behind Closed Doors\"] PBS documentary on the neoconservative advocacy against Iraq\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/pentagon/ Frontline: \"Rumsfeld's War\"] PBS documentary on Donald Rumsfeld's tenure as Secretary of Defense under the Bush administration\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/ Frontline: \"The Dark Side\"] PBS documentary on Dick Cheney's remaking of the Executive and infighting leading up to the war in Iraq\n* [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/bushswar/ Frontline: \"Bush's War\"] PBS documentary on the Bush administration's policies in the War on Terror\n* \"[https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/iraq_wmd_2004/index.html Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq’s WMD] \".
