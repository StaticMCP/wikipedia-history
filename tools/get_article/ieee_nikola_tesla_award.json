      "text": "# IEEE Nikola Tesla Award\n\n}}\nThe IEEE Nikola Tesla Award is a Technical Field Award given annually to an individual or team that has made an outstanding contribution to the generation or utilization of electric power. It is awarded by the Board of Directors of the IEEE. The award is named in honor of Nikola Tesla.  This award may be presented to an individual or a team.\nThe award was established in 1975, and its first recipient was Leon T. Rosenberg, who was given the award in 1976 \"for his half-century of development and design of large steam turbine driven generators and his important contributions to literature.\" The actual award is a plaque and honorarium.\nRecipients\nSource\n* 2024 - Aldo Boglieltti, Professor, Department of Energy, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy\n*: For contributions to the magnetic and thermal modeling, design, and characterization of electrical machines.\n* 2023 - Kiruba S.
