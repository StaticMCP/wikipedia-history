Ward entered active duty with the United States Army's 117th Regiment from the Tennessee National Guard during World War I. On October 8, 1918, during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, Ward's company was stopped near Estrées, France by a German machine gun position. Ward and Sergeant James Ernest Karnes, deciding they had \"had all they could take\" of this situation, fixed bayonets, charged and captured the position. This freed their company to advance against German lines in the last major offensive of the war. Both men received the Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism in this action.\nCalvin Ward died on December 15, 1967, and is buried in Glenwood Cemetery, Bristol, Sullivan County, Tennessee.\nMedals\nMilitary records from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Portugal attribute the following medals to Calvin John Ward:\nMedal of Honor,\nBritish Distinguished Conduct Medal 31JAN1919,\nFrench Croix de Guerre w/ Palm 13APR1919,\nFrench Medaille Militaire 5MAY1919,\nMontenegrin Medaille de Bravoure w/ Palm 25JUN1919,\nPortuguese Cruz de Gurra 3rd Class 6DEC1921,\nItalian Croce di Guerra 9DEC1921,\nBelgian Decoration,\nRussian Decoration\nMedal of Honor Citation\nRank and organization: Private, U.S. Army, Company D, 117th Infantry, 30th Division.
