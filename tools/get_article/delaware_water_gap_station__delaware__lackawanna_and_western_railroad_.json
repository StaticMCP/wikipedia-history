Service to Delaware Water Gap along what became known as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad started on May 13, 1856. The station structure was designed by architect Frank J. Nies and built in 1903. It consists of two separate one-story brick buildings, a station house and freight house, joined by a common concrete platform and slate covered hipped roof.  It is reflective of the Late Victorian style.  The station closed to passenger service in March 1953, and was sold to the Borough in 1958. It is said to sit just outside Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, though it appears within the area's boundary on maps.\nThe station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 2002.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Monroe County, Pennsylvania\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
