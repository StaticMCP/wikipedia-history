There are actually three separate censuses in the United Kingdom – in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland – although they are often co-ordinated. From 1821 to 1911, the census included the whole of Ireland.\nThere have only been three occasions in Great Britain where the census has not been decennial: There was no census in 1941 owing to the Second World War; a mini-census using a ten per cent sample of the population was conducted on 24 April 1966; and the planned Scottish 2021 census was delayed to 2022 owing to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. No census was held in Ireland in 1921, as a consequence of the Irish War of Independence; instead, Northern Ireland carried out a census in 1926, the first there for fifteen years.}} No census was carried out in Northern Ireland in 1931, but one was carried out in 1937.\nPast censuses\nPublished censuses\nThe census records which have been published relate to the occupants of each household, as enumerated for the dates given below:\n*United Kingdom Census 1801 – Tuesday, 10 March\n*United Kingdom Census 1811 – Monday, 27 May\n*United Kingdom Census 1821 – Monday, 28 May\n*United Kingdom Census 1831 – Monday, 30 May\n*1841 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 6 June\n*1851 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 30 March\n*1861 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 7 April\n*1871 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 2 April\n*1881 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 3 April\n*1891 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 5 April\n*1901 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 31 March\n*1911 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 2 April\n*1921 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 19 June\n*National Registration Act 1939 – Friday, 29 September Second World War\nUnpublished censuses\nUnder the 100-year closure rule established after the 1911 census was taken, only summary results for censuses after 1939though with significant statistical detailare published in the months and the last set of results is provisionally (as of May 2023) predicted to be published in October or November 2023.}} following the enumeration dates given below; the full information (individual household entries) in later censuses will not be released until the dates stated, a century after each later census was conducted.\n*1926 Northern Ireland Census – Sunday, 18 April: The census returns were not transferred to the Public Record Office in Northern Ireland, and are believed to have been destroyed without authorisation, possibly as part of a World War II waste-paper campaign.\n*1931 United Kingdom census – Sunday, 26 April: carried out in England, Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland.
