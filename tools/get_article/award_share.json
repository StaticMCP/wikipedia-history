      "text": "# Award share\n\nAn award share is a statistic in baseball, basketball and other sports.  It is usually used as part of a formula to determine if a player will likely be elected to the Hall of Fame in his particular sport. It is calculated by the number of points a player received for a particular award over the total points of all first-place votes.  For example, in the 2000 NBA MVP race, Shaquille O'Neal received every first place vote but one (120 votes at ten points each), and one second place vote (seven points), and therefore his MVP award share for that season is 0.998 (1207/1210 max points). Cumulative award shares for a career are calculated by adding up all the award shares a particular player got throughout his career.\nCareer leaders\nBaseball MVP Award Shares\n# Barry Bonds (9.30)\n# Stan Musial (6.96)\n# Albert Pujols (6.91)\n# Mike Trout (6.53)\n# Ted Williams (6.43)\n# Willie Mays (5.94)\n# Mickey Mantle (5.79)\n# Hank Aaron (5.45)\n# Lou Gehrig (5.45)\n# Joe DiMaggio (5.45)\nCy Young Award Winner Shares\n# Roger Clemens (7.66)\n# Randy Johnson (6.50)\n# Justin Verlander (5.21)\n# Greg Maddux (4.92)\n# Max Scherzer (4.61)\n# Clayton Kershaw (4.58)\n# Steve Carlton (4.29)\n# Pedro Martinez (4.26)\n# Tom Seaver (3.85)\n# Jim Palmer (3.57)\nBasketball MVP Award Shares\n, who won five MVP awards, has the second most NBA MVP Award shares]]\n# LeBron James (8.831)\n# Michael Jordan (8.115)\n# Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (6.105)\n# Larry Bird (5.612)\n# Magic Johnson (5.104)\n# Bill Russell (4.852)\n# Nikola Jokić (4.460)\n# Wilt Chamberlain (4.423)\n# Shaquille O'Neal (4.380)\n# Karl Malone (4.296)\nWNBA MVP Award Shares\n# Lisa Leslie (5.614)\n# Tamika Catchings (4.844)\n# Lauren Jackson (4.698)\n# Breanna Stewart (3.973)\n# Candace Parker (3.913)\n# A'ja Wilson (3.846)\n# Diana Taurasi (3.674)\n# Elena Delle Donne (3.381)\n# Tina Charles (3.375)\n# Sheryl Swoopes (3.260)\nReferences"
