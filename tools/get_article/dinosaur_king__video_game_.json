The player has a limited amount of pick uses, and uncovering the entire fossil gives the player a rarer dinosaur than they would have usually gotten.\n| IGN = 6.6/10\n| JXV = 14/20\n| NLife =\n| NWR = 8/10\n| PALGN = 5/10\n| PG =\n}}\nThe game received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.
