For many years he practised as a solicitor in Brecon. The death of his father gave him an additional degree of financial security, and following his appointment as deputy-registrar of the archdeaconry of Brecon, he sold his business in 1808 to have time to write.\nJones married Mary Price in 1783. He died on 15 January 1812, and was buried in the church of Llangammarch; his widow died on 22 July 1828.\nWorks\nJones's History of the County of Brecknock was published in two volumes in Brecon in 1805 and 1809. After his death it was reprinted in one volume in 1898. From 1909 to 1930 it was reprinted in four volumes which were considerably enlarged by Joseph Bailey, 1st Baron Glanusk and which were named the Glanusk editions.\nJones also published antiquarian communications in magazines, two papers in the Cambrian Register in 1795 and 1796, and another in Archaeologia, journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London, in 1814. He planned to write a history of Radnorshire which, however, never materialised; and he began a translation of Ellis Wynne's romance Gweledigaethau y Bardd Cwsg (Visions of the Sleeping Bard).\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n;Attribution"
