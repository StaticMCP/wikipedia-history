Data for total speakers were people aged 15+ who were literate in English, so the corresponding percentage was calculated through dividing the number by population aged 15+ (179,302). On the other hand, number of native speakers included anyone aged 3+, so the corresponding percentage is calculated by dividing it by total population aged 3 or above (239,839).

Likewise, the total number of native English speakers adds up to around 410,000,000. This implies that there are approximately 1,020,000,000 people who speak English as an additional language.\nSee also\n* EF English Proficiency Index\n* English medium education\n* English-speaking world\n* List of countries and territories where English is an official language\n* World Englishes\n* English-based creole languages\nNon-English speaking populations by language:\n* Arabophone\n* Bengali language\n* Francophone\n* Geographical distribution of Dutch speakers\n* Geographical distribution of German speakers\n* Hispanophone\n* List of countries and territories where Hindustani is an official language\n* List of countries and territories where Persian is an official language\n* List of countries where Tamil is an official language\n* Lusophone\n* Malay language\n* Persophone\n* Russophone\n* Sinophone\n* Swahili language\n* List of link languages\nNon-English speaking populations by language, historical:\n* Latin language\n* Mobilian trade language\n* Phonecian language\n* Sanskritisation (linguistics)\nNon-English speaking populations by country:\n* Indosphere\nLinguistic topics:\n* Dialect continuum\n* Geolinguistics\n* Language geography\n* Link language\nNotes\nReferences\n* [http://www.wizmantra.org WizMantra Online]\n* [https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/Euromonitor%20report%20final%20July%202012.pdf  Teachingenglish.org.uk]\n*\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Eurobarometer report – Europeans and their languages, February 2006 (pdf)].
