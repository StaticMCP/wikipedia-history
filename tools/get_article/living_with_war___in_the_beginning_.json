      "text": "# Living with War: \"In the Beginning\"\n\n}}\nLiving with War: \"In the Beginning\" is a remix album by Neil Young, first released on iTunes on November 7, 2006. It is a stripped-down version of Young's 2006 album Living with War. The original title of this particular CD/DVD release, according to a press release, was called Living with War – Raw. However, the title changed when the album was finally released.\nThe album includes first mixes of the live trio recordings, made the day of recording, and was made available via digital download on iTunes on Election Day, November 7, 2006. Also available on iTunes that day were four videos directed by Neil Young of songs from the album: \"After the Garden\", \"Families\", \"Lookin' for a Leader\" and \"America the Beautiful\".\nIn a special CD/DVD limited-edition package, available on Reprise Records in stores on December 19, 2006, the set included videos directed by Young of every song on the album. The videos used a wide range of visual sources, both from the Iraq War as well as demonstrations in the United States, and Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth.\nOn the \"Raw\" version of the album, the sound is straight-from-the-source, captured live in the studio exactly the way it was recorded, without the backing instrumentation and choral accompaniment found on the original release.\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Neil Young, and © 2006, Silver Fiddle Music.\nPersonnel\n* Neil Young – guitars, vocal\n* Rick Rosas – bass\n* Chad Cromwell – drums\n* Tom Bray – trumpet\nAdditional roles\n* Niko Bolas – producer, mixing\n* L.
