Traditionally used with dokha, a finely ground mixture of tobacco and spices]]\n, with handcrafted metal head and mouthpiece; traditionally used with kizami, a finely shredded Japanese tobacco product]]\nA one-hitter (also oney, bat, tay, oney bat, or taster) is typically a slender pipe with a screened narrow bowl designed for a single inhalation, or \"hit\", of smoke or vapor from a small serving (about 0.1-0.3g) of cannabis flower, tobacco leaf or other dry, sifted herbal preparation (e.g Dokha).  It is distinguished from western-style large-bowl pipes designed for strong tobaccos that are burned hot and tasted but not inhaled.  Instead, by properly distancing a lighter flame below the opening, inhalant users operate at vaporization temperatures, minimizing combustion waste and toxicity.\nTraditional national varieties of one-hitter pipes have included Native American calumet (\"peace pipe\"), kiseru (Japan), midwakh (Middle East), sebsi (Morocco) and some narrow chillums (Nepal, India, Jamaica).\nA one-hitter has been considered drug paraphernalia in certain regions.\nDugout\n(with end-to-end channel)]]\nBrands of cigarette-sized one hitters for inconspicuous public use are marketed with a rectangular (or sometimes cylindrical) wooden case, known as a \"dugout\", with two compartments, the larger to store a stash of herb or tobacco and a narrower, cylindrical hole to store the \"bat\" or pipe.\nModern adaptations from craft-centric companies use fine and rare woods, bone, acrylic, aluminum, steel, titanium, other metals or plastics, adding features such as grinders, poker storage or lighter chambers. Carried in a shirt pocket, they are the tangible \"replacement\" for a pack of cigarettes when one is eliminating a smoking habit.\nSee also\n* Cannabis smoking\n* Chillum (pipe)\n* Hashish\n* Kiseru\n* Midwakh\n* Sebsi\n* Smoking cessation\n* Vaporizer (inhalation device)\nReferences"
