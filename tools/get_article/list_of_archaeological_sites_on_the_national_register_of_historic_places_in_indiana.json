More than fifty different sites in Indiana are listed under this criterion, including both Native American and European sites, and two others were once listed but have been removed.  This list includes all properties in Indiana that qualify under this criterion.\nCurrent listings\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n! |\n! width = 18% | Landmark name\n! width = 8% class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! |Location\n! width = 8% |County\n! width = 12% |Culture\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Comments\n|--\n!  | 1\n| Angel Mounds\n|\n| Knight Township: 8 miles southeast of Evansville in Angel Mounds State Memorial\n| Vanderburgh\n| Mississippian: Angel\n|\n|--\n!  | 2\n| Archeological Sites 12Ma648 and 12Ma649\n|\n| Lawrence Township: atop a hill above Fall Creek in the northwestern corner of Fort Harrison State Park\n| Marion\n| Multiple: Early Archaic through Late Woodland, and European\n|\n|--\n!  | 3\n| Ashworth Archaeological Site (12 Po 7)\n|\n| Point Township: eastern side of State Road 69, about  north of Hovey Lake\n| Posey\n| Mississippian: Caborn-Welborn\n|\n|--\n!  | 4\n| Bono Archaeological Site (12 Lr 194)\n|\n| Bono Township: on a bluff above the White River, ½ mile west of the riverbank and 1 mile north of Bono\n| Lawrence\n| Late Archaic\n|\n|--\n!  | 5\n| Castor Farm Site\n|\n| White River Township: river bottoms below the Strawtown Enclosure\n| Hamilton\n| Late Woodland: Oliver, Younge, and Western Basin\n|\n|--\n!  | 6\n| Chrysler Enclosure\n|\n| New Castle: western side of Ross St. at Chrysler High School\n| Henry\n| Woodland: Adena\n|\n|--\n!  | 7\n| Collier Lodge Site\n|\n| Pleasant Township: 1099 Baum's Bridge Rd., southwest of Kouts\n| Porter\n| Multiple: Early Archaic through Upper Mississippian, and European\n|\n|--\n!  | 8\n| Daugherty-Monroe Archaeological Site (12SU13)\n|\n| Turman Township: northern half of Section 21 Town 8 North Range 11 West\n| Sullivan\n| Late Woodland: Allison-Lamotte\n|\n|--\n!  | 9\n| Delphi Lime Kilns\n|\n| Deer Creek Township: north-northwest of Delphi\n| Carroll\n| Historic: European\n|\n|--\n!  | 10\n| Ellerbusch Archeological Site (12W56)\n|\n| Ohio Township: atop the bluff northwest of the junction of State Road 662 and Ellerbursch Rd., west of Newburgh\n| Warrick\n| Mississippian: Angel\n|\n|--\n!  | 11\n| Ennis Archaeological Site (12 OW 229)\n|\n| Clay and Richland Townships: along the Monroe/Owen county line on the southern edge of the Flatwoods region, west of Ellettsville\n| Monroe and Owen\n| Archaic\n|\n|--\n!  | 12\n| Epsilon II Archeological Site (12MO133)\n|\n| Polk Township: on the Lake Monroe shoreline at Ransburg Scout Reservation, southeast of Bloomington\n| Monroe\n| Late Archaic\n|\n|--\n!  | 13\n| Fort Knox II Site\n|\n| Vincennes: 3 miles north of downtown Vincennes\n| Knox\n| Historic: European\n|\n|--\n!  | 14\n| Fort Ouiatenon\n|\n| Wabash Township: along River Rd. and the Wabash River, west of the Purdue University Airport and west of Lafayette\n| Tippecanoe\n| Historic: European\n|\n|--\n!  | 15\n| Fudge Site\n|\n| White River Township: immediately southwest of the confluence of Sugar Creek and the White River, northwest of Winchester\n| Randolph\n| Woodland: Adena and Hopewell\n|\n|--\n!  | 16\n| Glendale Ridge Archaeological Site (12 Da 86)\n|\n| Harrison Township: above the White River in the Glendale State Fish and Wildlife Area, southeast of Hudsonville\n| Daviess\n| Archaic: Riverton\n|\n|--\n!  | 17\n| Francis Godfroy Cemetery\n|\n| Butler Township: State Road 124, east of Peru\n| Miami\n| Historic: Miami\n|\n|--\n!  | 18\n| Hovey Lake Archaeological District\n|\n| Point Township: between Hovey Lake and the Ohio River in the Hovey Lake Fish and Wildlife Area\n| Posey\n| Mississippian: Caborn-Welborn\n|\n|--\n!  | 19\n| Mitchell P.
