The role involves providing expert counsel on matters related to warrant officer management, training, education, and policies, while also supporting broader Army strategic goals.\nThe post was announced by CSA GEN Raymond T. Odierno on March 14, 2014, wherein CW5 David Williams was established as the first ARSTAF SWO. Since 2014, the Department of the Army has maintained a senior warrant officer position with various titles, such as Army Staff Senior Warrant Officer (ARSTAFF SWO) and Senior Warrant Officer Advisor to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army (SWOA2CSA). On July 10, 2024, this role was officially named the Chief Warrant Officer of the Army (CWA), solidifying its importance as the highest-ranking warrant officer role in the Army and an integral member of the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Army.\nThe Chief Warrant Officer of the Army's duties include advising principal officials on issues related to talent management, training, education, doctrine, policies, quality of life, and other Army matters, with a focus on the needs and development of warrant officers. Additionally, the CWA chairs the Army Warrant Officer Council (ARWOC) and works collaboratively with Army staff, agencies, and personnel to support and advance the Army's strategic initiatives.\nUnlike the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman and the various services' senior enlisted advisors, the CWA does not wear a unique rank insignia; instead, the CWA wears the \"chief warrant officer 5\" rank insignia – a single silver bar with a black line running lengthwise down the center.\nFile:US-Army-CW5.svg|CW5 and CWA insignia\nList of officeholders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2|\n! rowspan=2| Portrait\n! rowspan=2| Name\n! colspan=3| Term of office\n! rowspan=2|\n|-\n!
