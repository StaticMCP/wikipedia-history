It was released on February 5, 2021, by Tapete Records.\nCritical reception\nSongs of Love and Revolution was met with \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 80 based on 5 reviews.\nWriting for AllMusic, Fred Thomas explained: \"Twelfth studio album Songs of Love & Revolution continues the group's fixation with noise-dazzled psychedelic drone rock, but the production is clearer and the songs hit with direct impact. These nine songs are some of the most neatly rendered of the band's post-2010 output, but lose none of their mind-bending effect in the production upgrade. If anything, the album finds the Telescopes delivering their messages of self-discovery and cosmic love louder than ever.\" Tim Sentz of Beats Per Minute said: \"Songs of Love and Revolution, the band’s 12th album, comes after a decade of reinvention and experimentation. All the arrangements on their latest take influence from their 2010s material, but this time around every element coexists with one another, creating a sublime noise bath. Songs of Love and Revolution finds a home, a warm center, that crossroads between shoegaze, noise rock, ambient fuzz, and believe it or not – pop. In fact, this could be Lawrie’s most accessible album to date, and that’s taking into account Hidden Fields closeted pop.\" In a review for Classic Rock, True Everett gave the release a four out of five stars, describing the album as \"hypnotic, breathtaking and quite, quite beautiful.\"\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Chart performance for Songs of Love and Revolution\n|-\n!
