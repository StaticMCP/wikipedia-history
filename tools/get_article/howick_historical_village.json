It is a recreation of a New Zealand colonial village using surviving buildings from the surrounding area. Despite its name, the Village is actually located in the suburb of Pakuranga.\nVillage history\nThe village originally used the name Howick Colonial Village. It was built by the Howick Historical Society on land gifted by the Manukau City Council.\nThe development and operation of the village was funded from admission fees, income generated from events and bookings, donations, plus some funding from The Howick Local Board.\nThe Village contains fencible cottages, a mission house, a court house, and an old shop.\nSince 2016, the village has been used as a set to film for the YouTube group Viva La Dirt League.\nOn 26 May 2020, the village reported that it had suffered serious financial difficulties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, had cut staff, and was actively seeking financial support from Auckland Council and other agencies.\nGovernance\nThe village is owned and operated by the Howick & Districts Historical Society Incorporated, which is a registered charity.\nAs an incorporated society, any individual can become a member on payment of an annual subscription. Members elect a board each year at the annual general meeting. The board consists of a president, secretary, treasurer and up to seven members.\nVisiting\nThe village is open to the public every day of the year (except Christmas Day, New Year's Day, and Good Friday) from 10am-4pm (last entry at 3pm). Live Days are held periodically, when costumed volunteers re-enact daily life in Victorian New Zealand times.\nSchool groups continue to visit the Museum regularly as part of their LEOTC (Learning Experience Outside The Classroom) studies. Weddings and other private celebrations are regularly held at the village using the church for ceremonies and the historic Bell House. The village is also offered as a film shoot location.\nRestoration projects\nOver the years, a number of restoration projects have taken place throughout the village. These buildings are timber framed and require significant ongoing work to protect and preserve them.\nIn 2016, a project was commenced to restore Sergeant Ford's Fencible cottage. This project was started with the support of the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board. During the project, further deterioration of the foundation was found, extending the cost of the project by $30,000 and causing significant financial difficulties for the village. The village needed to source additional support in order to prevent stress on the Society's financial reserves, and the project was ultimately rescued with support from the Stevenson Village Trust.\nIn 2019, the large Pakuranga school house was restored with funding provided by lotteries commission. Significant work by a team of contractors and volunteers completed this vital weather proofing work which included repairs to the windows and weatherboards.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.historicalvillage.org.nz/ Howick Historical Village]\n*[https://ehive.com/collections/3000/howick-historical-village The collections of Howick Historical Village]"
