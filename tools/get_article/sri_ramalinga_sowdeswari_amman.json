Her other names are Banashankari, Renugadevi, Chandi, Chowdamba, and Choodambigai.\nLegend\nAccording to the Devanga Purana, the sage Devala is regarded to be the progenitor of the Devanga community.  An incarnation of Manu, he is believed to have emerged from the third eye of Shiva to create clothing, and to teach weaving to the world. When Devala returned after obtaining threads from Vishnu, a group of five rakshasas, Vajramushti, Dhoomravakra, Dhoomratchasa, Chithrasena, and Panchasena, attacked him at midnight. In the dark, the power of the rakshasas was overwhelming. Devala attempted to fight them off by using Vishnu's Sudarshana Chakra, but failed, and finally prayed for Shakti to protect him. Shakti appeared in light and glory, wearing a bright full crown, holding a trident and other weapons in her hand while mounted on a lion. She killed the rakshasas; their blood was white, black, red, green, and yellow. Devala soaked his threads in the rakshasas's colorful blood. Shakti was offered the name Sowdeshwari or Chowdeshwari, literally meaning, 'the goddess of brightness'. Sowdeshwari advised Devala to worship her during every new moon (Amavashya).\nLiterature\nAccording to the Ramayana, Rama, the seventh avatar of the Vishnu, prayed to the god Shiva to absolve him of the sin of killing a Brahmin, committed during the war against the rakshasa king Ravana (who was also a Brahmin, son of a rishi) in Lanka. Rama wanted to have a large lingam to worship Shiva. He directed Hanuman, the lieutenant of his army, to bring a lingam from the Himalayas. When Hanuman was delayed in bringing the lingam, the goddess Sita built a small lingam out of the sand available in the seashore, which is believed to be the lingam in the temple's sanctum.\nAccording to the community's tradition, all of them decided to give the lingam brought by Hanuman to a great rishi, and they choose Devala. Devala bought the lingam and named it as Ramalingam, as it was given by Rama. From that day, he worshipped Ramalingam along with Sowdeshwari, and hence Sowdeshwari was called Ramalinga Sowdeshwari.\nWorship\nRituals\nThe pooja rituals for Sri Ramalinga Sowdeshwari Amman are a mixture of the culture of North and South India. The celebrants build a small cart-like building using jaggery, roof it with sugarcane and use Betel leaf for decoration. A special turmeric called pandaram is offered as Prasāda for the deities. The Devanga people perform all their rituals by themselves.\nAlagu seva\nThis ritual derives from the story that King Devadas, the seventh incarnation of Devala, built a beautiful temple for Sowdeshwari. He invited Lord Shiva and Parvathi from Srisailam to the temple but on the way Parvathi disappeared in the water as Devadas broke his promise. Devadas and his soldiers then wounded themselves with swords and suddenly the goddess appeared and joined them. The alagu seva ritual commemorates this event and invokes Sowdeshwari Amman. It is performed only by the Devanga people. The holy turmeric mixture, pandaram, is applied to the wounds to protect them from infection. The celebrants, called veerakumars, strike their bare chests with holy swords in a ritual dance. The ritual is also called alagu seva or katthi haakkadhu.\nJagajathara Dhoddabba\nJagajathara Dhoddabba is a five-day festival celebrated for Sri Ramalinga Sowdeshwari Amman.\nThe fourth day of the festival is dedicated to the goddess Gundam – \"Kappelaaaru\" clan goddess will be revered for Gundam.\nFestivals\n* Devanga new year: Those who follow the calendar of moon's rotation celebrate their new year on the day of Ugadi.
