The operation they performed in support of the Incheon Landing was a brilliant one and worthy of the highest commendation. The valor and sacrifice of its members will always be a shining example for the youth of Korea. Please extend to its members my heartiest greetings and affectionate regards. I shall always remember them as loyal and devoted comrades-in-arms.\nWith best wishes, Most sincerely,\nDouglas MacArthur\nMemorial\nSince 1960, comrade club had a memorial service.\nOn July 14 1980, the surviving Independent 1st Guerrilla Battalion formed the Jangsa Landing Operation Guerrilla Comrades Association.
