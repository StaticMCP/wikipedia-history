It was fought on 6 May 1848, when the King of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, sent the I Corps of the Sardinian army to assault the fortified positions held before the walls of Verona by the Austrian army under field marshal Josef Radetzky.  The Austrian army, though outnumbered, managed to withstand the attack and hold their positions. The battle is named after the Santa Lucia district of Verona. Franz Joseph (then only 17 years old) assisted in the battle.\nBackground\nScope of hostilities\nOn 18 March 1848, the city of Milan began an insurrection against the Austrian Empire known later as the Five Days of Milan.  The commander of the Lombard–Venetian army, field marshal Josef Radetzky, was unsure how to quell it and was forced to abandon the fierce fighting of the city.  At the same time, the garrisons of Como and several other cities in Lombardy–Venetia defected to the insurgents.\nBattle of Pastrengo\nAustrian strategic weakness\nRadetzky's impasse\nAssembled inside Verona there was still a considerable force, protected by valid fortifications: however, Austrian troops were demotivated after the first defeats (excepting the victory of 11 April over ill-equipped Lombard volunteers nearly Castelnuovo Castelnuovo del Garda, followed by the killings of nearly 113 civilians).\nIn addition, the possibility of receiving help from General Nugent's troops through Isonzo was barricaded by the presence of Italian rebels in Palmanova, Osoppo and Venice.\nTo make Radetzky situation even worse, political situation after repression of Austrian Revolution led many observers to doubt about the field-marshal's capacity in maintaining order, and he was labeled as a conservative monarchist by public liberal opinion.\nAdvance\nAdvance begins on 6 May, hampered by Sardinians' little knowledge of territory, and only the central column reached enemy (while on right, Bava divisions lost contact with the rest of Sardinian army).\nReferences"
