It was a decisive victory for Satyashraya, who completely destroyed all Chola attempts to invade Kalyani until the reign of Rajadhiraja I.\nBackground\nDuring the early 11th century, the Chola dynasty of Thanjavur was on the ascendant. The Chola influence in the eastern Deccan ruled by the Chalukyas of Vengi (the Eastern Chalukyas) was on the rise. With the help of the Cholas, Saktivarman had defeated Jata-Choda Bhima and gained control of the Vengi kingdom. The rise of Chola influence in the east was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas. Around c.1006 - 1007, a general of Satyashraya named Bayalnambi burnt the forts at Dhanyakataka (or Dharanikota) and Yanamandala. With these victories, Satyashraya was able to  establish himself temporarily at Chebrolu in the modern Guntur district.\nBut these early victories were temporary. The Chola King Rajaraja I mounted a two-pronged counter-attack. A large Chola army led by prince Rajendra Chola invaded and captured Donur in the Bijapur region, Banavasi, parts of the Raichur Doab (called Iditurainnadu), Unkal near modern Hubli, and Kudalasangama in modern Bagalkot district. However, Satyashraya at last reconquered these territories after defeating Rajendra Chola according to Hottur inscriptions which have also been noted by historians Suryanath Kamath  and R.C. Mujamdar. Emperor Satyashraya defeated Rajendra Chola in Chebrolu and captured it.\nAn inscription dated 1005 AD found at Yelesirur (Dharwad district) says that Satyashraya was in Shriparvata (Srisailam in Kurnool) in connection with the campaign against the Cholas and had enlisted the help of Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi in his wars against the Cholas. Satyashraya fought against Raja Raja Chola in the latter's third campaign. Satyashraya retaliated by invading the Vengi country in 1006 AD and placed Saktivarman on the throne of Vengi.\nBattle\nAfter all of these conflicts, Satyashraya marched against a Chola army led by Rajendra Chola sent by Rajaraja I to defeat the Kalyani Chalukyas. However, in the battle, Satyashraya was victorious, and repulsed the Chola invasion once more.\nAftermath\nAlthough this settled several major conflicts, this did not prevent further invasions. The two forces would again fight at the battle of Chebrolu. The Cholas would then again invade the Western Chalukyas during the reign of Chalukya emperor Jayasimha but in the end would again be defeated along with the rest of the coalition at the Battle of the Godavari river\nSee also\n* Battle of Chebrolu\n* Battle of the Godavari river\n* Battle of Donur\nReferences"
