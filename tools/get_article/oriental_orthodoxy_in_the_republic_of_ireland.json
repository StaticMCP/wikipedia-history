Before the beginning of the 20th century, the presence of Oriental Orthodox Christianity in Ireland was minor, gradually increasing only in the second half of the century with immigration, mainly from the region of Middle East and India. Today, it is a growing community, well integrated into Irish society.\nAdherents Oriental Orthodoxy in Ireland are largely of Indian origin, and they belong to the jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Church and its main Indian branches: Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church and Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. A significant proportion of them are hospital employees.  An important centre of activity is St. Gregorios' Syrian Orthodox Church in Arran Quay.\nOther Oriental Orthodox communities in Ireland are:\n* The Coptic Orthodox Church, that also has a growing presence in the country.\n* The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church in Dublin.\nFirst established in 1993, St. Mary's and St. Demiana Coptic Church in Bray, Co. Wicklow serves both the Coptic and Ethiopian Orthodox communities.\nIn Drumcondra in Dublin, there is St.Maximus & St. Domatius Coptic Orthodox church.\nSee also\n* Christianity in Ireland\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://stmaryswaterford.com St.Mary's Syrian Orthodox Church, Waterford, Ireland,  Fr.
