The film is jointly produced as a collaboration between Funke Ayotunde Akindele Network (FAAN) and FilmOne Studios. The film had its theatrical release on 16 December 2022 and opened to extremely positive reviews from critics. The film became a huge box office success.\nPlot\nYejide runs the most patronized buka (stall) in Otanwa community's \"Buka Street\" with help from her mother Asake and her children. However, her step-sister and archenemy Awele buys the neighbouring shop one day and starts competing. Their rivalry dates back to before their childhood; their mothers, Asake and Ezinne, both married to  their father Meduka, were jealous and conflicted with each other, and this carried on to their children.\nAt first, Awele fails to attract customers away from Yejide's buka, so she turns to sabotage: she sends her younger twins Kaira and Kaiso to lock Asake in Maduka's house so she can't make her stews. This works and people flock to Awele's restaurant instead, starting a series of retaliatory acts where Awele and Yejide try to curry favor in the town and use their children for their own selfish interest to attack each other's buka by planting rats and cockroaches. Meanwhile, they lie to the rest of the family that Awele's oldest daughter Ifunnaya and Yejide's son Ademide are going to America and Canada respectively. In fact, they both went to Lagos, where they end up meeting and helping each other escape their problems despite the rivalry before returning to Otanwa.\nThings go too far when Yejide's daughter Fadekemi replaces the kerosene with petrol at Awele's buka without her mother's knowledge, causing the shop to burn and making Yejide question the rivalry despite Asake's continued zeal. Meanwhile, Ezinne, who has been getting sicker, expresses regret for stoking the rivalry and dies after asking Awele to stop the conflict. Despite this, the two utilize differing spiritual paths to try to take the other down, but end up failing.\nA prison break occurs nearby, terrorizing the town as the inmates destroy and rob the shops on Buka Street but also allowing Yejide's husband Lanshile, who took the fall for Yejide after she killed his rival in self-defence and was held for years without trial, to escape. At first, their children, who don't know the truth, resent his arrival, particularly as Ademide was affected by the stigma of being his son and was appointed to perform at the youth carnival. However, they reconcile after Yejide reveals the actual events. At the carnival, the other escapees cause a stampede; Ademide rescues Ifunnaya and takes her to Lanshile's hideout to recover as it is the closest option. Awele finds them and calls the youth organizers, who come ready to mete out vigilante justice. However, the children and Yejide convince her to end the rivalry and she ultimately covers for Lanshile, ending the film with his escape.\nCast\n* Funke Akindele as Yejide\n* Mercy Johnson as Awele\n* Sola Sobowale as Asake\n* Tina Mba as Ezinne\n* Nkem Owoh as Maduka\n* Femi Jacobs as Lanshile\n* Kelvin Ikeduba as Chukwuemka\n* Sani Musa Danja as Kazeem\n* Bimbo Ademoye as Young Asake\n* Uche Obunse as Ifunnaya\n* Moshood Fattah as Ademide\n* Judith Ushi as Fadekami\n* Gbemi Akinlade as Kaira\n* Miracle Gabriel as Kaiso\n* Mike Afolarin\n* Wumi Toriola as Yedije friend I\n* Regina Chukwu as Yedije friend II\nProduction\nThe film project marked the third cinematic directorial venture for actress Funke Akindele after Your Excellency and Omo Ghetto: The Saga.
