In Britain this cover photo was superseded in 1977 by a portrait photo of Al Stewart, presumably in order to capitalise on his enhanced popularity as a result of the Year of the Cat album.\n* The blonde woman on the album cover is Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour's first wife, Ginger. The Cord automobile Stewart is sitting in belonged to Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page.\n* Centered in the cover, holding a mirror reflecting a bright light toward the viewer, as on Stewart's previous album, Past, Present and Future, the US version of the album features the Marvel Comics character Doctor Strange.\nReferences"
