Four singles were released from the album: \"For What It's Worth\", \"The Never-Ending Why\", \"Ashtray Heart\" and \"Bright Lights\".\nProduction\nDavid Bottrill produced the record, after having previously worked with Tool, Muse, Silverchair, Remy Zero, and dEUS.

Molko even experimented with the Springtime (experimental electric guitar made by Yuri Landman).\nContent\nThe material on the album has influences from such bands as PJ Harvey and My Bloody Valentine.\nFrontman Brian Molko said on the concept of the album:\nWe've made a record about choosing life, about choosing to live, about stepping out of the darkness and into the light. Not necessarily turning your back on the darkness because it's there, it's essential; it's a part of who you are, but more about the choice of standing in the sunlight instead.\nMolko has also stated that Battle for the Sun is the band's first album with a discernible thematic unity. Molko states that his favourite track from the album is \"Speak in Tongues\".\nMolko was inspired to write bonus track \"Unisex\" by the movie Cloverfield.\nRelease\nThe title track debuted on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show 17 March 2009. After the world première, it became available for free download on the band's official site. At an exclusive secret gig held on 17 March 2009, in London, the band played a number of new songs from the album, including the tracks \"Ashtray Heart\", \"Julien\", \"Kitty Litter\", and \"Devil in the Details\". They also covered Nik Kershaw's \"Wouldn't It Be Good\". The album was made available for streaming on the band's official website between 29 May and 31 May 2009.\nBattle for the Sun was released on 8 June 2009 as a download, CD, limited edition CD and DVD, LP, and a limited edition box set.

Eddie Fleisher of Alternative Press gave the album 4 and a half out of 5 stars, writing that Battle for the Sun \"takes the best elements of their sound and focuses it into a cohesive listening experience ... there's no filler to be found\". The review also notes how Steve Forrest as drummer gives the band a much-needed kick and how Brian Molko's lyrics are given more clarity. Fleisher also says the album contains two of the best Placebo songs ever, \"Happy You're Gone\" and \"Kings of Medicine\".\nOthers, however, have been less than receptive. NME said that Battle for the Sun was \"a desperately transparent copy of originality. For those who still believe in them, Placebo will, at least, remain an efficacious live band at festivals this summer, but only given that the real thing (Suede, Muse, David Bowie, Nirvana et al) isn't currently on offer.\" Rolling Stone added that \"too many songs (\"Devil in the Details\") are full of bombast and bland angst, as if these smart guys know better but can't help themselves\".\n| title14  = For What It's Worth\n| note14=Losers Maximal Techmix\n| length14 = 5:48\n| title15  = For What It's Worth\n| note15=Savours Remix\n| length15 = 6:00\n}}\n'Deluxe Edition bonus DVD 1: Live at Angkor Wat'\n*\"Meds\" – 5:23\n*\"Because I Want You\" – 4:23\n*\"Follow the Cops Back Home\" – 4:52\n*\"Black-Eyed\" – 3:14\n*\"Post Blue\" – 3:55\n*\"Blind\" – 4:15\n*\"Drag\" – 3:39\n*\"Teenage Angst\" – 3:19\n*\"Twenty Years\" – 4:55\n*Detour documentary\nDeluxe edition bonus DVD 2\n*In the Studio: The Making of Battle for the Sun documentary\nPersonnel\n; Placebo\n*Brian Molko – vocals, guitar, Springtime guitar, keyboards, piano\n*Stefan Olsdal – bass guitar, guitar, keyboards, piano, organ, backing vocals\n*Steve Forrest – drums, percussion, backing vocals\n; Additional personnel\n*Bill Lloyd – keyboards\n*Fiona Brice – string arrangements\n*Peter Cardinalli – brass arrangements\n*Alex Cooksey – keyboards, piano, backing vocals\n*Hazel Fernandes – backing vocals\n*Valerie Etienne – backing vocals\n; Technical\n*David Bottrill – production\n*James Brown – engineering\n*Wayne Cochrane – engineering assistance (tracking)\n*Kevin Dietz – engineering (recording)\n*Alan Moulder – mixing\n*Darren Lawson – mixing assistance\n*John Davis – mastering\n*Joseph Llanes – sleeve photography\n*Tim Young – Redux Edition remastering\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2009)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|Canadian Albums (Nielsen SoundScan)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|72\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|Polish Albums (ZPAV)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|14\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (2009)\n!Position\n|-\n|Austrian Albums (Ö3 Austria)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|61\n|-\n|Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|31\n|-\n|Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|29\n|-\n|Dutch Albums (Album Top 100)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|95\n|-\n|French Albums (SNEP)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|51\n|-\n|German Albums (Offizielle Top 100)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n|-\n|Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|47\n|}\nCertifications\n|relyear=2013}}\n}}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
