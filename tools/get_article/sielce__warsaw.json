It is a residential neighbourhood with mixed low- and high-rise housing. It forms part of the Lower Mokotów area.\nIt features several green areas, including the Arcadia Park, Eye of the Sea Park, and Sielce Park. The historic buildings in the neighbourhood include the Sielce Manor House, a neoclassical two-storey palace built in the 18th century, as well as the St. Joseph the Betrothed Church and the St. Casimir Church, built 1926 and 1934 respectively.\nThe oldest records of Sielce, then a small farming community, date to 1412. It was incorporated into the city in 1916.\nToponomy\nThe name Sielce, is an evolution of its original form, Siedlce, coming from Polish term zasiedlony, meaning settled.\nHistory\nThe oldest records of Sielce, then known as Siedlce, date to 1412, when duke Janusz I the Old gave its ownership to the St. John Archcathedral. It remained in its possession until it was confiscated by the Prussian government, following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. Sielce was a small farming community, probably originating as a part of the village of Czerniaków. In 1628, its farming estate had an area of 5 lans (90 ha).\nIn 1680, nobleperson and politician Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski built his palace residence near the current Piaseczyńska Street, with a garden complex. It included the Arcadia and Rabbit House ponds. In 1720, the area was bought by Augustus III of Poland, monarch of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, to use its natural water springs, to feed the water features of the Royal Baths park complex.\nIn 1775, Siekierki was leased to king Stanisław August Poniatowski, who founded there an English landscape garden centred around the Sielce Lake. In the second half of the 18th century the Sielce Manor House, a two-storey palace, was built in the neoclassical style in the garden. Around 1860, a silkworms silkworm farm was established in the area.\nIn 1774, the Szuster Palace, together with a garden complex, were built to the northwest of Sielce, as a residence of princess Elżbieta Izabela Lubomirska. In 1820, the estate became property of nobleperson Anna Tyszkiewicz, and in 1845, it was bought by Franciszek Szuster, who then opened a popular holiday village in the area, named the Promenade (Polish: Promenada), with the gardens becoming its recreational green area. The park also included the Promenade Ponds, two artificial lakes formed from flooded clay pits. At the end of the 19th century, the Promenade amusement park was opened, with a luxury restaurant, circus, and open-air theatre among other attractions. It operated until the outbreak of the First World War, and again, from its end until the beginning of the Second World War.\nIn the second half of the 19th century, a portion of Sielce belonged to Konstantin Pavlovich, the commander-in-chief of the Army of Congress Poland, and a member of the House of Romanov. Following his and his wife's deaths in 1831, the possession was left in their last will to his brother, Nicholas I, the Emperor of Russia and King of Poland. As such, the arra became a property of the Russian government, and remained as such until the independence of Poland in 1918.\nFollowing the abolition of serfdom in 1864, the village was incorporated into the municipality of Mokotów. Afterwards, a portion of the land in Sielce was sold, with several hamlets forming there, including: Jadzin, Stoczek, Przylipie, and Marcelin. In 1870, Sielce had 316 inhabitants.\nIn 1891, the narrow-gauge tracks of the Wilanów Railway were built crossing the area along the current Chmielna Street, with a station in Marcelin. In 1894, the horsecars were replaced with steam locomotives. Amid the protest from the residents of Sielce against the noise caused by the trains, the route was altered to omit the village. In 1914, a tram line was briefly operated crossing the village, however, due to low demand, it was closed shortly after, and the tracks were removed.\nOn 8 April 1916, the area was incorporated into the city of Warsaw, becoming part of the district of Mokotów.\nIn 1921, Sielce were connected to the municipal transit system via a bus line, which was replaced with a tram line on Czerniakowska Street a year later. The line ended at Bernardine Square in Czerniaków.\nIn the interwar period, the area around Belwederska Street began to develop into a modern suburb. At the time, two Catholic churches were built in the area. This included the St. Joseph the Betrothed Church built in 1926, and the St. Casimir Church, built in 1934. In 1944, the neighbourhood became a battleground during the Warsaw Uprising. At night from 15 to 16 September, the Polish resistance partisans were pushed out of Sielce by the German soldiers, retreating to Upper Mokotów.\nIn 1949, the Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych i Fabularnych (Narrative and Documentary Film Studio), one of the oldest continuously-operated film studios in Poland, was founded at 21 Chełmska Street.\nBetween 1953 and 1967, a series of housing estates were developed in the area. They were centred around Chełmska, Gagarina, and Sobieskiego Streets, and featured apartment buildings constructed in the large panel system technique. This included neighbourhoods of Chełmska, Dolna-Belwederska, Dolna-Piaseczyńska, Dolna-Sobieskiego, and Sielce, among others.\nIn 1956, Czerniaków Hospital, featuring 8 wards, was opened at 19 and 25 Stępińska Street.\nIn 1960, the Chełmska bus depot was opened at the corner of Chełmska and Czerniakowska Streets. As the only one of the city, it stored the trolleybuses, until they were phazed out in 1973. The depot operated until 2006 when it was demolished.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the historic gardens in the area, were redeveloped into Arcadia Park, Sielce Park, and Eye of the Sea Park.\nIn 1974, Czerniakowska Street became part of Vistula Way, a thoroughfare crossing the city from north to south. To facilitate the change, the tram tracks were removed from the road in 1973.\nIn 1980, the now-historical brutalist bookstore pavilion, known as Uniwersus, was built at 20 and 22 Belwederska Street, and acclaimed for its design. In the 1990s, it was turned into an office building.\nIn 1991, the Tadeusz Koźluk Medical Academy of Warsaw, the first private university in the city, was founded at 9 Bobrowiecka Street.\nIn 1993, the Centrum Handlowe Panorama was opened at 31 Witosa Street, as the first shopping mall in the city.\nIn 1998, Mokotów was divided into twelve areas of City Information System, with Sielce becoming one of them.\nIn 2002, the Agora Headquarters, a postmodernist office building was opened at 8 and 10 Czerska Street. It was acclaimed for its design, and is regarded as one of the best office building designs in the city. The same year, the Wajda School, a private film university, was founded at 21 Chełmska Street, by filmmakers Andrzej Wajda, Wojciech Marczewski, and Barbara Pec-Ślesicka.\nIn 2003, the Beit Warszawa Synagogue, which belongs to the Reform Jewish denomination, was founded in a house at 9 Stępińska Street.\nCharacteristics\nbuilding, regarded as one of the best office building designs in Warsaw.]]\nSielce is a residential area with several housing estates of apartment buildings, mostly centred around Chełmska, Gagarina, and Sobieskiego Streets.
