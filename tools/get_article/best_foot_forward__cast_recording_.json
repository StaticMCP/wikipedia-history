The album features performances by a young company, including Liza Minnelli in one of her earliest professional appearances, and captures the score by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane with primarily piano accompaniment.\nThe album was released by Cadence Records and became part of a rare trend at the time for independent labels to issue musical theatre recordings. It included the single \"You Are for Loving\"/\"What Do You Think I Am\", which received positive attention, and was later reissued by Stet Records and Piccadilly with new covers, and titled Best Foot Forward – The Off-Broadway Hit Revival that Introduce Liza Minnelli (1977) and Best Foot Forward – The Musical Comedy Featuring Liza Minnelli (1982), respectively.\nOverview\nBest Foot Forward is a musical comedy that follows a prep school student who invites a Hollywood movie star to attend his prom, with surprising results. The story centers on the humorous situations that arise from the encounter, featuring a score by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane. The 1963 Off-Broadway revival at Stage 73 ran for 224 performances. It was directed and choreographed by Danny Daniels and featured newcomer Liza Minnelli. According to Cash Box Minnelli's performance \"got solid notices in her featured role\". The release of the original cast album was part of a rare trend at the time for independent labels to issue musical theatre recordings.\nThe first  single released, \"You Are for Loving\"/\"What Do You Think I Am\" (Cadence 1436) was given a B rating by Cash Box. The A-side, \"You Are for Loving\", was praised as a \"charming\" addition to the musical's score, with Liza Minnelli's vocals noted for their resemblance to her mother, Judy Garland, and complemented by an attractive orchestral backing. The B-side was described as a delightful original tune by Martin and Blane, further highlighting the appeal of the single as a whole.\nThe cast album was one of the final releases by Cadence Records before the label ceased operations in September 1963. In 1977, Stet Records re-released the album with a new cover including the subtitle The Off-Broadway Hit Revival that Introduce Liza Minnelli. In 1982, the album was reissued by Piccadilly (catalog number PiC 3485), with a new cover and titled Best Foot Forward – The Musical Comedy Featuring Liza Minnelli.\nCritical reception\n| rev2 = Cast Album Reviews\n| rev2Score =\n}}\nBillboard praised Best Foot Forward as a lively off-Broadway revival, highlighting Liza Minnelli's energetic and convincing performance and the spirited ensemble. In his AllMusic review, William Ruhlmann praised Minnelli's performance and also highlighted a strong showing from Ronald Walken (later known as Christopher Walken).\nRichard Barrios of Cast Album Reviews described the recording as capturing an energetic young company, noting that Liza Minnelli's debut performance added youthful glow and charm, even if her secondary role slightly shifted the show's balance. Barrios highlighted Paula Wayne in \"Hollywood Story\" and praised ensemble numbers such as \"The Three B's\".\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from Best Foot Forward LP (Cadence, CLP 24012).\n* Music and lyrics by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane\n* Arranged (Dance Music) and piano by William Goldenberg\n* Directed and choreographed by Danny Daniels\n* Engineered by Bob Arnold\n* Lighting by Jules Fisher\n* Music direction and piano by Buster Davis\n* Produced by Archie Bleyer\n* Production managed by Toni Manzi\n* Assistant production managers – Anne Wallace, Patricia Stewart\n* Stage management by Robert Fletcher\nReferences"
