Formerly placed in the \"Old World warbler\" assemblage, it is now placed in the newly recognized family Locustellidae. It is found in the mountains of northern Luzon in the Philippines.\nDescription\nEBird describes the bird as \"A fairly small, slender bird of lower montane grassy valleys. Warm brown above and on the belly, with a white throat and a faintly streaked grayish chest. Note indistinct pale brow and pale barring across the base of the undertail. Very skulking. Similar to Long-tailed Bush-Warbler, but has shorter tail and grayish rather than deep brown underparts. Also similar to Philippine Bush-Warbler but with less distinct pale eyebrow. Song is a sequence of piercing and grating ringing notes repeated at regular intervals.\"\nPreviously placed in Bradypterus but is now in Locustella. It was formerly conspecific with the Russet bush warbler.This species is monotypic and has no subspecies.\nEcology and behavior\nNothing is known about its ecology. It is presumed to feed on insects. It is most vocal in February.\nHabitat and conservation status\nIt is found to steep grass valleys in montane areas from  above sea level.  It appears to be limited to drier areas, and has been found in areas both with or without pine trees. Little else is known about this bird.\nIUCN has assessed this bird as least-concern with the population believed to be stable.\nThere is a need for surveys to determine whether this species is rare and possibly threatened or whether it is just widely overlooked. Studies of its habitat associations and tolerance of degraded areas are needed.\nReferences\npt:Bradypterus seebohmi"
