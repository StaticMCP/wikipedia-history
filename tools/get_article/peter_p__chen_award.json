Named after the computer scientist Peter Chen, the award was started in 2008 by the publisher Elsevier as a means of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the journal Data & Knowledge Engineering. It is presented at the Entity Relationship (ER) International Conference on Conceptual Modeling. Winners are given a plaque, a cash prize, and are invited to give a keynote speech.\nThere are five criteria for selecting the winner; research, how the nominee has contributed to advance the field of conceptual modeling; service, organizational contributions for related meetings, conferences, and editorial boards; education, mentoring of doctoral students in the field; contribution to practice, contributions to technology transfer, commercialization, and industrial projects; and international reputation. The selection committee is composed of five members: the Steering Committee chair, two Program Committee members appointed by the Steering Committee chair, and the recipients of the last two years.\nLaureates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
