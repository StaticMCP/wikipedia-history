It is a Scheduled Monument.\nHistory\nAlkmonton is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, as Alchementune; it was held under Henry de Ferrers. There were 8 villagers and 7 smallholders. In 1332 the tax quota was comparable to its neighbours.\nIn about 1100, when the manor was held by Robert de Bakepuze, a hospital for female lepers was built, dedicated to Saint Leonard. It was refounded in 1406, leprosy having died out, by the widow of Sir Walter Blount, who held the manor. His descendant Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy (died 1474) willed that a chapel, dedicated to Saint Nicholas, should be built at Alkmonton, and that the master of the hospital should say Mass there each year on the feast of St Nicholas.\nThe hospital and chapel were abolished during the reign of Edward VI.\nEarthworks\nThe earthworks, thought to be the entirety of the medieval village, are south of the present-day village of Alkmonton, on a south-west facing slope, next to Alkmonton Old Hall Farm to the south. They are well preserved; there is a village green in the south of the site, and sunken trackways lead away from it. There is a platform, about  by , thought to be the site of the medieval chapel. A font, now in St John's Church in Alkmonton, was found near here in 1844. There is a larger platform north of the supposed chapel, about  by . There are other features, rectangular enclosures within which are building platforms.\nNorth and east of the site of the village are ridge and furrow patterns, surviving to a height of , of the medieval open-field system.\nSee also\n* Hungry Bentley, a deserted village nearby\n* List of lost settlements in the United Kingdom\nReferences"
