      "text": "# Timeline of the 2013 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2013 Pacific hurricane season was an above-average year in which twenty named storms developed.|group=\"nb\"}} The hurricane season officially began on May&nbsp;15 in the East Pacific, coinciding with the formation of Tropical Storm Alvin, and on June&nbsp;1 in the Central Pacific; it ended on November&nbsp;30 in both basins. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form. The final system of the year, Tropical Storm Sonia, dissipated on November&nbsp;4.\nThe season produced twenty-one tropical depressions. All but one further intensified into tropical storms and nine further intensified to become hurricanes. Despite this level of activity, only one hurricane&nbsp;– Raymond&nbsp;– strengthened into a major hurricane.|group=\"nb\"}} The most significant storm, in terms of loss of life and damage, was Hurricane Manuel. Forming in mid-September, Manuel attained its peak as a minimal Category&nbsp;1 hurricane before moving ashore on the coastline of Mexico. In total, the storm contributed to 123 confirmed fatalities and $4.2&nbsp;billion (2013 USD) in damage. Throughout the duration of the season, four other named storms&nbsp;– Hurricane Barbara and tropical storms Juliette, Octave, and Sonia&nbsp;– made landfall in Mexico, causing minor damage and loss of life.\nThis timeline includes information that was not released in real time, but derived from post-season analyzes by the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center; as a result, it may include storms that were not operationally warned upon. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.\nTimeline\nMay\nMay&nbsp;15\n*The 2013 East Pacific hurricane season officially begins.\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT May&nbsp;14)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One-E develops from an area of low pressure about 650&nbsp;mi (1,045&nbsp;km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico, becoming the second lowest-latitude-forming tropical cyclone on record.\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;a.m. PDT)&nbsp;– Tropical Depression One-E intensifies into Tropical Storm Alvin roughly 665&nbsp;mi (1,070&nbsp;km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.\nMay&nbsp;16\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT May&nbsp;15)&nbsp;– Tropical Storm Alvin attains its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of  and a minimum barometric pressure of 1000&nbsp;mb (hPa;
