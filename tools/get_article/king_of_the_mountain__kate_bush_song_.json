Taken from her eighth album, Aerial (2005), it was released on 24 October 2005 as the album's only single. The single peaked at No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart.\nOverview\n\"King of the Mountain\" was released as a single by EMI Records on 24 October 2005, Bush's first single since \"And So Is Love\", which had been released 11 years before. It was first played on BBC Radio 2 on 21 September 2005.\nWritten about ten years before most of the songs on Aerial, the lyrics enquire whether Elvis Presley might still be alive someplace, \"...looking like a happy man...\" and playing with \"Rosebud\", Kane's childhood's sled, and comment on the pressures of extreme fame and wealth. In a November 2005 interview with BBC Four's Front Row Bush said, \"I don't think human beings are really built to withstand that kind of fame.\"\nSung in a slightly slurred Elvis-type manner,\n| title1          = King of the Mountain\n| length1         = 4:53\n| title2          = Sexual Healing\n| length2         = 5:58\n}}\nCharts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Chart performance for \"King of the Mountain\"\n!Chart (2005)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada (Nielsen SoundScan)\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|12\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Greece (IFPI Greece)\n|31\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
