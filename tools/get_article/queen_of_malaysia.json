Paduka means victorious and the term Baginda is the Malay possessive pronoun for a royal in the third person.\n*  in literal English is the \"Supreme Queen\". It is an archaic equivalent to Raja where the female is a Raja Permaisuri and \"Agong\" (or  in standard Malay) means 'supreme'. The term Agong is not translated, as in the Constitution of Malaysia. The Malay word permaisuri is derived from Sanskrit परमेश्वरी (parameśvarī), 'supreme lady'.\nCommon English terms used in the media and by the general public include \"Supreme Queen\" and \"Paramount Consort\".\nIn formal English correspondence, for many years the queen was referred to as \"Her Majesty The Raja Permaisuri Agong\". In January 2024, this was changed to \"Her Majesty The Queen of Malaysia\".\nThere are two formal ways of addressing the queen:\n* Malay: Tuanku (literally 'My Lady')\n* English: Your Majesty\nThe queen immediately follows her husband, the king, in the Malaysian order of precedence.\nStatus, functions, and privileges\nThe king is elected (de facto rotated) every five years from among the nine hereditary rulers of the states of Malaysia by the Conference of Rulers. When a ruler is elected to the office of king, his consort is automatically bestowed the title and dignity of queen and serves the same term of office as her husband. In effect, the holder of the title of Queen of Malaysia changes every five years, though it could happen earlier due to the death or abdication of the king during his term of office.\nLike many spouses of heads of state, the queen has no stipulated role in the Constitution of Malaysia. She accompanies the king to official functions and state visits, as well as hosting visiting heads of state and their spouses during their visits to Malaysia. Article 34 of the Malaysian Constitution forbids the queen from holding any appointment, carrying any remuneration, or actively engaging in any commercial enterprise during her tenure. The queen is, however, legally entitled to an annual payment which is included in the Civil List of the king during his term of office.\nPrevious holders of the title of Queen of Malaysia whose husbands are deceased receive a pension from the Federal Government's Civil List. They also take precedence immediately after the reigning king, the current queen, the reigning monarchs of royal states, and the  (governors) of non-royal states.\nList of queens of Malaysia\nThe following consorts have served in the office of queen:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=\"5\"|Number\n! width=\"180\"|Name\n! width=\"160\"|State\n! width=\"410\"|Tenure start\n! width=\"410\"|Tenure end\n! width=\"180\"|Yang di-Pertuan Agong\n! width=\"180\"|Birth\n! width=\"180\"|Death\n|-\n| 1 (I)  || Tuanku Kurshiah ||  || 31 August 1957\n|1 April 1960||Tuanku Abdul Rahman||||\n|-\n| 2 (II)  || Raja Jema'ah||  || 14 April 1960\n|1 September 1960||Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah|| 1900||\n|-\n| 3 (III)  || Tengku Budriah||  || 21 September 1960\n|20 September 1965||Tuanku Syed Putra||||\n|-\n| 4 (IV) || Tengku Intan Zaharah||  || 21 September 1965\n|20 September 1970||Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah||||\n|-\n| 5 (V) || Tuanku Bahiyah||  || 21 September 1970\n|20 September 1975||Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah||||\n|-\n| 6 (VI)  || Tengku Zainab||  || 21 September 1975\n|29 March 1979||Sultan Yahya Petra||||\n|-\n| 7 (VII)  || Tengku Hajah Afzan||  || 26 April 1979\n|25 April 1984||Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta'in Billah || ||\n|-\n| 8 (VIII)  || Tengku Zanariah ||  || 26 April 1984\n|25 April 1989||Sultan Iskandar||||\n|-\n| 9 (IX)  || Tuanku Bainun||  || 26 April 1989\n|25 April 1994||Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah||||Alive\n|-\n| 10 (X) || Tuanku Najihah||  || 26 April 1994\n|25 April 1999||Tuanku Ja'afar||||\n|-\n| 11 (XI) || Tuanku Siti Aishah||  || 26 April 1999\n|21 November 2001||Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz || ||Alive\n|-\n| 12 (XII) || Tengku Fauziah||  || 13 December 2001\n|12 December 2006||Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin||||Alive\n|-\n| 13 (XIII) || Tuanku Nur Zahirah ||  || 13 December 2006\n|12 December 2011||Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin ||  || Alive\n|-\n| 14 (XIV) || Tuanku Hajah Haminah||  || 13 December 2011\n|12 December 2016||Sultan Abdul Halim of Kedah Sultanah Haminah was his second wife from 1975 to his death and reigned alongside him as Raja Permaisuri Agong XIV as Sultanah Bahiyah had died in 2003.}} ||||Alive\n|-\n| 15 (XV) || }} || || colspan=\"2\"  || Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan || colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| 16 (XVI) || Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah||  || 31 January 2019\n|30 January 2024||Sultan Abdullah of Pahang || ||Alive\n|-\n| 17 (XVII) || Raja Zarith Sofiah ||  || 31 January 2024 || Incumbent || Sultan Ibrahim of Johor || ||Alive\n|}\nSee also\n* Elective monarchy\n* King of Malaysia&nbsp;— ''consort's spouse + monarch−ruler of Malaysia.\n* Malay styles and titles&nbsp;— on Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo within Brunei + Malaysia.\n* Regalia of Malaysia\n* Yang di-Pertuan Negara&nbsp;— national Malaysian award for elected monarchs''.\nNotes\nReferences"
