It existed from 1972 to 1996 and was represented by Jim Bolger of the National Party for those 24 years.\nPopulation centres\nSince the , the number of electorates in the South Island was fixed at 25, with continued faster population growth in the North Island leading to an increase in the number of general electorates. There were 84 electorates for the 1969 election, and the 1972 electoral redistribution saw three additional general seats created for the North Island, bringing the total number of electorates to 87. Together with increased urbanisation in Christchurch and Nelson, the changes proved very disruptive to existing electorates.  In the South Island, three electorates were abolished, and three electorates were newly created. In the North Island, five electorates were abolished, two electorates were recreated, and six electorates were newly created (including King Country).\nThe King Country electorate was formed from area that previously belonged to the  and  electorates, which were both abolished. The King Country electorate covered a largely rural area with a dispersed population. It has no cities. The largest towns are Ōtorohanga and Te Kūiti.\nHistory\nThe previous representative of the Waimarino electorate was Roy Jack who transferred to the enlarged  electorate in 1972. David Seath had held the  Waitomo electorate since  and he retired in 1972. This gave Jim Bolger the opportunity to stand in the new King Country electorate when it was formed in 1972, and the area being a traditional stronghold for National, he won the election with ease. Bolger became Prime Minister in 1990 while representing the King Country electorate.\nThe electorate combined with the adjacent rural electorate of Taranaki in 1996 to form the Taranaki-King Country electorate for MMP.\nElection results\nKey\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!width=100| Election\n!width=175 colspan=2| Winner\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=8 width=5 bgcolor=|\n|rowspan=8 |Jim Bolger\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=center|(Electorate abolished in 1996; see )\n|}\n1993 election\n|title=Part 1: Votes recorded at each polling place |publisher=New Zealand Chief Electoral Office |year=1993 }}\n}}\n1990 election\n|title=Part 1: Votes recorded at each polling place |publisher=New Zealand Chief Electoral Office |year=1990 }}\n}}\n|party      = Imperial British Conservative\n|candidate  = Kate McDonald\n|votes      = 53\n|percentage =\n|change     =\n}}\n1987 election\n}}\n1984 election\n}}\n1981 election\n}}\n1978 election\n}}\n1975 election\n}}\n1972 election\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*"
