      "text": "# After Apple-Picking\n\n\"After Apple-Picking\" is a poem by American poet Robert Frost. It was published in 1914 in North of Boston, Frost's second poetry collection. The poem, 42 lines in length, does not strictly follow a particular form (instead consisting of mixed iambs), nor does it follow a standard rhyme scheme.\nSummary\nThe poem describes a pastoral scene of New England life in autumn. The narrator is recalling his day spent picking apples on a ladder. Throughout the poem, the narrator expresses a desire for rest, using phrases such as \"I am drowsing off\" (8) and \"I am overtired\" (28).\nHe reflects on his mortality, and whether he will ever again wake up and have the opportunity to pick apples. The poem concludes with the narrator ostensibly falling asleep.\nVersification\nThe poem's first line is in iambic hexameter, the second is in iambic dimeter, and in the third line shifts to iambic pentameter. The majority of the lines continue in iambic pentameter. In lines 13-17, the meter alternates between iambic pentameter and dimeter. The remainder of the poem is composed of variations on the iambic meter, containing iambic pentameter, trimeter, dimeter, and monometer.\nThe rhyme scheme of the poem is inconsistent beyond the first few lines. Lines 1-4 follow an ABBA rhyme pattern, lines 5-6 follow CC, and lines 7-9 follow DED. After this, however, there is no standard pattern, with lines instead rhyming sporadically.\nInterpretation\nScholarly interpretation of the poem often focuses on themes of sleep, dreaming, and the somber conclusion to the piece, in which the narrator wonders if his oncoming sleep is a normal slumber, or a \"long sleep.\" The varying meter of the poem is thought to be indicative of the narrator's fitful state of mind as he drifts off to sleep. The rhyme scheme of the poem is similarly scattered, lending itself to a similar interpretation.\nThe process of picking apples is symbolic through both the action itself and the apparatus used. The apple-picking ladder is a symbol, both metaphorical and real, that points to a destination beyond itself, while the act of picking apples is a metaphor for the power of labor. The power of labor is its ability to go beyond natural occurrences such as the shifting of seasons, or bodily exhaustion.\nReferences"
