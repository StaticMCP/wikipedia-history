It was demolished in 1990 and replaced by the Melvin Price Locks and Dam, which is also known as Lock and Dam number 26.\nBackground\nOn December 29, 1933, John Griffiths and Son Company of Chicago, Illinois, won the contact with a bid of $3,269,565.00, the lowest of five bids received on construction of the locks. Work officially started on January 13, 1934. Due to adverse river conditions, John Griffiths and Son Company gave up the contract in April 1936 with about a third of the work completed.\nEngineering Construction Corporation, formed by Spencer, White and Prentis, George A. Fuller Company, and Turner Construction Company, all of New York\nCity, bid $1,200,000 to complete the locks. This company also won with a bid of $4,856,716.80 to construct the dam. The contract was awarded on May 14, 1935 and work officially began on June 15, 1935.\n\"The twin locks, as designed, comprise a main lock basin  long by  wide, with 45-foot gates, and an auxiliary look basin  long  wide with 27-foot gates upstream. This lock width is standard in all locks being constructed in this series, and is the same as that of the Panama Canal Locks.\" Page 19.\nSee also\n*Old Clark Bridge\nReferences\nExternal links\n* includes photos of the lock and dam, the old Clark Bridge, and the adjacent swing span rail bridge."
