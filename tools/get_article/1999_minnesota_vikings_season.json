      "text": "# 1999 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 1999 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 39th in the National Football League (NFL). After going a near perfect 15–1 record in 1998, the Vikings began the 1999 season with high expectations of another great season. Randall Cunningham resumed duties again in 1999, but after a struggling 2–4 start to the season, he was benched and Jeff George was given the starting job as quarterback. A notable part of the season is that, before or during the season, a decent amount of contributors (such as Derrick Alexander, Orlando Bobo, and Jerry Ball, and Stalin Colinet) from their dominant 1998 team were lost to the Cleveland Browns \"expansion\" team.\nGeorge finished the season with an 8–2 record, and led the Vikings into the postseason once again, with an overall team record of 10–6 failing to match their record from the 1998 season. Minnesota beat the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Game 27–10 and faced playoff newcomer Kurt Warner and the St. Louis Rams in the divisional round. The game was a shootout which Minnesota led 17–14 at halftime, but the Rams outscored Minnesota 35 to 20 in the second half to win 49–37. St. Louis would then go on to win Super Bowl XXXIV against the Titans.\nOffseason\n1999 expansion draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Vikings selected during the expansion draft\n|-\n!width=100px style=\"\"| Pick\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Name\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Position\n!width=150px style=\"\"| Expansion team\n|-\n|18 || Duane Butler || Safety || rowspan=\"2\" | Cleveland Browns\n|-\n|27||Orlando Bobo||Guard\n|}\n1999 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1999 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 1 || 11\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Daunte Culpepper\n| Quarterback\n| UCF\n| From Redskins\n|-\n! 29\n| Dimitrius Underwood\n| Defensive end\n| Michigan State\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 2 || 44\n| Jim Kleinsasser\n| Tight end\n| North Dakota\n| From Steelers\n|-\n! 59\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 3 || 73\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers\n| From Redskins\n|-\n! 91\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the New England Patriots\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 4 || 120\n| Kenny Wright\n| Cornerback\n| Northwestern State\n| From Dolphins\n|-\n! 125\n| Jay Humphrey\n| Offensive tackle\n| Texas\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 5 || 163\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers\n|\n|-\n! 169\n| Chris Jones\n| Safety\n| Clemson\n| Compensatory pick\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 6 || 185\n| Talance Sawyer\n| Defensive tackle\n| UNLV\n| From Buccaneers, via Ravens\n|-\n! 199\n| Antico Dalton\n| Linebacker\n| Hampton\n|\n|-\n! 7 || 236\n| Noel Scarlett\n| Defensive tackle\n| Langston\n|\n|}\nNotes:\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!
