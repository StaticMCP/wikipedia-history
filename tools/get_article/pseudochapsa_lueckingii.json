It is known only from a single collection in São Paulo, Brazil.\nTaxonomy\nThe lichen was first formally described as a new species in 2009 by Klaus Kalb. He collected the type specimen from a dense and humid rainforest at an elevation of , where it was found growing on the smooth bark of a deciduous tree. The species epithet honours his colleague Robert Lücking, \"for his outstanding contributions to tropical lichenology\". The taxon was transferred in 2012 to Pseudochapsa, a segregate genus of Chapsa, characterised by the brown colour of its .\nDescription\nPseudochapsa lueckingii has a smooth, olive-green thallus with a 3–10&nbsp;μm-thick, hyaline cortical layer. It has large, more-or-less round apothecia measuring 0.7–2&nbsp;mm in diameter with a pale brown  covered with white . Ascospores typically have between 5 and 7 transverse septa, and measure 17–25 by 6–7&nbsp;μm. The lichen contains stictic acid as a major metabolite and minor amounts of constictic acid. Kalb suggests that the Panamanian species Pseudochapsa pseudoschizostoma is closely related; this species differs from P.&nbsp;lueckingii in lacking a cortex and in its much smaller apothecia.\n}}"
