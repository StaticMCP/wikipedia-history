What begins as a genuine attempt to get an interview with the so-called 'Iron Lady' quickly turns into a game of cat-and-mouse in the United States, with the filmmaker snubbed at every turn.\nAside from the comedy of Broomfield's repeatedly failing attempts to gain access, the film discusses the accusations that Thatcher's son, Mark, used his mother's connections to effect arms deals in Saudi Arabia.\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070711075609/http://www.nickbroomfield.com/maggie.html Official website]\n*\n* [http://www.documentaries.im/nick-broomfield/tracking-down-maggie.html Tracking Down Maggie Review]"
