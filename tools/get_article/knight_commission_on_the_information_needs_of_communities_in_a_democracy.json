The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation funded the Commission and commissioned the Aspen Institute Communications and Society Program to run it. The co-chairs of the Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities in a Democracy are Theodore B. Olson, American lawyer and former Solicitor General of the United States, and Marissa Mayer, Vice President of Search Product and User Experience at Google.  The Commission held its first public meeting in Washington, D.C., on June 24, 2008, and subsequent meetings or community forums in Aspen, Colorado; Chicago, Illinois; Missoula, Montana; Mountain View, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Washington, D.C.  The Knight Commission released its report, Informing Communities: Sustaining Democracy in the Digital Age on October 2, 2009.\nOn October 28, 2009, the Federal Communications Commission appointed Steven Waldman, Steven Waldman president and editor-in-chief of beliefnet.com, \"to lead an agency-wide initiative to assess the state of media in these challenging economic times and make recommendations designed to ensure a vibrant media landscape.\"  In announcing the appointment the Commission cited the Knight Commission as one of the factors leading to this appointment and initiative.[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-294328A1.doc]\nMembers of the Commission\nThe 17 members of the Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities in a Democracy are:\nMarissa Mayer, co-chair, vice president of Search Product and User Experience, Google\nTheodore B.

The report's most urgent finding is that a \"broadband gap\", a \"literacy gap\" and a \"participation gap\" combined threaten to hold those U.S. residents who are young, poor and live in rural areas in a second-class status as citizens. The report contains 15 numbered recommendations listed under three broader objectives that seek to \"maximize the availability of relevant and credible information\", \"enhance the information capacity of individuals\", and \"promote public engagement.\"  A top priority noted in the report is universal broadband access to all Americans.\nThe Commission report was presented to several notable federal officials during a forum at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., on October 2, 2009. Participating officials included Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission; Aneesh Chopra, the Obama administration's Chief Technology Officer; and Ernest J. Wilson III, chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101112185332/http://www.knightcomm.org/ Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities in a Democracy official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091005002325/http://www.report.knightcomm.org/ Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities in a Democracy report website]\n* [http://www.knightfoundation.org Knight Foundation website]\n* [http://www.aspeninstitute.org Aspen Institute website]\n* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/213322 C-SPAN video coverage of report release event on October 2, 2009]"
