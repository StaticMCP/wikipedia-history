It was recorded at Loco studios by Andrew Fryer, and mixed at Clockwork by Alan Scott. It was released on Vinyl Solution as Sol 11 on 20 June 1988, and re-released on Vinyl Solution as Sol 11 in 1992, with a different album sleeve. The album was again re-released in 2005 with the old album sleeve restored. The sound of the album dominantly featured characteristics of grindcore, with lyrics socio-politically charged as the members had roots in crust punk, and created a sound that was heavily influenced by their roots.\nGerman melodic death metal/metalcore act Heaven Shall Burn used the same album title for their debut EP as a homage to Bolt Thrower, claiming that the band had a huge influence on their music.\nTrack listing\n*All songs written by Bolt Thrower\nPersonnel\n;Bolt Thrower\n* Karl Willetts – vocals\n* Gavin Ward – guitars\n* Barry Thomson – guitars\n* Jo Bench – bass\n* Andrew Whale – drums\n;Technicial personnel\n* Andrew Fryer – production\n* Alan Scott – mixing\n* Paul McHale – front cover\n* Jim – additional artwork\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
