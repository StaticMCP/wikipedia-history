The bridge, part of Massachusetts Route 2, carries automobile, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic and is owned and managed by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT).\nHistory\nThe French King Bridge (FKB) was opened to traffic on September 10, 1932. It was named the \"Most Beautiful Steel Bridge\" of 1932 by the American Institute of Steel Construction. The bridge was rebuilt in 1992, and refurbished in 2008–2010.\nSuicides\nIn 2009, police said that between 26 and 31 people were known to have jumped off the bridge since its construction in 1932, with only 2 survivors.\nIn 2023 nine-foot steel barrier was erected on both side of the bridge by MassDOT. The barriers have all but stopped the need for emergency responders to be called to the bridge for rescue of people in crisis, or recovery of people who have jumped.\nName\nThe name comes from a nearby geographic feature named French King Rock, visible in the middle of the river.\nImage gallery\nImage:IMG_3758_view_north_from_French_King_Bridge.jpg|A view north from the top of the bridge during summer (August 2007)\nFile:Autumn Massachusetts 1.jpg|A view from the bridge to Connecticut River at Autumn\nImage:IMG_3766_road_surface_of_French_King_Bridge.jpg|A view of the road surface and guard rails\nImage:IMG_3862_French_King_Bridge_lamp_post.jpg|The southwest lamp post\nImage:French_king_bridge_plaque.png|The honorary plaque on the North West side of the bridge\nSee also\n*List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Massachusetts\n*List of crossings of the Connecticut River\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150930152447/http://www.mhd.state.ma.us//default.asp?pgid=bridge/frenchking&sid=bridgeData Massachusetts Highway Department: French King Bridge] Archived from the [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us//default.asp?pgid=bridge/frenchking&sid=bridgeData original] on 2015-09-30.
