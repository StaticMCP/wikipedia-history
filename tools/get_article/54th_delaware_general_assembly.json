Elections were held on the first Tuesday of October, and terms began on the first Tuesday in January. It met in Dover, convening on January 5, 1830, two weeks before the beginning of the first year of Governor David Hazzard's administration.\nSeats were permanently assigned to three senators and seven representatives for each of the three counties. The county's population did not affect the number of delegates. Both chambers had a National Republican majority.\nLeadership\nSenate\n*Presley Spruance Jr., Kent County\nHouse of Representatives\n*Joshua Burton, Sussex County\nMembers\nSenate\nThe public elected senators for a three-year term, one-third posted each year.\n{|width=100%\n|-valign=top\n|\n:New Castle County\n*John Caulk\n*Thomas Deakyne\n*William T.
