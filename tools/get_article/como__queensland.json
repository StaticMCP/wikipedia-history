In the , Como had a population of 54 people.\nGeography\nComo is on the Sunshine Coast,  north-west of Noosa Heads, immediately south of the boundary between the Shire of Noosa and Gympie Region (to the north).\nThe locality is bordered to the north-east and east by the Noosa River and to the south-east by the shore of Lake Cootharaba.\nMuch of the locality is within protected areas. Most of the east of the locality is within the Great Sandy National Park with part of the west of the locality within the Toolara State Forest. The south-west of the locality has rural residential land and is also used for grazing and crop-growing. The north of the locality also has grazing.\nHistory\nHistorically, this area has been logged for timber, resulting in a number of campsites and small townships established for the timber workers. Transport of the timber and workers was mostly by boat.\nHarry's Hut was built in 1957 as a shelter for timber workers from a local campsite to use during heavy rainfall. After the logging ceased in the 1960s, the hut was purchased by Harry Spring who operated pharmacies in Pomona and Cooroy. He used the hut as a base while fishing in the Noosa River. Following his death in 1999, the hut came under the control of the National Parks department of the Queensland Government, but it continues to bear his name.\nBetween 2008 and 2013, Como was within Sunshine Coast Region. In 2008, the Queensland Government forced Shire of Noosa to amalgamate, resulting in the new local government area of Sunshine Coast Region.  However, a vote of former Shire of Noosa residents was taken to de-amalgamate, and Shire of Noosa was re-established in 2014.\nHeritage listings\nComo has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Elanda Point on Lake Cootharaba: Mill Point Settlement Site ()\n* Lake Cootharaba ()\n* Harry's Hut, Harrys Hut Road ()\nDemographics\nIn the , Como had a population of 46 people.\nIn the , Como had a population of 54 people.\nEconomy\nThere are a number of homesteads in the locality:\n* Como Park ()\n* Cootharaba ()\n* Tarangau ()\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Como.
