Founded by Paul and Jan Roman, the magazine solicited articles from experienced woodworkers and only accepted advertising for products related to woodworking.\nThe magazine focuses on the very best of woodworking techniques at the highest level of skill. Articles include practical tutorials on technique, the theory of timber, finishes or tools, as well as showcases for high-quality finished work. The magazine emphasizes high-quality work regardless of the difficulty of execution.\nThere are many \"project\" articles.\nNotable contributors\n* Tage Frid\n* R. Bruce Hoadley\n* Richard Raffan\nRelated publications\nSince the first issues, subscribers have collected back issues. Taunton encourages this, with sales of back issues and the publication of indexes.\nCollected volumes have also been produced in book form. These began as collections of the best general articles in a numbered series '\"Fine Woodworking\" Techniques' (8 volumes from 1985 to 1986). Later there were more strongly-themed \"Best of Fine Woodworking\" collections on particular topics such as: \"Joinery\", \"Making and Modifying Machines\", \"Bending Wood\", \"Woodshop Specialities\" and many others.\nTaunton also operates a website for Fine Woodworking.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
