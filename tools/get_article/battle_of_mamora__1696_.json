The Portuguese left the battle victorious after repelling several Muslim vessels.\nBackground\nThe ports of Mamora and Salé were pirate havens that constantly threatened the Portuguese coast. To counter this, the Portuguese sent their navy to block those ports, most likely in the spring of 1694.\nOn August 12, the ship São Boaventura and the frigates Nossa Senhora do Pilar and Nossa Senhora Penha de França reached Salé under the command of Captain Francisco Carvalho.\nWhile São Boaventura blocked Salé, the frigates were sent to block Mamora. At the end of August, Penha de França and Pilar engaged in combat with a ship from Algeria, which was trying to leave the port. São Boaventura quickly came to aid the Portuguese and after a few hours of intense fighting, the Algerian ship was captured.\nBattle\nThe blockade of the ports of Salé and Mamora probably continued in the following years and in the summer of 1696, Nossa Senhora Penha de França, which was patrolling Mamora, was attacked by many Moroccan vessels, but it managed to repel them.\nSee also\n*Moroccan-Portuguese conflicts\n*Battle of Mamora (1515)\nReferences"
