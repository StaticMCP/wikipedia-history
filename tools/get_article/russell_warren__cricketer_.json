He was a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper.\nAs a youth he toured New Zealand with England Young Cricketers in the 1990–91 season, playing two test matches and two one day internationals. He also played two youth ODIs against Australia the following summer, opening the batting with future county colleague Mal Loye.\nHe made his first team debut for his home-county Northamptonshire in 1992, and played for the county in 109 first-class matches over ten seasons. During this time he made ten centuries, with a highest score of 201 not out, but only reached the landmark of 1000 runs in a season once; in 2001.\nRussell left Northamptonshire at the end of the 2002 season to join Nottinghamshire whom he represented from 2003-2006. Despite scoring five first-class centuries in this period, he was released at the end of the 2006 season.\nRussell took up umpiring and was added to the ECB First-Class Panel in 2018.
