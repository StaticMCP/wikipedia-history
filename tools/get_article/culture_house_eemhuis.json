The building houses cultural organizations including: a library, institutes of education, a school for arts, and spaces for art exhibition.\nHistory\nIn 2013 Michiel Riedijk of Neutelings Riedijk Architects was the architect for the Eemhuis. The builders were Euramax, Harry van Interieurbouw, IFS-SGT, and Q-railing: the building was completed in 2014.\nIn order to build the Eemhuis the municipality had to buy out a 30 lease from a tenant who had rights to the property. The construction also had a 5 million dollar cost overrun.\nThe front of the building has three cantilevered sections which hang over a plaza entrance. The structure houses a library, a school of the arts, and large exhibition spaces. On the first floor of the building there is a 5500 m library: considered one of the most beautiful of the 154 libraries in the Netherlands. Each of the cantilevered sections is used for different departments: music, arts and theatre. Community archives are found in the center of the building.\nSee also\n*Lindenberg Nijmegen Culture House\n*Hollandsche Schouwburg\n*Royal Theater Carré\n*Flint (theatre)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O_7u894Zdo Opening of the Eemhuis]"
