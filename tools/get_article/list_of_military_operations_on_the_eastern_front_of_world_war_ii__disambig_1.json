      "text": "# List of military operations on the Eastern Front of World War II__disambig_1\n\nThis is a list of military operations in Europe on the Eastern Front of World War II. These were operations by Germany and its allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its allies on the other and were a consequence of the German invasion in 1941. The geographic boundaries have blurred edges. Finland, classed elsewhere as a \"Nordic\" country, participated in Barbarossa but later fought against German troops (see Military operations in Scandinavia and Iceland during World War II). Yugoslavia, for much of the war, was part of operations in southern Europe but it was liberated by the Red Army. In the cases of Finland and Yugoslavia, therefore, operations are likely to be entered in different lists, depending on the protagonists - not geography. Soviet operations in Iran will be listed in the List of World War II military operations.\nEastern Front\nAxis\nIn alphabetic order\n* Aktion 24 (1945)  &mdash; largely unsuccessful attempts to use Mistels and explosive-laden Do 24s to destroy strategic river bridges\n* Aster (1944)  &mdash; withdrawal from Estonia.\n* Barbarossa (\"Red Beard\" was the nickname for Emperor Frederick I) (1941)       &mdash; invasion of the Soviet Union.\n** Haifisch (\"Shark\") (1941)  &mdash; deception operation for Barbarossa, feint on Scotland and north-east England from Norway.\n** Harpune (\"Harpoon\") (1941)  &mdash; deception operation for Barbarossa, feint on southern England from France.\n** München (\"Munich\") (1941)   &mdash; joint German-Romanian offensive of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.\n** Taifun (\"Typhoon\") (1941)  &mdash; offensive to capture Moscow before winter.\n* Beowulf I & II (Heroic figure) (1941)  &mdash; two separate plans to assault the Estonian islands of Saaremaa, Hiiumaa and Muhu\n** Nordwind (\"Northern wind\") (1941)   &mdash; Diversionary plan for Beowulf II\n*** Lel (1941)  &mdash; sub-plan of Nordwind\n*** Nau (1941)  &mdash; sub-plan of Nordwind\n*** Stimmung (\"Tendency\") (1941)  &mdash; sub-plan of Nordwind\n** Siegfried (Heroic figure)(1941)  &mdash; German assault on Hiiumaa\n*** Ost (\"East\") (1941)  &mdash; sub-plan of Siegfried\n*** Mitte (\"Middle\") (1941)  &mdash; sub-plan of Siegfried\n*** West (1941)  &mdash; sub-plan of Siegfried\n** Südwind (\"Southern wind\") (1941)  &mdash; Diversionary plan for Beowulf II\n** Weststurm (\"Western Storm\") (1941)  &mdash; naval bombardment in support of Beowulf II\n** Westwind (1941)  &mdash; Diversionary plan for Beowulf II\n** Edelweiss (1942)  &mdash; advance through the Caucasus to the Baku oil fields and Black Sea coast\n** Kreml (\"Kremlin\") (1942)  &mdash; deception operation to conceal southern offensive\n* BLAU (\"BLUE\") (1942)  &mdash; Umbrella name for drive towards southern Soviet Union.\n** Blücher (\"after Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher\") (1942)   &mdash; campaign into the Caucasus\n** Braunschweig  (\"Brunswick\") (1942)  &mdash; drive towards Stalingrad and the Caucasus.\n*** Fischreiher (\"Heron\") (1942)  &mdash; offensive to capture Stalingrad.\n*** Hubertus (1942)  &mdash; attack against Stalingrad\n**** Wintergewitter (\"Winter Storm\") (1942)   &mdash; attempt to relieve encircled 6th Army at Stalingrad by Army Group Don.\n**** Donnerschlag (\"Thunderclap\") (1942)  &mdash; planned breakout of the Sixth Army.\n**** Dietrich (1942)  &mdash; planned counter-attack to relieve Sixth Army using SS panzer divisions Grossdeutschland & Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler.
