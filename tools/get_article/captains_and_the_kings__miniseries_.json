It is an adaptation of the 1972 novel Captains and the Kings by Taylor Caldwell. Like the novel, the miniseries is about an Irish American family, headed by ambitious Irish immigrant Joseph Armagh (played by Richard Jordan), which accumulates economic and political power during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nPlot\nThe story begins when Joseph Armagh, a poor Irish immigrant, arrives in New York in 1857, and ends when his last son dies in 1912. Armagh gains wealth and power after investing in the early oil industry. He becomes obsessed with having one of his sons get elected as the first Irish Catholic U.S. president, but that desire is unfulfilled, for his politician son, Rory, is assassinated.\nCast\nMain\n* Richard Jordan as Joseph Armagh\n* Harvey Jason as Harry Zieff\n* Patty Duke as Bernadette Hennessey Armagh\n* Blair Brown as Elizabeth Healey Hennessey\n* Robert Vaughn as Charles Desmond\n* Perry King as Rory Armagh\n* Katherine Crawford as Mary Armagh\n* Jane Seymour as Marjorie Chisholm\n* Bernard Behren as Gentleman\n* Cynthia Sikes as Claudia\n* Charles Durning as Ed Healey\n* David Huffman as Sean Armagh\n* Terry Kiser as Courtney Wickersham\n* Vic Morrow as Tom Hennessey\n* Barbara Parkins as Martinique\n* Joanna Pettet as Katherine Hennessey\n* Doug Heyes Jr. as Kevin Armagh\n* Jenny Sullivan as Honora Houlihan\n* Beverly D'Angelo as Miss Emmy\nSupporting\n* Peter Donat as Clair Montrose\n* Henry Fonda as Sen.
