He served as Presiding Bishop longer than any other person in the history of the LDS Church.\nBiography\nBorn to Edward Hunter and Hannah Maris in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, Hunter was engaged in the mercantile business near Philadelphia from 1816 to 1822 and was married to Ann Standley in 1830. Hunter served in the United States Cavalry for seven years, and as Delaware County commissioner for three years. During this time, Hunter identified as a Swedenborgian.\nHunter converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1840, served as bishop of the Nauvoo 5th Ward from 1844 to 1846, and made significant financial contributions to the early church. He migrated to the Salt Lake Valley in 1846–47 and served as the bishop of the Salt Lake City 13th Ward from 1849 to 1854. Hunter was elected to the Utah Territorial Assembly on November 15, 1851, and served one term.\nHunter was called as Presiding Bishop by LDS Church president Brigham Young in 1851. Young and Heber C. Kimball served as Hunter's informal counselors for more than five years until Hunter formally called Leonard W. Hardy and Jesse Carter Little to these positions.\nAs ex officio president of the church's Aaronic priesthood, Hunter laid the southwest cornerstone of the Salt Lake Temple on April 6, 1853.\nHunter died at Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, and was buried at the Salt Lake City Cemetery.\nSee also\n* Council on the Disposition of the Tithes\n* George Goddard (Mormon)\nReferences\n* — a sermon delivered by Hunter after laying the southwest cornerstone of the Salt Lake Temple\n*[https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=119872 Edward Hunter Homestead Historical Marker (hmdb.org)]\n* : brief biography\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120104215526/http://josephsmithpapers.org/person?name=Edward+Hunter Biography] of Edward Hunter, The Joseph Smith Papers (accessed January 9, 2012)\n*"
