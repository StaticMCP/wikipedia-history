Russian Imperial army, smaller in number, defeated the Persian troops and captured the spoils.\nBackground\nIn March 1812, the British ambassador to Persia signed a peace treaty to ally the country with Persia. In the same year, Napoleon's troops invaded Russia. The Russian Empire tried to make peace with Persia but were unable to come to an agreement.\nBattle\nThe Persian commander Fath Ali Shah stationed his forces, led by his two heirs, Abbas Mirza and Dowlatshah, in Aslanduz. Russian forces under the command of Major General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky launched a surprise night attack and routed the Persians, who were still sleeping. Kotlyarevsky then quickly moved on to storm Lankaran successfully in early 1813 which ended any Persian hope of continuing the war or settling on a stalemate for both parties.\nThe Persian casualties numbered around 2,000 killed and 500 captured. The Russians lost 38 men with 99 wounded. Among those killed during the battle was Charles Christie, a British officer in the service of Iran.\nSee also\n* Battle of Sultanabad\n* Siege of Lankaran\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*"
