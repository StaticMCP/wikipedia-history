Madison is described as intelligent and willful to the point she sometimes becomes forceful. She is quick to adapt to the new world. Highly domineering, Madison likes being in control of situations, and is prone to feeling tense during disagreements with others or in situations where she is largely powerless. Even though she usually maintains a stubborn demeanor, Madison often becomes afraid and uncertain when the people she cares about (especially her family) are in danger. She has shown to have a ruthlessly dark and uncaring side.\nTravis Manawa\nTravis Manawa, portrayed by Cliff Curtis, is a former English teacher who divorced from his wife Elizabeth Ortiz and had to deal with the resentment of his troubled son Chris. Travis later became engaged to guidance counselor Madison Clark and integrated himself into her family including her two children, Nick and Alicia. Travis is a good-natured man and loving father, a protective, pragmatic and resolute individual who holds a firm personal conviction and belief that everything can be fixed, one way or another. He has been described as \"the one character who desperately tries to cling to his humanity, the one person who believes that there is always a way to repair something that is broken and that a corner will always be turned\" and \"a good man trying to do right by everyone in his life\". He holds a strong belief that civilization will eventually be rebuilt.\nNick Clark\nNick Clark, portrayed by Frank Dillane, is the son of Madison Clark and Steven Clark, who died a few years before the apocalypse, and the brother of Alicia Clark. Nick has had a troubled past and has always chosen the wrong road. He is very down to earth but flawed individual with severe addictions to drugs, specifically heroin. Despite his flaws, Nick is a very intelligent young man, and is shown to care for his immediate family and eventually the family of his mother's boyfriend Travis after some reluctance. He is quite intelligent and quick thinking, such as being the first member of the group to realize that the infected aren't infected, but rather dead, going as far as to prevent Alicia from visiting Matt, as he knew he would already be dead and attack her. However he can be selfish at times, such as taking Griselda Salazar's oxycontin which she was using due to her injury.\nAlicia Clark\nAlicia Clark, portrayed by Alycia Debnam-Carey, is the daughter of Madison and Steven Clark, who died a few years before the apocalypse. She is the younger sister of Nick Clark. She was a formerly high-ranking member and resident of the Broke Jaw Ranch community as she becomes a de facto co-leader, and briefly had a relationship with Jake Otto.\nLiza Ortiz\nElizabeth \"Liza\" Ortiz, portrayed by Elizabeth Rodriguez, is a main character in the first two seasons of Fear the Walking Dead. Liza is the ex-wife of Travis Manawa and the mother of Chris Manawa. Liza is a described as a \"Latino-American and one of many LA residents dealing with the start of the outbreak\". Following her and Travis's divorce, Chris blames his father for their separation.\nLiza is killed off in the first-season finale when Travis shoots her out of mercy after being bitten by a walker. After her death, Chris is shown to be even more angered and traumatized and blames his father Travis. On the beach, Liza reveals to Madison that she had been bitten. Liza pleads with Madison and Travis to euthanize her before she turns. Travis promises to protect Chris before shooting Liza. The group holds a funeral for Liza and buries her at sea. However, Chris reacts violently and blames Travis for her death.\nOfelia Salazar\nOfelia Salazar, portrayed by Mercedes Mason, is the daughter of Daniel and Griselda Salazar. After the death of her mother and apparent loss of her father, Ofelia becomes much more distant. Ofelia is described as being born in El Salvador and immigrating to Los Angeles with her parents when she was a baby. She is strong, independent, beautiful; professional but fierce, protective of her parents whom she feels are backwards. In Season 3, Ofelia is bitten by a walker, and she dies of the bite infection in \"El Matadero\" moments before she can be reunited with her father. In Season 7, Daniel's mental breakdown results in him believing that Ofelia is still alive and he has to find her with the episode \"Ofelia\" being named after her. Daniel eventually reveals that his confusion comes from his guilt over not being able to make amends with his daughter and be honest about his past. Daniel is eventually snapped out of it by Strand and Alicia and he finally accepts Ofelia's death.\nChris Manawa\nChris Manawa, portrayed by Lorenzo James Henrie, is the teenage son of Travis Manawa and Liza Ortiz. Christopher was shown to be a normal, highly intelligent teenager before the apocalypse occurred, though he did appear to be extremely angered at his father for leaving and seemed to hold this against him for the rest of his life. Chris slowly adapted to the apocalypse in the beginning and retained his kind side, though after the death of his mother, he is shown to be even more angered and traumatized. But later on during the apocalypse, Chris takes a dramatic turn for the worse and is shown to be angered at his father, distant from everyone and has turned into a noticeably colder individual. He is shown to willing allow members of his own group to die as shown when he almost allows Madison to be killed by walkers and threatens to kill Alicia if she tells of what happened. After separating from his father, Chris is killed by his new companions after he injures himself in a car accident. A furious Travis brutally beats Chris' killers to death with his own bare hands in revenge.\nDaniel Salazar\nDaniel Salazar, portrayed by Rubén Blades, is the husband of Griselda and the father of Ofelia. He is Lola Guerrero's former chief security officer at the Gonzalez Dam. Daniel is a highly intelligent, caring, cautious and formidable man who is a strong, determined survivor. Daniel's past as a secret agent of the Salvadoran Junta and CIA has revealed him to be a highly trained killer, having directly killed 100 people himself (with many more killed indirectly). His training and survival skills have shaped him into a formidable combatant. He is highly adept with firearms and hands to hand combat. Daniel is also shown to be a skilled torturer with extensive knowledge of interrogation techniques and is willing, albeit reluctantly, to use this skill when he feel it is necessary to survive, as seen when he brutally tortured Andrew Adams. Daniel however does not appear to be pleased with the past atrocities he has committed or was forced to commit, and regrets being the monster that he was forced to become. Despite his murderous past, Daniel has demonstrated that he cares about his family more than anything else and is a loving husband and father who vowed to give his daughter the best life possible. Daniel was shown to be devastated by the loss of his beloved wife, the anchor that kept him stable. He subsequently came unhinged for a time and nearly killed himself. Daniel is extremely cautious around those he does not trust, such as Victor Strand and appears to be highly skilled at identifying a potential threat. While under the leadership of Dante Esquivel, Daniel briefly re-embraces his cruel nature but ultimately turns on Dante and his men, saving his allies from certain death, demonstrating that he will never harm the innocent again and that he is ready to kill a threat without any hesitation.\nIn December 2018, it was reported that Rubén Blades would return in season 5 as Daniel Salazar.\nVictor Strand\nVictor Strand, portrayed by Colman Domingo, is a mysterious character who has acquired great personal wealth as immediately indicated by his suit and jewelry, then later by his gated coast-side estate, Aston Martin and luxury yacht, the Abigail. He appears to already have some knowledge of the outbreak and how it manifests itself in humans. It is unknown how long he was imprisoned at the temporary hospital set up in Raynard Community College before Nick arrived. He is calm and does not panic when confronting the walkers, even when he was trapped at the end of a locked corridor as a herd approached. He appears to have adapted quickly to the new world, telling Nicholas Clark that the only way to survive a mad world is to embrace the madness. Victor has a good sense of judgement, believing that Nick has the skills to survive, identifying his heroin addiction as a precursor to the behavior necessary for survival. Strand later joined Madison and her group.\nAlex\nAlex, portrayed by Michelle Ang, is a pragmatic and quiet survivor of Asian descent introduced in the Fear the Walking Dead: Flight 462 web series. Alex appears to have more knowledge about the infection than others. When a dangerous situation occurs she is quick to take rational steps to stop it, even if others dislike or are confused about her actions. After the plane crashed, she went to great lengths to protect a severely injured Jake from dying, decisively killing two passengers who tried to harm him. Strand dashes to the stern and swiftly hacks the rope attaching a raft, abandoning Alex and Jake in the middle of the ocean. Alex is seen again when Travis is imprisoned on Connor's ship. She explains to Travis that Connor rescued her after Jake died. She blames Travis for being cut away from The Abigail, which felt like a death warrant to her. Her fate is left unknown.\nLuciana Galvez\nLuciana Galvez, portrayed by Danay García is Nick's girlfriend and a former scout for La Colonia, a survivor community in Tijuana, Baja California and was briefly a resident of the Broke Jaw Ranch community. She later joins the Dell Diamond baseball stadium community and is a member of Morgan Jones' group.\nIn season 3, Nick and an injured Luciana are taken captive by Troy Otto and his men. The two inadvertently cause the base to become overrun by the undead, but they are reunited with Nick's family and friends. With Luciana having been left unconscious from her worsening condition, Nick successfully forces the Otto family to treat her and she eventually recovers from her injuries. However, Luciana decides to leave Nick and the Broke Jaw Ranch in order to return to Mexico and seek out any survivors of her people.\nBy the start of season 4 two years later, Luciana has been reunited with Nick and has resumed her romantic relationship with him. However, their community at the Dell Diamond baseball stadium is destroyed by a massive attack by the Vultures, apparently killing everyone aside from Luciana, Nick, Strand and Alicia. The group seek revenge, leading them to briefly come into conflict with Morgan Jones and his new friends John Dorie and Al. While seeking revenge upon Ennis alone, Nick is killed in retaliation by a young girl named Charlie, devastating Luciana. After successfully getting revenge upon the Vultures and being stopped from killing Charlie, Luciana falls into a depression and is left somewhat aimless. Following a massive hurricane, Luciana meets the mysterious Polar Bear who, before dying, inspires her to continue his work of helping other people.\nIn season 5, Luciana joins the rest of Morgan's group in their mission to aid other survivors. However, she is badly injured in a plane crash in the season premiere and she spends an extended period of time recovering from her shoulder wound. After discovering Polar Bear's Tank Town oil fields, Luciana remains there producing oil until Logan and his gang invade. When Virginia and her Pioneers take over, Luciana agrees to show them how to make the gas in exchange for the others being allowed to leave with a tanker full of gas. She is later brought to Humbug's Gulch where she tries to reassure her friends as they are captured by Virginia's group.\nIn season 6, Luciana continues to run Tank Town for Virginia until it is destroyed by a doomsday cult. After Virginia's defeat, Luciana moves to Morgan's new community where she accompanies Alicia, Al and Wes on their reconnaissance mission into the cult's base, the Holding. After the cult successfully launches ten nuclear warheads, Luciana joins Daniel, Wes, Sarah, Jacob, Charlie and Rollie in seeking shelter from the coming destruction. Realizing that Rollie is a traitor who has sold them out, Daniel asks Luciana for her gun before executing the man with it. As Daniel has been proven to have been right, Luciana backs him up about the coordinates that he had heard over the radio which turn out to have come from Al who has sent her CRM pilot friend Isabelle to rescue the group. As they fly away, Luciana reassures Daniel that he just needs a little help and that as long as they stick together, they will be fine.\nIn season 7, Luciana works with Daniel on his mental issues, forming a close bond with him. However, Daniel becomes convinced that his daughter Ofelia is still alive and wanders off, causing Daniel, Luciana and Wes to get captured by the Stalkers, leading to a lot of frustration between the group. After Daniel brutally kills Arno, the leader of the Stalkers, Luciana is able to convince the rest to join their fight against Strand and his forces at the Tower. With Luciana having witnessed him at his worst and still only expressed nothing but acceptance and understanding, an emotional Daniel declares that they might not be blood, but he and Luciana are family from now on. However, after Daniel reveals that only the thought that Ofelia is still alive keeps him going, Luciana lies to him that Ofelia is in Strand's Tower as she believes that they need Daniel's help to win against Strand and that it is the only way to get it. Disgusted by Luciana's actions, Wes abandons the group for Strand and Luciana sticks to her lie even though Daniel warns her that it could break him for good if he discovers that Ofelia really isn't in the Tower. When Daniel finally gets into the Tower, he learns the truth from Strand who attempts to continue Luciana's lie using Charlie. However, Strand, Alicia and Charlie are finally able to snap Daniel out of it and back to normal. Subsequently, Daniel seems to be more confused by Luciana's actions than hurt or angry about them. Luciana apologizes to her friend for what she did, but their conversation is interrupted when they are forced to take cover from gunfire.\nIn season 8, Daniel has been separated from Luciana and Charlie by PADRE. After reuniting with Madison seven years after the destruction of the Tower, Daniel tells her that he doesn't know what became of them and neither does Morgan. Following the defeat of the Krennick siblings, Daniel and Madison are finally reunited with Luciana and Charlie who have been running a refinery operation for PADRE and using their resources to continue Polar Bear's work with Luciana even taking on the moniker of Polar Bear herself. Luciana reveals that she had only agreed to work for PADRE if they would release Daniel who the organization had seen as being too old to be of any use and had planned to kill him. However, the reunion turns bittersweet when the conflict with Troy Otto leads to the death of Charlie and a number of Luciana's people. Daniel decides to join Luciana's group as she's the only family that he has left. Following the destruction of PADRE, Luciana continues to lead her operation with Daniel who is unexpectedly reunited with his long-lost cat Skidmark who had been found by Alicia and discreetly returned to Daniel.\nJeremiah Otto\nJeremiah Otto, portrayed by Dayton Callie, is the father of Jake and Troy and the former leader and one of the four founding fathers of the Broke Jaw Ranch community. Described by showrunner Dave Erickson as having a \"certain moral compass\", Jeremiah is \"definitely rough\", with a \"darker and uglier side to him as well, and it's frankly racist\". Erickson has noted that Jeremiah will become \"violent when he has to be\".\nJeremiah is killed off in the third-season episode \"Children of Wrath\", after Nick shoots him due to his lack of co-operation with Qaletaqa Walker.\nJeremiah is first seen walking along the Mexican-American border with his assault rifle, where he sees Ofelia Salazar walking in the desert. He begins shooting at her, firing at her until she hides behind a tree. Soon after, he approaches her and aims his gun at her, asking Ofelia to hand over her knife, before taking Ofelia away.\nTravis, Madison and Alicia are captured by an armed group and taken to a military compound, where Travis is separated from them and is taken to a basement while Madison and Alicia are taken to an office. At the basement, Travis finds himself with Nick, an injured Luciana and other captives. The captives are shot to see how long it takes for them to turn. Travis, Luciana, and Nick attempt to escape, Travis and Luciana descending into a sewer but Travis is re-captured and made to fight the dead in a pit. Meanwhile, Madison and Alicia attack Troy, impaling one of his eyes with a spoon and taking him hostage. Madison demands her family released. Nick finds a horde of walkers at the end of the sewer and makes his way back. The family is reunited but the compound is overrun with walkers, forcing everyone to leave. Travis, Luciana and Alicia escape aboard a helicopter while Madison and Nick leave in a truck with Troy.\nTroy Otto\nTroy Otto is a fictional character in the television series Fear the Walking Dead portrayed by Daniel Sharman, he is the youngest son of Jeremiah Otto and Jake's half-brother. Troy was a formerly high-ranking member of the Broke Jaw Ranch community. He is described as having a \"wild temperament\" and being \"charismatic with a cruel streak\".\nDescribed as having \"embraced the violence of the apocalypse\", with his \"isolationist viewpoint\" of being \"intensely suspicious of outsiders\" having allowed him to be \"better-suited for leading in this new post-apocalyptic world\", after having a hateful mother and drunk negligent father. Troy is the last surviving member of his family, as well as the last survivor of Broke Jaw Ranch.\nTravis, Madison and Alicia are captured by an armed group and taken to a military compound, where Travis is separated from them and is taken to a basement while Madison and Alicia are taken to an office. At the basement, Travis finds himself with Nick, an injured Luciana and other captives. The captives are shot to see how long it takes for them to turn. Travis, Luciana, and Nick attempt to escape, Travis and Luciana descending into a sewer but Travis is re-captured and made to fight the dead in a pit. Troy enters a locked office where Madison and Alicia are being held. He offers them tea and seems hospitable, until he starts interrogating them. Madison explains to Troy that she's looking for her son, Nick. Madison then demands to know where they've taken Travis. Troy avoids answering, but promises to let them go once he's finished \"processing\" them. He takes an interest in Madison. She impales one of his eyes with a spoon and takes him hostage, demanding her family's release. Nick finds a horde of walkers at the end of the sewer and makes his way back. The family is reunited and Jake chastises Troy for killing innocent people. The Clark's decline Jake's invitation to Broke Jaw Ranch, but the compound is overrun with walkers, forcing everyone to leave. Travis, Luciana and Alicia escape aboard a helicopter with Jake and Charlene while Madison and Nick leave in a truck with Troy.\nThey reach Broke Jaw Ranch and learn the helicopter did not arrive. Jake, Alicia and Luciana later return to the ranch, the helicopter having been shot down, resulting in Travis's death and leading to Charlene's. Troy, Jake and Jeremiah vow to the ranch they will get justice. Troy expresses contempt for Nick to Madison. Jake warns Troy to leave the Clark family alone. Troy takes Nick on a boar hunt, planning to attack him; instead they begin to become friends. The team investigating the helicopter shooting are overdue; Troy leads a second team with Madison accompanying them. They are ambushed by Native Americans led by Qaletaqa Walker, on whose ancestral land Broke Jaw Ranch is built. They return to the ranch without their weapons or shoes. During the trek back, Troy contemplates killing Madison after she gives unwanted leadership advice. With the threat of the Native Americans invading the ranch, the Trimbol family leave despite Troy's efforts to get them to stay. Troy follows the family and murders them. Troy helps to train the militia. At Madison's insistence, Troy leads a team to rescue Alicia from Black Hat Reservation, breaking a truce and killing several of Walker's men. When Walker's group move onto the ranch, Troy is incensed. He refuses to hand over his weapons leading to a gunfight before Nick convinces him to stand down. Madison convinces Walker not to execute Troy and he is instead exiled.\nAfter being exiled from the ranch, Troy lives off of the land while continuing to write in his journal. He revisits the scene of the helicopter crash, finds a grenade launcher and buries the rancher Walker had disfigured. Troy visits Nick in the night and warns him that the ranch will be destroyed. Nick and Jake set out to find Troy and discover him using the grenade launcher to guide a herd of walking dead toward the ranch. Troy explains that the herd will kill people or force them into the desert, as he was, and only the fittest will survive. Jake holds Troy at gunpoint but hesitates on learning that Nick killed their father and Alicia kept it secret. Jake is bitten and dies following an amputation, and Troy mourns his brother, saying he brought the herd to regain their legacy. A wall of trailers and RVs hope to turn the herd but this fails and the ranchers and natives evacuate to the bunker-like pantry. Troy subsequently joins Nick in an attempt to rescue the survivors from the pantry, but it fails, leaving them trapped until Madison, Strand and Walker arrive to rescue them and Alicia, Ofelia and Crazy Dog, the only survivors of the group that had gone into the pantry.\nFollowing the destruction of the ranch, Troy joins Madison's group with Nick covering up his friend's role in the ranch's destruction. Troy travels with Nick in particular, forming a deep bond with him. However, Troy's actions come to light during the fight for the dam with Troy proving to be unrepentant. Enraged, Madison bashes Troy's head in with a hammer in revenge, seemingly killing him. His body is subsequently washed out with the flood when the dam is destroyed.\nIn season 8, Troy is revealed to have survived both the hammer blows and the flood, although he was left blinded in his left eye as a result. Vengeful, Troy seeks to take PADRE for himself and his people, claiming to have killed Alicia and left her to reanimate. The conflict with Troy leaves Charlie dead before he's revealed to have a daughter named Tracy, born in the years since the dam's destruction. Troy eventually explains to Madison that his wife, Serena, had rescued Troy from the dam's destruction and they fell in love and had Tracy together. Alicia had inspired Serena to help people in need after responding to Troy's distress call when Serena was bitten. However, Serena's death at the hands of a man whom she was trying to help had caused the grief-stricken Troy to blame Alicia and Madison for her loss.

Troy saves Madison's life and even willingly helps to stop the herd, but Madison fatally impales him on Alicia's prosthetic arm, believing that Troy getting a second chance from Alicia had caused her daughter's death. The dying Troy implores Madison to take care of Tracy for him, claiming that Tracy is actually Alicia's daughter whom he had kidnapped. Troy subsequently reanimates, but he is put down and buried by his daughter while Troy's people go through with the attack and destroy PADRE.\nIt's later revealed that Alicia had actually survived Troy's attack on her, and that Troy's people had lied to him about seeing her as a walker, only telling Troy what he had wanted to hear after they couldn't find Alicia aside from signs that she might've survived the fight.
