The book explores the myth of the \"noble savage\" and it demonstrates a long pattern of violence through human history from nearly all parts of the globe.\nContents\nMuch of the book explores debunking the myth of the \"noble savage\", which the evidence of archaeological exploration from around the globe does not support (a peaceful ancient human existence). LeBlanc's data supports that as many as 25% (conservatively estimated) of adult males perished as a direct result of warfare and murder in pre-agricultural times. Chapter 2 titled, \"Was There Ever an Eden?\" explores this notion further.\nAs one review from The Wall Street Journal highlighted: About 1,000 people die in local wars around the world each day. That's two people every three minutes or so, in places like the Balkans, Central Africa and Timor. It may sound like a lot of killing, but in fact the planet has never been more peaceful. The past is much bloodier. LeBlanc explains that resource scarcity leads to war and conflict. Scarcity involving access to reproductive capacity including women, food and water, and the required elements involved in creating and holding shelter. When these resources become scarce, warfare and bloodshed tend towards becoming increasingly likely.\nIn the \"Was There Ever an Eden?\" chapter, LeBlanc demonstrates evidence, such as the \"Buffalo jump\", where hundreds to thousands of buffalo would be driven off a cliff, with only some of the killed being able to be used or harvested for their meat and hides, to show that Native and Indigenous persons in the Americas were often very wasteful in their hunting practices, and that it is a myth that such groups and cultures were \"conservationists\" with regard to all of their interactions with nature, wildlife, and their ecology.\nReception\nThe book received mostly positive reviews including from Scientific American, The Washington Times, The Harvard Crimson, and National Review.\nSee also\n*War Before Civilization by Lawrence H.
