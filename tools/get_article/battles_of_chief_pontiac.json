Wollstein gave the film a mixed review, writing, \"Burly actor Lon Chaney, Jr. said that the role of Chief Pontiac in this cheap action-thriller from low-budget entrepreneur Jack Broder, was one he truly coveted. Unfortunately, Chaney and the rest of the cast were let down by a preachy and frankly dreadful screenplay by Jack de Witt ... Battles of Chief Pontiac was filmed on location near Rapid City, South Dakota, and the scenery remains its only attractive feature.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110222223945/http://www.hulu.com/watch/213602/battles-of-chief-pontiac Battles of Chief Pontiac] film at Hulu (free and complete)"
