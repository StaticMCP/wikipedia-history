In their seventh season under head coach Harvey Harman, the Queensmen compiled a 7–2 record, won the Middle Three Conference championship, and outscored their opponents 224 to 130.\nOn October 16, 1948, Rutgers defeated Princeton, 22-6, in front of a crowd of 41,000 at Palmer Stadium in Princeton, New Jersey. This was the first Rutgers victory at Princeton in 79 years of play between the two schools, ending what the Associated Press called \"the oldest jinx in intercollegiate football history.\"\nRutgers was ranked at No. 58 in the final Litkenhous Difference by Score System ratings for 1948.\nSchedule\n|October 2||Colgate|Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, NJ|W 34-19|16,000 |\n|October 9||Temple|Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, NJ|W 34-20|13,000 |\n|October 16|at|Princeton|Palmer Stadium|Princeton, NJ (rivalry)|W 22-7| 41,000 |\n|October 23|at|Lehigh|Taylor Stadium|Behtlehem, PA|W 20-6|8,000 |\n|October 30||Brown|Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, NJ|L 6-20|20,000 |\n|November 6||Lafayette|Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, NJ|W 34-13|18,000 |\n|November 13|at|NYU|Yankee Stadium|Bronx, NY|W 40-0|4,000 |\n|November 20||Fordham|Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, NJ|W 28-19|10,000 |\n}}\nReferences"
