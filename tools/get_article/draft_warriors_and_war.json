It is equally for those who wish to acquaint themselves with the greatness of their ancestors, who seek to grasp the depths of warfare, or who aspire to mold themselves into a skilled soldier or warrior.\nA man is not made great by physical strength alone, but also by his knowledge, wisdom, and updated understanding. One who is mentally steadfast and intellectually sharp alone reaches the heights of success in life. For this reason, this book is not confined merely to stories of war and heroism; it also acquaints the reader with the principles of Kshatriya Dharma, ancient methods of warfare, and the modern military strategies of the world’s leading nations.\nThrough this book, the author endeavors that readers should not only immerse themselves in the heroic saga of great figures like Alha and Udal, but also catch a glimpse of the social structure, ideals, and moral struggles of that time. Along with this, the book also sheds light on Indian, Japanese, Israeli, and Chinese war strategies—making the reader realize that the study of both ancient and modern warfare remains equally vital for our lives and the defense of our nation even today.\nIt is the author’s aspiration that this book provides knowledge as well as inspiration—so that readers may learn from the valor of the past, apply it to the present, and contribute to the safety and prosperity of the nation."
