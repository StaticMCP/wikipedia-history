Moreover, he truly considered himself the successor of the one who tried to unify the Georgian lands, and the loss of the Kingdom of Kakheti-Hereti led him to seek new domains in the southwest. This is how he thinks of the Tao, ancient Kingdom of the Georgians and hereditary domain of the first Bagrations, which had been bequeathed by will to Emperor Basil II by David III Kurapalates as the term of a punishment due to the support of the latter for the rebel Bardas Phokas, and part of which was offered by Byzantine Empire to Bagrat III.\nSince the year 1000, Basil II has been in total war against the Bulgarians, and therefore has little time to take care of Georgia. For this reason, George I invaded the contested heritage for the first time in 1014/1016, without receiving a direct military response from the emperor. However, Aristakes Lastivertsi reports an epistolary exchange between Basil and the Georgian king. In it, it says:\n}}\nBattle\nFollowing this refusal, Basil II intervened directly, despite his difficulties in Bulgaria, but the renewal of the alliance between Georgia and the main enemy of Byzantine Empire, the Fatimid Caliphate (against whom the Byzantine emperor had led a war between 992 and 995), repels the Greek troops for the first time. However, in 1018, Bulgaria was completely subject to Byzantine Empire. The Bulgarian Tsar Prousjanos II was dethroned and Bulgaria was made a province of the Byzantine Empire. A little later, the Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah died and his son Al-Zahir li-I'zaz Din Allah, too inexperienced to think about Georgia, succeeded him. George I found himself alone again in the international framework and the Basileus sent all his troops against him. The two armies then meet on the plains of Basiani, in Tao, but George I retreats, burns the town of Oltisi to divert the path of the Greeks, before being caught at Cola. Not far from there, at the village of Shirimni, the Georgian rearguard was attacked by the Byzantine vanguard, following which a fierce battle ensued on September 11, 1021, a battle won with difficulty by Basil's troops II, who is also present himself at the heart of the battlefield, after the death of the greatest Georgian generals of the time. The Georgian troops quickly left the region to take refuge in Samtskhe, but the Byzantines still pursued them and ravaged Javakheti, before burning the town of Artaani.\nSee also\n* Byzantine–Georgian wars\n* Battle of Svindax\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* .\n*"
