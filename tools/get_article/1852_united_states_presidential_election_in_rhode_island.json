Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.\nRhode Island voted for the Democratic candidate, Franklin Pierce, over the Whig Party candidate, Winfield Scott. Pierce won the state by a margin of 6.52%. This was the first of three times that the state voted differently than Massachusetts (along with 1972 and 1980).\nThis would be the final time until 1912 that a Democratic presidential candidate was able to win Rhode Island and the final time until 1928 that a Democratic candidate won a majority of the popular vote.\nResults\n}}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Rhode Island\nReferences"
