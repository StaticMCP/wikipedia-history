It is endemic to Fiji, where it occurs on most of the medium and large islands.\nIts natural habitats are mature tropical moist lowland forests and tropical moist montane forest. The species is one of two imperial-pigeons found in Fiji; the other, the Pacific imperial pigeon, is found on smaller islands.\nDescription\nThe barking imperial pigeon is frugivorous, feeding on large fruits of the trees Cananga, Didymocheton, and Myristica'' (nutmegs).
