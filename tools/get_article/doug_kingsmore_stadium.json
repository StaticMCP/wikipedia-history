It is the home of the Clemson Tigers baseball team.\nOpened  in 1970, it has a record single-game attendance of 6,891 (set on February 28, 2025 against South Carolina). Doug Kingsmore has ranked in the top 20 in attendance for 15 consecutive seasons. The Tigers have an .809 winning percentage in games played there all time and are  in NCAA tournament games there since the NCAA changed its post-season format in 1999 (with a  record in NCAA tournament games all time).\nThe stadium is notable for not having a traditional dirt warning track outlining the boundaries of the field, instead featuring a slight uphill grade leading to the wall in the outfield.\nHistory\nRenaming\nFormer Clemson baseball player and Board of Trustees Emeritus Doug Kingsmore gave the Clemson athletic department a $1 million gift towards renovation of Clemson's baseball stadium, formerly known as Tiger Field. George Bennett, former executive director of IPTAY, made the announcement in 2000. Bennett also announced that the facility would be called Doug Kingsmore Stadium.\nPostseason\nThe stadium has hosted three Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournaments (1976, 1977, 1978), 17 NCAA regionals (1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2023, 2024, 2025), and five NCAA super regionals (2000, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2024).\nRenovations\nRenovations to Doug Kingsmore Stadium began in the summer of 2002. The design was done by HOK Sport (now Populous) and construction by Yeargin Potter Shackelford Construction. The stadium has a brick facade that surrounds every entrance. A green roof that covers much more of the stands and a press box that is twice as large adds to the comfort of fans attending the game and the media covering it. The press box, which is accessible by elevator, includes four large booths for broadcasting and a separate media center that accommodates 13 writers.\nThere is also a patio area outside the press box that is above the existing stands along the first and third-base lines. It is used for receptions and other events throughout the year.\nTwo ticket booths, concession stands with an adjoining picnic area, and enlarged restrooms make the facility easily accessible and fan-friendly. Reserved seats were also added to the grandstand. A grand stairway leading from the McFadden parking lot to the main entrance is an added feature from a convenience and aesthetic aspect.\nThe players also realize improvements, as four batting cages have been constructed beyond the right-field fence. The dugouts have been almost doubled in length and width. And the players have a newly renovated locker room and lounge.\nPrior to 2005, PawVision, the giant replay screen that was used in the football stadium (1997–2004), was moved to Doug Kingsmore Stadium.\nThe facility is also equipped with a Super Sopper, which cuts down on rainouts. Clemson is one of a few schools with this machine that removes water from the field.\nNew Stadium Features:\n*Ornamental metal fence\n*Plaza area\n*Brick façade\n*Overhanging roof\n*Enlarged & temperature-controlled press box\n*Patio areas above the stands\n*Ticket booths\n*Enlarged concession stands\n*Enlarged restrooms\n*Chair-back seats\n*Left-field grandstand\n*Grand stairway entrance with Hall of Fame area\n*Indoor batting cages\n*Enlarged dugouts\n*V.I.P. parking lot and drop-off\n*\"PawVision\" giant replay screen\nThe diamond has an unorthodox southerly alignment (home plate to center field); the recommended orientation is }} The elevation of the field is approximately  above sea level.\nAttendance\nIn 2020, the Tigers ranked ninth among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 4,311 per home game.
