The revolution, which was initially sparked by widespread public protests and calls for reform, led to major changes in Bangladesh's political landscape.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the revolution, the country faced violent unrest, a constitutional crisis and the formation of the interim government. These events prompted further protests and calls for reform, as well as extensive investigations. The entire period marked a pivotal moment in the nation's history, as it reshaped the country's governance, legal framework, and social fabric.\nViolence and destruction\nDomestic\nOn 5 August 2024, following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh experienced widespread violence targeting political establishments, minority communities, and significant cultural sites. In Dhaka, the Awami League’s headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue and the Jatiya Party central office in Bijoy Nagar were attacked and set ablaze by unidentified assailants.\nBetween August and December 2024, reports emerge of violence against minority communities, particularly Hindus and Ahmadiyyas. Reports indicate that over 2,200 incidents of violence occurred during this period, including attacks on 152 temples resulting in the death of 23 individuals. The attacks drew condemnation from Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, who urged the interim government to \"take decisive action\" to protect minority communities. Particular incidents, such as the Hazari Lane violence in Chattogram and the Murder of Saiful Islam Alif is perceived to be some of the cause of these violence.\nOn the evening of 5 February 2025, a large group of protesters gathered at Dhanmondi 32, responding to calls on social media for a \"Bulldozer March\" aimed at demolishing the site, which they referred to as a \"shrine of fascism\". The protest escalated quickly, with participants breaking through the entrance and vandalizing the interior, including the destruction of a mural of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The demolition coincided with a speech delivered by Sheikh Hasina from exile in India. In her address, she urged her supporters to oppose the interim government, labeling it as \"unconstitutional\", as well as saying, \"[They] may destroy a building, but they won't be able to erase the history\" referring to the previous vandalism of the site.\nFollowing the speech, Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the Anti-discrimination Students Movement on a facebook status update stated,\nSeveral civil society members and political organisations condemned the vandalism, while the press wing of the chief adviser referred it as \"unexpected and undesirable\" and stating it as a \"manifestation of anger triggered by Sheikh Hasina's provocative remarks against the July uprising\".\nOn 7 February 2025, protesters launched an attack on the house of AKM Mozammel Haque, former Minister of Liberation War Affairs, as a part of the Bulldozer March, during which an unidentified individual at a local mosque announced that people were attacking the former minister's home, leading locals to attack the protesters. 15 individuals were injured in the attack and one later succumbed to his injuries. In response to the escalating violence, the interim government launched a nationwide crackdown dubbed \"Operation Devil Hunt\". By 10 February 2025, security forces had arrested over 1,300 individuals suspected of involvement in the unrest. The Adviser of Home Affairs, Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, vowed that operations would continue \"until we uproot the devils\".\nAbroad\nFollowing incidents of violence against minorities, a Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, also known as Krishna Das Prabhu, emerged as a lead figure in the Hindu rights movement. On 25 November 2024, Das was arrested from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on charges of sedition. His arrest was based on allegations that he and others had disrespected Bangladesh's national flag by hoisting a saffron flag above it during a Hindu rights rally in Chittagong in October 2024. This act was perceived as a challenge to national sovereignty and is criminalized under Article 123A of Bangladesh Penal Code.\nIn response to Das's arrest, on 2 December 2024, members of the Hindu Sangharsh Samity, a far-right Hindutva group affiliated with the Vishva Hindu Parishad, forcibly entered the premises of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala, Tripura. The attackers vandalized property and set fire to the Bangladeshi national flag. The incident reportedly took place in the presence of local law enforcement, who did not intervene.\nThe Government of Bangladesh condemned the attack, describing it as \"pre-planned\" and a violation of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. In protest, Bangladesh summoned the Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka to formally express its concerns. In response, India's Ministry of External Affairs described the incident as \"deeply regrettable\" and assured to address the situation. Later, seven individuals were detained on suspicion of being involved in the attack and three policemen posted at the Assistant High Commission area were suspended for alleged negligence in duty.\nInterim government formation\nFollowing the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, Chief of Army Staff General Waker-uz-Zaman and President Mohammed Shahabuddin announced the formation of an interim government to stabilize the political situation. The president initiated discussions with political leaders and dissolved the parliament on 6 August 2024, invoking emergency provisions under Article 72(1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh, which allows the dissolution of parliament before its full term.\nThe Anti-discrimination Students Movement, lead organization of the uprising, proposed economist and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, then residing in Paris, to head the interim government. After deliberations, Yunus accepted the proposal, and the government was formally finalized on 7 August 2024. Yunus was sworn in as the Chief Adviser to the interim government on 8 August 2024 in Dhaka. Sixteen others were also sworn in as advisers to the cabinet of the interim government.\nConstitutional crisis\nThe formation of the interim government led to an unprecedented constitutional crisis where, the crux of the crisis being in the ambiguity of the constitutional provisions regarding the appointment of a non-elected individual, Muhammad Yunus, as head of government. Under Article 56(1) of the Constitution of Bangladesh, the prime minister is required to be a member of parliament, but Yunus did not hold a parliamentary seat, creating significant legal uncertainty about his legitimacy.\nThe dissolution of parliament by President Mohammed Shahabuddin on 6 August 2024 raised further questions. Under emergency provisions in Article 72(1), the president had the authority to dissolve parliament, but critics argued that this provision was never intended to be used as a pretext for removing an elected government and bypassing parliamentary processes.\nSheikh Hasina condemned the formation of the interim government, calling it \"an unconstitutional takeover under the guise of reform\". While her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, also criticized the move, calling it \"a dangerous precedent that undermines democracy\". In a post on social media, he accused foreign influences of backing the government.\nThe Supreme Court of Bangladesh was petitioned to rule on the constitutional validity of the interim government. Article 123 of the existing constitution states that, general elections must be held within 90 days of the dissolution of parliament. In response, Nahid Islam, an adviser to the interim government, announced that a constituent assembly election would be held to draft and adopt a new constitution, following which, the interim government formed a Constitutional Reform Commission to develop a roadmap for the next  constituent assembly election.\nJudicial coup allegations\nOn 10 August 2024, a plenary meeting of the Appellate Division judges was scheduled, a move considered irregular and unconstitutional by many observers, including LDP Secretary-general Redwan Ahmed. This meeting was perceived as a prelude to issuing a ruling that could undermine the interim government and potentially pave the way for Hasina's return.\nHasnat Abdullah, one of the coordinators of the Anti-discrimination Students Movement, called for protests to be held at the Supreme Court premise. Mass protests erupted outside the Supreme Court, with hundreds of students under the banner of Anti-discrimination Students Movement, lawyers, and civil society members demanding Hassan's resignation. They accused him of attempting to use the judiciary to restore Hasina to power, calling him a \"puppet\" of the former regime. Asif Mahmud, one of the  Adviser to the interim government, criticized Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan for convening a full court meeting of the court's Appellate Division without consulting the government and demanded his resignation.\nFollowing the protests, Chief Justice Obaidul Hassan resigned on 10 August 2024. Five other senior judges in Dhaka also resigned, while other judges from cities such as Chattogram, Khulna, and Sylhet followed suit. In total, around twelve judges resigned or were removed as part of the efforts to restore confidence in the judiciary and cleanse it of perceived biases.\nSubsequent protests\nPolice strike\nOn 6 August, the Bangladesh Police Service Association initiated a general strike, demanding enhanced security measures for its members. The association expressed regret for the role of the police force in the unrest and violence. It stated that its officers were \"forced to open fire\", subsequently being portrayed as the \"villain\". Students and several paramilitary personnel were subsequently seen directing traffic and maintaining law and order functions in across the country in the absence of traffic police. While, Bangladesh Air Force personnel were deployed to secure Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport premise. The Inspector-General of Police, Md. Moinul Islam, issued an order for all officers to report for duty by the evening of 8 August. On 11 August, retired Brigadier General M Sakhawat Hossain, serving as the adviser for home affairs in the interim government, appealed to police officers to resume their duties at their respective stations and provided assurances that their demands will be fulfilled. The strike ended on 11 August following a meeting between the association and the interim government. By 15 August, regular operations at all 639 police stations nationwide had resumed.\nBangladesh Bank protest\nOn 7 August, several officials from the Bangladesh Bank initiated a protest near the governor's office with an objective to compel the resignation of certain high-ranking officials due to their alleged involvement in corruption. That same day, one of the bank's deputy governors resigned, with three others expressing their intention to follow suit. On 9 August, the bank's governor, Abdur Rouf Talukder, resigned from his position, citing personal reasons.\nHindu rights protest\nOn 9 August, the Bangladesh Hindu Jagran Mancha organized a protest in Dhaka condemning the attacks on Hindus. The group called for the establishment of a Ministry of Minorities and a Minority Protection Commission, the implementation of strict laws against attacks on minorities, and a 10% quota in parliament for minority groups. Protests against anti-Hindu attacks were also held in Tangail and Khulna.\nAwami League demonstration\nOn 9 August, thousands of Awami League supporters staged a two-hour blockade on a section of the Dhaka–Khulna highway in Gopalganj, demanding Sheikh Hasina's return. The next day, an intervention by the army to disperse the protestors escalated into a confrontation. The clash resulted in 15 individuals being injured and an army vehicle being set ablaze.\nResistance Week\nOn 13 August, the Anti-discrimination Students Movement announced a campaign called \"Resistance Week\", centred around four key demands. These demands included the creation of a special tribunal for the speedy trials of the massacre during the quota reform and non-cooperation movements; justice for the attacks on minorities following Sheikh Hasina's resignation; the removal of government officials who supported the government, opposed the movement and suppressed the activists; and ensuring equality for discriminated officials in government sectors.\nOccupation of Dhanmondi 32\nOn 15 August protesters occupied the Dhanmondi 32 area of Dhaka to prevent Awami League supporters from marching to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's residence to commemorate the anniversary of his assassination in 1975, a day designated by the Hasina administration as a National Day of Mourning. Thirty people were held by protesters on suspicion of association with the Awami League, particularly those who were found to be carrying images of Sheikh Mujibur or other information relating to the Awami League in their possession or on mobile phones. Protesters were also accused of harassing journalists filming the event following complaints by correspondents from Reuters, The New York Times, and other media outlets. An Awami League activist was injured in the incident and later succumbed of his injuries on 30 August.\nBangladesh Nationalist Party also called for a nationwide sit-in on 15 and 16 August, demanding that Sheikh Hasina be put on trial for genocide in connection with the killings of protesters.\nAnsar protest\nOn 25 August 2024, a faction of the Bangladesh Ansar, a paramilitary force responsible for securing government installations and assisting law enforcement, protested at the Bangladesh Secretariat. They demanded the nationalisation of their jobs and the abolition of the six-month \"rest system\", a mandatory leave period after three consecutive years of work. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, Home Affairs Advisor of the interim government, met with the protesters, announcing a preliminary decision to abolish the rest system. He also assured them that a forthcoming committee would review their demand for job nationalisation. Despite this, the Ansar members were dissatisfied due to the lack of immediate guarantees regarding job nationalisation. Later that day, a clash between Ansar members and a group of students resulted in 50 injuries. On 26 August, 303 Ansar members were arrested for unlawful assembly, and nine Deputy Directors and ten Directors of Ansar were transferred from their posts. The DMP prohibited any rallies, meetings, or demonstrations in the vicinity of the Bangladesh Secretariat and the Chief Adviser's residence. One person later died of injuries, they sustained after being caught in the clashes on 4 September.\nJumma protest\nOn 20 September 2024, a protest march was organized by a Jumma students' body, starting from the Raju Sculpture and ending at Shahbag, to protest against the recent violence targeting Jummas in Khagrachhari.\nOn 18 July 2025, a protest march was organised in Chattagram by Jumma bodies protesting the gangrape of a Tripuri girl in Khagracchari by Bengali Muslims affiliated with the BNP.\nPresidential resignation protests\nIn October 2024, during a conversation with Manab Zamin's Chief Editor, Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, the President Mohammed Shahabuddin, quoted that,\n}}\nCiting concerns over the resignation of Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister, and the legality of the interim government as per the existing constitution.\nFollowing the remarks, protests erupted across the country calling for his resignation as the president. Interim government's Adviser for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Asif Nazrul stated that, \"The president's statement that he did not receive Sheikh Hasina's resignation letter is a lie, and it is a violation of his oath.\"\nThe Chief Adviser's Deputy Press Secretary, Apurba Jahangir, during a press briefing at the Foreign Service Academy agreed with Law advisers views and quoted, }}\nAsif Mahmud, the Interim Adviser for the Ministries of Youth and Sports and Labor and Employment, posted on Facebook stating, \"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had verbally communicated her resignation to the President\". He added, while she was initially expected to deliver a formal resignation letter at Bangabhaban, the approach of protesters near Ganabhaban reportedly necessitated her departure from the location. Mahmud questioned the implications of the resignation occurring under these circumstances.\nDuring a roundtable discussion organized by Islami Andolan in Segunbagicha, Sarjis Alam, one of the coordinator of Anti-discrimination Students Movement quoted, }}\nAnother coordinator, Hasnat Abdullah, also posted on social media stating, \"Awami League [as a party] should face justice, a new constitution should be written, corrupt Awami bureaucrats should be sacked, all illegal agreements made during Hasina's tenure should be cancelled, and Chuppu (President) should be removed from the post of president immediately.\"\nNasir Uddin Patwary, convener of the Jatiya Nagorik Committee, also criticised President Shahabuddin, saying, \"Chuppu (President) is part of the fascist regime. He has no right to remain as president, and we will not allow any element of this regime to persist after the mass uprising.\"\nIslamist protests\nIslamism, which had been harshly suppressed by the Hasina regime, saw a resurgence under the Yunus government. In March 2025, Hizb ut Tahrir Bangladesh, a banned Islamist organisation, organised an open demonstration in the capital city of Dhaka, demanding implementation of sharia as the primary law of the land & resumption of khilafat. In May 2025, Islamists organised massive demonstrations against the Women's Affairs Reform Commission's proposals of gender equality.\nReactions in India\nDisinformation\nSensationalist Indian media outlets, especially those closely associated with the ruling party in India, the Bharatiya Janata Party, portrayed the mass uprising as an Islamist-backed military takeover of the country purportedly orchestrated by India's rivals, Pakistan (through its intelligence agency) & China. Following Hasina's resignation, Indian media outlets discredited the student protestors by overemphasising on a solitary incident of one of the many protestors who vandalised the Ganabhaban flashing Hasina's underwear in public. On 6 May 2025, a report was published in The Hindu on World Press Freedom Day citing Dehli based Rights and Risk Analysis Group claiming the interim government had targeted 640 journalists in Bangladesh in eight months. The Bangladeshi government rejected the claim as baseless, false and misleading. A post from the verified Facebook page the press wing released a statement saying it misleading and intentional false information.\nAnti-Bengali sentiment\nRenewal of hostilities between India and Bangladesh has led to a spurt of anti-Bengali sentiment among Hindus in several BJP-ruled states, manifesting in the form of Bengali-speaking migrant labourers (largely Bengali Muslims, but also Bengali Hindus) from the Bengali-majority Indian state of West Bengal being detained & harassed over allegations of being Bangladeshi or Rohingya infiltrators. Such hostility is rooted in the Hindu nationalist conspiracy theory about demographic change caused by illegal immigration of Bangladeshi Muslims into Hindu-majority India.\nReforms\nOn 11 September 2024, Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus announced the formation of several reform commissions aimed at rebuilding and reforming the country and It's governance and cleanse it of any bias left behind by the former administration. The commissions includes,\n#Public Administration Reform Commission\n#Anti Corruption Commission Reform Commission\n#Justice Division Reform Commission\n#Police Reform Commission\n#Electoral System Reform Commission\n#Constitutional Reform Commission\n#Labor Reform Commission\n#Women's Affairs Reform Commission\n#Local Government Reform Commission\n#Mass Media Reform Commission\n#Health Sector Reform Commission\nInvestigations and prosecutions\nOn 13 August 2024, a murder complaint was filed at a court in Dhaka against Sheikh Hasina and six other government officials, including former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan and former Transport and Bridges Minister and concurrent Awami League secretary-general Obaidul Quader, regarding the killing of a grocer during the protests on 19 July. That same day, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party also submitted a formal request to the United Nations requesting for it to conduct an international investigation into the killings during the protests. In a phone call with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus on 14 August, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said that such an investigation would come \"very soon\".\nOn 14 August 2024, a petition was filed by the father of a student killed during the protests at the International Crimes Tribunal calling for an investigation on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity against Sheikh Hasina and nine other individuals, including Obaidul Quader and Asaduzzaman Khan over their role in the crackdown on the protests. The Awami League itself and its associated organisations were also named as accused in the petition, which was formally investigated on by the court later that day. The court began legal proceedings to have Sheikh Hasina extradited on 8 September. On 15 August, two additional murder charges were filed against Sheikh Hasina and several of her associates over the deaths of two people during the protests. On 16 August, another murder charge was filed against Sheikh Hasina, former education minister Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury and several others over the death of a college student during the protests in Chittagong on 18 July.\nOn 17 August 2024, former shipping minister Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury was charged over an attack on a student protest on 18 July and on 27 August, the interim government dissolved a committee created under Sheikh Hasina's government to investigate the deaths of students during the protests.\nThe Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal (ICT), Mohammad Tajul Islam, stated that preliminary investigation of the ICT revealed the presence of foreign individuals in police uniform at the protests to suppress the uprising.\nThe next year, On 12 February 2025,\nthe United Nations fact-finding mission on Bangladesh, published a report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), documenting widespread human rights violations during the protests that took place between July and August 2024. The report, based on over 250 interviews and various digital pieces of evidence, outlined several key issues and accused the former administration of \"crimes against humanity\".\nFormation of National Citizen Party\nThe National Citizen Party was initiated by the Students Against Discrimination and the Jatiya Nagorik Committee on 28 February 2025 as the first student-led political party in the history of Bangladesh.\nAfter the fall of the Awami League government, rumours emerged about the formation of a new political party. During the uprising, a manifesto by the leadership of the Students Against Discrimination mentioned the idea of a new political arrangement. Subsequently, in September, the Jatiya Nagorik Committee was formed with the aim of restructuring the country. In December, it was revealed that a new party would be formed in February 2025, and efforts were made to establish committees in every thana across Bangladesh. In February, the Students Against Discrimination and the Jatiya Nagorik Committee reached a final decision to form a new political party, with plans to announce the formation of the party between 23 and 25 February. The party was formally launched on 28 February 2025, with Nahid Islam from the interim government as its convener.\nBan on Awami League\nOn 9 May 2025, a massive protest was led by NCP's Hasnat Abdullah & supported by Islamists to ban the Awami League, demanding justice and trial for the party's leaders on International Crimes Tribunal on crimes against humanity. On 10 May, Awami League and it's affiliated organisations were subsequently banned under Anti-terrorism law.\n2025 Gopalganj clashes\nJuly Declaration and Charter\nSee also\n*Timeline of July Revolution (Bangladesh)\n*History of Bangladesh\nReferences"
