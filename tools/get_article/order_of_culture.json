      "text": "# Order of Culture\n\nThe  is a Japanese order, established on February 11, 1937. The order has one class only, and may be awarded to men and women for contributions to Japan's art, literature, science, technology, or anything related to culture in general; recipients of the order also receive an annuity for life. The order is conferred by the Emperor of Japan in person on Culture Day (November 3) each year. It is considered equivalent to the highest rank (Grand Cordon) of the Order of the Rising Sun, the Order of the Sacred Treasure, and the Order of the Precious Crown. The only orders that Japanese emperors bestow on recipients by their own hands are the Collar of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum, the Grand Cordon of each order, and the Order of Culture.\nThe badge of the order, which is in gold with white enamel, is in the form of a Tachibana orange blossom; the central disc bears three crescent-shaped jades (magatama). The badge is suspended on a gold and enamel wreath of mandarin orange leaves and fruit, which is in turn suspended on a purple ribbon worn around the neck.\nSystem of recognition\nactor Nakamura Kichiemon I was awarded the Order of Culture in 1951.  He was the first kabuki performer to be accorded this honor. ]]\nThe Order of Culture and Persons of Cultural Merit function together in honoring contributions to the advancement and development of Japanese culture in a variety of fields such as academia, arts and others.\nOrder of Culture\nThe Emperor himself presents the honor at the award ceremony, which takes place at the Imperial Palace on the Day of Culture (November 3). Candidates for the Order of Culture are selected from the Persons of Cultural Merit by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, upon hearing views of all the members of the selection committee for the Persons of Cultural Merit. The Minister then recommends the candidates to the Prime Minister so that they can be decided by the Cabinet.\nPersons of Cultural Merit\nThe system for Persons of Cultural Merit was established in 1951 by the Law on Pensions for the Persons of Cultural Merit. Since the Constitution of Japan stipulates that \"No privilege shall accompany any award of honor, decoration or any distinction\" (Article 14), the government is not allowed to provide pensions or rewards to recipients of the Order of Culture. The purpose is to honor persons of cultural merit (including recipients of the Order of Culture) by providing a special government-sponsored pension (3.5 million yen per year). Since 1955, the new honorees have been announced on the Day of Culture, the same day as the award ceremony for the Order of Culture.\nSelected recipients\n, Susumu Nakanishi, Seikaku Takagi, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, Shun-ichi Iwasaki, and Ken Takakura]]\nA complete list can be found here.\n* Akira Ifukube (1914–2006).
