Seeing the success of the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish versions of the show TV3 in Switzerland decided to produce their own version of the show. Due to low ratings, the show was cancelled after just two seasons. At the time the show was cancelled the third season was nearly done being shot. Despite this the third season was never broadcast.\nThe name alludes to both Robinson Crusoe and The Swiss Family Robinson, two stories featuring people marooned by shipwrecks.\nFormat\nThe Robinson format was developed by Planet 24, a United Kingdom TV production company owned by Charlie Parsons and Bob Geldof. Their company Castaway Television Productions retained the rights to the concept when they sold Planet 24 in 1999. Mark Burnett later licensed the format to create the American show Survivor in 2000.\nSixteen contestants are put into a survival situation and compete in a variety of physical challenges. Early in each season two teams compete but later on the teams are merged and the competitions become individual. At the end of each show one contestant is eliminated from the show by the others in a secret \"island council\" ballot.\nSeasons\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Host\n! Channel\n! Location\n!
