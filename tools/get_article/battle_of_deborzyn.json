The Confederation took up positions near Dęborzyn, on a hill to which the road led through the ravine. The clash took place on Pułaski's initiative, without consultation with the Confederation's leadership. During the battle with Russian troops, 200 Bar Confederates died. The defeat had a negative impact on Kazimierz Pułaski, which he expressed in the report. In response, the command stated that the defeat \"does not diminish (...) in any way the respect, and bravery of His Lordship\".\nReferences"
