It is a scheme which allows governmental and government subsidised primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong to employ English teachers from overseas. The aim of the scheme is to provide local students with exposure to authentic English language and to cultural enrichment. NET teachers are also expected to assist with teaching resources development and professional training for English teachers in their schools. At present, there are approximately 800 NET teachers in Hong Kong schools.\nNET teachers are employed on a renewable two-year contract basis, they receive a gratuity at the end of each contract and also receive a special allowance which is intended to partially compensate for the additional costs of living overseas.\nSee also\n*Education in Hong Kong\nExternal links\n*[http://www.nesta.hk Native English-Speaking Teachers' Association (NESTA)]\n*[http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/curriculum-development/resource-support/net/index.html Education Bureau] &ndash; Further details of NETs' terms of employment and of the rationale behind the scheme\n*Net Teacher Survival Guide"
