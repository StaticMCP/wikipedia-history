It is a long rectangular structure, with walls that slope inward as they rise to a gable roof.  The roof is topped by a series of gabled cupolas, each with windows and louvered openings.  The main entrance is at one end, in a projecting gabled section.  All of the exterior walls are corrugated metal.  Built in 1948 by a prominent local cotton farmer, it is a well-preserved example of a modern mid-20th century cotton seed storage facility.  It was acquired by the state in 1985 for the museum, underwent restoration in 2008, and now houses museum exhibits.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Pulaski County, Arkansas\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.arkansasstateparks.com/plantationagriculturemuseum/ Plantation Agriculture Museum web site]"
