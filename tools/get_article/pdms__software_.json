Its mission was to develop computer-aided design techniques and promote their take-up by British industry.  The centre carried out much pioneering CAD research, and many of its early staff members went on to become prominent in the worldwide CAD community, such as brothers Dick Newell and Martin Newell.\nDick Newell oversaw the creation of the Plant Design Management System (PDMS) for 3D process plant design. He later co-founded two software companies – Cambridge Interactive Systems (CIS) which was  known for its Medusa 2D/3D CAD system, and Smallworld with its eponymous Smallworld GIS (Geographical Information System). Martin Newell later went to the University of Utah where he did pioneering 3D solid modelling work; he was also one of the progenitors of PostScript.\nSubsequently, the UK government, via the British Technology Group (BTG) established a separate company, Compeda Ltd, to exploit software developed and owned by the government and they took over the marketing and user support of PDMS, while the software continued to be developed by the CADCentre, with funding from Compeda.\nWhen the UK government decided to privatise (sell) anything that did not need to be government owned, Compeda Ltd was sold to Prime Computer Inc.  for a net negative sum of money.   Prime Computer decided that PDMS had no commercial value or future and returned the marketing rights for the product to CADCentre.\nCADCentre was privatised and  in 2001 changed its name to AVEVA.\nThe latest release, as of March 2021, is AVEVA PDMS 12.1.SP5\nAVEVA has introduced the latest version of PDMS is AVEVA Everything 3D (E3D). The current version of AVEVA Everything 3D is 2.1 (Expected to Launch 3.1 very soon)\nAVEVA Everything 3D has been introduced with the new UI and with advanced functions. Ease of modelling, Quick Modelling functionality, More User friendly.\nUser Groups\nExisting\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! URL\n! Date Started\n!
