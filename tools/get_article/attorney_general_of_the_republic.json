Its headquarters are located at Santo Domingo, at the Centro de los Héroes, near the Supreme Court and the Congress of the Dominican Republic. Since February 21, 2025, the Attorney General is Yeni Berenice Reynoso.\nIt is analogous to Departments of Justice or Ministries of Justice in other countries.\nHistory\nThe origin of this Ministry can be found on the first Dominican Constitution, signed on November 6, 1844. This document specified that:\n}}\nThus, it was established the Secretary of State of Justice and Public Instruction (Secretaría de Estado de Justicia e Instrucción Pública) as the regulatory office of the judiciary activity and as the nexus between the President and the Supreme Court, established on Art. 31 of the same code of law.\nThe following year, on June 11, 1845, the Law no. 41 determined the role of the Attorney General. Initially, this position would be the link between the Secretary of Justice and the Supreme Court.\nIn 1931, the Secretary was suppressed and its functions on the matter of justice were transferred to the Office of the Attorney General (Procuraduría General de la República). In 1934, the Secretary of State of Justice was reestablished, at the same as the creation of the Secretary of State of Education and Fine Arts taking the functions in the matter of public instruction. During the 1950s, the office was given roles on the subject of labour, being temporarily named Secretary of State of Justice and Labour.\nOn November 10, 1964, by the Law no. 485, the Secretary of State of Justice was permanently abolished and all its functions were transferred to the Office of the Attorney General.\nAffiliated institutions\nThe Office of the Attorney General has a number of agencies that work alongside it to improve the judiciary system of the Dominican Republic.
