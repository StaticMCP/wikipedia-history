The Greek fleet, under Georgios Sachtouris, comprising 20 warships and eight fireships, defeated the Ottoman fleet of 51 vessels by attacking and burning with two fireships the Ottoman flagship—a 66-gun double-banked frigate—and another 34-gun frigate with another fireship.\nThe Ottoman fleet dispersed, allowing the Greeks to capture a sloop with its crew, as well as five Austrian cargo ships destined to support the Ottoman Siege of Missolonghi.\nReferences"
