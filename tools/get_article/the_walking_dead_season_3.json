Developed for television by Frank Darabont, the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It was executive produced by Kirkman, Glen Mazzara, David Alpert, and Gale Anne Hurd, with Mazzara as showrunner for his second and final season. The third season was very well received by critics. It was nominated for multiple awards and won two, including Best Syndicated/Cable Television Series, at the 39th Saturn Awards.\nThis season adapts material from issues #13–39 of the comic book series and introduces notable comic characters, including Michonne (Danai Gurira), Axel (Lew Temple), The Governor (David Morrissey) and Tyreese Williams (Chad L. Coleman). It also marks the return of Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker), the volatile older brother of Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), who went missing in the first season, and also features the return of Morgan Jones (Lennie James), the first survivor Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) encountered and befriended, who he lost contact with in season one. As in the comics, this season is mainly set in both an abandoned prison and an active rural town of survivors.\nSet eight months after the killing of Shane Walsh and onslaught of the Greene Family Farm, with the world growing increasingly more dangerous and Lori's (Sarah Wayne Callies) pregnancy advancing, the season continues the story of Rick Grimes, who has assumed a dictatorial-like leadership over his group of survivors as they survive in a post-apocalyptic world infested with flesh-eating zombies, dubbed \"walkers\". After discovering a potential safe haven, the group takes refuge and inhabits a large fortified prison, but this security is threatened by a nearby community — Woodbury — led by a nefarious man known as The Governor, who takes an interest in Andrea (Laurie Holden) as she remains, after the burning of the farm, separated and unaware of the main group's status.\nProduction\nAMC renewed The Walking Dead for a third season on October 25, 2011, after the season two premiere broke cable ratings records in the 18-49 demographic. On January 14, 2012, AMC announced that the third season will contain 16 episodes.\nFilming for the season began in May 2012 in Coweta County, Georgia, with the city of Senoia being used as the filming location for the town of Woodbury. Ernest Dickerson directed the season premiere episode. Greg Nicotero, co-executive producer and special make-up FX artist on the series, directed the fifth episode of season 3 after already having directed the season 2 episode \"Judge, Jury, Executioner\". He also returned as a zombie in the episode \"The Suicide King\", after portraying two different zombies in the first season. In November 2012, Glen Mazzara announced that Ernest Dickerson would direct the season finale.\nAfter the conclusion of the third season, Mazzara stepped down from his position as showrunner and executive producer for the series, in a mutual agreement by both Mazzara and AMC. The press release read, \"Both parties acknowledge that there is a difference of opinion about where the show should go moving forward, and conclude that it is best to part ways.\"\nWebisodes\nFollowing the Torn Apart series in 2011, another set of webisodes titled Cold Storage were produced and debuted on October 1, 2012, prior to the premiere of Season 3.\nTalking Dead\nA second season had been commissioned in May 2012. To coincide with a marathon of the show, a special episode was aired in July 2012 following the marathon's end, featuring a tour of the various props/sets used in the third season, as well as cast/crew interviews, and a snippet of exclusive footage featuring the newly introduced character Michonne.\nCast\n, Carl, Daryl, Carol, T-Dog, Beth, Hershel, Rick, Maggie, Glenn, The Governor, Michonne, and Andrea; absent: Merle]]\nMain cast\nThe third season features ten actors receiving opening credits billing, with eight returning from the previous season and two new cast members introduced; six are listed as main cast members in the second season, while Lauren Cohan and Scott Wilson were promoted from recurring  status and Michael Rooker was promoted from guest status from the previous two seasons, while Danai Gurira and David Morrissey were added to the main cast as Michonne and The Governor, respectively.
