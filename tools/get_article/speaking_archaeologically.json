Founded by Shriya Gautamalongside colleagues Lyn Pease, Catherine Holtham-Oakley, Max Zeronian-Dalley and Molly Lockeyearin June 2015, it focuses on the documentation of neglected and forgotten archaeological sites, object analysis, and rescue archaeology.\nHistory\nGautam founded Speaking Archaeologically in June 2015, after having received an email from a student of MCM DAV College, Chandigarh: \"[the student] wanted to be an archaeologist and asked me to guide her. That rang a bell and I realised I don’t want more people to be led in the dark for a profession that they want to pursue.\" Speaking Archaeologically started out as a Facebook Page, and featured photographs and blog posts about neglected sites and privately owned archaeologically significant objects.  It then branched out into facilitating archaeological research, especially with respect to sites and objects which have not been previously documented or adequately researched about. Currently, it is involved with documenting, recording and publishing the research undertaken by its students and research interns on a pan-India basis, which is made public through its various interfaces including its eponymous Research Journal and YouTube Channel.\nVolunteering and public involvement\nCitizen Archaeology\nThe group launched its first public involvement drive shortly after its foundation, aiming to engage the general public to \"narrate the story past has to tell us.\"  Dubbed Citizen Archaeology, it was launched on Twitter and Facebook simultaneously, directed at both academics as well as amateurs with an interest in history. Subsequently, the group expanded to Instagram and Pinterest with the aim of involving more photographers and popularising its own site covers as well as creating awareness.\nIn June 2016, Citizen Archaeology evolved into a membership option for students and travel bloggers, who wished to publish their photographs with the group and host their travelogues on the group's [http://speakingarchaeologically.blogspot.in/ blog].

It aims to train students in research writing and the basics of research techniques in archaeology, museology and archaeological methods. It is directed at academics with an interest in history and archaeology.\nThe Research Wing has a membership option for students after attempting an entrance test. The Wing conducts special lectures, workshops and seminars for the students as a part of the course. It welcomed its first set of members in 2015 and in the subsequent years students are accepted into the wing annually. Members carry out research on a wide range topics every month. Papers written by the interns at the Research Wing are also published in the Speaking Archaeologically Journal and have been presented at various national and international conferences.\nArt Wing\nThe Art Wing was started in 2019, with students both from the Research Wing and outside.
