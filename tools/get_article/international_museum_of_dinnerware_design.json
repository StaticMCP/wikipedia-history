It was established in 2012 by Margaret L. Carney. IMoDD is a 501(c)(3) organization that \"collects, preserves, and celebrates masterpieces of the tabletop genre created by leading artists and designers worldwide. Through its collections, exhibitions, and educational programming,\" IMoDD's mission statement says, \"it provides a window on the varied cultural and societal attitudes toward food and dining and commemorates the objects that exalt and venerate the dining experience.\" IMoDD has over 9,000 objects in its permanent collection, consisting of work by contemporary artists as well as the leading designers for industry, with an additional focus on fine art referencing dining.\nHistory\nMargaret L. Carney established the International Museum of Dinnerware Design in Ann Arbor in 2012, based on her love of the work of the leading designers for industry, including that of Eva Zeisel, Glidden Parker, Russel Wright, Ben Seibel, Fong Chow, Viktor and Don Schreckengost, along with functional pottery by contemporary artists. In the late 1990s, after organizing special exhibitions and writing catalogues on the topic of dinnerware, Carney began to explore the idea of creating a unique museum devoted to the celebration of dinnerware. In order to test public interest, she aimed to hold a special exhibition in New York City with Corning Inc. titled \"Great Moments in Dinnerware\" and/or \"You Are What You Eat Off Of\" in 2002; unfortunately, the September 11 attacks occurred and Corning closed its exhibition space in Manhattan.\nOn December 30, 2011, designer Eva Zeisel died, prompting Carney to move forward with her museum plans, as she had shared her dream with Eva, who supported the idea. In 2012, Carney moved to Ann Arbor, filed for incorporation, and applied for 501(c)(3) status.\nBecause of the cost of commercial space in Ann Arbor, the museum lacked a dedicated exhibition space. As a result, public exhibitions of the museum's collection appeared in curated exhibits at other facilities, particularly in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. IMoDD's pop-up exhibits typically last from 3 days to 5 months. For example, one of its first exhibits was “Whetting Your Appetite,” held in 2013 at SOFA Chicago (Sculpture, Objects, Functional Art + Design).\nIn January 2017, the museum's name was changed from The Dinnerware Museum to The International Museum of Dinnerware Design in order to better reflect the mission of capturing dining history worldwide and celebrating dining memories, with a focus on design as a key element. While there are currently no paid employees at the museum, it has had interns from the University of Michigan's Museum Studies program as well as other volunteers. Carney continues to serve as Director and Chief Curator.\nIn April 2024, Director Margaret Carney announced that the museum was moving to its first brick-and-mortar home in Kingston, New York. According to Carney, the new space will allow for exhibitions and programming to be available all the time, rather than through pop-up exhibits. Carney notes that Kingston is a thriving arts community and is located near the homes and studios of Russel Wright and Eva Zeisel.\nSince its founding, IMoDD has put on biennial national juried, invitational, and historical exhibitions. These exhibitions include \"The Art of High Chair Fine Dining\" (2014), \"Cake\" (2016), \"Butter\" (2019), \"Breakfast\" (2021), and \"Entomophagous Dining\" (2023).\nCollections\nThe International Museum of Dinnerware Design \"celebrates a significant aspect of our daily lives. The permanent collection features international dinnerware from ancient to futuristic times,\" and the objects are made of an array of different materials – from ceramic, glass, and metal to plastic, lacquer, fiber, paper, wood, yarn, and more. The collection features historic dinnerware made by the leading designers for industry, including work by Eva Zeisel, Russel Wright, Ben Seibel, Arne Jacobsen, Glidden Parker, Frederick Carder, Frederick Hurten Rhead, Viktor and Don Schreckengost, Michael Lax, A.D. Copier, Fong Chow, and Shinichiro Ogata. The collection also includes masterpieces by hundreds of contemporary artists such as Warren MacKenzie, Marie Woo, Val Cushing, John Neely, Josh DeWeese, Léopold Foulem, Ruth Duckworth, Chris Staley, Jeff Oestreich, and Otto and Vivika Heino. Along with contemporary and historic dinnerware, IMoDD collects non-functional fine art that references the dining experience, including art made by Roy Lichtenstein, Sandy Skoglund (\"The Cocktail Party\"), William Parry (\"Knife Fork Spoon\" ceramic sculpture), and David Oliviera (\"Wire Scribble Sculpture\"). IMoDD has over 9,000 objects in its collection.\nExhibitions and educational programming\nThe International Museum of Dinnerware Design has office and storage facilities in Ann Arbor, but without a dedicated museum building, it has partnered with other local museums, galleries, and libraries on more than twenty exhibitions since its founding in 2012.
