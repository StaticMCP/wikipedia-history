He landed with his machine-gun in the face of great difficulties, advancing down the Mole with his commanding officer (Arthur Leyland Harrison) who with most of his party was killed. The seaman accounted for several of the enemy running for shelter to a destroyer alongside the Mole, and was severely wounded whilst working his gun in an exposed position.\nHe was presented with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace. However, having almost recovered from his wounds, he died of influenza during the world flu pandemic at the beginning of November 1918. He is buried in Camberwell Old Cemetery, South London.\nThe medal\nMckenzie's Victoria Cross is still owned by the McKenzie family and is on loan to the Imperial War Museum in London.\nCommemoration\nA memorial in honour of Albert McKenzie VC was unveiled on 23 October 2015 (the 117th anniversary of his birth) at the junction of Tower Bridge Road, Decima Street and Bermondsey Street, Bermondsey, in the London Borough of Southwark.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* The Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997)\n* David Harvey, Monuments to Courage (1999)\n* Stephen Snelling, VCs of the First World War: The Naval VCs (2002)\n* Deborah Lake, The Zeebrugge and Ostend Raids 1918 (Barnsley, 2002)\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041028140920/http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/lonseast.htm Location of grave and VC medal] (S.E.
