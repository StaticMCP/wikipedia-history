The vessel is of the same basic design as other Vista-class cruise ships, including . At  she is the smallest of Cunard's ships in operation.\nCharacteristics and naming\nUnlike many previous Cunard ships, Queen Victoria is not a traditional ocean liner, as she does not have heavy plating throughout the hull. However, the bow was constructed with heavier plating to cope with the transatlantic run, and the ship has a high freeboard. The  had cost approximately $300,000 US per berth, nearly double that of many contemporary cruise ships, so Cunard made the economic decision to base Queen Victoria on a modified , and  retains the same design with some minor changes. Nonetheless, Ian McNaught, who was Queen Victorias captain in 2009, has asserted that the ship is a liner based on her classic décor.\nHistory\nConcept and construction\nAn order for a Vista-class vessel was transferred by Carnival Corporation & plc, parent company to Holland America, Cunard and P&O from its Holland America Line to Cunard with the intent that the vessel would become the Queen Victoria Fincantieri laid down the keel in 2003, but Carnival reassigned the hull again to become the P&O ship .\nThe new Queen Victoria ordered from Fincantieri in 2004 was  longer, 5,000 tons larger, with an increased passenger capacity of 2,000. and features which had proved successful on Queen Mary 2. The keel was laid on 12 May 2006. Eighty prefabricated steel \"blocks\", each complete with interior structure, cabling, and ducts, and each weighing 325 tons, were then added. The completed hull with superstructure was floated out on 15 January 2007, after having a bottle of Prosecco smashed against her side by Maureen Ryan, a Cunard employee who has served on all four \"Cunard Queens\". The ceremony also saw the traditional placing of coins on the mast – in this case a Euro and a gold Queen Victoria sovereign were welded beneath the radar mast.\nQueen Victoria departed the Port of Venice on 24 August 2007 to commence her sea trials, and, after handover to Cunard, arrived in Southampton, United Kingdom, to fanfare and media attention on 7 December; much of the coverage was focused on the ship's superlatives, and represented Queen Victoria as \"Cunard's most luxurious ship\". The same day, the ship was officially named by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, continuing the tradition of Cunard \"Queens\" being named by royalty. The bottle of champagne failed to break upon impact with Queen Victorias hull, which according to nautical superstition is a bad omen. However, a backup bottle was immediately successful.\nService history\nCaptain Paul Wright was appointed as the first master of Queen Victoria in October 2006. Captain Christopher Rynd became secondary master. Captain Ian McNaught briefly commanded Queen Victoria before transferring to Seabourn.\nQueen Victoria undertook her maiden voyage, a 10-day cruise to northern Europe, on 11 December 2007. Following this and a cruise to the Canary Islands, Queen Victoria embarked on her first world cruise, circumnavigating the globe in 107 days. (The first ship to have previously done so—also named —took 1,153 days in 1519 to 1522.) The first leg of this voyage was a tandem crossing of the Atlantic with Queen Elizabeth 2, to New York City, where the two ships met Queen Mary 2 near the Statue of Liberty on 13 January 2008, with a celebratory fireworks display, marking the first time three Cunard \"Queens\" had been present in the same location. Cunard declared that this would also be the only time the three ships would ever meet, owing to the QE2's impending retirement from service in late 2008, though the ships did meet again in Southampton on 22 April 2008, resulting from a change in Queen Elizabeth 2s schedule.\nIn May 2008, Queen Victoria struck a pier in Malta after her thrusters malfunctioned. However the damage was minimal, allowing the ship to continue operating, but repairs resulted in her missing a port of call in La Goulette.\nQueen Victoria completed her third world cruise in 2010 when she was joined by Captain Chris Wells, who was aboard to familiarise himself with the Vista-class ship before taking command of Queen Elizabeth in late 2010. During a call at Sydney, Queen Victoria was illuminated in pink in support of breast cancer research. On 9 December 2010 Cunard announced its first female captain, Faroese-born Inger Klein Olsen, who took command of Queen Victoria on 15 December.\nAt the end of October 2011 Queen Victoria and her fleet mates changed their registries to Hamilton, Bermuda, to host weddings on board. Also the word \"Southampton\" across the stern was replaced by Hamilton.\nCunard rendezvous\nIn January 2011, two years after the first Cunard Royal Rendezvous, on the same date, Queen Mary 2 met up with both Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth for another Royal Rendezvous in New York City on 13 January 2011. Both the Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth made a tandem crossing of the Atlantic for the event. All three ships met in front of the Statue of Liberty at 6:45 pm for a Grucci fireworks display. The Empire State Building was lit up in red to mark the event. In March 2011 Queen Victoria passed the former Cunard retired ocean liner  for the first time. The Queen Mary  is permanently docked in Long Beach, California and operated as a hotel.\nOn 5 June 2012 all three Queens met again but this time in Southampton to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.\nOn 6 May 2014 all three Queens met up for the first time in Lisbon, Portugal, in preparation for Queen Mary 2's 10th birthday. All three on departure sailed in a one-line formation to Southampton.  On 9 May both Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria led in single file, Queen Mary 2 up the Southampton channel, with both ships docking in a bow to bow formation performing a birthday salute to Queen Mary 2. Later on, all three sisters gather for a fireworks display in which Queen Mary 2 led the vessels back down the channel.\n, on 25 May 2015, after the Cunard 175 celebration]]\nOn 25 May 2015 the three \"Queens\" were at Liverpool celebrating 175 years of the formation of the Cunard Line, which was formed and based in the city. At low tide, the three ships stopped in line in the middle of the River Mersey, bow to stern, maneuvered 180 degrees in full synchronisation with each other, which was described as a river dance, and then formed an arrow side by side. Queen Mary 2 was in the centre with her bow in line with the Cunard Building at the Pier Head. The Royal Air Force Red Arrows aerobatics team performed a flypast in Vic formation, emitting red, white and blue smoke, over the vessels. An estimated 1.3 million people lined the river banks to witness the spectacle.\nDesign\nExterior\nQueen Victorias exterior design closely resembles that of Vista-class ships built for various cruise companies.\nA feature which distinguishes her from her younger fleet mate, Queen Elizabeth'', is the more angled sloping stern, as compared to the newer ship's vertical one. In addition to this she lacks the covered games deck above the bridge, a feature which is present on the Queen Elizabeth.\nInterior\nQueen Victorias public rooms are mainly located on the lower-level public decks of the ship, 2 Deck and 3 Deck. Unlike Queen Mary 2, however, there is no central circulation access, the main corridors being to the port side. The ship does have the similar grand lobby staircase with an artwork feature as on the Queen Mary ships, a relief portrait of the ship situated on the staircase sculpted by British sculptor John McKenna.\n1 Deck, the lowest passenger deck, holds the lowest level of a three-storey stairwell lobby, as well as of the Royal Court Theatre. On 2 Deck can be found the mid-level of the Royal Court Theatre, casino, Golden Lion Pub, Queen's Room, Verandah à la carte restaurant, Chart Room bar, and lower level of both the library and Britannia Restaurant. The topmost level of the theatre, Royal Arcade, Midships Lounge, and upper level of the library and formal dining room are all on 3 Deck, along with a wrap-around exterior promenade. The decks above these contain mostly passenger cabins until 9 Deck, on which are the Cunard Health Club and spa, Winter Garden lounge, Lido Restaurant, and two outdoor pools. On 10 Deck is the Commodore Club, Churchill Lounge (for smokers) and Yacht Club nightclub. The Queen's Grill and Princess Grill, with their attached lounge and an open courtyard between, are on 11 Deck.\nThe Queen Victoria operates similarly to both the Queen Mary 2 and the former Queen Elizabeth 2, both of which follow the same practice of separating passengers into different restaurants based on the price of the cabin they booked (the Britannia as standard for regular cabins, the Princess Grill as middle for those in junior suites, and the Queen's Grill as superior for deluxe suite occupants), are actually ships divided into three classes, despite the fact that all other public rooms are used by all passengers equally. Though this situation is similar on Queen Elizabeth 2 and Queen Mary 2, it is further enhanced on Queen Victoria by the fact that Grill Passengers (those dining in the Princess Grill or Queen's Grill) also have two private outdoor areas on 10 and 11 Decks with the specific name \"Grills Terrace\", a feature which also appears on Queen Mary 2 at the aft section of 10 Deck.\nQueen Victorias theatre is the first at sea to have private boxes. There is also has a Winter Garden lounge with a retractable glass roof and a two-story library with a connecting spiral staircase.\nMay 2017 refit\nIn May 2017, Queen Victoria underwent a second major overhaul, which added new cabins aft, as well as refurbishing other spaces and adding new dining facilities. The modifications saw the passenger capacity increase to 1,988 from 2,081.\nChanges included a new Britannia Club restaurant, updated Chartroom, refreshed Winter Garden, refreshed Yacht Club and new outdoor pool area.\nTechnical\nPower plant and propulsion system\nQueen Victoria can carry 3,000 tons of heavy fuel and 150 tons of marine gas oil, consuming 12 tons per hour for maximum output. Although the ship burns heavy fuel, it uses low-sulphur fuel in certain jurisdictions.\nIncidents\nOn Queen Victorias 21 December 2007 voyage, 122 guests and 11 crew on board contracted norovirus. It was officially attributed to a guest who had already contracted the virus prior to boarding the ship. The outbreak was also popularly attributed to the Duchess of Cornwall's initial failure to break the champagne bottle during the ship's christening, which is a bad omen in naval tradition. While most recovered, 30 were still reported to be ill at that time.\nThis was not reported on the CDC's website, which recorded three more norovirus outbreaks on the ship's 4 January 2010, 12 January 2010, and 21 February 2018 voyages.\nOn 14 May 2008, on Queen Victorias first visit to Grand Harbour, Valletta, Malta, the throttles malfunctioned during berthing, resulting in the vessel colliding with the pier. She remained in port for an extra night whilst repairs were carried out to the stern.\nOn 27 April 2022, the passenger ferry  suffered a complete power loss just off the coast of Larne, Northern Ireland The Royal National Lifeboat Institution dispatched three lifeboats to the vessel's location, a coastguard helicopter was dispatched and the Queen Victoria was asked to stand by to assist if required. European Causeway recovered power after roughly two hours adrift and continued the voyage to Larne under her own power, escorted by the lifeboats, while Queen Victoria continued on her way.\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [http://www.cunard.com/Ships/Queen-Victoria/ Cunard Line: Queen Victoria – official site]\n* [http://www.traveller.com.au/downton-on-the-high-seas-gnqfyp \"On board Queen Victoria's exclusive cruise\"] – review in [http://www.traveller.com.au/ traveller.com.au] (Fairfax Media) of a cruise on Queen Victoria\n* [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/cruise-ships/14807/Cunard-Queen-Victoria.html Queen Victoria] – review by Douglas Ward in The Daily Telegraph, London.\n* [http://chriscunard.com/qv/ Queen Victoria Pages at Chris' Cunard Page]"
