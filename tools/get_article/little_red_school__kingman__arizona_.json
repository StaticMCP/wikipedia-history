The building was constructed for the Kingman Elementary School District in 1896 in the Queen Anne style, with the firm Hartley, Cooper & Hines recorded as the architects or builders or both. It replaced an earlier school building, Kingman's first, and remained in use until 1928. Actor Andy Devine was an alumnus of the school.\nAfter the closure of the school the building hosted the activities of several local groups. Kingman's Catholic community met there until the construction of St. Mary's church, and the Christian Science Church and the Elks Lodge used the building at various periods. During World War II the Ration Board operated out of the schoolhouse. After the war Kingman's Chamber of Commerce briefly used the building as their office, sharing it with the Public Library. After the library outgrew the premises the building came under the ownership of the City of Kingman; it is today the city's Magistrate's Office.\nThe building was mentioned in a survey of historic properties in Kingman.\nSee also\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Mohave County, Arizona\nReferences"
