In May there were elections to 83 county boroughs, 259 municipal boroughs and 521 urban district councils.  There were also elections to Scottish burghs.\nThe results showed a substantial recovery for the Labour Party, which had been in government since 1964 and had suffered heavy losses in council elections during the intervening years.  The Liberals turned in their worst performance since Clement Davies was party leader.  The Scottish National Party's vote was halved as a result of the pro-Labour swing in Scotland.\nPrime Minister Harold Wilson subsequently called a general election in June of that year, which the Labour Party lost contrary to the expectations of most opinion polls.\nSee also\n*1970 Greater London Council election\n*1970 Scottish local elections\n*1970 United Kingdom general election\nReferences\n*The Economist, articles April/May 1970"
