      "text": "# Moderate Dems Working Group\n\nModerate Dems Working Group was a caucus of moderate Democratic members of the United States Senate. The group's goal was to work with the Senate leadership, and the Obama administration \"to craft common-sense solutions to urgent national problems.\" The group's members are \"joined by a shared commitment to pursue pragmatic, fiscally sustainable policies across a range of issues, such as deficit containment, health care reform, the housing crisis, educational reform, energy policy and climate change.\"\nThe Moderate Dems Working Group was founded on March 18, 2009, and was led by Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana, Tom Carper of Delaware, and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. It has been described, as the Senate version of the New Democrat Coalition in the House. The coalition has received praise from Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, but has been criticized by the left as simply being \"political cover to Democratic senators representing red or purple states, making it harder for Republicans to tie them to liberal bogeymen.\"\nMembers\nImage:Michael_Bennet_Official_Photo.jpg| Michael Bennet, Colorado\nImage:Thomas Carper.jpg| Tom Carper, Delaware\nImage:Jeanne Shaheen, official Senate photo portrait, 2009.jpg| Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire\nImage:Mark Warner, official 111th Congress photo portrait.jpg| Mark Warner, Virginia\nFormer members\nImage:Evan Bayh official portrait.jpg|Evan Bayh, Indiana\nImage:Mark Begich, official Senate photo portrait, 2009.jpg| Mark Begich, Alaska\nImage:Kay Hagan official photo.jpg| Kay Hagan, North Carolina\nImage:Herbert Kohl, official photo.jpg| Herb Kohl, Wisconsin\nImage:Mary Landrieu Senate portrait.jpg| Mary Landrieu, Louisiana\nImage:Joe Lieberman official portrait 2 (cropped 2).jpg| Joe Lieberman, Connecticut\nImage:Blanche Lincoln, 2007.jpg| Blanche Lincoln, Arkansas\nImage:Claire McCaskill, Official portrait, 112th Congress.jpg| Claire McCaskill, Missouri\nImage:Ben Nelson official photo.jpg| Ben Nelson, Nebraska\nImage:Bill Nelson.jpg| Bill Nelson, Florida\nImage:Mark Pryor, head and shoulders photo portrait with flag, 2006.jpg| Mark Pryor, Arkansas\nImage:MarkUdall-Senate Portrait.jpg| Mark Udall, Colorado\nSee also\n*New Democrat Coalition\n*New Democrats\nReferences"
