The treaty was signed in San Saba County, Texas, but named after the nearest military outpost, Fort Martin Scott in Gillespie County, on the outskirts of Fredericksburg.\nBackground\nThe Fort Martin Scott Treaty was negotiated and signed on December 10, 1850 by Indian agent John Rollins, U. S. Army Captain Hamilton W. Merrill, Captain J.B. McGown of the Texas Mounted Volunteers (Texas Rangers), interpreters John Connor and Jesse Chisholm, as well as twelve Comanche chiefs, six Caddo chiefs, five Quapaw chiefs, four Tawakoni chiefs, four Lipan chiefs and four Waco chiefs.\nWork on the contract was done primarily by Jesse Chisholm and John Connor, a Delaware chief, under the direction of Robert Neighbors and John Ford.  John H. Rollins who had fallen ill with tuberculosis had to be carried in to the signing ceremony, and eventually succumbed to the disease in September 1851.\nOn December 25, 1850, General George M. Brooke sent a copy of the treaty to Texas Governor Peter Hansborough Bell, mentioning the treaty had not been approved by the government and was essentially binding only on the part of the Indian tribes.\nText of treaty\nSee also\n*Fort Martin Scott\nReferences"
