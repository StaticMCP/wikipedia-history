These have not been listed as actual World Heritage Sites due to the influence of the People's Republic of China, and also because Taiwan is not a member of UNESCO or the United Nations. Taiwan has attended the Asia-Pacific Cultural Heritage Centre for UNESCO (ACCU) in Japan as observers.\nList of sites\n| label2       = Beinan Archaeological Site\n| link2        = Beinan Archaeological Site and Mt.
