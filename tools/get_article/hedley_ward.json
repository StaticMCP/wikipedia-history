      "text": "# Hedley Ward\n\nHedley Ward was a leading British bandleader of the 1930s to 1960s, known for his Birmingham-based Hedley Ward Band (sometimes \"...Big Band\", \"...Dance Band\", \"...Broadcasting Band\" or \"...Orchestra\"), which made many appearances on BBC Radio programmes, including Music While You Work, Shall We Dance?, and regional programmes named for the band.\nAmong the musicians to appear in the band were drummer Tony Levin.\nWard also created and managed the Hedley Ward Trio  in 1948, featuring John \"Jack\" McKechnie (1918-2002) on guitar, Derek Franklin (second husband of Beryl Reid) on bass and lead vocals, and Bob Carter on piano. In 1953 George Taylor (1926/1927-2019) replaced Carter. Listings in The Radio Times show that the trio appeared on the BBC Home Service and Light Programme many times from 1948 onwards. They also featured in the programme Educating Archie, with Stella Tanner. The trio released records on the Melodisc Records label.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://gypsyjazzuk.wordpress.com/36-2/jack-mckechnie/ Blog post on McKechnie] including material about Ward, and his trio"
