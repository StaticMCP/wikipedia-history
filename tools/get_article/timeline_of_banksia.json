Four species are represented: B.&nbsp;serrata (Saw Banksia), B.&nbsp;integrifolia (Coast Banksia), B.&nbsp;ericifolia (Heath-leaved Banksia) and B.&nbsp;robur (Swamp Banksia).\n* June 1770 — Banks and Solander collect specimens of B.&nbsp;dentata (Tropical Banksia) at Endeavour River, Queensland.\n* 1776 — David Nelson collects specimens of B.&nbsp;marginata (Silver Banksia) from South Bruny Island, Tasmania.\n* April 1782 — Carolus Linnaeus the Younger publishes Supplementum Plantarum.

This includes the first published descriptions of the thirteen species he collected in 1801–1802. and also publication of B.&nbsp;spinulosa var. collina at species rank as B.&nbsp;collina, and B.&nbsp;integrifolia subsp. compar at species rank as B.&nbsp;compar. In total, 31 species of Banksia are listed.

B.&nbsp;leptophylla is published as B.&nbsp;pinifolia, but this is later ruled an illegitimate name.\n* 1856 — Meissner publishes a taxonomy of the Proteaceae, including his arrangement of Banksia. B.&nbsp;laevigata, B.&nbsp;lemanniana and B.&nbsp;incana are published, the last of these as B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens, but it is later promoted to species rank and renamed. In total, 58 species are listed; these are classified into two sections and four series.\n* 1861 — George Maxwell makes an expedition along the south coast of Western Australia, collecting the first specimens of B.&nbsp;blechnifolia and Banksia petiolaris.\n* 1864 – Mueller published B.&nbsp;blechifolia and B.&nbsp;petiolaris.\n* 1867 — Mueller collects the first specimen of B.&nbsp;oreophila(Western Mountain Banksia) at Toolbrunup in the Stirling Ranges.\n* 1869 — Mueller publishes B.&nbsp;oreophila as B.&nbsp;quercifolia var. integrifolia; this would later be promoted to species rank, forcing a rename.\n* 1870 — George Bentham publishes a new arrangement for Banksia in his Flora Australiensis. No new species are published; in fact Bentham reduces the number of species from 60 to 46. Bentham's classification uses two subgenera and four sections, and would stand for over 100 years.\n* 1891 - Otto Kuntze challenges Banksia L.f. on grounds of precedence of Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, proposing the name Sirmuellera Kuntze in place of Banksia L.f.

(Proteaceae), in which he presents the first major revision of the genus for over a century. Ten new species and nine new varieties are published: B.&nbsp;aculeata (Prickly Banksia), B.&nbsp;chamaephyton (Fishbone Banksia), B.&nbsp;conferta (Glasshouse Banksia) (and therefore also the autonym B.&nbsp;conferta var. conferta, now B.&nbsp;conferta subsp. conferta), B.&nbsp;conferta var. penicillata (now B.&nbsp;conferta subsp. penicillata), B.&nbsp;cuneata (Matchstick Banksia), B.&nbsp;ericifolia var. macrantha (now B.&nbsp;ericifolia subsp. macrantha), B.&nbsp;gardneri var. brevidentata, B.&nbsp;gardneri var. hiemalis, B.&nbsp;grossa (Coarse Banksia), B.&nbsp;integrifolia var. aquilonia (now B.&nbsp;aquilonia), B.&nbsp;lanata (Coomallo Banksia), B.&nbsp;littoralis var. seminuda (now B.&nbsp;seminuda), B.&nbsp;meisneri var. ascendens (now B.&nbsp;meisneri subsp. ascendens), B.&nbsp;micrantha, B.&nbsp;nutans var. cernuella, B.&nbsp;plagiocarpa (Dallachy's Banksia), B.&nbsp;saxicola (Grampians Banksia), B.&nbsp;scabrella (Burma Road Banksia), B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa var. caesia, B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla and B.&nbsp;telmatiaea (Swamp Fox Banksia). B.&nbsp;collina is demoted to B.&nbsp;spinulosa var. collina, and B.&nbsp;cunninghamii was demoted to B.&nbsp;spinulosa var. cunninghamii. A new infrageneric classification is proposed, and lectotypes are declared for most pre-existing Banksia taxa.\n* 1984 — Barbara Rye promotes B.&nbsp;littoralis var. seminuda to species rank as B.&nbsp;seminuda.\n* 1984 - George publishes The Banksia Book.\n* February 1984 - Commencement of The Banksia Atlas project, a three-year nationwide program that mobilised over 400 volunteers to make field observations of Banksia specimens.\n* 1987 George publishes B.&nbsp;epica, B.&nbsp;oligantha (Wagin Banksia), B.&nbsp;leptophylla var. melletica and B.&nbsp;spinulosa var. neoanglica, all of which were discovered during The Banksia Atlas project.\n* 1988 — Publication of The Banksia Atlas.\n* 1996 — Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges publish A Cladistic Analysis of Banksia, in which they propose a number of changes to George's taxonomic arrangement.\n* 1996 — George promotes B.&nbsp;integrifolia subsp. aquilonia to species rank as B.&nbsp;aquilonia.\n* 1999 — George publishes a monograph on the taxonomy of Banksia as part of the Flora of Australia book series.

Accounts of its discovery differ, with some attributing Ann Pilkington, and others John Cullen.\n* 2002 — Peter Olde and Neil Marriott publish B.&nbsp;rosserae.\n* 2002 and 2005 — Austin Mast and co-authors publish cladistic analyses of genetic data, that suggest two large Banksia clades, which they name \"/Cryptostomata\" (\"hidden stomates\") and \"/Phanerostomata\" (\"visible stomates\"). Their results also strongly suggest that Banksia is polyphyletic with Dryandra.\n* 2007 Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transfer Dryandra to Banksia and publish B.&nbsp;subg. Spathulatae for the \"/Phanerostomata\", thereby redefining B.&nbsp;subg. Banksia as containing the \"/Cryptostomata\".\nReferences\n*"
