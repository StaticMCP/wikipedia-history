It hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on October 1, 1977, holding on to the spot for two weeks and peaked at no. 7 on the UK Singles Chart, remaining in the charts for nine weeks. The single was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, having sold two million units.\n\"Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band\" is one of two songs that became hits featuring music from the Star Wars movie. The other is \"Star Wars (Main Title),\" which is original music from the movie soundtrack by John Williams. The song reached the Top 10 concurrently with Meco's more popular version. Meco again jousted with Williams a few months later, with both artists issuing competing versions of music from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, both reaching the US and Canadian Top 40, but with Williams's version being more successful than Meco's.\nAs Meco was unavailable at the time to appear on TopPop during the peak commercial performance of the song, Penney de Jager's choreographed ballet ensemble was instead asked to perform an interpretive dance on the show, which aired on 5 November 1977 in the Netherlands.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1977–1978)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|South Africa (Springbok Radio)\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot Disco Singles\n|align=\"center\"|6\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot Soul Singles\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|-\n|US Billboard Adult Contemporary\n|align=\"center\"|18\n|-\n|US Cash Box Top 100\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|US Record World\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1977)\n!Rank\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|57\n|-\n|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)\n|align=\"center\"|76\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)\n|align=\"center\"|43\n|-\n|Netherlands (Single Top 100)\n|align=\"center\"|56\n|-\n|US Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|71\n|-\n|US Cash Box\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1978)\n!Rank\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|46\n|}\nCertifications\nReferences"
