Founded in 1980 with the first awards given in 1981, they honor and showcase excellence in fashion design. They have been sometimes referred to as \"the Oscars of fashion\".\nNominations are submitted by the Fashion Guild, a group of over 1,500 CFDA members including fashion editors, retailers, and stylists. Award winners are determined by vote and announced at an annual black tie event held in Manhattan. Award winners receive a trophy made by the New York firm Society Awards.\nHistory\n1980s\nThe 1981 awards were given out at the first annual CFDA awards ceremony on January 14, 1982 at a dinner in the New York Public Library. The winners had been announced two months before the ceremony which was originally scheduled for a television extravaganza in the fall of 1981. CFDA president Bill Blass had set off controversy when he announced that all of the nominees will be named winners to avoid televising designers as they lose awards. In response, nominee Geoffrey Beene rejected the award and said, \"The industry needs a major award for its merit, not its emotion.\"\nUnder new CFDA president Perry Ellis, the 1984 CFDA awards in January 1985 had a broadened set of awards that included special citations for MTV, Nike billboards, and Details magazine. According to Donna Karan, who headed the awards committee, \"We wanted these awards to go beyond designers. It's all about creativity and the whole scope of fashion.\" James Galanos received the first CFDA \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" in 1984, which the CFDA named after Geoffrey Beene. At the 1984 awards, Bill Blass presented the \"Eugenia Sheppard fashion award\" to Earl Blackwell and said it would be given annually \"for outstanding contribution to fashion journalism.\"\nThe CFDA Awards were staged at the New York Public Library until they moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the 1986 awards in January 1987. The CFDA's first \"Perry Ellis Award\" for new fashion talent was given to David Cameron in 1986, the award was named after the former council president who died that year.\n1990s\nThe CFDA's first \"International Award\" was given to Gianni Versace in 1992. Princess Diana attended the awards in January 1995 to present a special award to her friend Elizabeth Tilberis, the British-born Editor-in-Chief of ''Harper's Bazaar.\nIn 1997, for the first time, the CFDA did not release all of the award winners before the awards ceremony. The nominees of the \"Perry Ellis Awards\" were announced at a press conference in November 1997 but the winners were not named until the February 1998 awards ceremony. In 1999, the date of the event was changed from January to June when the awards were televised for the first time, as the 18th Annual American Fashion Awards'' on E! Entertainment Television, marking the beginning of a five-year partnership with General Motors.\nIn 1997, the CFDA Fashion Awards began including emerging designers.\n2000s\nThe CFDA's first \"Fashion Icon Award\" was given to American socialite C.Z. Guest in 2002. The award was given to Nicole Kidman in 2003 and to Sarah Jessica Parker in 2004. The CFDA decided to forgo the award in 2005, and instead gave the \"Award for Fashion Influence\" to Kate Moss. In 2002, the CFDA Fashion Awards also began a 17-year partnership with Swarovski that ended in 2019. In 2003, the awards for new designer talent, formerly known as the \"Perry Ellis Awards\", were renamed \"Swarovski's Perry Ellis Awards\" and included a monetary prize for the first time to reflect the sponsorship.\nCFDA Fashion Award winners\n1980s\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award\n!Womenswear Designer\n!Menswear Designer\n!Accessory Designer\n!Emerging Talent Award\n!International Award\n!Special Awards\n!Notes\n|-\n|1981\n|none\n|Geoffrey Beene; Perry Ellis; Calvin Klein (tie)\n|Jhane Barnes; Ralph Lauren; Alexander Julian (tie)\n|Barry Kieselstein-Cord (jewelry); Alex Mate and Lee Brooks (costume jewelry); Nancy Knox (men's shoes) (special awards for each)\n|none\n|Yves Saint Laurent (worldwide influence/International Fashion Award)\n|\n* Robert Lighton - khaki sportswear\n* Andrew Fezza - leather for men (or Award for Menswear);\n* Fernando Sanchez - Excellence in At-Homewear and Lingerie.\n|\n|-\n|1982\n|none\n|Norma Kamali\n|Perry Ellis\n|none\n|none\n|Karl Lagerfeld for Chloé (outstanding designer outside the U.S.)\n|\n* Outstanding fashion illustrator: Antonia Lopez.\n* Outstanding fashion photographer:  Bill Cunningham.\n|\n|-\n|1983\n|none\n|Calvin Klein\n|Perry Ellis\n|Patricia Underwood (hats)\n| none\n|Issey Miyake; Giorgio Armani\n|\n|\n|-\n|1984\n|James Galanos\n|none\n|none\n|none\n|Stephen Sprouse (best new designer)\n|none\n|\n* Astor Place Hair Designers - influence on contemporary hair design in America;\n* Annie Flanders - fresh approach to fashion journalism as editor and publisher of Details magazine;\n* Kitty D`Alessio, president of Chanel - \"revitalizing Chanel's image in the U.S.;\"\n* John Fairchild, chairman of Fairchild Publications - M magazine;\n* Ira Neimark and Dawn Mello - rejuvenating Bergdorf Goodman/leadership in retailing;\n* Peter Moore - Nike billboard advertising campaign;\n* Bruce Weber - fashion advertising photography;\n* Robert W.
