In 1839 he showed a pair of portrait busts at the Cincinnati Academy of Fine Arts, and subsequently moved to New York City. In 1841, after roughly two years in New York, he moved to Boston with an introduction from his friend William Cullen Bryant, where from 1843 he lived in Winchester, Massachusetts (at that time Woburn), from the early 1850s onward in the octagonal Edward A. Brackett House.\nIn October 1859, after the raid on Harper's Ferry, Brackett traveled to the jail there, where he made sketches and measurements of John Brown's head, which he subsequently cast as a bust. It is today (2022) at Tufts University.\nAfter serving one year in the Civil War, he turned to horticulture and the scientific breeding of fish.\nIn 1869, he was appointed to a state commission supervising inland fisheries, and became its head in 1873. From 1894 until his death he served as head of the Massachusetts Fish and Game Commission.\nHe died in Winchester on March 15, 1908.\nFamily\nEdward Brackett married Amanda Folger on November 27, 1842 in Charlestown, Massachusetts. They had four children; Frank, Walter, Lena, and Bessie. Amanda (Folger) Brackett died in 1871, at the age of 50.\nIn 1872, Brackett married Elizabeth F. Belville, his wife's niece. They had one daughter, Bertha, born in 1876.\nSelected sculptures\n* Washington Allston bust, 1844, Metropolitan Museum\n* Shipwrecked Mother and Child, 1848–51, Worcester Art Museum\n* Reverend Hosea Ballou, 1859, Mount Auburn Cemetery\n* Bust of John Brown, 1859, Tufts University.\nSelected books\n* Twilight Hours or Leisure Moments of an Artist, 1845\n*  The World We Live In, 1903\n* My House, Chips the Builder Threw Away, Gorham Press, 1904\n* Materialized Apparitions: If Not Beings From Another Life, What Are They, Gorham Press, 1908\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095523168 Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists entry]\n* [http://www.askart.com/artist/Edward_Augustus_Brackett/65290/Edward_Augustus_Brackett.aspx AskArt.com entry]\n*\n*\n* [http://homenewshere.com/daily_times_chronicle/news/winchester/article_43ed70d6-7c40-11e2-8f10-001a4bcf887a.html \"Edward A.
