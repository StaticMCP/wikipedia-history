The acronym \"CLASS\" stands for Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School. According to the award's official website, the recognition \"honors the attributes of NCAA Division I senior student-athletes in four areas: community, classroom, character and competition. The award program is designed exclusively for college seniors who are utilizing their complete athletic eligibility, remaining committed to their university and pursuing the many rewards a senior season can bring.\" NCAA Division I basketball coaches, media members, and fans vote during the selection process.\nHistory\nThe idea for the award came from legendary sportscaster Dick Enberg. A major storyline throughout the 2000–01 men's basketball season, and\nduring the broadcast of the 2001 championship game, was Duke player's Shane Battier's decision the previous summer to return to school for his senior season, despite being a projected first round NBA draft lottery pick if he had decided to turn pro. Later in 2001, Premier Sports Management announced the formation of the Senior CLASS Award and teamed up with the Kansas City Club to host an annual awards gala. Enberg agreed to serve as honorary chairman of the award and CBS Sports provided broadcast support, announcing the winner each year during the Final Four telecast. Enberg's idea for this award was originally to honor men's basketball seniors but over the ensuing years it expanded to other sports, with women's basketball seniors getting their first awardee one year later.\nIn September 2022, Premier Sports Management decided to \"take a pause\" on presenting future Senior CLASS award winners. They had been operating without an official corporate sponsor since 2012–13 and in 2022 decided it was time to look for a new one. Once they have a new sponsor they intend to resume the awards \"for years to come.\"\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Awarded a national player of the year award: Men – Sporting News; Oscar Robertson Trophy; Associated Press; NABC; UPI; Naismith; Wooden; Adolph Rupp TrophyWomen – Wade; Associated Press; Naismith; Wooden\n|}\nWinners\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Men\n!
