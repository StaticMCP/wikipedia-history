In 1961 it was still in use as a warehouse. In October 1974, it was designated a Grade II* listed building. In 2003 a £4.25 million restoration project converted the warehouse into residential accommodation and a restaurant.\nSee also\n*Grade II* listed buildings in Greater Manchester\n*Listed buildings in Manchester-M1\nReferences"
