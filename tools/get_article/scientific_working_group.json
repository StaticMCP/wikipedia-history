In 2014, the SWGs are being reorganized under the NIST Organization for Scientific Area Committees (OSAC). SWGs are not limited to forensic science. They are common in many other fields.\nAs of January 2012, active SWGs included the following:\n* FISWG - Facial Identification Scientific Working Group\n* SWGANTH - Forensic Anthropology\n* SWGCBRN - Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear\n* SWGDAM - DNA Analysis\n* SWGDE - Digital Evidence\n* SWGDMI - Medicolegal Death Investigation\n* SWGDOC - Questioned Documents\n* SWGDOG - Dogs and Orthogonal Detection\n* SWGDRUG - Analysis of Seized Drugs\n* SWGDVI - Disaster Victim Identification\n* SWGFAST - Latent Fingerprints\n* SWGFEX - Fire and Explosives Scenes\n* SWGGEO - Geological Materials\n* SWGGSR - Gunshot Residue\n* SWGGUN - Firearms and Toolmarks\n* SWGIBRA - Illicit Business Records\n* SWGIT - Imaging Technologies\n* SWGMAT - Materials Analysis\n* SWGSTAIN - Bloodstain Pattern Analysis\n* SWGTOX - Toxicology\n* SWGTREAD - Footwear and Tiretracks\n* SWGWILD - Wildlife Forensics\nEach SWG includes scientists working within the field of focus.  Although a couple of the above-listed SWGs have only American members, most of the groups have international members.  Federal, state or local government forensic laboratory scientists are the most common SWG members, but many SWGs also include other experts such as private laboratory scientists, academia, independent consultants, attorneys and judges.\nMost SWGs have public websites with discipline-specific resources including approved and drafts for comment standards, best practices guidelines and related documents.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nist.gov/forensics/workgroups.cfm NIST list of SWGs]\n*[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/april2003/swgdambylaws.htm SWGDAM bylaws]\n*[http://www.interpol.int/INTERPOL-expertise/Forensics Interpol Forensics]\n*[https://www.nist.gov/oles/forensics.cfm NIST OLES Forensics]\n*[http://www.ascld.org/ American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors]"
