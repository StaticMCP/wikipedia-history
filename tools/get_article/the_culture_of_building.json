      "text": "# The Culture of Building\n\nThe Culture of Building (Oxford University Press) is a 1999 book (reprinted in 2006) by Howard Davis, a professor of architecture at the University of Oregon. It describes how buildings throughout the ages and varied settings are products of a building culture – the \"coordinated system of knowledge, rules, procedures, and habit that surrounds the building process in a given place and time\". Davis suggests that this culture is a cross-global phenomenon in which thousands of buildings are produced through shared and predictable methods of working.\nNotes\nBibliography\n*"
