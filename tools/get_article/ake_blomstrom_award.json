It serves to promote the development of talented young radio documentary makers in the participating countries.\nThe Idea behind the prize\nÅke Blomström was always concerned about young radio talents, especially independent practitioners, who were at the beginning of their career as feature makers. This took practical form in three stages:\na) discovering them\nb) furthering the careers of those with talent,\nc) finally, having them present their best works in competitions, thus giving them international recognition.\nThe Award Process\nThe task of \"discovering and promoting\" has been carried out within the framework of the annual International Feature Conference. The task of \"providing international recognition\"\nhas been carried out within the framework of the Prix Futura Berlin.\nThe choice of winners has been carried out by a \"Selection Committee\", according to certain requirements, and has been financed by participating associates, from countries all around the world, for more than 30 years.\nInternational cooperation and financing\n* 1986–1992: Swedish Radio (SR in Sweden) 30.000 SEK per year for six years.\n* 1992–1994: Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR in Denmark), Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK in Norway), Swedish Radio and the Finnish Broadcasting Company (Yle in Finland).
