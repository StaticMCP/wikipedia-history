The VCRC is an independent public organization engaged in publishing and exhibition activities, scientific research, conducting public lectures, discussions, and conferences. From 2008 to 2012, it operated at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.\nIn 2015, the Visual Culture Research Center received the Princess Margriet Award from the European Cultural Foundation.\nIn 2017, the VCRC was the organizer and curator of the \"Kyiv International – Kyiv Biennale 2017,\" which included a series of exhibitions, lectures, discussions, and workshops with the participation of well-known international thinkers and artists.\nHistory\nEstablishment\nAmong the co-founders of the VCRC were , Nadia Parfan, Inna Sovsun, Olga Bryukhovetska and others. For some time the activities of the center were funded by membership fees, during the first years the participants worked on a volunteer basis.\n]]\nBeginning in 2008, the center was based at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.\nSuspension of the center's operation in February 2012\nOn February 7, 2012, the VCRC opened the contemporary art exhibit entitled \"Ukrainske Tilo\" (\"Ukrainian Body\"), which explored bodily existence in Ukrainian society. The show exhibited a mix of art pieces, including some that contained nude images and drawings. On February 10, 2012, Serhiy Kvit—president of the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA), where the exhibit was held—visited the show. He promptly ordered the closure of the exhibition, telling the media afterwards that \"The exhibition is not closed, it is just locked.\"\nKvit stated his actions were motivated by the fact that at the exhibition you can see not art, but \"shit\" or \"a disparate set of pornographic images.\" He later commented that the reason for closing the exhibition was not the content, but \"procedural problems\". On February 29, the exhibition was dismantled on schedule. Works of artists Oleksandr Volodarsky, Nikita Kadan, Sasha Kurmaz, Lada Nakonechnaya, Anatoliy Byelov, Yevheniya Belousets, Mykola Ridny, Volodymyr Say and others were presented there.\nOn February 23, 2012, by the decision of the Academic Council of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, the operation of the NaUKMA Visual Culture Research Center was suspended. On February 27, a protest action against the closure of the Center took place outside the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. On the same day, the director of the Visual Culture Research Center Vasyl Cherepanin decided to resign, handing over control to Inna Sovsun, after which Serhiy Kvit stated that the work of the center would be resumed.\nThe suspension in the operation of the center was supported by the Honorary President of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy Viacheslav Briukhovetsky.\nThe center was defended by David Eliott, curator of the First Kyiv Biennale, former President of Poland Aleksander Kwaśniewski, philosophers Slavoj Žižek, Judith Butler and Jacques Rancière, translator Andrii Riepa, artist Oleksandr Volodarsky.\nOn March 12, 2012, Serhiy Kvit issued an order according to which the Visual Culture Research Center was deprived of premises in the Old Academic Building of NaUKMA due to the emergency condition of the building.\nOn March 29, 2012, by the decision of the Academic Council of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, the Visual Culture Research Center was liquidated, in particular, among the main reasons for the closure of the center was the following: \"deliberate damage to the reputation of NaUKMA\", \"substitution of academic criteria by ideological and political\", \"intolerance of different opinions and views\", \"public discrediting of colleagues\", \"systematic misleading of the NaUKMA administration\".\nThe opening and presentation of the new program of the center was announced on April 26 in the premises of the Zhovten (October) cinema within the framework of the Seventh Berlin Biennale.\nSee also\n* Direct Action (trade union)\n* Commons (magazine)\n* European Cultural Foundation\n* Krytyka Polityczna\nReferences\nAdditional references\n* [http://vcrc.org.ua/ The Visual Culture Research Center]\n* [https://day.kyiv.ua/uk/article/kultura/my-ne-znaly-na-shcho-ydemo \"We didn't know what we were going for\".
