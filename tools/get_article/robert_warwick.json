A matinee idol during the silent film era, he also prospered after the introduction of sound to cinema. As a young man he had studied opera singing in Paris and had a rich, resonant voice. At the age of 50, he developed as a highly regarded, aristocratic character actor and made numerous \"talkies\".\nEarly life\nWarwick was born Robert Taylor Bien in 1878 to Louis and Isabel (Taylor) Bien.\nSome sources say he was born in England; others say Sacramento, California. His father was of French ethnicity. Bien studied music in Paris and trained for two years to be an opera singer, but acting proved to be his greater calling. He met his future wife, Arline Peck in Paris; the American couple married in 1902. After his return to the United States, he started in theatre and then film.\nStage\nWarwick (by then using his stage name) made his Broadway debut in 1903 in the play Glad of It. One of his co-stars was a young John Barrymore, also making his Broadway debut. Both actors, over time, became matinee idols. For the next twenty years Warwick appeared in such plays as Anna Karenina (1906), Two Women (1910), with Mrs. Leslie Carter; and The Kiss Waltz (1911) and Miss Prince (1912), in both of which he was able to display his singing voice.\nHe also appeared in The Secret (1913), A Celebrated Case (1915) and Drifting (1922) with Alice Brady, not to mention several other plays through the end of the 1920s.\nMilitary service\nWarwick served in the U.S. Army during World War I as an infantry captain and as a liaison officer with the French Army.\nFilm career\nWarwick started making silent films in 1914, with his early work including The Mad Lover (1917) and Thou Art the Man (1920). He made numerous productions in the 1910s primarily in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Two films, Alias Jimmy Valentine and ''A Girl's Folly'', both directed by Maurice Tourneur, have been preserved, and showcase Warwick as a silent actor, as well as Tourneur's directing talent. Both  are available in the 21st century on home video.\nFrom the 1920s on, Warwick alternated doing plays and silent films. He was fifty when sound films arrived, and though middle aged and with his matinee idol looks fading, he found plenty of work in character roles, much enhanced by his rich, resonant voice, eloquent diction, and aristocratic manner. When the studios moved to Los Angeles, Warwick followed.\nWarwick's extensive filmography includes such classics as The Little Colonel (1935) with Shirley Temple and The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) with Errol Flynn. He was one of a number of actors who frequently worked with director Preston Sturges and appeared in many of his films, among them ''Sullivan's Travels (1941), The Palm Beach Story (1942) and Hail the Conquering Hero (1944). He also appeared in I Married a Witch (1942) and Man from Frisco (1944).\nTelevision and later life\nWarwick made numerous appearances on television almost from its initial popularity in the late 1940s. In his seventies he was still hard at work and made appearances on every type of television show, from Westerns such as Broken Arrow and Sugarfoot, to the adventure series Rescue 8, to the science fiction series The Twilight Zone, to the anthology series The Loretta Young Show.\nPersonal life\nWarwick married Arline Peck in 1902; they had a daughter, Rosalind. They divorced in 1909.\nBy 1910, Warwick married actress Josephine Whittell (1883–1961), but the childless marriage also ended in divorce.\nIn 1930 he married Stella Larrimore (1905–1960) (a sister of Francine Larrimore). They had a daughter, Betsey, who later became a poet in Los Angeles.\nWarwick died June 6, 1964, in West Los Angeles, California, at age 85. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Survivors included his daughters and two grandchildren.\nComplete filmography\n(1917)]]\n(1919)]]\nSilent\n*The Dollar Mark (1914) as James \"Jim\" Gresham\n*The Man of the Hour (1914, extant) as Henry Garrison\n*Across the Pacific (1914, extant) as Minor Role (unconfirmed and uncredited)\n*Alias Jimmy Valentine (1915, extant) as Jimmy Valentine\n*The Man Who Found Himself (1915) as James Clarke\n*An Indian Diamond (1915 short)\n*The Face in the Moonlight (1915) as Victor / Rabat\n*The Stolen Voice'' (1915, extant, Library of Congress) as Gerald D'Orville\n*The Flash of an Emerald (1915) as Lucius Waldeck\n*The Sins of Society (1915) as Captain Dorian March\n*Fruits of Desire (1916) as Mark Truitt\n*The Supreme Sacrifice (1916) as David Aldrich\n*Human Driftwood (1916, lost) as Robert Hendricks\n*Sudden Riches (1916) as Robert Crewe\n*Friday the 13th (1916) as Robert Brownley\n*The Heart of a Hero (1916, extant) as Nathan Hale\n*All Man (1916) as Jim Blake\n*The Man Who Forgot (1917, lost) as The Man, later known as John Smith\n*''A Girl's Folly (1917, extant) as Kenneth Driscoll\n*The Argyle Case (1917, lost) as Asche Kayton\n*Hell Hath No Fury (1917)\n*The Family Honor (1917) as Captain Stephen Wayne\n* The False Friend (1917) as William Ramsdell\n*The Silent Master (1917) as Valentin, aka Monsieur Simon\n* The Mad Lover (1917) as Robert Hyde\n*The Accidental Honeymoon (1918, incomplete, fragment in the Library of Congress) as Robert Courtland\n*Secret Service (1919, lost) as Major Lewis K.
