The review praised the graphics and sound, but found the fight sequences both too easy and too short, since all enemies could be defeated in one hit and turned their backs shortly after attacking the player. Compute! liked the Commodore 64 version, approving of the graphics and describing gameplay as \"quite addicting\", but criticizing lack of savegame and replay value.\nIt reached number one in the UK charts, replacing RoboCop which had held the top spot for a record 36 weeks.\nNintendo Power, reviewing the NES version, praised the action gameplay and noted that the music and levels helped recreate the feel of the movie. Nintendo Power was not impressed with the character graphics but stated that the animation \"is quite good\" for the NES. Nintendo Power praised the Game Boy version for its graphics, password system, and challenging gameplay, but criticized the poor \"hit detection\" and the time limits on each level, both of which made the game more difficult. The action game features six levels and a password feature. Game Players rated the NES version 52 percent.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*"
