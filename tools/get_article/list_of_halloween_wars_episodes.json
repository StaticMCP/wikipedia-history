Both teams get two assistants in the second, main round.\nThe teams work outside, in an actual farm, and their displays are put out on the trail where dozens of hayriders will ride through, try some special treats, and choose the winning set piece. Each episode, a winning team gets $15,000. Harley Morenstein serves as the host.
