The low-level bridge was constructed over the creek at the crossing in 1917. The approaches to the bridge were carried away by flood water in 1923. In 1935, ongoing problems with the low-level bridge resulted in a request to the Queensland Government to build a high-level bridge. A weir for irrigation just upstream of the crossing was also proposed.\nFicks Crossing National Fitness Camp operated at 47 Ficks Crossing Road from 1980 to 2008.\nThe Silver Lining School in Ficks Crossing was established in 2019 with a program for young men. In 2021, a program for young women was introduced.\nDemographics\nIn the , Ficks Crossing had a population of 37 people.\nIn the , Ficks Crossing had a population of 39 people.\nEducation\nSilver Lining School is a private secondary school for boys and girls at 14722 Bunya Highway ().

The school draws most of its students from neighbouring Cherbourg. In 2022, the school had 22 students in the young men's program and 13 students in the young women's program.\nThe nearest government primary schools are Wheatlands State School in neighbouring Wheatlands to the north-west, Murgon State School in neighbouring Murgon to the east, and Wondai State School in neighbouring Wondai to the south-west.
