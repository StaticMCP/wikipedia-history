It is managed by Tanjong Pagar Town Council. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency is Eric Chua from the governing People's Action Party (PAP).\nHistory\nFirst existence (1955–1988)\nQueenstown Constituency was established prior to the 1955 general election in colonial Singapore. Lee Choon Eng from the Labour Front (LF) defeated candidates from the Democratic Party (DP) and Progressive Party (PP) with 67.28% of the vote.\nDuring the 1959 general election, PAP candidate Lee Siew Choh won the constituency with 53.81% of the vote, consistent with the party's initial rise to power where it won 43 out of 51 seats in the Legislative Assembly. However, he would leave the PAP in 1961, after it expelled its left-wing faction, to become a member of Barisan Sosialis (BS), a new party started by members of the faction.\nIn the 1963 general election, Lee Siew Choh did not run for Queenstown; Jek Yeun Thong reclaimed it for the PAP, defeating Lee Ek Chong from BS and two other candidates with 52.81% of the vote. He would retain the constituency, both unopposed and against different opposition candidates, until the 1988 general election, after Singapore had become independent and the Legislative Assembly had been replaced with the Parliament of Singapore.\nIn 1988, the constituency was merged into Brickworks Group Representation Constituency (GRC) following the establishment of GRCs. All constituencies represented by a single MP were renamed single-member constituencies.\nSecond existence (2025–present)\nPrior to the 2025 general election, Queenstown Single Member Constituency was carved out of Tanjong Pagar GRC, which it had belonged to as a division.\nThe PAP fielded Eric Chua, the incumbent MP for the Queenstown division of Tanjong Pagar GRC, to stand for reelection in the SMC. He defeated Mahaboob Batcha from the People's Alliance for Reform (PAR) with 81.13% of the vote, the largest PAP vote share in a constituency in the general election.\nMembers of Parliament\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|Year\n|Member\n| colspan=\"2\" |Party\n|-\n| colspan=4 bgcolor=black |Formation\n|-\n|1955\n|Lee Choon Eng\n| bgcolor=\"\" |\n|LF\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1959\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Lee Siew Choh\n|bgcolor=\"\" |\n|PAP\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"\" |\n|BS\n|-\n|1963\n|Jek Yeun Thong\n|bgcolor=\"\" |\n|PAP\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |Parliament of Singapore\n|-\n|1968\n| rowspan=\"5\" | Jek Yeun Thong\n| rowspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"\"|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |PAP\n|-\n|1972\n|-\n|1976\n|-\n|1980\n|-\n|1984\n|-\n| colspan=4 bgcolor=black |Constituency abolished (1988–2025)\n|-\n|2025\n|Eric Chua\n|bgcolor=\"\" |\n|PAP\n|}\nElectoral results\nElections in 1950s\n}}\n}}\n33.62}}\n0.30}}\n0.30}}\n33.59}}\n51.59}}\nElections in 1960s\n}}\n1.00}}\n0.73}}\n0.10}}\n0.10}}\n3.14}}\n51.59}}\n1.00}}\n0.37}}\nElections in 1970s\n}}\n4.27}}\n9.05}}\nElections in 1980s\n3.10}}\n3.63}}\nElections in 2020s\n}}\nReferences"
