The result of the first battle was a Venetian defeat, and although the second engagement ended in a draw, the Venetian position in Chios became untenable, forcing Zeno to abandon the island, which had been captured a few months earlier.\nIn the first engagement, Venetian casualties were 142 killed and 300 wounded on the sailing ships, excluding the three ships lost, and 323 killed and 303 wounded on the galleys. All together, less than 2500 casualties. In the second engagement, the Venetians were at a numerical disadvantage, due to the loss of three ships and the absence of the damaged San Vittorio. Venetian deaths were 132, and Fama Volante was damaged, along with 2 Ottoman sailing ships.\nOpposing forces (9 February)\nVenice (Zeno)\n* Stella Maris - Blew up\n* Rosa 60\n* San Lorenzo Giustinian 70/80\n* Leon Coronato - Blew up\n* Nettuno 50/60\n* Valor Coronato 54\n* San Domenico 60\n* Redentore del Mundo 70\n* Vittoria 50/60\n* San Nicolo 54\n* Sacra Lega 60\n* Drago Volante c.60 - Blew up\n* Fama Volante 50\n* Madonna della Salute 50\n* Venere Armata 52\n* Ercole Vittorioso 50/60\n* San Antonio di Padova c.50\n* Pace ed Abbondanza 50\n* San Giovanni Battista Piccolo c.50\n* San Vittorio 62 - Damaged\n* San Giovanni Battista Grande 60\n* 5 galleasses\n* 21 galleys\nRegency of Algiers (Mezzo Morto)\n* 20 sailing ships\n* 24 galleys\nReferences\n*"
