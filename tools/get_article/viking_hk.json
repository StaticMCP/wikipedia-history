The team plays their home matches in Hetlandshallen.\nHistory\nThe same year the club was founded, a concrete sporting plan was set up, to move up from the 3rd division to the 1st division (the top division of the time) within 5 years. The team moved up to the 2nd division 1986/1987 season, and were on the rise the following year, but it was missed when they lost the qualification against Kristiansand with 1 goal.\nAfter winning the 2nd division season 1988/1989, it was clear for the top series. The same season the team also played for the NM finals where the opponent became the arch rival Stavanger Idrettsforening. Viking Handball klubb won the match 21-17 ahead of 5&nbsp;000 spectators.\nSeries and end games in Norway\nViking Handball has won the series once (the 1997/1998 season), they have 2 silver, and won the NM 4 times (the seasons 1987/1988, 1993/1994, 1996/1997 and 2000/2001).\nParticipation international\nBest position internationally came when the team reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winner Cup in the 1997/98 season. Led by Christian Berge and Jan Thomas Lauritzen, losses 46-51 were combined against Caja Cantabria Santander Spain who won the Cup Winner Cup this year (Total 51–39 over HSG Dutenhofen / Münchholzhausen Germany ). Otherwise, Viking has reached the quarterfinals of the EHF Cup and participated in the Champions League.\nMerging\nThe club has always been independent, but on 17 February 2000 the club entered into a collaboration with Stavanger IF on elite efforts. The teams formed Stavanger Handball and took the logo of Viking Handball Klubb.\nThis collaboration came about in an attempt to reach the top of Norwegian handball and stay there. The collaboration began in the youth department, via junior teams, and up to the senior departments. The clubs were still independent, but after the 2008/2009 season (which ended in relegation), it was called to an extraordinary annual meeting 14 February 2009, where it was decided that the collaboration should end when Stavanger Idrettsforening wanted to withdraw.\nThe years after Stavanger Håndball\nThe first year as \"\" New \"Viking Handball\", they won the 1st division over Vålerenga by 4 points, and moved straight up to the elite series again, where it was 6th place on the first try\n2010/2011 - Won 1 division, advanced to the elite\n2011/2012 - 9th place in the elite\n2012/2013 - Last place in the elite\n2013/2014 - Relegated to 1st Division handball for men.\n2014/2015 - 3rd place 1st division\n2015/2016 - Promotion to the elite\n2016/2017 - Last in the elite series and relegated again\n2017/2018 - Further down to 2 divisions\n2018/2019 - Won 2 Division 3 Division and moved directly into 1 Division again\n2019/2020 - 2 place 1 division - There is promotion to the elite with 5 games left to play (as of February 24, 2020).
