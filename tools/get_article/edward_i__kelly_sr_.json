In the mid-1930s, the brothers went to work for J. W. Y. Martin, a trainer and racehorse stable proprietor who owned Snow Hill Farm, in Glyndon, Maryland in the Worthington Valley. In 1937, Eddie Kelly went to work in Kentucky for Edward Moore's Circle M Ranch. However, both brothers had their careers interrupted when they joined  the United States armed forces during World War II.\nEddie Kelly served with the Army in Europe, and was decorated with several medals, receiving the Purple Heart, Bronze Star Medal and Oak Leaf Cluster. Following his discharge at war's end he returned to horse racing and in 1945 obtained his training license. In 1949 he was hired by Baltimore clothing manufacturer Harry Isaacs to train for his Brookfield Farm racing stable. Brookfield would be Kelly's major client for the next forty two years until Isaacs' death in 1990.\nMost notable among the horses trained by Eddie Kelly was Intentionally, the 1959 American Champion Sprint Horse. He also owned horses he trained and raced including Lucky Coin, winner of the Kelso Handicap who also set a Belmont Park turf course record of 1:32.00 for one mile.\nReferences\n* [http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/national-news/2004/September/02/Kelly-trainer-of-champion-Intentionally-dies.aspx September 02, 2004 Thoroughbred Times article titled Kelly, trainer of champion Intentionally, dies]"
