The result was a victory for incumbent president Park Chung-hee, who received 53% of the vote. Voter turnout was 80%. Within a year of his re-election, Park declared martial law and introduced the Yushin Constitution, which vested him with sweeping and near-dictatorial powers.\nThese would be the last contested presidential elections in South Korea until 1981, the last direct presidential election until 1987, and last presidential election in which the victor received an absolute majority of the popular vote until Park's daughter, Park Geun-hye, did so in 2012.\nNominations\nDemocratic Republican Party\nThe DRP Convention was held on 17 March 1971, at which incumbent president Park Chung-hee became the presidential nominee. Under the constitution, Park would have normally been ineligible to run in 1971, as presidents were limited to two consecutive terms. However, shortly after his re-election in 1967, the DRP-dominated legislature passed a constitutional amendment allowing the incumbent president to run for three consecutive terms.\nNew Democratic Party\nBy tradition, the most senior members of the party leadership were supposed to run for president. It was assumed that either former Korea University president Yu Jin-oh, the sitting party chair Yu Jin-san, or former president Yun Po-sun would be chosen for the party's candidate. However, the norm was broken by lawmaker Kim Young-sam, who was only in his early forties, when he declared his bid for the New Democratic nomination for president on 8 November 1969. He was followed by Kim Dae-jung and Lee Cheol-seung, both prominent politicians in their forties. The party leadership tried to discourage the three candidates at first, but later conceded that it was now time for the new generation to take over. Lee Cheol-seung withdrew his bid and endorsed Kim Dae-jung after the party leadership, including Chairman Yu Jin-san, announced they would be backing Kim Young-sam.\nAt the convention held on 29 September 1970, the establishment-endorsed Kim Young-sam surprisingly lost to the minority faction's Kim Dae-jung, who became the party's candidate.\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!rowspan=2|Candidate\n!colspan=2|First round\n!colspan=2|Second round\n|-\n!Delegates\n!%\n!Delegates\n!%\n|-\n|align=left|Kim Dae-jung||382||43.16||458||51.81\n|-\n|align=left|Kim Young-sam||421||47.57||410||46.38\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||82||9.27||16||1.81\n|- style=font-weight:bold\n|align=left|Total||885||100||884||100\n|}\nResults\n|party3=People's Party|votes3=122914\n|cand4=|party4=|votes4=43753\n|cand5=Lee Jong-yun|party5=Liberal Democratic Party|votes5=17823\n|invalid=494606\n|electorate=15552236\n|source=Nohlen et al.\n}}\nBy province and city\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Province/City\n! colspan=2 class=\"unsortable\" | Park Chung Hee\n! colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Kim Dae-jung\n! colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Jin Bok-ki\n! colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Park Gi-chul\n! colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Lee Jong-yun\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:\" |\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:\" |\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:\" |\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:\" |\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:\" |\n|-\n! width=\"75px\" | Votes\n! %\n! width=\"75px\" | Votes\n! %\n! width=\"75px\" | Votes\n! %\n! width=\"75px\" | Votes\n! %\n! width=\"75px\" | Votes\n! %\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align:left\" | Seoul\n|805,772\n|39.95\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |1,198,018\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |59.40\n|6,881\n|0.34\n|4,811\n|0.24\n|1,426\n|0.07\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |Busan\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |385,999\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |55.66\n|302,452\n|43.61\n|1,974\n|0.28\n|2,518\n|0.36\n|583\n|0.08\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |Gyeonggi\n|687,985\n|48.87\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |696,582\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |49.48\n|13,770\n|0.98\n|6,547\n|0.47\n|2,995\n|0.21\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |Gangwon\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |502,722\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |59.85\n|325,556\n|38.76\n|7,326\n|0.87\n|2,985\n|0.36\n|1,390\n|0.17\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |North Chungcheong\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |312,744\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |57.32\n|222,106\n|40.70\n|6,989\n|1.28\n|2,662\n|0.49\n|1,154\n|0.21\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |South Chungcheong\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |556,632\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |53.49\n|461,978\n|44.39\n|14,411\n|1.38\n|5,285\n|0.51\n|2,322\n|0.22\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |North Jeolla\n|308,850\n|35.49\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |535,519\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |61.53\n|21,162\n|2.43\n|3,167\n|0.36\n|1,646\n|0.19\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |South Jeolla\n|479,737\n|34.43\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |874,974\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |62.80\n|31,986\n|2.30\n|4,362\n|0.31\n|2,122\n|0.15\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |North Gyeongsang\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |1,333,051\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |75.62\n|411,116\n|23.32\n|9,838\n|0.56\n|6,438\n|0.37\n|2,374\n|0.13\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |South Gyeongsang\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |891,119\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |73.36\n|310,595\n|25.57\n|6,793\n|0.56\n|4,580\n|0.38\n|1,634\n|0.13\n|-\n| align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |Jeju\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |78,217\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |56.85\n|57,004\n|41.43\n|1,784\n|1.30\n|398\n|0.29\n|177\n|0.13\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=\"11\" |\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"font-weight:bold; background:#E9E9E9;\"\n| align=\"left\" | Total\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |6,342,828\n| style=\"background:; color:white;\" |53.20\n| 5,395,900\n| 45.26\n| 122,914\n| 1.03\n| 43,753\n| 0.37\n| 17,823\n| 0.15\n|}\nReferences"
