      "text": "# United States presidential elections in North Carolina\n\n| voted_winning = 40\n| voted_losing = 19\n}}\nFollowing is a table of United States presidential elections in North Carolina, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1789, North Carolina has participated in every U.S. presidential election except the election of 1864, during the American Civil War, when the state had seceded to join the Confederacy. North Carolina did not participate in the 1788–89 United States presidential election, as it did not ratify the Constitution of the United States until months after the end of that election and after George Washington had assumed office as President of the United States.\nWinners of the state are in bold. The shading refers to the state winner, and not the national winner.\nElections from 1864 to present\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become president, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" | Year\n!
