The 2020 state election gave the Labor Party a majority in parliament, winning 52 of 93 seats (55.91%). The First day of the opening of the 57th Parliament of Queensland was 24 November 2020.\nMajor events and legislation\n2021\nEuthanasia in Queensland}}\n* In May 2021, following a three-year Queensland Law Reform Commission (QLRC) report on the legal framework of assisted suicide, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's government introduced the [https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/whole/html/bill.first/bill-2021-028 Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2021] (introduced by Minister for Health and Ambulance Services, Yvette D'Ath), which would legalise voluntary assisted dying (VAD). The bill sat in parliamentary committee's for  before being read a third time. The bill was discussed extensively (over three days) and received criticism and reservations from many MPs, including Labor member for Logan, Linus Power. The bill passed 61–30, receiving royal assent on 26 September 2021. Upon the bill's succession through parliament, marches and rallies began, calling for the proposed legislation to be terminated. The bill did not come into effect until 1 January 2023.\n2023\ntransgender rights movement|Legal status of transgender peoplelegal status of transgender people}}\n* On 30 March 2023, a bill, colloquially known as ''[https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/bill.first/bill-2022-045 Jack's Law] (Police Powers and Responsibilities (Jack's Law) Amendment Bill 2022) after Jack Beasley, whom was stabbed to death in 2019, passed through Parliament. The new legislation gives powers to the Queensland Police Service (QPS) to randomly stop and search people for knives and other weapons on public transport and in [https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/hospitality-tourism-sport/liquor-gaming/liquor/safe-night-precincts/maps Safe Night Precincts] across Queensland. Using hand-held metal detectors, the legislation allows Queensland Police Service (QPS) to stop and search anyone within the aforementioned areas. The law came into place following a lengthy trial on the Gold Coast. The new legislation was criticised by the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties (QCCL) ( after its initial introduction into parliament), whom stated: \"This legislation authorizes mass, suspicion less, warrantless magnetometer searches.\" Adding: \"The traditional requirement that before a search can proceed there must be a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed or a weapon found is a bulwark protection of our liberty. Such a requirement is essential to being able to prevent arbitrary searches or searches based on bias. The granting of such powers will inevitably result in unwarranted invasions of privacy.\"\n* On 2 December 2022, the Attorney-General and Minister for Women, Shannon Fentiman, introduced the [https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/bill.first/bill-2021-043 Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Bill 2022] (BDMR Bill), later titled the [https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/act-2023-017 Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 2023] (BDMR Act), into Parliament. The bill, if passed, would give residents of Queensland (cited as trans and gender diverse people) the ability to formally register the change of their sex without the requirement of undergoing sexual reassignment surgery, alongside other reforms. The legislation in place at the time of the introduction of the BDMR Bill allowed for the change of sex on birth certificates if a statutory declaration provided from two medical practitioners verified one had undergone \"sexual reassignment\" surgery. Fentiman told The Courier-Mail'' that the current laws in place “unnecessarily medicalises the recognition of a person's lived identity.” Following the bills introduction into parliament, it was referred to the \"Legal Affairs and Safety Committee\" for consideration, and heard from various organisations, including the Queensland Human Rights Commission (QHRC), Queensland Law Society (QLS), Queensland Family and Child Commission, Women's Forum Australia and the Australian Christian Lobby (ACL). The bill passed through the committee process in April ( after its introduction). On 14 June 2023 the BDMR Bill passed 50–34, with the approval of both Greens MPs. Following the passing of the bill, New South Wales became the only remaining Australian state or territory that had not implemented any legislative gender self-identification reforms, like the requirement for gender-affirming surgery.\nLeadership\nMembers of the Queensland Parliament}}\nSpeaker\nThe incumbent Speaker and member for Mulgrave, Curtis Pitt, was re-elected as Speaker following the opening of Parliament on 24 November 2020.
