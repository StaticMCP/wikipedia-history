The -story wood-frame house was built in the 1860s, and is one of the city's finest Italianate houses.  The L-shaped house dominated by a three-story square tower with a shallow hip roof that has a bracketed and modillioned eave. An elaborately decorated entry projects from the tower.  Windows are varied in shape, including round-arch windows with drip moulding, and single and doubled sash windows.  The house was built by James Baxter Jr., whose daughter Helen married Theophilus King.  King owned a leather business in Boston and was president of the Granite Trust Company.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.\nReferences"
