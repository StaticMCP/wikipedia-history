It encompasses the shared language, various art forms, food culture, folklore, and traditional customs. Hakka culture stemmed from the culture of Ancient Han Chinese, who migrated from China's central plain to what is modern day's Southern China during the 6th to 13th century, and intermixed with local non-Han Hmong–Mien speaking ethnic groups such as the Yao people, the She people, and the Miao people. It has also been influenced by the cultures of surrounding Han Chinese groups, such as the Cantonese and the Hoklo. Having historically lived in the mountains of Southern China and being minority groups in many of the surrounding Chinese provinces, the Hakka have developed a culture characterized by reservedness, stability, and frugality.\nLanguage\nArchitecture\nHakka walled village\nHakka earthen building\nHorn House\nArts\nHakka hill song\nHakka opera\nHakkapop\nHakkapop is a genre of Hakka pop music made primarily in Taiwan, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.\nCuisine\nTraditionally engaging in large amount of physical labor, Hakka people favor salty food and marinated vegetables that enable them to maintain their stamina.\nMartial arts\nThe Hakka community is a source for a variety of martial arts including Southern Praying Mantis, Bak Mei and Southern Dragon kung fu.\nClothing\n* Shanku - coat and trousers worn by both Hakka men and women; the preferred colour is usually black and blue.
