The event is inspired by Jamaican sound system culture, where four crews compete against each other in genre-bending musical competition. Each crew is allocated their own stage in various corners of the venue, engaging in a four to five-round battle featuring genres such as hyper-pop, reggaeton, hardcore, hip-hop, and more.
