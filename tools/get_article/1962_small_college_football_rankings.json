Separate rankings were published by the Associated Press (AP) and the United Press International (UPI). The AP rankings were selected by a board of eight sports writers, and the UPI rankings were selected by a board of small-college coaches from throughout the country.\nIn the final AP poll, Florida A&M was rated No. 1. The Rattlers subsequently lost to Jackson State in the Orange Blossom Classic. Other teams ranked by the AP included Wittenberg (9–0) at No. 2 and the Central State Bronchos (11–0) at No. 3.\nIn the final UPI poll, Southern Miss (9–1) was selected as the small-college national champion. Southern Miss lost one game – to Memphis State by an 8–6 score.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n|
