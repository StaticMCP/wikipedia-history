The division was formed by Etelä-Häme (South Tavastia) military province from the men in Kanta-Häme (Tavastia proper) and Lounais-Häme (South-western Tavastia) civil guard districts.\nHistory\nThe division was intended to be used as the reserve of the Finnish High Command, but was subordinated to the VI Corps prior to the start of the war. As part of the Army of Karelia, the division advanced towards lake Onega and the river Svir during the 1941 Finnish offensive phase.\nAt the onset of the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk offensive, the division was stationed on the river Svir, from where it conducted a fighting retreat during the offensive. As the situation stabilized, the division had established a defensive position in the region of Sortavala.\nFormation\nAfter formation the division consisted of the following sub-units:\n*Infantry Regiment 2 (JR2)\n*Infantry Regiment 23 (JR23)\n*Infantry Regiment 44 (JR44)\n*Field Artillery Regiment 3 (KTR3)\n*Heavy Artillery Battalion 24 (RaskPsto 24)\n*Light Detachment 4 (KevOs 4)\n*Engineer Battalion 21 (PionP 21)\n*Signals Battalion 23 (VP23)\nThe 5th Division was mostly equipped according to division generic organization, but because of material shortage it lacked the anti-aircraft machine gun company and some material quantities did not reach the intended amounts.\nCommanders\n5.
