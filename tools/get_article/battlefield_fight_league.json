Since its founding, it has established itself as the largest Canadian MMA promoter.\nHistory\nBefore the founding of the BFL, MMA was banned in Vancouver; however, the organization followed other provinces in fully legalizing the sport in Canada. In 2010, the promotion was founded by Jay Golshani and Trevor Carroll.\nBattlefield Fight League held its inaugural BFL 1 event on May 15, 2010, at Rocky Mountaineer Station in Vancouver.\nIn 2024, BFL renewed its contract with UFC Fight Pass, which it had signed three years earlier, to broadcast fights.\nCurrent champions\nSource:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
