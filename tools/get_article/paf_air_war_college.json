The college was affiliated with University of Karachi from 1980 to 2005, Air University Pakistan from 2005 to 2007, since then affiliated with the National Defence University, Islamabad along with other staff and war colleges of the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Navy.\nHistory\nEstablished at PAF Station Drigh Road on 5 January 1959 with Commandant Air Commodore CBE Burt Andrews borrowed on Secondment from the Royal Air Force.\nThe college was housed in a converted hospital building at the station and was inaugurated by President of Pakistan Muhammad Ayub Khan. After conducting the initial courses, the RAF component of the faculty which comprised three officers reverted to their parent organization in December 1961. The college was then taken over entirely by the officers from Pakistan Air Force.\nIn 1980, the Bachelor of Defence Management Cell was created to offer Bachelor of Defence Management courses, affiliated with the Institute of Business Administration at Karachi University for awarding degrees. Due to rapid technological advancements in modern warfare, the PAF recognized the need for a specialized institution focused on the study of war-related matters. Consequently, the Staff College was elevated to the status of an Air War College in 1987 under Commandant Air Commodore Nasir Ali.\nThis transformation included significant changes to the curriculum, upgrading the 45-week course to an Air War Course. In 1989, officers from friendly nations were admitted for the first time, and the entire organization relocated to a newly constructed building in 1990. The new facility was inaugurated by President of Pakistan Ghulam Ishaq Khan on 8 December 1991. Officers from allied countries include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Yemen and Zimbabwe are regular participants of the Air War course.\nIn August 2007, the In-Service Education Scheme for mid-career officers got replaced by Officers' Military Education. This change brought the officers' training program under the authority of the college's Commandant. Consequently, the Basic Staff School and Junior Command and Staff School were combined into a single entity known as JC&SS at PAF Camp Badaber. As of August 2010, the institution has seen 28 Staff Courses, 54 Senior Command and Staff Courses, and 23 Air War Courses successfully graduate.\nCourses\nThe college offers two courses: the Air War Course (AWC) and the Senior Command and Staff Course (SC&SC). The AWC is designed to ready senior officers from the Pakistan Air Force and other countries for \"senior command and staff roles,\" while the SC&SC is intended to \"prepare mid-career PAF officers for taking on command and staff duties suitable for their rank and experience.\" After successfully completing the War Course, participants receive the 'fawc' symbol from the College and a Master of Science in War Studies from the National Defence University, Islamabad.\nOrganization\nSince 1996, the college is commanded by an Air Vice Marshal. Under the Commandant is a Deputy Commandant/Chief Instructor War Wing, which are both Air Commodores. In March, 2021, the College was upgraded to Institute (Degree Awarding Institute - DAI). Consequently, the 'Commandant' designation was replaced by the 'President' Air War College Institute. The Officer Commanding the Junior Command & Staff School is a Group Captain, who has a Chief Instructor Basic Staff Wing and Chief Instructor Junior Staff Wing under him.\nMission\nTo educate senior air leaders in Doctrine, Policy, Strategy, Air power employment concept and prepare for war.\nNotable alumni\nPakistani\n*Nur Khan, 3rd Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Air Force\n*Air Commodore Sajad Haider, 1965 War Hero\n*Zulfiqar Ali Khan, 2nd Chief of Air Staff\n*Anwar Shamim, 3rd Chief of Air Staff\n*Jamal A.
