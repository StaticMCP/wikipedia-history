The landing of the British expeditionary force under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby was intended to defeat or drive out an estimated 21,000 remaining French troops in Egypt. The fleet commanded by Baron Keith included seven ships of the line, five frigates and a dozen smaller warships. With the troop transports, it was delayed in the bay for several days by strong gales and heavy seas before disembarkation could proceed.\nBackground\n) at the Battle. Edward Daniel Clarke]]\nIn the early morning of the 8th March 1801, the landing force consisting of Flank companies of the 40th and the Welsh Fusiliers on the right. In the centre the 28th, 42nd and 58th. On the left, the Brigade of Guards, (formed from a battalion of each regiment) The Corsican Rangers, The Royals and 54th. The landing force totaled 5,230 men. All troops were on board the landing boats by 2 am. Its sailors tightly packed with muskets between their knees, the boats rowed silently to the rendezvous, each were placed in their positions of landing. By 8 am, each brigade was in place.\nBattle\nAt 9 am, a rocket fired from the Admirals ship signaled the advance and the boats sprang forward. The French garrison of Alexandria under Louis Friant, some 2,500 French troops and ten field guns in high positions took a heavy toll on the British. With protection from light armed vessels, ketches and bomb brigs moored broadside to the beach, the troops beached their craft under a rainstorm of cannonade and musket fire from Friant's troops positioned on the high dunes. The British disembarked, formed line, fixed bayonets and advanced. With General Moore leading  at their head they struggled up the steep soft sandy ground.\nThe French appeared at the summit and poured a destructive musket volley. The lead troops of the 42nd reached the summit before the French could reload and launched a bayonet charge, hurling them back in confusion. The French counter attacked with a squadron of cavalry, a second bayonet charge by the 42nd caused them to flee. On the left the Guards were attacked by French cavalry and the 54th by a French bayonet charge; both attacks were repulsed. The British were now in control of the shore and advanced to expand the bridgehead; the French deserted their guns.\nAftermath\nBy evening the Royal Navy had landed the remainder of the 17,500-strong army and its equipment in an orderly fashion and consolidated control at Aboukir. The skirmish was a prelude to the Battle of Alexandria and resulted in British losses of 730 killed and wounded or missing. The French withdrew, losing at least 300 dead or wounded and eight pieces of cannon. Napoleon later described the British landing as \"one of the most vigorous actions which could be imagined\".\nOrders of battle\nBritish\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=|Brigade and commander\n!style=|Regiment\n!style=|Number of men\n!style=|Ref.\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"white\"|First line\n|rowspan=32|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Brigade of GuardsMajor-General George Ludlow\n|1st Battalion, Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards\n|766\n|-\n|1st Battalion, Third Regiment of Foot Guards\n|812\n|-\n|rowspan=4|1st BrigadeMajor-General Eyre Coote\n|2nd Battalion, 1st Regiment of Foot\n|626\n|-\n|1st Battalion, 54th Regiment of Foot\n|rowspan=2|974 (combined)\n|-\n|2nd Battalion, 54th Regiment of Foot\n|-\n|92nd Regiment of Foot\n|529\n|-\n|rowspan=4|2nd BrigadeMajor-General John Cradock\n|8th Regiment of Foot\n|439\n|-\n|13th Regiment of Foot\n|561\n|-\n|18th Regiment of Foot\n|411\n|-\n|90th Regiment of Foot\n|727\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Second line\n|-\n|rowspan=4|3rd BrigadeMajor-General Lord Cavan\n|1st Battalion, 27th Regiment of Foot\n|rowspan=2|Left sick at Gibraltar and Malta\n|-\n|2nd Battalion, 27th Regiment of Foot\n|-\n|50th Regiment of Foot\n|477\n|-\n|79th Regiment of Foot\n|604\n|-\n|rowspan=4|4th BrigadeBrigadier-General John Doyle\n|2nd Regiment of Foot\n|530\n|-\n|30th Regiment of Foot\n|412\n|-\n|44th Regiment of Foot\n|263\n|-\n|89th Regiment of Foot\n|378\n|-\n|rowspan=3|5th (Foreign) BrigadeBrigadier-General John Stuart\n|Stuart's Regiment\n|929\n|-\n|Roll's Regiment\n|528\n|-\n|Dillon's Regiment\n|530\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Reserve\n|-\n|rowspan=6|Major-General John MooreBrigadier-General Hildebrand Oakes\n|23rd Regiment of Foot\n|457\n|-\n|28th Regiment of Foot\n|587\n|-\n|42nd Regiment of Foot\n|754\n|-\n|58th Regiment of Foot\n|469\n|-\n|40th Regiment of Foot\n|250\n|-\n|Corsican Rangers (flank companies)\n|209\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Cavalry\n|-\n|rowspan=4|Brigadier-General Edward Finch\n|11th Light Dragoons (one troop)\n|53\n|-\n|12th Light Dragoons\n|474\n|-\n|26th Light Dragoons\n|369\n|-\n|Hompesch Hussars\n|138\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Artillery\n|-\n|rowspan=8|Brigadier-General Robert Lawson\n|13th Artillery Company\n|rowspan=8|627\n|-\n|14th Artillery Company\n|-\n|26th Artillery Company\n|-\n|28th Artillery Company\n|-\n|55th Artillery Company\n|-\n|69th Artillery Company\n|-\n|70th Artillery Company\n|-\n|71st Artillery Company\n|}\nFrench\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=|Unit\n!style=|Number of men\n!style=|Ref.\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Cavalry\n|rowspan=32|\n|-\n|18th Dragoons\n|115\n|-\n|20th Dragoons\n|80\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Infantry\n|-\n|61st demi-brigade\n|680\n|-\n|75th demi-brigade\n|950\n|-\n|51st demi-brigade\n|210\n|}\nSee also\n* Battle of the Nile or Battle of Abukir Bay (1798)\n* Battle of Abukir (1799)\nCitations\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*.\nExternal links\n*\narz:معركة ابو قير البحريه"
