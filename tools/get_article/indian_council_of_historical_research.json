The body has provided financial assistance to historians and scholars through fellowships, grants, and symposia.\nThe ICHR receives grants-in-aid from the Department of Higher Education, grants-in-aid from various Indian states, private donations, and the proceeds of revenues from the sale of publications of the ICHR. The ICHR is based in Delhi, with regional centres in Pune (Maharashtra), Bengaluru (Karnataka), and Guwahati (Assam).\nIt was established on 27 March 1972.\nIts first chairman was the historian Ram Sharan Sharma. Historians who have served as members or functionaries of the ICHR include Irfan Habib, Tapan Raychaudhuri, and Barun De.\nObjectives\nThe objectives of the ICHR, as enunciated in the initial pamphlet published by the Department of Education, Government of India in 1972, are as under:\n* to bring historians together and provide a forum for the exchange of views between them;\n* to give a national direction to objective and scientific writing of history and to have rational presentation and interpretation of history;\n* to promote, accelerate and coordinate research in history with special emphasis on areas that have not received adequate attention so far;\n* to promote and coordinate a balanced distribution of research effort over different areas; and\n* to elicit support and recognition for historical research from all concerned and ensure the necessary dissemination and use of results.\nFunding, expenses and salaries\nICHR is funded by grants-in-aid received from the Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education . It also receives funds from the various state governments of India and from other Ministries of the government of India.\nOrganization\nThe ICHR is headed by an Honorary Chairman. The Member Secretary functions as the Secretary of the Governing Council during its General Body and special meetings and as the day-to-day Head of the Department in ICHR.\nThe Members of the Council of ICHR (Governing Body) are nominated for a period of three years. The Chairman of the Council of ICHR is nominated by the Department of Education in an honorary capacity and his term is not co-terminus with that of the members of the Constituted Council. The day-to-day functioning of the ICHR is looked after by the Director who acts as  ex officio Member Secretary of the Council. In 1991, a trend was started to have a separate post of Member Secretary of the ICHR, with Professor MGS Narayanan being selected as the First Member Secretary of ICHR. The institution has been continually embroiled in intra-rivalries between the Chairmen, Member Secretaries, and the Directors, at the cost of historical research. The main reason, as per many, has been the deputing of persons from here and there as the Member Secretaries and the undermining the office of the Chairman and the Director of the institution.\nChairmen\n* R.S.
