However, in the end, although there was a clear victor after the wars were ended by the victories of the Vaghela king Sarangadeva,Asoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956), pp. 181–182. both domains were eventually swallowed by the rising Delhi Sultanate.name=\"auto\">Dasharatha Sharma, Early Chauhān Dynasties: A Study of Chauhān Political History, Chauhān Political Institutions, and Life in the Chauhān Dominions, from 800 to 1316 A.D. (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1956), p. 96.\nPrelude\nBy the mid-12th century, the Chaulukyas under illustrious rulers such as Karna I and Jayasimha Siddharaja had increased in strength, and then eventually grew to its height of power during the reign of Kumarapala. The latter ruled from 1143 to 1172 AD, and during his reign, Gujarat saw a level of stability and prosperity. He was a patron of religious scholars (especially Jain scholars), arts, and temple building; inscriptions show his control extending over feudatories and neighbouring lands.\nKumarapala also conducted expansionist campaigns against his neighbors. An example of such was against the Paramaras of Malwa. During his reign, his Abu feudatory, Yashodhavala defeated and killed the usurper-king of the Paramaras, Ballala.Majumdar, Asoke Kumar. Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century. Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956.\nAfter Kumarapala’s death, Chaulukya power weakened. Feudatories and local chiefs started acting more independently. The most prominent of these former feudatories was Vindhyavarman of Malwa, who reestablished Paramara rule in Malwa, recovering their capital Dhara and restoring their sovereignty after the period of Chaulukya dominance. This set the stage for renewed conflict.\nKumarapala was succeeded Ajayapala, who was able to maintain the vast domains of the Chaulukyas. However, after his death, the decline of the dynasty became irreversible. During the reigns of rulers Mularaja II and Bhima II, the dynasty neared its demise.\nWhile politics in the hegemonic power of Gujarat continued, a new dynasty was arrising. Kumarapala rewarded one of his generals, Arnoraja with a minor fief centred in Bhimapalli village, which was likely the future core village of the arrising dynasty, Vyaghrapalli.\nDuring the reign of Bhima II of Gujarat, a period of crisis was occuring. Bhima and his feudatories Dharavarsha and Jayatasimha had been defeated by Qutb ud-Din Aibak at Kasahrada in 1197. Due to this, Ghurid raids on Gujarat became a common occurance, at one point reaching and sacking Anahilavada\nSubhatavarman's Invasion of Gujarat\n*Indecisive Territorial Change\n**Paramaras successfully capture the Lata region.\n**Sack of Anahilavada\n**Paramara attack on Somnath prevented\n**Paramaras driven out of the capital and driven to pre-war borders beyond the Lata region.\n}}\n| combatant1        =  Chaulukya dynasty Vaghela dynasty\n| combatant2        =  Paramara dynasty\n| commander1        =  Bhima II Shridhara Lavanaprasada\n| commander2        =  Subhatavarman\n| strength2         =\n| casualties1       = Disasterous\n| casualties2       = Medium to High\n| conflict          = Subhatavarman's Invasion of Gujarat\n}}\nThe son of Vindhyavarman, Subhatavarman (also known as Sohada) ascended to the Paramara throne in c. 1194 CE. Soon after his ascension, he launched a relatively successful campaign against the Chaulukyas.\nTaking advantage of the incredibly unstable condition of the Chaulukya domain, Subhatavarman successfully invaded the Lata region around 1204 CE. He also probably sacked the Chaulukya capital, Anahilavada.\nThe 14th century writer Merutunga claims that the Paramara king retreated from the Gujarat border after Bhima's minister recited a verse warning him of reprisals. But this is not supported by historical evidence. According to the Gujarat chronicles, Subhatavarman occupied Darbhavati (present-day Dabhoi) for some time. Muhammad Aufi, in his Jawami ul-Hikayat, states that the Paramara king plundered cities of Gujarat; Hindu temples as well as places of worship of other religious communities were affected. Subhatavarman is believed to have destroyed a mosque in Khambat, built for the Arab traders. According to the poet Arisimha, he also removed the gold pitchers from the Vaidyanatha temple of Darbhavati.\nHowever, after repeated defeats, the Chaulukyas were able to rebound. The Chaulukya general Shridhara was able to repulse Subhatavarman's attack. His Devapattana prashasti inscription suggests that he successfully defended his fort (near Somnath) against a Paramara siege. The son of Chaulukya general Arnoraja, Lavanaprasada probably forced Subhatavarman to abandon his campaign. His Dabhoi prashasti inscription, composed by the poet Someshvara, states that he was like a \"repository of medicine against the disease-resembling invaders\", which included the ruler of Dhara (the Paramara capital). Another poet Balachandra names Lavanaprasada's adversary as Sribhata of Malwa, who has been identified as Subhatavarman.\nFirst Interregnum\nAfter Lavanaprasada drove Subhatavarman out of Gujarat, an interregnum period began within the series of conflicts between the Chaulukya-Vaghelas and Paramara dynasty.\nHowever, this did not mean that either side was in a state of peace. In Gujarat, Bhima II was usurped by a dynast of unknown origin, Jayantasimha. The latter was able to gain control of the Chaulukya capital, Anahilavada for a short period.\nMeanwhile, the Paramaras were raided by the Yadavas while Subhatavarman was invading Gujarat, but the raid was small in scale and did not cause heavy damage.\nArjunavarman I's Invasion of Gujarat\n*Paramaras defeat Chaulukya forces in successive battles\n**Annexation of Pavagadh and Bharuch by Arjunavarman\n**Capture of Jayantasimha's daughter, Jayashri, by Paramara forces.\n*Peace forged between both sides via a marriage alliance.\n}}\n| combatant1        =  Chaulukya dynasty Vaghela dynasty\n| combatant2        =  Paramara dynasty\n| commander1        =  Jayantasimha Bhima II Lavanaprasada\n| commander2        =  Arjunavarman I\n| strength2         =\n| casualties1       = Disasterous\n| casualties2       = Low\n| conflict          = Arjunavarman I's invasion of Gujarat\n}}\nSubhatavarman was succeeded by his son, Arjunavarman I circa 1210 CE. Arjunavarman, like his father, was able to lead a successful campaign in Gujarat. However, unlike his paternal predeccessor, he would not face defeat a single time in his campaign in the region.\nDue to the great success he saw during his campaign in Gujarat, the 14th century writer Merutunga calls him the \"destroyer of Gujarat\". Arjunavarman was able to continously best the usurper, Jayantasimha in battle with consistency. The 1211 Piplianagar grant of Arjuna refers to his victory over Jayanta, so Arjunavarman's Gujarat invasion must have happened before this time. An inscription from Bhopal indicates that he had reached Bharuch by 1213. The Dhar prashasti inscription states that he defeated Jayasimha in the Parva mountain valley (possibly Pavagadh). It also states that Arjuna captured Jayanta's daughter Jayashri, and fell in love with her. According to Asoke Majumdar, this suggests that Jayanta made peace with the Paramaras through a marriage alliance.\nSecond Interregnum\nAfter Arjunavarman's successful invasion of Gujarat, a second period of no conflict between both sides took place.\nJust like the first interregnum, the second interregnum was an unstable period for both sides. For the Chaulukyas, it was the beginning of the end. Three feudatories- Udayasimha, Somasimha and Dharavarsha simultaneously revolted in unison against the Chaulukyas after seeing opportunity during the Yadava invasion of Chaulukyas.\nThe Lata (southern Gujarat) region was repeatedly attacked by the Paramaras and the Yadavas of Devagiri during Bhima's reign. It came under the control of a chief named Simha, who was initially allied to the Paramaras. A 1200 CE inscription of the Yadava king Jaitugi states that he defeated the Gurjaras, which probably refers to his invasion of Lata. The Paramaras abandoned Simha during the Yadava invasion, so he turned to the Chaulukyas for help. During his 1213 CE invasion, the Paramara king Arjunavarman may have replaced Simha with the latter's nephew Shankha (alias Sangrama-Simha). Shankha repulsed a Yadava invasion of the region.\nJaitugi's son Simhana invaded Gujarat multiple times. In an inscription, his general Kholeshvara claims to have humbled the pride of the Gurjaras. The first invasion of Simhana probably took place around 1229 CE. According to the Chaulukya accounts, Lavanaprasada concluded a peace treaty with Simhana, because he needed to visit Marwar to quell a rebellion. It appears that Lavanaprasada sent an army under his son Viradhavala to raid the Yadava territory, because of which Simhana was forced to agree to a peace treaty.\nAfter Lavanaprasada departed to Marwar, Shankha attacked Khambhat, but was defeated by the Chaulukya general Vastupala. Shankha then tried to instigate Simhana to launch a fresh attack on Gujarat. According to the Chaulukya accounts, the Chaulukya spies created a rift between Shankha and Simhana. Shankha ultimately submitted to the Chaulukya general Viradhavala.\nThe Chaulukyas were in control of the Lata region by 1231–1232 CE, when it was being governed by Lavanaprasada's grandson, Viśaladeva. Around 1237 CE, Simhana sent another army under Kholeshvara's son Rama to attack Gujarat. Visaladeva repulsed this attack, and Rama was killed in a battle fought on the banks of the Narmada River.\nAccording to the medieval text Jagadu-Charita, Pithadeva of Para invaded the Kutch region during Bhima's reign. A merchant named Jagadu sought help from Lavanaprasada, who dispatched an army that defeated Pithadeva. The identity of Pithadeva is not certain, but he was probably a Soomra ruler of Nagarparkar, who is variously called Pithu, Pahtu or Phatu by the Muslim chroniclers.\nMeanwhile, the Paramaras saw the first cracks in their invincibility that had presented itself as a product of the reigns of three powerful kings- Vindhyavarman, Subhatavarman and Arjunavarman I.\nAlthough Arjunavarman was able to greatly grow Paramara prestiege and influence, the late parts of his reign saw numerous setbacks against the Yadava ruler Simhana at the end of his reign. When the Yadava ruler Simhana invaded Lata (southern Gujarat), Arjuna's Chahamana general Salakhanasimha defeated him. Later, the Yadava king sent another force led by his general Kholeshvara to Lata. This second invasion resulted in the Paramara feudatory's defeat.\nArjunavarman married the Hoysala princess Sarvakala, who was probably a daughter or granddaughter of the Hoysala king Ballala. Simhana's invasion of the Hoysala territory appears to have led to a fresh conflict between the Paramaras and the Yadavas. Simhana invaded the Paramara kingdom in 1215, and according to the later Yadava court poet Hemadri, this invasion resulted in the defeat and death of Arjunavarman. The veracity of Hemadri's claim is doubtful, as the 1222 Bahal inscription mentions Arjunavarman's defeat, but not his death. The Tiluvalli inscription also states that Simhana humbled the lord of Malwa.\nArjunavarman was succeeded by Devapala. During Devapala's reign, the Paramaras seem to have saw no direct conflict with the Chaulukyas or Vaghelas. However, According to a few poetic legends, Shankha, the ruler of Lata convinced Simhana and Devapala to send a joint expedition to Gujarat. Simhana's force was led by Kholeshvara, and Shankha himself led one of the invading armies. Lavanaprasada resolved the threat by creating a rift between the invading allies. One of his spies stole Devapala's favourite horse, and another spy gave it to Shankha claiming that it was a gift from Devapala. Meanwhile, a forged letter was made to fall in Simhana's hands: in this letter, Devapala had purportedly assured Shankha that he would attack Simhana's army in Gujarat, and had also urged him to kill Simhana to avenge his father's death. This letter convinced Simhana that Shankha and Devapala were conspiring against him.\nBhima II was succeeded by Tribhuvanapala. Although the latter's relation to the former is unknown, it is generally considered that he was a legitamate successor of the former.\nThe Chaulukya dynasty ended with Tribhuvanapala. The Vaghela generals Lavanaprasada and Viradhavala had become powerful during Bhima II's reign and went so far as to have sovereign titles. Viradhavala's son, Viśala-deva succeeded him as King of the Vaghelas. Then, he became king of Gujarat after Tribhuvanapala's death. One theory is that the Vaghelas forcibly dethroned Tribhuvanapala. However, it is also possible that Tribhuvanapala died heirless, because of which the Vaghelas assumed the control of the kingdom peacefully.\nViśala-deva's Sack of Dhara\n*Vaghela dominance secured\n**Sack of Dhara by the Vaghelas\n**Paramaras forced to pay tribute to the Vaghelas.\n}}\n| combatant1       =  Vaghela dynasty\n| combatant2        =  Paramara dynasty\n| commander1        =  Viśala-deva Vastupala\n| commander2        =  Jaitugi-deva\n| strength2         =\n| casualties1       = Low\n| casualties2       = Devestating\n| conflict          = Fall of Dhara\n}}\nAfter Viśala-deva became the Sovereign monarch of Gujarat, he made the Vaghelas the ruling dynasty of the region. His reign would see a high intensity of campaigns that revived the Kingdom of Gujarat from its past decline.\nMeanwhile, the Paramaras saw a large amount of change. Devapala was succeeded by Jaitugi-deva, a weak ruler whose authority was limited by internal factionalism and external pressure from neighboring powers.\nDuring Jaitugi-deva's reign, the Paramaras suffered setbacks against the Vaghelas and Yadavas. According to Vaghela inscriptions, Viśala-deva personally led campaigns into Malwa and defeated the Paramaras in a conflict where he was able to sack their capital, Dhara and coerce them into paying tribute.\nThis military success allowed Viśala-deva to secure his dominance over both Gujarat and Malwa, projecting Vaghela power deep into central India and solidifying their position as the preeminent regional dynasty.\nThird Interregnum\nLike all previous interregnums, the third interregnum saw a period of uneasy peace between both sides and instability in both. In Gujarat, the Vaghelas saw numerous other successes in the beginning of Viśala-deva's reign. He defeated Tejasimha of the Guhilas in Mewar and was able to repel early Yadava invasions. However, his defeat at the hands of Mahadeva of Devagiri saw his death and the significant weakening of the Vaghela domain.\nMeanwhile, the Paramaras were beginning to see their final resurgence before their ultimate decline. Jaitugi-deva, the weak Paramara king was succeeded by Jayavarman II. Jayavarman, in comparison to Jaitugi-deva, was a potent and powerful ruler. During his reign, he was able to expand his domain in nearly all directions.\nDespite pressures from the Delhi Sultanate under Balban, he was largely victorious in his wars. He defeated the Chandelas and captured Rahatgarh, expanded his domain to the north, and was able to defeat a Yadava invasion led by Mahadeva and even lead a successful counteroffensive that would see the Paramaras reconquer the Narmada-Tapi Doab after loosing it centuries ago.\nViśala-deva was succeeded by his son, Arjuna-deva. Although he suffered defeats at the hands of the Yadavas, the Vaghelas saw no territorial decline during his reign. Arjuna-deva was succeeded by his elder son, Rama. However, Rama reigned for a very short period, likely less than a year. At the end of the third interregnum, he was succeeded by Sarangadeva, who is regarded to be the most potent of all Vaghela rulers to have ever ruled over Gujarat.\nRegardless, the third interregnum was likely the last period where the Paramaras had a greater level of power than the Vaghelas before their final decline.\nSarangadeva's invasions of Malwa\n* Sarangadeva achieves repeated victories over the Paramaras\n** Final decline of the Paramaras after their last resurgence during the reign of Jayavarman II\n** Peak of Vaghela ascendancy after the recovery of lands losts during Chaulukya rule, such as Bharuch and Pavagadh\n** End of the Vaghela-Paramara wars\n}}\n| combatant1          =  Vaghela dynasty\n| combatant2        =  Paramara dynasty\n| commander1        =  Sarangadeva\n| commander2        =  Arjunavarman II Goga deva Bhoja II Mahalakadeva\n| strength2         =\n| casualties1       = Low\n| casualties2       = Extremely High\n| conflict          = Saranagadeva's invasions of Malwa\n}}\nSarangadeva, after ascending to the Vaghela throne, initiated a series of campaigns that brought his dynastic domain to its territorial zenith. These campaigns were marked by both military aggression and strategic diplomacy, aimed at consolidating Vaghela authority over Gujarat and extending influence into neighbouring regions. Among these campaigns, his invasions of Malwa were particularly notable, as he managed to defeat the Paramaras, asserting Vaghela dominance in central India.Asoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956), pp. 181–182. These expeditions were intended to weaken Paramara hold over Malwa, preventing them from challenging Vaghela authority in the future.\nSarangadeva's campaigns against the Paramaras represented the most severe Vaghela intrusion into Malwa in the dynasty's history. Over the course of two decades, he systematically defeated three consecutive Paramara rulers: Arjunavarman II, Bhoja II, and Mahalakadeva. He also overcame the powerful Paramara prime minister, Goga deva, who had emerged as the de facto ruler of Malwa after instigating a civil war against Arjunavarman II and controlling the last two Paramara kings from behind the throne. These victories not only expanded the Vaghela sphere of influence but also destabilized the Paramaras politically, making them increasingly dependent on external powers and reducing their ability to resist later incursions, including the eventual Delhite conquest of Malwa.\nThrough these military campaigns, Sarangadeva effectively nullified the the threat the Paramaras posed to the Vaghelas and secured the northern and eastern frontiers of the Vaghela kingdom. His victories allowed the Vaghelas to consolidate control over strategically important towns and fortresses and secure trade routes, thereby strengthening both the political and economic foundations of the Vaghela dynasty.\nHence, Sarangadeva was able to single-handedly end the Vaghela-Paramara wars, leaving a lasting legacy of military and political supremacy. His reign marked not only the territorial peak of the Vaghela dynasty but also a period in which the power of the Paramaras was irreversibly curtailed, establishing a period of relative stability and dominance for the Vaghelas in western and central India that lasted until the challenges posed by the early Delhi Sultanate.Asoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat, pp. 182–183.\nAftermath\nAfter his victories over the Paramaras, Sarangadeva continued his military successes against his neighbors. He was able to defeat the YadavasAsoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956), pp. 181–182. under Ramachandra and repel a Turuksha Turkic invasion. This invasion has been identified to either be a Mongol intrusion into Gujarat, or an attack by the forces of the sultan of Delhi, Balban.Asoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956), p. 183.\nPrior to the Turkic invasion, he helped the ruler of Abu, Pratapasimha recover his domains from the Guhila ruler Samarasimha. He also sent an expedition against the Jethva chief Bhanu.Asoke Kumar Majumdar, Chaulukyas of Gujarat: A Survey of the History and Culture of Gujarat from the Middle of the Tenth to the End of the Thirteenth Century (Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1956), p. 184.\nHis final prominent campaign was against the Khalji ruler of Delhi, Jalal-ud-din Khalji. During this period, Jalal-ud-din invaded the Chahamana kingdom under Samantasimha. However, Sarangadeva was able to successfully liberate the Chahamana ruler from the attack of the Khalji sultan by marching against the Delhite army and forcing Jalal-ud-din to retreat.Ashok Kumar Srivastava, The Chahamanas of Jalor (Gorakhpur: Sahitya Sansar Prakashan, 1979), p. 36.Dasharatha Sharma, Early Chauhān Dynasties: A Study of Chauhān Political History, Chauhān Political Institutions, and Life in the Chauhān Dominions from C. 800 to 1316 A.D. (Delhi: S. Chand, 1959), p. 159.\nMeanwhile, the Paramara dynasty under Mahalakadeva saw its final demise.\nIn 1305, the Sultan of Delhi, Alauddin Khalji, sent his army to conquer Malwa, which was ruled by the Paramaras. According to Amir Khusrow’s Tarikh-i ‘Alai, “Rai Mahlak Deo” and pradhan “Koka” (Goga deva) commanded a force of 30–40 thousand cavalry, and an infantry of unknown size. Khusrow states that Delhi’s “army of Islam” defeated this Paramara force, and “the earth was moistened with Hindu blood”. Goga was killed in the battle, and his head was sent to the Sultan in Delhi.\nAyn al-Mulk Multani, the newly appointed Governor of Malwa, was sent to expel Mahalakadeva from Mandu and cleanse that place from “the odour of infidelity”. With help of a spy, Multani’s forces found a way to enter the fort secretly. Mahalakadeva was killed while attempting to flee, on 24 November 1305. The Jain writer Kakka Suri, in his Nabhi-nandana-jinoddhara-prabandha (1336), describes the end of Mahalakadeva as follows: “Besieged by him [Alauddin] in his own fort, the ruler of Mālwā passed there many days, living like a captive, and then died bereft of heroism.”\nIt is not known exactly when the Delhi forces completed their conquest of Malwa. A 1310 CE Udaipur inscription indicates that the Paramara dynasty survived until this time, at least in the north-eastern part of Malwa. A later 1338 CE inscription on a new mosque indicates that the area was under the control of the Delhi Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq by that time.\nAlthough the Vaghelas had significantly grown in power, they, like the Paramaras, were eventually swallowed by the Delhi Sultanate. Sarangadeva's successor, Karandeva was defeated by Ulugh Khan, a general of Alauddin Khalji. Although Karna was able to briefly recover his domains from the Sultanate, his second and final defeat saw the complete end of Vaghela rule over Gujarat.name=\"auto\">Dasharatha Sharma, Early Chauhān Dynasties: A Study of Chauhān Political History, Chauhān Political Institutions, and Life in the Chauhān Dominions, from 800 to 1316 A.D.
