He was a first-class passenger and died when the ship sank.\nBiography\nMr. George Edward Graham was born on February, 1883, in Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nHe was the son of William Henry Graham (b. February 1837; d. 1921), a farmer, and Margaret White (b. circa 1838; d. 1906), who were married in September 1859. His father was born in Québec to Scottish immigrant parents, and his mother was born in Co Tyrone, Ireland, before immigrating with her family to Ontario, Canada in her youth.\nOne of ten children, George was brother to: twins Mary Ann “Minnie” (1860-1957) and John David (1860-1932), William Henry (1863-1954), Humphrey Albert (1865-1947), Robert Samuel (1867-1949), James White (1869-1929), Agnes Mabel (1871-1964)[2], Charles Sinclair (1876-1904) and Ellen Jane (1877-1881).\nGraham went to work as a clerk at a hardware store at age 17; a salesman in Galt, then Toronto in 1903, with the Canadian department store chain Eaton’s.\nGeorge was married in Harriston, Ontario, on 19 September 1906 to Edith May Jackson (b. 24 January 1878), daughter of John Jackson and the former Minnie Davis.\nGraham was transferred to Winnipeg as the head of Eaton's crockery and fine china division. George and Edith welcomed their only child, a son named John Humphrey, who was born on 11 October 1908.\nThe couple appear on the 1911 Canadian census as residents of 31 Dundurn Place, Winnipeg; tragically, their son John died in Ontario on 22 January 1911 from pneumonia and heart failure. He was buried in St Mary’s Cemetery in Perth, Ontario.\nGraham boarded the Titanic at Southampton as a first-class passenger (ticket number 112053, £30) occupying cabin B-42. Travelling as a salesman, he dined with others of the same profession, and he and his tablemates signed a menu as a souvenir, which survived the sinking in the pocket of John Irwin Flynn. The other signatories were Spencer Victor Silverthorne, Edward Pennington Calderhead, James Robert McGough, as well as John Irwin Flynn, all the others of whom later survived the sinking.\nReferences\n:Category:1883 births\n:Category:1912 deaths\n:Category:Deaths on the RMS Titanic\n:Category:People from Winnipeg\nReferences\nhttps://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/george-edmond-graham.html"
