The band consisted of members Joel Kanitz, Ryan Gose, Alex Silverman, and Sean Silverman. In February 2014, Alex Silverman announced his departure from the group. In May 2015, the band announced that following the release of their third album Soul Sucker, they would be playing farewell shows and retiring the band so members could \"pursue each of our passions and musical projects\".\nThe band has released three full-length albums: Soul Sucker, Biography of Heartbreak, and Sound of Fire.\nHistory\nBeginnings (2006–2007)\nThe band was formed while most of the members were attending high school. They experimented with several names such as \"Modern Poets\", and kept this name for two shows before changing it to \"Evident Earth\". They finally decided on \"This Century\" after guitarist Silverman jokingly said they're \"lucky if we come up with a band name some time this century\".\nEarly EPs (2007–2009)\nIn 2007 This Century released their first EP titled 2007. They continued releasing EPs and singles throughout the years, including Look What We Made (2008), \"Dream of Christmas\" (2008), \"Kiss Me Like It's Christmas\" (2009), No Way Out Digital Sampler (2009), and To Love and Back (2009). In 2008, they were signed under Tim Kirch and Tanner Radcliffe at 8123 Management, and later performed acoustic sets at the Baby Cakes Tent during the 2009 Vans Warped Tour.\nTours and Sound of Fire (2010–2012)\nIn 2010 This Century was signed to The Maine's Action Theory Records. They then released the EP Hopeful Romantic Sampler (2010), consisting of three sampler tracks, the first of which was due to be on their debut album Sound of Fire. They performed at Bamboozle Left with bands such as Anarbor, The Ready Set, Never Shout Never, and The Summer Set. They also embarked on a nationwide tour with label mates The Maine and special guest Austin Gibbs on an \"Evening With The Maine Tour\".\nWhile on the 'Hey Monday Tour' in late 2010 the band was forced to cancel their last few shows due to lead singer Joel Kanitz having vocal issues.\nThey have also toured with Good Charlotte and Forever the Sickest Kids on the 'Cardiology Tour'.
