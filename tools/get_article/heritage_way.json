      "text": "# Heritage Way\n\nHeritage Way is the fourth album from Texas singer-songwriter Phil Pritchett. The album is noted for having a more personal introspective feel to it, having Pritchett playing most of the instruments and writing all of the songs. It is comparatively more acoustic-folk based than most of Pritchett's more rock-country based albums.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks written by Phil Pritchett.\n# \"Summertime\"– 5:09\n# \"Nowhere\" – 3:10\n# \"Julianne Part II\"– 3:32\n# \"Song For Keeps\" – 4:00\n# \"Life of Paul\" – 2:39\n# \"Guardian Angel\" – 3:04\n# \"Beautiful Day\" – 5:12\n# \"Feeling Port Aransas\"– 3:34\n# \"Stumbling Free\" – 3:28\n# \"Long Way Gone\" – 3:21\nExternal links\n* [http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=77763 Austin Chronicle Review]\n* [http://www.lonestarmusic.com/album.asp?aid=242 The Album on Lonestarmusic.com]"
