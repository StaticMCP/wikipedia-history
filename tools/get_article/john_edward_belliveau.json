Belliveau's articles were published in various newspapers in Canada such as the Moncton Transcript, the Windsor Star, the Toronto Star, and the Star Weekly.\nLife and career\nBelliveau was born in 1913 in Moncton, New Brunswick, and began his career in journalism in the 1930s with the Moncton Transcript. He got married in 1940, and after having their first child his wife left her employment with the local lumber company. Belliveau subsequently began looking to grow his career in journalism, and was hired as a reporter with the Windsor Star in 1941. His family then moved from New Brunswick to Windsor, Ontario. In 1942, Belliveau became the Chatham bureau chief at The Star, and then moved his family to Chatham. He later began working as a columnist for the Toronto Star, where he spent a total of 16 years.\nBelliveau was among the journalists who covered the murder trial of Wilbert Coffin, known as the \"Coffin affair\", while working as a reporter for the Toronto Star. Belliveau released his first book in 1956 titled The Coffin Murder Case, and would go on to testify at the Quebec royal commission which inquired into the hanging of Coffin. The royal commission heard that less than two hours after the death of Coffin, his last will and testament was sold to the Toronto Star by one of Coffin's lawyers in a deal brokered by Belliveau. The Toronto Star published the will in full on 10 February 1956, and the will was included in The Coffin Murder Case later that year.\nBelliveau became involved in politics in 1958, when he joined the campaign of John Wintermeyer; he then served as acting director of the Liberal Party of Ontario. In 1960, Belliveau became the vice-president of public affairs at Tandy Advertising in Toronto. During his time at Tandy Advertising, Belliveau managed the successful election campaign of Louis Robichaud in New Brunswick. He further advised other Canadian politicians on their election campaigns, such as Alex Campbell, the 23rd premier of Prince Edward Island; and Gerald Regan, the 19th premier of Nova Scotia. In 1963, Belliveau worked as a campaign advisor and speech writer for Lester B. Pearson, the 14th prime minister of Canada, after having done work for Pearson the year prior.\nBelliveau published several other books throughout his career, such as The Splendid Life of Albert Smith and the Women he Left Behind (1976), concerning the life of the New Brunswick politician Albert James Smith; and Running Far In: The Story of Shediac (1977), a history of the town of Shediac, New Brunswick. In addition to his published literature, Belliveau compiled genealogical resources on the Belliveau and Sumner families as well as a written history of the Moncton Club. Belliveau's final published book, Iceboats to Superferries: An Illustrated History of Marine Atlantic (1992), was written alongside Silver Donald Cameron and Michael Harrington and covers the history of Marine Atlantic and ferry services in the Maritimes.\nBelliveau died in Moncton on 26 March 1998, at the age of 84.\nPersonal life\nBelliveau married his wife, Gertrude Adell Belliveau (née Pujolas), in 1940 at St. Bernard's Church in Moncton, New Brunswick. Belliveau and his wife had five sons; including Bill Belliveau, founder of the magazine Atlantic Insight.\nPublications\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nSelected articles\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\n*  |access-date=27 May 2025 |via=Newspapers.com}}\n*\n*  |access-date=27 May 2025 |via=Newspapers.com}}\n*  |page=315 |doi= |access-date=}}\n*\n*\n*  |access-date=27 May 2025 |via=Newspapers.com}}\n*\n*  |access-date=27 May 2025 |via=Newspapers.com}}\n*\n*  |access-date=27 May 2025 |via=Newspapers.com}}\n*\n*\n*  |access-date=27 May 2025 |via=Newspapers.com}}\n*\n*  |access-date=27 May 2025 |via=Legacy.com}}\n*  |access-date=27 May 2025 |via=Newspapers.com}}\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*"
