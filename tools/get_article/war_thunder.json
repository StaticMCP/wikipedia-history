It was first released in November 2012 as an open beta with a worldwide release in January 2013; it had its official release on December 21, 2016. A spinoff game called War Thunder Mobile (also known as War Thunder Edge) was released in 2023 for Android and iOS.\nDeveloped as a \"flying simulation game\", it was previously named War Thunder: World of Planes, but due to its similarity with Wargaming's World of Warplanes, it was changed to its present name in 2012. Initially, Gaijin claimed after the game was announced that it was an April Fools joke before confirming its existence in June that same year.\nWar Thunder won several awards following its release, winning Best Simulation Game at the Gamescom 2013 Awards as well as winning Best Game, Best Developer, Best Technology and Best Sound at the KRI 2013 Awards. In 2019, War Thunder was among the most played games on Steam with over 25,000 concurrent players. As of November 1, 2022, War Thunder had over 70 million registered players on all platforms combined, out of which 160,000 play concurrently. In February 2024, War Thunder set a new record of over 250,000 concurrent players.\nGameplay\nWar Thunder is based around combined arms battles on air, land, and sea. Vehicles range from pre-World War I (ships only) to the modern day, as well as tanks that are not technically in service yet. with an emphasis on World War II, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. Players can control aircraft, ground vehicles, and warships from nations with a set of technology trees attached to them. The game also incorporates other nations. These nations are included either as \"sub-trees\" (parts of the research trees of bigger nations being dedicated to a smaller nation) or premium vehicles, purchasable with real money or in-game currency.\nVehicles are divided into three main categories: aviation, ground, and fleet, while game modes are divided between arcade, realistic, and simulator. Aviation is divided between regular aircraft and helicopters, fleet is divided between \"Bluewater\", ships from the size of destroyers to battlecruisers and battleships and \"Coastal\", smaller ships and boats such as motor torpedo boats, motor gunboats, submarine chasers, and frigates. A single-player mode that focuses on historical battles, and a co-op wave survival mode for battling AI ground vehicles and aircraft, are also available.\nIn War Thunder, the player takes control of a vehicle, depending on the type of battle. That player is in full control of their vehicle until it is destroyed by the enemy team. The objective of most battles is to accumulate points, either by destroying enemy vehicles or capturing strategic positions on the map.\nEvents\nEvents in War Thunder provide custom missions, usually based on one of the three main game modes, but with alternative settings regarding allowed vehicles, mission specifics, etc. Examples are the recreation of historical battles by restricting available vehicles (e.g., Battle of Britain).\nTraditionally, the developers prepare unconventional events for April Fools' Day. These events are used to test planned game mechanics before their broader release to the player base.\n* For 2015, a new game mode called \"Unrealistic Battles\" featured inflatable rubber tanks firing potatoes and carrots. The \"tanks\" also had overall hitpoints instead of the usual separate modules, parodying the gameplay of World of Tanks, a competitor to War Thunder.\n* For 2016, ahead of the announcement of the naval forces update, War Thunder offered playable 18th-century sailing ships fighting in the Caribbean.\n* For 2017, War Thunder made playable rank IX main battle tanks and attack helicopters. Available vehicles were the Leopard 2A5, AH-64 Apache (Designated as GM-64 and operated by Germany in-game), Gepard, T-90A, Mi-35 Hind-E and ZSU-23-4 Shilka.\n* The 2018 event, named \"Silent Thunder\", was based underwater in an Arctic Ocean map, with three playable nuclear submarines: the Vanguard-class, Virginia-class, and Yasen-class.\n* The 2019 event, named \"Earth Thunder\", took place in a fictional American city named \"Green Hills\" and had players use UFOs.\n* In 2020, Gaijin changed the name of the game to \"Space Thunder\", featuring space battles.\n* In 2021, Gaijin held 2 events, \"Tailspin\" and \"Warfare 2077\". Tailspin was a game mode that took place on a map called \"Cape Somerset Bay\" that had a cartoon art style with aircraft directly inspired by the show TaleSpin; one aircraft was also inspired by Studio Ghibli's Porco Rosso. Players took control of new planes belonging to the \"Republic of Air Pirates\" faction. Warfare 2077 was a futuristic game mode that took place on the \"Launch Facility\" map and allowed the players to take control of futuristic tanks and unmanned aerial vehicles, teasing the September 2022 addition of drones to the game. Its advertising and name were similar to the (at the time) recently released Cyberpunk 2077.\n* In 2022, Gaijin introduced a Dune-inspired game mode called \"Worm Thunder: Children of Arachis\" which involved two factions fighting over cinnamon in the desert while also avoiding being eaten by a giant sandworm.\n* In 2023, Gaijin introduced \"Mobile Infantry\", an event involving battles involving infantry wearing combat exoskeletons, main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and attack helicopters. Two nations were playable in the conflict, being the United States and Russia. The event was the first time fire-and-forget ATGMs were featured in the game, as the ATGM operator for the US side was fitted with Spike missiles.\n* In 2024, Gaijin introduced \"Mad Max\" style vehicles partially based on Gaijin's other game Crossout. The event was called \"Mad Thunder\". \"Mad Thunder\" gameplay included \"you can find ancient electronics, scrap metal, vehicle parts and armor parts, which are all needed to improve your combat vehicles and to craft new ones.\"\n* In 2025, Gaijin introduced World War One vehicles and aircraft with two playable sides: the Triple Entente and the Central Powers. They also added a map and obtainable World War One vehicles that could be used after the event. The event was a precursor to their next game Aces of Thunder.\nOther notable examples include \"March to Victory\", introducing playable mecha composed of tank parts; \"The Pony Nation\", introducing the world of My Little Pony, Equestria, as a sixth playable faction (2013); \"Gaijilla\", featuring a battle against a giant Godzilla-like snail (2014); and Atomic Thunder, featuring vehicles from the video game Atomic Heart (July 2023).\nIn August 2020, the game had a tank biathlon-style event featuring select Russian and Chinese tanks performing tasks on a tank range map, with the objective to finish in 1st place after navigating obstacles and destroying targets. The event was partnered with the Information Systems Department of the Russian Ministry of Defense. Logos advertising the game also appeared during the event, notably painted on the side of the tanks during the real biathlon. The event was teased on August 17 with a YouTube video posted to the game's official YouTube Channel, as well as on the official website.\nHistory\nEarly development and closed beta\nThe development of the game, then under the name World of Planes, began in 2009. Gaijin Entertainment used its experience with its previous combat flight simulator games, such as IL-2 Sturmovik: Birds of Prey, Apache: Air Assault, and Birds of Steel, in the development. The title was changed to War Thunder during the closed beta due to confusion with competitor World of Warplanes.\nOpen beta and release\nOpen beta testing started on November 1, 2012 (for users from the Russian Federation; the global beta launched January 28, 2013) for Windows PC with about 200 aircraft and 600,000 players. On May 15, 2014, at 6 million registered players, the first ground forces for Germany and the Soviet Union were introduced. Later added were the American, British, and Japanese ground forces.\nIn 2017, Italy was added as a playable faction. At Gamescom 2018, the planned addition of helicopters into the game was announced, and by late 2018, helicopters were fully implemented.\nIn 2022, Tencent announced that the Chinese version of the game published by Tencent would be discontinued on October 17.\nAccusations of supporting a russian YouTube channel\nIn January 2021, after the logos of War Thunder were seen in a video by russian YouTube channel \"High Caliber Mayhem\", that operates on occupied territory of Ukraine, Gaijin was accused of indirectly financing russian militants in the war in Donbas. High Caliber Mayhem has denied any links to the russian armed forces and published an explanation claiming that all the money from all advertisements on that channel were spent on humanitarian aid for civilians. Contrary to this, creator of channel Aleksey Smirnov, published number of photos in area of fights with weapons in his hands, videos with bodies of killed ukrainian soldiers, and channel is supplied with weapons and permissions for its activity. The video showing the War Thunder advertisement was removed from High Caliber Mayhem's YouTube channel.\nIn response to the controversy, Gaijin stated \"We do not provide political support to anyone anywhere. We know nothing about politics and prefer to stay out of it. Our agency that ordered an ad in the video in question took it down when they realized they might drag us into a political discussion.\"\nReview bombing\nFollowing an in-game economic change in May 2023 which drastically reduced rewards given for battle actions and an increase in post-battle costs, a large amount of War Thunder players began revolting against the developers by review bombing the game on multiple platforms, such as Steam and Google. In response, Gaijin has since reverted the planned economic change, posted statements regarding the issue and player progression, announced a revision of the economy for mid-summer 2023 and issued an apology for the initial controversial changes.\nMilitary training tool\nIn 2020, Task & Purpose reported that the US 1st Cavalry Division tankers were using War Thunder for training during COVID-19 quarantine. After looking at several games including World of Tanks, the soldiers found that War Thunder best met their needs. In 2021, a video of Republic of Korea's 3rd Armored Brigade using War Thunder for the Command & Control training session was made public.\nIn January 2024, a Ukrainian M2 Bradley IFV gunner of the 47th Brigade, referred to only as Serhiy, took down a Russian T-90M main battle tank by shooting specific weak points in the tank's armor, claiming that videogames taught him exactly where to shoot. According to media, War Thunder is the only game that matches this description. Task & Purpose said: \"People know War Thunder for leaking classified documents, but now it might actually be known as the game that has the first confirmed kill.\"\nIn May 2025, a drone operator from New Zealand, referred to as Cass, destroyed a T-72 tank in a weak spot he knew from his game experience, as \"the modelling of tank armour\" in War Thunder \"is quite realistic\".\nSensitive document leaks\nOn several occasions, users of the War Thunder forum have shared restricted and/or classified documents during discussions about the accuracy of the vehicles depicted. In all cases, offending posts are removed by the moderators, and users are warned against sharing such documents. Anton Yudintsev, founder of Gaijin Entertainment, has stated that the development team is never exposed to the contents, reminding users that \"it's both illegal and pointless, so they should never do that\". Gaijin's policy regarding technical information is\nAlthough users disclose non-public information to win an argument or persuade Gaijin to make changes to War Thunder vehicles, doing so prevents the company from implementing such changes. In January 2023, Raytheon denied media reports that security clearance background checks for jobs at the defense contractor investigate whether applicants play War Thunder.\nGaijin often jokes about the phenomena. Notably in the \"No sekrit dokuments, please.\" decal which is a parody of the \"No!\" (Russian: \"Нет!\") poster, a 1954 Soviet anti-alcohol poster.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\" data-sort-type=\"date\" | Date\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Vehicle\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Restriction level\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Topic of interest\n! style=\"width:75%;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Description\n|-\n|July 14, 2021\n| Challenger 2 tank\n|Classified\n| In-game modelling\n| A forum member claiming to be a Challenger 2 tank commander posted images of classified documents pertaining to the tank on the official War Thunder forums.
