Despite the lack of reinforcements from the colonial governor, Gomes Barbosa, who refused to give support, Geraldes decided to press on. The region was tense, with the Umbucu rallying 800 auxiliaries to join 40 soldiers under Alferes Amaral Carvalho Vieira and 70 grumetes, forming a column of 910 men.\nMusa Molo was accidentally wounded, so his chiefs led his force, he anticipated the expedition and fortified a stronghold at Buaró, deep within the territory of Mansomine. The location was strategically chosen, and all régulos from the region coordinated their forces to repel the Portuguese column, there vigilant enemy scouts patrolled the terrain.\nBattle\nAfter setting camp at Cheuvel, Geraldes carefully planned his advance, avoiding paths prone to ambush. Guided by locals familiar with the terrain, the column approached Buaró undetected until they emerged from the jungle onto the plain where the fortified tabanca stood.\nThe battle began with a fierce exchange of fire as the Portuguese forces positioned their artillery on the column's left flank. An attempt to reposition the artillery closer to the enemy resulted in it being abandoned under heavy fire, with 5 grumetes severely wounded. Seizing the moment, the enemy cavalry launched an attack, forcing Geraldes to dispatch reinforcements to stabilize the line.\nReturning to the abandoned artillery, Geraldes and 4 soldiers managed to recover and reposition the piece. A well aimed shot from the artillery broke through the enemy defenses, killing six defenders. The remaining forces either fled or were cut down in close combat. After four hours of intense fighting, the tabanca fell.\nAftermath\nThe victory allowed Geraldes's forces to conduct a series of raids in the surrounding territory, destroying four tabancas over the next three days. The forces of Pata Jedé and Sambel Nhantá did not dare to offer resistance after the defeat at Buaró.\nReferences\n*\n*"
