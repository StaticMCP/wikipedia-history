      "text": "# National Anthem of the Ancient Britons\n\n\"National Anthem of the Ancient Britons\", also known as \"Woad\" or \"The Woad Ode\", is a humorous song, set to the tune of \"Men of Harlech\".  It first became popular in the 1920s as a song in the British Boy Scouts and appeared in The Hackney Scout Song Book (Stacy & Son Ltd, 1921). The author was William Hope-Jones, a housemaster at Eton, who wrote it some time before 1914, as he sang it at a college dinner at that time.  \"Ho&nbsp;Jo\" appears in M. R. James' 1928 ghost story \"Wailing Well\", in which a group of masters take the Eton Scout Troop on an ill-fated camping expedition. The song recounts the ancient British tradition of fighting naked, dyed with woad. It has also been known as \"The Woad Song\" and \"Woad of Harlech\".\nLyrics\n:1.\n:What's the good of wearing braces,\n:Vests and pants and boots with laces,\n:Spats or hats you buy in places\n:Down in Brompton Road?\n:What's the use of shirts of cotton,\n:Studs that always get forgotten?\n:These affairs are simply rotten:\n:Better far is woad.\n:Woad's the stuff to show, men.\n:Woad to scare your foemen:\n:Boil it to a brilliant hue\n:And rub it on your back and your abdomen.\n:Ancient Briton ne'er did hit on\n:Anything as good as woad to fit on\n:Neck, or knees, or where you sit on.\n:Tailors, you be blowed.\n:2.\n:Romans came across the Channel\n:All wrapped up in tin and flannel:\n:Half a pint of woad per man'll\n:Dress us more than these.\n:Saxons, you can waste your stitches\n:Building beds for bugs in britches:\n:We have woad to clothe us, which is\n:Not a nest for fleas.\n:Romans keep your armours;\n:Saxons your pyjamas:\n:Hairy coats were meant for goats,\n:Gorillas, yaks, retriever dogs and llamas.\n:Tramp up Snowdon with our woad on:\n:Never mind if we get rained or blowed on.\n:Never want a button sewed on.\n:Go it, Ancient Bs.\nVariants\nLast-line variations include: \"Go it, Ancient Britons\", \"If you stick to Woad\", \"Bottoms up to woad\", \"W - O - A - D\", \"Good for us today\", \"Go it Ancient Brits\", \"Woad for us today!\" and \"Bollocks to the breeze!\"\nThe song appeared in a YHA Songbook from the Youth Hostels Association in the early 1970s.
