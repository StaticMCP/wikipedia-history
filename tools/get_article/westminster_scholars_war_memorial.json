It commemorates 19 former pupils of Westminster School who died in two wars: ten in the Crimean War of 1854–1856, and nine in the Indian Mutiny of 1857–1858. It was designed in High Victorian Gothic style by George Gilbert Scott, who was Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey from 1849 to 1878.\nThe memorial is installed on a triangular plot outside the west entrance to Westminster Abbey, and north of the gatehouse leading to Dean's Yard. It stands near where Broad Sanctuary to the north becomes Victoria Street to the west, with a short road The Sanctuary running to the south and east.\nIt became a Grade II listed building in 1958. Westminster Abbey and the Dean's Yard gatehouse (also designed by Scott in Gothic style, and constructed in 1853–1854) are each separately listed, at Grade I and Grade II respectively. Westminster School is still based in the Abbey's precincts.\nDescription\nThe memorial comprises a tall pink Peterhead granite pillar, carved with a ring of blank shields about halfway up, topped by a Portland stone capital and statues. The statue atop the column was carved by J. R. Clayton and depict Saint George slaying the dragon, below which is a lantern tier with four Gothic niches, housing statues of Saint Edward the Confessor (facing east), Henry III (west), Elizabeth I (south) and Queen Victoria (north), all carved by J. Birnie Philip, above a highly decorated floral capital. The pillar stands on a stone base with four granite pilasters, each topped by a stone statue of a lion, resting on three octagonal steps, ringed by iron railings. The base stands about  high, with the column and statues another  on top.\nInscriptions\nAn inscription on the memorial's north side reads:\nIts south side displays the text:\nAn inscription on its west side reads:\nThe opposite (east) side's inscription says:\n}}\nSee also\n* 1861 in art\nReferences\n* [https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1357257 Crimean War and Indian Mutiny Memorial], National Heritage List for England,  Historic England\n* [https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/11620 Westminster School – Crimea and Indian Mutiny Memorial], War Memorials Register, Imperial War Museums\n* [https://www.warmemorialsonline.org.uk/memorial/111987 Westminster Scholars Memorial], War Memorials Online\nExternal links\n* [http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMMMKZ_The_Westminster_Column_Westminster_London_UK The Westminster Column – Westminster (London, UK)] at Waymarking\n* [http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMCQG6_Westminster_Scholars_Memorial_The_Sanctuary_Westminster_London_UK Westminster Scholars Memorial – The Sanctuary, Westminster, London, UK] at Waymarking"
