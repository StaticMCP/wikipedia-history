One or more duplicate hyperlinks will almost certainly appear needlessly on the viewer's screen. The purpose of links is to direct the reader to a new spot at the point(s) where the reader is most likely to take a temporary detour due to needing more information. Providing more hyperlink samples for the same word in a short space (as in the example of this paragraph) doesn't help much.\nRelated concepts\nThe opposites of overlinking are \"null linking\" and \"underlinking\", which are phenomena in which hyperlinks are reduced to such a degree as to remove all pointers to a likely-needed context of an unusual term, in the text-area where the term occurs. This results in reader frustration. Underlinking results whenever a reader encounters an odd term in an article (perhaps not even for the first time) and wants to briefly browse more deeply at that point, but finds they cannot, but rather is required to conduct an extensive search far up near the beginning of the article, in order to locate the only instance of the word or term being linked— or perhaps even to find that it hasn't been linked at all.\nImpact\nOverlinking may deplete users' attention because it competes with all others, increasing the time of processing all possible choices, and adding extra load on users' working memory (cognitive overload).\nReferences\nno:Overlinking"
