      "text": "# First Dynasty of Gwynedd\n\nThe First Dynasty of Gwynedd was the founding dynasty of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, and ruled over the kingdom for almost four hundred years. Its main branch may also be referred to as the Maelgyning, named after Maelgwn Gwynedd, an important king of the dynasty. This branch was based in Aberffraw. Its other main branch was descended from Cynlas, and was based in Rhos. The two branches at times competed for the title of king.\nThe members of the family claimed descent from Cunedda Wledig, who in legend arrived in Wales sometimes in the fifth century from the Brittonic-speaking areas north of Hadrian's Wall and led a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Irish who had settled in Wales in the previous decades, founding the kingdom of Gwynedd in the process. The family ruled Gwynedd until the succession to the kingdom by the Aberffraw by Merfyn Frych, a ruler from the Isle of Man whose mother was a descendant of Cunedda. Many noble families in medieval Wales claimed descent from Cunedda in the High Middle Ages even as the First Dynasty's rule over Gwynedd had been eclipsed centuries earlier.\nHistory\n, founder of the House of Cunedda]]\nThe House of Gwynedd, divided between the earlier House of Cunedda, which lasted from c.401 to 825, was eventually replaced by the later House of Aberffraw, beginning in 844. The first is so named after Cunedda (386-460), the founding King of Gwynedd in late Roman Britain; following the departure of Magnus Maximus in the 380s, and the second after Aberffraw, the old capital of the Kingdom of Gwynedd.\nThis House was the first not being descended from the male line of Cunedda, as king Hywel ap Rhodri Molwynog was the last in the direct male line. Through inheritances from the great-uncle of Merfyn the Oppressor, the line of Cunedda continued from the maternal side through the House of Aberffraw, and through the House of Dinefwr through Rhodri's son, King Cadell ap Rhodri.\nThe Senior line of the House of Aberffraw descended from Prince Llywelyn the Great in patrilineal succession and became extinct on the death of Owain Lawgoch in 1378, while the House of Dinefwr was succeeded by its cadet branch, the House of Mathrafal.\nLineage\nThe House of Gwynedd claimed descent from the mythical king Beli Mawr through the line of Cunedda (b. 386), as appears in the Harleian genealogies and Jesus College MS 20 genealogies.\nThe House of Aberffraw began with the accession of Rhodri Mawr to the throne of Gwynedd. His father Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad had seized the throne of Gwynedd on the death of the last of the old royal line Hywel ap Rhodri Molwynog, Merfyn was descended from Hywel's father, but through the female line, representing a new start for the family of his son, Rhodri, who settled Aberffraw on Anglesey. He was his maternal grandnephew via the former king's niece Esyllt verch Cynan ap Rhodri Molwynog.\nBeli Mawr legendary descent\nThe descent of Beli Mawr, legendary king of Britain and father in law to Llŷr; and his wife, Anna the Prophetess, cousin of the Virgin Mary.\n)}}\nFamily tree of the House of Gwynedd\nKey\n*Bold for kings & princes e.g. Llywelyn the Great.\n*Italics for royal house or family e.g. House of Tudor.\n*'Standard font' for members of a royal family, i.e. heirs, children and spouses of monarchs e.g. Ethyllt ferch Cynan.\n}}\n–453|Ein=Einion YrthGwynedd–480}}\nCeredigion 453–490|CaG=Cadwallon Lawhir ap EinionGwynedd480–534|Owa=Owain Ddantgwyn}}\nCeredigion 490–523|Cun=CuneglasusRhos andPowys517–550|Mae=Maelgwn GwyneddGwynedd534–547}}\nCeredigion 523–560|Rhu=Rhun Hir ap MaelgwnGwynedd547–586|Mei=Meig ap Cynlas|Ein=Rhos540 – }}\nCeredigion 630–665|Cdw=Cadwallon ap CadfanGwynedd625–634 |Ein=Einion ap Idgwyn}}\nSeisyllwg 735–770|Rho=Rhodri Molwynog ap IdwalGwynedd720–754 |Car=Caradog ap MeirionGwynedd754–798|Tew=Dyfed730–760|Elw=Brycheiniog735–750}}\nSeisyllwg 770–807|Cyn=Cynan Dindaethwy ap RhodriGwynedd798–816 |Hyw=Hywel ap Rhodri MolwynogGwynedd816–825}}\n|Ang=Angharad ferch Meurig}}\nSee also\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nNotes"
