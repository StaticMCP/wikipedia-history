He attended Sathukarn Secondary School until the fourth grade before transferring to the Hua Hin District School, where he completed his ninth-grade studies. Kingpetch completed his secondary school education at Hua Hin Wittayalai School.\nKingpetch was extensively involved in many sports. But his favorite sport was always boxing, going on to tell his friends he would become the first boxing world champion from Thailand. At the time, Chamroen Songkitrat had unsuccessfully challenged for the world bantamweight championship three times from 1954 to 1955.\nBoxing career\nEarly career\nPone Kingpetch turned to professional boxing and won the Thai flyweight title with a TKO victory over Kunoi Vithichai in April 1956. He defended the Thai title against Vithichai on October of that same year.\nIn January 1957, Pone Kingpetch defeated Danny Kid in Bangkok to win the OPBF flyweight title. He made one title defense of the OPBF belt against Hitoshi Misako in September 1957.\nHis ring name, 'Phon,' was given to him by his manager Thongthot Intharathat, the owner of the Kingpetch boxing gym.  It was taken from the name of Major Phon Intharathat, Thongthot's younger brother, who had been a Free Thai member and was killed in the Palace Rebellion.\nWorld flyweight champion\nStatue of Pone Kingpetch at Pone Kingpetch park in Hua Hin|150px\nHe became Thailand's first world boxing champion on April 16, 1960, when he defeated Pascual Pérez of Argentina at Lumphini Boxing Stadium in Bangkok for the world flyweight championship.\nIn his fourth title defense, he lost the title to Fighting Harada of Japan via 11th-round knockout on October 10, 1962. Pone Kingpetch regained the world championship after outpointing Harada in a rematch on January 12, 1963. However, his second reign proved to be short, as Hiroyuki Ebihara knocked Pone out in the first round to become the new world flyweight champion.\nOn February 14, 1963, with the creation of the World Boxing Council, Kingpetch was named the inaugural WBC flyweight champion. Several other champions had been named in some divisions while in others, the reigning champions fought for the inaugural title. In his final title win he defeated Ebihara in a rematch on January 23, 1964, to become a three-time world flyweight champion. After the win in Japan, he travelled to Italy to defend his title against Salvatore Burruni and lost a 15-round decision to the Italian in his final world title fight. He retired from the sport altogether in 1966 at the age of 31.\nLater life and death\nAfter retiring, the money he earned from his boxing career was invested into other businesses. However, the Manawitthaya School, which was built in his hometown during his career, had to be sold. His attempts at running other businesses resulted in financial losses, as Kingpetch proved inadept in the many aspects of business and trade.\nKingpetch was also afflicted with a chronic illness: diabetes. While having a family meal at home, he choked on his food, which got stuck in his windpipe. This resulted in rotting and blood poisoning, leading to Kingpetch's health deteriorating significantly as he was already suffering from both a cold and pneumonia. He was admitted to Ramathibodi Hospital, although his condition did not improve. Kingpetch died on March 31, 1982, from pneumonia and heart failure, He was 47.\nPone Kingpetch was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF) in 2023.\nProfessional boxing record\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|35\n|Win\n|28–7\n|align=left| Kumanthong Yontarakit\n|KO\n|4 (10)\n|Apr 13, 1966\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|34\n|Loss\n|27–7\n|align=left| Baby Lorona\n|SD\n|10\n|Feb 17, 1966\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|33\n|Loss\n|27–6\n|align=left| Salvatore Burruni\n|UD\n|15\n|Apr 23, 1965\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|32\n|Win\n|27–5\n|align=left| Hiroyuki Ebihara\n|SD\n|15\n|Jan 23, 1964\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|31\n|Loss\n|26–5\n|align=left| Hiroyuki Ebihara\n|KO\n|1 (15)\n|Sep 18, 1963\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|30\n|Win\n|26–4\n|align=left| Fighting Harada\n|MD\n|15\n|Jan 12, 1963\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|29\n|Loss\n|25–4\n|align=left| Fighting Harada\n|KO\n|11 (15)\n|Oct 10, 1962\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|28\n|Win\n|25–3\n|align=left| Kyō Noguchi\n|UD\n|15\n|May 30, 1962\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|27\n|Win\n|24–3\n|align=left| Baby Demilonnez\n|TKO\n|8 (10)\n|Feb 19, 1962\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|26\n|Win\n|23–3\n|align=left| Mitsunori Seki\n|SD\n|15\n|Jun 27, 1961\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|25\n|Win\n|22–3\n|align=left| Jose Luis Martinez\n|PTS\n|10\n|Mar 2, 1961\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|24\n|Win\n|21–3\n|align=left| Pascual Pérez\n|TKO\n|8 (15)\n|Sep 22, 1960\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|23\n|Win\n|20–3\n|align=left| Pascual Pérez\n|SD\n|15\n|Apr 16, 1960\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|22\n|Win\n|19–3\n|align=left| Baby Ross\n|KO\n|4 (10)\n|Jan 31, 1960\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|21\n|Win\n|18–3\n|align=left| Manuel Armenteros\n|PTS\n|10\n|Feb 17, 1959\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|20\n|Win\n|17–3\n|align=left| Dangtoy Singmorakot\n|PTS\n|8\n|Nov 4, 1958\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|19\n|Win\n|16–3\n|align=left| Somyod Singmorakot\n|KO\n|5 (10)\n|Jun 28, 1958\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|18\n|Win\n|15–3\n|align=left| Masaji Iwamoto\n|PTS\n|10\n|Mar 14, 1958\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|17\n|Win\n|14–3\n|align=left| Dommy Ursua\n|TD\n|5 (10)\n|Jan 11, 1958\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|16\n|Win\n|13–3\n|align=left| Hitoshi Misako\n|PTS\n|12\n|Sep 14, 1957\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|15\n|Loss\n|12–3\n|align=left| Leo Espinosa\n|PTS\n|12\n|Jul 7, 1957\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|14\n|Win\n|12–2\n|align=left| Danny Kid\n|PTS\n|12\n|Jan 6, 1957\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|13\n|Win\n|11–2\n|align=left| Kunoi Vithichai\n|PTS\n|10\n|Oct 14, 1956\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|12\n|Win\n|10–2\n|align=left| Mintan Kampuch\n|KO\n|4 (6)\n|Jul 22, 1956\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|11\n|Win\n|9–2\n|align=left| Kunoi Vithichai\n|KO\n|6 (6)\n|Jul 14, 1956\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|10\n|Win\n|8–2\n|align=left| Porn Pantukiat\n|KO\n|3 (6)\n|Jun 28, 1956\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|9\n|Win\n|7–2\n|align=left| Prayuth Yontarakit\n|PTS\n|6\n|Jun 3, 1956\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|8\n|Loss\n|6–2\n|align=left| Kunoi Vithichai\n|TKO\n|7 (10)\n|Apr 15, 1956\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|7\n|Win\n|6–1\n|align=left| Boontam Viteechai\n|PTS\n|6\n|Feb 5, 1956\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|6\n|Win\n|5–1\n|align=left| Opas Rorsorpor\n|PTS\n|6\n|Sep 29, 1955\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|5\n|Win\n|4–1\n|align=left| Dejnoi Sorsor\n|PTS\n|6\n|Aug 11, 1955\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|4\n|Win\n|3–1\n|align=left| Yutapon Raksu\n|PTS\n|6\n|Mar 27, 1955\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|3\n|Loss\n|2–1\n|align=left| Suwan Napapon\n|PTS\n|6\n|Feb 1, 1955\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|2\n|Win\n|2–0\n|align=left| Saotong Torsor\n|PTS\n|6\n|Jul 1, 1954\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|-\n|1\n|Win\n|1–0\n|align=left| Noknid Sorsor\n|KO\n|2 (6)\n|May 1, 1954\n|align=left|\n|align=left|\n|}\nTitles in boxing\nMajor world titles\n* NBA (WBA) flyweight champion (112&nbsp;lbs) (3×)\n* WBC flyweight champion (112&nbsp;lbs) (2×)\nThe Ring magazine titles\n* The Ring flyweight champion (112&nbsp;lbs) (3×)\nUndisputed titles\n* Undisputed flyweight champion (3×)\nSee also\n*List of flyweight boxing champions\nNotes and references\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/kingpech.htm Pone Kingpetch -
