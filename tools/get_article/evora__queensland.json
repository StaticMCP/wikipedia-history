Evora was incorporated into Barcaldine.\nGeography\nThe Landsborough Highway forms part of the south-western boundary of the locality.\nEvora Creek rises in the south-east of the locality and flows through the locality exiting to the north-west (Narbethong), eventually becoming a tributary of the Alice River.\nThe principal land use is grazing on native vegetation.\nHistory\nThe locality takes its name from the pastoral run, which was named by Mr Williams after the residence in St Kilda, Melbourne, of banker Francis Grey Smith, who was Williams' cousin. The house was named after the city of Evora in Portugal.\nIn October 1892 the Evora wool shed in Evora was destroyed in a fire.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Evora. The nearest primary and secondary schools are in Barcaldine and Blackall.\nReferences"
