The player is Temeres, a young wizard who aims to defeat an evil wizard named Aldorin. The game is broken up into three segments called \"dimensions\". In the first dimension the player searches for a variety of spells and items, the second dimension requires the player to defeat seven wizards, each inhabiting a maze. The final battle against Aldorin takes place in the third dimension.\n| rev1 = Joystick\n| rev1Score = 3/10\n| rev2 = '\n| rev2Score = 6/10\n| rev3 = '\n| rev3Score = 34%\n}}\nComputer Gaming World said the graphics are the best part of the game and concluded: \"Wizard Wars is best suited to those who want to do hack and slash and not worry about intellectual puzzles.\" Joystick called the menu-based gameplay limited and noted the game as boring.
