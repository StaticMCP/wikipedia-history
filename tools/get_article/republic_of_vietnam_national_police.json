These included the Vietnamese section of the indochinese Sûreté Générale secret police, the Saigon Municipal Police (, or Công an thành phố Sài Gòn in Vietnamese), elements of the colonial National Guard of South Vietnam ( – GNVS, or Vệ binh quốc gia Nam Việt Nam – VBNV in Vietnamese), a rural Gendarmerie force or 'Civil Guard' (, or Cảnh Sát Dân Sự – CSDS in Vietnamese), the Combat Police (, or Cảnh Sát Chiến Dấu – CSCD in Vietnamese) and various provincial militia forces made of irregular auxiliaries ().\nTransferred to South Vietnamese control in 1955, all the aforementioned security units were integrated in the early 1960s into a new national police force with the exception of the Civil Guard, which was placed under the authority of the Ministry of Defence. The CSQG had an initial strength of only 16,000 uniformed and plainclothes agents, being essentially an urban constabulary with no rural Gendarmerie component to counter the threat posed by the increasing Viet Cong (VC) insurgency in the countryside.\nThe National Police under Diệm 1955–1963\nEven before the official creation of the National Police, President Diệm was quick to employ the security forces inherited from the French in repressing both internal political dissent and organized crime.  Throughout the late 1950s and into 1960, they helped the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) in suppressing the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài militant religious and political sects, with approximately 25,000 armed militiamen, and the smaller but better organized Bình Xuyên Saigon-based gangster group.\n1964–1970\nIn February 1965 the new South Vietnamese government removed the popular and effective National Police chief, Colonel Ben, and replaced him with Colonel Phan Van Lieu, who was described by a US advisor as a man who \"doesn't know the difference between a pair of handcuffs and a spittoon.\" Col. Lieu immediately removed numerous subordinates, seriously undermining the morale of the agency that was supposed to be leading the battle against the Viet Cong's subversive infrastructure.\nBy mid-1965 the force had met the American recommended goal of having three police officers for every 1,000 people, a rate higher than the 1.8 officers per 1,000 in the US.\nThe final years 1971–75\nThe CSQG strength peaked in February 1971 at 103,859 personnel – including 3,144 female agents, mostly engaged in clerical work –, 4,450 vehicles and some 830 motorcycles of various types. However, out of this total only 27,565 officers and enlisted men were of career status, the remainder being on contract, daily paid or floating assimilated. Plans were drawn late that year to further expand the Police to 124,050 and later to 160,000, though the actual authorized strength in 1973 stood at about 130,000 men and women.\nStructure\nThe CSQG was organized at national level with logistical and administrative support from Saigon, but individual police departments were under the operational control of the provincial police chiefs. All components of the Police system were administered directly by the Directorate General of National Police (TCCSQG) at the National Police Headquarters in Saigon, which also provided technical or combat support for law-enforcement and other internal security duties throughout the Country. The Directorate General was headed by Sub-Brigadier general Nguyễn Ngọc Loan, who led a staff comprising a deputy director and six assistant directors for administration, personnel and training, intelligence, operations, Field Forces and scientific police. By the late 1960s, the Vietnamese National Police was organized into nine major specialized departments or 'branches', which were:\n* River and Coastal Police\n* Traffic Control Police\n* Judiciary Police\n* Special Police\n* Scientific Police\n* Police Medical Service\n* Administration Service\n* VIP Protection Service\n* Field Police\nTraining facilities\nAll instruction and management of training facilities fell upon the Personnel and Training Directorate (Vietnamese: Ban nhân sự và đào tạo) at National Police headquarters in Saigon. Recruits first underwent the basic 12-week course, which consisted primarily of weapons handling, tactics, Taekwondo and drill, ministered at the main CSQG Training Centre (Vietnamese: Trung tâm đào tạo CSQG) located at Rach Dua, near Vũng Tàu.  After finishing the course, the best-qualified students were selected to be sent for officer training to the National Police Academy (Vietnamese: Học viện cảnh sát quốc gia) at Saigon, where they attended advanced instruction programs at all levels, which comprised:\n* Officer promotion courses up to and including the rank of Lieutenant colonel\n* Administrative and staff training\n* Senior officer seminars\n* Judicial Police training for officers and NCOs\n* Instructors' courses at both officer and lower rank levels\nThose recruits with lower qualifications went instead to the Non-commissioned Officer (NCO) School run by the ARVN at its Combat Training Centre (Vietnamese: Trung tâm huấn luyện chiến đấu) in Da Lat, co-located to the namesake South Vietnamese Armed Forces Military Academy, where they received special training that would enable them to graduate as Police NCOs.\nSpecialists such as field policemen, patrol boat crewmen, vehicle drivers (this category included squad car, armoured car and Jeep drivers, and motorcyclists), radio operators, medics, mechanics, and clerks were trained in various other National Police and Armed Forces' schools. More specialized training was also provided to selected male and female personnel assigned to the other CSQG branches. River and Coastal Police boat crews were trained at the Marine Police Training Centre (Vietnamese: Trung tâm huấn luyện cảnh sát biển) co-located at their Phú Xuân HQ, near Huế. Field Police personnel – including officers and NCOs – underwent eight weeks' of training in paramilitary skills at the police training Centres of Malaysia and the Philippines. Instruction covered subjects such as jungle warfare, intelligence-gathering operations, law-enforcement and riot control techniques.  To upgrade their capabilities, squads and platoons were returned periodically to these training centers for six weeks of unit refresher training, but for most CSDC companies and battalions posted in the provinces their refresher course actually took place in-country at the regional training centers.\nForeign assistance\nAdditional military \"on the job\" training was provided to Field Police units in the field by U.S. Mobile Training Teams or by Australian advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV). Selected officer students attended specialized courses at the International Police Academy in Washington, D.C. while other students were sent to the Royal Malaysian Police Field Force Special Training Centre () at Kentonmen, Ulu Kinta, Perak in Malaysia to attend advanced specialized police and instructor's courses. After graduation, some of these new National Police officers upon returning to South Vietnam would them be posted as Field Police instructors at the Police training centres to pass on their skills to CSDC recruits.\nList of National Police Directors-General\n* Lại Văn Sang\n* Mai Hữu Xuân\n* Nguyễn Ngọc Lễ\n* Nguyễn Văn Tôn\n* Trần Vĩnh Ðắt\n* Trần Bá Thành\n* Nguyễn Chữ\n* Nguyễn Văn Hay\n* Trần Văn Tư\n* Nguyễn Văn Là\n* Nguyễn Ngọc Loan\n* Phạm Xuân Chiểu\n* Ðàm Trung Mộc\n* Nguyễn Văn Y\nList of National Police Commanders\n* Trần Thanh Phong\n* Nguyễn Khắc Bình\nWeapons and equipment\nThe CSQG was lightly armed by military standards, but heavily armed by conventional police standards. Initially, most of its weaponry was surplus French and U.S. World War II/Korean War-vintage. From 1969, rifles, carbines and submachine guns began to be replaced by assault rifles and although the latter became the CSQG's primary weapon, it never displaced entirely the earlier weaponry. Police units had no crew-served weapon systems such as mortars or any other indirect fire weapons.\n*M1917 revolver\n*Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver\n*Smith & Wesson SW2 Bodyguard .38 Special snub-nose revolver\n*Colt Cobra .38 Special snub-nose revolver\n*Smith & Wesson Model 39 pistol\n*Colt.45 M1911A1 automatic pistol\n*M1 Garand battle rifle\n*M1/M2 carbine\n*M3/M3A1 \"Grease Gun\" submachine gun\n*IMI Uzi submachine gun\n*M1A1 Thompson submachine gun\n*M16A1 assault rifle\n*Ithaca model 37 pump-action shotgun\n*Stevens model 77E pump-action shotgun\n*M1918A2 BAR light machine gun\n*M60 machine gun\n*Browning M1919A4 .30 cal medium machine gun\n*M79 grenade launcher\nVehicles\n*Willys MB Jeep\n*Willys M38 MC Jeep\n*Dodge M37 utility truck\n*Kaiser Jeep M715 utility truck\n*M8 Greyhound Light armoured car\n*V-100 Commando armoured personnel carrier/Internal security vehicle\n*1960 Ford Falcon patrol car\n*Harley-Davidson 1957 XLB Sportster motorcycle\nUniforms and insignia\nThe Traffic Control Police agents were given an all-white cotton service uniform consisting of a long-sleeved shirt and trousers, worn with a matching white peaked cap; the shirt had dark blue removable shoulder boards and badges and other insignia were in silvered metal.\nHeadgear\nField Police troopers were given a black beret, worn French-style pulled to the left with the National Police cap badge placed above the right eye.\nA US M-1 Helmet liner painted in shiny black, marked with white-and-red stripes at the sides and the initials \"TC\" (Vietnamese: Tuần Cảnh – patrol) was worn by National Police constables assigned patrol duties or riot control in urban areas.\nFootwear\nBlack leather low laced shoes were perscribed to wear by uniformed Police agents assigned patrol duties on urban areas. Black leather combat boots were provided by the Americans who issued both the early U.S. Army M-1962 'McNamara' model and the M-1967 model with DMS 'ripple' pattern rubber sole, standard issue in the ARVN. Field policemen generally wore the highly prized U.S. Army Jungle boot and black canvas-and-rubber Japanese-produced Indigenous Combat Boots or green canvas-and-rubber Vietnamese-produced \"Goalong\" tropical boots, replaced by commercial plastic or rubber flip-flops and leather peasant sandals while in garrison. Some individuals had zippers put into the insides of their Jungle boots so that they could be laced permanently in a fancy 'airborne' pattern, while the wearer could get into and out of his boots quickly and easily by using the zipper.\nRank insignia\n1955–1962 ranks\n*Tổng kiểm tra – Controller General\n*Kiểm tra – Controller\n*Quận trưởng – Commissioner\n*Biên tập viên – Redactor\n*Thẩm sát viên – Inspector\n*Cảnh sát viên – Patrolman/Patrolwoman\n1962–1971 ranks\n*Tổng kiểm tra – Director General of Police\n*Kiểm tra – Director\n*Quận trưởng thượng hạng – Commissioner 1st class\n*Quận trưởng – Commissioner\n*Biên tập viên thượng hạng – Deputy commissioner\n*Biên tập viên – Chief superintendent\n*Biên tập viên công nhựt – Superintendent\n*Thẩm sát viên thượng hạng – Chief inspector\n*Thẩm sát viên – Inspector\n*Thẩm sát viên công nhựt – Station inspector\n*Phó thẩm sát viên thượng hạng – Sub-inspector 1st class\n*Phó thẩm sát viên – Sub-inspector\n*Phó thẩm sát viên công nhựt – Acting Sub-inspector\n*Cảnh sát viên – Patrolman/Patrolwoman\n1971–1975 ranks\n*Đại tướng – General/Director-General\n*Trung tướng – Lieutenant general/Deputy Director-General\n*Thiếu tướng – Major general\n*Chuẩn tướng – Brigadier general\n*Đại tá – Colonel\n*Trung tá – Lieutenant colonel\n*Thiếu tá – Major\n*Đại úy – Captain\n*Trung úy – First lieutenant\n*Thiếu úy – Second lieutenant\n*Thượng sĩ nhất – First sergeant\n*Thượng sĩ – Master sergeant\n*Trung sĩ nhất – Sergeant first class\n*Cảnh sát viên – Patrolman/Patrolwoman\nInsignia\nRegarding the placement of insignia, the Field Police (CSDC) had a system of its own, originally adapted from their dress uniform. Most CSDC troopers wore no insignia on their field camouflage uniforms while on operations, or sometimes just their Company patch in either cloth or metal versions in a pocket hanger following the French model suspended from the right shirt pocket. Special Recon Teams were issued a round embroidered black patch edged red, with red 'CSQG' and 'TSDB' lettering and winged sword-bayonet pointed down.\nSee also\n* Junk Force\n* List of weapons of the Vietnam War\n* MIKE Force\n* Phoenix Program\n* Provincial Reconnaissance Units\n* Republic of Vietnam Military Forces\n* Royal Thai Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit (PARU)\n* Royal Lao Police\n* South Vietnamese Regional Forces\nEndnotes\nReferences\n* Andrew J.
