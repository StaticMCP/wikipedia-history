This raises the question of the role the media plays in selecting news about such conflicts. Events which support the position of either one of the protagonists in a conflict are understood as instrumental factors in the modern mediated conflict, and the publication of information on these events is construed as one of the major goals of the conflicting parties and one important activity of journalists.\nIn Britain, there were initially five official accredited war correspondents: Philip Gibbs, Percival Philips, Henry Perry Robinson, Herbert Russell, and William Beach Thomas. Their reports were vetted by C. E. Montague. Other writers and journalists who later received official accreditation from the British government were John Buchan, Robert Donald, Hamilton Fyfe, Henry Nevinson, and Valentine Williams.\nPartial list\n* Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett, The Daily Telegraph\n* Charles Bean, Sydney Morning Herald (New South Wales, Australia).\n* Valery Bryusov, Russkiye Vedomosti, (Moscow).\n* Gaston Chérau, ''L'Illustration\n* Basil Clarke, Daily Mail''\n* Richard Harding Davis, Wheeler Syndicate (USA), Daily Chronicle (London)\n* Albert K.
