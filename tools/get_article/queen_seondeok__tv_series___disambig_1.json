Deokman was born as one of the twin daughters of King Jinpyeong and Queen Maya, but due to a prophecy, King Jinpyeong had to send his daughter away from the palace with the help of his clumsy but loyal servant Seohwa, in order to save Queen Maya from being ousted by Mishil, whose ambition was to become Queen. Seohwa raised Deokman as if she were her own, but a turn of events eventually led Deokman into finding out her real identity - only to be abandoned once again by her family in order to save the throne from Mishil's hand, with the exception of her twin sister Cheonmyeon, who ended up losing her life while trying to help Deokman escape. Out of hatred, Deokman set out to take back what was taken from her and avenge her sister by bringing Mishil down and becoming the first female king of Silla with the help of her trusted friend, Yushin, and troubled rogue Bidam who she loved, and ultimately led a rebellion near the end of her reign because of a misunderstanding.\nCast\nMain\n*Lee Yo-won as Princess Deokman, later Queen Seondeok\n**Nam Ji-hyun as young Deokman\n:A charismatic, yet solitary ruler: She was known as the first female ruler in Korean history.

Gyeonggi Province. Other historical dramas such as Dong Yi, Moon Embracing the Sun and Jumong were also filmed there.\nIt was filmed at the Shilla Millennium Park in Gyeongju.\nArtistic license\nThe series adopted significant artistic license regarding the portrayal of historical events in order to accommodate the dramatic storyline. Notably, the reign of King Jinpyeong was compressed by over two decades such that in the series, Queen Seondeok was born within a year of his coronation (her actual date of birth is unknown). Accordingly, the preceding King Jinheung's reign was extended by a similar period, with him being depicted as an elderly man at his death. This allowed for Mishil and other prominent figures during Jinheung's reign to be involved in events concerning the Queen during her time as Royal Princess, even though there is no evidence to suggest what sort of interaction the two had if any. Artistic license was used to imagine her as being of a similar age to Kim Yushin and Bidam, though again, it is not clear historically if this was the case.  Another major change was in the date of her death: Bidam's execution and Kim Alcheon's appointment to his post were ordered by Jindeok of Silla, ten days after Queen Seondeok's death. Queen Jindeok is not mentioned in the series. Most dramatically, the real Seondeok likely never left Silla (stories concerning her childhood in the palace survive) and, although Byzantine artifacts did reach Silla during her childhood and reign, it is highly unlikely that she ever learned Greek.\nPlagiarism controversy\nOn 31 December 2009, Kim Ji-young, an obscure playwright and representative of Great Works Ltd., a culture content company, filed a plagiarism lawsuit against MBC and screenwriters Kim Young-hyun and Park Sang-yeon, saying they plagiarized her script for Seondeok, Queen of Mugunghwa, an unperformed musical she said she wrote in 2005. Kim argued that the development of the story and conflict between characters were similar to her play, including discord between two major female characters, Seondeok and Mishil; a romance between Deokman and General Kim Yushin; and the story of the young Deokman wandering through a desert. The MBC drama contains all of these plot twists, which are not based on history but which Kim says she invented. Kim said she shared some of her scripts with the Korea Creative Content Agency to attract investment in the musical, and believed that was how the content was leaked. Kim asked for  in compensation and an injunction banning the broadcast of the soap opera. The injunction was turned down and Queen Seondeok ran from May to December 2009, but the copyright infringement case continued.\nThe MBC network and the series' writers maintained they did not know of the existence of Kim's play. MBC had copyrighted its script in May 2008. After Kim requested an assessment by experts, the Seoul Southern District Court asked Seoul National University's Center for Law & Technology to investigate. In a process called a \"script autopsy,\" the center first identifies similar content in the two scripts. At that point, university historians confirm historical facts regarding the characters and plot, and differentiate them from literary creations. Afterward, the center makes an appraisal based on copyright laws, then the court makes the final adjudication. In February 2011, the SNU Center for Law & Technology confirmed the plagiarism.\nIn December 2012, the High Court ruled in favor of plaintiff Kim Ji-young that Queen Seondeok was a work of plagiarism, and fined MBC  (). In its ruling, the court stated that though the characters and the details were in fact different, \"the overall plot was the same\" and it is \"most probable that the network relied on the script and plot of the musical to produce their drama.\" Furthermore, any additional reruns on cable TV and internet, and the making of DVD and related books were banned.\nAwards and nomination\n;\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Award\n!Category\n!Recipient\n!Result\n!Ref\n|-\n! rowspan=\"33\" |2009\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Grimae Awards\n|Daesang Award\n|Kim Geun-hong / Park Hong-kyun\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Best Actress\n|Lee Yo-won\n|\n|-\n|Job Korea\n|Best Actress\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"24\" |MBC Drama Awards\n|Grand Prize (Daesang)\n|\n| rowspan=\"24\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Top Excellence Award - Actress\n|Lee Yo-won\n|\n|-\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|-\n|Top Excellence Award - Actor\n|Uhm Tae-woong\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Excellence Award - Actor\n|Kim Nam-gil\n|\n|-\n|Jeon No-min\n|\n|-\n|Excellence Award - Actress\n|Park Ye-jin\n|\n|-\n|Golden Acting Award - Supporting Actor\n|Ahn Gil-kang\n|\n|-\n|Golden Acting Award - Supporting Actress\n|Seo Young-hee\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Best New Actor\n|Yoo Seung-ho\n|\n|-\n|Lee Seung-hyo\n|\n|-\n|Kim Nam-gil\n|\n|-\n|PD Award\n|Shin Goo\n|\n|-\n|Best Young Actress\n|Nam Ji-hyun\n|\n|-\n|Writer of the Year\n|Kim Young-hyun / Park Sang-yeon\n|\n|-\n|Best Couple Award\n|Kim Nam-gil and Lee Yo-won\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Popularity Award - Actor\n|Kim Nam-gil\n|\n|-\n|Lee Seung-hyo\n|\n|-\n|Yoo Seung-ho\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Popularity Award - Actress\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|-\n|Lee Yo-won\n|\n|-\n|Park Ye-jin\n|\n|-\n|Viewer's Favorite Drama of the Year\n|Queen Seondeok\n|\n|-\n|Special Award - Martial Arts Director\n|Kim Sung-shil\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |DramaBeans Awards\n|Favourite Drama of 2009\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Queen Seondeok\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|Top 3 Favourite Drama of 2009\n|\n|-\n|Favourite Historical Drama\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Favourite Character\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|-\n|Kim Nam-gil\n|\n|-\n|10th Korea Visual Arts Festival\n|Photogenic Award\n|Lee Yo-won\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"17\" |2010\n|Korea Producers & Directors' Awards\n|PD Award - Acting\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"8\" |46th Baeksang Arts Awards\n|Daesang / Grand Prize - TV\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Best New Actor - TV\n|Kim Nam-gil\n|\n|-\n|TV Screenplay Award - TV\n|Kim Young-hyun\n|\n| rowspan=\"6\" |\n|-\n|Best Actress Award - TV\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|-\n|Directing Award - TV\n|Park Hong-gyun\n|\n|-\n|Best Picture - TV\n|Queen Seondeok\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Female Popularity Award - TV\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|-\n|Park Ye-jin\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |37th Korea Broadcasting Awards\n|Best Actress\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|\n|-\n|Best Art Direction\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Queen Seondeok\n|\n|\n|-\n|Best Lighting\n|\n|\n|-\n|Best Video Graphics\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |5th Seoul International Drama Awards\n|Best Drama Series\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|Outstanding Korean Actress - TV\n|Go Hyun-jung\n|\n|-\n|Outstanding Korean Screenwriter\n|Kim Young-hyun / Park Sang-yeon\n|\n|-\n|Asia Model Awards\n|Special Award for Asian Drama\n|Lee Yo-won\n|\n|\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://officialsubtitledmovies.blogspot.com/ The Great Queen Seondeok All Episodes Subtitled In English In HD]\n* [http://www.imbc.com/broad/tv/drama/seonduk/ Queen Seondeok official MBC website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714124942/http://content.mbc.co.kr/english/drama/09/1741200_56083.html The Great Queen Seondeok] at MBC Global Media\n*\n*"
