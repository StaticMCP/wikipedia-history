Once completed, it will be the second longest highway in Czech Republic, running from Úlibice to the D1 at Lipník nad Bečvou. The motorway is part of the European route E442. Around Hradec Králové, the D35 runs in parallel with the D11 (between the Sedlice interchange and the Plotiště interchange).\nAfter completion (planned for 2028), it will become an alternative route to motorway D1 between Prague and Olomouc and Ostrava. The first segment was opened in the 1970s. , 89&nbsp;km of full motorway are in operation in three segments.\nChronology\nOriginally, the D35 motorway from Hradec Králové to Lipník nad Bečvou was planned. However, in 1987, it was decided to build the R35 expressway instead of the motorway and to extend its route to Liberec. The rest of the R35 expressway is classified as a Class I road for motor vehicles.\nCurrently, the section of the D35 motorway Mohelnice - Olomouc - Lipník nad Bečvou is in operation with a break near Křelov near Olomouc. A section of the former R35 Liberec - Turnov expressway is also in operation, but it has not been classified as a motorway and since 1 January 2016 has been an I/35 road.\nOn 27 November 2009, the section Sedlice - Opatovice nad Labem was put into operation with a length of approximately 3.5&nbsp;km. The three-storey Opatovice interchange is one of the largest intersections in the Czech Republic. The last of the interchange sections around Hradec Kralove were completed in December 2021.\nOn 15 December 2021, the Opatovice nad Labem - Časy section of the motorway was put into operation. This, together with the opening of other sections of the D11 motorway, enabled the transfer of transit from Svitavy in the direction of Prague, Jičín and Jaroměř outside Hradec Králové. The connecting section to Ostrov was opened a year later, in December 2022.\nFuture development\nŘSD envisions several sections of the D35 to continue into the direction of Liberec. A  long section between is under construction since November 2023, and is set to be opened in 2025. More sections are in planning.\nThe motorway also has several lengthy sections in construction and in planning between Hradec Králové and Olomouc. A  long section between Ostrov - Vysoké Mýto is in construction, and is planned to be open for operation for 2026. Also in construction and planned for opening with the section, is the very short  Homole tunnel under a 307 metre hill.\nOther sections on that stretch in construction include Vysoké Mýto - Džbánov, a  long section, in construction since November 2023 and planned for a 2025 opening; Džbánov - Litomyšl, a  long section, where Budimex began construction in April 2024, and the opening is planned for 2027, with the section Janov - Opatovec planned for a December 2025 opening.\nIn Olomouc, a  realignment called the Northern Connection will bridge the gap between the Lipník nad Bečvou - Olomouc section, connecting with the D35 section between Olomouc and Mohelnice, grade separating traffic to Olomouc. This link is under construction and will be complete on 20 November 2025. This section will remove the break near Křelov near Olomouc.\nImages\nFile:Rychlostní komunikace R35 na obchvatu Olomouce blízko letiště, Olomouc (02).jpg|Highway D35 near Olomouc.\nFile:Opatovice nad Labem kruhový objezd from air K2 -1.jpg|D35 near Opatovice nad Labem\nFile:Loštice, dálnice.jpg|D35 in Loštice\nReferences\nContent in this edit is translated from the existing Czech Wikipedia article at :cs:Dálnice D35; see its history for attribution.\nExternal links\n*[http://www.motorway.cz/motorway-net#d35 Info on motorway.cz]\n*[http://www.ceskedalnice.cz/dalnice/d35/ Info on ceskedalnice.cz]\n*[http://www.dalnice-silnice.cz/D35.htm Info on dalnice-silnice.cz]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172829/http://krajinazp.ic.cz/r_35.htm Ecology vs. R 35]"
