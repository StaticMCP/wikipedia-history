In 1940, along with his brother, he volunteered for part of Layforce in the Second World War. In 1941, he joined the SAS in North Africa, taking part in numerous raids. He later served in the European theater and took part in the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\nSeekings is the subject of a biography titled ‘SAS: Duty Before Glory’ whereby he is attributed as one of or perhaps the most battle-hardened British soldier of WW2.\nSeekings later served in the British South Africa Police, and emigrated to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to farm tobacco. Seekings then returned to the United Kingdom shortly after Zimbabwean independence.\nIn popular culture\nSeeking is portrayed by Theo Barklem-Biggs in the BBC action drama SAS: Rogue Heroes.\nReferences"
