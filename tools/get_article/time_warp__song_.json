The song title comes from a dance performed during the pre-chorus of the song.\nComposition and lyrics\nThe song is both an example and a parody of the dance song genre, with much of its lyrics consisting of instructions for performing the dance. (Example: \"It's just a jump to the left / And then a step to the right / Put your hands on your hips / Bring your knees in tight.\")\nThis dance became one of the major audience participation activities during screenings of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show and live performances of the original 1973 stage production The Rocky Horror Show.\nThe song is a glam rock and rock and roll song. It is written by Richard O'Brien and Richard Hartley. The song is in the key of A major with a tempo of 174 beats per minute.\nPlacement\n\"Time Warp\" was the fifth song in the original stage show (after \"Science Fiction/Double Feature\", \"Dammit Janet\", \"Over at the Frankenstein Place\" and \"Sweet Transvestite\") where it was performed by Riff-Raff (Richard O'Brien), Magenta (Patricia Quinn), Columbia (Nell Campbell) and the Narrator (Jonathan Adams), but fourth in the film (following \"Over at the Frankenstein Place\" and preceding \"Sweet Transvestite\"). O'Brien, Quinn and Campbell reprised their roles from the stage production in the film but the Narrator, now renamed the Criminologist, was instead played by Charles Gray. In the 2016 TV production, ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time-Warp Again'', the number was performed by Reeve Carney (Riff-Raff), Christina Milian (Magenta), Annaleigh Ashford (Columbia) and Tim Curry (the Criminologist).\nStage productions continued to use the original placement until Richard O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 West End revival in which he moved the song to the film's placement. For reasons of pacing, most productions now follow this order.\nThe song is reprised briefly at the end of the film, in flashback, and in the stage show it serves as an encore led by Dr. Frank N. Furter (played by Tim Curry in the original stage production and film).\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=3| Original Australian cast recording\n|-\n!Chart (1977)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|85\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2| The Rocky Horror Picture Show\n|-\n!Chart (1980–81)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Canada (RPM Top Singles)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|12\n|-\n|Europe (Euro Digital Songs) (Billboard)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|16\n|-\n|France\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|UK (UK Singles Chart)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|-\n|U.S. (Billboard) (Hot 100)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|29\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
