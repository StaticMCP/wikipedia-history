She was also the mother of most his children and the first Goryeo queen to use her maternal surname, Hwangbo.\nShe was born in 925, while her marriage is believed to have taken place between 937 and 943. In 956, when Gwangjong proclaimed the law of slaves' emancipation (), she strongly opposed it and begged him earnestly, but Gwangjong ignored and rejected her pleas. Daemok's opposition to the law stemmed from the Hwangbo clan, whose interests she was trying to protect; however, in Gwangjong's eyes, her maternal family was only one of the noble families to be removed.\nHer death is presumed to have occurred after 975 but before 1002, when King Mokjong (her only grandson) gave her a posthumous name. She was enshrined in Heolleung tomb along with her husband.\nPosthumous names\n*In April 1002 (5th year reign of King Mokjong), name An-jeong (안정, 安靜) was added.\n*In March 1014 (5th year reign of King Hyeonjong), name Seon-myeong (선명, 宣明) was added.\n*In April 1027 (18th year reign of King Hyeonjong), name Ui-jeong (의정, 懿正) and Sin-gyeong (신경, 信敬) were added.\n*In October 1056 (10th year reign of King Munjong), name Gong-pyeong (공평, 恭平) was added.\n*In October 1253 (40th year reign of King Gojong), name Jeong-ye (정예, 靜睿) was added to her posthumous name too.\nFamily\n*Father, also father-in-law: King Taejo of Goryeo (31 January 877 – 7 July 943)\n**Grandfather: King Sejo of Goryeo (840–897)\n**Grandmother: Lady Han, Queen Wisuk (850–?)\n*Biological mother: Queen Sinjeong of the Hwangju Hwangbo clan (신정왕후 황보씨; 901–19 August 983)\n**Grandfather: Hwangbo Je-gong (869–?)\n**Older brother: Daejong of Goryeo (937–969); married his half-sister, Queen Seonui (937–?)\n*Stepmother, also mother-in-law: Queen Sinmyeong (880–?)\n**Husband (formerly half brother): King Gwangjong of Goryeo (925 – 4 July 975)\n***1st daughter: Wang Ah-ji (왕아지, 王阿志), Lady Cheonchujeon (950–?)\n****Son-in-law: Prince Cheonchujeon (950–?)\n***2nd daughter: Queen Mundeok of the Yu clan (문덕왕후 유씨; 955–?)\n****Son-in-law: Wang Gyu, Prince Hongdeokwon (951–?); had a daughter who would become the first wife of King Mokjong\n****Son-in-law: King Seongjong of Goryeo (15 January 960 – 29 November 997); had no issue\n***1st son: King Gyeongjong of Goryeo (9 November 955 – 13 August 981)\n***2nd son: Prince Hyohwa (956–959)\n***3rd daughter: Lady Bohwa\nIn popular culture\nQueen Daemok is often portrayed as an antagonist when the stories are based on Gwangjong's reign period.\n*Portrayed by Jun Hye-jin in the 2002–2003 KBS TV series The Dawn of the Empire.\n*Portrayed by Lee Young-ah in the 2009 KBS2 TV series Empress Cheonchu.\n*Portrayed by Lee Hanee in the 2015 MBC TV series Shine or Go Crazy.\n*Portrayed by Kang Han-na in the 2016 SBS TV series Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0014364 Queen Daemok] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[https://m.etoday.co.kr/view.php?idxno=1440062 Queen Daemok] on EToday News .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000835057 대목왕후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
