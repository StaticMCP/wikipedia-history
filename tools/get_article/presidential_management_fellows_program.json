After completing the program, agencies may convert PMFs to permanent federal civilian employees. The program started in 1977, was renamed in 2003, and abolished in 2025.\nHistory\nThe PMF Program was established by Executive Order in 1977, and amended by in 2003, to attract to the federal service outstanding citizen-scholars from a variety of academic disciplines and career paths who have a clear interest in, and commitment to, excellence in the leadership and management of public policies and programs. Program regulations were amended again in December 2010 establishing the PMF Program as one of the three student Pathways to federal employment. By drawing graduate students from diverse social and cultural backgrounds, the PMF Program provided a continuing source of trained men and women to meet the future challenges of public service.  The PMF program was formerly referred to as the Presidential Management Internship (PMI) program. In September 2013, OPM added a new STEM track to the PMF process to increase opportunities for science and technology students and meet the demand for qualified candidates for these roles in government, but this track was later removed. In February 2025, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order that ended the program.\nEligibility\nThere are two situations where graduate students may be eligible to apply to the PMF program. Graduate students from all academic disciplines who expect to complete an advanced degree from a qualifying college or university by August 31 of the academic year in which the competition is held are eligible to become Fellows. Alternatively, those who have completed an advanced degree (masters or professional) from a qualifying college or university during the previous 2 years from the opening date of the PMF Program's application announcement are eligible. Individuals who previously applied for the program, but were not selected as a Finalist, may reapply if they meet eligibility requirements. Finalists come from a diverse range of graduate institutions, but the schools with the most PMF Finalists in 2014 included American University, University of Michigan, Harvard University, Georgetown University, George Washington University, Columbia University, and Johns Hopkins University.\nThe application process requires a résumé, an online assessment, and short essays. Potential fellows should demonstrate breadth and quality of accomplishments, capacity for leadership, exceptional oral and written communication skills, and a commitment to excellence in the leadership and management of public policies and programs. The application occurs usually during the autumn. OPM announces finalists names during winter. Those who are nominated as finalists remain finalists for one year, unless appointed by an agency during that year. Finalists may reapply to the Program before the year of appointment eligibility ends; however, status as a current Finalist is forfeited upon accessing the on-line assessment. The program is extremely competitive: for the PMF Class of 2013, there were 663 finalists (eligible for appointment as Fellows), who were selected from well over 12,000 nominees, an acceptance rate of approximately 5.5%.\nAlumni\nPresidential Management Alumni Association (PMAA)\nThe Presidential Management Alumni Association (PMAA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization created to improve, expand, and promote the alumni community as well as the PMF Program.\nPMAG\nThe non-profit Presidential Management Alumni Group (PMAG) was formerly the primary alumni group for PMIs and PMFs. It was organized in 1981 to advance the professionalism of public service and augment the education and career development of those who have served in or assisted the PMF Program. PMAG was not sponsored by OPM. The members were Fellows, alumni, and other individuals interested in recruitment and development of Federal Government career managers. PMAG sponsored professional and social activities, maintained a network among alumni, and provided support to maintain the PMF Program as the Federal Government’s premier mechanism for recruiting future managers.\nNotable alumni\n* Craig B.
