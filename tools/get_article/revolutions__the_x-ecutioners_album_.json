It features guest appearances from Aasim, Anikke, Black Thought, Blue Man Group, B-Real, dead prez, Fat Joe, Ghostface Killah, Josey Scott, Rob Zombie, Roc Marciano, Saigon, Scram Jones, Sly Boogie, Start Trouble, and Trife Diesel. The album peaked at number 118 on the Billboard 200, number 50 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 24 on the Top Rap Albums in the United States.\nThree singles were released \"Live from the PJs\", \"Like This\" and \"Back to Back\".

However, the song appeared in 2004 video game NFL Street.\nCritical reception\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = Alternative Press\n| rev2score =\n| rev3 = Blender\n| rev3score =\n| rev4 = Entertainment Weekly\n| rev4score = B\n| rev5 = IGN\n| rev5score = 7/10\n| rev6 = RapReviews\n| rev6score = 9/10\n| rev7 = Rolling Stone\n| rev7score =\n| rev8 = Spin\n| rev8score = B+\n| rev9 = Tiny Mix Tapes\n| rev9score =\n| rev10 = URB\n| rev10score =\n}}\nRevolutions was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 63, based on twelve reviews.\nAlternative Press called it \"solidly entertaining\", Splendid — \"pretty breathtaking\", and Blender critic found that the album \"stands on its own, with... an emphasis on beats rather than technical tricks\". Neil Drumming in his review for Entertainment Weekly stated: \"the X-ecutioners force the ire on their third album, Revolutions, with mixed results\". Soren Baker wrote: \"these songs are accented by the X-ecutioners' deft scratching and energetic beats, resulting in a regularly exciting and inventive album\". AllMusic's David Jeffries resumed: \"the just fair pop tracks keep it from being classic, but this is the best the talented team has sounded on record yet\".\nIn mixed reviews, Q said that \"the trio's scratching feels peripheral, and when it does take centre stage, is underwhelming\". Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone found that \"too many forgettable concoctions make this just another so-so DJ mix\".\nIn negative reviews, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that \"all too often finds X-Ecutioners playing second fiddle to an outsized roster of uninspired guests\". Tiny Mix Tapes saw it as \"an extremely boring affair, never building any momentum from the start to finish\".\nTrack listing\n| extra2 =\n| length2 = 1:45\n| title3 = Live from the PJs\n| note3 = featuring Ghostface Killah, Trife and Black Thought\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 = Roc Raida\n| length3 = 2:53\n| title4 = Like This\n| note4 = featuring Anikke\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = The Professionals\n| length4 = 3:23\n| title5 = C'mon\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 =\n| length5 = 2:51\n| title6 = Skit 2\n| writer6 =\n| extra6 =\n| length6 = 2:05\n| title7 = Back to Back\n| note7 = featuring Saigon and Scram Jones\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 = Roc Raida\n| length7 = 3:08\n| title8 = Let Me Rock\n| note8 = featuring Start Trouble\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 =\n| length8 = 3:26\n| title9 = The Regulators\n| note9 = featuring Roc Marciano and Sly Boogy\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 = Roc Raida\n| length9 = 3:15\n| title10 = Space Invader\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 = The Professionals\n| length10 = 3:36\n| title11 = Old School Throwdown\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 = Sean C\n| length11 = 2:36\n| title12 = Get With It\n| note12 = featuring B-Real\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 = The Professionals\n| length12 = 3:29\n| title13 = (Even) More Human than Human\n| note13 = featuring Rob Zombie, Slug and Josey Scott\n| writer13 =\n| extra13 =\n| length13 = 3:58\n| title14 = Skit 3\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 =\n| length14 = 1:16\n| title15 = Sucka Think He Cud Wup Me\n| note15 = featuring dead prez\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 = The Ratt Pakk\n| length15 = 3:40\n| title16 = The Truth\n| note16 = featuring Fat Joe and Aasim\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 = Sean C\n| length16 = 3:40\n| title17 = Ill Bill\n| writer17 =\n| extra17 =\n| length17 = 3:59\n| title18 = Skit 4\n| writer18 =\n| extra18 =\n| length18 = 0:39\n| total_length = 51:37\n}}\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2004)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak position\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
