It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\nIt is a one-story four-bay brick house which was assessed to have \"one of the best examples in the county of Federal domestic architecture; the interior is especially significant.\"\nIt was built by David Edwards, from Columbia, at age 15;  David died at Battle of Shiloh in 1862 at age 32.  It was later owned by George L. Edwards, a murderer and a famous outlaw of Green County.\nA second contributing building on the property is an \"unusual\" stepped chimney log smokehouse with half-dovetailing.\nSee also\n*Edwards House (Exie, Kentucky)\nReferences"
