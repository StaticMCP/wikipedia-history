The Uzbeks, under Ubaidullah Khan, took advantage of the chaos and invaded northeastern Iran, capturing Tus and Astarabad and besieging Herat. Shah Tahmasp I, who was only 14 years old, led the Safavid campaign against Uzbeks. Amid the war, Zulfiqar Khan, the chief the Kalhor tribe and emir of the Kurds, expanded from his territory in Kermanshah, capturing Lorestan, and advancing towards Baghdad, which was under his uncle Ibrahim Khan Mawsillu, the Safavid governor of Arab Iraq. Zulfiqar Khan sieged Baghdad for forty days. He fully captured Baghdad with his two brothers Ahmad and Mohamad, eventually extending his rule over nearly all of Arab Iraq. Zulfiqar Khan declared independence from the Safavids and went to Istanbul for help from the Ottoman Empire.Roemer, H. R. (2008). \"The Safavid Period\". The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 6: The Timurid and Safavid Periods. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 189–350. ISBN 9781139054980. In addition to the Kalhor tribe, the Kurdish tribes who participated in the conquest also included Wand, Zangana, and Pazuki. In his memoirs, Shah Tahmasp I wrote that he was headed to Khorasan to fight Uzbek invaders at the beginning of the 1527, although in Tehran, news reached him concerning Zulfiqar Beg, son of Ali Beg, who was known as Nukhud Sultan and at that time was chief of the Kalhor Kurds, who had just rebelled against his uncle Ibrahim Khan Mawsillu. Zulfiqar Beg massacred his uncle and cousins in Baghdad. Shah Tahmasp I vowed not to fight in Baghdad until the Uzbeks were defeated. In 1528, the Safavids advanced towards Baghdad. After a long and difficult struggle, the Safavids recaptured Baghdad on June 10 1529, afterwards returning to Persian Iraq. Five years later, in  1534, Baghdad was captured by the Ottomans, after the Safavids fled the city.\nReferences"
