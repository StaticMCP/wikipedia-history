During trading with the Ahousaht Nation, a part of the Nuu-chah-nulth in Clayoquot Sound late in 1864 the vessel was attacked and its captain, a Captain Stephenson, and three crew members were massacred.  , a small gunboat, was dispatched to the scene but due to overwhelming superiority of Ahousaht forces waited for reinforcements, which came in the form of the screw frigate  and its fifty guns.  Holding offshore from Marktosis, one of the main Ahousaht communities, Admiral Denman, commander of the vessel, demanded the surrender of Chapchah, who had masterminded the killings.  When the residents refused, Denman opened fire on the village, destroying it.  Subsequently, the village of Moyat and others were destroyed by shellfire and incendiary rockets from Sutlej.\nSee also\n* List of ships in British Columbia\nReferences\n* [http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/page-478-eng.asp Justice at the Muzzle of a Cannon, Canadian Military Heritage Website]\n* [http://www.cimorelli.com/cgi-bin/magellanscripts/ship_bio1.asp?ShipName=Fisher Tacoma Public Library website]"
