Built in 1917 by H. S. Garrett, in this house the 42nd president of the United States, Bill Clinton, spent the first four years of his life, having been born on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas. The house was owned by Clinton's maternal  grandparents, Edith Grisham and James Eldridge Cassidy, and they cared for him when his mother, Virginia, was away working as an anesthetist in New Orleans.\nOn May 19, 1994, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places (as \"Bill Clinton Birthplace\"). Tours were offered by the Clinton Birthplace Foundation. In accordance with the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (§7002), the Secretary of the Interior accepted the property on December 14, 2010, establishing it as a national historic site and a unit of the National Park System. This change in status was originally proposed by Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas.  Bill Clinton and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar formally dedicated the site on April 16, 2011.\nThe museum is a stop on the \"Billgrimage\", which includes the Clinton House in Fayetteville and the Bill Clinton Presidential Library, among other sites.\nFile:First home of Bill Clinton (24058932888).jpg|Side view\nFile:Bill Clinton Birthplace.jpg|Other side view\nSee also\n* List of residences of presidents of the United States\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Hempstead County, Arkansas\n* List of areas in the United States National Park System#National Historic Sites\n* Presidential memorials in the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nps.gov/wicl/index.htm Official NPS website]\n*[http://www.c-span.org/video/?151639-1/life-portrait-bill-clinton \"Life Portrait of Bill Clinton\"], from C-SPAN's American Presidents: Life Portraits, broadcast from the Clinton Center and Birthplace, December 20, 1999"
