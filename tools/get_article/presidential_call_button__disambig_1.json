This call button, also referred to as a valet button, is used to call aides to the President for various reasons. The modern version of the call button has been present since at least the George W. Bush presidency. Earlier versions of presidential call bells and buzzers have existed since the early 1800s.\nHistory\nPast call buttons and buzzers\nduring 9/11, with the call button on the desk, to his left]]\npointing out the call button to Washington, D.C. area students.]]\n's telephone on the Resolute desk in March 2017]]\nBefore the mid 1800s, a series of call bells was installed in the White House and used as a form of staff communication. This system was followed by a battery operated device, used by the President, that could be used to call on staff. The White House was wired for electricity in 1891 allowing for simple wired call-buttons.\nAn 1881 letter written by White House disbursing agent William H. Crook refers to an electric bell attached to president James Garfield's desk.\nBetty C. Monkman notes in The White House: Its Historic Furnishings & First Families that the Treaty table, also known as the Grant Cabinet table, has the remains of a call button system still attached to it, but does not state when this system was used.\nIn the 1889 Publication Historic Homes in Washington; its noted men and women by Mary S. Lockwood a story is told about Benjamin Harrison's grandson pushing a call button on the President's desk. She wrote:\n}}\nLyndon Johnson had a series of buttons, or keys, to summon different drinks to the Oval Office, Cabinet Room, and \"Little Lounge\" (a room just next to the Oval Office). In the Oval Office the keys were on the table behind the president's desk. The four keys were for coffee, tea, Coca-Cola and Fresca; when pressed, a butler would fulfill the president's drink request.\nDuring Johnson's presidency he was known for having extramarital affairs, with what Robert Dallek in his book Lone Star Rising: Lyndon Johnson and His Times called a harem of women. Ronald Kessler in his book Inside the Whitehouse describes multiple sexual encounters between Johnson and his secretaries in the Oval Office including one where his wife, Ladybird Johnson, walked in on Johnson and a secretary in the midst of having sex, leading to the installation of a buzzer system to warn him if Ladybird was on her way.\nSeveral presidents had buttons or switches installed in their desk in the Oval Office to start recording devices attached to microphones in the room. This includes Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.\nModern call button\non 25 February 2025]]\nThe modern call button sits in an approximately  wooden box marked with a golden presidential seal and has been on the Resolute desk since at least the George W. Bush presidency. According to Richard Branson, President Obama repurposed it to order tea for his White House guests.\nDuring Donald Trump's first term, when pressed, a signal summoned a valet who brought a Diet Coke on a silver platter. At one time Walt Nauta had this job. Trump reportedly also used the button to request lunch, and to pull a \"recurring bit\" on new visitors to the White House. Trump stated to one reporter that \"everyone thinks it is [the nuclear button]\" and that people \"get a little nervous when I press that button.\"\nTrump further conflated this button with the nuclear button with a tweet in January 2018:\n}}\nRachel Plotnick notes in her book Power Button that the \"sexual one-upmanship\" in this tweet was quickly undercut by news outlets noting the only button on Trump's desk \"summons the White House steward with a Coca-Cola (really).\"\nIn the first few days of Joe Biden's presidency, it was reported that he had the button removed; however, it appeared to return a few weeks later when a White House official told Politico that the button was back on the desk with an unspecified purpose. James Corden has said that Joe Biden had an \"ice cream button\" on his desk.\nDespite reports that the button remained during the rest of Biden's term, following Trump's second inauguration, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Diet Coke button was \"back\", with the purpose it had during his first term.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XUfLs6VlGUI \"President Trump Shares The Secret Behind the Red Button In the Oval Office\" from CBS Chicago]"
