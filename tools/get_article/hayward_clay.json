However, the Aggies lost the Cotton Bowl 28–3 to Notre Dame. In 1993, he appeared in 11 games as a sophomore, while making five receptions for 85 yards.

In 1995, as a senior he had his best season, posting 10 starts, 19 receptions for 235 yards and three touchdowns. He played in 46 career games, finishing with 30 receptions for 368 yards and three touchdowns.\nProfessional career\nSt. Louis Rams\nClay was selected  by the St. Louis Rams in the sixth round (201st overall) of the 1996 NFL draft.
