For the 2019 contest, the United Kingdom finished in twenty-sixth (last) place out of twenty-six competing entries with the song \"Bigger than Us\" performed by Michael Rice.\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country.

The song, selected in late January 2020 by the BBC together with a professional panel consisting of Norbury, Lisa Cullington (music publisher at BMG) and Jamie Nelson (Vice President of A&R at BMG), would also be produced and released by the label.\nOn 27 February 2020, the song \"My Last Breath\" written by James Newman, Ed Drewett, Adam Argyle and Iain James and performed by James Newman was revealed as the British entry during The Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Greg James and The Ken Bruce Show on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2, respectively. Iain James had previously written the Azerbaijani Eurovision Song Contest 2011 winning song \"Running Scared\". The song was also presented to the public on the same day through the release of the official music video, which was directed by Charlie Lightening and filmed in early 2020 at the Sněžka mountain on the border between the Czech Republic and Poland, via the official Eurovision Song Contest's YouTube channel.\nAt Eurovision\nAccording to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to compete in one of two semi-finals, and qualify in order to participate in the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final.
