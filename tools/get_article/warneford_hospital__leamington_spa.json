The foundation stone was laid in 1832 and it opened in 1834. It was initially funded either by the patients themselves, by wealthy individual donors or by collections made from the general public.\nThe maternity unit, the Cay Block, was financed by donations and collections organised by Mrs Annie Cay. The hospital became the main birthplace for local babies after the Cay Block opened in 1939. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and Radio Warneford first broadcast in 1973.\nAfter services transferred to either Warwick Hospital or Walsgrave Hospital (now University Hospital Coventry), the hospital closed in 1993.\nNotable patients\n*Ernest Parke (1860-1944), journalist and newspaper editor, died here\nReferences"
