Operating under Unix-like systems, it uses finite-difference time-domain method with perfectly matched layer or periodic boundary conditions for field computation.\nMeep supports dispersive, nonlinear and anisotropic media, and features subpixel smoothing and parallelization, as well as an embedded frequency-domain solver for steady-state fields and eigenmode expansion. The package was subsequently expanded to include an adjoint solver for topology optimization and inverse design, and a Python interface.\nThe software is widely adopted by optics and photonics communities, with applications including the analysis and design of metalenses and photonic crystals.\n}}\nExternal links\n*\n*"
