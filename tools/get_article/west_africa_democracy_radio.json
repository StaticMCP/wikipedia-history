      "text": "# West Africa Democracy Radio\n\nWest Africa Democracy Radio (WADR) is a trans-territorial, sub-regional broadcaster based in Dakar, Senegal. WADR is a project of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) set up in 2003 to protect and defend the ideals of democratic and open societies by disseminating development information through a network of community radios in the West African sub-region.\nThe WADR network comprises nearly 40 partner radios in eight West African countries and a chain of correspondents in ten countries in the region. WADR broadcasts in French and English on 94.9 FM in Dakar, via satellite on Astra 4A to sub-Saharan Africa, and streams to the African diaspora from its website.\nIn April 2011, Sourcefabric worked with West Africa Democracy Radio to build a news platform for the station using Airtime, Newscoop and SoundCloud integration. The project was named as a special distinction winner in the 2011 Knight-Batten Awards for Innovations in Journalism which identify projects developing interactive journalism.\nSee also\n*List of radio stations in Senegal\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
