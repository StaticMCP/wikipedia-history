The British colonial government have yet to fully resume its duties.  Citizens themselves are flushing out the remaining traitors one by one.  Soon, multiple societies of different legions were formed within the HK underground.  Each one tries to control the city in a time of very weak and corrupt governance.  Eventually the big clans merge, expand and betray one another.  The two major rivals, one run by the Lok family head Lok Zung-hing (Chow Yun-fat), the other by Ng Yat-tin (Tai Chi-wai) would collide.\nProduction note\nFive years prior to the release of this series, the producer Chiu Chun-keung (招振強) collaborated with Chow-Yun-fat to release The Bund, a similarly themed story except in Shanghai instead of Hong Kong.\nCast\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"55%\"\n|- style=\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\" align=center\n|style=\"width:25%\"|Cast||style=\"width:30%\"|Role\n|-\n| Chow Yun-fat || Lok Chung-hing (駱中興)\n|-\n| Sean Lau || Lam Cho (林祖)\n|-\n| Eddie Kwan (關禮傑) || Hong Kwan (康鈞)\n|-\n| Mini kung (龔慈恩) || Shu Mei (舒薇)\n|-\n| David Lui (呂方) || Wong Tai-kuen (王帝權)\n|-\n| Kenneth Tsang || Luk Hoi (陸海)\n|-\n| Kwan Hoi-san || Tsang Yung (曾翁)\n|-\n| Tai Chi-wai (戴志偉) || Ng Yat-tin (吳日天)\n|-\n| Ko Miu-si (高妙思) || Mang Ha (孟霞)\n|-\n| Michelle Sze-ma (司馬燕) || Simone (曾善美)\n|-\n| Wong Wan-choi (黃允材) || Hong ting-san (康定山)\n|-\n| Lau Miu-ling (劉妙玲) || Man (阿雯)\n|-\n| Danny Poon (潘宏彬) || Lok Chun-wah (駱振華)\n|-\n| Chan On-ying (陳安瑩) || Lok Wan-chi (駱雲芝)\n|-\n| Benz Hui (許紹雄) || Wah Piu (華彪)\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nSee also\n* The Bund (TV series)\n* Chow Yun-fat filmography"
