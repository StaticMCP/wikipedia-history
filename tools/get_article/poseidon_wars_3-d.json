Like all cadets that serve in the U.S. Navy, the ultimate career goal is to be promoted to admiral. Players must go on various tours of duty with a submarine and destroy targets like battleships and anything vital to the enemy's war efforts. Upon completing a certain amount of missions, the player moves up in the Navy rankings.\nIf the player runs out of fuel or gets totally damaged, the mission becomes an immediate failure. In this manner, the fuel acts as a sort of time limit that is realistically indicated in-game.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
