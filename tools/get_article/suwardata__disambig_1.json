Šuwardata was the author of 8 letters to the Egyptian pharaoh.\nSample of Šuwardata's letters\nBesides letters EA 283, and EA 366, (EA for 'el Amarna'), only letter 280 tells of intrigues: See Labaya, or Abdi-Heba, as EA 280 claims: ''\"Moreover, Lab'ayu who used to take our town, is dead, but now [an]other Lab'ayu is 'Abdi-Heba, and he seizes our town.\"\nThe other 5 letters do refer to the following: Qeltu-(Qiltu, Keilah:); silver (as mercenary pay); the Sun, (as Rê); the archer-forces; and the only reference to Rahmanu, an Egyptian official, (letter EA 284, \"The powerful hand of the king\"'').\nEA 283: \"Oh to see the king\"--(no. 6 of 8)\nAll Šuwardata's letters are addressed to the pharaoh.\nŠuwardata must have been an important regional individual, since he claims 30 cities, sub-cities, or city-states have been warring with his city.\nEA 366: \"A rescue operation\"--(no. 8 of 8)\nList of letters\n:#EA 278&mdash;title: \"As ordered (4)\"\n:#EA 279&mdash;title: \"A wasteland\"\n:#EA 280&mdash;title: ''\"Lab'ayu redivivus\"\n:#EA 281&mdash;title: \"Rebellion\"\n:#EA 282&mdash;title: \"Alone\"\n:#EA 283&mdash;title: \"Oh! to see the king.\n:#EA 284&mdash;title: \"The powerful hand of the king\"\nand from the later corpus:\n:#EA 366&mdash;title: \"A rescue operation\"\nSee also\n*Labaya\n*Abdi-Heba, mayor of Uru-salim-Jerusalem\n*Upu - (reference from letter EA 366 ?-(borders))\nExternal links\n*[http://xoomer.alice.it/bxpoma/akkadeng/mesopotamia.htm A minor discussion of \"Šamê\"-(Sky/Heaven): \"dingir A-num AN-e, dingir Anum,  Šamê\"--(the Cuneiform)]; See: Dingir\nReferences\n*Moran, William L.
