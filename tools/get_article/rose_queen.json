Annual civic honorific titles are bestowed by local election to particular individuals, typically local young women.\nHistory\nIt is a late Victorian invention originating from North West England. In the UK it has taken place in Cheshire, Lancashire, Northwich, and Llandudno. In 1928 it was moved to Alexandra Rose Day. In the 20th-century it expanded to Nanterre near Paris.\nIn America, the Rose Queen has been crowned in New York, West Virginia, and Texas Rose Festival.\nToday\nPopularity of the tradition has decreased over the years. Present day Queen of the Rose Parade is crowned at the annual Rose Parade, Pasadena, California, which remains a major event.\nPopular saga author Katie Flynn has written a book titled The Rose Queen with the main characters as subjects of the tradition.\nSee also\n*Milk Queen\n*Rose of Tralee an international pageant\n*Walking day\n*English rose (epithet)\nReferences"
