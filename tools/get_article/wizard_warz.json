(a label of U.S. Gold).\nGameplay\nWizard Warz is a role-playing game with real-time combat. The player is an apprentice wizard whose objective at level 1 is to collect six items by defeating six monsters and return the items to their respective cities. At level 2, the objective is to collect further three magical items. At level 3, the aim is to defeat seven wizards. The spells belong to one of three categories: physical, spiritual and mental. The player has points in each of the categories that are drained by casting the spells.\n| ASM = 8/12\n| CRASH = 70%\n| STAction = 55%\n| Z64 = 30%\n| rev1 =\n| rev1Score = 13/20\n| rev2 = Commodore User\n| rev2Score = 7/10 (C64)40% (Amiga)\n| rev3 =\n| rev3Score = 2.5/5\n}}\nZzap!64 called Wizard Warz \"A very poor interpretation of an excellent concept.\" Commodore User noted it as a good game and recommended it to beginner RPG players. Another reviewer from the magazine said the role-playing aspects are extremely bad and categorized the game as an arcade adventure. ACE called it a standard RPG. ST Action said the most annoying thing about the game is when the player dies, the game has to be rebooted from the desktop.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://amiga.abime.net/games/view/wizard-warz Wizard Warz] at the Hall of Light\n*[https://www.lemon64.com/game/wizard-warz Wizard Warz] at Lemon64\n*[https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/entry/5707/ Wizard Warz] at Spectrum Computing"
