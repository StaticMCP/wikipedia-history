It ended with a decisive victory for the Khurramite forces.\nBackground\nIn the early 9th century, Babak Khorramdin led a rebellion against Abbasid rule in the region of Arran and northwestern Persia. The Abbasid Caliphate sent a large army under the command of Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Tusi to suppress the uprising.\nBattle\nIn 212 AH (827–828 CE), the Caliph sent an army under Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Tusi with orders to punish the rebel Zoraik and subdue Babak. After a brief delay, the general captured Zoraik and dispersed his band of rebels.\nHaving received reinforcements and carefully prepared, Muhammad ibn Humayd advanced against Babak. The campaign lasted six months, during which he won several engagements. However, in the final battle in 214 AH (829 CE), Abbasid forces, advancing three parasangs into the mountains, were ambushed in a steep mountain pass by Babak's men. The Khurramites charged from a higher position, causing the Abbasid troops to flee, leaving only Muhammad ibn Humayd and a few commanders, all of whom were killed.\nAftermath\nThe victory strengthened Babak's position in Arran and surrounding regions. It boosted morale among his followers and delayed Abbasid attempts to fully suppress the rebellion for several years.\nReferences\n*Yusofi, G.
