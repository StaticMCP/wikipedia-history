The minister was punished and his corpse was brought to Tirumangalakudi.  The moment it reached the place, he got his life back due to the effect of the presiding deity.  From then on, the place is believed to provide aegis to Mangalyam.\nAs per another legend, when Navagrahas were cursed to have leprosy by Brahma for relieving a saint from leprosy as they do not have authority to change destiny, Brahma asked them to go to thirumangalakkudi and pray Kol Vinai Theertha Vinayagar (Ganesh who absolved sins of planets) to be absolved from their sins.\nArchitecture\nAround six inscriptions are found in the temple from the Cholas, Pallavas and Vijayanagara kings.
