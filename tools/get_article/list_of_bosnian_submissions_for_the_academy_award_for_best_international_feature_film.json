The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.\nAs of 2025, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been nominated twice, winning once for ''No Man's Land (2001).\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nAll films were primarily in Bosnian. Most Bosnian submissions have been films about life in the country after the Bosnian War of the 1990s, made by young directors: all but Nedžad Begović and Jasmila Žbanić were 41 or younger when their films were made. Black comedies Fuse and Night Guards, and dramas It's Hard to Be Nice, Grbavica, Days and Hours and Snow were all stories about life after the war. While the 1994 selected film, The Awkward Age'', was produced during the war, and tells the story of a Communist-era boarding school. Many Bosnian actors and directors worked on films submitted by Yugoslavia prior to the breakup of the country in 1991.\nDanis Tanović's ''No Man's Land'' and Jasmila Žbanić's Quo Vadis, Aida? are the only Bosnian films nominated. Grbavica, winner of the Golden Bear at the 2006 Berlin International Film Festival, was considered an early favorite but it was not nominated.\nBosnia typically shortlists three films before announcing their candidate. Skies Above the Landscape was short-listed twice (the release date was changed) but failed to be selected both times.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
