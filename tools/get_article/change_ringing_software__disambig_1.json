There are four general types of software used in connection with change ringing: tools for composition, simulation, record keeping, and maintaining up-to-date bell tower directories.\nComposing tools\nThe most common use of software in change ringing is composition proving. This type of software is used to take the tedium out of proving change ringing compositions: that is, checking that no change within the composition is repeated. The software will perform the checks required to prove a composition in milliseconds, rather than the hours or days required for paper based proving methods. Often these programs can also analyse compositions to determine the musical rows that they contain.\nIn recent years, more advanced tools have emerged which can assist the human composer in other ways. These range from pure composition-generation programs such as BYROC and Elf, to more sophisticated programs such as SMC32, which can work alongside the human composer, for instance by linking together existing musical blocks which the composer has created.\nThe main examples of proving software are:\n* [http://www.truepeal.co.uk/ Trident]\n* [http://www.beltower.co.uk/ Beltower]\nSome examples of composition generation tools:\n* [http://www.byroc.org.uk/ BYROC]\n* [http://bronze-age.com/elf/ Elf]\nSimulator\nThe original use of simulators was to allow the practicing of change ringing in the tower, but nowadays is perhaps used more in the home, using a dumbbell or keyboard. Many different scenarios can now be accommodated by the software. Sensors are used to give temporal information to the computer.\n* Single or multiple learner silent practice with computer producing sound of the bell\n* Whole band silent practice with computer producing sound of all the bells\n* Practice on more bells than you have with the computer adding in the extra bells\n* Practice methods that are more advanced that your band is capable with the computer filling in all the bells\nThe main examples of simulator software are:\n* [http://www.abelsim.co.uk/ Abel]\n* [http://www.beltower.co.uk/ Beltower]\n* [http://www.belfryware.com/ Virtual Belfry]\nRecordkeeping\nKeeping records is very important to some change ringers. Records are often kept in the following areas:\n* Grabs (towers visited)\n* Peals\n* Quarter peals\nThe main examples of record keeping software are:\n* [http://www.winrk.co.uk/ WinRK]\n* [http://www.rocketpole.co.uk/ Duco]\nTower directory\nAn up-to-date directory of towers is often used to plan outings and, used in conjunction with the record keeping software to decide what towers still need to be grabbed.\nThe main examples of tower directory software are:\n* [https://www.pealbase.co.uk/towerbase/ TowerBase]\nHistory\nThe earliest known change ringing programs can be traced back to the 1950s. Some of this history is traced in this [http://www.ringing.info/shaggy.html article on software firsts].\nSee also\n*Campanology\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://bellconductor.co.uk/ Bell Conductor] software to help to achieve harmony and melody through visualization of a ringing sequence from text and midi files\n*[http://www.abelsim.co.uk/ \"Abel\"] simulator software\n*[http://www.truepeal.co.uk/ Excalibur] composition proving software"
