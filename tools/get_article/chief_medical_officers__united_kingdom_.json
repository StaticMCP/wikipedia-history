There are four chief medical officers in the United Kingdom who are appointed to advise their respective governments:\n* His Majesty's Government (CMO for England and medical advisor to the United Kingdom government)\n* Scottish Government\n* Welsh Government\n* Northern Ireland Executive\nEach CMO is assisted by one or more deputy chief medical officers, and complemented by a chief nursing officer.\nThe chief medical officer is a qualified medical doctor whose medical speciality traditionally was public health medicine, and whose work focused on the health of communities rather than health of individuals.  More recently, some appointees have been senior clinicians without training in public health medicine. In the UK, the CMO is one of the chief professional officers who advise the government in their respective health and social care disciplines. The CMO has independent statutory authority, first established in the 19th century, to issue reports without requiring government approval.\nChief Medical Officers for England\nThe historic post was created in Victorian times to help to prevent cholera and other epidemics.
