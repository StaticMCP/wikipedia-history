Pelly believed these raids had been orchestrated by the ruler of Bahrain and he resolved the situation by insisting that the rulers of Qatar, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi sign declarations to affirm their commitment to the truce. The Qatari declaration, which was signed by Mohammed bin Thani, principal ruler of the Qatari tribes, was the first recognition of Qatar as independent from Bahrain. Ultimately this treaty became the starting point for the British government’s recognition of Qatar as an independent sovereign state.\nThe Ottomans officially renounced sovereignty over Qatar in 1913. The new ruler Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani signed a treaty with Britain in 1916, thereby instating the area under the trucial system. This meant that Qatar relinquished its autonomy in foreign affairs, such as the power to cede territory, and other affairs, in exchange for Britain's military protection from external threats.\nInitially, the British were reluctant to involve themselves in inland affairs. However, when oil was discovered in the area in the 1930s, the race for oil concessions intensified. In 1938, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company began drilling its first well in Dukhan and a year later, the well-struck oil.\nIn June 2023, the UK announced Qatari citizens will no longer have to apply for a visa to enter the UK, but will be able to obtain an online ETA permit for £10, starting in October 2023.\nwith Qatar’s Prime Ministe Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, 25 January 2024]]\nIn July 2023, the UK’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly visited Doha and held talks with Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. They discussed regional issues and closer cooperation on security, defense and economy.\nDiplomatic representation\nBilateral relations between the two countries have expanded since the opening of the British embassy in Doha in 1949, marked by the arrival of British Political Officer John Wilton. The embassy’s mandate is to develop and maintain relations between the United Kingdom and Qatar, dealing with a range of political, commercial, security and economic questions of interest to both countries. The current UK ambassador to Qatar is .\nQatar has had an embassy in London since 1970, based in Mayfair. The current Qatari ambassador to the UK is Fahad Mohammed Al-Attiyah.\nOn November 6, 2024, King Charles III of the United Kingdom received the credentials of Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Saud Al-Thani as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Qatar to the United Kingdom. The ambassador conveyed the greetings and well-wishes of the Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. In return, King Charles III extended his greetings and best wishes to the Amir and expressed hopes for continued progress and prosperity for Qatar.\nDiplomatic visits\nand foreign minister Khalid Al Attiyah in London in 2013.]]\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron visited Qatar in 2011, and the then Emir of Qatar made a 3-day state visit in October 2010.\nThe current Emir of Qatar made a state visit to the UK in October 2014.\nIn March 2013, Prince Charles and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall, arrived in Qatar for a state visit.\nOn 20 September 2019, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hosted Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani at the Downing Street.

After these forces withdrew, the airbase became home to No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group, the RAF's headquarters for military operations in the Middle East. Since 2014, the airbase has supported Operation Shader, the UK's intervention against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. It has also hosted RAF Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft in support of this operation.\nThe UK and Qatar signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement in November 2014.\nIn February 2014, the Royal Navy warship HMS Monmouth hosted NATO delegates in the port of Doha in Qatar.\nQatari cadets attend the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst each year, and the current Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, is a Sandhurst graduate.\nBritish military also provide officer training to Qatari forces in Qatar.\nIn 2018, the two countries' air forces formed a joint squadron of Eurofighter Typhoons, named No. 12 Squadron RAF, based at RAF Coningsby in England. It was the UK's first joint squadron since World War II. It became operational in December 2020 and was followed by a second joint squadron consisting of BAE Systems Hawk advanced training jets, in addition to RAF aerial refueling support. The UK government announced in April 2021 that it has increased the number of flying hours for RAF pilots and has also invested in new training facilities and infrastructure at RAF Leeming. The success of the 12 Squadron served as an idol for their relationship, which improved Qatar's capacity to address Middle East security issues, promote regional stability, and safeguard UK security. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in his statement, “In order to face off new and emerging threats, it is vital we collaborate with our international allies to tackle our shared security challenges and our long-standing relationship with Qatar exemplifies this. By working together, we continue to share skills and expertise whilst promoting global security and driving prosperity at home. I'm delighted RAF Leeming has been chosen to base the historic second UK-Qatari joint squadron, which recognizes the globally-held high regard of RAF flying training.” Dr Khalid bin Mohamed Al Attiyah, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Defense Affairs in Qatar added that “An important step in the ever-growing military partnership that joins QEAF and RAF, the joint Hawk training squadron is an integral component in increasing interoperability and coordination between both air forces, leading to closer cooperation and alignment in future military and peacekeeping efforts.”\nDuring the state visit of the Amir of Qatar to the United Kingdom in December 2024, the UK and Qatar signed agreements to enhance their defence cooperation. The agreements included expanding collaboration within the joint UK-Qatar Typhoon and Hawk squadrons and knowledge-sharing between the UK Royal Military Police and Qatar’s Amiri Guard Close Protection Unit. The visit took place at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where the Amir, a graduate of the academy, met Qatari cadets and witnessed a fly-past by RAF Typhoon and Hawk aircraft.\nBusiness and investment\nUK Trade and Investment (UKTI) helps UK-based businesses expand in Qatar whilst also aiding Qatari businesses locate and expand in the UK.
