The \"People's Voice\" awards, chosen by online poll, received 100,000 cumulative votes that year.\nThe Web magazine, which was hosting the awards, was closed down by its parent company IDG shortly before the awards, and the ceremony continued thereafter under the management of Tiffany Shlain, who IDG had hired in 1996 to coordinate the awards.  The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences was constituted that year as the judging panel for the awards, continues to do so as of the 2007 awards.\nNominees and winners\nWinners and nominees:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
