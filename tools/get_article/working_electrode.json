The working electrode is often used in conjunction with an auxiliary electrode, and a reference electrode in a three-electrode system.  Depending on whether the reaction on the electrode is a reduction or an oxidation, the working electrode is called cathodic or anodic, respectively.  Common working electrodes can consist of materials ranging from noble metals such as gold or platinum, to inert carbon such as glassy carbon, boron-doped diamond or pyrolytic carbon, and mercury drop and film electrodes. Chemically modified electrodes are employed for the analysis of both organic and inorganic samples.\nSpecial types\n* Ultramicroelectrode (UME)\n* Rotating disk electrode (RDE)\n* Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE)\n* Hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE)\n* Dropping mercury electrode (DME)\nSee also\n* Auxiliary electrode\n* Electrochemical cell\n* Electrochemistry\n* Electrode potential\n* Electrosynthesis\n* Reference electrode\n* Voltammetry\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
