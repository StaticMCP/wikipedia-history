Gordon's status is indicated by Dingley Dell being one of the early local museums in the State and the first associated with a notable individual.  It was opened in 1922.

It was added to the state heritage register on 12 August 2015. Its significance is described in 1983 as follows:The Mount Salt Limestone Track is a rare intact example of a track designed for specific animal-drawn vehicles. There are no known comparable examples in South Australia. The track connected Mount Salt Station with the area's early road network. As with many tracks once in the area, this track originally ran across the ground surface but was later cut through a limestone reef to facilitate efficient and safe travel for people and small loads. The track would have been most important from the 1870s to 1921 as part of a direct route between Mount Salt Station and Mount Schank Station, head station of an enormous pastoral operation. Featuring three linear grooves, the track was designed for use by single animal (or file of animals) drawn cart or buggy. This design is unusual in limiting vehicle types able to use it. The track's design was never updated after 1921, when the State government repurchased most of the land for closer settlement. Intact and largely undisturbed, the track expresses a type of road transport from the era of animal drawn vehicles.\nPine Hall\nThe dwelling described as the ‘Pine Hall’ () is a dwelling located in the gazetted locality of Suttontown. It was added to the state heritage register on 29 June 1989. It was described in 1984 as follows: White painted rock-faced dolomite and painted Mount Gambier limestone dressings. Corrugated galvanized iron hipped roof with single storey concave verandah. Double hung sash windows. Painted dressed stone chimneys. Verandah supported by tapered masonry columns. The front elevation of 'Pine Hall' is two-storey, symmetrical and is of Georgian proportions. Caleb Fidler (1823-1874) and S.T. Webb began their celebrated general store in 1858 in a tiny building on the corner near where Fidler built this house after the business had prospered. By then the store was at its present site in Commercial Street.\nCitations and references\n;Citations\n;References\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.dingleydell.net/ Dingley Dell Cottage website]"
