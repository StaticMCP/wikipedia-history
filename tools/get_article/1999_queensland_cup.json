Redcliffe  Mick Roberts was named the competition's Player of the Year.\nTeams\nThe number of teams in the competition was reduced from 16 to 12 for the 1999 season. Brisbane Brothers, Bundaberg Grizzlies, Gold Coast Vikings and Townsville Stingers were all withdrawn. Brothers and Bundaberg both competed in the inaugural season of the Queensland Cup, while Townsville and the Vikings both played just one season.\nFor the 1999 season, the Brisbane Broncos were affiliated with the Toowoomba Clydesdales, the Melbourne Storm with the Norths Devils and the North Queensland Cowboys with the Cairns Cyclones and Wests Panthers. The Auckland Warriors also used Souths Magpies and Wynnum Seagulls as feeder clubs, sending them up to four players each round.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:60%; text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:white;

Redcliffe, who finished as minor premiers for the first time and earned a first week bye, were forced into a preliminary final with Norths after losing to the Bears. The Dolphins held on for a four-point victory to book their third grand final appearance in five years.\nFirst half\nAfter Burleigh kicked a penalty goal inside the opening minute, it took 20 minutes for the first try of the game to be scored, with Bears' centre Darren Anderson crossing out wide. With six minutes to play in the first half, Dolphins' centre Mixie Lui put his winger Trent Leis into gap to score. Leis missed the ensuing conversion leaving his side trailing by four points at half time.\nSecond half\nRedcliffe opened the second half with a penalty goal from right in front after Burleigh prop Tony Priddle was penalised. 10 minutes later, the Dolphins nabbed their second try when winger Ricky Hewinson scored in the corner, courtesy of a Tony Gould cutout pass. Leis failed to convert but Redcliffe had their first lead, 10–8, with 18 minutes remaining. Burleigh regained the lead shortly after when fullback Jamie Mahon scored what would be the game-winning try. A tense final 10 minutes followed but Burleigh hung on to claim their first premiership in their third season in the Queensland Cup.\nBurleigh winger Aaron Douglas, who was stretchered off during the game, became the first player to win two Queensland Cup grand finals, winning his first with Redcliffe two years earlier.\nPlayer statistics\nLeading try scorers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Pos\n!width=120 |Player\n!Team\n!Tries\n|- bgcolor=\"#d0ffd0\"\n| rowspan = 1 |1||align=\"left\"|Aaron Douglas||align=\"left\"| Burleigh Bears||30\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |2||align=\"left\"|Matt Fisher||align=\"left\"| Wynnum Seagulls||26\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |3||align=\"left\"|Royce Simms||align=\"left\"| Logan Scorpions||17\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |4||align=\"left\"|Heath Egglestone||align=\"left\"| Central Capras||16\n|-\n| rowspan = 4 |5||align=\"left\"|Steven Bell||align=\"left\"| Norths Devils||15\n|-\n|                 align=\"left\"|Trent Clayton||align=\"left\"| Redcliffe Dolphins||15\n|-\n|                 align=\"left\"|Craig Frawley||align=\"left\"| Toowoomba Clydesdales||15\n|-\n|                 align=\"left\"|Jabin Picker||align=\"left\"| Easts Tigers||15\n|}\nLeading point scorers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Pos\n!width=120 |Player\n!Team\n!width=20 |T\n!width=20 |G\n!width=20 |FG\n!width=20 |Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#d0ffd0\"\n| rowspan = 1 |1||align=\"left\"|John Wilshere||align=\"left\"| Norths Devils||8||112||-||256\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |2||align=\"left\"|Ben Lythe||align=\"left\"| Burleigh Bears||4||104||1||225\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |3||align=\"left\"|Mick Roberts||align=\"left\"| Redcliffe Dolphins||9||86||-||208\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |4||align=\"left\"|Chris Lawler||align=\"left\"| Ipswich Jets||10||59||1||159\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |5||align=\"left\"|Scott Thorburn||align=\"left\"| Easts Tigers||6||49||-||122\n|}\nEnd-of-season awards\n* Courier Mail Medal: Mick Roberts ( Redcliffe Dolphins)\n* Rookie of the Year: David Seage ( Wynnum Seagulls)\nSee also\n* Queensland Cup\n* Queensland Rugby League\nReferences"
