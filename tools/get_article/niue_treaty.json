However, a comprehensive Multilateral Subsidiary Agreement (NTMSA)  for strengthening implementation of the Niue Treaty was agreed and finalised for signature in Honiara on 2 November 2012.\nThe first country to sign the NTMSA was the Republic of Palau on 9 November 2012. The Multilateral Subsidiary Agreement needs 4 instruments of ratifications, acceptance or approval to come into force.\nRatifications\nThe treaty was signed by (or on behalf of) 17 states/territories; as of 2013, 14 had ratified the treaty:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
