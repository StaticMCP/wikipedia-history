As the first time that dedicated Canadian television awards had been presented by the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists separately from the inclusion of television films in the Canadian Film Awards program, they were a modest affair, with presentations in just two competitive categories, one for acting and one for journalism, and a lifetime achievement award for contributions to Canadian broadcasting.\nThe program was expanded to seven categories for the 2nd ACTRA Awards in 1973.\nThe ceremony was hosted by Pierre Berton, who was himself the winner of the journalism award.\nWinners and nominees\n{| class=wikitable width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Earle Grey Award\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Gordon Sinclair Award\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Genevieve Bujold\n* Chief Dan George\n* Paul Harding\n* Budd Knapp\n* Gordon Pinsent\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Pierre Berton\n* Peter Gzowski\n* Gerald Pratley\n* Orest Ulan\n* Jack Webster\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | John Drainie Award\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*  Graham Spry\n|}\nReferences"
