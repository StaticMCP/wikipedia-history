Situated in its path are two green areas and several villas built during the Polish interwar period.\nLocation\nEast–west street track extends Krasińskiego Street to the east. It ends while meeting Ossoliński avenue and Piotrowskiego Street at Ossolińskich roundabout.\nHistory\nThe axis has long been visible on Prussian maps of Bydgoszcz, mainly as an eastbound track prolonging Frönerstraße (today's Krasińskiego Street), but was never been associated with a naming.\nThe first city book listing Markwarta street dates back to 1928, associated with the creation of the Sielanka estate (), set north of Markwarta street. In the 1910s, Sielanka area plans, designed as a city-garden, were drawn by German architect Josef Stübben, but due to WWI the project only took off in the 1920s, hence the appearance of Markwarta street on the maps at this time.\nThe street is named after Ryszard Markwart (1868–1906), a Polish priest who was a nationalist activist and head of Bromberg parish from 1899 till his death.\nMain edifices\nSquare of Lieutenant Leszek Biały\nThis green area is part of the Sielanka estate urban plan developed in the 1910s by German architect Josef Stübben. At the time this part of the city had not been touched by urban growth, as Gdańska or Dworcowa streets could have been at the end of the 19th century.\nSielanka project included this square as a property of the Province of Posen () and not owned by the municipality.\nAfter the rebirth of Poland in 1918, the area was declared to be constructed, but no project was ever completed.\nIn the 1960s, a memorial has been built up to celebrate the Millennium of the Polish State (). Designed by Polish artist Stanislaw Lejkowski on July 22, 1967, the entire scheme was never achieved. In 2011, the city had even projects to demolish it, but it turned out to be too expensive.\nThe site has been given the name Lieutenant Leszek Biały in November 2013. Leszek Biały was a hero of the Home Army during the Second World War. Under the code name Jakub, he was arrested in February 1945 by members of soviet controlled Ministry of Public Security and was murdered during interrogations on March 3, 1945. In October 1956, his remains were discovered in the basement of the UB building at Nr.4. A renovated stone memorial to honor Leszek Biały and his heroic comrades has been unveiled in 2013.\nFile:Liceum Ogolnoksztalcace nr VI im Jana i Jedrzeja Sniadeckich 1975.jpg|The square and its monument c. 1975\nFile:Skwer Leszka Białego w Bydgoszczy (3).jpg|The square from the street\nFile:Skwer Leszka Białego w Bydgoszczy (4).jpg|The unachieved monument to the Millennium of the Polish State\nFile:Staszica square Początkowo projekt zakładał umieszczenie między trzema filarami ,wielkiego orła piastowskiego w gnieździe.jpg|Detail of the crown\nFile:Pomnik ppor Leszka Bialego.jpg|Stone memorial to Leszek Biały\nBuilding at 2, corner with 3 Maja Street\n1939\nModern architecture\nThe plot was purchased in 1938 by the Association of the military disabled () and the Association of the Blind Soldiers () of the Republic of Poland, from a German citizen, Mr. Bohm. The ground floor had a large hall and three rooms, while the upper storeys were supposed to house wounded blind soldiers and orphans children from fallen military. The opening ceremony never happened, as it was scheduled on September 3, 1939, on the first days of WII.\nAfter the war, both associations (ZIW and ZOŻ) were dissolved by the communist authorities in 1950: the edifice was transferred to the State Treasury. It is still owned by the municipal council. On April 23, 1994, a commemorative plaque was placed on the building to remember its initial role.\nFile:2 Markwarta.jpg|View from Markwarta street\nMultidisciplinary hospital at 4/6\n1947\nModern architecture\nThe hospital was established on November 7, 1947, as a healthcare institution dedicated to Provincial Office of Public Security, Urząd Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego or UBP: initially, it consisted of a building at Nr.6 and two floors of the abutting building at Nr.4 where was located Bydgoszcz UBP at the time. In the years 1966–1967, a link was built between the Nr. 4 and 6. After the expansion of the late 1980s, the hospital had 127 beds.\nIt provided medical care for the benefit of the Ministry of Interior employees until 1990. Since the fall of communism, it provides services to all patients without any professional restrictions. Today the facility provides medical services in the field of basic health care, such as Dental and Oral Medicine, rehabilitation, occupational medicine, laboratory diagnosis and medical imaging.\nThe dark past of Nr.4 as UBP building has been highlighted in 2019, by the uncovering of a memorial plaque.\nFile:Szpital MSW Bydgoszcz.JPG|View from the street\nVilla at 2 Kasprowicza street, corner with Markwarta street\n1927–1930, by Bronisław Jankowski\nPolish national style\nTeodor Krüger, an engineer, was the first owner of this house. He did not live there, but at Krasińskiego Street 4. Today, the villa houses the Polish Foundation for the Protection of Water Resources ().\nMain highlight of the edifice is the facade on Markwarta, which bears an avant-corps supported by columns, topped by a balcony fenced with a balustrade.\nFile:Markwarta 5 2.jpg|View from Markwarta street\nFile:Markwarta 5 villa.jpg|View from Kasprowicza street\nFile:Bdg IzbaGosp Wodociagi Polskie3 4-2015.jpg|Main elevation\nFile:Bdg IzbaGosp Wodociagi Polskie1 4-2015.jpg|Balcony adornment\nLudowy Park\n6,42 ha\n1953\nThe park is located between the streets Jagiellońska, Piotrowski and Markwart, on a 250 by 275 m area mainly lying in the back of the Youth Palace. It was named in memoriam of Wincenty Witos.\nLudowy Park (''People's Park'') was founded at the place of an ancient cemetery, dating back to 1778, the oldest and largest in the city. In 1838 was built a house for the administrator, with a separate room for the morgue. In 1884, a cemetery was erected and in 1898 a massive brick fence, which survived after the liquidation of the cemetery.\nEntrance was made through two wrought iron gates to Markwart street, leading to the chapel located in the middle of the graveyard. A large square with outgoing path, like spokes, divided the cemetery into quarters. A lot of different trees were growing there: oak, chestnut, European beech, downy oak, sessile oak, oak red, locust, birch, lime, common spruce, prickly spruce and white spruce, and near the house were 10 Catalpa bignonioides. In 1938, 66 species of trees and shrubs were growing in the cemetery where a majority of German tombs could be found.\nAfter Bydgoszcz's liberation in 1945, the old cemetery was closed and transferred to the Lutheran cemetery in Zaświat Street. The liquidation of the ancient graveyard was carried out in 1951–1952, the last bone exhumation to Zaświat street was held in 1956. Many tombstones have been destroyed during the liquidation, along with sculptures, reliefs and catacombs. It has been the case for some famous people's tombstones:\n* Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Younger (1775–1843);\n* Carl and William Blumwe, owners of Factory of Machine Tools, where a copy of the sculpture of \"Christ the Saviour\" by Bertel Thorvaldsen was standing. This sculpture has been moved to the square by the Lutheran Church of the Savior in Bydgoszcz, it is today one of the most impressive religious monuments in the city.\nOnce the cemetery liquidated, a city park, named \"People's Park\" (), has been set up on the very place, using part of the remaining elements of the gone necropolis.\nIn 1956, a concert shell  has been erected with a capacity of 5000 people. This building replaced the amphitheatre erected in 1946 in Park Casimir the Great. In addition to the concert shell, three blocks of flats on the western edge of the park, and pavilions in the east were constructed. In 1974, at the southern edge of the park has been built the \"Youth Palace\". On June 3, 1984, at the initiative of People's Party, the park has been given the name of Wincenty Witos: his bust has been realised by Witold Marciniak and funded by Bydgoszcz Voivodeship's Polish People's Party. Between the monument and the concert shell, a round pool with a gushing summer fountain has been built.\nIn 2007 have been performed renovations of parkways, concert shell and park greenery. On April 24, 2007, a black granite obelisk commemorating the existence of the old cemetery has been unveiled in the south-east corner of the park, bearing the inscription:\n\"In Binding Memory of the former Protestant cemetery.City of BydgoszczLutheran Parish of BydgoszczBydgoszcz 2007\"\nSince 2018, a heavy revitalisation of the park is in progress, it will end in November 2019.\nFile:1914 STADT BROMBERG park ludowy.jpg|1914 Map of Bromberg with the Lutheran cemetery (Evang.
