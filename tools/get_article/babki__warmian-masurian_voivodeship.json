It lies approximately  south-east of Gołdap and  east of the regional capital Olsztyn. It is located in the historic region of Masuria.\nHistory\nIn the past, the territory was at various times part of Poland, Prussia and Germany. In 1938, the Nazi government of Germany renamed the village to Steinbrück to erase traces of Polish origin. In 1945, following Germany's defeat in World War II, the region became again part of Poland and the historic name of the village was restored.\nTransport\nThe Polish National road 65 runs nearby, west of the village.\nReferences"
