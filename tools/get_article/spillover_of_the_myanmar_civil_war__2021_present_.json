Refugees and junta officials have fled into Bangladesh, India and Thailand. Territorial violations of Bangladeshi territory, such as artillery strikes and firing at vessels near St. Martin's Island, have caused border tensions. In India, the conflict also contributed to the 2023–2024 Manipur violence.\nBangladesh\nThe spillover of the Myanmar civil war has particularly been a cause of concern to Bangladesh. Beyond the influx of refugees from renewed violence on the border, the rise of the non-state actor Arakan Army created concerns about Rohingya repatriation.\nBackground\nThe Rohingya genocide led to around 1 million Rohingya refugees fleeing to Bangladesh. In the first week of September 2020, Bangladeshi forces reported that the Tatmadaw started amassing troops and doing unusual buildups in three different locations on the Bangladesh–Myanmar border. As a consequence, Bangladesh's foreign minister summoned Myanmar's ambassador, calling for him to desist from such activities and to work for mutually beneficial relations between the two countries. Bangladesh stated that was ready to face any situation, deploying the 34 Border Guard Bangladesh battalion on the border with Myanmar. This battalion asked their counterparts to arrange a flag meeting but received no response.\nHistory\nMultiple Tatmadaw artillery strikes have accidentally ended up in Bangladesh territory over the course of the war.\nIn August 2022, Bangladesh strongly protested territorial violations when two Myanmar Army mortar shells hit a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh and when a junta helicopter entered Bangladeshi airspace and fired a shell. Aung Kyaw Moe, the ambassador of Myanmar to Bangladesh, was summoned by the Bangladesh ministry of foreign affairs four times in 2022 due to multiple violations of Bangladesh's airspace in the Naikhongchhari border area by the Myanmar Army.\nOn 3 February 2024, intensifying clashes between the Arakan Army and Tatmadaw in Rakhine state led to mortar shells and bullets landing in Bangladesh, injuring civilians and prompting local villagers to flee. Bangladeshi authorities closed schools and madrasas in border villages. As tensions increased, Bangladesh strengthened the Bangladesh Police and Bangladesh Coast Guard to be stationed to resist any intrusion through the borders. Three hundred and twenty-seven Myanmar Border Guard Police personnel sought refuge in Bangladesh, where they were disarmed and sheltered by the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB). Two days later, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina instructed the Bangladesh Armed Forces and BGB to have patience regarding the situation in Myanmar. On 7 February BGB Director Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Siddiqui recommended suspending the naval route to St. Martin's Island in Bangladesh due to the increasing border tensions, accordingly, sea travel to St. Martin's Island is indefinitely closed down by the district administration of Cox's Bazar from 10 February. On 8 February 2024, the Tatmadaw agreed to send a ship to take back the stranded BGP personnel in Bangladesh.\nOn 9 December 2024, Arakan Army captured all of the Burmese military outposts and seized control of the Myanmar's entire border with Bangladesh. With this victory, the AA now controls all three Burmese townships bordering Bangladesh: Maungdaw, Buthidaung, and Paletwa. In the aftermath of the Maungdaw battle, the AA arrested Brigadier General Thurein Tun and approximately 80 Rohingya militants.\nTwan Mrat Naing claimed in an interview with The Irrawaddy that AA has proof ARSA and the RSO coordinated with officers in the Bangladesh Armed Forces to attack positions in Maungdaw Township on 18 September 2025. The Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) further denied this claim and termed it as \"misleading\".\nSt. Martin Crisis\nDuring June 2024, Myanmar Navy vessels reportedly fired at boats traveling near St. Martin's Island. However, it soon became unclear whether the shots came from Arakan Army or the Myanmar military. Due to the firing, the island's population faces a food shortage.\nIndia\nThe renewed ethnic conflict, particularly in Chin state, has fueled the displacement of many into India. On 22 September 2021, after the Battle of Thantlang, nearly 8,000 residents of Thantlang, Chin state, fled to Mizoram, India after houses were set ablaze by the junta army.\nOn January 10 and 12, 2023, Myanmar Air Force carried out airstrikes with one Yak-130 and two MiG-29 targeting Camp Victoria, the Chin National Army (CNA)'s headquarters, near the India-Myanmar border. Five CNA soldiers were killed, at least 10 were injured and some buildings were damaged. The air attacks violated Indian airspace and soil, according to the CNF, local Mizo organizations, and the international research and advocacy organization Fortify Rights. The Chin Human Rights Organization (CHRO) states that at least 200 Chin refugees crossed the border later the week following the airstrikes by Myanmar Army.\nLater in March 2023, the Chinland Defence Force of Matupi engaged in attacks near Paletwa Township. CDF Paletwa assured that on 15 March 2023, Assam Rifles entered Paletwa township and fired gunshots. However, the Assam Rifles denied, saying its soldiers were engaged in “routine border point verification  inside the Indian territory.\"\n, Chin State]]\nOn 14 November 2023, the CNA and local CDF forces attacked the Myanmar Army's border guard outpost in Rikhawdar, Falam Township, a hub for border trade with India. The junta responded with air assaults using a jet fighter, to flee into Mizoram, India. A total of 43 Myanmar Army soldiers crossed the India-Myanmar border and sought refuge from the Indian police. They were handed to the Myanmar officials by the Indian authorities through the Moreh-Tamu border. Two days later, residents who had fled to India returned.\nIn late December 2023 and January 2024, fierce fighting in the Rakhine offensive (2023-present), 276 Myanmar army soldiers, with their arms, entered India surrendering to Indian authorities. Because of the influx of refugees and junta soldiers, the Indian government decided to fence the  border with Myanmar,.\nOn 13 July 2025, ULFA(I) claimed that the Indian Army launched drone attacks on camps shared by the group and NSCN(K) in Sagaing Region. Indian officials denied knowledge of any cross-border operations recently targeting ULFA(I).\nOn 17 July 2025, high-ranking members of the Chin Brotherhood Mara Defence Force, were arrested in Mizoram by a joint police-Assam Rifles task force. Body armor, helmets, and .22 Long Rifle rounds were seized.\nImpact on Manipuri conflict\nAnalysts cite the Myanmar civil war as one of many instigating factors for the increased ethnic violence in Manipur, a state plagued with insurgency for a long time, with Naga Christian insurgents based in the hills  targeting the Meitei Hindu majority concentrated in the Imphal valley. Drug trafficking and the junta's use of aerial bombing and napalm has destabilized the border region.\nIndia expressed its concern to the junta about its military actions near its sensitive northeastern region in the wake of a massive exodus of refugees into India. In July 2023, there were an estimated 50,000 refugees who had fled to India. These refugees reportedly include many ex-security forces. Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah stated that the mass influx of Christian Kuki people from Myanmar created fears of demographic change amongst the Meitei Hindus and triggered the violence. According to ground reports, many refugees also brought arms with them and instigated drug turf wars.\nWhile the Myanmar refugees are given familial treatment with compassion to take shelter by the state government of Mizoram, the Manipur government's view on the matter is somewhat divergent. The Zo-Kuki demographic dominates Manipur's Churachandpur district which borders the state of Mizoram, and the dominant Mizos have strong ethnic relations with each other and with the Kukis of Myanmar. While Chief Minister Zoramthanga of Mizoram, under his governance, showed a sense of compassion towards refugees including ex-forces of Myanmar, at least some Zo-Kuki in Manipur are not happy with the attitude of Manipur government, under the leadership of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, towards them who are, if not together, in the proximity of Myanmar immigrants.\nOn 14 May 2025, the Assam Rifles under the Eastern Command of the Indian Army shot and killed 10 insurgents in the Chandel District of Manipur.  Burmese anti-junta officials confirmed that they were part of a  unit (PDO) from Tamu, Sagaing Region. While India claims that the PDO fighters fired first, anti-junta officials claimed they were tortured. The bodies were returned after negotiations with the Indian government, but cross-border anxieties flared up.\nThailand\nOn 5 April 2024, the junta garrison in Myawaddy surrendered to the KNLA, allowing anti-junta forces to take the border town. During the capture of Myawaddy, certain junta officials fled into Thailand. The junta requested Thailand for a military flight from Mae Sot to evacuate said officials and others awaiting refuge on the border.\nThe conflict has also contributed to a rise in malaria along the Myanmar–Thailand border.\nOn 30 November 2024, the Myanmar Navy opened fire on Thai fishing boats after allegedly intruding on Myanmar waters. One fisherman drowned, two were injured, and 31 crew members were detained.\nSee also\n* Foreign involvement in the Myanmar civil war (2021–present)\nReferences"
