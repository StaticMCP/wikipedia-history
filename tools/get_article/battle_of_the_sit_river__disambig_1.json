It was fought in the northern part of the present-day Sonkovsky District of Tver Oblast of Russia, close to the selo of Bozhonka.\nBattle\nAfter the Mongols sacked his capital of Vladimir on the Klyazma, Yuri fled across the Volga northward, to Yaroslavl, where he hastily mustered an army. He and his brothers then turned back toward Vladimir in hopes of relieving the city before the Mongols took it, but they were too late. Yuri sent out a force of 3,000 men under Dorozh to scout out where the Mongols were; whereupon Dorozh returned saying that Yuri and his force were already surrounded. As he tried to muster his forces, he was attacked by the Mongol force under Burundai and fled, but was overtaken on the Sit River and died there along with his nephew, Prince Vsevolod of Yaroslavl.\nAftermath\nThe battle marked the end of unified resistance against the Mongols, and inaugurated two centuries of the Mongol domination of Russia.\nReferences"
