It includes a bonus DVD containing videos for the songs \"City 2 City\", \"Livin' Proof\", \"Think 4 Yourself\", and others that not only include the Kottonmouth Kings, but also that of their newly signed labelmates. The album title was thought up by band member Pakelika. It is meant to show that it is their ninth official album and also referred to the so-called \"greatness of being high with the heavens\". (From informal English: to be on cloud nine - to be extremely happy)\nAs of the week of September 15, 2007 the album debuted at number 44 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling about 14,000 copies in its first week, #10 on the Billboards Top Rap Albums, and #3 on the Top Independent Albums chart.
