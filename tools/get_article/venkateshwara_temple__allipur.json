The temple is dedicated to promoting the Hindu religion and serving the community of Allipur and surrounding villages in the region.\nHistory of the temple and region\nThe history of the temple and the region was well captured in a letter written by Jaisetty Ramanaiah, an eminent historian from this region who had also published books on the architecture and temples of the region. Below historical details are observations in the letter.\nLegend\nThe local legend is that Lord Sri Rama had a sojourn here when he was passing through Dandakaranya. in Threthayuga.  The presence of nearby village named Ayodhya, has been considered as a testimonial for it\nMedieval history\nAllipur and its vicinity has historical significance for the past thousand years. A Chalukyan Trikuta Temple at Raikal, built during the 11th century is located only 10&nbsp;km from Allipur. The Dubba Rajeshwara Swamy temple at Konapur is located 6&nbsp;km to the east and very near to it  is Pulastheswara temple at Polasa, where an inscription on a stone pillar was  perched by King Medha Raja the first in1108 AD.  The worship of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu was prevalent in the region including at Allipur.\nA deity of Vaishnava cult was noticed on a big rock lying  on a mound in a field adjacent to the cart-track leading from Allipur to Jagtial. A large number of people including the local villagers have been worshipping this Vishnu deity performing several rituals. The sthala purana states that the sacred rock with the deity was surrounded by a forest and that the saints and sages worshipped this deity; their puranic stories are still revealed by the local villagers. The present day temple was built to provide shelter to this sacred shrine.\nConsecration\nThe Prana Prathista of the temple was held on May 14, 2001. The vigrahams of  Venkateshwa Swamy, Padmavati and Andal were acquired from Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams (TTD). The stone idol of main deity is over 4 ft tall.\nA decade later (in 2012), two more shrines were added to the  premises, dedicated to Laxmi Ganapati and Abaya Anjaneya Swamy.\nSee also\n* Temple of Telangana\nReferences"
