When the AFI launched the Academy in 2011, it changed the annual ceremony to the AACTA Awards, with the award being a continuum of the AFI Byron Kennedy Award.\nOn the 10th anniversary of the establishment of AACTA in 2020, the Byron Kennedy Award was selected to celebrate low-budget independent films. As the nominees were announced, AACTA wrote that the award would \"recognise an Australian film that illustrates the resourcefulness, inventiveness, originality and excellence that Byron Kennedy embodied through his genre-defining work with George Miller on Mad Max\".\nDescription\nThe Byron Kennedy Award is presented by the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA), a non-profit organisation whose aim is \"to identify, award, promote and celebrate Australia's greatest achievements in film and television.\"\nIt recognises a person in their early career for \"outstanding creative enterprise within the film and television industries... whose work embodies the qualities of Byron Kennedy: innovation, vision and the relentless pursuit of excellence.\" Recommendations for recipients are made by the general public, but the AFI and Academy may also select further candidates without the need for an entry. The award includes a A$10,000 cash prize. It may be awarded to makers of film or television shows.\nThe award is presented at the annual AACTA Awards Ceremony, which hand out accolades for technical achievements in feature film, television, documentaries, and short films.\nRecipients\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"60%\" align=\"centre\"\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\"| Year\n! width=\"15%\" style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\"| Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\"| Notes\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref(s)\n|-\n| 1984\n|\n| \"for his innovative and pioneering work in film and television sound.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1985\n|\n| \"for his unorthodox and comprehensive contribution to the film industry.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1986\n|  and\n| \"for their fiercely independent approach to filmmaking.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1987\n|\n| \"for her uncompromising use of film as a vehicle for consciousness- raising and her consistent help to filmmakers at the beginning of their careers.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1988\n|\n| \"for the profound wisdom of his work in theatre, film, television and ballet, and his highly influential workshops on ensemble performance.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1989\n|\n| \"for her innovative, highly individual and uncompromising work in writing, producing and directing a body of outstanding films and television programmes which have gained recognition both in Australia and overseas.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1990\n|\n| \"for his consistent innovation as an artist in the field of documentary.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1991\n|\n| \"for an impressive and original body of work both as writer and director, and through that work, his discovery and encouragement of new talent.\"\n|\n|-\n| 1992\n|  and\n| \"whose films are not only fine documentaries - they are great human dramas.
