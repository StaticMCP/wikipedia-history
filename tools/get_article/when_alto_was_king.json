      "text": "# When Alto Was King\n\nWhen Alto Was King is the final album recorded by American saxophonist C. I. Williams released in 1997 on the Mapleshade label a quarter century after his previous album.\nReception\n}}\nAllMusic awarded the album 4 stars stating \"this superb-sounding album is a fitting showcase for Williams' alto talents\". In JazzTimes Willard Jenkins wrote \"Mr. Williams has a buttery tone that is delivered with authority and the veteran's sense of relaxed swing. His tone bending, for example, is done very subtly and with a knowingness that never announces the arrival of the next bended note. He plays it with a liquidity and fluid sense of phrasing that makes every piece a study in elegance\".\nTrack listing\nAll compositions by C. I.
