It comprises 32 chapters, most of which pertain to the sciences, including astronomy, botany, chemistry, geology, geography, mathematics, mechanics, medicine, meteorology, physics, and zoology. Conversely, only two chapters are about philosophy.\nReception\nScience reviewer Frederick E. Brasch concluded that the book was a \"decidedly useful compendium of scientific, technical and philosophical knowledge of the eighteenth century\" but criticised its index and table of contents. Writing in The American Historical Review, Frederick Barry described Wolf's work as \"readable\" and \"interesting\". The American Journal of Psychology reviewer E. G. Boring called the book a \"masterpiece of erudition\". Tenney L. Davis, in the Journal of Chemical Education, called the book \"truly encyclopedic in scope\", but specifically criticised it for not having a \"satisfying\" account of chemistry in the eighteenth century.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
