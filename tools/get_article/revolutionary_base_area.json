To overcome a lack of supplies, revolutionaries in a base area may storm isolated outposts or other vulnerable supply caches controlled by the forces of an opponent.\nRevolutionary base areas in China\nCultural policies\nIn 1940, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued its Instruction on Developing Cultural Movements, instructing that in \"every large base area, a complete printing factory should be established. Existing printing factories should strive for improvement and expansion. The construction of a printing factory should be regarded as more important than building an army of ten thousand or even more. It's crucial to organize the distribution of newspapers, periodicals, and books, have specialized transport organizations and protective troops, and consider transporting cultural sustenance as important as transporting clothes and ammunition.\"\nFeminist policies\nIn February 1943, the Communist Party issued its ''Decision of the Central Committee Concerning the Present Direction of Women's Work in Anti-Japanese Base Areas. The Decision contended that efforts to mobilize women had been lacking in \"mass perspective\" and it was necessary to organize women in cooperative groups to effectively mobilize their labor power. Establishing small cooperative weaving groups outside the home was a significant emphasis.\nSee also\n* Jiangxi Soviet\n* Red corridor\n* On Protracted War''\n* Ho Chi Minh trail\n* Yan'an Soviet\n* Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region\n* Communist-controlled China (1927–1949)\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.marx2mao.com/Mao/PSGW38.html#c6 Mao Zedong: The Establishment of Base Areas]\n* [https://lesmaterialistes.com/english/communist-party-peru-line-construction-three-instruments-revolution Communist Party of Peru: Line of construction of the three instruments of the revolution]\n* [https://bannedthought.net/India/CPI-Maoist-Docs/Interviews/Kishanji-091024.pdf Kishanji: To establish a liberated area]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110404171312/http://en.hnta.cn/Htmls/Scenic/Scenic_284.shtml Museum of Revolutionary Base, Henan province]\n* ."
