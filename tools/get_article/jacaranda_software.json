It was based in Brisbane, Australia and published under the leadership of John Collins. The team worked as a department of Jacaranda-Wiley; the Australian imprint of American publishing company, Wiley. While it was considered initially as an experimental venture, it proved to be profitable from its first year through to its closure in the early 1990s. Jacaranda Software released titles for a range of computer systems, including the Apple II, Commodore 64, Macintosh, Microbee and BBC Micro.\nAfter the department closed, former employees David Smith, Bruce Mitchell, and Steve Luckett continued to write software for schools, under the name Greygum Software. They bought remaining stock, rights, and equipment from Jacaranda. Popular Jacaranda titles included Goldfields, Kraken: a deep sea quest, Desert Quest and Crossing the Mountains.\nGreygum Software closed in 2018 due to the retirement of its owners.\nReleases\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
