It was released on Federal Records as the B-side of the group's single \"Pedal Pushin' Papa\". It was a bigger hit than the A-side, reaching #3 on the R&B chart. (\"Pedal Pushin' Papa\" charted #4 R&B.)\nJames Brown version\n\"The Bells\" played an important part in the early careers of James Brown and The Famous Flames. In their performances on the Chitlin' Circuit the group would act out the story of bereavement told in the lyrics, pushing a doll representing the dead woman across the stage in a baby carriage. As they passed Brown, he would fall to his knees crying and sobbing, eventually segueing into \"Please, Please, Please\". The routine was so popular that audiences sometimes became violent if they tried to perform the song without it.\nBrown recorded \"The Bells\" in 1960 as his first single for King Records. It reached number&nbsp;68 on the Billboard pop chart.\nReferences"
