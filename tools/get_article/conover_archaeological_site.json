It is one of the few sites in Virginia which is documented to date to c. 9500 BCE. The large number of stone artifacts found at this site, including tools for working stone and stone tool manufacturing byproducts, suggest this site was used as a quarry or maintenance site by paleo-Indians.\nThe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\nSee also\n*Nottoway Archeological Site\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Dinwiddie County, Virginia\nReferences"
