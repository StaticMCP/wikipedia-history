Produced by Cineflix Productions, the film stars Dascha Polanco as Marcela Borges, with supporting performances from Johnathan Sousa, Nisa Gunduz, and Alessio Andrada. It premiered on the Lifetime network on January 11, 2025, as part of the channel’s \"Ripped from the Headlines\" slate of original films.\nThe film dramatizes the real-life event of Marcela Borges, a Florida mother who was held captive for two days in 2009 when armed intruders broke into her Winter Garden home. Borges was terrorized alongside her children and forced to comply with her kidnappers before ultimately making a daring escape. The Lifetime adaptation emphasizes both the trauma of the crime and Borges’ resilience, portraying her as a survivor whose courage and quick thinking saved her family.\nFollowing its television premiere, the film became available for streaming on Netflix in September 2025.\nReferences"
