In the finals, they defeated Burleigh in the major semi final to book a spot in their first Grand Final. Defending premiers Burleigh, who finished the season in 3rd, defeated Norths in the Week 1 qualifying final to set up a contest with the Young Guns. After losing, the Bears hosted Redcliffe, defeating them 24–19 and qualifying for their third straight Grand Final.\nFirst half\nThe Young Guns opened the scoring in the 8th minute, when Neil Sweeney kicked a penalty goal after prop Jaiman Lowe was taken high by Bears' second rower Adam Hutchison. Seven minutes later, North Queensland recorded the first try of the game when centre David Myles sliced through some soft defence to score. They extended their lead to 12–0 when five-eighth Shane Muspratt burrowed over from dummy half to score. In the 28th minute, Burleigh finally got on the board thanks to a long range try to former North Queensland Cowboy Trent Leis. Two minutes before half time, the Young Guns extended their lead to 12 when Neil Sweeney scored under the posts thanks to a Brent McConnell line break.\nSecond half\nThe second half was scoreless until the final 10 minutes, when the Young Guns ran in three unanswered tries on their way to their first premiership. In the 70th minute, hooker Clint Amos dived over from dummy half, pushing the lead to 18. From the set following the kick off, captain Daniel Strickland burst through the Bears' defensive line and sent fullback Jason Barsley away to score under the posts. Finally, in the 76th minute, a McConnell chip kick was regathered by Muspratt, who kept it alive, with the ball going through five sets of hands before Myles finished the play for his second try. The win marked the first time a team from outside of south east Queensland would win the Grand Final.\nThree players from the victorious Young Guns' side, Gavin Cooper, Matthew Scott and Scott Bolton, would go on to become club legends for the North Queensland Cowboys, with all three winning an NRL premiership with the club in 2015.\nPlayer statistics\nLeading try scorers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Pos\n!width=120 |Player\n!Team\n!Tries\n|- bgcolor=\"#d0ffd0\"\n| rowspan = 1 |1||align=\"left\"|Simon Phillips||align=\"left\"| Wynnum Seagulls||19\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |2||align=\"left\"|Greg Inglis||align=\"left\"| Norths Devils||18\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |3||align=\"left\"|Tony Duggan||align=\"left\"| Toowoomba Clydesdales||16\n|-\n| rowspan = 3 |4||align=\"left\"|Trent Leis||align=\"left\"| Burleigh Bears||15\n|-\n|                 align=\"left\"|Damien Quinn||align=\"left\"| Wynnum Seagulls||15\n|-\n|                 align=\"left\"|David Strachan||align=\"left\"| Tweed Heads Seagulls||15\n|}\nLeading point scorers\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Pos\n!width=120 |Player\n!Team\n!width=20 |T\n!width=20 |G\n!width=20 |FG\n!width=20 |Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#d0ffd0\"\n| rowspan = 1 |1||align=\"left\"|Reggie Cressbrook||align=\"left\"| Burleigh Bears||14||75||-||206\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |2||align=\"left\"|Greg Bourke||align=\"left\"| Redcliffe Dolphins||6||72||-||168\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |3||align=\"left\"|Damien Quinn||align=\"left\"| Wynnum Seagulls||15||50||-||160\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |4||align=\"left\"|Nick Parfitt||align=\"left\"| Toowoomba Clydesdales||12||55||-||158\n|-\n| rowspan = 1 |5||align=\"left\"|Greg Inglis||align=\"left\"| Norths Devils||18||39||-||150\n|}\nEnd-of-season awards\n* Courier Mail Medal: Greg Inglis ( Norths Devils)\n* Coach of the Year: Wayne Treleaven ( Norths Devils)\n* Rookie of the Year: Wayne Bond ( Redcliffe Dolphins)\n* Representative Player of the Year: Nathan Friend ( Queensland Residents,  Norths Devils)\nSee also\n* Queensland Cup\n* Queensland Rugby League\nReferences"
