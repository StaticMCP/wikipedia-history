The Fazakerley East ward was created as a single-member ward from the eastern half of the former Fazakerley ward.\nThe ward boundaries follow the Kirkby branch of the Northern Line, Longmoor Lane, Lower Lane, the East Lancashire Road, Knowsley Book, the River Alt, Bridgehouse Lane, Aintree Lane and Sherwood's Lane.\nThe population of the ward at the 2021 census was 5,916.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Frazer Lake (Lab)\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Debbie Cooke (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nNotes\na.
