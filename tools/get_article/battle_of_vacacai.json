However, col. Lavalle, with a 700 strong cavalry force, came to help the republicans, to which Lt. Amaral decided to withdraw and join forces with his commander, the Major Gabriel Gomes Lisboa, that only had 200 militiamen under his command. Still unable to fight Lavalle, Lisboa continued the retreat until he met Col. Bento Manuel Ribeiro, head of the brigade to which Lisboa belonged. In this retreat the imperials had two killed and three wounded. Lavalle backed away as soon as he saw Bento Manuel's column.\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160207192047/http://www.funag.gov.br/biblioteca/dmdocuments/VI_EFEMERIDES-BRASILEIRAS-CORRIGIDO.pdf Brazilian ephemerides by the Baron of Rio Branco]\n* [https://www.todo-argentina.net/historia-argentina/unitarios-y-federales/guerra-brasil/bacacay.php?idpagina=587 Todo Argentina - Batalla de Bacacay]"
