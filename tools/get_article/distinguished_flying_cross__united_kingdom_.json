It was originally awarded to RAF commissioned and warrant officers, including officers in Commonwealth and allied forces. In March 1941 eligibility was extended to Naval Officers of the Fleet Air Arm, and in November 1942 to Army officers, including Royal Artillery officers serving on attachment to the RAF as pilots-cum-artillery observers. Posthumous awards were permitted from 1979.\nSince the 1993 review of the honours system as part of the drive to remove distinctions of rank in bravery awards, all ranks of all arms of the Armed Forces have been eligible, and the Distinguished Flying Medal, which had until then been awarded to other ranks, was discontinued. While remaining a reward for \"flying in active operations against the enemy\", the requirement was changed from \"valour, courage or devotion to duty\" to \"exemplary gallantry\".\nThe DFC had also been awarded by Commonwealth countries but by the 1990s most, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, had established their own honours systems and no longer recommended British honours.\nThe DFC now serves as the third-level award for all ranks of the British Armed Forces for exemplary gallantry in active operations against the enemy in the air, not to the standard required to receive the Victoria Cross or the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross. Apart from honorary awards to those serving with allied forces, all awards of the DFC are announced in the London Gazette.\nA bar is added to the ribbon for holders of the DFC who received a further award, with a silver rosette worn on the ribbon when worn alone to denote the award of each bar.\nRecipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters \"DFC\".\nDescription\nThe decoration, designed by Edward Carter Preston, is a cross flory,  wide. The horizontal and bottom bars are terminated with bumps, the upper bar with a rose. The decoration's face features aeroplane propellers, superimposed on the vertical arms of the cross, and wings on the horizontal arms. In the centre is a laurel wreath around the RAF monogram, surmounted by a heraldic Imperial Crown.\nThe reverse is plain, except for a central roundel bearing the reigning monarch's cypher and the date '1918'. Originally awarded unnamed, from 1939 the year of issue was engraved on the reverse lower limb of cross, and since 1984 it has been awarded named to the recipient.\nThe suspender is straight and decorated with laurel wreaths.\nThe ribbon bar denoting a further award is silver, with the Royal Air Force eagle in its centre. Bars awarded during World War II have the year of award engraved on the reverse.\nThe 1.25-inch (32&nbsp;mm) ribbon was originally white with deep purple broad horizontal stripes, but it was changed in 1919 to the current white with purple broad diagonal stripes.\n{|align=center class=wikitable width=60%\n!colspan=4|Distinguished Flying Cross ribbon bars\n|-\n!width=15% valign=center align=center|\n!width=20% valign=center align=center|DFC\n!width=20% valign=center align=center|DFC and Bar\n!width=20% valign=center align=center|DFC and Two Bars\n|-\n!width=15% valign=center align=center|1918–1919\n|width=20% valign=center align=center|\n|width=20% valign=center align=center|\n|width=20% valign=center align=center|\n|-\n!width=15% valign=center align=center|since 1919\n|width=20% valign=center align=center|\n|width=20% valign=center align=center|\n|width=20% valign=center align=center|\n|-\n|}\nRecipients\nNumbers awarded\nFrom 1918 to 2017 approximately 22,322 Distinguished Flying Crosses and 1,737 bars have been awarded.
