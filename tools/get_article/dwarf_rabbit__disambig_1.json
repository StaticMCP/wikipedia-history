Dwarfism is a genetic condition that may occur in humans and in many animals, including rabbits. True dwarfism is often associated with a cluster of physical abnormalities, including pituitary dwarfism. The process of dwarfing is used to selectively breed for smaller stature with each generation. Small stature is a characteristic of neoteny, which may account (in part) for the attraction of dwarf animals.\nSmall rabbits\nThe Netherland Dwarf is the smallest of the domestic rabbits. The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) accepts a weight range of , but  is the maximum allowed by the British Rabbit Council (BRC). The small stature of the Netherland Dwarf was initially the result of the dwarfing gene: dw. Its short neck and rounded face are additional features of neoteny.\nMany small rabbit breeds have the dwarfing gene, but the Polish and the Britannia Petite are among those that do not. They have attained their small stature solely through selective breeding of successively smaller generations (a process called dwarfing).\nSome small rabbits (often mixed breeds) are a false dwarf, a rabbit that did not inherit the dwarfing gene.\nOne of the smallest species of wild rabbit is the Marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris), an excellent swimmer that weighs .\nSmallest rabbit breeds\nThe following table includes rabbit breeds currently recognized by ARBA or by the BRC that have a maximum weight of . Also included is a small breed from Germany, the Teddy Dwarf.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | Domestic rabbit breeds &nbsp;&nbsp;Also called:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teddyzwerg||||||erect\n|-\n|Dwarf Hotot||||||erect\n|-\n|Jersey Wooly||||||erect\n|-\n|Polish [US]||||||erect\n|-\n|Lionhead||||||erect\n|-\n|Miniature Lion Lop||||||lop\n|-\n|Miniature Lop [UK/NL]||||||lop\n|-\n|Miniature Cashmere Lop||||||lop\n|-\n|American Fuzzy Lop||||||lop\n|-\n|Plush Lop (Miniature)||||||lop\n|}\nSee also\n* Cuniculture\n* House rabbit\n* Lethal dwarfism in rabbits\n* Lop rabbit\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://rabbitbreeders.us/rabbit-breeds Breeds of Rabbits Chart] at rabbitbreeders.us\n* [http://www.raising-rabbits.com/small-rabbit-breeds.html Small rabbit breeds] at Raising-Rabbits.com"
