In the , Moorooka had a population of 10,783 people.\nGeography\nMoorooka is  by road south of Brisbane's central business district.\nIpswich Road enters the suburb from the north (Annerley) and exits to the south-west (Rocklea). Beaudesert Road splits from Ipswich Road within the suburb and exits to the south (Rocklea).\nThe Gold Coast railway line passes along part of the western boundary of the suburb, which is serviced by the Moorooka railway station ().\nThe neighbourhood of Moorvale is located around the intersection of Beaudesert Road and Mayfield Road (.\nThe suburb has mixed uses - large areas, particularly in the elevated eastern side of the suburb are residential.  The lower, western side of the suburb is dominated by retail, particularly motor vehicle dealerships along Ipswich Road, known popularly throughout Brisbane as the \"Magic Mile\", light industry and warehouses.\nMany of the houses are pre-war Queenslanders (on posts, with simple one floor, wooden construction), with small apartment blocks scattered through the suburb. As with many older suburbs of Brisbane, Moorooka is becoming gentrified, with many older homes now being either renovated and extended or replaced by more modern buildings. There are prime real estate areas on the top of hills, with views to the Great Dividing Range over Archerfield in the south, Seventeen Mile Rocks to the west, Mount Coot-tha, St. Lucia, Indooroopilly to the north-west and the city to the north.\nHistory\nThe area is the traditional lands of the Australian Aboriginal Jagera people who lived there long before British settlement. The area was probably a hunting ground with plentiful food and water. There was also reportedly a Bora ring, which older residents of the area recall being shown. The word Moorooka is an indigenous word, either meaning 'iron bark', referring to the numerous iron bark trees in the area, or 'long nose', referring to Mt Toohey at the suburb's periphery.\nThe suburb was founded as a stop-over for journeys from Brisbane south (Logan and Albert river valleys) and south-west (Ipswich and beyond).  A section of the suburb's eastern boundary lies adjacent to Toohey Forest Park.\nIn April 1884, \"Fairmount Estate\" made up of 128 allotments was advertised to be auctioned by E. Hooker & Son. The Estate covered an area of Moorooka. The classified advertisement for the auction states for sale were '128 choice allotments, being re-subdivisions of subdivisions 1, 2 and 7 of Portion 158, Parish of Yeerongpilly'. Fairmount Estate was described as having, 'close proximity to the city', timber and permanent water 'close at hand', 'splendid quality' soil for gardening, 'no gullies to till up', a 'railway line passing the Estate, which will in a short time be open for traffic', a 'state school close', and a 'Grocer, Draper, Butcher, Baker, Blacksmith, and others already established in business in the locality of the Estate'.\nIn March 1889, auctioneer W.J.

The allotments were described as \"high and dry and commanding excellent views\" and were convenient to the train, tram and bus services with promises that Ipswich Road and Beaudesert Road would soon be sealed with bitumen. Also in July 1927, Clacher Brothers in conjunction with M.J. Trotter sold the \"Hollywood Estate\", consisting of 24 allotments on the south side of Forrest Street bounded by Fairy Street to the west and an unnamed proposed street (now Vale Street) to the east.
