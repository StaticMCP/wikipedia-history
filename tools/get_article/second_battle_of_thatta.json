(923 A.H.), Babur undertook his second expedition against Kandahar but became seriously ill. Shah Beg Arghun then proposed a peace agreement that was accepted by all, allowing him to move towards Sindh. There are two narrations of Shah Beg entering Sindh. At this time Shah Hassan was at service of Babur at Kabul.\nMasumi states that some Mongols settled in the region with Feroz's approval in an area designated Mughal Waro (Sindhi: مغل واڙو). Among them was Kasim Kabak Arghun, who switched sides from Shah Beg after a murder incident. Jam Feroz enlisted these Mongols, mainly from the Daolatshah and Nargahi tribes, out of concern for Darya Khan's loyalty, hoping to secure support from brave individuals who could oppose him if needed. Mir Kasim Kabak Arghun encouraged and induced Shah Beg Arghun to undertake the conquest of Samanagar and, therefore, Shah Beg Arghun made preparations.\nWhereas, Tahiri states that jealousy among the courtiers toward Darya Khan motivated them to urge Jam Feroz to take action against him. Finding him incapable, they turned to Jam Feroz's mother, Madina Machhari, and advised her to invite the Arghun Mongols to help remove Darya Khan from power. Following their suggestion, Madina invited Shah Beg, who took the Baghban-Sehwan route to enter Sindh.\nBattle\nShah Beg's Arrival\nShah Beg Arghun reached Fatehpur and Ganjabah to mobilize troops for war. He appointed chiefs to leadership roles, assigned his brother Muqim Beg to oversee Siwi, and sent a Vanguard under Mir Fazil Kokaltash with 240 horses to advance. Despite Darya Khan's sons, Mahmud Khan and Motan Khan, joining the Samma army at Talti near Sehwan, Shah Beg Arghun decided to bypass them and continued his march.\nUpon reaching Baghban, Shah Beg Arghun was paid homage by local chiefs who encouraged his advancement towards Samanagar. He traversed the Lakki hills and established his camp approximately six miles south of Samanagar, beside the Khan Wah. During this period, the Indus River flowed south of Samanagar, necessitating a strategy to cross it. Shah Beg Arghun's scouts identified a local resident who guided them to a fording point in the river.\nInterlude\nOn the 15th of Muharram 926 AH (1519 AD), Shah Beg successfully led his forces across the river, leaving a contingent of soldiers to secure the camp. In the meantime, Darya Khan, having left Jam Feroz at the capital, advanced with a substantial army and engaged in battle with the Arghuns. Arghuns encountered Samma army near 'Khan Wah' canal which Darya Khan had himself built to irrigate the lands of village Sankurah and other areas. The confrontation resulted in a decisive victory for Shah Beg, although Darya Khan was tragically captured by Tingari Birdi Qabtasal and killed in the conflict.\nDarya Khan's Death\nMultiple accounts exist regarding the circumstances of Darya Khan's death.\nTarikhi-i-Tahiri states:Darya Khan was killed while fighting bravely, when an arrow hit him in the throat. Feroz Shah kept aloof.Tarikh-i-Masumi states:He lost and was captured by Tingari Birdi Qabtasal and put to sword along with the other Samma soldiers.Zafar-ul-Walih states:He was called by the Arghuns to discuss the terms of peace and treacherously murdered.\nFeroz Flees\nAfter hearing of his army's defeat, Jam Feroz fled to the village of Pir Ar to learn about his family. Shah Beg, aware of his presence, placed guards around the residence for protection.\nAftermath\nSamanagar Plundered\nArghuns plundered the city for 10 days. Several women and children of respectable families were captured. Even the family of Jam Feroz remained in the city. It was at the intercession of Qazi Qadan, the most learned man of the time at Samanagar, whose family members also had been taken prisoners, that Shah Beg stopped the plunder by giving an arrow to the Qazi to show it round to the plundering Mongols. A proclamation was also issued to that effect, and once more there was order and quiet in the city. In his invasion, local Mahdavi followers helped him and cooperated with him in the tyranny let loose on the simple and innocent people of Sindh.\nFeroz Surrenders\nWith no alternatives, Jam Feroz sent messengers to Shah Beg, requesting mercy and acknowledging him as his superior. Shah Beg replied with gifts and promised forgiveness if Jam Feroz surrendered. Subsequently, Jam Feroz, along with his family, approached the riverbank with a sword around his neck as a sign of surrender. Shah Beg ordered the Jam's families to be taken across with due honor, and in the next month, Safar, Shah Beg encamped outside the city, where Jam Feroz came to pay homage to him in person. Shah Beg received him well and gave him the rich robe of honour that his father Amir Zu'n-Nun Beg Arghun had received from Sultan Muzaffar Husain. Shah Beg was kind enough to give the governorship of Samanagar to Jam Feroz.\nSindh Partitioned\nAfter consulting with regional leaders, it was decided to divide Sindh into two halves: one for Jam Feroz and the other to be managed by agents of Shah Beg, with the Lakki hills near Sehwan as the boundary. Jam Feroz would control the area from Lakki to Samanagar, while Shah Beg’s agents would oversee the northern territory. In return, Jam Feroz would share half of the land revenue with Shah Beg. This decision, however, diminished Feroz's respect and prestige among his people. Once the agreement was finalized, Shah Beg left Samanagar for Shal.\nArghuns Annexed:\n*Bukkur Sarkar with twelve Mahals; Bukkur, Uch, Mathelo, Ubauro, Alor, Darbelo.\n*Sehwan Sarkar with nine Mahals; Sehwan, Paat, Baghban, Kahan (Gaha), Lakhpat.\nSammas Retained:\n*Chachkan Sarkar with eleven Mahals; Chachkan, Jun, Fateh Bagh.\n*Naserpur Sarkar with seven Mahals; Naserpur, Amarkot, Hala Kandi, Samma-vali.\n*Chakar Hala Sarkar with eight Mahals; Chakar Hala, Ghazipur.\n*Thatta Sarkar with eighteen Mahals; Samanagar, Lahari Bandar, Bathoro, Bahrampur, Sakro.\nHistorians Quote\nTarikh-i-Masumi, References Mongol plunder of Samanagar through a Quranic Verse: She said, \"Indeed, kings—when they enter a city—they ruin it and render the honored of its people humbled. And thus do they behave.\" Surah An-Naml (27:34)\nReferences"
