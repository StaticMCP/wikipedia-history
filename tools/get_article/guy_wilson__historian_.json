From 1988 to 2002, he was Master of the Armouries and head of the Royal Armouries, the United Kingdom's national museum for arms and armour.\nEarly life and education\nWilson was born on 18 February 1950 to Rowland Wilson and Mollie Wilson (née Munson). He studied at New College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree; as per tradition, his BA was later promoted to a Master of Arts. He then studied at the University of Manchester where he completed a Diploma in Art Gallery and Museum Studies.\nCareer\nWilson began working at the Royal Armouries in 1972. From 1978 to 1981, he was keeper of edged weapons and was based in the Tower of London. In 1981, he was appointed Deputy Master of the Armouries. In 1988, he was appointed Master of the Armouries and therefore became the head of the Royal Armouries. During his leadership, the Royal Armouries expanded from its original site at the Tower of London to include two more museums. Fort Nelson, a 19th-century fort and museum near Portsmouth specialising in artillery was taken over by the Royal Armouries in 1995. A new museum was built in Leeds, the Royal Armouries Museum, and it opened in March 1996. He stepped down as Master in 2002.\nOutside of his work at the Royal Armouries, he held a number of appointments. Since 1978, he has been a member of the British Commission for Military History. From 1981 to 1999, he served on the Advisory Committee on Historic Wreck. He has been Vice-President of the Arms and Armour Society of Great Britain since 1995. From 2002 to 2003, he served as President of the International Association of Museums of Arms and Military History (IAMAM). From 2003 to 2010, he served as Chairman of the International Committee for Museums of Arms and Military History (ICOMAM). ICOMAM is the successor organisation to IAMAM.\nPersonal life\nIn 1972, Wilson married Pamela Ruth McCredie. Together they have four children; two daughters and two sons.\nHonours\nOn 12 January 1984, Wilson was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA). He was elected a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Gunmakers in 1990 and a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers in 2000.\nSelected works\n*\n*\n*\n*\nReferences"
