It is located on the right bank of the Kabini River, a tributary of the Kaveri River. Nanjanagudu is also known as The \"Dakshina Kashi\" or \"Kashi of South\".\nin Kannada means \"to poison\". The name  means the \"God who Drank the Poison\" (halāhala, a word that has its origins in the legend of the Great Churning of the Ocean of Milk); thus, the town got the name \"Nanjanagudu\" which means \"the abode of the god Nanjundeshwara\".\nThe temple's Dodda Jaathre festival attracts thousands of devotees. The festivities in the fair include five colorful chariots pulled by devotees on a path called the ratha beedi. Parasurama Temple is near Nanjundeshwara Temple.\nThe nine-storied, 120-foot-tall temple gopuram (gateway tower) and its extensive exterior was built by Devarajammanni, the queen of the Mysore king Krishnaraja Wadiyar III.\nHistory\nNanjungud is mentioned as Sri Garalapuri, in the Shiva Purana. It is said that the legendary holy place is the abode of Shiva in southern India. It is also referred to as \"Dakshina Kasi\", where the god appeared at the plea of his devotees, the Devas, and sage Narada. The demon Keshi obtained a boon from Brahma and Vishnu by which they would not be able to kill him. He assumed that with this boon, he was as good as immortal and began troubling the people, the Devas, and the sages. At last, Narada and the Devas pleaded with Shiva to save everyone. He appeared in Garalapuri Sri Kshetra (present Nanjungud) and killed Keshi. He further assured that his Ansh (a part of his divine self) would always remain here and bless humanity; the place henceforth would be a papa vinashini ('remover of sins'). After bathing in the holy river of Kabini, every human praying to Lord Srikanteshwara or Nanjundeshwara (Shiva) of Nanjungud would be rid of sins and blessed by the god.\nSage Parashuram, after beheading his mother as per his father Sage Jamadagni's orders, wanted to undo his sins from \"Matru Hatya\" (his mother's murder). Per Narada's advice, he reached Garalapuri (Nanjangud) and prayed to Sri Nanjundeshwara Swamy. Shiva appeared and advised him to build a mantapa and perform pooja to the Shivlinga. While clearing the shrubs with his parashu (axe), Parashuram's axe unintentionally hit the Shivlinga, and the tip of the Shivlinga began to bleed. Sage Parashuram felt very guilty and said, \"I have committed another unforgivable sin; only by killing myself shall I be relieved from all my sins\", and prepared to kill himself. Shiva appeared and blessed Sage Parashuram and told him to apply wet mud upon the Shivlinga (the mud of Sri Nanjangud has immense healing powers). The Shivlinga stopped bleeding. Lord Shiva advised Parashuram to build the mantapa and continue his penance. Finally, Sage Parashuram was relieved from all his sins and blessed with immortality.\nThe Goddess Parvati, consort of Shiva, wanted to visit this holy place, and so he brought her to Garalapuri Nanjangud. When she went to the Kabini River and bent down to touch the water, a gemstone bead (mani) fell off from her crown into the water. Lord Shiva was pleased and declared, \"Devi, until now, the place had my divine blessings and presence; from this moment, it shall have your presence, grace and blessings, too. It shall also be called Dakshina Manikarnika Ghat\".\nDuring the reign of King Tipu Sultan, his royal elephant became blind. As per the advice of his minister, Sri Poornayya, Tipu sent the elephant to the Nanjundeshwara Swamy Temple and performed 48 days of rituals. On the 48th day, the elephant's vision was restored. Tipu Sultan offered the emerald green Shivlinga as a token of gratitude to Sri Nanjundeshwara Swamy and called Lord Shiva \"Hakim Nanjunda\" (healer).\nThe origins of the Srikanteshwara Temple date back to the Ganga dynasty, but its expansion and present grandeur are attributed to contributions from the Cholas, Hoysalas, and the Wodeyars of Mysore. While the Gangas first established a smaller shrine, the Cholas and Hoysalas made significant architectural additions. The Wodeyars, prominent patrons of the temple, are credited with building the impressive gopuram and several mandapas.\nThe name \"Nanjundeshwara\", meaning \"the healer,\" is derived from Lord Shiva's act of consuming poison (Halahala) during the Samudra Manthana (churning of the ocean).\nGallery\nFile:View of gopura from inside the Srikanteshwara temple complex at Nanjangud.JPG|View of gopura from inside\nFile:Large pillared mantapa with sala towers in the Srikanteshwara temple complex at Nanjangud.JPG|Large pillared mantapa with sala towers\nFile:Open mantapa with sala roofs in the Srikanteshwara temple complex at Nanjangud.JPG|Open mantapa with sala roofs\nFile:Close up view of sala tower over mantapa in Srikanteshwara temple complex at Nanjangud.JPG|Close up view of sala tower over mantapa\nFile:Pillared entrance into the Srikanteshwara temple complex at Nanjangud.jpg|Pillared entrance to temple\nFile:Close up view of pillars at the entrance to Srikanteshwara temple complex at Nanjangud.JPG|Close up view of pillared entrance to temple\nFile:Yali pillars in the mahadwara (entrance) of Srikanteshwara temple complex at Nanjangud.JPG|Yali pillars in the mahadwara\nFile:Kannada inscription (1517 AD) in the Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud.JPG|Kannada inscription (1517 CE) of King Krishnadevaraya's father-in-law\nFile:Deity sculpture in Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud 6.JPG|Deity sculpture\nFile:Ganesha relief sculpture in Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud.JPG|Ganesha sculpture\nFile:Deity sculpture in Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud 7.JPG|Deity sculpture\nFile:Deity sculpture in Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud 4.JPG|Shree Veerabhadreshwara sculpture\nFile:Deity sculpture in Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud 5.JPG|Deity sculpture\nFile:Deity sculpture in Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud 2.JPG|Deity sculpture\nFile:Deity sculpture in Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud 3.JPG|Deity sculpture\nFile:Decorative pillars near the sanctum of Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud.JPG|Decorative pillars\nSee also\n*Samudra manthan\nReferences\nHistorical and Cultural Context of Nanjangud Temple\nKarnataka Temples Documentation"
