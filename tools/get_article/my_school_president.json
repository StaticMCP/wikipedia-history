His dream is to lead his band to victory at the Hot Wave Music Contest. However, due to an incident at the Hot Wave contest last year, the new school principal (Sarocha Watittapan) announces that any school club that does not boost the school's reputation will be shut down. In order to save his club, Gun turns for help from the school president, Tinn (Norawit Titicharoenrak).\nFor the past two years, Tinn has been secretly crushing on Gun. It is now their final year of high school and his last chance to confess his love.
