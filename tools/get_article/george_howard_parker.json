He was a professor at Harvard, and investigated the anatomy and physiology of sense organs and animal reactions.\nBiography\nGeorge Howard Parker was born in Philadelphia on 23 Dec 1864. He graduated from Harvard in 1887 with his undergraduate degree, later pursuing special courses there and at the universities of Leipzig, Berlin and Freiburg. He became assistant instructor in zoology at Harvard in 1888 and occupied different positions there, earning his Ph.D. in 1891 and becoming professor of zoology in 1906.\nHe was Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and also of the American Philosophical Society.\nFor his work \"Do Melanophore Nerves Show Antidromic Responses?\" in the Journal of General Physiology, Parker was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal in 1937 by the National Academy of Sciences. He was William Brewster Clark lecturer at Amherst College in 1914 and in that year was sent by the United States Government to investigate the Pribilof seal herd.\nSelected publications\n*G.H.
