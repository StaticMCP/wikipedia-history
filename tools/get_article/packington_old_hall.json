It stands in gardens enclosed by late 17th century brick walls.\nHistory\nThe original Packington Manor House (now known as Packington Old Hall) was rebuilt in red brick in 1679 for Sir Clement Fisher, 2nd Baronet, and his wife Jane Lane. In 1690, it was described as ‘a sweet seat, near the road, with a park on the other side, with a fair lodge and an avenue of fir-trees to the hall’.\nThere is an oblong shaped brick dovecote about 50m away from the Old Hall which was used for housing doves and pigeons. It has over 100 nesting places on three of the walls.\nIn 1693 Sir Clement Fisher's nephew, also Sir Clement Fisher, 3rd Baronet, built another larger mansion on the estate. The new house became known as Packington Hall and from 1729 the house has been the seat of the Earls of Aylesford.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.geograph.org.uk/search.php?i=3980171 Photos of Packington Old Hall and surrounding area on geograph]"
