The Jammys are sponsored by Relix magazine, Jambands.com, and Shapiro. The Jammy Awards returned in 2008 to the WAMU Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City after taking a one-year break.\nFirst Annual Jammy Awards (2000)\nThe First Annual Jammy Awards were held on June 22, 2000, at Irving Plaza in New York City. The event was presented by Jambands.com and executive producers Peter Shapiro and Dean Budnick. Shapiro, who owns the Wetlands Preserve, is the publisher of Jambands.com. Budnick is editor in chief of Jambands.com and also co-hosted The Jammys with Peter Prince of Moon Boot Lover. The evening had two basic components: awards were presented in various categories, and the scene's best bands performed sets of blistering music with special guests. The idea originated nearly 10 months prior in a conversation between Budnick and managers for various bands. John Topper from Moe, Bob Kennedy from Deep Banana Blackout, and Darren Cohen from The Slip had all referenced \"The Jammys\" as an obvious play on \"The Grammys.\"\nPresenters included: Steve Bloom (High Times), Richard Gehr (The Village Voice), Lee Crumpton (Home Grown Music Network founder), Sam Kopper (first program director at WBCN in Boston, Phoenix Presents live engineer), John Scofield, Anthony DeCurtis (Rolling Stone, VH1), Kirk West (The Allman Brothers Band archivist), and Jambands.com staff members.\nStrangefolk closed the show joined by Merl Saunders for a Grateful Dead tribute in which they performed \"Scarlet Begonias\", then Strangefolk's Eric Glocker was replaced on stage with Percy Hill's John Leccese, at which point they jammed into \"Fire on the Mountain.\"\nPerformers\nThe Jammy Awards featured performers including The New Deal (band), Frogwings, The Disco Biscuits & Les Claypool,\nMerl Saunders, John Scofield, Strangefolk, Susan Tedeschi, Deep Banana Blackout, Soulive and The Slip.\nAward winners\n*Live Set of the Year: Phish, 12/31/99, Set II\n*Jam of the Year: The Disco Biscuits, Akira Jam, 12/31/99\n*Release of the Year: Grateful Dead, So Many Roads\n*Live Album of the Year: Moe, L\n*Wetlands Award (Lifetime Achievement): B.

The show featured more than five hours of non-stop music and presentations. \"The idea for the Jammys was to create a night of music where we didn't know what was going to happen,\" says Jammys executive producer Peter Shapiro. \"We wanted to bring artists who not only hadn't played together, but hadn't met and now, after experiencing what went down, it's a pretty overwhelming feeling.\"\nPerformers\nCol.

The event was co-hosted by Gov't Mule/Allman Brothers Band guitarist Warren Haynes and Grace Potter\nPerformers\nThe four members of Phish stood onstage together for the first time since Coventry to accept the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 7th Jammy Awards. The surprise reunion followed an emotional speech from longtime Phish photographer (and Relix contributor) Danny Clinch, who stressed the importance of family both on and off the stage throughout the Phish community. All four members of Phish addressed the audience from the stage, beginning with Mike Gordon, who said that he was actually sick in bed until shortly before arriving at the venue. Both Page McConnell and Jon Fishman also delivered quick acceptance speeches, before handing over the microphone to Trey Anastasio, who thanked a number of key members in the Phish organization by name and described his former bandmates as his oldest friends. He also talked at length about the strength and importance of the Phish community, before bowing alongside his bandmates and quietly exiting the stage. Anastasio’s appearance marked his first public showing outside upstate New York since entering a drug rehabilitation program in early 2007.\nPhish's emotional speech arrived near the end of the night. Co-hosts Warren Haynes and Grace Potter, who have spent the past few weeks on the road together, opened the evening with a band that consisted of Stax keyboardist Booker T. Jones, bassist Will Lee (Fab Faux, Late Show with David Letterman) and drummer Joe Russo, who recently spent time on the road with Potter along with his Duo partner Marco Benevento. The supergroup ran through a number of classic rock covers, including Crosby, Stills, Nash & Youngs \"Find the Cost of Freedom\", Fleetwood Mac's \"Gold Dust Woman\" (a staple on Potters tour with Govt Mule) and Al Green's, \"Take Me to the River.\" Former New Groove of the Month Rose Hill Drive took the stage next with special guest Matisyahu and his bandmates Aaron Dugan and Rob Marscher (formerly of 2001 Jammy nominees Addison Groove Project). The strange bedfellows ran through a cover of The Flaming Lips' \"In the Morning of the Magicians\", before Mountain guitarist Leslie West took the stage with Rose Hill Drive for the evening's loudest offerings. The hard-rock guitarist jammed with Rose Hill Drive and Potter on a version of \"I'm Going Down\" that included \"Close Encounters\", before offering his signature song, \"Mississippi Queen\".\nNext up, festival favorite Keller Williams took the stage to perform a solo version of his Jammy nominated song \"Cadillac.\" He was joined onstage by comedian/actor Chevy Chase, who, unbeknownst to most, played drums with Donald Fagen and Walter Becker in one of their bands that preceded Steely Dan.. On this occasion Chase opted to play piano alongside Williams on a rearranged version of \"(You Made Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" and a medley of \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and \"Take the Money and Run\" that earned some of the evenings loudest cheers. The pair apparently bonded backstage and when Williams later took top honors in the Song on the Year category, he sent Chase onstage in his place for a humorous speech that included the line, \"I want to thank Clive Davis just because I feel like I should.\" As the show went on Tea Leaf Green made its Jammys debut with guest bassist Steve Adams (ALO) and fiddler Allie Kral (New Groove winner Cornmeal) for a rendition of their 2006 Jammy winning number, \"Taught to be Proud.\" Big Head Todd's Todd Park Mohr and Squeeze's Glenn Tilbrook also sat in with the expanded group on their songs \"Pulling Mussels (From The Shell)\" and \"Tempted,\" respectively, the latter of which featured some choice guitar work by Haynes himself.\nPage McConnell, who was the only member of Phish confirmed to play the Jammys in the weeks leading up to the event, led an all-star jazz combo that included drummer Roy Haynes, saxophonist James Carter, trumpeter and former Anastasio collaborator Nicholas Payton and bassist Christian McBride through two of his three recorded Phish originals: \"Magilla\" and \"Cars Trucks Buses.\" Then Galactic balanced its jazz/funk past with its hip-hop present, inviting out a slew of guests, including Booker T. Jones, Sharon Jones, Jurassic 5s Chali 2na and MC Doug E. Fresh for songs like \"Hip Hug-Her,\" \"Born Under A Bad Sign\" and \"Think Back,\" among others.\nThe evening's surprise guests really started coming out in force when Beatles tribute act the Fab Faux took the stage with stealth performer Joan Osborne for a rendition of \"Come Together.\" The Fab Faux then busted into \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" and Anastasio emerged partway through the song to thunderous applause to take an extended solo, before leading the group into a jam uncharacteristic of the cover act. He remained onstage for the rest of the groups segment, which included a tease \"Bungalow Bill\" and \"Everybody’s Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey.\"\nThe rest of the night focused on Phish, both before and after the four members of the group took the stage to accept their award. After the quartet slipped into the wings, Disco Biscuits bassist Marc Brownstein led Disco Biscuits guitarist Jon Gutwillig, String Cheese Incident keyboardist Kyle Hollingsworth, Umphreys McGee guitarist Jake Cinninger and Russo through a series of Phish covers under the name the HeadCount All Stars. Brownstein, who has shied away from covering Phish over the years, described the group as his favorite band and led the charge through spot-on renditions of \"Wilson,\" \"Run Like An Antelope,\" \"2001,\" and \"Maze,\" the latter of which also featured Disco Biscuits keyboardist Aron Magner. Throughout the performance, Moe lighting director, and former Jambands.com News Editor, Jeff Waful manned the board from the rear of the house.\nWinners\nLifetime Achievement: Phish\nTour of the Year: the Disco Biscuits/Umphrey’s McGee, D.U.M.B\nLive Album of the Year: Umphrey's McGee - Live at the Murat\nStudio Album of the Year: Moe - The Conch\nSong of the Year: Keller Williams - \"Cadillac\"\nLive Performance of the Year: Gov’t Mule and Guests, Bonnaroo\nArchival Album of the Year: The Grateful Dead- \"Three From The Vault\"\nDVD of the Year: the Disco Biscuits - \"Progressions\"\nDownload of the Year: Phish - \"Headphones Jam\"\nNew Groove: Cornmeal\nMimi Fishman Memorial Community Service Award - Rock the Earth\nThe Jammy Industry Award: Lee Crumpton, Homegrown Music Network\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.jambands.com Jambands.com site]\n* [http://www.relix.com/ Relix Magazine official site]"
