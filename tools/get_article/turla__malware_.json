The group has probably been operating since the late 1990s, according to professor Thomas Rid of Johns Hopkins University. Dan Goodin in Ars Technica described Turla as \"Russian spies\". Turla has since been given other names such as Snake, Krypton, and Venomous Bear.\nUS actions against group\nIn May 2023 the United States Department of Justice announced that the United States had managed to infiltrate machines that were infected by the malware and issue a command ordering the malware to delete itself. Affidavits from the FBI and DOJ revealed that the group was part of the Russian Federal Security Service Center 16 group in Ryazan.\nPossible GoldenJackal connection\nESET noted that the command and control protocol used by GoldenJackal malware is typically used by Turla, suggesting the groups may be connected.\nSee also\n* Agent.BTZ\n* Red October (malware)\nReferences"
