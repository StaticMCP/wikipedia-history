The Italian invasion of France was short-lived and the French signed an armistice with the Italians on 25 June, three days after France's armistice with Germany. This left the British and the forces of the Commonwealth of Nations for the Italians to contend with in the Middle East.\nSuccessively on 19 October 1940, four Italian SM.82s bombers attacked American-operated oil refineries in the British Protectorate of Bahrain, damaging the local refineries. The raid also struck Dhahran in Saudi Arabia, but caused little damage.\nBombing campaign\nStarting in July 1940, the Italian bombing of the British Mandate of Palestine was primarily centered on Tel Aviv and Haifa. However, many other coastal towns such as Acre and Jaffa also suffered.\nThe last Italian bombing on the territories of the British Mandate of Palestine occurred in June 1941. Haifa and Tel Aviv were hit, but with little damage and few casualties.\nBombing of Haifa\nHaifa was repeatedly attacked by Italian bombers starting in July 1940. They targeted the city's port and refinery. The first such raid occurred on 15 July 1940 when five Italian aircraft led by Major Ettore Muti struck the Iraq Petroleum Company installation, setting three oil tanks on fire and damaging a power station, temporarily disrupting the city's electricity supply. Two Arab civilians were severely injured, one of whom later died. The second raid came on 24 July 1940 when Italian SM.79 bombers attacked eastern Haifa, aiming for the oil refineries and storage facilities. A total of 28 Arab and 15 Jewish civilians were killed along with one British constable. The Italians claimed a huge success which the British did not deny. Time magazine, describing one of the raids, wrote that where the British oil pipeline from Kirkuk reached tidewater, \"Ten big Italian bombers, flying at great altitude from the Dodecanese Islands, giving the British bases at Cyprus a wide berth, dropped 50 bombs on the Haifa oil terminal and refinery.\" The bombing started fires which burned for many days afterwards, and the refinery's production was blocked for nearly one month. British fighters from a base on Mount Carmel were too late to overtake the Italians returning to their base in Italian Dodecanese. Italian aircraft carried out additional raids on Haifa on 6 and 27 August and on 6 and 8 September which caused no fatalities.\nBombing of Tel Aviv\nOn 9 September 1940, a bombing raid on Tel Aviv caused 137 deaths. There was another raid on Tel Aviv on 12 June 1941 with 13 deaths, done by the Italians or by the Vichy French based in Syria.\nHistorian Alberto Rosselli pinpointed that the bombing of Tel Aviv that killed 137 people was because the Italian bombers were on their way to the strategic port and refineries of Haifa, but were intercepted by British aircraft. Forced to go back, the Italians received orders to drop their bombs on the port of Tel Aviv, but in attempting to avoid the attacking British planes they dropped the bombs by mistake on a civilian area near the port.\nGallery\nFile:Bombing of tel aviv 7.jpg|A casualty of the Italian bombing of Tel Aviv in hospital on 10 September 1940\nFile:World war 2 bombing killed memorial in Tel Aviv.JPG|Memorial in Tel Aviv to the 137 killed in the Italian Royal Air Force raid of the city on 9 September 1940.\nFile:Bombing of tel aviv 1.jpg|Damaged cars in Tel Aviv following the Italian bombing\nFile:Bombing of haifa 11.jpg|Destruction of Muslim graveyard and the Istiklal Mosque by Italian bombers during the bombing of Haifa, September 1940.\nFile:1940 - תל אביב הלוויה של הרוגי ההתקפה האיטלקית-PHL-1089243.png|Funeral of victims of the bombing of Tel Aviv\nFile:Bombing of haifa 14.jpg|Oil tanks burning in Haifa as a result of bombing in October 1940\nFile:Bombing of haifa 7.jpg|A burnt-out oil tanker truck after an Italian air raid on Haifa in July 1940\nFile:Bombing of tel aviv 3.jpg|A ruined building in Tel Aviv in September 1940\nSee also\n* Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica)\n* Bombing of Bahrain in World War II\nFootnotes"
