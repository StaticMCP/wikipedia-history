It lasted from September 1921 until July 1925. Officially, the territory involved was under the jurisdiction of the British Mandate of Mesopotamia.\nSheikh Mahmud revolts\nwith his soldiers in Slemani]]\nDuring the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Kurds attempted to establish an independent state.\nMahmud Barzanji, the Shaykh of the Qadiriyyah order of Sufis, the most influential personality in Southern Kurdistan, was appointed governor of the former sanjak of Duhok, but rallied against the British and declared an independent Kurdistan in May 1919. He was defeated in June.\nOn 10 October 1921, a statement was issued in Suleymanyah, the capital of Kurdistan, to establish a Kurdish government. Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji declared himself as the King of the Kingdom of Kurdistan.\nAfter the Treaty of Sèvres, which settled some territories, Sulaymaniya still remained under the direct control of the British High Commissioner. After the subsequent penetration of the Turkish \"Özdemir\" Detachment into the area, an attempt was made by the British to counter this by appointing Shaykh Mahmud governor again, in September 1922. The Shaykh revolted again, and in November declared himself King of the Kingdom of Kurdistan. Members of his cabinet included:\n*Shaikh Qadir Hafeed – Prime Minister\n*Abdulkarim Alaka, a Christian Kurd – Finance Minister\n*Ahmed Bagy Fatah Bag – Customs Minister\n*Hajy Mala Saeed Karkukli – Justice Minister\n*Hema Abdullah Agha – Labour Minister\n*Mustafa Pasha Yamolki – Education Minister\n*Shekh Mohammed Gharib – Interior Minister\n*Zaky Sahibqran – Defence Minister of the Kurdish National Army\nBarzanji was defeated when the British sent out an Assyrian force to capture Sulaymaniyah in July 1924, and in January 1926 the League of Nations gave the mandate over the territory back to Iraq, with the provision for special rights for Kurds. In 1930–1931, Shaykh Makhmud Barzanji made his last unsuccessful attempt.\nThe British Royal Air Force's Iraq Command acting on behalf of the Iraqi government in Baghdad played a part in bringing the Kingdom of Kurdistan to an end.\nSee also\n* List of Kurdish dynasties and countries\n* Republic of Ararat\n* Republic of Mahabad\n* Kurdistan Regional Government\nReferences\nFootnotes\nGeneral\n# McDowell, D.
