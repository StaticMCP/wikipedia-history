Soon after, the group attacked the village of Bashir 15&nbsp;km south of Kirkuk city, where they clashed with local gunmen and police forces, assisted by the Peshmerga. After an hour of fighting the militants captured the village, leaving a senior Kurdish police brigadier wounded and six of his bodyguards killed. After taking control of the village ISIL massacred 52 Shi’a Turkmens.\nWith Bashir captured, ISIL moved forward and temporarily captured two sub-districts of the Kirkuk city: one in the west of it (Multaqa sub-district) and one in the south (Taza sub-district). Later that day, Peshmerga forces, with support of U.S.-led Coalition airstrikes, recaptured both sub-districts.\nOn 18 June, ISIL launched another offensive toward Kirkuk, this time targeting the northern part of the city and attempting to seize its oil fields. However, Peshmerga forces successfully repelled the attack and defended the city.\nAt the end of July, the Badr Organization recruited Shi’a Turkmen locals to recapture the village of Bashir in an attempted counter-offensive, which ultimately failed.\nIn December, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack on Kirkuk that killed at least 17 people and injured more than 20. The attack, according to ISIS, was meant to send a message to the Kurdish people and Peshmerga fighters.\nAftermath\nOn the nights of 29 January and 30 January, ISIL attacked Kirkuk once again, leading to a new battle.\nReferences"
