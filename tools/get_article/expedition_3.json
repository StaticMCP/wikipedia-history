The third resident crew launched on 10 August 2001 on Space Shuttle Discovery during mission STS-105 and took control of the complex on 13 August 2001. The crew conducted a science-intensive increment and completed four spacewalks. The Expedition Three crew ended their 117-day residency on board the ISS on 8 December 2001 when their custom Soyuz seat-liners were transferred to Space Shuttle Endeavour for the return trip home during mission STS-108.\nThe Expedition Three crew of the International Space Station enjoyed a unique view of the 2001 Leonid meteor storm. \"It looked like we were seeing UFOs approaching the earth flying in formation, three or four at a time,\" recalls astronaut Frank Culbertson. \"There were hundreds per minute going beneath us, really spectacular!\" News reports had warned sky watchers in advance: On 18 November 2001, Earth was due to plow through a minefield of debris shed by Comet Tempel-Tuttle. Innumerable bits of comet dust would become meteors when they hit Earth's atmosphere at . Experts predicted an unforgettable display ... and it came. Millions of people saw the show, but only three of them—the ones on board the space station—saw it from above. \"We had to look down to see the meteors,\" says Culbertson. \"That's because the atmosphere (where comet dust burns up) is below the station.\"\nAn international crew of three were the third crew to live aboard the International Space Station. The team was led by American Commander Frank Culbertson, and joined by Russian crewmates Vladimir Dezhurov, mission pilot, and flight engineer Mikhail Tyurin. As a part of the STS-105 mission, Discovery delivered the Expedition 3 crew to the station. During their four-month stay, the crew saw the orbital complex expand and research work grow. The Expedition 3 crew returned home on mission STS-108.\nSpacewalks\nAll four of the spacewalks during Expedition 3 were completed using the Russian Orlan spacesuit and from the Pirs air lock on the Russian segment of the International Space Station.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"10%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Mission\n! width=\"20%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Spacewalkers\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Start (UTC)\n! width=\"16%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|End (UTC)\n! width=\"12%\" style=\"background:#ccccff;color:black;text-align:left\"|Duration\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 3EVA 1\n| Vladimir Dezhurov  Mikhail Tyurin\n| 8 October 2001  14:23\n| 8 October 2001  19:21\n|  4 hours 58 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Dezhurov and Tyurin made connections between Pirs and the station's Zvezda Service Module. The spacewalkers installed a cable that will allow space walk radio communications between the two station sections. They also installed handrails on the new compartment. Then, they installed an exterior ladder that will be used to help spacewalkers leave Pirs' hatch. Tyurin and Dezhurov installed a Strela cargo crane onto the station.\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 3EVA 2\n| Dezhurov  Tyurin\n| 15 October 2001  09:17\n| 15 October 2001  15:09\n| 5 hours 52 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"| Dezhurov and Tyurin installed Russian commercial experiments on the exterior of Pirs. Among the experiments is a set of investigations of how various materials react to the space environment over a long time. Called MPAC-SEEDS, the investigation is housed in three briefcase-sized containers.\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 3EVA 3\n| Dezhurov  Frank Culbertson\n| 12 November 2001  21:41\n| 13 November 2001  02:45\n| 5 hours 4 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Dezhurov and Culbertson connected cables on the exterior of Pirs for the Kurs automated docking system. They completed checks of the Strela cargo crane, using one space walker at the end of the crane's boom to simulate a cargo. They also inspected and photographed a small panel of one solar array on the Zvezda Service Module that has one portion of a panel not fully unfolded.\n|-\n|rowspan=2 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Expedition 3EVA 4\n| Dezhurov  Tyurin\n| 3 December 2001  13:20\n| 3 December 2001  16:06\n| 2 hours 46 minutes\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"border-bottom:2px solid grey;\"|Dezhurov and Tyurin removed an obstruction that prevented a Progress resupply ship from firmly docking with the International Space Station. They also took pictures of the debris, which was a rubber seal from the previous cargo ship, and of the docking interface.\n|}\nMission patch\nThe Expedition 3 mission patch depicts the book of space history, turning from the chapter with the Russian space station Mir and the space shuttle to the next chapter, one that will be written on the blank pages of the future by space explorers working for the benefit of the entire world. Above the book is a layout of what the station will look like when completed, docked with the space shuttle.\n9/11 satellite pictures\nOn 11 September 2001, the International Space Station passed over New York City and astronaut Frank L. Culbertson Jr. photographed the smoke clouds billowing from the World Trade Center site in Downtown Manhattan.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20000302211732/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/crew-3/ndxpage1.html Expedition 3 Photography]"
