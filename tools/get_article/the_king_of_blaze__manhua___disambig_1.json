The first edition contains additional products: a collector's box, a large folio poster of Chien Mei and bookplate.\n*Hold Me to the Dream (Chinese: ; Japanese: ) is the second picture collection illustrated book, published in Taiwan by Sharp Point Press in 1999, and in China by Xinjiang Juvenile Publishing House in 2001. A 40-page hardcover picture book with collector's box.\nTV series adaptation\nThe King of Blaze is adapted into a television series of the same name by Mango TV, which aired on Hunan TV in 2018.\nThe series received generally negative responses from both critics and audience due to the huge differences between the manhua and its adaptation, and turning the BL (Boys' Love) manhua into a BG (Boy & Girl) drama. Douban gave it a 3.8 out of 10 rating, based on 5141 reviews, indicating \"negative reviews\". It has been questioned by the audience if the series is anything like the book except the names of some main characters. And the casting and special effects have been criticised for being inappropriate and horrible, respectively.\nReception\nThe King of Blaze sold 70 thousand each tankōbon volume in Taiwan, and over 30 million collected tankōbon volumes of pirated edition in China, and reprinted 62 times. It was selected as the most popular manhua among Asian comics published in Taiwan (including Hong Kong manhua, Japanese manga, and Korean manhwa) by the Reader's Choice Vote held by the Taiwanese newspaper China Times, in 1997.\nIn The Application of Comics on General Education: A Study of the Body Implication in the Comics titled \"Chingguo-Yuanling\" and \"Huo-Wang\" by Su-Lan Yu, an article published in an academic journal of National Chung Hsing University, the author concludes after a detailed analysis: }}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
