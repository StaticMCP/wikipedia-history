It is dedicated to the fallen soldiers of the First Polish Army who fought on the Eastern Front of the Second World War. The monument was designed by Xawery Dunikowski and unveiled on 12 October 1963.\nHistory\nThe monument was financed by the Polish Armed Forces. In 1959, a contest was organised for the design of the monument. However, no project was chosen, with sculptor Xawery Dunikowski being commissioned instead. He designed his work between 1962 and 1963, with help of Jerzy Bereś, Józef Galica, Józef Potępa. The postament and its surroundings were designed by Leon Suzin. The project was not fully finished due to Dunikowski's progressing illness, and it became his last work before his death in 1964. The monument was unveiled on 12 October 1963, on the 20th anniversary of the battle of Lenino. It was dedicated to the fallen soldiers of the First Polish Army who fought on the Eastern Front of the Second World War.\nCharacteristics\nThe monument is located in the Stalinism Political Prisoners Square (Polish: Skwer Więźniów Politycznych Stalinizmu), at Andersa Street and near the Krasiński Garden. It consists of a 8-metre-tall granite statue depicting a soldier of the Polish Armed Forces in the East, wearing a military uniform and helmet, and holding a machine gun near his chest. It is placed on a granite pedestal, with the following Polish inspiration: \"1943 – Lenino, Warszawa, Warsaw Kołobrzeg, Berlin – 1945\", marking the route of the army in the conflict.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
