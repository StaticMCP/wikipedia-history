He ravaged much of the countryside, including churches built by Fruela I of Asturias. Upon their return to Al-Andalus, in the valley of Camino Real del Puerto de la Mesa, they were set upon by King Alfonso II of Asturias and the forces under his command. The Asturian forces ambushed the Muslim army in a part of the valley near Grado, Asturias that has been considered by historians to be the area around Los Lodos. The battle resulted in an Asturian victory and the majority of the invading Muslim army was wiped out. Abd al-Malik was killed in the action.\nAftermath\nAfter the crushing defeat, Hisham sent a punitive expedition the next year headed by his brother  Abd al-Karim ibn Abd al-Walid ibn Mugaith, which defeated the Asturian army at the Battle of Las Babias and other engagements, and eventually conquered Oviedo. Once the winter of 795-796 set in, the Muslim troops retreated.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
