Its cornerstone was laid on May 30, 1889, and the monument dedicated on October 15, 1889. The monument is located in central Nashua within the triangle formed by Concord, Amherst, and Nashville streets.\nThe monument is a square, castellated column of New Hampshire granite from Nashua on a base of Quincy granite, atop which stands a figure of Victory, dressed in classical Roman garments and holding an American shield and a laurel wreath. Its base is ornamented with bronze statues of a soldier and sailor, and bronze reliefs depicting the Goddess of Liberty overseeing the reconciliation of the South with the North, an emancipation scene with a Union soldier extending a scroll to a kneeling figure, and the sinking of the Alabama by the Kearsarge. At its front is a sculpture of a saddle draped with cavalry clothing and equipment; at the rear is a sculpture of Civil War-era weapons.\nThe design for the monument was made by T. M. Perry, of Messrs. Frederick & Field, who carved the Victory, erected the monument, and did all its granite work. The sailor was modeled by S. J. O'Kelley and cast by Melzar Hunt Mosman. The soldier was modeled by Caspar Buberl and cast by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. The artillery sculpture was made and cast by Melzar Hunt Mosman, as were the Emancipation bas-relief and the two lettered panels. The statue of Victory, cavalry sculpture, and sinking of the Alabama were modeled by Beattie & Brooks.\n* On bronze plaque on lower front of monument:\nA TRIBUTE TO THE\nMEN OF NASHUA\nWHO SERVED THEIR COUNTRY\nON LAND OR SEA DURING\nTHE WAR OF THE\nREBELLION, AND AIDED IN PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY\nOF THE\nFEDERAL UNION.\nA.D. 1861-1865.\nERECTED BY THE\nCITY OF NASHUA,\nA.D. 1889\n* On bronze plaque on lower back of base:\n\"THE UNION OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS\nA MAIN PROP OF YOUR LIBERTY, AND THE\nLOVE OF THE ONE OUGHT TO ENDEAR TO\nYOU THE PRESERVATION OF THE OTHER.\"\nWASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS.\n\"OUR FEDERAL UNION: IT MUST BE PRESERVED.\"\nANDREW JACKSON.\n\"LIBERTY AND UNION, NOW AND FOREVER,\nONE AND INSEPARABLE.\"\nDANIEL WEBSTER\n\"THAT FROM THOSE HONORED DEAD, WE TAKE\nINCREASED DEVOTION TO THAT CAUSE FOR\nWHICH THEY GAVE THE LAST FULL MEASURE\nOF DEVOTION-THAT WE HERE HIGHLY RE-\nSOLVE THAT THESE DEAD SHALL NOT HAVE\nDIED IN VAIN-AND THAT GOVERNMENT OF\nTHE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEO-\nPLE, SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH.\"\nABRAHAM LINCOLN.\n\"LET US HAVE PEACE and a happy new year\nU.S.GRANT\n* On relief plaque on base:\nWITH MALICE TOWARD NONE\nWITH CHARITY FOR ALL\n* On relief plaque on base:\nSINKING OF THE ALABAMA BY THE KEARSARGE JUNE 19, 1864\nReferences\n* [https://archive.org/details/accountofsoldier00nash An account of the Soldiers' and sailors' monument...], Frank Gardner Noyes, Nashua, N.H., J.
