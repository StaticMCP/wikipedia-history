The O'Conor family held the throne of the Kingdom of Connacht up until 1475. Having ruled it on and off since 967, they ruled continuously from 1102 to 1475. Moreover, the O'Conor parent house the Uí Briúin and Síol Muireadaigh ruled Connacht on many occasions – but not continuously – between 482 and 956. The house of O'Conor also produced two High Kings of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair and his son Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, the last High King of Ireland. The family seat is Clonalis House outside Castlerea in County Roscommon.\nThe current O'Conor Don is Desmond O'Conor (b. 22 September 1938) who lives in Rotherfield, East Sussex in England.\nHistory\nThe Ó Conor Don is the head of a lineage which provided about one hundred Kings of Connacht, thirty Chiefs of the Name and two High Kings of Ireland, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156), and his son Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair (c. 1115–1198), the last High King.\nDuring the late 14th century, the Ó Conor dynasty was grouped into two main divisions, one led by Toirdhealbhach Óg Donn Ó Conchobair, the other by Felim MacAedh Ó Conchobair. From these descended the families of Ó Conchubhair Donn anglicized as O'Conor Don and Ó Conchubhair Ruadh anglicized as O'Conor Roe (now extinct). The O'Conor family like all Gaelic Nobility followed Brehon law system up until the 16th century. Therefore, they did not follow primogeniture. The Kings, or Chiefs of the O'Conor family would be elected by a close kinship group. This did frequently result in bitter feuds and lead to civil wars within the Kingdom, therefore at times dramatically weakening the family's power in Connacht and in Ireland.\nDescent from Conchobar mac Tadg, King of Connacht\n*Conchobar mac Tadg, King of Connacht and Eponym of the O'Conor's of Connacht.\n**Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg O’Conor, King of Connacht.\n***Dub Chablaigh O’Conor; she was a wife of Brian Boru.\n***Tadg in Eich Gil O’Conor, King of Connacht.\n****Áed in Gai Bernaig O’Conor, King of Connacht.\n*****Tadhg O’Conor (Slain in 1062).\n*****Ruaidrī na Saide Buide O’Conor, King of Connacht.\n******''Niall O'Conor (Killed in 1093).\n******Tadc O’Conor, King of Connacht (Killed in 1097).\n******Conchobhar O’Conor (Murdered in 1103).\n******Domnall O’Conor, King of Connacht\n******'Turlough Mor O'Conor, High King of Ireland and King of Connacht'; He had six wives and 26 children among them were:\n*******Conchobar O’Conor, King of Dublin & King of Meath (Killed at Bealach Muine-na-Siride, by Ua Dubhlaich, lord of Feara-Tulach in 1144)\n********Brian Mainech O’Conor, (Killed at the battle of Ath na caisberna in 1159)\n*******Aedh “Dall” O’Conor\n********Tommaltach O’Conor, Archbishop of Armagh (d. 1201)\n*******Ruaidhri O’Conor, Last High King of Ireland (d. 1198).
