The president directs the executive branch of the national government, is the commander-in-chief of the Kyrgyz military and also heads the National Security Council.\nThe president, according to the constitution, \"is the symbol of the unity of people and state power, and is the guarantor of the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, and of an individual and citizen.\"\nThe office of president was established in 1990 replacing the chairman of the Supreme Soviet that existed, in different forms, from 1936 whilst the country was known as the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic.\nThe first popularly elected officeholder was Askar Akayev, who served from October 1990 until 24 March 2005. In July 2005 after the Tulip Revolution, Kurmanbek Bakiyev was elected. He was re-elected in 2009, but large riots in April 2010 forced him to resign and flee the country.  Roza Otunbayeva was selected in April 2010 to head the interim government. She was officially inaugurated on 3 July 2010, as president for a limited term, until elections could be organised. Her successor, Almazbek Atambayev, was elected in the 2011 Kyrgyzstani presidential election and subsequently succeeded Otunbayeva on 1 December that year.\nOn 16 October 2017, Sooronbay Jeenbekov, the former prime minister, was elected president of the country. He took office on 24 November 2017. On 15 October 2020, Jeenbekov resigned following unrest over the parliamentary elections on 4 October. Jeenbekov was succeeded by Prime Minister Sadyr Japarov, who became acting president before being confirmed as the 6th and current president on 16 October, and officially held the post on 28 January 2021.\nOath of office\nOn assuming office, the president raises his/her right arm and puts it on the Kyrgyz Constitution while reciting the following oath:\n}}\nRussian Translation:\n}}\nEnglish Translation:\nElection\nQualifications\nThe office of president is open to all citizens of Kyrgyzstan who are no younger than 35 years of age, and no older than 65 years of age. A candidate must have a command of the state language, and have resided in the republic for no less than 15 years before the nomination of his or her candidacy for the position. The president cannot be a deputy of the Jogorku Kenesh (Parliament), occupy other positions, or carry out entrepreneurial activities, and must suspend activity in political parties and organizations for their period in office.\nOn taking office the president must take the following oath, stipulated by Article 45 of the constitution, within 30 days of election before the assembled members of the legislative chamber:\n}}\nElectoral law\nThe president is elected by the citizens of Kyrgyzstan by a majority of votes cast. These elections are held on the basis of universal suffrage, and by secret ballot. To become a candidate a person must obtain the signatures of fifty thousand registered voters.\nFor an election to be considered valid the turnout must not be lower than fifty percent. Similarly, if a candidate wins the backing of more than fifty percent of the voters who participated they are the winner. Should no candidate win an outright majority in the first round, the two candidates with the highest number of votes face each other in a second ballot.\nInauguration ceremony\nThe Inauguration ceremony of the president of Kyrgyzstan is a ceremony that takes place to mark the start of a new term for the president of Kyrgyzstan.\nList of inaugural ceremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
