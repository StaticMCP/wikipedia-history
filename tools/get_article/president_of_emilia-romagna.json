The Council and the president are linked by an alleged relationship of confidence: if the president resigns or he is dismissed by the Council, a snap election is called for both the legislative and the executive offices, because in no case the two bodies can be chosen separately.\nThe popular election of the president and the relationship of confidence between him and the legislature, allow to identify the Italian regions model of government as a particular form of semi-presidential system.\nPowers\nThe president of Emilia-Romagna promulgates regional laws and regulations. He can receive special administrative functions by the national government. The president is one of the eighty members of the Regional Council and, in this capacity, he can propose new laws.\nThe president appoints and dismiss the Regional Cabinet (called Giunta Regionale in Italian). The Cabinet is composed by no more than ten regional assessors (assessori, literally \"aldermen\") who can be members of the Council at the same time. Assessors should not be confused with the ministers: according to Italian administrative law, assessors only receive delegations from the president to rule a bureau or an agency, the Region being a single legal person, not divided in ministries. One assessor can be appointed Vice President. The president can also appoint four under-secretaries (sottosegretari) to help the president in his functions.\nThe Regional Cabinet prepares the budget, appoints the boards of public regional agencies and companies, manages assets, develops projects of governance, and resorts to the Constitutional Court of Italy if it thinks that a national law may violate regional powers. The president and the Cabinet are two different authorities of the Region: in matters within its competence, the Cabinet has the power to vote to give its approval.\nRegional Cabinet\nThe Regional Cabinet is currently composed by the president and ten regional assessors.\nTimeline\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1970\nLegend     = columns:1 left:205 top:35 columnwidth:75\nTextData =\npos:(20,40) textcolor:black fontsize:M\ntext:\"Political parties:\"\nBarData =\nbar:Fanti\nbar:Cavina\nbar:Turci\nbar:Guerzoni\nbar:Boselli\nbar:Bersani\nbar:LaForgia\nbar:Errani\nbar:Bonaccini\nbar:DePascale\nPlotData=\nwidth:5 align:left fontsize:M shift:(5,-4) anchor:till\nbar:Fanti\nfrom: 29/07/1970 till: 21/08/1976 color:pci text:\"Fanti\" fontsize:10\nbar:Cavina\nfrom: 21/08/1976 till: 22/12/1977 color:pci text:\"Cavina\" fontsize:10\nbar:Turci\nfrom: 06/01/1978 till: 28/04/1987 color:pci text:\"Turci\" fontsize:10\nbar:Guerzoni\nfrom: 23/03/1987 till: 24/06/1990 color:pci text:\"Guerzoni\" fontsize:10\nbar:Boselli\nfrom: 06/05/1990 till: 05/07/1993 color:psi text:\"Boselli\" fontsize:10\nbar:Bersani\nfrom: 05/07/1993 till: 17/05/1996 color:pci text:\"Bersani\" fontsize:10\nbar:LaForgia\nfrom: 17/05/1996 till: 03/03/1999 color:pci text:\"La Forgia\" fontsize:10\nbar:Errani\nfrom: 03/03/1999 till: 30/08/2014 color:pd text:\"Errani\" fontsize:10\nbar:Bonaccini\nfrom: 24/11/2014 till: 12/07/2024 color:pd text:\"Bonaccini\" fontsize:10\nbar:DePascale\nfrom: 13/12/2024 till: end color:pd text:\"De Pascale\" fontsize:10\n}}\nSee also\n*List of presidents of Emilia-Romagna\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.regione.emilia-romagna.it/]"
