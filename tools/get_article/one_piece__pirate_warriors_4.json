It also features four new multiplayer modes called Giant Boss Battle, Total Bounty Battle, Timed Defense Battle, and Territory Battle.\nOriginal story\nThis story adapts numerous story arcs from the original manga series, but the plot of the Wano Country arc was modified significantly due to its incompletion at the time of its release.

As the battle intensifies between Big Mom and Kaido, a new enemy appears in the form of Blackbeard and his crew. Fighting Blackbeard, Big Mom, and Kaido's crew, players are met with a final battle against Kaido who turns into a dragon after defeating Big Mom, Blackbeard, and Kaido's underlings.
