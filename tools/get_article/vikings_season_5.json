Harald's men free him and capture Astrid; they leave Kattegat and Harald offers Astrid the same proposition that he had to Lagertha. Prince Alfred has a vision in which Athelstan tells him the Vikings are in York, so King Aethelwulf joins forces with Bishop Heahmund.

Bjorn rejects Torvi and proposes to marry Snæfrid, Svase's daughter. Lagertha and her allies discuss how to respond to Ivar's attack, and decide to meet him in battle on land, assuming that he will not attack the town from the sea. Margrethe continues to urge Ubbe to betray Lagertha, so that when she is defeated, he can become King.\n| LineColor       = 1A2125\n}}\n| ShortSummary    = Alfred returns from Lindisfarne, and argues that the Saxons must build a navy as the only way to stop further Viking incursions.

Meanwhile, the armies of Lagertha, Bjorn, and Ubbe, and of Harald, Ivar, and Hvitserk, meet above Kattegat. Lagertha proposes peace talks, but Harald, then Ivar, reject a settlement. Before battle, Ivar takes Astrid and a third of their army towards shore, to protect their fleet. Hvitserk and his group try to flank, but are ambushed in the forest by the Sámi.

When Thorgrim is found dead, Floki proposes that he himself be sacrificed to the gods. In Kattegat, Margrethe meets the Seer and reveals her ambitions to become queen. The Seer calls her mad and predicts that she will never be queen of Kattegat. The army of Lagertha faces those of Ivar and Harald.

Ivar and Hvitserk celebrate their victory; Harald is mourning Astrid and is haunted by his murder of Halfdan. Rollo arrives and Ivar tells him that Lagertha, Bjorn, and Ubbe have vanished. Rollo guesses that they are hiding in the same hut he had sought shelter in decades earlier. Rollo urges Lagertha and Bjorn to return with him to Frankia, revealing himself to be Bjorn's biological father. Bjorn rejects both Rollo's offer and Rollo as his father. Ivar finds the hut, but Lagertha and her followers have already left, leaving a crazed Margrethe behind. They steal a boat and sail for England. Meanwhile, in Iceland the settlers vote on whether to sacrifice Floki; Eyvind's son Helgi gives the deciding vote against.

Alfred chooses to leave judgement of Heahmund to God, to the dismay of his nobles. Heahmund spreads the story that Aethelred might be leader of a conspiracy against Alfred. Harald leaves Kattegat for York to prepare a raid on Wessex. He manipulates Ivar's governor Olavsonn into supporting him in his future plan to invade Kattegat. In Iceland, Floki manages to unite the feuding families over the expected child of Helgi and Thorunn, a daughter of Kjetill. However, soon afterwards Thorunn vanishes. In Kattegat, Hvitserk is furious about Margrethe's murder.

This season was produced by Keith Thompson for the first four and last four episodes, and Liz Gill for the fifth to sixteenth episodes. Bill Goddard and Séamus McInerney are co-producers.\nThe production team for this season includes casting directors Frank and Nuala Moiselle, costume designer Susan O'Connor Cave, visual effects supervisor Dominic Remane, stunt action designer Richard Ryan, composer Trevor Morris, production designer Mark Geraghty, editors Aaron Marshall for the first, third, fifth, tenth, fourteenth, seventeenth and twentieth episodes, Tad Seaborn for the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, thirteenth, sixteenth and nineteenth episodes, Michele Conroy for the seventh, ninth and eleventh episodes, Dan Briceno for the twelfth episode, and Don Cassidy for the fifteenth and eighteenth episodes and cinematographers PJ Dillon for the first and second episodes, Peter Robertson for the third, fourth, and seventh to sixteenth episodes, Suzie Lavelle for the fifth, sixth, seventeenth and eighteenth episodes, and Owen McPolin for the nineteenth and twentieth episodes.\nCasting\nAt the same time that the series was renewed for a fifth season, it was announced that Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers would be joining the cast, as Heahmund, a \"warrior bishop\". Vikings creator Michael Hirst, explained: \"I was looking at the history books, and I came across these warrior bishops. The antecedents of the Knights Templar: these are people who were absolutely religious, yet they put on armor and they fought. Don't let their priestly status fool you, either. They were crazy! They believed totally in Christianity and the message, and yet, on the battlefield, they were totally berserk.\"\nFormer WWE star Adam Copeland was cast in a recurring role for the fifth season, as Kjetill Flatnose, a violent and bold warrior. He is chosen by Floki to join an expedition to set up a colony in a new land. Irish actor Darren Cahill plays the role of Aethelred in the fifth season. Nigerian actor Stanley Amuzie told local media he had landed a small role in the fifth season. The fifth season also includes Irish actor, musician and real-life police detective, Kieran O'Reilly, who plays the role of White Hair. In April 2017 it was announced that Danish actor Erik Madsen had joined the cast for the fifth season, as King Hemming.

The consensus reads: \"Brutal battles and epic quests help Vikings' fifth season remain an engaging, exciting journey.\" IGN awarded episode 10, \"Moments of Vision\", with a rating of 9 out of 10. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an \"A\".\nThe second half of the season drew some criticism.  Writing in Forbes, Erik Kain said: \"the show continues to falter, an unfortunate mix of melodrama, one-note characters and absurd fantasy parading as historical fiction\" and that the show \"has simply lost its way\". In \"A Simple Story\", Aethelred is portrayed rejecting the throne in favour of his younger brother Alfred. In history, after the death of Aethelwulf, three of Alfred's elder brothers ruled, for two, five and six years respectively, all dying before Alfred took the throne in 871. Writing in Forbes, Erik Kain described the storyline as \"just a huge unforced error\".\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
