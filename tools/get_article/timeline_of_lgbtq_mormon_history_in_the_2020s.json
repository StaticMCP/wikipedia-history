The book addresses LGBTQ questions from a scripture-based Latter-day Saint perspective.\n*January – The Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing implements a statewide ban on conversion therapy for minors, with public support from the church. A previous version of the ban was proposed and received public opposition from the church, which in a public statement said that the ban “fails to protect individual religious beliefs and does not account for important realities of gender identity in the development of children.”\n*February – A Walk in My Shoes by Ben Schilaty was published. The author, a gay therapist and Brigham Young University (BYU) administrator, answers questions frequently asked of him as a gay Latter-day Saint.\n*February – The church released the new version of its leadership handbook, General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It defines gender as \"biological sex at birth\" and states that any kind of gender transition—whether that includes a change of name or pronouns, \"elective medical or surgical intervention,\" or even gendered dress—will bring about \"Church membership restrictions\" until the person ceases their gender transition. Transgender people may enter temples and attend meetings, but certain restrictions will apply, such as the ineligibility of transgender men for the priesthood. At the same time, the handbook reflected the previously announced policy regarding children of same-sex couples, now allowing these children to be blessed and baptized without limitations that previously existed.\n*February – BYU released an updated honor code intended to align with the church's new handbook. The previous honor code specifically noted prohibiting hand-holding and kissing between same-sex couples. The updated honor code does not contain the section about \"homosexual behavior.\" The school, however, clarified that \"Even though we have removed the more prescriptive language, the principles of the Honor Code remain the same.\" The clarification prompted large protests by BYU students.\n*March – A chapter of Affirmation was established by students and faculty at BYU–Hawaii. Later that year Iese Wilson, a music education major at the school and vice president of the Affirmation chapter, met with president John S. K. Kauwe III and Student Life Vice President Jonathan Kau to discuss the experiences of LGBTQ students on campus. This conversation was followed by a social media post by Wilson, which sparked greater conversation about the LGBTQ experience at BYU–Hawaii.\n*March – Homosexuality Reframed: Growth Beyond Gay was published by Thomas Pritt, a Latter-day Saint therapist. The book discusses how someone who identifies as gay can move past their current sexual orientation.\n*March – Questions from the Closet, a podcast hosted by Ben Schilaty and Charlie Bird, was launched. The podcast addresses common questions about LGBTQ issues in the church.\n*April – On the Record: A Chronology of LGBTQ+ Messaging within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints had its first release by Latter Gay Stories host Kyle Ashworth. The document provides a timeline and sources for the progression of church messaging about LGBTQ people.\n*May – Emmaus LGBTQ Ministry was established as a nonprofit support group for LGBTQ Latter-day Saints.

It was founded as an alternative group to Mormons Building Bridges, due to a difference in priorities.\n*June – Dog Valley had its initial showing at the Kanab Film Festival.

Bergin, a former BYU psychology professor and former member of the church’s general Sunday School board, offered a public apology for past teachings on same-sex attraction.

Department of Education was launched as a class-action lawsuit by LGBTQ students and alumni of various religious schools in the United States.

The comment came after an exchange between Smith and others regarding the excommunication of Natasha Helfer, where Burke made comments that were critical of Smith and far-right DezNat affiliated accounts in the same thread. After receiving backlash for the post, Smith removed it and offered an apology.

In his coming out post, Archuleta urged people of faith to \"be more understanding and compassionate to those who are LGBTQIA+.\" Archuleta's coming out brought more attention to the Church's ban on same-sex marriage and relationships. Several months later Archuleta released a video talking about how being LGBTQ and in the church was having an effect on his faith and mental health.\n*June – A recurring workshop class for LGBTQ individuals and allies began at the Utah Valley University Institute of Religion, the first such class in the Church Educational System.

Holland also indirectly targeted 2019 BYU valedictorian Matt Easton for coming out during his convocation speech, saying \"If a student commandeers a graduation podium intended to represent everyone getting diplomas in order to announce his personal sexual orientation, what might another speaker feel free to announce the next year until eventually anything goes?\" Holland continued by accusing Easton of \"divisiveness.\" According to Easton's response to Holland's speech in the Salt Lake Tribune, Easton's valedictorian address was pre-approved by the University. During a later interview on Mormon Stories with John Dehlin, Easton claimed that Elder Holland responded to an email from Easton’s father, where he offered an apology to Easton’s parents for hurting their feelings, and admonished them to continue being active in the church and paying tithing. In a Church News podcast with Sheri Dew 3 years later, Elder Holland acknowledged pain caused to both him and LGBTQ people after his address. He also asserted his love for them, as well as his teaching of doctrine in the address.\n*August – Former North Ogden mayor candidate Gregory Smith made a tweet saying “Time to get our muskets” in response to an LGBTQ-related post.

The CAA (Council of Academic Accreditation) later informed BYU that they were under formal investigation for discrimination.\n*January - The Salt Lake Tribune reported a non-binary BYU graduate did not report being sexually assaulted as a student by their BYU teaching assistant in part because of fear of how the Honor Code office may surveil and distrust non-cisgender students, as well as assault victims.\n*February – The church publicly supported a bipartisan LGBTQ non-discrimination bill in Arizona, joining a coalition of faith and community leaders.\n*March – Listen, Learn and Love: Improving Latter-Day Saint Culture by Richard Ostler was published.

Oaks said that “the Lord has required His restored Church to oppose social and legal pressures to retreat from His doctrine of marriage between a man and a woman, to oppose changes that homogenize the differences between men and women or confuse or alter gender… Our Heavenly Father’s plan allows for ‘opposition in all things’, and Satan’s most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to that plan. Consequently, he seeks to oppose progress toward exaltation by distorting marriage, discouraging childbearing, and confusing gender.”\n*April – Tender Leaves of Hope: Finding Belonging as LGBTQ Latter-day Saint Women by Meghan Decker was published, reflecting on her experience as a gay woman in the Church.\n*April – The Miracle of Forgiveness Art Gala was held in Trolley Square, Salt Lake City.

At the same time, ignoring God’s laws has never been the Savior’s pattern for showing love. Remember, Jesus asked us to love God first.”\n*June – The church filed an amicus brief in the 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis case, where a Colorado web developer argued she shouldn’t be compelled to make a website for a same-sex wedding.

Oaks publicly explained the church’s position several months later saying that the law keeps religious organizations from being forced to perform or celebrate same-sex marriages, protects their tax-exempt status, and protects accreditations of religious schools.\n*November – But Jesus: A Conversation by Autumn McAlpin was published.

Oaks read a letter from an anonymous 16-year-old Latter-day Saint girl expressing concern about LGBTQ issues among youth, including gender identity and same-sex relationships. Part of the letter reads: ”I truly don’t understand why so many youth in our church don’t see any problem with people changing their gender every other day, dating people who are the same sex, or identify as no gender. At ward or stake youth activities, I am asked my pronouns, or at school I am asked to dance with a girl who thinks she is a boy. I know we are supposed to love everyone and show them respect, and I always do. I just feel that there is a line being crossed.

Their marriage celebration included the appearance of BYU’s mascot Cosmo the Cougar. The Cougar Chronicle later published an article calling into question the appearance of the mascot, writing “The invocation of school symbolism and even religious symbolism and language can be problematic for those attempting to understand the true value system of the institution. If Cosmo appears at an event, is it an endorsement of the event? … So we ask the reader, should Cosmo have attended Charlie’s wedding?”\n*August – An explicit prohibition on “same-sex romantic behavior” was re-introduced to the BYU Honor Code, after it had previously been removed in February, 2020.\n*September – Former bishop Richard Ostler published Listen, Learn, and Love: Building the Good Ship Zion, detailing how Latter-Day Saints can be more inclusive in the church.\n*September – The first Gather Conference, hosted by the Lift + Love Foundation, was held in Provo, Utah, featuring LGBTQ and Latter-Day Saint voices.\n*October – In General Conference, President Russell M.

His response drew more criticism for not being explicit enough in supporting the Proclamation.\n*January – The Mormon Stories channel, hosted by John Dehlin, released a video titled “A New Norm?
