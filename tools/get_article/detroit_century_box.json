Maybury organized the capsule which consists of a copper box filled with photos and letters containing the then current state of affairs in Detroit along with predictions for the future. Mayor Dennis Archer presided over the opening of the capsule on December 31, 2000.\nContents\nAt midnight on January 1, 2000, Mayor Archer opened the copper \"century box\" before a ceremony of Detroiters and read a handwritten letter that Mayor Maybury wrote a century earlier. \"How much faster are you traveling? How much farther have you annihilated time and space and what agencies are you employing to which we are strangers?\".\n\"May we be permitted to express one supreme hope - that whatever failures the coming century may have in the progress of things material, you may be conscious when the century is over that, as a nation, people and city, you have grown in righteousness, for it is this that exalts a nation.\"\nDetroit in 1900\n}}\nPredictions for the future\n}}\n}}\nNotable letter writers\n*Annie M.
