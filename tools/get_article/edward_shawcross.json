His research has focused on French imperialism in Latin America and intellectual trends in the Second Mexican Empire. His first book The Last Emperor of Mexico, based on the life of Emperor Maximilian, was well-received in the British press as well as the Wall Street Journal in the U.S.  It received praise from among others, British historian of Mexico Matthew Restall, and Martyn Rady, author of The Hapsburgs. The book was listed in the Sunday Times Best History Books of the Year 2022. The subtitles of The Last Emperor of Mexico differ, with the U.S. edition, published by Basic Books in 2021, subtitled The Dramatic Story of the Habsburg Archduke Who Created a Kingdom in the New World, while the 2022 U.K. edition by Faber & Faber is subtitled A Disaster in the New World.\nReferences"
