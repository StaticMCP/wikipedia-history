Each year, each participating command sends their best enlisted soldier and non-commissioned officer to Fort Gregg-Adams to represent their unit.\nDuring the competition, competitors are tested for their aptitude through board interviews, physical fitness tests, written exams, urban warfare simulations and other soldier tasks and drills relevant to the Army's operating environment.\nIn addition, Warriors will go before two selection boards composed of six senior sergeants major from across the Army. These boards, chaired by Sergeant Major of the Army Kenneth O. Preston, evaluate competitor appearance, military bearing and knowledge of critical Army topics.\nThe Soldier and Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year receive prestigious honors and cash awards in recognition of their achievements and represent the Army at special events throughout the year.\nCompetition winners\nand SSG James Luby on Fox and Friends]]\nSoldier of the Year\n* 2002 - Spc.
