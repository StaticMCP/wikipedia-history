A month later on 23 July 1941, the Rapid Group was reorganized into a division after the Battle of Lypovec. During the Battle of the Caucasus, the division was encircled at Saratowskaya, but managed to escape to the Kuban bridgehead. However, the division was forced to leave behind all their heavy equipment and weapons in order to escape. The division was then destroyed during the Melitopol offensive with 2,600 soldiers of the division becoming prisoners of war. The division was reformed in early 1944. The reformed division was used to protect communication lines. The division participated in the Odessa Offensive. The division surrendered to Soviet forces in March 1945.\nReferences"
