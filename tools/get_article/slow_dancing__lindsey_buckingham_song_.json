Despite receiving power rotation on MTV, \"Slow Dancing\" failed to make the  Billboard Hot 100, although it did reach number 6 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, an extension to the Hot 100. 34 years after its release, \"Slow Dancing\" was performed live for the first time.\n\"Slow Dancing\" possesses a 4/4 dance beat with a heavy reliance on computer sounds, particularly the 8 bit Fairlight CMI. Buckingham said in a 2018 interview with Stereogum that \"Slow Dancing\" explores the idea of striving for human connection through romantic aspirations. Early in the song's development, Buckingham had the idea of concluding \"Slow Dancing\" with a classical-inspired 3/4 waltz, and this concept was ultimately kept in the final version of the song.\nCritical reception\nSeveral months before \"Slow Dancing\" was released as a single, the Los Angeles Times earmarked the song as ''Go Insane's \"best shot at the charts\". Billboard'' described \"Slow Dancing\" as a \"new bit of creative insanity\" and wrote that the song's \"lurching dance beat is set in a mix that goes to unsettling extremes.\" Rolling Stone commented that \"Slow Dancing's \"whipcrack backbeat kicks \"Slow Dancing\" out of the living room and onto the dance floor where it belongs.\"\nMusic video\nSimilar to \"Go Insane\", the video for \"Slow Dancing\" was shot in England and the video's special effects were done by David Yardley. Buckingham thought that the filming for \"Slow Dancing\" was more elaborate than music video for \"Trouble\", particularly in regards to the number of shots, rhythm of the editing, and the use of effects. The video for \"Slow Dancing\" was released to MTV on November 17, 1984. In 1985, \"Slow Dancing\" was nominated for three awards at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards: Most Experimental Video, Best Special Effects in a Video, and Best Editing in a Video, although it did not win any of these categories.\nAccolades\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 1985\n| rowspan=\"3\" | MTV Award\n| Best Special Effects in a Video\n|\n|-\n| Best Editing in a Video\n|\n|-\n| Most Experimental Video\n|\n|}\nPersonnel\n*Lindsey Buckingham – all instruments, vocals\nChart performance\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
