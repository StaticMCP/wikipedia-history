Originally published in 2 French volumes, ''L'Enlisement and L'Humiliation'', it was combined into a single book and translated by Patrick O'Brian.\nLucien Bodard was one of the best-known French foreign correspondents and was an expert on Indochina; he knew the Far East as few Europeans could know it, for not only did he spend most of his working life there but he was born in Chongqing.\nReferences"
