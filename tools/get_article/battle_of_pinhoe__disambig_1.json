They then started pillaging nearby villages, and were met at Pinhoe by an army from the shires of Devon and Somerset. The battle was hard and the defenders nearly used up all their ammunition.\nThe priest of Pinhoe\nA priest of Pinhoe wanted to resupply the troops with ammunition. He sneaked through the Danish lines and ran to Exeter to get arrows and arms. He successfully returned to the defenders and supplied them with the weapons.\nThe burning of Pinhoe\nThe weapons were not sufficient for the local defenders to defeat the Vikings. The Vikings infiltrated Pinhoe and burned it to the ground. This was as a warning for the citizens of Exeter.\nThe legacy of the priest\nThe priest was awarded for his outstanding bravery an annual payment of 16 shillings. It was said that this sum was still paid to the Vicar of Pinhoe in Victorian times.\nReferences"
