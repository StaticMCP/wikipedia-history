The bay was named by Lieutenant James Cook of  in 1770 after James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton, who was President of the Royal Society and was influential in obtaining the grant that enables Cook's voyage. The misspelling of the name Morton as Moreton occurred in the published records of the voyage.\nWith increasing amounts of shipping coming into Moreton Bay during the 1840s, the New South Wales Government decided to build a lighthouse on the north-east corner of the island (Cape Moreton). It was designed by architect Edmund Blacket in 1854 and completed in 1857.  The Cape Moreton Lighthouse is the oldest lighthouse in Queensland and the only one built prior to the Separation of Queensland and the establishment of the Queensland Government in 1859. It is also the only lighthouse in Queensland built from stone. It is still operational.\nMoreton Island State School opened circa 1876, being renamed Bulwer State School in 1878. In 1891, it was downgraded to Bulwer Provisional School, but by 1895 was Bulwer State School again. When the pilot station families were relocated in 1909, the school was closed.\nCape Moreton Provisional School opened on 28 August 1876 but closed in 1884. It reopened on 15 February 1886 and permanently closed in December 1925.\nDemographics\nIn the , Moreton Island had a population of 243 people.\nIn the , Moreton Island had a population of 180 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools on the island.
