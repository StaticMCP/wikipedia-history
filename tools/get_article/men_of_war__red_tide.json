Game concept and scenario are elaborated by Alexander Zorich, modern Russian writer and scenarist. The game's single player focuses on the Soviet Naval Infantry of the Black Sea Fleet during the Crimean campaign. The arsenals of two more countries, Italy and Romania, are also introduced to the series.\nGameplay\nMost of the gameplay features from the first Men Of War were reused in Red Tide, with several small bug fixes and tweaks to make it more enjoyable. In campaign mode, missions are generally longer and more difficult than the ones in its predecessor.\nThe Soviet Union is the only playable faction in campaign mode. Other factions (Italy, Germany and Romania) can be used in the editor. The editor is only accessible through some work with the games files. Red Tide does not include a multiplayer mode however. The game features one of the largest campaigns in the series with a total of 28 missions divided into 6 campaigns. There is also a large historical encyclopedia with information on the Black Sea Fleet and the battles for Odessa, Sevastopol, etc.\nPlot\nThe game is divided into 6 campaigns. Each mission represents 1 or several battles and starts with an intro to the scene. The first mission of the campaign also has an intro informing the player of the historical situation.\n* Campaign I: Odessa Must be Ours\n* Campaign II: The Crimean Offensive\n* Campaign III: Manstein's Big Guns\n* Campaign IV: Breaching the Blue Line\n* Campaign V: Company of Heroes\n* Campaign VI: The Black Sea is Ours\nReception\nMen of War: Red Tide has received mixed reviews. It received a Metacritic score of 74 based on seven reviews. Absolute Games gave the game a score of 75, stating that \"a good single-player campaign is a rarity these days\". GameShark gave it a score of 50, stating that while the \"solo game is decent\", it loses its edge without the multiplayer ability. Jim Rossignol of Rock, Paper, Shotgun had praised the voice acting in the game.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
