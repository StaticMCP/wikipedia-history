At the 2010 Census, its population was&nbsp;2,245.\nEtymology\nThe literal meaning of both the Russian and Sakha language names is the \"white mountain\".\nHistory\nIt was founded in 1974 as the administrative center of Abyysky District, to replace the previous settlement of Druzhina, which was located  upstream on the Indigirka and was often subject to flooding. It was granted urban-type settlement status in 1975.\nAdministrative and municipal status\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Belaya Gora serves as the administrative center of Abyysky District. As an administrative division, the urban-type settlement of Belaya Gora is incorporated within Abyysky District as the Settlement of Belaya Gora. As a municipal division, the Settlement of Belaya Gora is incorporated within Abyysky Municipal District as Belaya Gora Urban Settlement.\nTransportation\nBelaya Gora is not connected to the outside world by any year-round roads. A winter road following the Indigirka, partially on the ice of the river when frozen, passes through, allowing for travel downstream to Chokurdakh and upstream to Ust-Nera via Khonuu. Another route exists, which leads west from Belaya Gora, up the valley of the Uyadina, to the mining settlement of Deputatsky; however, this route is no longer maintained.\nThe Belaya Gora Airport is located a short distance to the northeast.\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\n*Official website of the Sakha Republic.
