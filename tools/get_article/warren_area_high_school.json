The campus includes the Warren Area Elementary Center (Grades K–4). After graduating from Beaty-Warren Middle School (Grades 5–8), students proceed to Warren Area High School (Grades 9–12).\nWAHS was established long before 1961. The current campus was built in 1961. The predecessor graduated its last class that year. Its third story was condemned as a fire hazard in 1928 and restored to functioning in 1959. Today it has 2½ stories (the \"pit\", the first floor and second floor) as well as a basement, and consists of a gymnasium, cafeteria, auditorium, courtyard, study hall, library, 2 lobbies and much more. WAHS is owned and operated by the Warren County School District.\nThe school underwent a major renovation, which was completed in 2018.  The new campus features a new media center, gymnasium, band and choir rooms, aesthetics, and classrooms.\nHistory and Renovation\nThe old Warren High School was built in 1896-97 and was located in the city of Warren at the corner of 2nd Avenue and Market Street.\nThat building went out of use in 1960, as a new school had been built in 1958 at the present day location of 345 East Fifth Avenue. The old building was razed in 1961.\nIn 2018, a twenty-five million dollar renovation was completed by architect Buchart Horn to update the exterior and interior.\nIn 2025 the high school of Sheffield Area Middle/High School closed, and high school students there were rezoned to Warren Area High School.\nExtracurriculars\nThe district offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and sports.\nSports that are interscholastic are boys and girls tennis, wrestling, football, boys and girls swimming/diving, boys and girls golf, soccer, boys and girls basketball, softball, baseball, girls volleyball, cross country, and track and field.
