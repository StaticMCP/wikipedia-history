In 2012, she was elected to the Nebraska Legislature, representing an Omaha district.\nHoward was born in Omaha in 1981, the daughter of Gwen Howard and David Howard; her father was killed in a car accident before her birth.  She graduated from Omaha's Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart in 1999.  In 2003, she received a B.A. from Smith College; in 2008, a J.D. from Loyola University Chicago School of Law.  From 2009 to 2011, she worked as a staff attorney for the Illinois Maternal and Child Health Coalition, then moved to Omaha, where she worked as a development specialist for OneWorld Community Health Centers.\nGwen Howard served two terms in the Nebraska Legislature, representing the 9th District in midtown Omaha.  Because of Nebraska's term-limits law, she was ineligible to run for a third consecutive term in the 2012 election.  Sara Howard, who had been her mother's campaign manager, ran for the seat.  In the nonpartisan primary, Howard received 56.6% of the vote; Erica Fish, 30.1%; and Vernon Joseph Davis, 13.3%.  As the top two vote-getters, Howard, a member of the Democratic Party, and Fish, a Republican, moved on to the general election.  Howard won the seat, with 66% of the vote to Fish's 34%.\nIn the Legislature's 2015 session, Howard was appointed to the Banking, Commerce, and Insurance Committee, and to the Health and Human Services Committee.\nReferences\n}}\nExternal links\n*[http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/135508/sara-howard#.UkcrCYbryu8 Vote Smart page]\n*[http://journalstar.com/legislature/state-sen-sara-howard-in-her-own-words/article_5c86a371-f227-519a-9e01-55fc14f446ac.html \"State Sen.
