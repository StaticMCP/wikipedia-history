The Titans look like Gods but have dark orange helmets and their skin is a rock color. There appear to be more Titans in the film than in actual mythology.\n* In the Disney 1997 animated film Hercules there are five Titans. Four of them embody the four classical elements: The Rock Titan, The Ice Titan, The Lava Titan, and the Tornado Titan. A fifth Titan, the one-eyed Cyclops, is not associated with any element. They terrorize the earth until Zeus imprisons them; however, Hades later releases them to aid in his attempt to usurp Zeus. These Titans bear little similarity to their mythological counterparts. Later, in the animated series, the Titan Kronos is mentioned. The Disney versions of the Titans also appear in various games in the Disney-Square Enix video game franchise Kingdom Hearts.\n*In the 1981 film Clash of the Titans, the Kraken, actually an entity from Norse mythology, is presented as \"the last Titan\". It also describes the usage of the head of Medusa, who is actually a Gorgon, to fight him, as \"a titan against another titan\". In the 2010 remake, the Titans are mentioned at the beginning, when it is claimed Hades created the Kraken to defeat them. Kronos appears in the sequel Wrath of the Titans, where Ares turned to darkness and planned to revive his grandfather with Zeus' life force.\n* The Italian sword-and-sandal film Arrivano i titani shows the Titans first as prisoners in Tartarus, but they are later liberated by Zeus to take down the megalomanic King Cadmus.\n* The video game series God of War, which is based on Greek mythology, features many of the Titans, mainly Gaia, Cronos and Atlas. They attempt to reignite their Great War with the Olympians with the help of a Spartan warrior named Kratos, who became the God of War after killing Ares and sought vengeance against the Olympians after their king Zeus, later revealed to be his biological father betrayed him. They serve as allies in God of War II, but become antagonists in God of War III following Gaia's betrayal.\n* The Titans appeared in an episode of Charmed titled \"Oh My Goddess\" where Cronus, Demtrieus and Meta battled the Charmed Ones who became Goddesses. Eventually, the Titans were destroyed by Piper Halliwell.\n* The Titans occasionally appear or are mentioned in Renaissance Pictures' Hercules/Xena franchise. In the Xena: Warrior Princess episode \"The Titans,\" many Titans (far more than in the actual myths) were turned to stone by the Olympians, which Crius, Hyperion and Theia seek to undo. In the Hercules: The Legendary Journeys episode \"Let There Be Light,\" it is said that the Titans successfully defeated Dahak, but the battle left them too weak to resist the Olympians. Also, in the Hercules series finale \"Full Circle,\" Oceanus, Helios and Atlas appear, having made a deal with Ares to destroy the Olympians but spare him.\n* Titan appears as a regular Earth-based summon in the video game series Final Fantasy.\n*The Titans are a race of Eternals (gods) in the Warcraft universe. They are depicted as tall figures with metallic-colored skin. They defeated the Old Gods, who originally ruled Azeroth long ago, before the invasion of the Burning Legion.\n* In the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000, Titans are phenomenally large war machines, capable of laying waste to entire armies and cities with their colossal weapons. They are often referred to as \"god-Machines\" by Imperial forces, for they are virtually unstoppable (generally the only threat to a Titan on the battlefield is a Chaos Titan, or similar constructs created by other races).\n* The largest class of combat vessels in the MMORPG Eve Online are classified as 'titans', and several of the Gallente faction vessels are named after Greek deities.\n* In the series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, the Titans are the main villains, attempting to take over Olympus and rule civilization once more, after most of them were imprisoned in the Underworld.\n*In DC Comics the Titans were exiled to another world after their defeat, which they called New Cronos. Kronos, however, was imprisoned in a tree.

They call themselves Titans and their reign the Time of Titans.\n* The popular Age of Empires Spin-off, Age of Mythology at first only contains three civilizations and mythologies: The Norse, the Greeks, and the Egyptians. Added in later in an equally-popular expansion, a fourth civilization was added, Atlantis, which worshipped the Titans. They are portrayed, as a whole, largely neutral with some Titans even switching sides at some points in the game for no reason. There are three Major Titans that can be worshipped: Chronos, Gaia, and Ouranos. Gaia is shown generally as good, Chronos as evil. Ouranos is mostly portrayed as a good force, but at one point in the game, his followers are on the evil side, however later still being the major god of the protagonists in one of the final battles.\n* In the Brütal Legend video game, Titans are a race of benevolent creatures who invented music and left it for the modern world.\n* In the Dennou Boukenki Webdiver, there is the final giant robot named Ditalion, which based on a Titan.\n* The primary antagonists in the manga and anime series Attack on Titan are called \"Titans\" and are depicted as a species of mindless giants that attack and eat humans on sight.

Despite being referred to as Titans, their Japanese name (Kyojin) translates to Giant rather than Titan.\n* In the manga Saint Seiya Episode.G, the Titans are important villains, attempting to rule civilization once more, and Leo Aiolia and the Gold Saints are assigned to stop them.\n* The videogame Titan Quest tells the story of how the Telkine manage to cut off the gods from the mortal realms and attempt to free Typhon (identified in the game as a Titan) to have him assault Mount Olympus, with the player being a Greek soldier rising to the challenge and defending the world from the onslaught of mythological beasts and monsters.\n* The videogame franchise Borderlands features various references to the Titans throughout each installment in the series. In the story, four characters called Vault Hunters end up on a planet called Pandora to search for a mythical alien Vault. The Vault is said to contain a cache of rare and powerful weapons. The Vault Hunters aren’t the only ones after this legendary stash. Among the others are the Atlas and Hyperion Corporations. The Hyperion Corporation builds a massive, H-shaped space station in Pandora’s orbit called Helios on which a fair portion of gameplay takes place in the third game of the franchise, Borderlands The Pre-Sequel. One of the playable characters for this game is a “gladiator” known as Athena, who is an ex-employee of the now non-existent Atlas Corporation.\n* The videogame Catacomb Abyss (1992) features a level called The Battleground of the Titans, with the two titan races being trolls and demons.\n* In the MonsterVerse, Godzilla, King Kong and other kaiju are referred to as Titans. They are enormous animals that originate from inside the Hollow Earth, which they use to travel across the planet's surface to reclaim the world they once ruled, clashing with humanity.\n* In the animated television series The Owl House, Titans are shown to be an enormous extinct canine species, with King Clawthorne, one of the show's main characters and a juvenile, being the last of his kind.\n* The videogame Hades, which is based on Greek mythology, features many references of the Titans, but is the sequel, Hades II, who actually portraits them, Hecate as the protagonist (Melinoe) headmistress and foster mother, Selene as one her allies, and Chronos as the final boss of the game.\n* In Honkai: Star Rail, the Titans are a group of gods born from the Coreflames sent down by the gods of Amphoreus. Each Titan has an associated Coreflame, and whoever conquers the Coreflame's Trial could inherit the Titan's power and become the demigod. This group was responsible for the creations of the first heaven, earth, morals, and the calendar.

Jack collects the three gems believing they can return him to his proper time.
