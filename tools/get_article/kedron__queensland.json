It is home to the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services headquarters. In the , Kedron had a population of 9,907 people.\nGeography\nKedron is centered on Gympie Road and Kedron Brook. It is close to Westfield Chermside shopping centre in the neighbouring suburb of Chermside. Kedron is an inner-northern suburb that neighbours Stafford, Chermside, Wavell Heights, Wooloowin, Lutwyche, and Nundah. Despite the similarity in names, the Brisbane suburbs of Kedron and Upper Kedron are 15.3 kilometres apart.\nHistory\nGerman missionaries originally settled in the Nundah area (known as German Station) in 1838.  These missionaries were granted  alongside the creek they named Kedron Brook, after Kidron Valley near Jerusalem. The suburb takes its name from the creek.\nThe first land sales commenced in 1857.  Alexander and Amelia Barron settled in the area in 1856.  James and Claude Barron worked as a blacksmiths on the corner of Gympie and Stafford Roads.\nAlfred Lutwyche, Queensland's first judge, purchased  in 1862.  He named his residence Kedron Lodge.  This heritage-listed residence is located on the border between Kedron and Wooloowin and is now considered part of the affluent Kalinga district of Wooloowin.\nIn 1864/1865, Henry Craig settled on land now occupied by Lutwyche Cemetery. He planted the large bunya pines along Gympie Road and lived there until his death in 1877. The cemetery was established in 1878 and was originally named Kedron Brook Cemetery. It was later renamed Lutwyche Cemetery to commemorate Alfred Lutwyche.\nWilliam Shaw and family arrived in 1865 and constructed the family residence \"Shaw Villa\" overlooking Kedron Brook.\nOn 30 November 1866, the locality's first church, St. Andrew's Church of England, was established.\nWhen gold was discovered in Gympie in 1868, a bridge was constructed over the Kedron Brook to permit an alternative northerly route. This route would become known as Gympie Road.  In 1868, the Edinburgh Castle Hotel was built by George Orr.  The hotel was originally situated on the opposite side of Edinburgh Castle Road.  A new brick hotel was completed in 1892.  It was demolished in 1959 and yet other structure built on the site.\nThe Kedron Park Hotel was established by Frederick Morris in 1881.\nIn 1887, Michael Gallagher and family established the Kedron Tannery, which was very successful and became known Australia-wide.\nPaul Maggs and family settled in the 1860s. In 1889 he built the Edinburgh Tannery alongside Kedron Creek at the end of Nundah Street.\nThe Kedron Park was set aside along Kedron Brook, adjacent to the Kedron Park Hotel. It once contained the Kedron Park Racecourse. In 1888 shares were offered in the Kedron Park Racecourse and Sports Ground Co Ltd. A formal race program was held in 1889 but saw little use in the following years. James Sharp purchased the racecourse in 1911 and changed many hands before it was finally closed in 1931 following a Royal Commission into racing.  In 1955, Kedron Park was resumed for educational building purposes. The Kedron Park Teachers College, then Queensland University of Technology, and now Queensland State Emergency Service has occupied the site.\nIn 1891, John and Abigail King's general store was built on Gympie Road opposite the intersection with Somerset Road. In the early 1890s, King became the first postmaster for Kedron, adopted the name Kedron for the locality. The name was not officially recognised until 1901.\nIn 1904, Part of Kedron, Lutwyche and Wooloowin were incorporated into the Town of Windsor.\nIn 1913, the Presbyterian Church was established and gained full church status in 1945.\nIn 1914, the tram service was extended from Windsor to the Kedron Park Hotel.

First services were held in the Wintergarden Theatre.\nIn September 1925, approximately 55 to 96 residential allotments of the second section of \"Kedron View Estate\" were advertised to be auctioned by Cameron Bros, being subdivisions of portion 87 in the Parish of Kedron. A map advertising the auction includes a locality map of the area and states the allotments were within 5 minutes' walk of the new tram terminus, with electric lights at the corner of Turner and Richmond Roads, and water mains in Richmond Road.\nIn April 1926, approximately 75 allotments of \"Scriven's Paddock\" (being subdivisions 1 to 38, 43 to 70, and 75, of portion 141 in the Parish of Kedron), described as \"parklike blocks,\" were advertised to be auctioned by Isles, Love & Co Limited. A map advertising the auction includes a local sketch of the area and states the allotments were situated on Kitchener Road, off Main Gympie Road within 3 minutes of the Kedron Tram Terminus.\nIn April 1928, 31 allotments of the \"Richmond Estate\" were advertised to be auctioned by Isles, Love, & Co Limited, being resubdivisions of portion 101 in the Parish of Kedron. A map advertising the auction includes a locality map of the area and states the allotments were within a few chains of the Kedron Tramline and close to the shopping centre, schools, and churches.\nIn April 1929, the Albion congregation of the Church of Christ initiated a six-week mission in a large tent at Kedron. It was very successful, achieving 147 \"total conversions\" and raising £300. Land was purchased on Gympie Road to establish a permanent church, which was built by volunteer labour on two successive Saturdays, 18 and 25 May 1929 with the first service held on 2 June 1929. In 1934, the church was altered. In 1959, the 1929 building was relocated to the rear of the land to enable the current building to be constructed. In the early 1950s, the Kedron church commenced outreach in Stafford resulting in the establishment of the Church of Christ in that suburb. The 1959 church had its foundation stone laid on 20 June 1959 and it opened on 21 November 1959. In 1992, the Kedron and Albion congregations merged to form the Brisbane North Church of Christ, operating from the Kedron site.\nOn 1 October 1926, Kedron State School enrolled 171 students, officially opening the following day 2 October 1926 with classes commencing on Monday 4 October 1926 with 216 students and four teachers.\nSt Anthony's and St Therese's Catholic School was officially opened by Archbishop Duhig on Sunday 26 January 1930, ten days after the arrival of the three Missionary Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception who were to run the school.
