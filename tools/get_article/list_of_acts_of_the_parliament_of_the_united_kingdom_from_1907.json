For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\n7 Edw. 7\nThe second session of the 28th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 12 February 1907 until 28 August 1907.\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 7 Ed. 7 or 7 E. 7.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  to all Pests destructive to Crops, Trees, or Bushes.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n-\n|  and part of section seven of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, 1887, relating to the Employment of Women and Children.|note4= }}\n| known in Canada as the Constitution Act, 1907|public|11|09-08-1907|An Act to make further provision with respect to the sums to be paid by Canada to the several Provinces of the Dominion.}}\n|  and 1866, by extending the powers of the Court in relation -to Maintenance and Alimony, and leave to intervene.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n-\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  relating to the prevention of infectious diseases.|note4= }}\n|  of Conscientious Objection.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and to amend section fifty-four of that Act.}}\n|  with respect to Laundries, and to extend that Act to certain Institutions and to provide for the inspection of certain premises.|note4= }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n-\n|  }}\n|\n|  with respect to the deduction of the space occupied by propelling power in ascertaining the tonnage of a ship.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n}}\nLocal acts\nrelating to Portobello and Musselburgh Tramways (Port Seton Deviation).|po1=Portobello and Musselburgh Tramways (Port Seton Deviation) Order 1907|}}\n|  and for other purposes.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  with respect to Superannuation Fund.}}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  and 1900 to confer further powers upon the Great Yarmouth Port and Haven Commissioners and for other purposes.}}\n|\n|\n|\n|  relating to the Southwark Borough Market.|po1=Southwark (Borough Market) Scheme.|po1short=n}}\n| |note4=|po1=|po1short=n}}\n|  relating to lands in the Metropolitan Boroughs of Paddington and Battersea, and in the Parish of Chipping Barnet.|note4=|po1=|po1short=n}}\n|  relating to the Oregon Mortgage Company Limited.|po1=Oregon Mortgage Company Order 1907|}}\n|  containing the Schedule of Maximum Tolls and Charges applicable to the New Junction Canal of the Under takers of the Aire and Calder Navigation.|po1=Canal Rates and Charges (New Junction Canal) Order 1907|}}\n|  in the matter of certain lands in the Parish of Keadby in the County of Lincoln (Parts of Lindsey)|po1=Land Drainage (Lincoln) Order 1907|}}\n|  in the matter of the Oulton Carlton &c.
