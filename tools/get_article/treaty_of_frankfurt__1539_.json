The parties met at Frankfurt-on-the-Main, and the Lutherans were represented by Philip Melanchthon. The treaty stated that the emperor would not take any violent actions against the Protestants, who had formed an alliance known as the Schmalkaldic League, for fifteen months starting 1 May; during this time both parties could try to resolve the differences in their confessions. As a result of this peace, the Schmalkaldic League lost the protection of France.\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
