They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the National Hockey League's (NHL) Eastern Conference. The Flyers were founded in 1967 as one of six expansion teams, increasing the size of the NHL at that time to 12 teams.\nSince the franchise was established, the team has won the Stanley Cup two times as league champions in 1974 and 1975, the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl six times – twice as division champions and four times as conference champions – and the Prince of Wales Trophy as conference champions four times. Prior to the Presidents' Trophy first being award in , the Flyers led the league in points three times in , , and , but have not led the league in points at the end of the regular season since.\nOnly Bobby Clarke and Eric Lindros have won regular season most valuable player honors as Flyers. Clarke won the Hart Memorial Trophy three times in ,  and  while Lindros won in . Both Clarke and Lindros also won the Lester B. Pearson Award, awarded to the most outstanding player as voted by the players and now known as the Ted Lindsay Award, Clarke in  and Lindros in . Four Flyers players have won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, twice when the Flyers won the Stanley Cup – Bernie Parent in 1974 and 1975 – and twice when they lost in the finals – Reggie Leach in 1976 and Ron Hextall in 1987. Parent and Hextall account for two of the three Flyers goaltenders to win the Vezina Trophy, Parent in  and , Pelle Lindbergh in , and Hextall in .\nTwenty-one people – fourteen players and seven builders – who spent time with the Flyers have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Flyers have inducted twenty-eight people into a team hall of fame since 1988 and six of those inductees have also had their numbers retired.\nLeague awards\nTeam trophies\nThe Flyers won the Stanley Cup as league champions in back-to-back years during the mid-1970s. They have not won the Cup since despite six return trips to the Stanley Cup Finals. They won the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl six times, twice as West Division champions and four times as Campbell Conference regular season champions. Realignment after the  season moved the Flyers to the Wales Conference (known as the Eastern Conference since the  season) and they have since won the trophy given to the conference's playoff champion, the Prince of Wales Trophy, four times. The Flyers have never won the Presidents' Trophy which has been given to the team finishing the regular season with the best overall record based on points since the  season. Prior to the creation of the trophy the Flyers led the league in points three times for the 1974–75, 1979–80, and 1984–85 seasons.\ntwo times.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Team trophies awarded to the Philadelphia Flyers\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" |Description\n! scope=\"col\" |Times won\n! scope=\"col\" |Seasons\n! scope=\"col\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Stanley Cup\n|NHL championship\n|2\n|}}, }}\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Clarence S.

The most frequently won awards include the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, Conn Smythe Trophy, Hart Memorial Trophy, Jack Adams Award, and the Vezina Trophy, each won four times by Flyers players or coaches. Bobby Clarke's three Hart Trophy wins is the most of any Flyers player or coach of one particular award.\nA few highly coveted NHL awards have never been won by Flyers players and occasionally they have been on the losing end of some close calls for them. Mark Howe finished as runner-up three times during the 1980s in voting for the James Norris Memorial Trophy, which is awarded to the defenseman who demonstrates throughout the season the greatest all-round ability in the position. During their respective rookie seasons, Bill Barber (), Ron Hextall (), and Shayne Gostisbehere () finished second in voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy, given to the league's most outstanding rookie player. During the  season Eric Lindros finished tied for the league's scoring title with Pittsburgh Penguins forward Jaromir Jagr. However, Jagr was awarded the Art Ross Trophy, given to the league's regular season scoring champion, due to the first tiebreaker being the player with the most goals, Jagr having scored 32 goals compared to Lindros' 29.\nIn the case of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player who exhibits outstanding sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability, no Flyers player has ever finished in the top three in the voting for it. Due to their history as the Broad Street Bullies during the 1970s it has been suggested the Lady Byng is not an award Flyers players covet. Dave Brown, who was an enforcer with the team during the 1980s and 1990s, went so far as to say the only way he would ever win the award is \"if they renamed it the Man Byng.\"\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Individual awards won by Philadelphia Flyers players and staff\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Description\n! scope=\"col\" |Winner\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! rowspan=\"4\" scope=\"row\" |Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|Oskar Lindblom\n|2020–21\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" |Conn Smythe Trophy\n|rowspan=\"4\" |Most valuable player of the playoffs\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" |Frank J.

Forty-five All-Star Games have been held since the Flyers entered the league in 1967, with at least one player chosen to represent the Flyers in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off. Philadelphia has hosted two All-Star Games.

The number 31, last worn by goaltender Pelle Lindbergh, was removed from circulation after Lindbergh's death on November 11, 1985, but it is not officially retired. Also out of circulation is the number 99 which was retired league-wide for Wayne Gretzky on February 6, 2000. Gretzky did not play for the Flyers during his 20-year NHL career and no Flyers player had ever worn the number 99 prior to its retirement.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+ Philadelphia Flyers retired numbers\n! scope=\"col\" |Number\n! scope=\"col\" |Player\n! scope=\"col\" |Position\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Flyers as a player\n! scope=\"col\" |Date of retirement ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1\n|\n|\n|1967–1971, 1973–1979\n|October 11, 1979\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2\n|\n|\n|1982–1992\n|March 6, 2012\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |4\n|\n|\n|1970–1974\n|October 13, 1977\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |7\n|\n|\n|1972–1984\n|October 11, 1990\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |16\n|\n|\n|1969–1984\n|November 15, 1984\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |88\n|\n|\n|1992–2000\n|January 18, 2018\n|\n|}\nFlyers Hall of Fame\nEstablished in 1988, the Flyers Hall of Fame was designed to \"permanently honor those individuals who have contributed to the franchise's success.\" Candidates for the hall are nominated and voted upon by a panel of media members and team officials.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"80%\"\n|+Members of the Philadelphia Flyers inducted into the Flyers Hall of Fame\n! scope=\"col\" |Individual\n! scope=\"col\" |Primary roles\n! scope=\"col\" |Years with Flyers in roles\n! scope=\"col\" |Date of induction ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Head coach, executive\n|1967–2014\n|March 16, 1989\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1970–1974\n|March 21, 1991\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player, head coach\n|1972–1984, 2000–2002\n|March 16, 1989\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1991–2000\n|November 23, 2015\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player, executive\n|1969–1990, 1992–1993, 1994–present\n|March 22, 1988\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1995–2006\n|February 19, 2015\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1967–1978\n|March 21, 1991\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Broadcaster\n|1967–1995\n|February 13, 1992\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player, executive\n|1986–1992, 1994–1999, 2014–2018\n|February 6, 2008\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player, head coach, executive\n|1976–1991, 1995–present\n|November 16, 2021\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1982–1992\n|March 15, 2001\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1980–1991\n|March 8, 1994\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1974–1982\n|February 13, 1992\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1995–2004\n|November 20, 2014\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1992–2000\n|November 20, 2014\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1970–1980, 1983–1984\n|March 22, 1990\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1967–1971, 1973–1979\n|March 22, 1988\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1983–1990\n|March 3, 2004\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1979–1990\n|March 4, 1999\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1992–1995, 1999–2004\n|January 27, 2024\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1972–1976\n|November 16, 2009\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Executive\n|1967–2002\n|April 8, 1993\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Head coach\n|1971–1978\n|March 22, 1990\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Owner\n|1967–2016\n|March 16, 1989\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1984–1992, 2000–2002\n|November 16, 2021\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1967–1976\n|April 8, 1993\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1973–1982\n|February 29, 2016\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\n|Player\n|1967–1978\n|February 22, 1996\n|\n|}\nTeam awards\nBarry Ashbee Trophy\nFirst awarded following the 1974–75 season, the Barry Ashbee Trophy is given out to the team's \"outstanding defenseman\"  as determined by a panel vote consisting of local sportscasters and sportswriters. The trophy is named in honor of Barry Ashbee, an NHL second team All-Star and the team's best defenseman during the 1973–74 season who suffered a career-ending eye injury during Game 4 of the 1974 Stanley Cup Semifinals. Eric Desjardins won the trophy seven times during his Flyers career including six in a row his first six seasons with the Flyers. Kimmo Timonen with five wins and Mark Howe and Ivan Provorov with four wins are the only other Flyers to win the trophy at least four times.\nBobby Clarke Trophy\nThe Flyers unveiled the Bobby Clarke Trophy on November 15, 1984, to honor the retired Bobby Clarke during Bobby Clarke Night at the Spectrum. Clarke was the captain of the Flyers for several seasons, including during the team's two Stanley Cup championship seasons, and was and still is the holder of several Philadelphia Flyers records. Since then it has been given to the \"team's most valuable player\" as determined by a panel vote consisting of local sportscasters and sportswriters. Claude Giroux won the trophy five times during his Flyers career while Eric Lindros won the trophy four times.\nFlyers Alumni Community Leadership Award\nThe Flyers Alumni Community Leadership Award is given to the Flyers player \"who best demonstrates outstanding leadership, both on and off the ice, as well as a significant contribution to the community.\" The recipient of this award is also the Flyers' nominee for the NHL's King Clancy Memorial Trophy. It was first awarded for the 2023–24 season.\nGene Hart Memorial Award\nFirst given out for the 2006–07 season to honor the memory of long-time announcer Gene Hart, the Gene Hart Memorial Award is given to the Flyer \"who demonstrated the most \"Heart\" during the season\" as voted on by members of the Philadelphia Flyers Fan Club at their monthly meetings. Sean Couturier with three wins is the only player to win the award more than once.\nPelle Lindbergh Memorial Trophy\nThe Pelle Lindbergh Memorial Trophy is awarded to the \"Flyer who has most improved from the previous season, as voted by his teammates.\" Named to honor the memory of Pelle Lindbergh, a Vezina Trophy–winning goaltender with the Flyers who died at the age of 26 on November 11, 1985, following a car crash the day before, the trophy has been given to 32 different players since the 1993–94 season.\nToyota Cup\nFirst given out following the 2000–01 season, the Toyota Cup is an award given to the player who earns the most points from Star of the game selections throughout the regular season, \"five points for being the First Star, three for Second Star, and one for Third Star.\" The Tri-State Toyota Dealers sponsor the award and make a donation of $5,000 in the winning player's name to the player's favorite charity. Claude Giroux with seven wins, Simon Gagne and Carter Hart each with three wins, and Travis Konecny with two wins are the only multiple-time winners of the trophy.\nYanick Dupre Memorial Class Guy Award\nThe Yanick Dupre Memorial Class Guy Award was first awarded following the 1976–77 season as the Class Guy Award \"to the player who best exemplifies a strong rapport with the media.\" The award was renamed and re-defined in 1999 to honor the memory of Yanick Dupre. Dupre, who played 35 games over parts of three seasons with the Flyers, died on August 16, 1997, at the age of 24 after a 16-month battle with leukemia. It is now given to the \"Flyer who best illustrates character, dignity and respect for the sport both on and off the ice\" as decided by the Philadelphia chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association. As is tradition, no Flyers player has won the award more than once.\nOther awards and honors\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+ Philadelphia Flyers who have received non-NHL awards\n! scope=\"col\" |Award\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Description\n! scope=\"col\" |Winner\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Best NHL Player ESPY Award\n|Best NHL player of the last calendar year\n|\n|1996\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Golden Hockey Stick\n|Best Czech ice hockey player\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lionel Conacher Award\n|Canada's male athlete of the year\n|\n|1975\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Lou Marsh Trophy\n|Canada's top athlete\n|\n|1975\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |Viking Award\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Most valuable Swedish player in NHL\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\nJohn Wanamaker Athletic Award\nThe John Wanamaker Athletic Award is an award given to the \"Athlete, team or organization which has done the most to reflect credit upon Philadelphia and to the team or sport in which they excel\" by the Philadelphia Sports Congress.
