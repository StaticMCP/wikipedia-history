The arrival of the Portuguese, Dutch and British colonial powers led to the demolition, looting and repurposing of many Hindu temples.\nNallur Kandaswamy temple\nThe Nallur Kandaswamy temple, located in Jaffna, was originally founded in 948 AD. It gained fame in the 13th century when it was rebuilt by Puvaneka Vaahu, a minister of the Jaffna King Kalinga Maha. The temple underwent a third reconstruction by Senpaha Perumal (also known as Sapumal Kumaraya), the adopted son of the Kotte king. During this time, Nallur served as the capital of the Jaffna Kingdom and housed various courtly buildings, palaces and businesses.\nThe third temple was destroyed in 1624 AD by the Portuguese, who built several churches over its ruins. The site of the original temple is now occupied by St. James Church, Nallur. Although part of the original temple's Sivalingam survived, it was destroyed during the Sri Lankan civil war and only the platform on which it was mounted remains. The current temple structure was rebuilt in 1734 AD by Don Juan and underwent significant renovations in the 1890s to restore its former glory.\nKoneswaram temple\nThe Koneswaram temple, located in Trincomalee, is one of the most revered Hindu temples in Sri Lanka. On April 14, 1622, during the Tamil New Year, the Portuguese destroyed the temple in a brutal attack. The Portuguese general Constantino de Sá de Noronha led the assault, with soldiers disguising themselves as Iyer priests to gain entry. The treasures of the temple were looted and the temple itself was pushed off the cliff into the Indian Ocean.\nIn the aftermath, the Portuguese repurposed the temple's carved stones to construct Fort Fredrick. Churches were also built in the town to assert religious superiority. The main deity statue was taken to the town, and some statues were buried by fleeing priests. Despite the destruction, the temple site remains a significant symbol of Tamil heritage.\nNaguleswaram temple\nNaguleswaram temple, situated in Keerimalai, Jaffna, is one of the ancient Ishwarams dedicated to Lord Shiva. It was subjected to destruction during the Portuguese colonial period when Hindu practices were suppressed and Christian missionary activities were enforced. Despite this, the temple was rebuilt in the 19th century and continues to be a place of worship today, holding immense historical and religious significance for Tamil Hindus.\nMunneswaram temple, Chilaw\nThe Munneswaram temple, located in the western province of Chilaw, was also targeted and damaged by the Portuguese. Although it is not situated in the predominantly Tamil areas, Munneswaram holds significance for both Tamil Hindus and Sinhalese Buddhists. After the temple was attacked, it was eventually rebuilt, and today it remains an active place of worship.\nThiruketheeswaram temple, Mannar\nThiruketheeswaram temple, one of the oldest and most revered Hindu temples, is located in Mannar. It was also targeted during the Portuguese colonial rule, resulting in damage and looting of its treasures. The temple, like others affected, underwent reconstruction in later years. Today, it stands as a symbol of the rich Tamil Hindu cultural heritage in Sri Lanka.\nOther destroyed temples\nAside from these major temples, numerous smaller shrines and temples across the Tamil regions of Sri Lanka were also impacted during colonial rule. The destruction and repurposing of these religious sites not only caused significant cultural loss but also disrupted the continuity of Hindu practices in these areas.\nSee also\n* Sri Lankan Civil War - Details the conflict in which thousands of Tamils were killed, contributing to the wave of asylum seekers.\nReferences"
