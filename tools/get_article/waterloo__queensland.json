In the , Waterloo had a population of 171 people.\nGeography\nThe northwest of the locality is in the Littabella National Park which extends into neighbouring Rosedale and Monduran. A small part of southwest of the locality is in the Monduran State Forest which extends into Monduran.\nHistory\nThe locality of Waterloo was named for Waterloo Plantation, selected by Christian Thygesen, a Danish sugar boiler who had previously worked for Sharon, Pemberton, and Windsor sugar mills in the Bundaberg district. By early 1895, Thygesen had selected a large area of land in the Littabella area, naming it \"Waterloo\". He entered into partnership with farmer Adam Pringle with the intention of establishing a sugar mill on the site.\nThygesen planted sugarcane and travelled approximately 600 kilometres south to the Richmond River district in northern New South Wales to inspect suitable machinery for the mill. He purchased a small mill there, had it dismantled, and transported it to Waterloo for reassembly.\nThe first raw sugar produced from Waterloo was sold to Millaquin Mill in June 1895. The Waterloo mill operated for approximately eleven years under Christian Thygesen before it was sold.\nWaterloo State School opened circa 1937 and closed in 1955. It was on Waterloo Hall Road ().\nCommunity Facilities\nA central landmark of the locality is the Waterloo Hall, a public hall constructed in 1911. The construction was driven by the local Waterloo public hall committee with the support of Waterloo Ltd. The company offered a lease of land for a renewable term of 25 years, contributing £20 and clearing the land at their own expense.\nThe Waterloo Hall was officially opened on 10 June 1911, an event commemorated with a community ball.\nOver the decades, the hall has served as an important venue for the district, hosting evenings ranging from social gatherings and celebrations, to farewells for servicemen heading to war. It continues to function as a hub for Waterloo community life, hosting community barbecues, weddings, markets, cultural celebrations, and other local events.\nDemographics\nIn the , Waterloo had a population of 145 people.\nIn the , Waterloo had a population of 171 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Waterloo.
