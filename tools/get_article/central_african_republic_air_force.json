As of 2017 it has been a branch of the Ground Force. The CAAF is reported to be almost inactive due to the unserviceability of its aircraft.\nDassault Mirage F1s of the French Air Force regularly patrol troubled regions of the country and also participate in direct confrontations.\nHistory\nAccording to some sources, former President François Bozizé used the money he got from the mining concession in Bakouma to buy two old Mil Mi-8 helicopters from Ukraine and one Lockheed C-130 Hercules, built in the 1950s, from the U.S.\nThe CAAF received two Mi-24V/Mi-35 helicopters from Ukraine in 2011.\nIn May 2021, the CAAF received one Mi-8MT and one Mi-24V from Russia.\nIn early January 2023, it was reported that between 6 and 8 ex-Russian Air Force L-39 trainer jets were donated or delivered. Presumably, they will also be used in an attack role by Wagner forces present.\nAircraft\nCurrent inventory\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |Aircraft\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\" |Origin\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\" |Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; background:#acc;\" |Variant\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\" |In service\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\" |Notes\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | Trainer aircraft\n|-\n| Aero L-39\n| Czech Republic\n| Primary trainer\n|\n| 6-8\n|\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\n* Hoyle, Craig. \"World Air Forces Directory\".
