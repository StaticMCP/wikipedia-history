In flashbacks, various groups go on supply runs; Strand and Cole search a nursery for plants; Nick and Luciana search a library; and Alicia and Naomi go to a water park. At the library, there is no food, but Nick insists on finding books because he argues people need more than just food. At the water park, Alicia and Naomi find various medical supplies and a machine gun. Strand shows Cole a secret car that is filled with supplies just for himself. At the stadium, Madison tells Mel she is willing to build a community together, but Mel scoffs at the idea.

They then patch the guardrail with a piece of metal. During the night, Naomi reveals to John that she lost a child. The next day, John teaches Naomi how to fish and they play Scrabble. The infected have still been floating downstream, so they investigate the bridge again. This time, they block the gap with a Jeep. During a scuffle with the infected, John refuses to use his pistols, but instead stabs them. He explains his refusal to use firearms is because of an incident from when he was a police officer. The infected eventually knock the Jeep into the river and float towards John's cabin. John and Naomi fight off the infected, where John uses his weapons to save Naomi. Later, John tells Naomi he loves her and they kiss. The next day, John discovers Naomi has left, but leaves a note with Scrabble tiles: \"I love you too I'm sorry.\"\n| LineColor       = D3D6DA\n}}\n| Viewers         = 2.31\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Madison and Strand join Naomi on a supply run to a FEMA shelter that may have seeds and fertilizer.

In the present, Naomi and Morgan struggle to get supplies to save John's life while Althea and Charlie deal with an attack from Alicia's group. The subsequent revelation that Althea met Madison and Morgan's intervention convinces Alicia to stop her path of vengeance.

Strand spends most of his days intoxicated, Luciana is severely depressed, and Alicia is off on her own; none of them are interested in joining Morgan on his trip. Morgan helps Alicia, who is following a path of notes labeled \"HELP\", to someone who is possibly in need. The two kill more Infected and reach the source of the notes, but the person has already turned. Disheartened, Alicia separates from Morgan and goes off on her own. Charlie flees the school bus, and John goes to Strand to ask for help in finding her.  June confesses to Althea that she's scared John won't love her, because John fell in love with \"Laura\".

Alicia orders Charlie to help her hammer the window shutters closed, but stops once the noise begins to attract more Infected. Back inside, Alicia discovers Charlie has a gun, which Alicia keeps. The two eat dinner, and Charlie asks Alicia many questions about her past. The storm begins to intensify and a window shatters. They flee to the basement, which has flooded, and debris collapses on the basement door, trapping them. They try to escape through the exterior doors, but it's locked from the outside. Believing they will soon drown, Charlie begs Alicia to kill her so she will not turn like her parents did. Alicia contemplates it, but refuses. Suddenly, an Infected impaled on a tree branch above falls and breaks the lock, allowing them to escape. They drive to the mansion to look for Strand and Luciana, but the house is empty and in ruins. They also discover John and June's bus overturned on the bridge, and Alicia wonders if they are all dead.\n| LineColor       = D3D6DA\n}}\n| Viewers         = 1.83\n| ShortSummary    = Morgan takes refuge from the storm inside a semi-truck and takes supplies from a box labelled with \"Take what you need. Leave what you don't\". After falling asleep inside the truck, he wakes up to discover he is at a gas station in Mississippi.

They hear a static-filled transmission over the radio and go to higher ground for a better signal. Morgan, who is traveling with Sarah, Wendell and Jim, tries to make contact with the others by revealing his location via the walkie, but there is no response. Althea begins to feel weak due to lack of water and food. June and Althea find an abandoned truck and begin driving. They then see the SWAT truck drive past them, and they chase it. Althea comes down with a fever, and tells June there is antibiotics in her truck. June goes by herself to track down the truck, and retrieves it after an altercation with Quinn, the man who stole it. However, the truck is out of fuel. June cannot find the medicine, and Althea reveals over the radio that there wasn't any; she just wanted the truck back with her videotapes. June luckily finds medicine in an overturned bus near the truck. Morgan unknowingly encounters the mysterious woman at a supply box, and after he leaves, she replaces the bottles of clean water with dirty water. At higher ground, Morgan obtains a signal and gives his location. June and Althea hear the message and reunite with Morgan.

She warns them to stop helping people, as it makes them weak. Strand and John are marooned and the surrounding water has an alligator in it. Luciana comes across Clayton, an older man who is mortally wounded and trapped in his car from the storm. His last wish is to have a beer, so Luciana sets off in search of one. John and Strand assemble a raft using a camper shell from a truck. John uses the horn to lure Infected to the water to distract the alligator as they begin to cross. However, the horn dies and the alligator attacks their raft, causing a leak. John fires at it and they swim back. Luciana discovers a supply box left by Morgan and finds a beer inside (from Jim, who is a brewer). The box is also marked with Morgan's radio channel. Luciana returns to Clayton with the beer, and he tells her he was a truck driver and has notebooks with descriptions of locations where he left supplies. He later dies. Luciana reunites with Morgan and the others after contacting his radio channel. Morgan is then contacted by Charlie and Alicia on the radio, but is interrupted by the mysterious woman, who is driving Althea's SWAT truck. She approaches the semi-truck with everyone inside and opens fire with the SWAT truck's guns.\n| LineColor       = D3D6DA\n}}\n| Viewers         = 1.87\n| ShortSummary    = In a flashback, the mysterious woman, Martha, is forced to kill her husband after he turns. After burying him, she begins to lose her mind, mumbling to herself. Martha begins to kill various survivors who are leaving the supply boxes at mile markers. In the present, Martha attacks the semi-truck with the SWAT guns. After running out of ammo, Martha flees in the SWAT truck, but not before being wounded by a gunshot from Wendell. Morgan and everyone escape the semi-truck and it explodes from leaking fuel. The noise attracts a herd of Infected and the group goes to a nearby hospital. As the herd enters the hospital, the group goes to the top floor and they split into groups to barricade the other stairwells. Believing the barricades won't hold, the group goes to the roof via the elevator, minus Althea who went on her own to start the generator to fix the elevator. On the roof, June checks on Jim's injuries and discovers he has been bitten by an Infected. Meanwhile, Alicia and Charlie continue their trek and come across a lake where they find John Dorie's hat.\n| LineColor       = D3D6DA\n}}\n| Viewers         = 2.03\n| ShortSummary    = Alicia and Charlie find Strand and John, but they're stranded on the opposite side of the lake. While searching for a boat, they are attacked by gunfire from Martha, but she then falls unconscious due to her prior gunshot wound. Eventually, Alicia and Charlie find and use the SWAT vehicle to cross the lake and rescue Strand and John, with Martha tied up in the back. With no way of escaping from the roof and the streets below overrun with Infected, Morgan leads the group back to the generator room to search for Althea, where they find a note about her escape plan by using the freight elevator. The group escapes the hospital via the freight elevator, but Morgan stays behind to cause a distraction to clear their escape route. Morgan goes back to the roof and tosses an Infected corpse over, landing on a car and setting off its alarm. However, he is still stuck on the roof with a dying Jim. Alicia's group joins up with the others after getting their location over the walkie. They use a fire truck ladder to get Morgan off the roof. With little time left before he succumbs to his bite wound, Jim leaps from the roof onto a vehicle to set off its alarm and draw the Infected away from the others. Everyone gets inside the SWAT truck and realize Martha has vanished. Morgan suggests they find Althea and head to Virginia. That night back at the hospital, Martha watches Jim reanimate and takes him to go after Morgan.\n| LineColor       = D3D6DA\n}}\n| Viewers         = 2.13\n| ShortSummary    = Althea manages to escape from the hospital but is knocked out by Martha and a zombified Jim. Martha uses her to deliver a video message to the group in which she vows to make Morgan strong. While the rest of the group retreats back to the truck stop before heading to Alexandria, Morgan sets out to look for Martha and help her overcome her issues with helping people. He finds her at her husband's grave along with the Infected Jim who Morgan sadly puts down. Morgan plans to bring Martha with him to the truck stop, but she causes him to crash his car after he receives a distress call from the others, who have been poisoned with antifreeze in the water bottles. After nearly reverting to his old self and killing her, Morgan sets out on foot to get within reach of the truck stop to let the others know by what they have been poisoned. With Martha dying of blood loss and a raging infection from her prior untreated gunshot wound, Morgan handcuffs her to a car door so that she can't harm anyone when she turns. While their truckload of ethanol, the antidote, goes to waste due to bullet holes, Morgan arrives in time with a supply of Jim's beer to save everyone. He then returns to Martha and finds she has turned, so he puts her down. The group decides not to go to Alexandria and instead continue the Polar Bear's work. Operating out of a denim factory, they set out to create a network helping lost people and to turn the factory into something special, mimicking Madison's plans for the stadium.\n| LineColor       = D3D6DA\n}}\n}}\nProduction and writing\nOn April 14, 2017, AMC renewed the series for a 16-episode fourth season and announced that Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg would replace the departing Dave Erickson as showrunners. Production began in November 2017 in Austin, Texas. Michael E. Satrazemis, a director of photography for The Walking Dead and director of 12 episodes, joined Fear the Walking Dead as a directing-producer.\nIn November 2017, it was reported that Lennie James who portrays Morgan Jones on The Walking Dead would crossover and join the main cast in the fourth season. The fourth season also sees the additions of several new series regulars, played by Garret Dillahunt, Jenna Elfman, and Maggie Grace.\nOn April 21, 2018, Colman Domingo revealed that he would be directing the twelfth episode of this season.\nThe fourth season features a redesigned title sequence with new theme music. Each episode of the season has a different title card, and tells a story which will become apparent once the season is completed. The Hollywood Reporter reflected on the new intro, calling the new season, \"a Western with zombies, very much by design.\"\nGoldberg spoke of the season's narrative structure, which features multiple timelines:\nThe new showrunners also were inspired by Westerns; Chambliss stated, \"It all started with the themes we set out at the beginning: isolation and community. Those themes run through a lot of classic Western stories.\" Visually, the season is inspired by John Ford and Sergio Leone's Westerns, using Once Upon a Time in the West as a template for directors. Chambliss said, \"it's all about having wide shots, not moving the characters, but moving the characters within the frame. When we get to the editing room, it's really about slowing down the cutting pattern, and harkening back to that style of filmmaking. It does infuse the show with a different feel than what we've seen before. It's something that we're very excited for people to see.\"}}\nRelease\nOn March 15, 2018, it was announced that the season premiere and the season eight finale of The Walking Dead would be screened at AMC, Regal, and Cinemark theaters across the United States on April 15, the same day as the televised airing, for \"Survival Sunday: The Walking Dead & Fear the Walking Dead\". The episodes marked the first crossover between the two series. The cinema screening also included an extra half-hour of exclusive bonus content.\nReception\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the fourth season has an approval rating of 80% based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 6.85/10. The site's critical consensus is, \"Fear the Walking Dead shuffles onward confidently in its fourth season with a bevy of horrifying set-pieces and heartbreaking twists, but some viewers may be dispirited by the series' constant reshuffling of its characters.\" TVLine reevaluated the series for its fourth season, giving it a \"B+\" grade. Reviewer Charlie Mason wrote, \"it's gone from being an adequate stopgap between seasons of The Walking Dead to a show that's as good or arguably even better than the one from which it was spun off.\" He also praised the addition of Jenna Elfman and Garret Dillahunt and that season 4 has had several genuine surprises in its storytelling.\nHowever, the decision to kill off lead character Madison Clark, portrayed by Kim Dickens, was met with intense criticism. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, television critic Maureen Ryan highlighted the character as \"one of TV's — and cable's — rare mature female leads\" and cited her \"baffling\" demise as an example of Hollywood's ageist practices, adding, \"the fact that this decision comes from The Walking Dead franchise, which has come under fire for its treatment of women and people of color in the past, is even more depressing.\"\nRatings\n| title2   = Another Day in the Diamond\n| date2    = April 22, 2018\n| rs2      = 1.1\n| viewers2 = 3.07\n| dvr2     = 0.5\n| dvrv2    = 1.18\n| total2   = 1.6\n| totalv2  = 4.25\n| title3   = Good Out Here\n| date3    = April 29, 2018\n| rs3      = 1.0\n| viewers3 = 2.71\n| dvr3     = 0.6\n| dvrv3    = 1.50\n| total3   = 1.6\n| totalv3  = 4.21\n| title4   = Buried\n| date4    = May 6, 2018\n| rs4      = 0.9\n| viewers4 = 2.49\n| dvr4     = n/a\n| dvrv4    = n/a\n| total4   = n/a\n| totalv4  = n/a\n| title5   = Laura\n| date5    = May 13, 2018\n| rs5      = 0.9\n| viewers5 = 2.46\n| dvr5     = 0.6\n| dvrv5    = 1.47\n| total5   = 1.5\n| totalv5  = 3.94\n| title6   = Just in Case\n| date6    = May 20, 2018\n| rs6      = 0.8\n| viewers6 = 2.31\n| dvr6     = n/a\n| dvrv6    = n/a\n| total6   = n/a\n| totalv6  = n/a\n| title7   = The Wrong Side of Where You Are Now\n| date7    = June 3, 2018\n| rs7      = 0.6\n| viewers7 = 1.97\n| dvr7     = 0.5\n| dvrv7    = 1.19\n| total7   = 1.1\n| totalv7  = 3.16\n| title8   = No One's Gone\n| date8    = June 10, 2018\n| rs8      = 0.7\n| viewers8 = 2.32\n| dvr8     = 0.6\n| dvrv8    = 1.52\n| total8   = 1.3\n| totalv8  = 3.85\n| title9   = People Like Us\n| date9    = August 12, 2018\n| rs9      = 0.7\n| viewers9 = 1.88\n| dvr9     = 0.4\n| dvrv9    = 0.96\n| total9   = 1.0\n| totalv9  = 2.84\n| title10   = Close Your Eyes\n| date10    = August 19, 2018\n| rs10      = 0.6\n| viewers10 = 1.86\n| dvr10     = 0.5\n| dvrv10    = 1.15\n| total10   = 1.1\n| totalv10  = 3.01\n| title11   = The Code\n| date11    = August 26, 2018\n| rs11      = 0.6\n| viewers11 = 1.83\n| dvr11     = 0.4\n| dvrv11    = 0.99\n| total11   = 1.0\n| totalv11  = 2.82\n| title12   = Weak\n| date12    = September 2, 2018\n| rs12      = 0.5\n| viewers12 = 1.52\n| dvr12     = 0.4\n| dvrv12    = 1.24\n| total12   = 0.9\n| totalv12  = 2.76\n| title13   = Blackjack\n| date13    = September 9, 2018\n| rs13      = 0.6\n| viewers13 = 1.72\n| dvr13     = 0.5\n| dvrv13    = 1.26\n| total13   = 1.1\n| totalv13  = 2.98\n| title14   = MM 54\n| date14    = September 16, 2018\n| rs14      = 0.6\n| viewers14 = 1.87\n| dvr14     = 0.5\n| dvrv14    = 1.30\n| total14   = 1.1\n| totalv14  = 3.17\n| title15   = I Lose People...\n| date15    = September 23, 2018\n| rs15      = 0.7\n| viewers15 = 2.03\n| dvr15     = 0.3\n| dvrv15    = 0.93\n| total15   = 1.0\n| totalv15  = 2.97\n| title16   = ...
