However, the prickly pear was eventually biologically controlled by the introduction of the Cactoblastis cactorum moth, removing the need for large supplies of arsenic, so the mine closed.\nJibbenbah State School opened on 22 June 1922 for the use of mining families and local farming families. It closed on 27 January 1925. It was located at  about  north-west of the entrance to the mine entrance on Arsenic Mine Road.\nDemographics\nIn the , Springdale had a population of 25 people.\nIn the , Springdale had a population of 28 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Springdale.
