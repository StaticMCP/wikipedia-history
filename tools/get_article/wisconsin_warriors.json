Based in Greendale, the Warriors played their home games on the campus of Greendale High School. The Warriors were the defending IWFL North American Champions of 2009.\nHistory\n2008\nThe Warriors were formed in 2007, continuing a legacy of women's football in SE Wisconsin perpetuated by the Wisconsin Riveters and Northern Ice among other teams.  Their inaugural season was a struggle, as the Warriors only finished 2-6 and fourth place in the Midwest Division.\n2009\nIn 2009 (after they had already been assigned a Tier I-strength schedule), the Warriors opted to move to Tier II.  Though they had only finished 4-4 on the regular season, their team rating/strength of schedule (being the only Tier II team to pick up two wins against Tier I-both vs. the Minnesota Vixen), the Warriors wrapped up home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.  In the first round, the Warriors dominated the Chattanooga Locomotion with a 32-6 victory. that task was not much more difficult in the following round; thanks to a 28-6 win over the Carolina Phoenix, the Warriors won the Regional Championship. On July 25, the Warriors won the IWFL Tier II North American Championship, defeating the defending champion Montreal Blitz, 42-14, at Round Rock ISD Athletic Stadium in Round Rock, Texas (a suburb of Austin).\n2010\nThey finished 6-4 in 2010, won their division and beat the Memphis Belles in the quarterfinals of the Tier II playoffs but did not win the Tier that year as they lost in the semifinals.\n2011\nThey moved up to Tier I in 2011. The Warriors were featured on Fox 6 twice. They would finish 8-0 that year, their first ever undefeated season, claimed the Midwest division title and made the Tier I playoffs where they would win a quarterfinal. But once again, they lost in the semifinals and wouldn't win the Tier title in 2011.\nSeason-By-Season\n|-\n|2008 || 2 || 6 || 0 || 4th East Midwest || --\n|-\n|2009 || 7 || 4 || 0 || 1st Tier II || Won Tier II Quarterfinal (Chattanooga)Won Tier II Semifinal (Carolina)Won Tier II Championship (Montreal)\n|-\n|2010 || 6 || 4 || 0 || 2nd Tier II West || Won Tier II Midwest Division (Memphis)\n|-\n|2011 || 9 || 1 || 0 || 2nd Tier I West || Won Tier I Midwest Division\n|-\n|2012* || 9 || 1 || 0 || 2nd Tier I West || Won Midwest Division\n|-\n!Totals || 33 || 16 || 0\n|colspan=\"2\"|(including playoffs)\n= Current Standing\nSeason Schedules\n2009\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Home/Away\n!Result\n|-\n|April 11\n|Detroit Demolition\n|Away\n|Lost 6-34\n|-\n|April 18\n|Chicago Force\n|Away\n|Lost 20-38\n|-\n|April 25\n|Iowa Crush\n|Home\n|Won 30-0\n|-\n|May 2\n|Minnesota Vixen\n|Away\n|Won 54-16\n|-\n|May 9\n|Kansas City Tribe\n|Away\n|Lost 0-58\n|-\n|May 23\n|Iowa Crush\n|Home\n|Won 42-0\n|-\n|May 30\n|Minnesota Vixen\n|Home\n|Won 38-8\n|-\n|June 6\n|Kansas City Tribe\n|Home\n|Lost 12-19\n|-\n|June 27\n|Chattanooga Locomotion (Tier II Quarterfinal)\n|Home\n|Won 32-6\n|-\n|July 11\n|Carolina Phoenix (Tier II Semifinal)\n|Home\n|Won 28-6\n|-\n|July 25\n|Montreal Blitz (Tier II Championship)\n|Neutral (Round Rock)\n|Won 42-14\n|}\n2010\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Opponent\n!Home/Away\n!Result\n|-\n|April 3\n|Chicago Force\n|Away\n|Lost 0-42\n|-\n|April 17\n|Chicago Force\n|Home\n|Lost 7-30\n|-\n|April 24\n|Erie Illusion\n|Home\n|Won 19-0\n|-\n|May 1\n|Wisconsin Wolves\n|Away\n|Won 50-12\n|-\n|May 8\n|Kansas City Tribe\n|Away\n|Lost 0-44\n|-\n|May 15\n|Iowa Crush\n|Home\n|Won 40-0\n|-\n|May 22\n|Minnesota Vixen\n|Home\n|Won 55-0\n|-\n|June 5\n|Iowa Crush\n|Away\n|Won 28-0\n|-\n|June 12 - Midwest Division\n|Memphis Belles\n|Home\n|Won 36-6\n|-\n|July 10 - Western Conference\n|Bay Area Bandits\n|Away\n|Lost 2-35\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.iwflsports.com/ IWFL website]"
