Sri Lanka posted their highest ever ODI total against Pakistan by scoring 368/4 in 50 overs.\nHe made his Twenty20 International debut for Sri Lanka against Pakistan on 30 July 2015. He was the highest run scorer for Sri Lanka in that match, where he had quick 35 runs, until he gets caught. Sri Lanka eventually lost the match at the end. His first T20 international wicket came on second match of the series, where he took the wicket of Shoaib Malik.\nMilinda made his Test debut on 14 October 2015, against the West Indies. Before gaining the Test cap, he scored an unbeaten century in the three-day practice match against the same side.\nIn the second match of the series, Milinda top scored valuable 68 runs where Sri Lanka were all out for 200 runs in first innings. He showed a good talent with the ball, where he took 2 wickets for 25 runs and with the help of pacer Dhammika Prasad, who got 4 wickets, Windies were all out for 163. In the second innings, Milinda again scored quick 42 runs, just lost his maiden Test fifty. As Sri Lanka only scored 206 runs, Windies only required 244 runs to win the match and level the series.
