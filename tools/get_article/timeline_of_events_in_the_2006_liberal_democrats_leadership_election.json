The Guardian reported that the letter was circulated by Treasury spokesperson and potential leadership challenger Vince Cable, and that Sarah Teather, Andrew George, Sandra Gidley, and Michael Moore were also among the signatories (although The Guardian noted that Menzies Campbell, Simon Hughes and Mark Oaten were understood to have refused to sign the letter). BBC News the next day lists the other signatories as David Laws, Chris Huhne, Ed Davey, Norman Baker, John Thurso and Norman Lamb. In an interview with BBC News 24 Norman Baker confirmed his signature, as did Norman Lamb on the BBC's Newsnight.\n*Charles Kennedy made a statement to the media, admitting past problems with alcohol for which he had sought professional help, stating his determination to continue leading the party and calling for party members to have their say over his continued leadership.\n*In the immediate aftermath of the statement, several prominent Liberal Democrats rule themselves out of standing for the leadership against Kennedy, including Mark Oaten, Lembit Öpik, and Norman Baker. Öpik gives strong support to Kennedy, but Baker was more guarded about whether there should be a new leader. Menzies Campbell reiterated that he would not stand against Kennedy.\n6 January\n*Media speculation continued that many of the party's MPs were trying to persuade Kennedy to resign before the leadership contest. The letter of lost confidence and asking for resignation, drafted by Vincent Cable before Christmas 2005 and signed by eleven frontbenchers, was delivered to Mr. Kennedy. Nick Harvey has said he was prepared to table a motion of no confidence in the leader at the following week's weekly meeting of the parliamentary party. This was to enable those that would not stand against Kennedy to enter the contest, notably Mark Oaten and Menzies Campbell. Opinion amongst journalists seemed split on whether Kennedy would yield to this pressure to resign, stand unopposed or be challenged in the contest. Further public developments and statements by prominent Liberal Democrats made in reference to the question of Kennedy's leadership were:\n*The leader of the British Liberal Democrats in the European Parliament, Chris Davies MEP, said Kennedy was a \"dead man walking\".\n*Ex-frontbench MP and then peer Jenny Tonge, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, accuses Kennedy of \"destroying the party\" and said that she was \"appalled, saddened, disgusted\" by Kennedy's statement that he was an alcoholic. She said his calling of a leadership contest \"underhand\" by ignoring the calls of many of his MPs to step down and instead appealing directly to the party membership 'grassroots'.\n*Nick Harvey MP said Kennedy's position was untenable. He describes Kennedy's standing in the leadership contest as an \"absurd charade\" comparing the leadership contest to a \"Soviet Union-style mock election\".\n*International Development spokesperson, and former Parliamentary Private Secretary to Charles Kennedy, Andrew George declared that he would resign from the Liberal Democrat frontbench on Monday 9 January  if Kennedy was still leader. Trade spokesperson Norman Lamb, who also previously served as Kennedy's PPS, declared his intention to similarly resign. Both were signatories to the letter expressing no confidence.\n*According to the BBC, Phil Willis MP said that MPs were wrong to dismiss the prospect of a leadership vote for all party members, in apparent support for Kennedy continuing to stand.\n*BBC News reported that over twenty Liberal Democrat frontbenchers were threatening resignation if Kennedy does not go, and some other MPs were declaring that they would refuse to fill any vacancies created.\n*Matthew Taylor, a close friend of Kennedy's who ran his successful leadership campaign in the 1999 leadership election, tells BBC News 24 that he feels it was essential for both Kennedy personally and the party that he step down from the leadership.\n*The Liberal Democrat peer and MEP, Baroness Nicholson, also urged Mr Kennedy to resign, saying that he needed to concentrate on his fight against his drink problem.\n*Howard Sykes, of the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors, came out in support of Kennedy saying grassroots activists would back him and that he was surprised that MPs were not prepared to do the same\n*At 18:25, Ed Davey and Sarah Teather were at the head of twenty-five Liberal Democrat MPs, including nineteen members of the frontbench, issuing a joint statement declaring that they could no longer support Kennedy's leadership and serve under him. They called on Kennedy to resign over the weekend. They include eight members of the \"Shadow Cabinet\" and eleven MPs first elected at the 2005 general election.\n**The MPs were Norman Baker, Tom Brake, Alistair Carmichael, Nick Clegg, Ed Davey, Andrew George, Sandra Gidley, Jeremy Browne, Tim Farron, Lynne Featherstone, Julia Goldsworthy, Evan Harris, Nick Harvey, Martin Horwood, Chris Huhne, Norman Lamb, David Laws, John Pugh, Dan Rogerson, Adrian Sanders, Jo Swinson, Matthew Taylor, Sarah Teather, Stephen Williams, Jenny Willott\n*The BBC's Newsnight reports that thirty-three MPs, over half the parliamentary party, feel that Kennedy's continued leadership was untenable.\n7 January\n*John Hemming, the only Liberal Democrat MP not to sign Kennedy's nomination papers for leader in May 2005, said on his blog that he was considering whether to stand against Kennedy or not, but had not yet made a final decision.\n*At 15:00 GMT, Charles Kennedy resigned as leader of the Liberal Democrats. He explained that he had been \"inundated\" with support from ordinary members of the party, but felt he no longer had sufficient support among MPs. His resignation was with immediate effect, with Deputy Leader Menzies Campbell to act as interim leader.\n*Within minutes, Ed Davey and Lembit Öpik declared that they would not be candidates in the election, Davey saying he would support Campbell and Öpik saying he would support Oaten (if Oaten stands). Later that day, Öpik said he supports Oaten's strategy of consulting with the other contenders.\n*Simon Hughes said that he would not make any announcement immediately as he has to fulfill his duties as party President first.\n*Mark Oaten said he had not yet decided and would reflect on the situation over the weekend. He said he intends to have discussions with Hughes and Campbell as the other \"contenders\". Immediately after Kennedy's resignation, he indicated he favoured a single, unity candidate and avoiding an election.\n*Sir Menzies Campbell, the interim leader, quickly announced his intention to stand in the upcoming contest and received immediate support from Nick Clegg, Malcolm Bruce and Chris Davies. Matthew Taylor had also said to BBC News 24 he would support Campbell if he stands.\n*As Chief Executive of the party, Lord Rennard said that he cannot indicate his support for any particular candidate.\n*Julia Goldsworthy told BBC News 24 that she supports Campbell for the leadership, but hoped that the election would be contested. Simon Ashley, leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Manchester City Council, declared support for Simon Hughes.\n*To BBC News 24, Vince Cable said he would \"do a very good job\" as leader himself, but that he would \"defer to\" and support Campbell.\n*John Hemming posts again on his blog to call for a contested election and reiterates that he was still contemplating standing following Kennedy's resignation.\n8 January\n*Charles Kennedy calls for the election for his successor to be contested so that party members could have \"direct input\", having been \"shut out\" from the decision on his fate.\n*A BBC Survey indicated that Sir Menzies Campbell already had the backing of at least twenty-three of the sixty-two Liberal Democrat MPs.\n9 January\n* Hughes and Oaten widely reported to be considering standing.\n* A second YouGov poll of 406 party members put Campbell on 49%, Hughes on 21% and Oaten on 13%.\n* In a rare public intervention in Liberal Democrat internal affairs, former Leader Paddy Ashdown endorsed Campbell.\n* Sir Menzies Campbell was set to make his first appearance as Acting Leader at 14:30 in the House of Commons.\n*Oaten said he was \"toying\" with the idea of standing and would make an announcement either way on 10 January. He expressed the view that there should be a contest of some kind as party members were feeling \"pretty excluded from the process so far\". This was a change to his earlier suggestion that it might be better for the party to unite around a single candidate.\n*Hughes said he would reveal his intentions within the week.\n*Phil Willis said he would stand to challenge Campbell if no other candidates emerged as he felt party members should be involved.\n*John Hemming was collecting nominations.\n*At the end of the day Oaten dropped strong hints in an on camera interview that he would stand, citing heavy public support received.
