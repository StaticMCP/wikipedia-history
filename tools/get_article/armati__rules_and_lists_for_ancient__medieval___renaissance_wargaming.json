Armati offers an immersive look into ancient, medieval, and renaissance warfare and the drama of historical battles—from Macedonian phalanxes to Mongol cavalry.\nPublication history\nArmati was designed by Arty Conliffe and published by Quantum Printing. Conliffe also wrote the Advanced Armati supplement.\nReception\nPyramid magazine reviewed Armati and stated that \"Armati is the opposite of everything non-miniatures players hate about miniatures rules. Armati is clean and concise. It can be picked up after a quick read-through. Its cover is bright and attractive. It's well laid-out with plenty of examples given. You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars on miniatures to field an army. You'll seldom run up against a rules lawyer. And the rules are written in English.\"\nReferences"
