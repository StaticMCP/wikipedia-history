The White family variously owned and leased the whole of the land from the present town of Beaudesert as well as a large proportion of the land running from Beaudesert to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, in the neighbourhood of Nerang, Southport, and Coomera. This large land holding was cut up into smaller properties. In 1877,  was resumed from the Nooininbah and Kerrylarabah pastoral runs and offered for selection on 17 April 1877.

When the old St Mary's church in Beaudesert was replaced by a larger building (the current St Mary's), the old St Mary's church was relocated to Kerry and renamed St John's Catholic Church, while St Columba's church was sold to local farmer Tom Plunkett and was relocated to be used by him as a barn.
