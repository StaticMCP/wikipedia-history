It was a twin-engine aircraft with a fuselage derived from the single-engine Curtiss Thrush. The Kingbird had two engine nacelles mounted on the struts on either side of the fuselage that braced the wing and the outrigger undercarriage. A distinctive design feature was the aircraft's blunt nose, located behind the propeller arcs. This allowed the engines to be mounted closer to each other and to the aircraft's centerline, therefore minimising asymmetrical thrust in case of an engine failure. For the same reason, the Thrush's single tailfin was replaced by twin tails on the Kingbird, and the main production model, the D-2 fitted a second horizontal stabilizer and elevator between these fins.\nEastern Air Transport was to be the Kingbird's main operator, flying 14 of them for a few years. The United States Marine Corps also purchased an example, first designating it JC-1, then RC-1 and using it as an air ambulance.\nVariants\n; Kingbird C: Prototype powered by 185&nbsp;hp (138&nbsp;kW) six-cylinder Curtiss R-600 Challenger engines. One built, but found to be underpowered. Later converted to Kingbird J-1.\n; Kingbird D-1: Second and third prototypes (previously Kingbird J-3 and J-2) powered by 225&nbsp;hp nine-cylinder Wright Whirlwind J-6-7 radial engines. Later converted to D-2 standard.\n; Kingbird D-2: Production aircraft with two 300&nbsp;hp (224&nbsp;kW) Whirlwind J-6-9 engines. 14 built plus two converted from D-1s.\n; Kingbird D-3: One-off Curtiss executive transport. Two 330&nbsp;hp (246&nbsp;kW) Whirlwind J-6-9 engines. Seats for five passengers.\n; Kingbird J-1: First prototype after re-engining with Whirlwind engines.\n; Kingbird J-2: Third prototype, J-6-7 engines.\n; Kingbird J-3: Second prototype, J-6-9 engines.\n; RC-1: Single Kingbird D-2 for US Navy, originally ordered as JC-1 (J for utility), but delivered as RC-1 (R for transport).\nOperators\n;\n* Eastern Air Transport\n* United States Marine Corps\n;\n* Turkish Airlines (under former official name: State Airlines Administration)\nSpecifications (D-2)\n|empty weight lb=3877\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight lb=6115\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight lb=\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=2\n|eng1 name=Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind\n|eng1 type=9-cylinder air-cooled radial piston engine\n|eng1 hp=300\n|prop blade number=\n|prop name=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop dia note=\n|max speed mph=142\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed mph=112\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|minimum control speed mph=\n|minimum control speed note=\n|range miles=415\n|range note=\n|combat range miles=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling ft=16000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|climb rate ftmin=1000\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*  A contemporary technical article on the Kingbird, with details of the version with 225&nbsp;hp Whirlwind J-6-7 engines.\n* [http://www.aerofiles.com/_curtx.html aerofiles.com]\n* [https://archive.today/20070709064846/http://www.generalaviationnews.com/editorial/articledetail.lasso?-token.key=632&-token.src=column&-nothing generalaviationnews.com]"
