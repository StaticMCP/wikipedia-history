DNF was introduced in Fedora 18 in 2013 as a replacement for yum; it has been the default package manager since Fedora 22 in 2015 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 in 2019 and is also an alternative package manager for Mageia. DNF performs package management tasks on top of RPM, and supporting libraries.\nHistory\nPerceived deficiencies of yum (which DNF is intended to address) include poor performance, high memory usage, and the slowness of its iterative dependency resolution. DNF uses libsolv, an external dependency resolver.\nDNF was originally written in Python, but , efforts were under way to port it to C and move most functionality from Python code into the new libdnf library. In 2018, the DNF team announced the decision to move libdnf from C to C++. libdnf is already used by PackageKit, a Linux distribution-agnostic package system abstraction library, even though the library doesn't have most of DNF's features.\nSince the launch of Fedora Linux 41, DNF5 is the new default packaging tool. This release features new performance enhancements, updated terminal output, and fully integrated modularity.\nAdoption\nDNF has been the default command-line package manager for Fedora since version 22, which was released in May 2015. The libdnf library is used as a package backend in PackageKit, which offers a graphical user interface (GUI). Later, dnfdragora was developed for Fedora 27 as another alternative graphical front-end of DNF. DNF has also been available as an alternate package manager for Mageia Linux since version 6 and may become the default sometime in the future.\nIn Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and by extension, AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux, yum is an alias for dnf.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
