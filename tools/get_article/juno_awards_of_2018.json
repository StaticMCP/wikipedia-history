The primary telecast ceremonies were held at Rogers Arena. Vancouver previously hosted the Juno Awards in 1991, 1998 and 2009. Michael Bublé hosted these awards after having stepped down from his scheduled hosting the previous year due to his son's cancer diagnosis. Nominations were announced on 6 February 2018.\nChanges in 2018 from previous years include the reintroduction of the Juno Award for Comedy Album of the Year, a category which has not been awarded since 1984, and the ceremony's television broadcast returning to CBC Television, after previously being broadcast by CTV.\nPotential host city bids\nIn September 2015, the Capital Region Music Awards Society in Victoria, British Columbia announced its intention to bid for hosting the 2018 Juno Awards. Victoria made a bid to host the 2014 Junos, but that year's ceremonies were hosted in Winnipeg.\nIn April 2016, various groups in Edmonton were also investigating a potential bid for the 2018 Juno Awards. The city previously hosted the Junos in 2004.\nIn early April 2017, Vancouver was announced as the 2018 Juno Awards host after the 2017 awards concluded. On 19 April 2017, it was announced that CBC Television would take over broadcast rights to the Junos beginning in 2018, their first since 2001.\nEvents\nJann Arden and Bob Rock performed and hosted at the Songwriters' Circle on 25 March, prior to the main awards ceremony. The Juno Cup charity hockey game between musicians and former NHL players was held at the Bill Copeland Sports Centre in Burnaby on 23 March.\nPerformers\nPerformers for the main ceremony included Jessie Reyez, Arkells, Daniel Caesar, Lights, Arcade Fire, Dallas Green and Sarah Harmer. Canadian pop-rock band Hedley were originally part of the Juno lineup, but pulled out due to sexual harassment allegations against lead singer and 2015 host Jacob Hoggard On 19 February, Hedley announced that they withdrew all their nominations from the Juno Awards.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of musical performances\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Song(s)\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Main show\n|-\n|Arcade Fire\n|\"Everything Now\"\n|-\n|The Jerry Cans\n|\"Ukiuq\"\n|-\n|Shawn Hook & the B.C.
