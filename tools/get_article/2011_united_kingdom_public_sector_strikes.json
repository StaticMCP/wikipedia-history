In Scotland just 30 of the 2,700 council run schools remained open. In Wales around 80% were believed shut and in Northern Ireland more than 50% of 1,200 schools were closed.\nIn the health sector, NHS managers estimated that some 6,000 out of 30,000 routine operations had been cancelled throughout the UK, as well as tens of thousands of appointments. London Ambulance Service told the BBC that it was struggling and people not in a life-threatening condition might not get an ambulance.\nThe strike saw walkouts by tens of thousands of border agency staff, probation officers, radiographers, librarians, job centre staff, court staff, social workers, refuse collectors, midwives, road sweepers, cleaners, school meals staff, paramedics, tax inspectors, customs officers, passport office staff, police civilian staff, driving test examiners, patent officers and health and safety inspectors.\nIn Wales unions reported around 170,000 workers on strike, and in Scotland around 300,000.\nUp to 1,000 marches and rallies took place across the UK. Four arrests were made ahead of the national rally in London, two for assaulting an officer and two for possession of a weapon.\nReactions\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron said that the strike was a \"damp squib\", with many key services continuing to operate. The government claimed that the turnout was \"much lower\" than the two million claimed by the unions.  On The One Show, BBC presenter Jeremy Clarkson expressed his pleasure at the strikes leaving the roads empty, and claimed that he would kill the striking workers. \"I would have them all shot\", he said. \"I would take them outside and execute them in front of their families\". The One Show apologised at the end of the show to viewers who may have been offended by Jeremy Clarkson's comments.\nYouGov reported that 40% of British people supported teachers going on strike and 49% opposed it. Figures were similar for civil servants striking, with 38% in support and 50% in opposition.\nSee also\n* 2012 United Kingdom fuel crisis\nReferences"
