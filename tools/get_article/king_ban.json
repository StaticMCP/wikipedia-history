      "text": "# King Ban\n\nBan of Benoic  (Old French: Ban de Bénoïc) is a character in Arthurian legend. King Ban first appeared by this name in the Lancelot propre part of the 13th-century French Vulgate Cycle as the ruler of the realm in France named  (Bénoïc; alternatively Benewic, Benoich, Benoit, Benuic, Benwick) and father of Sir Lancelot and Sir Hector de Maris, as well as brother of King Bors. Ban of Benoic largely corresponds to the other versions of the father of Lancelot, including Pant of Gen[n]ewis in the German Lanzelet, Haud of Schuwake in the English Sir Lancelot du Lake, and Domolot of Lokva in the Belarusian .\nRole in Arthurian romances\nBan's kingdom of Benoic is located at the border between Armorican Brittany and Gaul. With his wife Queen Elaine (Élaine, a sister of King Bors' wife Evaine), King Ban begets the future great knight Lancelot (birth name Galahad, Galaad).  Thanks to Merlin's magic, he sleeps with the Lady de Maris (Dame des Mares), who becomes illegitimately pregnant with Hector de Maris (Hector des Mares), Lancelot's half-brother and later one of his closest companions and followers.\nIn the Suite du Merlin, King Ban is shown campaigning in insular Britain in support of the young King Arthur. In the Prose Lancelot, his border castle of Trebe is located in the middle of a marsh reputed to be impregnable, but the neighboring lord, King Claudas of the Terre Deserte, manages to set it on fire. Ban escapes with his wife and their infant son but, overwhelmed by the disaster, promptly dies of grief. At this moment, the infant Lancelot is taken by the Lady of the Lake to her abode, where he is later joined by Bors the Elder's sons Lionel and Bors the Younger. When the children grow up and become Knights of the Round Table, they aid Arthur in finally defeating Claudas and reclaiming their fathers' lands. The war between King Ban and Claudas may recall the early medieval struggle of the Bretons against the invading Franks, although the most complete version found in the Lancelot-Grail more closely resembles the contemporary rivalry between King Philip II of France and the Anglo-French House of Plantagenet.\nConjectured origin in Welsh myth\nAccording to Roger Sherman Loomis, \"Ban is usually called Ban of Benoic, easily accounted for as a misunderstanding of Bran le Benoit, an exact translation of the Welsh Bendigeid Bran, or 'Bran the Blessed'.\" That is, the Vulgate author has misread and misconstrued the Old French benoit (='blessed') to be the name of a non-existent realm Benoic - of which he deduces King B(r)an to have been the ruler. The name Ban de Benoic/Benewic is also found in mutated form as Pant von Genewis (scribal error where initial 'B' misread as 'G') in another early Arthurian text treating of the hero Lancelot, namely the Lanzelet of Ulrich von Zatzikhoven.\nAs professors Loomis and Helaine Newstead have demonstrated, there is a tendency for individual figures from Celtic mythology to yield multiple characters in Arthurian romances and this process is apparent in the number of Arthurian characters whose names and/or attributes can be traced back to the gigantic king (see also Fisher King) and probable deity, Brân, whose exploits are recounted in Branwen ferch Llŷr (see also Llŷr), the second of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. Newstead wrote: \"The evidence concerning Ban, though it survives in obscure and refractory forms, nevertheless preserves connections with Baudemaguz, Brangor, Bron and Corbenic.\"\nLoomis believed one of the authors of the Vulgate Lancelot preserved the memory of two figures from Welsh myth through their relation to Welsh toponyms: if it be accepted that the character of King Ban is indeed derived (as noted above) from Brân the Blessed, it follows that the Kingdom of King Ban is to be equated with the 'Land of Brân', which in Welsh designates the northeast of Wales. Abutting on the 'Land of Brân' was the 'Retreat of Gwri' (now known as the Wirral peninsula). Loomis suggested that the name Bohours de Gannes given to the brother of King Ban / Brân in the Vulgate text is part scribal error ('Bohours' for an original, 'Gwri'-derived 'Gohours') and part geographical rationalization (substitution of 'Gannes' for 'Galles', i.e. of 'Gaul' for 'Wales').\nIn modern culture\nBan appears in Bernard Cornwell's The Warlord Chronicles, as the king of the Brythonic-Celtic kingdom of Benoic, in Armorica, and the father of Lancelot and Galahad. Cornwell places Ban’s capital, Ynys Trebes, at Mont-Saint-Michel. Ban is depicted as extremely erudite, speaking \"British [Brythonic], Latin, Greek, and some small Arabic.\" However, his preoccupation with poetry and learning above military concerns leaves his city vulnerable to attack by the Franks.\nBan is depicted as the \"Fox Sin of Greed\", a member of the titular group of knights, in Nakaba Suzuki's 2012 manga The Seven Deadly Sins. In the series, Ban is tall, with spiky white hair and a very youthful appearance, due to being immortal after having drunk from the Fountain of Youth. He eventually has a child named Lancelot at the end of the series.\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\n*\n*\n*"
