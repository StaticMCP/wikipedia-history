(道果親王)\nEvents of Toba's life\nWhen his mother died, his grandfather, former-Emperor Shirakawa, took him under his care and raised him.\n* August 9, 1107 (Kajō 2, 19th day of the 7th month): In the 21st year of Emperor Horikawa's reign (堀河天皇21年), the emperor (\"tennō\") died at the age of 29; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his only son.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor Toba is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).\nDuring the initial years of Toba's reign, the actual power was held by his grandfather, the \"retired\" Emperor Shirakawa, in a process known as cloistered rule.\n* 1110 (''Ten'ei 3, 6th month): The Miidera-ji burned down.  This was the second time the temple was destroyed by fire, the first time being in 1081.\n* February 25, 1123 (Hōan 4, 28th day of the 1st month''): In the 17th year of Emperor Toba's reign (鳥羽天皇17年), Toba was forced to abdicate by his grandfather, retired-Emperor Shirakawa.  Toba gave up the throne in favor of his son Akihito, who would become Emperor Sutoku.  Toba was only 20 years old when he renounced his title; and he had already reigned for 16 years:  two in the nengō Tennin, three in ''Ten'ei, five in the nengō Eikyū, two in Gen'ei, and four in the nengō Hōan.  At this time, Toba took the title Daijō-tennō.  The succession (senso) was received by his son.\n* 1123 (Hōan 4, 2nd month): Emperor Sutoku is said to have acceded to the throne (sokui).\n* 1129 (Daiji 4): \"retired\" Emperor Shirakawa died; and Toba himself began to rule as cloistered emperor.  Toba continued to hold power through the reigns of three emperors, Emperor Sutoku, Emperor Konoe, and Emperor Go-Shirakawa.\n* 1134 (Chōshō 3): The former-Emperor Toba made a pilgrimage to the Kumano Shrines.  He was accompanied by sadaijin  Hanazono no Arahito and udaijin Naka-no-in Munetada.  The excursion was enjoyed by all, and great quantities of sake were consumed.\nKugyō\nKugyō'' (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Toba's reign, this apex of the Daijō-kan included:\n* Sesshō, Fujiwara Tadazane, 1078–1162.\n* Kampaku, Fujiwara Tadazane.\n* Kampaku, Fujiwara Tadamichi, 1097–1164.\n* Daijō-daijin, Fujiwara Tadazane.\n* Sadaijin, Fujiwara Tadamichi.\n* Sadaijin, Hanazono no Arahito.\n* Udaijin, Naka-no-in Munetada.\n* Naidaijin\n* Dainagon\nEras of Toba's reign\nThe years of Toba's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or nengō.\n* Kajō            (1106–1108)\n* Tennin  (1108–1110)\n* Ten-ei               (1110–1113)\n* Eikyū          (1113–1118)\n* ''Gen'ei               (1118–1120)\n* Hōan            (1120–1124)\nAncestry\nSee also\n* Emperor of Japan\n* List of Emperors of Japan\n* Imperial cult\n* Emperor Go-Toba\nNotes\n— a stylized chrysanthemum blossom]]\nReferences\n* Brown, Delmer M. and Ichirō Ishida, eds.
