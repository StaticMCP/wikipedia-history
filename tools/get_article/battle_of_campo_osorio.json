Alongside the Federalists also fought the Navy mutineers following the admiral.\nThe battle resulted in the death of Saldanha da Gama, one of the main leaders of the federalists and, consequently, in the weakening of the revolution, which was officially ended with a peace treaty signed in Pelotas, between the government and Joca Tavares on behalf of the rebels, in August 23 of the same year.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
