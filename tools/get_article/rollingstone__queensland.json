In the , the locality of Rollingstone had a population of 133 people.\nGeography\nRollingstone is a semi-rural/residential area approximately  north of Townsville, Queensland, Australia, and  south of Ingham, Queensland. The locality is roughly shaped like an hourglass with the town at the narrow centre area.\nRollingston Creek flows to the south and east of the town and into the Coral Sea and forms, in part, the boundary between Rollingstone and neighbouring Balgal Beach.\nThe Bruce Highway traverses Rollingstone from the south-east to the north, but deviates slightly to the south of the town.\nThe North Coast railway line runs roughly parallel to the highway but to the north and passes through the town. The locality was served by two railway stations:\n* Kinduro railway station, in the north of the locality, now abandoned ()\n* Rollingstone railway station, serving the town ()\nKinduro is a neighbourhood in the locality () around the railway station of the same name. The name Kinduro is an Aboriginal word meaning clear water.\nHistory\nSettled in 1883 by John Lambert, the district was originally a pastoral lease known as Armidale, extending from Bluewater Creek in the south to Clerk Creek (later known as Ollera Creek) in the north.\nIn 1906, the Armidale Hotel opened along the stagecoach route between Townsville and Ingham.\nOnce the North Coast railway opened through the area in 1915, the Armidale railway station also served as a post office as the mail was delivered by train. However concern over possible confusion with Armidale in New South Wales resulted in the town and railway station being renamed Rollingstone after the creek, which is believed to be named for the round shape of the rocks found in the creek bed. The hotel was renamed the Rollingstone Hotel.\nRollingstone State School officially opened on 4 September 1916 with 28 students on land donated by the hotel owners, John and Isabella Fitzpatrick.\nThe opening of the railway opened up the beaches north of Townsville for recreational use. The beach near Rollingstone just south of the mouth of Rollingstone Creek was surveyed for a town in 1947 and named Balgal with town land allotments being sold in 1948 onwards (this area is now a separate suburb called Balgal Beach).\nRollingstone and District Community Association was established in 1961 and operated a community hall was located on the Bruce Highway.
