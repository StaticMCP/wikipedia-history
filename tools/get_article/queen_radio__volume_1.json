It was released on August 26, 2022 by Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Republic Records.\nThe album includes songs from all five of her studio albums, the mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty (2009), and the Young Money Entertainment compilation Rise of an Empire (2014).\nCritical reception\nAndy Kellman of AllMusic called it a \"generous anthology\", while rating it 4.5 stars out of 5. Paper Mag Kenna McCafferty thought that \"the 28 tracks were perfectly selected\", as the collection is \"jam-packed with [some of] Minaj’s biggest bangers\".\nCommercial performance\nQueen Radio: Volume 1 debuted at number 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart, earning 32,000 album-equivalent units (including 3,000 copies in pure album sales) in its first week, making Nicki Minaj the female rapper with the most solo top 10 albums in Billboard 200 history with six.\nTrack listing\n| total_length  = 107:28\n| extra_column  = Producer(s)\n| title1        = Super Freaky Girl\n| note1         = from Pink Friday 2, 2023\n| writer1       =\n| extra1        =\n| length1       = 2:50\n| title2        = Super Freaky Girl\n| note2         = Queen mix) (featuring JT, Bia, Katie Got Bandz, Akbar V, and Maliibu Miitch;
