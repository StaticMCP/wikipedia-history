The department is administered by a secretary who is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate.\nThe department is directed and supervised by a nine-member Board of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, who serve staggered six year terms and are appointed by the governor. Two of the board members are required to be consumer representatives, while the other seven are required to have an agricultural background.\nHistory\nThe department traces its history back to the Wisconsin Territory, with early efforts to establish inspection of food and other farm products and establish a program to regulate weights and measures.  County treasurers were then empowered to enforce standards.  In 1867, the state government established a position under the State Treasurer to enforce further quality standards.  That system was supplemented in 1889 with the creation of the Office of Dairy and Food Commissioner to enforce food safety, food labeling, and laws on weights and measures.  The state also established a State Veterinarian to evaluate farm animals, a state board of agriculture, an inspector of apiaries, a state orchard and nursery inspector, a state supervisor of illuminating oils, and a state humane agent.\nThe first state Department of Agriculture was created in 1915 by Governor Emanuel L. Philipp, by merging the functions of these several different inspectors and regulators.  The department was led by a commissioner, appointed by the governor and confirmed by the State Senate.\nThe Division of Markets was created within the department of Agriculture in 1919, in order to improve and promote the market for Wisconsin farm products.  The division was established as a separate Department of Markets in 1921, and granted additional powers to regulate unfair competition and trade practices.\nThe Departments of Agriculture and the Department of Markets were re-combined in 1929 as the Department of Agriculture and Markets. The department was overseen by three commissioners who were all appointed by the governor, and a secretary selected by the commissioners.\nIn 1939, the department was renamed the Department of Agriculture. The department was then overseen by a seven-member Board of Agriculture, who were all appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate. All seven members were required to have an agricultural background. This board appointed the department's Secretary.\nThe department was renamed again in 1977 to its present name&mdash;the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection.  The 1977 law also established that one of the seven members of the Board of Agriculture must be a consumer representative.\nIn 1995, the state legislature changed the law around appointment of the secretary of the department, allowing for a direct gubernatorial appointment, rather than a selection by the Board.  The Board was also expanded to eight members, with two being consumer representatives.  The Board was expanded again in 1997 to nine members.\nDivisions\n*Agricultural Development: promotes Wisconsin products and provides counseling and mediation services to farmers\n*Agricultural Resource Management: protects resources and public health\n*Animal Health: works to diagnose, prevent, and control serious animal diseases\n*Food Safety: regulates food production\n*Management Services: provides the administrative work for the department\n*Trade and Consumer Protection: enforces consumer protection laws\nSecretaries and Commissioners\nCommissioners of Agriculture (1915&ndash;1929)\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!
