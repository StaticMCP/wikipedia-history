A disputed Himalayan border was the main cause of the war. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. India initiated a defensive Forward Policy from 1960 to hinder Chinese military patrols and logistics, in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the McMahon Line, the eastern portion of the Line of Actual Control proclaimed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959.\nNathu La and Cho La clashes (1967)\nThe Nathu La and Cho La clashes took place from September–October of 1967. The Nathu La clashes started on 11 September 1967, when China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) launched an attack on Indian posts at Nathu La, and lasted till 15 September 1967. In October 1967, another military duel took place at Cho La and ended on the same day. According to independent sources, India achieved \"decisive tactical advantage\" and managed to hold its own against and push back Chinese forces. Many PLA fortifications at Nathu La were destroyed, where the Indian troops drove back the attacking Chinese forces. Another battle took place at Cho La a few kilometers south a few days later. The military duel lasted one day, during which the Chinese were driven away, which boosted Indian morale. According to Indian Maj. Gen. Sheru Thapliyal, the Chinese were forced to withdraw nearly three kilometers in Cho La during the clash. The Defence Ministry of India reported: 88 killed and 163 wounded on the Indian side, while 340 killed and 450 wounded on the Chinese side, during the two incidents.\nSino-Soviet border conflict (1969)\n*1969 – Zhenbao Island\nVietnam War (1955–1975)\n*1974 – Paracel Islands\nLaotian Civil War (1958–1975)\n*1967 – 1967 Opium War\nSino-Vietnamese War (1979)\n*1979 – Battle of Cao Ba Lanh\n*1979 – Battle of Móng Cái\n*1979 – 1979 Battle of Đồng Đăng\n*1979 – Battle of Lao Cai\n*1979 – Battle of Cam Duong\n*1979 – 1979 Battle of Cao Bằng\n*1979 – 1979 Battle of Lạng Sơn\nSino-Vietnamese conflicts (1979–1991)\n*1981 – Battle of Fakashan\n*1984 – Battle of Laoshan\n*1986 – Operation Blue Sword-B\n*1988 – Johnson South Reef Skirmish\nSumdorong Chu standoff (1986–1987)\nMali War (2012–present)\n2013 Depsang standoff\n2017 China–India border standoff\n2020–2021 China–India skirmishes\n2022 Yangtse clash\nSee also\n* Outline of the military history of the People's Republic of China\n* Outline of the Chinese Civil War\n* List of wars involving the People's Republic of China\n* List of wars involving the Republic of China\n* List of wars involving Taiwan\nNotes\nFurther reading\n* Graff, David Andrew, and Robin Higham, eds.
