There are awards for forms of writing ranging from poetry to novels. Many awards are also dedicated to a certain genre of fiction or non-fiction writing (such as science fiction or politics). Most literary awards come with a corresponding award ceremony.\nBackground\nThe Myanmar National Literature Awards have been presented since 1970. They are for the best works published in the previous year in each category as determined by a selection committee from Sarpay Beikman (\"Palace of Literature\"), a division of the Ministry of Information that is concerned with promoting books in Burmese and other national languages. Sarpay Beikman also gives the Sarpay Beikman Manuscript Awards for unpublished works that are submitted in manuscript.\nIn recent years the genres covered by Sarpay Beikman Manuscript and National Literary Awards have been gradually extended and the number of awards increased.\nAs of 2007 there were twelve types of award, of which the recently instituted lifetime achievement award was the most prestigious.\nThe awards complement the privately sponsored Sayawun Tin Shwe Award, Pakokku U Ohn Pe literary award, Thuta Swesone literary award and Tun Foundation award.\nThe award has been given since 1962 for distinguished work in categories that include:\n*Myanmar National Literature Award for Fiction\n*Myanmar National Literature Award for Collected Short Stories\n*Myanmar National Literature Award for Translation\n*Myanmar National Literature Award for Collected Poems\n*Myanmar National Literature Award for Political Literature\n*Myanmar National Literature Award for Historical Documentary\n*Myanmar National Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement Award\nMaung Wuntha, a member of the selection committee for the National Literary Awards and a veteran journalist died on 11 August 2013.\nList\n1972\n* Mya Than Tint, Translation: War and Peace\n1977\n*Kyaw Win , Novel:Nout Aww Naga\n*Nu Yin, Poems\n*Hla Myo Nwe,Fiction\n1978\n* Mya Than Tint, Translation: Gone with the Wind\n1979\n*Saya Zawgyi for  (Damn You, Broken Heart) and Other Short Stories\n1986\n* Moe Moe (Inya) for Moe Moe's Short Stories\n* Maung Nyein Thu for Mya Ah Phuutwe Thit Thit Waie and Youth Short Stories\n1987\n*Saya Zawgyi for Ancient Bagan and Other Poems\n1988\n* Mya Than Tint, Translation: Dream of the Red Chamber\n1989\n*Saw Mon Nyin, Myanmar Women’s Clothing and Hairstyles\n1992\nNational Literary Awards for 1992 were announced on 2 December 1993.
