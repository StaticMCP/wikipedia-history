The Service unit works alongside the Royal Navy Medical Branch.\nAs of 1 January 2006, according to former Ministry of Defence junior minister Don Touhig, the QARNNS had a total strength of 90 Nursing Officers and 200 Naval Nurses (ratings) out of a requirement of 330.\nThe Navy List (2006) listed 92 QARNNS Officers, of whom two were captains (including one DNNS/Matron-in-Chief), seven commanders, 19 lieutenant-commanders, 60 lieutenants and four sub-lieutenants.  The Navy List'' (1981) listed 146 QARNNS Officers, of whom one held the rank of Matron-in-Chief, two were Principal Matrons, four Matrons, 32 Superintending Sisters, 89 Senior Nursing Sisters and 13 Nursing Sisters; five of the 145 QARNNS Officers were non-nursing officers: two Senior Clerical and Quarters Officers and three Clerical and Quarters Officers.\nHistory\nduring the Second World War]]\nfor rescuing patients from a bombed hospital, 1942]]\nEarly developments of a Naval Nursing Service\nThe nursing staff who worked at both Haslar, which accepted its first patients in 1753, and Plymouth, which accepted its first patients in 1762, were usually widows of seamen or marines. Their conduct was not regarded as satisfactory. In 1854 the decision was taken to create an all-male nursing service ashore, similar to what there was afloat. The Crimean War (1854–1856) changed the field of nursing. Eliza Mackenzie, a Superintendent of nurses, and six female nurses, travelled to the Naval Hospital, Therapia in Turkey. They left for Therapia on Christmas day,1854. They were subsequently recognised by the Admiralty for their work. In 1883, a committee determined that improvements were needed in medical and nursing care in the Royal Navy. As such, in 1884, a uniformed Naval Nursing Service was introduced, staffed by trained nurses. These nurses served on shore, initially at Haslar and Plymouth.\nQueen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service\nIn 1902, Queen Alexandra became President of the Nursing Staff; in her honour, the Naval Nursing service was renamed Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service. She invited Eva Luckes, Matron of The London Hospital to help her establish the new service, and supplied  staff for it. In 1914  Alexandra, wrote to Lückes announcing that she was being awarded the Badge of the Red Cross Society ‘in grateful recognition of the invaluable services you have rendered in the organisation of the Royal Naval Nursing Service...'.\nQueen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service Reserve was established on 13 October 1910.\nIn 1914, with the outbreak of the First World War, QARNNS was significantly expanded, with many volunteers from the British Red Cross and civilian hospitals.\nSecond World War and until current time.\nDuring the Second World War, many volunteer QARNNS nurses were deployed overseas. In 1949 a nursing branch of the Women's Royal Naval Service was formed; however, in 1960 these nurses were integrated into QARNNS, creating a single nursing service. In 1982 an integrated service was formed, allowing men to serve as nurses in QARNNS. The first man to join was Senior Nursing Officer Rajendrasen Purusrum, who was commissioned on 1 March 1983.\nAlthough fully affiliated to the Royal Navy from 1977, QARNNS was technically a separate service until 31 March 2000, when it officially became part of the Royal Navy.\nQueen Alexandra was President until her death in 1925. The following year she was succeeded by Queen Mary. Princess Alexandra became Patron in 1955.\nRanks\nInitially there were only two ranks: Nursing Sister and Head Sister. In 1911 the intermediate rank of Superintending Sister was introduced. There was no overall head of the service until the introduction of the rank of Head Sister-in-Chief on 1 August 1927. By 1937 Head Sister and Head Sister-in-Chief had been renamed Matron and Matron-in-Chief.\nThe ranking system changed during the Second World War.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! QARNNS rank\n!

Their ranking system was similar to that of Royal Navy ratings.\nIn 1982, in preparation for the introduction of male officers, the Nursing Officers' ranking system was changed.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!QARNNS rank\n!Equivalent RN rank\n|-\n| Nursing Officer || Sub-Lieutenant\n|-\n| Senior Nursing Officer || Lieutenant\n|-\n| Superintending Nursing Officer || Lieutenant-Commander\n|-\n| Chief Nursing Officer || Commander\n|-\n| Principal Nursing Officer || Captain\n|-\n| Matron-in-Chief || Commodore\n|}\nIn 1995 the QARNNS adopted Royal Navy ranks, although the head of the Nursing Service was no longer a one-star equivalent, the senior Captain of the QARNNS was appointed Director Naval Nursing Service (DNNS) and styled with the historic post of Matron-in-Chief.\nEarly Sisters and Superintending Sisters of the QARNNS\nSeveral early members of the QARNNS were trained at The London Hospital under Eva Luckes.
