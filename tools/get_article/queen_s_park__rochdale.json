He died in 1873 without a will, so his estate reverted to Queen Victoria through the Duchy of Lancaster, who subsequently gifted the land to the Heywood Local Board. The park was laid out on the former grounds of Heywood House and opened on 2 August 1879.\nIn 1923 additional land was donated by alderman David Healey, which extended the park eastwards to include a boating lake.\nThe park was Grade II listed on 9 August 2001.\nFeatures\nQueen's Park Lodge and three-basin ornamental fountain were both designed by the Harrogate architectural practice H. E. and A. Bown in 1878.\nThe park contains a number of facilities, including a café, open-air theatre, children's play area, bowling greens and a tennis court.\nGallery\nFile:Queens Park Lodge, Heywood, geograph-6485392-by-David-Dixon.jpg|Queen's Park Lodge, Heywood, in 2020\nFile:Queens Park fountain - geograph.org.uk - 303012.jpg|Fountain at Queen's Park, Heywood, in 2007\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
