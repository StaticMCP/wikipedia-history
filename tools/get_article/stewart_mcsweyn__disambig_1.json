He was a finalist in the men's 1500 metres in the Tokyo Olympics, and has also been a World Championships and Commonwealth Games finalist in the 3000 metres steeplechase, 5000 metres and 10,000 metres.\nCareer\nEarly years\nMcSweyn grew up on a beef and sheep farm on King Island (population ~1,600) in the middle of Bass Strait, south of Melbourne, Victoria.\nThere was no high school on the island, so he boarded at Ballarat in Victoria. Being away from home at a young age, he built resilience which helps him cope with being overseas for lengthy periods of time. Up until he was 14 years old, he played cricket, tennis and Australian rules football, but he then decided to concentrate on athletics. At Ballarat, he was coached by Rod Griffin, middle- and long-distance runner Collis Birmingham, and his now training partner Brett Robinson.\nMcSweyn represented Australia at the 2013 World Cross Country Championships in the junior race, and in 2015 he ran the 5000m at the World University Games.\nInternational competition\nBeginning in 2016, McSweyn started regularly competing on the international circuit.\nHe represented Australia in the 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2017 World Championships.\nIn 2018, McSweyn placed third in both the 5000m and 3000m steeplechase races at the Gold Coast Australian Championships in February. In April at the Commonwealth Games, McSweyn placed 5th in the 5000m final in 13:58.96 and 11th in the 10,000m final in 28:58.22, respectively. At the Shanghai Diamond League meet, McSweyn placed 11th in the 5000m. He raced the 10,000m race at the Oslo Bislett Games in June and the 1500m in Germany, followed by Rabat Diamond League, where he placed third in a competitive 3000m field in 7:34.79. The time put him within two and a half seconds of Craig Mottram's Australian record in the event. He then raced in the London Müller Anniversary Games 5000m, finishing 12th. In August, McSweyn raced a mile at the Birmingham Müller Grand Prix, winning in 3:54.60. He then competed in the Rovereto Palio Città della Quercia in Italy, clocking 13:31.03 for 5000m. Notably, at the Bruxelles Memorial van Damme Diamond League Final, McSweyn achieved a 13:05.23 personal best over 5000m, finishing 12th in the race. Back on home soil in 2018, McSweyn rounded out his 2018 season by winning his second straight Melbourne Zatopek:10. His 27:50.89 brought him his second straight Australian 10,000m title.\nIn December 2019, McSweyn broke the Australian record for 10,000m, running 27:23.80 at the Zatopek:10, his third successive national championship at the distance.\nIn July 2021, McSweyn broke the Australian record for the mile, running 3:48.37, beating the record set by Craig Mottram in 2005 by 0.61 seconds.\nIn August 2021, at the Tokyo Olympics, his time of 3:31.91 in the 1500 metres earned him seventh place.\nIn February 2023 at the World Athletics Cross Country Championships, held in Australia, McSweyn achieved a bronze medal in the mixed relay, alongside Oliver Hoare, Jessica Hull and Abbey Caldwell.\nInternational competitions\n{|\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Representing\n|-\n|2015\n|Universiade\n|Gwangju, South Korea\n|14th\n|5000&nbsp;m\n|14:37.96\n|-\n|2017\n|World Championships\n|London, United Kingdom\n|40th (h)\n|3000&nbsp;m s'chase\n|8:47.53\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2018\n|rowspan=2|Commonwealth Games\n|rowspan=2|Gold Coast, Australia\n|5th\n|5000 m\n|13:58.96\n|-\n|11th\n|10,000 m\n|28:58.22\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2019\n|rowspan=2|World Championships\n|rowspan=2|Doha, Qatar\n|21st (sf)\n|1500 m\n|3:37.95\n|-\n|12th\n|5000 m\n|13:30.41\n|-\n|2021\n|Olympic Games\n|Tokyo, Japan\n|7th\n|1500 m\n|3:31.91\n|-\n|2022\n|World Championships\n|Eugene, United States\n|9th\n|1500 m\n|3:33.24\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2023\n|rowspan=2|World Championships\n|rowspan=2|Budapest, Hungary\n|24th (h)\n|1500 m\n|3:36.01\n|-\n|13th\n|5000 m\n|13:26.58\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2024\n|rowspan=2|Olympic Games\n|rowspan=2|Paris, France\n|12th (repechage)\n|1500 m\n|3:37.49\n|-\n|18th\n|5000 m\n|13:31.38\n|}\nPersonal bests\n;Track\n*1500 metres –  3:29.51 (Monaco Diamond League, 2021)\n*One mile – 3:48.37 (Oslo Diamond League, 2021)\n*3000 metres – 7:28.02 (Golden Gala, Rome 2020)\n*5000 metres – 12:56.07 (Los Angeles 2024)\n*10,000 metres – 27:23.38 (Zatopek 2019)\n*3000 metres steeplechase – 8:34.25 (Gothenburg 2017)\n;Road\n*5K run – 13:39 (RIga 2023)\n*10K run – 27:58 (Launceston 2025)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.athletics.com.au/athlete/stewart-mcsweyn/ Stewart McSweyn] at Australian Athletics\n* [https://athletics.possumbility.com/athletes/athlete6271.htm Stewart McSweyn] at Australian Athletics Historical Results\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20241007084522/https://www.olympics.com/en/paris-2024/athlete/stewart-mcsweyn_1939860 Stewart McSweyn] at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics (archived, [https://paris2024.rtve.es/es/paris-2024/atleta/stewart-mcsweyn_1939860 alternate link])"
