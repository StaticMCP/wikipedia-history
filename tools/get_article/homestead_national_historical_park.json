The Act eventually transferred  from public to private ownership.\nThe park is  west of Beatrice, Nebraska, on a site that includes some of the first acres successfully claimed under the Homestead Act.  The national monument was first included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. In 2015, the United States Mint released a commemorative quarter as part of the America the Beautiful series honoring the park.\nHomestead Heritage Center and Education Center\nThe Homestead Heritage Center, dedicated in 2007, contains exhibits that treat the effect of the Homestead Act on immigration, agriculture, native tribes, the tallgrass prairie ecosystem, and federal land policy.  The roof line of the center resembles a \"single bottom plow moving through the sod,\" and the parking lot measures exactly . A separate Education Center features science and social science presentations that can be shared with classrooms anywhere in the United States through distance-learning.\nFile:Entrance to the Homestead Heritage Center.jpg|Heritage Center entrance\nFile:Homestead Heritage Center.jpg|Heritage Center\nFile:Homestead Education Center at Homestead National Monument of America.jpg|Education Center\nTallgrass prairie\nThe park includes  of tallgrass prairie restored to approximate the ecosystem that once covered the central plains of the United States—and that was nearly plowed into extinction by the homesteaders.  This restoration, which necessitates regular mowing, haying, and prescribed burns, has been managed by the National Park Service for more than 60 years and is the oldest in the National Park System.  The park maintains about  of hiking trails through the prairie and the woodland surrounding Cub Creek, accessible via all-terrain wheelchair.\nPalmer-Epard Cabin\nIn 1867, George W. Palmer built the Palmer-Epard Cabin from mixed hardwoods about  northeast of the park. It measures  and is representative of the local construction style. Palmer lived in the cabin with his wife and ten children. Between 1875 and 1880, a  lean-to was added to the rear of the cabin, and the Palmers continued to live in it until 1895, when it was sold to nephews Eugene Mumford and William Foreman. A few years later, the farm was sold to Lawrence and Ida Mumford Epard, who lived in the cabin for nearly 40 years. The cabin was donated to the park in 1950 and has been moved and restored several times in intervening years.\nFreeman School\nThe Freeman School, built of foot-thick red brick with carved limestone lintels, was the longest continuously used one-room school in Nebraska (1872–1967). The school also served as a Lutheran church, a polling place for Blakely Township, and a community center for debates, clubs, and box socials. The National Park Service restored the school to appear as it did during the 1870s.\nThe Freeman School was the focus of an early, influential judicial decision regarding separation of church and state.  In 1899, Daniel Freeman sued the school board after a teacher, Edith Beecher, refused to stop praying, reading the Bible, and singing gospel songs in her classroom.  In Freeman v. Scheve, et al. (1902), the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that Beecher's activities violated provisions of the Nebraska constitution.\nFarm equipment displays\nOld farm equipment can be viewed at the education center and near the Palmer-Epard Cabin, including planters, reapers, mowers and hay stackers, to name a few. Some of the old equipment is accompanied by videos of how it was used. Other displays show the progression of mechanization; e.g. from hand-broadcasting wheat, to a hurdy-gurdy, to an early seed drill.\nAdministrative history\nDaniel Freeman (1826–1908), a native of Ohio, filed the first homestead claim in the Brownville, Nebraska land office on January 1, 1863.  By the mid-1880s, Freeman also claimed to have been the first homesteader in the nation.  Freeman eventually amassed more than  and became a prominent citizen of Gage County.  As early as 1884, he first proposed the idea of memorializing himself as the earliest homesteader, and shortly after his death in 1908, Beatrice residents talked of preserving his homestead as a national park.\nProposals to create such a park were rejected until during the mid-1920s, the influential Senator George W. Norris suggested a historical museum of agricultural implements be established on the Freeman property and the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated a marker there.\nIn 1934, Beatrice citizens organized the National Homestead Park Association, reinvigorating the movement.  In 1935, Norris and newly elected congressman Henry C. Luckey of Lincoln introduced legislation to create the Homestead National Monument of America, which eventually became law in March 1936.  But federal funding for the purchase was not obtained until March 1938.  Negotiations with the Freeman heirs \"dragged on for months over the value of the land,\" and condemnation proceedings were instigated to bring them to terms. The government took possession at the end of the year.\nA few improvements were made to the site before American entrance into World War II effectively ended both visitation and development.  In the 1950s, the National Park Service acquired the Palmer-Epard cabin and built a visitor center as part of its Mission 66 program. A small museum there exhibited some of the artifacts donated to the park by the Gage County Historical Society in 1948.  By 1981 the national monument had five permanent employees, one part-time employee, and some seasonal personnel.\nIn the 1970s and '80s, seasonal rangers presented living history demonstrations, although many of their activities were later viewed as \"not historically accurate for the homestead era\" and \"more reminiscent of the Appalachian hill country than prairie homesteads.\"  Beginning in 1992, under the direction of Superintendent Constantine Dillon, the direction of the park was redirected from focusing on the prairie restoration to a broader commemoration of the Homestead Act and its consequences nationwide. Dillon initiated a new management plan for the park and planning for a new heritage center.   Under Superintendent Mark Engler, a Beatrice native, the national monument dedicated the Homestead Heritage Center in 2007 with more interactive displays that treated the Homestead Act from a broader prospective, a change symbolized in part by a \"Living Wall\" at its entrance with a physical representation of the percentage of land successfully homesteaded in each state. The monument was renamed to Homestead National Historical Park in 2021.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/the-freeman-school-building-prairie-communities-teaching-with-historic-places.htm The Freeman School: Building Prairie Communities, a National Park Service Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070621203341/http://net.unl.edu/swi/media2/extras/homestead_042806_MSTR.mov Groundbreaking Ceremony] - NET Television\n*\n*"
