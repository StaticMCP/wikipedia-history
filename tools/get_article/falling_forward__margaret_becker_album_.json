The collection of 11 songs was released in April 1998. It marked a significant change from synth-driven pop to a more acoustic, soulful approach. Allmusic.com Reviewer Melinda Hill states, \"Falling Forward is catchy and hypnotic. Becker leaves pure pop behind, bringing in electric guitars and a more alternative sensibility. The songs have taken on a new depth, unafraid to hit on the difficult things, ... Falling Forward ranks among the best that CCM has to offer, and is a wonderful new beginning for Becker\"\nCCM Magazine in its review of the album, writes, \"Falling Forward paints a picture of life with all of its colors: some happy, some sad, some gut-wrenchingly painful, some tears-inducingly joyful.\"\nTrack listing\n# \"I Don't Know How\" (Margaret Becker, Robbie Nevil) - 5:20\n# \"Cave It In\" (Becker, Byron Hagan, Michael Scott Quinlan) - 4:20\n# \"Clay and Water\" (Becker, Tanya Leah Roman) - 5:03\n# \"Horses\" (Becker, David Lichens, Brent Milligan, Tedd T) - 4:05\n# \"Deliver Me\" (Becker, Nevil) - 5:09\n# \"Any Kind of Light\" (Becker, Nevil) - 4:24\n# \"Irish Sea\" (Becker, Tedd T) - 4:08\n# \"Coins and Promises\" (Becker, Charles Garrett, Quinlan) - 5:11\n# \"Crawl\" (Becker, Tedd T) - 3:05\n# \"Take Me In\" (Becker) - 4:05\n# \"I Testify\" (Becker, Nevil) - 3:40\nPersonnel\n* Margaret Becker – lead vocals, backing vocals (1, 2, 3, 5-11), electric guitar (2, 6-11), acoustic guitar (3, 5, 7, 8, 9), 12-string acoustic guitar (4), guitar solo (9)\n* Byron Hagan – keyboards (1, 8), acoustic piano (2), string arrangements (8)\n* Giles Reaves – keyboards (1)\n* Robbie Nevil – programming (1), acoustic guitar (1), backing vocals (1)\n* Tedd T – programming (1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9)\n* Michael Scott Quinlan – programming (2, 3, 8), backing vocals (2, 7, 9), electric guitar (8)\n* Monroe Jones – keyboards (3, 5)\n* Jeff Roach – acoustic piano (3), keyboards (5, 6, 10, 11)\n* Jay Joyce – electric guitar (1)\n* Lynn Nichols – electric guitar (1, 2, 7), classical guitar (2, 6)\n* Dave Perkins – electric guitar (2), \"ambiance\" guitar (9)\n* Gary Burnette – electric guitar (3, 5)\n* George Cocchini – electric guitar (3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11)\n* David Lichens – electric guitar (4)\n* Wade Jaynes – baritone guitar (4), electric guitar (8), bass (8)\n* Charles Garrett – electric guitar (7, 8)\n* Michael Hodge – acoustic guitar (8)\n* Chris Feinstein – bass (1)\n* Brent Milligan – bass (2, 7, 9), electric guitar (4)\n* Mark Hill – bass (3, 5, 6, 10, 11)\n* Craig Young – bass (4)\n* Jeff Quimby – drums (1, 4)\n* Dan Needham – drums (2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11), percussion (3, 6, 11), programming (3), djembe (10)\n* Derek Wyatt – drums (7, 9)\n* Shane Holloman – percussion (2)\n* John Catchings – cello (1)\n* Carl Marsh – string arrangements (1)\n* Chris Rodriguez – backing vocals (11)\nProduction\n* Lynn Nichols – executive producer\n* Robbie Nevil – producer (1), recording (1)\n* Tedd T – producer (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9)\n* Monroe Jones – producer (3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11), additional recording (3, 5, 6, 10, 11)\n* Julian Kindred – recording (1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9), additional recording (3, 5, 6, 10, 11), mixing at Antenna Studios\n* Rick Will – recording (1)\n* Marcelo Pennell – recording (2, 4, 7, 9)\n* Jim Dineen – recording (3, 5, 6, 10, 11)\n* Michael Scott Quinlan – additional recording (3, 5, 6, 10, 11), recording assistant (3, 5, 6, 10, 11)\n* Chris Granger – recording assistant (3, 5, 6, 10, 11)\n* October Studios, Nashville, Tennessee – recording studio\n* The White House, Nashville, Tennessee – recording studio\n* Antenna Studios, Franklin, Tennessee – recording studio\n* Angie Cooley – mix assistant\n* Terry Watson – mix assistant\n* Hank Williams – mastering at MasterMix, Nashville, Tennessee\n* Christiév Carothers – creative direction\n* Jan Cook – art direction\n* Gina Binkley – design\n* Matthew Barnes – photography\n* Mary Beth Felts – grooming\n* Jamie Kearney – stylist\nSee also\n*\nReferences"
