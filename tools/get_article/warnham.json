Veitch. Extended with a wild garden in the early 20th century, the gardens are surrounded by a 19th-century park.\nField Place\nThe early 19th-century poet and Romanticist Percy Bysshe Shelley, husband of Mary Shelley was born at Grade I listed Field Place, a broad-fronted country house set on an estate/working farm, and was baptised there in 1792.

The village lies close to the Surrey border just south of site of the medieval Shiremark Mill, also known as Capel Mill and Kingsfold Mill which is 20 metres north of the border in Capel. The village has one pub, The Owl.\nA tune entitled 'Kingsfold' was adapted from a folk song by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the hymn 'I heard the voice of Jesus say' by Horatius Bonar.\nGoosegreen or Goose Green\nGoosegreen consists of a small group of farms and cottages between Warnham and Broadbridge Heath and includes four Grade II listed buildings.
