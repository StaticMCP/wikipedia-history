Against all odds, even Zhentil Keep promises to send troops. Although suspecting (rightly) rear political thoughts, Azoun accept this help and is an alliance of Cormyrians, the Dalesfolk, the Sembians, dwarf of the Foothills of the Earth and the Centaurs of forest Léthyr convinced by Princess Alusair who arrived in the region of Thesk, soon joined by Zhents forces, commanded by orcish General Vrakk.\nThis motley army led several battles against the horde, but both armies succeeded in taking a decisive advantage.
