The Crown Tower is one of the most recognisable symbols of the university, and of Aberdeen.\nHistory\nAccording to an inscription on the west front, construction was started on the 2nd April, 1500, however the preparations for its construction began in 1498, slowed due to the land being marshy. The architect might have been Alexander Gray or John Grey. It was consecrated in 1509, and dedicated to the Trinity and the Blessed Virgin Mary in her Nativity. Hector Boece wrote in 1522 that the steeple was of great height, and surrounded by stonework arched in form of an imperial crown, detailing the crown tower. It was built from golden Moray sandstone, which was shipped to Aberdeen at great expense.\nThe Catholic teaching staff were purged in 1569, and the six choir boys were also dismissed. In 1633, a storm blew down the original crown from the tower, which was subsequently replaced the following year. During the reformation, the stained glass windows were destroyed, but they were later replaced. The college library (which was housed in the nave of the chape) burnt down in 1772, however the university's books were saved.\nIn 1921, following World War I, the Senatus Academicus decided to reconstruct the Antechapel to include a war memorial for the 342 that had died during the war, from all four nations of the university, without rank or title. On Rememberance Sunday 1952, it was unveiled again in an extended form and rededicated by Rev Dr William Neil.\nIn the year 2000, to mark the chapel's 500 year anniversary, the university organised a traditional Latin Mass, only the second time since the Reformation that one had been held at the chapel.\nThe main organ currently in the chapel was built by Bernard Aubertin in 2004.\nMore sources:\nGallery\nFile:Aberdeen King's-College 1.jpg\nFile:+ 1495 wurde das King´s College in Aberdeen gegründet. 28.jpg|Interior of the chapel\nReferences"
