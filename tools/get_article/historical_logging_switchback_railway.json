Picture from May 2006\nThe Historical Logging Switchback Railway in Vychylovka (near Nová Bystrica, Slovakia) is a preserved section of the former narrow-gauge zig zag logging railway located in Kysuce and Orava region. The railway was closed in 1971 and disassembled, except an  section from Chmúra to Tanečník. Currently a  section is used as a heritage railway for tourists.\nVehicles\n*Steam locomotive MÁV 2282/1909 (U34.901) – in service\n*Steam locomotive MÁV 4281/1916 (U45.9) – in service until 1999\n*Steam locomotive Kraus Maffei 15791/1940 – out of service\n*Steam locomotive ČKD 2612/1948 – out of service\n*Steam locomotive ČKD 1441/1928 – in service (this is the last locomotive that went along the disassembled track in 1972; Until 1990 placed as memorial in depot Žilina).
