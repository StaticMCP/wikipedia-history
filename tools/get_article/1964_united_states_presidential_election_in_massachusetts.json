Voters chose 14 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nMassachusetts voted overwhelmingly for the Democratic nominee, incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, over the Republican nominee, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Johnson ran with Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, while Goldwater's running mate was Congressman William E. Miller of New York.\nJohnson carried Massachusetts in a landslide, taking 76.19% of the vote to Goldwater's 23.44%, a Democratic victory margin of 52.75%. This made it the third-most Democratic state in the nation, after Rhode Island and Hawaii, and remains the strongest-ever Democratic showing in Massachusetts. Even in the midst of the nationwide Democratic landslide of that year, Massachusetts still weighed in as 30% more Democratic than the national average.\nMassachusetts had been a Democratic-leaning state since 1928, but had voted Republican as recently as 1956, when Dwight Eisenhower won the state by 19 points. In 1960, Massachusetts native John F. Kennedy had carried the state with 60.22% of the vote, which up to that point was the strongest-ever Democratic showing in Massachusetts, but this record was quickly overtaken by Johnson in 1964.\nThe staunch conservative Barry Goldwater was widely seen in the liberal Northeastern United States as a right-wing extremist; he had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Johnson campaign portrayed him as a warmonger who as president would provoke a nuclear war. Thus, Goldwater performed especially weakly in liberal Northeastern states such as Massachusetts. Not only did Johnson win every Northeastern state—the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate had done so—but he won all of them with over 60% of the vote.\nWhile Kennedy had won 60% in Massachusetts in 1960 mostly by garnering the ethnic Catholic vote, in 1964 the traditional Democratic coalition was joined by a mass defection of moderate Yankee Republicans who had voted for Eisenhower and Nixon but could not support Goldwater. Consequently, the incumbent Johnson was able to sweep the state—and indeed Goldwater wrote off this state and neighboring Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York, as well as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan, from the beginning of his presidential campaign, prior to Kennedy's assassination.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | 1964 United States presidential election in Massachusetts\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic\n| Lyndon B.

This feat would not be repeated until 1992 (since which time, Democrats have swept every county in Massachusetts in every modern election). Johnson was the first Democrat ever to win Barnstable County, Dukes County, Franklin County or Plymouth County, and the first to carry Nantucket County since Woodrow Wilson in 1916. In Suffolk County, home to the state's capital and largest city, Boston, Johnson took 86.2% of the vote. Not until 2020 would any Massachusetts county again hand a presidential candidate more than 80% of the popular vote (on that occasion, Suffolk County to Joe Biden).\nThe election of 1964 remains the only one in which a Democratic presidential nominee has broken 70% of the vote in Massachusetts. Johnson's 76.19% remains the highest vote share any presidential candidate of either party has ever received in the state, and his 52.74% margin of victory is the widest margin by which any presidential candidate of either party has ever carried the state.\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Massachusetts\nReferences"
