The QNMU is the state affiliate of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, and represents nurses and midwives of the public sector (i.e., Queensland Health) and private employers.\nHistory\nThe union was formed on 8 November 1921 under the name of the Australasian Trained Nurses' Association (Queensland Branch) Union of Employees. Its current incarnation began in 1982 when the union broke away from the Royal Australian Nursing Federation'', now known as the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF).\nBefore being known as the Queensland Nurses and Midwives' Union, the union  went under the name of the Queensland Nurses' Union. This was changed in 2017.\nBefore this the union was known as the Royal Australian Nursing Federation, Queensland Branch, Union of Employees. This royal title was assumed, like other branches of the federation, in 1956 to mark the Queen's visit to Australia.\nThe QNMU is affiliated with the Queensland Council of Unions, and in the late 1980s signed a \"harmonisation\" agreement with the then ANF which recognised members of the then QNU as members of the Queensland Branch of the ANF.\nIn September 2010 the union announced the end of its affiliation with the Australian Labor Party.\nNotable people\n* Ellen Barron, joint honorary secretary, 1922–1933.\n* Florence Chatfield, presided over the founding meeting in 1904; joint honorary secretary, 1922-1933\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.qnmu.org.au/ QNMU website]"
