The campaign supports the democratic initiatives of trade unions, NGOs, student organisations and other organisations that further the cause of democratization in Eswatini. The campaign calls upon the South African government and those of other SADC countries to acknowledge that they are in effect protecting the undemocratic and repressive Eswatini regime. The campaign seeks the removal of restrictions on political parties, the news media and political gatherings, and  calls for free, multi-party elections.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.sdcampaign.org/ Official website]\n* [http://www.afrika.dk/launch-swaziland-democracy-campaign Launch of the Eswatini Democracy Campaign]\n* [https://swazimedia.blogspot.com/search/label/Swaziland%20Democracy%20Campaign Eswatini Democracy Campaign at Eswatini Media Commentary]\n* [http://www.observer.org.sz/ The Swazi Observer]"
