Drury E. Fortnum, was an English art collector and historian, known as a benefactor of the University of Oxford.\nLife\nBorn on 2 March 1820, Fortnum was the surviving son of Charles Fortnum (1770–1860), by his wife Laetitia (née Stevens), widow of Robert Basden of the Royal Navy. Considered to have delicate health, he was privately educated.\nIn 1840 Fortnum went to South Australia, where he acquired a cattle ranch. He discovered the Montacute copper mine in the Mount Lofty Ranges, ten miles from Adelaide, but made no profit from it. Leaving Australia in 1845, he travelled in Europe, mainly engaged in collecting works of art. On settling in England he became known as an authority. In 1858 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London; and in 1889 a trustee of the British Museum.\nFortnum was an alderman of Middlesex County Council, and a deputy-lieutenant of the county. He was vice-president of the Society of Antiquaries of London and of the Royal Archæological Institute. He died without issue at his residence, the Hill House, Stanmore, Middlesex, on 6 March 1899, and was buried in the Fortnum family vault on the west side of Highgate Cemetery on 11 March.\n]]\nCollector\nFortnum formed a collection of Australian insects, birds, and reptiles, a number of which he presented to the British Museum, while others went the Hope collection at Oxford. He studied European art history, and appreciated the applied arts of the Italian Renaissance, before John Ruskin had made the area fashionable. His collections included majolica, Hispano-Moresque ware, Luca Della Robbia and bronzes.\nBenefactions\nFortnum has been regarded as the second founder of the Ashmolean Museum. The collections of Elias Ashmole and John Tradescant the younger were awkwardly stored in a building on Broad Street, Oxford. Fortnum was impressed by the efforts of Arthur John Evans to arrange and display the collections. He offered the University of Oxford Renaissance objects, and property for the endowment of the museum, on condition that new buildings were erected to accommodate the collections. After some initial opposition, his offer was accepted, with details settled in 1892. Rooms were added to the university galleries in Beaumont Street, and the Ashmolean collections moved there in 1897. His own collections were presented in 1888, and in the following year he received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from the university.\nFortnum left a substantial sum to the University of Oxford for the Ashmolean Museum, and a smaller amount to the British Museum.\nmosque lamp, dated 1549, donated to the British Museum by Charles Drury Edward Fortnum]]\nWorks\nFor the Council on Education Fortnum wrote the Descriptive Catalogue of the Maiolica, Hispano-Moresco, Persian, Damascus, and Rhodian Wares in the South Kensington Museum (1873), and the Descriptive Catalogue of Bronzes of European Origin (1876) in the South Kensington Museum, published in 1876.
