It was founded at University College Ibadan (which is now known as the University of Ibadan), in 1955. Kenneth O. Dike and Abdullahi Smith were the founders.\nThe following year the society founded a professional journal, the Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria, and later published a second journal, Tarikh, as well as quarterly bulletins. It also runs annual congresses.\nDike served as the inaugural president. By 1957, when the society's second annual congress was held at Ibadan, there were more than 350 members. The society is described as \"one of the most energetic and illustrious of many such societies across the continent\" for its activities during the 1950s and 1960s.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.jstor.org/journal/jhistsocnige Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria]  archive on JSTOR"
