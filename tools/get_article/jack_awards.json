They were sponsored by Tennessee whiskey company Jack Daniel's and broadcast on pay TV channel [[Channel V|Channel [V] Australia]]. The awards were conceived by Damien Wilson, former creative director of Peer Group Media, to create a national platform that rewarded all areas of Australian live music, from bands to venues, tour art to guitarists and drummers rather than recorded releases. The awards were based on popular vote.\nDescription\nThe nominees for each of the awards were selected by a panel of over 60 judges from the music industry including publishers, label A&R, promoters, radio DJs, music media and managers nationally. The awards were based on an online voting system. Voters voted over the internet or by SMS for their favourite musicians, bands, live venues, photographers, tour artwork and the Gentleman Jack award for services to Australian live music.\nEvents\n2004 awards\nThe first Jack Awards ceremony was held on 8 June 2004 at the City Recital Hall in Sydney.\nThe ceremony was hosted by Jabba (Channel V), and presenters included Tommy Lee (of Mötley Crüe), Glenn A.
