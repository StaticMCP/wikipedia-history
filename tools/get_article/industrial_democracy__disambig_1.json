The book introduced the term industrial democracy to the social sciences, which has since gained a different meaning in modern industrial relations.\nIndustrial Democracy was published in 1897, three years after the Webbs published History of Trade Unionism, an account of the roots and development of the British trade union movement.\nContents\nIndustrial Democracy is divided into three parts. The first part concerns the structure of trade unions and concludes that \"Trade Unions are democracies; that is to say their internal constitutions are all based on the principle 'government of the people by the people for the people.'\" Part II focuses on the function of trade unions and specifically the method of collective bargaining. The third part delves into the theory of trade unions.\nPart I, Trade union structure\nPart I explores how unions are representative institutions, and provide the basis of fair governance of the workplace.\nPart II, Trade union function\nPart II explores how unions developed systems of mutual insurance for minimum standards and collectively bargained for their members.\nPart III, Trade union theory\nChapter I explains orthodox theories of economists at the time, and their \"verdict\" against the need for labour regulation. Chapter II sets out a theory of the \"Higgling of the Market\" where labour has a persistently unequal position. Chapter III explores what trade unions typically do to improve wages and conditions, through a national minimum and collective bargaining.\nChapter IV explores trade unionism and democracy, and looks toward the future of regulation. The imbalance of behaviour between employers and employees was described by the Webbs as follows.\nSignificance\nIndustrial Democracy had a profound impact on the British labour movement, and socialism worldwide.  It was translated into multiple languages, including a translation into Russian by Vladimir Lenin.\nSee also\n*Trade unionism\n*UK labour law\nNotes\nReferences\n* W. H.
