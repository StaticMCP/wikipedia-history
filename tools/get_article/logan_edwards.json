This side continued its success as the Canterbury Cardinals in the 1994 Lion Red Cup. In 1993, he was selected for the New Zealand national rugby league team tour of Britain and France.\nEdwards spent the New Zealand off-season in England, playing for the Rochdale Hornets from 1988/89 to 1989/90, then Swinton from 1989/90 to 1990/91. He then played for the Oldham Bears during the 1991/92 season.\nAuckland Warriors\nIn 1995, he joined the new Auckland Warriors franchise in the Australian Rugby League. He played fourteen matches for the latest club but was not re-signed for 1996. He also forced his way back into the Kiwis in 1995, being an unused substitution in the test against France and playing against Australia. Injury, however, stopped him from making the 1995 Rugby League World Cup squad.\nHe was to join the Hunter Mariners in 1996 however, a court ruling during the Super League war prevented the launch of the club until 1997.\nPost playing career\nIn 2005 Edwards was named in the Canterbury Dream Team. In 2007 he was to coach the Canterbury under-18 side alongside Mike Doreen before the competition was cancelled by the New Zealand Rugby League. In 2009 he was the Canterbury Bulls under 18 assistant coach, under Doreen.\nNotes\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080922112822/http://www.orl-heritagetrust.org.uk/HTML%20docs/player_stats_e_f.htm Statistics] at www.orl-heritagetrust.org.uk"
