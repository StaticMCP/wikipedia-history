It was part of the larger Crimean-Circassian Wars, where the Crimean Khanate attempted to subjugate the independent Kabardian principalities. The battle resulted in a decisive Kabardian victory, forcing the Crimean forces to retreat across the Terek River.\nBackground\nDuring the early 18th century, the Crimean Khanate launched multiple campaigns against Grand Kabarda, attempting to weaken its independence. Previous Crimean incursions in 1708, 1711, and 1721 had ended in defeats. In 1731, Aslan-Giray, a Crimean commander, led an army of approximately 7,000 warriors from Crimea, the Kuban region, and Nogai tribes to retaliate against Kabarda. Their objective was to devastate Kabardian settlements, seize livestock, and assert military dominance in the region.\nBattle\nAfter initial skirmishes, the Crimean forces attempted to cross the Terek River at Zhyryshty. Kabardian forces, numbering around 12,000 men, waited for the enemy to begin their river crossing. Once the Crimean forces were vulnerable in mid-crossing, the Kabardians launched a sudden attack, overwhelming the enemy. The Crimean forces suffered heavy casualties, with many drowning in the river or being cut down by Kabardian cavalry.\nAftermath\nThe battle marked a major strategic defeat for the Crimean Khanate. It significantly reduced Crimean influence in the North Caucasus and prevented future large-scale invasions into Kabardian lands. Although minor raids continued, Kabarda maintained its de facto independence from Crimean control.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
