The railway (operating as The Plains Railway) runs on approximately  of rural railway line that was once part of the Mount Somers Branch. The village and railway are open regularly to the public. The railway utilises preserved and restored locomotives and rolling stock once used on New Zealand's national railway network, while the village shows visitors how life was lived in New Zealand's pioneering past.\nOverview\nThe Ashburton Railway & Preservation Society Inc. (AR&PS) was founded in 1971 with the goal of purchasing a section of the former Mt Somers Branch railway on which to run restored locomotives alongside preserving heritage farm machinery fast disappearing from the surrounding district. To meet the goal the AR&PS founded The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum and began to acquire exhibits – of both railway, agricultural and other locally historical items – and to erect buildings for storage and display purposes. The museum also acquired three of its most significant buildings, namely the cottage, church and railway station, by relocating existing buildings to the site of The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum.\nK 88 Trust Board\nin operation at The Plains Railway on 28 October 2013.]]\nThe K 88 Trust Board was formed on 23 May 1995 and ceased to exist on 3 November 2015. Their overarching goal was to restore and overhaul K's 88 and, perhaps, 94 to operating condition. It was a legal charitable trust along with The Friends of K 88 (a parallel support group).\nThe plan was to:\n* Lease K's 88 and 94 from the Ashburton Railway & Preservation Society\n* Construct a shed as a base and where 88 will be restored\n* Restore K 88 to working order\n* Raise funds needed\n* Promote the research and recordings in Mid-Canterbury.\nOn 10 April 1996, The locomotives were formally leased to the K 88 Trust from the Ashburton Railway & Preservation Society, the K 88 Trust Board had purchased the former Ashburton Countdown Supermarket in January 1996 for the restoration base for the locomotives and the trust as a whole.\nFundraising was well under-way before September 1996, and the first goal of restoring K 88 was achieved in 1997 with the construction of its new tender water tank well under-way.\nAfter being in storage for many years at The Plains Railway with a condemned boiler, K 88 was leased to the Trust Board for restoration to working order. This restoration included a new boiler and tender tank. The 1903 belpaire boiler condemned on 24 September 1987 due to thinness in the firebox. The original tender tank was badly rusted out. Restoration commenced in 1997 with the new tender water tank being built at Helmack Engineering in Ashburton. The tender tank was copied from its original water tank. The building of the newly welded belpaire boiler was planned from the 1903 boiler. Funds were made for $100,000. The new boiler was built by Lyttelton Engineering Limited and cost $151,000. In December 1998, K 95's tender frame and bogies were recovered from the Branxholme locomotive dump in the Ōreti River. K 88's original tender frame was badly bent and the bogies were ex-NZR wagon bogies. The building of the new boiler took a year and four months to complete. The boiler was fitted to the frame of K 88 on 1 July 2000, and the tender tank was fitted to the tender frame not long after that. A new funnel was made by a local engineer. It was first steamed on 14 November 2001 in the same year. K 88 was recommissioned on 30 March 2002 where it showed off her new kaleidoscope that she had worn when she arrived in February 1878. Today K 88 is in active service at The Plains Railway and still is notable for hauling the first inter city express in New Zealand between Christchurch and Dunedin, being one of the original Kingston Flyer locomotives, the first ever locomotive in the world to be restored from a river bed and the oldest ex-NZR tender locomotive in New Zealand.\nRestoration of K 94\nK 94's never re-commenced (even though its restoration commenced in April 1986, but it was put off). Most parts that were in good order were used to replace parts in poor order on K 88. K 94 today sits behind the carriage shed at The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum and is can be used for comparison purposes when compared with K 88 as it was recovered on 19 January 1974.\n2015 arson attack\nOn the morning of 17 January 2015, the old workshop building burnt down after an arsonist set light to it. The fire destroyed most things contained within the shed (mainly tools, parts, nuts and bolts, boxes, potato equipment, etc.) with only very few of the contents able to be recovered. The fire was reported at around 5:00am that morning. Five fire engines and a water tanker attended the blaze to bring it under control. The fire was labelled suspicious and  The locomotive shed alongside the workshop was damaged, but has been made safe with minor repairs to secure the building.\nLocomotives, Railcars and Rolling Stock\nThe Plains Railway came to world attention when a member of the Rogers K class, K 88, was recovered on 19 January 1974 from the Branxholme Locomotive Dump in the Ōreti River in Southland. Transported by truck to The Plains Railway in July 1974 and restored to a fully operational condition on 27 November 1982. This has set a pattern other railway enthusiasts recovering a number of locomotives of various classes from where they were dumped including two other K's. One of them being K 94 was recovered by a private owner and transported by truck to The Plains Railway. Restoration commenced in April 1986 but was later cancelled. It is presently in storage in an unrestored condition and is used as a comparison as it vividly illustrates the condition in which K 88 was recovered and the work required to bring the locomotive to running condition. K 88 received a second restoration beginning in 1997 by the K 88 Trust Board. It was completed on 30 March 2002. The second restoration saw her receive a brand new Belpaire Boiler and tender tank.\nThe museum's rail rolling stock contains several historically important items. These are A 64 which is currently the second oldest operating steam locomotive in New Zealand; JA 1260 which was the last steam locomotive to haul the last night train out of Invercargill and the last steam locomotive to haul trains out of Christchurch; K 88 Washington – which hauled the first inter city express in New Zealand between Christchurch and Dunedin, being one of the original Kingston Flyer locomotives, the first ever locomotive in the world to be restored from a river bed and the oldest ex-NZR tender locomotive in New Zealand; Vulcan Railcar RM 50 which holds the official New Zealand Railways speed record of 78&nbsp;mph and TR 38 which is the first petrol locomotive in New Zealand.\nIn addition:\n* B 10 from the Oamaru Steam and Rail Restoration Society for the NZ Rail 150 celebrations in October 2013. It also hosted a running day at the railway on 3 November in the same year.\n* Rail Heritage Trust of New Zealand's F 163 \"Ivanhoe\" visited the railway in February 1979 for display in a festival, the locomotive did not run on the Railway.\n* K 92 from The Waimea Plains Railway Trust came to the railway in early 2004 where it regularly operated on their open days, including on several occasions with K 88 until 2007, when it was transferred to Oamaru Steam and Rail\n* Another RHTNZ locomotive, W 192 visited the railway on a number of occasions from 1992 to 2001.\n* F 150, of the Ocean Beach Railway, was stored in a dismantled condition at The Plains Railway from 1986 until 2019 when it was transferred to Invercargill for restoration.\nNZR Steam locomotives\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Key:\n|bgcolor=#F5D26C|In service\n|bgcolor=#89E579|In service, Mainline Certified\n|bgcolor=#f4a460|Under overhaul/restoration/repair\n|bgcolor=#DED7B6|Stored\n|bgcolor=#B7A4EB|Static display\n|bgcolor=#cecece|Scrapped\n|}\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Withdrawn in November 1890 and was sold to Canterbury Frozen Meats (CFM), Fairton. Replaced by a Ruston & Hornsby shunter No. 458956 in 1961 and kept as a stand-by locomotive until 1965 where it was donated to the Ashburton Steam and Model Engineers Club and displayed at the Tinwald Domain. In 1971 it was leased to the AR&PS for restoration. The A was the main workhorse from 25 November 1973 until the completion of the first restoration of K 88 and again once the K was out of service pending a new boiler. In 1988 the locomotive received new firebars and in October of the same year it participated in the Ferrymead 125 cavalcade. In 1991 it was removed from service for a 10-Year Overhaul to take place, during which some tubes were replaced. In the summer of 1997 A 64 was taken out of service for a second restoration where it was repainted into a pleasant green livery with the wooden side tanks (fitted while at CFM) replaced by steel round-ended tanks, the locomotive returned to service on 7 May 2000. In 2012 after K 88's 10-year boiler survey was completed A 64 was taken out of service and put through its first 10-year boiler inspection/general overhaul since re-entering service in 2000. It returned to service in time for the New Zealand Rail 150 celebrations on 26 October 2013, and as such was the oldest operating steam locomotive in the country for the event. From 24 September 2014 until 28 January 2015 it was placed on loan to the Canterbury Railway Society for operation on their Ferrymead Heritage Park until the restoration of their locomotive, F 13 was completed. It is now currently the second-oldest operating locomotive in New Zealand, after F 13 of the Canterbury Railway Society (built in 1872).\n|- style=\"background:#F5D26C\"\n| JA 1260\n|\n| NZR Hillside Workshops\n| 383\n|\n|\n| Entered service in November 1952 for the NZR where it hauled passenger and freight trains until 1971 when it hauled the last steam-hauled express out of Dunedin and hauled the last steam-hauled express's out of Christchurch. In August of that year was withdrawn from service. Sold to the AR&PS on 10 May 1972 Ja 1260 was originally stored in Ashburton in the locomotive shed until such time as the AR&PS could take possession. In February 1973 where it was towed to The Plains Railway where it was returned to operational condition and used from December 1975. In September 1986 it was leased to the Weka Pass Railway until 1988 where it was returned to the Plains. In 1990 full restoration commenced. After a long hiatus restoration work began again in earnest in 2007, re-entering service on 25 April 2008. The Ja was removed from service in 2013 requiring new tubes and fire-bar replacement and returned to service in March 2018.\n|- style=\"background:#F5D26C\"\n| K 88\n| Washington\n| Rogers Locomotive Works\n| 2454\n|\n|\n| Entering service on 18 March 1878, K 88 is famous for having hauled the first 'Express Passenger' train between Christchurch and Dunedin on 6 September that year. In November 1926 K 88 was withdrawn and dumped in the Branxholme locomotive dump in the Ōreti River on 5 June 1927. The locomotive was removed from the mud at Branxholme on 19 and 20 January 1974 and trucked to The Plains Railway in July that year. This is where restoration began by members at The Plains Railway led by the late Mr. Bob Anderson. It moved under its own power, for the first time since November 1926, on 7 November 1981 before re-entering service 27 November 1982. The K was used extensively in the filming of \"Hanlon: In Defence of Minnie Dean\" a TV mini-series filmed in 1984. The K was used to promote Monteiths Beer between May and October 1986 running extensively on the mainline around Christchurch and Dunedin and was again used on film January 1987 when it was hired for filming of the New Zealand film \"Starlight Hotel\". K 88's boiler, which was the boiler the locomotive was recovered from the Ōreti River with, was condemned on 24 September 1987 removing the locomotive from service. The K was then stored until 1998 when the second restoration began with a construction of a new boiler and tender tank, the locomotive was re-commissioned on 30 March 2002. K 88's first 10-year boiler inspection of its new boiler took place on 19 May 2012, out of action for just a few months it was back in service on 14 September 2012. The locomotive went out of service for a ten-year boiler inspection and returned to working order for the railway's 50th anniversary.\n|- style=\"background:#DED7B6;\"\n| K 94\n|\n| Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works|Rogers Locomotive Works\n| 2470\n|\n|\n| Entered service in December 1878.
