Prior to June 2010, it was called the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports'''.\nThe council's work is informed by a Science Board, composed primarily of academic researchers and scholars. The first Science Board was appointed during the George W. Bush administration in 2003 with Charles B. \"Chuck\" Corbin, Ph.D., Arizona State University, serving as its inaugural chair. In 2016, Corbin received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the PCSFN.\nThe Science Board was active for several years, but eventually went dormant. It was reinstated on June 21, 2019, with strong urging from organizations such as the National Academy of Kinesiology.\nA newly formed Science Board was announced on January 22, 2020, with Bradley J. Cardinal, Ph.D., Oregon State University, appointed as chair. During their 2-year term, the Science Board established the scientific basis of the National Youth Sports Strategy, including a wide variety of evidence-based documents and reports.\nHistory\nDuring the 1940s, the American Medical Association and the National Committee on Physical Fitness had a joint committee encouraging physical fitness.\nOn July 16, 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower  established The President's Council on Youth Fitness to encourage national improvement in children’s physical health.\nIn 1963, President Kennedy changed the council's name to President's Council on Physical Fitness to reflect its role to serve all Americans.\nIn 1966, President Lyndon Johnson created the Presidential Physical Fitness Award, the name of which was later changed to President's Challenge Youth Physical Fitness Awards Program.

The President's Challenge site displayed a notice that it was down for \"Site Maintenance – We're taking a little breather.\"  On January 27, 2012, The President's Challenge sent out emails to its participants saying that the website was functional as of January 24, 2012, and asked participants to reset their user passwords.\nOn July 31, 2025, President Donald Trump reestablished the Presidential Fitness Test as part of the Council's mandate, and revised the Council membership to include up to 30 members.
