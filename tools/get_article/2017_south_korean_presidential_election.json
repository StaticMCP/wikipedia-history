The elections were conducted in a single round, on a first-past-the-post basis. Originally scheduled for 20 December 2017, the election was pushed forward following the impeachment and removal of Park Geun-hye on 10 March. This is due to a requirement by the constitution of South Korea for an election to be held within 60 days of a permanent presidential vacancy, which in this case was caused by the 10 March decision of the Constitutional Court of Korea to uphold the impeachment and remove Park from office. Later, it was confirmed by the government that the date of the election would be 9 May, making them the first snap presidential elections held directly. Following procedures set out in the Constitution of South Korea, Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn succeeded Park as the acting president. After Park was removed from office by the Constitutional Court's ruling, acting president Hwang announced he would not run for a term in his own right.\nOpinion polling before April consistently placed the Democratic Party's candidate, Moon Jae-in, runner-up in the 2012 election, as the front-runner. Second place in the opinion polls was initially held by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who declined to run in February, followed by Ahn Hee-jung, whilst he lost the Democratic primaries to Moon. Support for People Party founder Ahn Cheol-soo then surged, threatening Moon's lead in the polls throughout early April, before descending to approximately equal that of Liberty Korea Party's candidate, Hong Jun-pyo, in final polls.\nMoon won the election with 41 percent of the vote, defeating his nearest opponent, Hong, by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. Under the Constitution of South Korea, if a president dies, resigns, or is removed by impeachment, a new election must take place within 60 days. As a result, unlike previous presidential elections,  president-elect Moon took office immediately upon the confirmation of the result by the National Election Commission, with the inauguration at the National Assembly on the same day.\nBackground\nin 2017, Hwang Kyo-ahn. His term expired on May 10.]]\nPark Geun-hye of the conservative Saenuri Party (renamed just prior to the election in February 2017 as the Liberty Korea Party) won the previous presidential election in 2012, succeeding Lee Myung-bak of the same party.\nThe Saenuri Party lost the parliamentary election in April 2016, with opposition parties including liberal Democratic Party and People Party winning a majority in the National Assembly. Commentators described the result as leaving Park a lame duck president, as South Korean presidents are barred from reelection. and the Nikkei Asian Review noted that, in the wake of her \"crushing defeat\", \"rivals sense a prime opportunity to complete the power shift in the December 2017 presidential vote\". The Korea Times stated: \"The drama of deals and power struggles for next year's election has already begun.\"\nImpeachment of President Park Geun-hye\nOn 9 December 2016, President Park was impeached by the National Assembly by a vote of 234 for and 56 against (with seven invalid votes and two abstentions) after her implication in the 2016 South Korean political scandal. The Constitutional Court reviewed the motion of impeachment. Per the Constitution, Park's powers were suspended until the Constitutional Court could review the case, and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn became acting president.\nThe Constitutional Court had 180 days to decide whether to uphold the impeachment. On 10 March 2017, Park was formally removed from office, with a unanimous ruling by all eight of the Constitutional Court's justices supporting her impeachment. A presidential election would have to be held within 60 days. In the interim, Prime Minister Hwang served out the remainder of the 18th term until election day.\nThe presidential election had previously been scheduled for 20 December, with Park barred from running due to the constitutional ban on any sort of presidential reelection. However, with Park's removal from office, the elections were brought forward to 9 May in order to ensure that a new president would be able to take office within 60 days of Park's removal, as required by the Constitution.\nRegistered candidates\nThe six parties represented in the National Assembly are the social liberal Democratic Party, the conservative Liberty Korea Party, the centrist People Party, the center-right Bareun Party, the progressive Justice Party, and pro-Park Geun-hye conservative Saenuri Party.\nBallot numbers for party candidates were given according to the candidate's party seat distribution in the National Assembly. Ballot numbers for independent and minor party candidates were determined through a random lottery by the National Election Commission.\nA record number of 15 candidates registered, out of which two withdrew before election day.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float: margin:10px\"\n|-  style=\"background:#eee; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 1\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 2\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 3\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 4\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 5\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 6\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 7\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 8\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 9\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 10\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 11 (withdrew)\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 12\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 13 (withdrew)\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 14\n| style=\"padding:10px; width:125px;\" | 15\n|-\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | MoonJae-in\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | HongJun-pyo\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | AhnCheol-soo\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | YooSeung-min\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | SimSang-jung\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | ChoWon-jin\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | OhYoung-guk\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | ChangSŏng-min\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | LeeJae-oh\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" |Kim Seon-dong\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | NamJae-jun\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | LeeKyung-hee\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | KimJung-son\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | YoonHong-sik\n| style=\"width:90px; padding:2px 0 6px; font:17px georgia,arial; text-align:center;\" | KimMin-chan\n|-\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Democratic\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Liberty Korea\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  People's\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Bareun\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Justice\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Saenuri\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Economic Patriots\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Grand National United\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Evergreen Korea\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  People's United\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  United Korea\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Korean Nationalist\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Future Korea Peninsula\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Hongik\n| style=\" text-align:center;\" |  Independent\n|-\n|}\nNominations\nDemocratic Party\nCandidate\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|\nDemocratic Party candidate\n|-\n! style=\" font-size:135%; background:#004EA2; width:200px;\"|\n|-\n|\n|-\n| Leader of theDemocratic Party\n|}\nPrimary\nCandidates were determined by an open primary of citizens who registered as a voter between February 15 to March 9, and March 12 to March 21.

Polls prior to the conclusion of the Democratic primary (which included his rivals to the nomination) had Moon at around 30% support, and polls conducted after he had won the primary showed generally consistent results of around 40% by April.\nPolling showed a significant decline in support for Ahn Cheol-soo during April. While at the beginning of the month he was polling close to Moon, and even exceeded him in a few polls, by May his support had dropped to around 20%. This decline coincided with rising support for Hong Jun-pyo. By the time of the polling blackout period began on 3 May, Ahn and Hong were recording similar levels of support.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"
