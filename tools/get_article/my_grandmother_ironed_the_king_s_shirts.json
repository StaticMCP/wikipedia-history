It began as a screenwriting exercise for a class at Concordia University, where Kove had been enrolled. She then pitched the film to producers at the NFB, including its eventual NFB producer, Page. As is the case with her subsequent animated shorts, the musical score for ''My Grandmother Ironed the King's Shirts'' was composed by Kove's husband, Kevin Dean. The film is narrated by Mag Ruffman.\nReception and legacy\nAwards for the film included a special prize from the Hiroshima International Animation Festival and a Golden Sheaf Award for best Animation. The film was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 72nd Academy Awards. It was also included in the Animation Show of Shows.\nAdaptation\nIn May 2017, the NFB and Canadian publisher Firefly Books announced that the film would be adapted into a children's book.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.nfb.ca/film/my_grandmother_ironed_the_king_shirts/ ''My Grandmother Ironed the King's Shirts''] on the National Film Board of Canada"
