Also, since Germany and Czechoslovakia had never signed any treaty since the Second World War, the treaty has been a peace treaty between the two countries. The western part of Czechoslovakia that had borders with Germany is now the Czech Republic, which has also ratified the treaty. The USSR took part in the meeting between Czechoslovakia and Germany because Czechoslovakia was under the USSR's control.\nReferences"
