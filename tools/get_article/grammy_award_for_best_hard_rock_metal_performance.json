According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide it was designed for solo, duo/groups or collaborative (vocal or instrumental) hard rock or metal recordings and was limited to singles or tracks only.\nThe award was first presented in 2012, after a major restructuring of Grammy categories. It combined the previous categories Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance. The restructuring was a result of the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards. However, the Recording Academy announced in June 2013 that the category would split in 2014, returning the Best Metal Performance category and recognizing quality hard rock performances in the Best Rock Performance category. According to the Academy, \"it was determined that metal has a very distinctive sound, and hard rock more closely aligns with rock and can exist comfortably as one end of the rock spectrum.\"\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Year\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Performing artist(s)\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Work\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Nominees\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Ref.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|2012\n| Foo Fighters\n| \"White Limo\"\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|2013\n| Halestorm\n| \"Love Bites (So Do I)\"\n|\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\nSee also\n*Grammy Award for Best Rock Song\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.grammy.com Official Site of the Grammy Awards]"
