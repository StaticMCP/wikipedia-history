The soundtrack was released on December 20, 2004 through Victor Entertainment. In 2010, Toho Music released a 3-disc expansion of the soundtrack as part of their 50th Anniversary Godzilla Soundtrack Perfect Collection releases.\nBackground\nDuring one of Keith Emerson's concerts in Japan, director Ryuhei Kitamura approached him to compose the film's score because he was a fan of Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Progressive Rock. Emerson was concerned whether he would be given enough time before going on tour and was given two weeks to write the film's music; he wrote more tracks than what was used in the final cut. Nobuhiko Morino and Daisuke Yano contributed additional music to the score, however, Emerson did not collaborate with them. \"We're All to Blame\" by Sum 41 was featured in the film during the battle between Godzilla and Zilla.\nVictor Entertainment release\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack, film score\n| length     = 69:07\n| label      = Victor Entertainment\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack, film score\n| length     = 221:40 (total)\n| label      = Toho Music\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nIn 2010, Toho Music included a 3-disc expanded version on the sixth box set of the Godzilla Soundtrack Perfect Collection releases.
