He collaborated with The House of Arsalan Iqbal for the collection ‘Desirably Distressed’, which came out in March 2015. He said, “In 2012, I painted a shutter in Arsalan Iqbal’s store. Since Iqbal travels a lot, he finds graffiti very inspiring. Then in May 2014 we worked on a collaborative venture for the next 10 months”  Another collection of footwear and jewellery incorporating his designs \"Devolution Chic\" was showcased a month later at the 8th PFDC Sunsilk Fashion Week 2015.\nB-boying and parkour\nIn 2008, King began a b-boying crew in Karachi who organized as Unknown Crew (UC) in 2010.
