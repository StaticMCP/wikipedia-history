At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 61, based on 19 reviews.\nAndrew Leahey of AllMusic wrote that Empire of the Sun \"[festoon] their music with oddball flourishes, androgynous lyrics, and a general sense of theatricality that borders on schizophrenia\", concluding, \"Like the music it promotes, the cover art is purposely ludicrous, but listeners who have a palette for such whimsy should walk away happy.\" Martin Robinson of the NME described the duo as \"silly but their songs demand to be taken seriously, just like Prince, Ultravox and Bowie.\" Blenders Tyler Gray stated, \"Acoustic guitar strummed in time with dance beats, tinny vocals and tons of slap-back reverb—it's like some magical pop formula concocted long ago by aboriginal Australian  and parceled out ever since to INXS, Midnight Oil, Outback Steakhouse jingle makers and now this turquoise-loving duo.\" Andy Gill of The Independent opined that the songs \"Walking on a Dream\" and \"We Are the People\" \"rather resemble The Beloved or Air, sharing with those duos the impression that the music just seems to have settled, like snow, around the melody.\"\nMike Orme of Pitchfork wrote that \"at their indulgent best [the duo] strike a trenchant middle ground between fantasy and historical revisionism\", but expressed that \"although Empire tries mightily, they collapse underneath too many ideas before the record is even half over.\" Michael Cragg of musicOMH felt that the album \"offers little in the way of musical experimentation\" and that \"[m]ost of it sounds like a strange amalgam of Fleetwood Mac and MGMT, as if the latter had been transposed from the slightly grubby streets of Brooklyn to the beaches of Australia.\" Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted that the duo \"have lots of straightforward pop chops, but they prefer to get wonky with cheesetastic, Eighties-flavored keyboards and nonsense rhymes like 'Hotdog belt donut melt/Magpie knelt by itself'\", adding that the album \"sounds like Europop on Special K\". At The Guardian, Dorian Lynskey commented that \"the slick, pastel-wardrobed MOR of the title track and 'We Are the People' demonstrate melodic agility and sun-dazzled charm\", but viewed the album as \"a ripe cheese, best not consumed whole.\" Alex Denney of The Observer remarked that \"the record settles upon a cooler hue, favouring minor-key shuffles that, at their best, sound like prime Bangles cuts, but tend towards pedestrian 1980s pop hackery at their worst.\" Tyler Fisher of PopMatters concluded that, \"despite the well-developed '80s image, the music emulated is not anything worth reviving.\"\nAccolades\nThe album was listed at number 29 in the book 100 Best Australian Albums, published in October 2010.\nAwards\nARIA Awards\nThe ARIA Music Awards of 2009 nominations were announced on 8 October 2009.
