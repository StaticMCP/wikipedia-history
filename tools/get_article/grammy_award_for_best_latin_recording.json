Through his gathering of 100,000 signatures and protesting in front of the Uris Theater in Manhattan it finally became a reality. It was presented from 1976 to 1983 and primarily encompassed progressive salsa and Latin-oriented jazz recordings. Starting from 1984 the Latin field was expanded to Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album, Best Tropical Performance (encompassing salsa and merengue), and Best Mexican/Mexican American Performance. Its first winner was Eddie Palmieri for the album, Sun of Latin Music.\nYears reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.\n1980s\n{| class=wikitable\n|- align=center bgcolor=lavender\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Nominations\n|-\n|1983\n|''Machito and His Salsa Big Band '82 by Machito\n|Rhythm of Life by Ray BarrettoCanciones del Solar de los Aburridos by Willie Colón and Rubén BladesEscenas de Amor by José FelicianoMomentos by Julio Iglesias\n|-\n|1982\n|Guajita Pa' La Jeva by Clare Fischer\n|Gózame!
