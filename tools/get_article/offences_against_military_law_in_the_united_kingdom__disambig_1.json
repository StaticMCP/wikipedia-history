A second distinction is between those offences that can be dealt with by a Commanding Officer in a summary hearing, and those that can only be heard by the Court Martial.\nDiscipline offences\nDiscipline offences are those offences that can only be committed by members of the armed forces or, in a few cases, by a civilian subject to service discipline.\nThe table below lists the principal discipline offences, and indicates for each offence:\n* whether it can be committed by a civilian subject to military discipline as well as a service person\n* whether a commanding officer can deal with the offence at a summary hearing (though if the offender is a civilian subject to service discipline, it must be heard by the Service Civilian Court)\n* the maximum sentence available to a Court Martial trying the offence. The maximum punishment that a Commanding Officer hearing a charge summarily can impose is generally 28 days in service detention, or up to 90 days with the authority of a Major General or equivalent.\nNote: Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 only applies to the sentences of 2.5 years or less.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Offenders are automatically dismissed with disgrace.\n* dismissal with disgrace\n* dismissal\n* detention in a military facility for two years or less (not officers). Offenders sentenced to detention are also automatically reduced in rank to an ordinary soldier, sailor or airman, and forfeit their pay for the period they are in detention.\n* forfeiture of seniority (officers only)\n* demotion by one rank (warrant officers or non-commissioned officers only)\n* fine of up to 28 days' pay\n* service community order (only used in conjunction with dismissal, with or without disgrace)\n* reprimand or severe reprimand (officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers only). This will have an effect on future career prospects.\n* service supervision and punishment order (ordinary soldiers, sailors, airmen only). This order, which may be in place for up to 90 days, includes forfeiture of one-sixth of pay and loss of leave, and may also include additional duties, and being prevented from using some facilities (e.g. leisure facilities).\n* minor punishments:\n** loss of leave (non-commissioned officers and ordinary soldiers etc. only)\n** restriction of privileges (ordinary soldiers etc. only). This requires the offender to perform additional duties each day for up to 14 days.\n** admonition (ordinary soldiers etc. only). This is recorded on the offenders' service record.\n* service compensation order. Requires the payment of compensation for personal injury or damage to property. Amounts of likely compensation payable range from £50 for a graze or severe bruise, to £3,000 for a fractured limb.\n*Being placed on the Violent and Sex Offender Register for any period, including life.\nA civilian convicted by a military court may be sentenced to one of the following punishments:\n* imprisonment (in a civilian prison)\n* fine\n* service community order\n* overseas community order\n* conditional or absolute discharge\n* service compensation order\n*Being placed on the Violent and Sex Offender Register for any period, indefinitely.\nSee also\n* Military Courts of the United Kingdom\n* Civilian subject to service discipline\n* AGAI 67\nReferences"
