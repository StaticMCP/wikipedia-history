A Grade II listed structure, it stands in a small cobbled area at the north end of Market Place, having been moved from nearby Queen's Square in 1979. Made of granite, it consists of a pillar with an octagonal foot, and a ball finial surmounted by a wheel-head cross.  The pillar is on a square plinth on an octagonal step.  On the plinth is a timber plaque with a coat of arms, a bronze plaque with an inscription, and further plaques recording the names of those lost in the World Wars and another conflict.\nSee also\n* Listed buildings in Poulton-le-Fylde\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/3420 Memorial, Poulton le Fylde] – Imperial War Museums"
