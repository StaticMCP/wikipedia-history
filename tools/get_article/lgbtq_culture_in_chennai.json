They have historically existed in the margins and surfaced primarily in contexts such as transgender activism and HIV prevention initiatives for men having sex with men (MSM) and trans women (TG).\nList of organizations\nCommunity development may be traced back to Sunil Menon's mapping of sexual networks among MSM and TG in the early 1990s and the subsequent formation of Sathe Honduran, the oldest group of its kind in the city and state to provide spaces for community support and sexual health, primarily for working-class MSM who visit public cruising spots.\nThere are currently over 15 groups in Chennai that work on LGBTQIA+ issues. Most of them are community-run initiatives, and some are NGOs.\nMost of these groups are part of the informal Chennai Rainbow Coalition, formed in 2009, to jointly work towards visibility and advocacy. The group was expanded in 2014 to constitute the Tamil Nadu Rainbow Coalition, with membership from groups around the state.\nResearch\nChennai has two research institutes that partner with community groups to conduct social science and biomedical research on LGBTQIA+ issues. The Centre for Sexuality and Health Research and Policy has published extensively on issues such as stigma and discrimination faced within the healthcare system by MSM and trans women, legal recognition of transgender identity, and other issues. The National Institute for Research on Tuberculosis (NIRT), in partnership with the community group Sahodaran and Harvard University School of Public Health carries out studies of mental health and HIV prevention] among men who have sex with men.\nSignificant Events in Chennai's LGBTQIA+ history\n* 1986: Screening of My Beautiful Laundrette at British Council – same-sex love depicted on the big screen for the first time in Chennai\n* 1993: Publication of Robert Oostvogels and Sunil Menon's mimeograph 'Men Who Have Sex With Men-Assessment of situation in Madras', prepared for the Government of Tamil Nadu\n* 1993: Sekar Balasubramaniam, a volunteer of Community AIDS Network (CAN), comes out as gay and HIV-positive.\n* 1998: Sahodaran, first group for sexual minorities formed in Chennai\n* 1999: Mailing list gaychennai started on yahoogroups.com, the first listserv for the Chennai gay community\n* 1999: 'Queer Madras of the mid-80s' essay circulated on Indian LGBT lists\n* 2003: Movenpick group formed (later renamed Orinam) the and mailing list started\n* 2004: First Chennai LGBT film festival  – Alliance-Francaise and SAATHII, with volunteer support from Movenpick/Orinam\n* 2005: The Many Colours of Love: LGBT documentary festival -  Alliance Francaise and SAATHII, with volunteer support from Movenpick/Orinam\n* 2006: Conference on the third gender organised by Nalamdana\n* 2006: Orinam.net website launched\n* 2006: March for transgender rights when legislative assembly was in session in TN, organised by Sangama, THAA, SWAM, and other groups.
