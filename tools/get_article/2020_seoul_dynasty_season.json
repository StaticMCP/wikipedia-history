The Dynasty planned to hold two homestand weekends in the 2020 season at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all homestand events were cancelled.\nPreceding offseason\nOrganizational changes\nIn October 2019, head coach Kim \"KDG\" Dong-gun's contract expired, and he did not re-sign with the team. Later that month, Seoul promoted assistant coach Park \"changoon\" Chang-geun to head coach and brought up Mun \"MMA\" Seong-won from Gen.G Esports as an assistant coach. The team released assistant coach Lee \"WhyNot\" Ju-hyeop in early November. On November 8, Seoul signed former Washington Justice head coach Kim \"WizardHyeong\" Hyeong-seok as a strategic coach.\nRoster changes\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\"\n|+Free agents\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Role || colspan=\"2\" | Player || rowspan=\"2\" | Contractstatus || rowspan=\"2\" | Date signed || rowspan=\"2\" | 2020 team\n|-\n!

The OWL's deadline to exercise a team option is November 11, after which any players not retained will become a free agent. Free agency officially began on October 7.\nAcquisitions\nThe Dynasty's first acquisition of the offseason was on October 22, when they agreed to acquire tank Hong \"Gesture\" Jae-hee and DPS Park \"Profit\" Joon-yeong from the London Spitfire. A week later, support Kim \"Creative\" Young-wan was promoted from Seoul's academy team Gen.G Esports. On January 12, the Dynasty announced the signing of former London Spitfire support player Choi \"Bdosin\" Seung-tae.\nDepartures\nThe first player to depart from the Dynasty was main support Lee \"Jecse\" Seung-soo, as he was released from the team on November 1. Two weeks later, it was announced that Seoul transferred DPS Kim \"Fleta\" Byung-sun to the Shanghai Dragons. On November 23, it was announced that support Lee \"Highly\" Sung-hyeok had been signed to the London Spitfire. On November 27, veteran support player Ryu \"ryujehong\" Je-hong was signed to the Vancouver Titans, and three weeks later, Seoul parted ways with off-tank Kim \"zunba\" Joon-hyeok.\nHomestand events\nIn December 2019, the Dynasty announced that they would hold two homestand events; both were to be held the Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, the league cancelled the Dynasty's March homestand event that was initially set to be held from March 7 to 8. The game will be made up, with exact dates and times to be announced later.\nRoster\nStandings\nGame log\nRegular season\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Los Angeles Valiant | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Los Angeles Gladiators | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Hangzhou Spark | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = Shanghai Dragons | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\n}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = Guangzhou Charge | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = Hangzhou Spark | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Shanghai Dragons | team2score = 2 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = Chengdu Hunters | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\n}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = New York Excelsior | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 2 | team2 = Guangzhou Charge | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 1 | team2 = Shanghai Dragons | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Chengdu Hunters | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\n}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = Hangzhou Spark | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 2 | team2 = Chengdu Hunters | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = Shanghai Dragons | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 1 | team2 = Guangzhou Charge | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\n}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = London Spitfire | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = New York Excelsior | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = London Spitfire | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = Hangzhou Spark | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = London Spitfire | team2score = 2 | location = Online}}\n}}\nMidseason tournaments\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Hangzhou Spark | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Guangzhou Charge | team2score = 2 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Shanghai Dragons | team2score = 4 | location = Online}}\n}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = London Spitfire | team2score = 1 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 0 | team2 = Shanghai Dragons | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\n}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 2 | team2 = Hangzhou Spark | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\n}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | Bonus wins awarded: 3\nPostseason\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Hangzhou Spark | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\n}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Guangzhou Charge | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 2 | team2 = Shanghai Dragons | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = New York Excelsior | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\n}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 2 | team2 = San Francisco Shock | team2score = 3 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Philadelphia Fusion | team2score = 0 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 3 | team2 = Shanghai Dragons | team2score = 2 | location = Online}}\nUTC | team1 = Seoul Dynasty | team1score = 2 | team2 = San Francisco Shock | team2score = 4 | location = Online}}\n}}\nReferences"
