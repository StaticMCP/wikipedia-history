Johnson commented that \"A game master with Book 3 could create a similar region, but this is a time-saver.\"\nBob McWilliams reviewed The Spinward Marches for White Dwarf #20, giving it an overall rating of 9 out of 10, and stated that \"Perhaps the most interesting features are the political and historical snippets in the introduction and heading each set of subsector statistics; they help define the nature of the Imperium and its neighbours in the Marches region of space, and I wish there had been room for more of this background. This is an essential booklet for anyone using Traveller material 'straight'.\"\nSee also\nClassic Traveller Supplements\nReferences"
