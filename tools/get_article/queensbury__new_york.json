The population was 29,169 at the 2020 census.\nIt contains the county seat of Warren County, located at a municipal center complex on U.S. Route 9 south of the village of Lake George. It was moved to the complex in 1963 from the original county seat of Lake George. The town is located in the southeastern corner of the county and is part of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is named in honor of Queen Charlotte. Although primarily located north of the city of Glens Falls, Queensbury surrounds the city on three sides.\nSix Flags Great Escape and Hurricane Harbor, a Six Flags theme park, is located in northwest Queensbury. West Mountain, a downhill skiing area, is located in the southwestern part of town.\nHistory\nThe roots of Queensbury trace back to the Queensbury Patent in 1762, a colonial land grant authorized by the British Crown. It was designed to encourage settlement in the area near the southern Adirondack foothills, close to Lake George and the Hudson River. This patent,  named in honor of Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III, successfully attracted Quaker settlers the following year in 1763. Quaker families began to move into the area, clearing land and establishing farms and homesteads. In 1777, their peaceful existence was disrupted by the Revolutionary War. The Quakers, known for their pacifist beliefs, abandoned Queensbury during the war due to hostilities and the proximity to military campaigns. The region was largely uninhabited during this period. Following the end of the war, the Quakers returned to Queensbury in 1783 and resumed their settlement efforts.\nIn 1786, the settlement was re-established as the town of Queensbury. In 1788, the town included all of what is today Warren County. It lost territory in 1792 when the town of Fairfield (Lake Luzerne) was formed and again in 1810 to form part of the town of Caldwell (Lake George). In 1908, the then largest village within Queensbury, Glens Falls, incorporated as a city and became a separate municipality. The population of Queensbury has exceeded that of Glens Falls since the 1980 Census.\nIn 2003, with permission from Queensbury, Glens Falls annexed approximately  of the town. The land, known as Veterans Field or the Northway Industrial Park, is on Veterans Road between Luzerne Road and Sherman Avenue and is just east of I-87. The land was vacant at the time. A thin,  strip of Sherman Avenue was part of this annexation, in order to comply with state law regarding contiguity of annexed land. Both the city and town now share ownership of this stretch of highway as a result.\nThe Sanford House and Asa Stower House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which  is land and  (2.78%) is water. The town is located within the southeastern part of the Adirondack Mountains. The western town line is the border with the town of Lake Luzerne. The southern town boundary is defined by the border with the city of Glens Falls and the Hudson River, across which lies Saratoga County. The eastern town line is the border of Washington County, also New York State. The northern border is defined by the town of Lake George and, according to the town and Warren County, by the shoreline of the body of water, Lake George, itself. However, several maps, including those published by the USGS, depict the northern boundary as including part of the lake, including Speaker Heck Island and Happy Family Islands.\nParts of western and northern Queensbury are within the Adirondack Park.\nDemographics\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census}}\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 29,169 people, 12,907 households, and 8,308 families residing in the town.

The average household size was 2.22 and the average family size was 2.97.\nIn the town, the population was spread out, with 25.3% under the age of 18, 6.1% from 18 to 24, 28.3% from 25 to 44, 25.1% from 45 to 64, and 15.2% who were 65 years of age or older.

Town residents petitioned to establish a ward system in 1981 and again in 1985 whereby the town would be divided into four wards. In a ward system, whereas the supervisor is elected by the entire town electorate, each councilman is elected by only the electorate of the ward he or she will be representing. Having been approved by the voters by referendum in 1985, the first town board to be elected under the ward system convened in 1986. Queensbury is one of only ten  of New York's 932 towns that had a ward system as of 2000. The town has an ethics board, planning board, and zoning board of appeals.\nAs of 2025, the town government officials are:\n* John Strough – Town Supervisor\n* Anthony Metivier – Deputy Supervisor; Councilman, Ward 1\n* Scott Gushlaw – Councilman, Ward 2\n* Michael Dixon – Councilman, Ward 3\n* Timothy McNulty – Councilman, Ward 4\nIn county government, Queensbury is entitled to five of the 20 seats on the Warren County Board of Supervisors. (Glens Falls also has five seats, whereas the remaining ten towns in the county have one seat each.) Four of Queensbury's seats are filled by town-wide election, whereas the fifth is reserved for the town supervisor.\nEmergency services\nEmergency services can be accessed by dialing 911, which routes calls to Warren County's 911 Communications Center.\nLaw enforcement and other police services are provided by the Warren County Sheriff's Office and are supplemented by the New York State Police, which maintains a barracks in the town. Queensbury has not had its own police force since disbanding it in 1982.\nThe town is divided into five fire protection districts: Bay Ridge, North Queensbury, Queensbury Central, South Queensbury, and West Glens Falls. Each district contains at least one fire station, with Queensbury Central and West Glens Falls each having two stations.\nThree emergency medical services (EMS) districts provide out-of-hospital acute care and ambulance services: Bay Ridge EMS, North Queensbury EMS, and West Glens Falls EMS.\nA State Emergency Management Office regional office is located on Fox Farm Road.\nCulture\nQueensbury was the home of the Lake George Opera Festival from 1965 to 1998.
