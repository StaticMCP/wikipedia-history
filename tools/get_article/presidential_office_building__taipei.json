The building, located in the Zhongzheng District in the national capital — Taipei, was designed by architect Uheiji Nagano during the period of Japanese rule of Taiwan (1895–1945). The structure originally housed the Office of the Governor-General of Taiwan. The right wing of the building was damaged in Allied bombing during World War II, which was restored after the war by Chen Yi, the governor-general of Taiwan Province. It became the Presidential Office in 1950 after the government of the Republic of China lost control of mainland China and relocated the nation's capital to Taipei at the end of the Chinese Civil War. At present, this Baroque-style building is a symbol of the central government and a famous historical landmark in downtown Taipei.\nHistory\nAt the time Japanese rule of Taiwan and the Pescadores began in 1895, the governor-general of Taiwan set up temporary headquarters at the former Qing dynasty secretariat. The new rulers began making long-term plans for development of the island. The plans soon included building a new headquarters for the governor-general. A two-stage architectural design contest was held in 1906 and 1910.\nDuring the Japanese era, the building served as the office of the Governor General of Taiwan\nThe architectural design of Uheiji Nagano was selected in 1910. Aspects of the design typical of Japanese architects in Taiwan's colonial period include a façade facing east and a creative blend of traditional European elements (Renaissance, Baroque and neoclassical). Plans were submitted to Tokyo where revisions were made to Nagano's original design. Tokyo authorities increased the height of the initial six-story central tower to 11 stories and made defensive improvements to the defense and corner towers. Construction began on 1 June 1912 and was completed on 31 March 1919 at a cost of 2.8 million Japanese yen. It became one of the best-known buildings in Taiwan during the period of Japanese rule after construction finished.\nDuring the Second World War, the building suffered heavy bombing from the Allied Powers and was severely damaged. On 31 May 1945, during the Raid on Taihoku, bombs hit the front left side, main lobby, and northern sections of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. The fire burned for three days, damaging large parts of the building. Forty-five days after the air raid, Japan surrendered.\nThe building was not repaired until 1947, when the Taiwan Provincial Government initiated a restoration plan funded through private donations. The restoration involved approximately 81,000 workers and was completed at the end of 1948, looking only slightly different from the original building. Since the timing of the restoration's completion coincided with the 60th birthday of President Chiang Kai-shek, it was renamed Chieh Shou Hall. (\"Chieh Shou\" means \"Long live Chiang Kai-shek\".) Beginning in mid-1949, the building served as the southeast military affairs office and, following the retreat of the ROC central government from mainland China to Taiwan, it became the Office of the President in 1950. In 2006 the name Chieh Shou Hall was dropped. The structure is officially referred to in English simply as the Presidential Office Building. It was previously known as the Presidential Palace.\nChronology\n*1895 (June 5): Sukenori Kabayama, the first Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, lands on the island and sets up a temporary office at Keelung.\n*1895 (June 14): Kabayama moves his office to the former Qing Dynasty Taiwan Provincial Administration Compound as part of his decision to move the seat of government to Taipei.\n*1905: a fire destroys the Office of the Governor-General.\n*1906-1919: design competitions for the new Governor-General's Office are held from 1906-1907 and the final design of the building is completed by architect Matsunosuke Moriyama.

It is designed in the shape of two squares stretching from Baoqing Road to Guiyang Street.\nThe 130 meter-wide facade faces east down multi-lane Ketagalan Boulevard. This reflects the concerns of its Japanese architects, who often oriented important structures toward the rising sun at the head of long avenues. (This feature may also be seen in Main Library of National Taiwan University.)\nThe building has ten entrances but only the front entrance and west gate are used for official functions. In the original design an ornate Baroque-style domed entrance hall greeted visiting dignitaries. This entrance hall was reconstructed with simpler interior features after destruction of the first hall in World War II. The west gate, the formal rear entrance of the building, features a grand marble staircase and porch lined with Ionic and Corinthian pillars.\nThe two-part main building, six stories high, mainly houses government offices and maintenance services. The office wings feature balconies and long corridor that allow view of the sunlit North and South Gardens.\nThe 60-meter tower at the center of the building was the tallest structure in the Taipei Basin during Japanese rule. When the Nationalist regime took power, a platform was built at the top floor to enable martial flag-raising ceremonies.\nThe Presidential Office Building stands within walking distance of the Judicial Yuan Building, 228 Memorial Park, the National Taiwan Museum, the original hospital of the National Taiwan University, the original East Gate of the City of Taipei, the Chang Yung Fa Foundation Building (formerly Kuomintang Party Headquarters) and the National Theater and Concert Hall at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. A few blocks to the west is Taipei's popular Ximending shopping district with its historic cinema and Zhongshan Hall. A few blocks to the north is Taipei Main Station and Shin Kong Life Tower.\nAccess\nThe building is accessible within walking distance South West from NTU Hospital Station of the Taipei Metro.\nFormer President Chen Shui-bian revealed that the grounds of the Shilin Official Residence contain the entrance to a hidden tunnel that connects to the Presidential Office Building.\nIn 2019, Taiwan’s Presidential Office Building, in collaboration with the  (GACC), organized a program called 'Spend A Night at Taiwan’s Presidential Office Building,' allowing international guests to visit and stay overnight at the building. Ten groups of participants from 11 countries were selected. The event was held again in 2023, and 15 groups of participants were selected from 12 countries.\nGallery\nImage:Presidential Building (Taiwan).jpg|Front of the Presidential Office Building as seen from Ketagalan Boulevard\nImage:TaipeiROCPresidentialOfficeBuilding.jpg|The Presidential Office Building is in the Zhongzheng District of Taipei.\nFile:Taiwan Presidential Building staircase with Military Police Officer guarding.jpg|The main staircase in the Presidential Office Building being guarded by Republic of China Military Police\nImage:View of Presidential Office Building, Taiwan.jpg|The internal courtyard of the Presidential Office Building.\nImage:ROC Presidential Office (0753).JPG|Ching-kuo Hall in the Presidential Building is used to hold receptions, including presidential inaugurations.\nImage:Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender_Document_Taipei_PresidentialOffice.jpg|Original Japanese Instrument of Surrender from World War II on display.\nSee also\n* Presidential and Vice-Presidential Artifacts Museum\n* History of the Republic of China\n* President of the Republic of China\n* Governor-General of Taiwan\n* Japanese General Government Building, Seoul\n* Presidential Palace (Nanjing)\n* Official Residence of the President (Republic of China)\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*[http://www.president.gov.tw/en/ Shiue-chyn. \"Architecture of the Presidential Office Building.\" Official Site: \"A Tour of the Office of the President.\"] Official Site: President of the Republic of China.
