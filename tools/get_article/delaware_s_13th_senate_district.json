It has been represented by Democrat Marie Pinkney since 2020, following her defeat of Senate President Pro Tempore David McBride in the Democratic primary.\nGeography\nDistrict 13 covers much of unincorporated New Castle County to the south of Wilmington, including Red Lion, Monterey Farms, Fairwinds, Duross Heights, Clearvier Manor, and parts of Bear and Wilmington Manor.\nLike all districts in the state, the 13th Senate district is located entirely within Delaware's at-large congressional district. It overlaps with the 5th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th districts of the Delaware House of Representatives.\nRecent election results\nDelaware Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms. Under normal circumstances, the 13th district holds elections in presidential years, except immediately after redistricting, when all seats are up for election regardless of usual cycle.\n2020\n}}\n2016\n2012\nFederal and statewide results\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"60\" | Office\n! width=\"180\" | Results\n|-\n| 2020\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Biden 74.7 – 24.1%\n|-\n| 2016\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Clinton 70.6 – 25.2%\n|-\n| 2014\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Coons 73.6 – 24.8%\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2012\n| President\n| align=\"right\"  | Obama 77.3 – 21.5%\n|-\n| Senate\n| align=\"right\"  | Carper 81.1 – 16.1%\n|-\n| Governor\n| align=\"right\"  | Markell 82.6 – 15.7%\n|}\nReferences"
