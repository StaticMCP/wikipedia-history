Five All-Star Games has been held since the Vegas Golden Knights entered the league in 2017, with at least one player chosen to represent the franchise in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games, 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2025 when it was replaced by the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\"\n|+Vegas Golden Knights players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Game\n!scope=\"col\" | Year\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Position\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 63rd\n|rowspan=\"3\" |2018\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 64th\n|2019\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 65th\n|rowspan=\"2\" |2020\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| (Replaced Jakob Silfverberg)\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\"| 66th\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2022\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| 67th\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2023\n|\n|\n|rowspan=\"3\"|\n|-\n| (Replaced Matty Beniers)\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 68th\n|2024\n| (Did not play)\n|\n|\n|}\n4 Nations Face-Off selections\nIn 2025, the NHL held the 4 Nations Face-Off in place of the All-Star Game.
