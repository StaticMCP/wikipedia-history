Led by England as of June 2023, they attempt to compare the strength of internationally active women's national teams at any given time.\nAs a follow-on to the existing World Rugby Men's World Rankings, the teams of World Rugby's member nations are ranked based on their game results, with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The top step of the women's rankings have been notably less volatile than the equivalent men's rankings, with only two teams, New Zealand and England reaching that mark.\nList of rankings leader\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Team\n!Start date\n!End date\n!Weeks\n!Total  Weeks\n|-\n|\n|8 September 2003\n|3 December 2012\n|482\n|482\n|-\n|\n|3 December 2012\n|11 February 2013\n|10\n|10\n|-\n|\n|11 February 2013\n|19 June 2017\n|227\n|709\n|-\n|\n|19 June 2017\n|21 August 2017\n|9\n|19\n|-\n|\n|21 August 2017\n|16 November 2020\n|221\n|930\n|-\n|\n|16 November 2020\n|Present.}}\n|\n|+19}}\n|}\nSummary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Team\n!Total Weeks\n!Most Consecutive\nWeeks\n|-\n|\n|930\n|482\n|-\n|\n|+19}}\n|\n|}\nSee also\n*World Rugby Men's World Rankings\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.world.rugby/tournaments/rankings/wru Official World Rankings for Women's Teams]"
