Gibson, presented his credentials. On January 31, 1930, Alexander P. Moore was appointed the first U.S. Ambassador to Poland, but he died before taking office. John N. Willys succeeded him, presenting his credentials on May 24, 1930, and serving until May 30, 1932.\nWith the outbreak of World War II on September 1, 1939, following the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, the U.S. Ambassador to Poland, Anthony J.

Ambassador Arthur Bliss Lane, appointed on September 21, 1944, presented his credentials on August 4, 1945, and his tenure continued until February 24, 1947.\nConsulate\nThe consulate in Warsaw operated from 1875 on.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders sticky-header static-row-numbers\"\" style=\"line-height:1.3em; max-width:1200px\"\n|-\n|+ List of United States Consuls General in Warsaw\n|-\n!
