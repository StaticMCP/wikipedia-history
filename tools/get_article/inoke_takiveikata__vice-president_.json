His second term, during which he shared the office initially with Tavaiqia, and later with  Ratu Josefa Iloilo, ran from 12 January 1994 to 18 January 1999, when Iloilo assumed the office on his own.\nTakiveikata was a chief from Lasakau on the island of Bau.\nHe was not to be confused with another Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, who was also a politician, who in 2004 was convicted of offences connected with an army mutiny that followed the 2000 coup.\nReferences"
