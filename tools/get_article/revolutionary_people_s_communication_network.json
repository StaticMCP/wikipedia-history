It included subgroups such as the UK-based Black Liberation Front.\nIn an interview with Madeline Wheeler Murphy Kathleen Cleaver stated \"The ideological split in the Black Panther Party prevents us from having communication. We are reorganizing to develop a communication/information network through the Revolutionary Peoples Communication Network.\" She moved back to the United States to promote the organization.\nThe group published a newspaper called Babylon as well as other publications including Humanity, Freedom, Peace a collection of works by Geronimo Pratt.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Revolutionary People’s Communication Network\n\n#REDIRECT Revolutionary People's Communication Network\n}}"
