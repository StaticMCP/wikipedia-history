On January 21, 1963, they were made Historic Sites of South Korea.\nThere are around 70 tombs at the site. Various artifacts have been recovered from the tombs, including jewelry and precious metals. Some of the tombs have had artifacts typical of Silla, which indicates possible links between the Gaya elite and Silla, despite the hostile relationship between the two states.\nReferences"
