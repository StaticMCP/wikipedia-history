It aims to achieve little or no performance loss even as the code complexity increases.\nDashO can also statically analyze the code to find unused types, methods, and fields, and delete them, thereby making the application smaller. DashO can delete used methods, that are not needed in published applications, such as debugging and logging calls.\nSee also\n* Dotfuscator — a code obfuscator for .NET.\n* ProGuard (software) — a code obfuscator for Java.\nReferences"
