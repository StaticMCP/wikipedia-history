It is compiled from the recipes of the 8th and 9th century courts of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad.

There is also an entire chapter about , hearty stews of 'Nabataean' (Iraqi) origin.\nSeveral partial or full translations in European languages are available:\n* Nawal Nasrallah, annotated translation\n* , selection of two dozen recipes\n* Sabrina Favaro's Italian translation\n* David Waines, selection of recipes\nSee also\n* Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi, author of a 13th-century Arabic cookbook by the same name\nReferences\nFurther reading ==\n* Kaj Öhrnberg and Sahban Mroueh, eds., Kitab al-tabikh Studia orientalia 60, Finnish Oriental Society, 1987.\n* Charles Perry, \"Cooking with the Caliphs\", Saudi Aramco World'' 57:4 (July/August 2006) [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200604/cooking.with.the.caliphs.htm full text]"
