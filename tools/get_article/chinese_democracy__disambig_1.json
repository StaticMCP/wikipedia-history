It was their first album of original material since Use Your Illusion I and II (1991), it was also the first to feature none of the classic lineup members aside from vocalist Axl Rose. The album's development spanned over a decade, becoming one of the most protracted and expensive recording processes in rock history, with reported costs exceeding $13&nbsp;million.\nRecorded amid lineup upheavals, legal disputes, and leaks, Chinese Democracy saw Rose collaborate with a rotating cast of musicians and producers, including band members Dizzy Reed, Paul Tobias, Robin Finck, Josh Freese, Tommy Stinson, Chris Pitman, Buckethead, Richard Fortus, Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, Brain and Frank Ferrer, and producers Youth, Sean Beavan and Roy Thomas Baker. It is the first Guns N' Roses album not produced by Mike Clink; instead, Rose and Caram Costanzo handled production.\nThe album blends hard rock with industrial and electronic influences, a shift from the band's previous blues and punk-based music. Upon release, it debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, and was certified platinum, receiving generally favorable reviews for its ambition and vocal performances, though its production and lengthy recording process drew mixed reactions. Retrospective assessments have acknowledged its complex legacy, often overshadowed by the mythology surrounding its creation.\nBackground\nwas the main creative force behind the album.]]\nIn September 1991, Guns N' Roses released the albums Use Your Illusion I and II, selling a combined 35 million copies. That November, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin left the band, citing exhaustion with the current tour and conflicts with bandmates. He was replaced by Gilby Clarke. In 1993, they released \"The Spaghetti Incident?\", an album of glam and punk rock  cover songs. Though certified platinum in 1994, it sold far less than their previous releases, and the band didn't tour to support it.\nIn 1994, the band began writing new material, but McKagan said \"nothing got finished\" due to drug use. Slash accused Rose of running the band \"like a dictatorship\", while Rose claimed collaboration was impossible, leading to the material being scrapped.\nIn 1994, Rose replaced Clarke with his childhood friend Paul \"Huge\" Tobias, without consulting the band. He became \"obsessed\" with electronica and industrial rock, particularly Nine Inch Nails, and pushed for a more modern sound. Other members opposed Tobias and the stylistic shift, deepening tensions.\nIn early 1995, Ozzy Osbourne guitarist Zakk Wylde auditioned as second guitarist. That August, Rose legally left the band and formed a new partnership under its name (reportedly purchasing the full rights to the Guns N' Roses name in 1997.) Slash departed in 1996, citing creative differences with Rose and issues with Tobias. McKagan described the sessions as indulgent and chaotic: \"Axl brought [Tobias] in and said, 'This is our new guitar player' ... There was no democracy... Slash started going, 'Fuck this. What, this is his band now?'. I'd show up at 10, and Axl would arrive at four or five in the morning.\"\nIn January 1997, Slash was replaced by ex-Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck. The following month, electronic musician Moby briefly worked with the band, praising their use of loops but conflicting with Rose over recording vocals. He pulled out to focus on his solo work, later admitting he was not suited to produce a rock band. Other producers considered included Mike Clink, Scott Litt, Steve Lillywhite, and Mark Bell.\nIn April 1997, drummer Matt Sorum was fired after arguing with Rose over Tobias. That same month, Shaquille O'Neal briefly jammed with Reed, Tobias and studio drummer Sidd Riggs, Rose dismissed it as a casual encounter. Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna auditioned, joining a tentative lineup of Rose, McKagan, Tobias, Finck, Vrenna and keyboardist Dizzy Reed. Vrenna recalled \"When I was there, Moby was going to produce. Axl didn't come in very often\". Vrenna left and multiple drummers auditioned, including Riggs, Dave Abbruzzese (Pearl Jam), Michael Bland (Prince), Joey Castillo (Danzig), and Kellii Scott (Failure), before Josh Freese (The Vandals, Devo) was hired mid-1997. Freese joined after Rose invited him to help write songs, rare for a drummer in his experience.\nMcKagan left in August 1997, frustrated by the band's lack of progress and erratic studio habits. Tool collaborator Chris Pitman joined as a second keyboardist in early 1998. On Freese's recommendation,  bassist Tommy Stinson (The Replacements) was hired. By early 1998, the lineup included Rose, Stinson, Freese, Finck, Tobias, Reed and Pitman.\nRecording and production\nEarly sessions with producer Youth\nIn February 1998,  manager Doug Goldstein said the band was \"three to five months away from actually recording,\" but a release shouldn't be expected until 1999.\nThat year, Guns N' Roses began recording at Rumbo Recorders, where parts of Appetite for Destruction (1987) had been tracked. Geffen paid Rose $1 million to finish the album, with another $1 million promised if he delivered by March 1, 1999. A&R executive James Barber was brought in to assist: \"No expense was spared; they were the biggest band in the history of the label... We desperately wanted the new album for Christmas 1998 and I had a year to get it finished.\" Barber described the music as \"pretty incredible... like GNR, but with Led Zeppelin, Nine Inch Nails and Pink Floyd mixed in. If Axl had recorded vocals, it would have been an absolutely contemporary record in 1999.\"\nIn mid-1998, producer Youth (U2, the Verve) joined to help Rose focus. He later said Rose was withdrawn and not ready to record: \"He kind of pulled out... There weren't very many people I think he could trust.\" Frustrated, Youth left. Rose later said he had stopped writing in the mid-1990s because of criticism from bandmates and his ex-fiancée Stephanie Seymour.\nRose didn't attend sessions regularly. Engineer Dave Dominguez said, \"He'd be 'on' for a couple of weeks and then 'off' for a couple weeks. He called in pretty much every day, though.\" Rose rarely sang, occasionally played instruments, and often spent nights discussing non-musical topics. He instructed engineers to keep recording ideas in his absence and was sent multiple CDs and DATs weekly. Over time, he accumulated more than 1000 discs.\nGoldstein said the band had \"more than 300 hours\" of material: “They each take a CD home, listen for cool parts, pick them out, and that's how they build songs.\"}}\nWork with producer Sean Beavan\nThe band worked with producer Sean Beavan from late 1998 to early 2000. Stinson said \"most of the songs on the album started and ended with what [Beavan] did\". Beavan recorded Rose's vocals in under a week, most of which are the takes appearing on the final release. He claimed to have worked on 35 songs. Billy Howerdel, hired as a Pro Tools engineer, said \"I came in making sounds for Robin Finck, and that  turned into this two-and-a-half-year gig.\" At one point, Rose paused work to have the new lineup rerecord Appetite for Destruction (1987) using modern recording techniques. He said this helped members reach the needed quality and improved the writing process.}} In 1999, Queen guitarist Brian May recorded guitar for several tracks.}} By mid-1999, over 30 songs had been recorded, and the album was tentatively titled 2000 Intentions.\nIn 1999, Rose said they had enough material for at least two albums, including one more industrial and electronic than Chinese Democracy. Sources said the plan was to release Chinese Democracy, tour for a year or two, then release the second album without returning to the studio.\nAlbum title revealed and release of \"Oh My God\"\n, attending as a part of the Chinese Democracy tour]]\nIn a November 1999 interview, Rose announced the title Chinese Democracy, saying: \"There's a lot of Chinese democracy movements... It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just like the sound of it.\" He described the album as a \"melting pot\" of varied sounds, including heavy and aggressive tracks. Later that month, he previewed songs for Rolling Stone, who likened the sound to \"Physical Graffiti remixed by Beck and Trent Reznor\". In 1997–98, sources described the album as electronic influenced. Chris Vrenna said that Rose aimed for a sound like U2 and Brian Eno's Original Soundtracks 1. Though often labeled industrial rock, Rose clarified in 2001: \"It is not industrial ... There will be all kinds of styles, many influences as blues, mixed in the songs.\"\nThat same month, Guns N' Roses released \"Oh My God\", their first new track in five years and first original in eight, featured in End of Days. The lineup included Rose, Tobias, Stinson, Reed, Pitman, Finck, and Freese, plus guest guitarists Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction) and Gary Sunshine (Circus of Power). Navarro, briefly recruited in 1991 to replace Stradlin, recalled: \"Axl called… I showed up with my gear … there were 10 people in the studio, and I was like, ‘Where's Axl?’ And they were like, ‘He's coming. But let's get started anyway’... I recorded a couple of passes... and then I hear, ‘Yeah, that sounds really good. Why don't you keep that one?’ What it was was Axl on speakerphone from his home. Very strange – but I love that it was strange.\"\n\"Oh My God\" received mixed reviews; AllMusic called it \"a less than satisfying comeback\", while Rolling Stone saw it as a stopgap to appease fans and offset costs. Beavan said Jimmy Iovine chose the track for the film after hearing several demos. Rose, Iovine, and technicians stayed up all night finalizing the mix. Rose later called it an unfinished demo due to its rushed release.\nLineup changes and work with Roy Thomas Baker\nWhile finishing \"Oh My God\", Finck left to rejoin Nine Inch Nails. In January 2000, manager Doug Goldstein said Chinese Democracy was \"99% done\" and expected mid-year In a February Rolling Stone interview, Rose said delays were partly due to learning new recording tech: \"It's like from scratch... not wanting it just to be something you did on a computer.\" Around this time, the band moved to Village Recorders.\nIn March 2000, Rose hired Buckethead to replace Finck. His eccentric stage persona – a white mask and a KFC bucket on his head – led to rumors he was Slash in disguise. Josh Freese left after his contract ended to join A Perfect Circle, formed by Billy Howerdel, who had exited the project months earlier. Freese, frustrated by the lack of touring, likened the band to \"a giant jumbo jet sat on the tarmac\". On Buckethead's recommendation, Brain was hired as drummer.\nProducer Sean Beavan left in early 2000.\nThough the album was nearly complete, Rose brought in Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker, who convinced him to rerecord the entire album.}} Baker felt Freese's drums sounded too \"industrial\"; Brain said they sounded digital and lacked \"air movement\". Rose wanted the final album to reflect the energy of those involved, prompting the change. Geffen's Tom Zutaut called Freese's drumming \"spectacular\" and said: \"I would not have wanted to be in Brain's shoes. 'We have got a brilliant performance of this and now we need you to recreate it'.\"\nRose had Brain learn Freese's parts note-for-note, using transcriptions and a teleprompter before reinterpreting them. Brain said he recorded over eight months, and the final album blended both drummers' styles. Bassist Tommy Stinson rerecorded his parts with each drummer change: \"I probably ended up completely re-recording each part five or six times.\" He later criticized Baker for \"wast[ing] many years and many millions of dollars\" chasing sounds that could have been fixed in mixing.\nAfter Nine Inch Nails' Fragility Tour ended in July 2000, Finck rejoined. Rose had previously threatened to remove his parts after seeing him perform at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.\nComposers Marco Beltrami and Paul Buckmaster contributed orchestral arrangements. In 2003, Beltrami said: \"Axl played me these songs, asked me my ideas... I wrote some melodies and stuff. The music was eclectic, and there were no lyrics on the songs that I was working on.\"\nRose said the album was partly inspired by his conflicts with former bandmates and ex-fiancé Seymour. He hoped that her son Dylan, whom Rose was close to, would one day hear it: \"if he ever wants to know the story, to hear the truth\".\nA&R executive Tom Zutaut's role\nIn February 2001, Geffen head Jimmy Iovine asked former A&R executive Tom Zutaut, who had discovered Guns N' Roses, to help finish Chinese Democracy. After Zutaut and Rose resolved their personal issues, Rose shared his frustrations with recreating the drum sound of Nirvana's  Nevermind. Zutaut helped achieve the sound to Rose's satisfaction. Rose had Zutaut vetted by his psychic, then arranged for Geffen to pay him \"whatever it takes\", though the album missed its deadline.\nin 2016, with his signature white mask and KFC bucket]]\nZutaut said the band had 50-60 songs in development.\nBuckethead had quit over conflicts with Baker and slow progress, but Zutaut coaxed him back by building a chicken coop studio filled with straw, wire, and rubber chickens. Only assistant engineers could enter to adjust mics. Rose's assistant Beta Lebeis called it a cheap joke: \"Its just wire ... It's something you do in three or four hours. Just for fun.\"  Zutaut said Buckethead used the coop to watch hardcore pornography, upsetting Rose. After one of Rose's dogs defecated in, Buckethead refused cleanup, saying he liked the smell. Staff removed it after three days, angering him.}}\nAt Interscope's request, Zutaut reviewed the budget and found thousands wasted monthly on unused gear. His changes saved an estimated $75,000 per month. Rose's erratic schedule left paid staff idle. Zutaut said: \"These fucking people are getting paid shitloads.. sitting on their arse doing nothing because Axl's not coming to the studio.\"\nZutaut urged Rose to release the album as a solo project, believing it would sell better. Rose disagreed, saying in 2008: \"I didn't make a solo record... It would be completely different and probably much more instrumental.\" Lebeis said 48 songs were completed by March 2001, and Geffen began selecting tracks. Zutaut reviewed all 50-60 songs with Rose to decide which were worth finishing, and said they had completed versions of \"The Blues\", \"Madagascar\", \"Chinese Democracy\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\".\nDeparture of Zutaut and Baker\nFor  Black Hawk Down (2001), director Ridley Scott requested the use of Guns N' Roses' 1987 track \"Welcome to the Jungle\" from Appetite for Destruction. According to Tom Zutaut, Axl Rose had already rerecorded the full album with new band members, and one of these versions was mixed for the film. Rose later attended a screening arranged by Zutaut, but upon discovering it was not private, he fired him - Zutaut claimed he was \"set up\", a claim Rose denied. By then, Zutaut estimated 11 or 12 tracks were nearly finished, and the album could have been ready by September 2002. Producer Roy Thomas Baker left the project a few months later.\nLive performances and touring\nOn January 1, 2001, Guns N' Roses played their first concert in over seven years at the House of Blues in Las Vegas. They headlined Rock in Rio III on January 14 to an audience of 190,000 people. On August 29, 2002, they made a surprise appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards performing the new song \"Madagascar\". The 2002 Chinese Democracy Tour received mixed reviews, show cancellations in Vancouver and Philadelphia led to riots and the tour's cancellation.\n}}\nRhythm guitarist Paul Tobias left in 2002. Rose called him vital to the writing process but said touring was not his preference. He was replaced by Richard Fortus, who said most of the material was already written, with some riffs dating back to Slash. The band had considered Marc Ford of The Black Crowes, but he declined. Fortus called recording \"challenging\" since every guitar part had to be structured with three guitar players. In August 2002, Rose wrote that the album was nearly complete, with a finalized tracklist and artwork. Weeks later he told MTV: \"You'll see [the album], but I don't know if 'soon' is the word\". In November, Reed said the album would be out by June 2003, with only minor work left. Rose confirmed plans for multiple albums and blamed delays on lack of label support, saying he had taken on roles beyond his scope. He also cited pressure during the Illusion sessions as a reason for the prolonged process.\nIn 2003, Eddie Trunk described the song \"I.R.S.\" as Illusion-era hard rock with modern touches. Later that year, the Offspring joked their next album would be called Chinese Democracy (You Snooze, You Lose). Rose responded with a cease-and-desist order, which Dexter Holland said was blown out of proportion.\nIn mid-2003, the band reportedly began rerecording the album again. A journalist said Rose wanted it \"as perfect as possible\". In 2004, Stinson said it was \"almost done\", but delays stemmed from legal issues and Rose's desire for full band input: \"You have to get eight people to basically write a song together that everyone likes.\" An engineer said Rose aimed to make \"the best record ever,\" which lead to endless revisions. Stinson later said Geffen left Rose to self-produce, which he hadn't wanted. After the label merged with Interscope, Rose was told Jimmy Iovine would be more involved than he was.\nLabel disputes and funding issues\nBy 2004, Geffen removed Chinese Democracy from its release schedule and cut funding, citing overspending: \"It is Mr. Rose's obligation to fund and complete the album.\" Manager Merck Mercuriadis claimed the album was nearly finished. A 2005 New York Times article estimated production costs at $13 million ($}} today), dubbing it \"the most expensive recording 'never' made\".}} Mercuriadis dismissed the report, saying most sources hadn't been involved in years and hadn't heard the album. At one point, the band's monthly budget reached $250,000. Rose said the cost would be offset by material for multiple albums.}}\nBuckethead's departure and Greatest Hits\nOn March 17, 2004, Buckethead quit Guns N' Roses, prompting cancellation of their planned tour, including a headlining slot at . His management cited frustration with the band's inability to finish an album or tour. The band responded, calling Buckethead \"inconsistent and erratic,\" with a \"transient lifestyle\" that made communication difficult. Rose stated they hoped to announce a release date \"within the next few months\". In September, Stinson said it would reach mastering by November.\nLater that week, Geffen released Guns N' Roses' Greatest Hits, citing Rose's failure to deliver the new album.}}\nTour resumption and lineup changes\nBuckethead was replaced by Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal, and touring resumed in May 2006. Bumblefoot said the album was \"pretty far along\", with most material written and recorded, though more guitar work was needed. He added parts between tour legs, writing for every song, experimenting with fretless guitar and hundreds of ideas. He described the dense arrangements as challenging: \"You go high - there's a synth. You go low- it's buried in bass.\" He spent long days crafting original parts: \"[I] would experiment with different ideas and directions – fretless, fretted, wah, clean, heavy, bluesy, melody, rhythmic, technical. 100 tracks for a song, with two people yelling opposite directions in my ear at the same time. In the end, Caram [Costanzo] and Axl chose what worked.\"\nand drummer Frank Ferrer joined the band in 2006.]]\nDrummer Brain left in July 2006 to help take care of his newborn daughter. Frank Ferrer replaced him and added new drum tracks. Ferrer said Brain encouraged him to make the songs his own, focusing on feel over precision. He plays on five tracks, including the title song, while the rest feature drums by Brain and Ferrer using Freese's arrangements.\nIn October 2006, Rolling Stone reported a \"firm\" release date of November 21. Engineer Andy Wallace, known for his work with Nirvana and Slayer, was mixing the album. Stinson said that most of it had been recorded collaboratively in 2001, and had been \"pretty much done\" since then. Reed attributed the delays to a lack of deadlines or pressure.\nOn December 14, Rose announced four show cancellations to focus on finishing the album. He also ended the band's relationship with manager Mercuriadis and gave a tentative release date of March 6, 2007 - the first time the band had publicly given a date. At a Korn tour launch party, Rose called the album \"complex\", with Queen-like arrangements, and expected mixed reactions from fans. Sebastian Bach described it as \"epic,\" \"badass\" and \"grand,\" combining the rawness of Appetite for Destruction with the grandiosity of \"November Rain\".\nRose said in 2006 that 32 songs were in development, and Bach later confirmed Chinese Democracy was intended as the first in a trilogy. In 2008, Rose revealed working titles for 10 songs from the planned follow-up albums. (see § Unused tracks and follow-up album)\nFinal sessions\nvocalist Sebastian Bach recorded vocals on the song \"Sorry\".]]Axl Rose recorded his final vocal tracks in January 2007. On February 22, road manager Del James confirmed that recording was complete and mixing had begun, though no release date was set. Sebastian Bach said Rose had hoped for a Christmas 2007 release, but delays may have stemmed from business issues. Bach also recorded backing vocals for \"Sorry\" at Electric Lady Studios, describing it as \"almost like doom metal with Axl singing really clean over this grinding, slow beat\" Harpist Patti Hood and conductor Suzy Katayama contributed additional parts.\nIn January 2008, rumors suggested that the album had been delivered to Geffen but was delayed due to marketing disagreements. Eddie Trunk claimed financial issues were to blame, but Roses's manager Beta Lebeis denied this, stating negotiations were ongoing. Rose retained full control over track selection and sequencing. Tommy Stinson later said Jimmy Iovine \"pulled the record out of Axl's hand at the fucking 11:30th hour,\" just before Rose was ready to sign off.\nBumblefoot said he and producer Caram Costanzo (who joined in 2003) worked 14-hour days on the album. Other producers who worked on the album included Bob Ezrin, Eric Caudieux, Sean Beavan, and Tim Palmer. The final credits list Rose and Costanzo as producers, with Baker, Caudieux, Beavan, and Pitman providing additional production. Recording spanned 15 studios, including Capitol, Cherokee, Electric Lady, Sunset Sound, and The Village.\nMastering engineer Bob Ludwig submitted three versions of the album. Rose and Costanzo chose the one without dynamic range compression, rejecting the loudness war trend. Ludwig praised the decision: \"I was floored... The fan and press backlash against the recent heavily compressed recordings finally set the context for someone to take a stand\".\nRelease and promotion\nIn October 2006, Rose held listening parties in New York bars, previewing ten songs.\nOn September 14, 2008,  \"Shackler's Revenge\" debuted in Rock Band 2, marking the first official release of new Guns N' Roses material since 1999's \"Oh My God\".}} It was followed by \"If the World\", featured in the closing credits of Body of Lies.\nOn October 9, Billboard confirmed a November 23, 2008 release date for Chinese Democracy, sold exclusively through Best Buy in the U.S. The  title track premiered on October 22 via the Opie and Anthony show on KROQ-FM. Promotional ads referencing the 2008 United States presidential election aired in early November. \"Better\" was released as a promo single on November 17, followed by \"Street of Dreams\" in March 2009.\nDays before release, the album was streamed on Myspace, surpassing 3 million plays and setting a platform record. Managers Irving Azoff and Andy Gould called the launch \"a historic moment in rock 'n' roll\" backed by a \"monumental campaign\". The title track was also used as the theme song for WWE's Armageddon in December 2008. A music video for \"Better\", directed by Dale \"Rage\" Resteghini, was announced in December, however, it never released.\nA billboard for the album in London.\nIn March 2009, the band announced a new leg of the Chinese Democracy Tour, which ran from December 2009 to December 2012. Robin Finck departed to rejoin Nine Inch Nails before the tour, he was replaced by DJ Ashba. A guitar tab book was released in December 2009.\nThe album was banned in China due to perceived criticism of the Chinese government and references to Falun Gong. State media claimed it \"turns its spear point on China\".\nDisputes with label and management\nAfter the album's release, Rose remained out of public view for several months and ignored Geffen's requests to promote it. On December 12, he posted statements on fan forums addressing the album, former bandmates, and tour plans. In a February 9, 2009 interview, Rose said he saw  \"no real involvement or effort from Interscope\". In a 2018 retrospective, Billboard criticized the marketing, calling it \"a colossal blunder\" that undermined the \"most anticipated rock album in history\".\nIn May 2010, Front Line Management sued Rose over unpaid concert fees. Rose countersued for $5 million, alleging sabotoge of the album's release - including \"purposefully spoiling\" the artwork, \"botching\" a deal with Best Buy Deal and leaking tracks. In a 2024 interview, drummer Dave Abbruzzese claimed executives wanted the album to fail to pressure Rose into reuniting with Slash.}} The lawsuit was settled in 2011.\nLeaked tracks and legal fallout\nIn 2003, DJ Eddie Trunk played a leaked demo of \"I.R.S.\", from New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza.\nBetween 2006 and 2008, numerous tracks from Chinese Democracy leaked online. Early leaks include \"I.R.S.\", \"The Blues\", \"There Was a Time\", \"Better\" and \"Catcher in the Rye\". \"I.R.S.\" received enough radio play to chart at #49 on the Active Rock National Airplay Chart before management intervened. Later leaks came from unexpected sources: Harley-Davidson accidentally released \"Better\" in an ad, while professional wrestler Mister Saint Laurent leaked updated versions of several tracks in 2007. By the album's release, only three of its 14 songs had not been leaked or performed live.\nIn June 2008, blogger Kevin Cogill streamed nine tracks on Antiquiet, crashing the site due to traffic. He was arrested in August under the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act. Slash said: \"I hope he rots in jail. It's going to affect the sales of the record.\" Techdirt reported that the arrest spiked illegal downloads, and that UMG showed search engine traffic results to Best Buy to support a distribution deal.\nCogill pleaded guilty in November to one count of copyright infringement, later reduced to a misdemeanor. He claimed the government could not prove the album was commercially imminent: \"No one at the RIAA or the label had informed the government that these songs had been lying around for 14 years. Only that they had cost $12 million.\" He was sentenced to two months' house arrest and was ordered to produce an anti-piracy video, which was never made due to RIAA budget concerns.\nIn 2019, roughly 120 demos leaked online after Tom Zutaut's abandoned storage unit was auctioned off. The \"Locker Leaks\" contained 19 discs of mostly instrumental recordings from around 2001–2002.\nDr Pepper promotion\nOn March 26, 2008, media reported that Dr Pepper would offer a free can to every American — excluding Buckethead and Slash — if Chinese Democracy was released that year. Rose responded on the band's website, expressing surprise and saying he'd share his Dr Pepper with Buckethead.\nAfter the release was confirmed, Dr Pepper upheld its pledge, but its website crashed under demand for coupons. Two days later, Rose's lawyer Alan Gutman said threatened legal action, calling the promotion \"an unmitigated disaster\" that \"defrauded consumers\" and \"ruined\" the album's release. He demanded full-page apologies in major newspapers. Rose later said he considered the issue minor and was surprised by the legal response, believing focus should have remained on the album.\nCopyright infringement\nIn October 2009, Ulrich Schnauss's labels Independiente and Domino sued Guns N' Roses, alleging unauthorized sampling of Schnauss's tracks \"Wherever You Are\" (2001) and \"A Strangely Isolated Place\" (2003) in \"Riad N' the Bedouins\". Attorney  Brian Caplan said they first contacted Geffen in February, but the label \"attempted to explain [the samples] away\".\nGuns N' Roses denied wrongdoing. Manager Irving Azoff stated the ambient snippets were supplied by a producer who claimed they were legally obtained. He added the band resented the implication of misuse and was considering counterclaims, but expected a resolution. The labels sought $1 million in damages from Geffen.\nUnused tracks and follow-up album\nTommy Stinson said the album was originally intended as a multi-disc release, but after years of work, they had to wrap it up. He added that material from the previous lineup remained unreleased.\nAccording to Bumblefoot,  \"Atlas Shrugged\" was cut due to CD length limits. Other unreleased tracks include \"Oklahoma\", \"Thyme\", \"The General\", \"Elvis Presley and the Monster of Soul\", \"Leave Me Alone\", \"Ides of March\", \"Silkworms\", \"Down by the Ocean\", \"Zodiac\", \"Quick Song\" and \"We Were Lying\".\nIn August 2013, \"Going Down\", featuring Stinson on vocals, leaked online, along with remixes by Brain and future Guns N' Roses keyboardist Melissa Reese. In 2014, Rose said a second part of Chinese Democracy and a remix album were complete and awaiting release. Billboard reported in 2018 that a follow-up had been planned for 2016, but was shelved when Slash and Duff McKagan rejoined. Richard Fortus confirmed work on a new album that year, and in 2021, Slash said the band was reworking Chinese Democracy-era songs. That year, starting with \"Absurd\", the band began releasing reworked singles.\nMusical style and composition\nChinese Democracy marked Guns N' Roses' expansion into industrial rock, electronic rock nu metal, and  trip-hop while retaining their hard rock roots. Critics noted similarities to Queen, Paul McCartney and Wings, and Andrew Lloyd Webber.\nTracks 1-7\nRose cited Dave Grohl's drumming on \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"  as an influence on the title track, which was inspired by the film Kundun, and Rose's three months living in China. Lyrics referencing Falun Gong led to the album being banned in China. The track opens with a delayed intro of ambient noise and guitar lines, with Spin comparing the guitars to Tom Morello. Josh Freese wrote the main riff, calling it \"really dumb, simple, dirty.\"\n\"Shackler's Revenge\" was inspired by school shootings and media sensationalism, although \"Shackler's Revenge\" was written & recorded before the shooting.}} Rose likened the lyrics to a horror film. Critics compared it to Nine Inch Nails, The Prodigy, Marilyn Manson, Korn, and Rob Zombie. It blends industrial, electronic, nu metal, sludge, and alternative rock. Rolling Stone called its layered vocals \"a demented choir\".\n\"Better\" is an electronic rock track with falsetto vocals and a \"whining guitar line\". Rose praised the guitar parts in the bridge as among his favorite. Loudwire noted an Acid house-style beat, while Rolling Stone described the intro as a \"hip-hop voicemail\". Apple Music compared Rose's vocals to Bruce Dickinson.\n\"Street of Dreams\" is a piano ballad reminiscent of \"November Rain\" and \"The Garden\", with Elton John, and Queen influences.\nOn \"If The World\", Buckethead plays a flamenco guitar; described as having \"an electronic funk slither\", with neo-soul, nu-metal, and trip-hop elements. Pitman said the song was \"about environmental decay in its futurist context\", he wrote the song on a 12-string guitar, then layered dub beats, strings and synths. Rose said it parodies James Bond music.\n\"There Was a Time\" is an orchestral and synth-heavy track, with Mellotron, choirs, and violins. Spin noted, \"Bluesy piano and slyly cinematic passage set up the highest notes Axl's full-health throat has ever belted.\" Apple Music said it features \"prog rock mellotron and strings\", while Ultimate Classic Rock noted its blend of hip-hop beats, guitar solos and \"tortured vocals\"\". Kerrang cited influences from Danny Elfman, The Eagles, and Santana.\n\"Catcher in the Rye\" was written after Rose watched a documentary on Mark David Chapman, intended as a tribute to John Lennon and a critique of the book. A power ballad, it drew comparisons to Oasis, Elton John, Queen, and \"Yesterdays\".\nTracks 8-14\n's speeches are sampled on \"Madagascar\".]]\n\"Scraped\" returns to industrial rock with heavily processed vocals and lyrics like \"All things are possible, I am unstoppable.\" A vocal bridge was noted as similar to \"Get the Funk Out\" by Extreme. It also drew comparisons to Soundgarden. Loudwire called it a \"musical Frankenstein\".\n\"Riad N' The Bedouins\" refers to a former relative of Rose who claimed to be an arms dealer. Rose's vocals were compared to Robert Plant. The song samples \"Wherever You Are\" and \"A Strangely Isolated Place\" by Ulrich Schnauss (see § Copyright infringement). Several critics have theorized the song's lyrical content is about the Iraq War.\n\"Sorry\" is a power ballad aimed at critics and former bandmates, with the chorus \"I'm sorry for you / Not sorry for me\". The song drew comparisons to Pink Floyd and Metallica, and Rose's vocals were compared to Layne Staley. The A.V. Club noted Rose's \"bizarre, quasi-Transylvanian accent\" on the line \"But I don't want to do it\".\n\"I.R.S.\" features lyrics about calling government agencies over a guitar-heavy track. Critics noted trip-hop influences and similarities to Nirvana's \"In Bloom\".\n\"Madagascar\" is a trip-hop track with samples from films and Martin Luther King Jr.'s speeches. Time likened it to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\". Rose said the sampled quotes were edited together to emphasize their message.\n\"This I Love\" is a piano ballad written in 1992, described by Rose as \"the heaviest thing I've written\". He said the string melody was originally composed over a hip-hop loop. Spin compared the song to Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\"Prostitute\" is an orchestral power ballad that features the lyrics \"Ask yourself / Why I would choose / To prostitute myself / To live with fortune and shame\". Producer Youth said Rose \"labored\" over it due to pressure from past success. Loudwire noted its blend of \"classical orchestrations and electro-beats with blistering guitar solos and some of [Rose's] highest pitched shrieking.\" Consequence of Sound compared the vocals to \"Bruce Hornsby with distortion.\"\nArtwork\nThe cover features a sepia photo of a bicycle with a wicker basket against a graffitied wall with the band's name, shot in Kowloon Walled City by Terry Hardin. Above the vertically written band name and the album title are three red communist stars and the letters \"GNR\". Artistic director Ryan Corey said Rose conceived the bike cover early in the album's development.\nRose initially approached Chinese artist Chen Zhuo to use a painting of Tiananmen Square as an amusement park, but Chen declined due to censorship concerns. Instead, Rose selected Shi Lifeng's \"Controlling No. 3\" for an alternate \"art edition\" cover. This version was used for the Rock Band 2 download and released in limited CD quantities. The alternate booklet includes Rose's essay \"Fear N' Freedom: The Future of China and Western Society\". The regular booklet features artwork by Shi, photos of the Hong Kong skyline, the Chinese military, and band members.\nIn December 2008, Rose said that two alternate booklets were planned but never released, criticizing the use of an \"error-filled draft\" instead of the final artwork. Only the \"art edition\" was issued. Stinson later said executives pulled the artwork \"right at the last second, when [Rose] wasn't ready\".\nCritical reception\n| MC = 64/100\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score =\n| rev2 = The A.V.

Chuck Klosterman (The A.V. Club) praised the vocals and guitar work, calling three songs \"astonishing\" and noting the album as \"the last Old media album... the last album that will matter more as a physical object than as an Internet sound file.\" David Fricke (Rolling Stone) described it as \"audacious, unhinged and uncompromising,\" and the magazine ranked it 12th on its 2008 year-end list.\nJon Dolan (Blender) called the music \"brilliant\" and \"Ludicrous\", describing the songs as unpredictable suites blending \"miasmic industrial grind, stadium rattling metal solos, electronic drift and hip-hop churn.\" Robert Christgau (MSN Music) said Rose \"succeeds, kind of, on his own totally irrelevant terms\" calling the effort \"noble\". CTV News compared the production to Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, while People called it \"pure Guns N' Roses.\"\nMixed reviews noted overproduction and inconsistency. Greg Kot (Chicago Tribune) said it sounded like \"the work of a fading rock star with far too much money and time\". The Guardian found it incohesive but praised Rose's melodies. Pitchfork criticized the \"dated\" sound, and  Q said Rose \"did himself a grand disservice\" by overloading the mix. Kitty Empire (The Observer) accused Rose of imitating Nine Inch Nails. Jon Pareles (The New York Times) called it \"a transitional album\", saying \"Sometime during the years of work, theatricality and razzle-dazzle replaced heart.\" Stephen Davis labeled it \"the worst album ever\", comparing it to a 1995 Rob Zombie record.\nThe album was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year in 2009, losing to Coldplay's Viva La Vida. \"If the World\" was nominated for Best Original Song at the 13th Satellite Awards, losing to \"Another Way to Die\" by Jack White and Alicia Keys. The album was included on several publications' lists of the best and worst albums of the year. Asbury Park Press, IGN, and Chicago Tribune}}\nBuckethead's solo on \"There Was a Time\" received widespread acclaim. Consequence called it one of the decade's best, Total Guitar ranked it 32nd best of the 21st century, and readers of that magazine ranked it 6th.\nFormer band members' opinions\nSlash praised the title track, saying, \"It's good to hear Axl's voice again.\" He called the album \"a great statement by Axl,\" noting it was \"very different\" from classic Guns N' Roses and \"something the original band could never make\". He later described it as \"exactly what I thought it would sound like\", citing its use of synthesizers and digital effects. After rejoining the band in 2016, Slash complimented Buckethead's guitar work, saying the players on Chinese Democracy were \"fucking amazing.\"\nIzzy Stradlin said he enjoyed the tracks he heard. Duff McKagan praised Rose's vocals and said the album was \"the record he wanted to make\". Matt Sorum said he was \"pleasantly surprised\" by the title track, and called the album a \"toe-tapper\". Gilby Clarke said Rose \"hit the nail on the head\" with the direction he pursued.\nIn contrast, Steven Adler said he didn't recognize Rose's voice and disliked the album, arguing it should have been released as a solo project. Tracii Guns found it \"over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting\".\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Accolades for Chinese Democracy\n! scope=\"col\"| Publication\n! scope=\"col\"| Accolade\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Rank\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| ABC News\n|50 Best Albums of 2008\n| 2008\n|\n| }}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|The Guardian\n|50 Albums of the Year\n|2008\n|\n|}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| Rolling Stone\n|Top 50 Albums of 2008\n| 2008\n|\n| }}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Spin\n|The 40 Best albums of 2008\n| 2008\n|\n|}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Ultimate Classic Rock\n| Top 10 Albums of 2008\n|2008\n|\n|}}\n|}\nLegacy\n|rev3=Classic Rock\n|rev3score=\n|rev4=Decibel\n|rev4score=positive\n}}\nThe album's long-delayed release became its defining narrative. Spin noted that a \"cottage industry\" emerged around tracking its development, and suggested the only way it could have lived up to its legend was \"to never come out at all\". Steven Hyden (Grantland) called it \"shorthand for the grandest of boondoggles,\" arguing that the delay overshadowed the music itself. He contrasted it with more modest and successful comeback albums by Daft Punk, David Bowie, Justin Timberlake, and My Bloody Valentine.\nUltimate Classic Rock echoed this sentiment, stating the album was \"fairly good\" but eclipsed by its backstory. They cited artists like Bowie, Steve Perry, and Tool who avoided similar pitfalls by keeping a low profile and meeting fan expectations. The term Chinese Democracy  has since become shorthand for long-delayed albums.\nThe New York Times  described it as a \"loud last gasp\" of the indulgent pop star era, noting the shift to a \"leaner and leakier\" music industry. Jim DeRogatis likened it to The Godfather Part III, a long-awaited sequel that failed to match its predecessors.\nSome outlets offered retrospective praise. Complex included it on \"50 Albums That Were Unfairly Hated On\", praising Roses's vocals and the musicianship and stating that the album's biggest flaw were the delays in release. Artistdirect called it \"a timeless work of art\". Billboard labeled it a \"sonic anomaly\" of the time due to the mixing and lack of compression making it sound \"vintage or alien to rock music fans\". No Recess compared the album to \"their own version of Danzig's Blackacidevil\", stating \"The only thing left was to repeat or radically reinvent themselves. Chinese Democracy tries to do both, to varying degrees of 'okay, sure'.\"\nLoudwire ranked it second-to-last among GN'R albums but prasied tracks like \"Better\", \"Madagascar\", \"Street of Dreams\", \"Shackler's Revenge\" and \"Catcher in the Rye\" as standouts. NME placed it last, calling it \"epic, overblown and full of noodling guitar solos.\"\nLater reassessments were more generous. Ultimate Guitar and Ultimate Classic Rock highlighted \"There Was a Time\" as a standout. Gary Graff found its \"sprawling, indulgent insanity\" more enjoyable in hindsight. Loudwire and Rolling Stone both called it \"better than remembered,\" with Joseph Hudak naming \"Catcher in the Rye\" a highlight. Guitarist Bumblefoot said of the album's legacy \"people were still just going on about how it took this long to make, and it took this much money, and all that nonsense. And I always said, wait 20 years.\"\nStill, criticism persisted. Rolling Stones Andy Greene listed the album's creation as one of the \"50 Worst Decisions in Music History,\" citing wasted money and fan goodwill. He later ranked it 4th among the \"Most Disappointing Albums\". Former Guns N' Roses manager Alan Niven dismissed it as a \"boring\" Axl solo project.\nSales\nThe contents of the deluxe edition of Chinese Democracy\nBefore release, Best Buy purchased 1.3 million copies of Chinese Democracy from UMG for $14 million, agreeing not to return unsold stock. The album was released on November 22, 2008, in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, followed by a global release on November 23, except in the UK, where it arrived November 24.\nIn the U.S., the album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 with 261,000 first-week sales, below expectations. It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart. U.S. sales dropped 78% in week two, falling to #18. Analysts blamed the holiday release window, Rose's lack of promotion, and the Best Buy exclusivity.\nThe album was certified Gold on January 7, 2009, and Platinum on February 3, having shipped one million copies in the U.S. It ranked 55th on the 2009 Billboard 200 Year-End chart. In Europe, it earned an IFPI European Platinum Award for over one million sales, and reached 2.6 million units worldwide by February 2009.\nIt achieved triple Platinum in Canada and Platinum in countries including Germany, UK, Ireland, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Gold certifications were awarded in Austria, France, Japan, Brazil, and over 20 other countries.\nIn April 2011, Best Buy discounted the album to $2, prompting a Billboard re-entry at #198 with 3,200 copies sold. By then, U.S. sales totaled 614,000, according to Nielsen Soundscan. UK sales reached 365,899 by July 2014. Following the 2016 Not in This Lifetime... Tour, digital streams surged from 8 million to 24 million, with 7,900 additional copies sold.\nTrack listing\nSongwriting credits via ASCAP.\n| length1 = 4:43\n| title2 = Shackler's Revenge\n| music2 =\n| length2 = 3:37\n| title3 = Better\n| music3 =\n| length3 = 4:58\n| title4 = Street of Dreams\n| music4 =\n| length4 = 4:46\n| title5 = If the World\n| music5 =\n| length5 = 4:54\n| title6 = There Was a Time\n| music6 =\n| length6 = 6:41\n| title7 = Catcher in the Rye\n| music7 =\n| length7 = 5:53\n| title8 = Scraped\n| music8 =\n| length8 = 3:30\n| title9 = Riad N' the Bedouins\n| music9 =\n| length9 = 4:10\n| title10 = Sorry\n| music10 =\n| length10 = 6:14\n| title11 = I.R.S.\n| music11 =\n| length11 = 4:28\n| title12 = Madagascar\n| music12 =\n| length12 = 5:38\n| title13 = This I Love\n| music13 = Rose\n| length13 = 5:34\n| title14 = Prostitute\n| music14 =\n| length14 = 6:15\n}}\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n'''Guns N' Roses\n*Axl Rose – lead vocals (all tracks), keyboards (tracks 1, 6 and 13), synthesizers (tracks 6, 12 and 13), piano (tracks 7, 13 and 14), rhythm guitar (tracks 6 and 12), samples (track 12), arrangements and digital editing (all tracks), production, Logic Pro engineering, mixing, art direction (Alternative booklets)\n*Robin Finck – lead and rhythm guitar (all tracks), guitar solos (all tracks except 2), keyboards (tracks 3 and 5), acoustic guitar (track 10), arrangements, editing and initial production (track 3)\n*Bumblefoot – lead and rhythm guitar (all tracks), guitar solos (track 2)\n*Buckethead – lead and rhythm guitar (all tracks except 7 and 13), guitar solos (all tracks except 2), acoustic guitar (track 5), arrangements (tracks 2, 8 and 10)\n*Paul Tobias – rhythm guitar (tracks 1, 3–7, 9, 11, 12 and 14), piano (track 6), arrangements (tracks 1 and 11)\n*Richard Fortus – rhythm guitar (tracks 1, 3–4, 6 and 14)\n*Tommy Stinson – bass guitar (all tracks except 5), backing vocals (tracks 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9), arrangements (track 9)\n*Brain – drums (all tracks except 1), arrangements (tracks 2–4, 6, 10, 12 and 14), initial production (tracks 2 and 10), engineering (track 10), drum machine and drum programming (track 11), Logic Pro engineering\n*Frank Ferrer – drums (tracks 1, 3, 5, 6 and 11)\n*Dizzy Reed – keyboards (tracks 1–4, 6–9, 11 and 14), backing vocals (tracks 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9), synthesizers (tracks 4, 6, 13 and 14), piano (tracks 4 and 5), arrangements (tracks 4, 6, 12 and 14), Logic Pro engineering\n*Chris Pitman – keyboards (tracks 1–8, 10, 12 and 13), sub-bass (all tracks), synthesizers (tracks 4, 6, 13 and 14), bass and drum programming (tracks 5, 6 and 12), backing vocals (tracks 1, 3 and 6), twelve-string guitar (track 11), drum machine and string machine (track 5), Mellotron (track 6), arrangements (tracks 5, 6, 12, 13), digital editing (tracks 5, 12 and 13), engineering (track 1), additional production, Logic Pro engineering\n*Josh Freese – arrangements (tracks 4, 6, 9 and 14)\nAdditional musicians\n*Marco Beltrami – orchestra and arrangements (tracks 4, 6 and 12–14)\n*Paul Buckmaster – orchestra and arrangements (tracks 4, 6, 12 and 14)\n*Suzy Katayama – arrangements (tracks 6, 12 and 13), French horn (track 12)\n*Sebastian Bach – backing vocals (track 10)\n*Patti Hood – harp (track 13)\nDesign'''\n*Ryan Corey – art direction, design\n*Somyot Hananuntasuk – illustrations\n*Sasha Volkova – illustration\n*Terry Hardin – cover photography\n*George Chin – photography\n*Shi Lifeng – artwork (Red Star; 'Controlling' alternate Red Hand cover)\n*Lie Yuan, He An, Jiang Congi, Kevin Zuckerman, Lian Xue Ming, Anton S.
