The Academy was founded in 1774 by Alexander MacWhorter, a cleric and advisor to George Washington, and was located on Market Street in Downtown Newark. Newark Academy was briefly closed after it was burned by the British during the Revolutionary War. The school then reopened in new quarters in 1792. In 1802, the Academy opened a separate division for girls, but this program was closed in 1859. After 1929, it moved to First Street in the Roseville section of Newark. The Academy moved from Newark to its  campus in Livingston, in 1964, and became fully co-educational in 1971.\nCampus\nNewark Academy is located on a  campus in northern New Jersey.\nThe Upper School Academic Center, or the \"New Wing\", opened in fall 2012 and encompasses  of new construction and  of renovated space and includes 13 classrooms, two science labs, a multi-purpose area, several small-group collaborative learning spaces and a commons area.\nThe Wilf Middle School wing opened in fall 2017 and houses two floors of classrooms, laboratories, offices and common spaces that accommodate Middle School teachers and students. Classrooms have Apple TV technology and SmartBoards, which have since been implemented throughout the school. During the construction of the new middle school, Newark Academy also renovated all of the sciences labs, starting with the second-floor natural science and chemistry rooms, and moving on to the first-floor physical science room. These rooms, as well as the laboratories in the middle school, include lab equipment. As part of Experiential learning programs, middle schoolers of every grade go on a series of trips/excursions at the end of the year, called \"Capstone\" to such destinations as the United Nations.\nThe Coraci Performance Hall, which opened in summer 2020, is a 700-seat facility that has been rebuilt to accommodate the increased size of the student body for Morning Meetings and to provide a performance space for student artists that take the stage for dance, choral, orchestral, jazz, and theatrical performances throughout the school year.\nThe Hawkes Memorial Library, opened in 1974, houses a 23,000-volume collection, and a periodical and microfilm collection.\nThe Elizabeth B. McGraw Arts Center, which opened in 1992, contains three studio art classrooms (ceramics, drawing/painting, and a digital media lab for film and photography that opened in the summer of 2022), a band/orchestra room, a choral room, a dance studio, a \"black box\" theater and an art gallery.\nThe William E. and Carol G.
