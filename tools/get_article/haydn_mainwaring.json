He also made several Barbarians appearances, mostly famously as a fullback against the touring 1961 Springboks, with his try-saving shoulder charge on Avril Malan helping secure a 6–0 win. His tackle was described in the press as \"like a comet burying itself into earth\". He won his solitary Wales cap as a centre in a 1961 Five Nations match against France in Paris.\nSee also\n*List of Wales national rugby union players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
