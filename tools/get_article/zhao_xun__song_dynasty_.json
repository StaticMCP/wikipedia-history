He was the first of the three adopted crown princes of the childless Emperor Ningzong. He was a descendant of Emperor Taizu through Zhao Dezhao. He was skilled at calligraphy.\nAs Crown Prince\nHis original name was Zhao Yuyuan and he originally lived in Qingtian. When he was only 6, he was adopted by the childless Emperor Ningzong in 1198. After he was adopted, he changed his name to Zhao Yan.\nIn 1202, he worshipped the military martial arts. He became Crown Prince in 1207. Zhao Yan's son, Zhao Naiyu (趙乃裕), was born around this time but the exact date is unknown. Zhao Naiyu's profile in Geni estimates his birth between 1197 and 1257.
