Following the Romanian Revolution in 1989, it was renamed to the Romanian Armed Forces. It consisted of the Ground Forces, the Navy, and the Air Force.\nHistory\nIn 1944, the Red Army invaded Romania in the Jassy-Kishinev Offensive, causing the overthrow of Ion Antonescu's Nazi-aligned regime via a Royal coup. In 1945, new military regulations were developed based on those of the Red Army and in 1946, Romania came completely under the influence of the Soviet Union. It became part of the Eastern Bloc. The military regulations were finalized in 1949. Like all other socialist states, the Army was subjected to the rule of the Romanian Communist Party, whose general secretary was, since 1974, President of the Republic in addition to his role as commander-in-chief of the army.\nDuring the tenure of General Emil Bodnăraș as defense minister, the Army went through a period of Sovietization, with Bodnăraș personally sending several Romanian Communists to Moscow to be trained in Soviet military institutions such as the Frunze Military Academy. 30% of the experienced officers corps were purged from the military due to fears of opposition and monarchist loyalties. Between 1949 and 1952, over 700 Romanian military personnel were being trained in the USSR, which would drop by over 200 in the next six years. They also adopted a Soviet-style full dress and everyday uniform. In the Republic's early days, the Soviet Armed Forces had troops stationed there. The Soviet presence resulted from the Soviet occupation of Romania. Bodnăraș was seen to have influenced Nikita Khrushchev's decision to withdraw Soviet troops in 1958.\nFrom May 1955 to 1991, Romania was a member of the Warsaw Pact, which provided the Romanian Army with weapons, other Soviet-made equipment, and assistance in building up its own defense industry. Under the presidency of Nicolae Ceaușescu, the RPA asserted functional independence in the defense industry and on equipment acquisitions while maintaining strong ties to the Warsaw Pact Command, with many of its armored vehicles, aircraft and artillery, as well as individual weaponry, being nationally produced. Also, a new set of enlisted and NCO ranks were adopted in the 1970s, alongside the reinstatement of the senior NCO ranks (maistru militar), which replaced the former Soviet rank model for such personnel. On 12 March 1958, the Sports Committee of Friendly Armies was created, with the Romanian Army becoming a founding member. In November 1986, a referendum was held by the government in which voters, when asked whether they approved of reducing the size of the army and cutting military spending by 5%, approved the proposals by 100%, with not a single vote counting against it.\nThe Armed Forces would be renamed in 1989 following the Romanian Revolution, during which officers and personnel of the military defected to the side of the opposition after a public speech by Ceaușescu broadcast on state television and a firing squad provided by paratroop regiment personnel Captain Ionel Boeru, Sergeant-Major Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian Cîrlan took part in the Trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu on 25 December. In the week after Ceaușescu's downfall, the defected Armed Forces fought bloody street battles, allegedly against Securitate forces who were still on Ceaușescu's side.\nPolitical and military leadership\nSupreme Commander-in-Chief\nThe title of Supreme Commander-in-Chief was held by the de facto leader of the nation, General Secretary, even though the President of the State Council was the de jure head of state until 1974, when it was replaced by the President of Romania.\n}}\nMinister of National Defence\nThe office of Minister of National Defence () is the chief political leader of the military. Before that, it was the Minister of War () who handled military affairs in the government. The country's defence policy was managed by the minister's agency, the Ministry of the National Defense, led by a professional officer with the rank of colonel general or above. The minister was a permanent member of the Politburo of the PCR.\n}}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n| officeholder_sort       = Olteanu, Constantin\n| officeholder_note       =\n| term_start              = 29 March 1980\n| term_end                = 16 December 1985\n| timeinoffice            =\n}}\n}}\nChief of the General Staff\nin 1953.

Branch\n! Size\n|-\n| Ground Forces\n| 125,000\n|-\n| Navy\n| 5,000\n|-\n| Air Force\n| 8,000\n|-\n| Total\n| 138,000 officers and troops\n|}\nFrom 1947 to 1960, the military was organized into three military regions: Western (based in Cluj), Eastern (based in Bacău), and South (based in Bucharest). Succeeded by army corps in the 1960s, they were areas that in wartime would become an army corps with their headquarters acting as areas of responsibility.\nGround Forces\nThe senior units in the ground forces were the Tudor Vladimirescu Division and the Horia, Cloșca și Crișan Division, both of which were used as political tools by communist leaders. They were composed of former prisoners of war, Soviet trainees, and Communist activists such as Valter Roman.\nIn 1980, the Romanian Ground Forces were reorganized in 4 Army Commands:\n*1st Army Command (Bucharest)\n*2nd Army Command (Buzău)\n*3rd Army Command (Craiova)\n*4th Army Command (Cluj-Napoca)\nAll four Army Commands consisted of 8 Mechanized Infantry Divisions, 2 Armoured Divisions, 1 Armoured Brigade, 4 Mountain infantry Brigades as specialized motorized infantry units, and an administrative division of 4 parachute infantry regiments. Between 1960 and 1964, the rifle/mechanized divisions were converted to mechanized infantry (motorized rifle) divisions, which resulted in reductions in size due to the merger of both types of units. The newly established mechanized infantry divisions were structured similarly to the Soviet ones, organized into a division HQ, three mechanized infantry regiments, a tank regiment, and a field artillery regiment, as well as battalion-size subunits of other specialties, while the armoured divisions were structured in three tank regiments, a mechanized infantry regiment, a field artillery regiment and several other battalion-size subunits of different specialities.\nThe degree of mechanization of the infantry was not complete, unlike the other member states of the Warsaw Pact, for in 1985 only two of the three infantry battalions from the composition of the mechanized regiments were equipped with wheeled armoured personnel carriers TAB-71 and TAB-77. Even though since 1985, the infantry regiments began receiving new amphibious tracked infantry fighting vehicles MLI-84, the mechanization of the whole infantry had not succeeded until 1989.\nDisbanded by the Soviets in the early years of occupied and post-war Romania, the Vânători de munte (Mountain Huntsmen) was re-established in 1958. It was the equivalent of the Soviet 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division or the American 10th Mountain Division. Due to its equipment comprising MLVM APCs and 76mm mounted guns, it was considered the Ground Forces' best-trained unit. It was organized into four brigades stationed in mountainous areas.\nNavy\nserved as the headquarters for the Navy]]\nIn the early postwar years, the Romanian Navy was deprived of its merchant fleet due to the rapid takeover of the Romanian vessels by the Soviet Navy. In September 1944, the Soviet Navy transferred all Romanian warships to ports in the Caucasus near Azerbaijan and Georgia, all of which were not returned until just over a year later, with the exception o the Regele Ferdinand-class that was kept by the Black Sea Fleet until the early 1950s. Several warships such as Amiral Murgescu were never returned and stayed in Soviet service until they were decommissioned. Once possessing patrol ships, the Romanian Navy formed the Danube Squadron, which later changed its name to the River Brigade in 1959. As a result of the 1940s reform of the naval forces, a patrol squadron was converted into an independent unit, which operated under the Naval Headquarters until May 1951. Four years later, naval ships and Marine units were subordinated to the headquarters.\nIn 1962, the 42nd Maritime Division was founded, continuing the traditions of the Sea Division, a large unit that had ceased to carry out functions since the end of World War II. In the late 70s and early 80s, several naval ships were built in the Romanian shipyards, specifically the Midia and Constanța escort ships from the Brăila shipyard. In the early 1980s, the Navy ramped up efforts to develop its domestic naval industry by building new patrol boats using Chinese and Soviet technology and designs. In 1989, the Romanian Navy had more than 7,500 sailors, all organized into the Black Sea Fleet, the Danube Squadron, and the Coastal Defense. Its major naval bases and shipyards were the ports of Mangalia and Constanța on the Black Sea. Based in Constanța, the 2,000-member Coastal Defense Regiment was the shore-based component of defense against attack from the Black Sea.\nAir Force\nIn 1946, following a reorganization, the Air Force consisted of seven Air Flotillas, of which two were fighter flotillas and the rest were bombardment, assault, information, and transport. A total of 953 aircraft were in service; these included both pre-war and WW2 models like the Bf 109G, IAR 80, IAR 37, Ju 88, etc.\nFollowing a condition imposed during the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947, the strength of the military aviation of Romania was reduced to 150 aircraft, of which 100 were for combat and the rest for training. On 15 February 1949, the Romanian Aviation Command was established following the Soviet model of aviation regiments instead of the British squadron model. This would later be renamed to the Romanian Air Force.\nThe first jet fighters arrived in 1951, with the first Jet Air Division (Divizia Aeriană Reactivă'') being established on 1 April of the same year, at Ianca. The unit was equipped with Soviet-made Yak-23 and Yak-17 fighters and had three Regiments (the 11th, 12th, and 13th). The 97th Jet Fighter Aviation Division was declared combat ready on 15 September 1951. The first interception mission was carried out on the night of 28/29 October 1952, when a Soviet Il-28 bomber entered Romanian airspace unauthorized. The first MiG-15s also entered service in 1952. These aircraft were first in use with the Soviet Regiments deployed at Craiova and Deveselu and were transferred to the Romanian Air Force in September 1952. The first supersonic flight happened on 5 March 1958, with a MiG-19 at the Deveselu Air Base.\nIn 1969, an air defence unit was created to protect against air attacks, while a paratrooper regiment was founded in 1980, both of which were assigned to the Câmpia Turzii Air Base (now the RoAF 71st Air Base). A Romanian-made IAR-93 attack aircraft flew its first flight on 31 October 1974 over Bacău, marking the first jet fighter in the Eastern Bloc to be domestically manufactured. The Mikoyan MiG-29 aircraft entered the inventory of the Air Force just a few days before the Romanian Revolution of December 1989.\nPatriotic Guards\n]]\nFormed in 1968 after Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968, the Romanian Patriotic Guards was an organization dedicated to public security, with its functions including civil policing to an active reserve for the Army. During wartime, the President of the Republic could authorize the guards to become a large \"Militia\" that would provide military police-style security, as well as augment the ground forces, and operate as guerrillas forces. The force was not part of the Ministry of National Defence but was a direct reporting unit of the PCR and the Union of Communist Youth, of which it drafted members of both. Members of the guards were considered territorial troops (Forțele teritoriale), as they were organized into companies and/or platoons and were based in every județ, municipality, and industrial/agricultural area under the command of the first secretary of the local PCR.\nSecuritate Troops\nOn 23 January 1949, the communist government disbanded the Royal Romanian Gendarmerie only to purge its personnel and redistribute them to the newly created Directorate for Security Troops (DTO) of the Securitate (Department of State Security), modeled after the NKVD's Internal Troops and the KGB. It acted as a 20,000-strong elite paramilitary force consisting of select people drawn from the Army's conscript pool. It was organized into infantry units equipped with small arms, artillery, and armored personnel carriers. The security troops were directly responsible to the Minister of the Interior and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, allowing them to guard important installations, including PCR office buildings and state radio and television stations.\nThe regime of Ceaușescu could have theoretically called in the security troops as a private army to prevent a military coup d'état and/or suppress antiregime riots. It operated under a more strict discipline and routine than the regular military, which resulted in their special treatment and enjoyment of better living conditions than their counterparts. In late 1989, the directorate was disbanded and replaced first by the Guard and Order Troops (Trupele de Pază și Ordine) and later on by the reformed Gendarmerie.\nEquipment\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Weapon\n!Origin\n!Type\n!Notes\n!Photo\n|-\n|TTC\n|\n|Semi-automatic pistol\n|TT-33 pistol produced in Romania under TTC designation.\n|\n|-\n|Pistol Carpați Md. 1974\n|\n|Semi-automatic pistol\n|Standard issue pistol.\n|\n|-\n|Orița M1941\n|\n|Submachine gun\n|Used by the Patriotic Guards until the 1970s.\n|\n|-\n|Pistol Mitralieră model 1963/1965\n|\n|Assault rifle\n|Standard issue until the 1980s when it was replaced by Pușcă Automată model 1986\n|\n|-\n|Pușcă Automată model 1986\n|\n|Assault rifle\n|Ment to replace Pistol Mitralieră model 1963/1965.\n|\n|-\n|PM md. 64\n|\n|Light machine gun\n|\n|\n|-\n|ZB vz. 30\n|\n|Light machine gun\n|Produced under license.
