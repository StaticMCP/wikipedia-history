The year, the Hyde, Hadfield and District Weavers' Association''' was established, its Hadfield branch being established in 1881.  In 1884, it was a founder member of the Amalgamated Weavers' Association.\nThe union grew quickly, with branches in other local towns and villages, and had 4,500 members by the 1890s.  Unlike unions in many other industries, the large majority of its members were women.  By 1906, long-term general secretary William Pope was in post, and that year he helped set up the nearby Stockport Weavers' Association.\nBy 1910, the union recognised its broader membership by adopting the name '''Hyde, Hadfield, Compstall, Broadbottom and Marple Weavers', Winders' and Warpers' Association'''.  At this time, it had 7,200 members.  In 1922, the small Glossop and District Power Loom Weavers union merged into it, but Glossop was not appended to its name.\nMembership of the union declined along with the British cotton industry, and by 1968 it was down to only 550.  That year, it shortened its name to the \"Hyde and District Weavers', Winders' and Doublers' Association\".  In 1972, the union merged with the Ashton-under-Lyne and District Power-Loom Weavers' Association and the Stockport and District Weavers', Winders', Warpers' and Reelers' Association, forming the South East Lancashire and Cheshire Weavers' and Winders' Association.\nGeneral Secretaries\n:William Bancroft\n:1890s: J.
