It was the band's most successful, selling approximately 250,000 copies in the United States. The title track was later re-recorded in by Aerosmith on their 1985 reunion album Done With Mirrors, albeit with a slightly different melody and Steven Tyler-penned lyrics.\nBackground\nFed up with the slow pace of the recording of Night in the Ruts and frustrated with the band's precarious financial situation, Perry left Aerosmith in the spring of 1979. He recruited Aerosmith's former producer Jack Douglas and chose Ralph Morman for lead singer, who Perry had previously heard performing in a band called Daddy Warbux. The group was rounded out by bassist David Hull and drummer Ronnie Stewart. \"The contrast between the tortuous ordeal of recording Aerosmith and the seamless groove that characterized the Project was remarkable,\" Perry later recalled.\nRecording and composition\nConsidering Aerosmith's struggles, Columbia Records was initially hesitant to give Perry a solo deal, but he assured them he could turn in an album in \"five or six weeks.\" In his 2014 autobiography Rocks, the guitarist states that the songs were largely autobiographical:\nReception\n| rev2 =''Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal\n| rev2Score = 10/10\n}}\nLet the Music Do the Talking received generally favorable reviews from critics. Greg Prato of AllMusic wrote that \"maybe because he wanted to show his former band mates that he could succeed without them, the performances were extremely inspired, while the songwriting was sharp and focused... A truly great and underrated record, Let the Music Do the Talking'' could have been a classic Aerosmith release if the drugs hadn't split the band apart.\" Canadian journalist Martin Popoff remarked how in comparison with Aerosmith albums Let the Music Do the Talking has \"a greater emphasis on both control and funkiness, yet still exuding tons of warmth and larger-than-life riffery\", and praised Perry for his \"eccentric, concentric interpretations of the blues.\"\nLet the Music Do the Talking proved to be The Joe Perry Project's highest charting album, peaking at #47 on Billboard.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n;The Joe Perry Project\n*Ralph Morman – vocals\n*Joe Perry – guitars, lead vocals on tracks 2, 4, 7 and 9, backing vocals, bass synthesizer on track 1, percussion, producer, cover concept\n*David Hull – bass guitar, bass synthesizer on track 8, backing vocals\n*Ronnie Stewart – drums, percussion\n; Additional musicians\n*Rocky Donahue – percussion\n;Production\n*Jack Douglas – percussion, producer, mixing at The Record Plant, New York\n*Lee DiCarlo – engineer, mixing\n*Chris Tergesen, Julie Last – assistant engineers\n*Greg Calbi – mastering at Sterling Sound, New York\n*John Berg – cover concept\n*Jerry Abramowitz, Ron Pownall – photography\n*David Krebs, Steve Leber – management\nReferences"
