He made his debut in first-class cricket for Hampshire against Leicestershire at Bournemouth in the 1898 County Championship. He played irregularly for Hampshire until 1902, making five appearances. In these, he scored 53 runs with a highest score of 40. Shortly after his final match for Hampshire, Phillips emigrated to South Africa.\nThere he played first-class cricket for Border, making his debut against Transvaal at King William's Town in March 1907. He played for Border until 1913, making twelve first-class appearances, eight of which came in the Currie Cup. For Border, he scored 223 runs at an average of 11.15, with a highest score of 47. Phillips died in South Africa at East London in March 1960.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
