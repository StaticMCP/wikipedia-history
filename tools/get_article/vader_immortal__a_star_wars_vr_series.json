Each episode includes a dojo which allows players to practice against waves of enemies using a lightsaber and Force powers.\nThe player follows a linear path through the game, able to use the Force to do various things as necessary to move forward to the next area.\nSynopsis\nThe series, taking place between the events of Revenge of the Sith and Rogue One, follows a Force-sensitive smuggler, a descendant of the famous Lady Corvax, who is taken captive by Darth Vader (Scott Lawrence). Vader requires the smuggler to gain access to the Bright Star, an ancient artifact that once destroyed nearly all life on Mustafar. Aided by his droid ZO-E3 (Maya Rudolph), the Mustafarian loremaster Vylip F'alma (Keith Ferguson), Corvax's husband Black Bishop (David Sobolov), and a Mustafarian priestess (Folake Olowofoyeku), the smuggler goes on a journey through Mustafar, learning lightsaber combat and harnessing his Force powers along the way, before facing off against the cybernetic Imperial admiral Gable Karius (Steve Blum) and Vader himself, who seeks to use the Bright Star to bring back Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman).\nDevelopment\nAll three chapters were written by writer David S. Goyer and directed by special effects artist Ben Snow. According to Snow, the premise of searching for an ancient artifact was inspired by the film Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n| JXV = 15/20\n| Upload VR = 4/5\n}}\nMetacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the PlayStation 4 version a score of 69 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".
