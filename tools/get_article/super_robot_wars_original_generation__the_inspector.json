About her mecha, she was supposedly given a customized Valsion, but she didn't like how it looked... so Bian modified its look to resemble a giant, walking robot version of herself, the Valsione, complete with hair and an emotion copy system (its face changes according to Lune's current expression).\n;:\n: Is a calm, loyal, clear-headed man with a pleasant attitude, akin to that of a gentleman.\n: He has a strong sense of justice, often disliking to see the weak being bullied or hurt by those with power.\n;:\n: A passionate, 18-year-old girl, Ricarla \"Carla\" Borgnine is extremely nice and caring to her companions and comrades, usually helping them with their problems, regardless of how minuscule they may be.

Arado can let his ego get the better of him at times, particularly when it involves arguing with Seolla, with the end result being berated at, even getting delivered a swift beating from her. Nevertheless, his relationship with her is utterly strong, reflecting their promise to look out for each other during their days at The School. For a growing, young man, Arado possesses a rather strange appetite—he is known to down three full-course meals in one sitting, shocking most people. Also, he is one of the few people to try Kusuha Mizuha's health drinks and not faint, and the first to claim the concoction, which is shunned by all who've tried it (and by people that haven't tried it), is delicious.\n;\n:\nHe has appeared as an enemy character in the Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation series.\nInspectors\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\nNeue DC\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\nShadow Mirror\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\nEinst\n;\n:\n;\n:\n;\n:\nMedia\nAnime\nThe anime was produced by Asahi Production and Sotsu Agency with Masami Ōbari as the director.
