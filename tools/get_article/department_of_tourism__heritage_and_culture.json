Its mandate promote the province's tourism industry and maintain its official provincial parks.\nIts mandate was widely expanded in March 2012 when Premier David Alward restructured government. It was merged with the Department of Wellness, Culture and Sport to form the new Department of Culture, Tourism and Healthy-Living. This new department was short-lived however with it being split back up in October 2012 into the Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture (which held the mandate of the former Department of Tourism and Parks as well as an oversight of community arts development and heritage programs) and a Department of Healthy and Inclusive Communities.[http://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2012.09.0890.html]\nMinisters\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!#\n!Minister\n!Term\n!Government\n|-\n!colspan=4|Minister of Tourism and Parks\n|-\n|1.\n|Paul Robichaud\n|October 9, 2001 - June 27, 2003\n|rowspan=2|under Bernard Lord\n|-\n|2.\n|Joan MacAlpine\n|June 27, 2003 - October 3, 2006\n|-\n|3.\n|Stuart Jamieson\n|October 3, 2006 - February 5, 2010\n|rowspan=3|under Shawn Graham\n|-\n|4.\n|Hédard Albert\n|February 5, 2010 - May 10, 2010 (acting)\n|-\n|5.\n|Brian Kenny\n|May 10, 2010 - Oct. 12, 2010\n|-\n|6.\n|Trevor Holder\n|Oct. 12, 2010 - Mar. 15, 2012\n|under David Alward\n|-\n!colspan=4|Minister of Culture, Tourism and Healthy-Living\n|-\n|7.\n|Trevor Holder\n|Mar. 15, 2012 - Oct. 9, 2012\n|under David Alward\n|-\n!colspan=4|Minister of Tourism, Heritage and Culture\n|-\n|8.\n|Trevor Holder\n|Oct. 9, 2012 – October 7, 2014\n|under David Alward\n|-\n|9.\n||Bill Fraser\n|October 7, 2014 - June 5, 2016\n|under Brian Gallant\n|-\n|10.\n|John Ames\n|June 6, 2016 - October 5, 2018\n|under Brian Gallant\n|-\n|11.\n|Gilles LePage\n|October 6, 2018 - November 8 2018\n|under Brian Gallant\n|-\n|12.\n|Robert Gauvin\n|November 9, 2018 - February 24, 2020\n|under Blaine Higgs\n|-\n|13.\n|Bruce Fitch\n|February 24, 2020 - September 29, 2020\n|under Blaine Higgs\n|-\n|14.\n|Tammy Scott-Wallace\n|September 29, 2020 - November 2, 2024\n|under Blaine Higgs\n|-\n|15.\n|Isabelle Thériault\n|November 2, 2024 - Present\n|under Susan Holt\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.gnb.ca/0397/index-e.asp Tourism and Parks website]"
