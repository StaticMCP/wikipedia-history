Beginning in 2001, the show was originally broadcast on Radio Disney only until 2007, when the awards show went on hiatus before returning in 2013. In 2014, it began to be televised on Disney Channel.\nIn 2019, the awards ceremony was renamed the \"ARDYs\". No awards ceremony was held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although a pre-recorded \"ARDYs Summer Playlist\" special aired that year. After Disney announced in December 2020 that Radio Disney would be shut down in the first quarter of 2021, with the network officially shutting down on April 14, 2021, the awards ceremony was quietly discontinued.\nHistory\nThe Radio Disney Music Awards honored the year's achievements in music, mainly in the teen pop genre, and were awarded based on popular vote from the network's listeners via online voting. The trophy awarded to a winner is known as the \"Golden Mickey\", a gold-colored statuette with a silhouette figure of Mickey Mouse wearing headphones nicknamed the \"Ardy\", representing Radio Disney's initials. The awards were first presented in 2001, but the ceremony was not televised beyond commercial interstitial segments for Disney Channel to promote their sister radio network. After 2007, the ceremony went on a five year hiatus until 2013. Starting in 2014, the ceremony began to be televised the day after it was held on a tape-delay, as the network attempted to compete with Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards in airing awards programming. Starting in 2016, Canadians were able to vote for the first time as Disney programming, formerly under the control of Family Channel, moved to Disney-branded Corus Entertainment networks in both English and French when these networks launched in September 2015.\nIn 2019, the Radio Disney Music Awards were renamed ARDYs: A Radio Disney Music Celebration and aired live for the first time instead of on a tape-delay on June 16, 2019.\nIn 2020, a pre-recorded special, Radio Disney Presents ARDYs Summer Playlist, aired in place of an awards ceremony on July 10, 2020. Laura Marano served as the host.\nAwards events\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! Year\n!
