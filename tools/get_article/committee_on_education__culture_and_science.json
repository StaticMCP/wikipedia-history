This committee was first established on January 31, 2001, during the 151th session of the National Diet. The committee's jurisdiction was established by parliamentary procedure and set to deliberate matters under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. Members of the committee are appointed by the House of Councillors (Diet Law Article 42, clause 1). Members of the committee are nominated by the President (The Rules of the House of Councillors Article 30, clause 1). In practice, each political group is allocated seats on the committee in proportion to the number of seats it has in the House of Councillors and then each political group decides which of its members will be assigned to the committee. The chairperson of the committee is elected from among the members of the committee (Diet Law 25, clause 1) or selected by the President (The Rules of the House of Councillors Article 16, clause 2), but the latter happens most of the time.\nMembers, 211th Diet\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Position!!Name!!Political group\n|-\n!Chairman\n|Katsunori Takahashi\n||Liberal Democratic Party\n|-\n!rowspan=4|Director\n|Masaaki Akaike\n|rowspan=2 |Liberal Democratic Party\n|-\n|Eriko Imai\n|-\n|Hiroto Kumagai\n| rowspan=\"1\" |Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan\n|-\n|Takae Itō\n||Democratic Party for the People and The Shin-Ryokufukai\n|-\n!rowspan=20|Member\n|Ken Akamatsu\n|rowspan=7 |Liberal Democratic Party\n|-\n|Michiko Ueno\n|-\n|Shoichi Usui\n|-\n|Mitsuru Sakurai\n|-\n|Shinsuke Suematsu\n|-\n|Harumi Takahashi\n|-\n|Seiko Hashimoto\n|-\n|Chikage Koga\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan\n|-\n|Yoshitaka Saitō\n|-\n|Haruko Miyaguchi\n|-\n|Takae Itō\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Komeito\n|-\n|Shinji Takeuchi\n|-\n|Kiyoshi Nakajo\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Nippon Ishin no Kai\n|-\n|Shigefumi Matsuzawa\n|-\n|Yoshiko Kira\n||Japanese Communist Party\n|-\n|Yasuhiko Funago\n||Reiwa Shinsengumi\n|}\nReferences"
