In the , Carpentaria had a population of 25 people.\nGeography\nThe locality is on the southern coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is part of the Gulf Country. The Leichhardt River forms the western boundary of the locality ().\nThe coastal strip is mangrove swamps, while the land use in the remainder of the locality is grazing on native vegetation.\nCarpentaria has the following coastal features, from west to east:\n* Leichhardt River mouth ()\n* Gore Point ()\n* Disaster Inlet ()\n* Middle Point ()\n* Morning Inlet ()\nThe north-western corner of the locality (alongside the Leichhardt River) is within the Finucane Island National Park. It is an estuarine wetland which is important for its fish and waterbirds habitats. Its seagrasses are used for grazing by dugongs. It is only accessible by boat and visitors should beware of crocodiles.\nThe Burketown Normanton Road passes through the locality from the south-east (Normanton) to the south-west (Stokes).\nHistory\nThe name derives from the Gulf of Carpentaria, a name used on Dutch charts since 1700.\nGore Point was named in July 1841 by Lieutenant John Lort Stokes of . It was named after Lieutenant Graham Gore who also served on the Beagle. Disaster Inlet was also named by Stokes after Gore's accident with an exploding firearm which wounded Gore in the hand.\nIn 2015, significant die-back of mangroves occurred due to extremely dry weather conditions lowering the level of the sea water. Climate change is suggested to be the cause.\nDemographics\nIn the , Carpentaria had a population of 14 people.\nIn the , Carpentaria had a population of 25 people.\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Carpentaria.
