Treaty negotiations with several Western countries were made possible by the completion of this initial Japanese overture.\nIn 1882, the Americans concluded a treaty and established diplomatic relations, which served as a template for subsequent negotiations with other Western powers.\nTreaty provisions\nThe Belgians and Koreans negotiated and approved a multi-article treaty with provisions similar to other Western nations.\nMinisters from Belgium to Korea were appointed in accordance with this treaty; and they were Leon Vincart, consul general, October 17, 1901, with Maurice Cuvelier as vice consul.\nThe treaty remained in effect even after the Japanese protectorate was established in 1905.\nSee also\n* Unequal treaties\n* List of Ambassadors from Belgium to South Korea\nNotes\nReferences\n* Kim, Chun-gil.
