DREAM supports formal verification of scheduling based on task timed automata using the Uppaal model checker and the Verimag IF toolset as well as the random testing of real-time components using a discrete event simulator. DREAM is developed at the Center for Embedded Computer Systems at the University of California, Irvine, in cooperation with researchers from Vanderbilt University.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://dre.sourceforge.net DREAM website]\n*[http://www.cecs.uci.edu Center for Embedded Computer Systems]\n*[http://www.uppaal.com Uppaal website]\n*[http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~async/IF/ IF toolset website]"
