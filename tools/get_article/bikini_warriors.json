Clad in generously cut-out, yet effective bikini-type armor, the four women must learn to overcome the hazards of their world to meet their living expenses while at the same time trying to get comfortable with the idea of exposing too much of their curvaceous physiques.\nCharacters\nMain characters\n;\n: |Felecia Angelle}}\n: A redhaired, somewhat impulsive and stubborn woman, and the party's leader. She is also the daughter of a legendary warrior who saved the country in the past.\n;\n:\n: A beautiful blonde woman who (most unbecoming to her vocation) harbors closeted sexual desires.\n;\n:\n: The youngest and most timid member of the adventure party, the Mage is a petite purple-haired girl skilled in the art of sorcery.\n;\n:\n: A member of the Dark Elf race who assists the party with a versatile combination of combat and magic-using skills. Initially quite haughty when she first joined, she has shed much of her attitude as the four of them have kept adventuring together.\nOther characters\n;\n: |Tia Ballard}}\n: A survivalist with horrible cooking skills who becomes a very close partner of Valkyrie.\n;\n: |Mallorie Rodak}}\n: A lady of noble birth who has decided to dedicate her life to fighting evil. Valkyrie is very arrogant and tsundere in nature.\n;\n: }}\n: A petite-looking priestess of a war deity, whose specialty lies in combat-related magic at the expense of her clerical healing capacities.\n;\n:\n: A young female ninja who intends to steal all the bikini armor she can find in order to eventually get her hands on the most legendary bikini armor.\n;\n: }}\n: A very determined and strong fightress who likes to express herself with otherworldly (i.e., computer game–related) terms. She claims to have once been a school girl from Earth who fell into the fantasy world. However, despite her grimness, she is deathly afraid of the undead.\n;\n:\n: A demon-like, childish girl who can awake and control the dead with her magic, and even transform the living coming into contact with her into undead. A necro-fetishist, she wishes to attach herself to another girl, preferably Black Knight, and make them her zombie companion.\nMedia\nAnime\nAn anime television series based on the manga by studios Feel and PRA aired from July 8 to September 23, 2015.

She recently broke free of the brainwashing and formed a partnership with Necromancer. After finishing her story, Black Knight is annoyed when Necromancer claims her story was made up before she and the Bikini Warriors fall asleep, leaving her ranting that selling the story could give them great profit.\n}}\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
