The Presidency is the latest of a variety of political positions to govern the island. The office was established in 1949 after a new constitution establishing Alderney as a subordinate part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey.\nHistory\nBefore the office of President was established, the leaders of Alderney were the Judges of Alderney, who were appointed as representatives of the Crown in Alderney. During the Second World War, the majority of the population of Alderney was evacuated. In the Occupation of the Channel Islands by Nazi Germany, Alderney was used by the Nazis as a location for two concentration camps. After the Liberation, less than 50% of Alderney's population returned, leading to an urgent discussion taking part in the Parliament of the United Kingdom because land boundaries and property documents had been destroyed.\nSince 1949\nIn 1947, His Majesty's Privy Council decided that Guernsey might take over administration of Alderney. In 1948 the Alderney (Application of Legislation) Law was passed by both the States of Guernsey and the States of Alderney, which provided financial administration responsibility for certain public services to be assumed by the States of Guernsey. The law provided for the establishment of the office of President of Alderney to be the elected leader of Alderney in civil life under the Lieutenant-Governor of Guernsey.\nThe President is elected for a four-year term and is also the chairman of the States of Alderney. The President also holds the right to vote in the States of Alderney; however, this is only used to make the deciding vote in the event of a tied vote. The next election for President will be in 2028.\nDuties\nThe President's Office is responsible for the following:\n* Production and issue of the Billet D'Etat, Deliberations and Hansard Reports\n* Dealing with Members of the Public and other Government offices\n* Official Flag Flying\n* Organising civic and social events including Vin d'Honneurs and visits by dignitaries\n* Honours and Awards\nList of presidents of Alderney\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#c0ffff; text-align:center;\"| President of Alderney\n|-\n| Sydney Peck Herivel || 1 January 194926 August 1970\n|-\n| George William Baron (1st time) || 197077\n|-\n| Jon Kay-Mouat (1st time) || 197794\n|-\n| George William Baron (2nd time) || 199497\n|-\n| Jon Kay-Mouat (2nd time) || 199719 January 2002\n|-\n| Sir Norman Browse || 19 January 200222 June 2011\n|-\n| Stuart Trought || 15 May 2019\n|-\n| James Dent, Interim President || 15 May 201928 June 2019\n|-\n| William Tate ||  28 June 2019present\n|}\nSee also\n* Leader of Alderney\nReferences"
