From this marriage, Queen Gyeongseong became the ninth reigned Goryeo queen who followed her maternal clan after Queen Wonhwa, her stepmother.\nBiography\nLady Wang was born in 1015 as the only daughter of Royal Consort Wonsun of the Gyeongju Kim clan and King Hyeongjong of Goryeo.\nThrough her maternal aunt (the princess' mother's younger sister), she was the older first cousins of Queen Inhye, Royal Consort Ingyeong and Royal Consort Injeol; who were the consorts of King Munjong of Goryeo, the future 11th King of Goryeo.\nWhen still a child and royal princess, she was called Oldest Daughter of the Gyeongheung Residence () since it was her mother's official residence.
