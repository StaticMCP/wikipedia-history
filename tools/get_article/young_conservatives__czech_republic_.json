It is the youth wing of the centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS), and shares that party's conservative and economical liberal ideology.\nMK is open to young people within the ages of 15 to 35. The current chair of the Young Conservatives is David Vančík, since 2019.\nHistory\nThe founding congress was held on 8 December 1991, following preparations through the Charter of Young Conservatives by a group of students at the Brno University of Technology and the \"Všehrd\" Law Students' Association at the Faculty of Law of Charles University in Prague. David Částek was elected as first leader of the Young Conservatives.\nNotable ODS politicians who started as members of Young Conservatives include Jan Zahradil, Jiří Pospíšil, Petr Sokol, Martin Baxa, Petr Gandalovič, Ivan Langer, Martin Novotný, and Pavel Drobil. Former Young Conservatives leader Petr Mach went on to found the Party of Free Citizens.\nIdeology\nThe original ideological course of the Young Conservatives was set out in the Charter of Young Conservatives, following basic conservative principles: democracy, nationhood, rule of law, liberty, free market, tradition, private ownership, family, and morality. Through its history, the Young Conservatives have closely cooperated with the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). The organization defines its approach towards the European Union as \"Eurorealistic\" or Euroskeptic.\nLeaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Name\n!
