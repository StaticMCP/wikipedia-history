The series features mobile suits from several eras of the Gundam franchise and some non-traditional fighting game elements. Every entry was developed by Bandai in co-operation with Japanese developer Natsume, who also made the 1996 Shin Kidō Senki Gundam Wing: Endless Duel.\nGundam: The Battle Master\n| genre = Versus Fighting\n| modes = Single player, multiplayer\n| platforms = PlayStation\n}}\nOverview\nGundam: The Battle Master is the first game in the series, released for the PlayStation in 1997. Even this first game features the large multi-jointed sprites and 2-screen-high stages that the rest of the series would follow on. The game would also feature its own unique pilots that are exclusive to this game, replacing the regular pilots that are often associated with each mobile suit in the franchise. It includes the following mobile suits from the Universal Century era:\n;Playable\n* FA-010S Full Armor Enhanced ZZ Gundam\n* MS-06F Zaku II\n* MSM-03C Hygogg\n* MSN-02 Zeong\n* MSN-04 Sazabi\n* NZ-000 Quin Mantha\n* PMX-003 The O\n* RX-78-2 Gundam\n* RX-78GP02A Gundam Physallis\n* RX-93 Nu Gundam\n;Bosses (Non-Playable)\n* MA-08 Big Zam\n* AMX-002 (AMA-X2) Neue Ziel\n* Psyco Gundam Mark III\nGameplay\nGundam: The Battle Master features gameplay unlike most fighting games, let alone the other games within its series:\n* Mobile suit movement is realistically slow.\n* Repeated damage to a specific body part on an enemy will result in that part's armor breaking.\n* There's no standard \"health bar\". Instead, a mobile suit has a \"temperature bar\" that would fill up as it gets hit. When the bar is full, the mobile suit overheats and is knocked down. When a mobile suit overheats four times, it is knocked out and loses the fight.\n* The standard punch and kick buttons are complemented by a shoot button (for firing beam rifles or machine guns), a weapon button (beam sabers, heat hawks, etc.), and a thrust button that allows the mobile suit to fly indefinitely. This is similar to Endless Duel, as well as games such as Capcom's Cyberbots.\n* Projectiles are unblockable.\n* Special moves are limited. A mobile suit will have a rapid fire version of the shoot button and one or two unique moves. All special moves drain a bar below the temperature bar that can only be filled by connecting with melee attacks.\n* Some mobile suits can dodge into the background to avoid attacks, while others can erect a beam barrier that can block projectiles (which can be held indefinitely unless hit by a melee attack).\n* Bosses are massive and fill up nearly half the screen. They can not be knocked back by any attack unless they overheat.\nGundam: The Battle Master 2 and Gundam: Battle Assault\nGundam: Battle Assault 2 and The Battle\nMobile Suit Gundam Seed: Battle Assault and Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny\nMobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny\n| genre = Versus Fighting\n| modes = Single player, multiplayer\n| platforms = Game Boy Advance\n}}\nIn 2004, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Battle Assault was released for the Game Boy Advance and featured units exclusively from the then-recent localization of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. The units included all the Gundams from the show sans the Providence, as well as Rau Le Creuset's CGUE and the Gundam Astray Red Frame. It was released exclusively in the US.\nThe gameplay for this portable installment is similar to its three PlayStation predecessors, with the difference of being faster and more user-friendly. The player had the option of choosing a manual method for executing special moves or an automatic one (similar to the easy mode of Capcom's Vs. series). The player could also adjust one of three parameters (HP, Phase Shift Armor or Thrust) at the cost of the other.\nThere was also an updated version of the game focusing on the SEED Destiny sequel series, named simply Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. Unlike the original game, however, it was released only in Japan and included the original game as an unlockable. This version features all the units from the previous plus the initial suits of the SEED Destiny anime (it lacks GOUF Ignited, Murasame, Dom Trooper, Strike Freedom, Infinite Justice, Destiny, Legend and Akatsuki).\nBattle Assault 3 Featuring Gundam SEED\n| genre = Versus Fighting\n| modes = Single player, multiplayer\n| platforms = PlayStation 2\n}}\nBattle Assault 3 is the fifth game in the series. It was released on the PlayStation 2, four months after the GBA installment. It was the first to feature full 3D graphics and it also focused on units from the Gundam Seed anime, including grunt mobile suits like GINNs. However, the Wing Gundam Zero Custom, Tallgeese III, Burning (God) Gundam and Master Gundam appear as unlockable secret characters. It was only released in the US.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://hg101.kontek.net/gundam/gundam4.htm Hardcore Gaming 101: Gundam 2D Fighting Games (Part 3 - GBA Series)]\nSee also\n* Shin Kidō Senki Gundam Wing: Endless Duel\n* List of fighting games"
