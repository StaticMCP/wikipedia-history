Given the shortage of regular troops, Ribas had to arm a thousand students from colleges and seminaries in the city and other neighboring towns, including 85 students of the Seminary of Santa Rosa de Lima, Caracas. Before going into battle, General Ribas addressed the youths who accompanied him, ending with these words:\nThe battle began at seven in the morning and lasted all day on the streets of the city. Republican troops built an impressive resistance to withstand the Royalist troops, led at that time by Francisco Tomás Morales. By late afternoon, victory had not yet gone to either side. While the fighting raged, the Patriots received a reinforcement of 220 infantry under Vicente Campo Elías, from San Mateo, that effectively broke the siege.\nHours later, Morales and his men withdrew through the mountains towards Pao de Zárate, pursued by the Republican cavalry. As a result of this Battle, the Royalist attempt to cut communications between Caracas and Valencia had failed.\nBolivar, informed about the victory of Ribas, granted him the title of \"Defeater of Tyrants\".\nOn 12 February 1947, the Constituent Assembly decreed that Venezuela would celebrate each anniversary of the battle as Youth Day, in honor of the young people who achieved this important victory. In Victoria's main square there is a sculptural group made by Eloy Palacios, erected in 1895, representing Ribas showing a youth how to use a rifle.\nReferences"
