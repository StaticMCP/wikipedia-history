Joe Harvanik was the team captain.\nDelaware did not play its scheduled date with Lafayette on Oct. 12, as an outbreak of Asian flu affecting more than 20 of the Leopards' players prompted them to cancel the game.\nThe Blue Hens played their home games at Delaware Stadium on the university campus in Newark, Delaware.\nSchedule\n|October 5||Bowling Green|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|L 0-7| 6,000 |\n|October 12|at|Lafayette|Fisher Field|Easton, PA|canceled||\n|October 19||New Hampshire|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 59-6| 6,200 |\n|October 26|at|Connecticut|Memorial Stadium|Storrs, CT|L 9-13| 7,643 |\n|November 2||Rutgers|Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, NJ|W 23-19| 5,500 |\n|November 9||Temple|Delaware Stadium|Newark, DE|W 71-7| 6,000 |\n|November 16|at|Bucknell|Memorial Stadium|Lewisburg, PA|W 34-13| 4,000 |\n}}\nReferences"
