By 2001 to 2006, the Imperial Combat Revue performed two major musicals in a year: a New Year's Show and a Summer Kayou Show, in addition to multitudes of other smaller shows where one or more characters make appearances.  Some of the stage performances could be seen in the series' other forms of media.\nIn August 2006, the Imperial Combat Revue held their final summer show.  Although the live-action shows still continue as of May 2007, they are no longer focused entirely on the Imperial Combat Revue.\nSummer Kayou Shows\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|(Because of Love)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* First Summer Kayou Show\n* Performed from July 19 to 21, 1997\n* Appeared briefly in Sakura Taisen and in the manga.\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|(Wings)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Second Summer Kayou Show\n* Performed from August 11 to 16, 1998\n* First show to include characters Reni Milchstraβe and Soletta Orihime\n* First to introduce Dandy Boss and his gang\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|( Crimson Lizard)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Third Summer Kayou Show\n* Performed from August 4 to 7, 1999\n* Appeared briefly in Sakura Taisen: Gouka Kenran\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|( Rose of Arabia)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Fourth Summer Kayou Show\n* Performed from July 23 to August 4, 2000\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|(''The Sea God's Villa'')\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Fifth Summer Kayou Show\n* Performed from August 10 to 18, 2001\n* Based on Kyōka Izumi's \"Kaijin Bessō\"\n* Includes the Paris Hanagumi Tokubetsu (\"Paris Flower Division Special) Mini Live Show on August 13, where the Paris Flower Division performed live for the first time.\n* Appeared near the ending of Sakura Taisen: Katsudou Shashin, though the content was altered\n|}\nSuper Kayou Shows\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Shin-pen Hakkenden(The New Hakkenden)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* First Super Kayou Show\n* Performed from August 15 to 25, 2002\n* First kayou show that did not include a live orchestra\n* Based on Kyokutei Bakin's Nansō Satomi Hakkenden\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Shin Takarajima(The New Treasure Island)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Second Super Kayou Show\n* Performed from August 15 to 21, 2003\n* Based on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island\n* Recorded album received the 17th Japanese Gold Disc Award for the best Anime Album of the Year in 2003\n* Appeared briefly in Sakura Taisen\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Shin Saiyuki(The New Journey to the West)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Third Super Kayou Show\n* Performed from August 13 to 19, 2004\n* Based on one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, Journey to the West\n* Appeared briefly in Sakura Taisen\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Shin Aoi Tori(The New Blue Bird)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Fourth Super Kayou Show\n* Performed from August 13 to 20, 2005\n* Based on a 1908 play by Maurice Maeterlinck known as \"''L'Oiseau Bleu''\"\n* Appeared briefly in Sakura Taisen 2\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Shin Ai Yueni(The New Because of Love)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Final Super Kayou Show\n* Performed from August 12 to 22, 2006\n* Last summer live show focusing on the Teikoku Kagekidan\n|}\nNew Year Kayou Shows\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Shinshun Kayou Show 2001(2001 New Year Show)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Performed from January 3 to 7, 2001\n* First live show featuring the Teikoku Kagekidan performing the taiko\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Harukoi Shisumireyume Nowakare\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Sumire Kanzaki's retirement performance, in lieu of a regular New Year show\n* Performed from January 2 to 6, 2002\n* Title is reminiscent of kabuki and translates to \"Calling up the image of blooming violets at the time of separation, how far I long for spring...\"\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Shichi Fukujin(Seven Lucky Gods)\n| width=\"500pt\" valign=\"top\" align=\"left\"|Notes:\n* Performed from January 3 to 7, 2003\n* Refers to the seven gods of good fortune found in the Japanese Shintō religion, mythology, and folklore.\n|-\n| width=\"200pt\" valign=\"center\" align=\"center\"|Utae!
