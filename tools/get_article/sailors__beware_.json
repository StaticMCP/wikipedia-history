The team appeared in a total of 107 films between 1921 and 1951.\nPlot\nAn upstanding taxi driver unknowingly picks up a woman and her \"little person\"  accomplice, disguised as a baby, who are revealed to be criminals. Upon their departure without payment and leaving the meter running, the driver, Stan, pursues them onto a cruise ship where he uncovers their nefarious activities.\nThe tough Captain Bull is not pleased with the cabbie's presence, and growls  that Chester can either work his way across or be murdered. Chester is put under the supervision of Purser Cryder (Hardy), who usually ends up taking the blame for  the Cabbie's incompetence.\nChester suspects something is peculiar about the \"Baby\" when it cleans him out in a dice game. He angrily throws the \"Baby\" down a smokestack. Ordered to give the dirty \"Baby\" a bath, it is revealed to have a grown man's  hairy chest.\nKnowing the jig is up, the \"Baby\" takes a measure of revenge by beating up Purser Cryder.\nCast\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
