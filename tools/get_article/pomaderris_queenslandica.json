It is a shrub with woolly-hairy stems, egg-shaped to narrowly elliptic leaves, and panicles of creamy-yellow flowers.\nDescription\nPomaderris queenslandica is a shrub that typically grows to a height of  and has its stems covered with woolly, white, star-shaped hairs. Its leaves are egg-shaped to narrowly elliptic,  long and  wide. The upper surface of the leaves is glabrous and the lower surface is covered with whitish, woolly hairs. The flowers are creamy-yellow, borne at the ends of branchlets in panicles with egg-shaped bracts  long at the base, but that fall off as the flowers open. The sepals, floral cup and fruit are covered with long, silvery, and woolly, star-shaped hairs. Flowering occurs in spring and summer.\nTaxonomy\nPomaderris queenslandica was first formally described in 1951 by Cyril Tenison White in The Queensland Naturalist from specimens he collected at Back Creek, near Canungra in 1931.\nDistribution and habitat\nScant pomaderris grows in moist forest or the understorey of sheltered woodland in south-eastern Queensland and in scattered locations on the north coast and Northern Tablelands of north-eastern New South Wales.\nConservation status\nThis pomaderris is listed as of \"least concern\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992 but as \"endangered\" in New South Wales under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.\nReferences"
