The show premiered on Tuesday, October 12, 2010, at 10 p.m. EST on Comedy Central and ran for two seasons, with the final first-run episode airing November 16, 2011.\nOverview\nEach episode would begin with Swardson doing stand-up comedy on stage, in front of an audience at a comedy club.  He would tell jokes and discuss a topic which would be relevant to the episode.  This would usually be something random about himself or about the show.  The episode would then cut away to several pretaped sketches.\nThe show featured comedic sketches, such as Wheelchair Cat, a masturbating sniper, and a parody of Nightmare on Elm Street involving incest-related dreams.  Each episode from the first season included appearances from an animated character named Gay Robot, who originally appeared on Adam Sandler's comedy album ''Shh...Don't Tell''.  Gay Robot was voiced by Nick Swardson.\nAll of the episode titles were named after Nick's favorite line from each episode. For instance, in the season one finale, a house owner asks their guest if they know what the address of the house is, and the guest replies sarcastically with \"Um... I don't know... Blah Blah Blah Main Street?\" The latter part of the line was chosen as the title for the seventh episode of the first season.\nThe show was produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison Productions, and comedian Horatio Sanz was one of the producers.\nOn September 28, 2011, a 'Clip Show' episode was aired featuring the most popular skits from the first season.\nOn February 6, 2012, Swardson announced through his Facebook account that there would be no more episodes made.  Reruns of the show still air sporadically on Comedy Central.\nEpisodes\nSeason 1 (2010)\n| ShortSummary    = Nick dedicates the episode to his dead cat Fitzgerald.
