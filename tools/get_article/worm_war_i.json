It's a hybrid fixed shooter and vertically-scrolling game.\nGameplay\nThe game plays like a fixed shooter, with the player controlling a tank firing at giant worms. The tank auto scrolls up as the worms and blocks move down. Every time all the worms are wiped out, a new set spawns at the top of the screen. The pagoda can be shot to clear all the worms or rammed into by the tank to receive a fuel bonus.  There are 99 waves with each wave starting with one worm with six at the end of the wave.\nReferences\n;Other sources\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links"
