The event was held in memory of Eddie Graham, longtime promoter of the Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), the first held for Graham since the original Eddie Graham Memorial Shows in 1987-88. The event's title, in particular, was used as a homage to the popular Battle of the Belts supercards promoted by Graham during the 1980s. Mike Graham, Eddie's son and organizer of the original \"Eddie Graham Memorial Show\", opened for the show to speak about his father's legacy and introduced the FIP Florida Heritage Championship.\nThis version, unlike the previous memorial supercard, was held as a one-night 8-man single-elimination tournament. The first edition was held on March 10, 2007, at the National Guard Armory in Crystal River, Florida and which saw the winner, Erick Stevens being crowned the first-ever FIP Florida Heritage Champion. Dave Prazak and Lenny Leonard were commentators for the first show while Leonard was involved in booking for the second and final \"Battle of the Belts\". The inaugural show received generally positive reviews. Brad Garoon of 411mania.com rated the event an 8.5, calling it \"Stevens' coming out party\", and earned the website's \"Elite Award\".\nTournament winners\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Tournament\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Total won\n|-\n| || 2007 || Erick Stevens || 1\n|-\n| || 2009 || Davey Richards || 1\n|}\nShow results\nEddie Graham Memorial Battle of the Belts (2007)\nMarch 10, 2007 in Crystal River, Florida (National Guard Armory)\n|times=\n|match1=Roderick Strong defeated Jimmy Rave\n|stip1=First Round Tournament match\n|time1=09:02\n|match2=Jay Briscoe defeated Larry Sweeney\n|stip2=First Round Tournament match\n|time2=10:11\n|match3=Erick Stevens defeated SHINGO\n|stip3=First Round Tournament match\n|time3=02:12\n|match4=Delirious defeated Mark Briscoe\n|stip4=First Round Tournament match\n|time4=03:51\n|match5=Roderick Strong defeated Jay Briscoe\n|stip5=Semi Final Tournament match\n|time5=13:25\n|match6=Erick Stevens defeated Delirious\n|stip6=Semi Final Tournament match\n|time6=15:12\n|match7=The YRR (Chasyn Rance, Kenny King and Sal Rinauro) defeated Jerrelle Clark, Kory Chavis and Seth Delay\n|stip7=Six-man tag team match\n|time7=17:11\n|match8=Erick Stevens defeated Roderick Strong\n|stip8=Tournament Finals match\n|time8=21:16\n}}\nTournament brackets\nThis was a one-night tournament which took place on March 10, 2007.
