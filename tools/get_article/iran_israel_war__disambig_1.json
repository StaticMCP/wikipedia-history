The war began when Israel bombed military and nuclear facilities in Iran in a surprise attack, assassinating prominent military leaders, nuclear scientists, and politicians, killing civilians, and damaging or destroying air defenses. Iran retaliated with over 550 ballistic missiles and over 1,000 suicide drones, hitting civilian population centers, one hospital and at least twelve military, energy, and government sites. The United States intercepted Iranian attacks, and bombed three Iranian nuclear sites on 22 June. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at a US base in Qatar. On 24 June, Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire under US pressure.\nThe war followed a decades-long proxy war. Iran has called for Israel's destruction, and armed Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Following the October 7 attacks in 2023, both entered open conflict with Israel. In April 2024, Israel bombed Iran's consulate in Damascus, Syria, killing senior Iranian officials. Direct conflict continued in April and October.}}\nIran's nuclear program has caused international concern for over a decade. Israel considers it an existential threat. In 2015, under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), six countries lifted sanctions on Iran, which froze its nuclear program. In 2018, US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the plan. Iran began stockpiling enriched uranium and largely suspended International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring. The day before Israel attacked, the IAEA declared Iran non-compliant with its nuclear obligations in a resolution put forward by the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany.\nIran's nuclear facilities were extensively damaged.}} Other analysts and Israeli and Western officials said the delay was longer. Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA, which it said had passed information about nuclear facilities and scientists to Israel.\nIran's total death toll has been estimated at between 1,060 and 1,190; thousands were wounded, tens of thousands were displaced, and the government ordered internet blackouts. Israel struck a hospital, and high-rise buildings, including apartments. Iranian missiles struck military and government sites, apartments, a research center, and a hospital. Tightened censorship in Israel made the extent of physical damage unclear.\nThe International Commission of Jurists and some legal scholars said the Israeli strikes violated international law. The United Nations and most countries expressed concern and called for a diplomatic solution.}} Most countries,}} including most Muslim-majority and Arab states,}} condemned Israel's strikes. Other countries supported the strikes to prevent nuclear proliferation, and demanded Iran accept a nuclear deal.}}\nBackground\nIran–Israel conflict\nIsrael enjoyed a close relationship with the Pahlavi monarchy until the Iranian Revolution, when the monarchy was ousted and replaced by an anti-Western theocratic Islamic republic led by Ruhollah Khomeini. Ever since, Iran's government has repeatedly pledged to destroy Israel. Khomeini ended cooperation with Israel and denounced its occupation of Palestinian territories. As time passed, Iran tried to win Arab support by increasingly antagonizing Israel. Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has previously referred to Israel as a \"cancerous tumour\" and called for the country to be destroyed. Israel considers the Iranian nuclear program an existential threat, fearing that Iran will develop a nuclear weapon.\nIn 2024, the two countries attacked each other openly and directly for the first time following decades of proxy war. In April 2024, an Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus killed Iranian officers. Iran retaliated with strikes on Israel in April 2024, to which Israel then retaliated with strikes on Iran. In July 2024, Israel assassinated Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran's capital Tehran, and then assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and prominent IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan in Lebanon in September 2024. In October 2024, Iran struck Israel, and Israel struck Iran. The latter Israeli strikes destroyed Iran's Russian-supplied defensive S-300 missile system, paving the way for potential future Israeli strikes. Iranian authorities have refuted any claims of damage to the system.\nIranian nuclear program\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited Iran's nuclear program as the reason Israel preemptively struck Iran. Iran had consistently said that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes and that it has never intended to develop nuclear weapons. However, since 2019, it had repeatedly violated the terms of the previous nuclear deal of 2015, and in June 2025 the IAEA reported that Iran had acquired enough enriched uranium to produce nine nuclear warheads.\nThe country developed a covert nuclear weapons program named the AMAD Project in the 1980s and 1990s, which, according to US intelligence assessments, was suspended in 2003. According to the New York Times, based on documents extracted from a secure location in Iran, the country had been systematically preparing everything needed to produce nuclear weapons. In June 2025, the Independent referenced a source familiar with US intelligence reports who stated that there had been no \"recent changes\" to a previous US assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, and that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had not authorised a resumption of the AMAD Project.\nIn 2015, six countries negotiated with Iran the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal to lift sanctions on Iran and freeze Iran's nuclear program. In 2018, after being briefed on evidence that Iran sought to resume its nuclear weapons development, U.S. president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from and voided the deal – despite the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran was keeping to the deal. After the withdrawal Iran began stockpiling enriched uranium, and the IAEA lost the ability to monitor Iran's nuclear facilities.\nIn a letter addressed to the president of the UN Security Council, the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany (E3) stated that since 2019, Iran had \"increasingly and deliberately ceased performing its JCPOA commitments\", including \"the accumulation of a highly enriched uranium stockpile which lacks any credible civiliian justification and is unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons program,\"  a statement confirmed by the IAEA. The letter detailed additional Iranian violations of the agreement despite the fact that the E3 \"have consistently upheld their agreements under the terms of the JCPOA\".\nIn March 2025, US Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testified that the US intelligence community asseded that \"Iran is not building a nuclear weapon\". A month later, Trump announced negotiations between the US and Iran regarding Iran's nuclear program. The White House declared that Iran had two months to secure a deal, which expired the day before Israel's strikes.\nOn 31 May 2025, The IAEA issued a report in which it stated that Iran had enough Uranium enriched up to 60% for the production of nine nuclear weapons, and enough for additional weapons at lower enrichment levels.\nOn 12 June 2025, the IAEA board of governors passed a resolution, drafted by the US, UK, France and Germany, that declared that Iran was non-compliant with its nuclear obligations for the first time since September 2005. IAEA director general Rafael Grossi stated in an interview that the IAEA did \"not have any proof of a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon\", on the other hand, in his statement to the board of governors on June 9 he stated that \"Unless and until Iran assists the agency in resolving the outstanding safeguards issues, the Agency will not be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful\".\nAxis of Resistance\nIsrael has fought wars with Iranian proxies including against Hezbollah since the 1982 Lebanon War. In the October 7 attacks in 2023, Hamas, an Iranian proxy in Gaza, started the Gaza war, following which Israel severely weakened both Hamas and fellow Iranian proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon, while also attacking the Houthis in Yemen. This is said to have weakened Iranian deterrence and increased Iranian isolation.\nGaza war\nIsrael's strikes on Iran came against the backdrop of its ongoing war with Iran-aligned Hamas in Gaza and a broader escalation of its military actions across the region, including Israeli military activity in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and the occupied West Bank. They also came in the context of a risk of famine and humanitarian crisis in the Israeli blockaded Gaza Strip that a growing number of scholars and human rights organizations have described as a genocide.\nAnnouncement\nNetanyahu announced the launch of Operation Rising Lion, targeting Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz, its nuclear scientists, and parts of its ballistic missile program. He described Iran's nuclear efforts as \"a clear and present danger to Israel's very survival\", and said the operation would continue \"for as many days as it takes\".\nIn a speech announcing the attack, Netanyahu stated that for decades, Iran's leaders had openly called for Israel's destruction and warned that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon \"in a very short time. It could be a year. It could be within a few months, less than a year.\" He convened the security cabinet as the situation unfolded.\nTimeline\n13 June\n}}\nIn the early hours of 13June 2025, the IDF attacked dozens of Iranian nuclear facilities, military bases and infrastructure installations, and key military commanders. By 06:30&nbsp;IDT, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) had launched five waves of air strikes, using more than 200 fighter jets to drop more than 330 munitions on about 100 targets. Israeli targets included the Natanz Nuclear Facility and other infrastructure of Iran's nuclear program, with no nuclear accidents occurred as a result of the airstrikes. Meanwhile, the Mossad operatives along with commando forces sabotaged Iran's air defense systems and missile infrastructure. An Israeli official said the Mossad had smuggled precision weapons and established a covert drone base near Tehran, which were used to disable air defenses, securing air superiority for Israeli aircraft. The operations in the early hours, which killed 30 Iranian generals in minutes as well as nine nuclear scientists, are referred to as Operation Red Wedding and Operation Narnia.\nIn the afternoon, Israel conducted strikes in Tabriz in the early afternoon, reportedly targeting an area near Tabriz Airport. Explosions also occurred at the Hamadan Airbase the Parchin military base, and the subterranean Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. The IDF later confirmed striking the Hamadan and Tabriz airbases and the Isfahan Nuclear Technology/Research Center. Iranian media reported that at least two Israeli fighter jets were downed over Iranian airspace and a female pilot was captured. The IDF denied this.\nAfter the Israeli attack, Iranian leaders promised a \"harsh response\", with attacks against Israeli and US forces in military bases across the Middle East. Shortly thereafter, Iran launched missiles and drones at military bases and air bases under the codename Operation True Promise III. These included more than 100 Shahed drones, according to IDF Brigadier General Effie Defrin. The US evacuated some of its troops from in Iraq and also authorized the evacuation of family members of US troops across the region. Around 9p.m. IDT—10 minutes before dozens of missiles hit—Israeli citizens received phone alerts about an incoming attack. Some Iranian missiles hit targets in Tel Aviv including the Kirya military headquarters near Begin Road; others were shot down. Sirens were activated in Amman, Jordan's capital. Some drones were intercepted by the Royal Jordanian Air Force in Jordanian air space; some by the IAF over Saudi Arabia and Syria. Various Israeli sources said that an order for Israeli civilians to seek shelter was later lifted, suggesting that a majority or all of the drones were destroyed. An intercepted drone fell on a house and wounded three people in Irbid, Jordan.\nSeveral hours later, Iranian state media announced that accurate military and intelligence sites had been targeted in retaliation for earlier Israeli attacks on Iranian territory.\nAt least 63 Israelis were injured: one critically, one seriously, eight mildly, and the rest lightly, according to Magen David Adom. One civilian woman later died of her wounds. Seven soldiers were lightly injured. The Israel Fire and Rescue Services rescued two people from a building struck in Tel Aviv, while the IDF's Home Front Command rescued another civilian from a building in the city. The IDF estimated that around 150 ballistic missiles were fired in two waves during the attack, which did little damage. Al-Mayadeen reports that Iranian missiles struck a nuclear energy research facility in Tel Aviv. The Israeli military has prohibited the public from sharing photos and videos depicting the damage and destruction resulting from the Iranian missile attack. Elsewhere, The Houthis fired a ballistic missile from Yemen at Jerusalem. It landed in Sa'ir, West Bank, injuring five Palestinians, including three children.\n14 June\non 14 June 2025]]\nIn the early morning of 14 June, Iranian media reported an explosion and a fire at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport.

IRIB said that only Fordow's exit and entry tunnels were destroyed but not the facility itself. Later on, however, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi admitted that nuclear sites sustained severe damage. Although initial U.S. intelligence assessments indicated that the U.S. airstrikes did not destroy Iran's nuclear capability and only delayed it for a few months, the Pentagon has since concluded that it set back Iran by one to two years. Satellite images of Fordow facility were released by the Associated Press shortly after the strikes. The images showed damage to the entrances of the facility which are blocked by dirt, and also several large holes/craters in the mountain which the facility is under.\nPrior to the strikes, satellite images of the facility appeared to show increase in logistics, with multiple trucks/heavy machinery gathering near the site, suggesting a possible move of Iran's nuclear material.

Additionally, it is reported that the institute is collaborating with Israeli defense establishments. The strike wiped out a hub of cancer research that had international reach. Scientists report that \"everything inside was lost\", including \"irreplaceable samples\" from cancer patients from the United States, France, Switzerland, and other countries, decades‑old cell lines, cancer biomarker studies, and anti-cancer vaccinations research. Many other research labs were ruined by the attack, including the neuroscience lab. Among the lost research material, the most valuable scientifically was more than 2000 transgenic Drosophila lines, a tool for genetic research.\nOn 25 June, Israeli defense minister Katz signed an order to designate the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks as terrorist organizations because they were allegedly financing Iranian militant groups the day after the ceasefire agreement. He said that his move was made to target \"the heart of the Iranian regime's terror financing system, which funds, arms and directs terror throughout the Middle East\".\nAlthough most Iranian missiles launched at Israel during the war were intercepted, 36 are known to have directly impacted Israel, causing significant damage. Seven missiles struck oil and power facilities, and six hit five military and intelligence facilities, including the Tel Nof Airbase and Camp Glilot, which contains the main base of Unit 8200. The Wall Street Journal reported that in the final days of the conflict Israel's inventory of defensive missiles was depleting, raising concerns regarding the effectiveness of its long-range missile defense systems. Iran adapted its missile tactics during the 12-day conflict, increasing its success rate from 8% to 16% by using more advanced, longer-range missiles and varying attack patterns, exposing vulnerabilities in Israel's sophisticated missile defense systems. Iran's most effective strikes occurred on 22 June, when 10 out of 27 missiles hit Israel.\nThe true extent of damage caused by Iranian attacks is not known due to tight rules enacted by Israely military censorship. The Haifa refinery, the largest in Israel, was entirely shut down for two weeks and was not expected to reach full capacity until October, incurring a loss of around US $300 million. Central Bank Governor Amir Yaron told Bloomberg that the war with Iran had cost Israel about 20 billion shekels (US$5.9 billion), or about 1% of its gross domestic product.

On their return days later, multiple families reported extensive damage, filth and theft.\nA report from The Daily Telegraph, utilizing radar data from Oregon State University that monitors bomb damage in conflict areas through satellite images, revealed that Iranian missiles hit several important military sites with \"remarkable accuracy.\" These targets included the Tel Nof Airbase, the Gelilot intelligence base, and the Ziporit facility for armor and weapons manufacturing. In total, the Iranian missile attacks caused 28 deaths, destroyed 2,305 homes within 240 buildings, damaged two universities and one hospital, and forced over 13,000 Israelis to evacuate their homes.\nIn Iran\nCNN reported that Iranians as of 15 June were fleeing major cities in Iran.\nTasnim News Agency reported that Iranian authorities suspended flights at Imam Khomeini International Airport, although the facility itself was not directly affected by the attacks. Return flights were canceled for pilgrims in Saudi Arabia.\nAfter the initial attack, widespread internet outages were reported across major Iranian cities. According to the Guardian, Iran was fearful of Israeli online aggression and almost completely shut down the internet at one point during the war. Local sources told the Guardian that no one except journalists working for accredited foreign media outlets had access to the internet. A student in Tehran told the Guardian he felt \"walled in\", another said that the blackout limited citizens to using local apps, which the government might use \"to spy on us\". On 19 June, Iran blocked the internet for more than 12 hours according to NetBlocks. On 21 June, Iran International reported that according to Netblocks the internet was disconnected again. Digiato reported that citizens said they had no internet access.\nAuthorities told Iranians to delete WhatsApp over concerns regarding data gathered being shared with Israel.

He said that analyses show that the cost of the war for Israel has been an average of $3 billion per day.\nDiscussions with high-ranking officials from Israel's intelligence sector disclosed the methods employed in the attack, which integrated both human and artificial intelligence. \"This operation represents the culmination of extensive efforts by the Mossad aimed at undermining Iran's nuclear initiative,\" stated Sima Shain, a former director of research at Mossad. Israeli operatives covertly transported a number of drones and missile systems into Iran.\nIsraeli media indicates that the killings of Iranian military leaders and various Israeli actions stemmed from Israeli intelligence activities. Reports indicated that Mossad penetrated the Iranian security system and that Israeli intelligence operatives attempted to influence public sentiment via media assaults. The Iranian government instructed its officials to refrain from using Internet-connected smartphones because of data breaches.\nIranian nuclear program\nIran's uranium enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow were seriously damaged, according to Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and the IAEA. Experts consulted by The New York Times concurred that all of the working centrifuges at the sites were likely destroyed. The Isfahan research center, which could be involved in nuclear weapons development, was also damaged.\nBefore the war, the IAEA estimated that Iran's  stockpile of enriched uranium was enough for 10 nuclear bombs. The status and location of this stockpile is unclear. Based on pre-attack satellite imagery of trucks at nuclear sites, the IAEA and some Israeli and Western officials believe Iran may have evacuated it. Since Iran may have other locations where it can install centrifuges, the IAEA and many analysts, including Richard Nephew, concluded that the nuclear program was only set back by a few months. After a \"low confidence\" Defense Intelligence Agency assessment to this effect was leaked, a Pentagon spokesman said \"We have degraded their program by one to two years.\"\nCiting the extensive damage to nuclear sites and assassinations of key scientific personnel, the Institute for Science and International Security concluded that \"The time Iran would need to build even a non-missile deliverable nuclear weapon has increased significantly.\" Other Israeli and Western officials contended that Iran could not have easily moved its uranium stockpile and it was buried under the rubble of the attacked sites, so recovery attempts would be detected.\nNicholas Miller of Dartmouth College and Rosemary Kelanic of the think tank Defense Priorities suggested the war only strengthened Iran's ambition to achieve a nuclear deterrent, and began a \"cat and mouse game\". According to The New York Times, US intelligence had determined that entering the war would likely lead Iran to lift the 2003 fatwa against nuclear weapons.\nOn 23 June, the Iranian parliament approved an outline of a bill fully suspending Iran's cooperation with the IAEA, intending to block the installation of surveillance cameras, inspections, and the IAEA's receiving of reports. On 25 June, the parliament voted in favour of the bill, allowing the suspension to start.\nOn 2 July, Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the country to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, though the order included no timetables or details about what that suspension would entail. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the decision \"scandalous\" and urged the European nations which were part of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal with Iran to implement the \"snapback clause\", reimposing all UN sanctions. A team of IAEA inspectors left Iran on 4 July.\nReactions and responses\n}}\n: \"The Zionist enemy has made a big mistake, has committed a great crime, it must be punished and it is being punished, it has already been punished.\"]]\nIn Iran, after the initial wave of Israeli strikes, various authorities warned of a retaliation to follow. There were also local support for retaliation and trepidation as to what would follow. Diasporic figures were generally continuing their support for opposition to the government. Iran also claimed that Pakistan would use its nuclear weapons against Israel, should they be used on Iran. Pakistan denied this.\nIn Israel, Netanyahu stated that the strikes marked a pivotal moment claiming \"We are at a decisive moment in Israel's history\" and said would continue until the threat from Iran was neutralized.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz said, in response to Iran's initial attacks that it had crossed red lines by targeting civilians, and added that they will pay very heavy prices for that. Katz warned that \"Tehran will burn\" if Iran continues to fire missiles at Israel. IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir stated that the Israeli Army is \"mobilizing tens of thousands of soldiers and preparing across all borders,\" as he warned that \"anyone who tries to challenge us will pay a heavy price\" and that \"it was at point of no return\". Most Israelis supported Israeli strikes on Iran.\nIsrael's attacks prompted Reza Pahlavi, Maryam Rajavi and other diasporic Iranian opposition figures to call for the overthrow of the Iranian government. Some leaders of the Woman, Life, Freedom movement condemned the attacks, which they said did not help the Iranian opposition. Sepideh Qolian said that war will not bring democracy. Shirin Ebadi, Narges Mohammadi and Jafar Panahi called for an end to the war and condemned the attacks on civilians by both Israel and Iran. Mehrangiz Kar said: \"People are angry, and they hate the Islamic Republic. But they now probably hate Mr. Netanyahu and his military policies even more.\" University of South Florida political scientist Mohsen Milani said there was little evidence in Iran of the kind of opposition which could topple the Islamic republic.\nIn the United States, Trump said that he told Netanyahu to continue Israel's attack, but that the United States does not want a long term war, only to not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Trump praised the initial attacks and ordered support to Israel. He also threatened Iran's head of state would be an easy target for assassination. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had initially stated that Israel had \"acted independently,\" but that was later contradicted by Trump as having known about it. The US also moved jets and the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz to the region. Most Americans oppose a US military intervention in the war. Some of his supporters criticized Trump's support for Israeli strikes, and the possible involvement of the United States in the war. In a poll of Trump voters, 53% said the U.S. should not get involved in the Iran–Israel conflict.\nand Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine conduct a press briefing after the United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, 22 June 2025]]\nG7 leaders issued a statement at the 2025 G7 summit in Canada that read: \"We affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel. Iran is the principal source of regional instability and terror.\" UK prime minister Keir Starmer convened the national emergencies committee (COBRA) and said that \"Iran must never have a nuclear weapon\" and also that the UK prefers a \"diplomatic approach\".\nThe White House said that Trump would decide \"within two weeks\" whether to join Israel's war against Iran. United States special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi reportedly spoke by phone several times after the start of hostilities.\nIn Germany, German chancellor Friedrich Merz praised Israel's strikes and stated that Israel is \"doing the dirty work for us\" in Iran during an interview with ZDF. Merz also said the that the regime in Tehran has been weakened by Israel's attacks in the past few days and will probably not return to its former strength, making the future of the country uncertain. The Iranian government described the comments by Merz as \"shameful\", and summoned the German ambassador in response.\nMultiple prominent international organizations, such as the United Nations, condemned the attacks on both countries and called for a restraint and Israel to de-escalate. Several countries, such as China, Japan, Russia, and Turkey, condemned the Israeli attack on Iran and called for de-escalation. Trump rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to mediate a ceasefire in the Iran–Israel war, telling him to focus on mediating a ceasefire in the Russo-Ukrainian War.\nOpinion polling on Americans on US involvement in the war by YouGov found 85% of those surveyed were opposed to the war, while 5% supported and 10% were unsure of it.\nThe British Foreign Secretary declared that the Islamic Republic is the greatest threat to global security. Following the US strikes on Iran, Russia and China stated that the conflict risked globalization. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev proposed that Pakistan and Russia could give Iran nuclear warheads in response to the war. China also stated that the US attacks would further destabilize the region.\nIn a televised address that day, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu declared a \"historic victory\", stating that Israel had \"removed two immediate existential threats\", referring to Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile arsenal. Reports from the Institute for the Study of War and American Enterprise Institute revealed that moderate clerics and political elites were urging a ceasefire and even considering sidelining Khamenei if he did not accept. Iranian state television and pro-government outlets highlighted widespread public relief and celebratory mood across Tehran and other cities, depicting the ceasefire as an Iranian success and a signal of regional strength. According to The Economist, Israel has achieved a level of military dominance in the region that may surpass previous high points, including the aftermath of the 1967 Six-Day War.\nIn a prerecorded address released on 26 June, Khamenei warned the United States against future attacks. On 27 June, Iran accused Azerbaijan of allowing Israel to use its territory for drone attacks on Iran, a claim that Azerbaijan then rejected.\nIranian public opinion\nA survey conducted by GAMAAN at the end of September 2025, with over 30,000 Iranian participants, revealed their responses to the Iran-Israel war: 44% believe that the Islamic Republic is responsible for starting the war, while only 33% blame Israel. More than half (51%) think that Israel achieved its objectives, compared to only 16% who believe the Islamic Republic was successful. 42% expressed anger toward the Islamic Republic during the war. 63% believe that the war was between Israel and the Islamic Republic, not against the Iranian people. 58% responded that the Islamic Republic failed to protect the population. 58% gave a negative rating to the performance of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei during the war. 69% think that the Islamic Republic should stop calling for the destruction of Israel. 47% agree that to prevent another war, the Islamic Republic must stop uranium enrichment, while 49% oppose Iran developing nuclear weapons.\nMisinformation\nDuring the conflict, there were widespread psychological warfare and misinformation campaigns by both Israel and Iran. These campaigns made use of social media and AI tools to be \"more intense and more targeted than anything that had come before\". Roi Soussan of the Israeli fact-checking organisation FakeReporter said, \"What sets this war apart from others is that our researchers found clear narratives aimed at the Israeli public, and clear narratives aimed at the Iranians that are pretty similar\".\nBBC Verify reported on 21 June that \"a wave of disinformation has been unleashed online\" following Israel's strikes on Iran, including AI-generated videos that boasted of Iran's military capabilities. Pro-Palestinian social media accounts shared a video that falsely claimed to show an Israeli F-35 being shot down. It gained 21 million views, but the footage was actually from a flight simulator video game and was later removed by TikTok. The three most-viewed Iranian fake videos collectively gained 100 million views across multiple platforms.\nAccording to the CEO of Alethea analyst group, the surge in such content is linked to Russian influence networks that have shifted focus from undermining support for Ukraine to spreading doubt about the effectiveness of Western, especially American, military technology. She noted that since Russia lacks a direct counter to the F-35, it instead aims to weaken support for the aircraft through disinformation. Other analysts have noted that the large amount of disinformation marks the first time generative AI has been used at scale during a conflict. Pro-Israel social media accounts also circulated old clips of Iranian protests and gatherings, falsely claiming they showed increasing Iranian support for Israel's campaign.\nAfter Israel's 13 June strike, AI-manipulated video clips of Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, former IRGC commander-in-chief Mohsen Rezaee and Trump, aimed at depicting Pakistan as Iran's accomplice, were posted online and subsequently picked up by media outlets such as the Daily Mail, Indian adversarial media and Arab news networks. The Tehran Times posted a video generated using Veo that claimed to show destruction in Tel Aviv.\nGrok, an AI chatbot developed by xAI, falsely identified the fake videos as authentic footage of the war in some cases.\nShortly after the explosions occurred at Evin Prison, a video surfaced on X and Telegram featuring the hashtag \"#freeevin.\" The content of the posts and videos seemed to lack authenticity. According to the researchers, these videos were part of an \"Israeli ruse.\"\nFakeReporter uncovered an Iranian influence network of 3,000 Twitter accounts posing as Israelis expressing opposition to the war and blaming Benjamin Netanyahu.\nIn October 2025, a Citizen Lab report found that after the Israeli strikes on Evin prison, a network of 50 fake accounts on X (Twitter) purporting to be Iranian residents near the prison had posted AI-generated and/or manipulated content that called for people to storm the prison in the aftermath of the strikes as part of an anti-government uprising. Based in part on the high production value of one of the videos and the release shortly after the strikes, Citizen Lab concluded that the network was mostly likely either directly run by an Israeli government agency or through contractors with advance knowledge of the strikes. Haaretz also found that Israeli-funded networks also promoted the restoration of Reza Pahlavi to the Iranian throne during the war.\nAnalysis\nAnalysts and some human rights organizations such as Amnesty International stated that Israel's military escalation against Iran risked diverting international attention and investigations from accusations of genocide related to the Gaza war. According to analyst and Iran expert Ori Goldberg, \"If Netanyahu feels himself under threat [within Israel], he's going to want to crack the Iranian whip and unify people behind him.\"\nBamo Nouri, a lecturer in international relations, stated \"Israel emerges militarily capable but politically shaken and economically strained. Iran, though damaged, stands more unified, with fewer international constraints on its nuclear ambitions.\"\nAccording to data collected by Jewish Institute for National Security of America, the interception rate of Iranian missiles declined over time. Only 8% of Iranian missiles penetrated defenses in the first week of the war. This figure rose to 16% in the second half of the war and finally to 25% on the final day of the war, before the ceasefire. \"(Iran) increasingly employed more advanced systems,\" said Mora Deitch, head of the data analytics center at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). \"These included newer missiles with multiple warheads or decoys, which may individually cause less damage but can overwhelm and saturate air defense systems.\"\nIranian journalist Dorsa Jabbari, writing for Al Jazeera, stated that the United States was involved in \"deception\" before Israel attacked Iran, with the Americans claiming that nuclear talks with Iran would continue, despite secretly knowing that Israel was planning an attack.\nAnalysts contend that one potential method of retaliation by Iran could have involved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, an essential trade passage through which over 20 percent of the world's oil and a significant amount of liquefied natural gas transit each day. They assert that such a closure would impact global oil prices and lead to an increase in oil costs. Iran threatened to close the strait, but did not do so.\nSee also\n*\n* Iran's disclosure of confidential IAEA documents\n* Israel and weapons of mass destruction\n*\n* Operation Opera – Israeli attack on the Iraqi nuclear program in 1981\n* Operation Outside the Box – Israeli attack on the Syrian nuclear program in 2007\n*\n* Timeline of the nuclear program of Iran\n*\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links"
