Bhirrana is likely the oldest pre-Harappan neolithic site dating back to 7570-6200 BCE. Genome scientists, who used SNP analysis to identify mtDNA haplogroups, ascertained that the Bhirrana culture of India was dated to 9 tya (thousand year ago).\nSee also\n* Archaeological culture\n* Fabric analysis of pottery\n* Indian Pottery cultures\n* Pottery archaeology\n* 'Six fabrics of Kalibanagan' pottery\nReferences"
