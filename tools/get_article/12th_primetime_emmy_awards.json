The ceremony was held at the NBC Studios, in Burbank, California. It was hosted by Fred Astaire. All nominations are listed, with winners in bold and series' networks are in parentheses.\nThe ceremony's format was a sharp contrast to the previous year's. Several Acting categories were either combined or simply removed, and nearly every category had only three nominees, as opposed to the traditional five or six. Due to the relatively small crop of categories, no show received more than two major awards. The NBC anthology Startime received the most major nominations with five.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡).\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Art Carney Special (NBC)'\n** The Danny Thomas Show (CBS)\n** Father Knows Best (CBS)\n** The Jack Benny Show (CBS)\n** The Red Skelton Show (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'Playhouse 90 (CBS)'\n** DuPont Show of the Month (CBS)\n** The Moon and Sixpence (NBC)\n** Startime (NBC)\n** The Untouchables (ABC)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Fabulous Fifties (CBS)'\n** Another Evening with Fred Astaire (NBC)\n** The Dinah Shore Chevy Show (NBC)\n** The Garry Moore Show (CBS)\n** The Revlon Revue (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Huckleberry Hound Show (Syndicated)'\n** Captain Kangaroo (CBS)\n** Lassie (CBS)\n** Mr. Wizard (NBC)\n** Quick Draw McGraw (Syndicated)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Twentieth Century (CBS)'\n** CBS Reports (CBS)\n** Meet the Press (NBC)\n** Small World (CBS)\n** The VIII Olympic Winter Games (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Huntley–Brinkley Report (NBC)'\n** Chet Huntley Reporting (NBC)\n** Douglas Edwards with the News (CBS)\n** Journey to Understanding (NBC)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Robert Stack – The Untouchables as Eliot Ness (ABC)'\n** Richard Boone – Have Gun — Will Travel as Paladin (CBS)\n** Raymond Burr – Perry Mason as Perry Mason (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Jane Wyatt – Father Knows Best as Margaret Anderson (CBS)'\n** Donna Reed – The Donna Reed Show as Donna Stone (ABC)\n** Loretta Young – The Loretta Young Show as herself (NBC)\n|}\nSingle performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'Laurence Olivier – The Moon and Sixpence as Charles Strickland (NBC)'\n** Lee J.
