It was released on 3 October 2011 on the Big Dada label.\nCritical reception\n4everevolution was met with \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 75 based on 19 reviews.\nIn a review for AllMusic, critic reviewer Jon O'Brien wrote: \"4everevolution, shows he [Manuva] can still summarize the state of the nation more succinctly in one line that most MCs half his age manage over the course of an entire album. 4everevolution is an appropriately titled, subtle progression which proves that intelligent hip-hop and accessible urban pop don't have to be mutually exclusive.\" Reef Younis of Clash said: \"The production is crisp and varied; Roots' warm vocal typically hits with soul without being too forcefully firebrand and constant changes in style and tempo gives 4Everevolution the energy to see it through.\" At Drowned in Sound, Al Horner noted that it was Manuva's \"most assured and compelling listen to date.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n* Roots Manuva – primary artist, bass, violin\n* Harry Bennett – drums\n* Larry Blackmon – vocals\n* Hannah Caughlin – vocals\n* Mark Shaffer – guitar\n* Bob Earland – drums\n* Amazirée – vocals\n* Rokhsan – vocals\n* The Banana Klan – choir vocals\n'Production\n* Roots Manuva – mixing, producer\n* Bob Earland – engineer, mixing\n* Theo Gordon – engineer\n* Patrick McMahon – engineer, mixing\n* Kevin Metcalfe – mastering\n* Gibbs King – producer, engineer\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n!scope=\"col\"| Chart\n!scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| UK Albums (OCC)\n| 59\n|-\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
