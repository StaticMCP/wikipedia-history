Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them.\nOffice for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants\ns were held in a 3x5 meter trailer where the captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.]]\nFollowing the Supreme Court's ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants.\nScholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations:\n* Muktar Yahya Najee Al Warafi  was listed as one of the captives who \"The military alleges ... are associated with the Taliban.\"\n* Muktar Yahya Najee Al Warafi  was listed as one of the captives who \"The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad.\"\n* Muktar Yahya Najee Al Warafi  was listed as one of the captives who \"The military alleges ... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan.\"\n* Muktar Yahya Najee Al Warafi  was listed as one of the captives who \"The military alleges ... fought for the Taliban.\"\n* Muktar Yahya Najee Al Warafi  was listed as one of the captives whose \"names or aliases were found on material seized in raids on Al Qaeda safehouses and facilities.\"\n* Muktar Yahya Najee Al Warafi  was listed as one of the captives who was a foreign fighter.\n* Muktar Yahya Najee Al Warafi  was listed as one of \"36 [captives who] openly admit either membership or significant association with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or some other group the government considers militarily hostile to the United States.\"\n* Muktar Yahya Najee Al Warafi  was listed as one of the captives who had admitted \"to training at Al Qaeda or Taliban camps\".\nHabeas corpus\nIn 2015, Warafi's lawyers challenged his detention following a statement by President Barack Obama, that US involvement in hostilities in Afghanistan were over. They argued that the detention of individuals in Guantanamo was only valid while hostilities were ongoing.  On July 30, 2015, US District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that, without regard to the Obama's comment, hostilities were still ongoing in Afghanistan, so Warafi's detention remained legal.\nA court cannot look to political speeches alone to determine factual and legal realities merely because doing so would be easier than looking at all the relevant evidence. The government may not always mean what it says or say what it means.\nOne of Warafi's lawyers, Brian Foster, called Lamberth's opinion \"rubber stamp for endless detention\".\nFormerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment\nOn April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts.\nHis 8-page Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment was drafted on October 30, 2008.\nIt was signed by camp commandant Rear Admiral David M. Thomas Jr.\nHe recommended continued detention.\nTransfer to Oman\nWarafi was transferred to Oman with nine other individuals from Yemen:\nFahed Abdullah Ahmad Ghazi,\nSamir Naji al Hasan Moqbel,\nWaqas Mohammed Ali Awad,\nAbu Bakr Ibn Ali Muhhammad Alahdal,\nAbdul al Razzaq Muhammad Salih,\nMuhhammad Said Bin Salem,\nSaid Muhammed Salih Hatim,\nOmer Saeed Salem al Daini,\nFahmi Abdullah Ahmed.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/09/17/who-are-the-remaining-prisoners-in-guantanamo-part-two-captured-in-afghanistan-2001/ Who Are the Remaining Prisoners in Guantánamo?
