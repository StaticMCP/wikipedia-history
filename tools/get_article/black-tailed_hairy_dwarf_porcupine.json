It is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela.\nThis species was formerly sometimes assigned to Sphiggurus, a genus no longer recognized since genetic studies showed it to be polyphyletic. Its closest relatives are the frosted hairy dwarf porcupine (Coendou pruinosus), the brown hairy dwarf porcupine (Coendou vestitus) and the streaked dwarf porcupine (Coendou ichillus).\nReferences\n* [http://www.natureserve.org Natureserve.org]\nin Arizona.]]\n\n---\n\n## Black-tailed Hairy Dwarf Porcupine\n\n#REDIRECT Black-tailed hairy dwarf porcupine"
