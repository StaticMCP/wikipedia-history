The Society is a non-partisan, secular, learned society, not an activist lobby group and does not campaign on environmental or planning issues. The Society supports science and scientific endeavour through publication of scientific research, public seminars and other events and maintenance of a substantial scientific library.\nThe Society is a custodian of scientific tradition and aims to counter the ill-effects of over-specialisation in the academy and shallowness in public debate. Networking between scientists, government, business and the community is a primary activity.\nMembership is open to any person interested in the progress of science in Queensland. Although the membership includes a number of eminent and widely respected scientists and public intellectuals, the Society is neither elitist nor exclusive.\nThe Society hosts a Research Fund, established to sponsor research projects that escape the attention of the mainstream grant programs (such as those of the Australian Research Council). Donations are tax deductible under Australian taxation law.\nIn 2018 the Society established the Queensland Science Network as an unincorporated collaboration between more than 20 Queensland-focused community-based scientific and naturalists' organisations.\nIn 2019, the Society, along with co-organisers AgForce (peak body for broadacre agriculture) and NRM Regions Queensland (peak body for the regional natural resource management groups), organised a two-day Dialogue to examine how to transition the broadacre pastoral country (two-thirds of Queensland's area) to sustainability. The Dialogue produced a consensus [http://www.royalsocietyqld.org/rangelands-declaration/ Rangelands Declaration] and a shared commitment to engage in further regional consultations and policy analysis.\nThe records of the Society, including the digitised Minute Books, are held by the State Library of Queensland.\nPresidents\n{|\n| 1883–84 || Augustus Charles Gregory || Explorer, Surveyor, 1st Surveyor-General of Queensland ||\n|-\n| 1884–85 || Joseph Bancroft || Surgeon, Parasitologist ||\n|-\n| 1885–86 || Lewis Adolphus Bernays || public servant ||\n|-\n| 1886–87 || Albert Norton || Politician, Pastoralist ||\n|-\n| 1887–88 || Augustus Charles Gregory || Explorer, Surveyor ||\n|-\n| 1888–89 || Charles Walter De Vis || Biologist ||\n|-\n| 1889–90 || William Saville-Kent || Marine Biologist ||\n|-\n| 1890–91 || Frederick Manson Bailey || Botanist ||\n|-\n| 1891 || William Henry Miskin || Lawyer, lepidopterist ||\n|-\n| 1891–92 || Albert Norton || Politician, Pastoralist ||\n|-\n| 1892–93 || John Shirley|| Educationist and scientist ||\n|-\n| 1894 || Robert Logan Jack || Geologist ||\n|-\n| 1895 || Walter Taylor || Construction ||\n|-\n| 1896 || Joseph Lauterer || Biologist, Doctor, Ethnographer ||\n|-\n| 1897 || Charles Joseph Pound|| Microscopist, Bacteriologist\n|-\n| 1898 || Sydney Barber Josiah Skertchly || Geologist, Naturalist\n|-\n| 1899 || Joseph William Sutton || Engineer, Inventor ||\n|-\n| 1900 || John Thomson || Army surgeon and colonel ||\n|-\n| 1901 || William James Byram|| Lawyer, Poet ||\n|-\n| 1902 || John Thomson || unknown ||\n|-\n| 1903 || Wilton Wood Russell Love|| Medicine, Surgeon, Medical technologist ||\n|-\n| 1904 || John Cameron || unknown ||\n|-\n| 1905 || John Brownlie Henderson|| Analyst, Food Standards, Public Servant ||\n|-\n| 1906 || unknown || unknown ||\n|-\n| 1907 || Alfred Jefferis Turner || Paediatrician, Entomologist ||\n|-\n| 1908 || Johannes Christian Brunnich || Chemist ||\n|-\n| 1909 || John Frederick Bailey || Botanist ||\n|-\n| 1910 || William Robert Colledge|| Chemist ||\n|-\n|1911 || John Brownlie Henderson|| Analyst, Food Standards, Public Servant  ||\n|-\n| 1912 || Percy Leonard Weston|| Engineer ||\n|-\n| 1913 || Henry Caselli Richards || Geologist ||\n|-\n| 1914 || John Shirley|| unknown ||\n|-\n| 1915 || Thomas Harvey Johnston || Biologist, Parasitologist ||\n|-\n|1916 ||Ronald Hamlyn-Harris|| Entomologist ||\n|-\n| 1917 || Elliott Henry Gurney|| Agricultural Science, Public Servant ||\n|-\n| 1918 || Arthur Bache Walkom || Palaeobotanist, Museum director ||\n|-\n|1919\n|Albert Heber Longman\n|Naturalist, Museum Curator\n|-\n| 1920 || F.B.
