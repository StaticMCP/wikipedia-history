Electron microscope picture clearly shows a Multi-walled carbon nanotube, MWCNT.\n1970s\n* 1971 – M.L. Lieberman reports growth of three different graphitic like filaments; tubular, twisted, and balloon like. TEM images and diffraction data shows that the hollow tubes are multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT).\n* 1976 – A. Oberlin, Morinobu Endo, and T. Koyama reported CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) growth of nanometer-scale carbon fibers, and they also reported the discovery of carbon nanofibers, including that some were shaped as hollow tubes.\n* 1979 – Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel The Fountains of Paradise popularizes the idea of a space elevator using \"a continuous pseudo-one dimensional diamond crystal\".\n1980s\n* 1982 – The continuous or floating-catalyst process was patented by Japanese researchers T. Koyama and Morinobu Endo.\n* 1985 – Fullerenes discovered.\n* 1987 – Howard G. Tennent of Hyperion Catalysis issued a U.S. patent for graphitic, hollow core \"fibrils\".\n1990s\n* 1991\n** Nanotubes synthesized hollow carbon molecules and determined their crystal structure for the first time in the soot of arc discharge at NEC, by Japanese researcher Sumio Iijima.\n** August&nbsp;— Nanotubes discovered in CVD by Al Harrington and Tom Maganas of Maganas Industries, leading to development of a method to synthesize monomolecular thin film nanotube coatings.\n* 1992 – First theoretical predictions of the electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes by groups at Naval Research Laboratory, USA; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and NEC Corporation.\n* 1993 – Groups led by Donald S. Bethune at IBM and Sumio Iijima at NEC independently discover single-wall carbon nanotubes and methods to produce them using transition-metal catalysts.\n*  1995 – Swiss researchers are the first to demonstrate the electron emission properties of carbon nanotubes. German inventors Till Keesmann and Hubert Grosse-Wilde predicted this property of carbon nanotubes earlier in the year in their patent application.[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP0801805.html FIELD-EMISSION CATHODE AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING IT – Patent EP0801805]\n*  1997\n**  First carbon nanotube single-electron transistors (operating at low temperature) are demonstrated by groups at Delft University and UC Berkeley.\n**  The first suggestion of using carbon nanotubes as optical antennas is made in the patent application of inventor Robert Crowley filed in January 1997.\n* 1998 – First carbon nanotube field-effect transistors are demonstrated by groups at Delft University and IBM.\n2000s\n* 2000 – First demonstration proving that bending carbon nanotubes changes their resistance\n* 2001 April&nbsp;— First report on a technique for separating semiconducting and metallic nanotubes.\n* 2002 January&nbsp;— Multi-walled nanotubes demonstrated to be fastest known oscillators (> 50&nbsp;GHz).\n* 2003 September&nbsp;— NEC announced stable fabrication technology of carbon nanotube transistors.\n* 2004 March&nbsp;— Nature published a photo of an individual 4&nbsp;cm long single-wall nanotube (SWNT).\n* 2005\n** May&nbsp;— A prototype high-definition 10-centimetre flat screen made using nanotubes was exhibited.\n** August&nbsp;— University of California finds Y-shaped nanotubes to be ready-made transistors.\n** August&nbsp;— General Electric announced the development of an ideal carbon nanotube diode that operates at the \"theoretical limit\" (the best possible performance).
