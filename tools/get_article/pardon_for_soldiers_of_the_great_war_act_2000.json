      "text": "# Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act 2000\n\nPardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act 2000 is statute law in New Zealand. The act sought to remove the blight on their character of five soldiers who were unjustly executed during World War I. One of the pardoned soldiers named in the act was from New Zealand's southern port town of Bluff and he is now honoured in the town's maritime museum. The Act was opposed by the ACT party, which argued it was inappropriate and an insult to the memory of everyone who fought in the war.\nThe pardoned soldiers\nThey were all awarded medals posthumously, after the act was passed.\n* John (Jack) Braithwaite, PTE, b. 1882 in Dunedin.
