He is tasked with delivering the diamond to its rightful owner, the King's Bear, who lives in a remote and mysterious castle in the mountains.\nAlong the way, Agent Backkom encounters various obstacles and challenges, including the King's Bear's army of fierce animal guards and a treacherous traitor within his own team. Despite his clumsiness and lack of skills, Agent Backkom manages to overcome each challenge with his quick-thinking and unconventional methods.\nAs Agent Backkom arrives at the King's Bear's castle, he discovers a shocking truth: the King's Bear has been kidnapped by the criminal organization, and they are using the diamond as ransom. With the help of his team and the animal guards, Agent Backkom launches a daring rescue mission to save the King's Bear and retrieve the diamond.\nIn a thrilling climax, Agent Backkom faces off against the leader of the criminal organization and his henchmen in an epic battle. With his newfound courage and determination, Agent Backkom emerges victorious, saves the King's Bear, and returns the diamond to its rightful owner.\nRelease\nThe film was scheduled to be released in China in February 2020, but was not released due to COVID-19.
