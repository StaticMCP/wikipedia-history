Released in November 1994 by Food Records, it was the last single to be released from their third album, Parklife (1994). The song was written by the band and produced by Stephen Street, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart. It was considered a disappointment by Andy Ross of Food. Damon Albarn later stated that \"End of a Century\" may not have been the best choice for the album's fourth single, and that \"This Is a Low\" would have been a better alternative.\nLyrical content\nDamon Albarn stated that the song is about \"how couples get into staying in and staring at each other. Only instead of candle-light, it's the TV light.\" The opening line, \"she said there's ants in the carpet\", refers to an infestation of ants that Albarn and his then-girlfriend Justine Frischmann suffered in their then-home in Kensington. The lyrics seem to emphasise the then upcoming millennium change and the fact that people contemplate the future rather than take care of the present. Producer Stephen Street saw the song as \"Damon getting the art of songwriting really sorted\".\nCritical reception\nTerry Staunton from Melody Maker wrote, \"The fourth gem from Parklife in this, the year of the Blur. Forging the best bits of mid-era Beatles with wry Ray Davies observation, this has more charm than a lorryload of Lucy Claytons and should sound fantastic on the radio.\" Pan-European magazine Music & Media noted, \"In a fin-de-siècle mood Blur re-evaluates the roaring '60s with a great pop song that's a cross between Kinks and Small Faces-type of directness and Syd Barrett's cleverness.\" In a separate review, \"End of a Century\" was also described as \"'60s psychedelic pop with a touch of Syd Barrett\".\nMartin Aston from Music Week gave it a score of four out of five in his review of the single. Andrew Harrison from Select said it \"clambers over its ugly cousin to sum up Blur's amiable cynicism with a mournful trumpet and perhaps the most eloquent lines Damon's yet written: ''Another country?/It's nothing special.\" Pete Stanton from Smash Hits'' gave it a full score of five out of five and named it Best New Single, writing, \"'End of the Century' is the fourth tune off Parklife, and has their usual ingredients: switly start, sweet guitars, cockney vocals, big ending. I'm reaching for my old mod clobber right now.\"\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video for \"End of a Century\" is a live performance recorded at Alexandra Palace. As with their later video to \"Tender\", it uses the audio track of the live performance, rather than overdubbing the audio of the studio take.\nTrack listings\n* 7-inch and cassette single\n# \"End of a Century\" (Albarn, Coxon, James and Rowntree; lyrics by Albarn) – 2:47\n# \"Red Necks\" (Albarn, Coxon, James, Rowntree; lyrics by Coxon) – 3:04\n* CD and mini-CD single\n# \"End of a Century\" (Albarn, Coxon, James, Rowntree; lyrics by Albarn) – 2:47\n# \"Red Necks\" (Albarn, Coxon, James, Rowntree; lyrics by Coxon) – 3:04\n# \"Alex's Song\" (James) – 2:42\nPersonnel\n* Damon Albarn – lead vocals, organ\n* Graham Coxon – acoustic and electric guitars, clarinet, backing vocals\n* Alex James – bass guitar\n* Dave Rowntree – drums\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1994–1995)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 69\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40)\n| 2\n|-\n|-\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1995)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland (Íslenski Listinn Topp 40)\n| 29\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|7 November 1994\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Japan\n|21 December 1994\n|Mini-CD\n|\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia\n|27 February 1995\n|\n|Food\n|\n|}\nReferences"
