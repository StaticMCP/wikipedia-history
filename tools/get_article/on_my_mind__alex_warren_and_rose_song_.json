It was released on June 27, 2025, through Atlantic Records as the third single from Warren's debut studio album, ''You'll Be Alright, Kid (2025).\nBackground and release\nAfter releasing the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one hit \"Ordinary\" and its follow-up \"Bloodline\" with Jelly Roll in 2025, Alex Warren announced his debut studio album You'll Be Alright, Kid'' and its release date of July 18. On June 18, he teased the album's third single with a TikTok video of himself mouthing along to the song's lyrics overlaid with the text \"I promise you won’t guess who’s featuring on this…\" while Rosé peeks into the frame. She further commented on the post, \"can somebody tell me who that is.\" Warren also wrote in the post’s caption that it \"would be CRAZY if we drop it this month…\", hinting at the song's June release date. On June 20, the two officially confirmed their collaboration on the single \"On My Mind\", due for release on June 27. On June 23, Rosé posted a TikTok video of herself lip-syncing to a new snippet of the song captioned \"sorry @Alex Warren, i.. had to give them this part before it’s out on friday.\"\nComposition and lyrics\n\"On My Mind\" was written by Warren, Rosé, Alexander Izquierdo, John Ryan, and Joshua Coleman, with the latter two also provided with producer credits. It has been described to be a somber folk-pop and folk rock ballad characterized by its use of rhythmic acoustic guitar, horns, and kick drums. Lyrically, the song expresses the nostalgia of a relationship and the yearning for a loved one after a breakup.\nCritical reception\nRolling Stone Maura Johnston noted the song as an example of Warren's over-reliance on self-serious \"hoary post-grunge and stomp-and-holler folk-pop\", describing that the song's choruses \"don’t arrive as much as they explode\".\nMusic video\nDirected by Colin Tilley, an accompanying music video for \"On My Mind\" was released on June 27. Although Warren and Rosé filmed their scenes separately, the video utilized transitions and changes in point of view to pair them together. In one scene, Warren peers into a dollhouse with the camera zooming in to show Rosé inside. The point of view then shifts to hers, showing Warren as a giant through the window. The final shots use split screens of Warren and Rosé on opposite sides of a wall, giving the impression of them being neighbors in an apartment building.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for \"On My Mind\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Argentina Anglo Airplay (Monitor Latino)\n| 14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA)\n| 91\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Bolivia Anglo Airplay (Monitor Latino)\n| 10\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada CHR/Top 40 (Billboard)\n| 38\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Chile Anglo Airplay (Monitor Latino)\n| 17\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA)\n| 53\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Japan Hot Overseas (Billboard Japan)\n| 12\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lebanon (Lebanese Top 20)\n| 3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania Airplay (TopHit)\n| 29\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Netherlands (Single Tip)\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ)\n| 10\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Korea Download (Circle)\n| 38\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|}\nMonthly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Monthly chart performance for \"On My Mind\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2025)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania Airplay (TopHit)\n| 41\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Romania Airplay (TopHit)\n| 21\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Release dates and formats for \"On My Mind\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Format\n! scope=\"col\" | Label\n! scope=\"col\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Various\n| rowspan=\"2\" | June 27, 2025\n|\n| Atlantic\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Italy\n| Radio airplay\n| Warner Italy\n| style=\"text-align:center\" |\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | United States\n| June 30, 2025\n| Adult contemporary radio\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Atlantic\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|July 1, 2025\n|Contemporary hit radio\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n|}\nReferences"
