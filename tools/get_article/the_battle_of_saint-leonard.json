The film profiles the late 1960s political controversy in Saint-Léonard, Quebec, when Italian Canadians and pure laine francophone Quebecers found themselves in deep conflict over education reform proposals that would have eliminated bilingual Roman Catholic schools and provided all Catholic education exclusively in French.\nThe film premiered theatrically on October 11, 2024.\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n!
