The crew members soon begin to turn on one another, in spite of Brandt's attempts to convince them to come together under times of stress. However, she too begins to break, devastating fellow crew member Katherine Langford. One crewman, Jerry Pierson, goes crazy and starts rambling that they are being watched, but the other crewmen do not believe him. Later on, he is seemingly killed just as the crew successfully land on Mars. It is later revealed that Jerry had been taken away by aliens and that he was correct: aliens have been monitoring the crew trying to determine if they are worth saving and if humanity were better off if his ideas were to happen.\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Miller (Commander) (no first name given)Billy (Co-pilot) (no last name given)\n|The Edge (2020), short film\n|NASA:Edge-124\n|2050\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|First two astronauts to fly to Mars; meteoroid impact causes them to crash on distant planet.
