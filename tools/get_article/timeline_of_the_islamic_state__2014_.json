Raqqa in Syria became its headquarters. The Wall Street Journal estimated that eight million people lived under its control in the two countries.\nIn June the group proclaimed a \"worldwide caliphate\" and shortened its name to just \"Islamic State\" (IS).\nTimeline\nJanuary 2014\n* 3 January: ISIL proclaims itself as an Islamic state in Fallujah. After prolonged tensions, the newly formed Army of Mujahedeen, the Free Syrian Army and the Islamic Front launched offensives against ISIL in the Syrian provinces of Aleppo and Idlib. These groups, proclaiming a \"second revolution\", attacked ISIL in many village areas, attacking up to 80% of those in Idlib and 65% in Aleppo.\n* 4 January: Fallujah was captured by ISIL after several days of fighting which left more than 100 dead.

The Turkish Army retaliated with Panter howitzers and destroyed the ISIL convoy. Iraqi forces and their tribal allies recaptured Albu Farraj and Al-Nasaf near Ramadi.\n* In late January, Haji Bakr, ISIL's then second-in-command, was reported to have been assassinated by Syrian militants. Haji Bakr had previously been head of al-Qaeda's military council and a former military officer in Saddam Hussain's army. They were unaware that they had killed the strategic head of the group calling itself \"Islamic State\".\nFebruary 2014\n* 3 February: al-Qaeda's general command broke off its links with ISIL, reportedly to concentrate the Islamist effort on unseating President Bashar al-Assad.\n* By mid-February, al-Nusra Front had joined the battle in support of rebel forces, and expelled ISIL forces from the Deir ez-Zor province in Syria.\n* 19 February: An ISIL leader, Abd Khaliq Mahedi, surrendered to the Chairman of Sons of Iraq Council, due to disagreement with other ISIL leaders on the killing of Iraqi soldiers and bombing of civilian houses.\n* 23 February: ISIL carried out a suicide attack in Aleppo, killing a commander of Ahrar ash-Sham (Abu Khalid al-Suri) and six other members of the group.\n* 28 February: The pro-government Sunni tribal Sheikh and councilman, Fleih al-Osman, and six of his men were killed by a suicide bomber in Haditha.\nMarch 2014\n* By March, ISIL forces had fully retreated from Syria's Idlib province after battles against the Syrian rebels.\n* 4 March: ISIL retreated from the Turkey border town of Azaz and nearby villages, choosing instead to consolidate around Raqqa, in anticipation of an escalation of fighting with al-Nusra.\n* 8 March: Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki accused Saudi Arabia and Qatar of openly funding ISIL.\n* 15 March: The number of internally displaced persons in Al Anbar Governorate, especially from Fallujah and Ramadi, reached 300,000.

Two Azerbaijanis were arrested.\nApril 2014\n* 16 April: ISIL is reported to have killed Abu Muhammad al Ansari, the Al-Nusra Front emir of Idlib province, Syria. The ISIL assassination team killed his wife, his 2 children, and both of his brothers, who were in his house.\n* 27 April: Iraqi helicopters reportedly destroyed an ISIL convoy inside Syria. This may be the first time that Iraqi forces have struck outside their country since the Gulf War.\nMay 2014\n* 1 May: ISIL carried out a total of seven public killings in the city of Raqqa in northern Syria.
