      "text": "# 1991 Minnesota Vikings season\n\nThe 1991 season was the Minnesota Vikings' 31st in the National Football League. They finished with an 8–8 record, improving on their 6–10 record from the previous season, but missed the playoffs for the second straight year. Head coach Jerry Burns retired at the end of the season.\nHerschel Walker, going into his third year with Minnesota, went through another season of frustration and he was released following the season. In his two-and-a-half seasons with the Vikings, he failed to record a 1,000-yard season. The infamous trade that brought Walker to Minnesota never lived up to expectations and allowed the Dallas Cowboys to use two of the draft picks they received in the trade on Emmitt Smith and Darren Woodson, who became part of a dominant team that won three Super Bowls in the 1990s.\nOffseason\n1991 draft\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|style=\"background-color:lightsteelblue;border:1px solid #aaaaaa;width:2em\"|\n|Pro Bowler\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\" style=\"\"| 1991 Minnesota Vikings Draft\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Draft order\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Player name\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Position\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| College\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\"| Notes\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Round\n!style=\"\"| Selection\n|-\n! 1 || 11\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Dallas Cowboys\n|\n|-\n! 2 || 38\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Dallas Cowboys\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 3 || 65\n| Carlos Jenkins || Linebacker || Michigan State ||\n|-\n! 68\n| Jake Reed || Wide receiver || Grambling State || From Cowboys\n|-\n! 4 || 92\n| Randy Baldwin || Running back || Ole Miss ||\n|-\n! 5 || 119\n| Chris Thome || Center || Minnesota ||\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 6 || 146\n|colspan=\"3\"| Traded to the Los Angeles Raiders\n|\n|-\n! 163\n|bgcolor=lightsteelblue| Todd Scott || Safety || Southwestern Louisiana || From Raiders\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| 7 || 179\n| Scotty Reagan || Defensive tackle || Humboldt State ||\n|-\n! 180\n| Tripp Welborne || Safety || Michigan || From Cowboys, via Raiders\n|-\n! 8 || 206\n| Reggie Johnson || Defensive end || Arizona ||\n|-\n! 9 || 232\n| Gerald Hudson || Running back || Oklahoma State ||\n|-\n! 10 || 259\n| Brady Pierce || Offensive tackle || Wisconsin ||\n|-\n! 11 || 286\n| Ivan Caesar || Linebacker || Boston College ||\n|-\n! 12 || 313\n| Darren Hughes || Wide receiver || Carson–Newman ||\n|}\nDraft trades\nStaff\nRoster\n|Running Backs=\n|Wide Receivers=\n|Tight Ends=\n|Offensive Linemen=\n|Defensive Linemen=\n|Linebackers=\n|Defensive Backs=\n*  Reggie Rutland  CB\n|Special Teams=\n|Reserve Lists=\n|Practice Squad=\n}}\nPreseason\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"\"| Week\n!style=\"\"| Date\n!style=\"\"| Opponent\n!style=\"\"| Result\n!style=\"\"| Record\n!style=\"\"| Venue\n!style=\"\"| Attendance\n|-\n! 1\n|\n| at New Orleans Saints\n| L 21–24\n| 0–1\n| Louisiana Superdome\n| 58,953\n|-\n! 2\n|\n| Pittsburgh Steelers\n| W 34–24\n| 1–1\n| Hubert H.
