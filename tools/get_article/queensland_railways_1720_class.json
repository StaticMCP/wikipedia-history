They operated throughout Queensland on branchline freight, suburban and mainline passenger services and on shunting duties. Later they were modified for driver only operation receiving a larger windscreen and an air conditioning box along with the D symbol added to the end of the locomotive number to indicate driver only operation.\nSome have been exported, although the majority as at January 2014 remain in service. Unit 1741 was acquired for preservation by the Queensland Diesel Restoration Group in October 2016. As of June 2025, it is currently on the Zig Zag Railway in Clarence, NSW where it has been refurbished for use on their heritage railway.\nGallery\nReferences"
