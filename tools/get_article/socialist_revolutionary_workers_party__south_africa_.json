The party was founded in March 2019 after a pre-launch convention at the end of 2018.\nHistory\nThe roots of the SRWP lie in the split between the NUMSA union and the COSATU federation in 2013. The split was mainly caused by the growing discontention of the NUMSA leadership with the ANC, which is supported by the COSATU through the Tripartite Alliance, together with the South African Communist Party. After the split NUMSA general-secretary Irvin Jim announced the formation of a \"a new united front\". Together with the new SAFTU, the SRWP would be part of this new united front.\nThe launch in December 2018 was attended by 1,100 delegates from all provinces of South Africa in Boksburg, with delegations from residence associations and members of SAFTU unions in attendance. The party contested in the 2019 South African general election and the provincial elections in all nine provinces, failing to win any seats.\nThe party has not contested the 2024 election, and has shown little activity since 2022.\nElection results\nNational elections\n|-\n!
