The primaries, were held in numerous U.S. states on various dates from early spring into early summer of 2020, and featured elections publicly funded, concurrent with the Democratic Party and Republican Party primaries, and elections privately funded by the Green Party, held non-concurrently with the major party primaries.\nThere were 357 out of a possible 358 delegates elected to the Green National Convention, which took place over July 9 to July 12. A candidate needed a simple majority of these delegates to become the Green Party's nominee in the 2020 presidential election.\nHowie Hawkins became the presumptive nominee on June 20 after passing the simple majority of delegates needed to win the nomination. Hawkins was nominated as the Green Party's presidential candidate on July 11.\nBackground\nFormer nominees\nThe former Green Party presidential nominees, in chronological order, are consumer advocate Ralph Nader, political activist David Cobb, congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, and political activist Jill Stein. Both Nader and Stein received the nomination for president twice from the Green Party. The former vice presidential nominees of the Green Party are environmentalist and economist Winona LaDuke, political activist Pat LaMarche, organizer and hip-hop activist Rosa Clemente, National Coordinator of the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign Cheri Honkala, and human rights activist Ajamu Baraka. In 2016, LaDuke became the first Native American woman and Green Party member to receive an Electoral College vote for vice president.\nThe vice presidential nominees from the preceding 2016 and 2012 elections, Baraka and Honkala respectively, endorsed Howie Hawkins for president.\nCandidates\nThis section lists candidates that have at some point been considered active by the party's Presidential Campaign Support Committee. Holding an active status does not mean the candidate has received official recognition from the party.\nOn July 24, 2019, the Green Party of the United States officially recognized Howie Hawkins' campaign. Nearly a month later, Dario Hunter's campaign was also recognized. In February 2020, David Rolde's campaign met the requirements for recognition.\nThe remaining candidates did not obtain formal recognition by meeting the established criteria by the party's Presidential Campaign Support Committee.\nPopular vote counts presented here are incomplete, as many states have reported their delegates but not the corresponding popular vote.\nCandidates\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding:10px; width:120px; \" | Candidate\n! style=\"width:300px;\"  class=\"unsortable\" | Experience\n!
