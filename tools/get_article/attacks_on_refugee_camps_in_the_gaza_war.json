At the time of the attack, the market was full, with customers and vendors stocking up on goods. The airstrike hit the al-Trans area of the Jabalia market, one of the most populated areas of Jabaliya. Survivors of the attack, speaking to France 24, stated that the airstrike \"hit in the heart of the market\", and in the immediate aftermath, there were many dead. Many of the bodies were unable to be recovered in the days following the airstrike, due to a lack of equipment.\nA rescue worker speaking to the New York Times stated that the death toll was over sixty, and the entire market and surrounding buildings were destroyed. Gaza's health ministry declined to give a full estimate, but reported \"dozens\" of dead and wounded. Gaza's interior ministry also claimed that the airstrike initially targeted a residential building belonging to the Abu Eshkayyah family.\nThe Israeli government claimed that the Jabalia airstrike targeted elements of Hamas located in a mosque in the Jabalia camp. Amnesty International investigated the airstrike in its report on the Gaza genocide. The report said there was no evidence of a military objective and that the \"Israeli military made contradictory remarks and failed to substantiate\nthem.\" The Amnesty report concluded the strike was a likely war crime.\nOn 12 October, a second airstrike on the Jabalia camp hit a residential building, destroying several apartments, and killing people from two families. Gaza's Interior Ministry reported 45 people were killed, and at least four others injured. Some were sheltering there after being displaced from Beit Hanoun.\nOn 19 October, the camp was hit by a third airstrike, killing 18 refugees. On 22 October, the camp was bombed for a fourth time during a particularly intense bombardment of Gaza. Multiple homes were bombed and at least 30 bodies have been recovered from the rubble.\n31 October\nOn 31 October, the camp was bombed again by Israeli fighter jets. The IDF said the attack was meant to target a key leader of the 7 October attacks Ibrahim Biari, as well as a \"vast underground tunnel complex\" beneath the camp that according to the IDF Biari was commanding operations from. Hamas denied the presence of any commander and said Israel was using these claims as an excuse for the attack.\nAn eyewitness interviewed by CNN spoke of \"apocalyptic scenes\":\nAtef Abu Seif, Minister of Culture of the Palestinian Authority of President Mahmoud Abbas and a well-known critic of Hamas, likewise spoke of \"apocalyptic\" scenes to Der Spiegel, saying more than 50 houses were \"smashed, crushed. In each house there were dozens of people, families and relatives who had fled here from outside because their areas were bombed ... They bombed the center, the heart of the refugee camp. No place in all of Palestine is probably as densely populated as this. Now we can't even make out where which building began and ended.\"\nAl Jazeera reporter Anas Al Shareef was on the scene, stating, \"It's a massive massacre. It is hard to count the number of buildings that have been destroyed here.\" Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, described the scene as \"absolutely horrific\". More than a hundred people were reported missing beneath the rubble. The Gaza Interior Ministry stated the camp had been \"completely destroyed\", with preliminary estimates of about 400 wounded or dead. The director of the Indonesia Hospital reported more than 50 dead.\nIDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari confirmed that Israeli fighter jets attacked the refugee camp.

The Civil Defense in Gaza described the airstrike as a \"second massacre\" which destroyed several buildings surrounding the camp and killed at least 80 people and wounded hundreds more. The IDF said the strike killed \"the head of [Hamas's] anti-tank missile unit, Muhammad A'sar\".\nOn 2 November, another airstrike in the Jabalia refugee camp hit the UNRWA-sponsored Abu Hussein school, home to many displaced Gazans.\nAl-Fakhoora school\nOn 4 November, a UNRWA spokeswoman confirmed reports that Israel had conducted another airstrike against a UN-run school in the Jabalia refugee camp. According to the Gaza health ministry, the attack on the Al-Fakhoura school killed fifteen and wounded dozens more. Reuters reported having obtained a video of a boy crying in despair: \"I was standing here when three bombings happened, I carried a body and another decapitated body with my own hands. God will take my vengeance.\" According to UNRWA, at least one strike hit the schoolyard where displaced families had set up their tents. In response to the strike, Al Jazeera remarked Israel was \"trying to eliminate all sources of survival for the civilian population to force the evacuation to the southern part of Gaza.\"\nA second airstrike on the school occurred in the early hours of the morning on 18 November. Journalists on the scene reported dead bodies everywhere, suggesting the strike may have been an Israeli message to civilians to flee to the southern Gaza Strip.
