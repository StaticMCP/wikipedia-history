It was there that he discovered chemistry and chose to apply to the University of Southampton where he won a First Class Honours degree.  He gained his D.Phil. from the University of Sussex.\nHe became a lecturer in Chemistry in William Klyne’s department at Westfield College, University of London. Professor Klyne was writing a book on organic stereochemistry for Chapman & Hall and John’s expertise and attention to detail made him the ideal co-author. So the Atlas of Stereochemistry was published in 1974 to great reviews, with two subsequent volumes following a few years later.\nJohn’s skills were recognized by the managing director at Chapman & Hall, Richard Stileman, who then engaged him on a full-time basis to prepare a new edition of the Heilbron’s [https://www.crcpress.com/Dictionary-of-Organic-Compounds-Sixth-Edition-Nine-Volume-Box-Set/Buckingham-Macdonald/9780849300073 Dictionary of Organic Compounds (DOC)]. This was a multi-volume reference work which needed bringing into the modern world with significant amendments required for the fifth edition. John was pivotal in converting the DOC into a database, and this now forms the basis of the modern DOC and its related dictionaries.\nOnce the DOC was published, John’s attention turned towards the chemistry of natural products such as alkaloids including strychnine and morphine, taxol. John had the foresight to anticipate the tremendous growth in natural products research and its relevance to the modern drug industry. His expertise with deciphering chemical literature and organising natural products by structure, coupled with his unflagging energy and enthusiasm, culminated in the publication of the Dictionary of Natural Products. This heralded a new phase of publishing with electronic products very much at the forefront. The CD ROM version of the Dictionary was published in 1991, two years before the book was published. It continues to be updated twice a year and John continued working on it full-time until the end. As Fiona Macdonald, the current editor of the Dictionary commented in a eulogy at his [http://www.stbrides.com/news/2015/11/john-buckingham-memorial.html memorial service]: \"No other publication has ever achieved the breadth and depth of the Dictionary of Natural Products and today it is widely regarded as the benchmark in natural product information. John was very proud of its success and it truly is his life’s work and his legacy.\"\nBuckingham also wrote two books for the general reader which covered chemical subjects. These are Chasing the Molecule, about the development of Chemistry as a science and Bitter Nemesis, the story of strychnine's introduction to Europe, its adoption first as a medicine, and later as a poison. In Chapter 16, Bitter Nemesis, he opens with the First World War to lead into a retelling of \"a plot, now widely forgotten, to assassinate Lloyd George and Arthur Henderson, Leader of the Labour Party and member of the War Cabinet\". Before publication there were several history sources, newspaper and media reports pointing to the likelihood that the plot was a fabrication of the undercover agent who was kept out of the trial of Alice Wheeldon and her family, and that the trial was unsafe.\nJohn Buckingham is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London, United Kingdom.\nNotable works\n* Atlas of Stereochemistry: Absolute Configurations of Organic Molecules.
