      "text": "# List of United States presidential vetoes\n\nIn the United States, the term \"veto\" is used to describe an action by which the president prevents an act passed by Congress from becoming law. This article provides a summary and details of the bills vetoed by presidents.\nVeto procedure\nAlthough the term \"veto\" does not appear in the United States Constitution, Article I requires each bill and joint resolution (except joint resolutions proposing a constitutional amendment) approved by the Congress to be presented to the president for his approval. Once the bill is presented to the president, there are several scenarios which may play out:\n* The president may sign the bill into law within ten days (excluding Sundays).\n* The president may veto the bill by returning it to Congress with a statement of objections within ten days (excluding Sundays). If the president vetoes a bill, the Congress shall reconsider it (together with the president's objections), and if both houses of the Congress vote to pass the law again by a two-thirds majority of members voting, then the bill becomes law, notwithstanding the president's veto. (The term \"override\" is used to describe this process of overcoming a presidential veto.)\n* If the president does nothing with the bill (neither signing it nor returning it to Congress with objections) and Congress does not by its adjournment prevent the bill's return, then the bill becomes law after ten days (excluding Sundays).\n* If the president does nothing with the bill and before the tenth day (excluding Sundays) Congress has adjourned in such a way as to prevent the bill being returned, then the bill expires and does not become law. The term \"pocket veto\" is used to describe this practice. Pocket vetoes cannot be overridden, so if the Congress still wants the piece of legislation enacted, a new bill must be introduced and passed (at which point it would again be subject to a veto). Doubt has existed as to which recesses and adjournments allow for pocket vetoes. In the modern practice, the clerk of the House and the secretary of the Senate are authorized to receive veto messages during both intrasession and intersession recesses and adjournments, so pocket vetoes are only possible after the adjournment sine die of the final session of a Congress.\nAlthough each case is different, one general rule can be acknowledged: presidents use their prerogative to veto legislation when such legislation does not represent their viewpoint or agenda.\nOccasionally, a president either publicly or privately threatens Congress with a veto to influence the content or passage of legislation. There is no record of what constitutes a \"veto threat\" or how many have been made over the years, but it has become a staple of presidential politics and a sometimes effective way of shaping policy. A president may also warn Congress of a veto of a particular bill so as to persuade Congress not to waste time passing particular legislation or including certain provisions in a bill when the president is prepared to veto it.\nSummary\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders sticky-header\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!#\n! scope=\"col\" | President\n! scope=\"col\" | Regularvetoes\n! scope=\"col\" | Pocketvetoes\n! scope=\"col\" | Totalvetoes\n! scope=\"col\" | Vetoesoverridden\n! scope=\"col\" | % of total vetoesoverridden\n! scope=\"col\" | % of regularvetoes overridden\n|-\n!1\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 2|| 0 || 2 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!2\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || – || –\n|-\n!3\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || – || –\n|-\n!4\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 5 || 2 || 7 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!5\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!6\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || – || –\n|-\n!7\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 5 || 7 || 12 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!8\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!9\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || – || –\n|-\n!10\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 6 || 4 || 10 || 1 || 10% || 16%\n|-\n!11\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 2 || 1 || 3 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!12\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || – || –\n|-\n!13\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || – || –\n|-\n!14\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 9 || 0 || 9 || 5 || 56% || 56%\n|-\n!15\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 4 || 3 || 7 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!16\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 2 || 5 || 7 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!17\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 21 || 8 || 29 || 15 || 52% || 71%\n|-\n!18\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 45 || 48 || 93 || 4 || 4% || 9%\n|-\n!19\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 12 || 1 || 13 || 1 || 8% || 8%\n|-\n!20\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || – || –\n|-\n!21\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 4 || 8 || 12 || 1 || 8% || 25%\n|-\n!22\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 304 || 110 || 414 || 2 || 1% || 1%\n|-\n!23\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 19 || 25 || 44 || 1 || 2% || 5%\n|-\n!24\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 42 || 128 || 170 || 5 || 3% || 12%\n|-\n!25\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 6 || 36 || 42 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!26\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 42 || 40 || 82 || 1 || 1% || 2%\n|-\n!27\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 30 || 9 || 39 || 1 || 3% || 3%\n|-\n!28\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 33 || 11 || 44 || 6 || 14% || 18%\n|-\n!29\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 5 || 1 || 6 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!30\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 20 || 30 || 50 || 4 || 8% || 20%\n|-\n!31\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 21 || 16 || 37 || 3 || 8% || 14%\n|-\n!32\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 372 || 263 || 635 || 9 || 1% || 2%\n|-\n!33\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 180 || 70 || 250 || 12 || 5% || 7%\n|-\n!34\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 73 || 108 || 181 || 2 || 1% || 3%\n|-\n!35\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 12 || 9 || 21 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!36\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 16 || 14 || 30 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!37\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 26 || 17 || 43 || 7 || 16% || 27%\n|-\n!38\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 48 || 18 || 66 || 12 || 18% || 25%\n|-\n!39\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 13 || 18 || 31 || 2 || 6% ||15%\n|-\n!40\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 39 || 39 || 78 || 9 || 12% || 23%\n|-\n!41\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 29 || 15 || 44 || 1 || 2% || 2%\n|-\n!42\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 36 || 1 || 37 || 2 || 5% || 6%\n|-\n!43\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 12 || 0 || 12 || 4|| 33% || 33%\n|-\n!44\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 12 || 0 || 12 || 1|| 8% || 8%\n|-\n!45\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 10 || 0 || 10 || 1 || 10% || 10%\n|-\n!46\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 13 || 0 || 13 || 0 || 0% || 0%\n|-\n!47\n! scope=\"row\"|\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || – || –\n|-\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n!\n!
