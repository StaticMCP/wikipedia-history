The Drama Club owns and runs the property, which is primarily used for rehearsing forthcoming productions, although also includes:\n*A workshop for building theatre sets\n*An extensive costume and props store\n*A conference meeting room\n*Lighting and sound facilities\n*A kitchen\nHistory\nThe Warehouse Theatre started out in the 1930s being the main coal storage for the local Devenish Brewery, located in Hope Square, Weymouth.\nWhen the brewery stopped mass-brewing in 1990 the building was redundant until the Weymouth Drama Club came along in 1993. After a good cleaning effort, the space was made available for rehearsal and now holds an extensive costume store that is available for hire to the public, as well as a props store, workshop and lighting and sound facilities.\nThe building is available for hire to local customers, but is primarily used for rehearsing forthcoming Drama Club productions. Although the organization is an Amateur Dramatic one, many professionals lend their advice and skills. There are also several social events that occur during the month\nThe Club strive to maintain the original character of the building, while maintaining an up-to-date multi-purpose facility. Fundraising events are held at the Warehouse to maintain the upkeep of the space, and also to fund the Drama Club's productions. The club recently completed a campaign to buy new seating for productions.
