They refused and then wisely fled to the mountains, from where they joined 280 Cora Indians loyal to Madero. Holmdahl, the seven officers, and the Indians attacked Tepic, armed with bows and arrows and an old brass cannon.\nEspinosa and his forces numbering between 2,000 and 5,000 men while his men were armed with guns. Holmdahl had presumed that Espinosa's men would defect and join their cause. They didn't and the battle erupting into a brutal fight on the city streets. Holmdahl and his men outnumbered began to lose ground, while Holmdahl was wounded by a shell that burst near him killing the man next to him. After 36 hours of fighting, Holmdahl's forces were defeated with 2/3 of their men dead including all seven officers.\nAftermath\nHolmdahl would disband his faction and join Madero's cause and would distinguish himself during the revolution. Espinosa on the other hand would later lose Tepic, be exiled by Victoriano Huerta, and later assassinated.\nSources\n*Soldier of Fortune: Adventuring in Latin America and Mexico with Emil Lewis Holmdahl By Douglas V.
