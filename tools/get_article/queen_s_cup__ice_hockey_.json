It has been awarded since 1903 to the champion between Ontario and Quebec universities. It is the second-oldest ice hockey trophy still being awarded, after the Stanley Cup.\nThe QUAA (now named the ) ceased to operate a university hockey league after the 1986–87 season. The conference's three remaining teams at that point (McGill Redmen, UQTR Patriotes, and Concordia Stingers) joined, and remain, in the OUA conference. One of the conditions of the merger was the Queen's Cup, representing the OUA champion, must be challenged for at an OUA institution as such, when the OUA-East champion hosts such a game and that school is based in Quebec, the game is hosted by the OUA-West team, while the OUA-East team has 'home' standing (last change).\nHistory\nFor the 1902–03 season, McGill University, Queen's University and the University of Toronto founded the Canadian Intercollegiate Hockey Union. The Queen's Cup, emblematic of the CIHU championship was donated by Queen's University of Kingston, Ontario. The Queen's Cup was not presented during the war years of 1915&ndash;16, 1916–17, 1917–18, 1918–19, 1940–41, 1941–42, 1942–43, 1943–44, nor 1944&ndash;45. The first winner other than the founders was the Université de Montréal in 1949. By the 1960s, other universities, including Ontario Agricultural College (Guelph), McMaster, Waterloo and Western were granted membership and became eligible to win the Cup. Other universities have since joined the CIHU, now known as the OUA conference. The original Cup was retired in 2000 to the Hockey Hall of Fame. The 2021 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"30em\"| Season\n! width=\"180em\"| Champion\n! width=\"140em\"| Record (W-L-T)/Series\n|-\n| 1903 || McGill Redmen || 2-1-1\n|-\n| 1904 || '''Queen's Golden Gaels || 3-1-0\n|-\n| 1905 || McGill Redmen || 3-1-0\n|-\n| 1906 || Queen's Golden Gaels || 3-1-0\n|-\n| 1907 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 3-1-0\n|-\n| 1908 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 6-0-0\n|-\n| 1909 || Queen's Golden Gaels || 5-1-0\n|-\n| 1910 || Queen's Golden Gaels || 5-2-0\n|-\n| 1911 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 21-11 (2 gms vs. LU@M)\n|-\n| 1912 || McGill Redmen || 4-0-0\n|-\n| 1913 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 3-1-0\n|-\n| 1914 || Queen's Golden Gaels || 3-1-0\n|-\n| 1915 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 4-0-0\n|-\n| 1920 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 4-1-0\n|-\n| 1921 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 4-0-0\n|-\n| 1922 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 4-0-0\n|-\n| 1923 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 5-1-0\n|-\n| 1924 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 5-1-0\n|-\n| 1925 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 5-0-0\n|-\n| 1926 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 6-0-0\n|-\n| 1927 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 9-2 (2 gms vs. McG)\n|-\n| 1928 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 3-1-0\n|-\n| 1929 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 9-3 (2 gms vs. McG)\n|-\n| 1930 || McGill Redmen || 3-2 (2 gms vs. Tor)\n|-\n| 1931 || McGill Redmen || 6-4 (2 gms vs. Tor)\n|-\n| 1932 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 4-3 (2 gms vs. McG)\n|-\n| 1933 || McGill Redmen || 3-0-1\n|-\n| 1934 || McGill Redmen || 9-4 (2 gms vs. Tor)\n|-\n| 1935 || McGill Redmen || 4-0-0\n|-\n| 1936 || McGill Redmen || 15-3 (2 gms vs. Tor)\n|-\n| 1937 || McGill Redmen || 6-0-0\n|-\n| 1938 || McGill Redmen || 5-1-0\n|-\n| 1939 || McGill Redmen || 5-1-0\n|-\n| 1940 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 4-0-0\n|-\n| 1946 || McGill Redmen || 6-1-0\n|-\n| 1947 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 7-2-1\n|-\n| 1948 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 10-2-0\n|-\n| 1949 || Montreal Carabins || 10-2-0\n|-\n| 1950 || Montreal Carabins || 11-1-0\n|-\n| 1951 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 5-1-0\n|-\n| 1952 || Montreal Carabins || 8-3-1\n|-\n| 1953 || Montreal Carabins || 7-4-1\n|-\n| 1954 || Laval Rouge et Or || 8-3-1\n|-\n| 1955 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 11-0-1\n|-\n| 1956 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 9-3-0\n|-\n| 1957 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 9-3-0\n|-\n| 1958 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 9-3-0\n|-\n| 1959 || Toronto Varsity Blues || 10-2-0\n|-\n| 1960 || Laval Rouge et Or || 13-1-0\n|-\n| 1961 || Laval Rouge et Or || 9-3-0\n|}\nPlayoff era\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
