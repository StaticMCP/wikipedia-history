      "text": "# AEW Revolution\n\nAEW Revolution is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). Established in 2020, it is held annually in March, with the inaugural event taking place in February. It is one of AEW's \"Big Five\" events, along with All In, All Out, Double or Nothing, and Full Gear.\nThe 2020 event was notable as it was AEW's final PPV event before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in all of the promotion's shows being held behind closed doors with limited capacity until May 2021. The 2024 event featured Sting's final match.\nHistory\nThe inaugural Revolution event took place on February 29, 2020, at the Wintrust Arena in Chicago, Illinois, and was held in partnership between the American professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo (C2E2). This inaugural event would be AEW's last pay-per-view (PPV) held before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which moved the majority of AEW's shows to Daily's Place in Jacksonville, Florida. Later that year, AEW President and chief executive officer Tony Khan referred to Revolution as being one of the promotion's \"big four\" PPVs, their four biggest shows of the year produced quarterly, along with Double or Nothing, All Out, and Full Gear. With All In becoming one of AEW's annual events in 2023, it supplanted Double or Nothing as AEW's marquee event, and overall biggest event of the year, with the previous \"big four\" plus All In becoming the \"big five\".\nA second Revolution was held on March 7, 2021, moving Revolution to the early March slot. This second event was originally scheduled for February 27, but due to the Canelo Alvarez vs. Avni Yildirim bout in Miami Gardens, Florida airing that same night, AEW rescheduled Revolution for Sunday, March 7, which in turn made it AEW's first PPV to be held on a Sunday; the promotion had considered Saturday, March 6, but UFC 259 was airing that night.\nAEW resumed live touring with fans in July 2021. In turn, the 2022 Revolution was held on March 6 of that year at the Addition Financial Arena in Orlando, Florida. It was the culmination of a three-day event, with an episode of Rampage and a fanfest taking place on March 4 and 5, respectively, at the same venue.\nRevolution's 2023 event took place in San Francisco's Chase Center on March 5, featuring a critically acclaimed Iron Man match between MJF and Bryan Danielson as its main event.\nWrestling veteran Sting had his AEW debut match at the 2021 Revolution. On the October 18, 2023, episode of Dynamite, he announced that his retirement match would be at the 2024 Revolution. It was a tornado tag team match in which Sting and Darby Allin defended the AEW World Tag Team Championship against The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson). Sting and Allin retained, thus Sting retired as both an undefeated tag team with Allin and as champion.\nOn November 19, 2024, it was announced that the 2025 Revolution event would take place on March 9, 2025, at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, California. This was AEW's first PPV to stream on Amazon Prime Video.\nReception\nFor the 2020 Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards, the inaugural Revolution event was voted as the Best Major Wrestling Show of the year. The following year's event became the highest grossing non-WWE wrestling PPV since 1999. It was also AEW's largest attended event during the COVID-19 pandemic up to that point, with an estimated 1,300 spectators.\nAll the Revolution PPVs have received positive reviews, with the 2020, 2021, and 2024 PPVs receiving particular critical acclaim. The 2020 and 2023 event was voted as the Best Major Wrestling Show of their respective years for the Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards, while the 2021 event was the highest-grossing non-WWE wrestling PPV since 1999. The 2021 event was also AEW's largest attended event during the COVID-19 pandemic up to that point.\nEvents\n{| class=\"mw-datatable wikitable sortable succession-box\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\"\n!#\n!Event\n!Date\n!City\n!Venue\n!Main Event\n!Ref.\n|-\n|1\n|Revolution (2020)\n|February 29, 2020\n|Chicago, Illinois\n|Wintrust Arena\n|Chris Jericho (c) vs. Jon Moxley for the AEW World Championship\n|\n|-\n|2\n|Revolution (2021)\n|March 7, 2021\n|Jacksonville, Florida\n|Daily's Place\n|Kenny Omega (c) vs. Jon Moxley in an Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch for the AEW World Championship\n|\n|-\n|3\n|Revolution (2022)\n|March 6, 2022\n|Orlando, Florida\n|Addition Financial Arena\n|\"Hangman\" Adam Page (c) vs. Adam Cole for the AEW World Championship\n|\n|-\n|4\n| Revolution (2023)\n|March 5, 2023\n|San Francisco, California\n|Chase Center\n|MJF (c) vs. Bryan Danielson in a 60-minute Iron man match for the AEW World Championship\n|\n|-\n|5\n|Revolution (2024)\n|March 3, 2024\n|Greensboro, North Carolina\n|Greensboro Coliseum\n|Sting and Darby Allin (c) vs. The Young Bucks (Matthew Jackson and Nicholas Jackson) in a Tornado tag team match for the AEW World Tag Team Championship\n|\n|-\n|6\n|Revolution (2025)\n|March 9, 2025\n|Los Angeles, California\n|Crypto.com Arena\n|Jon Moxley (c) vs. Cope vs. Christian Cage for the AEW World Championship\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" |\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n*List of All Elite Wrestling pay-per-view events\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.allelitewrestling.com/ All Elite Wrestling Official website]"
