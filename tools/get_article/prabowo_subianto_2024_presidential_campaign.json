The coalition was named the Great Indonesia Awakening Coalition (, abbrev: KKIR). On 7 January 2023, the office exercised his presidential campaign' mission, named as Gerindra Presidential Election-winning Agency, was inaugurated. On 23 January 2023, the coalition joint secretariat was inaugurated.\nOn 28 August 2023, the coalition was renamed to Advanced Indonesia Coalition (, abbrev: KIM), having a similar name to his previous rival Joko Widodo's coalition,  the Onward Indonesia Coalition (, abbrev: KIM). Muhaimin Iskandar, chairman of National Awakening Party, unaware of this change, concluded that KKIR is now technically disbanded on 29 August 2023. Then, the National Awakening Party withdrew their supports to Prabowo Subianto on 1 September 2023, and instead, declared support for his rival, Anies Baswedan, with Muhaimin Iskandar declared as Anies Baswedan's running mate for vice president by joining the rival Coalition of Change for Unity (, abbrev: KPP) on 2 September 2023.\nRunning mate\nPoliticians named as possible running mates to Prabowo included Minister of State-owned Enterprises Erick Thohir, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto, and Governor of West Java Ridwan Kamil. Following the Constitutional Court of Indonesia's controversial ruling in October, Joko Widodo's son and mayor of Surakarta Gibran Rakabuming Raka received Golkar's endorsement as Prabowo's running mate. On 22 October 2023, Prabowo officially announced that Gibran would become his running mate.\nCoalition parties\n* Gerindra Party\n* Golkar Party\n* Democratic Party\n* National Mandate Party (PAN)\n* Crescent Star Party (PBB)\n* Garuda Party\n* Indonesian People's Wave Party (Gelora)\n* Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI)\nWithdrawn support:\n* National Awakening Party (PKB) – withdrawn on 1 September 2023.\nEndorsements\nPositions\n* Prabowo endorsed a free lunch program for Indonesian children, which would target over 80 million.\n* The campaign supported a continuation of the previous administration's natural resource downstreaming policies.\nControversies\ncampaign billboard (taken on 24 November 2023)]]\nIts controversial presidential campaign advertisement was reported by Indonesian Democracy Radar to Bawaslu (GESA) on 20 November 2023 due to alleged violations. The advertisement was first aired on 14 November, the day when presidential serial numbers were drawn, two weeks just prior campaign start on 28 November. Also, the advertisement appears to feature children, although the campaign team claimed that those images were made by artificial intelligence. The Indonesian Children's Protection Commission (KPAI) responded to the advertisement as a misuse.\nOn 12 December, Prabowo went viral after his commentary about Anies Baswedan ethics by said \"ndasmu etik\" (English: Ethics, your animal head!) which is considered insulting him. His spokesperson later stated that it was just a joke.\nOn 26 December 2023, during his visit to Aceh, Prabowo stated that Indonesian government must pay attention to the interests of the people who still live under welfare rather than Rohingya refugees.\nLogistics\nPrabowo Subianto's campaign spent 207 billion Indonesian rupiahs (13.22 million 2024 United States dollars), ahead of Anies Baswedan 2024 presidential campaign of 49 billion rupiahs but behind Ganjar Pranowo 2024 presidential campaign spendings of 506 billion rupiahs.\nSee also\n* Prabowo Subianto 2014 presidential campaign\n* Prabowo Subianto 2019 presidential campaign\nReferences"
