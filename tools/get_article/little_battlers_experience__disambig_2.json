The first game of the series was released on June 16, 2011, for the PlayStation Portable and has expanded to six official games and three Japanese anime series.

The super strong cardboard was used as material for special battlefields for LBXs, specialized miniature robots made by Tiny Orbit that were once banned due to their destructive purposes. Their popularity has again risen due to the specialized battlefield, and special models of LBX were made.\nFour years after the creation of these fortified cardboard, in AD 2050, Van Yamano, a male middle school student, was entrusted with the LBX \"AX-00\" by a mysterious woman, containing a Platinum Capsule.

It wasn't until the introduction of the highly resilient  in 2042 that the highly dangerous toyline saw a massive resurgence in popularity and has since become both a popular hobby amongst collectors, as well as a massively competitive sport around the world.\nRoughly the size of an average human hand, an LBX is highly customizable, allowing anyone to change its three core components: the , from which all other parts connect; its  that acts both as enhanced armor for the Core Skeleton and provides the model's finalized appearance; and the , which houses the robot's external components necessary for the robot to function, such as memory units, battery, external motor(s) and other miscellaneous parts.\nTypically controlled using cellphone-like devices called a , LBX usually battles against other player's LBXs in special  battlefields made from fortified cardboard in controlled regulations set by the combatants. Players can also command their LBX to execute , powerful special attacks that can be learned once the LBX's in-system  reaches at least 100%, with certain LBX models has access to alternative  and set-exclusive  powerful enough to cause a  on an LBX and destroy it beyond repair.\nCharacters\nMain characters\n;\n:\n:A 13-year-old boy and the main protagonist of the series.
