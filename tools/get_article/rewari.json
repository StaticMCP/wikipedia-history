This track was laid between Delhi and Ajmer. The gauge was converted to  broad gauge in 1995 for one of the tracks. This allowed metre gauge trains from Rajasthan to continue up to Delhi Sarai Rohilla station on the remaining track. The second track from Rewari to Delhi Sarai Rohilla station was converted to broad gauge in 2007 as all the metre gauge tracks from Rewari to cities in Rajasthan had been converted to broad gauge by then. Thus all the railway tracks from Rewari have been converted to broad gauge obviating the need for change of trains at gauge-change stations such as Delhi and Ahmedabad.\nRewari is a major junction on the Indian railway network and is connected to the major cities of India by direct trains. Six railway lines branch out from it to Delhi, Ajmer via Narnaul and Ringas, Ajmer via Alwar, Loharu via Kanina, Hisar and Jhajjar-Rohtak. The latest sixth single-track line to Jhajjar and Rohtak was constructed in 2008–12 and commissioned in January 2013. A seventh double-track line starts from Khori near Rewari to Asaoti near Palwal for facilitating carriage of goods on Western Dedicated Freight Corridor. \"New Rewari\" railway station has been built on this dedicated freight railway line. A line branches off from New Rewari station, goes over Rewari-Narnaul and Rewari-Kanina-Mahendragarh tracks to join the Rewari-Bhiwani railway line 2&nbsp;km after the Rewari junction, thus bypassing the Rewari junction. This obviates the need for goods trains on Western Dedicated Freight Corridor to pass through Rewari junction for going towards Hisar.\nRewari-Delhi double railway track was electrified in 2018. Rewari has electrified tracks on the Jaipur-Alwar-Rewari-Bhiwani-Hisar and Rewari-Narnaul-Ringas-Phulera routes.

(It may be converted to NH and become a part of Rewari-Kanina-Mahendragarh-Tosham-Hisar.)\n* SH-15 Shahjahanpur-Rewari 21&nbsp;km.\n* SH-26) Gurgaon-Pataudi-Rewari 52&nbsp;km.\nThe two-lane SH-26 was declared a national highway, NH352W, in 2018 and is being widened to four-lane to provide an alternative to NH 48. It will be ready in early 2024. The new alignment of NH 352W will join Dwarka Expressway (NH 248-BB) and provide fast connectivity of just one hour duration from Rewari to Palam airport and Delhi bypassing congested NH 48 in Gurgaon.\nA road bridge is being constructed on SH-15 at Rewari Anaj Mandi and the road will be widened to 4 lanes.\nThere are frequent bus services between Rewari and Delhi, as well as other towns of Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan.\nEducation\nRewari has one university, ten-degree colleges, two BEd colleges, 110 secondary / higher secondary schools, one industrial training institute and one footwear training institute.
