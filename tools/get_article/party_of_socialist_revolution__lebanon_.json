The party was founded in 1964. The formation of the party was announced in early September 1964, with Youssef Moubarek as party chairman and Moustafa Chaker as general secretary.[http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/141-6-83.shtml Pro-Chinese Party in Lebanon] The group published Ila amam ('Forward'). The group did not fully support the line of Mao Zedong, but notably did not support the Soviet Union in their dispute with China. The group argued that the mainstream of the Lebanese Communist Party had become too supportive of Nasser, and accused Khalid Bakdash of 'revisionism'. The group argued that solely through people's war could Israel be defeated.\nTheir best-known recruit was the Syrian General Afif al-Bizri.\nReferences"
