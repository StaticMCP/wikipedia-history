Takeda Shingen attacked Odawara Castle, as a response to Hōjō's intervention into Shingen invasion of Suruga Province.\nBackground\nIn 1568, as a response to Hōjō clan intervention in Takeda invasion of Suruga Province, Takeda Shingen broke the alliance with the Hōjō, and came into Hōjō territory.\nSiege\nShingen came into Musashi Province from his home province of Kai, attacking Takiyama and Hachigata Castles, where Ujiyasu's sons repulsed them.\nAfter failing at the siege of Takiyama and  siege of Hachigata (1568), Takeda Shingen nevertheless moved to Sagami Province against the Hōjō clan capital fortress of Odawara in 1569. The siege lasted only three days, after which the Takeda forces burned the town to the ground and left.\nAftermath\nOdawara castle itself did not fall and was still held by the Hojo, end of Shingen's campaign at Sagami Province against Hōjō clan.\nReferences\n*Turnbull, Stephen (1998).
