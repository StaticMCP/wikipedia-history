He represented Vic Metro at the NAB AFL U18 Championships. In 2007 he made his senior debut with Coburg in the Victorian Football League (VFL) as part of a trial program. Runner-up in the Calder Cannons' Best and Fairest award for 2007, he is the son of former Hawthorn player Robert Polkinghorne, nephew of Hawks star David Polkinghorne.\nPolkinghorne made his debut in round 6, 2008 at the Gabba against Melbourne.\nPolkinghorne received considerable media attention for kicking a match winning torpedo goal from backward of the centre square in the dying minutes of Brisbane's round 10, 2012 victory over ladder leaders West Coast.\nHe was delisted by the Lions at the end of the 2014 season.\nIn February 2015, Polkinghorne was given a short-term contract by Essendon to play in the 2015 NAB Challenge as a \"top-up\" player, due to 26 Essendon players withdrawing from the NAB Challenge because of the ongoing Essendon Football Club supplements controversy.\nIn January 2016, he signed with Essendon as a top-up player.\nStatistics\n:\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2008\n|\n| 31 || 4 || 0 || 2 || 10 || 12 || 22 || 10 || 10 || 0.0 || 0.5 || 2.5 || 3.0 || 5.5 || 2.5 || 2.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2009\n|\n| 31 || 20 || 15 || 9 || 111 || 105 || 216 || 86 || 48 || 0.8 || 0.5 || 5.6 || 5.3 || 10.8 || 4.3 || 2.4\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2010\n|\n| 31 || 15 || 6 || 4 || 79 || 126 || 205 || 48 || 50 || 0.4 || 0.3 || 5.3 || 8.4 || 13.7 || 3.2 || 3.3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2011\n|\n| 31 || 22 || 14 || 17 || 193 || 158 || 351 || 69 || 83 || 0.6 || 0.8 || 8.8 || 7.2 || 16.0 || 3.1 || 3.8\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2012\n|\n| 31 || 20 || 13 || 8 || 173 || 106 || 279 || 66 || 47 || 0.7 || 0.4 || 8.7 || 5.3 || 14.0 || 3.3 || 2.4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2013\n|\n| 31 || 11 || 5 || 5 || 88 || 74 || 162 || 38 || 12 || 0.5 || 0.5 || 8.0 || 6.7 || 14.7 || 3.5 || 1.1\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2014\n|\n| 31 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 9 || 9 || 18 || 2 || 5 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 4.5 || 4.5 || 9.0 || 1.0 || 2.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2016\n|\n| 50 || 7 || 1 || 3 || 38 || 67 || 105 || 24 || 7 || 0.1 || 0.4 || 5.4 || 9.6 || 15.0 || 3.4 || 1.0\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 101\n! 54\n! 48\n! 701\n! 657\n! 1358\n! 343\n! 262\n! 0.5\n! 0.5\n! 6.9\n! 6.5\n! 13.4\n! 3.4\n! 2.6\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
