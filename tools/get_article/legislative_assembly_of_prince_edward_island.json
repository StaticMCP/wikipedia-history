The Legislative Assembly meets at Province House, which is at the intersection of Richmond and Great George Streets in Charlottetown. Bills passed by the Assembly are given royal assent by the lieutenant governor in the name of the King of Canada.\nHistory\nAs a colony, Prince Edward Island originally had a bicameral legislature founded in 1773 with the Legislative Council of Prince Edward Island serving as the upper house and the House of Assembly as the lower house. Together they composed the 1st General Assembly of the Island of Saint John. After the name of the colony changed in 1798, the body became known as the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island.\nIn 1769, a British Order in Council established a new government on the British colony of St. John's Island (present day P.E.I.). In 1770, Lieutenant Governor Walter Patterson (the island's first Governor) arrived and appointed a Council to assist him in the administration of the island. By 1773, at the insistence of the British government, Governor Patterson summoned the island's first assembly.\nElections for the island's first House of Assembly were held on July 4, 1773, with 18 members being elected. Tradition has it that the first session of the island's new assembly was held in the Crossed Keys Tavern on the corner of Queen and Dorchester Streets in Charlottetown; however, a journal entry contradicts this and indicates that it was actually held in the home of James Richardson.\nIn 1839, an important distinction was drawn between the executive and legislative capacities of the Legislative Council. This distinction proved to be an important step on the road to responsible government which was finally implemented in 1851.\nPrior to 1893, Prince Edward Island had a bicameral system of government, consisting of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly. These two bodies were amalgamated in 1893 to create one Legislative Assembly consisting of 30 members elected from 15 different constituencies. Each constituency returned a Councillor and an Assemblyman to the Assembly. The only change to this system of returning members to the assembly was the addition of two Members resulting from the creation of 6th Queens in 1966. In 1996, the system and the electoral map were restructured, and the province now has twenty-seven Members of the Legislative Assembly, each elected from a different constituency.\nIn 2015, Province House was closed for repairs and conservation work. The legislature moved to the adjacent Hon. George Coles Building, where it is expected to remain for several years.\nComposition\nThe Legislative Assembly currently has 27 single-member districts and is currently the smallest provincial assembly in Canada.\nPrior to the 1996 provincial election, the province was divided into 16 dual-member districts, each of which was represented by one member who held the title Assemblyman and one member who held the title Councillor. This was a holdover from the legislature's historic bicameral structure; instead of simply abolishing its upper house as most Canadian provinces with historically bicameral legislatures did, Prince Edward Island merged the two houses in 1893. Although both members sat in the same legislative house, all voters in a district voted for the assemblyman while only landowners could vote for the councillor. Excepting the division of 5th Queens, the district that contained the capital city of Charlottetown, into two districts in 1966, these district boundaries were never adjusted for demographic or population changes.\nThe property qualification was discontinued in 1963, largely eliminating any practical distinction between the two roles, although the nominal titles continued to be used until the current single-member districts were introduced in 1996.\nSeating plan\n{| style=\"text-align:center;font-size:87%;\" cellpadding=\"1px\"\n|-\n| |\n|  | McLane\n|  | Arsenault\n|  | Croucher\n|  | Ramsay\n|  | Redmond\n|  | DesRoches\n| | Bell\n|-\n| style=\"padding-top: 1px\" |\n|-\n| |\n|  | Hudson\n|  | Vacant\n|  | Dillon\n|  | Thompson\n|  | LANTZ\n|  | Burridge\n|  | Compton\n|-\n| style=\"padding-top: 25px\" |\n|-\n|  | MacEwen\n|-\n| style=\"padding-top: 25px\" |\n|-\n| |\n| |\n|  | Deagle\n|  | MacKay\n| |\n|  | PERRY\n|  | McNeilly\n|  | MacFARLANE\n|  | Bernard\n|-\n| |\n|  | Dollar\n|  | MacLennan\n|  | Trivers\n| |\n|  | Henderson\n|  | Simpson\n| |\n|  | Bevan-Baker\n|}\nCurrent as of August 2025\nMembers of the General Assembly\nCabinet ministers are in bold, party leaders are in italic, and the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly is designated by a dagger (†).\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!\n!Name\n!Party\n!Riding\n!First elected / previously elected\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Alberton-Bloomfield\n|2019\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Belfast-Murray River\n|2015\n|  (until November 11, 2023)\n|Progressive Conservative\n|rowspan=2|Borden-Kinkora\n|2015\n|Matt MacFarlane  (since February 7, 2024)\n|Green\n|2024\n|  (until February 21, 2025)\n|rowspan=2|Progressive Conservative\n|rowspan=2|Brackley-Hunter River\n|2019\n|Kent Dollar  (since August 12, 2025)\n|2025\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Charlottetown-Belvedere\n|2023\n|'\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Charlottetown-Brighton\n|2023\n|  (until February 11, 2025)\n|Progressive Conservative\n|rowspan=2|Charlottetown-Hillsborough Park\n|2019\n|Carolyn Simpson  (since August 12, 2025)\n|Liberal\n|2025\n|\n|Green\n|Charlottetown-Victoria Park\n|2019\n|\n|Liberal\n|Charlottetown-West Royalty\n|2019\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Charlottetown-Winsloe\n|2020\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Cornwall-Meadowbank\n|2021\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Evangeline-Miscouche\n|2023\n| (until October 3, 2025)\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Georgetown-Pownal\n|2011\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Kensington-Malpeque\n|2015\n|'''\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Mermaid-Stratford\n|2023\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Montague-Kilmuir\n|2019\n|†\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Morell-Donagh\n|2015\n|\n|Green\n|New Haven-Rocky Point\n|2015\n|\n|Liberal\n|O'Leary-Inverness\n|2007\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Rustico-Emerald\n|2015\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Souris-Elmira\n|2023\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Stanhope-Marshfield\n|2019\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Stratford-Keppoch\n|2023\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Summerside-South Drive\n|2023\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Summerside-Wilmot\n|2023\n|\n|Liberal\n|Tignish-Palmer Road\n|2011\n|\n|Progressive Conservative\n|Tyne Valley-Sherbrooke\n|2023\n|}\nParty membership\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|Number of membersper party by date\n!colspan=2|2023\n!|2024\n!colspan=4|2025\n|-\n!Apr 3\n!Nov 11\n!Feb 7\n!Feb 11\n!Feb 21\n!Aug 12\n!Oct 3\n|-\n|Progressive Conservative\n|22\n|colspan=\"2\"|21\n|20\n|19\n|20\n|19\n|-\n|Liberal\n|colspan=\"5\"|3\n|colspan=\"2\"|4\n|-\n|Green\n|colspan=\"2\"|2\n|colspan=\"5\"|3\n|-\n|rowspan=2|\n|Total members\n|27\n|26\n|27\n|26\n|25\n|27\n|26\n|-\n|Vacant\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|1\n|2\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|\n|Government Majority\n| 17\n| 16\n| 15\n| 14\n|colspan=\"2\"|13\n| 12\n|}\nOfficers\nThe legislature Black Rod has been carried by the Sergeant-at-Arms since 2000.\nSee also\n* List of Prince Edward Island General Assemblies\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.assembly.pe.ca/index.php The Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island], official website\n* [http://etatscanadiens-canadiangovernments.enap.ca/fr/index.aspx Canadian Governments Compared]"
