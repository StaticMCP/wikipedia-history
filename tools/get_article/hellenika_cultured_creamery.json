The Pike Place Market shop offers twelve flavors of cultured gelato. Seating is not available. The interior has blue and white tiles, a stainless steel counter, and a kitchen at the back of the shop. Among gelato flavors are coconut ube, dutch chocolate, fairy bread, honey lavender, honey macadamia, honeydew mint, lemon curd, London fog (made with Earl Grey tea from nearby MarketSpice, marionberry, pistachio, and vanilla malt. According to KING-TV, Hellenika uses cultures that \"are more understated than those used in traditional yogurt\" so the \"tangy taste is less intense and more flavorful\".\nHistory\nSiblings Alex, Connie, and Pete Apostolopoulos are co-founders of Hellenika, which opened in the space previously occupied by Bavarian Meats in 2023.\nReception\nIn 2024, Jade Yamazaki Stewart and Harry Cheadle included Hellenika in Eater Seattle list of fourteen \"great\" restaurants near Pike Place Market, and Sophie Grossman included the business in an overview of fifteen of the \"coolest places\" for ice cream and gelato in the city.
