      "text": "# 1990 Czechoslovak Social Democracy leadership election\n\nA leadership election was held within the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) on 25 March 1990. It was the first leadership election since the party's re-establishment and saw Jiří Horák defeat Rudolf Battěk. Battěk was supported by exiled politicians from the party, and wanted ČSSD to run in the 1990 parliamentary elections as part of the Civic Forum list, while Horák wanted the party to run independently.\nResults\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n|-\n!

The ČSSD received only 4% of the vote and failed to cross the electoral threshold. Horák blamed Battěk's wing for the failure and Battěk and his supporters were expelled from the party.\nReferences"
