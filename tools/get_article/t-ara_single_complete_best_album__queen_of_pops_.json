It was released on July 2, 2014 by EMI Music Japan. The album contains all of T-ara's Japanese singles released up to their third and final Japanese album, Gossip Girls, including the sub-unit QBS's single \"Kaze no Yō ni\", as well as other tracks that T-ara had recorded for their three previous Japanese albums.\nFormats\nThe album includes two separate discs, a \"Japanese Single Collection\" containing the group's Japanese singles, and a \"Anthem Song Collection\" that contains notable tracks off of their three Japanese albums. The album was released with three separate editions; a diamond edition that contains the two collections and a randomized piece of any T-ara member's costume as memorabilia, a sapphire edition that only contains the two collections, and a pearl edition that only contains the \"Japanese Single Collection\".\nA DVD/Blu-ray version of the compilation album was released a week earlier called T-ARA Single Complete Best Music Clips \"Queen of Pops\", containing a compilation of the group's Japanese music videos.\nTrack listing\nSingle Complete BEST「Queen of Pops」特設サイト |url=https://sp.universal-music.co.jp/t-ara/queenofpops/ |website=T-ARA  Single Complete BEST「Queen of Pops」特設サイト |access-date=24 December 2024}}\n| extra_column  = Producer(s)\n| total_length  =\n| title1        = Bo Peep Bo Peep\n| lyrics1       = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung, Zoop\n| extra1        = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung\n| length1       =\n| title2        = yayaya\n| lyrics2       = E-Tribe, Fujino Takafumi\n| extra2        = E-Tribe, Jang Jun-ho\n| length2       =\n| title3        = Roly-Poly\n| lyrics3       = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung, Shoko Fujibayashi\n| extra3        = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung\n| length3       =\n| title4        = Lovey-Dovey\n| lyrics4       = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung, Shoko Fujibayashi\n| extra4        = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung\n| length4       =\n| title5        = Sexy Love\n| lyrics5       = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung, Seiko Fujibayashi\n| extra5        = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung\n| length5       =\n| title6        = Bunny Style!\n| note6         = バニスタ！\n| lyrics6       = Inoue Tomonori, MEG.ME\n| extra6        = MEG.ME\n| length6       =\n| title7        = TARGET\n| lyrics7       = MEG.ME\n| extra7        = KOH\n| length7       =\n| title8        = Kioku ~Kimi ga Kureta Michishirube~\n| note8         = 記憶 ~君がくれた道標(みちしるべ)~\n| lyrics8       = Kiyosumi Ida, Osamu Onomiyaichi\n| extra8        = Kiyosumi Ida\n| length8       =\n| title9        = Number Nine\n| lyrics9       = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung\n| extra9        = Shinsadong Tiger, Choi Kyu-sung\n| length9       =\n| title10       = Lead the way\n| lyrics10      = Okochi Kouta, Ono Miyaichi Osamu\n| extra10       = Okochi Kouta\n| length10      =\n| title11       = LA'booN\n| lyrics11      = Fujibayashi Shoko\n| extra11       = MEG.ME\n| length11      =\n| title12       = Kaze no Yō ni\n| note12        = 風のように) (QBS\n| lyrics12      = Fukuda Satoshi\n| extra12       = Ikuta Magokoro\n| length12      =\n}}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
