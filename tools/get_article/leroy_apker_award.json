The recipients are undergraduate students chosen for \"outstanding achievements in physics\" in order to \"provide encouragement to young physicists who have demonstrated great potential for future scientific accomplishment.\" The Apker award is the highest honor awarded to undergraduate physicists in the United States.  Generally, two prizes are awarded each year: one to a student from a Ph.D. granting institution and one to a student from a non-Ph.D. granting institution. Prior to 1995 the award was granted without institutional distinction, and a single honoree annually was common. The award consists of a $5,000 prize, allowance for traveling to the APS March Meeting to present the work, and a certificate.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Year\n!Recipient\n!Institution at time of award\n!Awarded for\n!Ref.\n|-\n|1978\n|David E.
