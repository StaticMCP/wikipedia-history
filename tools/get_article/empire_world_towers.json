The complex consisted of the Empire World Tower I and the Empire World Tower II. Both towers would have stood at 1,022 feet (312 m), with 93 stories each. They would surpass the Panorama Tower and become the city and state's tallest buildings, since the approved One Bayfront Plaza had been reduced to a height of 1,010&nbsp;ft. The towers were cancelled and never built, and in 2023 the supertall Waldorf Astoria Miami began construction on the same block at 300 Biscayne Boulevard.\nHistory\nHad they have been approved, constructed, and completed in the original proposed timeline, the towers would have surpassed Queensland 1 as the world's tallest all-residential buildings, until the completion of the Chicago Spire, but ultimately fall well short of the  Central Park Tower.\nHeight\nThe Empire World Towers were originally proposed to rise 1,200 feet (366 m) and 106 stories.\nIn December 2007, the height of the towers was decreased to 1,022 feet (312 m). It is probable that the height decrease was brought on due to the concerns raised by the Federal Aviation Administration about the proposed buildings' heights.\nSee also\n*List of tallest buildings in Miami\n*Waldorf Astoria Miami\nReferences\n[http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/empire-world-condo-tower/442 Empire World Condo Tower - The Skyscraper Center] Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=37024 Entry on Skyscraperpage.com]"
