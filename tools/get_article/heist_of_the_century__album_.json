It was released on November 17, 1998, through Supreme Team Entertainment. The production was handled by Carlos \"Six July\" Broady, 4th Disciple, Havoc of Mobb Deep, RZA, Raekwon, and DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill. It features appearances by many Wu-Tang Clan members and affiliates such as Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa and U-God, among others.\nCritical reception\n}}\nAllMusic wrote that \"Heist of the Century is packed with streetworthy jeep-jams and mind-elevating lyrics, courtesy of some of hip-hop's brightest MC's.\" Marcus Reeves of The Source thought that most tracks on the album \"drown in mid-tempo drums laced with nocturnal sound loops\". He noted the rapper's \"grim imagery\" on some of the tracks, but thought that his delivery was average.\nTrack listing\n| extra1 = Six July\n| length1 = 5:29\n| title2 = Shine\n| writer2 =\n| extra2 = Six July\n| length2 = 4:43\n| title3 = City Lights\n| writer3 =\n| extra3 = Havoc\n| length3 = 4:01\n| title4 = What Thugs Do\n| note4 = featuring DJ Rodgers & Puff\n| writer4 =\n| extra4 = Six July\n| length4 = 4:48\n| title5 = Heist of the Century\n| note5 = featuring Killa Sin\n| writer5 =\n| extra5 = DJ Muggs\n| length5 = 3:23\n| title6 = Fifth Disciple\n| extra6 = 4th Disciple\n| writer6 =\n| length6 = 1:05\n| title7 = Now Y\n| writer7 =\n| extra7 = Six July\n| length7 = 2:39\n| title8 = Spring Water\n| note8 = featuring Raekwon\n| writer8 =\n| extra8 = }}\n| length8 = 3:32\n| title9 = 4 Souls\n| note9 = featuring Shotti Screwface\n| writer9 =\n| extra9 = Six July\n| length9 = 5:26\n| title10 = Street Life\n| note10 = featuring Tekitha\n| writer10 =\n| extra10 = Six July\n| length10 = 3:43\n| title11 = Love\n| note11 = featuring Maia Campbell\n| writer11 =\n| extra11 = 4th Disciple\n| length11 = 5:07\n| title12 = Figaro Chain\n| note12 = featuring Havoc\n| writer12 =\n| extra12 = Havoc\n| length12 = 2:25\n| title13 = Polluted Wisdom\n| extra13 = RZA\n| writer13 =\n| length13 = 5:16\n| title14 = Gun Rule\n| writer14 =\n| extra14 = Six July\n| length14 = 4:51\n| title15 = Element of Surprise\n| note15 = featuring Masta Killa & U-God\n| writer15 =\n| extra15 = 4th Disciple\n| length15 = 3:06\n| title16 = Az the World Turnz\n| note16 = featuring Raekwon\n| writer16 =\n| extra16 = 4th Disciple\n| length16 = 3:45\n| title17 = Wu-Blood Kin\n| note17 = featuring Ghostface Killah & 12 O'Clock\n| writer17 =\n| extra17 = Six July\n| length17 = 2:54\n| title18 = I Want It All\n| writer18 =\n| extra18 = Six July\n| length18 = 4:17\n| total_length = 1:10:30\n}}\nNotes\n* }} signifies a co-producer\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" |Chart (1998)\n! scope=\"col\" |Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
