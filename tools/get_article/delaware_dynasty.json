The team was a member of the United Soccer Leagues Premier Development League (PDL), the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid, until 2007, when the team left the league and the franchise was terminated.\nThe team played its home games at the Kirkwood Soccer Complex in New Castle, Delaware, around 8 miles south of the state's largest city, Wilmington. The team's colors were white and black.\nFinal Squad\nvs Hampton Roads Piranhas, 20 July 2007\nYear-by-year\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Division\n!League\n!Regular season\n!Playoffs\n!Open Cup\n|-\n|2006\n|4\n|USL PDL\n|4th, Northeast\n|Did not qualify\n|Did not qualify\n|-\n|2007\n|4\n|USL PDL\n|8th, Mid Atlantic\n|Did not qualify\n|Did not qualify\n|}\nCompetition history\nDelaware Dynasty entered the PDL in 2006 as an expansion franchise under head coach Matt Okoh. Things began superbly for the new boys, enjoying a comprehensive 5–1 victory over Vermont Voltage on the opening day of the season that featured a hat trick from Nigerian striker Oluwafemi Badejo; unfortunately for Delaware, things never carried on from this auspicious opening. They lost four of their next five matches (including a 7–2 hammering at the hands of the Rhode Island Stingrays), and struggled to regain their form for much of the rest of the season. They beat Westchester Flames 3–2 at home in early June, and enjoyed a 3–2 revenge win over Rhode Island shortly thereafter, but finished the season with five losses in their final seven games, including a 3–1 defeat on the road at Reading Rage, and a hard-fought 3–2 defeat to Vermont on the final day of the season which gave the New Englanders recompense for their opening-day humiliation. Dynasty finished their freshman year fourth in the Northeast Division, fourteen points behind divisional champions Westchester, and well out of the playoffs. Michael Crowley and Mkokheli Dube were Delaware's top scorers with four goals each&nbsp;– Dube's coming in just five appearances&nbsp;– while South African midfielder Vuyisani Nyandeni contributed 3 assists.\nUnfortunately for Delaware, 2007 was even worse than 2006; the team managed just three wins all year&nbsp;– 3–1 over Reading Rage, 2–0 over Richmond Kickers Future, and 4–1 over West Virginia Chaos. This was as good as it got for Dynasty, who had begun the year with a 5-game winless streak. They threw away a 2-goal lead in their 3–3 tie with West Virginia Chaos in early June, and suffered several heavy defeats to stronger opposition towards the season's end, including a 5–2 on the road at Williamsburg Legacy, a 3–1 loss to Ocean City Barons, and a humiliating 7–1 annihilation at the hands of the Hampton Roads Piranhas on the final day of the season in what turned out to be the franchise's last ever game. Dynasty finished 7th in the Mid Atlantic Division, one of the three whipping boys of the division, and only ahead of Northern Virginia Royals and West Virginia by one point and goal difference. Oluwafemi Badejo was the team's top scorer, with 6 goals, while Guilherme Fonseca contributed 5 goals and a team-leading 3 assists. Following the conclusion of the 2007 season the club folded, and left the PDL.\nCoaches\n*  Matt Okoh 2006–07\nStadia\n* Kirkwood Soccer Complex, New Castle, Delaware 2006–12\nAverage attendance\n* 2007: 87\n* 2006: 312\nSee also\n* Central Delaware SA Future\n* Delaware Wings\n* Delaware Wizards\n* List of professional sports teams in Delaware\nExternal links\n*[http://delawaredynasty.com/ Delaware Dynasty]"
