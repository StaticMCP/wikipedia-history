Ramón Cáceres and Horacio Vásquez were the main leaders of this party in the 20th century, and as such, during this time the followers of this party were also known as Horacistas.\nThe symbol of this party, and where its name came from, was a rooster with its tail, where the rivals' symbol Los Bolos was tailless. The Red Party was banned in 1930 after Rafael Trujillo's coup. Founded as a party supporting poor peasants and the low-income masses in urban areas, it was generally more popular amongst citizens than Los Bolos, which tended to be more associated with intellectuals. Its ideological heir is the Social Christian Reformist Party.\nReferences\nSee also\n* Political parties in the Dominican Republic\n* History of the Dominican Republic"
