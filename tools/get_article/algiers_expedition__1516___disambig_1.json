The Spanish, along with the Sheikh of Ténès, wanted to drive out Barbarossa and replace him with the son of the previous prince. The expedition included 10,000 or 15,000 men along with 10,000 Moors from Ténès. Barbarossa's forces included only 1,500 men.\nIn 1516, the invading fleet set sail for Algiers.  However, a storm wrecked the fleet while in transit.  When the survivors reached Algiers, they were easily routed by Barbarossa's forces.\nThe Spaniards suffered casualties of 3,000 killed or wounded and 400 captured. In total 8,000 men were lost.  The Algerian forces had few casualties.\nSee also\n*Algiers Expedition (1519)\nReferences"
