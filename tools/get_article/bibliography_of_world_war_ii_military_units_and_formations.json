It aims to include historical sources and literature (and to avoid works of fiction) about specific unit formations of World War II, such as fronts/army groups, field armies, army corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies. It also includes air force formations, such as air divisions, air groups, air wings, air squadrons and air force flights. Furthermore, it includes naval formations, such as naval divisions, naval squadrons, flotillas, carrier battle groups, naval task forces and naval fleets.\nThis article forms a part of the larger Bibliography of World War II. Bibliographies of individual warships and warship classes are omitted; they are listed separately in the Bibliography of World War II warships.\nBibliography\nArmy groups\nIncludes OF-10 (field marshal) formations.\nGermany\nArmy Group A\n*\nArmy Group Don\n*\nArmy Group Center\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nArmy Group Courland\n*\nArmy Group North\n*\n*\n*\n*\nArmy Group South\n*\n*\n*\n*\nUnited Kingdom\n21st Army Group\n*\n*\nField armies\nIncludes OF-9 (four-star general) formations.\nGermany\n*\nArmy corps\nIncludes OF-8 (three-star general) formations.\nGermany\n*  — XXXXVI Panzer Corps\n*  — Afrika Korps\n*  — Afrika Korps\nUnited Kingdom\n*  — Royal Army Veterinary Corps\n*  — Royal Army Medical Corps\n*  — Royal Military Police\n*  — Royal Army Ordnance Corps\n*  — Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers\n*  — Royal Armoured Corps\n*  — Royal Armoured Corps\n*  — Royal Corps of Signals\n*  — Royal Pioneer Corps\n*  — Royal Pioneer Corps\n*  — Reconnaissance Corps\nUnited States\n*  — XII Corps (Artillery)\nDivisions\nIncludes OF-7 (two-star general) formations.\nGermany\n*  — 1st Marine Division\n*  — 21st Panzer Division\n*  — 6th Infantry Division\n*  — 12th Infantry Division\n*  — 3rd Mountain Division\n*  — 329th Infantry Division\n*  — 96th Infantry Division\n*  — 62nd Infantry Division\n*  — 6th Panzer Division\n*  — 6th Mountain Division\nUnited Kingdom\n*  — 79th Armoured Division\n*  — 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division\n*  — 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division\n*  — 51st (Highland) Division\n*  — 1st Airborne Division\n*  — 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division\n*  — 79th Armoured Division\n*  — 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division\n*  — 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division\n*  — 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division\n*  — 1st Airborne Division\n*  — 78th Infantry Division\n*  — Guards Armoured Division\n*  — 51st (Highland) Division\n*  — 1st Airborne Division\n*  — 7th Armoured Division\n*  — Guards Armoured Division\n*  — 4th Infantry Division\nUnited States\n*  — 29th Infantry Division\n*  — 14th Armored Division\n*  — 82nd Airborne Division\n*  — 82nd Airborne Division\n*  — 84th Infantry Division\n*  — 11th Airborne Division\n*  — 1st Armored Division\n*  — 4th Armored Division\n*  — 8th Armored Division\n*  — 10th Armored Division\n*  — 17th Airborne Division\n*  — 101st Airborne Division\n*  — 3rd Armored Division\n*  — 13th Armored Division\nBrigades\nIncludes OF-6 (one-star general) formations.
