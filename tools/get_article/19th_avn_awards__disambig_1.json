To keep the length of the show as short as possible by limiting the number of awards presented on stage, about 50 of the awards split into two groupings are announced in rapid succession on a screen with awards handed out later. In the first of these groupings the announcements were made by the animated characters of 2 Funky 4 U, a forthcoming animated feature by Private North America. However, some of the animated characters \"offended some audience members as being allegedly racist.\"\nLater, Snoop Dogg generated excitement by appearing on stage to accept the award for Best Selling Tape of 2001. After returning to his seat he was thronged by about 100 fans eager to meet or congratulate him, obstructing the view of people sitting behind, although the crowd did disperse without incident.\nThen AVN publisher Paul Fishbein went on stage to present the Reuben Sturman Memorial Special Achievement Award to Cincinnati retailer Elyse Metcalf. Fishbein gave a recap of her high-profile obscenity trial and acquittal in the previous year but Metcalf gave the show an awkward moment because she was not there to accept the honor. Metcalf had left earlier \"after becoming upset over remarks made to her by a financial supporter.\"\nThe show was recorded for later broadcast and a video of the awards show was issued by VCA Pictures.\nPerformance of year's movies\n''Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle'' was announced as the adult movie industry's top selling movie and Island Fever was the top renting movie of the previous year.\nIn Memoriam\nJohn Leslie and Joey Silvera ended the show by asking for a moment of silence in memory of late director Alex de Renzy who had died in 2001.\nSee also\n* AVN Award\n* AVN Best New Starlet Award\n* AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year\n* AVN Award for Male Foreign Performer of the Year\n* AVN Female Performer of the Year Award\n* List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame\n* 2002 GayVN Awards\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20011208103701/http://www.avnawards.com/nomin-list.html 2002 AVN Award nominees] (archived at Wayback Machine, December 8, 2001)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20021209090925/http://www.avnawards.com/pastwinners.shtml 2002 AVN Award Winners] (archived at Wayback Machine, December 9, 2002)\n* [https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Adult_Video_News_Awards/ Adult Video News Awards]  at the Internet Movie Database\n*\n*\n*"
