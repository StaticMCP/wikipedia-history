The current genus Megaceryle was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848.\nThere are two subspecies:\n* M. m. maxima (Pallas, 1769) – Senegal and Gambia to Ethiopia and south to South Africa\n* M. m. gigantea (Swainson, 1837) – Liberia to northern Angola and western Tanzania,  island of Bioko\nThe nominate subspecies M. m. maxima occurs in wooded savanna while M. m. gigantea prefers tropical rainforest.\nDescription\nThe giant kingfisher is  long, with a large shaggy crest, a large black bill and fine white spots on black upperparts.  The male has a chestnut breast band and otherwise white underparts with dark flank barring. The female has a white-spotted black breast band and a chestnut belly. The forest race M. m. gigantea is darker, less spotted above, and more barred below than the nominate race, but the two forms intergrade along the forest edge zone.\nThe call is a loud wak wak wak.\nBehaviour\nBreeding\nIn South Africa breeding takes place between September and January, in Zimbabwe from August to March, in Zambia March to April and in Liberia December to January.\nThe giant kingfisher is monogamous and a solitary breeder. The nest is a long horizontal tunnel that is excavated into a river bank by both sexes using their feet and bills. The entrance hole is  high and  wide. The tunnel is typically  in length but a tunnel of  has been recorded. A clutch of around three eggs is laid in a chamber at the end of the tunnel.\nFeeding\nThis large species feeds on crabs, fish, and frogs, caught by diving from a perch.\nGiant kingfisher (Megaceryle maxima) female composite.jpg| Female smashing a tilapia against a post to break its spineLake Naivasha, Kenya\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Megaceryle-maxima Xeno-canto: audio recordings of the giant kingfisher]\n* Giant kingfisher - [http://sabap2.adu.org.za/docs/sabap1/429.pdf Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds]."
