While it is now available to drivers and non-drivers, it was originally created for people who did not have a driver's licence.  It displays the holder's name, address (optional), date of birth and signature.\nPrior to April 2019, the Queensland adult proof of age card was issued for residents of Queensland who are aged over 18 years.\nReferences"
