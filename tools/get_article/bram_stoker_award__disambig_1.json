They are named after Irish horror writer Bram Stoker, author of the novel Dracula, among others.\nSeveral members of the HWA&mdash;including Dean Koontz&mdash;were reluctant to endorse such writing awards, fearing it would incite competitiveness rather than friendly admiration. The HWA therefore went to lengths to avoid mean-spirited competition, they agreed to specifically seek out new and neglected writers and works, and officially issue Awards not based on \"best of the year\" criteria, but \"for superior achievement\", which allows for ties.\nNominated works come from two different processes. Works can be recommended by any member of the HWA and a separate list of works is presented by a Jury for each category. Members with Active status then vote on works appearing on preliminary ballots. The field is thereby narrowed to the Final ballot; and Active members vote to choose the winners from that Final Ballot. Winners of a Bram Stoker Award receive a statuette made by the New York firm Society Awards.\nThe terms Bram Stoker Award and Bram Stoker Awards are registered trademarks of the Horror Writers Association.\nCategories\nCurrent categories\nyear of eligibility, with the ceremony convened in 2022, the Bram Stoker Award is presented for \"Superior Achievement\" in the following categories:\n* Novel (1987–)\n* First Novel (1987–)\n* Young Adult Novel (2011–)\n* Middle Grade Novel (2022–)\n* Graphic Novel (2011–)\n* Long Fiction (1998–)\n* Short Fiction (1998–)\n* Anthology (1998–)\n* Fiction Collection (1998–)\n* Poetry Collection (2000–)\n* Non-Fiction (1987–)\n* Short Non-Fiction (2019–)\n* Screenplay (1998–2004, 2011–)\n* Lifetime Achievement (1987–)\nDiscontinued categories\nDiscontinued categories include:\n* Novelette (1987–1997)\n* Short Story (1987–1997)\n* Collection (1987–1997)\n* Work for Young Readers (1998–2004)\n* Alternative Forms:\n** Other Media (1993, 1998–2000)\n** Alternative Forms (2001–2004)\n* Illustrated Narrative (1998–2004)\nPast winners\nStephen King holds the record for both the most nominations (33) and wins (13).
