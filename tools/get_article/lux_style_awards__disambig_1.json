The ceremony celebrates \"style\" in the Pakistani entertainment industry, such as cinema, television, fashion, and music. Categories have changed over the years, but most are awarded by panels of judges who are experts in the respective industries, with some \"people's choice\" awards in the film and TV categories.\nThe ceremonies, which are televised, have usually been held in Karachi, but in some years have taken place in Lahore, Kuala Lumpur and Dubai.\nHistory\nThe Lux Style Awards were created in 2002 by Musharaf Hai, the Chairperson of Unilever Pakistan at the time. It is the biggest annual awards ceremony held in Pakistan as of 2018.\nThe ceremony was postponed in 2008 owing to security concerns and economic conditions, and it was decided to provide annual scholarships to students of the National College of Arts (TV and Film), National Academy of Performing Arts (Music), and to two fashion schools.\nViewer's Choice Awards for best male and female actors had originally been added to engage audiences viewing the show. In 2019, it was decided to add critics' choice awards for these categories as well.\nCeremonies\nThe following is a listing of all Lux Style Awards ceremonies since 2002.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
