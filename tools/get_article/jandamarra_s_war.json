As a teenager, he left the cattle station with his Uncle Ellemarra to be initiated in Bunuba Law, but when they are caught spearing sheep both are sent to prison. After he left prison, he was expelled from Bunuba society for sleeping with other men's women and soon after he became friends with a policeman named Richardson. Later he killed Richardson, marking the beginning of his three-year war against the Europeans.\nIn 1894, Jandamarra led a rebellion against invading European pastoralists in order to defend Bunuba land and culture.\nJandamarra spent the last few years of his life hiding in his spirit country, Djumbud. His incredible ability to outwit police officers lead many to believe he had magical powers and many pastoralists left the Kimberley area for fear of him. His life ended when he was shot dead by Mungo Micki, an Aboriginal tracker.\nCast\n*Darcy Anderson as Fred Edgar\n*David Beurteaux as Lukin\n*Emmanuel J.

Hopefully, it will only be a matter of time before some wily filmmakers seize on the potential to develop Jandamarra's story into a full-blown feature film\".\nAwards\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
