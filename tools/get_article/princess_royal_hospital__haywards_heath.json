It works interdependently with the other hospitals in the trust to provide a complete service.\nPerformance\nAs a trust (including the other sites), the hospital was rated 6th best in the country for safety, and in the top 5% for hospital survival rates, in the year 2009-10.\nSee also\n* Healthcare in Sussex\n* List of hospitals in England\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.nhs.uk/services/hospital/princess-royal-hospital/N6J7V Princess Royal Hospital] on the NHS website\n* [https://www.cqc.org.uk/location/RXH09 Inspection reports] from the Care Quality Commission"
