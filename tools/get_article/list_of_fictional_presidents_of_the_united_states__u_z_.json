She has also been married for over 20 years to Frank Underwood, a Democratic Congressman from South Carolina. She is a crucial part in helping Frank manipulate his way into the presidency after he is betrayed for the secretary of state nomination by new president Garrett Walker.\n* In season 2, she is the new Second Lady of the United States from December 2013 after Frank becomes Walker's vice president. By the end of this season, she becomes First Lady of the United States in October 2014 when Frank ensures Walker's resignation and his own ascension to the position of president.\n* In season 3, she serves for a few months in 2015 as United States Ambassador to the United Nations but is forced to resign after falling for a manipulation of Russian President Viktor Petrov. The reason publicly stated for her resignation is to focus on Frank's re-election bid to cover up her failing. This event, combined with increasing tensions with Frank motivates her to leave him just before the Democratic New Hampshire primary in January 2016.\n* After weeks of tensions between the two and a coverup of their marital split, Claire returns to Frank when he is shot and wounded in an assassination attempt in March 2016. This is however at the cost of Frank agreeing to make her his vice presidential candidate for the presidential election by manipulating the Democratic National Convention. With Frank facing investigation at the end of Season 4 due to past crimes, Claire suggests stirring up fear of terrorism to improve their popularity.\n* During the events of Season 5, Claire is elected as Vice President of the United States in the 2016 election by the Senate initially after the Underwood campaign abuses presidential power to force Ohio and Tennessee into a scenario where their results cannot be certified, thus throwing the election of president to the House of Representatives. She becomes Acting President of the United States on January 20, 2017 due to the House being unable to choose between Frank and Republican nominee Will Conway. During her acting term, Claire proposes a new election in Ohio and Tennessee that is adopted by Congress and sees the Underwood's win after leaking damaging recordings of Conway and his vice presidential candidate, General Ted Brockhart.\n* Once Frank resumes office in mid-February 2017, Claire resumes her new role as vice president. However, Frank is continually hounded by congressional investigations into his past. With the help of Chief of Staff Doug Stamper, Frank manipulates events to allow a face-saving resignation.\n* Therefore, Claire is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on March 15, 2017, after Frank submits his resignation. This concludes Season 5.\n* Played by: Robin Wright\n* Political Party: Democrat\nPresident Francis J. \"Frank\" Underwood\n* President in House of Cards (Season 2–5)\n* At the start of the series, he is the Democratic Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives and a Congressman from South Carolina. He is initially promised the position of US Secretary of State by incoming President Garrett Walker but when Walker reneges, Underwood sets in motion a plan to replace Walker as president.\n* The first half of his plan sees him become vice president after manipulating a situation to get incumbent vice president Jim Matthews to run in the special election for his old position as Governor of Pennsylvania, with Frank destroying the campaign of Congressman Peter Russo. Frank then makes a deal with Raymond Tusk, a billionaire energy tycoon with significant influence over President Walker, to ensure Frank replaces Matthews as vice president. During these efforts, Frank is forced to murder his lover Zoe Barnes, a journalist, as well as Russo to ensure their silence.\n* During Season 2 as vice president, Frank continues to undermine President Walker and ensures his resignation on October 30, 2014, by implicating Walker in a money laundering scheme orchestrated by Tusk and a Chinese businessman to stack Congress in favor of the Democrats. Frank becomes president upon Walker's resignation.\n* In the events of Season 3, Underwood is embattled due to low popularity from the Walker scandal, a hostile Congress and a rebelling Democratic party. After initially pledging to not run in 2016, Frank uses Congress forcing him to de-fund his 'America Works' job program (a massive reform of social security and medical benefits to pay for new jobs) to enter the 2016 primaries. He runs primarily against former Solicitor General Heather Dunbar in the Democratic primary.\n* During this campaign, Underwood is incapacitated due to assassination attempt in March 2016 and is sidelined for two weeks, his duties fulfilled by VP Donald Blythe in an acting capacity. Prior to this attempt, Underwood's wife Claire had left him and it had been covered up. They resumed their relationship after the assassination attempt, with Underwood agreeing to make Claire his VP candidate in 2016, manipulating the DNC to do so.\n* Runs against Republican Governor of New York Will Conway in the 2016 election. Underwood uses fear of terrorism to stir up his popularity against the more popular Conway and on Election Day he abuses presidential power to force Ohio and Tennessee into a scenario where their results cannot be certified, thus throwing the election of president to the House of Representatives. Claire briefly becomes Acting President of the United States for four weeks in January and February 2017 due to the House being unable to choose between Frank and Conway. Claire proposes a new election in Ohio and Tennessee that is adopted by Congress and sees the Underwood's win after leaking damaging recordings of Conway and his vice presidential candidate, General Ted Brockhart.\n* Underwood is then sworn in for a new term in mid February 2017 but is immediately dogged by impeachment hearings due to his past efforts to gain the presidency. With the help of his chief of staff, Doug Stamper, Underwood spins what really happened with his crimes and uses it to face savingly resign as president on March 15, 2017, so he can enter the private sector and gain more power in the shadows whilst Claire is president.\n* Played by: Kevin Spacey\n* Political Party: Democrat\nPresident Matthew Underwood\n* President in The Guest of Honor, a 1989 novel by Irving Wallace\n* Former TV Anchorman who was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n* Married to former Supermodel Alice Armstrong Underwood.\nPresident Nigel Uno\n* President in: Codename: Kids Next Door – \"Operation: W.H.I.T.E.-H.O.U.S.E.\" episode\n* Played by: Benjamin Diskin\nV\nPresident Gloria Valdez\n* President in Chain of Command, a 1999 movie.\n* Vice president to President Jack Cahill, becomes president when he is shot and killed in a struggle over the nuclear football.\n* Forces China to back down during a nuclear exchange.\n* Played by María Conchita Alonso\nPresident-elect Francisco Vargas\n* President-elect in Scandal Season 6 Episode 1\n* Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n* Former Governor of Pennsylvania.\n* First Latino to win a presidential election.\n* Defeated Senator and former First Lady Mellie Grant in the 2016 Presidential Election.\n* Assassinated on stage in Fairmount Park during his Election Night victory speech.\n* Possibly the shortest serving president-elect in history, being killed less than an hour after the announcement of him winning the election.\n* Political Party: Democratic.\n* Played by Ricardo Chavira\nPresident Funny Valentine\n* President and primary antagonist in ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part VII: Steel Ball Run''\n* Referred to as the 23rd president, taking office in 1889.\n* Uses a Stand ability called Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap to travel across dimensions, also capable of pulling objects and people from other dimensions.\n* Has scars on his back in the shape of the modern American flag.\n* Wishes to use the power of the Saint's Corpse (heavily implied to be the remains of Jesus Christ) to bring his country into a golden age at the expense of the rest of the world.

His Secret Service agents, loyal operatives of the Beloks, removed the gold bars and replaced them with painted clay duplicates, made from clay taken from a clay factory-turned-water treatment plant he bought through a shell company for his Chief of Staff's passion project. The gold was then transferred to a private prison Wright owns through another shell company, where the inmates worked to melt it down into buttons that the Beloks can then transfer discretely out of the country.\n* When Elena Federova allows herself to be captured by the FBI as part of a larger plan to expose and eliminate the Beloks' operatives in the US government, Wright has her tortured to try and find the recording that Natalia has been blackmailing him with, which Elena had stolen from the Beloks.\n* After Elena escapes and manages to ruin the attempt to get the gold out of the country, Wright is visited by Natalia, who reasserts her control over him by stabbing him in the hand and threatening him.\nY\nPresident Kenneth Jukichi Yamaoka\n* President in: Eagle by Kaiji Kawaguchi\n* Yamaoka is the 43rd president and is the first Asian-American president (third generation Japanese-American).
