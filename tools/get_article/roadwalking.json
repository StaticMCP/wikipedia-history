      "text": "# Roadwalking\n\n}}\nRoadwalking is a thru-hiking term, indicating a walk on a road instead of a trail. It usually provides an easier way to reach a further point on the trail, e.g. by avoiding steep mountain ascents. A roadwalk is an unavoidable part of some long trail systems, such as the partially unfinished Continental Divide Trail, the Appalachian Trail, and North Country Trail.\nRoadwalking is not to be confused with \"yellow blazing\", or traveling in a car instead of by foot.\nReferences"
