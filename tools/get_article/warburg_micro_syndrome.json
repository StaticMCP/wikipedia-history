Warburg Micro is caused by mutations in any of the following genes: RAB18, RAB3GAP1, RAB3GAP2 and TBC1D20\nDiagnosis\nWarburg Micro syndrome is diagnosed by genetic testing. It should be suspected when cataracts are present at birth and developmental delays are noted.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for Warburg Micro syndrome, but there are ways to help the symptoms that come with it. Congenital cataracts should be operated in the first two months. Physical and occupational therapy should begin as soon as possible. Medication can treat seizures, spasticity, and digestive issues. Orthotics like braces and assistive devices like standers and wheel chairs can improve bone health, spasticity, and mobility. Specialists can perform surgeries to address hip and spine health.\nReferences"
