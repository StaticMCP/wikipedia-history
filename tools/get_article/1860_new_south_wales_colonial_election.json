This election was for all of the 72 seats in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and it was conducted in 52 single-member constituencies, six 2-member constituencies and two 4-member constituencies, all with a first past the post system. Suffrage was limited to adult white males. This was the first election after the separation of Queensland in December 1859.\nThe previous parliament of New South Wales was dissolved on 10 November 1860 by the Governor, Sir William Denison, on the advice of the Premier, John Robertson.\nWhile there was no recognisable party structure at this election, the Sydney Morning Herald identified three main factions in the Legislative Assembly. 38 members were considered to support the government, 11 were in opposition, and a further 23 that supported Henry Parkes or were uncommitted to supporting the government.\nAlthough Robertson won the election, he relinquished the premiership to Charles Cowper to concentrate on passing land reform bills as Secretary of Lands.\nKey dates\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
