The Alianza was one of the first regional Mexican American organizations. By 1930 the Alianza had almost 300 lodges scattered throughout the Southwest and mainly in Arizona. These lodges were a safe haven for members providing various social services and helping Mexicanos who faced discrimination and denial of their civil liberties.\n1900–1920\nJapanese-Mexican Labor Association\n1903: On February 11, 1903 500 Japanese and 200 Mexican laborers joined together and formed the first labor union called, the Japanese-Mexican Labor Association. The JMLA opposed the Western Agricultural Contracting Company with three major concerns, the artificial suppression of wages, the subcontracting system that forced workers to pay double commissions, and the inflated prices of the company store. In order to address their concerns, the JMLA declared a strike against the WACC during a pivotal moment in the sugar beet season. Several of WACC's contracted workers joined the JMLA, which caused a standstill in the sugar industry. Eventually the WACC conceded to most of the JMLA's demands.\nEl Primer Congreso Mexicanista\n1911: El Primer Congreso Mexicanista met in Laredo, Texas from September 14 to 22, 1911.

In 1928 the organization had over 3,000 members and represented 8 different unions. After the Great Depression hit the US the CUOM also began advocating for restrictions on repatriation and immigration.\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)\n1929: On February 17 the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) was founded by Mexican American men in Corpus Christi, Texas. LULAC is the largest and longest-lasting Latino civil rights group in the country.

The LULAC was the first organization of Mexican-Descent to emphasize U.S. citizenship. The LULAC emerged within the historical context of South Texas between 1920 and 1930. Texas transformed from ranching and farming to an urban society, which provided a foundation for the emergence of the Mexico Texano male middle class.\n1930–1940\nEl Congreso Del Pueblo de Habla Espanola\n1935: EL Congreso grew in Southern California between 1935 and 1950. Its goal was to promote civil rights specifically in terms of working conditions for Latinos and other minorities.

Moreno along with other members of El Congreso drafted plans at hotel Alexandria for the protection of the foreign born, focusing on deportation and discriminatory legislation, which targeted aliens. Josefina Fierro de Bright later joined Moreno as one of the leaders of the organization and helped rejuvenate El Congreso.

Its ultimate goal was to regain lands awarded by the Spanish and Mexican governments to early settlers and to their townships and later lost for various reasons after the official U.S. takeover of the Southwest in 1848. The Alianza switched between legal action and confrontational tactics, which raised considerable public concern. In 1976 members of the Alianza raided the Tierra Amarilla courthouse following the lead of Tijerina. The decline of the Alianza began in 1970 when Tijerina was sentenced to jail.\nUnited Farm Workers\n1966: The NFWA merged with the Filipino American union called AWOC to form the United Farm Workers.

Gutierrez and the other founders staged MAYO's first demonstration in front of the Alamo on July 4, 1967. Group membership consisted of Mexican-American teenagers and university students who were committed to the concept of la Raza.

The Bastrop Independent School District\nAfter World War II, the League of United Latin American Citizens filed a lawsuit in Texas to eliminate educational segregation of Mexican-American children in school systems. In June 1948, the federal court in Austin stated that this kind of segregation was unconstitutional because it violated the Fourteenth Amendment.

The 975 amendments to the act expanded voting rights for minority groups that had traditionally fallen outside the Act's protections.

Thus, the act helped establish the requirement of language assistance at polling locations.\n1980–1990\nPlyler v. Doe\nPlyler v. Doe was a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding the right of free education for illegal immigrants in Texas. In October 1980, a federal appeals court upheld the district court's ruling that charging tuition to children who did not have permanent immigration status was unconstitutional. In 1982, the Supreme Court also ruled that children of illegal immigrants have the right to free public schooling. According to the decision, by treating undocumented children differently, the school district violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nReferences"
