Rathbun and named after former actor, marine collector and later honorary zoologist Charles Melbourne Ward. The type specimens were from mudflats in Sandgate, Queensland, Australia.\nIt is known as '''Ward's hairy-legged crab''', with Rathbun describing it as having \"Ambulatory legs\" which are \"densely hairy\".\nThe crabs are small with holotypes 17.6 mm across the carapace and 12.2 mm long.\nThe claws are red to maroon, with the upper moveable male claw (dactyl) having one tooth, at the base. There is orange coloration at the front edges of the carapace behind the eyes. The carapace is smooth, slightly convex, and has no teeth on the sides and looks cut-off at the front edges.\nIt is found in Queensland from Moreton Bay to Cairns.\n}}\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kankyo-gi.net/cairnsnaturealbum/Mangrove%20Boardwalk/index.html Cairns Nature Album Mangrove Walk (Includes P. wardi)]"
