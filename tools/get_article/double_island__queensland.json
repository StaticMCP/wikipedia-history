The Djabugay people (particularly the Yirrgay group) believe it is the resting place of Gudju Gudju, a Rainbow Serpent.\nThe discovery of gold on the mainland west of the area made Double Island well-known in the 1880s and 1890s; allegedly, a mining company at Irvinebank used the island around that time as a resort for employees. Also around that time, some local graziers started using the island to graze cattle.\nDouble Island (Wangal Djungay) was the location of an exclusive resort. Hollywood stars Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt and Keanu Reeves have been among the celebrities who stayed on the island.\nThe resort has been closed to the public for years. In 2012, Benny Wu from Hong Kong bought the lease of the island and planned a $10 million upgrade to the island's resort for wealthy tourists. However, by 2023, no maintenance or upgrades had been performed. With the resort having fallen into disrepair, this prompted calls for the lease to be cancelled. In June 2024, Wu's lease was revoked and the island was returned to the state of Queensland.\nReferences"
