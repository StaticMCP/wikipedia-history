She represented Australia at the 2019 World Athletics Championships held in Doha, Qatar and also at the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan. At the 2020 Olympics, she came 37th in the women's 20km walk final with a time of 1:38.11, just on 9 minutes behind the eventual winner Antonella Palmisano.\nEarly years\nHayward joined Gold Coast Little Athletics at the age of 10. She was always very active  and did a range of sports, including nippers, surf lifesaving, dancing, soccer and touch football. At Little Athletics she participated in a walking race and won.

Unfortunately she was disqualified. After reviewing this performance Hayward and her coach changed her technique and at the World Juniors/U20s she came fifth. This was Australia's best place in the event for 10 years.\nCareer\nIn June 2019, she won the silver medal in the women's 10,000 metres walk at the Oceania Athletics Championships held in Townsville, Australia.
