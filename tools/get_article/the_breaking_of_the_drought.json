According to Graham Phillips, this film is one of the most damaged films in Australia's film archive, although few sequences have severe damage in the film.\nPlot\nDrought causes Jo Galloway to lose possession of Wallaby Station to the bank. He moves to the city with his wife and daughter Marjorie to stay with his son Gilbert. He discovers that Gilbert has been embezzling family funds and has fallen in with conman Varsy Lyddleton and femme fatal Olive Lorette.\nLyddleton murders Olive then kills himself. Marjorie's boyfriend Tom Wattleby saves Gilbert from a bushfire, just as the drought breaks, restoring the family's fortunes.\nCast\n*Trilby Clark as Marjorie Galloway\n*Dunstan Webb as Tom Wattleby\n*Charles Beetham as Jo Galloway\n*Marie La Varre as Olive Lorette\n*John Faulkner as Varsy Lyddleton\n*Rawdon Blandford as Gilbert Galloway\n*Nan Taylor as Mrs Galloway\n*Arthur Albert as Walter Flour\n*Ethel Henry as Molly Henderson\nOriginal play\nThe film was based on a 1902 Australian play written for Bland Holt by English playwright Arthur Shirley.\nSynopsis\nIn 1902, at drought-stricken Wallaby Station in New South Wales, a squatter, Jo Galloway, lives with his wife and daughter Marjorie while his son Gilbert trains to be a doctor in Sydney. Gilbert falls in with bad company, in the shape of financier Varsey Lyddleton, who encourages him to forge his father's name on some cheques and ruins his family. A neighbouring squatter, Tom Wattleby, who loves Marjorie Galloway, returns from a trip to India to find the father working as a lamp cleaner and the daughter was a maid. The neighbour rescues the family and the father swears vengeance on his son. However, during a bush fire that ends in a heavy rain that breaks the drought, the hero rescues Gilbert.\nReception\nThe play made its debut at the end of 1902 and was very popular. Audiences and critics were particularly impressed by the stage design, which included things like real horses, recreations of Paddy's Market, swimming pools and real trees.\nAnnette Kellerman appeared in a 1903 production.\nHolt later adapted another play of Shirley's, The Path of Thorns, to an Australian setting, calling it Besieged in Port Arthur.\nProduction\nBland Holt had refused offers to film his play for a number of years until approached by Barrett and Percy Rea. He was impressed with the job they did on The Lure of the Bush.\nShooting began in December 1919 in Narrabri and Moree, with interiors filmed at a temporary studio at the Theatre Royal in Sydney.\nAn additional sequence was shot consisting of a water ballet and a diving display by \"water nymphs\", shot in the National Park near Sydney. This sequence is missing from most versions of the film.\nBarrett wrote the bedroom scene was considered \"suggestive\".\nReception\nSmiths Weekly thought it would \"probably make money.\" Newcastle Sun said \"the camerawork is excellent.\"\nFemale lead Trilby Clark went to the US after filming and worked in theatre and movies.\nControversy\nA New South Wales MP, Mr Wearne, asked questions in parliament complaining that the film's depiction of drought could create a bad impression overseas. An investigation was launched by the Chief Secretary's office, who later assured Wearne that new legislation meant that the export of the film could be banned by the Minister of Customs if he deemed it to be \"harmful to the Commonwealth\".\nLost film\nThe film was thought lost until 1976, when several rusty film cans containing it were found under a house in Hornsby.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/399454 Images of scenes from the film The Breaking of the Drought] at State Library Victoria.\n*\n*[https://aso.gov.au/titles/features/the-breaking-of-the-drought/ The Breaking of the Drought] at Australian Screen Online"
