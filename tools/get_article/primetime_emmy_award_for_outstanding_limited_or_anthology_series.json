Prior to that year, limited series and miniseries were entered in the same category as continuing series for Outstanding Series – Drama. According to a 1972 newspaper article in the Los Angeles Times, this change might be due to the then recent entry of a number of British produced limited series that were competing with American produced continuing series in the same pre-existing category. The category was renamed Outstanding Limited Series in 1974, and later Outstanding Miniseries in 1986.\nIn 1991, the Outstanding Miniseries category was merged with Outstanding TV Movie, then called Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special, to form Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special and Miniseries, and the number of nominees increased from five to six. For that year, two miniseries had competed with four \"made-for-television movies\". The decision was reversed in 1992. In 2011, due to a low number of eligible miniseries in recent years, the categories were again merged as Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries or Movie, before reverting in 2014, following an influx in limited series following the critically and commercial popularity of the FX anthology series American Horror Story. A year later, the name of the awards category was changed to Outstanding Limited Series, and the rules were made to distinguish that category from that of a movie by having the work have at least two episodes, and from that of a regular series by having no more than five episodes. The 2015 rule change allowed more short-seasoned cable TV programs to compete, while prior rules had forced the same programs to compete in the same category with full seasons network programs.\nWhat has been unique about this award in recent years (and even so today) is that there is almost always at least one nominee originating from Great Britain. For example, the 2005 winner was The Lost Prince, which happened to be that year's British entry. The 2006 winner, Elizabeth I, was also a British miniseries, although it was a co-production with American television network HBO. Likewise, the 2019 winner, Chernobyl, was a co-production of British and American companies (in this case, Sky UK and HBO).\nMilestones\nBefore the inaugurated category in 1973, The Life of Leonardo da Vinci marked the first non-English language television program to be nominated.\nWinners and nominations\n1970s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\"\n! width=\"5%\" | Year\n! width=\"20%\" | Program\n! width=\"70%\" | Producers\n! width=\"5%\" | Network\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Outstanding Drama/Comedy - Limited Episodes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1973(25th)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| 'Tom Brown's Schooldays\n| John McRae, producer\n| PBS'\n|-\n| The Last of the Mohicans\n| John McRae, producer\n| PBS\n|-\n| The Life of Leonardo da Vinci\n| RAI Radiotelevisione Italiana\n| CBS\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Outstanding Limited Series\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1974(26th)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| 'Columbo'' (Season 3)\n| Dean Hargrove and Roland Kibbee, executive producers; Douglas Benton, Robert F.
