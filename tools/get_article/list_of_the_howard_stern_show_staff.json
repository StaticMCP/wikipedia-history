      "text": "# List of The Howard Stern Show staff\n\n}}\nThis is a list of staff members and contributors to The Howard Stern Show.\nCurrent staff\nThese staffers currently work for and appear on the show on a regular, if not hourly basis.\nIn-studio\nThese people currently sit in the studio throughout the entire broadcast or have an exclusively in-studio role with the show when present.\nHoward Stern\nHoward Stern is the host of the show, which essentially is a discussion of topics that include world affairs, celebrity gossip, self-deprecation, sexual relationships, bodily functions, conflicts among his staff, his own personal family matters, and the antics of the show's Wack Pack. Self-proclaimed \"King of All Media\".\nRobin Quivers\nRobin Ophelia Quivers is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and first met Stern after being assigned as his newscaster at WWDC in March 1981. She has been his co-host and news anchor ever since. She is a former nurse and Captain in the United States Air Force. Quivers briefly left the show towards the end of her time at WWDC.  In 1982, Stern signed a contract to work at WNBC, and Quivers did not realize WNBC initially refused to hire her. Quivers returned to the show at WNBC a month after Stern began, having convinced WNBC management to hire Robin after all.\nStern once said that Quivers is the only person on the show that he allowed to talk freely during the broadcast, although comedian Artie Lange was allowed this privilege as well during his years on the show.\nFred Norris\nOf the show's staff, Stern met Norris first, in 1979, when the two worked as disc jockeys at WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut. Norris worked the overnight shift, after which Stern hosted the morning show. Although Stern left shortly afterwards, Norris stayed at WCCC until joining Stern and Quivers at Washington, D.C.'s WWDC in 1981. The \"Earth Dog Fred\" nickname originated in Washington, as Norris replaced an engineer nicknamed \"Earth Dog Brent.\"\nNorris' current role on the show is to provide sound effects, organize and direct commercials and live reads, and perform writing duties. Norris also provides impersonations of show regulars, celebrities and others.\nOutside the studio\nThese are the behind-the-scenes personnel, although, in the Stern world, many of these staff members appear on air.\nSteve Brandano\nBrandano, previously known as \"Steve The Intern,\" answers Stern's phones, is a contributor on The Wrap-Up Show, and was formerly the host of the Thursday night intern show.\nBenjy Bronk\nBenjy Bronk (born September 4, 1967) began working on The Howard Stern Show as an intern in 1998. Bronk eventually earned a paid position conducting pre-interviews of show guests and gathering articles for Robin Quivers' newscasts. In 2000, Benjy was given an in-studio seat next to writers Jackie Martling and Fred Norris, writing on-the-spot jokes for Stern as the show transpired.\nAfter Martling left the show in early 2001, Bronk continued as an in-studio joke writer with Norris. When the Howard Stern Show moved to Sirius satellite radio in January 2006, Bronk continued in his role as an in-studio joke writer. Bronk stopped writing in-studio after arriving late on October 26, 2016.\nRichard Christy\nWhile working as an electrician in Florida and playing as a drummer in a number of heavy metal bands including Iced Earth and Death, Christy began calling into the show from October 1999, initially sending voice mails to the show's assistant producer K. C. Armstrong, which were played on-air. From 2001 to 2003, Christy sent song parodies and bits about Armstrong and show co-host Robin Quivers including some like \"It's K.C.'s Sausage Party\" (a parody of \"It's My Party\") and \"Gay Photograph\" (a parody of the Def Leppard song \"Photograph\") that continue to be played on the show to this day. Christy made his first visit to the show on April 24, 2003, where he played a round of blackjack to win a date with a porn star.\nIn July 2004, when the show was holding a \"Win John's Job\" contest following the departure of Stuttering John from the show, Christy won the position as voted by fans. Since joining the show, Christy has become known for his prank calls, song parodies, unique personality, and \"show stunts\" he's performed with his writing partner Sal the Stockbroker.\nChristy is currently the drummer in the heavy-metal band Charred Walls of the Damned.\nGary Dell'Abate\nGary Dell'Abate, aka Baba Booey, serves as the show's executive producer. He was hired right after graduating from Adelphi University in 1984.  Howard would call him Boy Gary and Dell'Abate briefly anglicized his name to Gary Dell.  He is mocked on the Stern Show for his appearance, gullibility (he once booked a mentally challenged woman who claimed to be Madonna's sister), and frequent mispronunciations (for example, insisting that actor Nick Nolte's last name was pronounced \"Nolt\"). He earned the nickname \"Baba Booey\" after insisting it to be the correct name of the cartoon character Baba Looey.\nSal Governale\nSalvatore \"Sal\" Governale, originally referred to as Sal the Stockbroker, began his involvement with the show in 1996 as a frequent caller. After graduating from Suffolk County Community College, Sal solicited donations for a boiler room operation in the 1990s that was later raided by federal agents. He then worked for two investment firms who were investigated and fined for questionable business practices, followed by selling illegal bootleg video of rock concerts on eBay. Stern took notice of Sal when he began making numerous calls mocking Gary Dell'Abate as a \"horse-tooth jackass\".\nDespite coming in second place in the 2004 \"Win John's Job\" contest to future writing partner Richard Christy, and losing a stand-up comedy competition to wack packer Vin The Retard in 2005, Sal was eventually hired as a prank caller and writer for the show and is currently credited as a producer.\nGovernale appeared in the 2014 comedy horror film Jersey Shore Massacre with fellow Howard Stern alumni Richard Christy.\nJ. D. Harmeyer\nBorn in December 1979 in Fairborn, Ohio, Jamie Daniel \"J. D.\" Harmeyer is Stern's head media producer. He records television shows, pulls clips from the internet, and edits together highlights from recent movies and TV. He attended Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida.\nJon Hein\nJon Hein made his first guest appearances on the show on May 3, 2001, discussing television shows that have \"jumped the shark\", a term he uses to describe when a show has passed its prime (based on an episode of the show, Happy Days, where a previously popular and well-done show clearly and memorably began to go downhill). In late 2005, while experimental programming was broadcast on Howard 100 and Howard 101, Hein presented the first edition of Superfan Roundtable. His success in on-air hosting led him to become the co-host of The Wrap-Up Show when the show moved to Sirius XM in January 2006.\nHein was a co-host on the weekly Thursday show, \"Jon Hein's TV Show\" with J. D. Harmeyer, Steve Brandano and Jenny Hutt.  He also co-hosted the weekly Friday show \"Geek Time\" with Jason Kaplan and Ralph Cirella. Both shows have since been canceled.\nJason Kaplan\nJason Kaplan is an executive producer for the show. His duties include writing the daily show rundown that appears on the show's website and taking photos that appear alongside the daily rundown. In September 2007, Jason and HowardTV director Scott DePace engaged in an intense feud stemming from their political differences.\nJason was married to his girlfriend, Janis, on November 8, 2008. Notable guests at the ceremony included Howard Stern, Robin Quivers, Gary Dell'Abate, and most of Stern's staff. The reception featured speeches from fellow staff members, Ronnie Mund and J. D. Harmeyer. Kaplan hosted \"Page 69\" along with Will Murray. On the wrap-up show on August 19, Kaplan stated that he grew up in Stanhope, New Jersey, and attended Rutgers University.\nKaplan hosted monthly episodes of The Fat Guy Show. Kaplan was a producer of the monthly show Geek Time that aired Fridays, with Jon Hein and Ralph Cirella.\nOn December 8, 2020, Kaplan stated he was an executive producer during the show's broadcast, serving alongside longtime executive producer Gary Dell'Abate.\nRonnie Mund\nRonald Mund, commonly referred to as Ronnie the Limo Driver, born October 28, 1949, was Stern's limousine driver and later his bodyguard. Ronald is 5 foot, 2 inches tall and was frequently mocked for not being able to see over the steering wheel of his limo without sitting on a stack of textbooks by Howard on air.  He later became the head of security for the Stern show studios and offices at Sirius Radio. After serving in the Air Force, Mund started a limo business. He began driving for Stern in 1986, and quickly became a character on the radio show. In 2011, Ronnie began touring night clubs around the U.S. with other talent from The Howard Stern Show on the \"Ronnie Mund Block Party.\" In March 2013, Ronnie hosted a 4-day event in Jamaica called the Ronnie Mund Jamaican Getaway.\nMund retired as Stern’s limo driver in late 2020, sold his long time Queens, New York home and retired to Las Vegas the following year. He continues to make guest appearances on the show remotely.\nWill Murray\nWill Murray is the show's researcher and segment producer. He pre-interviews all guests, and compiles pages of notes of research for Howard to use during on-air interviews. He and fellow producer Jason Kaplan hosted the Howard 100 News segment \"Page 69.\"\nOn September 5, 2008, Will married his long-time girlfriend. A Philadelphia area native, he is a huge Philadelphia sports fan, and is a graduate of Syracuse University.\nMike Trainor\nMike Trainor joined the show in 2014 as writer and producer. He became prominent on the show as the voice of a lump that was growing on Wack Packer Jeff the Drunk.  His name is not used on the program.  Instead he is often referred to on the air as \"Lump.\"\nMarci Turk\nMarci Turk is chief operating officer of Stern's channels, but her name is not used on the air. A former employee of author David Allen, she is a prominent advocator of his Getting Things Done method of time management.\nFormer staff and associates\nThe following people all saw significant air-time when they worked with Stern. Some were show staffers who left for other careers.  Some had been interns, Stern's bosses, and station support staff who for a time were all integral to the show.\nFormer radio staff\nK. C. Armstrong\nKyle Casey \"K. C.\" Armstrong (born July 17, 1975), who grew up in nearby Suffolk County, New York, had been a college football player.  He began working on the show as an intern in 1997 and later became associate producer from 1998 to 2004. In a 2005 interview, Armstrong revealed that he had been fired from the show by WXRK general manager Tom Chiusano for lapsing back into drug use after spending time in rehab.\nArmstrong was needled by Stern for his good looks and athletic body.  Some show staffers, jealous of his appearance, speculated that if he is that good-looking, he must be gay.  Armstrong eventually moved to California, where he tried to start a career in acting. He released a comedy DVD called Die Laughing. He has acted in three movies, Death4Told, Grace and the Storm, and Secret War, and appears on the comedy DVD series Meet the Creeps.\nLee Davis\n\"Boy\" Lee Davis was the original Stern show producer at WNBC before Gary Dell'Abate. He left to become the producer of the Soupy Sales show.  He moved up the ladder in station management and eventually became the general manager of sports radio station WFAN, which was the successor to WNBC at AM 660 in New York.\nShuli Egar\nShuli Egar is a comedian who first appeared on the show in June 2003. When Stern announced his planned move to Sirius and created Howard 100 News in 2005, Egar was an early hire. He was promoted to reporting about and keeping tabs on The Wack Pack.  He also filled in for Lisa G and Steve Langford when they were out.\nIn September 2020, Egar abruptly moved to Alabama from New York City out of concern for his family, who felt unsafe in their neighborhood due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and civil unrest caused by the George Floyd protests. Egar did not inform Stern of his relocation until he had already finished moving, though SiriusXM management was made aware and approved of the move. With all content for the Howard Stern Channels being created remotely rather than at the SiriusXM headquarters in New York during the pandemic, Egar was still able to contribute to the show.\nOn January 22, 2021, Egar announced on Twitter he was launching a podcast through Patreon. In the first episode of his podcast, Egar stated he was no longer happy working at the show and had not been for several years. He felt the content he was creating was being sidelined too frequently, and that he was not allowed on the air as frequently as he would have liked to be. After his move to Alabama, Egar claimed show producers took him off the assignment of covering the Wack Pack, his longtime primary role at the show. Egar resigned from the show, saying that he and the staff at the Stern Show, including Stern himself, were still on good terms, and that Stern called him upon learning of his resignation to wish him well. At the time of his departure, Egar was the only original member of the Howard 100 News team that remained on staff.\nSteve Freid\nSteve \"the Engineer\" Freid first worked with Ben Stern and later worked with Howard when he arrived at K-Rock. He gained notoriety performing as the character Wood Yi, a parody of actor/director Woody Allen. Billy West came up with the idea for the character in the early 1990s, and Steve was chosen to play the part due to having a similar-sounding voice. When performing as Wood Yi, Steve read lines supplied to him by the shows' staff, reciting them in a deadpan manner.\nGary Garver\nGary Garver was a West Coast-based correspondent for The Howard Stern Show who first started working for the show in 1991 when he was an operator at KLSX, the show's Los Angeles affiliate. He was sent to awards shows, movie premieres and television conventions to ask \"Stuttering John\"-type questions to celebrities and has-beens.\nSteve Grillo\nFormer Stern Show intern and associate producer at WXRK, known as \"Gorilla\". Howard dedicated his second book Miss America to Steve. Grillo conducted movie reviews for Howard 100 News in 2006. As homage to his former duties as a Stern show intern, he rated films by awarding them a certain number of potatoes.\nArtie Lange\nLange's first appearance on the show was as a guest alongside fellow comedian Norm Macdonald on January 8, 1998, following a bit involving Scott the Engineer and his challenge to perform 17 complete push-ups. Although appearing with Macdonald to promote the film Dirty Work, Lange had been a fan of Stern since the 1980s when he used to listen with his father. In fact, after Lange's father was paralyzed in 1987, show producer Gary Dell'Abate sent Lange an autographed jacket which Lange auctioned off for $2,000 to help support his family.\nFollowing the departure of the show's writer and comedian Jackie \"The Jokeman\" Martling in 2001, several comedians \"auditioned\" for Martling's seat by sitting in for a couple of shows. Lange's first appearance in what became known as \"The Jackie Chair\" occurred for 2&nbsp;days, on May 7 and 8, 2001. The temporary appearance consisted of being Stern's sidekick along with Quivers, and Lange frequently told personal stories, usually regarding alcohol, drugs, food and prostitutes. On October 29, 2001, Lange joined the show full-time and was voted favorite by Howard's fans in 2009.\nLange left the show in December 2009. At first the leave was thought to be temporary, but in early 2010 he attempted suicide at his apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey. The incident has not been discussed in great detail on the show and for much of 2010, Stern mentioned that Lange would return when he was healthy. However, in 2011 the show and the Howard 100 News began to reference Lange as a \"former\" staffer. On October 3, 2011, Lange began co-hosting The Nick & Artie Show with comedian Nick Di Paolo. This show aired on Directv. In April 2014, Artie was informed before the show that Directv had cancelled his show. He went on air that night for the last time as a part of the Directv team. He currently is the host of a podcast called \"The Artie Lange Uncensored Podcast.\"\nJohn Melendez\nIn 1988, Stuttering John was attending New York University's film school, and belonged to a band called \"Rock Slide\". His college roommate, Mitch Fatel, was on the verge of quitting his internship with The Howard Stern Show, when Melendez begged him for a recommendation for an internship on the show. Producer Gary Dell'Abate interviewed Melendez and mentioned his stuttering problem to Stern, who decided to hire him as a field reporter.\nOn Stern's show, Melendez conducted outrageous street interviews and appeared at press conferences, asking off-the-wall questions to various celebrities, including Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, Burt Reynolds, Tommy Lasorda, Larry King and the Dalai Lama. He also provided comic relief on the show itself with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation. Melendez left the show after being offered a half-million-dollar contract as the announcer for The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\nAl Rosenberg\nAl Rosenberg was a writer/performer for Howard on WNBC. He did numerous voice impressions including Sue Simmons and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. In The History of Howard Stern, Howard stated that he hired Al after Imus fired him so that he (Imus) could hire his girlfriend to replace Rosenberg. He stayed on at WNBC after Howard was fired because he was still under contract to the station. Al also worked on WNEW-AM radio as one half of the morning team with Bob Fitzsimmons. He also worked with Ted Brown. He later worked again for Howard on the \"Channel 9 Show\" as a writer. Al called into Stern's show in 2007 (during a Paul Mooney interview) to discuss Imus' racism. He also appeared on Howard 101's defunct \"Miserable Men\" program.\nHe served on the board of Rise, a non-profit organization and served as Deputy Mayor for East Windsor Township, New Jersey.\nAl died in late June of 2023 at 78 years old.

He was specifically praised for supporting Howard and the show at WNBC.\nScott Salem\nScott the Engineer was the show's long-time engineer, having joined on February 10, 1986. Having previously worked at WABC (AM) and WPLJ in New York City, Salem received a voice mail from Jimmy Fink, then the morning personality at WXRK informing him of his new position.\nIn 1996, the Austin American-Statesman wrote that Scott is \"always threatening to quit or on the verge of being fired, he's the show's whipping boy for technical problems\". In 2007, Salem made a onetime appearance on tour with the \"Killers of Comedy,\" performing stand-up followed by a Q&A session with the audience. Salem is an avid bowler and has competed in and appeared at several PBA tour events.\nRon Tarrant\nRon Tarrant joined the Howard Stern Channels in 2016 from Canada as the Head Imaging/Sound Designer & new voice of the Howard Stern Show/Channels.

He hosted the Miserable Men show and created a series of roasts for Stern show personalities such as Gary Dell'Abate, Artie Lange, and Wack Packers such as Daniel Carver. The placement, frequency and number of plugs given during the Stern show for Levy's off-air efforts was a constant source of tension, especially after the availability of plugs was severely restricted. After Artie's departure, Levy complained on air that some details of the situation were being \"covered up\" and blamed Howard Stern for the suicide attempt.
