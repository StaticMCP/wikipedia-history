It is named after the Romanian town of Cernavodă (Bulgarian černa vodá (черна водá in cyrillic) means 'black water').\nIt is a successor to and occupies much the same area as the earlier Karanovo culture and Gumelnița culture, for which a destruction horizon seems to be evident. It is part of the \"Balkan-Danubian complex\" that stretches up the entire length of the river and into northern Germany via the Elbe and the Baden culture; its northeastern portion is thought to be ancestral to the Usatove culture.\nIt is characterized by defensive hilltop settlements. The pottery shares traits with that found further east, in the Sredny Stog culture on the south-west Eurasian steppe; burials similarly bear a resemblance to those further east.\nIt has been theorized that Cernavodă culture, together with the Sredny Stog (Russian: Средний Стог - middle (hay)stack) culture, was the source of Anatolian languages and introduced them to Anatolia through the Balkans after Anatolian split from the Proto-Indo-European language, which some linguists and archaeologists place in the area of the Sredny Stog culture.\nGallery\nFile:Cernavoda culture metal, bone and ceramic artefacts.png|Metal, bone and ceramic artefacts\nFile:Animal-shaped scepter - National History Museum of Romania 21650.jpg|Stone horse-head sceptre\nSee also\n* Bronze Age in Romania\n* Coțofeni culture\n* Basarabi culture\n* Ottomány culture\n* Pecica culture\n* Wietenberg culture\n* Hamangia culture\n* Prehistory of Transylvania\n* Prehistoric Romania\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n* J.
