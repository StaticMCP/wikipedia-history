While he is buying a cake on his way home, a car double-parks next to his, preventing his exit. For the entire night, Chen-Mo searches for the owner of the car and encounters a succession of strange events and eccentric characters: an old couple living with their precocious granddaughter who have lost their only son; a one-armed barbershop owner cooking fish-head soup; a mainland Chinese prostitute trying to escape her pimp’s cruel clutches; and a Hong-Kong tailor embroiled in debt and captured by underground loan sharks.\nCast\n* Chang Chen as Chen Mo\n* Gwei Lun-mei as Chen Mo's Wife\n* Leon Dai as Pimp\n* Chapman To as Tailor\n* Jack Kao as Barber\n* Peggy Tseng as Hooker\n* Tou Chung-hua as Gang Leader\n* Lai-Yin Yang\n* Lin Kai-jung as Barber's Granddaughter\n* Holger Chen as Gang Member\nFestivals\n* Cannes Film Festival 2008 – Un Certain Regard\n* Montreal World Film Festival 2008\n* Bangkok International Film Festival 2008\n* Vancouver International Film Festival 2008\n* Pusan International Film Festival 2008\n* Hong Kong Asian Film Festival 2008\n* Stockholm International Film Festival 2008\n* Thessaloniki International Film Festival 2008\n* Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival 2008 – Opening Film\n* !f Istanbul International Independent Film Festival 2009\n* Spokane International Film Festival 2009\n* 2009 Adelaide Film Festival\n* Osaka Asian Film Festival 2009\n* Bradford International Film Festival 2009\n* Taiwan London Cinefest 2009\n* Barcelona Asian Film Festival\n* Silk Screen Film Festival 2009\n* Wisconsin Film Festival 2011\nAward\n* Golden Horse Award, Best Art Direction – FIPRESCI Critics Award: Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival 2008\n* Best New Talent - Audience Favourite Film: Hong Kong Asian Film Festival 2008\nSee also\n* List of films set around Mother's Day\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.evokativefilms.com/?cat=41 Canadian Distributor : Evokative Films]\n* [https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117937334.html?u=IMDB&p=H2BE&cs=1 Variety]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090204031607/http://www.timeout.com.hk/film/features/19340/parking.html Time Out Hong-Kong]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090501100520/http://www.bcmagazine.net/hk.bcmagazine.issues/bcmagazine_webissue271/20-parking.html BC Magazine]\n* [http://twitchfilm.net/site/view/wff-review-parking/ Twitchfilm]\n* [http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=38845 Screen Daily]"
