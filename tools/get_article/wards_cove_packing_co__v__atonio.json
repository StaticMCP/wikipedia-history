Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989), was a court case concerning employment discrimination, argued before the United States Supreme Court on January 18, 1989, and decided on June 5, 1989.\nWards Cove Packing Company\nWards Cove Packing Company was a cannery located in the community of Ward Cove, on the northern outskirts of the larger city of Ketchikan in the U.S. state of Alaska. The original Wards Cove Cannery was established in 1928, on Ward Cove and operated several Alaskan salmon canneries, employing about 200 people during the peak season. The company closed in 2004, and was sold to non-fishing interests.\nFacts\nA group of nonwhite cannery workers including Frank Atonio filed suit in District Court citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 complaining that the Wards Cove Packing Company, a company that operated several Alaskan salmon canneries, was using discriminatory hiring practices that resulted in a large number of the skilled permanent jobs that mostly did not involve working in a cannery (referred to as \"noncannery\" positions) to be filled by white workers, and a large number of the unskilled seasonal cannery jobs to be filled by local nonwhite workers. In this case the nonwhite workers were predominantly native Alaskans and Filipinos (Alaskeros).\nJudgments\nThe District Court found in favor of the company.\nThe workers appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the District Court decision, stating the workers had made a prima facie case of disparate impact. The decision was based on statistics provided by the workers that showed a high percentage of nonwhite workers in the cannery jobs and a low percentage of the skilled noncannery jobs filled by nonwhite workers. The court also ruled that if a substantial difference in the racial composition of the available population and the composition of the positions was found, it was up to the claimants to prove that this was due to discriminatory hiring practices.\nThe company then appealed the Court of Appeals' ruling to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court determined that the Court of Appeals had erred by using inappropriate statistics and comparison. The majority determined that the proper comparison was to compare the percentage of nonwhite workers in noncannery jobs with the percentage of the available labor pool that were nonwhite and who had the appropriate skills to perform the noncannery jobs.\nThe Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Court of Appeals with instructions to use the more appropriate comparison. Further if, on remand, the Respondents did establish a prima facie disparate-impact case, the Petitioners would then need to \"produce evidence of a legitimate business justification\" for the hiring practices that created the disparity.\nSignificance\nSoon after the decision, Congress amended Title VII with the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to counter the Supreme Court's holding in ''Ward's Cove'', thereby nullifying the case's precedent. Section 3 of the Act reads: et seq.); and\n#to respond to recent decisions of the Supreme Court by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.}}\nSee also\n* List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 490\n* List of United States Supreme Court cases\n* Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume\n* List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court\n* Hazelwood School Dist. v.
