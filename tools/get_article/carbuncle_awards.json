A \"plook\" is a Scottish noun for pimple.\n*The Pock Mark Award \"for the worst planning decision\".\n*The Zit Building Award \"for the worst building completed since the last awards\".\nPublic nominations were made via the magazine's website, with a small group of critics selecting the final winners.\nCumbernauld in North Lanarkshire won the Plook on the Plinth Award twice and was the town most frequently nominated for the award.\nThe Carbuncle Awards inspired the Carbuncle Cup, another architecture prize launched in 2006 which was given annually by Building Design magazine to \"the ugliest building in the United Kingdom completed in the last 12 months\". The latter went on to achieve somewhat greater prominence in the media, and was last held in 2018. In 2024, Soho based magazine The Fence revived the Carbuncle Cup award.\nWinners\nPlook on the Plinth Award\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Also shortlisted\n|-\n|2000\n|Airdrie\n|Cumbernauld, Campbeltown, Ardrossan and Balloch\n|-\n|2001\n|Cumbernauld\n|Gretna, Aviemore, Dumbarton and two areas of Edinburgh\n|-\n|2005\n|Cumbernauld\n| Cowdenbeath, Dalkeith, Ardrossan, Greenock and Granton (north Edinburgh)\n|-\n|2007\n|Coatbridge\n|窶能n|-\n|2009\n|Glenrothes\n|New Cumnock and Motherwell\n|-\n|2010\n|John o' Groats / Denny\n|East Kilbride, Inverness and Lochgelly\n|-\n|2011\n|Linwood\n|Nairn and Fort William\n|-\n|2013\n|New Cumnock\n|Broxburn, Fort William, Kirkintilloch, Motherwell, Newmilns and Paisley\n|-\n|2015\n|Aberdeen\n|Cumbernauld, East Kilbride and Leven\n|}\nNotes:\n*The shortlist section includes the towns that were in consideration for the award by Urban Realm\n*The 2010 award was passed to runners-up Denny, after original winners John o' Groats refused it\n*The 2005 judging panel included the artist Richard Demarco and the Sunday Herald associate editor Alan Taylor\n*The 2011 judging panel included architecture critic Mark Chalmers and Urban Realm editor John Glenday\n, winner of the Carbuncle Award in 2001 and 2005]]\nThe Zit Building Award\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Winner\n!Shortlist\n|-\n|2000\n|UGC, now Cineworld in Glasgow\n|窶能n|-\n|2001\n|Maternity hospital at Glasgow Royal Infirmary\n|Edinburgh Business Plaza The Exchange, Haymarket railway station\n|-\n|2005\n|The Pinnacle Building, Glasgow\n|窶能n|-\n|2011\n|Menie Clubhouse\n|Fraserburgh Pool and Invergordon Fabrication shed\n|-\n|2015\n|Edinburgh Airport eastern terminal expansion\n|窶能n|}\nSee also\n*Carbuncle Cup\n*Cumbernauld\n*Urban Realm\nReferences"
