All 95 seats in the Legislative Assembly were up for election, though 13 were uncontested.\nGeorge Turner's Liberal government was returned with an increased majority.\nBackground\nFormal political parties began to evolve out of faction alignments at this election. The Protectionist and Liberal Party was formed to settle disputes between several Liberal candidates standing for the same seats. The Oppositionists at this election were largely made up of Conservative MPs.\nThe National Party supported Opposition candidates, although the party also endorsed several Ministerialists, including Alfred Deakin.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-bottom:0\"\n|+ Legislative Assembly (FPTP)\n! style=\"width:10px;\" colspan=3 | Party\n! style=\"width:70px;\"| Votes\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| %\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Swing\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Seats\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| Change\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Liberal Ministerialists\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 118,237\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 63.69\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 55\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|\n|-\n| | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Oppositionist\n| 45,711\n| 24.63\n|\n| 32\n|\n|-\n|  | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| United Labour\n| style=\"width:70px;\"| 19,371\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 10.44\n| style=\"width:45px;\"|\n| style=\"width:40px;\"| 8\n| style=\"width:55px;\"|\n|-\n| | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Clerical Party\n| 1,804\n| 0.97\n| +0.97\n| 0\n|\n|-\n| | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| Independent\n| 345\n| 0.19\n|\n| 0\n|\n|-\n| | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"| People's Liberal and Independent Labor\n| 152\n| 0.08\n| +0.08\n| 0\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Formal votes\n| 185,620\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Informal votes\n| 895\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Total\n| 186,455\n|\n|\n| 95\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| &nbsp;Registered voters / turnout\n| 254,155\n| 63.41\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\nAftermath\nIn November 1899, Turner lost a vote of confidence when many rural Liberals abandoned him. Allan McLean, the member for Gippsland North, then formed a more conservative administration. The McLean-led Ministerialists lost the 1900 election, and Turner returned to power.\nNotes\nReferences"
