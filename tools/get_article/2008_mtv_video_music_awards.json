Nominations for a majority of the categories were announced on the MTV program FNMTV after being selected through viewer online voting at MTV.com. The remaining, professional categories were chosen by a panel of music industry professionals and announced via press release on August 27. When the nomination process was first announced, it mentioned a previously-unheard professional category named \"Best Story;\" however, this award did not come to fruition when the list of professional nominees was revealed the following month.\nUnlike previous editions of the show, MTV announced the winners to the professional categories three days before the ceremony (September 4) via a press release, rather than on the pre-show or main show. The rest of the winners were announced during the ceremony. Comedian Russell Brand hosted the event.\nThis year's awards were a huge improvement ratings-wise, seeing a 19% rise on last year with 8.4 million viewers. It was also a 23% advance over the 5.76 million who saw the 2006 ceremony. Although ratings improved, this year's video music awards was hosted at its smallest venue of its 25-year history. Britney Spears became the main winner of the night, walking away with her first three Moonmen: Video of the Year, Best Female Video, and Best Pop Video all for \"Piece of Me\".\nThe Pussycat Dolls received the most nominations (6), followed by Chris Brown and Katy Perry (5).\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are in bold text.\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" | Video of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" | Best Male Video\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Britney Spears – \"Piece of Me\"\n**Chris Brown – \"Forever\"\n**Jonas Brothers – \"Burnin' Up\"\n**The Pussycat Dolls – \"When I Grow Up\"\n**The Ting Tings – \"Shut Up and Let Me Go\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Chris Brown – \"With You\"\n**Flo Rida (featuring T-Pain) – \"Low\"\n**Lil Wayne (featuring Static Major) – \"Lollipop\"\n**T.I. – \"No Matter What\"\n**Usher (featuring Young Jeezy) – \"Love in This Club\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" | Best Female Video\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" | Best New Artist\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Britney Spears – \"Piece of Me\"\n**Mariah Carey – \"Touch My Body\"\n**Katy Perry – \"I Kissed a Girl\"\n**Rihanna – \"Take a Bow\"\n** Jordin Sparks (featuring Chris Brown) – \"No Air\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Tokio Hotel – \"Ready, Set, Go!\"\n**Miley Cyrus – \"7 Things\"\n**Katy Perry – \"I Kissed a Girl\"\n**Jordin Sparks (featuring Chris Brown) – \"No Air\"\n**Taylor Swift – \"Teardrops on My Guitar\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" | Best Pop Video\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" | Best Rock Video\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Britney Spears – \"Piece of Me\"\n**Danity Kane – \"Damaged\"\n**Jonas Brothers – \"Burnin' Up\"\n**Panic at the Disco – \"Nine in the Afternoon\"\n**Tokio Hotel – \"Ready, Set, Go!\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Linkin Park – \"Shadow of the Day\"\n**Fall Out Boy (featuring John Mayer) – \"Beat It\"\n**Foo Fighters – \"The Pretender\"\n**Paramore – \"Crushcrushcrush\"\n**Slipknot – \"Psychosocial\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" | Best Hip-Hop Video\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" | Best Dancing in a Video\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*Lil Wayne (featuring Static Major) – \"Lollipop\"\n**Mary J.

Jordin Sparks, who also wears a purity ring, began her introduction of T.I. and Rihanna by saying, \"It's not bad to wear a promise ring because not everybody, guy or girl, wants to be a slut.\" Sparks was criticized for implying that those who do not wear purity rings or do not abstain are promiscuous.\nBrand later described the experience, and aftermath, during his 2009 comedy special 'Scandalous - Live At The O2'.\nCensorship\nIn repeat airings all references to John McCain and George W. Bush were removed from Russell Brand's opening monologue.\nPromotion\nSeveral Promos were made that featured host Russell Brand and MTV regulars Britney Spears, Pete Wentz, and LL Cool J. Britney Spears' promos were given a lot of attention. The promos featured Spears and Brand in a Paramount lot ad-libbing while an elephant was positioned in the background, reference to \"the elephant in the room\", rumored to be her criticized 2007 VMA performance, which they refrained from discussing in the commercials.\nThere was also a promotion that appeared on Nickelodeon, featuring the cast of iCarly.\nDuring the program, the MTV networks VH1, MTV Hits, and MTV Jams did not air their usual programming at all, instead displaying full-screen cards guiding viewers to watch the ceremony on MTV, with VH1 using a rotating \"billboard\" of sponsors to promote 'sneak peeks' of the live ceremony which appeared in the top-left corner with false crowd noise in the background. During the VMA commercial breaks, VH1 also carried regular advertising.\nSee also\n*2008 MTV Europe Music Awards\nNotes and references\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080828041555/http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2008/ 2008 MTV Video Music Awards website]"
