Virginia voters chose 24 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.\nIncumbent Democratic-Republican President Thomas Jefferson won with an overwhelming majority of nearly 99.5%, as well as all electoral votes, making this one of the states with the highest percentage of votes for him in the 1804 presidential election, behind only Kentucky, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. This was also the highest percentage ever in the state's presidential election history since George Washington's 1788–89 and 1792 records, until 1816.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |1804 United States presidential election in Virginia\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party\n! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes\n! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage\n! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#008000; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Democratic-Republican\n|Thomas Jefferson\n| align=\"right\" |12,926\n| align=\"right\" |99.42%\n| align=\"right\" |24\n|-\n|-\n! style=\"background-color:#EA9978; width: 3px\" |\n| style=\"width: 130px\" |Federalist\n|Charles Cotesworth Pinckney\n| align=\"right\" |75\n| align=\"right\" |0.58%\n| align=\"right\" |0\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\"\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" |Totals\n| align=\"right\" |13,001\n| align=\"right\" |100.00%\n| align=\"right\" |24\n|}\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Virginia\nReferences"
