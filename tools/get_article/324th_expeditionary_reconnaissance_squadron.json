It is assigned to the 409th Air Expeditionary Group at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy.\nThe squadron was first activated in 1942 as the 324th Bombardment Squadron.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the European Theater of Operations, where it participated in participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany from late 1942 until V-E Day, earning two Distinguished Unit Citations.  Following the end of the war, it returned to the United States and was inactivated in November 1945.\nThe unit was activated as the 324th Reconnaissance Squadron under Strategic Air Command in 1947.  The following year it moved to McGuire Air Force Base and began to equip with bombers modified for long range reconnaissance.  It continued in the strategic reconnaissance role until 1957, when it was inactivated.\nIn 2009, the squadron was converted to provisional status as the 324th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron and assigned to United States Air Forces Europe to activate or inactivate as needed.\nHistory\nWorld War II\nOrganization and training in the United States\nThe squadron was first activated on 15 April 1942 at Harding Field as the 324th Bombardment Squadron, one of the three original bombardment squadrons of the 91st Bombardment Group.  It was equipped with the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress.  It completed First Phase training at MacDill Field under Third Air Force, with Second and Third Phase training at Walla Walla Army Air Field under Second Air Force in Washington.  The squadron's ground echelon left for Fort Dix in early September 1942, then boarded the  for transport to England.  The air echelon moved to Gowen Field, Idaho on 24 August 1942, and began receiving new B-17s there.  It becan flying them from Dow Field, Maine in September, although it was not fully equipped with new aircraft until October.\nCombat in Europe\nThe ground echelon was established temporarily at RAF Kimbolton by 13 September 1942.  However, the runways at Kimbolton were not up to handling heavy bombers, and the unit moved to what would be its permanent station in the European Theater of Operations, RAF Bassingbourn, on 14 October 1942.  Bassingbourn had been a prewar Royal Air Force station, so the squadron found itself in more comfortable quarters than most of its contemporaries.  The squadron primarily engaged in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany, and flew its first mission on 7 November, an attack against submarine pens at Brest, France.\nUntil the middle of 1943, The squadron concentrated its attacks on naval targets, including submarine pens, dockyards, ship construction facilities and harbors, although it also struck airfields, factories, and communications facilities.  On 27 January 1943, the unit attacked the Kriegsmarine yard at Wilhelmshaven as part of the first penetration by bombers of VIII Bomber Command to a target in Germany.  On 4 March 1943, it attacked marshalling yards at Hamm, Germany despite adverse weather and heavy enemy opposition.  For this action, it was awarded its first Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC).\nFrom the middle of 1943 to the end of the war, the squadron concentrated on attacks on German aviation, including attacks on aircraft factories, including ones at Oranienburg and Brussels; airfields at Oldenburg and Villacoublay; the ball bearing plants at Schweinfurt; chemical plants at Leverkusen and Peenemunde; and industrial facilities in Ludwigshafen, Frankfurt am Main and Wilhemshaven.  As part of this attack on the German aircraft industry, on 11 January, the squadron penetrated into central Germany, despite bad weather, poor fighter cover, and strong attacks by enemy interceptor aircraft, the unit succeeded in bombing its target, earning a second DUC.\nThe squadron also performed interdiction and air support missions.  It helped prepare for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, by bombing gun emplacements and troop concentrations near the beachhead area.  It aided Operation Cobra, the breakout at Saint Lo, in July 1944 by attacking enemy troop positions.  It supported troops on the front lines near Caen in August 1944 and attacked lines of communications near the battlefield during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945.  It attacked airfields, bridges, and railroads to support Operation Lumberjack, the push across the Rhine in Germany, in 1945.\nFollowing V-E Day, the squadron evacuated prisoners of war from German camps. The first B-17 left Bassingbourn for the United States on 27 May 1945.  The ground echelon sailed aboard the  on 24 June 1945. The squadron was reestablished at Drew Field, Florida in early July, with the intention of deploying it to the Pacific, but it was not fully manned or equipped, and inactivated on 7 November 1945.\nStrategic reconnaissance\nThe squadron was reactivated in July 1947 at Andrews Field, Maryland as the 324th Reconnaissance Squadron. It moved to McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey in July 1948, where it was redesignated the 324th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron in November. The squadron does not appear to have been operational until 1949, when it began equipping with both bomber and reconnaissance models of the Flying Fortress and Boeing B-29 Superfortress.  In October 1949 it moved to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, where it began to fly the North American RB-45 Tornado in 1950.\nStrategic Air Command (SAC) decided its wing commanders should focus on combat operations, while the air base group commander would manage base housekeeping functions. Under this plan the wing's combat squadrons reported directly to the wing and the intermediate group was eliminated.  In February 1951, the 91st Group became nonoperational and the squadron was assigned directly to the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing.  In September 1951 the squadron moved to Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio, where it re-equipped with Boeing RB-47E Stratojets in 1953.  The squadron frequently provided crews and aircraft to detachments of the 91st Wing that performed reconnaissance in overseas areas.  Between August and November 1956, most of the squadron was deployed overseas and was operationally controlled by another organization. It continued worldwide reconnaissance missions until inactivating in November 1957.\nProvisional unit\nIn 2009, the squadron was converted to provisional status as the 324th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron and assigned to United States Air Forces Europe to activate or inactivate as needed.  It was active at Ramstein Air Base, Germany from July to December 2009 and again from March to June of 2010.  It was active agan at Naval Station Rota, Spain from July to October 2010.  It was most recently activated at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, Italy in March 2011, and has been part of the 409th Air Expeditionary Group since 2012.   It performs launch and recovery operations supporting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft; first with the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator and currently the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. The 324th provides the Commander of Air Forces Africa with real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and kinetic strike in support of counter-terrorism campaign plans through MQ-9 launch, recovery and maintenance.\nLineage\n* Constituted as the 324th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 28 January 1942\n: Activated on 15 April 1942\n* Redesignated 324th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy on 10 August 1943\n: Inactivated on 7 November 1945\n* Redesignated 324th Reconnaissance Squadron on 11 June 1947\n: Activated on 1 July 1947\n* Redesignated 324th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron on 10 November 1948\n: Redesignated 324th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, Medium on 6 July 1950\n: Inactivated on 8 November 1957\n* Converted to provisional status, redesignated 324th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron on 25 June 2009 and assigned to United States Air Forces Europe to activate or inactivate as needed\n:: Activated on 2 July 2009\n:: Inactivated on 9 December 2009\n:: Activated on 26 March 2010\n:: Inactivated on 1 June 2010\n:: Activated on 28 July 2010\n:: Inactivated on 1 October 2010\n:: Activated on 25 March 2011\nAssignments\n* 91st Bombardment Group, 15 April 1942 – 7 November 1945\n* 91st Reconnaissance Group (later 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Group), 1 July 1947 (attached to 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing after 10 February 1951)\n* 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, 28 May 1952 – 8 November 1957\n* 404th Air Expeditionary Group, 2 July 2009 – 9 December 2009\n* 404th Air Expeditionary Group, 26 March 2010 – 1 June 2010\n* 404th Air Expeditionary Group, 28 July 2010 – 1 October 2010\n* United States Air Forces in Europe, 25 March 2011 (attached to Seventeenth Air Force)\n* 404th Air Expeditionary Group, 30 March 2010 (attached to 100th Operations Group)\n* 409th Air Expeditionary Group, 1 March 2012\nStations\n* Harding Field, Louisiana, 15 April 1942\n* MacDill Field, Florida, 13 May 1942\n* Walla Walla Army Air Base, Washington, 22 June – 24 August 1942\n* RAF Kimbolton (AAF-117), England, 13 September 1942 (ground echelon), early October 1942 (air echelon)\n* RAF Bassingbourn (AAF-121), England, 14 October 1942 – 23 June 1945\n* Drew Field, Florida, 3 July – 7 November 1945\n* Andrews Field (later Andrews Air Force Base), Maryland, 1 July 1947\n* McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, 19 July 1948\n* Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, 1 October 1949\n* Lockbourne Air Force Base, Ohio, 11 September 1951 – 8 November 1957\n* Ramstein Air Base, Germany, 2 July 2009 – 9 December 2009\n* Ramstein Air Base, Germany, 26 March 2010 – 1 June 2010\n* Naval Station Rota, Spain, 28 July 2010 – 1 October 2010\n* Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, Italy, 25 March 2011\nAircraft\n* Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, 1942–1945\n* Boeing RB-17 Flying Fortress, 1948–1949\n* Boeing RB-29 Superfortress, 1949–1950\n* North American RB-45 Tornado, 1950–1953\n* Boeing RB-47E Stratojet, 1953–1957\n* General Atomics MQ-1B Predator, 2011-unknown\n* General Atomics MQ-9A Reaper, 2011-unknown\nAwards and campaigns\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!
