The subsequent sections highlight outline some of these inconsistencies.\nBackground\nThe collapse of autocratic regimes, like Iran, is often caused by large-scale public mobilization and collective action. Individuals' decision to participate in strikes and protests is based on their perception of others' willingness to do the same. Consequently, autocratic governments, frequently manipulate economic data to shape public perceptions of the economy's condition. Empirical evidence indicates that such regimes may inflate reported growth rates by as much as 35%. By projecting an artificially optimistic economic outlook, these governments seek to suppress the belief that economic hardship is widespread, thereby minimizing public discontent and reducing the likelihood of mass demonstrations or potential regime change.\nEconomic growth\nEconomic researcher Youhana Najdi critiques the Iranian government's portrayal of the nation's economic health in 2019. Najdi argued that officials, including President Hassan Rouhani, have consistently presented an overly optimistic view of Iran's economy, which starkly contrasts with assessments from international organizations and the lived experiences of Iranian citizens. For instance, while Rouhani claimed that Iran had the highest growth rate globally in 2017, data from the World Bank indicated that countries like Armenia, Tanzania, Thailand, and India experienced higher growth rates during that period. Najdi asserts that such discrepancies highlight a deliberate effort by Iranian authorities to misrepresent economic realities, aiming to downplay the impact of international sanctions and internal mismanagement. This manipulation of economic data, according to Najdi, is a longstanding practice within the regime, employed by both conservative and reformist factions to maintain power and suppress dissent.\nIn early 2020, conflicting reports emerged regarding Iran's economic performance for the first nine months of 2019. That year, Iran's Minister of Economy, Farhad Dejpasand, asserted that the agricultural sector had experienced economic growth and that the industrial sector had expanded by 7.5%, signaling positive growth in the non-oil economy. In contrast, Iran's Statistical Center reported an overall economic contraction of 7.6% when accounting for oil revenues and zero growth when excluding oil.\nSimilarly, former President Hassan Rouhani's claim of 7.4% economic growth during his tenure was met with skepticism from Iranian economists and lawmakers. Critics contended that the reported figures did not align with industrial output or employment trends.\nUnemployment\nIran's Statistical Center reported in the end of 2023 a decline in the country's unemployment rate to 7.6% in the fall of 2023, down from 10.6% in the same period in 2019. However, this decrease is attributed not to job creation but to a significant number of individuals, approximately 3.6 million, exiting the labor force after becoming discouraged in their job search. If those individuals were still seeking employment, the actual unemployment rate would exceed 18%. About 43% of the job seekers hold academic degrees. Additionally, only about 11.4% of Iranian women of working age are employed.\nThe state-run Donya-e-Eqtesad newspaper also highlighted that the reported decrease in unemployment rates does not reflect tangible improvements in the country's economic growth or the daily lives of its citizens. According to official reports, the labor force participation rate was 41.3% in autumn 2023, with an overall unemployment rate of 8.1% for that year. However, these figures can be misleading, as a decline in the unemployment rate may result not only from individuals securing jobs but also from discouraged job seekers exiting the labor market.\nIranian former president Ebrahim Raisi has claimed significant reductions in the country's unemployment rate in 2023, asserting the creation of nearly two million jobs over the past two years. However, these claims have been met with skepticism and criticism. Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) labeled the government's employment statistics as \"unrealistic,\" suggesting that officials manipulate data to present a more favorable economic situation. As of October 2023, the Statistical Center of Iran reported approximately 2.043 million unemployed individuals, with university graduates comprising 42.8% of this figure. Critics argue that the government's narrative fails to address the underlying economic challenges and the high unemployment rate among educated citizens.\nInflation\nThe official inflation rate in Iran in 2023 was 44.58%, However the excessive price increases, particularly of food, led people to perceive inflation rates as higher than the official figures. The table below compares the price inflation in Tehran versus that in Berlin between 2010 and 2023, according to Numbeo.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Product\n!From year\n!To year\n!Avg. price increase Tehran\n!Avg. price increase Berlin\n|-\n|Milk\n|2010\n|2023\n|140%\n|65%\n|-\n|Bread\n|2010\n|2023\n|235%\n| -1%\n|-\n|Eggs\n|2010\n|2023\n|163%\n|98%\n|-\n|Rice\n|2011\n|2023\n|112%\n|40%\n|-\n|Chicken fillets\n|2011\n|2023\n|185%\n|42%\n|-\n|Potatoes\n|2012\n|2023\n|199%\n|118%\n|}\nIn 2024, The minimum cost of living in Iran was estimated at $500, yet workers' wages stood at a mere $136. The rapid erosion in the purchasing power of salaries raised a suspicion that the true inflation rate is higher than the reported one. Moreover, Iranian media stated that the true inflation rate in 2023 was 70%.\nAcademic studies\nIran suffers from over-education and over-supply of academic degrees. In 2015–2016, over 4.3 million students were enrolled in universities in Iran, which accounts for more than 5% of the country's total population, or 7.4% of its adult population (aged 19 and above). In comparison, in 2016, 20.4 million students, or a little over 6% of the U.S. population (8.3% of the U.S. adult population aged 19 and above), attended college. The U.S. economy was then approximately 47 times that of Iran's, and many of the graduates from U.S. colleges and universities were foreign nationals, who will likely contribute to the labor forces of their home countries.\nThe considerable wage premium to degrees, which does not take into account the quality of the degree, created an industry of fake degrees. These counterfeit credentials are sold to those who seek to improve their career prospects or gain political favor. This market is not limited to lower-tier degrees but also extends to advanced academic qualifications, including doctoral degrees, which are often seen as essential for gaining prestige and advancing within the professional world. The cost of such degrees can be substantial, with PhD diplomas priced as high as $9,000.\nIn April 2013, BBC quoted an interview with Jafar Mehrad, head of the Islamic World Science Citation Database (ISC), in which Mehrad stated that Iran produced 2.325% of the total number of academic chemistry papers published in 2012. In addition, Kamran Daneshjo, Minister of Science, Research and Technology, was also quoted as saying that Iran's scientific production increased seven-fold since 2005, and that the country's position in the ISI database rose from 37th to 17th place. The Supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, reportedly has always boasted about the large number of publications, stating that it was a sign of power. Allegedly, the reason for this climb in prominence is due to the incentives for research and the publication of scientific articles promoted by the Iranian government, from financial benefits to career advancement. However, in 2023 Iran was announced to be among the countries with the highest rate of retracted scientific papers.\nThe table below presents the average salaries for government officials of the same rank in 2025, differentiated by their levels of higher education.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Degree\n!Salary\n|-\n|High school education\n|547,200,700 IRR\n|-\n|Certificate or diploma\n|627,600,400 IRR\n|-\n|Bachelor's degree\n|845,998,100 IRR\n|-\n|Master's degree\n|1,064,400,600 IRR\n|-\n|Doctorate\n|1,322,097,006 IRR\n|}\nAlireza Ahmadi, has stated that academics are further incentivized to publish due to greatly increased competition of a large number of Iranian students over few available academic positions, coupled with anxiety over an unclear financial future. In May 2013, BBC reported that this situation gave rise to an industry of fraudulent research papers and a commercial exchange for undergraduate projects, Master's theses and PhD dissertations. Authorities did not react to this state of affairs, reportedly because it assists them in advancing their own reputation. This situation has created a culture of prioritizing credentials over actual education in Iran, and eventually widespread plagiarism. In December 2009 Nature reported that among the alleged culprits of plagiarism were a number of government ministers and officials. In a response to that report, The Iran chapter of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World confirmed that the Iranian political class is unusual in its requirement of academic credentials, as a university degree is a \"prerequisite for election to parliament\" and \"the Iranian political class, across the political and ideological spectrum, accounts for a disproportionate share of academic fraud.\" In June 2023, the Iranian parliament announced that more than half the Master's theses written in Iran between 2019 and 2022 were fraudulent. In December 2023, Nature reported that Iran ranked seventh in the list of countries with the largest number of retracted scientific articles, the reasons for retraction being violation of \"ethical and professional guidelines due to scientific misconduct or plagiarism\".\nReferences"
