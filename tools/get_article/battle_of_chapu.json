Gough accompanied the right column, which landed first on May 16. The remaining troops moved round to the rear of the enemy thereby cutting their communications with Zhapu. Meanwhile, the accompanying steamers began a bombardment of the city's defences. In Gough's own words: \"The enemy were completely taken by surprise; as usual, they were unprepared for anything except a frontal attack. They gave way on all sides and took to flight, with the exception of a body of some 300 Tartar troops who seized a small joss-house, and held it with indomitable pluck and perseverance.\"\nMultiple assaults proved necessary to capture the joss-house with casualties suffered on both sides; eventually it fell and after each of the gates had been captured, the city fell to the British. Not without cost and Gough lost one of his most accomplished field commanders Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Tomlinson who was killed personally leading a breaching party of the 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment of Foot.\nAftermath\nThe British did not remain in Zhapu long. They captured the city's ordnance and destroyed its arsenals before moving on to attack Wusong.\nHailing, the Manchu commander at Zhenjiang, received the report of Zhapu's surrender on June 18. The Manchus committed mass suicide while the Han Chinese discussed the situation with the British. When hostilities ceased, Chinese official Yilibu returned sixteen kidnapped British soldiers to Gough in \"recognition of his courtesy in releasing the Chinese captured at Chapoo\".\nGallery\nFile:Engagement at joss-house.jpg | Engagement at the joss house\nFile:Joss House, Chapoo 1842.jpg | Joss House, Chapoo.
