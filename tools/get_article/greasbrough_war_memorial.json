It was erected to commemorate local residents who died in military service during the First World War. Additional names were added following the Second World War.\nHistory\nFollowing the end of the First World War, local residents formed a committee to raise funds for a permanent memorial through public subscription. The memorial was unveiled in 1925. After the Second World War, additional names were inscribed to commemorate those who died in that conflict.\nDesign and description\nThe memorial is made of Portland stone and takes the form of a Celtic cross on a stepped base and plinth. A carved wreath is present on the shaft. The names of the fallen from both World Wars are inscribed on the front, along with a dedication.\nThe memorial is surrounded by a small garden area enclosed by iron railings, which are separately listed. Seasonal flowers are planted around the base, and the site is maintained by local volunteers and the Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council.\nHeritage status\nOn 19 February 1986, the memorial was designated as a listed building at Grade II for its architectural and historic interest.\nCommunity and commemoration\nAn annual Remembrance Sunday service is held at the site in November, involving veterans, residents, the Royal British Legion, and local schools. The event includes wreath-laying and a two-minute silence.\nNotable names\nSome of the individuals commemorated served in the York and Lancaster Regiment and the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry. Further details are available in local records and archival sources.\nSee also\n* Rotherham\nReferences"
