Thus delegating the selection problem to the build system.\nSome distributions like MSYS and Cygwin may help build the cross-platform code in a Unix-like environment even on Microsoft Windows. Both distributions provide a decent version of GNU Make that can direct the build process in a cross-platform fashion.\nSee also\n* Adaptive Communication Environment\n* Boost C++ libraries\n* GTK+\n* Netscape Portable Runtime\n* Simple DirectMedia Layer\n* wxWidgets\nReferences"
