He played college baseball for Oxnard College before transferring to the University of Arkansas, and helping pitch the Arkansas Razorbacks, to the 1985 College World Series. Hilton was the starting pitcher in the fourth game in which his team was eliminated in extra innings.\nThe Cardinals drafted him in the 22nd round of the 1985 Major League Baseball Draft. After five seasons in the Cardinals' farm system, in which he went 33–30 with a 2.97 earned run average, Hilton made the team out of Spring training in 1990.

He entered the final game of the three-game series with the Expos with one out in the eighth, and finished the game. It turned out to be his final major league appearance before he was optioned back to the triple A Louisville Redbirds.\nHilton was released during Spring training in , and joined the San Diego Padres' organization. He remained with them through .\nHilton died on July 12, 2011, at Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura, California.
