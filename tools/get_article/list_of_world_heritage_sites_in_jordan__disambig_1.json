Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural heritage consists of natural features (physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation, or natural beauty. Jordan accepted the convention on 5 May 1975.\nThere are seven World Heritage Sites listed in Jordan, with a further 14 on the tentative list. The first two sites inscribed to the list were Petra and Qusayr 'Amra, both listed in 1985. The most recent inscription was Umm el-Jimal, listed in 2024. Six sites are listed for their cultural significance while Wadi Rum is listed both for cultural and natural significance. Jordan has served on the World Heritage Committee twice.\nWorld Heritage Sites\nUNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria. Criteria i through vi are cultural, and vii through x are natural.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\" scope=\"col\"| Site\n! class=\"unsortable\"  style=\"width:150px;\" scope=\"col\"| Image\n! style=\"width:80px;\" scope=\"col\"| Location (governorate)\n! style=\"width:50px;\" scope=\"col\" | Year listed\n! style=\"width:60px;\" scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Petra\n|\n| Ma'an\n| 1985\n| 326; i, iii, iv (cultural)\n| The Nabataean city of Petra was a major trading hub between Arabia, Egypt, and Syria Phoenicia, with trade links extending as far as to India and China.
