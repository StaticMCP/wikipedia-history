The primary was a closed primary (only open to party members) although unenrolled voters were permitted to enroll in a party at the polls with same day registration.\nThe primary was held along with a people's veto referendum to reject changes to Maine's vaccination laws.\nResults\nIncumbent President Donald Trump was the only candidate to qualify for the ballot. His 84% share of the vote was his lowest performance of any state in the primaries. Several town clerks speculated that the high number of blank votes cast was due to Republican voters being more interested in voting in the anti-vaccination people's veto referendum than in the primary.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"background-color:#f2f2f2;margin-bottom:-1px;border:1px solid #aaa;padding:0.2em 0.4em\" |2020 Maine Republican primary\n!Candidate\n!Votes\n!%\n!Delegates\n|-\n|\n|95,360\n|83.85\n|22\n|-\n|Blank votes\n|18,368\n|16.15\n|0\n|- style=\"background-color:#F6F6F6\"\n! style=\"text-align:right;\" |Total\n! style=\"text-align:right;\" |113,728\n! style=\"text-align:right;\" |100%\n! style=\"text-align:right;\" |22\n|}\nResults by county\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"6\" |2020 Maine Republican primary\n(results per county)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |County\n! colspan=\"2\" |Donald Trump\n! colspan=\"2\" |Blank votes\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Total votes cast\n|-\n!Votes\n!%\n!Votes\n!%\n|-\n|Androscoggin\n|7,221\n|87.14\n|1,066\n|12.86\n|8,287\n|-\n|Aroostook\n|4,560\n|88.25\n|607\n|11.75\n|5,167\n|-\n|Cumberland\n|15,943\n|77.39\n|4,658\n|22.61\n|20,601\n|-\n|Franklin\n|2,592\n|81.77\n|578\n|18.23\n|3,170\n|-\n|Hancock\n|4,334\n|83.19\n|876\n|16.81\n|5,210\n|-\n|Kennebec\n|9,473\n|84.08\n|1,793\n|15.92\n|11,266\n|-\n|Knox\n|3,037\n|81.66\n|682\n|18.34\n|3,719\n|-\n|Lincoln\n|3,193\n|82.23\n|690\n|17.77\n|3,883\n|-\n|Oxford\n|4,299\n|84.23\n|805\n|15.77\n|5,104\n|-\n|Penobscot\n|11,901\n|87.78\n|1,656\n|12.22\n|13,557\n|-\n|Piscataquis\n|1,699\n|88.12\n|229\n|11.88\n|1,928\n|-\n|Sagadahoc\n|2,942\n|83.70\n|573\n|16.30\n|3,515\n|-\n|Somerset\n|4,403\n|88.47\n|574\n|11.53\n|4,977\n|-\n|Waldo\n|3,429\n|85.28\n|592\n|14.72\n|4,021\n|-\n|Washington\n|2,828\n|87.96\n|387\n|12.04\n|3,215\n|-\n|York\n|13,435\n|83.93\n|2,572\n|16.07\n|16,007\n|-\n!UOCAVA\n!71\n!70.30\n!30\n!29.70\n!101\n|-\n!Total\n!95,360\n!83.85\n!18,368\n!16.15\n!113,728\n|}\n|\n|\n}}\n|image2=2020MEGOPpresidentialprimariesdistrict.svg\n|alt2=congressional district\n|caption2=Congressional districts won by these popular vote results\n|\n}}\n}}\nSee also\n* 2020 Maine Democratic presidential primary\nReferences"
