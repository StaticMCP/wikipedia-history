They split in 1999 with singer Péter Eszenyi  leaving the band. Several singers were drafted to replace him, including Marci Lombos and Chris Alexander, but none of them stayed for long. In 2006 they started playing together again with Eszenyi as singer. Bassist Bálint Gátos has been replaced with Péter Szabó (Igor, HAW) at concerts during the 2010s. They haven't been active in the 2020s.\nIn the 1990s they played at several high-profile gigs and festivals including Sziget Festival in Budapest and Volt Festival in Sopron, as well as opening for Dog Eat Dog, Bon Jovi, Biohazard and KISS.\nThe band took their name from the song War Pigs by British heavy metal rockers Black Sabbath from their 1970 album, Paranoid. Faith No More, which influenced the music of Warpigs, also did a cover of this song on their album The Real Thing. The song talks about war and the absurdities of those who make war without regard to the powerless people who are sent to die. It's sometimes called a protest song.\nTheir first video, Szandál, was directed by Nimród Antal, who later used the same idea for his first major motion picture Kontroll (2003). He and the band members came up with the idea for the video together, however, they are uncredited on Kontroll.\nHungarian Olympic champion water polo player Gergely Kiss is one of their biggest fans.\nGábor Eszenyi has since joined a new band called Jamestown in London where both he and his brother Peter now live. Peter Eszenyi is a visual effects (VFX) supervisor.\nTheir single Monte Carlo is still regularly played on radio stations.\nMembers\n*Singer: Péter \"Petas\" Eszenyi (sometimes credited as Peter Eszenyi)\n*Drums: Gábor \"Hekk\" Eszenyi\n*Guitar: György \"Jimbo\" Újhelyi\n*Bass: Péter \"Pó\" Szabó\n*Bass: Bálint Gátos (currently not a member)\n*Keyboard: Peter \"Dudu\" Dózsa (currently not a member)\n*Extra Vocals: Bence Balázs (currently not a member)\nDiscography\n*Collected (1995, demo)\n*Rapid (1997 Polygram)\n*Quartz (1999 Polygram/3T) produced by Emmy-winning recording engineer Donal Hodgson.\n*Analóg (2000, EP)\nAwards and nominations\n*Rapid was nominated for the Golden Giraffe Award in 1998.
