The medal was established in 1920, during the colonial period. The medal was granted to the chiefs within the numerous African, Asian, American and Pacific colonies and mandated territories that made up the then very extensive British Empire. The medal is no longer awarded.\nMedals were struck bearing the effigies of George V, George VI, and Elizabeth II. The earliest versions of the medal were worn on a silver chain.  Later medals were suspended from a yellow ribbon with two white stripes for the gold medal and yellow with a single white center stripe for the silver medal.\nMedal designs\nIn 1920, the medal was a silver oval 67&nbsp;mm by 50.2&nbsp;mm on a silver chain 78&nbsp;cm in length. The links of the chain took the form of Tudor roses, the royal monogram \"GRI\", and crowns. The design was by Sir Bertram Mackennal. On the obverse was the effigy of the King-Emperor George V surrounded by the inscription GEORGE V KING AND EMPEROR. The reverse depicts a freighter and a battleship in a tropical port.\nIn 1953 the medal was a silver oval 67.8&nbsp;mm by 50&nbsp;mm on a silver chain 82&nbsp;cm in length. The links were in the form of Tudor roses, the royal monogram \"EIIR\", and crowns. The obverse bears the effigy of Elizabeth II by Cecil Thomas surrounded by the inscription QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SECOND''. The reverse remained unchanged between versions.\nAfter 1953, the medals were hung from a yellow ribbon with white stripes. The medals followed the prior obverse and reverse designs but were of a smaller size, 49.9&nbsp;mm by 33.9&nbsp;mm. This medal was struck by the Royal Mint.\nReferences"
