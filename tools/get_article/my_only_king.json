It was released in English by Digital Manga Publishing on March 15, 2006.\nReception\nJulie Rosato viewed Hoshino's feminine uke designs as a flaw, and thought that each of the stories weren't given enough space to develop properly. Phil Guie was confused as to what the theme of the anthology was, but noted that most of the stories are lighthearted. Joanna Draper Carlson thought the main story of the volume ended too \"abruptly\", and also criticised the feminine uke designs.\nReferences"
