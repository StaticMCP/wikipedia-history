Upon the death of his childless grandson, Lalangina was united with Mango.\nRafianarana – Andriampianarana ruled Lalangina independently from  Mango. His brother Andrianantara, king of Mango, both ruled Lalangina and Vohibato after Rafianarana's subjects killed his cruel son Andrianonifoloalina.\nLalangina and Vohibato split after the death of Andrianantara's grandson Rahasamanarivo. Andrianonindranarivo started the dynasty that ruled Lalangina until the French conquest.\nKing Raonimanalina of Lalangina resisted the merina expansion of Andrianampoinimerina and he was killed in battle. The kingdom was divided among his sons. He was succeeded by his sister Andriambavizanaka who negotiated peace with Andrianampoinimerina making Lalangina a vassal state within Imerina Kingdom.\nNotable rulers\n*Rasamboninjato (fl. early 1600s)\n*Andriamanelatra-Andrianonantatra\n*Andriamboloana Rabehaofotsy\n*Rafianarana - Andriampianarana\n*Andrianonifoloalina\n*Andrianantara\n*Rahasamanarivo (fl. 1650)\n*Andrianonindranarivo\n*Raendratsara (Ramaharoarivo I) (fl. 1780s)\n*Raonimanalina\n*Andriambavizanaka(Queen)\n*Reniadalo(Queen)\n*Ramaharoarivo II (fl. 1885–1896)\nSee also\n* Betsileo people\n* Andrianampoinimerina\n* History of Madagascar\nReferences"
