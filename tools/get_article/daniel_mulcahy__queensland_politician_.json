He then married Mary Frances Synan, a school teacher, in 1892. They had three daughters and one son together.\nMulcahy died in January 1932 and was buried in the Gympie Cemetery.\nPublic career\nMulcahy started in politics as an alderman in the Borough of Gympie Council from 1892 until 1900 and was Mayor of the town from 1899 to 1901.\nWhen Andrew Fisher resigned as the state member for Gympie in 1901 to enter federal politics, Mulcahy won the ensuing by-election, beating his opponent, Captain Reid, by just four votes. He went on to represent the electorate until 1912 when he was defeated by George Mackay, a Queensland Liberal.\nReferences"
