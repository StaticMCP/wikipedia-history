The aircraft is a 66% scale replica of the Polish PZL P.11c fighter and when it was available was supplied as a kit for amateur construction.\nDesign and development\nThe aircraft features a strut-braced high-wing, a single-seat open cockpit with a windshield, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.\nThe aircraft is made from welded steel tubing and wood, with its flying surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its  span wing employs a NACA 2412 airfoil and has a wing area of . The cockpit width is . The standard engine used is the  CAM 100 four stroke powerplant.\nThe aircraft has a typical empty weight of  and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of . With full fuel of  the payload for the pilot and baggage is .\nThe kit included prefabricated assemblies, the engine and scale fixed pitch propeller, basic VFR instruments, fabric and even paint. Also included were replica 7.9&nbsp;mm machine guns and a ring gun site. The manufacturer indicated that the design was intended for novice builders and estimated the construction time from the supplied kit as 1400&nbsp;hours.\nSpecifications (PZL P.11c)\n|more general=\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=CAM 100\n|eng1 type=four cylinder, air-cooled, four stroke aircraft engine\n|eng1 kw=\n|eng1 hp=100\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=composite\n|prop dia m=\n|prop dia ft=\n|prop dia in=\n|prop note=\n|perfhide=\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=105\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=90\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=55\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range miles=300\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=12500\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=800\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|sink rate ms=\n|sink rate ftmin=\n|sink rate note=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=13.1\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|thrust/weight=\n|more performance=\n|guns= replica 7.9 mm machine guns\n|bombs=\n|rockets=\n|missiles=\n|hardpoints=\n|hardpoint capacity=\n|hardpoint rockets=\n|hardpoint missiles=\n|hardpoint bombs=\n|hardpoint other=\n|avionics=\n}}\nReferences"
