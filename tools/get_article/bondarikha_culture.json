It was found from the left shore of the Dnepr to the upper and mid Seversky Donets, and it the east it reached the Don bassin and mid-Oka.\nThe culture was identified in 1951 by  near what is now Izium. It is represented by both fortified and non-fortified settlement, grave fields, treasures and scattered finds. They lived in pit houses, semi-pit houses, and houses on flat ground. Excavations sound potsherds, flint sickles, pestles and other tools, as well as the bones of cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and sheep. The cemeteries are tumuli, and flat ground graves with cremated remains in urns or small pits.\nThere are about 20 Bondarikha sites on the terraces of various rivers throughout Ukraine. One important find was a socketed celt (ax-head) , which, among Bondarikha sites, has a distinguishing mid-rib that is not found on other Srubnaya celts. The sites have also yielded examples of metallurgy, such as an iron awl, an iron knife, and the blade of a bronze dagger.\nThe end of the Bondarikha culture was contemporaneous with the ends of the Belozerka and Belogrudovka cultures. It was followed by the  and the Gorodets culture. Boris Shramko assigned the Bondarikha culture to the early Cimmerians.\nReferences"
