Warragul lies between the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and the Mount Baw Baw Plateau of the Great Dividing Range to the north. As of the , the town had a population of 19,856 people. Warragul forms part of a larger urban area that includes nearby Drouin that had an estimated total population of 42,827 as of the .\nWarragul is the main population and service centre of the West Gippsland region and the Shire of Baw Baw. The surrounding area is noted for dairy farming and other niche agriculture and has long been producing gourmet foods.\nNaming\nWarragul (or warrigal, worrigle, warragal) is a New South Wales Indigenous word from the Darug language meaning a wild, undomesticated dingo. The town name is accepted to mean wild dog and various businesses in the town use the words 'Wild Dog' in their name.\nHowever, the word was recorded as being used by settlers of Gippsland in the 1840s and 1850s to mean wild Aboriginal or a Gunai/Kurnai person. The traditional land of the Gunai/Kurnai people includes the town of Warragul, then intersects with Boonwurrung territory to the west of the town.\nIn 1851, British botanist Daniel Bunce recorded warragul as a Boonwurrung language word meaning wild, ferocious and enemy. P D Gardner suggests Bunce was correct in translation, but incorrect in origin, since the word comes from Darug. Hugh Copeland wrote in his 1934 history of Warragul that the place name was an Indigenous word meaning wild.\nThe word is also used for the naming of Warrigal Creek in South Gippsland to refer to the inhabitants of the area.\nHistory\nThe town of Warragul began as a construction camp on McLeod's Track, now Brandy Creek Road, at the point where the surveyed railway line linked to the coach road. John Lardner surveyed the townships along the line in 1877 and noted that the early arrivals in the area were squatters, who had erected their shops and dwellings on Crown land. The squatters' blocks were not offered for the first sale of town land on 2 March 1878, but were available to purchase on the second sale later that month.\nIn November 1873, The Victorian Parliament passed an Act approving the construction of a railway linking Oakleigh to Sale. The construction of the Gippsland railway line began simultaneously from both directions. The Warragul railway station opened on 1 March 1878 and the first train ran through in the same month. In May 1890 Warragul railway station became a junction station when a branch line was opened to Rokeby (later extended to Neerim South and Noojee).\nThe first Warragul post office opened on 16 March 1877 at the general store operated by James Biram, who became the first postmaster. A contract to build an official post office was made on 4 April 1887 and a foundation stone was laid on 4 June 1887. The building was completed and occupied the following year. Warragul's modern post office was opened on 3 April 1967, after the old post office closed on 18 September 1965 and was demolished in 1966.\nExisting roads were renamed Princes Highway after the visit to Australia in 1920 of the then Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII).  The highway was officially opened on 10 August 1920 at a ceremony in Warragul.\nWarragul's Petersville Milk Products Factory in Queen Street supplied the famous Peters Ice Cream brand's factory in Mulgrave with all the dairy raw material (fresh cream and concentrated skim milk) for 35 years. The plant also manufactured skim milk powder under the famous Dutch Jug brand and butter under the Iceberg brand. It exported butter, butter oil and milk powders to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\nWarragul was voted Premier Town in Victoria, 1970–1973.\nThe Warragul Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.\nGeography\nWarragul is located on hills that extend north from the Strzelecki Ranges near Ellinbank, joining to the Baw Baws in the Neerim District. This range is historically referred to as the Warragul Hills. The range effectively separates the flatlands of the Koo-Wee-Rup swamp (starting near Longwarry) in the west and the Moe Swamp on the eastern side (starting near Darnum).\nWarragul contains the Linear Park Arts Discovery Trail, a trail covering several adjacent parks in the town. It features painted bollards, mosaics and murals. The trail joins up with the Drouin to Warragul Two Towns Trail.\nClimate\nWarragul has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with warm summers and cool, rainy winters. Average maxima vary from  in February to  in July, while average minima fluctuate between  in February and  in July. Precipitation is moderately abundant: (averaging  per annum), and is frequent (spread between 153.9 precipitation days). Consequently, the town is not sunny, experiencing 171.4 cloudy days and only 52.6 clear days annually. Extreme temperatures have ranged from  on 25 February 1968 to  on 4 July 1963.\n, 143 m AMSL) (1962-1979 normals & extremes, rainfall 1888-2015)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 41.7\n|Feb record high C = 42.3\n|Mar record high C = 38.1\n|Apr record high C = 31.2\n|May record high C = 26.1\n|Jun record high C = 20.6\n|Jul record high C = 22.2\n|Aug record high C = 24.7\n|Sep record high C = 26.7\n|Oct record high C = 32.7\n|Nov record high C = 36.7\n|Dec record high C = 38.9\n|Jan high C = 25.9\n|Feb high C = 26.2\n|Mar high C = 23.9\n|Apr high C = 19.7\n|May high C = 16.0\n|Jun high C = 13.5\n|Jul high C = 12.9\n|Aug high C = 13.9\n|Sep high C = 16.0\n|Oct high C = 18.9\n|Nov high C = 20.7\n|Dec high C = 23.4\n|year high C = 19.2\n|Jan low C = 12.5\n|Feb low C = 13.2\n|Mar low C = 11.6\n|Apr low C = 9.0\n|May low C = 6.6\n|Jun low C = 4.8\n|Jul low C = 3.8\n|Aug low C = 5.0\n|Sep low C = 6.2\n|Oct low C = 8.0\n|Nov low C = 9.4\n|Dec low C = 10.9\n|Jan record low C = 3.9\n|Feb record low C = 3.3\n|Mar record low C = 1.8\n|Apr record low C = -1.6\n|May record low C = -0.9\n|Jun record low C = -3.4\n|Jul record low C = -3.7\n|Aug record low C = -3.5\n|Sep record low C = -1.6\n|Oct record low C = -0.9\n|Nov record low C = 1.2\n|Dec record low C = 2.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 60.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 52.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 67.9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 82.9\n|May precipitation mm = 93.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 92.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 91.2\n|Aug precipitation mm = 102.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 103.8\n|Oct precipitation mm = 105.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 88.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 79.4\n|year precipitation mm = 1020.2\n|unit precipitation days = 0.2 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 8.4\n|Feb precipitation days = 7.2\n|Mar precipitation days = 9.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 12.3\n|May precipitation days = 14.6\n|Jun precipitation days = 15.4\n|Jul precipitation days = 16.4\n|Aug precipitation days = 16.8\n|Sep precipitation days = 15.5\n|Oct precipitation days = 14.5\n|Nov precipitation days = 12.5\n|Dec precipitation days = 10.4\n|source 1 = Bureau of Meteorology (1962-1979 normals & extremes, rainfall 1888-2015)\n}}\nEvents\nWarragul is the major township closest to Lardner, the home of the Gippsland Field Days.
