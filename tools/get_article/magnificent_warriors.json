They first run into a conman and then a rebellious princess, Chin-chin, who join them on their adventures.\nMing-ming and her friends discover that the Japanese occupation plans to convert the town into a weapons manufacturing site, but they are captured before they can warn the locals. Before the group are to be executed (along with Youda, Chin-chin's lover and a local aristocrat who stands up to the Japanese despite initially colluding with them), the locals chant for their release and the local Kaa Yi army turns on the Japanese, firing at the Japanese command and freeing Ming-ming and her friends.
