The game is set around the historical WWII Eastern Front Battle of Kiev in 1943.\nFire-Brigade was one of the first wargames to take advantage of the new graphical mouse driven interfaces on computers like the Macintosh and IBM PC compatibles. It was also one of the first wargames with network game-play for head to head multiplayer battles.\nGameplay\nFire-Brigade is a turn-based strategic and tactical wargame that allows players flexibility and advanced functions. The player can play either alone against the AI or against another person in any of four scenarios networked via modem or cable. The player can play either as the Germans or the Soviet Union in any of the scenarios. At their command is a comprehensive reporting system and realistic staff support.\nPlayers can set combat, logistics and air commitment support values to direct the allocation of supplies; reinforcements and combat support assets. Gather intelligence on enemy forces and assess information on friendly forces before issuing movement and attack orders to units in either a micro (individual units) or macro level (subordinate headquarters). You can then set the frontage of your unit's formation to either narrow, medium or broad, all while you 'confer' with the games' AI which will use artificial intelligence routines to execute the orders within set variable parameters such as morale, troop quality, fatigue etc.\nPlayers are given a 15 step recommended sequence of play list in the game manual for Fire-Brigade.\nReception\nApple Developer Award 1989 for Best Entertainment Package for Fire-Brigade\nComputer Gaming World called the game \"a milestone for computing wargames in terms of sophistication\" and \"Fire-Brigade is meant for the thinking man, the sophisticated player who wants to learn and make the absolute most out of his computer playing time\".
