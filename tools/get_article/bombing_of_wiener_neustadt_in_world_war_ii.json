Fischamend, W.N.F. Klagenfurt, W.N.F. Bad Vöslau) were targets of the Combined Bomber Offensive against the German aircraft industry. WNF manufactured Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and repaired Junkers bombers and heavy fighters  ().\nThe Hirtenberger Patronen Zündhütchen und Metallwarenfabrik was an ammunition factory nearby.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+attacks on Wiener Neustadt\n|-\n! width=9%         | Date\n! width=9%         | Target\n!
