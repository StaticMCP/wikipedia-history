Timothy Beatty is the head principal. Heritage has enrollment of 1,073 as of 2022. Its mascot is the Pioneer and its colors are Navy Blue and Orange.\nBecause of structural issues, the existing school building was demolished in 2016 and the new Heritage High School campus was completed.\nHistory\nIn January, 1975, a steering committee, representative of educators,\nstudents, parents, and the community at large, was appointed to begin planning a new high school to accommodate approximately 2,000 students. This committee and twenty-three subcommittees worked under the able direction of Dr. Ernest Martin, Special Assistant to the Superintendent, to draw up the initial specifications for the new school. From this planning merged the architects' design of an ultra-modern structure, beautiful in appearance and functional in use.\nThe new school had no real identity until the spring of 1976, when a special School Board committee, chaired by Mr. James K. Candler, made the following announcement: \"We propose Heritage High School as a fitting name for the city's newest secondary building. The name shall serve to remind this generation and generations to come that the first responsibility in public education is to see that our democratic way of life is preserved through an informed electorate. This name shall call to mind both the pride in achievements in the past and shall hold forth a challenge for greater progress in the future. It shall provide a continuing reminder to Lynchburg educators and citizens of the obligation which is theirs - to mold the future through the education of the youth - to carry on the heritage of free education first established in the city of Lynchburg in 1871 and in the Colony of Virginia in 1634.\nThe building suffered many structural problems that resulted in the need for higher maintenance costs than comparable schools. In 2007, the Lynchburg School Board hired a firm to suggest ways to either renovate the building, merge the school population to E.C. Glass, or replace it. A task force urged replacement in a September 2011 report.\nIn March 2014, the Lynchburg City Council approved a $63.4 million bid from Barton Malow to build the new school in time for the beginning of the 2016 school year.\nThe School\n*First Floor- Cafeteria, Auditorium, Band, Chorus, Orchestra, Drama, Art Hall, Clinic, Main Office, Gymnasium, History Hall, Foreign Language Hall, Library (first floor)\n*Second Floor- Cosmetology, English Hall, Math Hall, Science Hall, Library (second floor), Drivers Education and Health\nFacts\n*Heritage High School was built to produce solar energy hence its unique architecture\n*Heritage is one of three high schools in Virginia to have an indoor track on their campus (Ralph D.

In 2010, the Virginia Theatre Association named Director Larry Hart theatre educator of the year. All sets are built by Applied Technical Theater I & II. The theatre produces around six shows a year. The six plays usually consist of an Acting II Competition Piece, a Theater in the round, a Mainstage Straight Play, a Mainstage Musical, an Acting II Musical or \"Straight Play\" Dinner Theatre, and the Acting II Original One Acts.  While this is the current compilation it does change slightly from year to year.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060713035413/http://www.lynchburg.org/Schools/Hhs/Default.htm Heritage High School]\n* [http://www.cvgs.k12.va.us/ Central Virginia Governor's School for Science and Technology]\n* [http://www.lynchburg.org/ Lynchburg City Schools]\n* [http://www.vhsl-reference.com/mastergames_byyear_byteam.cfm?ID=10421&GY=2007 VHSL-Reference website]\n* Leland D.
