It was then later bought by Shell Oil Company and expanded into four large warehouse and oil tanks. After the bombing by United States in 1944, the warehouse burned for three days and was half destroyed. It was eventually retired as a backup storage since and donated by Shell.\nTo preserve the historical meaning of the building, the warehouse was repaired. After restoration and remodeling of the area, the Tamsui Cultural Park () was established.\nTransportation\nThe area is accessible within walking distance south of Tamsui Station of Taipei Metro.\nSee also\n* List of tourist attractions in Taiwan\nReferences"
