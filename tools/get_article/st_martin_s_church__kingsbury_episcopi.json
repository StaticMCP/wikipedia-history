There is a four-bay aisled nave. Pevsner describes the chancel and chapels of the church as \"gloriously lit\" and advises visiting on a fine morning. He writes that the nave is older than the rest of the church, \"no doubt of before 1400, and not yet infected with the later exuberance\" of the Late Perpendicular style of the tower and other parts of St Martin's. Poyntz Wright suggests the  high west tower was built in 1515.\nThe four-stage tower is supported by buttresses and has bands of blank quatrefoils, and is surmounted by battlements with pinnacles.\nThe church was renovated between 1845 and 1849.\nThe parish is part of the benefice of Kingsbury Episcopi, East Lambrook and Hambridge within the deanery of Crewkerne and Ilminster.\nSee also\n* Grade I listed buildings in South Somerset\n* List of Somerset towers\n* List of ecclesiastical parishes in the Diocese of Bath and Wells\nReferences"
