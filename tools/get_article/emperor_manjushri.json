The Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty promoted the idea that he too was the earthly manifestation of Manjushri and styled himself the wheel-turning king. The emperors of the Qing dynasty further portrayed themselves as the incarnation of Manjushri and the wheel-turning king who brings peace to the world. The title (文殊菩薩皇帝 or 文殊大皇帝) was commonly used by the Tibetans as the opening words when addressing to the Qing court during the Shunzhi period, and the Manchus referred to the Qing emperors as \"Old Buddha\" (佛爺).\nSee also\n* Son of Heaven\n* Emperor of China\n** Ming dynasty emperors\n** Qing dynasty emperors\n* Tibet under Yuan rule\n* Ming–Tibet relations\n* Tibet under Qing rule\n* The Discourse of Lama\n* Khan of Heaven\n* Bogda Khan\n* Manjushri\nReferences"
