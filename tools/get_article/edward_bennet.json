Clare, as well as the Land League and Home Rule movements.\nBennet became the first chairman of the Clare GAA county committee.\nBy 1887, the GAA had become split along political lines. Bennet received the nomination of the IRB, and was elected president. His presidency was brief, however, lasting only two months before Archbishop Croke intervened to heal the split. Maurice Davin was re-elected, and Bennet lost not only his presidency, but his place on the Clare county board.\nReferences"
