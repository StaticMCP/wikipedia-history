Situated within Cottonwood Wash on the Colorado Plateau, the landscape contains cliff dwellings, stone granaries, and petroglyphs that reflect Ancestral Puebloan and Navajo presence, and it adjoins Bears Ears National Monument. The  preserve is owned and managed by The Wildlands Conservancy as part of its system of preserves.\nGeography\nSpeaking Springs Preserve is situated within the Cottonwood Wash drainage of the Bears Ears National Monument.\nIts landscape features spring-fed wetlands, hanging gardens, and tall sandstone cliffs.\nSeasonal runoff from the Abajo Mountains maintains the riparian system and contributes to the canyon’s ecological diversity.\nFlora and fauna\nThe riparian forests and hanging gardens support endemic plant species and migratory birds.\nThe area functions as a wildlife corridor within the Colorado Plateau, though detailed species surveys have not yet been published.\nRestoration initiatives by the conservancy are intended to enhance these habitats and protect the springs.\nHistory\nThe property had been ranched for years by the Guymon family.\nIn 2017, a proposal by San Juan County to vacate the public road crossing the property raised opposition from Bluff residents and conservation groups who feared the loss of long-standing access into Bears Ears.\nThe Wildlands Conservancy purchased the initial 320-acre tract in July 2023 for approximately $2.15 million after a 16-month fundraising campaign.\nThe acquisition involved negotiations with private landowners beginning in 2022.\nThe purchase established a cultural conservation easement that allows public access, ecological restoration, and tribal stewardship.\nIt marked The Wildlands Conservancy’s first preserve in Utah, which the organization described as a “new standard” for private land conservation in the state.\nIn April 2024, an additional 95 acres were added, bringing the preserve to 415 acres.\nThe acquisitions were supported by individual donors, local residents, tribal nations, and conservation groups.\nCultural resources\nCottonwood Wash contains cliff dwellings, stone granaries, and extensive petroglyphs.\nSome designs, such as horses carved by the Navajo, overlay earlier Ancestral Puebloan symbols, including spirals.\nThe area includes sites from the Pueblo II period (c. 900–1150 AD), reflecting centuries of Indigenous presence.\nThe conservation easement ensures the right of access for ceremonies and plant gathering, while prohibiting development.\nIt is co-managed by the five tribes of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition: the Navajo, Hopi, Ute Mountain Ute, Ute Indian, and Zuni Pueblo.\nThe easement has been described as the first of its kind in Utah, bringing together a private nonprofit and Tribal Nations to jointly manage conserved private land.\nTribal representatives emphasized stewardship and cultural responsibilities to the land rather than ownership as property.\nSome alcoves within the preserve have been designated for private tribal ceremonies, providing a level of access not available on nearby federal lands.\nA Zuni Pueblo representative described the property as helping maintain connections with ancestral traditions and protecting cultural and spiritual values for future generations.\nConservation and management\nBefore acquisition, the canyon floor showed impacts from ranching, including barbed wire, grazing, and debris.\nCurrent priorities include habitat restoration, replacement of fencing, removal of junk materials, and designation of new trails.\nA local trail steward program is planned, alongside efforts to stabilize riparian habitat and protect spring flows.\nThe conservation easement provides for tribal co-management, linking ecological protection with cultural values.\nRecreation and access\nThe preserve is open to the public for hiking, with official pedestrian access now provided.\nPlans call for interpretive and educational programs in partnership with local schools.\nSee also\n* List of The Wildlands Conservancy preserves\n* Bears Ears National Monument\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://wildlandsconservancy.org/preserves/cottonwoodwash Speaking Springs Preserve]"
