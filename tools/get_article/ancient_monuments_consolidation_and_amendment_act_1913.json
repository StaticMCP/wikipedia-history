The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900 (63 & 64 Vict. c. 34) continued this process, empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local county councils to protect a wider range of properties. In 1908, a royal commission concluded that there were gaps between these two pieces of legislation and the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910 (10 Edw. 7. & 1 Geo. 5. c. 3). These were felt unwieldy, and the act repealed all three, replacing them with a new structure.\nOne of the main bill's sponsors was the former viceroy George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, who saved Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, in 1911. Until then, building owners could do with it as they pleased. The experience left a deep impression on Lord Curzon, who determined that new laws had to be enacted to protect Britain's heritage.\nThe new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given to the board, with parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments and extend the public right of access to these. The term \"monument\" was expanded to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.\nConsequences\nBy 1931, over 3,000 monuments had been listed with preservation orders, and over 200 had been taken into public ownership. However, gaps in the legislation remained, leading to the passing of the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 (21 & 22 Geo. 5. c. 16). However, both the 1913 act and the 1931 act were repealed in full by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.\nEcclesiastical exemption\nA component of the act that remains controversial to the present day is the ecclesiastical exemption from listed buildings control, covering all ecclesiastical buildings in ecclesiastical use. Subsequently, the Ecclesiastical Exemption (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Order 1994 confined the exemption to denominations deemed to have suitable internal control mechanisms in place: the Church of England, the Church in Wales, the Methodist Church, the United Reformed Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Baptist Union of Great Britain. Some heritage bodies have urged the exemption's abolition, arguing that it facilitates irreparable damage to historic church interiors in the name of renovation.  argued on behalf of The Victorian Society:\n}}\nThe Church of England General Synod has expressed the ecclesiastical position:\n}}\nNotes\nBibliography\n*\n*\n* |title=Listed Buildings, Conservation Areas and Monuments |location=London |publisher=Sweet and Maxwell |ISBN=978-0-421-75830-8}}\n*\nReferences"
