On 19 January 1916, the Japanese Nippon Industrial Company bought 240 acres for rubber plantations and another 607 hectares of adjacent land. The plantation, known as \"Kuhara Estate of Rubber and Manila Hemp,\" was established under the name of the owner, Fusanosuke Kuhara. Another Japanese plantation, known as \"Kubota Estate,\" belonged to Kubota Umeme, was specialised in coconut and had operated since 1916. According to 1921 statistics, 191 Japanese resided in Tawau, and before the outbreak of the Second World War, there were 1,175.\nThe growing number of Japanese caused the cemetery to be built before the Second World War, and it was used by the Japanese community as a burial site. The vast majority of the people buried here died before the Second World War.\nLocation\nin the back of one of the monument, dated 25 May 1988]]\nThis site is located on the road of Tanjung Batu Street, west of Tawau Golf Course. The site is fenced on three sides. Only a few relics recall its original function as a cemetery. One of the graves listed five Japanese names, such as Sadatoshi Ohta, Ryoichi Muromoto, Isao Ohtomo, Koji Matsuo, and Takeshi Kusumoto.\nOn the back of one of the monuments built after the Second World War, several rows of Japanese characters can be seen, whose translation is as follows:\n{|\n|style=\"width: 5em\"|\n|style=\"width:40em\"|\n|}\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nLiterature\n* Ken Goodlet: [https://archive.today/20121205211723/http://www.nhpborneo.com/book/t108 Tawau - The Making of a Tropical Community], Opus Publications, 2010\nExternal links\n*"
