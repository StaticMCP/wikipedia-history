      "text": "# Sick of You (Gwar song)\n\n\"Sick of You\" is the third track on heavy metal band Gwar's second album Scumdogs of the Universe.\nOverview\n\"Sick of You\" is, lyrically, a simple song, dealing with feelings of utter distaste for a despised one in a somewhat comical fashion:\nYour face is gross\nYou eat white toast\n''You don't know what to do\nAnd just your luck\nYou really suck\nAnd so I'm sick of you''\nDespite the somewhat simple song structure, the song is a fan favorite. Dave Brockie stated it to be his favorite Gwar song (usually because it means the concert is over) and it is the song played most often during the band's live shows.\nCover\nThe song was covered in 2015 by folk musician Sam Beam under his Iron & Wine pseudonym for The A.V. Club's cover series.\nReferences"
