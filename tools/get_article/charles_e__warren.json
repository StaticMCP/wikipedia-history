Warren (September 17, 1962&nbsp;– July 30, 2005) was an assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of New Hampshire.\nEarly life and education\nWarren was born on September 17, 1962, in Guildford, UK. He was son of Joan (Staples) Warren and the late Charles Peter Warren. He was educated at Oxford University, where he received his PhD in 1989 under the mentorship of Raymond Dwek, an eminent early leader in glycobiology. His thesis was entitled Glycosylation in Mice and Rats.\nResearch\nAfter graduation he helped establish the first commercially focused effort in glycotechnology: Oxford Glycosystems, Ltd. He subsequently moved to Toronto, Canada, to broaden his interest in glycosyltransferase and spent his postdoctoral time with Dr. Harry Schachter at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and two years later across the street with Dr. Jim Dennis at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute. Charles Warren moved to the University of New Hampshire in 2002 as an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.\nHe conducted research on the structure-function relationships of glycosylation. These specific efforts focused on evolution, animal development and human diseases. He used C. elegans as his model organism.\nAwards\nAfter only three years at the University of New Hampshire, he was nominated for a named professorship, the Class of 1944 Award. This university-wide award recognizes outstanding faculty members.\nDeath\nCharles Warren died on July 30, 2005, in a paragliding accident.\nWarren Workshops\nSince 2006, Warren Workshops are held every second years in Warren's memory. The initial purpose of the Warren Workshop series on Glycoconjugate Analysis was to bring together concerned analysts in the field to discuss the various methodologies in use with the aim to share and appraise protocols for carbohydrate sequencing. Discussion among the experts in the discipline would hopefully lead to establishing a working framework and course of action to bring unanimity to the goals and requirements of glycoconjugate structural analysis. The growing need, aspirations of automation and high throughput analysis, made open discussion among experts very timely and important.\nWW-I, July 6–9, 2006, UNH Glycomics Center, Durham, NH, USA; Organiser: Vern Reinhold\nWW-II, July 9–12, 2008, UNH Glycomics Center, Durham, NH, USA; Organiser: Vern Reinhold\nWW-III, August 27–30, 2010, Hindasgarden Conference Center, Hindås, Sweden; Organiser: Niclas G.
