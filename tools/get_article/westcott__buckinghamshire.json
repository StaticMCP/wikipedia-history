Street and built in 1867. It is a Grade II* listed building.\nIn the 20th century Westcott was the site of the Rocket Propulsion Establishment, which was on the former RAF Westcott airfield to the west of the main village. This has since been closed down, and the area is called the Westcott Venture Park. BAE Systems maintains a presence on the site (BAE Systems Environmental) which advises on the decommissioning of military sites.\nG.E. Street also designed the parish school. It is now Westcott Church of England School, a mixed primary school. In 2012 it gained permission to expand the age range of its children, taking them from 4–11 years old, with an integrated pre-school nursery that caters to children of 3 for half days.\nReferences\nSources and further reading\n*\n*\nExternal links"
