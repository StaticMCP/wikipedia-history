Their primary tactics include filing abuse and misinformation reports with platforms such as YouTube and cooperating with legal authorities and civil society groups to suspend or demonetize extremist content.\nHistory\nJanuary 2025 - Started activities due to the 2024 martial law and Seoul Western Court riot\nFebruary 2025 - Full-scale activities begin through X account '@movek99'\nMarch 2025 - About 100 people participate in KakaoTalk and Telegram open chat rooms\nActivities\n*Monitoring: Volunteers track far-right YouTube channels, online forums, and open chatrooms to collect evidence of hate speech, disinformation, and incitement of violence.\n*Reporting : Case files submitted to social media platforms, citing violations of terms of service, leading to demonetization or suspension of extremist channels.\n*Public awareness: Publishing summaries of takedown actions and platform responses to mobilize public support and crowdfunding for operational costs.\nImpact\nSince the activities of the far-right tracking group, some far-right YouTubers have stopped their accounts due to the loss of revenue, or have deleted extreme video content themselves out of fear of being reported. It is also said that positive changes have been detected in open chat rooms that are under surveillance, such as self-regulation of extreme expressions or hate speech. Media coverage in major outlets such as JTBC, NoCut News, and Kyunghyang Shinmun boosted their profile.\nSee also\n* New Right (South Korea)\nExternal links\n* [https://x.com/movek99 Counter S on X]\nReferences"
