It was adopted on 2 December 2009, designed by the Macedonian Heraldry Society earlier that year, having been registered by the society on 10 June.\nThe shield of the coat of arms has the sun from the flag of North Macedonia. Below the shield are two branches of Macedonian oak with eight leaves and acorns on each branch. The oak is used due to it being native to the region and representing strength.\nThe coat of arms was designed by the Macedonian Heraldry Society members Stojanče Veličkovski, Petar Gajdov and Jovan Jonovski.\nSee also\n*Flag of North Macedonia\n*Golden Lion of Macedonia\n*National anthem of North Macedonia\n*National emblem of North Macedonia\n*Vergina Sun\nReferences"
