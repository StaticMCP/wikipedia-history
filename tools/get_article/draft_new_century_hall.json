The building was originally built in the 1960's as a conference hall to compliment the 50 metres (160 ft) tall, high rise, office space within New Century House.\nHistory\nConstruction and Early Use (1963–1980s)\nNew Century Hall opened in 1963 as part of the Co-operative Insurance Society’s headquarters at New Century House. Designed by Gordon Tait in the modernist style, it featured cutting-edge architecture and interiors, including murals by Alan Boyson and Steven Sykes. The venue quickly became a key part of Manchester's music scene, with performances from Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, The Bee Gees, and Tina Turner.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Tait\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-op_Insurance\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Boyson\nUnderground and Acid House era (1980s)\nBecame a pivotal venue in the ‘Madchester’ scene, hosting all-night acid house and rave nights where artists like 808 State and A Guy Called Gerald performed.\nCultural Shifts and Decline (1990s–2010s)\nBy the 1990s, usage of the hall had declined. Despite its architectural significance, it saw limited public access and was used mainly for corporate or community functions. The hall remained largely underused, with sporadic events after the Co-op vacated New Century House in 2013; only three gigs were recorded from 2002 to 2013.\nRevitalisation and Reopening (2020s)\nIn 2022, New Century Hall underwent a £10 million refurbishment, preserving original features like its sprung dance floor, murals, and disco-style ceiling. The building was repurposed to include a live music venue, food hall (New Century Kitchen), and educational facilities run by Access Creative College.\nReopened officially in September 2022, featuring a launch by poet John Cooper Clarke and performances from bands like The Charlatans.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooper_Clarke\nArchitecture\nStyle: Modernist -\nNotable Features: Sprung maple dance floor, mid-century interior decor, bespoke acoustic design\nFood Hall: Hosts multiple independent kitchens and a bar\nEducation Space: Basement level hosts music, digital media, and gaming programs\nFacilities\nMain hall capacity: 800–1,000 (1,300 for full-hall configurations).\nAccessibility: step-free access, lifts, accessible toilets, assistance dog friendly.\nAdditional Spaces\nGround floor (New Century Kitchen): 10,000 sq ft food hall with five independent vendors, central bar and al fresco dining at Sadler’s Yard.\nBasement (creative education): Access Creative College (dBs Institute) offering degree-level courses in music, gaming and computing, with live training integrated in the building.\nCultural Impact\nA recognised cultural landmark and symbol of preservation-led regeneration — part of the NOMA vision to reinvigorate Manchester’s northern core\nNOMA\nNOMA (a portmanteau of North and Manchester) is an £800 million, 20-acre (8-hectare) mixed-use redevelopment scheme in Manchester.
