King set up a business in \"King Street\" Sydney, including glass and other merchandise that he had brought with him. He had previously been employed in a glass factory in Edinburgh.\nIn 1828 King received a grant of 2000 acres (8&nbsp;km2) of land on the Williams River in the Hunter Region north of Sydney, which became his estate of 'Irrawang'. He also worked as a merchant in Sydney where he engaged in whaling and shipping ventures.\nIn 1831 he discovered some sand near Sydney suitable for glass-making, samples of which were sent to England and found to be of fine quality. In January 1832 he asked that he might be rewarded for his discovery by a grant of  of land near Sydney, part of the present site of the University. This was refused, but the English authorities suggested that he should be allowed the sum of £100 off the price of any land he might purchase from the state. King was much dissatisfied, and six years later was still endeavouring to have his claim better recognized. King had no success though he was able to mention that the Society of Arts in London had awarded him its silver medal, and that he had a fresh claim on account of his having established a pottery in the colony.\nWinemaking and later life\nThe site of pottery works established in Irrawang in 1832 was where he established a vineyard where he used Spanish, French and Portuguese grape varieties.\nWhile in Australia, King had done much experimenting in vine growing and in making wine, and he continued to do this for many years, producing several varieties of wine of high quality. By 1836 King had established his vineyard and produced the first wine.\nIn 1850 he was awarded gold medals by the Horticultural Society of Sydney for a light sparkling wine and for a white wine, and at the Paris exhibition of 1855 his wines were highly commended and awarded a medal.\nKing left Australia in 1855 on a two years' visit to Europe and in 1857 published privately a pamphlet \"Australia May Be an Extensive Wine-growing Country\". King was by then in bad health, and died in London on 29 November 1857. He left a widow Eliza Elflida née Millner (1812–1887) who afterwards married William Roberts of Penrith, who by his will left £4000 to the University of Sydney for the foundation of scholarships in memory of King.\nReferences\n*"
