It was a collection of five Oscar-winning Silly Symphonies shorts, bridged together with title cards and a narrator. Like The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, each of the cartoons had been released on their own at first before being collected together as one film. The separate cartoon shorts are now available on DVD. In addition, the film is 41 minutes long, just like Saludos Amigos. However, while this film is fully animated, Saludos Amigos would be far shorter without the live-action sequences. It is considered the first feature-length film in the Walt Disney Pictures filmography.\nAcademy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons was re-released and updated with additional four shorts in 1966 with no narration.\nBoth versions of the film were released in Japan on LaserDisc on June 21, 1985.\nFilm segments\nThe original film consists of the following five shorts:\n* Flowers and Trees (1932)\n* Three Little Pigs (1933)\n* The Tortoise and the Hare (1934)\n* Three Orphan Kittens (1935)\n* The Country Cousin (1936)\nThe following additional shorts were included in the 1966 release:\n* The Old Mill (1937)\n* Ferdinand the Bull (1938)\n* The Ugly Duckling (1939)\n* Lend a Paw'' (1941)\nSee also\n* List of animated feature films\n* List of package films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
