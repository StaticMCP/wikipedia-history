He appeared in over 200 films during his career.\nPersonal life\nCoxen was born in London, England. He came to the United States as a child and lived much of his life in San Francisco.\nOn 31 March 1884 whilst settled in San Francisco, Sarah Coxen gave birth to Ed Coxen's only sibling, a sister, Rosa A Coxen. On 14 October 1914, at the age of 33, he married Edith Victoria Borella in Los Angeles, a 24-year-old film actress born in Switzerland of Swiss parents. Borella, who also used the screen names of Eda, Ada and Aida, had played minor parts alongside Coxen in films such as Restitution, where Winifred Greenwood played his love interest.   Edith Borella Coxen died in Los Angeles on 6 March 1974\nAfter studying engineering, Coxen became a prospector before he eventually became an actor.\nCareer\nCoxen's acting career began in 1906 at the Majestic Theatre in San Francisco. He continued to perform with stock companies until he began working in films. He appeared in more than 290 films, beginning in 1912 and ending in 1943 with Air Raid Wardens. Much of his work was in melodramas and Westerns. While he had numerous leading roles during the 1910s, he had become confined to supporting roles or even uncredited bit parts in his later career.\nDeath\nOn 21 November 1954, Coxen died at his longtime home, 464 N Manhattan Place, Los Angeles. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.
