Possum Kingdom Lake is a lake in North Texas near Fort Worth. In the documentary \"Dark Secrets: The Stories of Rubberneck\", vocalist Vaden Todd Lewis further elaborates that he intended \"Possum Kingdom\" to be a continuation of the story told in the song \"I Burn\".  While he envisioned \"I Burn\" to be a story about cult members immolating themselves in order to ascend to a higher plane, \"Possum Kingdom\" was about one of the immolated people becoming \"just smoke, and ...he goes to Possum Kingdom [Lake] and tries to find somebody to join him.\"\nMost of the song alternates between a  and an  time signature.\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Possum Kingdom\" was directed by Thomas Mignone and begins with a body bag being dragged from a lake, then pans to the lead singer, Vaden Todd Lewis, singing in a dark room. It then pans to a shot of the band performing in a small venue with several dozen dancing fans. The individual who dragged the body bag from the river then opens it and begins violently hacking away at it. The video ends by revealing the individual is actually an ice sculptor that is creating the image of a beautiful woman. A drop of water is seen streaming down her face. Filming was done for the stage scene at a small venue, run by Brannon Richards and Kevin Hurnden, called The Crossing.\nTrack listing\nTracks 1 and 2 recorded live September 22, 1995 at the Complex in Dallas, Texas.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1995)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Hot 100 Airplay (Billboard)\n|40\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Album Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|9\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Modern Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|4\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1995)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Rock/Alternative (RPM)\n|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Album Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|18\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Modern Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|25\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1996)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Mainstream Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|74\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Modern Rock Tracks (Billboard)\n|61\n|}\nIn other media\nPossum Kingdom was included in the setlist for the Xbox 360 edition of Guitar Hero II.\nIn season 2, episode 2 of Reacher, the song is played while Reacher and his crew are driving.\nPossum Kingdom was played in season 3, episode 4 of the Apple TV series For All Mankind.\nPossum Kingdom was used in the D23 Brazil trailer for the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Thunderbolts* (2025).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.musicfanclubs.org/toadies/toadies/ripart.txt An article and interview with the Toadies]"
