      "text": "# Waring's prime number conjecture\n\nIn number theory, '''Waring's prime number conjecture''' is a conjecture related to Vinogradov's theorem, named after the English mathematician Edward Waring. It states that every odd number exceeding 3 is either a prime number or the sum of three prime numbers. It follows from the generalized Riemann hypothesis, and (trivially) from Goldbach's weak conjecture.\nSee also\n* Schnirelmann's constant\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n\n---\n\n## Waring's Prime Number Conjecture\n\n#REDIRECT Waring's prime number conjecture"
