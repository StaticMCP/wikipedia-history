J. Stevens in Australian SF News writes \"I shouldn't have to sell you on this volume, you should be up and running to the nearest bookstore to buy a copy of this collection of the best sf for 1975.\"\nThe book was also reviewed by John Clute in Vector 79, January 1977, Floyd Kemske in Galileo iss. 4, July 1977, Joe Sanders in ''Delap's F & SF Review v. 3, no. 7, July 1977, and Sneja Gunew in SF Commentary'' no. 57, November 1979.\nAwards\nThe anthology placed tenth in the 1977 Locus Poll Award for Best Anthology.\nNotes"
