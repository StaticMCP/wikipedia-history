The club was formed as an advocacy group, styled after the successful Royal Automobile Club of the United Kingdom. Of the eighteen founding members, ten were medical practitioners. Their belief that \"autos\" could be a reliable means for visiting patients was used to leverage a more positive image of cars in the public consciousness.\nDr. George Hopkins was voted to be the president, and Dr. Charles Marks was the first vice-president. At the time of formation there were only 16 registered privately owned motor cars in Queensland.\nIn recognition of the club's patriotic efforts during the Great War, King George V approved the use of the 'Royal' prefix in 1921.\nIn 1925 RACQ Roadside Assistance was born when the Club commissioned two mechanics, George Clark and Eddie Henderson, to patrol the roads in search of disabled vehicles.\nIn the 1970s the club began to expand its services including the formation of RACQ Insurance.\nIn 2011, following Tropical Cyclone Yasi in Northern Queensland and flooding in central and southern Queensland, RACQ Foundation was launched to assist community groups devastated by natural disasters.\nRACQ was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2014.\nIn 2017, RACQ merged with Queensland Teachers Mutual Bank, forming RACQ Bank.\nServices\nAs of 2021, RACQ provides the following services:\n* Assistance – roadside assistance and home assistance\n* Insurance – motor, home and contents, caravan, boat, pet, travel, life and income protection\n* Banking\n* Travel Agency\nCommunity and sponsorships\n]]\nRACQ has also previously sponsored a broad range of events which sought to improve driver skills and promote road safety initiatives including:\n* The All Schools Pedal Prix.\n* RACQ Technology Challenge Maryborough.\n* Older People Speak Out, Years Ahead courses.\n* The Queensland Road Safety Awards.\n* The RACQ Historic Motoring Council Rally (now MotorFest).\n* The RACQ Insurance International Women's Day Fun Run.\n* The Prevent Alcohol and Risk-related Trauma in Youth program (P.A.R.T.Y.) run by the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.\nFree2go was a youth program initiative by RACQ designed to help learner drivers to get their licence and included roadside assistance.

Reporter Tracy Grimshaw outlined how the RACQ dismissed tow truck driver Murray French for breaking a road rule when he towed a wheelchair-bound handicapped person's car on a tilt-tray tow truck while the person was still seated in the car. The event was earlier reported by the Logan Reporter and BigRigs.com.au. Thousands of RACQ members and the general public signed a petition calling for the RACQ to reinstate French. On 9 July there was a protest at the RACQ office asking for French's reinstatement. The RACQ issued a response on their Web site disputing the information in the Channel 9 report and defending the decision to dismiss the driver. In a statement the tow truck driver cited the 5 people killed on the M1 while waiting minutes in their car after RACQ had been called.\nRACQ required to pay $10 million for pricing discount failures\nIn February 2023, ASIC commended civil penalty proceedings against RACQ in the Federal Court, alleging that product disclosure statements for several RACQ insurance policies were misleading as they included statements that certain discounts would be applied to customers’ insurance premiums, it was found that the discounts were only applied by RACQ to the base insurance premium, and not to additional premiums paid for certain optional extras. The proceedings which concluded later in 2023 found that RACQ had sent the misleading product disclosure statements on at least 5 million occasions between March 2017 and March 2022, resulting in approximately 458,746 customers missing out on an estimated $86,476,339 in discounts.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.racq.com.au/ RACQ]\n*[http://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/f/fhnkog/slq_alma21131598660002061 The Steering Wheel.
