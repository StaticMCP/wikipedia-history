The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the contest, Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up 2007. Six acts competed in the national final and the winner was selected through two rounds of public televoting.\nAs a member of the \"Big Four\", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing in position 19, the United Kingdom placed 22nd out of the 24 participating countries with 19 points.\nBackground\nPrior to the 2007 contest, British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom forty-nine times. Thus far, it has won the contest five times: in  with the song \"Puppet on a String\" performed by Sandie Shaw, in  with the song \"Boom Bang-a-Bang\" performed by Lulu, in  with \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" performed by Brotherhood of Man, in  with the song \"Making Your Mind Up\" performed by Bucks Fizz, and in  with the song \"Love Shine a Light\" performed by Katrina and the Waves. To this point, the nation is noted for having finished as the runner-up in a record fifteen contests. Up to and including , it had only twice finished outside the top 10,  and  . Since 1999, the year in which the rule was abandoned that songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, it has had less success, thus far only finishing within the top ten once:  with the song \"Come Back\" performed by Jessica Garlick. In , \"Teenage Life\" performed by Daz Sampson finished in nineteenth place out of twenty-four competing entries.\nAs part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. The broadcaster announced that it would participate in the 2007 contest on 16 October 2006. The BBC has traditionally organised a national final featuring a competition among several artists and songs to choose its entry for Eurovision. For its 2007 entry, the broadcaster announced that it would held a national final involving a public vote to select its entry.\nBefore Eurovision\nEurovision: Making Your Mind Up 2007\nEurovision: Making Your Mind Up 2007 was the national final developed by the BBC in order to select its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. Six acts competed in a televised show on 17 March 2007 held at the Maidstone Studios in Maidstone, Kent and hosted by Terry Wogan and Fearne Cotton. The winner was selected entirely through a public vote. The show was broadcast on BBC One. The first part of the national final was watched by 5.1 million viewers in the United Kingdom with a market share of 22.6%, while the second part was watched by 5.6 million viewers in the United Kingdom with a market share of 25.7%.\nCompeting entries\nEntries were provided to the BBC by record labels and music industry experts including writers and producers.

Six finalists were selected to compete in the national final, which were announced during a press conference on 28 February 2007.\nFinal\nSix acts competed in the televised final on 17 March 2007.

Many people believed Cyndi was the winner as Wogan's announcement was louder than Cotton's, however it was confirmed seconds later that Scooch were the winners. The BBC would later issue a written apology, blaming the blunder on \"live TV\".\nFollowing the national final, several contestants voiced their dissatisfaction with the final result. Justin Hawkins, who immediately left the studio after failing to qualify for the second voting round, accused viewers for being \"racist or stupid\" for not voting for him and Big Brovaz due to the race of the group members and his duet partner Beverlei Brown. Accusations were also made by Big Brovaz, Brian Harvey and Hawkins that Scooch had duped the public into voting for them by miming their song and failing to show their two backing vocalists on stage with the purpose of boosting their performance. The group later denied the miming claims with their spokesman Andrew Hill accusing the acts of \"sour grapes\", while a BBC spokeswoman stated that \"Scooch won fair and square in a vote by the British public\". The BBC Head of Entertainment also released a statement clarifying that the show had \"followed EBU rules to the letter\" and that \"having off-camera supporting singers occurs regularly in TV shows and especially the Eurovision\".\nAt Eurovision\nAccording to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country, the \"Big Four\" (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom) and the ten highest placed finishers in the  are required to qualify from the semi-final in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from the semi-final progress to the final.

In addition to their participation in the final, the United Kingdom is also required to broadcast and vote in the semi-final on 10 May 2007.\nIn the United Kingdom, the semi-final was broadcast on BBC Three with commentary by Paddy O'Connell and Sarah Cawood, while the final was televised on BBC One with commentary by Terry Wogan and broadcast on BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ken Bruce. The BBC appointed Fearne Cotton as its spokesperson to announced the British votes during the final.\nFinal\nScooch took part in technical rehearsals on 7 and 8 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 11 and 12 May.
