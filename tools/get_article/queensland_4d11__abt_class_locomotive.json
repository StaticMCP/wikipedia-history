Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the 4D11½ Abt class, the 4 representing the number of driving wheels, the D that it was a tank locomotive, and the 11½ the cylinder diameter in inches.\nThey were built to assist conventional locomotives up and down a steeply graded rack railway section of the Central Western line at Mount Morgan.\nClass list\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Number\n!Worksnumber\n!In service\n!Condemned\n|-\n|align=center|339\n|align=center|3619\n|October 1898\n|September 1916\n|-\n|align=center|340\n|align=center|3620\n|October 1898\n|December 1922\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
