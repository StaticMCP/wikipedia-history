He joked about several controversial topics, such as the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the college admissions scandal and the middle-aged Leonardo DiCaprio's dating history with younger women. Gervais also jokingly accused the Hollywood Foreign Press of racism for its lack of diversity and an \"In Memoriam\" section, mocked Amazon, Apple and Disney for their unfair labor practices, and chastised awardees who talk about their political views in acceptance speeches.\nGervais' comments attained mixed reactions across the political spectrum. While conservatives highly praised Gervais, journalists from liberal outlets were more critical, with Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield calling his monologue \"incredibly stale\". Of the criticism, Gervais said it was the \"best ever\" and later defended his jokes via tweet.\nSee also\n* 92nd Academy Awards\n* 47th Annie Awards\n* 25th Critics' Choice Awards\n* 73rd British Academy Film Awards\n* 40th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 23rd Hollywood Film Awards\n* 35th Independent Spirit Awards\n* 24th Satellite Awards\n* 26th Screen Actors Guild Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
