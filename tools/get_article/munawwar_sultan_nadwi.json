He studied fiqh at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama and completed advanced training in ifta and Qadha at Al Mahadul Aali Al Islami, Hyderabad. He serves as the Office Secretary and Academic Fellow of the Majlis-e-Tahqiqat-e-Shariah and teaches classical Islamic jurisprudence at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama.\nEarly life and education\nMunawwar Sultan Nadwi was born on 10 February 1979 in Bishanpur neighbourhood, Ekhata, Madhubani district, Bihar, India. He received his early education at Madrasa Islamia Tofanpur, followed by studies at Madrasa Chashma-e-Faiz, Malmal. He later joined Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, completing ‘Alimiyyah in 1999 and Fadhilat (specialization in fiqh) in 2001. He then studied Ifta and Qadha at Al Mahadul Aali Al Islami, Hyderabad and completed his course in 2003, where he also benefited from Khalid Saifullah Rahmani.\nIn 2002, he launched an annual journal, Nishan-e-Manzil, from his hometown Ekhatha, where he served as its founding editor-in-chief. Only two issues were published.\nCareer\nAfter completing his studies, Nadwi was appointed as a compiler of fatwas at the Dar al-Ifta of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama. He is also a teacher at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, where he teaches al-Hidayah and as-Sirajiyyah. He serves as the Office Secretary and Academic Fellow at Majlis-e-Tahqiqat-e-Shariah, Deputy Editor of its quarterly Tahqiqat-e-Shariah journal, and a Shariah Advisory Council member of the Indian Muslim Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He has been the Executive Editor of Sada-e-Marwah (Lucknow) since 2016.\nIn September 2024, Nadwi moderated a symposium on the Waqf Amendment Bill organized by the Majlis-e-Tahqiqat-e-Shariah at Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama, Lucknow. In his introductory remarks, he stated that just as zakat provides economic strength to the Muslim community, waqf serves as a source of economic, social, and welfare development for all people, benefiting society at large.\nScholarly recognition\nNadwi's scholarly works and academic involvement have been cited and acknowledged in multiple university-level research studies. His Urdu book Nadwatul Ulama ka Fiqhi Mizaj aur Abna-e-Nadwa ki Fiqhi Khidmaat (2005) has been cited in academic research as the first comprehensive study on the juristic orientation of Nadwatul Ulama and the fiqhi contributions of its graduates. The doctoral thesis Role of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama in Promoting Arabic Literature and Islamic Studies (Jawaharlal Nehru University, 2008) describes it as a pioneering and unique work in its field.\nThe same thesis includes Nadwi's work in its bibliography as one of the principal Urdu sources (al-Masadir al-Ra’isiyyah al-Urdiyyah) used for the study.\nIn another doctoral dissertation submitted to Aligarh Muslim University, Nadwi was mentioned as one of the key informants and research contributors regarding the life and thought of Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi. The thesis notes that he assisted the researcher in accessing Nadwatul Ulama’s library and relevant materials, and describes him as a disciple of Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi who was serving as a teacher at the seminary at that time.\nLiterary works\nApart from translating several Arabic works into Urdu, Nadwi has presented papers in various academic and fiqhi seminars. His scholarly and analytical articles have appeared in journals and newspapers such as Tameer-e-Hayat, Bang-e-Hira, Bahs-o-Nazar (Hyderabad), and The Munsif Daily. He presently serves as an Academic Fellow at the Majlis-e-Tahqiqat-e-Shariah, Nadwatul Ulama.
