      "text": "# Fine Art (software)\n\nFine Art () is a Go-playing computer program created by Chinese media company Tencent.\nDevelopment reportedly started in early 2016, around the time AlphaGo's successes, first against Fan Hui and later against Lee Sedol, showed that deep-learning neural networks combined with Monte Carlo algorithms were effective in computer Go. Fine Art reached the strength of human professionals by the end of 2016.\nIn March 2017, it won the Computer Go UEC Cup, against a field that included Zen, Crazy Stone and 27 others. AlphaGo did not participate. After its win, it played an exhibition game against Ichiriki Ryo, the Japanese 7-dan professional Go player. This game was played without handicap, and Fine Art won by resignation.\nFine Art has played many games on Fox, an Internet Go server, including several victories over Ke Jie, the world-number-1 Go player.\nIn the final match of the first AI Ryusei, Fine Art defeated DeepZenGo and won the championship on 10 December 2017.\nReferences"
