After leaving school, he was apprenticed to a tailor in Ballarat. He arrived in Western Australia in 1898, in the aftermath of the gold rush, and established his own business in Kalgoorlie. Ware was prominent in the Clothing Trades Union, and from 1902 to 1905 was president of the trades and labour council for the Eastern Goldfields. He was elected to parliament at the 1905 state election, having won the Labor preselection ballot for Hannans unopposed after the withdrawal of the sitting member, Wallace Nelson. Ware was re-elected at the 1908 election, but did not recontest his seat at the 1911 election and was replaced by Selby Munsie. He moved to Perth after leaving politics, opening a tailor's shop in Subiaco. Ware died in October 1929, after being run over by a motorist in Murray Street. He had married Caroline Elizabeth Wulff in 1906, with whom he had six children.\nReferences"
