After 774, the kings were not Lombards, but Franks. From the 12th century, the votive crown and reliquary known as the Iron Crown (Corona Ferrea) retrospectively became a symbol of their rule, though it was never used by Lombard kings.\nThe primary sources for the Lombard kings before the Frankish conquest are the anonymous 7th-century Origo Gentis Langobardorum and the 8th-century Historia Langobardorum of Paul the Deacon. The earliest kings (the pre-Lethings) listed in the Origo are almost certainly legendary. They purportedly reigned during the Migration Period. The first ruler attested independently of Lombard tradition is Tato.\nEarly rulers\nLegendary rulers\n*Shava\n*Ybor and Agio, brothers, together with their mother Gambara, who led the emigration from Scandinavia\n*Agilmund, son of Agio\n*Laiamicho (Lamissio)\n*Ortnit\nLething dynasty\nThe Lethings were an early dynasty from the time of Lethuc.
