The Canadian Army had a dedicated set of officers in the Second World War who studied and recorded various facets of wartime history for posterity.\nDuring the war, Colonel Charles Perry Stacey headed the overseas effort of chronicling the history of the army, and produced a large number of reports. These reports, known as \"CMHQ Reports\" are largely available in electronic form from the Directorate of History and Heritage.\nSome historical information was also compiled in book form during the war, and some introductory volumes were released soon after the war.\n''Canada's Battle In Normandy'' was released in 1946. Authored by Colonel Stacey, the book was a 159-page look at Canada's experiences in the Battle of Normandy from the perspective of the Canadian Army.\nIn 1948, The Canadian Army 1939-1945: A Historical Summary was published.  The book was described in Stacey's own words in his autobiography, A Date With History:\n}}\nThe first of the three volume Official History did not appear in print until 1955 at the earliest. This was not unusual, in as an Official History of the First World War had also been many years in coming.  Though the first of a projected eight volumes by Colonel Duguid first saw print in 1938, 20 years after the Armistice, the remaining 7 volumes were never completed.  G. W. L. Nicholson published a one-volume Official History in 1964.  The Royal Canadian Air Force's official Second World War history was not published until the 1990s.  In Stacey's words:\n}}\nVolume I\nOfficial History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War: Volume I. Six Years of War: The Army in Canada, Britain and the Pacific appeared in print in 1955.  Written by Colonel Stacey, the book was 629 pages in length, profusely illustrated with charts, photos, map and sketches, with ten appendices, a glossary of abbreviations, 50 pages of referenced footnotes, and a complete index.  The title was evocative of the contents; a history of the Canadian Army's organization and training in Canada, in Britain, and in the Pacific was given in simple prose, well researched and balanced.\nVolume II\nOfficial History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War: Volume II. The Canadians in Italy, 1943-1945 was first published on 15 Sep 1956 with a second, corrected edition appearing in Feb 1957. The book was written by Lieutenant Colonel G.W.L. Nicholson, deputy director of the Historical Section, General Staff.  He had served with the Prince Albert and Battleford Volunteers before the war and with the Prince Albert Volunteers from its mobilization until 1943, when he joined the Historical Section, General Staff as Narrator, Pacific Command.  In 1946 he served as Officer in Charge of the Historical Section at Canadian Military Headquarters, in Cockspur Street, London, and was appointed Deputy Director Historical Section, Army Headquarters in 1947. In the autumn of 1948 he travelled to Italy, and traced the path of the Canadians, from south-east Sicily to northern Italy; many of the photos in Volume II were taken by him, and he physically walked the ground of all actions in which Canadian forces in Italy took part.\nVolume III\nOfficial History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War: Volume III. The Victory Campaign, The Operations in North-West Europe 1944–1945 appeared in print in 1960. It contained 770 pages, boosting the price on the dust jacket to the sum of $4.00 (up from the $3.50 tariff for Vol. I and Vol. II).\nStacey also wrote some companion volumes, including Arms, Men and Governments: The War Policies of Canada 1939-1945, a history of the political side of Canada's war effort, which finally saw print in 1970.\nReferences\nExternal links\nEach volume is available as a pdf-download from the [https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/official-military-history-lineages/official-histories.html Directorate of History and Heritage] (DHH) website:\n*  [https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/official-military-history-lineages/official-histories/book-1955-army-ww2-1.html Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War, Vol I Six Years of War]\n*  [https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/official-military-history-lineages/official-histories/book-1956-army-ww2-2.html Official history of the Canadian Army in the Second World War, Vol II The Canadians in Italy]\n*  [https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/military-history/history-heritage/official-military-history-lineages/official-histories/book-1960-army-ww2-3.html Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War, Vol III The Victory Campaign: The Operations in Northwest Europe, 1944-45]"
