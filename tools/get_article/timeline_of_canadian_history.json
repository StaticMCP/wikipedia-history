It has an exclusive charter for trade in the Hudson's Bay watershed region known as Rupert's Land. The company administers the new colony on behalf of the King. ||\n|-\n|1690\n|16–24 October\n|The Battle of Québec was fought between the colonies of New France and Massachusetts Bay, then ruled by the kingdoms of France and England, respectively. It was the first time Québec's defenses were tested, with the New Englanders hoping to seize Québec, then the capital of New France. They failed to take the city.\n|\n|}\n18th century\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! style=\"width:6%\" | Year || style=\"width:10%\" | Date || Event || Ref.\n|-\n|1701 ||4 August|| The Great Peace of Montreal, between New France and 39 First Nations, is finalized.||\n|-\n| 1710\n|October\n| In the Siege of Port Royal, the capital of Acadia falls to the British, defeating the French garrison and their Wabanaki Confederacy Indigenous allies. This begins an expansion into present-day Nova Scotia by the British.\n|\n|-\n| 1713 || 11 April || The War of the Spanish Succession is ended by the Treaty of Utrecht. France cedes the territory of Acadia to Great Britain and renounces claims to some British territories in Canada, as well as its claim to a monopoly of trade with the Indigenous population, but retains control of Île Royale colony (present-day Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island). ||\n|-\n| 1717\n|\n| The Indigenous settlement of Kanesatake is founded at the confluence of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers. It is founded by the Sulpician Order under a royal charter as a home for Catholic converts of the Indigenous peoples of the region, including the Mohawk. The lands' ownership becomes disputed between the Order and the Indigenous residents over the original land grant and title. The settlement would later be the location of the Oka Crisis. The land remains disputed.\n|\n|-\n| 1749\n| 21 June\n| Halifax is founded and settled by the British, marking the first time that public rather than private capital was used to settle a British colony in the Americas. The Indigenous Mi'kmaq consider Britain's unilateral action as a violation of treaties signed after Father Rale's War in 1726, starting Father Le Loutre's War. British colonists would drive French and Mi'kmaq inhabitants from peninsular Nova Scotia but are repelled from Acadian settlements further north (present-day New Brunswick).\n|\n|-\n| 1755\n| 11 August\n| British Brigadier-General Charles Lawrence orders the Expulsion of the Acadians. Over the next decade an estimated 11,400 French Catholics are deported to the Thirteen Colonies and Europe. Many settle in Louisiana.\n|\n|-\n| 1758\n| 8 June  26 July\n| The French naval fortress at Louisbourg is sieged for a second time by the British, having been returned to the French after a previous occupation in 1745. After being used to stage attacks on French Canada the following year, British soldiers reduce the fortress to rubble to prevent its return to the French a second time.\n|\n|-\n| 1759\n| 13 September\n| A three-month British siege of Quebec City culminates in the pivotal Battle of the Plains of Abraham just outside the city's walls. Both the British and French commanders are killed in the battle. Following a decisive British victory, the French evacuate the city.\n|\n|-\n| 1760-1761\n| 10 March 1760 – 12 October 1761\n| The Halifax Treaties are signed between the Wabanaki Confederacy and the British Crown to end warring between the Indigenous peoples of the Maritimes and the British. One by one, various First Nations signed treaties to pledge \"peace and friendship\" with the British. The issue of aboriginal title is not covered in the treaties.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1763 || 10 February || The Seven Years' War is ended by the Treaty of Paris. France cedes New France to Great Britain, its colony Canada becoming the British Province of Quebec, and its remaining maritime colonies annexed by Nova Scotia. ||\n|-\n| 7 October\n| The Royal Proclamation of 1763 is issued by King George III, forbidding settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, which was delineated as an Indian Reserve. The document is the first to recognize aboriginal title, a right included in the Canadian Constitution. Its banning of settlements west of the 13 British Colonies would eventually become one of the factors inciting the American Revolution.\n|\n|-\n| 1764\n| 1 August\n| The Treaty of Fort Niagara is agreed to by the British Crown and 24 First Nations. It is the first treaty after the 1763 Proclamation, recognizing aboriginal title, and Indigenous recognition of the Proclamation. A strip of land along the Niagara River is transferred to Britain by the Seneca to provide a portage around Niagara Falls. The treaty created a new Covenant Chain, or friendship treaty, between Britain and the First Nations of the western Great Lakes. It is recorded in wampum. To the Indigenous peoples, it is a symbol of friendship and the recognition of sovereignty to their First Nations.\n|\n|-\n| 1769 || 14 July || St. John's Island is partitioned from Nova Scotia, becoming a separate colony from the mainland. The colony is renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798. ||\n|-\n|1774\n|\n|Quebec Act of 1774 is passed by the Parliament of Great Britain outlining how the Province of Quebec would be governed as colony, in an attempt to address damage to the economy/society of Quebec. Old boundaries were restored, free practice of Catholicism was guaranteed, and property and civil laws were to be decided according to traditional Canadian laws (thus preserving the Seigneurial system of New France for land ownership), with other matters of law left to English Common Law. The province was left to be governed by a legislative council, with no provision for an elected assembly.\n|\n|-\n|1775-1776\n|\n|The Invasion of Quebec and the Battle of Quebec take place, during the American Revolutionary War against Great Britain. These became a failed attempt at seizing military control of the British Province of Quebec and convince the French-speaking Canadiens to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies.\n|\n|-\n|1780s-1860s\n|\n|An Underground railroad, a series of houses where aid and shelter was available, assisted escaped slaves from slave states to the northern U.S. and for some the journey continued into Canada. Slavery was outlawed in Canada with the passage of the British Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. That made entry into Canada even more attractive to escaped slaves, and an estimated 30,00 to 40,000 blacks came to Canada along the Underground Railroad before the end of slavery in the United States in 1865.\n|\n|-\n|1782-1783\n|\n|A preliminary peace treaty between Great Britain and the United States of America is signed. Citing one of the clauses, General George Washington insisted on the return of any present or former slaves. As part of documenting and evacuation of former slaves to British North America, the Book of Negroes was compiled in New York City. Enslaved Africans in America who escaped to the British during the American Revolutionary War became the first settlement of Black Nova Scotians and Black Canadians.\n|\n|-\n|1783\n|3 September\n|The Treaty of Paris (1783) was signed by representatives of King George III of Great Britain and representatives of the United States of America, officially ending the American Revolutionary War. The treaty set the boundaries between the British Empire in North America and the United States of America. Details included fishing rights and restoration of property and prisoners of war.\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 1784\n| 22 May\n| Over  of land is purchased by the British Crown from the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation in present-day Ontario for £1,180.\n|\n|-\n| 18 June || New Brunswick and Cape Breton Island are partitioned from Nova Scotia, becoming separate colonies. Cape Breton re-joins Nova Scotia in 1820. ||\n|-\n| 25 October\n|Under the terms of the Haldimand Proclamation,  of the lands purchased from the Mississaugas is granted to the Mohawks and the other Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. The land is a tract extending  on either side of the Grand River from source to mouth. However, it is later determined that the head of the Grand River was outside of the lands purchased from the Mississaugas. In 1792, Governor Simcoe unilaterally reduces the land grant to . Later land sales, government actions, and the creation of the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve would reduce the lands under Indigenous possession to a small fraction of the original grant. The land grant and its management is the basis of the Grand River land dispute between the Six Nations and Canada.||\n|-\n|1790s|| || Hudson's Bay Company and North West Company build fur trading posts on upper Saskatchewan River. These include Fort Edmonton and forts at Rocky Mountain House. ||\n|-\n|1791||  10 June||The Constitutional Act 1791 divides the Province of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada (modern-day Ontario and Quebec).

It was found that the original 1787 agreement only provided a land deed and no description of the lands involved. The treaty would be disputed and settled in 2010.\n|-\n|1811\n|\n|Settlement began of the Red River Colony, a 300,000 square kilometres (120,000 sq mi; 5 times that of Scotland) area, by Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk via a land grant from the Hudson's Bay Company, of which he was a part-owner. The territory later became part of Manitoba and the Missouri Territory.\n|\n|-\n| 1813 || 27 April || Battle of York.

The rebellions are led by William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis Joseph Papineau. Some of the captured are hanged; a hundred captured Canadian rebels and U.S. sympathizers are sentenced to life in Australian prison colonies.
