A tournament was not held in 1990 but returned in 1991.\nProduction\nBackground\nThe King of the Ring tournament was an annual single-elimination tournament that was established by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1985 with the winner being crowned the \"King of the Ring.\" The 1989 tournament was the fifth King of the Ring tournament. It was held on October 14, 1989 at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island and like the previous years, it was a special non-televised house show.\nStorylines\nThe matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by World Wrestling Federation's writers.\nAftermath\nAlthough the King of the Ring tournament had been held annually since 1985, a tournament did not occur in 1990. However, the tournament returned in 1991.\n|times   =\n|match1  = Akeem defeated Brutus Beefcake\n|stip1   = King of the Ring tournament first round match\n|time1   =\n|match2  = Hercules and Jim Neidhart ended in a double disqualification\n|stip2   = King of the Ring tournament first round match\n|time2   =\n|match3  = The Warlord defeated Bushwhacker Butch\n|stip3   = King of the Ring tournament first round match\n|time3   =\n|match4  = Tito Santana defeated Bad News Brown\n|stip4   = King of the Ring tournament first round match\n|time4   =\n|match5  = Rick Martel defeated Bill Woods\n|stip5   = King of the Ring tournament first round match\n|time5   =\n|match6  = Bushwhacker Luke defeated Nikolai Volkoff\n|stip6   = King of the Ring tournament first round match\n|time6   =\n|match7  = Jimmy Snuka defeated The Barbarian\n|stip7   = King of the Ring tournament first round match\n|time7   =\n|match8  = Haku defeated The Red Rooster\n|stip8   = King of the Ring tournament first round match\n|time8   =\n|match9  = Tito Santana defeated The Warlord\n|stip9   = King of the Ring tournament quarterfinal match\n|time9   =\n|match10 = Rick Martel defeated Bushwhacker Luke\n|stip10  = King of the Ring tournament quarterfinal match\n|time10  =\n|match11 = Jimmy Snuka defeated Haku\n|stip11  = King of the Ring tournament quarterfinal match\n|time11  =\n|match12 = Tito Santana defeated Akeem\n|stip12  = King of the Ring tournament semifinal match\n|time12  =\n|match13 = Rick Martel defeated Jimmy Snuka\n|stip13  = King of the Ring tournament semifinal match\n|time13  =\n|match14 = Tito Santana defeated Rick Martel\n|stip14  = King of the Ring tournament final match\n|time14  =\n|match15 = Dusty Rhodes defeated Big Boss Man (with Slick)\n|stip15  = Singles match\n|time15  =\n}}\nTournament bracket\n| RD1-score10=00:55\n| RD1-seed11=\n| RD1-team11=Bushwhacker Luke\n| RD1-score11=pin\n| RD1-seed12=\n| RD1-team12=Nikolai Volkoff\n| RD1-score12=3:06\n| RD1-seed13=\n| RD1-team13=Jimmy Snuka\n| RD1-score13=DQ\n| RD1-seed14=\n| RD1-team14=The Barbarian\n| RD1-score14=9:48\n| RD1-seed15=\n| RD1-team15=Haku\n| RD1-score15=pin\n| RD1-seed16=\n| RD1-team16=The Red Rooster\n| RD1-score16=8:52\n| RD2-seed01=\n| RD2-team01=Akeem\n| RD2-score01=&nbsp;\n| RD2-seed02=\n| RD2-team02=BYE\n| RD2-score02=&nbsp;\n| RD2-seed03=\n| RD2-team03=The Warlord\n| RD2-score03=10:08\n| RD2-seed04=\n| RD2-team04=Tito Santana\n| RD2-score04=pin\n| RD2-seed05=\n| RD2-team05=Rick Martel\n| RD2-score05=sub\n| RD2-seed06=\n| RD2-team06=Bushwhacker Luke\n| RD2-score06=4:12\n| RD2-seed07=\n| RD2-team07=Jimmy Snuka\n| RD2-score07=pin\n| RD2-seed08=\n| RD2-team08=Haku\n| RD2-score08=7:28\n| RD3-seed01=\n| RD3-team01=Akeem\n| RD3-score01=10:30\n| RD3-seed02=\n| RD3-team02=Tito Santana\n| RD3-score02=pin\n| RD3-seed03=\n| RD3-team03=Rick Martel\n| RD3-score03=pin\n| RD3-seed04=\n| RD3-team04=Jimmy Snuka\n| RD3-score04=6:54\n| RD4-seed01=\n| RD4-team01=Rick Martel\n| RD4-score01=12:58\n| RD4-seed02=\n| RD4-team02=Tito Santana\n| RD4-score02=PIN\n}}\n1.
