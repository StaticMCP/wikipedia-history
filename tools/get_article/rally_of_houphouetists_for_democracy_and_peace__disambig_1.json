It initially included the Rally of the Republicans, the Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire, the Union for Democracy and Peace in Côte d'Ivoire, the Movement of the Forces of the Future and the Union for Ivory Coast.\nDespite the formation of the alliance, each party put forward its own candidate in the 2010 presidential elections. Although the five parties also largely contested the 2011 parliamentary elections alone, joint RHDP lists were put forward in some constituencies, winning four seats in Abidjan. In the 2015 presidential election the alliance nominated incumbent President Alassane Ouattara of the Rally for the Republic as its candidate. Ouattara won with 84% of the vote. In 2016 the Ivorian Workers' Party joined the RHDP to jointly contest the 2016 parliamentary elections. The alliance retained its majority in the elections, winning 167 of the 255 seats.\nOn 16 July 2018 the alliance was transformed into a unitary party, including members of the Rally of the Republicans, the Union for Democracy and Peace in Ivory Coast and some minor parties. The new party designated Alassane Ouattara as its candidate for the 2020 presidential elections.\nOn 27 May 2024 the RHDP nominated Ouattara as its candidate for the 2025 presidential elections.\nElection results\nPresident\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" |First round\n! colspan=\"2\" |Second round\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Result\n|-\n!
