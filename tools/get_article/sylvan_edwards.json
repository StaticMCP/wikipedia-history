He is currently in his second spell with Bristol side Dings Crusaders where he became one of the top try scorers in National League 2 South history, with 69 tries in his first nine seasons spent at the club. Sylvan has also been capped by the Gloucestershire county side.\nCareer\nFirst Spell with Dings\nAfter starting his career with Avonmouth Old Boys, Sylvan signed for fellow Bristol side, Dings Crusaders in 2002, and his debut season was a success as his club won South West Division 1 and gained promotion to the National Leagues. The 2003–04 season in National Division 3 South saw Ding's just avoid relegation, five points clear of 13th placed Basingstoke, with Sylvan contributing a respectable 10 tries in a Ding's side that were the lowest points scorers in the division.  The next season was far better for both Sylvan and Dings as he scored a (tier 4) career best 17 tries in the league and his club finished 8th.  Over the next couple of seasons Dings saw stability as they became a mid-table side in the division.\nThe 2008–09 season with Ding's was a lean one for Sylvan as he only managed 3 tries in a Ding's side that finished 6th.  However, his overall contribution was good enough to see him picked for the Gloucestershire county side, with whom he reached the 2009 Bill Beaumont Cup final, making an appearance at Twickenham but ultimately ending on the wrong side of an 18–32 scoreline against winners Lancashire. In 2011 Sylvan was part of the Ding's squad that won the Bristol Combination Cup but it would be his last silverware at the club before his move to Weston-super-Mare for the 2012–13 season.\nWeston-super-Mare\nSylvan had a decent debut season with new club Weston-super-Mare, scoring 7 tries from 21 appearances as his club finished 3rd in National League 3 South West, missing out on the promotion playoffs.  Missing out on promotion was tempered somewhat as Weston-super-Mare won their 10th Somerset Cup, beating Old Redcliffians 33–32 in a very close match at the final held at Bath Road in Bridgwater. The next couple of seasons would see Weston's performances in the league start to slip and from chasing promotion in 2013, they were relegated to South West 1 West by the end of 2015.\nBack with Dings\nAfter suffering relegation with Weston-super-Mare, Sylvan resigned with former club, Dings Crusaders for the 2015–16 season, continuing to play in National League 3 South West as Dings had just been relegated from National League 2 South. Now aged 37 years he is playing in an ambitious Dings side that is looking to get promoted back to the National Leagues.\nSeason-by-season playing stats\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Club\n!Competition\n!Appearances\n!Tries\n!Drop Goals\n!Conversions\n!Penalties\n!Total Points\n|-\n| 2002–03 || rowspan=16 align=left | Dings Crusaders || South West Division 1 || ? || ? || ? || ? || ? || ?\n|-\n| rowspan=2 align=left | 2003–04 ||  National Division 3 South || 26 || 10 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 50\n|-\n| Powergen Cup || 2 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 10\n|-\n| rowspan=2 align=left | 2004–05 || National Division 3 South || 24 || 17 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 85\n|-\n| Powergen Cup || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| rowspan=2 align=left | 2005–06 || National Division 3 South || 17 || 10 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 50\n|-\n| EDF Energy Trophy || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| rowspan=2 align=left | 2006–07 || National Division 3 South || 25 || 9 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 45\n|-\n| EDF Energy Trophy || 2 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 10\n|-\n| rowspan=2 align=left | 2007–08 || National Division 3 South || 20 || 11 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 55\n|-\n| EDF Energy Trophy || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0\n|-\n| rowspan=2 align=left | 2008–09 || National Division 3 South || 19 || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 15\n|-\n| EDF Energy Trophy || 4 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 5\n|-\n| 2009–10 || National League 2 South || 19 || 4 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 20\n|-\n| 2010–11 || National League 2 South || 6 || 1 || 0\t|| 0 || 0 || 5\n|-\n| 2011–12 || National League 2 South || 21 || 4 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 22\n|-\n| rowspan=2 align=left | 2012–13 || rowspan=4 align=left | Weston-super-Mare || National League 3 South West || 21 || 7 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 35\n|-\n| Somerset Cup || 2 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 10\n|-\n| 2013–14 || National League 3 South West || 20 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 10\n|-\n| 2014–15 || National League 3 South West || ? || ? || ? || ? || ? || ?\n|-\n| 2015–16 || rowspan=2 align=left | Dings Crusaders || National League 3 South West ||? || ? || ? || ? || ? || ?\n|-\n| 2016–17 || National League 3 South West || 6 || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 15\n|-\n|}\nHonours and records\nDings Crusaders\n*South West Division 1 champions: 2002–03\n*Bristol Combination Cup winners: 2009\nWeston-super-Mare\n*Somerset Cup winners: 2013\nPeter Spencer cup winner 2012 - 13\nGloucestershire\n*Bill Beaumont Cup runner up: 2009\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/dingscrusadersrfc Dings Crusaders RFC]\n*[http://www.westonrugby.co.uk/ Weston-super-Mare RFC]\n*[http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/avonmoutholdboys Avonmouth Old Boys RFC]\n*[https://gloucestershirerfu.co.uk/ Gloucestershire RFU]"
