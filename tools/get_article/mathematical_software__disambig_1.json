A useful mathematical knowledge of such as algorism which exist before the invention of electronic computer, helped to mathematical software developing. On the other hand, by the growth of computing power (such as seeing on Moore's law), the new treatment (for example, a new kind of technique such as data assimilation which combined numerical analysis and statistics) needing conversely the progress of the mathematical science or applied mathematics.\nThe progress of mathematical information presentation such as TeX or MathML will demand to evolution form formula manipulation language to true mathematics manipulation language (notwithstanding the problem that whether mathematical theory is inconsistent or not). And popularization of general purpose mathematical software, special purpose mathematical software so called one purpose software which used special subject will alive with adapting for environment progress at normalization of platform. So the diversity of mathematical software will be kept.\nSolvers\nSoftware calculator\nA software calculator allows the user to perform simple mathematical operations, like addition, multiplication, exponentiation and trigonometry. Data input is typically manual, and the output is a text label.\nComputer algebra systems\nMany mathematical suites are computer algebra systems that use symbolic mathematics.  They are designed to solve classical algebra equations and problems in human readable notation.\nCryptography\n* Comparison of cryptography libraries\nStatistics\nTheorem provers and proof assistants\nOptimization software\nGeometry\nNumerical analysis\nThe Netlib repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems, mostly in Fortran and C. Commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the IMSL, NMath and NAG libraries; a free alternative is the GNU Scientific Library.  A different approach is taken by the Numerical Recipes library, where emphasis is placed on clear understanding of algorithms.\nMany computer algebra systems (listed above) can also be used for numerical computations.\nMusic mathematics software\nMusic mathematics software utilizes mathematics to analyze or synthesize musical symbols and patterns.\n* Musimat (by Gareth Loy)\nPhysics\nPlotting and charting\nWebsites\nA growing number of mathematical software is available in web browsers, without the need to download or install any code.\n* Desmos\n* GeoGebra\n* Jupyter Notebook\n* Kaggle\n* KaTeX\n* OpenPlaG\n* Overleaf\n* SageMath – CoCalc\n* Symbolab\n* WolframAlpha\nBiomathematics\n* List of bioinformatics software\n* Biostatistics software\n* List of systems biology modeling software\n* List of systems biology visualization software\nMathematical chemistry\n* List of quantum chemistry and solid-state physics software\n* Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling\nMathematical modeling and simulations\n* Conway's Game of Life\nProgramming libraries\nLow-level mathematical libraries intended for use within other programming languages:\n* GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP), for high-performance arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n* Class Library for Numbers, a high-level C++ library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n* AMD Core Math Library, a software development library released by AMD\n* Boost, for C++\nList of mathematical software\n* Desmos\n* GeoGebra\n* GNU Octave\n* gnuplot\n* KCalc\n* Maple (software)\n* Mathematica\n* Mathcad\n* Maxima (software)\n* Microsoft Mathematics\n* MuPAD\n* MATLAB\n* R (programming language)\n* SageMath\n* SciPy\n* Matlab Simulink\n* SymPy\n* TeX\n* TI-Nspire\n* Wolfram Alpha\nMathematical notation software\n* AUCTeX\n* Authorea\n* Apache OpenOffice Math\n* AsciiMath\n* Calligra Words – Formula editor\n* CoCalc\n* GeoGebra\n* GNOME LaTeX\n* GNU TeXmacs\n* Gummi\n* KaTeX\n* Kile\n* LaTeX\n* LibreOffice Math\n* LyX\n* MathJax\n* MathML\n* MathType\n* Notepad++\n* Overleaf\n* Scientific WorkPlace\n* TeX\n* Texmaker\n* TeXnicCenter\n* TeXShop\n* TeXstudio\n* TeXworks\n* Verbosus\n* Vim\n* Visual Studio Code – [https://github.com/James-Yu/latex-workshop/wiki LaTeX Workshop]\n* WinEdt\n* WinFIG\n* WinShell\nMathematical art software\n* Apophysis\n* Electric Sheep\n* Fractint\n* Fyre\n* Mandelbulb\n* MilkDrop\n* openPlaG\n* Ultra Fractal\n* XaoS\n* R / R Mandelbrot sets\n* Sterling\n* Bryce\n* Picogen\n* Terragen\n* GeoGebra\n* Desmos\n* Grapher\n* Winplot\n* Processing\n* Grasshopper 3D\n* P5.js\n* matplotlib\n* gnuplot\n* Inkscape spirograph\n* Wolfram Mathematica\n* Houdini\n* MATLAB\n* TouchDesigner\n* Unity (with math plugins)\n* LaTeX (PGF/TikZ, PGFPlots)\n* Manim\n* D3.js\nMathematical education software\n* DreamBox Learning (K-8 learning)\n* GeoGebra (software for primary-university teaching)\n* Mathletics (online learning software)\n* Zearn (online curriculum for K-8 teaching)\nSee also\n*Computational mathematics\n*Computer-Based Math and computer-based mathematics education\n*Comparison of formula editors\n*Gödel's incompleteness theorems\n*List of information graphics software\n*Manim – open-source Python mathematical animation and visualisation software\n*Mathlete\n*Plot (graphics)\n*Time complexity\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://zbmath.org/software/ swMATH] Database on mathematical software"
