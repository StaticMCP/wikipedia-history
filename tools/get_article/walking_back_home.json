We did have a go at recording it but, in hindsight, didn't make the best job of it.  The song was dropped from the film and despite visiting it occasionally in the years between I've never found a good arrangement.  This time Ewen was on holiday and it seems to have made all the difference...  Listen carefully and you hear him putting 10p in the phone as he drops in a bass part (turn it up very loud and you'll hear the organ at Blackpool Tower).\"\nChristmas and Glasgow\n\"'Christmas and Glasgow' was recorded at CaVa — Robin Rankine must have been involved — and I'm sure Rachel Smillie played that whistle.  It was only available before on the Oscar Marzaroli tribute record — you can see his work on this sleeve and a few others from our early days.\"\nWhen You Are Young\n\"'When You Are Young' was recorded as part of Fellow Hoodlums and played a good deal live at that time.  Most of this is the original live take with Gavin Wright's fiddle added before we mixed.\"\nBeautiful Stranger\n\"'Beautiful Stranger' was recorded in a mill in Cookham and finished in Eden . . . that's in London . . . around 1993.  It was only previously available to vinyl junkies . . . and predates any Madonna song of the same name and mentions the island of Gigha which no Madonna song I know ever did.\"\nAll I Want\n\"'All I Want' started life as a possible track for the last studio album Whatever You Say, Say Nothing then got left behind.  For technophobes this is from a rough mix, an old DAT and no one remembers when we recorded it or who pressed the red button — but it's as good as anything else here\"\nWalking Back Home\n\"'Walking Back Home' was recorded at CaVa . . . that's in Glasgow with Ewen, Doug and myself and later Graeme and Lorraine overdubbing.  Where was Jim? . . . I want to dedicate this to two of the people mentioned on the track: Warbeck and Linda . . . we all sang and we'll keep on singing.\"\nReferences"
