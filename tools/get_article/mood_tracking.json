      "text": "# Mood tracking\n\nMood tracking is a positive psychology technique for improving mental health where a person records their mood, usually at set time intervals, in order to help identify patterns in how their mood varies. It has been suggested as a self-help method for people suffering from mood disorders such as anxiety, clinical depression, and bipolar disorder.\nThere are a variety of tools and technologies available to help individuals track their moods. Some popular options include pen and paper as well as apps for mood tracking which let users track trends over time. Wearable devices like Fitbit and Apple Watch also include mood tracking features, allowing users to track their moods throughout the day and receive personalized insights and recommendations based on their data.\nWhile mood tracking can be a valuable tool for individuals looking to improve their mental health and well-being, there are also potential limitations and ethical concerns that should be considered. One potential limitation is the potential for self-report bias, as individuals may not accurately report their emotional states or may be influenced by social desirability bias. Additionally, consistent tracking over time is necessary for mood tracking to be effective, which may be challenging for some individuals.\nIt is important to note that mood tracking should not be used as a substitute for professional mental health treatment. Rather, it can be a useful tool for individuals to complement their existing treatment and support overall well-being.\nReferences"
