As provided under the Constitution of Queensland, the Parliament consists of the King, represented by the Governor of Queensland, and the Legislative Assembly. It has been the only unicameral state legislature in the country since its upper chamber, the Legislative Council, was abolished in 1922. The Legislative Assembly sits in Parliament House in the state capital, Brisbane.\nThe Queensland Parliament retains plenary legislative power over Queensland, however Commonwealth laws apply to the extent of any inconsistency. Some laws from the colonial era passed by the New South Wales parliament and the Imperial Parliament also remain in force.\nFollowing the outcome of the 2015 election, four additional seats were added to the Legislative Assembly (to a total of 93), the voting system changed from optional preferential voting to full-preferential voting, and unfixed three-year terms were replaced with fixed four-year terms.\nHistory\nThe Parliament was founded 22 May 1860, less than a year after the Colony of Queensland was created in June 1859. It was convened at military and convict barracks converted for the purpose located on Queen Street, Brisbane. Immigration was an important issue for the early Parliament. Population growth was encouraged with new settlers enticed by land ownership.\nIn 1915, Queensland became the first state to make voting compulsory at state elections.\nSince 1 April 2003, live audio broadcasts have streamed through the internet from the Parliament while it is in session. In June 2007, the Parliament started broadcasting video of parliamentary proceedings. Nine in-house television cameras are used to record sessions.\nThe first female Speaker, Fiona Simpson was elected on 15 May 2012.\nMembership\nThe Assembly has 93 members of Parliament (MPs). These are intended to represent approximately the same population in each electorate. Voting is by the full preferential voting system, with elections held every four years.\nIn April 2016, legislation was passed to increase the number of seats in the parliament by four to a total of 93. An amendment was also passed to abolish optional preferential voting. A referendum held the previous month was passed, supporting a bill to establish fixed four-year terms.\nRoyal assent\nThe role of the monarch in Parliament is to give royal assent to legislation. This function is in practice exercised by the governor of Queensland, who conventionally will never refuse assent to a bill that has passed the Legislative Assembly. The party or coalition with the most seats in the house is invited by the governor to form a government.\nThe leader of that party subsequently becomes the premier of Queensland, leading a Cabinet of ministers. In the Liberal National Party, the premier selects members of their party to act as ministers. In the Labor Party, the ministers are elected by party room ballot, with the leader then assigning ministerial portfolios to each one.\nOperations\nOnce all winning candidates have been declared, the governor of Queensland proclaims a date for the start of the new Parliament. It is the role of the Clerk of the Parliament to call members to attendance.\nAccording to the Constitution of Queensland, members of Parliament must swear an oath or affirmation to the King as well as an oath of office before signing a Roll of Members. This oath or affirmation must be made to the governor or someone authorised by him or her—typically the clerk of the Parliament.\nSworn-in representatives are required to elect a Speaker to preside over the House's business. Before this occurs, the longest serving member who is not a minister presides over the proceedings. Once elected the Speaker is dragged to the chair and presented to the Governor at Government House. The symbol of the authority of the Parliament and its Speaker is the ceremonial mace. The sergeant-at-arms carries the mace into the chamber of parliament when the speaker enters at the start of each sitting day and removes it again when the speaker leaves at the end of the sitting day. During the sitting day, the mace rests on two raised brackets on the centre table with the head of the mace lying pointed towards the government's side. The current mace was designed and made in 1978 and is sterling silver with gold plating and is encrusted with 32 Queensland gemstones. Despite being the symbol of Parliament, it is engraved with the words \"Government of Queensland\".\nThe ceremonial opening of the new Parliament is marked by a speech by the governor. Traditionally the speech is written by the new government and it may outline current activities, budget details, statistics and proposed lists of legislation which are intended to be introduced.\nA day in Parliament usually begins with housekeeping matters, including prayers, notifications and the tabling of any documents. An opportunity is then given to Ministers to make statements. During a period of no more than an hour, known as question time, any member may pose a question to a Minister.\nRegional sittings\nStarting in 2002, the Queensland Parliament has held regional sittings of parliament across the state. Originally being held every three years, the occurrence has become more sporadic. The most recent was in 2023 in Cairns, the first regional sitting since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 97%;\"\n! width=30px|\n! width=175px|Location\n! width=190px|Dates\n!
