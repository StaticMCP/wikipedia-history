Governor Sanford B. Dole also served as President of the Society. Early members included historians Nathaniel Bright Emerson and Ralph Simpson Kuykendall. In one of the Society's first meetings, on February 24, 1892, Queen Liliuokalani was voted Patron of the Society. Stella Maude Jones had been a trustee. Willowdean Chatterson Handy served as a librarian of the Hawaiian Historical Society for ten years.\nThe Society publishes books and the Hawaiian Journal of History. This annual publication is the longest published peer-reviewed journal focusing on the history of both pre- and post-contact Hawaii. The Society's Library, located at the Hawaiian Mission Houses Historic Site and Archives, contains a collection of photos, newspapers, magazines, journals, books, pamphlets, and manuscripts made available to scholars and the public. For example, in 1974, the journal published a retrospective on the 1874 election of King Kalākaua and the ensuing Honolulu Courthouse riot including letters with eyewitness accounts.\nAs a leading organization studying the history of Hawai'i, the Society presents free public lectures on a regular basis. Its speakers and authors are often featured in the media.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*The [http://www.hawaiianhistory.org/ Society's web site]\n*The [http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/9 Hawaiian Journal of History] online\n*The Society's [http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/8 Annual Reports], which include academic papers"
