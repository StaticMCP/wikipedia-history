Awarded projects must have enhanced the quality of the built environment or public domain or contribute to the wellbeing of the broader community.'\nEarly awards for civic design in NSW\nA NSW based award for civic design was first established in 1964.  Robert Woodward of architectural practice Woodward, Tarantino and Wallace was presented with the inaugural award for the El Alamein Fountain in Fitzroy Gardens, Kings Cross. The 1964 award was established to recognise an architectural project that was outside the traditional architecture award categories such as the Sir John Sulman Medal. Three years later in 1967 Harry Seidler was presented with an RAIA Civic Design Award for Australia Square recognising the integration of accessible public space in a private development.In 1980 Jørn Utzon was presented with a RAIA Civic Design Award for the Sydney Opera House.\nChange from civic design to urban design\nThe award was initially established as the Lloyd Rees Award for Civic Design in 1979 and given annually until 2002. The award category was modified to urban design in 2003 to better reflect changes in the architectural profession and the rise of urban design as the more common terminology for architectural projects of larger scale and community or public benefit.\nOther civic design awards and recognition\nIn 1959 the Civic Trust Awards were established in the United Kingdom as an awards system to recognise outstanding planning, urban design and architecture. In 1967 the Civic Trust of South Australia was established, based on the UK Civic Trust Awards and independent of the Australian Institute of Architects, with its own civic awards presented annually.\nNaming of the award\nThe award was named in 1979 after Australian born artist and architectural educator Lloyd Rees (1895–1988). Lloyd Rees was a famous landscape painter and an influential figure in architecture and civic design. For decades he taught at the University of Sydney, and a member of the City of Sydney Fountains Committee (established 1957–1968) from 1962 to 1967. The Lloyd Rees Fountain in Martin Place was sited and funded by Rees himself and opened in 1976. He is known for his quote 'a city is the greatest work of art possible', which is inscribed on his cast bronze bust at Sydney Town Hall, and also 'what else is a city but a gallery of beautiful buildings?'.\nRecipients of Lloyd Rees Award for Urban Design\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Winners of Lloyd Rees Award for Urban Design by year\n|-\n!
