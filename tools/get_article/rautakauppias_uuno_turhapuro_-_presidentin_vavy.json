It is the fifth film in the  series, and it is the last  film in black and white.\nThe film's script is built on the basis of reheated sketches from the Spede Show, the most notable of which is the 13-minute \"hardware store\" sketch.\nPlot\nCouncillor Tuura (Tapio Hämäläinen) is his party's presidential candidate, but Tuura's lazy son-in-law Uuno (Vesa-Matti Loiri) threatens to mess up the whole campaign, so he needs to find a job. Tuura assigns Uuno to an aptitude test, and the result is surprising: Uuno is perfectly suited to become a hardware dealer (although Uuno is more unwilling to serve in this job). Tuura's rival Häppälä (Juhani Kumpulainen) sends the beautiful agent Unelma (Liisa Paatso) to ruin Uuno and Elisabeth's (Marjatta Raita) marriage, with the intention of causing a scandal for Tuura.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
