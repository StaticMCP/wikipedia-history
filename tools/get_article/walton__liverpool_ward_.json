      "text": "# Walton (Liverpool ward)\n\nWalton ward is an electoral division of Liverpool City Council centred on the Walton area of the city. It was created in 1900 when three councillors were elected and dissolved in 1953.\nThe ward was recreated in 2023 following a review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which decided that the existing 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Walton ward was reinstated as a two-member ward, taking the majority of the former Warbreck ward with small sections of the former County, Fazakerley and Norris Green wards.\nCouncillors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#FFF\"| 1953 - 2022 WARD DISESTABLISHED\n|-\n| 2023\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Sam East (Lab)\n|style=\"background-color: \"|\n|bgcolor=\"#B6D7A8\"| Bev Kenyon (Lab)\n|}\nindicates seat up for re-election after boundary changes.\nindicates seat up for re-election.\nindicates change in affiliation.\nindicates seat up for re-election after casual vacancy.\nElection results\nElections of the 2020s\n}}\n§Sam East was a re-standing councillor for the former Warbreck ward.\nReferences"
