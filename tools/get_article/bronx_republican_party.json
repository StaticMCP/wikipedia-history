Savino was arrested on charges of corruption for accepting a bribe from Democratic State Senator Malcolm Smith to secure the Republican nomination for the 2013 New York City mayoral election. He would be succeeded by John Greaney, a navy veteran and firefighter from the September 11th attacks and a former civil employee who raised concerns as he was a personal friend of Savino and had thousands of dollars of debt.\n2016 election\nDuring the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, the New York Republican State Committee awarded 3 delegates to the Republicans of the 15th district which is solely in the Bronx. Meaning the small Bronx Republican party suddenly found themselves in the midst of a heated race between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump to secure their delegates. The New York Times assessed Bronx Republicans where the most \"powerful\" Republicans in the country, with only 741 voters for every 1 delegate. The Bronx GOP backed Donald Trump, in part due to the Trump Links golf course at Ferry Point Park which improved the local economy, and in part because Ted Cruz did not tell the party he would be visiting the Bronx with a Democratic State Senator for a campaign stop.\nShortly after the election, the chairman John Greaney stepped down due to health complications from the September 11th attacks, and a new chairman, former vice-chairman Michael Rendino was elected in a local sports bar.\n2020 election\nIn 2020, Donald Trump received 15.7% of the Borough's vote, compared to 9.4% in 2016, which was the steepest pro-Trump increase across the city, which saw a general pro-Republican trend during the election.\n2021 election\nDuring the 2021 New York City mayoral election, the party endorsed Fernando Mateo for the Republican nomination. Mateo, the spokesmen for Hispanics Across America, and the state Federation of Taxi Drivers, was the first latino immigrant to run for mayor as a Republican. Despite another endorsement from the Queens Republican Party, Mateo would be unable to secure the third endorsement to become candidate, instead Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island's party would endorse Curtis Sliwa.\n2022 election\nIn the 2022 election for District 14, the Bronx GOP stood a candidate, Tina Forte, who defeated Queens Republican Desi Joseph Cuellar in a primary to go on to face Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez would handily win 70% to 23%.\n2023 election\nDespite the party's small size, they have undergone a concerted effort to launch a competitive campaign for the 13th city council district held by first term councilwoman Marjorie Velázquez. Kristy Marmorato, chairman Michael Rendino's sister, won the party's primary, in a move that has been decried as nepotism, despite Rendino having no say in the primary. George Havranek, Marmorato's challenger in the primary, was also accused of committing electoral fraud by forging signatures, and admitted to donating to Velázquez's campaign in 2021. Marmorato would go on to win after a run-off election, and secure the endorsement of the Conservative Party. The City assessed the campaign would be close due to the local Hispanic population shifting away from Velázquez due to the ongoing housing crisis. Marmorato would defeat Velazquez with 52.9% to Velazquez's 47.1%.\nIn the 17th District, the Bronx GOP candidate, Rosalie Nieves, is running unopposed and will face off against incumbent democrat Rafael Salamanca, and [https://www.gonzaloduran.nyc/gonzalo-duran-press Gonzalo Duran], Salamanca's democratic challenger who has secured the Conservative Party's nomination.\n2024 election\nIn the 15th Congressional District, the Bronx County Conservative Party candidate and Bronx GOP endorsed candidate, [https://www.gonzaloduran.nyc/gonzalo-duran-press Gonzalo Duran], is running unopposed and will face off against incumbent democrat Ritchie Torres.\n2025 election\nMain article: 2025 New York City Public Advocate election\nOn February 18, Gonzalo Duran announced that he would be running for Public Advocate of New York City. On February 25, both the Bronx Republican and Conservative Parties announced that they had chosen Duran as their candidate for Public Advocate. This marks the first time in over 10 years that a citywide Conservative Party candidate has received a cross-party endorsement. Duran will be challenging the incumbent, Jumaane D. Williams.\nElected officials\nAs of 2023, the Bronx GOP has no elected officials in the New York Senate, New York House of Representatives, or the Executive of New York and just one in the New York City Council. The last Republican Borough president of the Bronx was Joseph “Pepperoni” Periconi, who served one term from 1962-65.  Prior to him, there was only one other Republican borough president, Douglas Mathewson, who served from 1914-17. The last Republican state senator from the Bronx was Guy Velella who left office in 2004.\nNew York City Council\n*Kristy Marmorato represents the 13th District since 2024.\nSee also\n*Kings County Republican Party\n*Queens County Republican Party\n*Manhattan Republican Party\n*Staten Island Republican Party\n*New York Republican State Committee\nReferences"
