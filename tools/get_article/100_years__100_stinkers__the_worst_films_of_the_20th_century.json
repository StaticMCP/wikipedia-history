To determine the list, anyone who visited the Stinkers' website could suggest a worthy candidate; eventually, the 300 most popular choices were placed on a list for visitors to vote on followed by a ten-week period where votes for a ranked list of the 20 worst films were cast.\nConclusion\nThe final results were revealed in 2001 as each entry was also given a descriptive paragraph in alphabetical order. Battlefield Earth topped the list of \"dishonored\" films beating out cult classics Plan 9 from Outer Space, Showgirls, Waterworld and Howard the Duck.\nSee also\n*The Official Razzie Movie Guide\n*The Golden Turkey Awards\n*My Year of Flops\nReferences"
