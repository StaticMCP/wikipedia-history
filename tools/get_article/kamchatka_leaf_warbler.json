It was formerly included in the \"Old World warbler\" assemblage. It is closely related to the Arctic warbler and the Japanese leaf warbler, to which it was formerly considered conspecific.\nIt breeds in Kamchatka, Sakhalin, Hokkaido and the Kurile Islands; it migrates to Indonesia and the Philippines.\nThe first European observation of a Kamchatka leaf warbler was made on July 18, 2021, in Kilpisjärvi, Enontekiö, Finland.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Kamchatka Leaf Warbler\n\n#REDIRECT Kamchatka leaf warbler\n}}"
