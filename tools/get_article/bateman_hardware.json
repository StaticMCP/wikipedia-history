This land on Henry Street was to be the home of J. & W. Bateman Ltd. for the next 150 years. Initially it was a shipping and warehousing business (including lighterage and river transport), and 1840 is given (in a 1951 company prospectus) as the \"early start of trading, with the help of his young sons, John and Walter\". The first item had been sold in 1834, a grindstone possibly belonging to \"the implements valued at £55\" that Bateman brought to the colony on board .\nIn 1895 the company built a new warehouse and office building (the Union Stores Building) on the corner of High and Henry Streets. This extended  along High Street and  along Henry Street. It was designed by local architect Herbert Nathaniel Davis.\nNotes\nFurther reading\n*\n*"
