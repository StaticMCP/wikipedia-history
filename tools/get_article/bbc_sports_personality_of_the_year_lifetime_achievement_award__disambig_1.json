The award is given to a sportsperson \"who has made a major impact on the world of sport during their lifetime\". The winner is selected by BBC Sport. When football manager Alex Ferguson won the award in 2001, the BBC described the award as \"a new accolade\" to be presented annually; however, two people had already received the Lifetime Achievement Award.\nHistory\nThe inaugural recipient of the award was Frank Bruno in 1996, who won it after his retirement from boxing that year. Bruno was the favourite to win the main award in 1995, but lost to Damon Hill, causing many to criticise his Lifetime Achievement Award as being a consolation award. Spanish golfer Seve Ballesteros won the award the following year, but after that the award was not presented for three years. The award has been presented annually since Ferguson ended the hiatus in 2001. Five of the eleven recipients have been associated with football; tennis and golf are the only other sports to have been represented more than once. Tennis player Martina Navratilova was the first woman to have won the award. The only recipient of the award on multiple occasions is Ballesteros who won in 1997 and again in 2009, for his contribution to golf winning \"the Open three times, the Masters twice as well as playing an inspirational role in the Ryder Cup\". The most recent winner, in 2024, was cyclist Mark Cavendish.\nWinners\nBy year\n, winner in 2003, was the first female recipient of the award]]\n, the winner in 2005]]\n, the winner in 2012]]\nhas competed in four Olympic Games]]\nwas the first female winner since 2003]]\n{|class=\"sortable plainrowheaders wikitable\"\n|+BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award winners\n|-\n!scope=col|Year\n!scope=col|Nationality\n!scope=col|Winner\n!scope=col|Sport\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Rationale\n!scope=col class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n|align=center|1996\n|\n!scope=row|\n|Boxing\n|For his contributions to boxing which include winning the WBC heavyweight title.\n|align=center|\n|-\n|align=center|1997\n|\n!scope=row|\n|Golf\n|\"In recognition of his outstanding contribution to European golf over the last 20 years.\"\n|align=center|\n|-\n|align=center|2001\n|\n!scope=row|\n|Football\n|For a managing career at Manchester United since 1986 which has won seven league titles and \"claimed an unprecedented treble of Premiership, FA Cup and European Cup\".\n|align=center|\n|-\n|align=center|2002\n|\n!scope=row|\n|Football\n|\"In recognition of his footballing achievements\", which include being named \"Footballer of the Year and European Player of the Year in 1968\", and winning two championship medals and a European Cup with Manchester United.\n|align=center|\n|-\n|align=center|2003\n|\n!scope=row|\n|Tennis\n|\"For a trophy-laden tennis career spanning 30 years, (...) winning a record 167 singles titles and an astonishing 329 trophies overall, 140 ahead of her nearest rival.\"\n|align=center|\n|-\n|align=center|2004\n|\n!scope=row|\n|Cricket\n|\"For services to cricket\" where he played 102 Tests for England in his 15-year career as an all-rounder.
