Published by HarperCollins from 2019 to 2021, this six-novel arc follows a supernatural crisis in which the warrior code fundamentally breaks down after Bramblestar's spirit is stolen and replaced by an imposter. The story explores themes of identity, spiritual corruption, and societal collapse through protagonists Rootspring (a SkyClan apprentice) and Shadowsight (a ShadowClan medicine cat). The arc marks significant changes to Clan governance and StarClan's relationship with living cats.\nDevelopment\nThe concept for The Broken Code originated from fan discussions about the rigidity of the warrior code. Editor Victoria Holmes stated in a 2019 interview that the team wanted to \"test the code's limits\" by creating a scenario where \"following the rules becomes dangerous.\" The possession storyline was inspired by folklore about body-snatching spirits and the team's desire to \"challenge the notion that StarClan is always right.\"\nAuthor Kate Cary developed the imposter's manipulative tactics by studying real-world cult leaders, noting how they \"twist language to control followers.\" The decision to make Bramblestar the possessed cat was controversial among fans but intentionally chosen because, as Holmes explained, \"his strict adherence to the code made him the perfect vessel for corruption.\"\nNew illustrator Owen Richardson introduced a darker color palette for covers, reflecting the arc's themes. The writing team also created the \"Place of No Stars\" as a purgatory-like realm for codebreakers, distinct from the previously established Dark Forest.\nPublication history\nLost Stars\nReleased in hardcover on 9 April 2019, this novel debuted at #1 on the New York Times Young Adult Bestseller list. It introduced the \"imposter Bramblestar\" mystery and Rootspring's perspective. The paperback followed on 3 December 2019.\nThe Silent Thaw\nPublished on 29 October 2019, this installment revealed Shadowsight's visions of the real Bramblestar trapped in the Dark Forest. Special editions included a bonus manga about Squirrelflight.\nVeil of Shadows\nReleased on 7 April 2020, this book featured the shocking reveal of the imposter's identity. COVID-19 delays affected its initial print run.\nDarkness Within\nPublished on 3 November 2020, this novel depicted the Clans' first attempt to banish the imposter. The paperback included an exclusive map of the Place of No Stars.\nThe Place of No Stars\nReleased on 6 April 2021, this penultimate installment followed a rescue mission into the afterlife. It became the series' fastest-selling book since Omen of the Stars.\nA Light in the Mist\nThe finale published on 9 November 2021, concluded the possession storyline and reformed StarClan's hierarchy. A special box set with all six books and a poster released simultaneously.\nTranslations appeared in German (2020-2022), French (2021-2023), and Japanese (2022-2024). The German edition by Beltz & Gelberg notably altered the imposter's dialogue to sound more formally sinister.\nSetting and characters\nThe arc expands the series' spiritual cosmology with these key elements:\nThe Place of No Stars: A new afterlife realm for cats who rejected both StarClan and the Dark Forest.\nStarClan's Silence: The ancestral spirits temporarily lose connection with living cats.\nMoonpool/Tunnel: The tunnel beneath the Moonpool becomes a physical bridge between worlds.\nMajor characters\nRootspring: A SkyClan apprentice who can see ghosts, serving as the imposter's primary opponent.\nShadowsight: A ShadowClan medicine cat whose visions accidentally enable the possession.\nBristlefrost: A ThunderClan warrior who sacrifices herself in the finale (later revealed to be permanently dead).\nThe Imposter: A spirit posing as Bramblestar, later revealed to be Ashfur from The Power of Three arc.\nSquirrelflight: Becomes acting ThunderClan leader and central to the imposter's revenge plot.\nSynopsis\nLost Stars\nAfter Bramblestar dies from greencough, he miraculously returns—but acts strangely. Rootspring notices Bramblestar's spirit lingering near camp while an imposter occupies his body. Shadowsight realizes his visions helped enable the possession.\nThe Silent Thaw\nThe imposter manipulates the Clans into exiling \"codebreakers,\" including cats who question him. Shadowsight discovers the real Bramblestar is trapped in the Dark Forest. Squirrelflight is framed for treason.\nVeil of Shadows\nThe imposter is revealed to be Ashfur, a ThunderClan warrior killed years earlier. He seeks revenge on Squirrelflight for rejecting him. StarClan cuts off communication, fearing Ashfur's influence.\nDarkness Within\nThe Clans attempt to drive out Ashfur but fail. Shadowsight is ostracized for his role in the possession. Rootspring and Bristlefrost begin a forbidden cross-Clan relationship.\nThe Place of No Stars\nA team of living cats ventures into the afterlife to rescue Bramblestar. They discover Ashfur has been merging the Dark Forest with StarClan to control both realms.\nA Light in the Mist\nBristlefrost sacrifices herself to drag Ashfur into oblivion, permanently dying in the process. StarClan reforms under new leadership, and the Clans revise the warrior code to be more flexible.\nThemes\nSpiritual Corruption: Ashfur weaponizes StarClan's authority to justify tyranny.\nIdentity: The imposter storyline questions what makes someone \"themselves.\"\nGrief and Closure: Bristlefrost's permanent death contrasts with the series' usual afterlife.\nReformation: The revised warrior code emphasizes intent over rigid rules.\nCritical reception\nThe arc received widespread acclaim for its bold narrative risks:\nPublishers Weekly praised its \"unprecedented stakes\" and called A Light in the Mist \"a watershed moment for the series.\"\nKirkus Reviews noted Ashfur as \"a villain who redefines the series' moral boundaries.\"\nSome fans criticized Bristlefrost's permanent death as \"too harsh\" (School Library Journal), while others applauded its emotional impact.\nThe German translation won the 2022 Jugendbuchpreis for its \"innovative handling of spiritual themes.\"\nReferences"
