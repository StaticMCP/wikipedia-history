From 1968 to 2010, the award was presented by the Australian Film Institute (AFI), the Academy's parent organisation, at the annual Australian Film Institute Awards (known as the AFI Awards). When the AFI launched the Academy in 2011, it changed the annual ceremony to the AACTA Awards, with the current award being a continuum of the AFI Raymond Longford Award.\nOriginally named after Australian prolific producer, director, writer and actor Raymond Longford (1878–1959), the award recognises \"a person who has shown an unwavering commitment over many years to excellence in the film and television industries and has, through their body of work to date, contributed substantially to the enrichment of Australian screen culture\", and is the highest honour the Academy bestows. In 2015, the name of the award was changed to Longford Lyell Award in recognition of Longford's creative and life partner, actress and filmmaker Lottie Lyell.\nRecipients of this award are film and television directors, directors, producers, actors, cinematographers and film editors. People of Australian origin dominate the list, but European-born Australian citizens have also been recognised. The award was first presented to film director and editor Ian Dunlop. The award has also been made posthumously to actor John Meillon in 1989 who died that year.\nRecipients\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\"| Image\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\"| Name\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\"| Country of origin\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\"| Notes\n! style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref(s)\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" align=center| AFI Raymond Longford Award\n|-\n| 1968\n|\n|\n|\n| Director\n|\n|-\n| 1970\n|\n|\n|\n| Director, producer\n|\n|-\n| 1976\n|\n|\n|\n| Director\n|\n|-\n| 1977\n|\n|\n|\n| Director, producer, writer\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1978\n|\n|\n|\n| Filmmaker\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| Filmmaker\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n| Filmmaker\n|\n|-\n| 1979\n|\n|\n|\n| Founding Director of AFTRS\n|\n|-\n| 1980\n|\n|\n|\n| Director\n|\n|-\n| 1981\n|\n|\n|\n| Producer, journalist\n|\n|-\n| 1982\n|\n|\n|\n| Animator\n|\n|-\n| 1983\n|\n|\n|\n| Film technician\n|\n|-\n| 1984\n|\n|\n|\n| Exhibitor, distributor\n|\n|-\n| 1985\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 1986\n|\n|\n|\n| Federal Minister & first Chairman of AFTRS\n|\n|-\n| 1987\n|\n|\n|\n| First Director of NSW Film Corp\n|\n|-\n| 1988\n|\n|\n|\n| Cinematographer\n|\n|-\n| 1989\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 1990\n|\n|\n|\n| Director\n|\n|-\n| 1991\n|\n|\n|\n| Director\n|\n|-\n| 1992\n|\n|\n|\n| Director\n|\n|-\n| 1993\n|\n|\n|\n| Producer\n|\n|-\n| 1994\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 1995\n|\n|\n|\n| Director\n|\n|-\n| 1997\n|\n|\n|\n| Producer\n|\n|-\n| 1998\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 1999\n|\n|\n|\n| Exhibitor, distributor\n|\n|-\n| 2000\n|\n|\n|\n| Producer\n|\n|-\n| 2001\n|\n|\n|\n| Film critic\n|\n|-\n| 2002\n|\n|\n|\n| Producer\n|\n|-\n| 2003\n|\n|\n|\n| Writer, producer, director, choreographer\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n|\n|\n|\n| Producer\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n|\n|\n|\n| Writer, producer, director\n|\n|-\n| 2007\n|\n|\n|\n| Producer\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n|\n| Dione Gilmour\n|\n| Natural History filmmaker\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 2010\n|\n|\n|\n| Broadcaster, producer, entrepreneur\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" align=center| Raymond Longford Award\n|-\n| 2011\n|\n|\n|\n| Cinematographer\n|\n|-\n| 2012\n|\n|\n|\n| Producer\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n|\n|\n|\n| Actress\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#DDDDFF;\" align=center| Longford Lyell Award\n|-\n| 2014\n|\n|\n|\n| Writer, producer\n|\n|-\n| 2015\n|\n|\n|\n| Actress\n|\n|-\n| 2016\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 2017\n|\n|\n|\n| Director\n|\n|-\n| 2018\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 2019\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 2021\n|\n|\n|\n| Actor\n|\n|-\n| 2022\n|\n|\n|\n| Costume & production designer\n|\n|-\n| 2024\n|\n| Working Dog Productions (founded by , , , , and )\n|\n| Production company\n|\n|-\n|}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
