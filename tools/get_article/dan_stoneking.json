He graduated from Rock Island High School in 1960.}} He began in journalism as a correspondent for the Rock Island Argus during high school, and worked summers with the newspaper while studying at Northwestern University. As a senior at the Medill School of Journalism, Stoneking was named to the dean's list, and elected to the university's Sigma Delta Chi chapter of professional journalists. After earning an undergraduate degree in 1964, he remained at Northwestern completing a master's degree in journalism in 1965.\nJournalism career\nAfter university, Stoneking affiliated with the Jewish fraternity Phi Epsilon Pi, then worked for Lloyd Hollister Publications in Wilmette, Illinois, prior to accepting a position with the Minneapolis Star in 1965. He covered professional hockey, the Minnesota Twins, and sports at the University of Minnesota.\nStoneking served in the United States Army from 1966 to 1968. He was sports editor of the Guidon while training at Fort Leonard Wood, then deployed to the Vietnam War in July 1967 to serve in the adjutant general's office as a 1st Air Cavalry Division writer and historian. He rose to the rank of sergeant and received a Bronze Star Medal for heroic action near An Khê by saving the lives of three wounded soldiers from enemy fire. He had taken part in 25 combat missions by November 1967, when named editor of the Stars and Stripes based in Tokyo.\nReturning to Minneapolis, Stoneking was elected secretary-treasurer of the Twin Cities chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America in 1971, then its vice-president in 1972. He became a director of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association (PHWA) in 1971, then elected its vice-president in 1974. Later in the same year, he was named the Minneapolis Star sports editor, while covering National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association games. He assumed the PHWA presidency in 1975 from Bill Brennan, serving two years until succeeded by Bob Verdi. As president, Stoneking oversaw the PHWA mandate of improved media access to cover professional ice hockey.\nFollowing a physical altercation between Detroit Red Wings' coach Doug Barkley and a Newark Star-Ledger reporter during the 1975–76 season, Stoneking protested to NHL president Clarence Campbell writing that the PHWA was \"appalled, disgusted and angered over the incident\" which denied post-game access to the team locker room, and demanded a public apology while the assault charges were under investigation. During the 1976 Stanley Cup Final, Stoneking supported equal access to locker rooms for male and female sportswriters. When Montreal Canadiens' coach Scotty Bowman opposed females in the locker room until the players were dressed, female reporters contested that access was required to do their job as timely as their male counterparts to meet publication deadlines. Stoneking presented the PHWA case to NHL president Campbell that both males and females should be allowed or neither. He claimed that approximately half of NHL teams allowed females to post-game access the locker rooms as of the 1977–78 season, and three quarters of teams by the 1980–81 season.\nIn 1977, Stoneking was elected to the Minnesota Associated Press Sports Editors board of directors, which began broadcasting Minnesota State High School League scores for football state championships and ice hockey state championships via wire service, in addition to publishing a weekly column on high school football.
