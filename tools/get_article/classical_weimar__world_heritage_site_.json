The site was inscribed on 2 December 1998. The properties all bear testimony to the influence of Weimar as a cultural centre of the Enlightenment during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. A number of notable writers and philosophers lived in Weimar between 1772 and 1805, including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Johann Gottfried Herder, Friedrich Schiller, and Christoph Martin Wieland. These figures ushered in and participated in the Weimar Classicism movement, and the architecture of the sites across the city reflects the rapid cultural development of the Classical Weimar era.\nand Schiller]]\nComponent sites\n* Goethe's House, the home of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, built in the Baroque style between 1707 and 1709, and Goethe´s Garden and Garden House in Park an der Ilm\n*Schiller's House, also a Baroque-styled house, built in 1777, though incorporating a sixteenth-century outbuilding\n* Herder Church (Church of St Peter and Paul), Herder House and Old High School, all associated with the philosopher, theologian and poet Johann Gottfried Herder (1774–1803).\n* Schloss Weimar (Residence Castle) and Bastille ensemble\n* The Dowager's Palace (Wittumspalais), consisting of a group of two- and three-storey Baroque buildings\n* Duchess Anna Amalia Library\n* Park on the Ilm with the Roman House\n* Schloss Belvedere and Orangery a two-storey Baroque palace with a U-shaped orangery\n* Schloss Ettersburg and Park, a four-storey structure consisting of three wings and a courtyard\n* Schloss Tiefurt and Park, a stately home that was the summer residence of duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1739–1807).\n* Historical Cemetery, Weimar and the Princes' Tomb\nSee also\n* Klassik Stiftung Weimar\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://artsandculture.google.com/story/2gXB2AYQCtMCzw Classical Weimar] UNESCO collection on Google Arts and Culture"
