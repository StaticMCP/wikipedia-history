In this updated version, both the player and the computer get extra firepower from military aircraft and support weapons. There are even scenarios that start a player off in a pre-played game that he must resume (and overcome a bleak scenario). This video game was mentioned in an old issue of Nintendo Power. There also have been other versions of Battleship, including Battleships for Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum, Battleship for CD-i, Battleship for Game Boy and Game Boy Color, and others for PC and mobile phones. There was a sequel on the Super NES and Sega Genesis, Super Battleship.\nGameplay\nleft\nThe game has eight levels with five battles each and the player must win 40 battles to clear the game. After winning a battle, a password will be provided. New weapons are added each level.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
