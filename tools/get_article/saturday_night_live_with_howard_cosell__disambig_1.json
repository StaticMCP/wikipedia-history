The series ran for 18 episodes before being cancelled. The show was later remembered by its director Don Mischer as \"one of the greatest disasters in the history of television\", largely because Cosell and Arledge—both veterans of sports broadcasting—did not have any experience with comedy and variety programming.\nDespite having highly notable celebrities both as cast members and guests, Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell has never been made available on home video.\nSaturday Night Live with Howard Cosell  is consistently confused with the sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live. In October 1975, rival network NBC began airing the late night comedy show ''NBC's Saturday Night'', the  creation of producer  Lorne Michaels. The shows did not compete for the same time slot. Cosell's Saturday Night Live aired at 8 p.m. ET/PT, whereas ''NBC's Saturday Night'' aired at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. After Cosell's show was cancelled, the NBC show adopted the Saturday Night Live name (although that show continued to be introduced on camera as \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night\").\nHistory\nCast and guests\nThe premiere episode featured celebrity guests Frank Sinatra, Shirley Bassey, Paul Anka, Siegfried and Roy, Yogi Berra, and the cast of the Broadway musical of The Wiz, who opened up the show as they danced out of the Majestic Theatre onto a yellow brick road as they sang their pop hit \"Ease on Down the Road\" straight to the Ed Sullivan Theater as they met and escorted Howard Cosell on stage, tennis pro Jimmy Connors (who sang, while profusely sweating, Anka's \"Girl, You Turn Me On\" as a dedication to his girlfriend Chris Evert.  Anka played the piano to accompany Connors), and John Denver.  The episode's musical guest was the Bay City Rollers, from Scotland, whom Cosell dubbed \"the next\" British phenomenon.\nThe show featured Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, and Christopher Guest as regular comedy performers, dubbed \"The Prime Time Players\". In response, NBC's show Saturday Night called its regular performers \"The Not-Ready-for-Prime-Time Players\" (especially since the show didn't air in prime time, but late-night). Eventually, Murray, Doyle-Murray, and Guest would all work on the NBC program.[http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2006/02/saturday_night.html Old TV Tickets]  Billy Crystal, who appeared on the premiere episode of Cosell's program, was also scheduled to appear on the premiere episode of the NBC show, but was bumped when the show ran long; he later joined the NBC program's cast, along with Guest, during Season 10 a decade later. Also that season, Cosell himself guest-hosted the NBC program in its season finale on April 13, 1985.\nCancellation\nMischer described the show as chronically hectic and unprepared. He recalled one particular episode wherein executive producer Roone Arledge discovered that jazz musician Lionel Hampton was in New York City and invited him to appear on the show an hour before airtime.\nThe show fared poorly among critics and audiences alike, with TV Guide calling it \"dead on arrival, with a cringingly awkward host\". Alan King—the show's \"executive in charge of comedy\"—later admitted that it was difficult trying to turn Cosell into a variety show host, saying that he \"made Ed Sullivan look like Buster Keaton\".\nABC announced the cancellation of Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell in November 1975, becoming the first casulaty of the 1975-76 season. The eighteen and final episode was aired on January 17, 1976. A year later, in 1977, NBC's Saturday Night added Live to its name.\nReception\nIn 2002, TV Guide ranked the series number 37 on its \"50 Worst TV Shows of All Time\" list. In his book What Were They Thinking? The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History, author David Hofstede ranked the series at #30 on the list.\nEpisodes\nOnly three episodes are known to survive on video:\n* September 20, 1975: Billy Crystal, Frank Sinatra, Bay City Rollers,The Wiz\n* October 11, 1975: Barry Manilow, Aretha Franklin, The Rockettes\n* November 8, 1975: Roy Clark, Billy Crystal, Ted Kennedy, Chita Rivera as herself/Velma Kelly, and Gwen Verdon as herself/Roxie Hart.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
