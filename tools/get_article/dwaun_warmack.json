He received his doctorate in educational leadership with a specialization in higher education from Union University in Jackson, Tennessee in 2011. He completed his post-doctoral studies in educational leadership at Harvard University School of Education in 2015.\nCareer\nIn 1999, his work in higher education began at his alma mater, Delta State University, as coordinator of student development and activities and as a financial aid counselor until 2002 when he was then promoted to director of multicultural affairs and multicultural center.\nHe worked at Western Carolina University (WCU), as an associate director of the University Center and director of programs, before joining Rhodes.

Warmack was named the publication's Person of the Year. It was a decision that recognized him for his bold and effective leadership and confirmed that the campus community, residents of the state of South Carolina, and beyond profoundly appreciate and respect the \"Elevation and Transformation\" that has permeated the campus since his arrival in August 2019.\nIn 2000, Warmack was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa as a faculty and staff member at Delta State University.\nHe has appeared in the Detroit Free Press and on NPR to discuss educational issues that impact the nation.
