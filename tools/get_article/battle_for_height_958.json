In German and Austrian literature, this event is practically not mentioned anywhere, but in Ukrainian literature this event is very well covered because the bulk of the troops in the battle were Ukrainians. The battle ended with the capture of the height, but the Russians could not develop a major offensive to the rear of the Austro-Hungarian forces.\nBackground\nMarkova (Makivka in Ukrainian) is a hill in the Carpathian mountains.\nLegacy\nThe battle is a source of national pride in Ukraine. It was the first major battle of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen. The battle also raised the morale of the Ukrainian people. The battle is celebrated in museum displays, monuments, patriotic songs and a movie.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nNotes"
