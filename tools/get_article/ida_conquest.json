Her father was a partner in a successful fish wholesale business.\nTheater actress\nConquest's enthusiasm for theater dated from her childhood when she was in a production of Pinafore at the Boston Museum. She made her first appearance in New York at the Fifth Avenue Theatre on January 28, 1893, as the First Girl Friend in The Harvest. She began at the bottom of the ladder and according to a writer in 1900, \"her advancement was thoroughly legitimate, meaning good hard work with every rung.\" The same reporter noted her charm, intelligence, and fine education.\nShe was the leading woman for John Drew, Richard Mansfield, and William Gillette. Conquest appeared in many roles in New York City and London, England before retiring from the stage in 1911.\nShe made her stage debut at Miner's Theater on Fifth Avenue on January 25, 1893.

Conquest also worked with Nethersole in Camille, portraying Nanine.\nShe traveled to London's Garrick Theatre in 1898 with Gillette, in Too Much Johnson. At the Empire Theatre in New York City Conquest was successful in The Second In Command (1901) with Drew. Together with Drew she starred in Richard Carvel, a play based on a best-selling novel written by the American novelist Winston Churchill. Drew and Conquest again teamed to make The Tyranny of Tears. Conquest succeeded Isabel Irving as the leading lady of the John Drew Company.\nShe played numerous parts at the Empire Theatre.

Bertelli, a graduate of the University of Turin, established himself in New York in the decade before he married Conquest. He was the oldest son of Admiral Luigi Bertelli of Genoa. Conquest left the stage after she wed Bertelli.\nShe wore a coronet which she crafted herself in the role of Sylvia in The Little Brother of the Rich. It was copied from a spray of mistletoe. She designed jewelry while she traveled, using a sketch pad and pencil as she became inspired. Conquest worked with rings, cameos, and lapis lazuli.
