These cultures, named after their type sites located 17 km apart, are now recognized as two phases of a single cultural continuum known as the Qujialing–Shijiahe culture. They succeeded the earlier Daxi culture (5000–3300 BCE) in the region and represent a significant development in Neolithic society, characterized by large-scale settlements, advanced agriculture, and specialized craftsmanship.\nLocation, dating, discovery history, and environmental context\nThe Qujialing and Shijiahe sites, located in the Jianghan Plain of Hubei, were first identified as distinct cultures in the 1950s but were reclassified in 2013 as sequential phases of the same culture. The Qujialing site, representing the earlier phase, is situated in Jingshan County, while the Shijiahe site lies in Tianmen County. Initial excavations took place from 1955 to 1957.\nThe culture’s timeline spans approximately 3400–2100 BCE, with some scholars suggesting that earlier evidence (3400–3000 BCE) may belong to the final phase of the Daxi culture. Geographically, the culture thrived in the middle Yangtze region, bordered by the Dabie Mountains to the west, Dongting Lake to the north, the Three Gorges to the east, and the Nanyang Basin to the south. Most sites are located north of the Yangtze between modern Yichang and Wuhan, with some extending southwest to the southern bank of the river. These lowland sites, situated on slightly elevated terrain amidst plains and low hills, were ideal for agriculture and facilitated trade via the Yangtze.\nThe region was historically dominated by wetlands, rivers, lakes, and marshes, with settlements built on raised ground to avoid flooding. Archaeological evidence from the shores of Dongting Lake, recently embanked for farmland, reveals stilted structures from the Pengtoushan culture and Daxi culture, indicating a subtropical environment with deciduous and evergreen forests. Algae remains suggest periodic flooding. The climate was warm and humid during the culture’s early phases but became drier, transitioning to grasslands and scrub, which coincided with reduced human activity.\nSubsistence\nAgriculture in the region has deep roots, with evidence of rice cultivation dating back to the Daxi culture. Early rice farming relied on drainage systems, but by the third millennium BCE, irrigated rice paddies emerged, as seen at the Chengtoushan site with its reservoirs. The Qujialing–Shijiahe culture cultivated Oryza sativa (Asian rice), Setaria italica (foxtail millet), and Panicum miliaceum (common millet), alongside vegetables, amaranths, and plants now considered weeds.\nEmergence of fortified settlements\nThe Qujialing–Shijiahe culture marked a significant population increase, with the establishment of large, often circular, fortified settlements. Some areas saw a quadrupling of settlement numbers and a five- to sixfold increase in their size by the middle Shijiahe phase, followed by a sharp decline below Daxi-era levels. These settlements, often grouped into small communities, included eight known sites encircled by earthen walls or moats, which expanded until the middle Shijiahe phase.\nCompared to the Daxi culture’s largest site, Chengtoushan (6–8 ha), Qujialing reached 263 ha, and Shijiahe expanded to 800 ha. These fortifications likely served defensive purposes, reflecting the rise of early states like the Shang dynasty and inter-city rivalries. At Xiaojia Wuji (Shijiahe), a depiction of a warrior wielding a yue-type battle axe suggests conflict. Population growth and resource competition likely drove the formation of larger, more organized communities.\nQujialing and Shijiahe sites\nThe Qujialing site features a central urban area of 70 ha enclosed by a moat 25–30 m wide and 3 m deep, surrounded by ten residential zones and additional dwellings beyond the moat. The Shijiahe complex, spanning 8 km² across terraces between two rivers, comprises about 40 dispersed sites. Its central settlement, a near-perfect square kilometer, is the largest of its kind in Neolithic China. Originating as a small Daxi-era village, it grew into a fortified agglomeration by the late Qujialing phase and was abandoned by the end of Shijiahe. The complex, covering 120 ha, features earthen walls and moats up to 100 m wide, designed to manage flooding from the Han River and local streams.\nShijiahe houses exhibit varied designs, including concave-shaped structures, enclosed courtyards, and interlinked buildings, typically housing 20–30 people per courtyard, suggesting extended family or clan units. Larger dwellings within fortified areas likely served elite or specialized functions. Cemeteries near courtyards, containing about 20 graves, reinforce the clan-based social structure.\nCraftsmanship, funerary practices, and symbolism\nSpecialized craft production is evident at several sites. At Dengjiawan, 17 pits contained over 10,000 small clay figurines (5–10 cm) depicting birds, hens, dogs, sheep, turtles, pigs, elephants, tigers, and humans, including one holding a fish and others in dance poses, likely used for religious purposes. Similar figurines have been found in Hunan and Henan. Other sites yielded thousands of red pottery cups, suggesting pottery workshops, or stone drills indicative of jade or stone working.\nQujialing ceramics, building on Daxi traditions, incorporated Yangshao and Dawenkou influences, introducing wheel-thrown vessels like bowls (wan), plates (dou), and jars (guan), reflecting increased productivity by specialized potters. Funerary urns were common, accompanied by diverse vessels like cups (bei), with some tombs containing up to 20 pots or red and yellow lacquered wares. Early copper objects, the southernmost found in Neolithic China, appeared at Dengjiawan.\nIn the late Shijiahe phase (2200–2000 BCE), jade became prominent in burials, with some tombs containing up to 56 pieces, including anthropomorphic figures, monstrous forms, cong tubes, birds, dragons, cicadas, and phoenixes, resembling Liangzhu culture artifacts. One male burial included 99 pottery jars.\nDecline\nBy 2000 BCE, fortifications were no longer maintained, and the population declined significantly, unlike the abrupt collapse of the Liangzhu culture. Some sites show traces of the Longshan culture from the Central Plain.\nBaodun culture (2500–1700 BCE)\nThe Baodun culture, recently identified in the Chengdu Plain near the Min River, features walled settlements (10–60 ha) adapted to frequent flooding. Excavations at Baodun and Guchengcun uncovered large public buildings, but no clear evidence of social inequality has emerged. Subsistence included agriculture, hunting, and fishing, based on tools found at the sites.\nCharacteristic artifacts\nQujialing culture\nFile:Qujialing Culture Skeleton & Burial Vessels.jpg|Burial with funerary pottery, Luoshishan, Huanggang\nFile:Qujialing pottery and stone axes.jpg|Black pottery and polished stone axes, Qujiapo cemetery\nFile:Qujialing Pottery Ritual Vessels.jpg|Ceramic funerary vessels\nShijiahe culture\nFile:Shijiahe clay animals, bear and monkey.jpg|Clay figurines: bear and monkey\nFile:Shijiahe clay figurine of a hen.
