Ninety-nine of the seats were in single-member districts using the first-past-the-post electoral system, and the constituencies of Cork City and Dublin University were two-member districts using block voting.\nIn the election as a whole, the Liberal Party won a clear majority in the election across the United Kingdom and Henry Campbell-Bannerman was appointed as Prime Minister. This was the first time since the split in the Liberal Party in 1886 that they governed without the support of the Irish Parliamentary Party.\nThe Irish Parliamentary Party won 81 of the 103 Irish seats on 21.5% of the vote because, in many constituencies, the candidates were unopposed.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party || rowspan=\"2\"|Leader || colspan=\"3\"|Seats || colspan=\"3\"|Votes\n|-\n!# of Seats|| Seat Change || Uncontested || # of Votes || % of Votes\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Parliamentary Party\n|John Redmond\n|81\n|1\n|73\n|28,292\n|21.5\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Irish Unionist\n|Walter Long\n|16\n|2\n|8\n|56,109\n|42.7\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Russellite Unionist\n|Thomas Russell\n|2\n|New\n|0\n|26,183\n|19.9\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal Unionist\n|Joseph Chamberlain\n|1\n| 2\n|0\n|4,719\n|3.6\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Unionist\n|\n|1\n| 1\n|0\n|4,450\n|3.4\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Nationalist\n|\n|1\n|\n|1\n|3,931\n|3.0\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Liberal\n|Henry Campbell-Bannerman\n|1\n|\n|0\n|2,966\n|2.3\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Labour\n|Keir Hardie\n|0\n|\n|0\n|4,616\n|3.5\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: \" |\n|Independent Liberal Unionist\n|\n|0\n|\n|0\n|153\n|0.1\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"font-weight:bold; background:rgb(232,232,232);\"\n|colspan=3|Total\n|103\n|\n|82\n|131419\n|100\n|- style=\"background-color:#F6F6F6\"\n|colspan=\"9\" align=\"left\"|Source: B.M.
