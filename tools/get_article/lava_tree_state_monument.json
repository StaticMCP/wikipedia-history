Facilities include restrooms, picnic tables, and 3 covered structures to provide refuge from the rain or  sun. It is open daily during daylight hours only, since there are no lights on the path.\nNo camping, and no mountain bikes are allowed in the park. There are no water fountains at the park; bring your own water. Although there is a paved path, tree roots have lifted and separated parts of the path so toddlers and the elderly may need assistance.\nDirections\nFrom the Hawaii Belt Road (State Route 11), take Highway 130, known as Keaau-Pāhoa Road, toward the town of Pāhoa.\nBypass the first intersection that would take you into Pāhoa by staying to the left. Continue to the traffic light where Pāhoa Bypass Road, Keaau-Pāhoa Rd and Pāhoa-Kapoho roads meet.\nAt this intersection, make a left onto Highway 132, Pāhoa-Kapoho Road.\nContinue for about  to Lava Tree Road on your left.\nThe park is located on your right, about  down Lava Tree Road.\nHistory\nThe land was once part of the extensive ranch of William Herbert Shipman.\nAlthough ancient Hawaiians knew the molds were from a lava flow, one of the first to propose that they were from former trees was Rufus Anderson Lyman.\nIt was closed in May 2018 due to the eruption of Kīlauea when lava flows approached the park.\nGallery\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC02.JPG|Path\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC03.JPG|Lava Trees\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC04.JPG|Shelter\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC05.JPG|Lava Trees\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC06.JPG|Lava Trees\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC07.JPG|Lava Trees and path\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC09.JPG|Inside view of lava tree with moss\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC10.JPG|Large lava tree that fell and broke apart\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC11.JPG|Lava tree\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC13.JPG|Lava formation inside one of the lava trees\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC14.JPG|Plant life\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC15.JPG|Plant life\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC16.JPG|Orchid growing in the wild\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC19.JPG|Plant life near deep cut in the ground\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC23.JPG|Plant life with morning dew\nFile:Hawaii Lava Tree State Park SAC26.JPG|Plant life and moss growing inside trunk of lava tree\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/hawaii/lava-tree-state-monument/ Official site]\n*[https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/images/pglossary/treemold.php \"Tree Molds\"] USGS Photo Glossary page\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131224031604/http://www.hawaiiweb.com/hawaii/lava-tree-state-park-hawaii-the-big-island.html Lava Tree State Park] on Hawaiiweb.com (archived)"
