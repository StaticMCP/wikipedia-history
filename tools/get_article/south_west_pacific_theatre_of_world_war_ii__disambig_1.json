The Australian army was the first to inflict defeat on the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II at the Battle of Milne Bay in August–September 1942.]]\nThe South West Pacific theatre, during World War II, was a major theatre of the war between the Allies and the Axis. It included the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), Borneo, Australia, its mandate Territory of New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago) and the Solomon Islands' western part. This area was defined by the Allied powers' South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command.\nJapanese forces fought primarily against the United States and Australian forces in the South West Pacific theatre. The Philippines, New Zealand, the Netherlands (in the Dutch East Indies), the United Kingdom, and other Allied nations also contributed forces.\nThe South Pacific became a major theatre of the war following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Initially, US war plans called for a counteroffensive across the Central Pacific, but this was disrupted by the loss of battleships at Pearl Harbor. During the First South Pacific Campaign, US forces sought to establish a defensive perimeter against additional Japanese attacks. This was followed by the Second South Pacific Campaign, which began with the Battle of Guadalcanal.\nAllied command\n'' (center left) protects three Allied transport ships (background and center right) unloading troops and supplies at Tulagi.]]\nThe U.S. General Douglas MacArthur had been in command of the American forces in the Philippines in what was to become the South West Pacific theatre, but was then part of a larger theatre that encompassed the South West Pacific, the Southeast Asian mainland (including Indochina and Malaya) and the North of Australia, under the short lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM). Shortly after the collapse of ABDACOM, the supreme command of the South West Pacific theatre passed to MacArthur, appointed Supreme Commander, South West Pacific Area, on 30 March 1942. However, MacArthur preferred to use the title \"Commander-in-Chief.\" The forces remaining in South-East Asia under Japanese attack reverted to their local commanders, and were soon mostly destroyed or evacuated.\nThe other major theatre in the Pacific, Pacific Ocean Areas, was commanded by U.S. Admiral Chester Nimitz, who was also Commander-in-Chief Pacific Fleet. The US Joint Chiefs and the British-U.S. Combined Chiefs of Staff oversaw MacArthur and Nimitz. Captain Allan Rockwell McCann was appointed to represent the Navy as General MacArthur's Senior Representative of Commander, Submarines, Southwest Pacific.\nJapanese command\nMost Japanese forces in the theatre were part of the , which was formed on November 6, 1941, under General Hisaichi Terauchi (also known as Count Terauchi). The Nanpo gun was responsible for Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) ground and air units in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The  of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was responsible for all Japanese warships, naval aviation units and marine infantry units. As the Japanese military did not formally utilize joint/combined staff at the operational level, the command structures/geographical areas of operations of the Nanpo gun and Rengō Kantai overlapped each other and those of the Allies.\nMajor campaigns\nrun sometime in 1942.]]\nof the 3rd Attack Group bombs a Japanese merchant ship off New Guinea during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, March 1943.]]\n, Philippine Islands, 20 October 1944.]]\ntransport Australian troops during the Battle of Balikpapan, Borneo, 1 July 1945.]]\n* Battle of the Philippines (1941–1942)\n** Battle of Bataan\n** Battle of Corregidor\n** Battle of Panay\n** Battle of Cebu\n** Battle of Davao\n** Battle of Lanao\n* Dutch East Indies campaign, 1941–1942\n** Battle of Badung Strait, 19–20 February 1942\n** Battle of the Java Sea, 27 February 1942\n** Battle of Sunda Strait, 28 February – 1 March 1942\n** Second Battle of the Java Sea, 1 March 1942\n* Battle of Timor, 1942–1943\n* Solomon Islands campaign, 1943–1945\n** New Georgia Campaign, June–August 1943\n** Battle of Kula Gulf, 6 July 1943\n** Battle of Kolombangara, 13 July 1943\n** Battle of Vella Gulf, 6–7 August 1943\n** Naval Battle of Vella Lavella, 6–7 October 1943\n** Battle of the Treasury Islands, 27 October-12 November 1943\n** Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, 2 November 1943\n** Battle of Cape St. George, 25 November 1943\n** Bougainville Campaign, November 1943 – August 1945\n* New Guinea campaign, 1942–1945\n** Battle of Rabaul, January–February 1942\n** Invasion of Salamaua–Lae, March 1942\n** Battle of the Coral Sea, 4–8 May 1942\n** Invasion of Buna-Gona, July 1942\n** Kokoda Track campaign, July–November 1942\n** Battle of Milne Bay, August–September 1942\n** Battle of Goodenough Island, October 1942\n** Battle of Buna-Gona, November 1942 – January 1943\n** Battle of Wau, January 1943\n** Battle of the Bismarck Sea, 2 March 1943\n** Operation Chronicle, 1943\n** Landing at Nassau Bay, 1943\n** Salamaua-Lae campaign, April–September 1943\n** Finisterre Range campaign, September 1943 – April 1944\n** Huon Peninsula campaign, September 1943 – March 1944\n** New Britain campaign, 26 December 1943\n** Admiralty Islands campaign, 29 February 1944\n** Invasion of Hollandia and landing at Aitape, 22 April 1944\n** Battle of Biak, 27 May 1944\n** Battle of Noemfoor, 2 July 1944\n** Battle of Morotai, 15 September 1944\n** Aitape-Wewak campaign, November 1944\n* Philippines campaign (1944–1945)\n** Battle of Leyte, October–December 1944\n** Battle of Leyte Gulf, 23–26 October 1944\n** Battle of Mindoro, December 1944\n** Battle of Lingayen Gulf, January 1945\n** Battle of Luzon, January–August 1945\n** Battle of Manila, February–March 1945\n** Battle of Corregidor, February 1945\n** Invasion of Palawan, February–April 1945\n** Battle of the Visayas, March–July 1945\n** Battle of Mindanao, March–August 1945\n** Battle of Maguindanao, January–September 1945\n* Borneo campaign, 1945\n** Battle of Tarakan, May–June 1945\n** Battle of North Borneo, June–August 1945\n** Battle of Balikpapan, July 1945\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* - Translation of the official record by the Japanese Demobilization Bureaux detailing the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy's participation in the Southwest Pacific area of the Pacific War."
