It is the world's third-largest building by floor area. It is served by Jincheng Plaza station of Line 1 of the Chengdu Metro.\nSize\nThe  tall structure has a  base with  of floor space, making it the world's largest building measured by floor area.\nDevelopment\nDeveloped by billionaire Deng Hong's Entertainment and Travel Group (ETG), nearly  of the building is devoted to shopping. It also houses offices, conference rooms, a university complex, two commercial centers, hotels, an IMAX cinema, a \"Mediterranean village\", a pirate ship and an Olympic-size skating rink. The centerpiece of the building is a water park (\"Paradise Island Water Park\"), containing a  artificial beach, where a large  screen forms the horizon to offer sunrises and sunsets. At night, a stage extends out over the pool for concerts. A stand has been built overlooking the pool with a food court and entrance underneath at the floor level. The new InterContinental Hotel will feature 1,009 rooms that are spread over 6 by 8 story blocks around the edge of the complex. The center is connected to Line&nbsp;1 of the Chengdu Metro.\nThe building will eventually face the Chengdu Contemporary Arts Center, designed by Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid.\nWhile the exact cost to build such a building remains undisclosed by the Chinese Government. Estimates put it between $8 and $10 Billion Dollars.\nControversy\nAlthough parts of the shopping area opened in early 2013, the center was supposed to have formally opened in March 2013 when it hosted the Global Fortune 500 conference. However, the businessman behind the project, Deng Hong, was arrested on corruption charges; further, \"given the potential for political humiliation,\" the conference was moved to the Shangri-La Hotel in Chengdu.\nThe opening was delayed until 22 August 2013; it was then scaled back after the arrest of more than 50 local government officials being detained in a series of overlapping investigations.\nSee also\n*List of largest buildings\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.whitewaterwest.com/paradiseisland.html Paradise Island Water Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171001221011/http://www.etgcn.com/english/upload_en/etg_en/aboutgc/aboutgc.html Global Center — To see the world and to attract the world] (archived 1 October 2017)"
