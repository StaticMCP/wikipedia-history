Under the command of Brigadier-General F.S. Montague-Bates, 242 Bde initially comprised three Indian Army battalions, with a proportion of British Army support troops, all drawn from 28th Division, which was serving in Turkey at the time; a British infantry battalion (1st Gordon Highlanders, from the Army of Occupation in Germany) was soon added. The brigade was formally attached to 28th Division from 6 June to 15 September 1920.\nOrder of battle\nDuring its short existence, 242 Bde was constituted as follows:\n* General Officer Commanding: Brig.-Gen. F.S. Montague-BatesBrig.-Gen. H.A.V. Cummins\n* 1st Battalion Gordon Highlanders\n* 1st Battalion 10th Jats\n* 1st Battalion 21st Punjabis\n* 1st Battalion 25th Punjabis\nAttached:\n* 20th Hussars\n* Anatolian Mounted Infantry\n* 51st Battery Royal Field Artillery (18-pounders) from 39th Field Brigade\n* Section 39th Field Brigade Ammunition Column\n* 26th Field Company Royal Engineers\n* One company 2nd Battalion 128th Pioneers\n* One section Z Company Machine Gun Corps\n* 84th Field Ambulance Royal Army Medical Corps\n* A and B echelons Royal Army Service Corps\nOn 13 July the 20th Hussars took part in one of the last mounted actions by British cavalry, during an operation against Turkish nationalists.\nDuring August Major-General Edmund Ironside took over command of the troops in the Izmit area (which became 'Ironside Force'). When Montague-Bates authorised a sortie over the River Sarkaria to protect his perimeter against attacks by Nationalist Turks, Ironside reprimanded him. One of Montague-Bates' staff reported that the two generals 'had heated words' and 'When Brigadier Bates came out of the meeting he was white with rage, said good-bye, and having collected his belongings left with hardly a word'. Montague-Bates returned to Constantinople and was sent home. He was replaced in command of 242 Bde by Brigadier-General H.A.V. Cummins.\nIn September 1920 the Greek Army took over the Izmit Front, which allowed the British Army of Occupation to be reduced. 242 Brigade was disbanded on 3 October and the troops dispersed, most of them joining 84th Brigade of 28th Division at Haydarpaşa.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Maj A.F.
