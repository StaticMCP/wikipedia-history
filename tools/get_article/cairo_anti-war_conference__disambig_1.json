The Cairo Conference set up the International Campaign Against Aggression on Iraq which helped to coordinate the worldwide demonstrations on 15 February 2003. In 2009, the Conference was banned by the government of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\nFirst Conference – 2002\nThe first conference was held on 17–19 December 2002, at the Conrad Hotel on the banks of the Nile. Four hundred attended. Speakers included former United Nations (UN) humanitarian coordinator for Iraq Dr Hans von Sponeck. Former Algerian president Ahmed Ben Bella chaired the conference. One outcome of the conference was the production of the 'Cairo Declaration', which took a stance against the then-looming Iraq War; it also noted the negative effects of capitalist globalisation and U.S. hegemony on the peoples of the world (including European and American citizens). In addition, it noted that \"In the absence of democracy, and with widespread corruption and oppression constituting significant obstacles along the path of the Arab peoples' movement towards economic, social, and intellectual progress, adverse consequences are further aggravated within the framework of the existing world order of neoliberal globalisation\", while firmly rejecting the 'advance of democracy' justification for attacking Iraq.\nThe British Stop the War Coalition, in particular John Rees of the SWP, initiated the signing of the declaration by European leftists, including politicians Jeremy Corbyn, George Galloway and Tony Benn, Susan George (scholar/activist based in France), Bob Crow, Mick Rix (general secretary, UK train drivers' Aslef union), Julie Christie, George Monbiot, Harold Pinter, Ghayasuddin Siddiqui (Muslim Parliament), Tommy Sheridan (Scottish socialist), Dr Ghada Karmi (research fellow, Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, University of Exeter), Tariq Ali.\nThe conference was followed by a 1,000-strong anti-war demonstration that was surrounded by riot police and armoured cars.\nThe organising committee decided to attempt solidarity actions with the US demonstrations on 18 January and to organise Egyptian demonstrations as part of 15 February global anti-war day.\nSecond Conference – 2003\nHeld 13 and 14 December 2003, at the Egyptian Journalists' Union headquarters. This had 800 attendees. George Galloway, Tony Benn, Salma Yaqoob, and former US attorney-general Ramsey Clark were among the international speakers. Prominent Egyptian campaigners taking part included Nasserist MP Hamdeen Sabahy, Galal Aref, head of the Egyptian Journalists' Union, and Ma'mun al-Hodeiby, leader of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. Egyptian novelist Sonallah Ibrahim and human rights activist Aida Seif-al-Dawla were among the conference organisers.\nThe presence of Muslim Brotherhood leader Ma'mun al-Hodeiby brought a large number of Islamist activists into the conference. The Muslim Brotherhood, although officially banned, is by far Egypt's largest opposition organisation. However, some delegates were critical of the Muslim Brotherhood's cooperation with the government in a series of stage-managed anti-war rallies held before the invasion of Iraq.\nGerman journalist Harold Schuman who attended the conference expressed frustration that most speeches did not analyse the role of Arab governments but rather took the easy way out by placing all the blame on the US. He also expressed his feelings that the conference should defend the people of Iraq but not the regime. Representatives of the Iraqi government were attending the conference, though also the Iraqi opposition had a presence in the form of Abdel-Amir Al-Rikabi who described himself as a member of \"the honest opposition\" in contrast with those who met at a US-sponsored event in London.\nThird Conference – 2005\n24–27 March 2005. Political groups, independent activists, and organisations in Egypt were invited to take part in the conference and also to propose their own activities to take place at the same time as the conference.\nBefore the conference Yehia Fikri, who represents the Center for Socialist Studies on the organising committee, called for International delegations to come to the conference in order to protect it from state repression. He has said \"The more people who come from abroad, the more prominent personalities who sign up for the conference, the more difficult it will be for the Egyptian authorities to shut us down.\" [http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php4?article_id=5774]\nEgyptian organisations supported the third conference\nI.

The declaration expressed support for the Hamas government of the Palestinian National Authority against the U.S., Europe and Arab regimes, and opposition to \"a peace process that has achieved nothing for the Palestinian people during the last two decades\", while rejecting both recognition of Israel and any concessions to it on \"the main national demands\".\nThe declaration also stated the ambition to break what it termed \"the siege\" on the resistance in Iraq, called on neighbouring countries to support \"the legitimate Iraqi resistance\", and took the position that the Iraqi resistance is \"the sole representative of the Iraqi People\". In regard to escalating American pressure on Iran and Syria, the conference agreed on an international day of solidarity with Iran and Syria on 6 May 2006, an ambition that was reiterated regarding Iran in a separate call for \"international coordinated action\" that was attached to the declaration.\nThe declaration also called for \"a new Arab movement for change\", including \"all possible forms of coordination between different democracy movements\" and the formation of support committees to protect judges, journalists, lecturers and students against repression.\nFifth Conference – 2007\nThe fifth Cairo Conference was held between March 29 and April 1, 2007. Its declaration is here [https://www.socialistviewpoint.org/feb_03/feb_03_13.html]. According to the Al-Ahram, the conference was organised by  Alkarama (Dignity), Al-Ishtirakyin Al-Sawryin (Socialist Revolutionary Party), Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimin (Muslim Brotherhood) and Al-'Amal (Labour), and was held at the Egyptian Press Syndicate, with close to 600 participants and observers from around the world, including a delegation of 80 South Koreans and 20 Canadians. The Muslim Brotherhood reported there were activists present from Palestine (including Hamas members), Iraq, Lebanon, Venezuela, Turkey, Greece, Nigeria, Britain, Tunisia, Sudan, France and Iran. Speakers included Ali Fayed of Hizbullah, Sadala Mazraani of the Lebanese Communist Party, James Clark of the Canadian Peace Alliance, Feroze Mithiborwala of the Muslim Intellectual Forum of India, John Rees of the Socialist Workers Party (UK) and Rose Gentle (the mother of Gordon Gentle, a British soldier killed while serving in Iraq, and a leading figure in Military Families Against the War).\nSixth Conference – 2008\nThe sixth Cairo antiwar conference was held March 27–30, 2008.\nSeventh Conference – 2009\n\"The seventh Cairo anti-war conference was cancelled after being denied access to a venue\".\nThe Egyptian government and the Cairo conference\nAlthough the Egyptian government was formally against the Iraq War, relations between it and the conference are strained by the fact that Hosni Mubarak's regime received funding from the United States and that the regime feared popular movements which may have grown to challenge its dictatorship.\nCriticism\nAmong the criticisms of the first Conference was that it was building solidarity not with ordinary Iraqis, but rather with the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. This perception was fueled by the reported presence of a number of Iraqi officials at the conference. According to Al-Ahram Weekly, German journalist and author Harald Schuman attracted the ire of Nabil Negm, the chief political adviser to the Iraqi president, after comments he made insisting that claims that all the problems of the Arab world could be laid at the door of the US were only half-true and that the conference was not meant to \"defend the Iraqi regime and Saddam Hussein in any shape or form\". \"I am here,\" he said, \"to defend the Iraqi people.\"\nFurther information\n* Article on state repression of Egyptian anti-war movement [https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/03/egypt032403.htm]\n* Article on the relationship between anti-war movement and movement for democracy in the Middle East[https://web.archive.org/web/20041215022523/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/618/sc2.htm]\nReferences\nFirst Conference\n* [http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php4?article_id=2060 Article on 1st conference], Socialist Worker\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050404204531/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/618/sc1.htm Report on first conference] by Al-Ahram\n* Stan Crooke, \"The Politics of the Cairo Declaration,\" New Politics, Vol. IX, No. 3 (New Series), Summer 2003, pp.&nbsp;120–126.\nSecond Conference\n* [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8716 Article on the 2nd conference] , Socialist Worker\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041212190258/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/666/eg3.htm Report on second conference] by Al-Ahram\nThird Conference\n* [http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php4?article_id=5774 Article on the call for a 3rd conference], Socialist Worker\n* [http://ia201102.eu.archive.org/hdb1/movies/Falluja_Peace_Gdns_10Nov04_Cairo/Falluja_Peace_Gdns_10Nov04_Cairo_256kb.mp4 Video of Report of Conference at Manchester Peace Rally]\n* [https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/regions/westcountry/2004/01/283366.html Swindon delegates report back from Cairo anti-war conference] (indymedia)\nFourth Conference\n* [http://www.antiimperialista.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=4309&Itemid=55 Final Declaration of the Cairo Conference 2006]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070103152924/http://www.resist.org.uk/reports/archive/cairoconf06/index.php Invitation to the Conference (includes links to the Conference Briefing and Program)]"
