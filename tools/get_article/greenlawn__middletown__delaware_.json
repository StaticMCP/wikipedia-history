It was built about 1810, and radically altered about 1860.  It was a two-story, five-bay, brick dwelling with cross-gable roof with dormers. It had a rear brick ell with attached wing. It featured a three-bay front porch, large brackets, a widow's walk on the roof, and ornate chimney caps.  It was originally built in the Late Georgian style, then modified with Late Victorian details.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and demolished in about 1985.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
