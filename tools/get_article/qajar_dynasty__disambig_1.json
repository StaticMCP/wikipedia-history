The dynasty ruled Iran from 1789 until 1925, upon the Unification of Iran (1779–1796) by Mohammad Khan Qajar ().\nThe Russian branch of the Qajar dynasty belonged to the Russian Nobility and were given the titles Prince Persidskii and Princess Persidskaya by the Tsar in the 19th century, of which many members have hold high functions in the Imperial Russian Army, such as Aleksander Reza Qoli Mirza Qajar.\nThe dynasty's effective rule in Iran ended in 1925 when Iran's Majlis, convening as a constituent assembly on 12 December 1925, declared Reza Shah, a former brigadier-general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, as the new shah of Pahlavi Iran.\nHead of the Qajar tribe\n, Anoushirvan Khan Qajar (d.1866)]]\nThe Qajar dynasty, as the ruling lineage, held prominent positions as tribal heads long before establishing imperial rule, leveraging their military prowess and tribal alliances to unify the country amid post-Safavid chaos.\nDuring the establishment of the Safavids. When Ismail led the 7,000 tribal soldiers on his successful expedition from Erzincan to Shirvan in 1500/1501, a contingent of Qajars was among them. After this, they emerged as a prominent group within the Qizilbash confederacy, who were made up of Turkoman warriors and served as the main force of the Safavid military. Despite being smaller than other tribes, the Qajars continued to play a major role in important events during the 16th century.\nThe immediate ancestor of the Qajar monarchs, Shah Qoli Khan of the Quvanlu of Ganja, married into the Quvanlu Qajars of Astarabad. His son, Fath Ali Khan (born c. 1685–1693) was a renowned military commander during the rule of the Safavid shahs Sultan Husayn and Tahmasp II. He was killed in 1726. Fath Ali Khan's son Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar (1722–1758) was the father of Mohammad Khan Qajar and Hossein Qoli Khan (Jahansouz Shah), father of \"Baba Khan,\" the future Fath-Ali Shah Qajar. Mohammad Hasan Khan was killed on the orders of Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty.\nList of Qajar monarchs\n(1896-1907), the first constitutional monarch of Iran]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:69%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | No.\n! width=\"5%\" | Shah\n! width=\"80px\" | Portrait\n! width=\"10%\" | Reigned from\n! width=\"10%\" | Reigned until\n! width=\"10px\" | Tughra\n|-\n| colspan=9 style=\"background:#B9B9B9\" |\n|-\n| 1\n| Mohammad Khan Qajar\n|\n| 1789\n| 17 June 1797\n|\n|-\n| 2\n| Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar\n|\n| 17 June 1797\n| 23 October 1834\n|\n|-\n| 3\n| Mohammad Shah Qajar\n|\n| 23 October 1834\n| 5 September 1848\n|\n|-\n| 4\n| Naser al-Din Shah Qajar\n|\n| 5 September 1848\n| 1 May 1896\n|\n|-\n| 5\n| Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar\n|\n| 1 May 1896\n| 3 January 1907\n|\n|-\n| 6\n| Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar\n|\n| 3 January 1907\n| 16 July 1909\n|\n|-\n| 7\n| Ahmad Shah Qajar\n|\n| 16 July 1909\n| 31 October 1925\n|\n|}\nQajar imperial family\n, heir presumptive and head of the Qajar dynasty from 1975 till 1988]]\nThe Qajar Imperial Family in exile is currently headed by the eldest descendant of Mohammad Ali Shah, Sultan Mohammad Ali Mirza Qajar, while the Heir Presumptive to the Qajar throne is Mohammad Hassan Mirza II, the grandson of Mohammad Hassan Mirza, Sultan Ahmad Shah's brother and heir. Mohammad Hassan Mirza died in England in 1943, having proclaimed himself shah in exile in 1930 after the death of his brother in France.\nToday, the descendants of the Qajars often identify themselves as such and hold reunions to stay socially acquainted through the Kadjar (Qajar) Family Association, often coinciding with the annual conferences and meetings of the\nInternational Qajar Studies Association (IQSA). The Kadjar (Qajar) Family Association was founded for a third time in 2000. Two earlier family associations were stopped because of political pressure. The offices and archives of IQSA are housed at the International Museum for Family History in Eijsden.\nQajar dynasty since 1925\n; Heads of the Qajar Imperial Family\nThe headship of the Imperial Family is inherited by the eldest male descendant of Mohammad Ali Shah.\n* Sultan Ahmad Shah Qajar (1925–1930)\n* Fereydoun Mirza (1930–1975)\n* Sultan Hamid Mirza (1975–1988)\n* Sultan Mahmoud Mirza (1988)\n* Sultan Ali Mirza Qajar (1988–2011)\n* Sultan Mohammad Ali Mirza (2011–present)\n; Heirs Presumptive of the Qajar dynasty\nThe Heir Presumptive is the Qajar heir to the Persian throne.\n* Sultan Ahmad Shah Qajar (1925–1930)\n* Mohammad Hassan Mirza (1930–1943)\n* Fereydoun Mirza (1943–1975)\n* Sultan Hamid Mirza (1975–1988)\n* Mohammad Hassan Mirza II (1988–)\nExtended Family\n*Qajar descendants of Jwamer Agha, Princesses of Qajar, great-great or great-great-great grandchildren of Naseruddin Shah Qajar.\nTitles and styles\n, the fourth Qajar shah, notably used the title \"Pivot of the Universe\" (Qebleh-ye Alam)]]\nThe shah and his consort were styled Imperial Majesty. Their children were addressed as Imperial Highness, while male-line grandchildren were entitled to the lower style of Highness; all of them bore the title of Shahzadeh or Shahzadeh Khanoum.\nThe Qajar Shahs also adopted grandiose titles that reflected their perceived divine authority and centrality in the Persian monarchy.
