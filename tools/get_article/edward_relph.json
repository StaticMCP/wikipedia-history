He is an emeritus professor of the University of Toronto, where he served from 1991 to 1999 as Chair of the Division of Social Sciences at the  Scarborough campus. From 1999 to 2005 Relph was Associate Principal responsible for the expansion and redevelopment of that campus, and served again as Chair of Social Sciences from 2008 to 2010.\nRelph now lives in Victoria, British Columbia.\nRelph has written many academic articles and book chapters that investigate the phenomenological and experiential foundations of geography, and others that elaborate sense of place and the ways experiences of place are currently being transformed. Place and Placelessness was reassessed and updated at a conference organized by Rob Freestone and Edgar Liu of the University of New South Wales that resulted in the publication of Place and Placelessness Revisited (edited by Freestone and Liu) in 2016.\nPublications\n*Place and Placelessness, first published in 1976 and reissued in 2010, is a phenomenological account of how places are experienced and how they are changing. It was one of the first books that explicitly examined the idea of place, and also one of the first phenomenological studies in geography. It has been widely cited and has been described as a Classic in Human Geography in both Progress in Human Geography, Vol 24, No 4, 2000, and Classics in Human Geography, ed. P. Hubbard, R. Kitchen, & G. Vallentine, Sage, 2008.  It has been translated into several languages including Japanese, Korean and Chinese.\n*Rational Landscapes and Humanistic Geography, published in 1981, explores why modern built environments provide material comfort and efficiency yet breed criticism and despair rather than hope and commitment. It was reissued as a [https://www.routledge.com/geography/posts/7592/ Routledge Revival] in 2015.\n*The Modern Urban Landscape, published in 1987, examines why urban landscapes built since about 1900 look as they do by tracing changes in planning and architecture through the rise of modernism to post-modernism and the corporatization of cities. It has been reprinted several times and translated into Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese.
