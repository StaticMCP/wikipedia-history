In 1984, it merged with the anti-communist 2nd Brigade of the Shan State Army to form the Tai Revolutionary Council (TRC) when the 2nd Brigade headquarters was overrun by Khun Sa's Shan United Army (SUA).\nIn early 1985 its headquarters at Piang Luang came under pressure from the SUA as the latter sought to consolidate control over the border area. The TRC then ended its relationship the KMT, and allied itself with the SUA, to create the Mong Tai Army with its base of operations in Homong. In 1996 most of its soldiers disarmed, but a group of 800 soldiers were integrated into the newly formed Shan State Army – South by Yawd Serk.\nFurther reading\n* Trevor Wilson (ed.)
