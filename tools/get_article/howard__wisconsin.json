The population was 19,950 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Green Bay metropolitan area.\nThe village is mostly within Brown County; a small portion extends west into Outagamie County. It is bordered to the east by Green Bay, a sub-basin of Lake Michigan. Prior to being incorporated as the Village of Howard, the Town of Howard was commonly referred to as \"Duck Creek\" because of the Duck Creek waterway winding its way through the village.\nHistory\nThe Green Bay area was first explored by Europeans in 1634, when Jean Nicolet, a French voyager, arrived in the area. The Town of Howard was established in 1835 and slowly developed along Duck Creek as a center for mail delivery, farming, quarrying and lumbering. By 1848, there were three major railroads that convergen in Howard, the Chicago & North Western (C&NW), the SOO Line (SOO) And the Milwaukee Road (MILW). It was named for Brigadier General Benjamin Howard, an officer in the War of 1812.\nBy 1856, a school was operating and the Town of Howard became known for its Duck Creek stone quarries; of which there were four. The last of the quarries were shut down in 2002.\nBy 1959, the population had grown and the Town of Howard became incorporated as the Village of Howard. Residential, commercial and industrial growth has continued steadily since that time, creating a suburban community on Green Bay's northwest side. Today the only railroads that reach Green Bay are the Escanaba & Lake Superior (E&LS) and the Canadian National (CN). Two of the four original railroad yards have been removed or abandoned. The Fox River Valley (FRVR) Railroad yard, formerly the Green Bay & Western (GB&W), has been turned into a park and apartments. The Milwaukee Road (MILW) yard has had its tracks removed, but is still owned by Canadian National. It is planned to be converted to apartments. There are several different parks in Howard, that are open to the public. The Duck Creek Quarry Park is open to the public all year round. There are several nature parks open to recreation and sporting events; all but one are open year round.\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which,  of it is land and  is water.\nClimate\n{|\n|-\n|\n}}\n|}\nDemographics\n}}\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 17,399 people, 6,941 households, and 4,763 families living in the village.
