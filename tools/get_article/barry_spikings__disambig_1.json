Spikings is best known as a producer of the film The Deer Hunter (1978), which won five Academy Awards.\nBiography\nSpikings was born in Boston, Lincolnshire. After leaving Boston Grammar School he joined the local newspaper, the Lincolnshire Standard, as a trainee reporter. Later he joined the ''Farmers' Weekly, where he won a Golden Ear award for a fifteen-minute film that he produced and directed himself.\nSpikings then moved to the entertainment world. Initially, he promoted pop music festivals and later films.\nBritish Lion and EMI\nIn 1972, he became the co-owner of British Lion Films; Spikings later joined EMI when it took over British Lion. For the film, The Deer Hunter (1978), Spikings won an Academy Award for Best Picture. The film also garnered awards for several of its actors.\nFilmink'' argued After Deeley left EMI Spikings' choice of films became more risky and less commercial, writing \"Spikings deserves all the credit in the world for trying to make intelligent pictures that raised the bar for cinema. He is under-rated as a backer of classy pictures.  But he felt ill-suited for his position.\"\nIn July 1979 Spikings argued \"if you make a good film there is no way you won't make money.\"\nHe quit EMI in January 1983 with a year laeft to work on his contract.\nNelson Holdings\nIn 1985, Spikings formed a Canadian company, Nelson Holdings International, with British financier Richard Northcott, to purchase entertainment firms.
