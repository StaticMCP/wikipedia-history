Not much is known about the Upemba culture however it is believed to have existed during the fifth century BC and were eventually absorbed into the culture and traditions of the Luba people and some other peoples settling around the depression.\nThere is some suggestive evidence that they interacted with other nearby cultures and even traded with them evidenced by the discovery of iron and various other metals being used in their tools and weapons. Houses and shelters completely crafted out of wooden stilts have also been found around the Upemba depression to protect the foundation from the murky swamps that lay under them.\nOther than metals and possibly wood, they also traded palm oil and salt to other peoples and tribes in return for spices and other precious commodities and are believe to have their trade route as far as the Indian Ocean.\n[Work In Progress]\nReferences"
