It was designed by Emerson & Fehmer of Boston, and built in 1870 for M. H. Sanford as a summer residence.  Its interior, in marked contrast to its exterior, is lavishly decorated with woodwork and stencilwork.\nOwnership by William King Covell II and his descendants\nWilliam King Covell II bought the house in 1896 and it has remained in his family until this day. It is currently owned by Anne Ramsey Cuvelier, the great granddaughter of William King Covell II, who uses it for a bed and breakfast business.\nLizzie Borden as a houseguest\nat the house in 1893|alt=Black-and-white head and shoulders photograph of a woman looking at the camera]]\nLizzie Borden, a family friend who stood trial for murder, stayed with the Covell family after her acquittal in the summer of 1893. She stayed at the winter home of the Covell family on Farewell Street where the famous photo of her on the porch was taken.  It is assumed that she also spent some time at 72 Washington Street.\nNational Register of Historic Places\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Newport County, Rhode Island\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*[http://www.sanford-covell.com Web site]"
