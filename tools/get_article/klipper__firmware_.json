The separation claims to allow for more advanced control compared to traditional firmware that runs solely on the printer's microcontroller. Klipper supports multiple types of kinematics, including Cartesian, CoreXY and delta robot.\nHistory\nKlipper was developed by Kevin O'Connor in 2014. One of the early adopters was the Voron project which built CoreXY printers with open-source software and open-source hardware. Klipper's popularity has gradually increased over time, and in 2024 it came pre-installed on 3D printers from several manufacturers.\nIn 2022, Klipper entered into a strategic partnership with BigTreeTech, a manufacturer of motherboards for 3D printers.\n) by Klipper in 2020]]\nIn late 2020, Klipper introduced input shaping into the world of open-source 3D printing firmware.\nFeatures\nAs the host computer has more processing power and is capable of doing more intensive calculations, only the results of these calculations need to be sent to the microcontroller. This enables more precise control of stepper motors, advanced kinematics, input shaping for vibration reduction, detailed logging, use of macros, and changing configurations in real-time without the need to restart the firmware.\nThe printer also has pressure advance, which is a parameter that compensates for the pressure build-up in the nozzle during acceleration for smoother and more precise printing. It works by making the extrusion advance faster during strong accelerations, and advance slower during strong decelerations. This way, smoother lines can be achieved at high 3D printing speeds. The compensation is usually calibrated per material type (PLA, ABS, PETG, and so on), but can even be calibrated for each specific spool. The model takes into account the elasticity, viscosity, pressure and flow of the filament.\nSupported hardware\nKlipper supports several types of 3D printers and microcontrollers, including boards from Arduino and STM32. It is compatible with many existing printers, and can be adapted to custom-built machines.\nInstallation, configuration and interaction\nKlipper is set up on a computer running Linux (such as Raspberry Pi), and in addition, appropriate firmware must be flashed onto the printer's microcontroller. Configuration is done through a text-based configuration file, which allows for customization and control of the printer's behavior.\nTo interact with Klipper, the user needs an interface. Two popular web interfaces are Mainsail OS and Fluidd. Other options are OctoPrint or KlipperScreen.\nDevelopment and society\nKlipper is maintained and developed by an active community of users and developers. The project is hosted on GitHub, where users can contribute code, report bugs, and read extensive documentation. There is also a dedicated [https://community.klipper3d.org/ forum], an [https://www.reddit.com/r/klippers/ r/klippers] channel on Reddit, and a [https://discord.klipper3d.org/ chat] on Discord where users can get guidance with more common questions and problems.\nSee also\n* Marlin (firmware), another open source firmware for 3D printers\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html Installation guide - klipper3d.org]\n*"
