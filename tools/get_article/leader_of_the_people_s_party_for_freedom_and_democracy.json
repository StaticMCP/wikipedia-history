The post is currently held by Dilan Yeşilgöz-Zegerius, who succeeded Mark Rutte in 2023.\nHistory\nThe Leaders outwardly act as the 'figurehead' and the main representative of the party. Within the party, they must ensure political consensus. At election time the leader is always the lead candidate of the VVD  party list. Outside election time the leader can serve as the opposition leader. In the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy the Leader is often the parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives. If the VVD is part of the government, the leader usually becomes a senior minister in the cabinet.\nLeaders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=2 | Leader\n!
