The award is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. The Slovak submission is decided annually by the Slovak Film and Television Academy (Slovenská filmová a televízna akadémia).\nAs of 2025, Slovakia has submitted twenty-nine films, but none of them were nominated.\nUntil 1993, the Slovakia was a constituent republic within Czechoslovakia, and Czech and Slovaks routinely collaborated on national productions. The Shop on Main Street, which won the category in 1966 was a Slovak-language production and was also the first Czechoslovak film ever to be nominated for an Oscar.\nSubmissions\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award.\nSeven of the submitted films were directed by Martin Šulík, the most between any directors.\nIn 2008 the producers of Bathory protested the decision of the Slovak Academy not to consider their film, the most expensive in Slovak history, for an Oscar nomination. The Slovak Academy said the multi-national production, which was filmed in Slovak- and English-language versions, did not qualify as a majority-Slovak production, in part because none of the lead cast came from Slovakia. The Academy instead chose documentary Blind Loves from a shortlist of four films.\nMost films were at least partially in Slovak, although All My Loved Ones was primarily in Czech and Return of the Storks and King of Thieves had much of their dialogue in German.\nBelow is a list of the films that have been submitted by the Slovak Republic for review by the Academy for the award by the year of the submission and the respective Academy Award ceremony.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"\n|-\n!
