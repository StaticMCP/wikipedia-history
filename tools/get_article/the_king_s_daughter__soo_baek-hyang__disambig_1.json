It was aired on MBC TV from September 30, 2013, to March 14, 2014, on Monday and Friday at 20:55 (KST).

He is in love with Chae-hwa, the daughter of a court official named Baek-ga. Baek-ga is committed to bringing Yung to the throne, with his daughter as the queen. When he is accused of the king's murder, the two lovers are forced apart. Chae-hwa is taken to Gaya by a servant, Goo-chun, and there she gives birth to Yung's daughter, Seol-nan. She subsequently marries the man who had saved her and, some years later, gives birth to a second child, Seol-hee. In the meantime, Yung, who believes that his lover is dead, ascends the throne as Muryeong. In an attempt to protect Jin-moo, the son of the former King Dongseong, Yung exchanges his own son, Myung-nong, for Jin-moo. Years later, simple-minded Seol-nan falls in love with Myung-nong, while her ambitious sister Seol-hee tries to become the princess.\nCast\nMain cast\n*Seo Hyun-jin as Soo Baek-hyang / Seol-nan\n*Seo Woo as Seol-hee\n*Lee Jae-ryong as King Muryeong\n*Jo Hyun-jae as Myung-nong, later King Seong\n**Jeon Jin-seo as teenage Myung-nong\n**Seol Woo-hyung as child Myung-nong\n*Jun Tae-soo as Jin-moo\n*Myung Se-bin as Chae-hwa\n*Yoon Tae-young as Goo-chun\nSupporting\nBi Moon\n*Cha Hwa-yeon as Do-rim\n*Kim Roi-ha as Ttol-dae\n*Kim Min-kyo as Mang-goo\n*Sung Ji-ru as Dae-woon\nRoyal palace\n*Jung Sung-mo as Nae-sook\n*Im Se-mi as Queen Eun-hye\n*Hwang Young-hee as Gong-ok\n*Jung Suk-yong as Hong-rim\n*Lee Ki-young as King Gaero\n*Jung Chan as King Dongseong\nExtended\n*Ahn Suk-hwan as Baek-ga\n*Kim Young-jae as Soo Ni-moon\n*Yeo Eui-joo as Kang-bok\n*Choi Bum-ho as Yeo-mok\n*Lee Hye-eun as Lady So-jung\n*Kim Byeong-ok as Yeon Bool-tae\n*Jeon Shin-hwan as Woo-chi\n*Jang Myung-gap as Moo-baek\n*Lee Dong-yoon as Yong-goo\n*Choi Joon-hyuk as Kko-mak\n*Lee Choong-shik as Duk-swe\n*Lee Chang-jik as Choi Man-chi\n*Seo Yi-sook as Mrs. Yong-goo\n*Ga Deuk-hee as Na-eun\n*Park Hee-jin as Mrs. Kko-mak / Inn auntie\n*Woo Sang-jun as Sangjwapyeong elderly\n*Song Min-hyung as Eun-sol\n*Lee Mi-do as Mak-geum\n*Jung Ui-kap as Eul-mil\n*Moo Jin-sung as Kang Bok\n*Hong Yeo-jin as Gaya Ki Moon Bureau noble's wife\n*Seo Kwang-jae as Gaya Ki Moon Bureau noble\n*Choi Ro-woon as orphaned boy\n*Kwon Sung-guk as Baekje doctor\n*Lee Jae-goo as Ki Moon Administration official\n*Lee Seung-won as butler\n*Ki Se-hyung as Moo-man\n*Min Joon-hyun as Uk-chool\n*Oh Dae-hwan as Doo-mok\n* Park Sung-joon\n* Jung Man-sik\nOriginal soundtrack\nOST Part 1\nOST Part 2\n)\n|note1=\n|length1= 4:34\n|writer1=\n|extra1= Seo Hyun-jin feat.
