It is one of the oldest boat clubs in the world, having been founded in 1827. They also represent Wycliffe Hall.\nHistory\nIn 1837, the club represented Oxford in a race against Lady Margaret Boat Club, representing Cambridge, and won. This event, held on the River Thames at Henley-on-Thames, is credited with leading to support from the town for the establishment of the Henley Royal Regatta.\nThe club was last Head of the River in Eights in 1957 and in Torpids in 1958.\nA women's boat first competed in 1981 after admission of women to the college. It has since risen to as high as 2nd on the river during the 2006 Torpids competition and 10th on the river during Summer Eights 2005.\nIn recent years the men's first and second boats have risen steadily through the rankings of Summer Eights with the first eight now positioned at 16th on the river and second eight at 52nd as of 2023. Notably, both boats achieved 'blades' (bumping on each day of the competition) in both the 2015 and 2017 regattas.\nThe Women's first boat recently achieved 'blades' in Torpids 2023, breaking the QCBC women's record by rising 6 places in a single bumps campaign. Their success was followed by achieving 'blades' a second time in their Summer VIIIs campaign. Once again breaking another record by securing double blades in a year, a first for the women’s side in the boat club’s history.\nSee also\n*Torpids\n*Summer Eights\nReferences\n*\nExternal links\n*"
