He was educated at Goodwater rural school in Sully County and graduated from Pierre High School in 1939. After receiving a Bachelor of Arts from the University of South Dakota, Warne reported to an officer candidate school in Fort Knox, Kentucky, and served nearly 4 years as a platoon leader and company commander. During the European theatre of World War II, he served in both the 2nd Armored Division as a first lieutenant and the 20th Armored Division. Warne received a Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart for his service. After his return to the United States in 1945, he married nurse Helen Williams. Together, they had four children, only two of which survived past infancy: Randy and Nancy.\nPolitical career\nAfter Warne was discharged from the military, he served on the board of the Goodwater School for 22 years and as a Sully County commissioner for 21 years. On February 14, 1952, he announced his campaign for the South Dakota Senate, seeking the Republican Party nomination for the 16th district. The announcement came the day after the incumbent senator, Fred R. Winans, stated that he would not seek re-election. Warne officially filed for election on May 1, defeating fellow Republicans Arthur B. Cahalan of Miller and G. C. Reynolds of Blunt in the primary election. Because there was no Democratic Party opponent in the general election, Warne won unopposed by default. He comfortably won a re-election bid in 1954, defeating his Democratic opponent, Nick Jackus, by nearly 19 points. As senator, Warne was the chairman of Military and Veterans' Affairs. In 1955, he proposed a constitutional amendment that would have reduced the state's voting age to 18.\nWarne ran for the South Dakota House of Representatives in 1956, seeking to represent its 22nd district. In a close race, he defeated the incumbent, Democrat J. C. Noonan, by 12 votes. Noonan petitioned for a recount, which showed him leading Warne by 6 votes, which was contested and brought to the South Dakota Supreme Court by Warne, who requested that they review the challenged or thrown-out ballots. A writ of certiorari was filed at the Supreme Court on December 8, and the case hearing was scheduled for December 17. The court ended up rigorously examining 93 ballots, ruling that Warne had won the race, albeit with a very tight margin of just 3 votes. As representative, Warne introduced a bill that would have broadened the state's sales tax base to include hotels and motels. He was a delegate to the 1956 Republican National Convention.\nElectoral history\n}}\n}}\nRanching career and later life\nIn 1957, Warne began breeding Appaloosa horses on his ranch as a hobby.

In 1961, Warne served as co-chair of the 45-member University of South Dakota Development Commission. In 1972, Warne was appointed by Earl Butz, the United States secretary of agriculture, to serve on the 19-member Water Bank Advisory Board.\nIn 1973, Warne's ranch won the South Dakota State Izaak Walton League Award for outstanding wildlife habitat management.
