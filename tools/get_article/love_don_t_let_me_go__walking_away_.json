The mash-up was first performed live by French DJ and Guetta's production partner Joachim Garraud, though several people claimed to have done it before. It was featured in an advert for the Citroën C4, and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, Guetta's first top ten hit in that country. It was released as the single of Guetta's 2006 compilation album ''Fuck Me I'm Famous - Ibiza Mix 06 and also features on the 2007 Reissue Edition of Guetta Blaster'' and as the bonus track of Guetta's third studio album Pop Life.\nMusic video\nThe music video, shot at Heygate Estate in South London, is choreographed around breakdancing and parkour with a comedic aspect. The clip starts with two boys playing basketball while two girls walk past. One of each of the two notice each other and are obviously infatuated. They walk up to the cage between them and when their hands touch they begin to dance intensely. They continue to dance energetically and spontaneously until they touched someone else, at which time the \"energy\" would transfer to them and that person would start to dance while the person who touched them stopped. The boy and the girl kiss at the end of the video.\nTrack listing\n# \"Love Don't Let Me Go (Walking Away)\" (UK radio edit) – 3:13\n# \"Love Don't Let Me Go (Walking Away)\" (Famous radio edit) – 3:08\n# \"Love Don't Let Me Go (Walking Away)\" (Joachim Garraud & David Guetta's F*** Me I'm Famous Mix) – 6:23\n# \"Walking Away\" (Tocadisco Remix) – 6:53\n12\" single track listing\n# \"Love Don't Let Me Go (Walking Away)\" (Joachim Garraud & David Guetta's F*** Me I'm Famous Mix) – 6:23\n# \"Love Don't Let Me Go\" (Joe T.
