It is the successor to the John Player Portrait Award. It is the most important portrait prize in the world, and is reputedly one of the most prestigious competitions in contemporary art. Starting in 2024, the National Portrait Gallery's portrait competition resumed under the new sponsorship of international law firm Herbert Smith Freehills.\nHistory\nBritish Petroleum took over sponsorship of the competition in 1989 from John Player & Sons, a tobacco company which had sponsored it from its inception in 1980, and has sponsored it since. The presence of both sponsors has triggered protests, with the group Art Not Oil (part of the international Rising Tide network) being responsible for most of those against BP.  In 2016, The Museums Association conducted a formal investigation into BP's sponsorship when Art Not Oil alleged that the company influenced curatorial decisions and used its association with the National Gallery to further its political interests both domestic and international.\nThe exhibition opens in June each year and runs until September. First prize is typically £30,000. In the early years of the century, the prize went up from £5,000, and its catchment area was gradually extended from residents of the UK and is now unrestricted. Until 2006, the competition has been open to under-40s only. Since 2007, it is open to anyone over the age of 18 and a separate BP Young Artist Award is granted to the best portrait artist between 18 and 30.\nIn 1993, Tom Hallifax was used to advertise the awards.\n, 2009]]\nIn 2009, Dan Llywelyn Hall's portrait of the last living Tommy, Harry Patch widely used for advertising. Patch died during the run of the exhibition.\nIn 2012 the competition received 2,187 entries from 74 countries (including 1,500 from the UK) of which 55 paintings were selected to be exhibited.\nWinners\nJohn Player Portrait Award\n*1980\n*1981\n*1982 – Humphrey Ocean\n*1983 – Michael R.
