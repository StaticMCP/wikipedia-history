These sharia-compliant financial products are not offered by main financial institutions and, thus, small financial companies are major players. However, major companies like WealthSimple are starting to embrace the idea.A growing number of Canadian fintech firms now offer Shariah-compliant home-financing models based on co-ownership (diminishing partnership) rather than conventional interest-bearing mortgages.\nIslamic Mortgage\nHistory\nA Toronto-based financial company UM Financial started giving Sharia-compliant loans to Muslims in 2005 in partnership with Central 1 Credit Union of Vancouver. The company planned to offer no-interest MasterCard as well. UM financial was ordered to go into receivership by the Ontario Superior Court on October 7, 2011. Omar Kalair and Yusuf Panchbaya of UM Financial were charged by RCMP for $4.3-million mortgage fraud, but both men were acquitted of all counts contained in the indictment in Ontario Superior Court June 7, 2019.\nIslamic Mortgage in the main stream\nThe 2024 federal budget announced on April 16 included plans to bring halal mortgages into financial regulatory system.\nIslamic financial products\nMortgage products\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Comparison of Islamic Mortgage Products\n!Company\n!Islamic model\n!Year of Inception\n!Funder\n!Funding from Banks/ Credit Unions\n!Serving province\n!Sharia Standards\n!Sharia Certification\n!External Review\n!Website\n|-\n|IjaraCDC Canada\n|Ijarah-wa-Iqtina\n|2008\n|\n|Yes\n|\n|\n|\n|AMJA  Ebrahim Desai\n|[https://ijaracdc.com/islamic-finance-canada/]\n|-\n|Aya Financial\n|Diminishing\nMusharakah\n|\n|\n|Yes\n|Ontario\n|\n|\n|Ebrahim Desai\n|[https://ayafinancial.com/]\n|-\n|Zero Mortgage\n|Diminishing\nMusharakah\n|\n|\n|Yes\n|\n|\n|\n|Ebrahim Desai\n|[https://www.zeromortgage.ca/]\n|-\n|Manzil\n|Murabaha\n|2019\n|Manzil Mortgage Fund\n|No\n|Ontario\n|AAOIFI (disputed )\n|\n|Ebrahim Desai\n|[https://manzil.ca/halal-mortgage/murabaha]\n|-\n|Manzil\n|DiminishingMusharakah\n|2019\n|Manzil Mortgage Fund\n|No\n|\n|AAOIFI\n|\n|Ebrahim Desai\n|[https://manzil.ca/halal-mortgage/musharaka]\n|-\n|Eqraz\n|Murabaha\n|2022\n|\n|\n|\nAlberta\nBritish Columbia\nManitoba\nNew Brunswick\nNewfoundland and Labrador\nNova Scotia\nOntario\nPrince Edward Island\nQuebec\nSaskatchewan\n|AAOIFI (disputed )\n|\n|Fatwa.ca\n|[https://eqraz.com/]\n|-\n|Canadian Halal Finance Corporation\n|Murabaha\nDiminishing\nMusharakah\n|2021\n|\n|\n|Alberta\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://www.halalfinancialcorp.com/]\n|-\n|Halal Homes\n|Murabaha\nDiminishing\nMusharakah\n|\n|\n|\n|Alberta\n|\n|\n|\n|[http://halalhomes.ca/]\n|-\n|Murabaha Homes\n|Murabaha\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://www.murabahahomes.com/]\n|-\n|An-Nur Co-operative\n|\n|\n|Co-operative\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://www.nurcoop.com/]\n|-\n|Ansar Co-operative\n|Diminishing\nMusharakah\n|1980\n|Co-operative\n|\n|Ontario\n|\n|\n|Ebrahim Desai\n|[http://www.ansarhousing.com/home_buyers_overview.aspx]\n|-\n|Interest-Free Housing (Formerly ISNA Housing)\n|\n|2008\n|Co-operative\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|[http://interestfreehousing.ca/]\n|-\n|Al Ehsaan Housing\n|Diminishing\nMusharakah\n|2007\n|Co-operative\n|\n|Saskatchewan\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://alehsaanhousing.ca/]\n|-\n|Qurtuba Housing Coop\n|Diminishing\nMusharakah\n|1990\n|Co-operative\n|\n|Quebec\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://qurtuba.ca/]\n|-\n|Assiniboine Credit Union\n|Diminishing\nMusharakah\n|\n|Credit Union\n|Yes\n|Manitoba\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://www.acu.ca/en/personal/mortgages/specialty-mortgages]\n|}\nInvestment products\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Comparison of Investment Products\n!Product\n!Type\n!First year of offering\n!Company\n!Available through\n!MER\n!Sharia Certification\n!Website\n|-\n|Wealthsimple Shariah World Equity Index ETF (WSHR)\n|Exchange-traded fund (ETF)\n|2020\n|WealthSimple\n|\n|gold ETF 0.18%, equity ETF 0.5%\n|Ratings Intelligence\n|[https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/quote/NEO/WSHR]\n|-\n|Wahed FTSE USA Shariah ETF (HLAL)\n|Exchange-traded fund (ETF)\n|2019\n|Wahed Invest\n|\n|0.5%\n|\n|[https://funds.wahedinvest.com/]\n|-\n|The SP Funds S&P 500 Sharia Industry Exclusions ETF (SPUS)\n|Exchange-traded fund (ETF)\n|2019\n|SP Funds\n|\n|0.49%\n|\n|[https://www.sp-funds.com/spus/]\n|-\n|SP Funds Dow Jones Global Sukuk ETF (SPSK)\n|Exchange-traded fund (ETF)\n|\n|SP Funds\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://www.sp-funds.com/spsk/]\n|-\n|The SP Funds S&P Global REIT Sharia ETF (SPRE)\n|Exchange-traded fund (ETF)\n|\n|SP Funds\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://www.sp-funds.com/spre/]\n|-\n|Global Iman Fund (IMANX)\n|Mutual Fund\n|2008\n|Global Growth Assets\n|\n|\n|\n|[https://globalgrowth.ca/Products.html]\n|-\n|Manzil Mortgage Fund (MANZL)\n|Mortgage Fund\n|2019\n|Manzil\n|Manzil/ CI Direct\n|1.5%\n|\n|[https://manzil.ca/halal-money]\n|-\n|Sukak -
