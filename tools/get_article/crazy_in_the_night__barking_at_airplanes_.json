Written by Carnes, and co-produced with Bill Cuomo, the track was inspired by her eldest son's struggles with nightmares and fear of the dark as a child. It was released as a single in April 1985 by EMI America.\nThe song became one of Carnes' highest-charting singles, peaking at no. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reaching the top 40 in various countries.\nLyrics and composition\nCarnes was inspired to write \"Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes)\" due to her son Collin's fear of the dark as a child. She incorporated the album's title, Barking at Airplanes, into the song title as a parenthesis. \"I had a golden retriever [..] Every time the airplanes would go over, she’d bark at the airplanes. I thought, that’s such a cool, crazy title for an album.\"\nWriting for the GRAMMY Awards website, Crystal Larsen likened \"Crazy in the Night\" to the work of American songwriter and producer Jim Steinman.\nTrack listings\n* 7-inch single\n: A. \"Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes)\" – 3:35\n: B. \"Oliver (Voice on the Radio)\" – 3:46\n* 12-inch single\n: A. \"Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes)\" (dance mix) – 5:10\n: B. \"Barking at Airplanes (Part II)\" (dub mix) – 4:59\nCredits and personnel\n* Bill Cuomo – co-producer, synthesizers\n* Craig Hull – background vocals\n* Craig Krampf – drum programming, background vocals\n* Daniel Moore – background vocals\n* Dave Ellingson – background vocals\n* David Egerton – second engineer\n* Denny Densmore – second engineer\n* Duane Seykora – additional second engineer\n* Eric Blum – back cover photography\n* George Marino – mastering at Sterling Sound (New York)\n* Greg Gorman – cover photography\n* Henry Marquez – art direction\n* Judy Clapp – second engineer\n* Kim Carnes – lead vocals, background vocals, co-producer\n* Mark Ettel – recording engineer\n* Matthew Rolston – inner sleeve photography\n* Michael Brokaw (Kragen & Co.) – direction\n* Mike Shipley – mixer\n* Niko Bolas – additional engineer\n* Richard Bosworth – additional second engineer\n* Sabrina Bucharek – second engineer\n* Steve MacMillan – second engineer\n* Sue McGonigle – project coordinator\n* Tony Chiappa – second engineer\n* Vigon Seireeni – design\n* Waddy Wachtel – electric guitar, background vocals\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1985)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia (Kent Music Report)\n| 21\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| South Africa (Springbok Radio)\n| 3\n|-\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Cash Box Top 100\n| 22\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Quebec (ADISQ)\n| 37\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
