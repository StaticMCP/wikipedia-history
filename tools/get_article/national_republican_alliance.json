It is sometimes considered an offshoot of the older FLN. The ANR is strongly anti-Islamist, and denounced the 1995 Sant'Egidio accords, while later backing the referendum on national reconciliation. It received 208,379 votes in the elections of June 1997, but boycotted the 2002 elections, claiming they would be rigged.\n2007 elections\nIn the May, 2007 elections, the ANR received 126,444 votes, or 2.21%. This gave them 4 seats in parliament.\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! Name !!
