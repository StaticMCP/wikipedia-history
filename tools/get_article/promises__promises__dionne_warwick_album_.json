Like many of her previous albums, it was produced by the songwriting team of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The album includes three songs from the musical Promises, Promises, for which Bacharach and David wrote the music and lyrics, and which would premiere a month after the album was released: the title song, \"Whoever You Are (I Love You)\" and \"Wanting Things\". The album also includes two other Bacharach/David compositions, \"This Girl's in Love with You\" (which had originally been recorded by Herb Alpert as \"This Guy's in Love with You\" earlier that year) and \"Who Is Gonna Love Me\".\nThe album includes songs from two other musicals of the time: \"Where Is Love?\" from Oliver!, and \"Where Am I Going?\" from Sweet Charity.\nThe title track peaked at number 19 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 the week of December 7, 1968 and No. 7 Easy Listening during the late fall of 1968. \"This Girl's in Love with You,\" the follow-up single, reached number seven in February 1969.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Dionne Warwick - vocals\n*Burt Bacharach, Don Sebesky, Peter Matz - arrangements\n*Phil Ramone - audio engineer\n*Burt Goldblatt - art direction, cover design\n*Michael Freeman - front cover photography\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Weekly chart performance for Promises, Promises\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1969)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Canada Top 50 Albums (RPM)\n| 15\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top LP's (Billboard)\n| 18\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Best Selling R&B LP's (Billboard)\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top 100 Albums (Cash Box)\n| 19\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Top 100 LP's (Record World)\n| 15\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Year-end chart performance for Promises, Promises\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1969)\n! scope=\"col\"| Position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top LP's (Billboard)\n| 32\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Best Selling R&B LP's (Billboard)\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| US Top 100 Albums (Cash Box)\n| 64\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
