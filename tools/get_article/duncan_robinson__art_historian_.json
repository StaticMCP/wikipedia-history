He was an only child. He was educated at The King's School, Macclesfield; Clare College, Cambridge; and Yale University.\nAcademic career\nRobinson was a leading authority on British art from the eighteenth century onwards. He began his career as an assistant keeper in the Department of Paintings and Drawings at Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, between 1970 and 1976. In 1976, he was appointed Keeper of Paintings and Drawings. From 1975 to 1981, he was additionally a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge and a college lecturer.\nFrom 1981 to 1995, Robinson was Director of the Yale Center for British Art and an adjunct professor of art history at Yale University.

In 2005 he was appointed a deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.  Unusually for a head of house, he remained the director of studies for both of 'his' colleges: Magdalene and Clare.
