Awarded annually to a scholar by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), it is the highest honor in the field of heat transfer these professional organizations bestow.\nThe award was established in 1961 by the American Society of Mechanical Engineering Heat Transfer Division in honor of Max Jakob, a pioneer in the science of heat transfer, commemorating his influential contributions as a research worker, educator, and author. In 1962, the AIChE joined the ASME in presenting the award. It is administered though the Max Jakob Memorial Award Committee, a board composed of three members from each of the two major professional organizations, as well as the Past Chair of the committee.\nThe award is presented annually, without regard to society affiliation or nationality. It consists of a bronze plaque, an engraved certificate, an honorarium, and travel expenses to accept the award. Each year the recipient also presents the Max Jakob Award Lecture as part of the annual America Society of Mechanical Engineering National Heat Transfer Conference.\nRecipients\n* 2024 Walter Grassi, Italy\n* 2022 G.P. “Bud” Peterson, United States\n* 2021 Michael Modest, United States\n* 2020 Peter Wayner Jr., United States\n* 2019 Arun Majumdar, United States\n* 2018 John W.
