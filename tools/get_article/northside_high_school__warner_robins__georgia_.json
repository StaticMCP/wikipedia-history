Located at 926 Green Street on the northern side of Warner Robins, it was built in 1963 and enrolls approximately 1827 students. It is a part of Houston County Schools.\nNorthside's mascot is the eagle. Its official colors are blue and white, though orange is also commonly used.\nHistory\nNorthside High School originally opened in 1963 as the second high school to be built in Warner Robins, after Warner Robins High School.\nCampus\nMany cosmetic changes were implemented starting in 2001. At the end of the 2004-2005 school year, the school began renovation projects to increase the size of the school. Northside was last renovated during 2005 and 2006. This most recent renovation included a new commons area, an expanded lobby, a bigger cafeteria which connects the Vocational Building with the main building, an expansion of the Technology lab and the band room, and a new gymnasium. Construction ended during the 2006-2007 school year.\nTabor Academy\nIn 2004, Tabor Middle School became Tabor Academy at Northside, a 9th grade-only school which introduces 9th grade students to the high school atmosphere.\nExtracurricular activities\nAthletics\nThe school sponsored athletic teams are football, cross country, volleyball, softball, cheerleading (competition, football, and basketball), basketball, swimming, wrestling, soccer, baseball, track, tennis, and golf. There is a bass fishing team under the Houston County Bass Angler Federation, not associated with any state or national organization.\nIn 1998, Northside Eagle ladies' track team won state in the 100 meters.\nFootball\nHome football games for the Northside Eagles are played at McConnell-Talbert Stadium.\nThe Northside Eagles football team have had winning seasons for 22 consecutive years; they are 146-15 from 1998 to the present. Northside had 17 consecutive seasons with 10 or more wins from 1998-2014.\nFrom 1998 to 2005, the school had five teams go 10-0 in the regular season but falter in the playoffs. In 2006 and 2007, the school broke through with consecutive 15-0 finishes in Class 4-A, and won two state championships.\nIn 2009 the Eagles had wins against Lowndes (#1 in the state, #4 in the nation), Valdosta, and Newnan (#2 in the state, #10 in the nation) in the semi-finals, leading the way for the Eagles to contest for the 5A state championship in 2009, which they lost against Camden County (December 12) at the Georgia Dome (31-3).  Northside was moved back down to 4-A due to lack of enough students to remain in the 5-A classification.\nNorthside won the 5A  Georgia State Football Championship in 2014. This brought their total number of state titles to three, with three state runner-up titles.\nSince 1999, Northside has had nine semi-final appearances and six final appearances in the play-offs, making it to the second round or higher every year, except 2010.\nThe Blue Wind Band\nIn the 2011-2012 school year, the band won first place in class 3A East Georgia Marching Festival, and third place, overall band of the day.
