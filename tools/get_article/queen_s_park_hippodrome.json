It was built on the site of an old tramshed and opened on 25&nbsp;April 1904. It initially staged variety, dramas, pantomimes, and revues, which gave way to \"sizzlingly saucy\" French variety acts towards the end of the theatre's life.\nLike many other theatres of the period, the increasing competition from cinema resulted in its closure in 1952, and the building was eventually demolished in 1966.\nThe theatre was part of the Broadhead Circuit of 17 theatres at its peak, which had its headquarters at Hulme Hippodrome.\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n*"
