The programme is administered by the Green Award Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in the Netherlands. Certified ships can receive incentives such as discounts on port dues and maritime services at participating ports and companies.\nHistory\nThe Green Award scheme began in 1994 for seagoing vessels and was extended to inland navigation in 2011. Certification was opened to inland passenger vessels (including river cruise ships) in 2017.\nScope and criteria\nThe inland programme assesses ships and management against criteria that go beyond legal requirements, covering technical, operational and organisational aspects (e.g. emissions, waste handling, safety management and crew/owner practices). Certification is valid for 3 years with periodic audits. An additional \"Platinum\" label recognises ships sailing at least 50% of the time OR three hours a day with zero emissions operation in inland navigation.\nIncentives\nParticipating ports and service providers offer financial incentives to Green Award-certified ships. For example, the Port of Rotterdam grants discounts on specific dues for certified categories, and has also adopted Green Award verification for certain waste-fee incentives.\nNotable certifications\nIn 2020, AmaKristina became the first river cruise ship to receive Green Award certification, followed by broader certification across AmaWaterways' European fleet.  Industry coverage in 2025 noted the continued uptake of Green Award certification among European river ships; as of October 2025, the Green Award database lists 39 certified Viking River Cruises ships, 19 AmaWaterways ships, and 15 Avalon Waterways ships.\nSee also\n* Environmental certification\n* List of environmental awards\n* Inland water transport\nReferences\nExternal links\n[https://www.greenaward.org/inland-shipping/ Official website]"
