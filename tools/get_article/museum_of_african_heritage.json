It was founded in 1985, with the African Art collections of Hubert H Nicholson and Desiree Malik. The art collection has since expanded to contain Caribbean art, along with more African art. The museum also has a detailed history of the 1763 Berbice Slave Rebellion, along with artifacts celebrating notable Afro-Guyanese men and women.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
