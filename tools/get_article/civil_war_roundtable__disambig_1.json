The oldest such group in the United States is The Civil War Round Table of Chicago, which was founded in 1941 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. The second and perhaps third oldest are the Civil War Round Table of Milwaukee (founded in 1947) and the Civil War Round Table of Atlanta (founded in 1949). The Civil War Round Table of the District of Columbia ([https://www.cwrtdc.org/ www.cwrtdc.org]) was founded in 1951 by Bruce Catton and others. There are hundreds of such organizations throughout the U.S., with some in other countries as well.\nThere is no national organization that coordinates and publicizes the activities of the individual roundtables, although the CWRT Congress ([http://www.cwrtcongress.org/ www.cwrtcongress.org]) has been active in supporting them. Most roundtables follow a similar format of holding periodic meetings (some include a dinner on site or at a nearby restaurant) to make announcements about local Civil War history-related events, and to host a presentation by a guest speaker (usually a scholar, professor, author, artist, park ranger, battlefield preservationist, reenactor, or other expert). The meetings might also feature raffles, book signings, door prizes, auctions, fund raisers, and similar activities. Some CWRTs sponsor battlefield preservation events, battle walks, excursions, tours, and other \"sanctioned\" events.\nMany roundtables charge an annual membership fee to help defray expenses, and others cover costs by charging for individual dinner meetings or presentations. Several smaller CWRT groups do not charge any set fees, but instead \"pass the hat.\"  Many are IRS 501(c)(3) entities and accept donations or contributions that are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.\nSince 2004, Matthew Borowick has been writing a column in the Civil War News about round tables.  The column provides \"best practices\" information about the formation, management and administration of round tables.  He published The Civil War Round Table Handbook, a compilation of those columns, available on Amazon.  Mr. Borowick as well as Walter Rueckel and Mike Powell of the Brunswick CWRT, John Bamberl of the Scottsdale CWRT, and Michael Movius of the Puget Sound CWRT, among others, have hosted conferences at various locations in the U.S. attended by representatives from various roundtables based throughout the U.S. and Canada to discuss methods to enhance the operations of roundtables and increase collaboration among CWRTs and related groups.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.cwrtcongress.org/c-registry/websites.php/ A CWRT Locator Resource]\n*\n* [http://www.brunswickcivilwarroundtable.com Brunswick CWRT]\n* [http://buffalocivilwar.com/ Buffalo CWRT]\n* [http://www.cincinnaticwrt.org/ Cincinnati CWRT]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080723235233/http://www.clevelandcivilwarroundtable.com/ Cleveland CWRT]\n* [https://www.CWRTCongress.org/ CWRT Congress]\n* [http://cwrta.blogspot.com/ CWRT of Acadiana] (South-Central Louisiana)\n* [http://www.centralmassroundtable.org/ CWRT of Central Massachusetts]\n* [https://www.fortsumtercwrt.org/ CWRT of Charleston, SC]\n* [http://www.ChicagoCWRT.org/ CWRT of Chicago]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/CW.RT.NWA/ CWRT of NW Arkansas]\n* [http://www.cwrtdc.org/ CWRT of the District of Columbia]\n* [http://www.cwrto.com/ CWRT of the Ozarks, Springfield, MO]\n* [http://www.dvcwrt.org/home.html Delaware Valley CWRT]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120203204154/http://cwrtgettysburg.org/ Gettysburg CWRT]\n*[https://sites.google.com/view/hagerstowncwrt/home Hagerstown CWRT]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084936/http://www.idahocivilwarroundtable.com/ Idaho CWRT]\n* [http://www.kcwrt.org/ Knoxville CWRT]\n* [http://www.pscwrt.org/ Puget Sound CWRT]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/groups/276168967148/ Roanoke CWRT]\n* [http://www.southsuburbancwrt.com/ South Suburban (Chicago) CWRT]\n* [http://www.sicwrt.org/ Southern Indiana CWRT]\n* [https://tccwrt.com/ Twin Cities of Minnesota CWRT]"
