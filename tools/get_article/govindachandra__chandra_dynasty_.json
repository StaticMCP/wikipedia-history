In the inscription he was identified as Govindachandra of Vangaladesa.\nIn early 1049 CE, the Kalachuri king, Karnadeva (reigned 1042&ndash;1072) also launched an attack on Govindachandra (which may have been the downfall of the Chandra dynasty). According to Bengali folk ballads, Govichandra gave up his crown to live the rest of his life as an ascetic.\nRelation with Savar kingdom\nKing Govindachandra married the two daughters of Harishchandra Pala, the Mahishya Raja of Sarveshwar which was mentioned in local folk song named 'Mainamatir Gan'.\nReferences\n*"
