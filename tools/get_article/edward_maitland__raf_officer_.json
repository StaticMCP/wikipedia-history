He was a noted pioneer of lighter-than-air aviation.\nEarly life\nMaitland was the eldest son of Arthur Gee, a barrister from Cambridgeshire. The family name was changed to 'Maitland' in 1903.  He was educated at Haileybury and Trinity College, Cambridge, leaving Trinity without taking his degree to enlist in the Army.  He later took his degree in 1906, gaining a third.\nMilitary career\nMaitland was commissioned a second-lieutenant in the Essex Regiment on 23 May 1900, and served with the 2nd battalion of his regiment in the Orange River Colony during the Second Boer War in South Africa. He was promoted to lieutenant on 26 January 1902, and returned home with his battalion in October that year, after the end of the war three months earlier.\nOn 19 August 1911 Maitland was attached to the Royal Engineers' Air Battalion and later that year he was appointed Officer Commanding No. 1 Company, Air Battalion. (No. 1 Company, Air Battalion was subsequently renamed No. 1 Squadron RFC and then No. 1 Squadron RAF). In 1914, when the Army airships were transferred to the Navy, Maitland transferred to the Royal Naval Air Service and in the early months of World War I served with the Dunkirk Squadron, operating captive balloons.  Impressed by the kite-balloons being used by the French, he returned to Britain to promote their use to the War Office, and was appointed head of the kite balloon school which was established at Roehampton.  Early in 1916 he became the head of the Air Operational Department at the Admiralty, but this post did not suit him and he was appointed the head of the naval airship station at Pulham.  On 1 April 1918, with the merger of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps, Maitland transferred to the Royal Air Force. He was subsequently promoted to air commodore.\nAccomplishments in ballooning\nMaitland took up ballooning in 1908. On 18 November 1908, he flew with Mr C C Turner and Prof A E Gaudron in a balloon named the Mammoth from Crystal Palace in England to Meeki Derevi, near Novo Aleksandrovsk in Russia (now Zarasai in Lithuania).  The distance of  was covered in thirty-six and a half hours.  From 1909 Maitland was attached to the Balloon School at Farnborough Airfield.  In addition to ballooning, he also experimented with powered aircraft, but following a crash in which he broke both legs he restricted his activities to airships and balloons. He was awarded Royal Aero Club Airship Pilot certificate No.8 in September 1911 and in 1913 he carried out a parachute descent from the airship Delta.  In 1919 Maitland was on board the Airship R34 when it completed the first transatlantic crossing.\nOn 24 August 1921 Maitland was killed when the R38 airship on which he was a passenger suffered structural failure and broke up in mid air over the Humber. He was buried at Western Cemetery in Hull.\nSee also\n*List of accidents and incidents involving military aircraft (pre-1925)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/MaitlandE.htm Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation – Air Cdre Maitland]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070222132627/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/specialism/rem_spec_aero.htm Royal Engineers Museum] Royal Engineers and Aeronautics\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061218200955/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_special.htm#aero Royal Engineers Museum] Origins of the Royal Flying Corps/Royal Air Force\n*[http://www.remuseum.org.uk/corpshistory/rem_corps_part8.htm#equip Royal Engineers Museum] Early British Military Ballooning (1863)\n|-"
