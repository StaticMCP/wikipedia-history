It was founded on 30 September 1981 by retired Salvadoran Army Major Roberto D'Aubuisson. It defines itself as a political institution constituted to defend the democratic, republican, and representative system of government, the social market economy system and nationalism.\nARENA controlled the National Assembly of El Salvador until 1985, and its party leader Alfredo Cristiani was elected to the presidency in 1989. ARENA controlled the presidency from 1989 until 2009. The party gained a plurality in the Legislative Assembly in 2012.\nHistory\n, Antonio Saca, Armando Calderón Sol, and Francisco Flores Pérez, ARENA's Presidents of El Salvador]]\nThe Nationalist Republican Alliance was founded on 30 September 1981 during the Salvadoran Civil War. Its founding leader was Roberto D'Aubuisson, a former major in the Salvadoran Army who was most well-known for commanding various death squads and ordering the assassination of Archbishop Óscar Romero in 1980. At the time of ARENA's establishment, it was considered a far-right political party. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States described ARENA as \"reflect[ing] the personality\" of D'Aubuisson, and that the party's primary goals were to defeat the far-left Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) and \"restore El Salvador to the days before the 1979 officers' coup\".\nThe party's initial membership primarily consisted of members of the  (MNS) and the  (FAN) opposed to the ruling Revolutionary Government Junta (JRG) and the preceding government of the National Conciliation Party (PCN).\nThe party arose in response to \"the insurgency of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, FMLN, a group that united peasant farmers, unionists and intellectuals, which tried, through arms, to overthrow the dictatorship and to install a state regime inspired by the governments of revolutionary Cuba and Sandinista Nicaragua\".\nThe ideology the party claims to believe in is a system of democratic and representative government, emphasizing individual rights, the family as the nucleus of society and the respect for private property.\nIn February 2007, three ARENA politicians were murdered in Guatemala, including Eduardo D'Aubuisson, the son of party founder Roberto D'Aubuisson, in what was considered by the police as a crime related to drugs.\nIn 2009, ARENA took out a full-page ad in a Salvadoran newspaper calling on President Mauricio Funes to recognise the interim Honduran government of Roberto Micheletti installed after the military had expelled President Manuel Zelaya.\nOn 21 July 2022, Gustavo López Davidson, the leader of ARENA from August 2019 to February 2020, committed suicide amidst an ongoing investigation against him for embezzlement and arms trafficking.\nFrom 2021 to 2024, the party was the second largest in the Legislative Assembly. Following the election of Nuevas Ideas' Nayib Bukele, the party has lost members of its party delegation to the ruling party.\nStructure\nThe National Executive Council (, abbreviated COENA) is the leadership board of ARENA. Carlos García Saade has been the president of COENA since 27 February 2023.\nIn addition to the COENA, there are 14 Directors-in-Chief, one for each department and departmental councils called \"Juntas Directivas Conjuntas\" to coordinate political work in their respective department. In each department, a director is chosen who works with a specific member of COENA. The director's role is to organize and co-ordinate electoral campaigns and help the councils form party structures in the municipalities of their departments.\nARENA's party headquarters is located at 2429 Arce Street & North 45-47 Avenue in San Salvador. As of 2019, ARENA had 127,543 members.\nElectoral record\nAt the legislative elections held on 16 March 2003, the party won 32.0% of the popular vote and 27 out of 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly. ARENA's successful candidate in El Salvador's 2004 presidential election was Antonio Saca. On 21 March 2004, Saca defeated Schafik Hándal, the candidate of the left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), by a margin of 58% to 36% with 70% turnout. He was sworn in as president the following 1 June.\nIn the 12 March 2006 legislative election, the party won 39.4% of the popular vote and 32 out of 84 seats. At the 18 January 2009 legislative elections, the party received 38.55% of the vote, and again won 32 of the 84 seats.\nOn 15 March 2009, ARENA candidate Rodrigo Ávila lost the presidential election to Mauricio Funes of the FMLN. After elections, the party president was changed to Alfredo Cristiani.\nOn 9 March 2014, Salvador Sánchez Cerén of FMLN narrowly defeated the ARENA candidate Norman Quijano by 0.2% in a run-off vote in a controversial election.\nARENA also lost both 2019 presidential election and 2021 legislative election dominated by Nuevas Ideas, the party of current president Nayib Bukele. In 2024 election, ARENA got only two seats in the Legislative Assembly, while Bukele's Nuevas Ideas got supermajority.\nElectoral history\nPresidential elections\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Candidate\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | First round\n! colspan=\"2\" | Second round\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Result\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n!
