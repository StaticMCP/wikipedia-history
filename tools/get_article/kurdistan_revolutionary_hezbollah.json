It was a militant group that fought against the Ba'athist government during the Iran–Iraq War. It was close to the SCIRI. After the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the group was inactive as its fighters felt they had nothing else to fight. In 1999, the KRH trained militants of the Kurdish Hezbollah of Hüseyin Velioğlu in the city of Soran, Iraq.\nIn early 2024, amid an increase of attacks by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, IRGC channels claimed that the KRH was remobilising to attack American and Israeli interests in the Kurdistan Region. In late 2024, there were further reports of the KRH remobilising after more than twenty years of inactivity, although Adham Barzani distanced himself from the claims.\nSee also\n* Ittihadul Ulema (Union of Islamic Scholars and Schools)\n* Kurdish separatism in Iran (1918–present)\n** Iran–PJAK conflict (2004–present)\n* Kurdish–Iraqi conflict (1918–present)\n* Kurdish–Syrian conflict (2012–present)\n* Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1921–present)\n** Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey\n** Kurdistan Workers' Party insurgency (1978–2025)\n** Timeline of Kurdish uprisings\n* List of illegal political parties in Turkey\n* People killed by Kurdish Hezbollah\n** Konca Kuris, Turkish feminist, one of Hezbollah's victims\n* Shia Islamism\nKurdish Islamism\n* Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front (İBDA-C)\n** Salih Mirzabeyoğlu\n** State of Grandsublime\n* Islamic Emirate of Kurdistan (1994–2003)\n* Kurdish Hezbollah of Iran\n* Kurdish Hezbollah of Turkey\n* Kurdistan Islamic Movement (Turkey)\nKurdish unionism\n* Kurdistan independence movement\n** Abdullah Öcalan\n*** Imprisonment in Turkey (1999–present)\n** Democratic confederalism\n** Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK)\n** Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK)\n** Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)\nReferences\nBibliography\n* The Middle East and North Africa.
