In December 2010 the number of AMISOM troops was increased to 8,000 and later to 9,000. The battle's name usually includes the years, when referenced, in order to distinguish it amongst the nine major Battles of Mogadishu during the decades long Somali Civil War.\nBackground\nAl-Shabaab had previously declared a \"massive\" war against the internationally-backed Transitional Federal Government and AMISOM troop \"invaders.\" On 11 July 2010 they attacked Kampala, Uganda in revenge for the country's support of African Union troops in Somalia.\nThe attacks took place as hundreds of additional Ugandan troops arrived in the country.\nFighting\n2010\nAugust: Ramadan Offensive\nForty people were reportedly killed and more than one hundred injured in the violence that began on 23 August.

The next day, al-Shabaab said it had called eleven truckloads of reinforcements to take over the capital Mogadishu after a week-long battle. The government again, however, continued to deny claims that al-Shabaab was gaining any ground.\nOn 30 August, fighting was renewed when al-Shabaab fighters attempted to take a government barracks around Sigale in the capital's Hodan neighbourhood. The ensuring action left six confirmed dead and sixteen wounded and by the end of the month UPI reported that a mortar attack by al-Shabaab killed four Ugandan peacekeepers guarding the presidential palace in Mogadishu.
