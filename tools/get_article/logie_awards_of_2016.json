Public voting for the Best Award categories began on 16 November 2015, and ended on 17 January 2016. Nominations were announced on 3 April 2016, along with the winners of the Outstanding Newcomer Awards.\nIt was announced on 4 November 2015, that the 2016 Logie Awards would reinstate the Logie Award for Best Factual Program, as well as a new publicly voted category for Best News Panel or a Current Affairs Program. Two new industry-voted awards were also given, Logie Award for Most Outstanding Supporting Actor and Actress. Additionally, all publicly voted category awards changed their title from \"Most Popular\" to \"Best\" awards.\nDigital Content\nThe 2016 ceremony will also be the first to accept nominations for original Australian content produced by or airing on streaming media such as Netflix, Presto and Stan. Comedy series No Activity, distributed by Stan, earned 3 nominations, thus becoming the first program premiering on a streaming service to earn a Logie nomination.\nWinners and nominees\nNominees were announced at an event held in Melbourne on 3 April 2016, hosted by Peter Helliar and Sylvia Jeffreys.\nGold Logie\n{| class=wikitable width=\"50%\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\"| Best Personality on Australian Television\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Waleed Aly in The Project (Network Ten)'\n**Carrie Bickmore in The Project (Network Ten)\n**Scott Cam in The Block (Nine Network) and Reno Rumble (Nine Network)\n**Essie Davis in ''Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries (ABC)\n**Grant Denyer in Family Feud (Network Ten) and The Great Australian Spelling Bee (Network Ten)\n**Lee Lin Chin in SBS World News (SBS) and The Feed (SBS)\n|}\nActing/Presenting\n{| class=wikitable width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\"| Best Actor\n! width=\"25%\"| Best Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Erik Thomson in 800 Words (Seven Network)'\n**Firass Dirani in House Husbands (Nine Network)\n**Craig McLachlan in The Doctor Blake Mysteries (ABC)\n**Steve Peacocke in Home and Away (Seven Network)\n**Josh Thomas in Please Like Me (ABC)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Jessica Marais in Love Child (Nine Network)'\n**Essie Davis in Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries (ABC)\n**Marta Dusseldorp in A Place to Call Home (SoHo)\n**Julia Morris in House Husbands (Nine Network)\n**Bonnie Sveen in Home and Away (Seven Network)\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Actor\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Alex Dimitriades in The Principal (SBS)'\n**Hugh Dancy in Deadline Gallipoli (Showcase)\n**Malcolm Kennard in Catching Milat (Seven Network)\n**Patrick Brammall in Glitch (ABC)\n**Sam Neill in House of Hancock (Nine Network)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Deborah Mailman in Redfern Now: Promise Me (ABC)'\n**Essie Davis in Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries (ABC)\n**Mandy McElhinney in House of Hancock (Nine Network)\n**Pamela Rabe in Wentworth (SoHo)\n**Sarah Snook in The Beautiful Lie (ABC)\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Supporting Actor\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Supporting Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Tim Minchin in The Secret River (ABC)'\n**Daniel Wyllie in No Activity (Stan)\n**David Berry in A Place to Call Home (SoHo)\n**Ryan Corr in Banished (BBC First)\n**Tim Minchin in No Activity (Stan)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Celia Ireland in Wentworth (SoHo)'\n**Emily Barclay in Glitch (ABC)\n**Harriet Dyer in Love Child (Nine Network)\n**Jenni Baird in A Place to Call Home (SoHo)\n**Rarriwuy Hick in Redfern Now: Promise Me (ABC)\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Best New Talent\n! width=\"50%\"| Best Presenter\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Adam Dovile in Better Homes and Gardens (Seven Network)'\n**Benson Jack Anthony in 800 Words (Seven Network)\n**Dan Reilly in The Block (Nine Network)\n**Joel Jackson in Deadline Gallipoli (Showcase) and Peter Allen: Not the Boy Next Door (Seven Network)\n**Pia Miller in Home and Away (Seven Network)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Waleed Aly in The Project (Network Ten)'\n**Carrie Bickmore in The Project (Network Ten)\n**Grant Denyer in Family Feud (Network Ten) and The Great Australian Spelling Bee (Network Ten)\n**Amanda Keller in The Living Room (Network Ten)\n**Lee Lin Chin in SBS World News (SBS) and The Feed (SBS)\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Newcomer - Actor\n! width=\"50%\"| Most Outstanding Newcomer - Actress\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Joel Jackson in Peter Allen: Not the Boy Next Door (Seven Network)'\n**Joel Jackson in Deadline Gallipoli (Showcase)\n**Rahel Romahn in The Principal (SBS)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Melina Vidler in 800 Words (Seven Network)'\n**Hannah Monson in Glitch (ABC)\n**Sara West in Peter Allen: Not the Boy Next Door (Seven Network)\n|-\n! width=\"25%\"| Graham Kennedy Breakthrough Star of Tomorrow\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Ky Baldwin in Peter Allen: Not the Boy Next Door (Seven Network)'\n**Benson Jack Anthony in 800 Words (Seven Network)\n**Olivia DeJonge in Hiding (ABC)\n|}\nBest Programs\n{| class=wikitable width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! width=\"50%\"| Best Drama Program\n! width=\"50%\"| Best Entertainment Program\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Home and Away (Seven Network)'\n**800 Words (Seven Network)\n**A Place to Call Home (SoHo)\n**House Husbands (Nine Network)\n**Love Child (Nine Network)\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'Family Feud (Network Ten)'\n**Gruen (ABC)\n**Have You Been Paying Attention?

Seven had offered to work around these logistics if they could be assured that Seven News had won a Logie award. In the interests of maintaining the security of the Logies results, TV Week could not release such information to the news department in advance, even in the strictest confidence. The Logie was instead accepted on stage by their boss Rob Rashke.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
