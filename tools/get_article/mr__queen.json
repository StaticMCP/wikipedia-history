The series was also criticised as the author of the original Chinese drama has made negative remarks about Korea in their other work. The producers released a statement clarifying their stance and apologising for the controversies, adding that they were not aware of the negative comments made by the novelist.\nDomestic audience viewership\nAn 8.0% viewership rating was recorded nationwide for the first episode, making it the second-highest premiere rating of any weekend drama of the network and fifth-highest premiere rating of the network after Hospital Playlist 2, Jirisan, Mr. Sunshine, and Encounter.\nAs per Nielsen Korea, the final episode logged a national average viewership of 17.37%, breaking its own highest ratings, thereby making the series 5th highest-rated drama in Korean cable television history.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;max-width:450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none\"\n|-\n|+ Average TV viewership ratings\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Original broadcast date\n! colspan=\"2\" | Average audience share(Nielsen Korea)\n|-\n!
