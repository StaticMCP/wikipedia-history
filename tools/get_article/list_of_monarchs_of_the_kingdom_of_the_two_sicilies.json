Though he controlled the mainland, he never physically controlled the island of Sicily, where his Bourbon rival had fled from Naples.\nAfter the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the title of king of Two Sicilies was adopted by Ferdinand IV of Naples in 1816. Under Ferdinand's rule, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily were unified. He had previously been king separately of both Naples and Sicily.\nList of kings\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n! width=\"5%\" |Portrait\n! width=\"15%\" |Name\n! width=\"5%\" |Arms\n! width=\"24%\" |Reign\n! width=\"18%\" |Succession\n! width=\"25%\" |Life details\n|-\n|\n|Ferdinand IFerdinando I\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|12 December 1816 – 4 January 1825()\n| align=\"center\" |Son of Charles&nbsp;III of Spain\n| align=\"center\" |12 January 1751 – 4 January 1825(aged 73)\n|-\n|\n|Francis IFrancesco I\n|4 January 1825 – 8 November 1830()\n| align=\"center\" |Son of Ferdinand I\n| align=\"center\" |19 August 1777 – 8 November 1830(aged 53)\n|-\n|\n|Ferdinand IIFerdinando II\n|8 November 1830 – 22 May 1859()\n| align=\"center\" |Son of Francis I\n| align=\"center\" |12 January 1810 – 22 May 1859(aged 49)\n|-\n|\n|Francis IIFrancesco II\n|22 May 1859 – 20 March 1861()\n| align=\"center\" |Son of Ferdinand II\n| align=\"center\" |16 January 1836 – 27 December 1894(aged 58)\n|}\nSee also\n* List of consorts of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\n* List of monarchs of Naples\n* List of monarchs of Sicily\n* County of Apulia and Calabria\n* Descendants of Charles III of Spain\n* House of Bourbon\nReferences"
