Republican nominee George H. W. Bush, Democratic nominee Bill Clinton, and Independent candidate Ross Perot met the criteria for inclusion in the debates. The CPD-sponsored vice presidential debate took place between their respective vice presidential running mates, Dan Quayle, Al Gore, and James Stockdale.\nDebate schedule\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-†\n! colspan=\"17\" style=\"background:#B0C4DE\" | 1992 United States presidential election debates\n|-\n!style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|&nbsp; || Date & time || Host || Location|| Moderator || colspan=\"11\" scope=\"col\" | Participants\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\" rowspan=\"2\" |Key: Participant. &nbsp;   Non-invitee. &nbsp;\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #34AAE0;\"|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #FF3333;\"|\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em; background: #DDDDDD;\"|\n|-\n!

One of the most memorable moments from the debate came early in the night. Bruno, in his capacity as debate moderator, asked James Stockdale, \"Admiral Stockdale, your opening statement, please, sir?\" Stockdale famously replied to Bruno's request: \"Who am I? Why am I here?\"\nBruno also scolded the debate's audience when they jeered candidates Quayle and Gore, saying, \"There’s no call for that ... so knock that off.\"\nThe format decided was:\n* two minute opening statements\n* issue presented to candidates with one minute\n* 15 seconds to respond\n* five minute discussion period about same topic followed\n* two minute closing statements.\nViewership\nAn estimated 51.2 million viewers tuned into the debate.\nOctober 15: Second presidential debate (University of Richmond)\n|venue=University of Richmond\n|location=Richmond, Virginia\n|participants=George H.
