      "text": "# Warden Chilcott\n\nLieutenant-Commander Sir Harry Warden Stanley Chilcott,  (11 March 1871 – 8 March 1942), also known as Warden Chilcott, was Conservative MP for Liverpool Walton. His wife was Beatrice F. Chilcott.\nIn 1934, a golf course was laid out on Chilcott's private estate in Hampshire, by the name of Hook Park Golf Club. The course was mainly used for entertainment and was eventually auctioned off by his wife, Beatrice in the late 1940s following Chilcott's death. It was purchased by a Mr R Knight and subsequently leased to the Southampton School of Navigation and Warsash College.\nIn 1932, Chilcott published a book, 'Political Salvation' with a foreword by Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain.\nDuring the First World War, he served with the Royal Naval Air Service in France. A flamboyant self-made businessman and sportsman, he was elected with the backing of the Coalition government in 1918, was returned unopposed in 1922 and 1923, was elected again in 1924, and stood down in 1929. He was knighted in 1922.\nChilcott was a close friend of both Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain and Ivy Chamberlain, the couple's \"infatuation\" with Chilcott which was \"inexplicable to almost everyone\". He arranged for Chamberlain to meet foreign statesmen on his yacht Dolphin, including Benito Mussolini, whom both admired. Their relationship was severed in 1935, after Chilcott behaved badly toward the Queen of Spain when Chilcott and the Chamberlains were holidaying in Corsica.\nSources\n*British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949, FWS Craig\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*P.
