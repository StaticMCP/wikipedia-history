      "text": "# Best Male Tennis Player ESPY Award\n\nThe Best Male Tennis Player ESPY Award has been presented annually since 1993 to the professional male tennis player adjudged to be the best in a given calendar year.\nBetween 1993 and 2004, the award voting panel comprised variously fans; sportswriters and broadcasters, sports executives, and retired sportspersons, termed collectively experts; and ESPN personalities, but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the Internet from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.\nThrough the 2001 iteration of the ESPY Awards, ceremonies were conducted in February of each year to honor achievements over the previous calendar year; awards presented thereafter are conferred in June and reflect performance from the June previous. The award wasn't awarded in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStarting in 2023, the Best Male Tennis Player ESPY Award and Best Female Tennis Player ESPY Award were combined into one Best Tennis Player ESPY Award. The ESPY Award that year was presented to Novak Djokovic over finalists Carlos Alcaraz, Aryna Sabalenka, and Iga Świątek.\nList of winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n!Year\n!Player\n!Nation represented\n!Other announced finalists\n|-\n|1993\n|Jim Courier\n|\n|\n|-\n|1994\n|Pete Sampras\n|\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|Pete Sampras (2)\n|\n|\n|-\n|1996\n|Pete Sampras (3)\n|\n|\n|-\n|1997\n|Pete Sampras (4)\n|\n|\n|-\n|1998\n|Pete Sampras (5)\n|\n|\n|-\n|1999\n|Pete Sampras (6)\n|\n|Andre Agassi ( United States) Yevgeny Kafelnikov ()\n|-\n|2000\n|Andre Agassi\n|\n|Yevgeny Kafelnikov () Pete Sampras ()\n|-\n|2001\n|Pete Sampras (7)\n|\n|Yevgeny Kafelnikov () Gustavo Kuerten () Marat Safin ()\n|-\n|2002\n|Lleyton Hewitt\n|\n|Andre Agassi () Gustavo Kuerten ()\n|-\n|2003\n|Andre Agassi (2)\n|\n|Juan Carlos Ferrero () Lleyton Hewitt () Pete Sampras (\n|-\n|2004\n|Andy Roddick\n|\n|Andre Agassi () Roger Federer () Juan Carlos Ferrero ()\n|-\n|2005\n|Roger Federer\n|\n|Rafael Nadal () Andy Roddick () Marat Safin ()\n|-\n|2006\n|Roger Federer (2)\n|\n|James Blake () Rafael Nadal () David Nalbandian ()\n|-\n|2007\n|Roger Federer (3)\n|\n|James Blake () Rafael Nadal () Andy Roddick )\n|-\n|2008\n|Roger Federer (4)\n|\n|Novak Djokovic () Rafael Nadal ()\n|-\n|2009\n|Roger Federer (5)\n|\n|Rafael Nadal ()\n|-\n|2010\n|Roger Federer (6)\n|\n|Juan Martín del Potro () Rafael Nadal ()\n|-\n|2011\n|Rafael Nadal\n|\n|Roger Federer () Novak Djokovic ()\n|-\n|2012\n|Novak Djokovic\n|\n|Roger Federer () Rafael Nadal ()\n|-\n|2013\n|Novak Djokovic (2)\n|\n|Roger Federer () Rafael Nadal () Andy Murray ()\n|-\n|2014\n|Rafael Nadal (2)\n|\n|Novak Djokovic () Andy Murray ()\n|-\n|2015\n|Novak Djokovic (3)\n|\n|Marin Cilic () Roger Federer () Stan Wawrinka ()\n|-\n|2016\n|Novak Djokovic (4)\n|\n|Andy Murray () Roger Federer ()\n|-\n|2017\n|Roger Federer (7)\n|\n|Andy Murray () Rafael Nadal ( Stan Wawrinka ()\n|-\n|2018\n|Roger Federer (8)\n|\n|Rafael Nadal () Marin Cilic ()\n|-\n|2019\n|Roger Federer (9)\n|\n|Rafael Nadal () Novak Djokovic () Stefanos Tsitsipas ()\n|-\n|2020\n| colspan=3 align=center|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic\n|-\n|2021\n|Novak Djokovic (5)\n|\n|Daniil Medvedev () Rafael Nadal () Dominic Thiem ()\n|-\n|2022\n|Rafael Nadal (3)\n|\n|Carlos Alcaraz () Dylan Alcott ()  Félix Auger-Aliassime ()\n|-\n|2023\n|Novak Djokovic (6)\n|\n|Carlos Alcaraz () Iga Swiatek ()  Aryna Sabalenka ()\n|}\nMultiple winners\nRoger Federer is the only male player to win the award eight and nine times.
