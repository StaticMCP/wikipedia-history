Some leagues usually maintain official lists of dynasties, often as part of a hall of fame, but in many cases, whether a team or individual has achieved a dynasty is subjective. This can result in frequent topic of debate among sports fans due to lack of consensus and agreement in the many different variables and criteria that fans may use to define a sports dynasty. Merriam-Webster describes a dynasty as a \"sports franchise which has a prolonged run of successful seasons\". Within the same sport, or even the same league, dynasties may be concurrent with each other. This is a list of teams that have been called a dynasty after periods of success. The use of the term to characterize such prolonged success emerged in the early 20th century.\nAssociation football\nClub\nAmerican Major League Soccer\n* D.C.

This victory was only the beginning of dominance, as the club won the league title twelve more times, setting a new English record of 20 top-tier titles. Manchester United also lifted the FA Cup during this period with victories in 1993–94, 1995–96, 1998–99 and 2003–04.

The club's dominance was extended to the international spotlight starting in 1977 when the club won the UEFA Cup without foreign footballers, an unprecedented achievement for any country's team. Subsequently, the club lifted the Cup Winners' Cup and the European Champions Cup becoming the first club in the history of European football to have won all three seasonal confederation competitions.

He did so while at the same time securing one of the strongest defending packages of all time, thanks to individuals such as Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini.

During this 15-year period, Bob and Mike Bryan won 16 men's doubles Grand Slams and one Olympic gold medal, spending a record 438 weeks at world No. 1.\nVolleyball\n* The Concordia University (Saint Paul) women's volleyball team have captured NCAA Division II Championships in seven consecutive seasons – the only NCAA volleyball program to accomplish the feat at the Division I or II levels. Their seven total volleyball titles is more than any program as well, with the sport dating back to 1980, at the women's Division II level. Their head coach, Brady Starkey, boasts a 306–26 overall record (.926) making him the winningest active NCAA volleyball coach in any division by overall percentage. They have also mounted 9 consecutive conference Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference championships (from 2003 to 2011) including 6-undefeated conference campaigns.\n* The NCAA Division III Washington University in St. Louis women's volleyball team were the first volleyball team to win six consecutive national championships, from 1991 to 1996. They have won a total of 10 NCAA championships, including 26 consecutive appearances in the championship tournament dating back to 1987, the most of any program at any level.\nWrestling\n* University of Iowa Hawkeyes have 24 total NCAA championships. The dynasty runs are from 1975 to 1986 (11 NCAA championships in 12 years), from 1991 to 2000 (9 NCAA championships in 10 years) and three consecutive national championships from 2008 to 2010. Iowa also had a dynasty run of 25 straight Big Ten conference tournament championships from 1974 to 1998.\n* Penn State University Nittany Lions won four consecutive NCAA team championships from 2011 to 2014, four consecutive again from 2016 to 2019, and have won another four consecutive championships since 2022. Led by head coach Cael Sanderson, three-time champion Ed Ruth, and two-time champion plus two-time Dan Hodge Trophy winner David Taylor, the program has won 12 titles in the past 15 seasons.\nDynasties in question\nMost disputes about dynasties relate to teams that dominated within a conference or division, but either failed to win championships or infrequently won championships. This is exacerbated in NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A), where the national champion is determined, at least in part, by poll rather than through a tournament.\n* Boise State Broncos football from 1998 to 2008. At 113–26, their 81.29% win rate was the highest in the nation. Won ten of twelve conference championships from 1999 to 2009, undefeated in conference play in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2009, perfect seasons in 2006 and 2009, but were never selected to play in a BCS National Championship Game.\n* Detroit Red Wings of the mid-1990s through the late 2000s. Although not officially listed by the NHL as a dynasty, the Red Wings won four Stanley Cups in eleven seasons  (1997, 1998, 2002, 2008) and went to the Stanley Cup Finals six times in fourteen seasons (1995, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2008, and 2009). The Red Wings had the best team record during both the 1990s and 2000s, accumulating the most points of any franchise during each decade. Detroit won the Presidents' Trophy for the best regular season record in the NHL in 1995, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008, in all winning their division thirteen times during this span. The Red Wings qualified for the playoffs in 25 consecutive seasons from 1991 through 2016.\n* Chicago Blackhawks of the early 2010s are also not officially listed by the NHL as a dynasty, but won three Stanley Cups in six seasons (2010, 2013, and 2015), as well as a Presidents Trophy in 2013 and acknowledgment by the NHL as their \"Franchise of the Decade\" for the 2010s. When they were presented with their third Stanley Cup in 2015, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman colloquially referred to the team as a \"dynasty\" as well.\n* England national rugby union team 1991–2003, 7 Five/Six Nations Championships, four Grand Slams, 2003 World Cup. While England was the form team in Europe in the 1990s, they were unable to break through and win the World Cup until 2003, losing to Australia in the final of 1991 and failing to match the same performance in 1995 and 1999. Additionally, England struggled to beat the leading southern hemisphere sides, the Springboks and the New Zealand All Blacks until 2000 and 2002 respectively, with the team peaking from 2002 to early 2004, under the leadership of Clive Woodward, before a slow, long decline, foreshadowing the North–South divide in rugby that was to become the norm from the mid-2000s.\n* San Antonio Spurs of 1999 to 2017 led by Tim Duncan (1997–2016), David Robinson (1989–2003), Tony Parker (2001–2018), Manu Ginóbili (2002–2018), Kawhi Leonard (2011–2018), and head coach Gregg Popovich. (five NBA championships (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014) in nineteen seasons, six Western Conference titles, thirteen division championships, and nineteen consecutive playoff appearances from 1998 to 2017, with a .712 win percentage during that span, the highest in any of the four major American sports) are considered a dynasty by some, but not by others because they did not win consecutive titles.\n* San Francisco Giants: From 2010 to 2014. Led by manager Bruce Bochy, Buster Posey, Madison Bumgarner, Pablo Sandoval and Hunter Pence. The Giants won three World Series championships in a 5-year span (2010, 2012, and 2014). They are only the second NL team ever, since the 1940s St. Louis Cardinals, to do so. However, despite winning three championships, some do not consider the Giants a dynasty because they did not win consecutive titles nor did they even make the playoffs in the years between (2011 and 2013, the latter of which had them post a losing record). At the same time, official MLB material since 2022 has classified them as a dynasty with multiple outlets in years since 2014 calling them a dynasty.\n* University of Southern California football, 2002–2005&nbsp;– two consecutive AP national championships (2003 and 2004), appearance in the 2005 National Championship Game, seven straight Pac-10 titles, six major bowl wins in seven years (Rose: 2003 and 2007–2009, Orange: 2004 and 2005), and maintained a 34-game winning streak from 2003 to 2005. However, USC was forced to vacate two wins from the 2004 season including the Orange Bowl win and BCS national Championship, all wins from the 2005 season, and the Pac-10 titles from both of those seasons as the result of rules violations involving star running back Reggie Bush.\n* Washington Redskins from 1982 to 1991, led by head coach Joe Gibbs and with running back John Riggins and the Hogs, the Redskins made seven playoff appearances and won three of their four Super Bowl appearances over the course of a decade. However, once Gibbs retired, the Redskins never returned to a Super Bowl with their last appearance being Super Bowl XXVI and the most plausible reason why they weren't considered a dynasty at the time was due to the fact that they were overshadowed by the 49ers dynasty.\n* Houston Astros: From 2017 to 2023. Under the ownership of Jim Crane and led by players such as Jose Altuve, Justin Verlander, and Alex Bregman, the Astros have won six AL West titles in seven seasons, played in the ALCS a record seven consecutive years, and won four AL pennants and two World Series titles. Although their high consistency within the American League has been noted, many baseball fans debate whether this team is a dynasty due to the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, the team only having won two World Series titles separated by five seasons, and because only five players were on both championship teams.\n* Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders: 1967–85. No NFL team enjoyed more consistent success than the Raiders during this span. During this 17-year run, the Raiders won 11 division titles, earned 15 playoff berths, captured one AFL title and three Super Bowls. The '76 Raiders captured the franchise's first Super Bowl after going 13–1 during the regular season. They then dismantled the defending two-time champion Steelers in the AFC title game before routing the Vikings in Super Bowl XI. Four years later, coach Tom Flores and quarterback Jim Plunkett helped the Raiders become the first franchise to win the Super Bowl as a wild-card team. The '83 Raiders, on the strength of running back Marcus Allen and cornerbacks Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes, held Washington's record-setting offense to just one touchdown in the Raiders' 38–9 win in Super Bowl XVIII.\nNotes\nThe 1916 and 1917 VFA seasons were cancelled due to World War IThe Football League suspended operations between 1939–40 and 1945–46 inclusive due to World War II and planning difficulties in its aftermath.\nAlso called Tripletta Tricolore, Italian Football Federation (FIGC) regards the national supercup legally as a seasonal competition in its own official matches calendar.\nThe Allied conquest of Italy caused normal Serie A football to be suspended between 1943 and 1944 and 1945–46, though the 1946 scudetto is considered official.\nReferences"
