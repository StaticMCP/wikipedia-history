      "text": "# Paris Revolutions\n\nParis Revolutions was a French daily newspaper published during the French Revolution from 1789 to 1794.\nHistory\nFrom 12 July 1789, the date of its first publication, the daily newspaper enjoyed great success. Camille Desmoulins advanced the figure of two hundred thousand readers which appears exaggerated. The newspaper was pro-revolutionary, but readers with moderate opinions appreciated the subtlety of its political analyses.\nThe main editors of the journal were Elisée Loustalot, Sylvain Maréchal, Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette, Fabre d'Églantine, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax.\nOn 28 February 1794, the publisher Louis Marie Prudhomme ceased the publication of his newspaper. Pro-revolutionary in 1789, he was suspected of modérantisme under the Reign of Terror and chose to cease publication to avoid execution.\nBibliography\nExternal links\n* Consulter les numéros des [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb328561374/date Révolutions de Paris] sur Gallica, bibliothèque numérique de la BnF"
