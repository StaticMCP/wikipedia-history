Benny Gantz salutes Yom Kippur War casualties at an official annual memorial service for fallen soldiers.]]\nIsraeli casualties of war, in addition to those of Israel's nine major wars, include soldiers and security forces personnel killed in \"miscellaneous engagements and terrorist attacks\", which includes security forces members killed during military operations, by fighting crime, natural disasters, diseases, traffic or labor accidents and disabled veterans whose disabilities contributed to their deaths. Between 1948 and 1997, 20,093 Israeli soldiers were killed in combat, 75,000 Israelis were wounded, and nearly 100,000 Israelis were considered disabled army veterans. On the other hand, in 2010 Yom HaZikaron, Israel honored the memory of 22,684 Israeli soldiers and people of the Yishuv killed since 1860 in the line of duty for the independence, preservation and protection of the nation, and 3,971 civilian terror victims. The memorial roll, in addition to IDF members deceased, also include fallen members of the Shin Bet security service, the Mossad intelligence service, the Israel Police, the Border Police, the Israel Prisons Service, other Israeli security forces, the pre-state Jewish underground, and the Jewish Brigade and the Jewish Legion (which served in the British army in World War II and World War I respectively).\nAccording to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Anti-Defamation League, a total of 1,194 Israelis and foreigners were killed and 7,000 wounded between September 2000 and August 2010 by Palestinian terror attacks (most of them during 2000–2005 Second Intifada); while more than 3,000 Israelis have been killed and 25,000 have been wounded as a result of Palestinian violence and hostile enemy action (without including wars) since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 until today. Another 685 Jewish residents of Mandatory Palestine were killed between 1920 and 1947 as a result of Arab riots, British anti-Zionist operations and World War II attacks. Palestinians killed 1,074 Israelis and wounded 7,520 between 2000 and 2005.\nThe following tables summarize Israeli casualties by war, conflict, or incident.\nPrior to Israel's founding\nConflicts with Arabs\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

European Jews were anxious for ways to leave Europe, but for the most part there were few options. No countries were willing to take Jewish immigrants. However, some Eastern European states were willing to give transit visas. During World War II, many countries denied or severely limited Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, and Palestine was one of the few destinations available.\nIn post-Holocaust Europe, the 1,000,000 Jewish survivors were classified as \"non-repatrifiable\" by the Austrian and German government. In other words, Jews were not \"officially allowed to leave the countries of Central and East Europe\" by the allied powers, nor were they permitted to settle in Palestine by the British.\nAn unknown number of Jewish refugees perished en route from European ports to Palestine, and over 30,000 holocaust survivors who successfully immigrated were interned by the British in POW camps. Many immigrant ships were sunk during the British blockade.\nNote: Graph is not comprehensive\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!
