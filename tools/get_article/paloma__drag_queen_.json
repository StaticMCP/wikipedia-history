She is best known for winning the first season of Drag Race France.\nEarly life\nHugo Bardin was born on June 30, 1991. He took his first theater lessons at the age of four, which gave rise to his desire to work in this field. After the baccalaureate, which he obtained in Clermont-Ferrand, his hometown, he continued his studies at Cours Florent, in Paris. During this time, he exercised several professions in the field of theatre, in particular an actor, but also a director or a wigmaker.\nCareer\nBardin's first experience as a drag queen dates back to 2008, in a staging of the play titled Nur eine Scheibe Brot by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, performed at the Comédie de Clermont-Ferrand. However, Bardin did not immediately continue in the field of drag performance professionally, instead favoring his career as an actor. During this period, Bardin felt compelled to \"be more masculine,\" to obtain better success in his auditions. Conversely, performing in drag offered him an opportunity to \"be whoever I want, kind of like a superhero,\" which ultimately inspired Bardin to pursue drag more seriously.\nIn 2018, Bardin debuted the character of Paloma. The Spanish-sounding first name was inspired by the cinema of Pedro Almodóvar and recalls Paloma Picasso.\nIn 2022, Paloma's eponymous short film, directed by herself, and was released at festivals. On June 2, 2022, it was announced that she was one of the ten candidates participating in the first season of Drag Race France. At the end of the finale, she won against Soa de Muse and La Grande Dame.\nIn 2024, Bardin served on the jury for the Queer Palm award at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.\nDiscography\nSingles\nAs a lead artist\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Album\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\"Love, l'artère\"(with Marc Bret-Vittoz)\n| 2022\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\"P.A.L.O.M.A\"(with Rebeka Warrior & RAUMM)\n| 2024\n|\n|\n|-\n!\"Poison\"\n(with Elips)\n|2025\n|Château intérieur\n|\n|}\nAs a featured artist\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Album\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |\"Boom Boom (Les Sœurs Jacquettes)\"with Drag Race France Cast (season 1) (La Big Bertha and La Grande Dame)\n| 2022\n|\n|\n|}\nAlbums\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Title\n!Year\n!Ref.\n|-\n|Château intérieur\n|2025\n|\n|}\nFilmography\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em; class=\"unsortable\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em; class=\"unsortable\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 13em; class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 2022–23\n| Drag Race France\n| Herself/Contestant\n| Winner (Season 1)Special guest (Season 2)\n|\n|-\n| Une si longue nuit\n| Stéphanie\n| TV series (1 episode)\n|-\n| La boîte à secrets\n| Herself\n| Performer with Soa de Muse and Elips\n|\n|-\n| C l'hebdo\n| Herself\n| Guest\n|\n|-\n| Quotidien\n| Herself\n| Guest\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 2023\n| Balthazar\n| Paloma\n| TV series (4 episodes)\n|-\n|The Drag Race France Phenomenon: One Year with the Queens\n| Herself\n| France 2 documentary\n|\n|-\n|Drama queen chez Paloma\n| Herself\n| Host\n|\n|-\n| 2023–24\n|The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon\n|Coco\n|TV series (2 episodes)\n|\n|}\nWeb series\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em; class=\"unsortable\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em; class=\"unsortable\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 13em; class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2022\n| Le Parisien\n| Herself\n| Guest, Digital popcast\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2022\n| Tea Time\n| Herself\n| Guest with La Briochée, and Kam Hugh, by Tinder France\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2022\n| La Boîte à Questions\n| Herself\n| Guest\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2022\n| France Inter\n| Herself\n| Guest; podcast\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2023\n| Drag & The City\n| Herself\n| Guest\n|\n|}\nShort film\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em; class=\"unsortable\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em; class=\"unsortable\" | Role\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 13em; class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| 14 Septembre\n| Foxy\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| Seul ensemble\n|\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| Tohu Bohu\n| Stan\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2022\n| Paloma\n| Paloma\n| Self-directed and written\n|\n|}\nTheater\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 10em; class=\"unsortable\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 13em; class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n|-\n| 2023-24\n| Paloma au plurielles''\n| One-woman-show\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
