Bundy (Raymond Walburn), the president of the Bundy Steel Company of Bundy, Pennsylvania, sends troublesome employees \"Big\" Ben Wheeler (Victor McLaglen) and \"Chesty\" Webb (Brian Donlevy) to New York City to break up Bundy's son Jack's (Robert Kellard) engagement to suspected gold digger Marjorie Clark (Lynn Bari).  Jack discovers his father's plot, and turns the tables on the brawling steelworkers:  he asks gorgeous Linda Lee (Gypsy Rose Lee)--the object of the competitive Big Ben's and Chesty's amorous pursuits—to pretend she's his fiancé, to put the boys off the trail. Trouble ensues when Homer arrives in NYC...and falls for Linda.\nCast\n*Victor McLaglen as Big Ben Wheeler\n*Brian Donlevy as Chesty Webb\n*Gypsy Rose Lee as Linda Lee\n*Raymond Walburn as Homer C.

In a 1938 review for the film The New York Times stated \"Though it will not be hailed as one of the year's finer historical films and might even be said, despite the riot scenes, to suffer from a ind of timid civilian understatement, the extent of which can only be measured by those who have lived through \"the terror\" – as we of the Times Square area tend to think of it – \"Battle of Broadway\" seems to provoke enough of those tolerant, unanalytical audience guffaws to justify its modestly budgeted existence.\"\nDVD Talk gave a favorable review for Battle of Broadway, writing that it was a \"Knockabout farce, energetically handled\" and that \"By the time the movie wraps up with its third or fourth unapologetic big brawl, Battle of Broadway's hard-won rough-and-tumble pose becomes positively endearing.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
