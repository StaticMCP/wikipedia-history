The car is equipped with many life-saving, offensive, and defensive measures, and is built to the Federal Protective Service's standards.\nThe Aurus Senat was developed in Russia by the NAMI as part of the \"Kortezh\" project. The Senat was publicly presented for the first time at the Fourth inauguration of Vladimir Putin in 2018.[http://www.autoblog.com/2016/04/05/russian-president-putins-new-limo-makes-debut-ahead-of-2017-pro/ Russian President Putin's new limo makes debut ahead of 2017 production - Autoblog]\nPrevious generations\nUnder the USSR, the General Secretary of the Communist Party was always driven in a Soviet-built ZIL-41052, escorted by Chaikas. Two ZIL limousines are still maintained in the Kremlin garage, and are occasionally used in Day of Victory military parades.\nThe first foreign limousine used by a Russian president was a W140 Mercedes-Benz S-Class purchased for Boris Yeltsin. This was superseded by a Mercedes-Benz W220, then by a W221. The limousines used by Presidents Yeltsin and Medvedev were stretched and armoured by the Belgian firm Carat Duchatelet; for Medvedev's inauguration a special Carat Duchatelet limousine with a raised roof was ordered. Putin's Mercedes was a Mercedes-Benz-produced S600 Pullman Guard.\nOperation\nRecent Russian presidential state cars have been bulletproof, had solid rubber tires, and carried an array of communications equipment.\nOn state visits, the state car is airlifted to the destination by an Ilyushin Il-76 transport aircraft.\nThe presidential motorcade is usually escorted by Ural or BMW motorcycles; and Mercedes G-Class, Mercedes E-Class, S-Class, BMW 5 Series, Volkswagen Caravelle, and/or Chevrolet support vehicles.\nNational transport services for the Russian President are provided by the Special Purpose Garage (SPG).  The SPG is a unit within the Federal Protective Service.\n\"Scorpion\" car for presidential guards]]\nSee also\n* Official state car\n* Aurus Senat\n* ZiL\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://nami.ru/en/projects/emp Unified modular platform // The Government of the Russian Federation assigned FSUE “NAMI” to develop a car for the state leaders]\n* [http://www.articlespromoter.com/Art/1100955/196/Everything-you-need-to-know-about-Aurus-The-Russian-President-Putin-Limo-Brand.html Every thing you need to know about Russian President Limo Brand Aurus Car]"
