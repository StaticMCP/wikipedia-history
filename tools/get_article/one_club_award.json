The award is presented at halftime during an Athletic Bilbao home match by club ambassador José Ángel Iribar.\nIt is one of the few awards given out by an individual club that celebrates players from other teams. For that reason, the award has been described as rare point of non-tribalism in the modern game. The male award, The One Club Man, has been awarded since 2015, while also awarding a female award, known as One Club Woman, from 2019.\nThe Award\nThe prize exists to honour players who have demonstrated a \"real\" connection to region of their club. Athletic Bilbao place particular importance on player loyalty and promotion from within, with the majority of their players graduating from their youth academy system based at the Lezama Facilities outside Bilbao; they have a self-imposed limitation where they will only field players that have a connection to the Basque region where they are based. As such they have a small pool of potential players to choose from compared to other large clubs, and their players are encouraged to agree to long-term contracts to remain.\nAccording to the club, up until the 21st century \"the association between clubs and the territory they belonged to was a football club’s most important identifying feature\". This feature is what they call the Principle of Origin - \"which boils down to: I support the team of where I come from because their players represent me and share my origin. They are “our players”. In recent years, the club believes that the principle of origin has been superseded by success at all costs with clubs often featuring teams without any players from the city the club represents.\nValues\nAthletic Club define the club's values as:\n* Loyalty\n** Towards the club that placed their trust in a young, promising player and developed that player into an elite footballer.\n* Commitment\n** To fostering a football culture that encourages a mutual sense of belonging among fans and players.\n* Responsibility\n** Towards the cultural identity of the club, the place it belongs to and its fans.\n* Sportsmanship\n** Ensuring that the sporting spirit of the game always prevails and that the equality between participants is protected.\n* Respect\n** For all fans, whose passion is the raw material that enriches football.\nWinners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Edition\n!colspan=\"3\"|One Club Man\n!colspan=\"3\"|One Club Woman\n|-\n!Player\n!Club\n!Period\n!Player\n!Club\n!Period\n|-\n|2015\n| Matt Le Tissier\n| Southampton\n|\n(17 seasons)\n| colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Not awarded\n|-\n|2016\n| Paolo Maldini\n| Milan\n|1984–2009\n(25 seasons)\n|-\n|2017\n| Sepp Maier\n| Bayern Munich\n|1966–1979\n(13 seasons)\n|-\n|2018\n| Carles Puyol\n| Barcelona\n|1999–2014\n(15 seasons)\n|-\n|2019\n| Billy McNeill\n| Celtic\n|1957–1975\n(18 seasons)\n| Malin Moström\n| Umeå IK\n|\n(12 seasons)\n|-\n|2020\n| Ryan Giggs\n| Manchester United\n|1991–2014\n(23 seasons)\n| Pia Wunderlich\n| FFC Frankfurt\n|1993–2009\n(16 seasons)\n|-\n|2021\n|colspan=6|Not awarded due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain\n|-\n|2022\n| Ricardo Bochini\n| Independiente\n|1972–1991\n(19 seasons)\n| Jennifer Zietz\n| Turbine Potsdam\n|1998–2015\n(17 seasons)\n|-\n|2023\n| João Pinto\n| Porto\n|1981–1997\n(16 seasons)\n| Matilde Martínez\n| Fundación Albacete\n|2009–20192021–2022\n(12 seasons)\n|-\n|2024\n| Giuseppe Bergomi\n| Inter Milan\n|1979–1999\n(21 seasons)\n| Maria Gstöttner\n| SV Neulengbach\n|1998–2022\n(24 seasons)\n|-\n|2025\n| Jamie Carragher\n| Liverpool\n|1996–2013\n(17 seasons)\n| Joelle Murray\n| Hibernian\n|1994&ndash;2024\n(20 seasons)\n|-\n|}\nSee also\n* List of one-club men in association football\nReferences"
