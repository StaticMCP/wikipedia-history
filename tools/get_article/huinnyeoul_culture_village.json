In 2010, many local artists took efforts to remodel the area. Murals were painted, houses remodeled, and Huinnyeoul turned into a small village.\nName\nIt is nicknamed Korea's Santorini. Huinnyeoul Munhwa Maeul got its name from the white water bubbles that the streams coming from the mountain Bognaesan created when they reached the ocean in front of Yeongdo.\nSee also\n* Gamcheon Culture Village\n* Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time\nReferences"
