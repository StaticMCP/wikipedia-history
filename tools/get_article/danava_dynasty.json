These rulers are mentioned in the Kalika Purana but there are no archaeological evidence to support this.\nThe Danava dynasty consisted of Kirata chiefs; the last of whom, Ghatakasura, was killed and replaced by Naraka.\nChronology\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!Nu.!!
