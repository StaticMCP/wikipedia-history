With the end of the Cold War the naval threat from the Soviet Union disappeared and the new submarine class was deemed unnecessary. The project lay dormant for years until the mid-2000s when the need for a replacement for the  became apparent.  Originally the Scandinavian countries had intended to collaborate on the , but Denmark's withdrawal from submarine operations meant that Kockums proceeded on their own.\nIn February 2014, the project was cancelled because of disagreements between Kockums's new German owners, ThyssenKrupp, and the Swedish government.  ThyssenKrupp refused to send a complete offer to any potential buyer and demanded that each buyer pay for the entire development rather than sharing the cost. The cancellation resulted in the Kockums equipment repossession incident on 8 April 2014. As per protocol, the Swedish government repossessed all equipment belonging to Defence Materiel Administration (Sweden), as well as all secret blueprints and images, using an armed escort. By orders from a manager, Kockums staff tried to sabotage the repossession by locking the gates with the repossession crew and escort still inside.\nOn 18 March 2015, Maritime Today reported that the project was restarted after the Swedish government placed a formal order for two A26 submarines for a maximum total cost of SEK 8.2 bn (approximately US$945 million as of 18 March 2015). According to the article, a Letter of Intent (LOI) had earlier been signed by Saab and FMV (The Swedish Defence Material Administration) in June 2014 regarding the Swedish Armed Forces’ underwater capability for the period 2015–2024. Saab has since acquired Kockums. The order in question for the two A26 submarines has been placed with what is now \"Saab Kockums.\" These were to be delivered no later than 2022, a date subsequently pushed back, initially to 2024–25 and subsequently even further to 2027–28. In October 2025, the delivery date was announced to be pushed back further to 2031 and 2033.\nHistory\nOn 25 February 2010, Kockums AB signed a contract with the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) concerning the overall design phase of the next-generation submarine. Kockums CEO, Ola Alfredsson, stated \"This is an important first step, not only for Kockums, but for the Swedish Armed Forces as a whole. We shall now be able to maintain our position at the cutting edge of submarine technology, which is vital in the light of current threat scenarios.\"\nOn 11 April 2010, the Swedish Defence minister Sten Tolgfors announced plans to acquire two new submarines to be commissioned in 2018–19 replacing the two submarines of the . The plans also included a Mid-Life Upgrade program of two submarines of the Gotland class. Additional submarines could later be ordered to replace the Gotland class, however this will not be decided before 2020.\nOn 16 June 2010, the Swedish Parliament authorised the government to procure two new submarines. Kockums states that construction of two A26 submarines will generate about 170 jobs.\nThe first submarine was planned to be laid down by the end of 2012, but as of 2013, no submarines have yet been ordered. In September 2013 it was announced that the project had been delayed because of construction issues and the first submarine would not be ready before 2020.\nOrder cancelled and alternatives\nOn 27 February 2014, the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) cancelled its plans to order the A26 submarine from Kockums. According to FMV the new Kockums owner, the German company Thyssen Krupp has refused to allow Sweden to share the cost with any other nation, making the submarine too expensive.  Sweden has instead approached Saab. Saab plans to rehire many of Kockums submarine engineers if they receive orders for a new submarine. As a result, Saab recruited top people from Kockums and issued a press release that the company was seeking employees for its naval division.  In a letter to the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, FMV, the head of the German ThyssenKrupp Marine Division, Dr. Hans Atzpodien begs FMV to stop Saab from recruiting key personnel from Kockums. On 2 April 2014 the Swedish government officially terminated all talks about a deal with ThyssenKrupp.\nOn 14 April 2014, about 200 employees had left Thyssen Krupp for Saab and it was reported that Saab and Thyssen Krupp had started to negotiate about selling Kockums. In June 2014 Thyssen Krupp agreed to sell Kockums to Saab.\nOn 22 July 2014, it was announced that Saab had bought Kockums from Thyssen Krupp for 340 million SEK. The new name will be Saab Kockums.\nSwedish purchase\nIn June 2015, as the Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist was visiting the facilities of Saab Kockums, it was announced that two contracts were signed, one including the MLU of two submarines of the s, and the other for the purchase of two submarines, worth SEK 8.2 billion (USD $ }}). Back in 2015, the plan was to deliver the two ships in 2022 and in 2024.\nIn January 2019, the FMV announced that the submarines would be delivered in 2024 and 2025.\nIn August 2021, the FMV and Saab renegotiated the contract as the costs rose, and the programme was seeing schedule slips. This new agreement included as well capabilities improvements. The order for the pursuit of the development and the production of the two A26 reached SEK 5.2 billion (USD $600 million) for a total cost between the first and second agreement of 14 billion (2021 price level). The delivery was then planned for 2027 and 2028.\nIn October 2025, a new agreement was made between the FMV and Saab. This new agreement has a new timeline with deliveries in 2031 and 2033, and a fixed cost ceiling of SEK 25 billion.\nDesign\nInitial design\nThe new submarine project was intended to be an improved version of the , which will be considered obsolete around 2015–2017 according to Per Skantz, development co-ordinator at the Marine headquarters in Stockholm. The submarine would displace 1,900 tonnes and have a crew complement of between 17 and 31 men. The 2008–2010 military budget memorandum to the Minister for Defence by the Supreme Commander, Håkan Syrén, would require the type to cost no more than the current Gotland-class (about SEK1.5 billion). The new submarine would have blue water capability, something earlier Swedish submarines have lacked. It will be equipped with modified AIP stirling propulsion and GHOST (Genuine HOlistic STealth) technology, making the submarine extremely quiet. It will also be designed to withstand significant shock loads from underwater explosions and would be able to \"launch and recover vehicles\" through its torpedo tubes. The submarine's sail would largely be composed of the same material that was used when constructing the s.\nSwedish design updated\nPropulsion\nThe A26 Blekinge will be equipped with the fifth generation of the Saab Kockums AIP (Stirling engine), the Kockums MkV V4-275R.\nWeapon systems\nSaab will implement the \"Autonomous Ocean Core\" an AI system of systems that will support the crew in:\n* navigation\n* sensor fusion\n* electronic warfare\n* synchronise / operate the unmanned systems in coordination with the crewed systems.\nSensors\nThe first sensor ordered was the Safran Series 30 SOM (Search Optronic Mast). This mast was already ordered as part of the Gotland-class MLU.\nShip on-bord systems\nThe company FAMOR S.A. will supply consoles for the ships of the class. These consoles will be used to operate the ships, and are separate from the weapon system.\nWeapons\nThe main weapon will be the torpedoes:\n* 4 ×  torpedo tubes that will use the Torped 62 steg 2, and the .\n* 2 ×  torpedo tubes that will use the Torped 47 (Saab SLWT).\nVariants for export\nSaab Kockums offers three variants with different sizes and expected roles:\n* Pelagic\n* Oceanic\n* Oceanic (Extended Range)\nThe entire Blekinge-class submarine family has been offered for export, equipped with 18 vertical launch cells for Tomahawk cruise missiles. The VLS would be an added module to the submarine\nBoats\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; font-size: 92%;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |Name\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |No.\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |Status\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |Contract\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |Keel laid down\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |Launched\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |Comm.\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |Homeport\n! style=\"text-align: left\" |Notes\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|'HSwMS Blekinge\n|—\n|Under construction\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |–\n| style=\"background: #CEF2E0\" |\n|\n|\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|HSwMS Skåne'\n|—\n|Under construction\n|\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |–\n| style=\"background: #CEF2E0\" |\n|\n|\n|}\nExport\nPotential clients\nGreece\nIn May 2025, the Hellenic Navy outlined the expectations for a new generation of submarines. In July 2025, Greece formalised a 12-year modernisation plan worth US$25 billion. This includes the start of a formal process to acquire four submarines to replace its oldest four submarines, 1 Glavkos class (Type 209/1100) and 3 Poseidon class (Type 209/1200).\nThe known competitors for this programme include:\n* s (Naval group)\n* KSS-III Batch II class (Hanwha Ocean / HD Hyundai Heavy Industries)\n* s (Naval group)\n* Type 209NG class (TKMS)\n* Type 212CD class (TKMS)\n* Type 218 class (TKMS)\n* U212 NFS class (Fincantieri / TKMS)\nPoland\nThe Polish Navy is replacing its Orzeł submarine with the Orka programme which was restarted in 2023.\nThe competitors for this programme include:\n* A26 Blekinge class (Saab Kockums)\n* HDS 2300 class (Hanwha Ocean / HD Hyundai Heavy Industries)\n* KSS-III PL class (Hanwha Ocean / HD Hyundai Heavy Industries)\n* s (Naval group)\n* s (Navantia)\n* Type 212CD class (TKMS)\n* U212 NFS class (Fincantieri / TKMS)\nFailed bids\nAustralia\nOn 12 September 2014, Saab Kockums proposed a 4,000-ton variant of the submarine, known as the Type 612, for the Royal Australian Navy to replace their ageing s. The DCNS (now Naval Group) offer based on the  was selected instead, however this deal was later rescinded.\nCanada\nA derivative of the Blekinge, the C-71 Expeditionary submarine was offered to the Canadian Navy, but two submarines were pre-selected, the Type 212CD, and the South Korean submarine KSS III. This submarine was offered by a collaboration of Saab and Damen.\nNetherlands\nIn December 2014 an agreement was announced by Saab and Damen Shipyards for the joint development of the next-generation of submarines, based on the Type 612 desig).\nThis cooperation was Initially focused on replacing the four s currently in use by the Royal Netherlands Navy. But in March 2024, the Netherlands selected the s from Naval Group. TKMS, the other competitor in the programme objected in court against the selection of the Barracuda, but the court upheld the decision of the Ministry of Defence (July 2024). The contract for the purchase of the four submarines was signed in September 2024.\nNorway\nThe Royal Norwegian Navy had shown interest in the project, but ended up ordering the Type 212CD submarine from ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.\nSee also\n* Type 212 submarine - A class of diesel-electric attack-submarines developed by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and exclusively built for the German Navy, the Italian Navy and the Royal Norwegian Navy.\n* Type 214 submarine - A class of export-oriented diesel-electric attack submarines, also developed by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and currently operated by the Hellenic Navy, the Portuguese Navy, the Republic of Korea Navy and the Turkish Naval Forces.\n* Type 218SG submarine - A class of extensively customised diesel-electric attack submarines developed by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and currently operated by the Republic of Singapore Navy.\n*  - A class of extensively customised diesel-electric attack submarines developed by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and currently operated by Israel.\n*  - A unique class of diesel-electric attack submarines developed by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and currently being built for Israel.\n*  - A class of export-oriented diesel-electric attack-submarines, jointly developed by Naval Group and Navantia and currently operated by the Chilean Navy, the Royal Malaysian Navy, the Indian Navy and the Brazilian Navy.\n* S-80 Plus submarine - A class of conventionally-powered attack submarines, currently being built by Navantia for the Spanish Navy.\n* KSS-III submarine - A class of diesel-electric attack and ballistic missile submarines, built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering and Hyundai Heavy Industries and operated by the Republic of Korea Navy.\n*  - A class of diesel-electric attack-submarines, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.\n*  - A class of diesel-electric attack submarines currently being built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force\n* Type 039A submarine - A class of diesel-electric attack submarines operated by the People's Liberation Army Navy (China) and is built for the navies of the Royal Thai Navy and the Pakistan Navy.\n*  - A class of diesel-electric attack-submarines being built for the Russian Navy.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://www.saab.com/products/naval/submarines The A26 Submarine on Saab Kockums's official website]\n* [https://www.naval-technology.com/news/saab-and-fmv-develop-underwater-capabilities-ahead-of-a26-submarine-construction Saab and FMV develop underwater capabilities ahead of A26 submarine construction - Naval Technology]"
