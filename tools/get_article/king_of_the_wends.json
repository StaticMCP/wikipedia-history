It was used from the 12th century to 1972 by the kings of Denmark and from  1540 to 1973 by the kings of Sweden.\nEtymology\nThe generally accepted interpretation is that King of the Wends (; ; ) refers to the Wends, West Slavic peoples that lived on the south shores of the Baltic Sea. The situation is further complicated by the existence of the Vends, located between the Finns and the Wends and with somewhat unknown origin. One poetic explanation of the title was kingship over the Vandals (), but that idea came only in the 16th century. A recent interpretation, not much supported in academic research, has been made that the part \"Vend\" in the later established titles of the kings of Sweden (three kingdoms: King of the Svear, Götar and Vends; ) means Finland, the form presumably being akin to winds, \"vind\". As such, the Österland—the medieval name for the Finnish part of the Swedish kingdom—was the third part of the realm. However, only forty years after the adoption of the title \"king of the Wends\", the Swedish kings began to style themselves as grand dukes of Finland as well.\nIn Germanic languages, the name was Wends, and in medieval documentation the Latin name was , referring to the Slavic peoples in and around the region now known as Mecklenburg. In the 16th century, Latin  was changed to  also by Danish kings, showing the new poetic idea.\nIn Denmark,  ('King of Denmark, of the Wends and of the Goths') was part of the monarch's official style until the accession in 1972 of Queen Margrethe II.\nIn Sweden,  ('King of Sweden, the Goths and the Wends') was used in official documentation up to the accession in 1973, of Carl XVI Gustaf.\nHistory\nMonarchs of Denmark bore the title for eight centuries, after it was first adopted by King Canute VI (reigned 1182 to 1202), who conquered the lands of the Wends in Pomerania and Mecklenburg. The Danish kings continued to use the title over the next seven hundred years until 1972, when Queen Margrethe II succeeded. She abandoned the use of all the royal titles except for that of ''Denmark's King/Queen'', which is the royal style today.\nThe first Swedish king to use the title was Karl Knutsson. He had attempted to be elected King of the Kalmar Union, which united Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Although unsuccessful, he continued to use the Danish royal titles until his death.\nWhen Sweden had made its final breakaway from the Kalmar Union, tensions between the rulers of Denmark and Sweden were high, and it showed also in their flags, coat-of-arms and titles. Gustav I of Sweden adopted  1540 the third \"kingdom\" to his titles, which had only included Sweden and the Goths (, ).  ('King of Sweden, the Goths and the Wends') was used in official documentation up to the accession in 1973, of Carl XVI Gustaf, who was the first monarch to be proclaimed  (\"King of Sweden\") and nothing else.\nSee also\n* King of the Goths\n* King of the Slavs\nNotes\nReferences"
