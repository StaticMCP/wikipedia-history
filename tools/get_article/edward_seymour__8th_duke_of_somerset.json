They had at least five children. His first cousin was Francis Seymour, 1st Marquess of Hertford, son of his uncle Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Baron Conway\nInheritance and titles\nIn December 1740, his father died and Seymour inherited his manors in Wiltshire and Devon. On 11 September 1744, with the unexpected death of George Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp (1725–1744), the only son of Algernon Seymour, Earl of Hertford, himself son and heir of Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset, the likelihood emerged of Seymour succeeding his distant cousin as Duke of Somerset and Baron Seymour, as the future 7th Duke was then aged sixty, and his wife was past child-bearing age. On 23 November 1750, the Duke died, and Seymour duly succeeded to his titles. However, he inherited little of the great wealth enjoyed by his two immediate predecessors, as the 7th Duke had arranged for the principal Percy family estates and houses of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland House, Petworth House, and Syon House to be divided between his daughter Elizabeth and his nephew Charles Wyndham. As a result, the Dukes of Somerset were never again among the greatest landowning families.\nProgeny\nSeymour's children were all born long before the dukedom came to him:\n*Edward Seymour, 9th Duke of Somerset (2 January 1717 &ndash; 2 January 1792)\n*Webb Seymour, 10th Duke of Somerset (3 December 1718 &ndash; 15 December 1793)\n*Lord William Seymour (1724 &ndash; 5 November 1800), m. 5 June 1767 Hester Maltravers (d.
