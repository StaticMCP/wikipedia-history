The family has produced numerous members who served in parliamentary bodies from the era of Muhammad Ali through the 1952 revolution, particularly representing the Qalyubia region, and has left a significant architectural legacy in downtown Cairo.\nHistory\nOrigins\nFamily traditions trace their lineage to the Banu Jurhum tribe of the Hejaz. According to historical accounts, their ancestors migrated to Egypt during the Islamic conquest under Amr ibn al-As in the 7th century. The family identifies as descending from \"Al-Shawarbi the Great,\" described as a Qurayshite Arab from the Jurhum tribe.\nInitial settlements were established in the Shubra district of Cairo, followed by relocation to the strategic commercial area of \"Qanater (Al Manja),\" before the family ultimately established its primary base in Qalyub, Qalyubia Governorate.\nMamluk era\nA significant event in family tradition involves an encounter with Mamluk Sultan Al-Zahir Baybars. According to accounts, when the Sultan stayed with them incognito during his travels, they provided him hospitality. After his departure, a family member discovered and returned a money pouch Baybars had left behind. Impressed by this honesty, Baybars granted the family honors and land holdings in Qalyubia, Monufia, and Sharqia provinces. This narrative is supported by 19th-century historian Ali Pasha Mubarak in his work Al-Khitat al-Tawfiqiyya al-Jadida.\nFrench campaign resistance\nDuring the French campaign in Egypt (1798-1801), family member Suleiman al-Shawarbi organized peasant militias against the French forces. After military engagements and subsequent negotiations, al-Shawarbi was captured and executed by hanging on the same day as Suleiman al-Halabi, assassin of French General Jean-Baptiste Kléber.\nModern era\nThe family supported the 1919 Revolution against British occupation. Historical documents indicate continued nationalist activities during the 1956 Suez Crisis, when the wife of Abdul Hamid al-Shawarbi was reportedly tasked by President Gamal Abdel Nasser with smuggling funds to resistance fighters in Port Said, successfully evading French inspection.\nLegacy\nThe family's influence is memorialized in downtown Cairo through Al-Shawarby Street, a major thoroughfare named in their honor that has become one of the most well-known streets in the area. The street is notably home to the historic Shawarby Pasha Building, an architectural landmark that bears the family name and stands as a testament to their historical prominence in Cairo.\nMuhammad Pasha al-Shawarbi was known for his philanthropic works, including establishing Qalyub Hospital, building a grand mosque at Qalyub Station, and creating charitable endowments (waqf).\nNotable members\n* Harun Bey al-Shawarbi – Family notable\n* Sheikh Salim Bey al-Shawarbi – Shura Council member (1870-1873)\n* Al-Hajj Nasr Mansour al-Shawarbi – Member of the Shura Council of Deputies (1866), representing Qalyub.\n* Muhammad Pasha al-Shawarbi (1841-?) – Full name Mohamed Salem ibn Mansour ibn Mohamed ibn Ibrahim.

He compared his position unfavorably to that of Ahmed Abboud Pasha, the wealthy president of Al-Ahly Club. Realizing that the presidency of Zamalek was a losing deal in his view, he stepped down, saying he was a man of business and figures, not one to chase mere social prestige.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.elaosboa.com/272412/ Al-Usbu' article on the Al-Shawarbi family] (in Arabic)\n* [https://www.hindawi.org/books/52483961/37/ Hindawi Foundation biography of Muhammad Pasha al-Shawarbi] (in Arabic)\n* [https://www.gomhuriaonline.com/Gomhuria/942864.html Article about Al-Shawarby Street] (in Arabic)\n* [https://www.mobtada.com/cases/515368/150-سنة-برلمان-مجلس-العائلات-7 Mobtada article on 150 years of parliament] (in Arabic)\n* [https://www.albawabhnews.com/2876939 Albawabh News article on the Al-Shawarbi family] (in Arabic)\n* [https://m.youm7.com/story/2023/9/23/سعيد-الشحات-يكتب-ذات-يوم-23-سبتمبر-1894-استقالة-رئيس/6312638 Youm7 article on parliamentary history] (in Arabic)"
