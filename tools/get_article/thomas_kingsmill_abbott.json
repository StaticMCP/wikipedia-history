He was elected a scholar in 1848, graduated in 1851 as a senior moderator in mathematics and was made a fellow of the college in 1854. He obtained an M.A. and a D.Litt. (1891) from Trinity, and was ordained a minister in the Church of Ireland.\nIn 1852 he solved a geometrical problem posed by J. J. Sylvester.\nHe occupied the chair of moral philosophy (1867–72), of biblical Greek (1875–88), and of Hebrew (1879–1900). In 1887 he was elected librarian in Trinity and, in 1900, completed catalogues of the library's manuscript holdings. He became a senior fellow in 1897. He was one of a group of Irish scholars, including J. P. Mahaffy, who made significant contributions to the dissemination and study of the works of Immanuel Kant. His translation of Kant's Critique of Practical Reason remained the standard English version of the text well into the 20th century.\nIn June 1901, he received an honorary doctorate in Divinity from the University of Glasgow.\nIn 1859 he married Caroline Kingsmill, eldest daughter of the penologist Rev. Joseph Kingsmill.\nHe died in Killiney in Dublin on 18 December 1913.\nSelect bibliography\n* [https://archive.org/stream/hermathena20irelgoog#page/n260/mode/2up On a Greek Biblical Fragment] Hermathena vol.
