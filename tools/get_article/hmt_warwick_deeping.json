The two British ships soon found themselves under fire, and Listrac, believing that the German ships were Royal Navy vessels attacking in error switched on her identification lights. She was promptly shelled, causing a large explosion aboard, and then torpedoed and sunk, with the loss of her captain and 11 men. The Warwick Deeping attempted to escape, but was relentlessly attacked, and hit by a torpedo, which failed to explode. She was hit several times by shells, one of which finally disabled her engines. Now helpless and sinking, the crew abandoned the ship, but instead of delivering the coup de grace the German torpedo boats unexpectedly broke off their attack and sailed away. An hour later all 22 crew were rescued.\nThe Warwick Deeping lies in  of water at  and is a popular wreck diving site.\nSee also\n* Trawlers of the Royal Navy\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*\n*"
