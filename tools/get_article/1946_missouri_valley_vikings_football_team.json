In their seventh season under head coach Volney Ashford, the Vikings compiled a perfect 10–0 record (4–0 against MCAU teams), won the MCAU championship, shut out five of ten opponents, and outscored all opponents by a total of 387 to 33.\nThe season was part of a 41-game winning streak (1941–1942, 1946–1948) that still ranks as the fifth longest in college football history. Coach Ashford, who led the team during the streak, was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\nMissouri Valley halfback Alva Baker ranked seventh nationally in scoring among small-college players with 84 points scored. Eleven Missouri Valley players received honors from the Associated Press (AP) on the All-MCAU football team, six on the first team and five on the second team. The honorees included Alva Baker at halfback (AP-1); Ted Chittwood at end (AP-1); Jim Nelson (AP-1) and Verlie Harris (AP-1) at the guard position; Bill Klein at center (AP-2).\nMissouri Valley's roster also included back Hugh C. Dunn, who lost his left hand due to injuries suffered in a German mortar attack during World War II.\nDuring the fall of 1946, Missouri Valley College had only 513 students, 322 of which were freshmen.\nSchedule\n||Marshall, MO|W 37-0||\n|September 26||Chillicothe Business College||Marshall, MO|W 65-0||\n|October 4||Simpson|||W 34-6||\n|October 11|at|||Tarkio, MO|W 27-0||\n|October 18|at|||Liberty, MO|W 47-7||\n|October 25||||Marshall, MO|W 39-0||\n|November 1||||Marshall, MO|W 25-7||\n|November 8||||Canton, MO|W 47-0||\n|November 15||McPherson||Marshall, MO|W 32-6||\n|November 22||||Marshall, MO|W 34-7|2,500|\n}}\nNotes\nReferences"
