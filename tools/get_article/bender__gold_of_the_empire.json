It was theatrically released in Russia on 15 July 2021.\nThe film tells the story of how Ibrahim Bender and his student Ostap suddenly lose a precious treasure and it falls into the hands of Nestor Makhno, who is sure that there are other relics in the vicinity. As a result, reds, whites, bandits and partisans start hunting for gold.\nPlot\nSet against the backdrop of the Russian Civil War in 1919 in the South of Russia, the film follows the pursuit of a missing imperial relic, the scepter of Pyotr Rumyantsev, which has disappeared during transportation. Lev Trotsky, Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council, faces the risk of losing vital arms supplies unless the artifact is recovered. He tasks Grigory Kotovsky with finding and returning the scepter.\nSimultaneously, the relic is sought by young adventurer Ostap Bender and his mentor, the seasoned con artist Ibrahim Bender. The scepter is hidden in the home of undertaker Mark Sagalovich, who plans to marry off his daughter, Sonya, to the notorious bandit Mishka Yaponchik against her will. Disguised as Orthodox Jews, Ostap and Ibrahim infiltrate the wedding to retrieve the artifact. However, their plan is thwarted when leftist anarchist Nestor Makhno crashes the wedding and steals the scepter.\nKotovsky, now allied with the bandit Tarasevich, captures Bender and Zadunaisky to use them as leverage to infiltrate Makhno’s camp.\nCast\n* Sergey Bezrukov as Ibrahim Suleiman Berta-Maria Bender-Bey\n* Aram Vardevanyan as Osip \"Osya\" Zadunaisky (Ostap Bender-Zadunaisky)\n* Nikita Kologrivyy as Mishka Yaponchik\n* Yuliya Makarova as Sofi Sokolovich\n* Vera Brezhneva as Robber\n* Yuri Kolokolnikov as Grigory Kotovsky\n* Pavel Derevyanko as Nestor Makhno\n* Aleksandr Tsekalo as Mark Sokolovich\n* Yuliya Rutberg as Madame Sokolovich\n* Olga Sutulova as Maria Zadunaiskaya, Osip Zadunaisky's mother\n* Artyom Tkachenko as Staff captain Mishin-Ametistov\nProduction\nThe film is slated to be merged with the prequel, Bender: The Beginning, and the sequel, Bender: The Final Hustle, to be released as a TV series.\nSee also\n* Bender: The Beginning – Part 1 (2021 film)\n* Bender: The Final Hustle – Part 3 (2021 film)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
