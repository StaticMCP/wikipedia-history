The contest was held alongside primaries in Delaware, New York, and Wisconsin.\nEven though Trump cruised to victory, he showed a poorer result as compared to his performance in 2020 (albeit as a non-incumbent), getting almost 3% fewer votes. Conversely, Nikki Haley crossed the 10% threshold, recording her best results in the suburban town of Barrington, which Donald Trump lost in the 2016 primary and the island town of New Shoreham.\nPolling\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-datatable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!

Having officially run unopposed both times, he recorded poorer results in 2024 in all but two towns.\nSee also\n* 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries\n* 2024 United States presidential election\n* 2024 United States presidential election in Rhode Island\n* 2024 United States elections\nNotes\nReferences"
