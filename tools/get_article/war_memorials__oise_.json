From October 1914 to March 1917 the front had stabilised along a line passing through Lassigny, Tracy-le-Val and Bailly and during two years of occupation the German army lived in the towns and villages of the Noyon area.\nIn March 1917, in a tactical move, the Germans left the region as they moved north to the Hindenburg Line but they left much destruction in their wake. The areas which they vacated were then occupied by the Allied armies.  1918 saw the German \"Spring Offensive\" when the German army retook the area they had vacated and advanced even further. There were battles fought at Noyon and Mont Renaud in March and April 1918 and at Matz in June 1918, during the Third Battle of the Aisne. Further ferocious battles were fought until August 1918 when Montdidier and the Thiescourt were liberated. All of these efforts helped to stop the German advance on Paris and assisted the Allied success in pushing the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line in the summer and autumn.\nApart from the usual trench based skirmishes, the area around the front line suffered much damage and loss of life from constant artillery bombardment and bombing by Zeppelin airships and German aeroplanes. Great devastation was wrought in villages directly on the front line.  Ribecourt, Tracy-le-Val, Bailly, Chiry-Ourscamp, and Dreslincourt were almost totally destroyed. Compiègne and Noyon suffered much damage. One German long-range gun in particular, stationed in the forest at Coucy-le-Chateau, caused much devastation. The bombing reached as far as Beauvais where in June 1918, 36 soldiers and civilians were killed. Breteuil, Crèvecœur-le-Grand and Crépy-en-Valois were all hit by bombs.  Finally, the Armistice was signed at Rethondes on 11 November 1918\nSome of the Monument aux Morts in the Oise\nBelow are details of just some of the many monuments aux morts in the Oise region.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:200px\" |Work\n! style=\"width:100px\" class=\"sortable\"|Image\n! style=\"width:200px\" |Location\n! style=\"width:60px\"  |Date(s)\n! style=\"width:550px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Subject, notes and references\n|-\n|Monument aux Morts at Antheuil-Portes\n|\n|Antheuil-Portes.

The plaster model of this work, entitled ''\"je t'ai cherché\"'' was exhibited at the Salon des Artistes Française in 1920 and there are several examples of the work in monuments throughout France.  It was said that the likeness of the soldier was based on Charles Eudes, one of Maxime Real del Sarte's comrades at the front.  Maxime Real Del Sarte was recommended as the sculptor for the Ressons-sur-Matz war memorial by the writer Binet-Valmer who had taken part in the liberation of the village in 1918.

The soldier on the right was supposedly based on Quentin Roosevelt, the nephew of Theodore Roosevelt who was killed near Cambrai on 14 July 1918, and the soldier on the left was said to be based on Maxime Real del Sarte's brother, killed in the Champagne during the war.  Del Sarte himself was injured fighting in the Éparges section of the Verdun front on 29 January 1916 and part of his left arm had to be amputated.  The monument remembers the efforts of the French army units who fought in the area.\n|-\n|Monument aux Morts at Saint-Samson-la-Poterie\n|\n|Saint-Samson-la-Poterie\n|1921\n|The relief on the Saint-Samson-la-Poterie war memorial is by Louis Maubert. It is dated 1921 and was inaugurated on 9 October 1921. The design and model of the relief was made in 1916 when it first became obvious that a monument was going to be needed by each and every community. The organisation \"Souvenir Français\" intended that this design to be the \"official\" monument, but the work was subject to criticism and the concept of a monopoly for war memorials was unpopular. This work was marketed by Établissements Hubert Coignet et Cie of Gennevilliers in Hauts-de-Seine. Amongst Maubert's other works are the monument commemorating Leon Chiris in Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes and a bas-relief on the tomb of Montaud Deluns in Clamart, Hauts-de-Seine.
