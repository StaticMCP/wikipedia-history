Once he earned the starting spot in 1984, he rewarded his team with a .36 GAA.

He would spend the year both on the bench and in the nets as a player-coach.  The Kick collapsed at the end of the season and in July 1990, the Atlanta Attack selected Lipka in the dispersal draft.  He also spent time in trials with the San Diego Sockers before signing with the Detroit Rockers of the NPSL in November 1990.  He was an NPSL All Star that season.\nCoaching\nLipka began his coaching career while playing for the Flames.  In 1987, he joined Bishop Dwenger High School as the boys' soccer team assistant coach.  He stayed with the team until 1990.  In 1989, he served as the head coach of the Tri-State University women's soccer team.  That year he also became the general manager and head coach of the indoor soccer Indiana Kick of the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL).\nIn 1991, the University of Kentucky hired Lipka as its men's soccer team assistant coach.  The next season, the university hired him as the women's soccer team head coach, the first women's soccer coach in the school's history.  He was the SEC coach of the year in 1995, 1999 and 2006.\nIn 2003, United States Soccer Federation hired Lipka as the goalkeeper coach of the U.S. U-19 women's national team, a position he held through 2003 and 2004.  In 2004, the U-19 team took third place at the U-19 World Cup.  In 2004, he also served as the goalkeeper coach for the U.S. U-21 women's national team at the Nordic Cup, which the U.S. won for the fifth consecutive time.\nHe has also coached various Olympic Development Program teams as well as youth soccer clubs and camps.\nLipka served as the head coach for the Morehead State Eagles women's soccer team from 2009 to 2021.
