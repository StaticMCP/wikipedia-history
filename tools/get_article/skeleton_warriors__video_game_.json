It is based on the animated television series of the same name.\nGameplay\nSkeleton Warriors uses 2-dimensional side-scrolling gameplay that combines both beat 'em up and platforming elements, along with occasional hovering motorcycle driving levels. The game uses a mix of pre-rendered sprites with polygonal backgrounds, and fully 3D rendered graphics.\nReception\nNext Generation reviewed the Saturn version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"in the end, if you simply can't get enough of side-scrolling action games, then you can count on this being one of the best\".\nIGN rated the PlayStation version 5/10, saying, \"The game looks great... The control is well balanced and executed... Unfortunately, the very nature of the game ensures that it grows tedious real fast.\"\nReviews\n*GameFan #38 (vol. 4, issue 2) - February 1996\n*GamePro - April 1996\n*Video Games & Computer Entertainment - March 1996\n*Game Revolution - June 6, 2004\n*NowGamer - September 1, 1996\n*IGN - November 25, 1996\n*All Game Guide - 1998\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/saturn/574588-skeleton-warriors Skeleton Warriors] at GameFAQs\n* [https://www.giantbomb.com/skeleton-warriors/3030-7168/ Skeleton Warriors] at Giant Bomb\n* [http://www.mobygames.com/game/skeleton-warriors Skeleton Warriors] at MobyGames"
