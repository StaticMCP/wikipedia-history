Warburton played rugby for Cardiff Rugby and was first capped for Wales in 2009. He usually played as an openside flanker but was also capable of playing at blindside.\nIn June 2011, Warburton captained Wales versus the Barbarians and, in August 2011, was named Wales captain for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In April 2013, he was chosen to be the Lions' captain for the 2013 tour to Australia and became captain for the 2017 Lions tour to New Zealand. Warburton holds the record for the most Wales caps as captain (49).\nIn July 2018, Warburton announced his retirement from rugby union at 29 years of age after failing to recover fully from neck and back surgery.\nEarly and personal life\nWarburton was born in Wales to English parents and he considers himself Welsh and British. He has an elder twin brother, Ben, who played at semi-professional level with Glamorgan Wanderers RFC and is now a physiotherapist for the Scarlets, and an older sister Holly, a schoolteacher. Their great-grandfather, George Reed, was a professional footballer who played 150 times for Leeds United in the 1920s and 1930s. He attended Whitchurch High School and left with three A Levels.\nAs a youngster Warburton was a keen football player and played for his school team alongside schoolmate Real Madrid and Wales forward Gareth Bale. He had a trial with local club Cardiff City at the age of 14 but chose to concentrate on rugby instead. He played on the junior teams of Rhiwbina RFC and played for Glamorgan Wanderers RFC whilst a member of the Cardiff Rugby Academy.\nOn 5 July 2014, Warburton married long term partner Rachel Thomas in a church ceremony in Newport, before the couple held a reception at the Celtic Manor Resort. He is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur FC.\nCareer\nWarburton represented Wales at all levels, captaining the under-18s, under-19s and under-20s. He led Wales to the semi-finals of the World Championships at under-19 and under-20 level. Warburton made his debut for the senior Wales national team against the United States on 6 June 2009.\nOn 18 January 2010, Warburton was named in the 35-man Wales squad for the 2010 Six Nations. He scored his first international try against Italy in the 2011 Six Nations. Warburton captained Wales for the first time against the Barbarians on 4 June 2011 at the age of 22 years and 242 days becoming Wales' second-youngest captain after Gareth Edwards. In a World Cup warm-up match against England, Warburton was named man of the match. In August 2011, he was named as captain for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand in the absence of the injured Matthew Rees.\n2011 Rugby World Cup\nIn the opening match of the tournament against South Africa, Warburton became the youngest World Cup captain. He was tasked with facing the South African openside flanker, Heinrich Brüssow (Brüssow was coming off/dealing with a string of injuries). While Wales lost 17–16, Warburton won man of the match, forcing five turnovers. Despite Warburton's efforts, Brüssow's counter-rucking allowed the Springboks to win possession from the Welsh in the final seconds of the game, allowing Fourie du Preez to kick the ball out for the victory.  Warburton continued his form in the match against Samoa, making numerous turnovers and 17 tackles as Wales won 17–10. Warburton played another good game against Namibia before being rested for the final half-hour in the 81–7 game. Wales then booked their place in the quarter-finals against Ireland with a 66–0 win over Fiji, in direct contrast to the loss of four years earlier. Warburton was again at the heart of the performance making some steals and some good runs, and also scoring his second test try. At the end of this remarkable few weeks, Warburton was then voted the Player of Pool D by the fans; he had taken the tournament by storm, making the highest number of turnovers.\nWales then met Ireland in the quarter-final as Warburton faced the in-form Irish openside flanker Seán O'Brien, in the 'battle of the opensides'. Wales reached the semi-final for the first time in 24 years with a 22–10 win, as Warburton continued his form, making 21 tackles and a number of turnovers, disrupting Ireland's ball. In the semi-final against an out-of-form France, Warburton became the second Wales player to receive a red card in a World Cup when he was sent off after 18 minutes by the Irish referee Alain Rolland for a dangerous tackle on Vincent Clerc. Warburton admitted the offence at a disciplinary hearing in Auckland, and stated to the press that the decision was fair.  However, he stated in his autobiography in 2019 that he actually considered that only a yellow card should have been awarded. Despite the sending off, the Guardian newspaper, Brynmor Williams and Sir Ian McGeechan, the Lions coach, named him player of the tournament.\n2012 Six Nations\nIn spite of the return of former captain Matthew Rees, Warburton retained the Wales captaincy for the 2012 Six Nations. However, the campaign was disrupted by injury. In the opening match against Ireland, Warburton went off injured at half-time with a dead leg, but Wales managed to win 23–21. He missed the 27–13 win over Scotland but returned for the Triple Crown decider against England. Wales won 19–12. Warburton was at his best making steals, carries, taking lineouts, but it was his try-saving tackle on Manu Tuilagi that caught the eye. The England centre seemed destined to score in the corner but Warburton launched himself low and grabbed his ankles to make a superb try-saver. As a result, he was awarded man of the match. However, he sustained a knee injury and missed the 24–3 win over Italy. He returned for the Grand Slam decider against France but was once again injured, this time his shoulder and was taken off at half-time. Wales prevailed though 16–9 to claim a Grand Slam. Warburton would then lift the trophy with one hand, since his other shoulder was in a sling. He later spoke of his guilt at going off at half-time and asked vice-captains Gethin Jenkins and Ryan Jones to share the raising of the trophy, but the veterans said it was his moment. The injury he sustained would rule him out for six weeks, returning in time for the Lions tour of Australia in June 2013.\n2015 Six Nations\nWarburton surpassed the record of 33 caps as Wales captain held by Ryan Jones against Ireland on 14 March 2015.\nBritish & Irish Lions\nWarburton was named as captain of a 37-man squad for the 2013 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia, making him the youngest ever Lions captain at the age of 24. Warburton was selected as captain in the first test in Brisbane, combining in the back row with Tom Croft and Jamie Heaslip. The Lions won 23–21 with Warburton topping the tackle count with 14. Warburton started the second test a week later. The Lions lost 16–15 and many considered the turning point to be when Warburton got injured and left the field. Warburton was magnificent at the breakdown preventing the Wallabies from having a platform. However, the hamstring injury he picked up in the second test meant Warburton was ruled out of the final, deciding test, with Alun Wyn Jones captaining the team to a 41–16 win and the Lions’ first series victory since 1997. After the match, Warburton and Jones raised the Tom Richards Cup together.\nIn April 2017, Warburton was selected by Warren Gatland to captain the Lions for the 2017 tour to New Zealand.\nInternational tries\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
