Under the leadership of John Rymill, the expedition spent two years in the Antarctic. The expedition determined that Graham Land was a peninsula. The expedition used a combination of traditional and modern practices in Antarctic exploration, using both dog teams and motor sledges as well as a single-engine de Havilland Fox Moth aircraft for exploration. Transportation to the Antarctic was in an elderly three-masted sailing ship christened the Penola, which had an unreliable auxiliary engine. Additional supplies were brought on the ship Discovery II.\nThe expedition was one of the last privately sponsored Antarctic missions, with only part of the cost covered by the UK government. Although the expedition had a very small budget, it was successful in its scientific objectives. Air survey photography and mapping was carried out for 1000 miles (1600&nbsp;km) of the Graham Land coast.\nAll sixteen members of the landing party received the Polar Medal. The participants of the BGLE included:\n* Duncan Carse who transferred onto the expedition ship at the Falkland Islands\n* Launcelot Fleming who later became Bishop of Portsmouth and later the Bishop of Norwich\n* Dr. Brian Birley Roberts, who later contributed to the drafting of the Antarctic Treaty\n* Edward W. Bingham, in charge of the expedition's sled dogs\n* Quintin Riley\n* Robert Ryder, who captained the Penola and later won the Victoria Cross in the St Nazaire Raid\nSee also\n* List of Antarctic expeditions\n* Noel Atherton\n* Discovery Investigations\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/expeditions/bgl/ Scott Polar Research Institute website - detailed description of the expedition]\n*[https://www.freezeframe.ac.uk/resources/expeditions/antarctic/british-graham-land-expedition-1934-37/british-graham-land-1934-37/ Freezeframe website - photographs from the expedition]\n*[https://archive.org/details/britishgrahamlan00brit/page/n13/mode/2up/ Internet Archive - BGLE Scientific Report vol 1 published by British Museum (Natural History)]"
