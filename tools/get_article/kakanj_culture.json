It appeared in Central Bosnia's town of Kakanj and covered periods dated from 6795–4900 BC.\nThe new dating made the culture's eponymous town of Kakanj the '''Europe's oldest continuously inhabitted settlement.\nHistory\nCentral Bosnia and areas in Sarajevo, Visoko, and Zenica basins were the main areas of first prehistoric populations in Europe, especially along the shores of the Bosna river.\nCentral Bosnia was later populated by other cultures, like the Starčevo. They are all based in a unique culture that is known as the Kakanj culture, as the first findings were at a site in the Obre settlement of Kakanj.\nOther known locations of the European original culture are sited at: Kakanj – Plandište, Papratnica; Visoko – Arnautovići, Okolište, and Tuk near Zavidovići. The Kakanj culture had strong influence on the development of the Butmir culture.\nIn what is now an obsolete view, Marija Gimbutas regarded the Kakanj culture as a local variant of the Starčevo, with elements of the Danilo group. The new dating has switched the chronology, making Kakanj the Europe's first culture'''.\nSettlements and artifacts\nThe excavated settlements were not uniform. The site in Obre included rectangular houses with 1 or 2 rooms, with foundations made of stone and clay loam walls. Stone tools were predominant, especially molded hatchets. Tools like spatulas and needles were made out of bones.\nThe pottery was versatile, coarse, and monochrome. The surface of the monochrome ceramics was well polished, as is in Butmir culture.\nThe shapes included vessels with tall hollow conical stems, alongside bowls with thicker rims and 4-foot rhytons. Plastic was poorly represented.\nSee also\n* Old Europe\n* Butmir culture\n* Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.academia.edu/7263663/Neolitik_Bliskog_Istoka_i_jugoisto%C4%8Dne_Europe Neolithic of Middle East and Southeastern Europe]  (in Bosnian)\n* [https://www.academia.edu/4401304/Analiza_prahistorijski_kerami%C4%8Dkih_ulomaka_sa_lokaliteta_Donje_Papratnice_-_Zagrebnice_kod_Kaknja Analysis of prehistoric ceramics at Donja Papratnica and Zagrebnice near Kakanj] (in Bosnian)\n* [https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/obre Obre]  encyclopedia.com\n* [https://ksckakanj.ba/artefakti-pronadeni-1954-godine-na-lokalitetu-plandista-vraceni-na-revers-u-muzej-kaknja/ Pictures of artefacts found at Plandište]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20200319213423/http://www.anubih.ba/godisnjak/god43/Godisnjak43-full.pdf New radiocarbon dates for the Neolithic period in Bosnia & Herzegovina]"
