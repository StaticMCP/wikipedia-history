Under Constantine's regency, Isabella married Philip. Philip's offensive behavior offended the Armenian who had him imprisoned and poisoned. Constantine then had Isabella marry his son Hethum. Isabella died 23 January 1252 and was buried in the monastery of Trazarg.\nEarly years\nIsabella was the only child of King Leo I by his second wife, Sibylla of Cyprus.  She was betrothed to Andrew, but the betrothal did not occur.\nKing Leo I died on May, 1219. At this juncture, Raymond-Roupen, grandson of Roupen III, attempted to claim the throne of Cilicia for himself, but he was defeated, captured, and executed. Isabella was proclaimed queen, under the regency of Adam of Baghras. After Adam of Baghras was assassinated, Constantine of Baberon was nominated as guardian. Regent Constantine arranged the marriage between Isabella and Philip in 1222. Philip, however, offended the Armenians' sensibilities, and even despoiled the royal palace, sending the royal crown to Antioch. The Armenians had him imprisoned at Sis and later poisoned.\nWife of Hethum of Barbaron\n, 1909]]\nIn 1226, Isabella married Hethum, son of Constantine, her regent. The marriage was legalized by Rome in 1237. There is evidence that Isabella shared a degree of royal power, for we learn from several sources that she co-signed with her husband an official deed transferring to the Knights of the Teutonic Order the strategic castle and town of Haronie. She was buried in the monastery of Trazarg.\nMarriages and children\nIsabella married Philip of Antioch, who died in 1226.\nIsabella later married Hethum I, king of Cilician Armenia. They had:\n*Euphemia (? – 1309), the wife of Julian of Sidon (? –  12 January 1275/ 11 January 1276)\n*Sybilla (? – 1290), the wife of Prince Bohemond VI of Antioch (c. 1237 – May/ 11 July 1275)\n*Rita (? – ?), the wife of Constantine of Servantikar\n*Leo II, king of Cilician Armenia ( 24 January 1236/ 23 January 1237 –  6 February 1289)\n*Thoros (1244 –  24 August 1266)\n*Isabella (? – c. 1268)\n*Marie, who married Guy of Ibelin, son of Baldwin of Ibelin, Seneschal of Cyprus.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
