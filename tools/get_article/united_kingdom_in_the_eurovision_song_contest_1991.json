The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.\nBefore Eurovision\nA Song for Europe 1991\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) held A Song for Europe 1991 on 29 March 1991, hosted by Terry Wogan. Following the somewhat negative comments by one member of the celebrity panel in 1990, the panel idea was dropped in 1991. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all the songs, the musicians appearing on camera for the first time since 1978.\nThe eight songs in contention to represent the United Kingdom were presented during Terry Wogan's Wogan chat show on BBC1. Two songs were presented during each of four broadcasts between 20 and 27 March.\nA separate results show was broadcast on BBC1 the same evening. BBC Radio 2 simulcast the final, with commentary by Ken Bruce, but did not broadcast the results show.\nMalcolm Roberts had been one of six singers who had jointly represented Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985, thus becoming the second entrant in a British national final to have participated in Eurovision for another nation, after Dan Duskey (aka Michael Palace) in 1986.\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\"\n|+ A Song for Europe 199129 March 1991\n|-\n!
