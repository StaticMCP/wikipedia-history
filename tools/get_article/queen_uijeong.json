After this son ascended the throne in 1211, he honoured his late mother as a \"Queen Dowager\"  and gave her a posthumous name. Although she never became a queen consort, dying before her husband became king, she was posthumously given the title of one.\nPosthumous name\n*In October 1253 (40th year reign of King Gojong), name Gong-pyeong () was added to her posthumous name.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0005211 Queen Uijeong] on the Encyclopedia of Korean Culture .\n*[https://www.doopedia.co.kr/mo/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view2&MAS_IDX=101013000828220 광정태후] on Doosan Encyclopedia ."
