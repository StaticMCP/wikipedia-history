It includes such encounters as the zombie ferret, lava ankheg, and dead grass snake, and also in-game recipes for ruby blushrose potpourri and firebush spice paste. The package also includes a 5-page encounter booklet.\nPublication history\nElminster's Ecologies Appendix 1 was written by Scott Davis and Donald J. Bingle, and published by TSR, Inc.\nReception\nRick Swan reviewed Elminster's Ecologies Appendix 1 for Dragon magazine #221 (September 1995). He calls this package \"charming\", and concludes that \"Whimsical asides and grumpy narration [...] makes this as fun as a fairy tale. They could have cut the 5-page encounter booklet, though, which is long on pretty pictures but short on useful information.\"\nReviews\n*'' #9\nReferences"
