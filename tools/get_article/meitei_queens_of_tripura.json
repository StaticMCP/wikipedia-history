The Tripuri kings married not only the Meitei princesses but also many other ladies of commoners' families of Meitei community (alias Manipuri ethnicity). Meitei queens were remembered for their contributions to the development of the Tripuri society. So, they were given high status in the royal house of Tripura.\nEarly queens\nUnnamed queen\nThe first historically recorded matrimonial alliances between the Meitei kingdom and Tripura kingdom is mentioned in the Tripuri royal chronicle of \"Sri Rajmala\".  According to the book, Tripuri King Taidakshin, who was the grandson of King Trilochana, married a Meitei princess in 5th century CE. However, names of the princess as well as of her father was not mentioned.\nQueen Yangnu\nCheitharol Kumbaba (|}}), the Meitei royal chronicle of Manipur kingdom, mentioned that in 1609, a lady named Yangnu (|}}) of the Akhoicham family (|}}), who was the wife of a Tripuri King went to her country. However, there were little details on the marriage.\nMaharani designated queens\nQueen Hariseswari\nHariseswari (|}}) was the wife of Tripuri King Rajdhar Manikya II (1785–1804) and the daughter of Meitei King Bhagyachandra (|}}) alias Joy Singh (|}}) (1759-1761 and 1763-1798). King Bhagyachandra went for pilgrimages to many holy and sacred places of India. On his way, he visited and stayed in Agartala, the Tripuri capital, for few days. During his stay, he offered his daughter, princess Hariseswari, hand in marriage to Tripuri King Rajdhar Manikya II. This marriage brought cordial relations between the two kingdoms. The Meitei king then left Tripura for his further pilgrimage. Meitei Queen Hariseswari brought an idol of Hindu deity, Sri Radhamadhav, from her homeland Manipur. It was installed in the royal palace of Tripura. Meitei priests, musicians, noblemen and maid attendants of the Meitei princess came from Manipur and settled in Tripura. They lived near the royal house at a newly established village called Mekhlipara (|}}).\nQueen Kutilakha/Kutilakshi\nKutilakha (|}}), also known as Kutilakshi (|}}), was the wife of Tripuri King Kashichandra Manikya (1826-1829) and a Meitei princess of Manipur kingdom.

Purnakala was not taken by King Krishna Kishore Manikya to the royal palace. So, a house was built at Haidra (Dholeswar) for her where she lived along with her subjects. From that time in 1838, the construction of a new palace named Nutan Haveli (|}}) began in Agartala. Thus, Queen Purnakala was one of the reasons for the establishment of a new capital in Agartala.\nQueen Moirangthem Chanu Muktabali Devi\nMoirangthem Chanu Muktabali Devi (|}}) was a Meitei lady from Sylhet in modern day Assam.

King Birchandra wrote many poems in memory of Queen Bhanumati.\nPanganbam Chanu Rajeswari\nPanganbam Chanu Rajeswari (|}}), also known as Kaboklei (|}}), was the second queen of Tripuri King Birchandra Manikya (1862-1896).

She built a temple and a pavilion near the present day ISKCON temple in Tripura.\nQueen Ratnamanjuri\nRatnamanjuri (|}}), also known as Dhaka Rani (|}}), was a Meitei lady from Bengal (in present day Bangladesh). She was a queen of Tripuri King Radhakishore Manikya (1896–1909), the son of a Meitei queen. 1874, when Radhakishore was a prince, his father, King Birchandra Manikya went to Dhaka to meet British Governor Northbrook. On the way, he met Meitei King Debendra Singh (|}}) in Dhaka. Birchandra Manikya saw Princess Ratnamanjuri, the daughter of the Meitei king. He was charmed by the princess' beauty that he wanted to make her his daughter-in-law. Afterwards, princess Ratnamanjuri came to Agartala and married crown prince Radhakishore. As she came from Dhaka, she was also known as Dhaka Rani, among the Meitei people in Tripura. Queen Ratnamanjuri was the mother of the successive Tripuri King Birendrakishore Manikya.\nQueen Tulshibati\nTulshibati (|}}) first queen of Tripuri King Radhakishore Manikya (1896–1909), the son of a Meitei queen.

Moreover, she constructed temples in almost all the Meitei villages of Tripura such as Bishalgarh, Bamutia, Murabari, Daccabari etc. She also offered rent-free lands to the public for the construction of the temples and pavilions. She introduced the plantation of basil plants to the Tripuri royal palace, as its leaves were important religious offerings to deities.\nQueen Monomanjuri\nMonomanjuri (|}}) was one of the three Meitei queens of Tripuri King Radhakishore Manikya (1896–1909), the son of a Meitei queen. She was less popular in comparison to the other two Meitei queens of her time.\nRoyal consorts\nIn addition to the queens (termed as \"Maharani\"), there were also simple royal consorts (termed as \"Rani\") from Meitei community (Manipuri ethnicity) in the kingdom of Tripura.\n* Tripuri King Birendrakishore Manikya (1909-1923) married ten Meitei ladies.
