      "text": "# Odino culture\n\nThe Odino culture is an archeological culture of foot hunters in the basin of the upper Ob river. The culture includes two phases, the older from 2900–2500&nbsp;BC, the younger from 2300–1900&nbsp;BC. The Odino culture covers an island surrounded by forest-steppe type cultural array. Its settlements are situated along the terraces of the rivers and creeks. Certain insufficiently understood dwellings appear to be dug-outs. It is thought that the Odino culture rose from Eneolithic forest- steppe cultures in the Ishim area.\nEconomy\nThe available materials indicate the beginning of a tradition of an economy based on animal husbandry. Osteological material is represented exclusively by domesticated animals' bones indicating the central role of animal husbandry to the Odino economy. Similarity with typical products of tin bronze alloys indicate affiliation with the Seima-Turbino phenomenon. The Odino culture stone industry has not been fully studied.\nArcheology\nOdino culture burials are similar to those of the Krotovo culture, which indicate the presence of common rituals typical for the cultures of the northern forest-steppe belonging to the Seima Turbino metallurgical province.\nThe Odino culture is notable for its ceramics, with dishes decorated with comb impressions with or without  rows of pit indentations, coarse textile prints, and some pit ornament elements forming geometrical figures. Odino culture is marked by specific borrowings in ornamentation, including pseudo-textile prints, which indicates close ties with the taiga populations.\nReferences\nLiterature\n* Молодин. В. И. др.
