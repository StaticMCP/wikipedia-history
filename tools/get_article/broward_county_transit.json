It is the second-largest transit system in Florida after Miami-Dade Transit. It currently operates the only public bus system in Broward County. Besides serving Broward County, It also serves portions of Palm Beach County and Miami-Dade County, where it overlaps its service with Miami-Dade Transit and Palm Tran. The Broward County Transit system has among the highest ridership per capita as well as the lowest cost per passenger of metropolitan transit systems in the U.S. This system's ability to minimize transit travel time has been most effective in producing such high performances. Implemented bus-priority strategies have had an overall minimal effect on traffic, aiding in the overall minimized travel time. Reports have shown how traffic has experienced an improved traffic flow since such bus strategies have been implemented.\nSeveral light rail and people mover have been proposed in Broward County, such as the cancelled Wave Streetcar from the 2010s, which would have served downtown Fort Lauderdale, as well as the newer PREMO Light Rail between the airport and Port Everglades, and people movers proposed within the airport. Additionally, Broward Commuter Rail is a proposed service for a commuter rail service known as Coastal Link passing through the county on the Florida East Coast Railway line that also carries Brightline.\nThe Broward County Transit system has also experienced an improved transit accessibility which has correlated with the shorter periods on welfare for careless welfare recipients. The BCT system may influence in aiding such individuals with secure jobs and overall reduce the dependence on welfare. However, numerous bus stops have been inaccessible for people with disabilities. Implements such as curb ramps have been emphasized by researchers as the Broward County Transit accessibility could be significantly improved for such users.\nServices\n* Regular local Service: Broward County Transit's local service is focused mainly in Broward County. However, they operate routes traveling from Broward County to Palm Beach County, linking their service with Palm Tran.There are also routes that travel from Broward County to Miami-Dade County, linking their service with Miami-Dade Transit.\n* Limited-stop service: Known as The Breeze (separate from overall fleet theme), operates 4 routes, one via S.R. 7 (US 441)-(441 Breeze), another one via US-1 (US-1 Breeze), another one via University Dr (University Breeze), and the other via Broward Blvd (Broward Breeze).\n* Paratransit and community bus service: Paratransit services are available for disabled riders and senior citizens. Community Buses operate special routes as an extension of the local bus service in Broward County.\n* 95 Express: This is an express bus service that travels on Interstate 95 from Pembroke Pines and Miramar to downtown Miami. It only operates on weekdays and peak directions and costs an extra $0.65 ($0.30 for youth, senior, and disabled). It is primarily operated using  MCI D4500CT motor coaches.\n* 595 Express: This is an express bus service that travels on Interstate 595 from BB&T Center to downtown Miami. It only operates on weekdays and utilizes the same premium express fare as the 95 Express. Like the 95 Express, it is primarily operated using MCI D4500CT motor coaches.\nFleet\nA Broward County Transit bus in its previous honeycomb livery. The bus has since been retired.\nA Broward County Transit bus in the original Breeze livery. The bus has since been retired.\nSince 2000, BCT has developed themed liveries for each new fleet order. The previous generation, introduced in the early 1980s, did not have a name.\nBee Line generation\nThe Bee Line generation was first introduced in 1997, replacing older high-floor buses decorated with a split orange and blue stripe around the side. These low-floor buses were painted white with a yellow honeycomb pattern stripe on all sides. A cartoon bee character was also placed on each bus, and was later removed.\nThe Breeze generation\nThe Breeze generation was introduced in 2007 for two special limited-stop service routes on US 1 and US 441/SR 7, traversing from northern Broward County to northern Miami-Dade County. BCT has now added 48  NABI 40-LFW buses to the fleet. BCT introduced six New Flyer D60LFR articulated buses for service on the US 441/SR 7 route. The new buses also feature free Wi-Fi to riders.\nThe Breeze generation 2007-2018 buses were originally painted in white with two blue arcs, one light and one dark. Later buses ordered and some of the older buses were painted in silver with two blue arcs, one light and one dark.\nIn 2008, BCT ordered 42 newly restyled  low-floor NABIs, including 12 hybrid buses.\nCurrent livery\nThe current livery was introduced in 2020 as part of the half-penny tax, also known as Penny for Transportation. The livery consists of the front and sides of the buses being painted silver with an orange and white stripe running across the side of the bus with the back of the bus being painted blue. The Broward County colors of orange, yellow, and white are shown via diagonal stripes parallel to each other on the front and rear quarter panels off the bus.\nThis paint scheme was introduced on BCT's 147 2020 Gillig BRT buses.\nBattery electric\nBroward County ordered 42 battery electric buses from Proterra for $54 million. Proterra only delivered 21 of the 42 buses before going bankrupt. Buses that were delivered broke down every 600 miles on average, and are not often put into service. Additionally, during the month of February 2025, none of the buses were able to be put into use. Miznazi, A. (2025, February 20). ''Most of South Florida's electric buses parked, awaiting repairs''. GovTech. https://www.govtech.com/transportation/most-of-south-floridas-electrice-buses-parked-awaiting-repairs. Overall, the implemented use of electric buses has had a limited impact on the community. Although, due to the breakdowns these buses have experienced, there has been a need for further services upgrades.\nExpansion\nIn 2024, Jacobs Solutions signed a 30-year, $4.4 billion contract with BCT to enhance and expand public transit services.\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to Port Everglades\nJacobs Solutions will design and build a light rail system that will connect Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to Port Everglades. This will be a 5-year, $17.5 million project.\nVehicle replacement and expansion\nBetween 2025 and 2034, BCT plans to replace 449 vehicles and expand its fleet by 114 new vehicles, resulting in a total projected fleet size of 529 vehicles by 2034. The expansion includes vehicles for both fixed-route and express route services, with replacements scheduled annually to phase out aging units.\nRoutes\nLocal service\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
