Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, did not itself bestow a national championship.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"|\n| &nbsp;\n| National champion\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n|\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n|\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nChampions (by ranking)\nThe AP poll and most other methods rank Minnesota as the national champion. One method ranks Alabama and two rank Texas.\n*AP poll: Minnesota\n*Berryman QPRS: Texas\n*Billingsley Report: Minnesota\n*Boand System: Minnesota\n*College Football Researchers Association:\n*DeVold System: Minnesota\n*Dunkel System: Minnesota\n*Helms Athletic Foundation: Minnesota\n*Houlgate System: Alabama\n*Litkenhous Ratings: Minnesota\n*National Championship Foundation: Minnesota\n*Poling System: Minnesota\n*Sagarin Ratings Elo chess method: Minnesota\n*Sagarin Ratings Predictor method: Minnesota\n*Williamson System: Texas\nNote: AP Poll, Boand System, Dunkel System, Helms Athletic Foundation, Houlgate System, Litkenhous Ratings, Poling System, and Williamson System were given contemporarily. All other methods were given retroactively.\nAP Poll\nThe final AP Poll was released on December 1, at the end of the 1941 regular season, weeks before the major bowls.
