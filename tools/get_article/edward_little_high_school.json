The school was established in 1835 as Lewiston Falls Academy after philanthropist Edward Little donated  and considerable money to the academy, which was named in his honor. The school is now situated on a  tract of land overlooking the city from the top of Goff Hill in Auburn Heights.\nHistory\n19th century\nat the school by Franklin Simmons]]\nThe school was first commissioned by the Maine State Legislature as Lewiston Falls Academy. Little contributed numerous resources to the school, including land and money. It was renamed to the Edward Little Institute in September 1849. When the City of Auburn was given control over the school in April 1874, it came with the condition that the school always be named in honor of Edward Little.\nIn December 1884, the school was damaged by a fire. Newspaper accounts reported the building that cost $18,000 to build was insured for $6,000.  The school suffered another fire this one destroyed the entire third floor in 1943.\n20th century\nIn the early 1930s, a second building was erected. In 1961, the building formerly used as Edward Little High School was completed at a cost of US$1.9 million.\n21st century\nIn June 2009, the school was placed on probation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Reasons cited for this probation included \"the poor and inadequate condition of the school's kitchen facility...the insufficient heating system,\" and low funding for educational resources and technology.\nIn 2023, the construction of a replacement building reached completion, opening for the 2023-24 school year. The former building has since been demolished.\nAthletics\nThe school's sports teams are known as the Red Eddies, with the ghost of Edward Little as their mascot. The school competes as a member of the Kennebec Valley Athletic Conference. The school's most successful teams in recent years include Alpine ski racing, soccer, basketball, and track and field.
