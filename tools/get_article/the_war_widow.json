After meeting with Barbara Schultz, they talked over ideas about what they envisioned for the project. Perr recalls that he thought of the play as a \"human drama\", and decided it should be a period piece, so he conducted research in the World War I era, and \"somehow whatever theme it has just took over.\" He went on to say that no one ever came to him and said; \"write a feminist play.\" He states he presented it to them and they said \"go ahead.\"\nRelease\nThe film was produced for Los Angeles PBS affiliate KCET's Visions series. It was broadcast nationally in October 1976, with a disclaimer that it was funded by grant money rather than public funds. For the time period it was released, it was described by the Chicago Reader, as \"the first, positive treatment of a lesbian theme on American TV,\" while the UCLA Film & Television Archive said it was a \"significant milestone in the realistic, positive depiction of lesbians on primetime television.\"\nCritical analysis and reception\nAnalysis\nAustrian-American sex researcher Fritz Klein wrote, \"we have the rich, full portrayal of two homosexual people; what is excluded is Amy's bisexuality; it is there, but it is vague, it is not dealt with, it is ignored; Amy would seem to be a lesbian, her marriage a sham; as a lesbian she is understood and viewed with sympathy; as a bisexual her existence is fuzzy.\"\nFilm historian Vito Russo wrote that in 1976, there were \"two stunning television dramas, The Naked Civil Servant and The War Widow, which were positive evocations of the lives of gay characters, real and fictional; both shows infused their central characters with a sense of history and of their role in that history as strugglers for sexual freedom; both shows uncovered with romance and humor a hidden part of the gay experience.\" Russo argues that when Amy decides to leave her husband and her young daughter to choose a lifestyle that was \"violently condemned at that time, was shown to be cataclysmic; thus her courage is striking yet understandable.\"  He further opined that the ending of the film \"encapsulates those women who left small towns all over the world for the anonymity and safety of larger cities where they could be with their own kind and begin to be the people they truly were.\"\nReception\nAuthor Shayna Warner opined that \"Harvey Perr and Paul Bogart created a sumptuously designed, carefully staged period piece of quiet despair being met by determination, in which upper-class, depressed, and harried mother Amy is brought back to her senses by bold portraitist Jenny.\" Terrence O'Flaherty of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote \"it is an absolutely first-rate adult love story sensitively portrayed and beautifully produced; there is nothing vague about the nature of the love but it is handled with dignity and taste and the ending is honest.\"\nFilm critic John J. O'Connor wrote that the movie \"encompasses a sympathetic treatment of a lesbian relationship but, more important, the characters are portrayed as intelligent people, not as ludicrous stereotypes.\" He goes on to say the film succeeds, \"perhaps through its emotional validity more than anything else.\" He also offered praise for the actors, sayin the \"performances are incredibly good; Pamela Bellwood's Amy is strikingly lovely and affecting; Francis Lee McCain is a revelation as Jennie, presenting the woman with a direct and appealing openness and Katharine Bard is perfectly distant and curiously sympathetic as Amy's mother.\"\nTelevision critic Cecil Smith stated the film \"is as perfect a television play as I can remember — very intimate and delicate and personal, the kind of play Paddy Chayevsky called 'the drama of the moment'; it's a mood piece, exquisitely fashioned under the sensitive direction of Paul Bogart; there is something very fragile and ethereal about it, like Japanese silk-screen paintings; their love affair is handled neither meanly nor shamefacedly but as a joyful encounter.\"\nMichael Connor from The Wall Street Journal observed that \"Harvey Perr's film is probably the most beautiful and sensitive treatment of love between two women that has ever been produced for TV.\" Critic Kay Gardella commented that \"dealing with a subject like lesbianism is not easy; many resent the theme, but as Barbara Schultz so wisely points out, a successful drama engages your emotionally, you don't have to approve of the subject or even like it; but if it is effective and it works, it engages you and you can understand it on an emotional level.\"\nAccolades\nThe movie won the Audience Award for Best Video at the 1988 San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.\nSee also\n*List of LGBTQ-related films of 1976\n*List of made-for-television films with LGBTQ characters\nReferences\nSources\n* |date=October 26, 1985}}\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n* |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250326111931/https://newsroom.ucla.edu/dept/faculty/august-5-virtual-screening-room-visions-the-war-widow |archive-date=March 26, 2025 |date=July 29, 2021 |url-status=live}}\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*[https://lezwatchtv.com/show/visions-the-war-widow/ The War Widow] at LezWatch"
