The resolution creating the reserve gives the area of . }}\nThe reserve is in the region where the Rio Verde and Paraná River converge, and contains a complex system of interconnected lagoons, streams and channels connected to the channel of the Paraná, which has shifted its bed to the east over time.\nThere are traces of old channels of the Paraná dating back 10,000 to 40,000 years.\nThe terrain is gently undulating.\nThere are two important prehistoric archaeological sites.\nHistory\nThe Cisalpina Private Natural Heritage Reserve was created as partial compensation for the land flooded by the Companhia Energética de São Paulo (CESP) with the Eng Sérgio Motta Dam on the Paraná River, which would flood  of the Lagoa São Paulo Reserve and  of the Great Pontal Reserve. Rio do Peixe State Park, the  Aguapeí State Park and the  Rio Ivinhema State Park. }}\nThe area once included the Fazenda Olímpia, which was acquired in the 1950s by the Grupo Cisalpina Agrícola S/A.\nThis in turn was acquired by CESP.\nCESP also acquired the Fazenda Flórida.\nThese formed the Cisalpina/Flórida Complex.\nThe idea of converting the complex into a private natural heritage reserve was described by CESP in a document of 26 November 2003.\nThe proposed reserve had an area of .\nThis would be part of a larger managed area of .\nThe reserve proper was limited to the land above the  waterline allowed for seasonal operation of the reservoir.\nThe Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) began the process of analyzing the request on 7 June 2004.\nThe municipal chamber of Brasilândia approved creation of the reserve on 16 November 2005.\nThe state of Mato Grosso do Sul formally created the reserve on 6 June 2016 with an area of , this being the sum of the areas of the Fazenda Flórida and Fazenda Olímpia properties.\nLand ownership is fully regularized, and the reserve's boundaries are surrounded.\nAs of 2016 the management plan was being completed.\nEnvironment\nThe climate is hot and humid, with one to three dry months.\nThe reserve covers an extensive area of várzea that is periodically flooded in the rainy season.\nThe circulation in the area was drastically changed when the reservoir of the Eng Sérgio Motta Dam filled, changing the equilibrium of the system.\nAs of 2012 the vegetation was still adapting to the new conditions of moisture.\nThe region had been slowly becoming drier, but is now returning to moister conditions.\nThe mix of cerrado species is probably changing due to the rise in the level of the groundwater.\nThe vegetation has a wide variety of species caused by climate and geomorphological changes during the Quaternary, the reserve's diverse environments and previous human occupation.\nThere are at least 95 plant species, 171 bird species, 25 species of terrestrial fauna, 44 species of fish.\nCactus plants are found some areas, probably remnants of an earlier climate.\nUse for farming and ranching introduced exotic species of grass.\nIn the drier parts there are plants of the cerrado and cerradão forests.\nThese areas are being partially reforested in a program that is also releasing native animals. The vegetation is still in the process of regenerating.\nFauna include marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla).\nSanitation in the municipality is poor.\nThe soil and groundwater are contaminated and untreated sewage flows via the Aviação and Bom Jardim channels into the reservoir.\nEnvironmental crimes by local residents indicate a lack of awareness of the importance of the reserve.\nThe reserve would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paraná ecoregion.\nNotes\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*|language=pt\n|title=PES do Rio do Peixe|publisher=ISA: Instituto Socioambiental\n|url=https://uc.socioambiental.org/uc/593465|accessdate=2016-11-12}}\n*\n*\n*|language=pt|title=Unidades de Conservação|publisher=CSEP: Companhia Energética de São Paulo|url=http://www.cesp.com.br/portalCesp/portal.nsf/V03.02/MeioAmbiente_Conservacao_Texto?OpenDocument|accessdate=2016-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502221146/http://www.cesp.com.br/portalCesp/portal.nsf/V03.02/MeioAmbiente_Conservacao_Texto?OpenDocument|archive-date=2014-05-02|url-status=dead}}\n*"
