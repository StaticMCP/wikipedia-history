He stood as a Parliamentary candidate on five occasions, but won only once.\nBiography\nMoeran first stood for Parliament as the Common Wealth candidate at the Newark by-election in July 1943, when he came a distant third. At the 1945 general election he stood in Thirsk and Malton, again as a Common Wealth candidate. Labour did not contest the seat, and in a two-way contest with the Conservative party candidate, Moeran won 39.9% of the votes.\nHe subsequently joined the Labour Party, and was elected at the 1950 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Bedfordshire, but was narrowly defeated at the next election, in 1951.  He stood again in 1955, but did not regain the seat.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [http://www.sussex.ac.uk/library/speccoll/collection_introductions/commonwealth.html Common Wealth party archives] at the University of Sussex"
