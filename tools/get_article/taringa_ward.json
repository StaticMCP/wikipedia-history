      "text": "# Taringa Ward\n\nTaringa Ward was a Brisbane City Council ward from 1985 to 1994. It covered the present-day suburbs of  St Lucia and Taringa, along with the majority of Indooroopilly and Toowong.\nThe ward was established for the 1985 Brisbane City Council election as part of an increase from 21 to 26 wards. It was created from the southern part of the abolished Auchenflower Ward and the eastern part of the abolished Indooroopilly Ward. It was abolished for the 1994 Brisbane City Council election; its north becoming part of the second Toowong Ward, and its south becoming part of the new Walter Taylor Ward.\nThe ward was represented by the Liberal Party for the nine years it existed. Denver Beanland was elected for the party in 1985, having represented the abolished Auchenflower Ward since the 1976 election.\nBeanland resigned in 1986 following his election as the member for Toowong in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, and June O'Connell was elected at the resulting by-election. O'Connell was re-elected in 1988 and 1991.\nThe ward was abolished for the 1994 election, and O'Connell went on to successfully contest the new Walter Taylor Ward, which she represented until the 2000 election.\nCouncillors for Taringa Ward\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n!Image\n!Member\n!Party\n!Term\n!Notes\n|-\n| |&nbsp;\n|\n| Denver Beanland\n| Liberal\n| 30 March 1985 – 1986\n| Represented preceding Auchenflower Ward from 1976 until its abolishment.
