      "text": "# Booker, Buckinghamshire\n\nBooker is a hamlet within the parish of West Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England, which has absorbed into the expanding suburbs of High Wycombe.  There are several housing areas in Booker, mainly modern estates. At the 2011 Census the hamlet was included in the High Wycombe Ward of Booker and Cressex.\nBooker is also the name frequently given to the local airfield, more properly known as Wycombe Air Park, one of the busiest general aviation airfields in the South East of England.  The airfield is used for general aviation and gliding and is home to both helicopters and fixed wing planes.\nThe airfield is home to the Airways Flying Club and Wycombe Air Centre.\nMain parts are mistaken for Cressex, the neighbouring village to the east of the hamlet.  This is because there are no proper, recognised borders between Booker, Cressex, Sands and Castlefield.\nHistory\nThe \"tithing of Bokar\" was referred to in the 13th-century. The etymology of the name is unknown, though it may come from \"bōc-ora\".\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.flyingfamilies.com Flying Families, GA Flying Organisation based at Booker]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060428062455/http://www.wycombeaircentre.co.uk/ Wycombe Air Centre]\n*[http://www.bafc.co.uk British Airways Flying Club at Booker]"
