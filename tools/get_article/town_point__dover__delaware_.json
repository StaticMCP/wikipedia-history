It is one of the oldest buildings in Delaware. It was built in three sections, with the earliest dated to about 1677. The oldest section is a brick, three bay structure consisting of two rooms and a center hall.  A one-story, brick kitchen wing was added to the original section at an early date. A five-bay frame second story was added early in the 19th century.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nSee also\n*List of the oldest buildings in Delaware\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
