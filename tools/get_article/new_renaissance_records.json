According to a March 1985 interview in Kerrang!, Boleyn sold her car and musical instruments to fund the initial pressings of compilation albums, which featured the earliest commercial recordings of Wehrmacht, Morbid Angel, Artillery, Mayhem, Prong, Sepultura, At War, Savage Grace, and Flotsam and Jetsam.\nEarly history\nBy 1985, the demand for heavy metal products resulted in a packaging and distribution offer from Greenworld Distribution to both New Renaissance Records and Roadrunner Records. Therefore, some of the earliest pressings on New Renaissance bear the Greenworld label and feature a catalog number beginning with \"GWD.\" However, by 1986 Greenworld Records Distribution became embroiled in legal problems after the distribution of the Frankenchrist album by the Dead Kennedys. In early 1986 Greenworld went out of business. After that time, the catalog numbers have all begun with \"NR.\"\nIn 1987 Quorthon of Bathory from Stockholm, Sweden visited them for his first ever press campaign in USA.\nSigned groups have included Chyld, Rock City Angels (featuring actor Johnny Depp), Wehrmacht, Sepultura, Morbid Angel, Artillery, King Kobra, IronChrist, and Kublai Khan. Other label acts include Wilder (Carmen Wilder), Holocross, Amulance, Blood Feast, Cerebus, Dream Death, Deadly Blessing, Forger featuring Geoff Mega, Genöcide, Medieval, Post Mortem, At War, Savage Grace, Mayhem, Prong, Whiplash, Indestroy, Screamer, and more.\nCurrent affairs\nLabel founder took time off of the music business to study law, and obtained her license to practice law in December 2007. The label maintains a catalog of over thirty titles which are distributed worldwide.\nNew Renaissance recording artist At War have returned with a new album Infidel in 2009 that has received critical acclaim and follows up their two New Renaissance titles Ordered to Kill and Retaliatory Strike.\nIn 2014, New Renaissance Records released a 2-disc anthology, entitled To Hellion And Back, by Hellion. The anthology was followed by Hellion's first release of new music in over a decade, and is entitled ''Karma's a Bitch''.\nSee also\n* List of record labels\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.thecorroseum.com/labels/newrenaissance.html New Renaissance Records Discography at The Corroseum]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080417012246/http://www.newrenaissancerecords.com/ Official website (New)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070808211654/http://bnrmetal.com/groups/heln.htm BNR Metal – Hellion]\n* [http://www.sleazegrinder.com/flashmetalhellion.htm Flash metal hellion]"
