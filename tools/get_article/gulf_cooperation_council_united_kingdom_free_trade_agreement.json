When completed it will be the first free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the Gulf Cooperation Council, or any of its member states: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nBackground\nFollowing the 2016 Brexit referendum, in which the UK voted to leave the European Union, the Gulf states began pressing the UK Government for a post-Brexit Trade agreement.\nBritish trade with the GCC was worth about 45 billion pounds ($61 billion) in 2019, 7% of the size of Britain's commerce with the European Union in 2019. Talks for a trade deal intensified in late 2021, just after the Premier League approved  Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund's takeover of Newcastle United from billionaire Mike Ashley\nMinister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism for Bahrain, Zayed Al Zayani hoped that the two sides could complete negotiations by the \"end of this year or the middle of next year,\" in January 2022.\nIn June 2021, International trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan stated that the  agreement would target a £1.6bn annual boost to the UK economy, and that the agreement would be a comprehensive FTA that will cover manufactured goods and agricultural produce to financial and digital services.\nIn 2023, the UK signed a Memorandum of understanding with the United Arab Emirates in regards to financial services.\nNegotiations\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ GCCUKFTA Round of Negotiations\n|-\n!

On 18 December 2024, Douglas Alexander updated the House of Commons on the negotiations. On 20 March 2025, Keir Starmer discussed the trade deal, in a phone call with Mohammed bin Salman. On 26 April 2025, David Lammy visited Oman and Qatar to discuss progress with the negotiations.\nControversy\nChair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Democracy and Human Rights in the Gulf, Brendan O'Hara criticized the absence of human rights talks. Trade talks avoided discussions of events such as the murder of critical Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the UAE's detention of British academic Matthew Hedges for alleged spying.\nSee also\n*Free trade agreements of the United Kingdom\n*Foreign relations of Bahrain\n*Foreign relations of Kuwait\n*Foreign relations of Oman\n*Foreign relations of Qatar\n*Foreign relations of the United Arab Emirates\n*Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n*Foreign relations of Saudi Arabia\n*Bahrain–United Kingdom relations\n*Oman–United Kingdom relations\n*Qatar–United Kingdom relations\n*Saudi Arabia–United Kingdom relations\n*United Arab Emirates–United Kingdom relations\nReferences\nExternal links"
