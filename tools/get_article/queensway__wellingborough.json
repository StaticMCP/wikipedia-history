Running north–south between Hardwick Road and Northampton Road, Queensway, along with Kingsway and Gleneagles Drive, acts as an inner bypass of central Wellingborough, making it one of the most important and busiest roads in the town.\nColloquially referred to as 'Queens', the estate is situated on the west side of Wellingborough town. The area had a population of 5,818 at the 2011 census.\nHistory\nQueensway was significantly expanded in the 1960s–70s to re-house overspill population from London. Prior to this expansion, Queensway was a medium-sized council estate, with predominantly semi-detached council houses, with a large portion of the area consisting of green land and fields. In 2015, the Queensway area faced a large amount of regeneration following the transfer of Wellingborough social housing from Wellingborough Council to Wellingborough Homes (now Greatwell Homes).\nCrime and poverty\nFor a significant period Queensway has been known for gang related crime and violence. In 2021, Queensway was one of the 225 neighborhoods across the UK identified as being 'left behind' by the government.\nPublic transportation\nThe area is served by Stagecoach's W1 bus.\nPolitics\nOn Wellingborough Town Council, Queensway ward is represented by Sylvia Erskine, Adam Henley and Kelly Duddridge (all Labour). The ward forms part of the parliamentary constituency of Wellingborough and the MP is Gen Kitchen (Labour).\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/ Borough Council of Wellingborough]"
