      "text": "# The \"Civil War\" EP\n\nUse Your Illusion World Tour II\n| prev_year  = 1992\n| next_title = Garden of Eden: Strictly Limited Edition\n| next_year  = 1993\n}}\nThe \"Civil War\" EP (better known as simply Civil War) is the third extended play by Guns N' Roses, released in the UK only on May 24, 1993. It is named after the song of the same name. The EP is a compilation, departing from the band's previous two live-style EPs. Included are songs from both Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II, and an exclusive interview with Slash.\nArtwork\nThe front cover to the EP is black. Each copy was individually numbered. On the case of the CD, the silver words \"Guns N' Roses\" were stuck on. The EP-style case features a flap advertisement in the \"booklet\", with one side advertising the band's gig at Milton Keynes, England, and the other side advertises the band's video single for \"Garden of Eden\", which was released on the same day.\nOn the German edition's front cover, the subtitle 'Civil War' and the blood-like graphical element is more on the right lower corner, and there is no individual numbering.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n'''Guns N' Roses\n*W.
