For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".\nSome of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title.  Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n33 & 34 Vict.\nThe second session of the 20th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 8 February 1870 until 10 August 1870.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Supply Act 1870|public|5|25-03-1870|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply certain sums out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the years ending on the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine, one thousand eight hundred and seventy, and one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and preceding years.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and for other purposes relating to the Preservation of Peace in Ireland.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  and the Railway Companies Facilities Act, 1864.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|\n| or the Abolition of Forfeiture Act 1870or the Felony Act 1870|public|23|04-07-1870|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to abolish Forfeitures for Treason and Felony, and to otherwise amend the Law relating thereto.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Wine and Beerhouse Amendment Act 1870|public|29|14-07-1870|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to amend and continue \"The Wine and Beerhouse Act, 1869.\"|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Supply Act 1870|public|31|01-08-1870|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to apply the sum of nine million pounds out of the Consolidated Fund to the service of the year ending the thirty-first day of March one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n| or the Pauper Conveyance (Expenses) Act 1870|public|48|09-08-1870|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act for removing doubts respecting the payment of Expenses incurred in the Conveyance of Paupers in certain cases not expressly provided for by Law.|note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  so far as such Act relates to the Isle of Man.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Siam and Straits Settlement Jurisdiction Act 1870|public|55|09-08-1870|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to vest Jurisdiction in matters arising within the Dominions of the Kings of Siam in the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements.|note4= }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Army Enlistment Act 1870|public|91|09-08-1870|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act for the Relief of Persons admitted to the Office of Priest or Deacon in the Church of England.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| |note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Joint Stock Companies Arrangements Act 1870|public|104|10-08-1870|repealed=y|archived=n|An Act to Facilitate compromises and arrangements between creditors and shareholders of Joint Stock and other Companies in liquidation.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  so far as relates to the City of Dublin.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  }}\n|  in part, and to afford facilities for obtaining Loans for the erection, enlargement, and improvement of Glebe Houses, and for the acquirement of lands for Glebes, in Ireland.}}\n}}\nLocal acts\n|\n|\n|  and for other purposes.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n| or the Oyster and Mussel Fisheries Supplemental Act 1870'''|local|6|12-05-1870|maintained=y|archived=n|An Act to confirm certain Orders made by the Board of Trade under The Sea Fisheries Act, 1868, relating to Boston Deeps and Emsworth.|po1=Boston Deeps Fishery Order 1870|Order for the Regulation, by the Corporation of the Borough of Boston, of an Oyster and Mussel Fishery in Boston Deeps, being a portion of the Estuary called the Wash, in the County of Lincoln.\n|po2=Emsworth Fishery Order 1870|Order for the Establishment and Maintenance by the Oyster Merchants' Company, Limited, of a Several Oyster and Mussel Fishery at Emsworth, in the Estuary of the Emsworth Channel, in the Counties of Sussex and Southampton.}}\n|\n|\n|\n-\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|\n|\n|  }}\n|  to increase the capital of the Fylde Waterworks Company, to extend and define the limits of supply, to give power to alter the number of directors;
