On 7 August, the day after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence () or PPKI was established. Sukarno was chairman, and Hatta vice-chairman. On 19 August 1945, this body created 12 ministries for Indonesia's first cabinet. The cabinet as formed contained sanyo as well as officials who had not worked with the Japanese. The cabinet was responsible to President Sukarno.\nComposition\nPresident\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\" width=270|President\n!colspan=\"2\" width=270|Vice President\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|Sukarno\n|align=\"center\" width=117|\n|align=\"center\" width=116|\n|align=\"left\"|Mohammad Hatta\n|}\nMinisters\n| minister1_termend      =\n| minister1_party        = Independent (politician)\n| minister1_ref          =\n}}\n| minister1_termend      =\n| minister1_party        = Independent (politician)\n| minister1_ref          =\n}}\n| minister1_termend      =\n| minister1_party        = Independent (politician)\n| minister1_ref          =\n| minister2              = Muhammad Soeljoadikusuma\n| minister2_termstart    =\n| minister2_termend      =\n| minister2_party        = Independent (politician)\n| minister2_ref          =\n}}\n| minister1_termend      =\n| minister1_party        = Independent (politician)\n| minister1_ref          =\n}}\n| minister1_termend      =\n| minister1_party        = Independent (politician)\n| minister1_ref          =\n| minister2              = A.

A. Maramis on health grounds. In a government decree on 6 October, Soeprijadi, a hero of the Blitar rebellion against the occupying Japanese, was officially appointed Defense Minister. However, as no news was ever heard of him, on 20 October Muhammad Soeljoadikusuma was appointed ad interim Defense Minister. Attorney General Gatot Tarunamihardja resigned on 24 October. As a temporary measure, Chief Justice Kusumah Atmaja was appointed acting Attorney General. Kasman Singodiedjo was appointed to the post on 7 November.\nThe end of the cabinet\nOn 11 November 1945, the Central Indonesian National Committee, which was the de facto legislature, demanded the cabinet be responsible to it, not to President Sukarno. Sukarno agreed to this and dismissed the cabinet.\nReferences\n*\n* Ricklefs (1982), A History of Modern Indonesia, Macmillan Southeast Asian reprint,\n*\nNotes"
