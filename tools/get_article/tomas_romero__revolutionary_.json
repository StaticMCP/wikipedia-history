At the beginning of the revolt, \"Tomacito leaned over the governor's (Charles Bent) still living form and raked a bowstring over his scalp, pulling away his gray hair in a glistening sheath ... 'cut as cleanly with the tight cord as it would have with a knife' \"\nAfter the failure of the revolt Romero was given up to the U.S. Army as part of the terms of surrender following the battle at the pueblo on February 5.\nHe was shot while in prison by Private John Fitzgerald on February 8, \"before he had the opportunity to have a trial.\"\nSee also\n*List of assassinated American politicians\nReferences\n* Durand, John, The Taos Massacres'', Puzzlebox Press, Elkhorn, WI 2004"
