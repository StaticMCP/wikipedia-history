Their purpose is to celebrate those who have had a positive impact on accessory consumption during the prior year. Nominees are voted on by accessory-industry insiders, retailers, the Accessories Council Board of Directors and the fashion press. Winners are announced in advance of the annual event, which usually takes place at the beginning of November.\nAccessories Council\nThe awards are handed out by the Accessories Council, a United States-based not-for-profit trade association that was established in 1994 with the mission of increasing consumer use and awareness of accessories. Karen Giberson has been the group’s president since 2005. Its previous president, Sheila Block, led the group from 1996 to 2005.\nThe organization sponsors educational seminars, networking events, seasonal trend reports, marketing and advertising co-op initiatives, design and marketing awards for area fashion students, an annual silent auction, and the black tie ACE Awards Gala, an annual tribute to the leaders of the accessory industry.\nMagazines\n* Special Ace Awards Edition 2024 [https://acmagazine.accessoriescouncil.org/publication/?i=821206]\n* Special Ace Awards Edition 2023 [https://digitaleditions.sheridan.com/publication/?m=65722&i=790038&p=1&pre=1&ver=html5]\n* Special Ace Awards Edition 2022 [https://digitaleditions.sheridan.com/publication/?i=769022&pre=1]\n* Special Ace Awards Edition 2021 [https://mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?m=65722&i=726588&p=1&ver=html5]\nPast winners\n2024\n* Operational Excellence: Aria Logistics\n* Brand of the Year: Coach New York\n* Design Innovation: Cult Gaia\n* Style Influencer: Dana Covarrubias\n* Specialty Retail: elysewalker\n* Hall of Fame: Fern Mallis\n* Legacy: Foster Grant\n* Retailer of the Year: Jared the Galleria of Jewelry\n* Rising Star: Larroudé\n* Style Icon: Linda Fargo\n* Designer of the Year: Prabal Gurung\n2023\n* Brand Innovation: Alexis Bittar\n* Emerging Designer: Dee Ocleppo\n* Legacy: Echo New York\n* Retail Innovation: Fashionphile\n* Sustainability: House of LR&C\n* Couturiere: Judith Leiber Couture\n* Style Ambassador: Julianne Hough\n* Visionary: Mickey Drexler\n* Retailer of the Year: Von Maur\n* Brand of the Year: Wolverine\n2022\n* Visionary: Ben Clymer Hodinkee\n* Global style icon: J Balvin\n* Hall of fame: Josie Natori\n* Brand of the Year: Kurt Geiger London\n* Retail innovation: Lenscrafters\n* Retailer of the year: Moda Operandi\n* Influencer: Molly Rogers + Danny Santiago\n* Brand excellence: Rimowa\n* Legacy: Vera Bradley\n* Brand Launch: Veronica Beard\n* Breakthrough: Victor Glemaud\n2021\n* Super Hero: Iris Apfel\n* Allen Edmonds/Caleres\n* Carolina Herrera/Wes Gordon\n* Christian Siriano\n* Crocs\n* LaQuan Smith\n* Qurate Retail Group\n* ShopBop\n* Karyn Schoenbart/The NPD Group\n* Special recognition to: The Optical Industry, Aether Diamonds, Blessings in a Backpack, Marlyn Schiff\n2019\n* Business Launch: Rachael Ray\n* Business Visionary: Kering Eyewear\n* Designer of the Year: Todd Snyder\n* Legacy: Columbia Sportswear\n* Philanthropy: Breast Cancer Research Foundation\n* Retail Innovator: Rent the Runway\n* Retail Innovation: 10 Corso Como\n* Retailer of the Year: Saks Fifth Avenue\n* Style Ambassador: Jackie Demeterio\n* Style Icon: Ciara\n* Sustainability: Sperry\n* Visionary: Steve Madden\n2018\n* American Heritage Award: Brooks Brothers\n* Breakthrough Award: Allbirds\n* Business Excellence: The Jewelry Group\n* Business Leadership: Andrew Rosen\n* Hall of Fame: Sam & Libby Edelman\n* Legacy: Longchamp\n* Retail Influencer: Kith\n* Retail Innovation: Westfield Corp.\n* Specialty Retailer: Story by Rachel Shechtman\n* Style Ambassador: Tracee Ellis Ross\n* Style Influencer: Micaela Erlanger\n2017\n* Brand of the Year: Loeffler Randall\n* Breakthrough Award: Kendra Scott\n* Business Leadership: The NPD Group\n* Business Visionary: Jason Rabin\n* Designer of the Year: Joseph Altuzarra\n* Legacy: Polaroid Eyewear\n* Retailer of the Year: Shopbop\n* Style Ambassador: Eva Longoria\n* Style Icon Award: Betsey Johnson\n* Style Influencer: Grandmaster Flash and Jeriana San Juan\n* Sustainability: PVH Corp.\n* Trailblazer: Monica Rich Kosann\n2016\n* Brand Launch: Paul Andrew\n* Brand of the Year: Ray-Ban\n* Brand Visionary: Sarah Jessica Parker\n* Business Leadership: Rosenthal & Rosenthal\n* Designer of the Year: Stuart Vevers\n* Humanitarian of the Year: Vera Bradley\n* Influencer: Jennifer Fisher\n* Media: Marie Claire\n* Retailer of the Year: Bergdorf Goodman\n* Trendsetter: MCM Worldwide\n* Sustainability: Kering\n* Style Influencers: Daniel Lawson & Julianna Margulies\n2015\n* Breakthrough Award: Ivanka Trump\n* Designer of the Year: John Varvatos\n* Evolution: Eddie Borgo\n* Influencers: Taraji P.
