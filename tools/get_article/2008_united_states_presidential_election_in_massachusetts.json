Bush\n| before_party = Republican Party (United States)\n| after_election = Barack Obama\n| after_party = Democratic Party (United States)\n}}\nThe 2008 United States presidential election in Massachusetts took place, as in all 50 states and D.C., as part of the 2008 United States presidential election of November 4, 2008. Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who, in turn, voted for the office of president and vice president.\nDemocratic Party nominee Barack Obama won the state by a 25.8% margin of victory: slightly better than John Kerry's 25.2% margin in 2004. Prior to the election, all 17 news organizations forecast that Obama would win Massachusetts, or otherwise considered it to be a safe blue state. Massachusetts had been a Democratic-leaning state since 1928, and a Democratic stronghold since 1960, and has maintained extremely large Democratic margins since 1996. No Republican presidential nominee has won a single county in the state, nor obtained more than 40% of the vote, since George H. W. Bush in 1988.[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/ Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections] In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama captured the state's 12 electoral votes winning 61.80% of the popular vote to Republican John McCain's 35.99%. Massachusetts was also 1 of only 6 states in which neither Obama nor McCain won during the primary season.\nTo date, this is the last time that the towns of Berkley, Brimfield, Brookfield, Carver, Dighton, Dudley, Holland, Oxford, Phillipston, Rehoboth, Spencer, and Warren voted Democratic.\nPrimaries\nDemocratic\n| image1 = Hillary_Rodham_Clinton-cropped.jpg\n| candidate1 = Hillary Clinton\n| party1 = Democratic Party (United States)\n| home_state1 = New York\n| popular_vote1 = 705,185\n| percentage1 = 56.01%\n| delegate_count1 = 55\n| image2 = BarackObama2005portrait.jpg\n| candidate2 = Barack Obama\n| party2 = Democratic Party (United States)\n| home_state2 = Illinois\n| popular_vote2 = 511,680\n| percentage2 = 40.64%\n| delegate_count2 = 38\n| map_image =\n| map_size =\n| map_caption =\n}}\nThe Massachusetts Democratic primary took place on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008, and had a total of 93 delegates at stake. The winner in each of Massachusetts's 10 congressional districts was awarded all of that district's delegates, totaling 61. Another 32 delegates were awarded to the statewide winner, Hillary Clinton. The 93 delegates represented Massachusetts at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. 26 other unpledged delegates, known as superdelegates, also attended the convention and cast their votes as well.\nPolls indicated that Clinton was leading Barack Obama in the days leading up to the contest in Massachusetts.\nHillary Rodham Clinton won a convincing victory in Massachusetts over Barack Obama due to a number of factors. According to exit polls, 85% of voters in the Massachusetts Democratic Primary were Caucasians and they opted for Clinton by a margin of 58–40% compared to the 6% of African American voters who backed Obama by a margin of 66–29. Hispanics/Latinos, which comprised 5% of the total voters, backed Clinton by a margin of 56–36%. Clinton narrowly won the youth vote (those ages 18–29) by a margin of 49–48 and tied the vote among voters ages 30–44; she also won all voters over the age of 45 by a margin of 60.5–38. Pertaining to socioeconomic class, Clinton won all levels of family income except highly affluent voters making $200,000 or more a year, as they backed Obama by a narrow margin of 53–47%. As for educational attainment levels, Clinton won all categories except those with postgraduate degrees who backed Obama by a margin of 51–47%. Among self-identified Democrats in the primary, which made up 65% of the total electorate, they went for Clinton by a 58–41 margin while Independents, which comprised a healthy 33% of the electorate, also went for Clinton by a 54–42 margin. She also won all ideological groups. Clinton also won most major religious denominations – Protestants 53–46; Roman Catholics 64–33; other Christians 51–47; and other religions 49–46. Obama won Jews by a margin of 52–48 as well as atheists/agnostics by a margin of 53–45.\nClinton performed extremely well statewide, carrying a majority of counties and sweeping most of the major urban areas and cities. Obama won Boston by fewer than 10,000 votes, while Clinton won other urban and conservative towns such as Springfield and Worcester.\nObama had picked up major endorsements from the Massachusetts Democratic establishment prior to Super Tuesday. Both U.S. Senators Ted Kennedy and John Kerry threw their support behind Obama, along with Governor Deval Patrick. Clinton also picked up a number of top-tier endorsements from Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Salvatore DiMasi along with U.S. Representatives Richard Neal and Barney Frank, one of the three openly gay members of the U.S. Congress.\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Party\n!

He won each by a double-digit margin since August 8. The final 3 polls averaged Obama leading 56% to 36%.[http://uselectionatlas.org/POLLS/PRESIDENT/2008/pollsa.php?fips=25 Election 2008 Polls - Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]\nFundraising\nJohn McCain raised $4,072,206 in the state. Barack Obama raised $24,358,264.\nAdvertising and visits\nObama spent $46,839 while the Republican ticket spent nothing. Neither campaign visited the state.\nAnalysis\nIn terms of voting in presidential elections, Massachusetts is one of the most heavily Democratic states in the nation. Massachusetts is ethnically diverse, highly educated, and less religious. The Bay State has voted for the Democratic presidential nominee in every election since 1960 except for Ronald Reagan's landslide victories of  1980 and 1984. In 1972, only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia voted for Democratic U.S. Senator George McGovern as Republican Richard M. Nixon won reelection.\nBarack Obama won the state's 12 electoral votes with 61.80% of the vote to John McCain's 35.99%. This is slightly higher than Kerry's victory in 2004. Despite that, 4 counties in the state trended away from the Democratic party: Bristol, Plymouth, Norfolk, and Worcester.\nBoth of Massachusetts's U.S. Senators and all 10 of its U.S. Representatives were Democrats, and Democrats held supermajorities in the Massachusetts Legislature. At the same time in 2008, incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry was reelected with 65.86% of the vote over Republican Jeff Beatty's 30.93% as were all of the state's delegates in the U.S. House of Representatives. At the state level, Democrats picked up three seats in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and one seat in the Massachusetts Senate.\nResults\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

the voters of Massachusetts cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Massachusetts is allocated 12 electors because it has 10 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 12 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 12 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.\nThe electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.\nThe following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 12 were pledged to Obama and Biden:\n# Brenda Brathwaite\n# Mary Ann Dube\n# Patricia Marcus\n# Faye Morrison\n# Carol Pacheco\n# Corinne Wingard\n# John Brissette\n# Raymond Jordan\n# Joe Kaplan\n# Melvin Poindexter\n# Samuel Poulten\n# Jason Whittet\nSee also\n* United States presidential elections in Massachusetts\n* 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries\nReferences"
