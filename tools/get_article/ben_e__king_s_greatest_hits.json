      "text": "# Ben E. King's Greatest Hits\n\n'Ben E. King's Greatest Hits' is the fifth album and first compilation album by Ben E. King.  Many classic hits such as \"Stand By Me\", \"Spanish Harlem\", \"I (Who Have Nothing)\", and others return on this compilation disc released in 1964.\nMany discographies do not note this work; however, Marv Goldberg's R&B Notebook References the album as being released before \"Seven Letters\".  A stereo version of this disc was re-issued in 1966.  Some of the songs, most notably, \"Don't Play That Song (You Lied),\" were released in alternate versions without explanation.\nTrack listing\n#\"That's When It Hurts\" [3:08]   (1964 single)\n#\"Auf Wiedersehen, My Dear\" [2:06]   (B-side of Tell Daddy [1962])\n#\"Around the Corner\" [2:51]   (B-side of 'That's When It Hurts' [1964])\n#\"Young Boy Blues\" [2:24]   (from the album ''Don't Play That Song)\n#\"What Now My Love\" [2:34]   (1964 single)\n#\"Stand By Me\" [2:44]   (from the album Don't Play That Song)\n#\"Amor\" [3:05]   (from the album Spanish Harlem'')\n#\"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\" [2:38]   (from the album ''Don't Play That Song.
