In its 22nd year at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, the main ceremony was broadcast on CBS and available to stream on Paramount+. It was preceded by the premiere ceremony at the Peacock Theater, starting at 12:30&nbsp;p.m. PT. Nominations were announced through a YouTube livestream on November 8, 2024. The South African comedian Trevor Noah hosted the ceremony for the fifth consecutive time.\nKendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" swept all five of its nominations, which included Record of the Year and Song of the Year, tying with \"Up, Up and Away\" to become the joint-most decorated song in Grammy Awards history. He became the second rap artist to win both awards, after Childish Gambino in 2019. Beyoncé received the most nominations at the ceremony with eleven and won three awards, including Album of the Year and Best Country Album for Cowboy Carter. She became the first Black artist to win Best Country Album and the first Black woman to win Album of the Year since Lauryn Hill in 1999. Chappell Roan took home Best New Artist, and Sierra Ferrell swept the American roots categories, winning all four of her nominations. Best New Artist nominee Doechii won Best Rap Album for Alligator Bites Never Heal, becoming the third woman to win the award after Hill (with the Fugees) in 1997 and Cardi B in 2019. Other three-time winners included Charli XCX and St. Vincent. Other artists that led nominations included Charli XCX and Post Malone with eight each, and Kendrick Lamar and Billie Eilish with seven each.\nBackground\nFor the 2025 ceremony, the Recording Academy announced several changes for different categories and updates on eligibility rules. No new categories were introduced for the first time in four years. In an urgent letter to the 12,000 voting members of the Recording Academy, chief executive officer (CEO) Harvey Mason Jr. urged them to cast their votes with \"purpose, intention, and integrity\" and without \"bias, grudge-holding, or careless voting\".\nDiscussions were held to either postpone the ceremony and all of its ancillary events or pivot the broadcast to a fundraiser due to the series of wildfires affecting Southern California. In a joint statement, Mason Jr. and Tammy Hurt, the chair of the Recording Academy's board of trustees, confirmed that the ceremony would proceed as planned \"in close coordination with local authorities to ensure public safety and responsible use of area resources.\" This edition, however, carried a \"renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\"\nDuring the broadcast, some commercial airtime was donated to help small businesses affected by the wildfires. Host Trevor Noah announced this initiative and special guests appeared in the commercials. Featured businesses included Orla Floral Studio of Altadena with an appearance by Doja Cat, Two Dragons Martial Arts of Altadena with an appearance by Charlie Puth, Rhythms Of The Village of Altadena with an appearance by Anderson .Paak, Paliskates Skate Shop in Pacific Palisades with an appearance by Avril Lavigne, and the L.A. Lost Stuffy Project with an appearance by the Jonas Brothers.\nAdditionally, high school choir students from Pasadena Waldorf School in Altadena and Palisades Charter High School in the Pacific Palisades, both of which were damaged in the wildfires, sang backup vocals during the Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock performance of \"We Are the World.\"\nCategory changes\n* Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical was moved from the Production, Engineering, Composition & Arrangement Field to the Pop & Dance/Electronic Field.\n* Best Pop Dance Recording was renamed to Best Dance Pop Recording.\n* Best Dance/Electronic Music Album was renamed to Best Dance/Electronic Album. Its category criteria was amended to establish that albums must consist of at least 50% Dance/Electronic recordings to qualify.\n* Conjunto music will now be recognized under Best Regional Roots Music Album, instead of Best Música Mexicana Album (Including Tejano).\n* Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media was amended to establish a qualification that more than 50% of the music on an otherwise eligible recording must be derived from new episodes or new programming released during the Grammy eligibility year for which it entered.\n* Best Song for Social Change, a Special Merit Award, was renamed to the Harry Belafonte Best Song for Social Change Award. It will now be recognized as a CEO's Merit Award, with the finalists and recipients selected annually by a committee composed of a community of peers dedicated to \"artistic expression, the craft of songwriting, and the power of songs to affect social change.\"\nCriteria amendments\n* All eligibly-certified featured artists with less than 50% of playing time will be awarded a Winners' Certificate for all genre album categories. This rule does not apply to Best Musical Theater Album or the General Field and Craft categories.\n* The annual fee media companies must pay to enter a recording in the online entry process was increased to $180.\n* Criteria for Best Traditional R&B Performance was amended to \"more accurately represent recordings that embody the classical elements of R&B/soul music, distinguishing them from contemporary interpretations of the genre.\"\n* Criteria for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album was amended to expand the category by \"broadening its scope and welcoming more entries from the musical theater community.\" Its album eligibility criteria was also updated, requiring that albums must contain more than 75% of newly recorded (previously unreleased) performances.\n* Criteria for Best Children's Music Album was amended with a requirement for lyrics and English-language translations to be included in entry submissions. An intended audience range was also defined as \"infant to 12 years old\".\n* Submission guidelines for Songwriter of the Year, Non-Classical were amended with the hopes of allowing a \"wider representation of the songwriter community\", with the minimum submission threshold in which a songwriter is credited as a songwriter or co-writer (not a primary or featured artist or producer) being reduced from five to four songs. The additional number of songs a songwriter may enter in which they are also credited as a primary or featured artist, or any other supporting role was also increased from four to five.\nPerformers\nPremiere ceremony\nPerformers for the premiere ceremony were announced on January 29, 2025.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+List of performers at the premiere ceremony\n! scope=\"col\" |Artist(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Song(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Yolanda AdamsWayne BradyDeborah CoxScott HoyingAngélique KidjoTaj Mahal\n| \"Bridge over Troubled Water\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Joe Bonamassa\n| \"Twenty-Four Hour Blues\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Muni Long\n| \"Made for Me\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Béla Fleck\n| \"Rhapsody in Blue\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Joyce DiDonatoRenée FlemingKelli O'HaraKevin Puts\n| \"All Along\"\n|}\nMain ceremony\nThe first batch of main ceremony performers, which included Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Charli XCX, and Sabrina Carpenter, were announced on January 24, 2025.

The nominees were announced by Brandy Clark, Kirk Franklin, David Frost, Robert Gordon, Kylie Minogue, Victoria Monét, Gaby Moreno, Deanie Parker, Mark Ronson, Ben Platt, and Hayley Williams on November 8 in a livestream on the official Grammy YouTube channel. Final round voting then took place from December 12, 2024, to January 3, 2025, ahead of when the winners were revealed during the Grammy Premiere Ceremony and telecast on February 2.\nBeyoncé received the most nominations with eleven, which set a new one-year record for nominations by a female artist. She previously shared the record with Lauryn Hill, who earned 10 nominations at the 1999 ceremony, and matched it herself in 2010. With a career total of 99 nominations, Beyoncé became the most nominated artist in Grammy history, breaking a tie with her husband Jay-Z. Taylor Swift is the first woman to earn seven career nominations for Album of the Year with The Tortured Poets Department. \"Now and Then\" by the Beatles is the first song produced with the help of artificial intelligence to be nominated for a Grammy. Anitta's Funk Generation is the first funk carioca album to be nominated for a Grammy. Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan became the fourteenth and fifteenth artists in history who have earned Grammy nominations in all four main General Field categories in one night. Charli XCX and Post Malone were added to the nominees for Best Recording Package for their respective albums on December 20. At 100 years of age, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter became the oldest nominee ever; he won Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording for the fourth time, more than any other recipient to date, which would have made him the oldest winner ever if not for his death in December 2024.\nWinners appear first and highlighted in bold.\nGeneral Field\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" colspan=\"2\" width=\"50%\" |\n* \"Not Like Us\" – Kendrick Lamar\n** Sean Momberger, Mustard & Sounwave, producers; Ray Charles Brown Jr. & Johnathan Turner, engineers/mixers; Nicolas de Porcel, mastering engineer\n* \"Now and Then\" – The Beatles\n** Giles Martin & Paul McCartney, producers; Geoff Emerick, Steve Genewick, Jon Jacobs, Greg McAllister, Steve Orchard, Keith Smith, Mark \"Spike\" Stent & Bruce Sugar, engineers/mixers; Miles Showell, mastering engineer\n* \"Texas Hold 'Em\" – Beyoncé\n** Beyoncé, Nathan Ferraro, Killah B & Raphael Saadiq, producers; Hotae Alexander Jang, Alex Nibley & Stuart White, engineers/mixers; Colin Leonard, mastering engineer\n* \"Espresso\" – Sabrina Carpenter\n** Julian Bunetta, producer; Julian Bunetta & Jeff Gunnell, engineers/mixers; Nathan Dantzler, mastering engineer.\n* \"360\" – Charli XCX\n** Cirkut & A.
