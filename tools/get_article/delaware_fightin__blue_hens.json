The Blue Hens compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of Conference USA.\nOn November 28, 2023, UD and Conference USA (CUSA) jointly announced that UD would start a transition to the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in 2024 and join CUSA in 2025. UD continued to compete in both sides of the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA) in 2024–25; it was ineligible for the FCS playoffs due to NCAA rules for transitioning programs, but was eligible for all non-football CAA championships. Upon joining CUSA, UD has become eligible for all conference championship events except the football championship game; it will become eligible for that event upon completing the FBS transition in 2026. At the same time, UD also announced it would add one women's sport due to Title IX considerations, and would also be seeking conference homes for the seven sports that UD sponsors but CUSA does not. The new women's sport would later be announced as ice hockey; UD eventually joined Atlantic Hockey America for its first season of varsity play in 2025–26.\nSports sponsored\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; ; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n! width= px style=\"\"| Men's sports\n! width= px style=\"\"| Women's sports\n|-\n| Baseball || Basketball\n|-\n| Basketball || Cross country\n|-\n| Football || Field hockey\n|-\n| Golf || Golf\n|-\n|Lacrosse\n|Ice hockey\n|-\n| Soccer || Lacrosse\n|-\n| Swimming and diving || Rowing\n|-\n| Tennis || Soccer\n|-\n| || Softball\n|-\n| || Swimming and diving\n|-\n| || Tennis\n|-\n| || Track and field†\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" |\n|}\nThe Blue Hens have won twenty-two team CAA Championships since joining in 2001.\nIn January 2011, UD announced that men's cross country and outdoor track & field teams would be reclassified to club status, while women's golf would be added.\nOn November 20, 2016, the Delaware women's field hockey team won the 2016 NCAA Division I championship, defeating North Carolina, 3–2, under head coach Rolf van de Kerkhof.\nWomen's basketball\nThe 2000–01 Delaware team finished 26–5 overall and 17–1 in the America East Conference (where they were members from 1991 to 2001, before joining the CAA), and finished first in the regular season and won the conference tournament to qualify for their first NCAA bid.

However, by that time, CHA had already announced plans to merge with the men-only Atlantic Hockey Association after the 2023–24 season. In March 2024, Allison Coomey was named the inaugural head coach.
