Snoop Dogg was the event's host for the first time. Kendrick Lamar leads the nominations with 14. Drake had the second most at 13, while J. Cole picked up 10 nods. Kendrick Lamar won the most awards with 5 wins.\nThere was some controversy as Toronto battle rapper Charron won Freestyle Friday's March Mayhem Tournament, which guaranteed him a spot in the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards cypher as one of the prizes for his victory. However, once it came time to film the cyphers, Charron was excluded. He responded with the \"BET Cypher Verse\" where he disses BET, Murda Mook, Gucci Mane, Soulja Boy, Lil Twist, Rick Ross, Kendrick Lamar and Chief Keef, among others.\nPerformances\n* \"Dreams and Nightmares\"/\"Levels\" – Meek Mill\n* \"Act Right\"/\"U.O.E.N.O.\"/\"Type of Way\" – Yo Gotti, Rocko & Rich Homie Quan\n* \"Fork\"/\"Go DJ\"/\"Used 2\"/\"Back That Azz Up\" – 2 Chainz feat.
