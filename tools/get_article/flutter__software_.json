It can be used to develop cross platform applications from a single codebase for the web, Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. First described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017. Flutter is used internally by Google in apps such as Google Pay and Google Earth as well as by other software developers including ByteDance and Alibaba.\nFlutter ships applications with its own rendering engine which directly outputs pixel data to the screen. This is in contrast to many other UI frameworks that rely on the target platform to provide a rendering engine, such as native Android apps which rely on the device-level Android SDK or IOS SDK which use the target platform's built-in UI stack. Flutter's control of its rendering pipeline simplifies multi-platform support as identical UI code can be used for all target platforms.\nArchitecture\nThe basic component in a Flutter program is a \"widget\", which can in turn consist of other widgets. A widget describes the logic, interaction, and design of a UI element with an implementation similar to React. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits such as React Native and Xamarin which draw widgets using native platform components, Flutter renders widgets itself on a per-pixel basis. Flutter has two types of widgets: stateless and stateful. Stateless widgets only update if their inputs change, meaning they otherwise won't need to be rebuilt when other elements of the screen change, while stateful widgets can call the setState() method to update an internal state and redraw. Although widgets are the primary method of constructing Flutter applications, they can also be bypassed in favor of directly drawing on a canvas. This feature has been occasionally used to implement game engines in Flutter.\nThe Flutter framework contains two sets of widgets that conform to specific design languages: Material Design widgets implement Google's design language of the same name, and Cupertino widgets implement Apple's iOS Human interface guidelines. Flutter allows the developer to use either set of widgets on either platform. Developers can use Cupertino widgets on Android.\nFlutter apps are written in the Dart language. Release versions of Flutter apps on all platforms use ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation except for on the Web where code is transpiled to JavaScript or WebAssembly. Flutter inherits Dart's [https://pub.dev Pub] package manager and software repository, which allows users to publish and use custom packages as well as Flutter-specific plugins. The Foundation library, written in Dart, provides basic classes and functions that are used to construct applications using Flutter, such as APIs to communicate with the engine.\nFlutter's engine, written primarily in C++, provides low-level rendering support using either Google's Skia graphics library or the custom \"Impeller\" graphics layer, which is enabled by default on iOS and Android API 29 and higher. The engine interfaces with platform-specific SDKs such as those provided by Android and iOS to implement features like accessibility, file and network I/O, native plugin support, etc.\nHistory\nThe first version of Flutter was known as \"Sky\" and ran on the Android operating system. It was unveiled at the 2015 Dart developer summit with the stated intent of being able to render consistently at 120 frames per second. On December 4, 2018, Flutter 1.0 was released at the Flutter conference in London.\nOn May 6, 2020, the Dart software development kit (SDK) version 2.8 and Flutter 1.17.0 were released, adding support for the Metal API.\nOn March 3, 2021, Google released Flutter 2 during an online Flutter Engage event. It added a Canvas-based renderer for web in addition to the HTML-based renderer and early-access desktop application support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It also shipped with Dart 2.0 which included support for null-safety. Null safety was initially optional as it was a breaking change and was made mandatory in Dart 3 released in 2023.\nOn May 12, 2022, Flutter 3 and Dart 2.17 were released with support for all desktop platforms as stable.\nOn October 27, 2024, a number of Flutter community developers announced Flock, a fork of Flutter intended to be easier to contribute to while still keeping in sync with all changes made in the upstream code base.\nMajor releases in Flutter\nPrior to the Flutter 2.0 release in March of 2021, the Flutter framework was centered on mobile development. The developers of Flutter were primarily focused on the two main platforms, IOS and Android. Specifically, they wanted to deliver strong performance and improve access to native API and platform features and expand the widget system.\nWith the release of Flutter 2.0, the framework moved beyond mobile and introduced support for the web platform. This marked a shift into a broader cross platform development environment. With this release, developers could produce applications for Web, Android and IOS from the same codebase. This release also brought the desktop platform closer to stable.\nThere have been a number of improvements since then that have broadened platform support. They introduced enhancements to performance and workflow, redefined the developer’s toolkit, and added an improved rendering engine.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Version\n!Date\n!Major Additions\n|-\n|2.0.0\n|Mar 3, 2021\n|Web stable; desktop beta; null-safety\n|-\n|2.2.0\n|May 18, 2021\n|Performance; desktop tooling progress\n|-\n|2.10.0\n|Feb 3, 2022\n|Windows stable\n|}\n# \"Flutter 2.10.0 release notes\". docs.flutter.dev.
