Since the Declaration of Independence was issued on 24 August 1991, and confirmed by the referendum of 1 December 1991, the date of the holiday was changed.\nLegal framework (1990–1992)\nOn 16 July 1990, the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, which initially led to 16 July being designated as Independence Day in Ukrainian law.\nAfter the Act of Declaration of Independence was proclaimed on 24 August 1991 and confirmed by the nationwide referendum on 1 December 1991, the holiday's date was moved to 24 August by a subsequent parliamentary decision in 1992.\nTraditions\nIn 2013 the holiday was not particularly popular amongst the Ukrainian audience, in fact it was one of the least popular of the public holidays of Ukraine – only 12% considered it important or favorite. In 2021 this figure had grown to 37%.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine that started on 24 February 2022, led to a reappraisal of the popularity of Independence Day in Ukraine. A March 2024 study by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that the popularity of Independence Day of Ukraine and Defenders Day had both  almost more than doubled (from 37% to 64% and from 29% to 58%).\nPublic opinion\nPublic perception of Independence Day in Ukraine has shifted significantly over the decades.\nIn a 2013 poll by the Razumkov Centre, 61% of respondents considered it a holiday, 30.4% saw it as \"not a holiday, but an ordinary day off\", and 6.1% believed it should be a working day.\nBy 2021, a Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) survey found that 37% of Ukrainians considered Independence Day their favourite or one of their favourite holidays.\nFollowing the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, the same KIIS study in March 2024 recorded a sharp rise in popularity — 64% named it among their favourite holidays, alongside Defenders Day (58%).\nNational Flag Day\nBeginning in 2004, 23 August is celebrated as National Flag Day.[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-08/23/c_131803737.htm Ukraine celebrates National Flag Day] , Xinhua News Agency (23 August 2012)[http://www.kyivpost.com/content/kyiv/ceremony-of-hoisting-ukraines-national-flag-held-a-111423.html Ceremony of hoisting Ukraine's national flag held at presidential administration], Kyiv Post (23 August 2011)\nParade\nGenerally, but not every year, independence day is celebrated with a military parade held in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.[https://books.google.com/books?id=sVoxBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA352 Theoretical and Comparative Perspectives on Nationalism] by Taras Kuzio, ibidem Press, 2007,  (352)[https://books.google.com/books?id=jeE3BAAAQBAJ&dq=%22Independence+Day%22+Kiev+%22military+parade%22&pg=PA102 Language Policy and Discourse on Languages in Ukraine Under President Viktor Yanukovych] by Michael Moser, ibidem Press, 2013,  (page 102)[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37177897 Ukraine military parade marks 25 years of independence], BBC News (24 August 2016) In 2021, a military parade was held on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Ukraine's Independence. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, no military parade has taken place. However, to mark the 2023 Independence Day, destroyed Russian tanks and military vehicles were lined up in central Kyiv.\nCelebrations\nChronology\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Year !!

It featured flypasts by personnel of the Ukrainian Air Force. The parade was attended by President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma and Minister of Defense Oleksandr Kuzmuk.\n2006\nNational celebrations of Ukraine's 15th Independence Day was postponed from 24 August to 26 August, as a three-day period of mourning was held following the deadly crash of Pulkovo Aviation Enterprise Flight 612 that occurred 22 August 2006. The crash in Donetsk Oblast killed 170, and was the deadliest aircraft incident in Ukraine until Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014.\n2016\nAfter the annual military parade in Kyiv the \"March of the Unconquered\" was held by active members of Ukraine's volunteer battalions, relatives of those killed during the fighting in the Russo-Ukrainian War and family members of those killed during the Euromaidan uprising – known in Ukraine as the \"Heavenly Hundred\". According to the Ukrainian army the volume of artillery fire set off by the separatist forces of the war in Donbas during the 24-hour period of 24 August 2016 was the highest since the February 2015 Battle of Debaltseve.\nSeveral Ukrainian cities held marches of people dressed in vyshyvanky (shirts with traditional Ukrainian embroidery).\n2019\nbattle flag.]]\nOn 10 July 2019, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Facebook that the 2019 Ukrainian Independence Day celebrations will not include a military parade (for the first time since the parade's cancellation from 2010 to 2014) stating the following: \"We have decided to allocate 300 mln hryvnias [nearly $12 mln] as bonus payments to our servicemen, i.e. fixed-term soldiers, cadets, sergeants, officers.\" Zelenskyy also mentioned that the government would take steps to \"honor heroes\" on Independence Day by highlighting the fact that the \"format will be new\". On 30 July, Zelenskyy's Head of the Presidential Administration Andriy Bohdan announced that a March of Dignity (Марш гідності) will take place in replacement of the annual parade. A separate march, known as the March of Defenders (Марш захисників) was also planned to be held by Ukrainian war veterans. The ceremony went on as planned and even incorporated elements of the annual parade such as the flag raising ceremony and the awarding of veterans. During his speech, Zelenskyy called for unity, saying \"Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking, regardless of age, gender, religion – we must be one people\".\n2020\nof Donbas veterans suspected of killing journalist Pavel Sheremet during the 2020 March of Defenders]]\nIn an Independence Day speech in 2020 President Zelenskyy said that there would never be military equipment on parade in Kyiv as long as the war in Donbas is ongoing, during which he said that it is \"Where it is needed now.\" Zelensky stated that military parades would be held in the future \"a parade of Ukrainian victory, when we will return all our people and all our territories.\"\nThe joint concert of Ukrainian stars following the ceremony was marked by scandal because various artists performing in it had continued to perform and/or accept awards in Russia, despite the Ukrainian Autonomous Republic of Crimea being annexed by Russia in 2014 and the alleged support of Russia for the separatist forces of the war in Donbas. It was also condemned that this concert took place during the March of Defenders (Марш захисників) commemorating the victims of the war in Donbas.\nIn an English language Independence Day address, Zelenskyy launched an information campaign to restart the Ukraine NOW brand.\n2021\nIn 2021, Ukraine celebrated the 30th anniversary of its independence with three days of events. A company from Lviv developed a special 30th Anniversary logo and a new award known as the \"National Legend\" was announced, to be presented in a ceremony on 22 August. It was also announced that the first Summit of the Crimean Platform would take place on 23 August. A number of foreign leaders were invited to the 30th anniversary celebrations, including US president Joe Biden, Greek president Katerina Sakellaropoulou, Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda and Moldovan president Maia Sandu.\nOn 24 August a large military parade made its way through Kyiv past Maidan Nezalezhnosti, featuring Ukrainian Ground Forces, Special Operations Forces, and visiting units from several foreign armed forces. The parade included more than 5000 troops and 400 tanks and armoured vehicles. The event also included a fly-by of Ukrainian Air Force units over Kyiv. Simultaneously, Ukrainian Navy units were shown carrying out exercises at Odesa. Visiting troops from Slovenia, Moldova, Poland, the United States of America and Canada marched with Ukrainian forces, and two British Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons took part in the fly-by alongside four F-16 Fighting Falcons.\nDelegates from 46 countries attended, including Polish President Andrzej Duda, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, and Eastern Orthodox Church patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople.\nImmediately prior to the parade, President Zelenskyy addressed the crowd, calling for closer relationships with other ex-Soviet countries, European nations, and NATO.\n2022\nspeaking on Independence Day 2022.]]\nIndependence Day in 2022 marked the sixth month since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia began.

Officials warned civilians against gathering in major cities, with President Zelenskyy stating \"Russia may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel.\" Russia would attack on the day of anniversary, shelling a civilian train in Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, killing 25. The Russian defense ministry claimed it had targeted a military train using a single Iskander missile, and that the attack had successfully killed 200 Ukrainian soldiers.\nIn Kyiv, the Kyiv Independence Day Parade was cancelled for its tenth time as resources were directed to the war effort. Kyiv City Hall stated online \"This year Ukraine celebrates the anniversary of independence in terms of martial law and under the threat of possible shelling. Mass events are prohibited, because the enemy is unpredictable, so we have to be prepared for any scenario.\" In place of a parade, numerous Russian military vehicles and artilleries destroyed by Ukrainian troops were displayed along Khreshchatyk, where Zelenskyy issued a speech commemorating the anniversary and advocating for Ukrainian victory.
