Under the name of 207th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home) it was initially composed of newly raised infantry battalions from the North of England.\nService\nEarly in its service the brigade came under the administrative control 18th Infantry Division (2 November 1940 – 16 February 1941), and then became an integral part of Essex County Division from its formation until disbandment on 7 October 1941, when the brigade was renamed the 207th Independent Infantry Brigade. However, the brigade's battalions had all left in the previous August for conversion to Royal Armoured Corps regiments for service in India.
