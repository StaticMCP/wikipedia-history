Shiva is worshipped as Atulya Nadheswarar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Azhagiya Ponnazhagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.\nThe temple complex covers two acres, built on a granite hill and it houses a seven tier gateway tower known as gopurams. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Atulya Nadheswarar and his consort Azhagiya Ponnazhagi being the most prominent.\nThe temple has four daily rituals at various times from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:30&nbsp;p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Brahmotsavam festival celebrated during Vaikasi (May–June) is the most prominent festival.\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by Pallavas, with later expansion by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built during the Vijayanagara Empire during the 16th century. There are three rock-cut caves from the Pallava regime during the 10th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nLegend\nAs per Hindu legend, Vishnu wanted to propitiate the sins caused by slaying Mahabali during Vamana avatar. He prayed Shiva for the same at various Shiva temples. His sins were cleared while worshipping Shiva. There is an image of Vishnu in a sculpture showing the legend. As per another legend, Sambandar, the 7th century Saiva saint Nayanmar, visited the place and sung praises of Atulya Natheswarar. The temple was locked down earlier by Jain monks and was believed to have been brought to worship practises after Sambandar. He was planning to go to Tiruvannamalai, but was stopped by a divine force. He set up Annamalaiyar as Lingam in this place and started worshiping. It is believed that Samndar's foot steps are seen at the place and the Annamalaiyar Temple at Tiruvannamali can be viewed from the point. Arai indicates rock while ani indicates beauty – since Shiva appears beautifully over the rock, the presiding deity of the temple is called Araiyanitheeswarar, which is Sankritised version of Atulya Nadheswarar.\nHistory\nThe original complex is believed to have been built by Pallavas, with later expansion by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built during the Vijayanagara Empire during the 16th century.
