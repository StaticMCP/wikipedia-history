From 1861 to 1881 he served as the Rabbi of Beregszasz, Hungary and then until 1883 in his native town of Mad. He was an active participant in the rabbinical gathering in Nagymihaly in 1866 and at the congress held in Budapest in 1869.\nAlthough Rabbi Schwartz studied in the Pressburg Yeshiva whose leaders were opposed to Hasidism, he became deeply attached to Hasidism after a visit he made to Chaim Halberstam, the founder of the Sanz hasidic dynasty.\nHis son Naftali Schwartz (1843–1896) succeeded him as rav of Mád.\nSchwartz wrote only one work titled Kol Aryeh, but its influence on the rabbis of Hungary was great. One of his great-grandchildren, Dov Ber Spitzer (son-in-law of Chaim Zvi Ehrenreich (1875-1936), Rabbi of Mad from 1932 to 1936), wrote his biography, published under the title Toldos Kol Aryeh (1940). See also \"Hakol Aryeh\", circa 2004.\nReferences\n*\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160604202405/http://www.hebrewbooks.org/1113  Hebrew biography]"
