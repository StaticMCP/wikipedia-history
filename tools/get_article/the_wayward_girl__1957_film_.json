It was released on September 22, 1957 by Republic Pictures.\nPlot\nA girl is erroneously convicted of manslaughter in the death of her oppressive stepmother's boyfriend, when in fact the stepmother killed him after the girl had knocked him out. Henderson gains release from prison via a parole-for-pay scheme of which she is unaware. She gets into more trouble when the man for whom she works makes advances and she runs away after injuring him. By the end of the film, the parole racket has been exposed, and Henderson has been exonerated of the murder.\nCast\n*Marcia Henderson as Judy Wingate\n*Peter Walker as Tommy Gray\n*Katherine Barrett as Frances Wingate\n*Whit Bissell as Ira Molson\n*Rita Lynn as Midge Brackett\n*Peg Hillias as Hilda Carlson\n*Tracey Roberts as Dot Martin\n*Ray Teal as Sheriff\n*Barbara Eden as Molly\n*Ric Roman as Eddie Nolan\n*Grandon Rhodes as Dist.
