It encompassed several townships and chapelries, including the then township of Manchester (now Manchester city centre). Other townships are now parts of the Anglican Diocese of Manchester and/or Greater Manchester.\nIn the Domesday Book the parish of Manchester is recorded as including St Michael's Church in Ashton-under-Lyne as well as the mother church of St Mary's in Manchester. Although by the 13th century Ashton had formed its own separate parish, the advowson was held by Manchester as late as 1458.\nTownships\nIn 1866 the townships became recognised as separate civil parishes. Part, but not all, of this area was in the municipal borough of Manchester, which expanded with the decades.
