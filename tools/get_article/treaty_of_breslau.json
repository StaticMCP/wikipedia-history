Several attempts to expel the invaders failed, while troops of Frederick's allies France, Saxony and Bavaria even campaigned in the adjacent Bohemian lands.\nin 1744, Royal Prussia with Netze District during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Mansfeld in 1780]]\nSecret peace negotiations had been carried on since fall 1741, yet still Frederick invaded Bohemia and defeated the Austrian troops at the Battle of Chotusitz on 17 May 1742. By the agency of John Carmichael, 3rd Earl of Hyndford (mocked as Hundsfott, \"scoundrel\" by Frederick), envoy of the British, which was eager to prevent further war in Europe, a peace was concluded.\nContent\nBased on the terms of the treaty, Maria Theresa ceded most of the Silesian duchies to Prussia except for the Duchy of Teschen, the districts of Troppau and Krnov south of the Opava river as well as the southern part of the Duchy of Nysa, that were all to become the province of Austrian Silesia. Furthermore, Frederick annexed the Bohemian County of Kladsko.\nDespite the popular name of the treaty, it was actually signed in Berlin. This treaty, along with the Treaty of Berlin signed on 28 July 1742, officially ended the First Silesian War. Except for the partition of Cieszyn Silesia and the incorporation of the Hlučín Region in 1920, the 1742 demarcation line today still determines the border of the Czech Republic with Poland.\nSee also\n* Treaty of Trentschin\n* Treaty of Namslau\n* Treaty of Hubertusburg\n* History of Silesia\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Lodge, Sir Richard.
