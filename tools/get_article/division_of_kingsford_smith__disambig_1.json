It is located south and south-east of the Sydney CBD, comprising most of the City of Randwick and Bayside Council. It is currently represented by Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite.\nHistory\n, the division's namesake]]\nThe division is named after Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, a pioneer aviator, who was the first pilot to fly across the Pacific Ocean. The Kingsford Smith International Airport (Sydney International), and the suburb of Kingsford, both of which are located within the division, are also named after him. The division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 11 May 1949, and was first contested at the 1949 federal election.\nKingsford Smith has been in Labor hands for its entire existence. However, demographic changes since 2010 have made the seat much less secure for Labor. It has previously been held by Lionel Bowen, a minister in the Whitlam government, Deputy Leader of the Labor Party from 1977 to 1990, and Deputy Prime Minister for most of the Hawke government, and by Laurie Brereton, a minister in the Keating government. It was then held by Peter Garrett, a former lead singer of the Australian rock band Midnight Oil, former President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, and a minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments. Garrett announced his retirement on 26 June 2013.\nThe Division was originally known as the Division of Kingsford-Smith (with a hyphen), based upon a misspelling of Sir Charles's surname. However, this was corrected at the redistribution in 2001.\nThe current Member for Kingsford Smith, since the 2013 federal election, is Matt Thistlethwaite, a member of the Australian Labor Party who resigned from the Senate prior to the election.\nGeography\nThe division is located to the south and south-east of Sydney CBD, on the north shore of Botany Bay, and the coast of the Tasman Sea. The division includes the suburbs of Banksmeadow, Botany, Brighton-Le-Sands, Chifley, Daceyville, East Botany, Eastgardens, Eastlakes, Hillsdale, Kensington, Kingsford, Kyeemagh, La Perouse, Little Bay, Malabar, Maroubra, Maroubra Junction, Mascot, Matraville, Monterey, Pagewood, Phillip Bay, Port Botany, Ramsgate Beach and South Coogee; along with parts of Coogee, Randwick and Rosebery. Bare Island, Prince Henry Hospital, Sydney Airport and the University of New South Wales are also located in the electorate.\nSince 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state's representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.\nMembers\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Image\n!
