The bridge is mainly used for commercial purposes by the AJ Hackett Bungy Company for bungy jumping - the world's first commercial bungy jumping site. The bridge carries walkers, runners and bikers on the Queenstown Trail over the river.\nLocation\nThe bridge is in a Department of Conservation reserve, between the start of the Crown Range Road and Gibbston in the Kawarau Gorge within the Wakatipu Basin. It is  above the Kawarau River.\nHistory\nThe bridge was designed by Harry Higginson. The bridge was completed in late 1880 as a key access route to the Central Otago goldfields. Traffic was moved to a new highway bridge on State Highway 6 in 1963.\nThe suspension bridge is classified by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place. Today, it is a tourist attraction with commercialised ziplines and bungee jumping.\nName\nThe bridge's many names include the Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge, Kawarau Suspension Bridge, Kawarau bridge, Kawarau Bungy Bridge. The Civil Aviation Authority refers to the bridge as Bungy Bridge, which serves as a reporting point for general aviation aircraft approaching Queenstown Airport.\nGallery\nKawarau River Bridge, 2008-12-30.jpg|View of the old suspension bridge above the Kawarau River\nKawarau Bridge NZ7 3191 (40057608173).jpg|The old Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge\nKawarau Bridge NZ7 3179 (40057608793).jpg|Bungee jumping from the old Kawarau Gorge Suspension Bridge\nReferences"
