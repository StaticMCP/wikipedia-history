According to director Ian Barry, the film had a troubled production with Barry commenting:\nRobo Warriors added a new dimension to Murphy’s Law; everything that could go wrong DID go wrong. From bribes, standover threats, feuding film family fisticuffs on set, to you name it. Everything was by the seat of the pants.\nThe visual effects and miniatures were created by Stargate Films under the direction of Sam Nicholson. Unlike prior follow-ups to Robot Jox such as Crash and Burn and Robot Wars which used stop motion provided by David W. Allen to bring to life their giant robot effects, Robo Warriors utilized suit performers to bring the robots to life.\nRelease\nRobo Warriors was released direct-to-video in the United States on August 25, 1998. The film was released on Blu-ray by Vinegar Syndrome in 2025.\nReception\nSee also\n*Robot Wars\n*Crash and Burn\n*Robot Jox\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
