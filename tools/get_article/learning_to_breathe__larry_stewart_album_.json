The final solo album of his career, it was released in 1999 on Windham Hill Records. \"Still in Love\", the only single, failed to chart. \"Summer in the City\" is a cover of a single originally recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful. After the album's release, Stewart rejoined Restless Heart in 2003, and has been a member since.\nStephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album three stars out of five in Allmusic, saying that he considered it to have a more adult contemporary radio-format sound than a country sound, but referring to Stewart's voice as \"smooth [and] robust.\"\nTrack listing\n#\"Take This Heart\" (Larry Stewart, John Bettis, R.C.
