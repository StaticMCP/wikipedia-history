The CMT Flameworthy Awards were a fan-voted awards show for country music videos and television performance.\nBackground\nThe network, CMT, decided to rework their dated TNN/CMT Country Weekly Music Awards in to a new Award show, styled similarly to the MTV Video Music Awards. CMT asked fans to vote for what music videos they deem \"Flameworthy\" for the launch of country music's first ever video music awards. CMT stated \"Flameworthy recognizes music videos' unique ability to make a lasting impact -- viewers hear it, see it, feel it, love it -- and it becomes flameworthy\".\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are shown in bold.(nominees styled with \"Flameworthy\" before each title)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" |Video of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" |Female Video of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Kenny Chesney — \"Young\"\n** Brooks & Dunn — \"Only in America\"\n** Willie Nelson and Lee Ann Womack — \"Mendocino County Line\"\n** Travis Tritt — \"Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde\"\n** Toby Keith —\"I Wanna Talk About Me\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Martina McBride — \"Blessed\"\n** Sara Evans —\"Saints & Angels\"\n** Jo Dee Messina —\"Bring on the Rain\"\n** Faith Hill —\"There You'll Be\"\n** Dolly Parton —\"Shine\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Male Video of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Group/Duo Video of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Kenny Chesney — \"Young\"\n** Trace Adkins — \"I'm Tryin'\"\n** Toby Keith —\"I Wanna Talk About Me\"\n** Tim McGraw — \"The Cowboy in Me\"\n** Alan Jackson — \"Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Brooks & Dunn — \"Only in America\"\n** Montgomery Gentry — \"Cold One Comin' On\"\n** Alison Krauss & Union Station — \"The Lucky One\"\n** Nickel Creek — \"The Lighthouse's Tale\"\n** Lonestar — \"I'm Already There\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Breakthrough Video of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Video Collaboration of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Chris Cagle — \"I Breathe In, I Breathe Out\"\n** Cyndi Thomson — \"What I Really Meant to Say\"\n** Carolyn Dawn Johnson — \"Complicated\"\n** Keith Urban — \"Where the Blacktop Ends\"\n** Rascal Flatts — \"I'm Movin' On\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Willie Nelson and Lee Ann Womack — \"Mendocino County Line\"\n** Clint Black and Lisa Hartman Black — \"Easy for Me to Say\"\n** Earl Scruggs and Friends — \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\"\n** Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood — \"Squeeze Me In\"\n** Trisha Yearwood and Don Henley — \"Inside Out\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Concept Video of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Hottest Video of the Year\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Brad Paisley — \"'''I'm Gonna Miss Her'''\"\n** Toby Keith — \"My List\"\n** Travis Tritt — \"Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde\"\n** Montgomery Gentry — \"Cold One Comin' On\"\n** Darryl Worley — \"I Miss My Friend\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Tim McGraw — \"The Cowboy in Me\"\n** Chris Cagle — \"I Breathe In, I Breathe Out\"\n** Jamie O'Neal — \"When I Think About Angels\"\n** Alison Krauss & Union Station — \"Let Me Touch You for Awhile\"\n** Cyndi Thomson — \"I Always Liked That Best\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |\"lol\" (laugh out loud) Video of the Year\n! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" |Love Your Country Video of the Year\n|-\n|\n* Toby Keith —\"I Wanna Talk About Me\"\n** Alan Jackson — \"It's Alright to Be a Redneck\"\n** Martina McBride — \"When God-Fearin' Women Get the Blues\"\n** Cledus T.
