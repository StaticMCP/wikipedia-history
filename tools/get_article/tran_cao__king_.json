He was installed by Le Loi under the terms of a Ming dynasty Chinese withdrawal which promised to withdraw if a Trần dynasty descendant was placed on the throne. However, after Le Loi intercepted a Chinese general's requests for reinforcements he resumed the war, defeated the Chinese and made Trần Cảo drink poison.\nReferences\n\n---\n\n## Tran Cao (king)\n\n#REDIRECT Trần Cảo"
