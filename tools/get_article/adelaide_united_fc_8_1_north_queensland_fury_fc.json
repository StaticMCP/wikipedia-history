Adelaide United won 8–1, which at the time was the biggest win in the history of the competition.\nNorth Queensland Fury disbanded at the end of the season, after finishing bottom of the table, whereas Adelaide United finished 3rd in the regular season, qualifying for the AFC Champions League qualifying play-off, and reaching the semi-finals of the finals series.\nBackground\nGoing into round 24 of 30 of the 2010–11 A-League season, known as flood relief round, Adelaide United were fighting Central Coast Mariners for 2nd place, with league leaders Brisbane Roar out of sight, which would reward them with a spot in the upper semi-finals. Their last match saw them defeat rivals Melbourne Victory 4–1, their first win over Victory in nearly 3 years. At the other end of the table, North Queensland Fury were battling with Perth Glory and Sydney FC to avoid the wooden spoon. Prior to this match, North Queensland Fury had only defeated Adelaide United once in a competitive fixture, and this would be the final time the two teams would ever play each other.\nPre-match\nTeam selection\nAdelaide United made two changes to their starting line-up, after defeating their rivals Melbourne Victory 4–1, swapping out goalkeeper Mark Birighitti for Eugene Galekovic, and defender Robert Cornthwaite for Nigel Boogaard.\nNorth Queensland Fury made four changes to the team that lost to fellow expansion side Gold Coast United 0–4, changing out Sebastian Usai, Lorenzo Sipi, Ramazan Tavsancioglu and Isaka Cernak for Justin Pasfield, Ufuk Talay, Jason Spagnuolo and David Williams.\nMatch\nSummary\nMarcos Flores opened the scoring for Adelaide United after 4 minutes, with Travis Dodd doubling the lead at the 28th minute. Flores and Iain Ramsay scored at the 37th and 42nd minute to put Adelaide United 4–0 up at half time. Sergio van Dijk scored a second half hat-trick, and Marcos Flores scored his third in the second half, with North Queensland Fury midfielder Panny Nikas scoring a consolation goal at 6–1.\n| time = 20:00 ACDT\n| team1 = Adelaide United\n| score = 8–1\n| report =\n| team2 = North Queensland Fury\n| goals1 =\n* Flores\n* Dodd\n* Ramsay\n* van Dijk\n| goals2 = Nikas\n| stadium = Hindmarsh Stadium, Adelaide\n| attendance = 10,986\n| referee = Peter Green (FFQ)\n}}\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\n{| width=100%\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK ||1 || Eugene Galekovic\n|-\n|RB ||14|| Cameron Watson\n|-\n|CB ||3 || Nigel Boogaard || ||\n|-\n|CB ||4 || Iain Fyfe\n|-\n|LB ||6 || Cássio\n|-\n|RM ||8 || Adam Hughes\n|-\n|CM ||10|| Marcos Flores\n|-\n|LM ||21|| Francisco Usúcar|| ||\n|-\n|RW ||13|| Travis Dodd\n|-\n|CF ||9 || Sergio van Dijk\n|-\n|RW ||17|| Iain Ramsay|| ||\n|-\n|colspan=3|Substitutions:\n|-\n|GK ||20|| Mark Birighitti\n|-\n|MF ||12|| Paul Reid|| ||\n|-\n|DF ||2 || Robert Cornthwaite|| ||\n|-\n|FW ||19|| Matthew Leckie|| ||\n|-\n|colspan=3|Head coach:\n|-\n|colspan=4| Rini Coolen\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK ||1 || Justin Pasfield\n|-\n|RB ||2 || Jack Hingert\n|-\n|CB ||5 || Mark Hughes\n|-\n|CB ||4 || Eric Akoto\n|-\n|LB ||13|| André Kilian|| ||\n|-\n|RM ||12|| Panny Nikas\n|-\n|CM ||6 || Ufuk Talay|| ||\n|-\n|CM ||14|| Chris Grossman|| ||\n|-\n|LM ||3 || Brad McDonald\n|-\n|AM ||11|| David Williams\n|-\n|CF ||21|| Jason Spagnuolo\n|-\n|colspan=3|Substitutions:\n|-\n|GK ||28 || Sebastian Usai\n|-\n|DF ||19 || Isaka Cernak|| ||\n|-\n|MF ||22 || Lorenzo Sipi|| ||\n|-\n|MF ||18 || Brett Studman|| ||\n|-\n|colspan=3|Head coach:\n|-\n|colspan=4| František Straka\n|}\n|}\n{| width=100% style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|\nAssistant referees:\nDaniel Goodwin (FFSA)\nCurtis Wordsworth (FFSA)\n| style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"|\n; Match rules\n* 90 minutes\n* Four named substitutions\n* Maximum of three substitutions\n|}\nAftermath\nAdelaide United broke the record for the number of goals scored by a single team in a game, previously being six, the largest winning margin, and the most goals scored in a single game, which allowed them to regain second place from Central Coast Mariners. By the end of the season they fell back into third behind the Mariners after winning just one of their last four games. Defeating Wellington Phoenix in the first week of finals, their season ended with a 3–2 defeat to Gold Coast United in the semi-finals.\nNorth Queensland Fury ended the season bottom of the table, losing all of their remaining games, capping off an 8-game losing streak and winning just 2 of their last 20. One month after the conclusion of the regular season, their A-League license was revoked and the club folded.\nReferences"
