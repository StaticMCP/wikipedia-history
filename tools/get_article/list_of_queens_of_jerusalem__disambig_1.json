Six women were queens consort, i.e. queens as wives of the kings. Some of them were highly influential in the country's history, having ruled as regents for their minor children and heirs, as well as having a great influence over their spouses. Many kings of Jerusalem died unmarried or as children.\nQueens regnant of Jerusalem\nThis is a list of queens regnant of Jerusalem who held to the throne by their own right:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|--\n!
