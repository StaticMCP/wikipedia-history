Funded by her colleagues at Magnum Photos, the Award is administered by Magnum Foundation in cooperation with the Inge Morath Foundation.\nDetails\nThe annual Inge Morath Award is given to a woman photographer under thirty years of age, to assist in the completion of a long term documentary project. The winner and finalists are selected by the photographer members of Magnum Photos, and a representative of the Morath Foundation, at the Magnum annual meeting. It is the only award that carries the imprimatur of Magnum Photos.\nThe call and guidelines for submissions are announced annually by Magnum Foundation and The Inge Morath Foundation on their web sites, usually in January/February.\nWinners and finalists\n''Clicking on the project name will link to the presentation, hosted at the Inge Morath Foundation's web site.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
