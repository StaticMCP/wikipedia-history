Warren  (October 3, 1877 – April 14, 1962) was an American architect from Birmingham, Alabama. He practiced architecture there from 1907 until his death in 1962. Most of his works were designed in association with Eugene H. Knight  (November 30, 1884 – November 6, 1971), his business partner in the firms of Warren & Knight and Warren, Knight & Davis from 1917 until his death.\nLife and career\nWilliam Tilman Warren was born October 3, 1877, in Montgomery, Alabama to James Rainey Warren and Fannie Warren, née Leak. He was educated at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (BS in engineering, 1897) and Columbia University (BS in architecture, 1902). After graduating from Columbia he worked for McKim, Mead & White and Albro & Lindeberg. In 1907 he returned to Birmingham, where he formed the partnership of Warren & Welton with William Leslie Welton. This was dissolved in 1910. In 1917 he formed a second partnership, Warren & Knight, with Eugene H. Knight. This was expanded in 1922 to include John E. Davis and was renamed Warren, Knight & Davis. As originally conceived, Knight was the chief designer, Warren was in charge of production and management and Davis was in charge of construction administration.\nIn 1946 the partnership was expanded to include Albion K. Knight and John E. Davis Jr., the sons of Knight and Davis. John E. Davis was the first of the name partners to die, in 1961. Warren and Knight followed in 1962 and 1971, respectively. The remaining partners incorporated the firm as Warren, Knight & Davis Inc. in 1976. This was changed to Davis, Black & Associates Inc. in 1987 and to Robert M. Black Architects Inc. in 1991. Bob Black, the last principal of the firm, died in 2004. The firm is no longer active but legally still exists.\nHe and his firms made significant contributions to the architectural history of Birmingham. Their work was concentrated in Alabama, but they also completed works in Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee. Work in Alabama included many public and private buildings in addition to works for Alabama A&M University, Alabama State University, Auburn University and the University of Alabama. In Florida they completed at least three county courthouses and in Tennessee they worked for Sewanee: The University of the South.\nWarren joined the American Institute of Architects in 1916, as a charter member of the Alabama chapter. He served as a chapter president and on the AIA board of directors. He was elected a Fellow in 1934 and was the first Alabama architect to be elected a Fellow under the modern system instituted in 1898. His partner, Eugene H. Knight, would also be elected a Fellow in 1952.\nPersonal life\nWarren was married to Dorothea Orr in 1912. They had two children, Dorothea (Dorothy) and William Tilman Jr. (Bill). He died April 14, 1962, at the age of 84.\nWarren was a member of the Birmingham Country Club, the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and the Birmingham Little Theatre.\nLegacy\nAt least six buildings designed by Warren and his partners have been listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places, and others contribute to listed historic districts.\nThe Birmingham Public Library has a collection of his papers. In 2017 he was inducted into the Birmingham Business Hall of Fame.\nArchitectural works\nWarren & Welton, 1907–1910\n* 1908 – Smith Hall, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama\n* 1909 – Wesleyan Hall annex, University of North Alabama, Florence, Alabama\nWilliam T.
