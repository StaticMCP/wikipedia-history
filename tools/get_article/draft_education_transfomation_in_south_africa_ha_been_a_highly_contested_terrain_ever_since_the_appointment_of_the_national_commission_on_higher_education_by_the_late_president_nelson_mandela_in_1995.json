      "text": "# Draft:Education transfomation in South Africa ha been a highly contested terrain ever since the appointment of the National Commission on higher education by the late president Nelson Mandela in 1995\n\nEducation activist Hendrick Makaneta has reported a company that sells matric results for R100. Makaneta raised an alarm after a company called Edumarks indicated on its website that learners could buy the results online. The Department of Basic Education has referred the matter to the National Prosecuting Authority.\nThere is no doubt that education remains highly contested in South Africa. It is encouraging that in the midst of the challenges, there is still hope."
