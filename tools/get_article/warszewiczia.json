Perhaps the most famous member of the genus is W. coccinea (chaconia), which is the national flower of Trinidad and Tobago.\nDescription\nThe inflorescences show leaf-shaped, bright-colored calycophylls, expanded foliaceous structures made from floral petaloids with enlarged showy calyx-lobes. Their main task is to attract pollinators.\nTaxonomy\nThis genus was named after Józef Warszewicz, a 19th-century Polish orchid collector and inspector of the botanic gardens in Kraków, Poland. Warszawa is also the Polish name for Warsaw&nbsp;– capital city of Poland.\nSpecies\n{| border=\"0\"\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* Warszewiczia ambigua Standl.\n* Warszewiczia coccinea (Vahl) Klotzsch - Orangegold Chaconia, Wild Poinsettia\n* Warszewiczia cordata Spruce ex K.Schum.\n* Warszewiczia elata Ducke\n* Warszewiczia longistaminea K.Schum.\n* Warszewiczia peltata Wedd.\n* Warszewiczia schwackei K.Schum.\n* Warszewiczia uxpanapensis (Lorence) C.M.Taylor\n|}\nExternal links\n*[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/rubiaceae/ World Checklist of Rubiaceae]"
