Two years later Roger's wife Linnie ascended the tower via the ladder, one of a total of about 215 who have used the ladder. The last use was by Babe \"The Human Fly\" White in 1927.\nThe present tower ladder consists of a series of wooden stakes connected on the outside by vertical wood planks. One end of each stake is driven sideways into a rock crevice, vertically ascending the southeast side of the tower. Attached with nails and/or baling wire to the other end of the stakes are  lengths of  lumber. The ladder ascends from about  above the ground to the summit, and is about  long. Because of its small scale in comparison to the tower, it is very difficult to see in modern photographs, and visitors to the tower usually must view it through a telescope. The lowest  were removed in the 1930s as a safety measure. The remaining ladder was restored in 1972.\nSee also\n*Entrance Road-Devils Tower National Monument\n*Entrance Station-Devils Tower National Monument\n*Old Headquarters Area Historic District\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.nps.gov/deto/learn/historyculture/first-fifty-years-stake-ladder.htm National Park Service] Devils Tower First Fifty Years - Stake Ladder\n* at the National Park Service's NRHP database\n*[http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/NationalRegister/Site.aspx?ID=136 Devils Tower Ladder] at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office"
