From here, Old Broad Street runs south-west along the border with Cornhill where it joins Throgmorton Street, its southern boundary—to the south of which is the Bank of England in Walbrook ward. The western boundary follows a series of small courts and alleys adjacent to Moorgate and then runs up Copthall Avenue. A busy commercial area it also contains two livery halls of the Worshipful Company of Carpenters and Worshipful Company of Drapers on the private Throgmorton Avenue which they jointly own. Like many of the City wards it has a social club for people who work in the area, which celebrated its 30th anniversary in March 2006.\nAt the top of Old Broad Street, adjacent to Liverpool Street station, was Broad Street station which closed in 1986—the only major terminus station in London to have permanently closed.\nPolitics\nBroad Street is one of 25 wards in the City of London, each electing an alderman to the Court of Aldermen and  commoners (the City equivalent of a councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only electors who are Freemen of the City of London are eligible to stand.\nElected representatives\n* Alderman: Michael Mainelli\n* Deputy: Christopher Hayward\n* Common Council: Shahnan Bakth, Antony Manchester\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.broadstreetward.org.uk Broad Street Ward] The Official Ward Website\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20150427041022/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/about-the-city/elections-and-wards/wards/Pages/ward-boundaries-map.aspx City of London Corporation] Map of City of London Wards (2003 —)\n*[http://www.broadstreetwardclub.org Broad Street Ward Club] - a Social Club based in the City of London\n*[http://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/BROA3.htm Map of Early Modern London:  Broad Street Ward] - Historical Map and Encyclopedia of Shakespeare's London (Scholarly)"
