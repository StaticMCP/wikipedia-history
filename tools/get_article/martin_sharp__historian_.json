He was second son of William Lacy Sharp, of the East India Company's service, who married Louisa Charlotte Hume in 1840. He was educated at a private school at Forest Gate, he had some practical training in business, and began early to learn Spanish. A branch of his mother's family had settled at Madrid towards the end of the eighteenth century.\nCareer\nIn 1860, Sharp paid his Spanish kinsfolk a first visit, which had a decisive influence on his career. His relatives received him with affectionate cordiality. Though he declined their invitation to make his home with them, he visited them annually for long periods, perfected his knowledge of Spanish, witnessed the revolution of 1868, and became acquainted with the chief organisers of the movement. The last of the Spanish Humes, a lady advanced in years, died in 1876, bequeathing her property to Martin Sharp, and in August 1877, in compliance with her wish, he assumed the name of Hume. He was now independent. A keen volunteer officer, he was attached to the Turkish forces during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78; he then spent some time in exploration on the west coast of Africa, and travelled extensively in Central and South America.\nUntil 1882 Hume's sympathies had been vaguely conservative. His views then changed, and during the next eleven years he actively engaged in English political conflict. He stood unsuccessfully as a liberal candidate at Maidstone in 1885, at Central Hackney in 1886, and at Stockport in 1892 and 1893.\nAfter some practice in journalism, he meanwhile produced his first book, a Chronicle of King Henry VIII of England (1889), a translation from the Spanish. Though this attracted little attention, Hume persevered, and The Courtships of Queen Elizabeth; a History of the Various Negotiations for her Marriage, and The Year after the Armada, and other Historical Studies, both issued in 1896, were received with a degree of popular favour which led him to adopt authorship as a profession. In 1897, he published Sir Walter Ralegh and Philip II of Spain, the latter monograph showing insight and independence of view.\nNext year Hume succeeded Pascual de Gayangos at the Public Record Office as editor of the Spanish State Papers, and did sound work in this capacity. However, his official duties did not absorb all his energies. In 1898, he published The Great Lord Burghley, a readable study, and Spain, its Greatness and Decay, 1479–1789, a useful historical outline, which he completed in the following year by the publication of Modern Spain, 1788–1898 (1899 ; new edit. 1906).\nHe was appointed Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic by King Alfonso XIII in 1902.\nHume never married. He died on 1 July 1910, at his sister's house at Forest Gate.\nWorks\nHis principal works were:\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=9NQCAAAAYAAJ The Year After the Armada: And Other Historical Studies] (1896)\n* The Courtships of Queen Elizabeth (1896; revised edition, 1904)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007707592 Philip II of Spain] (1897)\n* [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009610665 Sir Walter Ralegh: the British dominion of the West] (1897)\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56119 The Great Lord Burghley] (1898)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006085935 Spain: Its Greatness and Decay, 1479&ndash;1789] (1898; revised by Armstrong, 1913)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001236852 Modern Spain, 1788–1898] (1899; new edition, 1906)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002209845 The Spanish People] (1901)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011596146 The Love Affairs of Mary Queen of Scots] (1903)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001245805 Spanish Influence on English Literature] (1905)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006547763 Queens of Old Spain] (1907)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001858866 The Court of Philip IV: Spain in Decadence] (1907)\n* Through Portugal (1907)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000312370 Two English Queens and Philip] (1908)\n* Queen Elizabeth and her England (1910)\n* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009998664 True Stories of the Past] (1910, published posthumously)\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*  at Internet Archive\n*\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
