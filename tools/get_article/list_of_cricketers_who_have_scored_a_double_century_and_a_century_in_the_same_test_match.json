Scores of more than 200 runs are still statistically counted as a century, although these scores are referred to as double century (200–299 runs). A century or a double century is regarded as a landmark score for batsmen and a player's number of centuries or double centuries are generally recorded in their career statistics. Test cricket, the longest version of the game, involves two innings per side in a match and scheduled to last for up to five days.  An individual scoring a double century and a century in the two innings of a single Test match is considered a notable achievement by critics.\nThe feat has been accomplished by 9 players on 9 occasions, as of July 2025. Players from Australia have accomplished the feat three times, the most for any country. So far, no batter has scored a double hundred and hundred in a Test match more than once.\nHistory\nThe first player to score a double hundred and a hundred in the same Test match was Doug Walters from Australia, who scored 242 runs in the first innings and 103 runs in the third innings. He achieved the feat on 17 February 1969 at Sydney Cricket Ground, while playing against the West Indies during the fifth Test of the bilateral series.`The second player to reach the milestone was India's Sunil Gavaskar, who did it in April 1971 at Queen's Park Oval, against the West Indies . At the age of 21, he made scores of 124 and 220 in the first and third innings respectively, becoming the youngest player to set the record. With this, he also became the first player to have double centuries in all four innings in Tests. Lawrence Rowe was the first player to score a double century and a century in a single Test on his debut match, which he did against New Zealand in February 1972. His scores of 214 and 100* was also the first time that a player scored a double ton and a ton in the same match and remained not out in any one of the two innings. Graham Gooch has the highest aggregate in a match while scoring a double century and a century in both the innings; his combined tally of 456 runs in the match333 in the first and 123 in the second inningswas entered into The Guinness Book of Records as \"Most runs scored by a player in a Test match\". He also became the first batter to score a triple century and a century in the same Test match, while playing against India in July 1990. Brian Lara’s scores of 221 and 130 against Sri Lanka in November 2001, is the first and only instance of a player achieving the landmark on a losing cause.\nKey\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Key\n|-\n! scope=col | Symbol\n! scope=col | Meaning\n|-\n! scope=row | Player\n| The batsman who scored the centuries\n|-\n! scope=row | Inn1\n| Score made by batsman in the first innings of the match\n|-\n! scope=row | Inn2\n| Score made by batsman in the second innings of the match\n|-\n! scope=row | *\n| Batsman remained not out\n|-\n! scope=row | Team\n| The team the batsman was representing\n|-\n! scope=row | Opposition\n| The team the batsman was playing against\n|-\n! scope=row | Venue\n| The cricket ground where the match was played\n|-\n! scope=row | Date\n| Starting date of the Test match\n|-\n! scope=row | Result\n| Result for the team for which the century was scored\n|}\nList\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Cricketers who have scored a double century and a century in the same Test match\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Player\n! scope=\"col\" | Inn1\n! scope=\"col\" | Inn2\n! scope=\"col\" | Team\n! scope=\"col\" | Opposition\n! scope=\"col\" | Test\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Ref\n|-\n|| 1\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|| 242 || 103 ||  ||  || 5th ||  Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney ||  || Won ||\n|-\n|| 2\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|| 124 || 220 ||  ||  || 5th ||  Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain ||  || Drawn ||\n|-\n|| 3\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|| 214 || 100* ||  ||  || 1st ||  Sabina Park, Kingston ||  || Drawn ||\n|-\n|| 4\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|| 247* || 133 ||  ||  || 1st ||  Basin Reserve, Wellington ||  || Drawn ||\n|-\n|| 5\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|| 333 || 123 ||  ||  || 1st ||  Lord's, London ||  || Won ||\n|-\n|| 6\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|| 221 || 130 ||  ||  || 3rd ||  Singhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground, Colombo||  || Lost ||\n|-\n|| 7\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|| 319 || 105* ||  ||  || 2nd ||  Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, Chittagong||  || Drawn ||\n|-\n|8\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|| 204 || 104* ||  ||  || 1st ||  Perth Stadium, Perth ||  || Won ||\n|-\n|9\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n| 269 || 161 ||  ||  || 2nd ||  Edgbaston, Birmingham  || 3 July 2025 || Won ||\n|}\nReferences"
