Imported from Germany and Spain (Astra 900 and MM31), but mostly produced locally copy in various arsenals, the larger being in Hanyang, Shanghai, Gongxian, Taku and Shanxi. Often used with a detachable shoulder stock. The pistol used the 7.63x25mm caliber, but a version in .45 ACP was also produced in Shanxi, called the \"Type 17\"||}}\n|-\n|FN 1900||.32 ACP||Very popular pistol called the Lu Zi (撸子) or 8 Bangs (八音子) in the North and Bent Ruler (曲尺) in the South. Originally made in Belgium, but with many copies and variations produced in China, most significantly in the arsenals in Jinling and Shanghai. Made with both 6 or 8-inch barrels, the latter having a slot for a detachable shoulder stock.||\n|-\n|Ruby||.32 ACP||Originally made in Spain, but produced copy in China by the Hanyang Arsenal, as well as smaller shops.||\n|-\n|Colt M1903||.32 ACP||Imported commercially from the United States. Called the Horse Brand Pistol (馬牌撸子) after the old Colt rampant horse logo.||}}\n|-\n|FN 1910||.32 ACP||Imported from Belgium and nicknamed the Floral Mouth Pistol (花口撸子) due to its serrated muzzle ring.||\n|-\n|Mauser 1914||.32 ACP||Imported from Germany. Called the Kick Mouth Open (张嘴蹬) due to the hold-open design when the gun was empty \"waiting\" like an \"open mouth\".||\n|-\n|Astra 400||||Rare pistol imported from Spain and used the uncommon (especially in China) 9&nbsp;mm Largo caliber.|| }}\n|-\n|Hi-Power||9×19mm||Produced by the John Inglis Company in Canada for China through the Mutual Aid Board in 1943. Originally intended to make 180,000, only 4,000 were delivered to Karachi, India before the end of the war, with supply problems over \"the Hump\" making it hard for them to reach the Chinese Y Force. Production was cancelled in 1944, but restarted in late 1945, with 40,000 being used in the Civil War after World War II.||\n|-\n|||.45 ACP||Supplied to SACO guerrilla units and operatives early in the war, and to the X Force in Burma later on.

SIG in Switzerland produced the originally German weapon under license as the \"SIG Bergmann 1920\" and exported it to China after World War I. Chinese arsenals in Jinling and Shanghai started producing them in 7.65mm in 1926. Other arsenals, such as Taku and Hanyang, started making them in 7.63mm. Shenyang, Shanxi and Beiyang arsenals also produced copy the weapon. Some arsenals made the weapon with the magazine facing down, instead of to the side.||}}\n|-\n|Erma EMP\n|7.63x25mm\n|Purchased and copied in small numbers during the Second-Sino Japanese War\n|\n|-\n|Thompson||.45 ACP7.63x25mm||The M1921 was commercially imported from the United States and thereafter locally produced in China since the 1920s. Several tens of thousands were made copy in the arsenals of Shanxi, Taiyuan and Sichuan. ~4,700 guns were also made in 7.63mm in the 21st Arms Weapons Depot. Later in the war, M1928A1 wartime models were supplied to the X Force in Burma, with some also going to the Y Force, by the United States. The M1 was also supplied to SACO units.||}}\n|-\n|Automatic Mauser C96||7.63x25mm||The fully automatic version of the common Mauser C96 was originally invented and imported from Spain (Astra 902, Super Azul and MM31). They were also widely imported from Germany (M712 Schnellfeuer). Chinese-made copies also existed. A Chinese technique of firing the gun was to hold the pistol sideways, as the high recoil due to the very high rate of fire would push the gun in a sweeping motion to the side instead of upwards.||}}\n|-\n|United Defense M42||9×19mm||Supplied to SACO guerrilla units and operatives.9×19mm\n||\n|-\n|Sten gun\n|9×19mm\n|During World War Two, Canada supplied some 73,000 Sten guns (made by the Long Branch arsenal) to Chinese Nationalist forces in an effort to help them fight the Japanese.

Weapon\n! Caliber\n! Notes\n! Origin\n|-\n|Hanyang 88||7.92×57mm||The most common Chinese rifle in the war and was based copy on the German Gewehr 88 originally used by the New Armies of the Qing dynasty (Several Gewehr 88's also found their way to China after World War I and even its predecessor, the Gewehr 71/84, was still in very limited use.). Around 1,000,000 were produced in several Chinese arsenals before production ceased in 1944. There also existed a more uncommon carbine version.||}}\n|-\n|StandardmodellKarabiner 98k||7.92×57mm||In the Chinese National Armament Standards Conference of 1932 it was decided that the Mauser Standardmodell was to be the standard-issue rifle of China. It started being imported from Germany in 1934 and production in Chinese arsenals also began in 1935, first under the name \"Type 24 Rifle\", but was soon renamed to the \"Chiang Kai-Shek rifle\" after the Generalissimo. It would remain the standard service rifle throughout the war, but would never outproduce the Hanyang 88, with the total number of Chinese produced Chiang Kai-Shek rifles made between 1935 and 1945 being ~360,000. In 1935, Germany adopted a modified Standardmodell as their service rifle under the designation Karabiner 98k, continued Chinese imports between 1938 and 1939 would consist of some 100,000 examples of this rifle.||}}\n|-\n|FN Model 1930||7.92×57mm||After World War I, German arms exports were banned under the Treaty of Versailles, and weapons companies of other countries stepped in to fill the gap. A very large amount of Belgian M1924 rifles and M1930 carbines from FN were sold to China. Chinese arsenals also produced copies, such as the \"Type 21 Carbine\" from Guangdong or the \"Type 77 Rifle\" (named after the date of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident) from Zhejiang.||}}\n|-\n|ZB vz. 98/22||7.92×57mm||After World War I, German arms exports were banned under the Treaty of Versailles, and weapons companies of other countries stepped in to fill the gap. Czechoslovak Brno produced and exported a modified version of the German Gewehr 98. Records show around 200,000 were shipped to China between 1927 and 1939.||}}\n|-\n|ZB vz. 24||7.92×57mm||Right after the ZB vz. 98/22, Brno started producing the shorter ZB vz. 24. Around 100,000 were imported by the Central Government of China between 1937 and 1938, and several tens of thousands more by provincial governors.||}}\n|-\n|Mosin–Nagant 1891||7.62×54mmR||Called the Three-Line Repeater (三线步枪), due to the old Russian measurement of the caliber, or Water Repeater (水连珠), believed to be due to Chinese first encountering the rifle from Russian Naval Infantry. Many Mosin-Nagant 1891 rifles were supplied during the Sino-Soviet cooperation in the 1920s and to the troops of the pro-Soviet Sheng Shicai. The Soviet Aid Program early in the war also supplied China with 50,000 Mosin-Nagant 1891/30 rifles, which were used by second line and garrison troops due to the caliber difference.||}}\n|-\n|Carcano 1891||||The Carcano rifle was first imported from Italy in 1920, with an order of 40,000. In 1922, a further 14,000 rifles were purchased. In 1924, a further 40,000 rifles were obtained. Japanese records show these rifles being captured in Fujian. In 1941, Japan sold 15,000 of these captured weapons to the collaborationist Nanjing Army.|| Italy\n|-\n|M1917 Enfield||.30-06||Common Chinese Lend-Lease rifle. Most of the X Force in Burma were carrying this rifle. At first the rifles were cut-down to a shorter length, to better suit the shorter Chinese soldiers, but later issued rifles were of normal length.||\n|-\n|M1903A3 Springfield||.30-06||The M1903A3 Springfield was also commonly issued to soldiers of the X Force. It was also used by Chinese commandos in 1945, provided by the OSS.||\n|-\n|M1 Carbine||.30 Carbine||Milton E. Miles of SACO considered the light-weight M1 Carbine to be more suitable to the Chinese soldiers than the bigger Mauser rifles, therefore, most SACO units from 1943 on were issued with this semi-automatic weapon. It was also used by the X Force in Burma.||\n|-\n|Lee-Enfield No.4 Mk I*||.303 British||The North American produced version of the Lee-Enfield was issued to the X Force while they were training in India. The rifles were part of the Lend-Lease program and marked as US property. Once American rifles started being issued, the Lee-Enfields were kept as training weapons and for guard duty. 40,000 were supplied from 1942 onward.||\n|-\n|Mauser 1907Mauser Type 1Mauser Type 4||6.8×57mm7.92×57mm||The Type 1 was a Chinese produced version of a pattern of imported German rifle (Mauser 1907) from the end of the Qing dynasty. Originally chambered in 6.8×57mm, but changed to 7.92×57mm with the new designation Type 4 (usually just called the \"Type 1 7.9mm\"), in 1915. The Type 4 were the older Chinese standard rifles and common during the Warlord era. In World War II, they were outdated, but still in use by more poorly equipped units.||\n|-\n|Liao Type 13||7.92×57mm6.5×50mmSR||A hybrid between Arisaka and Mauser 4 produced in the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo and before in the Mukden Arsenal. Around 140,000 are estimated to have been produced in total. Most of the weapons are using the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge, but some have turned up chambered in 6.5×50mmSR Arisaka.||\n|-\n|Arisaka Type 38||6.5×50mmSR||While the Japanese Arisaka rifle was supplied to collaborationist units, particularly the Manchukuo Imperial Army and used as captured weapons by Allied ones, China had also imported and produced (in Shanxi) Type 30 and 38 Rifles since before the war. Up to 1917, ~200,000 Type 38 and 150,000 Type 30 rifles had also been imported. The Type 38 was called 38 Big Cover (三八大盖), by the Chinese. Copies of the Type 30 and 38, in 7.92×57mm and 6.5×50mmSR respectively, both named \"Type 19\", were also made in the collaborationist China.|| China (Nanjing)\n|-\n|Type 81 Short Rifle||7.92×57mm||A short rifle which included a mixture of features from rifles such as the Hanyang 88, vz. 24 and Japanese Arisaka carbine, including a foldable bayonet. They were produced by the Chinese communists, first in the Jin Ji Yu Operating Base Arsenal in September 1940 before prints and templates were distributed to other arsenals. Around 8,700 were made in total and the model was the largest number produced in the communist arsenals during the war.\n||\n|-\n|Gewehr 98||7.92×57mm||Some surplus weapons from various countries in possession of the Gewehr 98 after World War I sold these off internationally, with some ending up in the arms of Chinese warlords.||\n|-\n|Karabinek wz. 1929||7.92×57mm||The Polish Karabinek wz. 1929 were exported to China. It is estimated this was only a small amount.||}}\n|-\n|Mannlicher M1886Mannlicher M1888||8×52mmR||Many were imported very long before World War II, but were still used by some rear-line units.||}}\n|-\n|ZH-29||7.92×57mm||210 examples of this weapon were purchased in 1930 and 1931 for Northeast China. They were probably captured in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. A derivative prototype was built in 1932 in Shenyang, China. It is unlikely that these rifles saw action during the Sino-Japanese War.||}} }}\n|-\n|Murata Type 13||11×60mmR||Local defense militias in Manchukuo were issued obsolete weapons such as these.||\n|-\n|||6.5×50mmSR Arisaka||The Xiangying rifle was made by modifying captured Type 38 rifles. Unlike the regular Type 38 rifle, the Xiangying rifle lacked the Arisaka's distinctive dust cover however, it still had a bayonet mount like the Type 38 rifle and was chambered in the same round (6.5×50mmSR Arisaka). The Xiangying rifle is modified with an external gas piston on the right side of the rifle. The gas piston is connected to the base of the bolt handle. It also had a recoil compensator. Only about 4-7 were made.||\n|}\nGrenades and grenade launchers\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:98%;\"\n! Weapon\n! Notes\n! Origin\n|-\n|Chinese Stielhandgranate||China designed and produced grenades based on the German type, which was the main type during the war. Both several arsenals and civilian workshops produced hundreds of thousands each month. Variations existed, but followed the same basic principle: a wooden handle with a round or cylindrical head and a slow burning fuse. The charge was a mixture of TNT and nitride potassium and were generally weaker than their German counterpart. In 1939, a more powerful design with a smaller handle and much more compressed explosive load became the new standard type in all arsenals. Soldiers often bundled grenades together to blast open fortifications. Another tactic was to tie a grenade to a long bamboo stick, for example to stick up over a wall or into a window.||}}}}\n|-\n|Various Grenades||Several other types of simple timed or impact grenades were also made in various machine shops. Examples are copies of the Mills bomb and an impact grenade produced in Jinling Arsenal which had a long \"tail\" made of hemp to make it easier to throw, nicknamed the \"Ponytail Grenade\". Local production of grenades and mines by Communist soldiers were important to their guerrilla tactics.||}}\n|-\n|||The Type 23 Grenade was a simple cast metal grenade adopted in 1934 which had the function to be easily used as a trap. Many of these grenades were also captured by the Japanese and used in the Pacific War, where US reports believed them to be a new Japanese type.||}}\n|-\n|Type 27 Grenade Discharger||The Type 27 was a common 50&nbsp;mm grenade launcher, a simplified version based on the Japanese Type 89 (which proved too complicated to produce and for soldiers to use). The launcher was designed and tested in 1938, with production beginning in January 1939. Some modifications were introduced in 1940 and 1941, such as making the calibration and base plate thicker and changing the shape of the range adjustment wheel. It had a range of 50–250 meters with a kill zone of 20 meters in diameter. The grenade had a delay fuse of 7.5–8 seconds after being launched. The projectile (Type 27 Grenade) were copies of the Japanese Type 91 grenade, which were used with the Type 89. Therefore, captured enemy ammunition could be used as well. 40,900 were produced, with 1,500,000 grenades. The weapon could be carried in a large leather holster.||}}\n|-\n|Type 28 Rifle Grenade||The Type 28 was a rifle grenade launcher shaped like a long cylinder which would be attached to front of a Mauser type or Hanyang 88 rifle. It could then fire a Type 28 Rifle grenade (both explosive and smoke types) with the use of a special blank cartridge. The Type 28 rifle grenade system was designed in February 1939 and adopted the same year, going intro production by June. It had a range of 50–250 meters and had a kill zone 10 meters in diameter. The Type 28 grenade was similar to the regular \"Stielhandgranate\" types, and could be thrown by hand. It had a fuse of 6.5 seconds and was more powerful than regular grenades. Monthly production was 80,000 grenades and 2,000 launchers.||}}\n|-\n|}\nFlamethrowers\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:98%;\"\n! Weapon\n! Notes\n!

Chinese production started in 1927, originally in Taku, but with many other arsenals soon following suit. It was the standard light machine gun since 1934 and the most common through the whole war, with many arsenals each producing several hundred weapons per month. The gun never received its own designation in China, but was always simply referred to as the \"Czech Light Machine-gun\". ||}}\n|-\n|FN Model 1930FN Model D||7.92×57mm||Belgian versions of the Browning Automatic Rifle made by FN were imported to China. Over 9,000 had been imported by the time the war broke out, with an additional 8,000 being purchased after that.||\n|-\n|Madsen gun||7.92×57mm||The Danish Madsen gun was used with a bipod or tripod and was both imported and locally produced copy in small scale since 1909. The Madsen gun was considered to replace the ZB vz. 26 after Brno had turned down the licensing rights for production in China. But after a full set of tools, jigs and drawings were lost in a Japanese air raid in 1940, the Ordnance Office turned back to ZB vz. 26 production. 438 were imported before the war and 3,300 during it.||\n|-\n|||7.92×57mm||China purchased over 3,000 KE-7's from Switzerland between 1928 and 1939, including 44,500 magazines. An arsenal in Chongqing, Sichuan produced copy an additional 6,000 copies between 1934 and 1936.||}}\n|-\n|Degtyaryov DP||||5,600 Soviet Degtyaryov DP machine guns were supplied to China in the Soviet Aid Program starting in 1938.||\n|-\n|Maxim–Tokarev||||The predecessor of the Degtyaryov was the Maxim-Tokarev 1925 machine gun. Of the total 2,450 produced, 1,400 were supplied to China between 1938 and 1939, with the rest going to the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War.||\n|-\n|||7.92×57mm||China started buying this French weapon in 1931 and by the time the war started in 1937 2,620 guns had been imported. A further 1,400 guns were ordered, with at least 925 confirmed deliveries by 1939.||\n|-\n|Chauchat||7.92*57mm|| About 100 copies of the Chauchat were produced by Jinling Arsenal and used during the Second Sino-Japanese War.||}} }}\n|-\n|Lewis gun||.303 British||At least 3,000 Lewis guns and 15,000,000 rounds of ammunition were purchased around 1930.||}}\n|-\n|||7.92×57mm||Originally chambered in the Finnish 7.62×53mmR, the export version of this weapon to its only buyer: China, was chambered in 7.92×57mm Mauser. A contract was originally signed for 30,000 guns, but only 800 were delivered in 1938.||\n|-\n|Bren gun||.303 British7.92×57mm||Over 18,000 Canadian John Inglis Company Bren Mk. I guns in .303 British were supplied to China through the Lend-Lease program. However, supply problems over \"the Hump\" led to only 1,117 having been issued to units in China by early 1945. So the primary user became the X Force in Burma, with the Y Force receiving more later on. In October 1943, the John Inglis Company started producing Bren guns in 7.92×57mm Mauser for the Chinese. By the end of World War II, 18,900 had been shipped and 13,800 had been delivered to China by July 1945. Several thousands more would be delivered and used in the Chinese Civil War in the following years.||\n|-\n|Nambu Type 11||6.5×50mmSR||Captured Japanese Type 11 machine guns were used, and they were supplied to the Manchukuo Imperial Army as well as other collaborators. A small number of Chinese copies, the \"Type 17\" in the same caliber, were produced before the war at Mukden.||\n|-\n|Type 24 Maxim||7.92×57mm||Based copy on the commercial version of the German MG 08, the MG 09, the Type 24 was a modified and upgraded standardized version of previous small-scale productions of German Maxim guns. It became the most common heavy machine gun in the war, produced in multiple arsenals. In addition to the regular belt, there existed special drum magazines (as well as tripods and sights) for anti-aircraft use. The Type 24 was one of the latest adopted Maxim type guns in the world and could incorporate a lot of experience and features from previous models from around the world. It was a very well made and feature rich weapon.||\n|-\n|Type Triple-TenM1917 Browning||7.92×57mm.30-06||Type Triple-Ten was a Chinese copy of the M1917 Browning in 7.92×57mm Mauser. Production started on 10 October 1921 (the 10th year of the republic), i.e. 10-10-10, and the weapon was thus named \"Type Triple-Ten\". The gun was not very stable and had poor performance, attempts to obtain drawings from the United States or Belgium to improve it were without success. Production shifted to the Type 24 Maxim instead, but ~10,000 Triple-Tens were still made in total. Later in the war, real M1917 Browning's would be supplied to the X Force, chambered in .30-06.||\n|-\n|MG-34\n|7.92*57mm\n|Even Chinese copy used\n|\n|-\n|Hotchkiss 1914||7.92×57mm||Around 2,800 guns were imported from France in the 1930s, all in 7.92×57mm Mauser, further deliveries were stopped due to the German invasion of France in 1940.
