      "text": "# Vice President of Haiti\n\nVice President of Haiti (French: ''Vice-président d'Haïti'') is a former political position in Haiti. It was formally established the first and so far the only time in 1874.\nThe position was formally established in the Constitution of Haiti in August 1874, a new version of the constitution to replaced an earlier version. The presidential term was changed to eight years and a vice president position with executive powers was established.\nAn office of a jointly-elected Vice President, intended to replace the office of Prime Minister, was proposed by Jovenel Moïse in a draft constitution which he intended to submit for ratification, but his 2021 assassination indefinitely paused its reintroduction.\nList of officeholders\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
