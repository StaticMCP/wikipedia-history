In the ensuing battle the British captured two Spanish ships of the line, but failed to prevent the joining of French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve's fleet to the squadron of Ferrol and to strike the shattering blow that would have freed Great Britain from the danger of an invasion. Calder was later court-martialled and severely reprimanded for his failure and for avoiding the renewal of the engagement on 23 and 24 July. At the same time, in the aftermath Villeneuve elected not to continue on to Brest, where his fleet could have joined with other French ships to clear the English Channel for an invasion of Great Britain.\nStrategic background\nThe fragile Peace of Amiens of 1802 had come to an end when Napoleon formally annexed the Italian state of Piedmont and on 18 May 1803 Britain was once again at war with France.\nNapoleon planned to end the British blockade by invading and conquering Britain. By 1805 his ''Armée d'Angleterre'' was 150,000 strong and encamped at Boulogne. If this army could cross the English Channel, victory over the poorly trained and equipped militias was very likely. The plan was that the French navy would escape from the British blockades of Toulon and Brest and threaten to attack the West Indies, thus drawing off the British defence of the Western Approaches. The combined fleets would rendezvous at Martinique and then double back to Europe, land troops in Ireland to raise a rebellion, defeat the weakened British patrols in the Channel, and help transport the Armée d'Angleterre across the Straits of Dover.\nFrench Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve sailed from Toulon on 29 March with eleven ships of the line, six frigates and two brigs. He evaded Admiral Nelson's blockading fleet and passed the Strait of Gibraltar on 8 April. At Cádiz, he drove off the British blockading squadron and was joined by six Spanish ships of the line. The combined fleet sailed for the West Indies, reaching Martinique on 12 May. Nelson was kept in the Mediterranean by westerly winds and did not pass the Strait until 7 May. The British fleet of ten ships reached Antigua on 4 June.\nVilleneuve waited at Martinique for Admiral Ganteaume's Brest fleet to join him, but it remained blockaded in port. Pleas from French army officers for Villeneuve to attack British colonies went unheeded—except for the recapture of the island fort of Diamond Rock—until 4 June when he set out from Martinique. On 7 June he learned from a captured British merchantman that Nelson had arrived at Antigua, and on 11 June Villeneuve left for Europe, having failed to achieve any of his objectives in the Caribbean.\nWhile in the Antilles, the Franco-Spanish fleet ran into a British convoy worth 5 million francs escorted by the frigate Barbadoes, 28 guns, and sloop Netley. Villeneuve hoisted general chase and two French frigates with the Spanish ship Argonauta, 80 guns, captured all the ships but one escort.\nOn 30 June the combined squadron captured and burned an English 14-gun privateer. On 3 July the fleet recaptured Spanish galleon Matilda, which carried an estimated 15 million franc treasure, from English privateer Mars, from Liverpool, which was towing Matilda to an English harbour. The privateer was burned and the merchant was taken in tow by the .\nThe fleet sailed back to Europe. On 9 July the French ship Indomptable lost its main spar in a gale that damaged some other vessels slightly. The Atlantic crossings had been very difficult, according to Spanish Admiral Gravina, who had crossed the Atlantic eleven times. So, with some ships in bad condition, tired crews and scarce victuals, the combined fleet sighted land near Cape Finisterre on 22 July.\nBattle\nNews of the returning French fleet reached Vice Admiral Robert Calder on 19 July. He was ordered to lift his blockade of the ports of Rochefort and Ferrol and sail for Cape Finisterre to intercept Villeneuve. The fleets sighted each other at about 11:00 on 22 July.\nAfter several hours of manoeuvring to the south-west, the action began at about 17:15 as the British fleet, with Hero (Captain Alan Gardner) in the vanguard, bore down on the Franco-Spanish line of battle. In poor visibility, the battle became a confused melee. Malta formed the rear-most ship in the British line in the approach to the battle, but as the fleets became confused in the failing light and thick patchy fog, Malta, commanded by Sir Edward Buller, found itself surrounded by five Spanish ships. During a fierce engagement in which Malta suffered five killed and forty wounded, the British ship battled it out, sending out devastating broadsides from both port and starboard.\nAt about 20:00, Buller forced the Spanish 80-gun San Rafael to strike, and afterwards sent the Maltas boats to take possession of the Spanish 74-gun Firme. Calder signalled to break-off the action at 20:25, aiming to continue the battle the next day. In the failing light and general confusion, some ships continued to fire for another hour.\nDaybreak on 23 July found the fleets  apart. Calder was unwilling to attack a second time against superior odds. He had to protect the damaged Windsor Castle and Malta with her large captured Spanish prizes and considered the possibility that the previously blockaded fleets at Rochefort and Ferrol might put to sea and effect a junction with Villeneuve's combined fleet. Accordingly, he declined to attack and headed northeast with his prizes.\nVilleneuve's report claims that at first he intended to attack, but in the very light breezes it took all day to come up to the British and he decided not to risk combat late in the day. On 24 July a change in the wind put the Franco-Spanish fleet to the windward of the British—the ideal position for an attack—but instead of attacking, Villeneuve turned away to the south. When he arrived at A Coruña on 1 August, he received orders from Napoleon to proceed immediately to Brest and Boulogne, but perhaps believing a false report of a superior British fleet in the Bay of Biscay, he returned to Cádiz, arriving on 21 August.\nFile:Sir Robt Calder's Action, July 22nd 1805.jpg|Defiance, Windsor Castle, Prince of Wales, Repulse, Raisonable, and Glory, an engraving after Thomas Whitcombe\nFile:Battle of Cape Finisterre.jpg|Day after the action – British frigates have two Spanish prizes, the Firme and the San Rafael under tow on the right. Painting by William Anderson\nAftermath\nBoth sides claimed victory in the battle's aftermath. The British with more right as they had a numerically inferior force, losing no ships with losses of 41 officers and men killed and 162 wounded. The Franco-Spanish meanwhile had losses of 476 officers and men killed and wounded, with a further 800 ill. In addition the Spanish had lost two ships of the line, the Firme and the San Rafael which were captured in a battered state with over 1,200 sailors and marines captured. The French ships Atlas, Pluton and the Spanish Espana were also badly mauled.  Calder was relieved of his command, court-martialled, and sentenced to be severely reprimanded for his failure to renew the battle on 23 and 24 July.  He never served at sea again. Villeneuve failed to push on Brest, retired to refit at Vigo, then slipped into Coruña, and on 15 August decided to make for Cadiz.\nThe withdrawal to Cadiz ruined all hopes of Napoleon to make an invasion and landing in England, thus Napoleon, frustrated by Villeneuve's lack of élan, was forced to abandon his plan of invading Britain. Instead, the ''Armée d'Angleterre, renamed the Grande Armée, left Boulogne on 27 August to counter the threat from Austria and Russia. A few weeks after the battle he wrote: \"Gravina is all genius and decision in combat. If Villeneuve had had those qualities, the battle of Finisterre would have been a complete victory.\"\nVilleneuve and the combined fleets remained at Cádiz until they came out to their destruction at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October.\nThe two captured Spanish ships of the line Firme and San Rafael were taken into Plymouth. Whilst there they were turned into prison hulks.\nOrder of battle\nBritish fleet\n* Calder had fifteen ships of the line (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ), two frigates ( and ), and two smaller vessels.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 |Ship\n! colspan=2 |Casualties\n! colspan=3 |Damage\n|-\n!Dead\n!Wounded\n!Rigging\n!Masts and spars\n!Hull and others\n|-\n| (74), Capt.
