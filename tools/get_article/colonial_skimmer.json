It was the start of a line of very similar aircraft designed by David Thurston.\nDesign and development\nIn 1946 David Thurston established the Colonial Aircraft Corporation at Sanford Maine to build his design for a small amphibian flying boat, the Skimmer.\nThe resulting design was an all-metal shoulder-wing cantilever monoplane with a single-step hull and stabilizing floats fitted under each wing. A retractable tricycle landing gear allowed land operation. The Avco Lycoming engine with a pusher propeller was pylon-mounted above and aft of the enclosed cockpit.\nThe cabin had side-by-side seating for a pilot and passenger with room behind for another passenger.\nNew Jersey in 1970.]]\nThe prototype XC-1 Skimmer first flew on July 17, 1948, powered by a  Lycoming O-235 engine, but was later re-engined with a  Lycoming O-290 engine.\n24 examples of the C-1 Skimmer were built and these were followed by 18 examples of the higher powered four-seat variant known as the C-2 Skimmer IV, which through a succession of companies became the Lake Buccaneer.\nSpecifications (C-1)\nJane's All the World's Aircraft 1958-59''\n|prime units?=imp\n|crew=1\n|capacity=2 passengers\n|length ft=23\n|length in=6\n|span ft=34\n|span in=0\n|height ft=8\n|height in=10\n|wing area sqft=150.6\n|empty weight lb=1450\n|gross weight lb=2150\n|fuel capacity= normal ;  overload\n|eng1 number=1\n|eng1 name=Lycoming O-320\n|eng1 type=4-cylinder air-cooled horizontally-opposed  piston engine\n|eng1 hp=150\n|prop blade number=2\n|prop name=Hartzell\n|prop dia ft=6\n|prop dia in=2\n|prop dia note= constant-speed pusher propeller\n|max speed mph=125\n|max speed note=at\n|cruise speed mph=112-123\n|stall speed mph=50\n|range miles=500-600\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=700\n|wing loading lb/sqft=14.27\n|wing loading note=\n|power/mass=\n|more performance=\n*Take-off run:  on water in still air\n*Take-off run:  on land in still air\n|avionics=\n}}\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*"
