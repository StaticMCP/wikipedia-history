Nominations are made by the public and in 2019 over 100,000 public votes were expected across 18 categories.\nThe awards are organised by Thoumire's organisation Hands Up for Trad. Since 2008 the awards have been sponsored by MG Alba, and the event is televised on BBC Alba.\nSince 2019 the ceremony has included the awarding of The Belhaven Bursary for Innovation in Scottish Music, sponsored by Belhaven Brewery. The prize consists of £25,000, an ale brewed with the winner's name on it, an appearance at an event at Tartan Week in New York and the use of the winner's music in an advertising campaign. The cash prize is the largest music prize in Scotland, matched only by the Mercury Prize.\nAward winners\n2024\n*Album of the Year: The Waiting Room by Eamonn Nugent\n*Event of the Year: Skipinnish at Edinburgh Castle\n*Finlayson Scots Singer of the Year: Beth Malcolm\n*Club of the Year: Ardersier International Folk Club, Moray\n*Community Project of the Year: Fèis air an Oir\n*Composer of the Year: Alec Dalglish\n*Gaelic Singer of the Year: Emma 'Scalpay' MacLeod\n*Live Act of the Year: Niteworks\n*Music Tutor of the Year: Douglas Montgomery\n*Musician of the Year: Ciorstaidh Beaton\n*Original Work of the Year: Ar Cànan 's ar Ceòl by Trail West\n*Scottish Dance Band of the Year: Pure Scotch Ceilidh Band\n*Scottish Folk Band of the Year: The Paul McKenna Band\n*Scottish Pipe Band of the Year: Skye Youth Pipe Band\n*Trad Music in the Media: Crùnluath / Piping Sounds with Michael Steele & Ewen Henderson\n*Up and Coming Artist of the Year: Falasgair\n*Venue of the Year: Eden Court, Inverness\n2023\n*Album of the Year: Duncan Chisholm - Black Cuillin\n*Musician of the Year: Julie Fowlis\n*Citty Finlayson Scots Singer of the Year: Iona Fyfe\n*Gaelic Singer of the Year: Eilidh Cormack\n*Live Act of the Year: Trail West\n*Scottish Dance Band: Iain MacPhail\n*Scottish Folk Band: Blazin’ Fiddles\n*Scottish Pipe Band: The Peoples Ford Boghall and Bathgate Caledonia Pipe Band.\n*Up and Coming Artist: The Shands\n*Original Work: The Clearances Again by Donald Francis MacNeil and Skipinnish\n*Club of the Year: The Gaitherin South Sessions in Glasgow\n*Venue of the Year: The Tolbooth, Stirling\n*Event of the Year: Orkney Folk Festival\n*Community Project of the Year: Fèis Rois Ceilidh Trail\n*Trad Music in the Media BBC Radio Scotland’s Travelling Folk\n*Composer of the Year: Heidi Talbot\n*Music Tutor of the Year: Domhnall Bàn MacDonald.\n*Sue Wilson New Writer Award: Angus MacPhail of The Oban Times\n*Services to Gaelic Award: John Urquhart\n*The Janet Paisley Services to Scots Language Award: Donald Smith\n*Graphics Designer of the Year: Somhairle MacDonald\n*Traditional Music Enabler of the Year: Mhari McLeman of Shetland Folk Festival\n*Photographer of the Year: Euan Robertson Photography\n*Venue Technician of the Year: Gary Craig of The Ceilidh Place\n2022\nThe ceremony was held at the Caird Hall in Dundee.\n*Event of the Year: Hebcelt Festival (Lewis)\n*Album of The Year: For The Night by Elephant Sessions\n*Citty Finlayson Scots Singer of the Year: Beth Malcolm\n*Club of The Year: Aberdeen Folk Club\n*Community Music Project of the Year: Isle of Arran Music School\n*Composer of the Year: Rachel Newton, Lauren MacColl (Heal & Harrow)\n*Gaelic Singer of the Year: Ruairidh Gray\n*Lighting Designer of the Year: Greig Shankland\n*Live Act of the Year: Skerryvore\n*Live Sound Engineer of the Year: Scott Turnbull\n*Music Producer of the Year: Anna Massie\n*Music Tutor of the Year: Charlie Mckerron\n*Musician of the Year: Megan Henderson\n*Original Work of the Year: Talamh Beò – Living Land, commissioned by Coigach & Assynt Living Landscape Partnership Scheme\n*Recording Studio of the Year: GloWorm Recording (Glasgow)\n*Scottish Dance Band of the Year: Alan Crookston Band\n*Scottish Folk Band of the Year: Breabach\n*Scottish Pipe Band of the Year: Inveraray and District Pipe Band\n*Services to Gaelic: Dr Anne Lorne Gillies\n*Studio Engineer of the Year: Keith Morrison (Wee Studio)\n*The Hamish Henderson Services to Traditional Music Awards: Caroline Maclennan from HebCelt Festival\n*The Janet Paisley Services to Scots Language: Anne Donovan\n*Trad Music in the Media: Heading West: a story about a band called Shooglenifty\n*Trad Video of the Year: She Moves Me by Kim Carnie\n*Up & Coming Artist of the Year: Valtos\n*Venue of the Year: Knoydart Community Hall\n2021\nThe ceremony was held at the Engine Works in Glasgow.\n*Original Work of the Year: 7 Years Old by Calum MacPhail\n*Community Project of the Year: Riddell Fiddles’ Two Towns Housing Estate Youth Musical Outreach Programme\n*Event of the Year: Celtic Connections\n*Gaelic Singer of the Year: Kim Carnie\n*Musician of the Year: Iona Fyfe\n*Online Performance of 2021: Norrie \"Tago\" MacIver Live Streams\n*Citty Finlayson Scots Singer of the Year: Ellie Beaton\n*Trad Video of the Year: Doddies Dream by Bruce MacGregor\n*Trad Music in the Media: Ceòl is Cràdh (Mental health in musicians’ documentary) on BBC Alba.\n*Up and Coming Artist of the Year: The Canny Band\n*Music Tutor of the Year: Craig Muirhead, Director of Piping and Drumming at Strathallan School\n*Album of the Year: Where the World Is Thin by Kris Drever\n2020\nThe awards had been due to be staged in the Caird Hall Dundee, but were moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and presented by Alistair Heather and Mary Ann Kennedy.
