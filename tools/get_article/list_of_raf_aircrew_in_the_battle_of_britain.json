(There are a few names missing from this list; check on The Battle of Britain Society web site.)\nHistory\nIn 1942, the Air Ministry made the decision to compile a list from records of the names of pilots who had lost their lives as a result of the fighting during the Battle of Britain for the purpose of building a national memorial. This became the Battle of Britain Chapel at Westminster Abbey, which was unveiled by King George VI on 10 July 1947. The Roll of Honour within the Chapel contains the names of 1,497 pilots and aircrew killed or mortally wounded during the Battle.\nNothing was done officially, however, to define the qualifications for the classification of a Battle of Britain airman until 9 November 1960. AMO N850, published by the Air Ministry, stated for the first time the requirements for the awarding of the Battle of Britain clasp to the 1939-1945 Star, and listed the 71 units which were deemed to have been under the control of RAF Fighter Command.\nIn 1955 Flt Lt John Holloway, a serving RAF officer, began a personal challenge to compile a complete list of \"The Few\". After fourteen years of research Flt Lt Holloway had 2,946 names on the list. Of these airmen, 537 were killed during the Battle or later died of wounds received.\nThe Battle of Britain Memorial Trust, founded by Geoffrey Page, raised funds for the construction of the Battle of Britain Memorial at Capel-le-Ferne near Folkestone in Kent. The Memorial, unveiled by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on 9 July 1993, shares the site with the Christopher Foxley-Norris Memorial Wall on which a complete list of \"The Few\" is engraved.\nMore recently, the Battle of Britain Monument on the Victoria Embankment in London was unveiled on 18 September 2005 by Charles, Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The idea for the monument was conceived by the Battle of Britain Historical Society which then set about raising funds for its construction. The outside of the monument is lined with bronze plaques listing all the Allied airmen who took part in the Battle.\nLists of names\nSee also\n*Non-British personnel in the RAF during the Battle of Britain\n*List of World War II aces from the United Kingdom\n*List of World War II aces by country\n*List of World War II air aces\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*Ramsay, Winston, ed.
