Henry Warren was contracted to haul supplies to forts in the west of Texas, including Fort Richardson, Fort Griffin, and Fort Concho. Traveling down the Jacksboro-Belknap road heading towards Salt Creek Crossing, they encountered William Tecumseh Sherman. Less than an hour after encountering the famous General, they spotted a rather large group of riders ahead. They quickly realized that these were Native American warriors, probably Kiowa and/or Comanche.\nThe corn train quickly shifted into a ring formation, and all the mules were put into the center of the ring. The warriors destroyed the corn supplies, killing and mutilating seven of the wagoner's bodies. Five men managed to escape, one of which was Thomas Brazeale who reached Fort Richardson on foot, some 20 miles away. As soon as Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie learned of the incident, he informed Sherman. Sherman and Mackenzie searched for the warriors responsible for the raid. In the end, notwithstanding the intervention of Guipago (Lone Wolf), well equipped with loaded rifles and revolvers and ready to fight, three of the war leaders involved were arrested at Fort Sill: Satanta (White Bear), Satank (Sitting Bear), and Ado-ete (Big Tree). Satank attempted to escape and was killed while traveling to Fort Richardson for trial.  The other two were tried and convicted of murder.\nRaids\nMany of the Native American warriors came from the Fort Sill Reservation in Indian Territory, confident that they could terrorize Texas and escape to safety across the Red River, which was another legal jurisdiction. The ambush had been planned by a large band of Kiowa warriors, approximately 180 warriors, under the leadership of Satanta, Satank, Mamanti, Big Tree, White Horse, Fast Bear, Yellow Wolf, and Eagle Heart. Hidden in a thicket of scrub in the Salt Creek Prairie, they observed the slow approach of General William Tecumseh Sherman's inspection retinue of approx 18 men. Although the Kiowa war party outnumbered the US Army troop by ten to one, they did not attack, maybe because the Army troopers would have inflicted too many casualties.\nThe Kiowa story is that the previous night, Mamanti (\"He Walking-above\"), the shaman, had prophesied that this small party would be followed by a larger one with more plunder for the taking. The braves were rewarded three hours later when 10 mule-drawn wagons filled with army corn and fodder trundled into view. The Kiowa attacked and quickly overwhelmed this convoy. Seven muleskinners were killed, while five managed to escape.\nOne of the mule skinners was tortured to death with fire by the Kiowa, his tongue cut out. The warriors lost three of their own but left with 40 mules heavily laden with supplies. It was well after dark before the white survivors reached the nearby Fort Richardson and told their harrowing tale to the very officer whose party had passed unharmed under the Kiowa guns, General Sherman, who ordered the arrests of the Indian war chiefs at Fort Sill. Satank was killed in the train as he tried to escape the column of United States soldiers. Satanta and Big Tree became the first Indians to be tried in a US court. At the trial of Satanta and Big Tree, Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5–6 July in Jack County, Texas. They were paroled two years later thanks to the steady behavior adopted by Guipago in his dealing with the government agents, and were sent back to their people.\nHistorical markers\nTexas roadside marker\nThe site of the Warren Wagon Train raid received a historic marker in 1977 which is 1.5 miles west of the actual location.\nTexas centennial marker\nA [http://www.texasescapes.com/TRIPS/Young-County-Buried-Here-Texas-Centennial-Marker.htm Texas Centennial Marker] was placed at the actual location of the attack. The marker is a white granite oblisque surrounded by a low steel rail fence and was put in place in 1936. The inscription is a follows.\nBURIED HERE are the remains of seven teamsters, Nathan S. Long, N.J. Baxter, Jesse Bowman, James S and Samuel E. Elliott, James and Thomas Williams.

On May 18, 1871 while hauling forage between Jacksboro and Fort Griffin.\nOriginal monument\nCapt. Henry Warren erected a nicely painted wooden monument where the raid occurred. It has long since disappeared. The following is transcribed from a journal entry of M. K. Kellogg's Texas Journal, 1872. Kellogg transcribed the inscription on the original monument.
