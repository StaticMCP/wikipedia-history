She was originally named Society Adventurer, but after Discoverer Reederei was unable to take delivery of the vessel due to financial troubles, the completed ship was laid up at the shipyard for almost two years. In 1993, she was acquired by Hanseatic Tours (which later merged with Hapag-Lloyd) and renamed Hanseatic. In 2018, she was chartered to One Ocean Expeditions and renamed RCGS Resolute through a partnership with the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. In 2021, she was acquired by Heritage Expeditions and, following an extensive refit, entered service in 2022 with her current name.\nGeneral characteristics\nHeritage Adventurer is  long overall and  between perpendiculars, has a beam of  and draws  of water with a displacement of . Her gross tonnage is 8,445; net tonnage 2,573; and deadweight tonnage 1,177 tonnes. The ship's hull and propulsion system are strengthened for navigation in ice-covered waters according to the Germanischer Lloyd ice class notation E4, which is equivalent to the highest Finnish-Swedish ice class for merchant ships, 1A Super.\nOriginally built to cater to the five-star luxury cruise market, interiors on Heritage Adventurers six passenger-accessible decks were designed by the German architect Wilfried Köhnemann. The vessel has 88 outside cabins and, above the bridge deck, four suites. The original design capacity was for a total of 184 passengers served by a crew of 125. Public spaces include a restaurant, multiple lounges, and a 78-seat theater. The ship carries 14 Zodiac inflatable boats to take passengers ashore during expedition cruises.\nThe ship's propulsion system consists of two eight-cylinder MaK 8M453C four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines, each rated  at 600rpm, driving two controllable pitch propellers. Onboard electrical power is generated by two  six-cylinder MaK 6M332 auxiliary diesel generators and two  main engine driven shaft generators. For maneuvering in ports, the ship has a  transverse bow thruster. Heritage Adventurer has a service speed of  and a cruising range of .\nCareer\nSociety Adventurer\nIn December 1989, the German cruise ship company Discoverer Reederei decided to order a $75&nbsp;million expedition cruise ship for its US-based subsidiary Society Expeditions. The shipbuilding contract was awarded to Rauma Yards, a new Finnish company established in August of the same year following the disbanding of Rauma-Repola's shipyard group. The ship, launched on 5 January 1991 as Society Adventurer, was intended for adventure-style cruises to remote destinations such as Antarctica and had, among other features, an ice-strengthened hull. However, Discoverer Reederei was unable to take delivery of the vessel in the following summer due to financial troubles and also had to cancel a sister ship that had already been contracted. As a result, the ownership of the vessel was transferred to Rauma Yards's newly established Bahamas-registered subsidiary, Society Adventurer Shipping Company, on 7 June 1991. Later that year, Rauma Yards was merged with another local shipbuilder, Hollming, as Finnyards. While on a lay-up at the yard, Society Adventurer was inspected by a number of parties interested in acquiring the vessel, among them the future president of the United States Donald Trump who visited Rauma in 1992.\nHanseatic\nlivery in Paradise Harbour, Antarctica in 1994.]]\nIn 1993, the ship was chartered and shortly afterwards purchased by the German expedition cruise operator Hanseatic Tours. The company had been established two years earlier by Dirk Moldenhauer, who had been the last captain of German Atlantic Line's cruise ship Hanseatic in 1973 and later acquired rights to the classic Hamburg Atlantic Line logo, livery and the name \"Hanseatic\". Society Adventurer was renamed Hanseatic on 23 March 1993, becoming the fourth ship to bear the name, and the original blue-yellow-white Discoverer Reederei livery was replaced with the white hull and red decorative stripes. The vessel's maiden cruise from Hamburg to Sevilla began on 27 March 1993. When Hanseatic Tours was merged with Hapag-Lloyd Cruises in 1997, Hanseatic retained her original name as well as Hamburg Atlantic Line livery and funnel logo until rebranding in 2011.\nHanseatic remained in Hapag-Lloyd's fleet until 2018. Over the ship's 25-year career and a total of 667 cruises, she made 128 expeditions to Antarctica, two voyages to the Northern Sea Route (Northeast Passage), and transited the full length of the Northwest Passage 11 times. The latter is a record number for passenger ships, exceeded only by the Russian icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov which is also used for expedition cruises. Hanseatic also holds the record for having been further north among passenger-carrying ships that are not icebreakers: on 26 August 2014, the vessel reached ,  from the North Pole, due to unusually easy ice conditions in the Russian Arctic at that time.\nRCGS Resolute\nIn June 2017, the Canada-based cruise ship operator One Ocean Expeditions announced that it would expand its fleet of expedition cruise ships with a long-term charter of the former Hanseatic.\nThe ship would be renamed RCGS Resolute after the 1850-built Royal Navy Arctic exploration vessel HMS Resolute as well as the Inuit hamlet Resolute in Nunavut. Furthermore, the ship would carry the initials of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS) with whom One Ocean Expeditions had partnered. After concluding her career with Hapag-Lloyd, the vessel was drydocked at Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany where a so-called duck tail sponson was added to the stern. In October 2018, she headed to Canada under her new name and a Portuguese flag, and with a new livery.\nIn 2019, the company's financial difficulties began to surface with the sudden withdrawal of the Russian research vessels Akademik Ioffe and Akademik Sergey Vavilov chartered from the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology. Although One Ocean Expeditions initially called the Russian owner's action a contract violation, it was later revealed that the company had failed to pay charter and fueling fees to the intermediate charterer Terragelida Ship Management which had then terminated the contract. This left One Ocean Expeditions with just one ship, RCGS Resolute. In August, she was briefly arrested in Iqaluit over a C$100,000 payment dispute. While this issue was reportedly solved quickly, another arrest over non-payment of services and crew wages followed in Halifax next month. Finally, in October One Ocean Expeditions was forced to cancel an Antarctic cruise midway after the vessel could not be refueled due to the company's non-payment of outstanding debts. Shortly after the ship's 140 passengers disembarked, RCGS Resolute was detained in Buenos Aires over \"significant debt\". The company entered administration in January 2020.\nOn 5 March 2020, RCGS Resolute left Buenos Aires after the ship's registered owner, Bunnys Adventure & Cruise Shipping Company Limited, paid a total of US$3.6&nbsp;million of One Ocean Expeditions's outstanding debt to fuel suppliers, ship agents and crew members in order to avoid a court-ordered sale of the vessel. However, in June 2020 it was reported that RCGS Resolute would be sold in an auction in Curaçao to cover the shipowner's nearly $4 million debt. The ship was reportedly sold for $600,000 on 22 June 2020.\nHeritage Adventurer\nat Cape Royds]]\nIn 2021, Heritage Expeditions, an expedition cruise company based in Christchurch, New Zealand, announced that it had acquired the ship on long term contract. An extensive refit of the vessel was undertaken in Greece and Turkey. During the refit, the passenger accommodation was reduced from 184 to 140. Heritage Expeditions said that this was to provide a more comfortable and spacious experience on board.  The hull was painted blue with gold bands, and the vessel was renamed Heritage Adventurer. It began cruises for Heritage Expeditions in October 2022.\nIn September 2025, the first stage of a programme of refurbishment work was carried out on the guest accommodation on decks 5 and 6, and in the dining room and bistro. Stages 2 and 3 covering the rest of the guest accommodation and other shared areas will take place in 2026 and 2027.\nIncidents\n1996 grounding\nOn 29 August 1996, Hanseatic ran aground in Simpson Strait in the Canadian Arctic. The vessel was eleven days into an eastbound transit along the Northwest Passage with 149 passengers and 110 crew, and had stopped at Gjoa Haven to let passengers ashore. Unknowingly to the crew, a green buoy marking a shallow shoal had not been removed after the previous navigating season and, over the winter months, had been moved to the northeast by about  by drifting ice. Shortly after departure, Hanseatic ran aground on the shoal at .\nWith no danger of the vessel sinking, Hanseatics passengers were allowed to explore the nearby islands using the ship's boats until the Russian icebreaker Kapitan Dranitsyn arrived to pick up the passengers on 5 September and continue the Northwest Passage expedition under charter by Hanseatic Tours. Hanseatic itself was successfully refloated on 8 September. While the ship's hull was damaged during the grounding, no oil spilled to the sea and there were no injuries among the passengers or the crew.\n1997 grounding\nOn 14 July 1997, Hanseatic was grounded on a sand bank in Murchisonfjorden in Svalbard with 145 passengers on board. No injuries nor damage to the ship was reported, and the passengers were again taken to explore nearby islands on Hanseatics Zodiac boats while awaiting evacuation. By 17 July, the ship had been refloated and was heading towards Longyearbyen for inspection.\n2005 grounding\nIn August 2005, Hanseatic ran aground near the island of Lurøya on the Norwegian coast, just south of the Arctic Circle, with 160 passengers on board. While the vessel was not in danger of sinking despite a  hole in one of her ballast water tank, the passengers and part of the crew were nonetheless evacuated.\n2013 drydock fire\nOn 13 June 2013, a fire broke out in Hanseatics engine room due to hot work in one of the ballast water tanks while the ship was in a drydock at the Bredo Shipyard in Bremerhaven. Due to delays in drydocking and additional repairs required by the fire, four cruises between 17 June and 1 August had to be cancelled.\n2020 collision\nOn 30 March 2020, RCGS Resolute was involved in an incident in international waters off the Venezuelan coast which led to the sinking of the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat  (GC-23) following a collision with the cruise ship. RCGS Resolute suffered only minor damage. Because the cruise ship was a Portuguese−flagged vessel, an investigation was conducted by the Office for the Investigation of Maritime Accidents and the Aeronautical Meteorology Authority ( or GAMA) of Portugal. The investigation report discussed the possibility that the unexpected change in Naiguatás heading just before the collision, as reported by RCGS Resolute, may have been caused by a suction effect between the vessels as the faster patrol boat passed the bow of the cruise ship. Although the collision may have not been intentional ramming, the conclusion was nonetheless that the incident that led to the sinking of Naiguatá was the result of a deliberate act initiated by the Venezuelan Navy rather than an accidental occurrence.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.expeditioncruisespecialists.com/ships/heritage-adventurer#deck-plan Heritage Adventurer - deck plan] at Expedition Cruise Specialists\n* [https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/360622485/look-around-heritage-adventurer Video tour of vessel - Wellington, March 2025] at Stuff"
