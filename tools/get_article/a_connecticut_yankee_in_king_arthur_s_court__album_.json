All of the songs were written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke.\nReception\nBillboard liked it saying:\n:Crosby’s in rare form for this album of tunes from the Connecticut Yankee'' flick. His work on the top ballad \"Once\" is more reminiscent of the Bing of the thirties than anything he’s done in a long while – and the song is a natural. (It’s done twice here – one by Bing as a solo and again as a reprise with Rhonda Fleming). Other tune to watch is \"Stub,\" which could have the makings of another \"Swing on a Star\".  Also represented from the original cast are Murvyn Vye, Bill Bendix and Cedric Hardwicke. If picture is as big as advance word has it, then album is in.\nThe album reached the No. 5 position in Billboard's album charts.\nTrack listing\nThese newly issued songs were featured in a 3-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album A-699.\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-bgcolor=#D3D3D4\n| width=10%|Side || Title || Recording date || Performed by || Time\n|- bgcolor=#F2F0E6\n| colspan=5|Disc 1 (24524):\n|-\n| A. || \"Once and for Always\" ||  December 27, 1947 ||  Bing Crosby with the Ken Darby Singers and Victor Young and His Orchestra. || 2:54\n|-\n| B. || \"If You Stub Your Toe on the Moon\" ||  December 27, 1947 ||  Bing Crosby with The Rhythmaires and Victor Young and His Orchestra. || 3:06\n|- bgcolor=#F2F0E6\n| colspan=5|Disc 2 (24525):\n|-\n| A. || \"Busy Doing Nothing\" ||  December 27, 1947 ||  Bing Crosby with Cedric Hardwicke, William Bendix and Victor Young and His Orchestra. || 3:02\n|-\n| B. || \"'Twixt Myself and Me\"* ||  December 18, 1947 ||  Murvyn Vye with Victor Young and His Orchestra. || 3:00\n|- bgcolor=#F2F0E6\n| colspan=5|Disc 3 (24526):\n|-\n| A. || \"Once and for Always\" ||  December 18, 1947 ||  Bing Crosby and Rhonda Fleming with Victor Young and His Orchestra. || 3:09\n|-\n| B. || \"When Is Sometime\" ||  December 18, 1947 ||  Rhonda Fleming with Victor Young and His Orchestra. || 3:05\n|}\nThis song was cut from the film after its world premiere at Radio City Music Hall, New York.\nOther releases\nDecca included all the Crosby songs on Decca DL 4261 in 1962 for the LP set Bing’s Hollywood.\nReferences"
