      "text": "# Everton West (Liverpool ward)\n\nEverton West ward is an electoral district of Liverpool City Council within the Liverpool Riverside constituency.\nThe ward was created for the elections held on 4 May 2023 following a 2022 review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, which decided that the previous 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The Everton West ward was created as a single-member ward from the western half of the former Everton ward. The ward boundaries follow Scotland Road, the southern boundary of the Great Homer Street District Centre, Conway Street, Heyworth Street, Everton Road, Erskine Street, Islington and Hunter Street, excluding Liverpool John Moores University's City Campus.
