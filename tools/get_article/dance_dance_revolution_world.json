      "text": "# Dance Dance Revolution World\n\nis a music video game released in 2024. The latest version/installment of Dance Dance Revolution, it is the sequel to Dance Dance Revolution A3, and the 19th installment of the Dance Dance Revolution arcade series in Japan (the 10th outside of Japan). The game was released as a software upgrade for LCD-based cabinets on June 12, 2024, in Asia, Australasia and the United States.\nRelease\nDance Dance Revolution World was released on June 12, 2024, in Asia (including Japan, South Korea and several other countries) Australia, New Zealand and the United States. It is available as an online update to Dance Dance Revolution A3 LCD-based cabinets.\nAs is the case with Dance Dance Revolution A3, Dance Dance Revolution World is currently unavailable in Canada, Europe and several American states. In North America, DDR World is available at Round1 USA, but not at Dave & Buster's, which continues to operate Dance Dance Revolution A20 Plus at 71 locations.\nThis is the first release of Dance Dance Revolution to be unsupported on CRT-based arcade cabinets, as Dance Dance Revolution A3 is the last supported version. Early DDR games, from the first release in 1998 to Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2 in 2007, were sold with brand new CRT-based cabinets. Arcades were able to install newer releases on these cabinets by purchasing a Bemani PC upgrade kit. An offline version of Dance Dance Revolution A3 was released on April 30, 2024, for these cabinets. This offline release is also supported on these cabinets if the CRT monitor is replaced with a widescreen LCD monitor.\nMusic\nDance Dance Revolution World features 117 new songs , for a total of 1,312 songs. The new songs generally consist of Konami originals, but also include 21 licensed songs. The songs \"Cheerleader\" and \"Knock Yourself Out XD\" by Porter Robinson are the only non-Japanese new licenses, and they were added to DDR World on May 1, 2025, along with their respective music videos. Additionally, three Robinson songs from Dance Dance Revolution A3 are playable in DDR World since the game's launch.\nAmong the returning songs, DDR World reintroduced \"No Tears Left to Cry\" by Ariana Grande at launch, which was removed in online versions of previous releases and all versions of DDR A3. The song \"Play Hard\" by David Guetta featuring Ne-Yo and Akon was initially available, but it was removed in DDR World on July 2, 2024, about five years after it was introduced to the DDR series.\nGameplay Features\nDance Dance Revolution World introduces subtle but impactful gameplay refinements. A new modifier called CONSTANT adjusts arrow visibility based on BPM, enhancing visual rhythm accuracy and offering a more dynamic step experience. The game also debuts DUO MODE, allowing two players to perform synchronized routines with mirrored step charts, encouraging cooperative play and expanding possibilities for competitive doubles formats.\nScroll speed customization has been expanded, now adjustable in 0.05x increments, giving players finer control over timing and readability. This is especially useful in high-level tournaments, where precision and personalization are key.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/ddr/ddrworld/index.html Official website]"
