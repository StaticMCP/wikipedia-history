Created and produced by Bill Dare and hosted by Marcus Brigstocke for the 2009 episodes and Jo Brand for the 2011 special episode, each episode features a celebrity guest trying out new experiences. Based on the original radio version broadcast on BBC Radio 4, the title comes from the fact that Dare has never seen the Star Wars films. An eight part series was recorded in March 2009, with guests including John Humphrys, Esther Rantzen, Rory McGrath and Hugh Dennis.\nA new host, Jo Brand, presented a December 2011 episode.\nFormat\nEach episode of ''I've Never Seen Star Wars'' features a different guest trying things they have never done before, and seeing whether they liked their experiences or not. Some of the experiences come from the show's special list, which contains a range of different experiences, such as certain books, films, foodstuffs etc. The experiences tend to be a mixture of things from the list and things the guest wants to try out themselves. The guest and Brigstocke try out the experience and the guest gives their view on it, as well as giving each experiences a mark out of ten.\nSeries 1\n}}\nSpecial\n}}\nNotes\n*[http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/tv/ive_never_seen_star_wars/episodes/ ''I've Never Seen Star Wars'' (The TV Version) – Episode Guide.] Published by the British Comedy Guide.
