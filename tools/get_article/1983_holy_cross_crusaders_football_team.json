      "text": "# 1983 Holy Cross Crusaders football team\n\nThe 1983 Holy Cross Crusaders football team was an American football team that represented the College of the Holy Cross as an independent during the 1983 NCAA Division I-AA football season. The Crusaders ranked No. 3 nationally but lost in the quarterfinals of the Division I-AA playoff.\nIn their third year under head coach Rick E. Carter, the Crusaders compiled a 9–2–1 record (9–1–1 regular season). Harry Flaherty, Matt Martin and Rob Porter were the team captains.\nAn eight-game winning streak to open the campaign saw Holy Cross steadily climb in the weekly national rankings, reaching No. 1 in time for their last regular-season game. After suffering their first loss of the year in that season-ender—to Division I-A Boston College, in a game played at the New England Patriots home stadium—the Crusaders dropped to No. 3 in the Division I-AA rankings, and earned a playoff first-round bye before being eliminated in the second round.\nHoly Cross played its home games, including its first-ever home playoff game, at Fitton Field on the college campus in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nSchedule\n| September 17 | @ | UMass |\n| Alumni Stadium | Hadley, MA | W 17 0\n| 13,591 |\n| September 24 | @ | New Hampshire | 12\n| Cowell Stadium | Durham, NH | W 42 30\n| 10,000 |\n| October 1 | @ | Dartmouth | 9\n| Memorial Field | Hanover, NH | W 41 14\n| 10,753 |\n| October 8 |   | #2 Colgate | 6\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 21 18\n| 21,551 |\n| October 15 | @ | Connecticut | 4\n| Memorial Stadium | Storrs, CT | W 20 16\n| 13,090 |\n| October 22 |   | Brown^ | 4\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 31 10\n| 16,004 |\n| October 29 |   | Columbia | 2\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA | W 77 28\n| 12,861 |\n| November 5 | @ | Harvard | 2\n| Harvard Stadium | Boston, MA | T 10 10\n| 8,000 |\n| November 12 | @ | Delaware | 3\n| Delaware Stadium | Newark, DE | W 24 0\n| 16,432 |\n| November 19 | v | Boston College | 1\n| Sullivan Stadium | Foxborough, MA (rivalry) | L 7 47\n| 38,512 |\n| December 3 |   | #9 Western Carolina | 3\n| Fitton Field | Worcester, MA (NCAA Division I-AA Quarterfinal) | L 21 28\n| 10,814 |\n}}\nReferences"
