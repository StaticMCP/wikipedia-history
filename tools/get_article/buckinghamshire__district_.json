It covers about four-fifths of area of the ceremonial county and about two-thirds of its population; the City of Milton Keynes accounts for the remainder.  The district is administered by Buckinghamshire Council, a unitary authority.\n]]\nHistory\nThe non-metropolitan county became a unitary authority area on 1 April 2020, following the merger of four boroughs and districts Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks and Wycombe as part of the 2019–2023 structural changes to local government in England.\nMain settlements\n* Amersham\n* Aylesbury\n* Beaconsfield\n* Buckingham\n* Burnham\n* Chesham\n* High Wycombe\n* Marlow\nReferences"
