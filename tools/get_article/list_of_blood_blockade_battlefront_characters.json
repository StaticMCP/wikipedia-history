His eyes have their limits; when overused, they have a tendency to \"shatter\", causing his eyes to bleed.

Klaus is also very intelligent, being able to play a chess-like called Prosfair for a period of ninety-nine hours against a being that has studied the game for thousands of years.\nHis ultimate technique allows him to imprison the Blood Breeds, as they can not be killed due to their immortal nature, but to do so, he must learn the enemy's true name, thus requiring Leo using his powers to reveal it.\nZapp Renfro\n:\nis a hot-blooded, womanizing Libra member and master of the 's Kagutsuchi branch, which allows him to manipulate his blood into blades and explosions.

However, she is shown to be somewhat caring of her teammates at certain points in the series, mostly evidenced towards Leo. Her power is erasing her presence, which needs a link (a chain) to connect her to the world in order to counter the effect of her ability or she will cease to exist.\nSteven A.
