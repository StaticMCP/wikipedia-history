Russia's armed aggression resulted in many people forced to leave their homes for places outside the war zone. Fleeing the war, people also saved the lives of animals: cats, dogs, bears, lions, chameleons, lemurs, etc., as well as famous pets such as Patron the dog and Shafa the cat. Besides Ukrainians, the film includes citizens of other countries who also took part in the rescue mission.\nThe main idea of the film boils down to a quote from Asia Serpinska, the founder of the Hostomel shelter: \"Save animals to stay human\".\nThis film is an attempt to show the events in Ukraine from a different angle, namely through the relationship between people and animals affected by the war.\n''\"This film was originally made with the Western audience in mind because it seemed to me that everyone in Ukraine already knew everything. But then I realized that a lot of what I filmed would be interesting and understandable to Ukrainians too. That's how I came up with the idea to make a separate movie for our audience and show it in Ukrainian cinemas, not on YouTube. I'm curious to see how it will turn out,\" Anton Ptushkin comments.\nRelease\nUs, Our Pets and the War'' will open the annual Doc Kyiv Fest international documentary film festival on 28–30 March 2024 and be available in Ukrainian cinemas starting from 4 April 2024. Green Light Films, a film distribution company, will be responsible for the Ukrainian distribution. Its goal is literally to give the green light to the positive changes in the industry.\nNotes\nExternal links\n*"
