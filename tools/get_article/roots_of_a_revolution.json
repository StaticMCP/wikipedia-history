Expanding on the 1984 double LP compilation of the same name it covers 1956 to 1963, but omits some of Brown's big hits from that time period, which can be found on Star Time. Most of the songs were recorded by Brown with his original vocal group, The Famous Flames, who received label credit on the LP version.\nTrack listing\nAll tracks composed by James Brown; except where indicated\n;Disc 1\n#\"I Feel That Old Feeling Coming On\" (Nafloyd Scott, Nashpendle Knox)\n#\"No, No, No, No\"\n#\"Hold My Baby's Hand\" (Bobby Byrd, James Brown, Nafloyd Scott, William Lee Diamond Smith)\n#\"Chonnie-On-Chon\" (Bobby Byrd, James Brown, Nafloyd Scott, William Lee Diamond Smith)\n#\"Just Won't Do Right\"\n#\"Let's Make It\"\n#\"Fine Old Foxy Self\"\n#\"Why Does Everything Happen to Me\"\n#\"Begging, Begging\" (Jessy D.
