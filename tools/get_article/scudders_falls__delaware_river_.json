It is popular with local whitewater enthusiasts.\nHistory\nScudders Falls derives its name from Richard Betts Scudder, who according to the Long Island Genealogy Surname Database, died in 1754 at \"Scudder's Falls, Hunterdon County.\" (This portion of Mercer County was part of Hunterdon County until 1838.) One of Richard Scudder's ancestors from Kent, England was named Henry Skudder. The k in the surname apparently became a c at some point in time, helping to give the falls its name.\nThe apostrophe was dropped by the United States Board on Geographic Names, which has deleted apostrophes from official geographic place names in all but five instances, hence the current name \"Scudders Falls.\" (BBC Television)}}\nThe falls lends its name to the Scudder Falls Bridge, located just downstream, and the Scudders Falls section of Ewing, New Jersey.\nGallery\nFile:2015-04-12 15 44 47 Sign at the entrance to the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park Scudders Falls Unit in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|Entrance to Scudders Falls access in Ewing, New Jersey\nNotes\nReferences"
