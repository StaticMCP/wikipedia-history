It is a brick -story structure, sharing party walls with adjoining buildings on either side.  Its brick facade is divided into two three-bay sections, with brick pilasters at the ends and in the center.  Above the first-floor storefront windows is a clerestory level, above which is an attic space, where each of the six bays has a small oculus window.  Above the second and fifth bays (the center bays of each group of three) is a rounded arch.  The building was built c. 1900 by the Dierks Lumber and Coal Company, which built the De Queen and Eastern Railroad, making the city the commercial center of Sevier County.  The building was acquired in 1908 by the Hayes Hardware Company.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Sevier County, Arkansas\nReferences"
