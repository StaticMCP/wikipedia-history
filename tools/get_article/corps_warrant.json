The Corps Warrant is updated periodically to reflect changes in the make-up of the army.\nHer Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom and its Overseas Territories is empowered to declare by Royal Warrant, what bodies of the Military Forces are Corps for the purposes of the Army Act (enlistment, etc.) the Reserve Forces Act, 1882, and the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act, 1907. Corps and Regiments are not listed on the Corps Warrant according to their order in the British Army order-of-precedence.\n* Corps Warrant, 1926\n* Corps Warrant, 1951\nReferences"
