A second facility  (codenamed \"Richard I\") was established under Radobýl mountain in Central Bohemia.\nAttacks\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+valign=top| Chronology\n! | Date\n! | Target\n! class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n|\n| Zeppelin Works\n| Allied intelligence had suspected the Zeppelin Works () was involved with the V-2 rocket.\n|-\n|\n| Zeppelin Works\n|  Operation Bellicose targeted suspected Würzburg radar production at Friedrichshafen. (In early June, a CIU photo interpreter (Claude Wavell) had identified a stack of ribbed baskets--Würzburg radar reflectors—at the Zeppelin Works, Winston Churchill had reviewed the photos on June 14, and No. 5 Group RAF received attack orders on June 16.) The bombing hit the Zeppelin Works' V-2 production which had only produced a few V-2 tanks and fuselage sections by 20 June.\n|-\n|1944-04-27\n| ZF Friedrichshafen\n|  A night attack by 322 heavy bombers damaged several factories and destroyed the factory producing tank gearboxes. 1,234 tons of bombs were dropped causing (an estimated) 67 percent of the town's built-up area to be destroyed.\n|-\n| 20 July 1944\n| Zeppelin Works\n|  The 485 BG bombed Luftschiffbau Zeppelin. V-2 production planned for Zeppelin had already been moved to the Mittelwerk after the 1943 British bombing raid on the Peenemünde Army Research Center.\n|-\n| 28 July 1944\n|\n|  The 464 BG bombed the Manzell aircraft works.\n|-\n| 3 August 1944\n| Oberraderach & ZF Friedrichshafen\n|  Oberraderach (primary target) and the Zahnradfabrik secondary target were bombed. As early as 20 September 1942 Albert Speer had warned Hitler of the critical importance of Friedrichshafen tank plants and Schweinfurt ball-bearing plants.\n|-\n| 16 August 1944\n| Oberraderach\n|  The 485 BG bombed the Ober chemical works.\n|-\n| 25 February 1945\n| Maybach tank factory\n|  Mission 847: 377 B-17s are sent to hit the Maybach tank factory at Friedrichshafen (63) using Gee-H. Maybach Motorenbau (Friedrichshafen) and Norddeutsche Motorenbau (Berlin) produced nearly all tank engines.\n|-\n|}\nReferences\n;Notes\n;Bibliography\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080513143823/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/air04.html Operation Bellicose map]\n* [http://www.stollen-ueberlingen.de/inrund/fn.htm&rurl=translate.google.com&usg=ALkJrhhdqLzTE44eRGPVcV4me_nRYbEQcg ZF Friedrichshafen damage]"
