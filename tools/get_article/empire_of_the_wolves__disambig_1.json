At the same time, a duo of policemen, the unorthodox Schiffer (Jean Reno) and the cautious officer Nerteaux (Jocelyn Quivrin), work to unravel the mystery surrounding the murders. The plot thickens when Anna discovers that she has been subjected to intensive reconstructive surgery, which concealed her Turkish heritage. A series of events escalates into a confrontation with the Turkish mafia and the death of Anna's would-be assassin.\nCast\n* Jean Reno\tas Jean-Louis Schiffer\n* Arly Jover as Anna Heymes\n* Jocelyn Quivrin as Paul Nerteaux\n* Laura Morante as Mathilde Urano\n* Étienne Chicot as Olivier Amien\n* Philippe Bas as Laurent\n* David Kammenos as Azer\n* Didier Sauvegrain as Dr. Ackerman\n* Patrick Floersheim as Charlier\n* Albert Dray as the lieutenant\n* Vernon Dobtcheff as Kudseyi\n* Élodie Navarre as \"fliquette\"\n* Philippe du Janerand as \"légiste\"\n* Corentin Koskas as \"l'interne\"\n* Jean-Pierre Martins as Professeur Ravi\n* Jean-Marc Huber as Gurdilek\n* Donatienne Dupont as Clothilde\n* Jean-Michel Tinivelli\tas Caraccili\n* Sandra Moreno as Marie-Sophie\n* Laurence Gormezano as Chantal\n* Vincent Grass as Marius\n* Guillaume Lamant-Deboudt as Lacroux\n* Emmanuelle Escourrou as Gozar\n* Akim Colour as \"l'ouvrier\"\n* Gérard Touratier as Gruss\n* Aurélie Meriel as \"la secrétaire\"\n* Emre Kinay as \"le policier\"\n* Arnaud Duléry\tas \"un flic médico-légal\"\n* Jacques Curry as Roman\nRelease\nThe film premiered on 20 April 2005 in France and was on 30 July 2005 part of the Fantasy Film Fest in München.\nSoundtrack\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
