Released on March 15, 2011, on 429 Records, it contains covers of the 1946 Leon René standard \"I Sold My Heart to the Junkman,\" and \"Funky But Chic,\" originally from David Johansen's 1978 self titled album.\nThe title is a reference to actress Ginger Rogers. In a 1982 Frank and Ernest cartoon by Bob Thaves,([http://www.reelclassics.com/Actresses/Ginger/ginger-article2.htm image]) a woman is telling Frank and Ernest \"Sure (Fred Astaire) was great, but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, ...backwards and in high heels.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nDancing Backward in High Heels was produced by Jason Hill, who also replaced Sami Yaffa as Dolls bassist on this album. Also joining Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain -  the only members still living at the time of either the New York Dolls' \"classic\" 1972-1975 line up which recorded their two albums on Mercury Records or the two earlier line ups - were drummer Brian Delaney, who has been with the Dolls since their 2004 reunion, and former Blondie guitarist Frank Infante.\nNeither Sylvain nor Johansen released any further albums, solo or in any bands, before their respective deaths in 2021 and 2025, both from cancer. As such this is the last album ever recorded by any members of the \"classic\" or earlier line ups.\n;New York Dolls\n*David Johansen – lead vocals, harmonica\n*Sylvain Sylvain – guitar, vocals\n*Frank Infante – guitar\n*Jason Hill – bass, vocals\n*Brian Delaney – drums\nReferences"
