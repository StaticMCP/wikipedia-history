Hollywood Records released the album on May 6, 2016.\nBackground\nIn August 2014, directors Anthony and Joe Russo announced that Jackman, who wrote the score for Captain America: The Winter Soldier, would return to write the score for Civil War. Jackman noted that the industrial elements of the track \"The Winter Soldier\" from the soundtrack to The Winter Soldier was a good indication of what the soundtrack to Civil War would sound like, though he cautioned it was \"just a jumping off point since the Russos are looking for something new — similar with a twist.\"  However, Jackman noted that the score for Civil War is more symphonic and orchestral than Winter Soldier.\nTrack listing\nAll music composed by Henry Jackman.\nAdditional music\nOne additional song, \"Left Hand Free\" by alt-J, is featured in the movie, but was not included on the soundtrack album. It is played when Peter Parker / Spider-Man is first introduced in the film, and during the end credit sequence.\nThe theme song for the Japanese release of the film is a rerecorded version of \"Itsuka Kitto\" by EXILE ATSUSHI.\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Weekly chart performance for Captain America: Civil War (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n! scope=\"col\" |Chart (2016)\n! scope=\"col\" |Peak\nposition\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |UK Album Downloads (OCC)\n|67\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |UK Soundtrack Albums (OCC)\n|11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | US Billboard 200\n|168\n|}\nReferences\n}}"
