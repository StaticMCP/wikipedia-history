Hilton reported in a video on his blog that he was 'clubbed' in the eye by the said manager. will.i.am also later tweeted, defending the group's position in this matter. According to will.i.am, Perez was being provocative in his blog regarding Black Eyed Peas' member Fergie, as well as their latest album release, The E.N.D. An altercation ensued between Hilton and will.i.am, at which point Molina approached Hilton from behind and 'clubbed' him in the right eye, leaving a visible bump as seen in the video he posted during the following morning.
