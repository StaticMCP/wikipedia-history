In 2014, the school celebrated the 75th anniversary of Broadway Campus and the 50th anniversary of the Foxland Campus.\nPreviously a community school administered by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, in February 2016 The Kingsway School converted to academy status. The school is now sponsored by the Education Learning Trust.\nCharitable activity\nThe school has raised over £500,000 for charities including their sister school in Kenya.\nThis has been done through a sponsored walk every other year, an annual Christmas fair along with several other charity events. Staff from both schools often visit the other to share experiences and knowledge as well as support each other in the teaching of future generations.\nNotable former pupils\n*Simon Gregson, actor\n*Nicholas Cochrane, actor\n*Oliver Cookson, entrepreneur\n*Ryan Thomas, actor\n*Adam Thomas, actor\n*Hallam Hope, footballer\n*George Evans, footballer\nReferences"
