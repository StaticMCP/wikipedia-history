His agricultural experiences not being satisfactory, he removed to Hiawatha, the county seat, opened a law office, and continued in the practice of his profession until 1865.\nKingman was a member of the Wyandotte convention of 1859, which framed the Kansas state constitution.\nHe was elected June 7, 1859 to fill the delegate position for Brown County, Kansas gaining 93 of the 114 total votes.\nThe convention started a few weeks later on July 5 and Kingman was elected as the temporary president.\nThe same year on October 2 he was nominated by the Republican state convention in Lawrence for the position of justice of the first Kansas supreme court.\nShortly after on November 8 he resoundingly lost to Benjamin F. Killey to be the state probate judge.\nHe was then duly elected a  justice of the Supreme Court of Kansas along with Lawrence Dudley Bailey and with Thomas Ewing Jr. as the chief justice.\nHe took up his seat upon the admission of the state into the Union in 1861, and held the position of  justice for four years.\nIn 1864 he ran for re-election as justice but was defeated, by Jacob Safford a local district judge at the time.\nTwo years later he was elected Chief Justice and took his seat January 14, 1867, for the term of six years. In 1872 he was re-elected for a full term, but at the end of 1876 he resigned his office by reason of his failing health and retired from active public life, residing at Topeka.\nHe was the president of both the Kansas State Historical society and the Kansas State Bar association.\nIn 1873 several people and organizations put Judge Kingman's name forward for senatorship, and although he was persuaded to run he lost to James M. Harvey.\nBoth Kingman County, Kansas and Kingman city were named in his honor during his lifetime, in 1872 and 1874 respectively.\nDeath\nIn 1844, Kingman married Matilda Willets of Terre Haute, with whom he had two daughters Lucy and Lillian, all three of whom survived him.\nHe died suddenly September 9, 1904 aged 86 sitting in a chair at his home in Topeka. Although his health had been in decline for several years he was suffering no particular illnesses at the time so his death was deemed to be from old age. He had survived two of the chief justices that followed him, Albert H. Horton and David Martin as well as almost all of the other fifty-one delegates to the Wyandotte convention. He was buried at Topeka Cemetery.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/210326 Portrait of Kingman (between 1890 and 1900)]\n* [https://www.kshs.org/p/diary-of-samuel-a-kingman-at-indian-treaty-in-1865/12562 Diary of Samuel A.
