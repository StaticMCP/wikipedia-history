It is the longest-running video game award ceremony, launched in 1983, and the second-oldest video game award ceremony after the Arcade Awards, launched in 1981.\nThe awards were initially focused on computer games, but were extended to include console games. The ceremony is not directly related to the golden joystick prize given away to successful contestants on GamesMaster, a British television show, but both properties belong to Future plc.\nIn 2021, the Golden Joystick Awards celebrated 50 Years Of Games by asking the public to vote for the Ultimate Game Of All Time, which was won by the 2011 game Dark Souls''. The PC also received the Best Gaming Hardware of All Time Award, which was accepted by Valve president Gabe Newell.\nWinners\n1983\nAwards were presented by DJ Dave Lee Travis at a ceremony in London's Berkeley Square.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
