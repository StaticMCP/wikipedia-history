They played in the NSW Ron Massey Cup competition and in Sydney's A-Grade competitions.\n2017\nIn The 2017 Ron Massey Cup season, Auburn qualified for their first grand final in the competition.  On 24 September, Auburn played against Wentworthville in the final and lost the match 38-4.\n2018\nOn 14 February 2018, it was revealed that Auburn Warriors Rugby League Club had been forced to fold due to a failed sponsorship deal involving former deputy Auburn mayor Salim Mehajer.  Mehajer had promised the club a payment of $100,000 but the amount was never paid.  Auburn Warriors president Fedi Sleiman said \"He didn't pay us. He didn't pay a cent, \"We don't have a leagues club, we don't have the backing of anyone else, When he comes up with nothing, there's nothing we can do. We can't keep going\".  As a result The NSWRL confirmed the Warriors wouldn't be taking part in the Ron Massey Cup for 2018.  Sleiman hopes a white knight sponsor would emerge to enable the Warriors to return to the Ron Massey Cup in 2019.\nHonours\n*Ron Massey Cup\n** Runners Up (1) – 2017\nNotable players\n*Matt Utai (2002-13 Canterbury Bulldogs & Wests Tigers)\n*Heka Nanai (2007-10 Canterbury Bulldogs)\n*Khalid Deeb (2009 Sydney Roosters)\n*Omar Slaimankhel (2015-2016 Sydney Roosters)\nSee also\n*List of rugby league clubs in Australia\nReferences\nExternal links\n*0-2149-96567-0-0&aMYSPORTRELS}}"
