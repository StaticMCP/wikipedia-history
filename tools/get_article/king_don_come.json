Chiagoziem of Filterfree.ng highlighted D'banj's pioneering role in the global recognition of Afropop, comparing him to John the Baptist for paving the way for stars like Wizkid, Davido, and Mr Eazi. While praising his comeback with the hit single \"Emergency\", the review pointed out that King Don Come carried an air of self-importance, with tracks like \"Focus\" and \"It's Not a Lie\" reflecting his need to assert his standing in the industry. The production by Cheekychizzy was lauded for its cohesion, though D'banj’s insecurity was noted as a key thematic element throughout the project. Umar Hassan of YNaija emphasized D'banj’s ability to thrive off his brand rather than his music, pointing out that despite an underwhelming catalog in recent years, his star power remains potent. The review praised tracks like \"It’s Not a Lie\" for D'banj’s effort to improve his craft, but criticized songs like \"Be With You\" for highlighting his vocal limitations. \"El Chapo\", featuring Gucci Mane and Wande Coal, was deemed a standout track, though \"Egweji\", featuring Phyno, was seen as a failed effort. Debola Abimbolu of the Native recognized D'banj’s long-standing reputation as an entertainer who defies categorization. The review appreciated his versatility and praised the album’s balance between nostalgia and reinvention. Tracks like \"It’s Not A Lie\" and \"Ntswempu\" were celebrated for blending past success with modern production, while songs like \"El Chapo\" were acknowledged for pushing boundaries, even if the violent narrative seemed far-fetched. The album was commended for its cohesion despite having several pre-released tracks, with the review concluding that King Don Come succeeded in demonstrating D'banj’s ability to entertain, even after years in the industry.\nTrack listing\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 3:12\n| title2          = Be With You\n| note2           =\n| writer2         = Oyebanjo\n| extra2          =\n| length2         = 3:34\n| title3          = Te Necesito\n| note3           =\n| writer3         = Oyebanjo\n| extra3          =\n| length3         = 3:24\n| title4          = El Chapo\n| note4           = featuring Gucci Mane and Wande Coal\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = Maleek Berry\n| length4         = 4:46\n| title5          = As I De Go\n| note5           =\n| writer5         = Oyebanjo\n| extra5          =\n| length5         = 4:49\n| title6          = Turn Down for What\n| note6           =\n| writer6         = Oyebanjo\n| extra6          =\n| length6         = 3:42\n| title7          = Egweji\n| note7           = featuring Phyno\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          = Cheekychizzy\n| length7         = 3:55\n| title8          = That's What I Mean\n| note8           = featuring Kayswitch\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          =\n| length8         = 4:22\n| title9          = Ntswempu\n| note9           = featuring Bucie and Busiswa\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          =\n| length9         = 3:52\n| title10          = Emergency\n| note10           =\n| writer10         = Oyebanjo\n| extra10          = Ploops\n| length10         = 3:26\n| title11          = Oliver Twist\n| note11           =\n| writer11         =\n| extra11          = Don Jazzy\n| length11         = 3:57\n| title12          = Shoulda\n| note12           =\n| writer12         = Oyebanjo\n| extra12          =\n| length12         = 3:31\n}}\nPersonnel\n* Oladapo \"D'banj\" Oyebanjo – main artist, writer\n* Busiswe \"Bucie\" Nqwiliso – featured artist, writer\n* Busiswa Gqulu – featured artist, writer\n* Oluwatobi \"Wande Coal\" Ojosipe – featured artist, writer\n* Radric \"Gucci Mane\" Davis – featured artist, writer\n* Harrison \"Harrysong\" Okiri - featured artist, writer\n* Chibuzor \"Phyno\" Azubuike – featured artist, writer\n* Kehinde \"Kayswitch\" Oyebanjo – featured artist, writer\n* Michael \"Don Jazzy\" Ajereh - producer, writer\n* Chisom \"Cheekychizzy\" Ifeachor - producer\n* Henry \"Dr. Amir\" Tonwe-Adebola - producer\n* Oluwaseyi \"Shizzi\" Akerele - producer\n* Ploops - producer\n* Tefa - producer\n* Otaniyen-Uwa \"Killertunes\" Daniel - producer\n* Maleek \"Berry\" Shoyebi - producer\n* Sesan Ogunro - video director\n* Eif Rivera - video director\n* Patrick Elis – video director\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+Release history and formats for King Don Come\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Nigeria\n| 25 August 2017\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
