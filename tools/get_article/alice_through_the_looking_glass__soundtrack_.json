It is the sequel/prequel to the Alice in Wonderland (2010), with Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter amongst others reprise the roles for the film, alongside Rhys Ifans and Sacha Baron Cohen.\nBackground\nIn August 2014, it was announced that Danny Elfman, who previously scored for Alice in Wonderland would return for the sequel. Elfman prioritized working on the score, which resulted in him not working with his frequent collaborator Tim Burton on ''Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016) due to scheduling conflicts.\nRelease\nPink recorded the original song \"Just Like Fire\" which was released on April 15, 2016. The soundtrack was released through Walt Disney Records on May 27, 2016.\nTrack listing\nReception\nFilmtracks'' wrote \"Ultimately, the stunning quality of the new \"Alice\" suite, the rousing action cues, \"Saving the Ship\" and \"Time is Up,\" and the general, underlying strength of the referenced material all point to a five-star rating. It's rare that you receive such a competent sequel to an original classic.\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote \"Danny Elfman's score settles into a mood of overawed grandiosity\". Matt Zoller-Seitz of RogerEbert.com wrote \"Danny Elfman's score ladles Magic and Wonder over every scene, to convince you that what's onscreen doesn't look like a Shrek film as painted by an amateur who idolizes Leroy Neiman.\" Rashid Irani of Hindustan Times wrote \"Burton's regular collaborator Danny Elfman provides a wondrous background score.\"\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from liner notes:\n* Music composer and producer – Danny Elfman\n* Additional music – Chris Bacon, TJ Lindgren\n* Music programming – Peter Bateman\n* Midi supervision and preparation – Marc Mann\n* Recording – Peter Gobbin\n* Recording assistance – Matt Jones, Stefano Civetta\n* Digital recordist – Noah Snyder, Toby Hulbert\n* Mixing – Dennis S.
