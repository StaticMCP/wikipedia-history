For the first time he refused, probably because of a lack of confidence in his Angevin crews, and d'Oria ravaged some offshore islands. This allowed 12 Apulian galleys to arrive from the south and seven Genoese galleys to arrive also, and join Lauria's fleet, making 59 galleys. Now Lauria emerged and found the Sicilians near Zannone Island to the west. After d'Oria dismissed a suggestion to retreat, he tried a quick attack on Lauria's flag-galley and the banner-carrying galleys, his own galley running alongside Lauria's, \"head to toe\", and Lauria's crew suffered even though his galley couldn't be boarded. One Sicilian galley fled after capturing one of Lauria's galleys, and it was followed by six more. Five Genoese Ghibelline galleys held back, awaiting fortune, and 18-29 (two sources give 28, but this adds up to too many) Sicilian galleys were captured, d'Oria's being the last to surrender (when Lauria threatened to burn it).\nShips involved\nAragonese and Angevin\n*40 Angevin (Regicolae) galleys\n*12 Apulian galleys\n*7 Genoese (Grimaldi) galleys\nSicilian\n*32 galleys - about 26 captured\nReferences"
