He later represented Herefordshire at bowls and won the National Triples title in 1950.\nPersonal life\nPrior to his service in the First World War, Edwards worked as a motor driver. In July 1915, nearly a year after the outbreak of the First World War, Edwards enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps as an air mechanic 1st class. He was later promoted to the rank of leading aircraftman. After retiring from football, Edwards became a publican in Hereford and along with his brother, he served as a director of Hereford United.\nCareer statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Club\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! colspan=\"3\" |League\n! colspan=\"2\" |FA Cup\n! colspan=\"2\" |Other\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n|-\n!Division\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n!Apps\n!Goals\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |West Ham United\n|1922–23\n|Second Division\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|1923–24\n| rowspan=\"3\" |First Division\n|25\n|3\n|2\n|0\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|27\n|3\n|-\n|1924–25\n|7\n|0\n|0\n|0\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|7\n|0\n|-\n|1925–26\n|4\n|0\n|0\n|0\n| colspan=\"2\" |—\n|4\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!37\n!3\n!2\n!0\n! colspan=\"2\" |—\n!39\n!3\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Hereford United\n|1927–28\n|Birmingham Combination\n|15\n|12\n|0\n|0\n|2\n|1\n|17\n|13\n|-\n|1928–29\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Birmingham & District League\n|16\n|10\n|2\n|1\n|2\n|1\n|20\n|12\n|-\n|1929–30\n|6\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|7\n|2\n|-\n|1930–31\n|5\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|9\n|0\n|-\n|1931–32\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Total\n!43\n!24\n!6\n!1\n!5\n!2\n!54\n!27\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |Career Total\n!80\n!27\n!8\n!1\n!5\n!2\n!93\n!30\n|}\nReferences"
