It is a shrub with many branches, pinnate leaves and one or two pink, four-petalled flowers in the leaf axils. It is only known from the Warrumbungles and nearby districts.\nDescription\nBoronia warrumbunglensis is a shrub that grows to a height of  and has many hairy branches. The leaves are pinnate with three, five or seven leaflets and are  long and  wide in outline with a petiole  long. The leaflets are elliptic to lance-shaped,  long and  wide. The flowers are pale to bright pink and are arranged singly or pairs in leaf axils, each flower on a pedicel  long. The four sepals are triangular to egg-shaped,  long,  wide and densely hairy on the lower side. The four petals are  long and  but increase in size as the fruit develops. The eight stamens alternate in length with those near the sepals longer than those near the petals. Flowering occurs from August to October and the fruit is a hairy capsule  long and  wide.\nTaxonomy and naming\nBoronia warrumbunglensis was first formally described in 1990 by Peter H.

The specific epithet (warrumbunglensis) refers to the restricted occurrence of this boronia, the ending -ensis is a Latin suffix meaning \"denoting place, locality, country\".\nDistribution and habitat\nThis boronia grows in forest on sandstone in the Warrumbungles - Coonabarabran district.\nReferences"
