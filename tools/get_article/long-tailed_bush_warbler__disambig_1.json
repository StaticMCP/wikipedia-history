It was formerly included in the \"Old World warbler\" assemblage. It is found only in the Philippines on the islands of Mindanao and Luzon.\nDescription and taxonomy\nEBird describes the bird as \"A fairly small, long-tailed bird of montane forest undergrowth. Dark brown above with an orange-brown belly, a gray chest, a white throat and eyebrow, mainly in front of the eye, and a long graduated tail which it often holds cocked. Very skulking. Similar to Benguet and Philippine Bush-Warblers, but has a longer tail and deeper brown belly. Song is a sharp \"tik!\" followed by a ringing high-pitched buzz.\"\nThree subspecies are recognised:\n* L. c. caudata– all of Mindanao except the Zamboanga Peninsula; Longer tail\n* L. c. malindangensis  – west Mindanao in the Zamboanga Peninsula - Darker sides on face and a whiter throat\n* L. c. unicolor  –  Luzon; Dark upperparts, rufous belly and a shorter tail\nThe birds in Luzon and Mindanao have vastly different calls and the potential of there is potential for these birds to be split into their own distinctive species.\nEcology and behavior\nThese birds feed on small insects. Forages alone or singly. Breeding season is unkwnon but young birds seen from February to September.\nHabitat and conservation status\nIt occupies montane mossy forest above 700 meters above sea level.\nIUCN has assessed this bird as Least-concern as a lot of its montane habitat is difficult to access and it is reasonably common within its wide range. However, it is still declining due to habitat loss through deforestation, mining,  land conversion and slash-and-burn.\nReferences\n* BirdLife International 2004.
