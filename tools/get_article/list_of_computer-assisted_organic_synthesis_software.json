CAOS aims to identify a series of chemical reactions which, from a starting compound, can produce a desired molecule.  CAOS algorithms typically use two databases: a first one of known chemical reactions and a second one of known starting materials (i.e., typically molecules available commercially). Desirable synthetic plans cost less, have high yield, and avoid using hazardous reactions and intermediates. Typically cast as a planning problem, significant progress has been made in CAOS.\nCAOS programs\n* [https://molecule.one/ M1 RetroScore powered by CAS] – demo available, based on ML models trained on CAS SciFinder data [https://www.cas.org/press-releases/cas-and-moleculeone-announce-strategic-collaboration-accelerate-drug]\n* Syntheseus – [https://github.com/microsoft/syntheseus]\n* ChemAIRS – demo available, developed by [https://chemical.ai/ Chemical.AI] as a commercial suite of software. In addition to retrosynthesis, the tool has some unique functions such as SA (synthetic accessibility) score and process chemistry.\n* Spaya – [https://iktos.ai/spaya/ Retrosynthesis planning tool freely accessible provided by Iktos]\n* [https://rxn.res.ibm.com/ IBM RXN] – A freely accessible, cloud-based service developed by IBM that uses AI models to predict chemical reactions and generate retrosynthesis pathways.  The tool suite also provides additional capabilities, such as robotic integration and model finetuning, for paid subscribers.
