At first, it was a poll of coaches conducted via telephone, where coaches identified top teams and a list of the Top 20 teams was produced. The contributors continued to be coaches until 1994, when the AP took over administration of the poll from Greenberg, and switched to a panel of writers. Three Texas teams were in the very first ranking in 1976: Wayland Baptist, Stephen F. Austin and Baylor. On January 23, 2023, for the first time in 47 years, no teams from Texas were in the top 25, ending an 835-week run with at least one Texas team in the rankings.\n|Week2Date = Nov 14\n|Week3Date = Nov

Coaches Poll is the second-oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first-place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\n|Week2Date = Nov 15\n|Week3Date = Nov 22\n|Week4Date = Nov 29\n|Week5Date = Dec 6\n|Week6Date = Dec 13\n|Week7Date = Dec 20\n|Week8Date = Dec
