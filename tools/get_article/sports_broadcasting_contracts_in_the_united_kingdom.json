Many of the sporting events are listed online or in different kind of apps. These apps are mainly designed for sport fans who want to have an easy way to find when a certain game or match is played, as well as when a race starts or which channel is broadcasting the Olympic Games etc.\nCertain sporting events are protected by the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events and must be broadcast live and free-to-air on terrestrial television in the UK.\nPresently, free-to-air means a TV channel which is free and covers 98% of the population. According to Ofcom regulations, qualifying free-to-air channels are BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.\nEurosport closed in the UK and Ireland on 28 February 2025, with Eurosport content moving to the TNT Sports channels and platforms.\nAssociation football/soccer\nTelevision\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\"\n|+Broadcasting contracts for football (Television)\n!Event\n!Broadcaster\n!Broadcast details\n|-\n|FIFA World Cup Finals\n|BBC/ITV\n|All matches live on BBC & ITV with final live on both broadcasters until 2030\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" | FIFA World Cup Qualifiers\n| ITV/S4C/BBC\n| rowspan=\"2\" |All UEFA matches live\n* All England matches live on ITV.\n* All Wales matches live on S4C and BBC.\n* All Scotland and Northern Ireland matches live on BBC.\nother matches live on Prime Video\n|-\n|Amazon Prime\n|-\n|FIFA+\n|All CAF matches live\n|-\n|Premier Sports\n|Argentina, Brazil, and Ecuador home matches only.\n|-\n|Fanatiz\n|All CONMEBOL matches live (exc.
