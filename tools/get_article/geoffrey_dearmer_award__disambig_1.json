By establishing an endowment fund, the Dearmer family has enabled the Poetry Society to award an annual prize to the best poem in The Poetry Review by a poet who had not, before the issue in which their work appeared, published a collection. The winner of the prize is announced in the summer issue of The Poetry Review.\nAwards\n*2013 Mir Mahfuz Ali\n*2012 Kayo Chingonyi\n*2011 Denise Saul\n*2010 Kim Moore\n*2009 Maitreyabandhu\n*2008 Kearan Williams\n*2007 Neetha Kunaratnam\n*2006 Tamara Fulcher\n*2005 Andrew Bailey\n*2004 Lucie McKee\n*2003 Rebecca O'Connor\n*2002 David Gravender\n*2001 Michael Murphy\n*2000 Anna Wigley\n*1999 Sarah Wardle\n*1998 Paul Farley\nAbout the Poetry Society\nThe Poetry Society's mission is to advance the study, use and enjoyment of poetry.\nThe Poetry Society was founded in 1909 to 'promote \"a more general recognition and appreciation of poetry\".
