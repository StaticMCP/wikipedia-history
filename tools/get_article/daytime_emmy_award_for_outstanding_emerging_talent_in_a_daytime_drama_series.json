It was first awarded at the 52nd Daytime Emmy Awards to a performer who has delivered an outstanding performance as an \"emerging talent\" while working within the daytime drama industry.\nThe Emerging Talent award has been presented one time, to one performer. The first and most recent winner is Lisa Yamada for her role as Luna Nozawa on The Bold and the Beautiful.\nNomination process\nTo be considered for this category, performers must meet all of the following criteria:\n* Be on their first Daytime contract with no previous Daytime Emmy acting nominations.\n* Have been part of their Daytime Drama for two years or less at the time of consideration.\n* Appear in a speaking role with at least one multi-episode story arc.\n* Anyone who wins the category once will be ineligible to win it again.\nThis category differs from the retired Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series—and its earlier gender-specific counterparts—which imposed an age restriction on nominees. By contrast, the new category has no age restriction, shifting the focus away from a performer’s age and instead highlighting their status as a newcomer to daytime television.\nWinners and nominees\nListed below are the winners of the award for each year, as well as the other nominees.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Table key\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FAEB86; height:20px; width:20px\"|\n| Indicates the winner\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Emerging Talent in a Daytime Drama Series\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Actor\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Program\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\"| Role\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:7%;\"| Network\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center\"| 2025 (52nd)\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86\"\n| Lisa Yamada\n|The Bold and the Beautiful\n| Luna Nozawa\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| CBS\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n| Olivia d'Abo\n| The Bay\n| Fifi Garrett\n| Popstar!
