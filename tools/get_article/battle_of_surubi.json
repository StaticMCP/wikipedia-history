On the morning of the 23rd of September, the Brazilian vanguard under general Andrade Neves met two Paraguayan detachments at a bridge over the Surubí stream and beat them.\nThe engagement\nThe Brazilian vanguard, after crossing the bridge over the Surubí stream, was surprised by a large Paraguayan force, partially hidden by thick brush on the river's shore. The attackers were initially forced to retreat over the bridge, and only after a second attack by two squadrons of the 6th Cavalry Regiment was the Paraguayan position taken.\nOne of the Brazilian units, the 2nd Division's 5th Infantry Battalion, fled the action in disorder, and was dissolved.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
