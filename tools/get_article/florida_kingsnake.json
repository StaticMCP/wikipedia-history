      "text": "# Florida kingsnake\n\nLampropeltis getula floridana or the Florida kingsnake  is a snake subspecies native to southern Florida. On average, they grow between 3.5–5&nbsp;ft but 6&nbsp;ft individuals have been recorded.\nCare\nLike other kingsnakes, this species is relatively easy to care for. They can be housed in a 20–40 gallon aquarium with aspen shavings for them to burrow in. (Pine shavings are toxic to reptiles.) The temperature should be around 84F-90F degrees during the day, and nighttime temperatures should range between 68F and 75F degrees. Like other snakes commonly kept in captivity, they should feed on pinkie or fuzzie mice as babies, then gradually increase in size until the snake reaches adulthood, which by then they should be eating large mice.\nGallery\nFile:Lampropeltis getula floridana, Adult-South Florida.jpg|Adult male from South Florida\nFile:Florida Kingsnake, Lampropeltis getula floridana.jpg\nReferences\nhttps://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/herpetology/fl-snakes/list/lampropeltis-getula-floridana/"
