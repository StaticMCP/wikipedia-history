These included Bessarabia, Ukraine and Belarus, as well as the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania which had been part of the Russian Empire and which, after a period of interwar independence, had been incorporated into the Soviet Union following their occupation in 1940. He also hoped to acquire Finland, which was at war with the Soviet Union as part of the Axis, and which had been an autonomous grand duchy of the Russian Empire.  In exchange, Britain would receive land and permission to have naval bases and maritime passage through the English Channel, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Britain made no commitments and Stalin's ideas did not form part of the agreement.\nAgreement\nA military alliance was to last until the end of World War II, and a political alliance was to last 20 years. The treaty was signed in London on 26 May 1942 by British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov.\nThe treaty was bilateral. Absent from the discussions were the other Allies, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, British India and the Republic of China. Also not represented were the Allies that had governments-in-exile, such as Czechoslovakia and France, whose countries were being occupied by Germany, despite the Soviets' initial aim being to direct those countries' postwar structure.\nSignificance\nThe treaty represented a transition for Britain, which sacrificed some of its superpower status because of its weakened military state but still exerted diplomatic power during the negotiations.\nDespite the Allies winning the war against the Axis powers, and the successful creation of the United Nations, the alliance of the Soviet Union with the United Kingdom and the United States ultimately broke down and evolved into the Cold War, which took place over the following half-century.\nSee also\n*Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran\n*Anglo-Soviet relations\n*Declaration by United Nations\n*Diplomatic history of World War II\n*History of the United Nations\n*Percentages agreement\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/brsov42.asp Text of the treaty]\n* [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/molotov2.html Molotov's Report on Ratification of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty]\n* George Ciorănescu, [http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-3-67.shtml \"The Problem of Bessarabia and Northern Bucovina During World War II\"], Radio Free Europe, 12 May 1981."
