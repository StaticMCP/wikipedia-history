A few months later, in March 1964, he founded the Democratic Union for the New Republic. The party, which was inspired by Charles de Gaulle's party in France, included several post-fascists such as Enzo Dantini and Antonio Aliotti, from the National Vanguard, and future member of Christian Democracy Vittorio Sbardella. New Republic thus had a right-wing connotation. Its main goals were to transform Italy into a presidential republic and to introduce a plurality voting system.\nConnected to New Republic was the university movement Primula Goliardica, later absorbed by Lotta di Popolo. The party's journals were Folla (since 1964) and  Nuova Repubblica (since 1966). In 1980 Pacciardi and his followers, whose electoral results had been dismal, returned to the PRI.\nElection results\nChamber of Deputies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Election\n!Leaders\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n|-\n|1968\n|Randolfo Pacciardi\n|63,402\n|0.20\n|\n|}\nReferences"
