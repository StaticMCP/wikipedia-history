The inaugural session of the dialogue was held in November 2014 in London during Foreign Minister Tamar Beruchashvili's visit in the UK. The meetings are held once a year, in London and Tbilisi alternatively.\nThe dialogue bears the name of Sir Oliver Wardrop, British diplomat who served as a first chief commissioner of the UK to Transcaucasia in 1919–20. He founded Kartvelian studies at Oxford University, was fluent in the Georgian language and published several books about the country.\nReferences"
