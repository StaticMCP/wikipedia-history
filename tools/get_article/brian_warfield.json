Brian introduces many of the songs at the Wolfe Tones live concerts and is a keen historian.\nPersonal life\nBrian Warfield was born on 2 April 1946 in the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin and lived in the Dublin suburb Inchicore. He is one of the founding members and lead singers of the Irish Folk band, The Wolfe Tones. Warfield was the second born in a family of 4 boys. Today, Brian is married to his wife \tJune Warfield (née Radburn) and resides in Blessington, County Wicklow.\nAs of July 2017, Brian has not communicated with his brother Derek Warfield since he left The Wolfe Tones in 2001, except when Joe Duffy unsuccessfully tried to get them to resolve their differences on the radio show Liveline in 2009.\nIn 2019, Warfield was diagnosed with  Parkinson's disease, which was later shown to in fact be essential tremor. Despite this, he was still able to perform with the Wolfe Tones until their final concert in June of 2025.\nCareer\nWarfield has written many songs for the Wolfe Tones, notably \"The Helicopter Song\", \"Irish Eyes\" and \"My Heart is in Ireland\". \"Let the People Sing\", was written in dedication to those Irish ballad singers who were banned from singing Irish songs. It has been performed by many Celtic and Irish Rebel bands, including Celtic band Charlie and the Bhoys. The song is popular among fans of Celtic F.C. and a version \"Let The People Sing\" performed by The Malleys, omitting the second verse, is played at Celtic Park on match days.\nWarfield's affiliation with Celtic Football Club led to him being asked to write a song for the Club to celebrate its 100th anniversary. As a result, Celtic Symphony was composed; a song popular with many Celtic fans, but controversial due to its chorus.  The chorus which features the words \"ooh, ah, up the RA\" was often seen as a pro-IRA stance, but according to its writer, Brian Warfield, these words were included in the balladic tradition of writing what is observed at the time. He’s also a keen supporter of Everton Football Club he’s mentioned many times.\nAs a songwriter, Warfield's writing is typically a social commentary on Ireland and its issues. For the 2012 album, Child of Destiny, Warfield composed 'Swing A Banker', which is a comical ballad referring to Irish bankers as chickens. The music video was recorded outside the Treasury Building in Dublin. He is currently working on a musical about the famine. He continued to tour with The Wolfe Tones with Tommy Byrne and Noel Nagle until their final show in June of 2025.\nDespite the end of touring, Warfield remains an active artist. At the start of 2025, he announced a new musical he has written called \"Celtic Exodus\".\nBibliography\n*\nReferences"
