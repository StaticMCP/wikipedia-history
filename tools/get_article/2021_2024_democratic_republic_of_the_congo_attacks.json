In October 2021, the Allied Democratic Forces launched a bombing campaign in Uganda, leading to the intervention of the Ugandan military a year later, which has pursued a policy of airstrikes against ADF targets. In contrast, the Islamic State has reportedly lent support to the Allied Democratic Forces.\nThe government under Félix Tshisekedi has tried to combat the insurgency by declaring martial law, with mixed success.\nHumanitarian situation\nThe ongoing conflict in the country has led to thousands of deaths, millions displaced, food insecurity, and widespread human rights violations. UN convoys have been raided, leading to the murder of Italian ambassador Luca Attanasio, possibly by the FDLR. Many refugee camps for these displaced people have been raided by rebels, prompting condemnation from the United Nations.\nAccording to reporters, the ADF has used civilians as human shields, which is a war crime under international law.\nThe UN has reported that about 7.3 million people were internally displaced by the end of 2024. The ongoing humanitarian crisis leaves approximately 25.4 million people in need of humanitarian aid in the whole country (as of 2024).\nSummary counts of fatalities, internally displaced people and attacks by year\nDeaths of civilians per year:\nDevelopment of internally displaced people (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024):\nAvailable summary of attack type: In 2021, 898 terrorist attacks were registered in the country, and the Islamic State claimed responsibility for more than 300 of those attacks. In 2022, 1,063 to 1,198 people were killed, 714 to 839 were abducted, and at least 174 were injured by members of the Islamic State.\nFrom January to October 2021, 260 security incidents affecting humanitarian work were reported, resulting in seven humanitarian workers being killed, 26 injured, and 23 kidnapped. In 2022, 293 security incidents were recorded.\nList of attacks per year\n2021\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Date\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |Dead\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" |Injured\n!Involved\n!Location – Circumstances\n|-\n| 4 January\n| 22\n| unknown\n| ADF\n| North Kivu, Beni territory, Mwenda – 22 people were killed when the ADF attack the village of Mwenda with machetes and guns.\n|-\n| 5 January\n| 4\n| unknown\n| FPIC\n| Ituri Province, Baboa Bokoe chiefdom – Three civilians and one soldier were killed in a FPIC attack on three villages setting fire to multiple homes.\n|-\n| 10 January\n| 6 (+2)\n| 1\n| Mai-Mai\n| North Kivu, Nyamitwitwi, Rutshuru – Six park rangers were killed and one injured when Mai-Mai attacked their positions.\n|-\n| 12 January\n| 3 (+2)\n| unknown\n| ADF\n| Ituri Province, Bahatsha – ADF ambushed a company of FARDC soldiers in the village of Bahatsha killing three and losing two of their own.\n|-\n| 13 January\n| 15\n| unknown\n| ADF\n| Ituri Province, locality of Abembi – ADF attacked a village in the locality of Abembi killing 15 people.\n|-\n| 14 January\n| 46\n| unknown\n| ADF\n| Ituri Province, Irumu territory – 46 people were killed when ADF militants attacked a village in the Irumu territory.\n|-\n| 18 January\n| 1\n| 3\n| Armed men\n| North Kivu, chiefdom of Bwito – Four civilians were kidnapped and one beheaded in the chiefdom of Bwito when unidentified armed men demanding US$3,000 for their release.\n|-\n| 26 January\n| 0\n| 6\n| Anti-balaka rebels\n| Nord-Ubangi Province, Mogóró cell – Anti-balaka rebels from the Central African Republic crossed over into the DRC and kidnapped six fishermen along the Ubangi river.\n|-\n| 5 February\n| 12\n| unknown\n| ADF\n| North Kivu, Mabule – Twelve people were killed when ADF attacked the village of Mabule.\n|-\n| 7 February\n| 1\n| 3\n| Mai-Mai\n| North Kivu, Osso-Banyungu sector – Mai-Mai killed the official delegate of the governor of North Kivu, Mai-Mai also kidnapped a person at the scene.\n|-\n| 9 February\n| 10\n| unknown\n| ADF\n| Ituri Province, Kithovirwa – ADF killed ten people in Kithovirwa village with knives.\n|-\n| 10 February\n| 2\n| 1\n| Bandits\n| Ituri Province, Linji  – Two people were killed and another wounded when bandits attacked Linji village at 10 p.m. local time, stealing valuables.\n|-\n| 13 February\n| 1\n| unknown\n| FPIC\n| Ituri Province, Kabarole  – FPIC militiamen attacked the village of Kabarole at 3 p.m. local time killing a woman and stealing 60 cows.\n|-\n| 14 February\n| 5 (+6)\n| unknown\n| Bakata-Katanga\n| Haut-Katanga Province, Lubumbashi – Four police and one civilian were killed when the Bakata-Katanga militia attack Lubumbashi.
