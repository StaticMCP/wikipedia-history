It takes place at the operational level.\nDevelopment\nThe Operational Art of War was developed at TalonSoft and designed by Norm Koger, previously responsible for wargames such as Wargame Construction Set III: Age of Rifles.

That April, Koger called The Operational Art of War \"the game I've wanted to do for years.\"\nReception\n| CGW =\n| rev1 = CNET Gamecenter\n| rev1Score = 9/10\n| rev2 = PC Games\n| rev2Score= A−\n}}\nThe Operational Art of War was named the best computer wargame of 1998 by Computer Gaming World, PC Gamer US, Computer Games Strategy Plus and GameSpot. It received a nomination in this category from CNET Gamecenter, and one for \"Best Strategy Game of the Year\" from IGN, but lost the awards respectively to ''People's General and StarCraft. The editors of Computer Games wrote that The Operational Art of War \"balances detail against flexibility; in our minds, it does this better than most.\" Those of Computer Gaming World argued that it \"shows that there is still plenty of life left in serious wargames.\"\nSales\nTalonSoft struggled to distribute its games in 1998, according to Jim Rose. The Operational Art of War sold 12,789 copies in the United States that year, which accounted for $555,681 in revenue. Jason Ocampo of CNET Gamecenter'' reported, \"TalonSoft had been shut out of Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer. When TalonSoft's games did make it to a store, they were often outnumbered by dozens of copies of a competitor's product.\" The company sold itself to Take-Two Interactive in late December 1998; Rose argued publicly that the move would aid in TalonSoft's distribution efforts for future games.\nReviews\n*The Duelist #35\nLegacy\nIn 1998, PC Gamer US declared The Operational Art of War the 50th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \"nothing less than a masterpiece.\"\nSequels\nThe Operational Art of War spawned the Operational Art of War series.
