As part of the October 7 attacks that started the Gaza War, 251 additional people were kidnapped and taken hostage to the Gaza Strip, most of whom were Israeli citizens. A total of 168 hostages returned alive: eight were rescued, five released outside of any ceasefire framework, with the rest released during ceasefires in the Gaza War. During the January 2025 Gaza war ceasefire, five Thai nationals were released outside the ceasefire agreement.}}\nThe last living hostage was released on October 13, 2025 as part of the Gaza peace plan. , three bodies of hostages are still held in the Gaza Strip.\nIn addition to the hostages kidnapped to the Gaza Strip, there were two hostage standoff situations inside Israel as part of the October 7 attacks, with a third attempt at a standoff thwarted when the victims managed to escape to the roof where they were rescued. Both hostage situations were resolved in less than 24 hours. Of the 17 people who were held hostage inside Israel, only four survived.\nHostages held prior to the 7 October attacks\nFour hostages were held in the Gaza Strip prior to the October 7 attacks: two IDF soldiers killed during the 2014 Gaza War, whose bodies were taken by Hamas; and two Israeli civilians abducted in 2014 and 2015 after wandering into the Gaza Strip. Israel demanded their inclusion in a unified hostage deal, along with the hostages taken in the October 7 attacks. The two civilians were released during the January 2025 Gaza war ceasefire, the body of one of the soldiers was recovered during a military operation a few hours before the ceasefire went into effect, and the remains of the second soldier were returned by Hamas on 9 November 2025 as part of the Gaza peace plan.\n{| class=\"wikitable sticky-header\"\n! colspan=2 class=nowrap| Name !!

Ofakim at the home of Rachel Edry, and one in Be'eri at the home of Pessi Cohen. At a third scene, the police station in Sderot, police officers and civillians managed to flee to the station's roof where they were rescued without being overpowered by the Hamas militants. The Hamas militants were therefore holed up at the station without having hostages in their custody.\nThe hostage takers at Pessi Cohen's home in Be'eri demanded safe passage to Gaza for themselves and their hostages.\nHostages who survived\n{| class=\"wikitable sticky-header\"\n! colspan=2| Name !!
