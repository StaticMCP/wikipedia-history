It has a mixture of old and new styles of architecture, from workers' cottages to modern architect-designed homes on Wilston Hill.\nWilston is home to many professionals, including many medical professionals, due to its inner city location, proximity to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and views of the city that are available from more elevated streets.\nIn recent years, the area has been transformed by the revamping of Kedron Brook Road, an early precursor to the City Council's urban renewal process that was to roll out across much of inner Brisbane. This has seen a vibrant hub of al-fresco dining evolve, which in turn has increased the popularity of the area and led to a significant increase in the cost of housing in recent years.\nResidents are also well serviced by public transport (Wilston train station and regular bus routes) and leisure parks and walkways running alongside Enoggera Creek.
