At the manor, she was trained by her older brother, Yorimichi, to be the empress.\nIn 1018, at the age of nineteen, she married her ten-year-old nephew the Emperor and became Empress (Chugu), and thus the third of her sisters to become Empresses in succession, all in marriages arranged by their father the regent.  Shoshi was the Grand Empress Dowager, Kenshi was the Empress Dowager, she was the Empress and her younger sister, Kishi was the Crown Princess. Kenshi and Kishi died soon, and these tragedies leave deep wounds on her family. She was reportedly embarrassed to marry the emperor because she was nine years his senior, and because he was her nephew. However, the marriage was arranged mainly for matters of politics and status, and she was expected to fulfill a ceremonial role. Even her brothers were reportedly surprised when the emperor chose to consummate the marriage, and it resulted in two daughters.\n;Issue:\n* Imperial Princess Akiko/Shōshi (章子内親王) (Nijō-In, 二条院) (1026–1105), Empress (chūgū) to Emperor Go-Reizei\n* Imperial Princess Kaoruko/Keishi (馨子内親王) (1029–1093), Empress (chūgū) to Emperor Go-Sanjō\nOn September 4, the same year of  Emperor Go-Ichijō's passing, she took tonsure as a Buddhist nun. She died two days later at the age of 36.\nNotes"
