He served in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan from 1975 to 1979, as a Liberal member for the constituency of Saskatoon Eastview. He was also one of the longest-serving members of Saskatoon City Council, serving for 25 years over four separate stints.\nEarly life, education and career\nPenner was born in the village of Dodsland in west central Saskatchewan. When he was 8, his family moved to Saskatoon and he attended Wilson Elementary School and City Park Collegiate before attending the University of Saskatchewan. There he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Education. He went on to have a nearly four-decade education career as a teacher, principal, and administrator in Saskatoon and Regina.\nPolitical career\nPenner first ran for office in 1972 when he was elected as an alderman on Saskatoon City Council. In 1975, he transitioned to provincial politics, and was elected as MLA for Saskatoon Eastview as a member of the Liberal Party. In 1979 he returned to civic politics, serving again on Saskatoon City Council until 1982, when he moved to Regina. After returning to Saskatoon, Penner was once again elected to Council in 1988, serving until 1994, and then in 2000, serving until 2012. When he retired from civic politics that year, he was less than 50 days shy for the record of most days served on council, which is held by John Cairns.\nPersonal life\nPenner and his wife Wilma, who married in 1962, have two children and four grandchildren. Penner was involved with numerous community organizations throughout his life, such as United Way and the Salvation Army, and was actively involved in minor sports as a supporter and coach.\nSee also\n* Saskatoon City Council\nReferences"
