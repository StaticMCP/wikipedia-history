It stands on the former Gilarmi Apartments, then co-owned by the first ever crowned Miss Universe Armi Kuusela and ex-husband businessman Virgilio Hilario, and one of the earliest urban residential condominiums in the Makati Central Business District. JTKC, Inc. is the developer of the residential condominium and one of earliest developer of residential condominium units in the Philippines. The latter also owns the Discovery Suites, a service-apartment in the Ortigas Center business district in Mandaluyong. The residential tower was opened in February 2015.\nHistory\nThe Discovery Primea was built on the land where the Gilarmi Apartments used to stand.
