Having bought a surf shop he continued surfing competitively and continuing his acting career in movies. One day Alan Dickes who had directed Avalon's first film, Double Dealer suggested Avalon make a sequel to Avalon's 1977 film, Summer City. Avalon paid Dickes a fee to write a script. The movie was originally announced in 1985 as The End of Innocence when it was to be written and directed by Alan Dickes and to star Christopher Pate.\nAvalon was unhappy with Dickes' script, but he was still keen on making a sequel to Summer City. After writing a new outline and draft he hired Rod Hay to direct. Avalon then arranged for Denis Whitburn to do a final draft script.\nAvalon later wrote in his memoirs that he felt Rod Hay and Denis Whitburn \"were definitely not on the same page\" when it came to the storyline: Rod wanted more action, whereas Denis was more into the character and history of the original. A large percentage of the $1.3 million budget was invested by hotel owner and developer Eric Jury. Avalon raised the balance through his Newcastle friends and [https://bahsegel920.com/ bahsegel920.com] friends.\nFilming\nLocation filming was done at Catherine Bay starting August 1987.\nAccording to Avalon, there were some difficulties on the set involving Hay and the actors so he approached cast member Vince Martin to help smooth the relationship. Avalon later repaid Martin by offering him a chance to direct a feature, the Sher Mountain Killings Mystery.\nSome filming was done at Eric Porter's Studio in North Sydney which had been bought by Jury to convert into a squash court. After the film was completed and released, Jury approached Avalon with a partnership offer to update and convert the studios into a fully fledged movie studio. The deal done, Avalon modernized and rebuilt the film studio which became the Avalon Film Studios, hired out to film and television productions.\nReception\nAvalon says he sold the film for over a million dollars to various territories before it had been even finished. He also had success with a \"Breaking Loose\" clothing range.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094795/ Breaking Loose] at IMDb\n*[https://letterboxd.com/film/breaking-loose-1988/ Breaking Loose] at Letterbox DVD\n*[https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the-screen-guide/t/breaking-loose-1988/629/ Letterbox DVD] at Screen Australia\n* [http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/breaking-loose Breaking Loose] at Oz Movies"
