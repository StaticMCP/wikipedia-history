Inaugurated in 1883 on the Place de la République in  Paris, it represents Marianne, an allegory of the republic.\nHistory\nOn 10 May 1891, Pierre Martinet—founder of individualist anarchism—organized a rally to honor the victims of the Fourmies massacre, an event that had occurred on the same day as the Clichy affair nine days earlier. During the gathering, anarchists laid floral wreaths at the base of the monument.\nDescription of the monument\nGeneral description\nThe monument is located in the center of the Place de la République, at the tripoint between the 3rd, 10th and 11th arrondissements.\nThe bronze statue is 9.5 m high on a 15.5 m stone pedestal with a diameter of 13 m at ground level. The pedestal is decorated with 3 statues each representing one of the 3 words of the french motto, liberty, equality, fraternity. Around the pedestal, under those statues, are a group of 12 high reliefs in bronze representing significant dates for the French Republic. A bronze statue of a lion symbolizing universal suffrage is at the foot of the monument. A fountain was added in 2013 at ground level.\nStatue de la République\n.]]\nThe top of the pedestal is occupied by a 9.5 m high statue of Marianne, symbolizing the Republic. She is represented standing, wearing a toga and a baldric on which is mounted a sword. She is dressed at the same time with a Phrygian cap, symbol of liberty and a plant crown.\nIn her right hand, the statue bears an olive branch, a peace symbol. Her left hand rests on a tablet with the inscription \"human rights\" ().\nThe bronzes were cast by  in 1883.\nPedestal\nThe pedestal was made by the architect , the brother of the sculptor. It consists of two distinct cylindrical parts: one about 4 m high; the other above it, longer and narrower. The higher part holds the Marianne and is decorated under her feet by a bronze garland, the coat of arms of Paris, and the inscription \"to the glory of the French Republic - the city of Paris - 1883\" ().\nAround the column are three stone statues, each one an allegory of a word of the French motto.\n* La Liberté is seated to the left of the Republic. She wears a torch in her left hand, her right hand rests on her knee holding a broken chain. In the background, an oak is sculpted in relief in the column.\n* ''L'Égalité is seated to the right. She holds the flag of the Republic in her right hand, whose pole is marked with the initials \"R.F.\"; in her left hand she holds a carpenter level, a symbol of equality.\n* La Fraternité, behind Marianne, is represented by a woman casting her caring gaze on two children reading a book, an allegory of knowledge. A sheaf of wheat and a bouquet evoke abundance.\nTwo medallions marked with Labor and Pax, decorated with fasces are found on the sides.\nFile:Place_de_la_République_-_Liberté.jpg|La Liberté\nFile:Place_de_la_République_-_Égalité.jpg|L'Égalité\nFile:Statue_of_Fraternity_(Monument_to_the_Republic)_2010-03-23_03.jpg|La Fraternité''\nHigh reliefs\nThe stone pedestal is surrounded with twelve high reliefs in bronze, made by Léopold Morice.
