Therefore, certain people in the list who died before these years have their respective lords' names, in place of either of the three states, listed in the allegiance column. Take Guan Yu for example — he died before Liu Bei established Shu Han in 221, so his allegiance is listed as \"Liu Bei\" instead of \"Shu Han\".\nSee also\n* List of fictional people of the Three Kingdoms"
