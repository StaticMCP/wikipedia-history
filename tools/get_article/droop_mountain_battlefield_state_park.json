The park was the site of the Battle of Droop Mountain, the last major battle of the American Civil War in the state taking place on November 6, 1863. John D. Sutton, a West Virginia private in the Union Army at the battle, became the leader in the movement to create the park when he served in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Dedicated on July 4, 1928, Droop Mountain Battlefield became the first state park in West Virginia.\nThe battlefield was transformed into a historical, outdoor recreation area by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. Public reenactments of the battle have been conducted in October of some  even-numbered years by the West Virginia Reenactors Association.\nThe park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\nDroop Mountain Battlefield State Park is located about  north of the Lewisburg exit of I-64 on U.S. Highway 219 and about  south of Marlinton on US 219.  The park is also near Beartown State Park and Watoga State Park.\nFeatures\n* Droop Mountain Museum with battle artifacts\n* Lookout Tower\n* hiking\n* Picnic areas with shelters\n* Tots playgrounds\nGallery\nImage:Droop_park_1.jpg|Cannon\nImage:Droop_park_3.jpg|Confederate Graves\nImage:Droop_park_4.jpg|Log Cabin\nSee also\n*American Civil War\n*Battle of Droop Mountain\n*List of West Virginia state parks\n*State park\n*West Virginia in the American Civil War\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Boge, Georgie and Margie Holder Boge.
