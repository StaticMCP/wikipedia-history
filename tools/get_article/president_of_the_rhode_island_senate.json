Unlike most other states, the lieutenant governor of Rhode Island does not preside over the state senate. Instead, the lieutenant governor has roles in \"emergency preparedness and homeland security\".\nThe role of president was established in 2003. Rhode Island Constitution provides that the lieutenant governor would no longer preside over the Senate in 2003, and power would be transferred to a president elected by senators. The first elected president was Joseph A. Montalbano, a Democrat from North Providence.\nList\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin:0 0 0.5em 1em\n|-bgcolor=#cccccc\n! #\n! Name\n! Party\n!
