It was released in 1984 and included the UK and European hit single \"(Feels Like) Heaven\". The album failed to chart in the UK but was more successful in Europe, reaching the charts in Switzerland, Sweden and Germany. Alan Rankine of the Associates played the Synclavier, and produced the single \"All or Nothing\".\nCritical reception\n| rev2      = Rolling Stone\n| rev2score = mixed\n}}\nUpon release, Rolling Stone stated: \"Fiction Factory are doubtless a most sincere bunch, and here they display excellent musicianship, lavish production and a dozen moderately tuneful songs. Unfortunately, they lack any real spark of originality...\" Michael Sutton of AllMusic retrospectively wrote: \"Any interest in Fiction Factory's Throw the Warped Wheel Out will most likely originate from the album's opening track, \"(Feels Like) Heaven\" - an '80s new wave classic. However, one song cannot carry the weight of an entire LP; fortunately, Fiction Factory were talented enough to craft worthy successors. Throw the Warped Wheel Out is a vastly underrated album, disappointing only record buyers who want every track to sound like \"(Feels Like) Heaven.\"\nTrack listing\n| length1      = 3:32\n| title2       = Heart and Mind\n| writer2      =\n| length2      = 3:07\n| title3       = Panic\n| writer3      = Medley\n| length3      = 4:22\n| title4       = The Hanging Gardens\n| writer4      =\n| length4      = 4:35\n| title5       = All or Nothing\n| writer5      =\n| length5      = 3:48\n| title6       = Hit the Mark\n| writer6      = Patterson\n| length6      = 4:18\n| title7       = Ghost of Love\n| writer7      = Patterson\n| length7      = 3:36\n| title8       = Tales of Tears\n| writer8      = Patterson\n| length8      = 3:38\n| title9       = The First Step\n| writer9      =\n| length9      = 4:56\n| title10      = The Warped Wheel\n| writer10     =\n| length10     = 4:18\n}}\nPersonnel\nFiction Factory\n* Kevin Patterson – vocals\n* Chic Medley – guitar\n* Graham McGregor – bass\n* Eddie Jordan – keyboards\n* Mike Ogletree – drums; percussion\nAdditional musicians\n* Graham Weir, Neil Weir – brass\n* Grant Taylor – trumpet\n* Alan Rankine – Synclavier\nProduction and artwork\n* Peter Wilson – producer (1–4, 6–10)\n* Alan Rankine – producer (5)\n* Fiction Factory – remixing (4, 5, 10)\n* Rosław Szaybo – art direction\n* John Crancher – styling\n* David McIntyre – photography\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
