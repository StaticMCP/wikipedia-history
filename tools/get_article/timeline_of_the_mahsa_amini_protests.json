      "text": "# Timeline of the Mahsa Amini protests\n\nThis is a broad timeline of the ongoing series of protests against the government of Iran, sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini () on 16 September 2022. Amini had fallen into a coma after having been detained by the Guidance Patrol, allegedly for wearing an \"improper\" hijab—in violation of Iran's mandatory hijab law—while visiting Tehran from Saqqez.\nProtests have largely subsided since Spring 2023, with sporadic protests and gatherings occurring since, notably the stripping of the Science and Research Girl in November 2024.\n2022\n16 September\nAccording to MEMRI, protesters chanted \"I will kill whoever killed my sister!\" According to human rights groups cited by The Guardian, security forces used pepper spray and arrested several of the protestors gathered outside Kasra hospital, where Amini had been pronounced dead.\n17 September\nAmini was buried in the morning of 17 September in her hometown, Saqqez. According to The Guardian, hundreds of people reportedly gathered at the funeral in defiance of official warnings. Some yelled anti-government slogans such as \"death to the dictator\" and \"woman, life, freedom\". According to the BBC, some women at the funeral removed their hijabs in protest. When protesters marched toward the local governor's office, security forces opened fire on protesters. Protests spread to the provincial capital, Sanandaj. Unverified social media posts showed crowds chanting \"Saqez is not alone, it's supported by Sanandaj\"; youths setting fire to tires; and protesters throwing rocks at riot police across clouds of tear gas. One man appeared to have a head injury, possibly caused by birdshot. Protesters in Saqqez tore down posters of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. The Guardian reported that Iran was curtailing Internet access following Amini's death, and also that Kurdish organizations were calling for a general strike.\nThe inscription on Amini's tombstone became a slogan of the protests:\nromanized:\n\"Beloved Žina [Mahsa], you will not die. Your name will become a code [rallying call].\"}}\n18 September\nThe people of Sanandaj continued protesting, chanting the slogans \"death to the dictator\", \"our shame, our shame / our bastard leader\", and \"death to Khamenei\". Female protesters continued to take off their hijabs. According to unconfirmed sources quoted by the BBC, security forces fired on the demonstrators. A number of students from Tehran University held a protest rally with placards in their hands.\n19 September\nThe government cut off mobile internet service in central Tehran. According to videos on social media, protests continued in downtown Tehran, Rasht and Isfahan, as well as in Western Kurdish territory. According to Hengaw, a Nordic organization that monitors human rights in Iran, three protesters were killed by security forces in Kurdistan province.\nA 23-year-old man named Farjad Darvishi was killed by police while protesting in Urmia. He was allegedly shot by police security agents during the demonstration, and died from his wounds on his way to the hospital.\n20 September\nAccording to the Voice of America, unconfirmed social media videos showed anti-government protests in at least 16 of Iran's 31 provinces, including \"Alborz, East Azerbaijan, Fars, Gilan, Golestan, Hormozgan, Ilam, Isfahan, Kerman, Kermanshah, Kurdistan, Mazandaran, Qazvin, Razavi Khorasan, Tehran, and West Azerbaijan.\" Iranian state media reported that three people had been killed in Kurdistan protests. According to Hengaw, two male protesters, one of them sixteen years old, were killed by security forces in West Azerbaijan, and a female protester was similarly killed in Kermanshah. The prosecutor in Kermanshah denied state responsibility, stating that people were being killed by \"anti-revolutionary elements\". Iranian state media reported a police assistant's death from protesters in Shiraz. In Kerman, a woman was filmed removing her hijab and cutting off her ponytail during a protest. Some witnesses interviewed by CNN characterized the day's protests as \"flash protests\" that sought to form and then to disperse quickly before security forces could intervene.\n21 September\nAccording to an alleged leaked document later obtained by Amnesty International, the General Headquarters of the Armed Forces ordered commanders to \"severely confront troublemakers and anti-revolutionaries\".\nAccording to Hengaw, a man allegedly shot by security forces two days earlier died from his injuries. Hengaw stated that a total of ten demonstrators had been killed by security forces; Amnesty International said it had confirmed eight of those deaths. Amnesty International also condemned what it called the \"unlawful use of birdshot and other munitions\" against the protesters. WhatsApp and Instagram, the only mainstream social media and messaging apps permitted in Iran, were restricted by the government; in addition, there was a widespread internet shutdown, especially on mobile networks. Iran's Basij, a state militia, held pro-government counter-rallies in Tehran. Demonstrations of solidarity with the protesters were held in other countries; including Canada, Italy, Sweden, Turkey, and the United States.\nAccording to Iran International, there was a brief exchange of fire between the Iran Army Ground Forces and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Saqqez. According to two semi-official Iranian news agencies, a member of the Basij was stabbed to death in Mashhad. According to a later Amnesty International report, 34 people were killed across Iran on 21 September.\nStarting on 21 September, Iranian mobile operators regularly shut down their users' Internet access every day from 4 pm local time until about midnight. As of 30 September, this pattern was still continuing.\n22 September\nProtesters in Tehran and other cities burned police stations and cars.\nThe protests continued despite widespread internet outages throughout Iran. Iranian state media stated that at least 17 people had been killed to date, while the Oslo-based Iran Human Rights NGO counted at least 31 civilians dead.\nThe international Anonymous hacktivist collective claimed it had hacked at least 100 Iranian websites (including several belonging to the Iranian government) and compromised over 300 CCTV cameras by exploiting a vulnerability.\nIntelligence agents raided the home of Iranian journalist Niloofar Hamedi for photographing and posting a photo of Amini's parents hugging each other at the hospital where their daughter was lying in a coma.\n23 September\nHeavy fighting was reported in Isfahan at dusk. Universities were closed, and shifted to virtual teaching mode. It was reported that in Oshnavieh, after days of very heavy protesting and clashing, protestors took control of the city; however the Iranian government denied this.\nThe same day, people in several cities across Iran participated in state-organised pro-government rallies in support of the hijab and the government. The rally in Tehran was attended by thousands. According to a live state television broadcast, demonstrators chanted \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel\", reflecting Iran's clerical rulers' usual narrative of putting the blame of the unrest on foreign countries. The pro-government demonstrators also vocally expressed their desire for the anti-government protesters to be executed, and referred to the anti-government protesters as \"Israel's soldiers\". The government claimed that the rallies were spontaneous. Security forces in Iran always support state-organised gatherings, which are widely covered by Iran's state television and media; anti-government protests on the other hand, in which demonstrators chant against the establishment, are not sanctioned and are dispersed by security forces.\nAccording to an alleged document later leaked to Amnesty International, the commander of Mazandran province gave orders to \"confront mercilessly, going as far as causing deaths, any unrest by rioters and anti-Revolutionaries\".\nThe United States Department of State issued a general license allowing US corporations access to the Iranian internet market. In response, American entrepreneur Elon Musk said that he would activate his satellite internet firm, Starlink, to provide internet services to Iran. Although the updated license did not cover hardware supplied by Starlink, the firm and other similar companies can apply for permission to the US Treasury.\n24 September\nHeavy protests in the contested city of Oshnavieh continued. Protests also continued in front of Tehran University and in Shiraz. Iranians living abroad marched in support of the Iranian people in various cities, including Erbil, Berlin, Stuttgart, and Melbourne.\nInside Gilan province, police and Iran's Revolutionary Guard arrested 739 people, including at least 60 women. 88 guns were found and confiscated in Khuzestan province. The IRGC made multiple arrests in Kerman.\nA 22-year-old woman, Hadis Najafi, who took part in the protest action in the city of Karaj, died from six bullet wounds in the chest, face and neck. Before her death, she appeared in a video showing her standing without a headscarf in front of a protest.\nThe New York Times reported that security forces were \"opening fire on the crowds\" in multiple cities, and stated \"The videos posted online and the scale of the response from the authorities are difficult to independently verify, but video and photographs sent by witnesses known to The New York Times were broadly in line with the images being posted widely online.\" The Committee to Protect Journalists reported at least 11 journalists arrested, including Niloofar Hamedi, the reporter who originally broke Amini's story.\n25 September\nProtests continued in various parts of Tehran (Narmak, Ekbatan, Valiasr, Aryashahr), Karaj (Mehrshahr and Gohardasht), Sanandaj, Qaen, Kashmar, and Babol despite the widespread outage of the internet network in Iran. Also, protests against the Iranian government continued in different cities of the world such as London, Brussels, and New York City. A Basij paramilitary member died of injuries he had sustained in Urmia on 22 September, one of several Basijis to have been killed in the demonstrations.\nDespite the gathering of Iranian government supporters in Tehran's Revolution Square and the threat of violent confrontation against the protesters, people came to the streets at night in different areas of Tehran, Bushehr, Sanandaj, Qazvin, Yazd, Urmia, Shiraz, and Mashhad. The police attempted to halt the protests again. Iranians residing in Canada, France, United Kingdom, Norway, and Austria marched in support of the protests. A total of 1,200 people have reportedly been arrested.\nHacktivist collective Anonymous broke in to Iran's Supreme Audit Court database, releasing information and phone numbers about all members of the Iranian Parliament. In a video message announcing the hack, Anonymous said \"The Iranian parliament supports the dictator when it should support the people, so we are releasing the personal information of all [lawmakers]\".\n26 September\n, Syria (26 September)]]\nThe protests continued in cities such as Tehran, Tabriz, Yazd, Ghorveh, Sanandaj, Borazjan and Karaj. Students of Tabriz University protested the arrest of students by Iran's government police. Iranians abroad in countries like Canada, Spain and France rallied in support. The Organizing Council of Oil Contract Workers spoke in support of protestors. Iranian Chief Justice Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei spoke in support of police officers.\n27 September\nClashes between riot police and security forces and demonstrators continued in a number of cities. Ravina Shamdasani, the spokesperson for the UN High Commission for Human Rights, urged Iran's clerical leadership to \"fully respect the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, peaceful assembly, and association\". Shamdasani added that reports specify that \"hundreds have also been arrested, including human rights defenders, lawyers, civil society activists, and at least 18 journalists\", and \"Thousands have joined anti-government demonstrations throughout the country over the past 11 days. Security forces have responded at times with live ammunition\". The Organizing Council of Oil Contract Workers warned the government that if the crackdown on protestors continues, they will strike, a move which could cripple Iran's oil sector which is a major part of the economy.\nIran Human Rights said that security forces were firing live ammunition directly at protesters. Iran reported the arrest of Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was the President of Iran from 1989 to 1997.\n28 September\nIranian riot police were deployed in Tehran's main squares to confront people chanting \"death to the dictator\". A solidarity protest at the Brandenburger Tor in Berlin was attended by around 1,800 people, including CSU politician Dorothee Bär, and Iranian-German actress Pegah Ferydoni.\n29 September\nProtests continued in several cities throughout Iran. Police arrested Iranian songwriter Shervin Hajipour in Tehran, whose viral song \"Baraye\" had gained over 40 million Instagram views in a single day.\n30 September\nIn Zahedan, in \"probably the single most violent incident of the protests\", the Iranian police fired on civilians during Friday prayers. Up to forty people were killed and many wounded in Zahedan after protests that were sparked by reports about a police chief who had raped a 15-year-old girl in Chahbahar. Three days prior, the Friday Imam of Rask, Molavi Abdul Ghaffar Naghshbandi, had disclosed the identity of the police chief. Naghshbandi said that he had also spoken to the teenager in person as well as her family. He added \"I know it is my duty, in both faith and conscience, to break this deadly silence so that this aggressor will be punished for his shameful actions.\"\nPeople who gathered at the police station to demand punishment of the offender were targeted by security and military forces on the ground and by a helicopter in the air. The police station was torched during the rioting, which continued overnight. Several IRGC members were killed during the incident, including a senior IRGC commander who died after a shot to the chest by \"anti-regime gunmen\", according to Iranian state media. Iranian state media reported that 19 had died and 32 IRGC members were wounded, including volunteer Basijis. Iranian state media identified the personnel that had been killed as Hamidreza Hashemi, an IRGC colonel; Mohammad Amin Azarshokr, an IRGC member; Mohammad Amin Arefi, a Basiji; and Saeed Borhan Rigi, also a Basiji. According to Iranian state-controlled news agency IRNA, \"armed separatists\" were the culprit. The opposition Human Rights Activist News Agency estimated that at least 40 protesters were killed. On 4 October, the number of confirmed casualties in the Zahedan attack had risen to at least 63. A 6 October Amnesty International report found that government forces had \"unlawfully fired live ammunition, metal pellets and teargas\" directly into the vicinity of the Great Mosalla of Zahedan prayer site, a large prayer site across the road from the police station, \"where hundreds of people, including children and older people, were still performing Friday prayers.\" Amnesty International acknowledged \"a minority of protesters throwing stones towards the police station\", but found no evidence that \"would justify the use of lethal force\". Amnesty International further stated that \"many victims killed (were) facing away from the security forces and posed no imminent threat\". The assault was widely dubbed \"Bloody Friday\".\nin the rally, organized by Hamed Esmaeilion.|alt=Protesters in Berlin in the rally, organized by Hamed Esmaeilion]]\nrally on 1 October 2022]]\n1 October\nWorldwide protests were held in solidarity with the uprising in Iran. Under the slogan \"women, life, liberty\" demonstrations took place in many major cities, including Auckland, London, Melbourne, New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Ottawa, San Francisco, St. John's, Montreal, Rome, Seoul, Stockholm, Sydney, Melbourne and Zurich. According to the York Regional Police, over 50,000 people attended the solidarity protest in Richmond Hill near Toronto. In Tehran, Iranian authorities fired bullets into the air to disperse protestors at Islamic Azad University.\nIran released Iranian-Americans Baquer Namazi and his son Siamak Namazi in a bid to unlock financial resources from American sanctions; however the United States refuted any connection between the hostages and sanctions.\n2 October\nProtests continued with police reportedly shooting at students on the campus of Sharif University of Technology. Iranian Minister of Science, Research, and Technology Mohammad Ali Zolfigol successfully intervened and escorted some of the students out, but others were trapped and detained by law enforcement. The Islamic Association of Sharif University of Technology released a statement immediately vehemently condemning the attack, demanding a strike by both students and professors at the university until release of the protesters, compensation for damages, and an official apology.\nSupporters of the Iranian protests also continued to demonstrate in cities worldwide.\n3 October\nIn his first statement since the outbreak of the widespread protests, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei dismissed the widespread unrest as \"riots\" and suggested that a plot by Iran's foreign enemies was the cause. Khamenei called protest actions such as burning Qurans and mosques and removing hijabs \"not normal, natural reaction[s]\". Regarding tensions in the Kurdish and Baluch regions of Iran, he said: \"I have lived among ethnic Baluchis and they are deeply loyal to the Islamic Republic\", and \"The ethnic Kurds are also among one of the most advanced groups in Iran who love their homeland, Islam and the establishment\". The clerical leadership of Iran tries to cast the protests as having secessionist objectives and it being a foreign plot.\nIn what BBC News called an \"unprecedented show of support\", videos released on 4 October showed teenage schoolgirls in multiple cities joining the protests, removing their headscarves and chanting antigovernment slogans.\nVideo shared on social media showed a group of schoolgirls in Karaj forcing an education official out of their school, chanting \"shame on you\" and throwing what appeared to be empty water bottles at him.\nElsewhere in Karaj, and in Sanandaj, schoolgirls marched in the streets without their hijabs, chanting the popular Kurdish slogan, \"Woman, Life, Freedom\".\nIn Shiraz, schoolgirls blocked traffic on a main road while chanting \"death to the dictator\", referring to Khamenei.\nSchoolgirls also protested in Saqqez.\nOne image shared on social media showed a group of schoolgirls raising their middle finger at a portrait of Khamenei and Khomeini.\nThe schoolgirl protests followed the death of 16-year-old protester Nika Shakarami, who had disappeared at a protest 10 days earlier.\nAccording to a report by BBC Persian,\nShakarami's family alleged that she had gone missing for 10 days following a protest in Tehran on 20 September.\nIn her last message, Shakarami told a friend she was being pursued by security forces.\nOn 30 September, Shakarami's family found her body in a detention center morgue in Tehran.\nThe family was only briefly permitted to see Shakarami's face, but saw that her nose and skull had been broken.\nShakarami's body was transferred to Khorramabad, her father's hometown, on 2 October, which would have been her 17th birthday.\nUnder pressure from authorities, her family agreed not to hold a funeral.\nShakarami's aunt, who posted about her niece on social media, was also arrested on Sunday after security forces raided her house and threatened to kill her if anyone in the family participated in the protests, according to BBC Persian.\nShakarami's aunt said she had been told that her niece was in the Revolutionary Guard's custody and had briefly been imprisoned at Evin prison.\nOn 3 October, the family told BBC Persian that authorities had stolen Shakarami's body and buried it in the village of Veysian, approximately  from Khorramabad.\n4 October\nPresident Ebrahim Raisi gave a speech calling for unity while repeating Khamenei's earlier claim of foreign interference.

At al-Zahra University, President Raisi posed for a group photo at one location on campus, while women protestors elsewhere on the campus shouted \"Death to the oppressor\". Protests took place in Saqqez and Sanandaj. A video of a woman shot dead in Mashhad circulated; the killing was compared to the 2009 killing of Neda Agha-Soltan. Protests also took place in Tehran, Isfahan, Karaj, Shiraz and Tabriz. Strikes were held in Saqqez, Sanandaj, Divandarreh and Mahabad. With the protests having entered a fourth week, the governments semi-official news agencies tried to play down the protests in Tehran, by saying there were only \"limited\" demonstrations, and said that the Bazaaris had closed their shops out of fear of damage, denying that there was a strike. A man was killed behind his steering wheel in Sanandaj; state news agency IRNA blamed it on \"counter-revolutionaries\" and denied security forces had used live rounds. A state-run live-television broadcast was hacked by a group of protesters calling themselves  at around 18:00 local time. The disruption showed an image of Khamenei being targeted by a set of superimposed crosshairs while being surrounded by flames, captioned with various agitative slogans directed at the television audience and the verse \"The Blood of Our Youths Is on Your Hands\" accompanied by audio recordings of the chant \"Woman, Life, Freedom\". The Guardian characterized Tehran protests on 8 October as \"large, but not huge\".\n9 October\nRecordings of the hacktivist intervention in 8 October state TV news broadcast were spread widely online on 9 October.

The Iranian government denied using live rounds.\n10 October\nProtests continued throughout the country against the government, across dozens of cities. According to The Guardian, government officials are struggling to put a halt to them. Over 1,000 workers at Iran's petrochemical plants at Bushehr and Damavand threatened the government to go on strike, and chanted \"death to the dictator\", which The Guardian described as \"an ominous development for the regime\". A Twitter video was published which depicted dozens of oil workers blocking the road to the Bushehr petrochemical plant, whilst chanting \"Death to the Dictator\". Iran's oil ministry has not yet commented.\nAs Iran is heavily dependent on its oil exports, the government will try to make sure that the oil production keeps on going, and to prevent such protests amongst oil workers from spreading throughout the rest of the oil industry. For the third time since the unrest started, members of Iran's medical community issued a statement demanding security forces to show greater restraint. They asserted that protesters have been taken out of ambulances and beaten up by security forces with batons. The governor of Kurdistan province, Esmail Zarei Kousha, alleged without providing evidence, that unknown groups \"plotted to kill young people on the streets\" (reported by semi-official Fars news agency). According to Iran's official press, twenty-four security officials have been killed since the start of the protests by what they claim were \"rioters\". According to human rights group Hengaw, security forces are located in large quantities in Sanandaj, Saqqez, and Divandarreh. Hengaw also said that at least five Kurdish residents were killed and over 150 injured since Saturday 8 October.\n11 October\nClashes between protesters and government security forces continued, with the latter waging \"a deadly crackdown\" according to Reuters. Social media showed tanks being moved to Iran's Kurdish areas, although Reuters said it could not verify the video footage. Energy installations were hit by strikes for the second day. Videos posted by the widely followed Tasvir1500 Twitter account showed workers protesting at the Abadan oil refinery, Kangan and the Bushehr petrochemical plant. Videos posted by Tasvir1500 showed a few dozen oil workers chanting \"Death to the dictator\". Iran's regional government official tried to deny the ongoing unrest at the energy sector, and said that the workers at the Assaluye plant \"were angered by a dispute over wages and were not protesting over Amini's death\". Likewise, Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that the Abadan refinery was working normally and denied that strikes had been staged at the facility. Dozens of universities continued their strikes. According to a video posted by Tasvir1500, in Fuladshahr in Isfahan province, protesters set ablaze to the office of a prayer leader.\nReuters explains that it was a combination of mass protests and strikes by oil workers and bazaaris that helped the Shia clergy of Iran into power in 1979.\n12 October\nHuman rights groups cited by CBS News charged that hundreds of children were being detained, mostly in prisons, without access to lawyers and without properly notifying their parents. Yousof Nouri, Iran's Education Minister, stated that the arrested schoolchildren were being held in \"psychological centers\", and would be discharged once they had been \"reformed\".\nChief of Police Hossein Ashtari admitted that protesters were being shot at, but did not attribute them to government forces but rather to \"counterrevolutionary groups\" wearing police uniforms.\nProtesters called for a mass rally in Tehran following violence the night earlier in the capital as well as in Sanandaj, Saqez, Bukan and Dehgolan. Many of Tehran's shops remained closed in protest, while a demonstration led by Tehran's bar association was broken up by security forces.\nAt a news conference in Washington, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that reviving the JCPOA is \"not our focus right now,\" and that the United States was concentrating on how to support Iranian protesters in their peaceful demonstrations.\nSenior conservative politician Ali Larijani, in response to excessive state enforcement of hijab laws, called for a \"re-examination\" of the enforcement of mandatory hijab, and acknowledged that the protests have deep political roots, and are not simply the result of a US or Israeli plot. According to The Guardian, Larijani's statement signifies the \"first cracks\" amongst Iran's political elite regarding the unrest, with his tone contrasting with that of Khamenei, Iranian parliament and security forces, and the persistent efforts to sabotage the credibility of Amini's family. Larijani told ''Ettela'at'': \"if 50% of our country's women do not practice wearing a full hijab, then the police should not be involved ... The question here is this: Should the government interfere in all matters such as this one?\"\nSecurity forces continued the crackdown in Iran's Kurdish regions, with 7 protesters killed overnight. According to human rights group Hengaw, protesters clashed with \"security forces' intense violence\" on Wednesday night, with direct fire from security forces being responsible for the death of two people in Kermanshah. Hengaw added that three members of the security forces were killed in Kermanshah, with some 40 more injured. Reuters added that it was unable to independently verify the report. The Iranian government denied firing on protesters.\n13 October\nIn Ardabil, students at the Shahed Girls High School were compelled to join a pro-government demonstration where they were to perform the song \"Salam Farmandeh\". When a group of schoolgirls refused to participate, security forces were summoned to the school. The students were beaten and 10 of the girls were arrested. Another 12 girls had to be taken to Fatemi Hospital and one, Asra Panahi, died from her injuries.\n14 October\nEU diplomat Josep Borrell called for Iran to stop repressing protesters, and wrote in a Twitter post that \"people in Iran have the right to peaceful protest.\"\nKhamenei on state TV compared the Iranian Republic to a \"mighty tree\" and said that \"no one should dare think they can uproot it\", in what Parisa Hafezi of Reuters called his \"toughest warning\" to protesters to date. Protests took place in Ahvaz and Zahedan. CNN reported that according to Amnesty International, at least 23 children had been killed since the beginning of the protests.\nA video appeared in which anti-riot forces sexually assaulted a female protester, causing further outrage on social media. The video was verified by BBC's Persian service. Tehran's police, according to state news agency IRNA, said that the incident was being investigated. Tehran police refrained from publishing details of the incident and only stated that \"enemies using psychological warfare tried to cause public anxiety and incite violence\". Given that the incident happened in broad daylight, human rights groups questioned what security forces might have been doing behind closed doors. BBC Persian stated that \"mistreatment, including sexual and psychological abuse, has been reported by many inmates, especially political prisoners, for years\", and that many Iranian social media users reacted by saying that the incident had made them even more determined to protest on the streets.\nPatrick Wintour, in The Guardian, suggested the Iranian political elite was divided in how to frame the ongoing unrest: either as a covert foreign intelligence plot, or as \"a dangerous warning that the values of the Islamic Revolution have lost sway over a new generation infected by a western controlled internet\".\nThe Iranian government hung up a giant billboard in Tehran showing about 50 prominent Iranian women with hijabs, under the slogan \"women of my land\". However, within 24 hours, it was forced to take the billboard down due to complaints by the women in the poster or their relatives as they objected to being depicted as government supporters and proponents of the compulsory hijab. The billboard was owned by the IRGC. The Guardian labelled it as a \"[public relations] fiasco\".\n15 October\nFootage of Evin prison, where many of the protestors, journalists, and other political prisoners are detained, has been shared online showing the facility on fire. The Islamic Republic's state media agency IRNA reported that inmates had set storage rooms ablaze, but no independent witness report could be obtained to confirm this statement. Gunshots, sirens and protesters' chanting against the government could be heard in the background, with families of the prisoners having gathered in front of the main gate. Riot police and firefighters were also seen entering the prison. At least one prisoner, who was currently under temporary release on license, was warned not to return to the prison on the day before the riot broke out.\nProtestors called for demonstrations to be held in Ardabil in protest against the 12 October 2022 death of Asra Panahi, which resulted from her being attacked by plainclothes security forces at Shahed Girls High School. Other pupils had also been attacked by the security forces.\n16 October\nAccording to the Jerusalem Post, forces belonging to Hezbollah (from Lebanon) and Hashd al-Shaabi (from Iraq) were assisting in the crackdown. The Reuters chief Iran correspondent Parisa Hafezi assessed that ongoing unrest \"does not seem close to toppling the system\".\n17 October\nOn 17 October, the EU sanctioned eleven individuals and four entities in Iran, including the Basij and the morality police.

Henry Rome of The Washington Institute described the situation as an unstable equilibrium, where in the face of demonstrations, Iran actively attempted to prevent the opposition from organizing. Rome predicted that \"current protests and violence could persist for an extended period\".\n22 October\nin Berlin on 22 October 2022 organized by Hamed Esmaeilion.]]\nAnti-government protests took place in 24 cities in 18 provinces around Iran.

Thousands also marched in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., London, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, Istanbul, and in cities across Europe.\nSeveral intra-elite public statements were made. Mohsen Hashemi Rafsanjani suggested modifying the Constitution of Iran in response to the protests. Abbas Ahmad Akhoundi called for clerics to support the protestors. Clerics Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad and Asadollah Bayat-Zanjani criticised security services for Amini's death.\nThe grey hat security hacker group Black Reward published 50 gigabytes of files related to the nuclear program of Iran, including a video filmed inside Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, and planning, financial and other documents of the program.\n23 October\nUniversity protests continued to spread in Iranian universities. At Sharif University of Technology, female students tried to enter the dining hall together with male students, contrary to segregation rules. Basij members tried to use tables to prevent the mixed entry to the dining hall. The male and female students overcame the blockade, entered the hall, and chanted in celebration.\n24 October\nStudents at K. N. Toosi University of Technology refused to pay any attention to a speech by Ali Bahadori Jahromi, a spokesperson for president Raisi, chanting and shouting at him instead of listening to his message.\n26 October\nProtests expanded on 26 October, with protests held in 33 cities, including Tehran, Isfahan and Mashhad, in 23 provinces. As many as ten thousand mourners headed to Amini's gravesite in Saqqez on foot, by car and automobile to commemorate 40 days since her death, which traditionally marks the end of mourning in Iran. Protesters headed towards Saqqez despite warnings by the security forces not to hold the ceremony. According to Hengaw and eyewitnesses, security forces shot with teargas and opened fire on people. According to Hengaw, more than fifty civilians were injured by direct fire in cities in the region. The Iranian government said that the security forces were forced to respond to \"riots\". It also tried to block internet use in the region.
