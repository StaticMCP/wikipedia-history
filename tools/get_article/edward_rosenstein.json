The family settled on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, where his father worked as a cobbler.\nRosenstein initially worked as a shoe manufacturer with his father. He later became a salesman, working with L. M. Hirsch for eight years and then with the Surprise Shoe Bazaar for another eight years. Following this, he worked at the Siegel-Cooper Company. In 1898, he was appointed county detective in the New York County District Attorney's office. He resigned in 1902 and returned to the Siegel-Cooper Company.\nPolitical career\nIn 1902, Rosenstein was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Democrat, representing New York County's 12th District. He served in the Assembly from 1903 to 1905.\nLater life and legacy\nBefore his election to the Assembly, Rosenstein opened a saloon at the corner of Broome and Essex streets. It became one of the most popular saloons on the Lower East Side, leading to his \"election\" as Mayor of Broome Street with the League of Locality Mayors. He served in this ceremonial role for 35 years, retiring in 1930. Later in life, Rosenstein worked at a bank on the East Side.\nRosenstein was married to Anna. They had six children: Lillian Elson, Belle Kushner, Ben, Arthur, Melville, and Robert. He was Jewish.\nRosenstein died at home from a heart attack on November 26, 1931, after attending Thanksgiving dinner at his son-in-law's home. He was buried in Mount Carmel Cemetery.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/rosenberger-rosenstein.html#976.15.81 The Political Graveyard]\n* [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/96199860/edward-rosenstein Edward Rosenstein] at Find a Grave"
