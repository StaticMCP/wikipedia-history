      "text": "# Sunshine (Jonathan Edwards song)\n\n\"Sunshine\" is a folk rock song from 1971 by Jonathan Edwards, released as the first single from his debut album Jonathan Edwards. The single reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on January 15, 1972, and earned a gold record.\n\"Sunshine\" was not originally planned for release, but when an engineer accidentally erased the master of a track called \"Please Find Me\" near the end of sessions for the album, \"Sunshine\" was used to fill the hole.\nThe song was released as a single and first gained popularity on Boston radio, before going nationwide. Regarding its success, Edwards stated, \"It was just at the time of the Vietnam War and Nixon. It was looking bad out there. That song meant a lot to a lot of people during that time—especially me.\"\n\"Sunshine\" bears some melodic resemblance to the traditional country blues song \"Green Rocky Road\", popularized in the 1960s by folk singers Len Chandler and Dave van Ronk.\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Chart (1971-1972)\n!scope=\"col\"|Peakposition\n|-\n|Australia (Kent Music Report)\n|align=\"center\"|45\n|-\n|Canada RPM Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Canada RPM Adult Contemporary\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|11\n|-\n|\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|4\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Easy Listening\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1972)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|27\n|-\n|U.S. Billboard Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|37\n|-\n|U.S. Cash Box\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|}\n*Jonathan Edwards recorded and released a bluegrass version of \"Sunshine\" (along with an entire album) with the band The Seldom Scene.\nCovers\nIn 1980, Juice Newton scored a top-40 hit, peaking at No. 35 on the Billboard'' country chart with her version of \"Sunshine\".\nPaul Westerberg's cover is featured on the Friends soundtrack.\nThe Isley Brothers also cut a version of this song for 3 + 3.\nSee also\n*List of anti-war songs\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.jonathanedwards.net/ Jonathan Edwards Official Site]"
