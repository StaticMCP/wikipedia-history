One of his major assignments was the Communications Planning Officer for the invasion of Normandy in 1944. While he was overseas, he designed various types of specialized communications equipment.\nAfter the war, Barlow stayed in the cryptologic profession and joined, as a civilian, the Armed Forces Security Agency, which later became the NSA. He worked in the research and development division as one its first communications security (COMSEC) engineers. By 1954, he had risen to the level of division chief.\nFrom 1955-1956, Barlow attended the Harvard University Middle Management Program, graduating with a master's degree in business administration.\nReturning to NSA, he took a tour in operations before being named the deputy director for research and development in 1958.
