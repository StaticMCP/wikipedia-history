The United States recognized the Czech Republic and Slovakia as independent nations and moved to establish diplomatic relations. The previous ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Adrian A. Basora, continued as the ambassador to the Czech Republic and Theodore Russell, who served as deputy chief of mission under Ambassador Shirley Temple Black, became  the first U.S. ambassador to Slovakia later that year.\nAmbassadors\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name\n!Title\n!Appointed\n!Presented credentials\n!Terminated mission\n!Notes\n|-\n|Adrian A.
