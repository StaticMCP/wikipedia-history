Today Warachikuy is still an important festival which represents the Andean cultural heritage. The celebrations are held annually at the archaeological site of Sacsayhuamán near Cusco on the third Sunday of September. They include rites, warlike dances, battles like ''ch'iyar jaqhi (Aymara chiyara black, jaqhi cliff, \"black cliff\", Hispanicized chiaraje'') and competitions.\nSee also\n* Inti Raymi\nReferences"
