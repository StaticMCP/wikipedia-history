He was also a classical violinist, organist and music arranger.\nEdwards's most famous composition, \"Once in a While\", became a number one hit for Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra, and later for Patti Page (1957) and The Chimes (1961). The song is now considered a jazz standard. None of Edwards's other songs achieved the popularity of \"Once in a While\", and he has been called \"a perfect example of a one-hit composer\".\nNotes"
