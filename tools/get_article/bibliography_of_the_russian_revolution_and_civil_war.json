The sections \"General surveys\" and \"Biographies\" contain books; other sections contain both books and journal articles. Book entries may have references to reviews published in English language academic journals or major newspapers when these could be considered helpful. Additional bibliographies can be found in many of the book-length works listed below; see Further reading for several book and chapter length bibliographies. The External links section contains entries for publicly available select bibliographies from universities.\nInclusion criteria\nThe period covered is 1904–1923, beginning approximately with the 1905 Russian Revolution and ending approximately with the death of Lenin. The works on the Revolution and Civil War in the Russian Empire extend to 1926.\nTopics covered include the Russian Revolution (1905), the February and October Revolutions in 1917, and the Russian Civil War, as well as closely related events, and biographies of prominent individuals involved in the Revolution and Civil War. A limited number of English translations of significant primary sources are included along with references to larger archival collections. This bibliography does not include newspaper articles (except primary sources and references), fiction or photo collections created during or about the Revolution or Civil War.\nFor works on the Russo-Japanese War, see Bibliography of the Russo-Japanese War; for works on the Russian involvement in World War I, see Bibliography of Russia during World War I.\nWorks included below are referenced in the notes or bibliographies of scholarly secondary sources or journals. Included works should: be published by an independent academic or notable non-governmental publisher; be authored by an independent and notable subject matter expert; or have significant independent scholarly journal reviews. Works published by non-academic government entities are excluded.\nThis bibliography is restricted to history.\nCitation style\nThis bibliography uses APA style citations. Entries do not use templates. References to reviews and notes for entries do use citation templates. Where books which are only partially related to Soviet history are listed, the titles for chapters or sections should be indicated if possible, meaningful, and not excessive.\nIf a work has been translated into English, the translator should be included and a footnote with appropriate bibliographic information for the original language version should be included.\nWhen listing works with titles or names published with alternative English spellings, the form used in the latest published version should be used and the version and relevant bibliographic information noted if it previously was published or reviewed under a different title.\nOverviews of Russian history\nGeneral surveys of Soviet history\nThese works contain significant overviews of the Revolution and Civil War era.\n* Figes, O.
