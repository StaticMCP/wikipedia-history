Featuring original score composed by Spanish composer Alberto Iglesias, and produced by Harry Gregson-Williams, who also composed additional music, the score was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London.\nReception\nTimothy Monger of AllMusic wrote \"Iglesias has always brought a classy romanticism to his work and it's highly entertaining to hear him pull out all the stops and work in such a grandiose style\". James Southall of Movie Wave described it as \"enjoyable\" as he felt that \"parts of it rise above the generic and have something to offer the more discerning listener\". Pete Simons of Synchrotones commented it as \"a surprisingly coherent score with plenty of highlights\".\nJustin Chang of Variety and Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter complimented the score as \"vigorous\" and \"overly bombastic\". Drew Taylor of IndieWire called that Iglesias' \"histronic\" score pumps up to \"nearly ear-splitting levels\". Catherine Shoard of The Guardian panned the score saying it as \"horrendous\" and it \"serves to neuter even the most human moments\".\nThe score was shortlisted as one among the 114 contenders for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for the 87th Academy Awards but was not nominated.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from CD liner notes:\n; Album credits\n* Composer – Alberto Iglesias\n* Producer – Alberto Iglesias, Vanessa Garde\n* Additional music – Federico Jusid, Harry Gregson-Williams\n* Recording, mixing and mastering – Jose Luis Crespo\n* Additional mixing – Geoff Foster, Kirsty Whalley, Peter Cobbin\n* Arrangements and programming – Vanessa Garde\n* Engineer – George Oulton, Stefano Civetta, Kirsty Whalley, Peter Cobbin\n* Assistant engineer – John Alexander, John Barrett, Lewis Jones, Manuel Pájaro, Nicolas Tsabertidis, Santiago Quizhpe\n* Music co-ordinator – Ana Eusa\n* Design – WLP Ltd.\n; Performer credits\n* Conductor – Nicholas Dodd\n* Orchestration – Nicholas Dodd, Alistair King\n* Assistant orchestration – Connor Hutton, Greg Hooper\n* Orchestra leader – John Bradbury, Perry Montague-Mason\n* Contractor – Isobel Griffiths\n* Additional contractor – Jo Changer\n* Choir – London Voices\n* Choir director – Ben Perry, Terry Edwards\n* Cello – Dragos Balan, Javier Romero, Jonathan Williams\n* Ethnic percussion – Dimitris Psonis, Haïg Sarikouyoumdjian, Helen Greenwood, Jan Hendrickse, Javier Paxariño, Stuart Hall\nReferences"
