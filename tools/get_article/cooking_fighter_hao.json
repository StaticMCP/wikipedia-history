The fighting is done by cooking with several materials around the battlefield.\nGameplay\nBattles take place in an overhead screen, the characters being represented by super deformed characters. Each level has a type of animal (chicken, crab, etc.) which must be beaten with a weapon and then turned into a meal. Vegetables are strewn across the battle field that can be thrown into the meat to create a different meal and different methods of cooking can be used, thus creating a wide variety of combinations. The winner is determined by who gets the most points after the meals are cooked.\nStory Mode lets the player use Hao as he battles different chefs. Free Mode allows the player choose between eleven different chefs and a second player can join.\nReferences"
