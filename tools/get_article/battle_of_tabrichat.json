The attack failed, and the CMA was forced to retreat.\nBattle\nPlatform forces launched an attack on MAA fighters in Tabrichat at 12:42am on January 28. GATIA claimed that seven of their vehicles attacked Tabrichat, killing eight MAA fighters and destroying two of their vehicles, with no personnel or material losses for GATIA. However, the CMA disputed this version of events, claiming that eight to nine men attacked their camp. Six or seven of those were killed in the attack, including four suicide bombers. The CMA admitted the deaths of six of their fighters and the destruction of two vehicles. They also claimed that an Algerian national was among the attackers, and that the prisoners captured by GATIA were Fulani Malians.\nThe CMA then accused GATIA of working with narco-terrorists. GATIA denied their usage of suicide bombings during the attack, although Western and United Nations observers stated that suicide bombers were embedded in GATIA. MINUSMA confirmed the details of the attack, but did not give a casualty assessment.\nClashes resumed on February 4 in Tabrichat, with both GATIA and the CMA claiming victory. GATIA claimed the capture of Tabrichat, and the deaths of ten MNLA fighters and four prisoners, along with no GATIA casualties.\nReferences"
