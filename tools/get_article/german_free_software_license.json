This makes the license easily acceptable to German authorities. The D-FSL is available in German and in English. Both versions are equally binding.\nGerman court ruled in 2006 that the GNU GPL was indeed enforceable.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  [https://www.hbz-nrw.de/produkte/open-access/lizenzen/dfsl/german-free-software-license German Free Software License in english]"
