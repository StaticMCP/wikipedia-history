Between 8 April and 6 June, the Soviet Army launched the first Jassy–Kishinev offensive, so named after two major cities Iași (Jassy) and Chișinău (Kishinev) in the area. A series of military engagements took place, with the objective of cutting off vital Axis defensive lines in Northern Romania, thus facilitating a subsequent advance by the Red Army into the entire Balkan region. Soviet forces failed to overcome German and Romanian defenses in the region. According to Glantz, the offensive operation ultimately failed, mainly due to the poor combat performance of Soviet troops and the effectiveness of German defensive preparations.\nThe major attack of the Battle of Romania – the second Jassy–Kishinev offensive, between 20 August and 29 August – was a Soviet victory. The German Sixth Army was encircled by the initial Soviet onslaught and was destroyed for the second time (the first time was at the Battle of Stalingrad).\nOn 23 August, King Michael of Romania led a coup d'état against Prime Minister Ion Antonescu; the new government surrendered to the Allies and declared war on Germany. Romanian historian Florin Constantiniu claims this shortened World War II in Europe by six months.\nThe Axis front collapsed. In the north, the German Eighth Army retreated to Hungary with heavy losses. Elsewhere, many German forces were cut off and captured, such as the large security and anti-aircraft force posted at the Ploiești oil field. Other fragments of the German forces fled toward Hungary as best they could, fighting the Soviets and the recently defected Romanians, which stormed through the Carpathian Mountains. (Several passes through the mountains were held by Romanian troops.)\nThe Soviet victory in Romania caused Bulgaria to withdraw from the Axis on 26 August, and allowed Soviet forces to invade it on 8 September.\nBy 24 September, nearly all of Romania was under Soviet control.\nRomania's defect initiated a collapse of many countries on the eastern front.\nThe Soviet forces, now able to move through Romanian territory without opposition, captured nearly 120,000 Romanian soldiers (POW's) and sent them to concentration camps inside the Soviet Union where most perished through labor work or malnutrition.\nThe German forces meanwhile regrouped in Hungary with the aid of Hungarian forces using high ground positions on the hills of Buda in Budapest.\nIt was at this time Hitler declared the Hungarian city of Budapest a Fortress city, and to be defended at all costs.\nThe German and Hungarian forces stood their ground fighting relentlessly even door to door as the Soviet forces continued entering the city.\nReferences\nfi:Romanian taistelu"
