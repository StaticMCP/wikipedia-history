He is on the faculty at Peabody Institute Conservatory of Music and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.\nBiography\nWarren Wolf was born in November of 1979 to Warren Wolf Sr. and Celeste Wolf. Wolf began his music studies at the age of three, learning the vibraphone, marimba, drums, and piano.  A classically trained musician, he attended the Peabody Institute's preparatory program for eight years.  He graduated with honors from the Baltimore School for the Arts in 1997.\nHe went to Berklee College of Music in 1997, graduating in 2001. At Berklee, he studied under jazz vibraphonist Dave Samuels for seven of eight semesters, the remaining semester being spent receiving instruction from vibraphonist Ed Saindon. During his time at Berklee, Wolf was an active member of Boston's jazz scene, playing the vibraphone, drums, and piano, and with his friend, trumpeter Jason Palmer he co-led a group at Wally's Cafe, the legendary Boston jazz venue, where he worked as house drummer. During his time at Berklee, he collaborated with musicians in school such as Jeremy Pelt, Jaleel Shaw, Rashawn Ross, Walter Smith III, Kendrick Scott and John Mayer. He remained active on the Boston jazz scene as a local musician and in September 2003, Wolf became an instructor in the percussion department at the Berklee College of Music. At Berklee, he gave private lessons on the vibraphone and drums, and taught a beginners' keyboard class for entering freshmen majoring in drum performance.\nSince leaving Berklee in 2005 for Baltimore, Wolf has been active on the international jazz scene, touring with Bobby Watson's \"Live and Learn\" Sextet, Karriem Riggins' \"Virtuoso Experience\", Donal Fox's Scarlatti Jazz Suite Project, Christian McBride & \"Inside Straight\", and with his own group of young musicians, \"Wolfpack\". He is also a member of the Aaron Diehl Quartet and the SFJAZZ Collective. His reputation as a gifted jazz lion is acknowledged by respected jazz critics such as the New York Times′s Ben Ratliff, who favorably reviewed Wolf's performance of November 16, 2011, at the 92nd Street Y's 92YTribeca venue, a performance that was featured by NPR with a 60-minute video on its website.\nWolf has made several recordings as a leader and a sideman. His recent effort, the eponymous Warren Wolf (2011), features Christian McBride on bass, Peter Martin on piano, Greg Hutchinson on drums, Tim Green on alto and soprano saxophones, and Jeremy Pelt on trumpet. In the New York Daily News on October 15, 2011, Greg Thomas wrote of the CD: \"To say that Warren Wolf's Mack Avenue debut is auspicious would be an understatement. No doubt, this is one of the best of the year in jazz.\" Wolf's other notable recordings as a leader are Incredible Jazz Vibes (M & I, 2005) (featuring Mulgrew Miller on piano, Vicente Archer on bass, and Kendrick Scott on drums), and Black Wolf (M & I, 2009) (again featuring Mulgrew Miller on piano, with Rodney Whitaker on bass, and Jeff \"Tain\" Watts on drums). He recorded the solo vibraphone and marimba album Life (J.M.I. 2025) on tape at Reservoir Studios on March 11, 2023.\nDiscography\nAs leader\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Title !!
