Sources published during the regnal year 40 Vict refer to this session as 40 Vict, because, at that time, it was not known when the session would end. This session opened on 8 February 1877.\nDuring the year 1877 and the session 40 & 41 Vict, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed 69 public general acts; 40 public acts of a local character, which were placed amongst the local and personal acts; 242 local acts; 11 private acts printed by the Queen's Printer; and 4 private acts not printed.\nThe number shown after each act's short title or popular title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held.\nMost of these acts have a short title. Some of these acts have never had a short title. Some of these acts have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\nPublic general acts\n*Annual Turnpike Acts Continuance Act 1877 c. 64 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1898 (61 & 62 Vict. c. 22)\n*Appropriation Act 1877 c. 61 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1883 (46 & 47 Vict. c. 39)\n*Beer Licences Regulation (Ireland) Act 1877 c. 4\n*Board of Education (Scotland) Act 1877 c. 38.
