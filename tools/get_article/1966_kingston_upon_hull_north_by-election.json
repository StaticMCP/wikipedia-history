The seat was retained with an increased majority by Kevin McNamara of the Labour Party. This has been attributed to the announcement of the construction of the Humber Bridge by the government during the campaign.\nPrevious result\n}}\nResult\nAftermath\nHarold Wilson's Labour Party formed a government after winning a majority of four seats at the 1964 general election. Shortly after this by-election, Wilson called a general election for 31 March. Wilson's hope that he would be returned to office with a larger majority had been encouraged by the government's victory at the Kingston upon Hull North by-election. In the end, Wilson's decision was vindicated, as Labour was returned with a larger majority of 96 seats.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Sophie Roberts, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13619462.2018.1503958 \"The campaign of the 'red-bearded radical': Richard Gott and the Hull North by-election, 1966\"], Contemporary British History, vol. 32, issue 3 (2018), pp.&nbsp;336–358.\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081011200923/http://www.geocities.com/by_elections/65.html Full result]\n*[https://archive.today/20240524143922/https://www.webcitation.org/5knRvWMkw?url=http://www.geocities.com/byelections64/hull66/gott.html Election literature for Radical Alliance]"
