The war took place in Oman, the Persian Gulf, and southern Iraq, as Wahhabi forces sought to expand their influence. While Wahhabi forces achieved significant victories, including control over Oman and parts of southern Iraq, the Qajars retained critical territories, including Bahrain and Muscat, through successful sieges."
