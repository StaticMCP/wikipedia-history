The insurgents commanded by General Vicente Guerrero were defeated by the royalist forces; Guerrero, being threatened by the royalist forces that wanted to capture him, managed to save himself by jumping off a cliff and hiding in the mountain range of the present state that bears his name.\nReferences"
