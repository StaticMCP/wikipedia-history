The following summer, he moved to Scotland to join Aberdeen, who had just been elected to join an expanded Scottish Football League First Division.\nWard spent two seasons at Pittodrie, in both of which the \"Dons\" finished 12th in the league. He then returned to England in 1907, to join Bradford Park Avenue who, despite being based in Yorkshire, had been elected to join the Southern League. The following summer, he returned to the south coast to join another Southern League club, Southampton.\nHe joined the \"Saints\" 1908 summer tour of Europe; at Leipzig, in the final match of the tour, Ward displaced the cartilage of his right knee. On his return to England, he underwent three operations on his knee in an effort to repair the injury. By January 1909, he had recovered sufficiently to make his league debut in place of Frank Jefferis, when he scored the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Brentford. Still troubled with his knee, he only managed three further first-team matches before deciding to retire in the summer of 1909.\nWard died in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, in August 1926.\nReferences"
