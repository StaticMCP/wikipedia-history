The album was the band's first regular release to be recorded under the second line-up, featuring members Goo Hara and Kang Jiyoung, who replaced Kim Sunghee after her withdrawal in 2008. The album was released in Japan on February 23, 2011.\nBackground and promotion\n\"Same Heart\" was used in a mobile game called \"i-Musician\". It was first released on June 2, 2009, and was later included on the album Revolution.\nThe lead single \"Wanna\" was released on July 28, 2009, ahead of the album's official release. The music video was released on July 29, with the full album being available on July 30. Promotional activities commenced on July 31, beginning with KBS's Music Bank; the group performed both \"Wanna\" and \"Mister\". On August 30, 2009, \"Wanna\" won the \"Mutizen Song\" award from SBS's Inkigayo music program.\n\"Mister\" proved to be popular with viewers due to a \"butt dance\" that is featured prominently in the choreography. Due to the overwhelming response that \"Mister\" received, Kara's overall popularity increased, with numerous advertisement requests coming in for the group; they had more advertisements in October 2009 than the previous two years.\nCommercial performance\nThe Gaon Music Chart was launched in February 2010 as the official chart for South Korea. The album entered at number 37 on the Gaon Album Chart for the second week of 2010 and peaked at number 3 for the week ending June 26, 2010.
