The story focuses on side characters from the animated television series Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live, which aired from 2013 to 2014.\nInitially released in 14 theaters on January 9, 2016, the film's unexpected popularity led to nationwide screenings of the film and became a financial success, which led to a spin-off multimedia franchise focusing on the characters. In addition, a stage play adaptation of the film titled King of Prism: Over the Sunshine! took place in 2017. King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm also led the \"cheer screenings\" movement in modern cinema. The film was followed up by a sequel, King of Prism: Pride the Hero, in 2017, and a third continuation, King of Prism: Shiny Seven Stars, in 2019.\nPlot\nThe Pretty Rhythm series focuses Prism Stars, idols performing figure skating routines through song and dance with special moves known as Prism Jumps. The characters participate in Prism Shows, live performances that are scored based on how charmed the audience is. The plot is set 1.5 years after Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live.\nAfter Louis Kisaragi gives him a locket and instructs him to attend  Over the Rainbow's Prism Show, Shin Ichijo is starstruck from the experience. While Shin bikes home, Hijiri Himuro, noticing his sparkle, sees potential in him and scouts him to become a Prism Star trainee at Edel Rose Academy. Shin becomes acquainted with his classmates but learns that Edel Rose Academy has only nine students after the death of the previous chairman, Kou Norizuki, and most of the school's funds and students have transferred over to Schwarz Rose, run by Jin Norizuki.\nShin meets the members of Over the Rainbow: Koji Mihama, Hiro Hayami, and Kazuki Nishina. The three share how they were able to perform well based on their friendship, recounting the setbacks they faced in Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live. That afternoon, Shin encounters Louis and thanks him for inspiring him to become a Prism Star, but Louis only responds by formally introducing himself and embracing him. At night, Hijiri becomes suspicious of Jin's next move, revealing that the members of Happy RAIN and Bell Rose were able to escape Jin's management during his takeover. However, Koji is offered an opportunity to produce music for a Hollywood movie production to pay off Edel Rose's debt. Hiro, on the other hand, decides to focus on the next Prism King Cup tournament.\nWhile Kazuki is practicing, he is accosted by Taiga Kougami and Alexander Yamato for abandoning street-style Prism Shows to perform academy-style Prism Shows. Alexander challenges Kazuki, and the two battle to \"EZ Do Dance\" with Kakeru Juuouin's battle mode technology, the Prism System, but the duel ends in a draw. Meanwhile, Koji helps Shin practice for Prism Shows, and, impressed by his ability, gives him the song \"Over the Sunshine!\" as a reward.\nAfter Koji accepts his new job abroad, Over the Rainbow perform a farewell concert. With Over the Rainbow now disbanded and Edel Rose's future uncertain, the other students are distraught. However, with encouragement from Hijiri and Koji, Shin performs \"Over the Sunshine!\" with Hiro and Kazuki, which reminds the students and the audience of the excitement they experienced when they first watched a Prism Show. The Prism Show becomes successful, and Edel Rose is determined to continue. Meanwhile, at Schwarz Rose, Jin rallies his students, one of them revealed to be Louis, to defeat Edel Rose at any cost.\nThe post-credits scene features a preview for a proposed continuation, where in the midst of preparations for the next Prism King Cup tournament, Hiro learns that he is unable to perform \"Pride\" now that the song has been given to Louis.\nCast\n* Tetsuya Kakihara - Koji Mihama\n* Tomoaki Maeno - Hiro Hayami\n* Toshiki Masuda - Kazuki Nishina\n* Junta Terashima - Shin Ichijo\n* Soma Saito - Yukinojo Tachibana\n* Tasuku Hatanaka - Taiga Kougami\n* Taku Yashiro - Kakeru Juuouin\n* Takuma Nagatsuka - Leo Saionji\n* Masashi Igarashi - Minato Takahashi\n* Yuma Uchida - Yu Suzuno\n* Shouta Aoi - Louis Kisaragi\n* Shunsuke Takeuchi - Alexander Yamato\n* Toshihiko Seki - Hijiri Himuro\n* Daisuke Namikawa - Ryo Yamada\n* Showtaro Morikubo - Rei Kurokawa\n* Shinichiro Miki - Jin Norizuki\nProduction\nPretty Rhythm director Masakazu Hishida had stressed the importance of the male characters of Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live, and with them debuting as Over the Rainbow in the final episode, Hiroko Nishi and Takeshi Yoda had wanted to develop a late-night 13-episode television series that would focus on them, but their original plan was rejected. When it was reworked into a film, it was rejected again, and the staff were told that if they were able to provide evidence that the project would work out, then it would be approved. From 2014 onward, the staff continued to promote various Pretty Rhythm and PriPara series at events, occasionally teasing Over the Rainbow's comeback to test the fans' feedback. When the full version of Over the Rainbow's theme song, \"Athletic Core\", received positive feedback, a character song album centered on them was produced. In 2015, Over the Rainbow appeared in the movie Gekijō-ban PriPara: Minna Atsumare! Prism Tours if the audience chose to view route 4, which ended with a teaser for their comeback. The film was financially successful, with fans attending the cheer screenings multiple times with glowsticks. Avex Group finally approved the film project after attending the cheer screenings.\nOver the Rainbow's comeback was later confirmed at an Edel Rose event in 2015, where a VTR clip show announced that they would return in a film project in 2016 titled King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm. Staff from previous Pretty Rhythm projects returned for the film, including Hishida, Pretty Rhythm: Rainbow Live CG director Yoshihiro Otobe, and character designer Mai Matsuura.\nDuring a live stream on December 22, 2015, Hishida addressed criticisms about the Pretty Rhythm series and revealed that the film project was given limited time and budget, leading the staff had debated how much of the story they could fit in 60 minutes. He mentioned that despite the focus on the Prism King Cup, the film would end before the characters even attended the tournament. At the time, a sequel to the film was not planned due to the uncertainty of King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm's financial success, and the post-credits preview was added to suggest what would happen if they were to create a sequel.\nThe film was released in Japan on January 9, 2016. 4DX theater screenings were available in 26 theaters on June 18, 2016. King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm was screened for 100 days in South Korea, with over 90,000 people in total attendance. The Los Angeles Film Festival screened the film on September 16, 2017.\nReception\nInitial box office revenue for King of Prism by Pretty Rhythm was poor, and there were considerations of ending the screenings after its second week.
