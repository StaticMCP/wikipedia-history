Colonel Bibikov's detachment, assembled at Honkajärvi on 5 September, was tasked with pushing toward the Swedish outpost at Ömossa, held by 500 men from the Uppland Regiment and 2 guns, all under Lieutenant Colonel Thure Drufva, who was ordered to fight till the last man.\nBattle\nOn 6 September 1808, Bibikov's detachment of five companies attacked the Swedish outpost at Ömossa. Despite initial resistance, Drufva's 2 cannons could not be effectively placed against Russian artillery, and both flanks came under heavy pressure. The Swedes withdrew to higher ground north of the village, where fighting resumed. Russian infantry attempted to outflank the position in rough terrain, while repeated frontal attacks by Cossacks were repelled with canister fire from the Swedish cannons under Vilhelm von Schwerin. Threatened with encirclement, Drufva ordered a retreat toward Träskvik, pursued by Russian cavalry.\nAftermath\nEarly in the morning, Drufva reached Träskvik and was reinforced by 100 men, after which the Russian pursuit ceased.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*"
