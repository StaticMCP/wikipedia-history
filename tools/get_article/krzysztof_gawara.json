In 1983, he joined Ruch Chorzów, with whom he made his Ekstraklasa debut. After several seasons spent in Silesia, he moved to Legia Warsaw. Since 1988, he has played abroad, first in the Polonia Club of Sydney, then for Finnish sides FF Jaro and Tampereen Pallo-Veikot, where in 1994 he won the league title in 1994, before finishing his career at EuPa Eura.\nCoaching career\nAfter returning from Finland, he began working as a coach. He was first in charge of Wicher Kobyłka, before returning to Legia. He spent the next few years switching between the senior and reserve teams' technical staffs. After Franciszek Smuda was dismissed in March 2001, Gawara was appointed temporary manager of Legia, after which he became assistant under Dragomir Okuka. After two more years in charge of Legia's second team, he joined Dariusz Kubicki's staff at the senior technical staff as the assistant. After Kubicki resigned in the autumn of 2004, he became part of a temporary trio of trainers, alongside Lucjan Brychczy and Jacek Zieliński. Shortly after, after the latter was appointed on permanent basis, Gawara became his assistant. In the summer of 2006, Gawara left Legia to manage Huragan Wołomin.\nHonours\nTampereen Pallo-Veikot\n* Veikkausliiga: 1994\nExternal links\n* [http://www.legia.net/historia/index.php?s=zawodnik&id=99 Profile on legia.net]\n*"
