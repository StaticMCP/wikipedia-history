      "text": "# List of Fleet Air Arm aircraft in World War II\n\nThis list deals specifically with aircraft of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm (FAA) during World War II.\nThe FAA operated aircraft from Royal Navy ships, mainly aircraft carriers but also including capital ships and cruisers, as well as from land bases defending ports and attacking enemy shipping.\nCarrier aircraft of World War II\nFighters\n;Gloster Sea Gladiator\n:Carrier-borne version of the Gladiator fitted with an arrestor hook. One of the two FAA fighters of World War II in service at the beginning alongside the Blackburn Skua.\n;Blackburn Skua\n: The Skua was a fighter and a dive bomber; one of two fighter aircraft in the FAA at the onset of war, alongside the Gloster Sea Gladiator.  Armed with four fixed forward-firing machine-guns in the wings and a single flexibly-mounted Vickers K machine gun in the rear cockpit, the Skua carried a large bomb launched from a swivelling crutch under the centre fuselage.\n;Blackburn Roc\n:The Roc was the turret-armed escort-fighter derived from the Skua, fitted with a four-gun hydraulically-operated turret aft of the cockpit, similar to the Boulton Paul Defiant. The Roc was not procured in large numbers, due to low speed.\n;Fairey Fulmar\n:The Fulmar fighter/reconnaissance aircraft was introduced into service in May 1940 and was the first FAA fighter to have eight machine-guns and also had carried a Navigator/Observer/Gunner to assist the pilot with navigation, reconnaissance and defence.\n;Hawker Sea Hurricane\n:Carrier-borne and catapult-ship variants of the Hurricane introduced to service in 1941. All Sea Hurricanes, apart from the IA, were carrier-capable, being fitted with arrestor hooks.\n;Grumman Martlet (later Wildcat)\n:The Martlet was a carrier fighter, armed with four 0.5 inch M2 Browning heavy machine guns, in widespread use from September 1941. The Martlet was the British name for Grumman G-36A and G-36B aircraft in British service. Later in the war new acquisitions (FM-1 and FM-2) used the US Wildcat name.\n; Supermarine Spitfire\n:The Spitfire was used by land-based squadrons.\n; Supermarine Seafire\n:A navalised version of the Spitfire which entered service in November 1942.\n;Vought F4U Corsair\n:The Corsair was used by the FAA from November 1943, with modifications to suit them to service on British carriers.\n; Grumman Hellcat\n:Hellcat was a more developed aircraft than Wildcat, armed with six 0.5 inch  M2 Browning heavy machine guns. It entered widespread service with FAA in early 1944 under the US Hellcat name. Was used  in both Europe and the Mediterranean.\n;Fairey Firefly\n:The Firefly was the last FAA carrier-fighter put into service in World War II, in July 1944, as a reconnaissance and strike fighter.\nFile:Gloster Sea Gladiator Gloster Sea Gladiator N5903 Fleet Air Air Museum Yeovilton 1984 (17146572052).jpg|Gloster Sea Gladiator\nFile:15 Blackburn Skua, Bristol Perseus (15650612347).jpg|Blackburn Skua\nFile:15 Blackburn Roc Bristol Perseus Engine (15650907050).jpg|Blackburn Roc\nFile:Fairey Fulmar Mk I in twin formation over the sea.jpg|Fairey Fulmar\nFile:Hawker Sea Hurricane Ib ‘Z7015 - 7-L’ (G-BKTH) (20625605982).jpg|Hawker Sea Hurricane IB.\nFile:Grumman F4F Martlet Wildcat Duxford 2008.JPG|FAA Grumman Wildcat/Martlet\nFile:A Supermarine Seafire landing on board HMS ILLUSTRIOUS, February 1943.

It also was designed for reconnaissance/spotting and later in the war it was replaced in the frontline torpedo role and given anti-submarine duties from escort carriers.\nFairey Albacore\nThe Fairey Albacore was intended as a replacement for the Swordfish fulfilling the same roles with an improved engine and enclosed cabin. Went into service in 1940-1943 but was replaced by the Barracuda before the end of the war.\nFairey Barracuda\nAn all metal monoplane torpedo-bomber/dive bomber, the Barracude was the last British torpedo bomber to enter service during the war, serving from January 1943.\nGrumman Avenger\nThis aircraft came into service by the FAA in November 1943. Was originally called Tarpon but was changed to Avenger when the FAA changed to using the US names.\nDive bombers\n]]\nAll FAA torpedo bombers except the Grumman Avenger could also act as dive bombers\n;Blackburn Skua\nCombined fighter and dive bomber -the Skua could carry a single 250lb or 500 lb. bomb under the fuselage and four 40lb bombs or eight 20lb Cooper bombs under the wings.\n;Vought Chesapeake\nThe British took over French order for 50 Vought Vindicators after the Battle of France. Modified for British requirements, they were given the service name \"Chesapeake\". After brief service with 811 Naval Air Squadron in 1941 they were withdrawn from frontline and used for training.\nReconnaissance\nReconnaissance came from planes that had been designed to undertake this role as well as an offensive role such as a fighter or bomber:\n;Fairey Swordfish\n:When carried, the observer was the third crewmember in addition to the pilot and \"Telegraphist/Air gunner\"\n;Fairey Albacore\n:The Albacore was designed as a torpedo/bomber/reconnaissance aircraft. For reconnaissance operations, a third crewmember was carried.\n;Fairey Fulmar\n:Introduced in 1940.\n;Fairey Firefly\n:The successor to the Fairey Fulmar entering service in 1944 initially for armed reconnaissance flights and anti-shipping strikes. The observer was seated in the rear of the fuselage.\nAnti-submarine\n;Fairey Swordfish\n:The Swordfish in later life served as anti-submarine aircraft operating off escort carriers in convoys. To fulfill this role the Swordfish Mark II was fitted with  ASV Mark II radar, the first instance of a carrier aircraft equipped with air-to-surface-vessel (ASV) radar, and RP-3 rockets. The Swordfish Kk III received the more advanced centimetric ASV Mk XI radar. This was used to destroy German midget submarine.\nFile:Swordfish Mk2 LS326 1988.jpeg|Swordfish mk II in flight with torpedo\nFile:Fairey Swordfish III ‘NF370 - NH-L’ (25339752137).jpg|the AS/V radar on the Swordfish was fitted below the fuselage\nOther\n;Hawker Osprey\nTraining after withdrawal as carrier fighter.\nNon-carrier shipborne aircraft\nFighters\nSea Hurricane IA\nThe Sea Hurricane mk IA was a catapult only aircraft that was carried and launched from CAM ships. These ships only had the facilities to launch the aircraft so that if no land bases were available nearby the pilot was forced to ditch the aircraft in the sea when fuel ran out.\nReconnaissance & ship artillery spotters\nafter reconnaissance flight in 1941]]\nFairey Swordfish\nThe Fairey Swordfish was deployed from normal Royal Navy ships with floats through an aircraft catapult on board the ship in order to do recon or act as an artillery spotter for the ship. Artillery spotting involved the Swordfish tracking the fall of shot from its ship and relaying back where it landed to help its ship make adjustments to their guns aim to be more accurate.\n;Supermarine Walrus\nThe Supermarine Walrus was a seaplane designed to be operated off battleships and cruiser for reconnaissance and as a spotter for the main armament. There were only two occasions on which it was used as a spotter but it was used for reconnaissance and air sea rescue  throughout the war. With improvements in radar it was removed from some of the capital ships as it was rendered obsolete in its other role in patrolling for axis subs with ASV radar\nLand-based aircraft\nTorpedo bombers\n;Bristol Beaufort\nThe Beaufort was derived from a medium bomber and was used by the Fleet Air Arm from 1940 until the end of the war. The Beauforts operated could use both torpedoes and bombs and lay naval mines.\nBristol Beaufighter\nThe Bristol Beaufighter was an interim heavy fighter based on the Bristol Beaufort. It was used for attacks on Axis shipping by FAA and RAF Coastal Command. The main variant used by the FAA was the Beaufighter Mk X as used by 772 Naval Air Squadron and 728 Naval Air Squadron. In addition to the four 20mm Hispano Mk.II  autocannons they carried, they were armed with either eight RP-3 rockets or a single torpedo. They were equipped with ASV radar.\nOther\n;Armstrong Whitworth Whitley\n:Small number used for training in Merlin engine management\n;Miles Martinet\n:Target tug\nSee also\n*List of aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm\nNotes\nReferences\n*\n*\n*"
