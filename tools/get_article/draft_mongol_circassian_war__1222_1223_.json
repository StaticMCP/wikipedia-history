Its ruler, Muhammad II of Khwarazm, succumbed to disease on an island in the Caspian Sea, leaving his son, Jalal al-Din Mangburni landless.\nRavaging through Persia, the Mongol army arrived in modern-day Azerbaijan, where it sacked several cities, until it travelled to the Mughan plain, where they rested and also got reinforced by Kurdish and Turcoman freebooters, who offered their services to the Mongols.\nAt the beginning of 1221, the Mongols launched a campaign into Georgia but were driven back by the 10,000 strong Georgian army, forcing them to retreat. A month later, the army travelled to Azerbaijan, besieged Maragheh, besieged and eventually captured the city.\nAt the end of 1221, the Mongols advanced into Georgia once again. The reinforced Mongol army counted around 30,000 and destroyed the Georgian army, resulting in its retreat and the devastation of southern Georgia by the Mongols.\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
