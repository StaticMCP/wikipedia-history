Minnesota State Highway 313 on the American side joins Manitoba Highway 12 on the Canadian side. The crossing is:\n*on ''MOM's Way'' between Thunder Bay, Ontario and Ste. Anne, Manitoba.\n*the easternmost along the  part of the international border that follows the 49th parallel north between the Salish Sea on the Pacific Coast and the Lake of the Woods.\n*used for travel between Northwest Angle and Minnesota proper. A school bus makes this journey twice daily.\nThe adjacent Canadian National Railway track across the border, which links eastward to Rainy River, Ontario, is isolated from other US trackage.\nCanadian side\nIn 1901, the customs office opened under the administrative oversight of the Port of Winnipeg. In 1925, a new building was erected at Sprague.\nThe customs building was replaced in 1973.\nUS side\nThe Border Patrol Station was established around 1924, closed during World War II, and reopened in 1955.\nWhile on patrol near Roseau in 1928, Robert H. Lobdell, a Warroad officer, was fatally shot by an individual who had illegally entered the US.\nThe Warroad border station, which was built in 1962, was replaced by a new facility in 2010. About  south of the previous station, the new complex employs advanced technologies and includes two high low booths, two commercial truck docks and two enclosed passenger vehicle bays for detailed inspections.\nDuring the 2020/21 and 2021/22 winters, an ice road was built over the frozen lake to connect Northwest Angle with the rest of Minnesota.\nIn 2022, the highway south to Roseau was designated the Richard K. Magnuson Deputy Memorial Highway in memory of the deputy sheriff who intercepted border runner Gregory McMaster in 1978. McMaster fatally shot Magnuson, the final victim of the serial killer.\nTraffic volumes\nDuring earlier decades, passenger trains created much of the customs work. To expedite inspections, Canadian and US customs officers processed passengers while the trains were en route. In 1930, US officers Laurence E. Doten and Lawrence C. Jones were fatally shot in the line of the duty on a westbound passenger train.\nThe significant rail freight includes seasonal grain harvests. In later decades, highway traffic became the primary customs activity.\nSee also\n* List of Canada–United States border crossings\nReferences"
