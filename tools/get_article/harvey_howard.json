Also while at Leeds, in 1995 he won his first international cap for England against Wales.\nAustralia\nDuring his time with the Western Suburbs Magpies on the playing roster, he gained several nicknames, including Harves and Harvester, freight, but also mainly as Night Train. This was because of a song at the time which he insisted the whole team listen to a song called \"Night Train\". In 1997, he played for the 'Rest of the World' against Australia. In 1998, Howard briefly returned to England, signing a short-term contract with Bradford Bulls.

Howard played in Western Suburbs final ever game in the NRL as a stand-alone entity which was a 60-16 loss against the Auckland Warriors at Campbelltown Stadium. Howard could not win a place in the joint team, Wests Tigers but Wayne Bennett had no such concern, using Howard as a stop-gap  and bringing him off the bench in the Broncos' 2000 NRL Grand Final win over the Sydney Roosters. After that Howard represented England in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup, also mostly from the interchange bench.\nLater career\nHe played  for the Wigan Warriors in the 2001 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Bradford Bulls. He went on to play for Hull Kingston Rovers, but was forced to retire in 2004 after being injured in a car crash.\nPost playing\nHarvey returned to Australia on a permanent basis, and now works full-time for the Western Suburbs Magpies DRLFC as Development officer, in charge of the junior grades of football, as well as the Junior Magpies development teams.\nHoward was appointed Hull Kingston Rovers' first team coach in late 2004.
