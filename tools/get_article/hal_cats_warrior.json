The aircraft is a part of the Combat Air Teaming System (CATS) programme undertaken by a Public Private Partnership (PPP) between the HAL and NewSpace Research and Technologies (NRT), an Indian private startup. In Aero India 2021, a scaled-down mock-up was presented for the first time. In Aero India 2025, a CATS Warrior prototype was displayed by HAL.\nDevelopment\nCATS Warrior is being developed as an autonomous wingman drone also capable of taking off and landing on land and at sea from an aircraft carrier. It will team up with existing and future fighter aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) including Tejas, AMCA, TEDBF, Su-30MKI and Jaguar which will act as its mothership. The CATS Warrior is primarily envisioned for the IAF's use and a similar, smaller version could be designed for the Indian Navy. It will be controlled by the mothership and accomplish tasks such as scouting, absorbing enemy fire, attacking the targets if necessary with its internal and external pylons weapons or sacrifice itself by crashing into the target.\nIt will fly back for mission within the combat radius of 350&nbsp;km and for long range mission with combat radius of 800 km it will sacrifice itself crashing into the target. As an unmanned asset, it can be directed towards a target and sacrificed in case it cannot be flown back to territory. \"''Warrior will serve as a 'sensor amplifier' for the LCA, flying out ahead of the manned aircraft and using its sensors to feed information back to LCA''\" HAL test pilot Group Captain H.V. Thakur (retd.).\nThe scale model of CATS Warrior was first unveiled at Aero India 2021. The Warrior scale model was accompanied by TEJAS-MAX cockpit which acted as a \"mothership\" for the CATS. HAL management approved an internal funding of  for the development as of February 2021. As per Arup Chatterjee, Director of HAL Engineering, Research & Development division the integration with CATS MAX mothership will take 1-2 years and first flights is scheduled for 2024-25.\nOn 11 January 2025, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) successfully conducted the engine ground run of a full-scale demonstrator of the aircraft. CATS Warrior is one of the flagship programmes of HAL. Multiple design changes has been brought up in the demonstrator as compared with the scale model, most importantly the air intake. The new design shifted from angular surfaces which prioritised stealth. A report stated that, instead, \"the aircraft uses RAM (Radar Absorbent Material) coatings and laminations with over 99% attenuation\". These changes were made to enhance the performance while still being low observable. The changes could also increase payload and efficiency.\nHAL displayed the prototype in Aero India 2025. The jet will undergo further ground testing, followed by taxi trials and first flight scheduled by the end of 2025.\nDesign\nIt has a composite structure with an internal weapon bay & hybrid design whose front section looks like MQ-28 Ghost Bat wingman & from its mid fuselage to its tail like XQ-58 Valkyrie.\nAvionics — It will be equipped with an electro-optic/infrared payload, Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, inertial navigational unit, and a jammer for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and combat operations. The prototype uses an indigenous Mission Computer from SLRDC.\nArmament — It can carry two new-generation short-range or beyond-visual-range air-to-air missiles externally, and two DRDO Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon (SAAW) internally in its internal weapon bay.\nPropulsion\nIt has a single serpentine air intake on the top of its fuselage that leads to its two engines.\nThe CATS Warrior employs two  HAL PTAE-W engines derived from the PTAE-7  engine developed by Aero Engine Research and Development Centre. The original variant of PTAE-7 is used on DRDO Lakshya target drone. The modified engine, designated PTAE-W, is a single-shaft, lightweight turbojet engine. The engine measures is 1.27 meters in length, 330 mm in diameter, and weighs 65 kg. The engine core includes a four-stage transonic axial compressor, single-stage turbine, annular flow combustion chamber, and 16 fuel flow burners. The engine variant also features a new FADEC system and an enhanced time between overhauls (TBO) of 1,000 hours with a thrust output of  and a specific fuel consumption of 1.15 kg/kg.f/hr.
