The province was much larger than the area traditionally called Phoenicia: for example, cities like Emesa and Palmyra and the base of the Legio III Gallica in Raphanaea were now subject to governor in Tyre. Veterans of this military unit were settled in Tyre, which also received the rank of colonia.\nBy creating the province of Phoenicia, Septimius Severus revived the Phoenician identity. His restoration of the ancient regional name seems to come from a deep pride in his own origin from the regions of Dido in Africa and his wife’s roots in Phoenicia.\nWar of Succession\nAfter the death of the 2nd century Roman emperor Commodus, a civil war erupted, in which Berytus, and Sidon supported Pescennius Niger. While the city of Tyre  supported Septimius Severus, which led Niger to send Mauri javelin men and archers to sack the city. However, Niger lost the civil war, and Septimius Severus decided to show his gratitude for Tyre's support by making it the capital of Phoenice. Berytus was permitted to maintain its status as a Roman colony but lost the territory of Heliopolis, which was established as a separate colony. Ulpian, a native of Tyre, states that the grant of colonial status to Heliopolis resulted from this civil war.\nPropraetorial Imperial Legates of Phoenicia\nThe early governors of Phoenice from the time of Septimius Severus are known mainly by inscriptions. The governors resided in Tyre.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"70%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#FFDEAD\"\n! width=\"9%\" | Date\n! width=\"39%\" | Propraetorial Imperial Legate (Governor)\n|-\n|193 – 194 || Ti.

An athlete from Aphrodisias in Caria, in 165 AD, recorded his victories, listing events in various Phoenician cities: the men’s pankration in Berytus, the men’s pankration in Tyre, and the men’s pankration in Hieropolis.\nWildlife conservation\nThe first attempt to conserve the Lebanese cedar was made during the 2nd century by the Roman emperor Hadrian; he created an imperial forest and ordered it marked by inscribed boundary stones, two of which are in the museum of the American University of Beirut. Material finds of this early type of wildlife conservation is provided by 200 inscriptions engraved on rocks all over the northern part of Mount Lebanon.\nArchitecture\nBased on literary evidence, by the early second century AD, Berytus featured various public structures, including halls, porticoes, temples, marketplaces, a theater, an amphitheater, and baths. The buildings and streets were decorated with statues and sculptures.\nFile:Bacchus temple in Baalbek.jpg|Temple of Bacchus, Baalbek.\nFile:Tyre Triumphal Arch.jpg|right|Triumphal arch of Tyre.\nFile:الملعب الروماني.jpg|The Tyre Hippodrome.\nFile:Lebanon, Baalbek, The Exedra around the Great Court, Roman Heliopolis.jpg|right|The Exedra around the Great Court, Roman Heliopolis.\n*2nd century CE Roman temple, Yanouh.\n*Temple of Bacchus, possibly during the reign of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius (r.
