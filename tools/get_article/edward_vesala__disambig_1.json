In the 1970s, he led his own jazz groups, a quartet with Polish trumpet player Tomasz Stańko and sax player Tomasz Szukalski, played with Toto Blanke's Electric Circus, and recorded with Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek.

Prominent players in Sound and Fury included saxophonists Jorma Tapio and Pepa Päivinen, guitarists Raoul Björkenheim and Jimi Sumén, and harpist and keyboardist Iro Haarla, who was Vesala's wife.\nVesala died from congestive heart failure in Yläne, Finland at the age of 54.\nDiscography\nAs leader or co-leader\n* Nan Madol (ECM, 1974)\n* Satu (ECM, 1977)\n* Open (FMP, 1979) with Gerd Dudek and Buschi Niebergall\n* Heavy Life (Leo, 1980)\n* Lumi (ECM, 1986)\n* Ode to the Death of Jazz (ECM, 1989)\n* Invisible Storm (ECM, 1991)\n* Nordic Gallery (ECM, 1994)\nAs sideman\nWith Jan Garbarek\n* Triptykon (ECM, 1973)\nWith Tomasz Stańko\n* TWET (Polish Jazz vol. 39) (Polskie Nagrania Muza, 1974)\n* Balladyna (ECM, 1976)\n* Live at Remont (Helicon, 1976)\n* Almost Green (Leo, 1978)\nWith Kenny Wheeler\n* Around 6 (ECM, 1979)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[ Allmusic Guide biography of Edward Vesala] by Chris Kelsey\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928120038/http://www.elokuvakontakti.fi/site/?page_id=9&lan=1&elokuva_id=192&laji=&list=nimi_up&bylang=&PHPSESSID=754affb6939e5934d7ab4ab0ffcc1f39 Eetu – 12 sessiota Edward Vesalan kanssa] Documentary film on Vesala and his work with Sound and Fury by Markus Viljanen (1994)\n*[http://www.jazzhouse.org/gone/lastpost2.php3?edit=945855592 Jazzhouse]"
