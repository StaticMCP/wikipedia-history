From November 4, 1902, to March 3, 1903, he served part of one term in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nLife\nHe was born on March 10, 1862, in Madison, Florida.\nSwann graduated from Columbia Law School in 1886, was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced practice in New York City. He entered politics as a member of Tammany Hall.\nCongress\nSwann was elected as a Democrat to the 57th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Amos J. Cummings and served from December 1, 1902, to March 3, 1903.\nCareer after Congress\nAfterwards he resumed the practice of law in New York City. In November 1904, Swann ran again for Congress, this time in the 13th District, but was defeated by Republican Herbert Parsons.\nIn November 1907, Swann was elected a judge of the Court of General Sessions, and took office on January 1, 1908. He was New York County District Attorney from 1916 to 1921, elected in a special election in November 1915 defeating the incumbent Charles A. Perkins, and re-elected in November 1917 to a full term. Swann was accused several times by reform organizations of misconduct and malfeasance in office, urging his removal. Since the precedent of 1900, when Asa Bird Gardiner was removed by Gov. Theodore Roosevelt, this had become a constant move in New York City politics, but neither Republican Charles S. Whitman nor Democrat Al Smith saw reason enough to act.\nIn November 1920, Swann ran for the New York Supreme Court (1st D.), nominated by the Tammany bosses to get rid of him in the D.A.'s office. After his defeat, Tammany insisted in trying to get him appointed to a vacancy in the New York Court of General Sessions, but Governor Al Smith did not yield. However, for most of the year 1921, Swann remained out-of-state, partly in Florida, partly in Missouri, and left the office in the hands of his chief assistant district attorney, Joab H. Banton.\nOn May 21, 1921, Swann married in Salisbury, Chariton County, Missouri, Margaret W. Geisinger, a great-niece of Commodore David Geisinger.\nDeath\nHe died on September 19, 1945, in Sewall's Point, Florida.\nSwann was buried at the St. Peter's Episcopal Cemetery in Fernandina Beach, Nassau County, Florida.\nReferences\nSources\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1902/10/04/101288743.pdf OLD 10th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT CONVENTIONS] in NYT on October 4, 1902\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1904/10/04/101240753.pdf FOUR NEW NAMES ON THE CONGRESS TICKET] in NYT on October 4, 1904\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/11/06/101729629.pdf TAMMANY WINS] in NYT on November 6, 1907\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/12/31/100233556.pdf JUDGE DELEHANTY ACCUSES SWANN OF FRAUD ON COURT] in NYT on December 31, 1916\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/04/05/102329148.pdf CITY CLUB RENEWS ATTACKS ON SWANN] in NYT on April 5, 1917\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/08/17/102361225.pdf TAMMANY FINISHES SLATE FOR THIS FALL] in NYT on August 17, 1917\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/08/10/102884498.pdf TAMMANY PICKS SWANN FOR BENCH] in NYT on August 10, 1920\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/12/24/103520535.pdf TAMMANY WANTS SWANN ON BENCH] in NYT on December 24, 1920\n*[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/05/22/98692561.pdf EDWARD SWANN WEDS IN MISSOURI] in NYT on May 22, 1921\nExternal links\n*"
