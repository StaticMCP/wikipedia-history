On several depictions she and queen mother Tiaa are depicted as goddesses accompanying Thutmose. For unknown reasons, in Thutmose's 7th year Nefertari was replaced by Thutmose's sister Iaret as the Great Royal Wife; it has been suggested that she either died or was pushed into the background when Iaret was old enough to become Thutmose's wife.\nNefertari was depicted on 8 stelae from Giza together with her husband before various deities. She was also shown on a stela found in the Luxor Temple and was mentioned on a scarab found in Gurob. It is not known whether any children were born either to Nefertari or to Iaret; after Thutmose's death the next pharaoh was Amenhotep III, the son of a secondary wife called Mutemwia.\nSources"
