Based on a script written by Shridhar Raghavan and Abbas Tyrewala, from an original story by Chopra, it is the sixth instalment in the YRF Spy Universe and sequel to the 2019 film War. The film stars Hrithik Roshan, N. T. Rama Rao Jr. (in his Hindi film debut) and Kiara Advani in the lead roles, alongside Ashutosh Rana and Anil Kapoor in pivotal roles. It follows Kabir Dhaliwal, a former RAW agent, who, after going rogue, becomes a major threat to national security, and a special units officer, Vikram Chelapathi, is assigned to neutralize him.\nPrincipal photography commenced in October 2023. The film was shot extensively in Mumbai with sporadic schedules taking place in Spain, Italy and Abu Dhabi. The film's soundtrack is composed by Pritam while Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara composed the film score. Made on an estimated budget of 300400 crore, it is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made.\nWar 2 was released on 14 August 2025, coinciding with the Indian Independence Day weekend, and received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics who criticised the story, screenplay, direction, and visual effects, but praised the cast performances and action sequences. The film underperformed at the box-office, grossing 303351 crore worldwide. Nonetheless, it emerged as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2025, and fifth highest-grossing Indian film of 2025.\nPlot\nIn 2024, five years after going rogue and eliminating Saurabh and Rizwan Ilyasi, Kabir operates as a freelance mercenary for various international clients. After assassinating a gangster in Japan, he goes to meet a client in Germany, who drugs and transports him to India, where he is introduced to the Kali Cartel — a powerful criminal syndicate comprising members from India and its neighboring countries, aiming to infiltrate and control the Indian government. The cartel requests Kabir’s assistance, unaware that two years earlier Colonel Sunil Luthra had secretly tasked him with infiltrating the organization, creating the public perception that Kabir was a rogue agent and no longer affiliated with RAW.\nKabir’s first assignment from the cartel is to assassinate Luthra. Luthra himself coerces Kabir into carrying out the act, which Kabir does with deep emotional conflict. This earns Kabir the trust of the cartel, and he is sent to meet the Indian leader of the cartel — businessman Gautam Gulati. Meanwhile, RAW receives footage of Kabir killing Luthra, and Colonel Vikrant Kaul is appointed as the new RAW chief. Wing Commander Kavya, Luthra’s daughter and Kabir’s former lover, joins the team assigned to track him. On the recommendation of Defence Minister Vilasrao Sarang, Special Unit Officer Vikram Chelapathi is also recruited to the team.\nKabir is later tracked in Spain, where he is visiting his adoptive daughter Ruhi. Vikram pursues Kabir onto a high-speed train, but allows him to escape moments before the train crashes. Kabir and Ruhi visit Khalid's house to ensure Ruhi's safety with Khalid's mother. At the ISIS training camp in Yemen, Gulati subsequently orders Kabir to assassinate Sarang's family aboard a chartered flight to pressure the minister. Following a deliberate clue left by Kabir, Vikram meets him privately and learns the truth about Kabir’s mission, agreeing to aid him. Kabir hijacks the flight with a stealth bomber and, with Vikram’s help, kills the attackers. However, Vikram reveals himself as a member of the cartel — murders them himself, ejects Kabir from the plane, and addresses him cryptically as “Kaboo,” causing Kabir to remember his troubled past.\nIn 1999, a 14-year-old Kabir is left homeless in the slums of Mumbai after his widowed father commits suicide. He befriends Raghu, and the two are arrested during a robbery, eventually both ending up in a juvenile detention center. Luthra, then an army major, visits to motivate the inmates to join the army. Kabir and Raghu pass the physical tests, but Raghu fails the emotional evaluation for prioritizing himself over the country. Kabir enlists in the army with Luthra’s support, leaving Raghu behind. Feeling betrayed, Raghu escapes detention – And Raghu is none other than Vikram Chelapathi.\nIn the present, Kabir tracks Gulati in Abu Dhabi and attempts to assassinate him. Raghu intervenes, kills Gulati himself, and frames Kabir for the murder in RAW’s eyes. After a boat chase, Kabir escapes. He later reunites with Kavya in Italy, revealing his mission and Raghu’s true identity. When Kavya tries to alert Sarang, the pair are attacked and realize Sarang himself is part of the cartel. Sarang had orchestrated Raghu’s infiltration and the murder of his own family to gain public sympathy and secure his path to becoming Prime Minister. Kabir and Kavya are rescued by Kaul.\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, Sarang and Raghu plan to assassinate the Prime Minister. Kabir shoots and kills Sarang, but spares Raghu, who later recovers in the hospital. The event is cancelled and Kavya and Kaul prepare to take the Prime Minister back to Delhi, when they are attacked by the cartel impersonating as security officers, but Kavya and Kaul finish them and leave for Delhi. Following a face-off in an ice cave, Raghu confesses his resentment towards Kabir for “betraying” him in their youth despite always supporting him. Kabir, recognizing Raghu’s lingering humanity, convinces him to help dismantle the cartel. Meanwhile, upon landing in Delhi, Kaul announces to the public that both Sarang and Raghu, who is declared a martyr, were killed by Kabir.\nNine months later, Raghu is revealed to be alive and secretly helps Kabir execute all the remaining cartel leaders. The two part ways, agreeing to reunite if a new threat emerges. Kabir assures Kaul he will always serve his country and rekindles his relationship with Kavya.\nIn the post-credits scene, an unidentified man tattoos the Greek letter α on a young girl’s arm, inducting her into a covert government program called Alpha.\nCast\nProduction\nDevelopment\nAt the launch party of War in October 2019, when asked about a sequel, director Siddharth Anand confirmed he was working on the script and had plans to convert the film into a franchise, depending on the audience's response to the film.
