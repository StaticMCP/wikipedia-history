The ward elects one councillor to Bassetlaw District Council using the first past the post electoral system for a four-year term in office. The number of registered voters in the ward is 1,862 as of 2019.\nIt consists of the civil parishes of Blyth, Scrooby and Styrrup with Oldcotes.\nThe ward was created in 1979 following a review of ward boundaries in Bassetlaw by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. A subsequent review of electoral arrangements in 2002 resulted in minor changes to the boundaries of the ward, although the number of councillors remained the same.\nCouncillors\n|frame=yes|frame-width=360|frame-height=310|text=Interactive map of ward boundaries.}}\nThe ward elects one councillor every four years.
