      "text": "# Warszawa (Praxis album)__disambig_1\n\n}}\nWarszawa is a live album by experimental rock band Praxis, released in 1999 by the label Innerhythmic.\nThe album contains three of the supergroup's most influential members: bassist and producer Bill Laswell, guitarist Buckethead, and drummer Brain. This album was recorded during a live show in Warsaw, Poland and has some resemblance to the band's earlier funk-influenced material, containing elements of 1992's Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis) and the loud heavy metal and noise rock elements reminiscent of 1994's Sacrifist. Besides Laswell, Buckethead and Brain, the album also contains contributions from turntablists Mix Master Mike and PhonosycographDISK.\nThe album opens with \"Initiation\", a 20-minute turntable epic that mixes albums like Snoop's Murder Was the Case with kung-fu movie samples.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n*Buckethead – electric guitar\n*Bill Laswell – bass guitar\n*Brain – drums, percussion\n*Mix Master Mike – turntables, samples\n*PhonosycographDISK – turntables, samples\nRecording Staff\n*Bill Murphy - Producer\n*Oz Fritz – Engineer\n*Michael Fossenkemper – Mastering\n*Robert Musso – Engineer\n*Shinro Ohtake – Artwork\nReferences"
