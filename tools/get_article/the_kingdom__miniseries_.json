Set in the neurosurgical ward of Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet (, nicknamed \"Riget\", ), each episode of the show follows the hospital's eccentric staff and patients as they encounter bizarre and sometimes supernatural phenomena. The series is notable for its wry humor, its muted sepia colour scheme, and the appearance of a chorus of dishwashers with Down syndrome, who discuss in intimate detail the strange occurrences in the hospital. The main theme's song was written by von Trier himself.\nThe first series of four episodes premiered from DR in November to December 1994, and was followed by a second series, Riget II, which aired in November 1997. A belated third and final series of five episodes, directed by von Trier and written by von Trier with Niels Vørsel, entitled Exodus, began filming in 2021 and was screened out of competition at the Venice Film Festival and at the Serial Killer festival in September 2022, and premiered on Nordic streaming platform Viaplay with the first two episodes on October 9. The series premiered in select regions between November 27 and December 25 on streaming platform MUBI.\nVon Trier has credited David Lynch's 1990 television series Twin Peaks and the 1965 French miniseries Belphegor as inspirations for the series. The Kingdom itself inspired an American series, Kingdom Hospital, developed by novelist Stephen King; the American version aired on ABC between March and July 2004, and was cancelled after a single season.\nPlot synopsis\nEach episode of all three series opens with the same prologue, detailing how the hospital, Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, was built on the site of the \"bleaching ponds\", which recur in the name of the street of the hospital's official address, Blegdamsvej, although the exact significance of the reference is never explicitly discussed in the series.\nThe show begins with the admission of a spiritualist patient, Sigrid Drusse (Kirsten Rolffes), who hears the sound of a girl crying in the elevator shaft. Upon investigation, Drusse discovers that the girl had died decades earlier, having been killed by her father to hide her illegitimacy. In order to put the spirit to rest, Drusse searches for the girl's body and ultimately finds it preserved in a specimen jar in the office of the hospital's professor of pathology, Professor Bondo (Baard Owe).\nMeanwhile, neurosurgeon Stig Helmer (Ernst-Hugo Järegård), a recent appointee from Sweden to the neurosurgery department, tries to cover up his responsibility for a botched operation which left a young girl in a persistent vegetative state.\nPathologist Dr. Palle Bondo (Baard Owe) attempts to convince the family of a man dying from liver cancer to donate his liver to the hospital for Bondo's research. (In fact, Bondo wants it as a trophy, as it is the second largest hepatosarcoma ever recorded.) When denied, Bondo has the cancerous liver transplanted into his own body (as the patient signed an organ donor form), so that the cancer will become his personal property and can be kept within the hospital.\nAmongst other plotlines, a young medical student becomes attracted to the nurse in charge of the sleep research laboratory, a ghostly ambulance appears and disappears every night, a junior doctor runs a black market in medical supplies, and a neurosurgeon discovers that she was impregnated by a ghost and that the baby in her womb is developing abnormally rapidly. In every episode, two dishwashers (each with Down syndrome) in the cellar discuss the strange happenings at Riget, and Helmer screams his famous catchphrase: \"Danskjävlar!\" (subtitled as \"Danish scum\", but literally \"Danish devils\").\nIn the third series, Exodus, sleepwalker Karen Svensson finds herself at Rigshospitalet, investigating the fallout of the fatal power outage at the end of the second series. Exodus also introduces Dr. Helmer, Jr. (Mikael Persbrandt), the neurotic son of the late Stig Helmer, and a new addition to the staff of Riget. Helmer Jr. is threatened with a lawsuit after making sexual advances to a female colleague in the hospital, has to consult a Swedish lawyer (Alexander Skarsgard), son of the lawyer from season 2.\nCast\nas Stig Helmer, a Dane-hating Swedish doctor]]\n(pictured in 2018) appears in a dual role as the antagonist Åge Krüger, and his infant son Little Brother]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:180px;\" |Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:180px;\" |Character\n! colspan=\"3\"|Season\n|-\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|I\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|II\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Exodus\n|-\n| Søren Pilmark || Jørgen 'Hook' Krogshøj || colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Ghita Nørby || Rigmor Mortensen || colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Birgitte Raaberg || Judith Petersen || colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Peter Mygind || Morten 'Mogge' Moesgaard || colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Ernst-Hugo Järegård || Stig Helmer || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Kirsten Rolffes || Sigrid Drusse || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Holger Juul Hansen || Einar Moesgaard || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Jens Okking || Bulder Harly Drusse || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Baard Owe || Palle Bondo || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Bodil Jørgensen || Karen Svensson || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Nicolas Bro || Balder 'Bulder' || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Nikolaj Lie Kaas || Filip Naver || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Lars Mikkelsen || Pontopidan || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Mikael Persbrandt || Stig Helmer Jr. || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Tuva Novotny || Anna || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Ida Engvoll || Kalle || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Otto Brandenburg || Hansen || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Annevig Schelde Ebbe || Mary Krüger || colspan=\"1\"  ||  ||\n|-\n| Udo Kier || Åge Krüger / Little Brother / Frederik / Big Brother || colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Vita Jensen || Female dishwasher || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n|  || Male dishwasher || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Jasmine Junker || Female dishwasher || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Jesper Sørensen || Male dishwasher || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Solbjørg Højfeldt || Camilla || colspan=\"1\"  ||  ||\n|-\n| Birthe Neumann || Fru Svendsen ||  || colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| Erik Wedersøe || Ole ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| John Hahn-Petersen || Secretary Nivesen ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Director Bob || colspan=\"1\"  || colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| Laura Christensen || Mona Jensen || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Vera Gebuhr || Gerda ||  ||  ||\n|-\n|  || Christian || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Louise Fribo || Sanne Jeppesen || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n|  || Chaplain || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Thomas Bo Larsen || Falkon ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Henrik Koefoed || Radiologist ||  || colspan=\"2\"\n|-\n| Paul Hüttel || Steenbæk || colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Helle Virkner || Emma Mogensen || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Stellan Skarsgård || The Swedish Lawyer ||  ||  ||\n|-\n| Alexander Skarsgård || The Swedish Lawyer's Son || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| David Dencik || Bosse || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Willem Dafoe || Grand Duc || colspan=\"2\"  ||\n|-\n| Lars von Trier || HimselfSatan || colspan=\"3\"\n|}\nProduction\nRiget: Exodus (2022)\nIn December 2020, Danmarks Radio announced that a third and final season, consisting of five episodes directed by von Trier and co-written by von Trier alongside original series co-writer Niels Vørsel, would begin filming in 2021 under the title Riget: Exodus. The same year, von Trier began showing symptoms of Parkinson's disease during an interview with Christian Lund of Louisiana Channel; afterwards, he continued to work while taking medication. Von Trier did not watch \"all the old ones\" before beginning work on Riget: Exodus, and had tried \"to get rid of the ties from the old stuff\", with the focus being on the characters.\nReturning cast members Ghita Nørby, Søren Pilmark, Peter Mygind, Birgitte Raaberg, Laura Christensen and Udo Kier are joined by newcomers Bodil Jørgensen, Nicolas Bro, Lars Mikkelsen, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Mikael Persbrandt, Tuva Novotny, Ida Engvoll, Asta Kamma August, David Dencik, Alexander Skarsgard and Willem Dafoe. Von Trier had a \"rotten time\" filming the series, as he suffered from the effects of Parkinson's disease during the shoot, but hoped the actors \"didn't notice\".\nIn September 2022, Exodus (presented as a \"five hour feature-length film\") screened out of competition at the 79th Venice International Film Festival, alongside Nicolas Winding Refn's miniseries Copenhagen Cowboy.\nEpisodes\nRiget (1994)\n|ShortSummary=Mrs Drusse, a hypochondriac psychic, gets herself admitted to the Kingdom because she believes the hospital is haunted.

It is available on DVD in Australia and New Zealand on Madman Entertainment's Directors Suite label, in the UK from Second Sight, and in the US from Koch-Lorber Films. Following their restoration of the first two series using original film negatives, Mubi released all three series to Blu-ray in April 2024 as part of a 7-disc box set.\nStreaming\nNewly restored HD editions of the first two series premiered on MUBI on 13 November and 20 November 2022, respectively; the debut of the restored series was followed by the premiere of Exodus on the platform on 27 November, with its fifth and final episode premiering on Christmas Day.\nReception\nCritical reception\nOn Metacritic, all three seasons has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100.\nI and II\nFilm critic Leonard Maltin, who reviewed the two-part theatrical version, awarded it three and a half out of a possible four stars, calling it \"a must-see for those who think they've seen everything\".\nDespite being a miniseries, The Kingdom appears in the best-selling book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, where it is called \"a medical horror epic\", with its supernatural elements described as being both eerie and magical.\nExodus\nat the Berlin Film Festival in 2014.]]\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, 87% of 23 reviews are positive and the average rating is 6.80/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"An acquired taste for newcomers and comfort weirdness for Lars von Trier's devotees, The Kingdom: Exodus is a cheeky delicacy infused with cosmic horror that reaches biblically insane proportions.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average of 77 out of 100 from nine reviews, indicating a generally positive reception.\nExodus was well received by critics following its premiere at the Venice in September 2022, with Variety calling it \"over-the-top\" and \"fun\", and the Italian Post praised the series, saying it \"amuses and disturbs\", and comparing it positively to Twin Peaks. The Upcoming gave the series 3/5, praising its \"dark humour\" and noting that it feels like a \"tribute to Lars von Trier's career, a revisiting of his early work... filled with the wobbly handheld shots that distinguished the Dogme 95 movement\". Giving it 3/5 stars, The Guardian called the series \"a nightmarish revue, peppered with familiar faces in brief walk-on roles\", and said that it is \"fun to a point and richly textured to a fault, with a plot that’s entirely driven by what has gone before\".\nAccolades\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Award\n! scope=\"col\"| Category\n! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s)\n! scope=\"col\"| Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 1995 Bodil Awards\n| Best Danish Film\n| Riget\n|\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n|-\n| Best Actor\n| Ernst-Hugo Järegård\n|\n|-\n| Best Actress\n| Kirsten Rolffes\n|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actor\n| Holger Juul Hansen\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" | 30th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival\n| Crystal Globe\n| Riget\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n| Best Director Award\n| Lars von Trier\n|\n|-\n| Best Actor Award\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Ernst-Hugo Järegård\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" | 12th Robert Awards\n| Best Actor in a Leading Role\n|\n| rowspan=\"6\" |\n|-\n| Best Actress in a Leading Role\n| Kirsten Rolffes\n|\n|-\n| Best Screenplay\n| Lars von Trier,\n|\n|-\n| Best Cinematography\n| Eric Kress\n|\n|-\n| Best Score\n|\n|\n|-\n| Best Sound Design\n| Per Streit\n|\n|-\n| Seattle International Film Festival\n| Golden Space Needle Award for Best Film\n| Riget\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1996 Adolf Grimme Awards\n| Series/Miniseries\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Lars von Trier\n|\n|\n|-\n| 1996 Golden Cable Awards\n| Bronze Cable for Innovation\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1996 Bodil Awards\n| Best Actor\n| Holger Juul Hansen\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n|-\n| Best Supporting Actress\n| Birgitte Raaberg\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 1999 Fantasporto\n| Best Screenplay\n| Lars von Trier, Morten Arnfred\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n| Best Director\n| Lars von Trier\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | 40th Robert Awards\n|Best TV Series\n|Lars von Trier, Niels Vørsel, and Louise Vesth (producer)\n|\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n|Best Actor in a Leading Role - TV series\n|Mikael Persbrandt\n|\n|-\n|Best Actress in a Leading Role - TV series\n|Bodil Jørgensen\n|\n|-\n|Best Supporting Actor in a Leading Role - TV series\n|Lars Mikkelsen\n|\n|-\n|Best Supporting Actress in a Leading Role - TV series\n|Tuva Novotny\n|\n|}\nAmerican adaptation\nHorror novelist Stephen King discovered the five-hour theatrical edit of Riget in a video store during production of the 1997 TV miniseries adaptation of The Shining, and, finding it \"both funny and scary\", promptly set out to obtain the rights to the series for an American adaptation. At that time, the rights were owned by Columbia Pictures, who had intended to adapt the series as a two-hour theatrical film. King negotiated with Columbia for the rights, ultimately exchanging them for the option to his novella \"Secret Window, Secret Garden\" (which Columbia adapted in 2004 as the feature film Secret Window).\nKing's thirteen episode television adaptation, titled Kingdom Hospital, broadcast between March and July 2004 on ABC. Often directly adapting storylines from the original series, Kingdom Hospital was set in a hospital in Lewiston, Maine, which was on the site of a mill built before the Civil War. Many character names were derived from their Danish equivalents, e.g., Sigrid Drusse became Sally Druse and Stig Helmer became Dr. Stegman. In a departure from the plot of Riget, the American series introduces a new protagonist, a comatose patient, Peter Rickman, inspired by King's own experience of being hit by a minivan, and a talking giant anteater, the spirit guide Anubis/Antubis.\nAlthough King and co-writer Richard Dooling developed an outline for a second series, ratings dropped throughout the season. Kingdom Hospital was placed on indefinite hiatus following a \"major network shake-up\", and was never picked up for a second series.\nSee also\n* List of ghost films\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
