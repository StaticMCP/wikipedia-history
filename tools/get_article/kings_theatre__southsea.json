It opened on 30 September 1907. It is operated by the Kings Theatre Trust Ltd. The building was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1976.\nHistory\nThe original Lady Statue. It was placed on the top of the theatre until WW2. Then placed on the front portico from 1950s to 1980s. It disappeared until 1998 when discovered in a builders yard. She is now named Aurora after a naming competition.\nThe theatre opened on 30 September 1907 with a production of Charles I followed by two further of Sir Henry Irving's works. During the 1930s it was used to premiere several works by Ian Hay before they transferred to the West End including Orders Are Orders and Admirals All. The musical ''This'll Make You Whistle premiered there in 1935.\nThe theatre stayed in the control of its original owners, The Portsmouth Theatre Company, until 1964 when it was purchased by Commander Reggie & Mrs Joan Cooper. In 1990 it was sold again to Hampshire County Council. In 2001, after a successful campaign by AKTER (Action for Kings Theatre Restoration) to keep the theatre open, the theatre was purchased by Portsmouth City Council and leased to the Kings Theatre Trust Ltd who undertook the restoration of the building. The present day theatre has a seating capacity of 1600 and a computerised booking system. Much of the backstage area is still fully manual, allowing it to retain the tag of a traditional hemp house, though powered flying bars have now been installed to allow large-scale productions.\nIn 1974, director Ken Russell filmed the Pinball Wizard sequence of the rock opera Tommy'' at the theatre, featuring The Who and Elton John on the stage.\nThe Kings Theatre Trust Ltd\nThe Kings Theatre Trust Ltd. is a registered charity which oversees both the day-to-day running and the restoration of the building, as well as productions at the theatre. The restoration is in part funded by Portsmouth City Council and the Kings Theatre Trust.\nStaff\nLed by a team of full time staff, headed by CEO Richard Pearce.\nRestoration work\nAs part of the Centenary Project, the Kings Theatre underwent a £500,000 refurbishment of the auditorium, including the ceiling. Beginning on 17 June 2007 the theatre was cleared and scaffolding was constructed to allow access to the higher areas of the auditorium. There was work to restore the decorations of the theatre and maintain the areas. During this work a small 120-seat theatre was created within the auditorium which was known as the Stage 2 Studio. The Studio season was such a success that it was repeated during the Summer of 2008 (throughout August) with music, comedy, children's shows, drama and dance all part of the line up.\nBetween October 2008 and February 2009, the original leaded dome, red painted wooden cupula, the deteriorated wooden statue (now named Aurora) and six lion figures was replicated in glassfibre by Jago Developments of Chichester and successfully installed by them (with the help of a 60-ton crane).\nSince the restoration programme commenced, over £2&nbsp;million has been spent on refurbishment using both professional and volunteer workers.\nThe Kings Theatre Trust are in the process of raising funds for a restoration of the currently dilapidated Tower Room, to create a community art studio and exhibition space.\nShows\nStairs leading up from the lobby\nMany one night touring shows come to the Kings Theatre, from ballet to rock music, through drama to children's shows and comedians.\nSince the major restorations have been undertaken, the Kings Theatre has attracted large national touring productions such as \"Chicago\", \"Beauty & The Beast\", \"MAMMA MIA!\", \"The Rocky Horror Show\", \"Evita\" and \"Grease\".\nThe theatre is also host to many local drama societies including The Portsmouth Players, CCADs and South Downe Musical Society.\nProfessional Productions\n* The Sound of Music\n* Mamma Mia!\n* We Will Rock You\n* The Play That Goes Wrong\n* Avenue Q\n* Grease\n* Chicago\n* Dreamboats and Petticoats\n* Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\n* Buddy\n* The Mousetrap\n* Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\n* Copacabana\n* The Woman in Black (25th Anniversary Touring Production)\n* Calamity Jane\n* Return to the Forbidden Planet (25th Anniversary Tour)\n* The History Boys\n* Hair\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kingsportsmouth.co.uk Kings Theatre] Official site"
