Founded in 1948 as a traditional university press, UQP now publishes books for general readers across fiction, non-fiction, poetry, children's and young adult.\nHistory\nThe University of Queensland Press was founded in 1948 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Queensland.\nEstablished as a publisher of scholarly works, UQP made its transition into trade publishing in the late 1960s, largely through poetry and the Paperback Poets series. Considered revolutionary at the time, Paperback Poets was a series of poetry editions established after the poet and novelist David Malouf expressed a desire to produce a new poetry format that was affordable and had mass appeal. Alongside Malouf's debut collection Bicycle and Other Poems, the Paperback Poets series published volumes by writers such as Rodney Hall and Michael Dransfield.\nIn 1972, during a time of \"Australia’s developing awareness of her place in Asia\", UQP launched the Asian and Pacific Writing series, which was edited first by Michael Wilding and later by Harry Aveling. In 1980 the Press launched the Leaders of Asia Series, with K. G. Tregonning as the general editor.\nIn 1990, UQP was the first mainstream Australian publisher to set up a list specifically for Indigenous Australian authors in 1990 with the Black Australian Writers series.  In 2023, UQP created the First Nations Classics series, a collection of UQP's award-winning titles by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander writers reissued with introductions from contemporary authors.  The series set out to celebrate the legacy of Indigenous Australian writing in the publisher's backlist and bring renewed attention to the featured titles.

The award established the careers of hailed Australian writers such as Doris Pilkington Garimara, Samuel Wagan Watson, Larissa Behrendt, Tara June Winch and Ellen van Neerven.\nUQP established the UQP Quentin Bryce Award in 2020 in honour of Dame Quentin Bryce to recognise a book in its list each year that celebrates women’s lives and/or promotes gender equality. The inaugural recipient of the award was van Neerven’s poetry collection Throat, which went on to be recognised in multiple prizes, including winning Book of the Year at the 2021 NSW Premier’s Literary Awards.\nIn partnership with Arts Queensland, UQP supports the Thomas Shapcott Poetry Prize.

Previous winners of the prize include celebrated poets Holland-Batt, Felicity Plunkett, Gavin Yuan Gao and Rae White.\nUQP also supports the Glendower Award for an Emerging Queensland Writer Queensland Literary Award.
