It is written by Michael Ward, Shaun Ward and Jim Williams, and produced by former Dead or Alive members Mike Percy and Tim Lever. The song was released as a single in May 1991 by Cooltempo Records and became Thomas' highest-charting hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart. In Sweden, the song peaked at number 22 and was his only single that charted there.\nCritical reception\nJames Hamilton from Record Mirror wrote, \"Released next week, almost a year after 'Outstanding' was first promoed, Kenny's even classier follow-up is a superb slinkily jiggling soul jogger with attractively harmonised hooks and a sophisticated arrangement, produced by 1 World's Mike Percy & Tim Lever [...]. Let's hope it's not too good!\"\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1991)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)\n| 125\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n| 12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (European Hit Radio)\n| 12\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Luxembourg (Radio Luxembourg)\n| 5\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Airplay (Music Week)\n| 4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Dance (Music Week)\n| 3\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Club Chart (Record Mirror)\n| 3\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1991)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (European Hit Radio)\n| 72\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (OCC)\n| 33\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|UK Club Chart (Record Mirror)\n| 26\n|}\nRelease history\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!scope=\"col\"|Region\n!scope=\"col\"|Date\n!scope=\"col\"|Format(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|Label(s)\n!scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|United Kingdom\n|20 May 1991\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Cooltempo\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia\n|23 March 1992\n|\n|\n|}\nReferences"
