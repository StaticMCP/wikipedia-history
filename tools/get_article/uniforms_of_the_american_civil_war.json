Styles used were traditional similar to those used in the Napoleonic Wars, a regimental dress such as used during the American Revolutionary War and a specialist dress similar to those worn by Lancers and Hussars or an ethnic dress such as kilts. With shortages in 1861 the federal government issued a regulation pattern uniform for all state regiments.\nConfederacy\nAt the onset of the war the Confederate States Army uniforms were highly varied as the majority were made at home. Between 1861 and 1862 the quartermaster department issued some uniforms but there were severe shortages.\nSee also\n* Uniform of the Union Army\n* Uniforms of the Confederate States Armed Forces\nReferences\nBibliography\n* Katcher, Philip.
