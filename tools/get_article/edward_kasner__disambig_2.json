Kasner was the first Jewish person appointed to a faculty position in the sciences at Columbia University. Subsequently, he became an adjunct professor in 1906, and a full professor in 1910, at the university. Differential geometry was his main field of study. In addition to introducing the term \"googol\", he is known also for the Kasner metric and the Kasner polygon.\nEducation\nKasner's 1899 PhD dissertation at Columbia University was titled The Invariant Theory of the Inversion Group: Geometry upon a Quadric Surface; it was published by the American Mathematical Society in 1900 in their Transactions.\nGoogol and googolplex\nKasner is perhaps best remembered today for introducing the term \"googol.\" In order to pique the interest of children, Kasner sought a name for a very large number: one followed by 100 zeros.  On a walk in the New Jersey Palisades with his nephews, Milton (1911–1981) and Edwin Sirotta, Kasner asked for their ideas. Nine-year-old Milton suggested \"googol\".\nIn 1940, with James R. Newman, Kasner co-wrote a non-technical book surveying the field of mathematics, called Mathematics and the Imagination (). It was in this book that the term \"googol\" was first popularized:\n}}\nThe Internet search engine \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \"googol\", and the \"Googleplex\" (the Google company headquarters in Mountain View, California) is similarly derived from googolplex.\nPersonal life\nKasner was Jewish and was the son of Austrian immigrants.\nWorks\n*\n*\n*\n* Edward Kasner and James R.
