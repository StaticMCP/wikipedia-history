The building was designed to house office spaces on most of the first and second floors, and facilities of the local YMCA, including a gymnasium and reading room.  The building's facade features a distinctive basket-weave style of brickwork.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, and included in the Marlborough Center Historic District in 1998.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Marlborough, Massachusetts\nReferences"
