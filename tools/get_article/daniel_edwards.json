      "text": "# Daniel Edwards\n\nDaniel Edwards (born 1965 in La Porte, Indiana) is an American contemporary artist whose pieces address celebrity and popular culture in ways that have often stirred controversy. The release of the pieces is generally accompanied by press releases. He includes the idea of promotion and associative fame in his own marketing of his art.\nHis works include a sculpture of the disembodied head of Ted Williams, a life-sized statue of Britney Spears giving birth while nude on her hands and knees on a bearskin rug, a bust of Senator Hillary Clinton, and a  bust of Fidel Castro.\nWorks\nBritney Spears\ngiving birth]]\nEdwards titled the piece Monument to Pro-Life: The Birth of Sean Preston, explaining that it symbolized Spears' decision to put childbirth ahead of her career. Britney Spears actually had a caesarean section.\nIn an Associated Press interview, Edwards asserted that he incorporates celebrity stories because:  You're bombarded with these stories. And there's a thread that winds back to the art. That's not a bad thing. People are interested in sex, and it works for art as well.  Edwards conceded, however, that he wouldn't march with either anti-abortion or abortion rights advocates.\nA number of the images shown in the media are casts of the sculpture rather than the original. Casts can be distinguished by the joins around the forearms and shins and by their paler color.\nHillary Clinton\nIn 2006, Edwards created a life-size bust of Senator Hillary Clinton. It is titled Presidential Bust of Hillary Rodham Clinton. The sculpture depicts her wearing a low-cut floral dress.\nSuri Cruise\nOn 28 August 2006, Edwards unveiled a sculpture titled ''Suri's bronzed baby poop'', purported to be the actual first bowel movement of the baby of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes. The sculpture was to be auctioned on eBay, and Edwards was commissioned to produce a limited-edition plaster replica.  Sources disagreed on whether the bronze sculpture actually contained Suri's excrement: some reported that it did, while others reported the story as being a hoax.\nDead Prince Harry\nA sculpture of Prince Harry depicting him dead, in military uniform, his head resting upon a Bible with a locket of his mother's clasped in his hands and with a vulture standing by his feet. Edwards suggests that the sculpture shows how Prince Harry \"must have died the day they told him he couldn't serve\" (in Iraq).\nOprah Sarcophagus\nEdwards created a half-scale model depicting ''Oprah's Sarcophagus'' at Gardenfresh Gallery in Chicago at In April 2008. The golden bronze casket lid bears an unclothed full-figure rendering of the media mogul with vertical stripes. Alongside it is the artist's Oprah Burial Mask.\nOther works\nIn 2009, Edwards released String Of Babies depicting mother of eight Nadya Suleman aka Octomom as an octopus embracing the world's only surviving set of octuplets.\nOn August 9, 2009, Edwards unveiled his latest piece, a nude statue of Angelina Jolie breastfeeding twins, one African and one not.\nOn August 9, 2011, pictures surfaced of a new statue Edwards had created depicting actress/singer Selena Gomez with her boyfriend singer, Justin Bieber  conjoined by the torso, nude, with only coverings on their private parts. Justin was given the Canadian maple leaf as a covering and Selena, the Texas star.\nEdwards also created a \"memorial\" bust of Amy Winehouse.\nDocumentary\nIn 2006, feature filmmaker A.D. Calvo produced a series of short documentaries on Edwards and his work. His compilation was entitled La Danse Macabre: Portrait of a Serial Sculptor.\nSources\nPrint\nOnline\n* [http://perezhilton.com/2009-12-07-brangelina-sculpture-to-inspire-future-homeowners 'Brangelina Sculpture To \"Inspire\" Future Homeowners'(2009-12-07)]  in PerezHilton.com\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.culturekiosque.com/art/news/paris-hilton-autopsy.html European journal Culturekiosque comments on significance of Edwards' Paris Hilton Autopsy and other sculptures, and his play with celebrity, media, classical mythology and even search engine optimization.]"
