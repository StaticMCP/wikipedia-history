The elections took place alongside local elections in the other London boroughs and elections to local authorities across the United Kingdom.\nThe Liberal Democrats retained overall majority control of the council, the fifth time in the last six elections that the party has won overall control.\nBackground\nHistory\nThe thirty-two London boroughs were established in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963. They are the principal authorities in Greater London and have responsibilities including education, housing, planning, highways, social services, libraries, recreation, waste, environmental health and revenue collection. Some of the powers are shared with the Greater London Authority, which also manages passenger transport, police and fire.\nSince its formation, Kingston upon Thames has been under Liberal Democrat control, Conservative control and no overall control. The Liberal Democrats have controlled the council since 2002, apart from the period between 2014 and 2018 when the Conservatives had an overall majority. The Liberal Democrats regained control in the most recent election in 2018, where they won 39 seats with 51.7% of the vote and the Conservatives won the remaining nine seats with 30.6% of the vote. The Labour Party lost both seats they were defending and received 11.9% of the vote across the borough.\nCouncil term\nA Liberal Democrat councillor, Sharon Falchikov-Sumner, left her party in 2018 after the council voted to close their last residential care home. She joined the Green Party in February 2019. In March 2020, the council leader Liz Green was successfully challenged by Caroline Kerr, a Liberal Democrat councillor who was first elected in 2018. A Liberal Democrat councillor for Chessington South, Tricia Bamford, resigned in December 2020 due to a change in her family circumstances. A by-election to replace her was not held until 6 May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The by-election, which was contested by thirteen Official Monster Raving Loony Party candidates, was won by the Liberal Democrat candidate Andrew MacKinlay. Mackinlay had previously served as the Labour MP for Thurrock. In September 2021, the Liberal Democrat councillor Jon Tolley left his party due to policy disagreements with the council executive. He announced that he wouldn't contest the next election, saying \"I think we were lying to the public\" about the demolition of a leisure centre in his ward. Kerr announced her resignation as council leader in October 2021.\nAs with most London boroughs, Kingston upon Thames was electing its councillors under new boundaries decided by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, which it produced after a period of consultation. The number of councillors remained at 48, but the commission produced new boundaries following a period of consultation, with ten three-member wards and nine two-member wards.\nElectoral process\nKingston upon Thames, like other London borough councils, elects all of its councillors at once every four years. The previous election took place in 2018. The election took place by multi-member first-past-the-post voting, with each ward being represented by two or three councillors. Electors had as many votes as there are councillors to be elected in their ward, with the top two or three being elected.\nAll registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in London aged 18 or over were entitled to vote in the election. People who lived at two addresses in different councils, such as university students with different term-time and holiday addresses, were entitled to be registered for and vote in elections in both local authorities. Voting in-person at polling stations took place from 7:00 to 22:00 on election day, and voters were able to apply for postal votes or proxy votes in advance of the election.\nPrevious council composition\nFile:Kingston upon Thames Council 2018.svg|\nFile:United Kingdom Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council 2021.svg|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | After 2018 election\n! colspan=\"3\" | Before 2022 election\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Party\n!
