      "text": "# Timeline of the 2020 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 2020 Pacific hurricane season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The season officially started on May&nbsp;15 in the Eastern Pacific—east of 140°W—and began on June&nbsp;1 in the Central Pacific—the region between the International Date Line and 140°W–and ended on November&nbsp;30. These dates typically cover the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Eastern Pacific basin according to the National Hurricane Center. However, tropical cyclones sometimes form outside the bounds of an official season, as was evidenced by the formation of Tropical Depression One-E  on April&nbsp;25. The season effectively ended with the dissipation of its final storm, Tropical Storm Polo, on November&nbsp;19.\nThe formation of One-E on April&nbsp;25 marked the earliest start to a Pacific hurricane season on record. However, seasonal activity as a whole was generally below average. The season featured 16 named storms, in line with the 1981–2010 long-term average of 15. It featured just four hurricanes, or half the average. Three of those hurricanes intensified into major hurricanes,) and higher on the 5-level Saffir–Simpson scale are considered major hurricanes.|group=\"nb\"}} which compares to the average of four. A few storms produced substantial impact to land in 2020. In May, Tropical Storm Amanda caused widespread damage and killed numerous people in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. In August, the remnants of Tropical Storm Fausto sparked devastating wildfires across Northern California, while Genevieve produced hurricane-force winds and caused additional fatalities in the Baja California peninsula. Lesser but still deadly effects were produced there by Tropical Storm Hernan as well. A month prior, Hurricane Douglas passed very close to Oahu, though it caused only minor impact.\nThis timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included.\nBy convention, meteorologists use one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight&nbsp;UTC). Tropical cyclone advisories in the Eastern North Pacific basin use both UTC&nbsp;and the nautical time zone where the center of the tropical cyclone is currently located. Time zones utilized (east to west) are: Central, Mountain, Pacific and Hawaii. In this timeline, all information is listed by UTC first, with the respective regional time zone included in parentheses. Additionally, figures for maximum sustained winds and position estimates are rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;units (knots, miles, or kilometers), following National Hurricane Center practice. Direct wind observations are rounded to the nearest whole number. Atmospheric pressures are listed to the nearest millibar and nearest hundredth of an inch of mercury.\nTimeline\nApril\nApril 25\n*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:00&nbsp;p.m. PDT April&nbsp;24) at  Tropical Depression One-E forms from a low-pressure area about  southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula, becoming the earliest tropical cyclone on record in the East Pacific.
