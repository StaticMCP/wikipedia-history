(U.S.), Big Brother (UK and U.S.), Ex on the Beach (UK and U.S.), Survivor (Romania, Turkey and U.S.), Love Island (U.S.), So You Think You Can Dance, The Mole Germany, Exatlón Estados Unidos, Ibiza Weekender, The Bachelor & The Bachelorette (Australia), 12 Dates of Christmas, The Circle (U.S.), The Only Way Is Essex, Shipwrecked, and The Royal World competing for a share at up to a $500,000 prize.\nThe season premiered on October 25, 2023 with a simulcast on MTV2, preceded by a launch special titled \"Countdown Begins\" which aired on October 18, 2023.\nFormat\nBattle for a New Champion features 24 contestants who have previously competed on The Challenge but have not won a season. The season's prize pot starts at $300,000, however, money can be added to or removed from the pot based on the outcomes of certain challenges and eliminations.\nThe season has three formats (or \"phases\") called Control, Chaos, and Conquest.\n* Control (episodes 1-4): Players all compete together as one group to complete a challenge; if they are successful, $50,000 is added to the prize pot. Afterward, the contestants vote for one player (of either gender for the first three weeks and male for the fourth week due to uneven numbers) to compete in the elimination round (the \"Arena\"). The player who receives the most votes then calls out any player of the same gender as their opponent for the Arena. The winner remains in the game while the loser is eliminated.\n* Chaos (episodes 5-14): Players compete in challenges in pairs or in teams. The winners are immune and earn the power to nominate one player of the designated gender to potentially compete in the Arena. The house, besides the winners, then vote to nominate a second player of the same gender to potentially compete in the Arena. At the Arena, a former champion of The Challenge enters to compete against one of the nominated contestants, or a contestant of their choice, depending on the outcome of the Draw they partake in. If the selected contestant defeats the Champion, they remain in the competition, however, they are eliminated if they lose.\n* Conquest (episodes 15-17): Players compete in challenges and eliminations individually. The winner of each daily challenge is immune while the last-place player (of either gender) is eliminated. The nominations are determined by a chain of safety where the challenge winner selects another contestant (regardless of gender) to save from elimination; the saved contestant then selects the next contestant to save, with this process continuing until three contestants are not saved. The three contestants who are not saved compete in a private elimination round. The winner(s) remain in the competition while the losers are eliminated.\nAfter all three phases, the final seven contestants compete in the Final Challenge to determine the champion of the season.\n;Twists\n* Champions: During the \"Chaos\" format, ten previous champions of The Challenge appear to compete against contestants in a one-off elimination round. If the champions win their elimination, they are awarded $10,000 from the season's prize pot.\n** The Draw: Each entering Champion partakes in the Draw by randomly choosing between three covered poles to determine their opponent for the elimination round: one pole with the name of each nominated player and a third \"Chaos\" pole which allows them to choose any non-immune contestant as their opponent.\n*Purge Challenges: During the \"Conquest\" format, players who finish last in each challenge were immediately eliminated from the game.\n*Double Elimination: Episode 16 and 17's Conquest Elimination were double eliminations where only one contestant remained in the game while the two losing contestants were eliminated.\nContestants\n{|\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n!

The remaining six group members must solve a math equation, then, from a control tower, direct the buggy drivers to their correct positions to replicate the equation. To fully replicate the equation, the passengers must also arrange large plus and minus signs into their correct position. The group then repeat this process, attempting to solve and replicate as many of the four equations as possible within 30 minutes. For each equation solved and replicated within 30 minutes, $10,000 is added to the pot, and a bonus $10,000 is awarded if all four equations are completed.\n**Result: Passed ($50,000 earned)\n*Under Control: The group must swim to 25 buoys in the water, collect puzzle pieces submerged below, and use them to solve five puzzles located on floating pontoons.
