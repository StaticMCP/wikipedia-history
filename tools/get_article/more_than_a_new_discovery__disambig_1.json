It was recorded during 1966 and released early in the following year on the Verve Folkways imprint of the Verve Records label.\nThe name of the label was later changed to Verve Forecast and the album was re-issued on that label as The First Songs in 1969. This re-issue has a different track order and revised cover design. It peaked at No. 97 on the Billboard 200, then known as the Pop Albums chart. Starting with this release, the song \"Hands Off the Man\" was retitled \"Flim Flam Man (Hands Off the Man)\".\nColumbia Records re-issued The First Songs with all-new cover art (featuring a rose illustration) in 1973.\nIn 1999 the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2008 Rev-Ola Records released a remastered version of the original album on Compact Disc with the original song order and the original cover art.\nProduction\nNyro signed a contract with Verve Folkways after she gained recognition when Peter Paul and Mary recorded her song \"And When I Die\" in 1966.\nThe album was recorded in the fall of 1966 with Herb Bernstein as arranger and Milton Okun as producer. There was some uncertainty about Nyro's ability to lead the musicians by playing piano. As a result, pianist Stan Free was hired and Nyro was encouraged to play the guitar instead, an idea which she rejected.\nSongs\n\"Wedding Bell Blues\" was released as a single in September 1966 and remained on the \"Bubbling Under\" segment of the Billboard Hot 100 (then \"Pop Singles\") for 12 weeks, peaking at No. 103.\nFor the single version of \"Stoney End\", Nyro was forced to rework some of the lyrics that referred to the Bible, because Verve felt it would cause too much controversy.\nThe album included several songs that would become hits for other artists. Blood, Sweat & Tears scored with \"And When I Die\" (US No. 2), the 5th Dimension with \"Wedding Bell Blues\" (US No. 1) and \"Blowin' Away\" (US No. 21), and Barbra Streisand with \"Stoney End\" (US No. 6) and \"Flim Flam Man\" (US No. 82).\nTrack listing\nMore Than a New Discovery\nThe First Songs\nPersonnel\n* Laura Nyro – guitar, keyboards, vocals, songwriter\n* Jay Berliner – guitar\n* Stan Free – piano\n* Bill LaVorgna – drums\n* Buddy Lucas – harmonica\n* Lou Mauro – double bass\n* James Sedlar – French horn\n* Herb Bernstein – arranger, conductor, flugelhorn\n;Technical\n* Milton Okun – producer\n* Jean Goldhirsch – assistant producer\n* Jerry Schoenbaum – production supervision\n* Val Valentin – director of engineering\n* Harry Yarmark – engineer\n* Murray Laden – photography\nReferences\n;Bibliography\n* Michele Kort's biography Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro ()\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [http://www.LauraNyro.com Laura Nyro web site]"
