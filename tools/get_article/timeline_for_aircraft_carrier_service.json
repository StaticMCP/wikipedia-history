The earliest experiments consisted of fitting temporary \"flying off\" platforms to the gun turrets of the warships of several nations, notably the United States and the United Kingdom. The first ship to be modified with a permanent flight deck was the battlecruiser , which initially had a single flying-off deck forward of the original superstructure. Subsequently, she was modified with a separate \"landing on\" deck aft and later with a full flush deck. Other ships, often liners, were modified to have full flush flight decks,  being the first to have such modification begun. Those first faltering steps gave little indication of just how important the aircraft carrier was to prove to be. During the inter-war years (between the World Wars), Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States built up significant carrier fleets so that by the beginning of World War II, they had 18 carriers between them. The 1940 Battle of Taranto and 1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor in retrospect showed the world that the aircraft carrier was to be the most important ship in the modern fleet. Today, aircraft carriers are the capital ships of the navies they serve in, and in the case of modern US \"supercarriers\", they embark an air group that is effectively a small air force.\nThis timeline is an attempt to provide a unified chronology of key dates in carrier service. Aircraft carriers often serve their navies for many decades and this chronology enables the reader to track the progress of the carrier as it has developed alongside the evolution of aircraft for nearly a hundred years.\nPre-carrier history\ntakes off in a Curtiss Model D biplane from ]]\n1849\n* On 12 July 1849, the Austrian Navy ship  was used for launching incendiary balloons. A number of small Montgolfiere hot air ballons were launched with the intention of dropping bombs on Venice. Although the attempt largely failed due to contrary winds which drove the balloons back over the ship, one bomb did land on the city.\n1907\n* The British Admiralty, according to legend, politely refused the Wright brothers' offer to sell them one or more aircraft, by saying that they could see no place for aviation in naval circles.\n1910\n* 14 November – First successful launch of an aircraft from a ship, using a temporary wooden platform for a flight deck on the stationary cruiser .\n1911\n* 18 January – First deck landing, using a temporary wooden platform on the at anchor ; first use of a tailhook-arrested landing system.\n1912\n* 10 January – First launch of an aircraft from a British ship, Charles Samson flies off a platform fixed to the front of the stationary battleship .\n* 2 May – First recorded flight from a moving ship, Samson flies off , steaming at 10.5 knots.

If the carrier was a conversion from another ship, then the first date listed is when she was taken in hand to be converted; however, if a carrier was subsequently redesignated, its history is followed until disposal. The first time a ship is named in the list, it is linked to the relevant page within Wikipedia; if the ship was renamed, the first instance of the new name is also linked. Additionally, key relevant historical dates are interspersed with the ship-related dates to provide context.\nFor the purposes of this timeline, an aircraft carrier is a commissioned naval ship with at least one permanent flush deck designed for the launch and recovery of fixed-wing aircraft. This timeline does not include ships with temporary landing or take-off platforms, vessels designed for helicopter operations, marine assault ships of various designs, catapult ships, WWII escort carriers, merchant aircraft carriers, CAM ships, nor seaplane carriers and tenders.\nThe timeline is mainly divided into decades, the exceptions being the two World Wars and the interwar period, which are each treated as separate blocks. For the purposes of this list, the First World War is considered to have started on 28 June 1914 and ended 11 November 1918, while the Second World War is considered to have started on 1 September 1939 and ended 14 August 1945.\nThe actual text of the message from the First Lord of the Admiralty to the Wright Brothers, dated 7 March 1907, taken from The Old Flying Days by Charles Cyril Turner, p.&nbsp;293, was:\nCitations\nuss kitty hawk citation 1980–1981\nReferences\nBooks\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nArticles\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nWeb Sites\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n&nbsp;\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20120617231949/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/nav_legacy.asp?id=45 USS Cabot (CVL-28)]\n*\n*\n* \"[http://www.ffaa.net/ships/aircraft-carrier/foch/foch.htm CV FOCH (R 99)]\", \"[http://www.ffaa.net/ships/aircraft-carrier/clemenceau/clemenceau.htm CV CLEMENCEAU (R 98)]\", Carriers, French Fleet Air Arm, Retrieved 24 September 2008\n* \"[http://www.navy.gov.au/w/index.php/hmas-melbourne-ii HMAS Melbourne (II)]\", \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20160121154219/http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-sydney-iii HMAS Sydney (III)]\", \"[http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-vengeance HMAS Vengeance]\", HMA Ship Histories, Sea Power Centre, Royal Australian Navy official web site, Retrieved 13 September 2008\n* \"[http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/russia/aircraft_carriers/admiral_kuznetsov/admiral_kuznetsov_data.htm Admiral Flota Sovetskogo Soyuza Kuznetsov]\", \"[http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/russia/aircraft_carriers/baku/baku_data.htm Baku]\", \"[http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/russia/aircraft_carriers/kiev/kiev_data.htm Kiev]\", \"[http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/russia/aircraft_carriers/kiev_class_overview.htm Kiev Class Overview]\", \"[http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/russia/aircraft_carriers/minsk/minsk_data.htm Minsk]\",\"[http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/russia/aircraft_carriers/novorossiyk/novorossiysk_data.htm Novorossiysk]\", Maritime Quest, maritimequest.com, Retrieved 15 October 2008\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090302123347/http://www.btinternet.com/~warship/Postwar/Carriers/audacious.htm Audacious Class Fleet Aircraft Carriers]\", \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20081203215015/http://www.btinternet.com/~warship/Postwar/Carriers/colossus.htm Colossus Class Light Fleet Aircraft Carriers]\", The Royal Navy Postwar, Retrieved 1 November 2008 (archived links)\nOther\n* \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20101222022127/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_191634.pdf Securing Britain in an Age of Uncertainty: The Strategic Defence and Security Review]\", HM Government (2010), pp.&nbsp;75, , Retrieved 16 February 2011\nExternal links\n* [http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/ESCORT/ Royal Navy Escort Carriers]\n* [http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/carriers World Aircraft Carriers List, Haze Gray & Underway]"
