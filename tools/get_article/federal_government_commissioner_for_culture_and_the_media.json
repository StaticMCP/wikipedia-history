Since cultural policy in Germany falls under the jurisdiction of the states of Germany, there is no Ministry of Culture at the federal level in Germany.\nIn 2018, around 260 employees worked for the Commissioner in Bonn and Berlin on issues relating to culture and media; the budget amounted to €1.67 billions. In December 2021, there were already around 400 employees and €2.14 billion for culture and media in the federal budget. The Minister of State for Culture is not a federal minister, but a parliamentary state secretary who, because the office belonged to the Chancellor's Office from 1998 to 2013, bears the title of Minister of State (Staatsminister). As such, he has no voting rights in the Federal Cabinet.\nActivities\nThe primary tasks include continuously developing and improving the legal framework for the cultural and media sectors through federal legislation, promoting cultural institutions and projects of national importance, ensuring the cultural representation of the federal government in the federal capital Berlin, representing Germany's cultural and media policy interests in various international bodies, promoting nationally significant memorial sites commemorating the victims of Nazi Germany, and working with memorial sites and institutions to remember the injustices committed in the former GDR. Its responsibilities also include film promotion, the protection of cultural heritage, and leading the federal government's media policy (e.g., financing the international broadcaster Deutsche Welle).\nThe staff of the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media is responsible for a number of organizations and institutions, including the German Federal Archives, the German National Library the Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship, the  Holocaust Memorial and other national memorial sites. Until the dissolution of the Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic (BStU), this federal authority was part of the BKM's remit.\nThe authority is also responsible for awarding numerous prizes and scholarships, such as the Pour le Mérite, the German Film Prize, the German Screenplay Prize, the Innovation Prize, and the foreign scholarship at the Villa Massimo in Rome or at the German Study Center in Venice.\nHistory\nThe office was created in 1998 by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and was intended to consolidate activities that had previously been spread across various ministries. Michael Naumann became the first Minister of State for Culture in February 1999.\nOffice holders\n{| class=\"wikitable zebra\"\n!No.\n!Name\n!Time in office\n!Party\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |1\n|Michael Naumann\n| align=\"center\" |1999–2000\n|SPD\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |2\n|Julian Nida-Rümelin\n| align=\"center\" |2001–2002\n|SPD\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |3\n|Christina Weiss\n| align=\"center\" |2002–2005\n|independent\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |4\n|Bernd Neumann\n| align=\"center\" |2005–2013\n|CDU\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |5\n|Monika Grütters\n| align=\"center\" |2013–2021\n|CDU\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |6\n|Claudia Roth\n| align=\"center\" |2021–2025\n|Greens\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |7\n|Wolfram Weimer\n| align=\"center\" |2025–\n|independent\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.kulturstaatsminister.de/ Official Website]"
