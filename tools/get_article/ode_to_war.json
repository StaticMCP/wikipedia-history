It is part of the work Odes Moral and Descriptive.\nPoem\nDread Offspring of Tartarian birth,\n''Whose nodding crest is stain'd with gore,\nWhom to some giant-son of Earth,\nStrife in strong pangs of childbed bore;\n0 War! fierce monster, homicide,\nWho marchest on with hideous stride,\nShaking thy spear distilling blood;\nBellona thee, in angry mood,\nTaught proud Ambition's spoils to win,\nAmidst the loud, conflicting din\nOf arms, where Discord's gorgon-featured form\nHigh shakes her flaming torch amidst the martial storm.\nStern God! wolf-hearted, and accursed,\nFoster'd by Power, by Rapine nursed,\nOppression ever in thy train,\nFor hapless man prepares her chain:\nA thousand vulture-forms beside\nStalk on before thee; bloated Pride,\nThick-eyed Revenge, his soul on fire,\nAnd Slaughter breathing threatenings dire,\nTumult, and Rage, and Fury fell,\nAnd Cruelty, the imp of hell,\nHer heart of adamant! and arm'd her hand\nWith iron hooks, and cords, and Desolation's brand.\nThere, where the Battle loudest roars,\nWhere wide the impurpled deluge pours,\nAnd ghastly Death, his thousands slain,\nWhirls his swift chariot o'er the plain,\nRapt in wild Horror's frantic fit,\n'Midst the dire scene thou lov'st to sit,\nTo catch some wretch's parting sigh,\nTo mark the dimly-glazing eye,\nThe face into contortions thrown,\nConvuls'd: the deep, deep-lengthening groan,\nThe frequent sob, the agonizing smart,\nAnd nature's dread release, the pang that rends the heart.\nAvaunt, from Albion's isle! not there\nThy arms, and maddening car prepare,\nNor bid thy crimson banners fly\nTerrific, through the troubled sky;\nBut stay thee in thy wild career;\nLay by thy glittering shield and spear,\nThy polished casque, and nodding crest,\nAnd let thy sable steeds have rest:\nAt length, the work of slaughter close,\nAnd give to Europe's sons repose,\nBid the hoarse clangors of the trumpet cease,\nAnd smooth thy wrinkled front to meet the smiles of Peace.''\nOther Ode to War's\nMark R Slaughter wrote another poem entitled Ode to War in 1957. Brenda Munday Gifford also wrote a poem in reference to the Vietnam War.\nReferences"
