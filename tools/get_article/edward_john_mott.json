Although severely wounded in the eye, Sergeant Mott made a rush for the gun and after a fierce struggle seized the gunner and took him prisoner, capturing the gun. It was due to the dash and initiative of this NCO that the left flank attack succeeded.\nThe Medal\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041028141333/http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/oxfordsh.htm Location of grave and VC medal] (Oxfordshire)"
