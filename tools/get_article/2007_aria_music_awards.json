Due to the membership of Tomas Wylder (Switzerland), Jim Sclavunos (United States), and James Johnston (UK), the band does not qualify as Australian. In rebellion against this ruling, Cave unofficially inducted Mick Harvey, Warren Ellis, Conway Savage and Martyn P. Casey of the Bad Seeds; as well as Rowland S. Howard and Tracy Pew of the Birthday Party; \"by the power vested in [him] by this award\". Cave did not name Hugo Race of the Bad Seeds nor Phill Calvert of The Birthday Party, who are Australian, in his unofficial induction. He did, however, close by thanking his mother, wife and sons.\nChannel V Oz Artist of the Year award\n*Evermore\n**Silverchair\n**The Veronicas\n**Kisschasy\nPerformers\nIt was announced that the following artists were the special performers of the event:\nMain Show\n*Powderfinger\n*Silverchair\n*The John Butler Trio with Keith Urban\n*Missy Higgins\n*Sneaky Sound System\n*Gotye\n*Operator Please\n*Kate Miller-Heidke\nRed-Carpet\n*Ricki-Lee Coulter\n*The Veronicas\nControversy\nThe broadcast of the 2007 awards was controversial; it was revealed by Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)'s Media Watch that Channel 10 had used subliminal advertising—which is illegal under Australian Media and Broadcasting rules—TEN disputed the finding, however their defence was also criticised by Media Watch, as demonstrating ignorance of these rules.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090305093113/http://www.ariaawards.com.au/home.php ARIA Awards official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071118143950/http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-year.php?year=2007 List of 2007 winners]"
