In 1403, Stephen Ostoja of Bosnia sided with King Ladislaus of Naples in his plights against the Hungarian King Sigismund, Bosnia's liege. King Ostoja led a war against Ragusa, at the time an ally of Hungary.\nRadič Sanković led the attacks on Dubrovnik in the name of Stephen Ostoja.  Sandalj Hranić captured and blinded Radič, and held him in prison until his death in 1404. Among the fallen noblemen were Vukosav Nikolić and the Duke of Slano, whose name has been unfortunately lost to time.\nThe Ragusans set fire to Šumet and Žrnovnica, so the Bosnian army retreated.\nReferences"
