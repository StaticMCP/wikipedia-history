It was broadcast on TV Tokyo from April 1998 to January 1999, and was the first Transformers anime to be produced by Nihon Ad Systems and animated by the studio Ashi Productions. The series was preceded by Beast Wars: Transformers, and was followed by Super Life-Form Transformers: Beast Wars Neo. The series has a much lighter tone and is aimed more toward children, whereas the more accessible Beast Wars was intended for a wider age-range. The anime uses conventional animation rather than the CGI of its predecessor. With the exception of the faction leaders, all of the characters within the toy-line are either remolds, reissues, or recolors of earlier Beast Wars or Generation 2/Machine Wars toys.\nIn addition to the 43 episodes, there is also a 50-minute movie, ''Beast Wars II: Lio Convoy's Close Call!, which takes place sometime between episodes 32 and 38, and a manga adaptation by Shōji Imaki that was serialized in Comic BomBom from July 1998 to February 1999, also localized in Korea by Daewon Media. The anime was also released in Korea, and it was broadcast on SBS.\nPlot\nBeast Wars II'' tells the story of a battle waging between Lio Convoy's team of Cybertrons (Maximals) and Galvatron's army of Destrons (Predacons) on the planet Gaia. As Lio Convoy and Galvatron fight over the mysterious energy source known as Angolmois Energy, many strange occurrences and mysterious properties of Angolmois Energy begin to arise.\nCharacters\nMain characters\n* Maximals — Descendants of the Autobots who defend post-apocalyptic Earth, or Gaia, and its Angolmois Energy from the Predacons.\n** Lio Convoy — The battle-hardened yet kind, honest, and gentle commander of a Maximal crew based in the starship Star Voyager, with a strong sense of right and wrong. After being lured into a trap by Galvatron and crash-landing on Gaia, Lio Convoy was rescued by a white lion and brought to a cave laced with Angolmois Energy, which healed his injuries. Afterward, he adopted the lion's form as an alternate mode.\n** Apache — Lio Convoy's cool-headed yet mildly eccentric second-in-command and a triple-changer who can transform into a mandrill and a weapon-laden fortress mode.\n** Bighorn — A gentle and nature-loving yet battle-hungry warrior who can transform into a bison and gets angry at the sight of the color red. In combat, he wields the \"Buffalo Missile\" gun.\n** Scuba — A cool, shy, solitary, and pessimistic Maximal who can transform into a squid and specializes in underwater combat\n** Tasmania Kid — An adventurous prankster and the youngest member of Lio Convoy's group who can transform into a Tasmanian devil, wields the \"Tasmania Fangs\", specializes in close-quarters combat, and desires to be recognized as a full-fledged warrior.\n** Diver — A prudent yet timid and careless Niagara base guard who can transform into a frog and usually tries to avoid dangerous work by claiming it is his grandfather's dying wish, though he will charge into battle for his friends.\n* Predacons — Descendants of the Decepticons who seek to conquer Cybertron and the universe via the power of Angolmois Energy.\n** Galvatron — An idealistic and fastidious Predacon emperor and triple-changer who can transform into a mechanical dragon and an armored drilling vehicle.

Seeking increased power, Dirge agrees to let Gigastorm give him an Angolmois Energy transfusion, which reformats the former into Dirgegun and grants the ability to transform into a cyborg wasp.\n** Thrust — A Predacon partnered with Dirge who can transform into a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor fighter jet and behaves similarly to a stand-up comedian, to Dirge's chagrin.
