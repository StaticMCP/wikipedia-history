He was someone who had given up preferment to devote himself to God.\nShe would learn sections of the bible and, it was said that, she could recall a sermon she had heard almost word perfect. Every day she would use the notes of Giovanni Diodati to assist her in reading six chapters of the bible.

He had inherited a debt of £132,000 from the previous Earl and he married her, in part, to reduce that burden.\nHer husband had supported the King, before they married in a war against the Scots. After they married and as the civil war progressed he sided with Parliament and he attended the House of Lords.\nTheir first child was named Essex Howard and she was followed by two sons. One of these died young and another died unbaptised.\nHer husband was arrested during the civil war and her father, Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland, was involving in leading a faction who intended to put Charles back on the throne by force. The force of 600 men was defeated and he was tried for treason by his peers. He was executed in March 1649. Susanna Howard was ill and she lived until 19 May 1649. She was 22 when she died of an infection and she was buried at St Mary the Virgin church in Saffron Walden.\nReferences"
