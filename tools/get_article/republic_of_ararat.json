It was located in the Armenian highlands, centred on Karaköse Province. \"Agirî\" is the Kurdish name for Ararat.\nHistory\nThe Republic of Ararat, led by the central committee of Xoybûn party, declared independence on 28 October 1927 or 1928, during a wave of rebellion among Kurds in southeastern Turkey. As the leader of the military was appointed Ihsan Nuri, and Ibrahim Heski was put in charge of the civilian government.\nAt the first meeting of Xoybûn, Ihsan Nuri Pasha was declared the military commander of the Ararat Rebellion. Ibrahim Heski was made the leader of the civilian administration. In October 1927, Kurd Ava, or Kurdava, a village near Mount Ararat, was designated as the provisional capital of Kurdistan. Xoybûn made appeals to the Great Powers and the League of Nations and also sent messages to other Kurds in Iraq and Syria to ask for co-operation. But under the pressure from Turkey, the British Empire as well as France imposed restrictions on the activities of the members of Xoybûn.\nIn the spring of 1930, Ferzende Beg visited Ali Can, the leader of the local Kurdish Berazi tribe, and asked him to join the Ararat uprisings. As a result, Ali Can attacked the detachment in the former Karayazı sub-district of Hasankale with his 40 cavalrymen on July 7, 1930, and a 3-month-long rebellion began. After further success, the districts of Tutak, Bulanık, Karaçoban, Köprüköy, Hınıs and Karayazı were annexed to the Ararat State.\nThe Turkish Armed forces subsequently defeated the Republic of Ararat in September 1931.\nFlag of the Republic of Ararat\n, Ihsan Nuri Pasha, Hasenanlı Ferzende Bey]]\nThe flag first appeared during the movement for Kurdish independence from the Ottoman Empire and resembles an earlier version created by the Xoybûn (Khoyboun) organization, active in the Ararat rebellion of 1930, and flown by the break-away Republic of Ararat during the period 1927–1931.\nSee also\n* List of Kurdish dynasties and countries\n* Flag of Kurdistan\nReferences\nNotes\nReferences"
