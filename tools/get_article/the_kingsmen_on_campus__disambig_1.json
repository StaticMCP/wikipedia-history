The album entered the Billboard Top LPs chart on October 30, 1965, and remained for 17 weeks, peaking at #68.\nThe album received mixed reviews and only a two-star rating from AllMusic where Joe Viglione's review stated, \"... it is obvious the band loved classic R&B. Too bad they couldn't inject it into their performances on record. Despite the lack of passion, \"The Climb\" ranks with \"Annie Fanny\" as the best two tracks to be found in the grooves of The Kingsmen on Campus.\" Melody Maker's review said, \"An obviously talented and experienced combo, they often come up with some nice sounds and some good bluesy organ and then suddenly a relapse into gooey rubbish.\"\nThe album's sales and chart tenure were supported by the ongoing controversy over the lyrics of \"Louie Louie\" and the Kingsmen's extensive touring schedule.  As with earlier albums, crowd noise was dubbed on some tracks to simulate a live performance.  The back of the LP jacket featured a collage of college and university pennants emblematic of the Kingsmen's reputation as a \"frat rock\" and college concert band.\nThe LP was released in both mono (WDM 670) and stereo (WDS 670) versions.  International releases included Canada (Reo 682), South Africa (Scepter SLP 6003), and United Kingdom (Pye International NPL 28068). In 1994 Sundazed and Bear Family reissued the album on CD with bonus tracks \"Get Out of My Life Woman\", \"Don't Say No\" and \"My Wife Can't Cook\", all previously released only as singles, and with crowd noise overdubs removed on all tracks.\nA reference to the album cover occurs in the 2003 movie Old School when the main characters, dressed in cardigan sweaters, walk down the Janss Steps located on the UCLA campus.\nTrack listing\n# Annie Fanny &ndash; 2:05 (Lynn Easton)\n# Rosalie &ndash; 3:09 (Robin Roberts)\n# A Hard Day's Night &ndash; 2:21 (John Lennon, Paul McCartney)\n# Stand By Me &ndash; (3:47) (Ben E.
