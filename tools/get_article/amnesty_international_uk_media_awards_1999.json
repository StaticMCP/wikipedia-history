The awards were hosted by Moira Stuart.\nThe overall winner was BBC TV Panorama's \"When Good Men Do Nothing\", which covered the historical failures which had led to the situation in Rwanda and genocide.\nDavid Bull, Director of Amnesty International UK, said: \"Those working to defend human rights depend on the work of journalists whose dedication and determination help to expose injustice, torture and political killings. In a year that has seen continuing gross human rights violations around the world, including the unfolding tragedy of Kosovo, the role of the media in reporting these abuses of basic human rights has never been more vital\".\nThe special award for human rights journalism under threat was awarded to Najam Sethi for his work as editor of the Pakistani national newspaper The Friday Times. He was unable to attend the awards as he had been arrested in Pakistan.\nThe awards also highlighted the work of Mark Thomas, which was not entered into the competition. Thomas used his series The Mark Thomas Comedy Product to attend Defendory, a trade show for the arms industry. He claimed to be offering PR training to governments and military regimes on how to present a better public image on human rights abuse. His services were sought by the governments of Kenya and Indonesia. Whilst offering these spoof services, Thomas and his assistants filmed Indonesian government officials admitting that the armed forces used torture. The reactions of government departments and arms manufacturers also featured.\nPierre Sané, AI's secretary general, addressed advances in human rights with the establishment of an International Criminal Court to try those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity, and in the arrest of General Pinochet. He also pointed to ongoing issues when he said, \"But the reports from Kosovo, from the death cells of the USA, and from Sierra Leone also remind us that it has been an appalling year.\"\nThe judges for all categories were Andy Blackmore, Romesh Gunesekera, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Mark Lattimer, Jenni Murray, Geoffrey Robertson QC and Mary Ann Sieghart.\nShortlist and Awards 1999\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"centre\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ffdead\" align=\"center\"| 1999\n|-\n! width=20% | Category\n! width=30% | Title\n! width=23% | Organisation\n! width=22% | Journalists\n! width=5% | Refs\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | National Print\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 'In Diana's footsteps'\n| align=\"center\" | The Observer\n| align=\"center\" | John Sweeney\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | '''series 'Kosovo: Human rights ignored'\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | The Guardian\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | Jonathan Steele\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | Series on death row in the USA\n| align=\"center\" | Daily Mirror\n| align=\"center\" | Anton Antonowicz\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | Sudan article\n| align=\"center\" | Daily Express\n| align=\"center\" | Ros Wynne-Jones\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f2f2f2\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | Periodicals'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 'Human Rights Law Survey'\n| align=\"center\" | The Economist\n| align=\"center\" | David Manasian\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | Judgement Day\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | The Mail on Sunday Review\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | Julia Stuart\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 'Scarred by Hate'\n| align=\"center\" | Marie Claire\n| align=\"center\" | Emma Brooker\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 'The Lost Boys'\n| align=\"center\" | Granta\n| align=\"center\" | Anna PyasetskayaHeidi Bradner\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f2f2f2\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | Photojournalism\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | Suffering in Kosovo\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | The Guardian and Observer\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | Andrew Testa\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 'The War the West Forgot'\n| align=\"center\" | The Independent Magazine\n| align=\"center\" | Dean Chapman\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 'Two Funerals in Kosovo'\n| align=\"center\" | The Independent on Sunday\n| align=\"center\" | David Rose\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f2f2f2\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | Radio\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 'Arrest General Pinochet\n| align=\"center\" | BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight\n| align=\"center\" | presented by Robin Lustig\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | Civilian\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | BBC Radio 4:From our Own Correspondent\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | reported by Jeremy Vine\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" |\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 'The Choice'\n| align=\"center\" | BBC Radio 4\n| align=\"center\" | Lim Guan Eng & Tim Parr,presented by Michael Buerk,\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f2f2f2\"|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | Special Award forHuman Rights JournalismUnder Threat\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ffff50;\" | Najam Sethi ()He was unable to receive his award in person, as he was prevented from boarding a plane in Lahore en route to London.
