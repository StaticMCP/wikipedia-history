While term limits have been scrapped in 2010 following a constitutional reform, incumbent president Ismaïl Omar Guelleh who won a fifth term in 2021, has been president since 1999. Originally ineligible for a sixth term due to the age limit of 75 that Guelleh imposed as part of the reforms, Djibouti passed a constitutional amendment in 2025 that lifted age limits, allowing him to run again.\nBackground\nIsmaïl Omar Guelleh, president since 1999, was re-elected five times, most recently in 2021. While scrapping term limits in a 2010 constitutional reform, Guelleh also imposed an age limit of 75. Thus, he was term-limited. Despite this, he had expressed interest in running again. On October 26, 2025, the Djiboutian parliament passed a bill lifting age limits for the presidency, enabling Guelleh to run for a sixth term. In November 2025, Guelleh officially announced that he would be a candidate.\nReferences"
