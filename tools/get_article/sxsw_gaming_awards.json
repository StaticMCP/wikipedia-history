The Awards were part of the SXSW Gaming Expo which is part of the SXSW Interactive branch of the festival.\nHistory\nVideo games had been part of the SXSW within the SXSW Interactive branch. in 2006, the festival launched \"Screenburn\" as a special portion of the Interactive branch for video games, and later renamed this to SXSW Gaming in 2013.\nMatthew Crump, a veteran game developer, joined SXSW in 2012 and spearheaded the efforts to create the SXSW Gaming Awards to premiere during the 2014 festival. The new awards in fifteen different categories were announced in September 2013 to be awarded during the 2014 festival. However, Crump died from a heart attack just before the festival. The event organizers opted to rename the \"Cultural Innovation in Gaming\" to the \"Matthew Crump Cultural Innovation Award\" to honor Crump's contributions to the festival.\nThe Gaming Awards were discontinued by SXSW in 2023 due to a desire to \"streamline our festival a bit more.\"\nFormat\nDevelopers and publishers must submit their games for consideration to the festival organizers prior to a deadline; these games generally must have had public release in the preceding calendar year to the festival (for example, for the inaugural 2014 awards, games had to be released in 2013).\nThe festival's organizers along with a panel of industry experts review all submissions and select the top five for each of the game categories. These are then opened to public voting for the final winner for each award to be chosen.\nThe Gamer's Voice awards are exceptional to these: they are limited only to indie games released in the previous calendar year or the current year, and which any member of the public may nominate. The festival organizers select multiple games (typically more than five) after playing through each as nominees for the award. These games are featured in playable form at the SXSW festival to allow attendees to try them before they vote for their favorite.\nThe awards ceremony is held near the end of the SXSW event, with celebrity and gaming hosts presenting the awards.\nThe 2020 SXSW event was cancelled in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the award winners were still named online on March 24, 2020.\nCeremonies\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
