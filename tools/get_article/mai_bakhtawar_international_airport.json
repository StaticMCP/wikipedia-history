She was the first woman to lose her life during the peasant uprisings in Sindh in 1947.\nThe airport was built by the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan at a cost of Rs. 972.07 million, following a request from the Sindh Coal Authority to support the development of the nearby Thar coalfield. The Ministry of Defence granted clearance for its construction on 25 September 2009, as it is located within  of Pakistan's international border with India.\nThe airport has been constructed to accommodate Category-C aircraft in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, featuring a 7,000-foot runway.\nThe airport serves both civil and military air traffic. Although it was inaugurated on 11 April 2018, it has faced challenges in reaching full completion.\nSee also\n*List of airports in Pakistan\nReferences"
