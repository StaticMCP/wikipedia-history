After storage in various places including the town hall, the museum was eventually completed in 1997, but only two of the museums exhibition rooms opened in October 2002.\nNow located in a two-storey building, the Archaeological Museum of Aiani displays the history of ancient Aiani, capital of Elimiotis which was one of the most important kingdoms of Upper Macedonia.\nImportant collections include finds of the Late Bronze Age (1500 -1200 BC) and the Archaic and Classical periods (600 -500 BC), which provide an important insight into the formation of the Doric-Macedonian peoples in the region and the civilian and political development of Aiani, particularly during the Sixth Century B.C.\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-1-Arx_Aiani-3.jpg|A gold fibula from the 2nd half of the 6th century BC\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-1-Arx_Aiani-4.jpg|Vessels with matt-painted decoration from the 14th century BC\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-1-Arx_Aiani-5.jpg|Clay figurine of a kore (young woman), dated to the second half of the 6th century B.C.\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-1-Arx_Aiani-6.jpg|Clay figurine of ancient Greek Goddess Athena\nFile:Macedonian_Museums-1-Arx_Aiani-7.jpg|A clay stand with matt-painted decoration from the 14th century BC\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071219145534/http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/1/eh151.jsp?obj_id=3386 Hellenic ministry of culture]\n*[http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Museums/Archaeological_and_Byzantine/Arx_Aiani.html Macedonian heritage]"
