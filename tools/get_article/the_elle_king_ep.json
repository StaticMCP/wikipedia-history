The song \"Playing for Keeps\" was used as the theme song for Mob Wives Chicago. The second song written by King on the banjo, \"Good to Be a Man\",  resulted in her receiving a recording contract with RCA Records.\nKing mixed up various styles on the songs on her EP, from a defiant growl to mournful to lascivious. She doesn't believe that \"people listen to albums as a kind of whole, cohesive record anymore, anyway.\" She thinks that \"the one thing that ties through all my different sounds is my voice, and I think we're all just trying to figure out how to tie everything around that.\"\nTrack listing\n| extra_column = Producer\n| title1        = Playing for Keeps\n| writer1      = Elle King, Chris DeStefano\n| extra1       = Chris DeStefano\n| length1      = 3:37\n| title2       = Good to Be a Man\n| writer2      = E.
