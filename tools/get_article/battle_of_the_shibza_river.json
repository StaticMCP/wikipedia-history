It ended in a Russian victory.\nHistory\nOn February 10, General Yuri Bibikov launched the Anapa campaign of 1790 and crossed the Kuban River. Despite that harsh winter climate, with his troops not having been trained to fight in winter conditions, as well as constant skirmishes with Circassian fighters led by Sheikh Mansur, Bibikov continued his campaign.\nWith not much food left the Russian forces, on March 15, 1790, arrived at two gorges overlooking the Anapa plain. Going along the left gorge, he reached the Shibza River, where the exhausted Russian army was suddenly attacked by a 2,000 strong Ottoman–Circassian force led by Aji Mustafa Pasha. Despite the poor condition of the Russian troops, they managed to occupy the River heights and forced the enemy army to retreat after a short battle. Soon after, Bibikov continued his campaign, but he was accompanied by constant skirmishes with Circassian fighters led by Sheikh Mansur. Nevertheless, this did not stop him and he continued advancing towards Anapa, where he suffered a crushing defeat, which forced him to flee and end his campaign.\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\n*\nExternal links\n* [https://runivers.ru/conflicts/actions/boy_pri_shibze/ Battle of the Shibze (in Russian)]"
