      "text": "# Timeline of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe 1990 Atlantic hurricane season featured the most named storms of any hurricane season at the time. During the season, 14&nbsp;tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean became named storms. The season officially started on June 1, 1990, and ended on November 30. These dates, adopted by the convention, historically delimit the period each year when most Atlantic tropical systems form. However, storm formation is possible at any time of the year, as was the case this season, when Tropical Depression One formed on May&nbsp;24; Hurricane Nana, the season's final storm, dissipated on October&nbsp;21.\nThe season produced 16&nbsp;tropical depressions, of which 14 intensified into tropical storms, 8&nbsp;became hurricanes, and 1&nbsp;became a major hurricane.|group=\"nb\"}} Although the season had the highest number of named storms at the time, it featured only two notable storms, primarily because many of the tropical cyclones remained either weak or at sea. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of damage and loss of life, were Hurricane Diana and Tropical Storm Marco. However, the strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Hurricane Gustav.\nThis timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not operationally warned upon, has been included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.\nTimeline\nMay\n;May&nbsp;24\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression One develops roughly halfway between Limón, Honduras, and Cape San Antonio, Cuba.\n;May&nbsp;25\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT May&nbsp;24) &ndash; Tropical Depression One attains its peak intensity with winds of 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) All other units are rounded to the nearest digit.|group=\"nb\"}} and a minimum barometric pressure of 1007&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 29.74&nbsp;inHg).\n*Between 1200 and 1800&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m. and 2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression One makes landfall near Guasimal, Matanzas, Cuba with winds of 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h).\n;May&nbsp;26\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression One is absorbed by an approaching cold front while located about 45&nbsp;miles (70&nbsp;km) west of Key West, Florida.\nJune\n;June&nbsp;1\n*The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season officially begins.\nJuly\n;July&nbsp;22\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Two develops about 1,345&nbsp;miles (2,165&nbsp;km) east of Port-of-Spain, Trinidad.\n;July&nbsp;24\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Two intensifies into Tropical Storm Arthur.\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; A subtropical depression develops just offshore of North Carolina.\n;July&nbsp;25\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Arthur attains its peak intensity with winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 995&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 29.38&nbsp;inHg).\n;July&nbsp;27\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Arthur weakens to a tropical depression.\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; The subtropical depression acquires tropical characteristics and is reclassified as Tropical Depression Three.\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Depression Arthur dissipates south of Jamaica.\n;July&nbsp;28\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT July&nbsp;27) &ndash; Tropical Depression Three intensifies into Tropical Storm Bertha.\n;July&nbsp;29\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT July&nbsp;28) &ndash; Tropical Storm Bertha intensifies into a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane.\n*1800&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT) &ndash; Hurricane Bertha weakens to a tropical storm.\nnear peak intensity|alt=A satellite image of a loosely organized hurricane offshore of the Eastern United States]]\n;July&nbsp;30\n*1200&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; Tropical Storm Bertha re-intensifies into a Category 1&nbsp;hurricane.\n;July&nbsp;31\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT July&nbsp;31) &ndash; Tropical Depression Four develops south of Cape Verde.\nAugust\n;August&nbsp;2\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT August&nbsp;2) &ndash; Hurricane Bertha attains its peak intensity with winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 973&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 28.73&nbsp;inHg).\n*0000&nbsp;UTC (8:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT August&nbsp;2) &ndash; Tropical Depression Four intensifies into Tropical Storm Cesar.\n*0600&nbsp;UTC (2:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT) &ndash; Hurricane Bertha weakens to a tropical storm while making landfall near Sydney, Nova Scotia, with winds of 70&nbsp;mph (115&nbsp;km/h).
