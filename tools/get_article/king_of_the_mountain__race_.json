Since its first formal race in 1959 following a bet in the Railway Hotel in 1958, the race has become a local holiday involving the district schools and a carnival like atmosphere.\nCourse\nThe original course was from the Railway Hotel (now demolished) to the top of Mount Cooroora and back. The 1979–2021 course went from the ANZ Bank to the top and back. The 2022–Present course is 1&nbsp;km longer but still starts from the old ANZ Bank building.\nHistory\nIn 1958, Bruce Samuels, a local footballer and railway porter in the town ran to the top of Mount Cooroora as a hangover cure. After being called out, a timed run was held on 22 March 1958 with Samuels completing the run in 40 minutes. In 1959, Brisbane local Barry Webb took up the challenge and completed it in 35:00. On 27 June 1959, the first formal race was held with Frank Mainwaring taking the title with a time of 31:51.\nOn 1 March 2024, the Pomona Lions Club announced in a public statement that the race was permanently cancelled following a raft of strict conditions put in place by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS). In a public statement by the Department of Environment, Science and Innovation issued on 2 March, they said \"In recent years the entry numbers have been limited to 80 competitors at QPWS’s request, the only amendment requested this year has been that the start is staggered over two stages of 40 competitors each.\" The resulting public comment has called for the event to be held as per usual in July with the new condition inplace.\nInter-school challenge\nAs part of the festival, the inter-school relay is held on the morning of the race on the road surrounding Stan Topper Park. Some schools also partake in the inter-school tug-o-war competition.\nThe following schools participate:\n* Cooran State School\n* Cooroy State School\n* Gympie South State School\n* Pomona State School\n* St Andrew's Anglican College\nMain race winners\nBruce Samuels completed a timed run in 1958 to prove it was possible with a time of 35:00. Barry Webb was the first to take up the challenge in 1959 with a time of 40:00, shortly after that on 27 June 1959, Frank Mainwaring took the title in the first formal race involving 5 competitors.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year || colspan=2 | Male || colspan=2 | Female\n|-\n!

Although many people think the song is a reference to Peter Brock and the Bathurst 1000 held at Mount Panorama, drummer Rob Hirst confirmed the song is actually inspired by the footrace up Mount Cooroora and the surrounding natural beauty and unique history of the Noosa hinterland.\nReferences"
