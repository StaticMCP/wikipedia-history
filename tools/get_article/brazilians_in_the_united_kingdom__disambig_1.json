In part, this immigration of Brazilians to the UK is a consequence of the economic possibility of travel.\nContemporary history\noutside Stockwell Underground Station]]\nThe Brazilian community of the UK was brought into the global spotlight in 2005 as a result of the death of Jean Charles de Menezes. Menezes was a Brazilian national living and working in Tulse Hill, south London who on the morning of 22 July 2005 was misidentified as Hamdi Adus Isaac—one of the fugitives involved in the previous day's failed bombing attempts. This misidentification ultimately lead to a number of non-uniformed Metropolitan Police officers following Menezes into Stockwell tube station and onto a train, where he was shot in the head seven times.  The \"shoot to kill\" policy had been put in place after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The inquest that resulted was followed worldwide including by Menezes's family in Gonzaga, Minas Gerais, who set up the \"Justice4Jean\" campaign.\nDemographics\nPopulation\nThe 1991 Census recorded 9,301 Brazilian born people in the UK, and the 2001 Census recorded 15,215. In 2004, the Brazilian Consulate in London had 13,000 Brazilians registered as living in the UK. Office for National Statistics estimates suggest that there were 60,000 Brazilian-born people resident in the UK in 2009. The 2011 Census recorded 50,117 Brazilian-born residents in England, 453 in Wales, 1,194 in Scotland and 384 in Northern Ireland. The ONS estimates that in 2018, 87,000 people born in Brazil were living in the UK.\nSeveral older guesstimates of the Brazilian population in the UK in the mid-2000s put the number at around 200,000. The discrepancy between official and unofficial population estimates has also been observed in studies of Brazilians in the United States. It has been suggested that the discrepancy is due to Brazilians overstaying their visas, or only seeing their stays as temporary, and therefore not participating in surveys or censuses. The Brazilian consulate in London estimated that in 2020, there were 220,000 Brazilians in the UK.\nSpread and distribution\nThe majority of Brazilians in the UK reside in and around London. The 2001 Census showed that 8,000 people born in Brazil were residing in the capital, however in the same year other estimates suggested that were that between 15,000 and 50,000 Brazilians in London. In 2005, the BBC stated that the number of Londoners of Brazilian origin was approximately 60,000. Community groups estimated in 2007 that between 130,000 and 160,000 Brazilians were likely to be living in the London area. Within London, some 30,000 Brazilians were thought to reside in the Borough of Brent. Stockwell, south London is also home to a sizeable Brazilian community that lives alongside the UK's single largest Portuguese community in 'Little Portugal'. Bayswater in the City of Westminster has long been referred to as 'Brazilwater', indicating their heavy presence in the area.\nBesides the Brazilian community in London, there are numerous other locations in England with Brazilian populations. It is estimated that some 20,000 Brazilians reside in the Midlands (the majority in Birmingham), while some 15,000 Brazilians are thought to live in the county of Norfolk in East Anglia (most of these in King's Lynn and Norwich). The coastal town of Brighton was home to an estimated 10,000 Brazilians in 2005. 10,000 individuals of Brazilian origin also live in the Greater Manchester/Liverpool Urban Area.\nReligion\nBrazil is the world's largest Catholic nation, 50% adhere to the faith while 29% of Brazilians follow Protestantism. The largest Brazilian church in the UK is the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, which has temples in London and Birmingham. This church has been embroiled in scandals and accusations for some years. In 2000 a Brazilian Christian evangelical sect bought London radio station Liberty Radio (previously owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed). This purchase was surrounded by controversy largely due to the stations large established audience that could be influenced by the alleged corrupt church, which tells its followers that \"diseases are caused by demons and prayer can rid them of debt\". There are some 30 Brazilian evangelical churches in London. Further, many other denominations has a strong representation of Brazilians' communities in the UK including some special meetings in Portuguese language in the IPDA Igreja Pentecostal Deus e Amor-Pentecostal Church God is Love, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehova's Witnesses, Kardecists and others. There is a Brazilian Chaplaincy in East London, set up by the Catholic Church and run by Brazilian priests, who conduct mass in Portuguese to hundreds of Brazilians at weekends.\nCulture and community\nBusiness and economics\nAccording to analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research based on Labour Force Survey data for 2000 to 2004, 57.4 per cent of Brazilian-born immigrants arriving in the UK in 1990 or after were employed (as opposed to studying, unemployed or inactive), with 80.7 per cent arriving before 1990 employed. Despite being relatively well educated, the majority of Brazilian immigrants to the UK have taken up professions that differ greatly from their previous careers in Brazil. The majority of Brazilian-born migrants to the UK choose jobs that are for the most part unskilled and low-paid; the reasons behind this include restrictions imposed by their immigration status and lack or limited knowledge of the English language. This has also been witnessed in the Brazilian diaspora in United States. A study conducted by Queen Mary, University of London revealed the most common jobs taken up by Brazilian immigrants in London. 32 per cent of individuals surveyed were involved in the cleaning industry, 26 per cent in hotel work and catering, 13 per cent in other 'services'. 10 per cent worked as couriers, 9 per cent in the construction industry, 3 per cent as au pairs or baby sitters. 6 per cent of those surveyed choose not to answer, while 1 per cent told of unemployment. Work and employment is an extremely important aspect for Brazilians in the UK, especially first-generation immigrants – many of whom came to the UK for the sole reason of seeking employment. In the same study, 25 per cent of respondents said they came to the UK to work and/or study, while 24.3 per cent claimed to have come for work and to save money either to be able to permanently settle in the UK or to send to family back in Brazil. A large number of Brazilian-owned businesses have sprung up in the UK over recent decades. They include personal care, counselling, solicitors and lawyers that provide services in Portuguese, baby sitting, private cleaning, removals and transportation, travel agencies, private functions, money transfer, accommodation, as well as shops selling Brazilian clothing, food and drink, alongside numerous cafes and restaurants.\nMedia\nTelevision\nRede Record\nThe Brazilian television channel Rede Record was previously on Sky channel 801, and Record Radio was on 0206 at the same time.\nCreature Comforts\nThe 1989 animated short films produced by the Aardman Animations gives a humorous take on the voices of the British public spoken by animals.
