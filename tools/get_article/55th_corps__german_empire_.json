It was formed as a temporary Bernhardi Corps (named for its commander) on 6 June 1916 before being established on 1 October 1916.  It was still in existence at the end of the war.\nChronicle\nThe 55th Corps (z.b.V.) was formed as a temporary Bernhardi Corps on 6 June 1916, named for its commander General der Kavallerie Friedrich von Bernhardi.  On 1 October 1916, Bernhardi Corps was established as 55th Corps.\nWith the onset of trench warfare, the German Army recognised that it was no longer possible to maintain the traditional Corps unit, that is, one made up of two divisions.  Whereas at some times (and in some places) a Corps of two divisions was sufficient, at other times 5 or 6 divisions were necessary.  Therefore, under the Hindenburg regime (from summer 1916), new Corps headquarters were created without organic divisions.  These new Corps were designated\nGeneral Commands for Special Use ().\nBernhardi Corps was formed hastily in the summer of 1916 on the Austro-Hungarian front in the Volhynia region as a multi-national force defending against the Brusilov Offensive. German and Austrian troops were able to fend off the Russians in the area of the Styr and Stochid rivers.  After two years on the Eastern Front, the Corps was transferred to the Western Front in February 1918 where was engaged at Armentières.\nBy the end of the war, the Corps still serving on the Western Front as part of 6th Army, Heeresgruppe Kronprinz Rupprecht with the following composition:\n* 38th Division\n* 12th Bavarian Division\n* 5th Bavarian Division\n* two thirds 4th Ersatz Division\n* 9th Reserve Division\nCommanders\nThe 55th Corps was commanded by General der Kavallerie Friedrich von Bernhardi throughout its existence.\nSee also\n*German Army (German Empire)\n*German Army order of battle, Western Front (1918)\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*"
