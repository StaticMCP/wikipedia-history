Another bronze figure is found at the top of the memorial. It was restored in 2001.\nThe Ontario Heritage Foundation plaque for this memorial erroneously states that Walter Allward studied under Emanuel Hahn; in fact, it was the other way around.\nFor two decades after the war, Canadians would gather on February 27 (known in Canada as \"Paardeberg Day\") around memorials to the South African War to say prayers and honour veterans. This continued until the end of the First World War, when Armistice Day (later called Remembrance Day) began to be observed on November 11. The monument was unveiled in 1910 by Sir John French.\n1908 Toronto SouthAfrican War Memorial QueenSt.jpg|Unveiling of the memorial May 24, 1910\nSouth African War Memorial, Toronto (Fragment of the Top).jpg|Winged figure holding a golden crown at the top of the obelisk\nMonument-allward-toronto-africa.jpg|The base of Walter Seymour Allward's South African War Memorial in the winter\nBoer War Statue by Djuradj Vujcic.jpg|Close-up of the statue\nSee also\n* Canadian war memorials\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.toronto.ca/culture/public_art.htm South African War Memorial]\n* [http://sandstead.com/images/allward/south_african/ Photographs]"
