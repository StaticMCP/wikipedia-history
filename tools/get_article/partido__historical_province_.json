The Spanish divided the Bicol Region into two distinct areas at the present province of Camarines Sur, the southern part becoming known as the Partido.\nThe northern, upper portion included present-day Camalig, Albay, and all the towns of Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte, and was called “Partido de Camarines”. The southern portion comprised the region south of Camalig, Sorsogon, the islands of Masbate and Catanduanes, was called “Partido de Ibalon”, which was later simply called \"Partido\".\nThe proposed province of Nueva Camarines would be what was once the Partido.
