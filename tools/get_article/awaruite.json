It also occurs as a rare component of meteorites. It occurs in association with native gold and magnetite in placers; with copper, heazlewoodite, pentlandite, violarite, chromite, and\nmillerite in peridotites; with kamacite, allabogdanite, schreibersite and graphite in meteorites.\nIt was first described in 1885 for an occurrence along Gorge River, near Awarua Bay, South Island, New Zealand, its type locality.\nAwaruite is also known as josephinite in an occurrence in Josephine County, Oregon where it is found as placer nuggets in stream channels and masses in serpentinized portions of the Josephine peridotite. Some nuggets contain andradite garnet.\nAn occurrence of awaruite was examined as an ore mineral in a large low grade deposit in central British Columbia, some 90&nbsp;km northwest of Fort St. James. In the deposit awaruite occurs disseminated in the Mount Sidney Williams ultramafic/ophiolite complex.\nReferences"
