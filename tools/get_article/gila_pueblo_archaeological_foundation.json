It was founded in 1928 in Globe, Arizona, by Harold S. Gladwin and his wife, Winifred (McCurdy) Gladwin. The foundation ceased operations in 1950.\nBeginning\nHarold S. Gladwin was a former New York City stockbroker who eventually left his position and moved to Santa Barbara, California. In Santa Barbara, he met his future wife, Winifred, and William North Duane, who introduced Gladwin to his cousin, the archaeologist A.V. Kidder. Gladwin spent two field seasons with Kidder in northern Arizona, during which his passion and curiosity for the Southwest grew. This experience ultimately inspired him to establish the Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation.\nResearch\nWith Harold S. Gladwin's backing and funding, the Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation was able to conduct extensive excavations and research throughout the American Southwest. One of the most significant contributions made by the foundation was the definition of the Hohokam culture, a task in which the young archaeologist Emil Haury played a key role. In 1930, Haury became the assistant director of Gila Pueblo. Another major accomplishment of the foundation was the identification and definition of the Cochise culture.\nIn 1950, Gila Pueblo ceased operations and donated its collection to the Arizona State Museum, located on the University of Arizona campus. The collection was unveiled in 1951 during the inauguration of University of Arizona President Richard A. Harvill. The records of the foundation are held by the Arizona State Museum Library & Archives, with the finding aid available on [http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/search?keyword=gila+pueblo+foundation Arizona Archives Online]. The building that housed the foundation, now part of Eastern Arizona College, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110923041404/http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=%2Fmedallion The Medallion papers published by Gila Pueblo], all 39 available online.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902004342/http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/pproj/potqtvr.asp?cn=gp2538&ds=no Wingate Polychrome Bowl], the exterior of which was used as the Gila Pueblo logo."
