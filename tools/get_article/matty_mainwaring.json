He got the chance to meet at-the-time Manchester United player David Beckham.\nSpeaking after the programme in 2004, David Beckham said: \"What I think impressed me about Matthew was when he was up against another of the hotshots Mollie, he was giving her a little bit of a chance, whereas some young kids wouldn't care. They just want to do their best and go straight through whether it's a girl or a boy. But that's what impressed me, he was a caring person. He was congratulating Mollie and saying well done to her. That's what I realised and recognised throughout the day&nbsp;... and he's a great talent of course.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
