He received notification shortly before his death.\nClark Howard often won first place and placed second or third in the same year.\nDoug Allyn has won more often than any other author.\nLeigh Lundin (under the pseudonym L. Leigh) in 2006 became the first first-time writer to take first place in a major Ellery Queen award.\nDale Andrews, a student of the Ellery Queen canon, became the first to place with an Ellery Queen story.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.themysteryplace.com/eqmm/about/awards.shtml Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine awards page]"
