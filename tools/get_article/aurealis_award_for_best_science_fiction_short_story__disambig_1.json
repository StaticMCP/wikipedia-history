To qualify, a work must have been first published by an Australian citizen or permanent resident between 1 January and 31 December of the corresponding year; the presentation ceremony is held the following year. It has grown from a small function of around 20 people to a two-day event attended by over 200 people.\nSince their creation in 1995, awards have been given in various categories of speculative fiction. Categories currently include science fiction, fantasy, horror, speculative young adult fiction—with separate awards for novels and short fiction—collections, anthologies, illustrative works or graphic novels, children's books, and an award for excellence in speculative fiction. The awards have attracted the attention of publishers by setting down a benchmark in science fiction and fantasy. The continued sponsorship by publishers such as HarperCollins and Orbit has identified the award as an honour to be taken seriously.\nThe results are decided by a panel of judges from a list of submitted nominees; the long-list of nominees is reduced to a short list of finalists. The judges are selected from a public application process by the Award's management team.\nThis article lists all the short-list nominees and winners in the best science fiction short story category, as well as short stories that have received honourable mentions or have been highly commended. Since 2003, honourable mentions and high commendations have been awarded intermittently. Brendan Duffy and Sean Williams are the only people to have won the award multiple times, with two wins each. Stephen Dedman holds the record for most nominations and that for most nominations without winning, having been a losing finalist six times.\nWinners and nominees\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the year of the story's eligibility; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Each year links to the corresponding \"year in literature\" article. Entries with a blue background have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list. If the short story was originally published in a book with other stories rather than by itself or in a magazine, the book title is included after the publisher's name.\nWinners and joint winners\nNominees on the shortlist\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\"|Year\n! width=\"20%\"|Author(s)\n! width=\"35%\"|Short story\n! width=\"34%\"|Publisher or publication\n! width=\"4%\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || ''Asimov's ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Asimov's  ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Interzone (#100) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" ||  Legend (New Legends) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Eidolon ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"\" || MirrorDanse (Borderline) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Eidolon (Australian magazine) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Interzone (#106) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Aurealis (#16) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n|  & Jack Dann* || \"\" || DAW (Black Mist and Other Japanese Futures) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Interzone (#118) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Roc (The Horns of Elfland) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"\" || Voyager (Dreaming Down-Under) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Asimov's ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Asimov's ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Voyager (Dreaming Down-Under) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Aurealis (#20-21) ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"\" || Asimov's ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Interzone (#146) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\"  || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Interzone (#146) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || F&SF ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * || \"\" || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Orb ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Eidolon ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Allen & Unwin (White Time) ||\n|-\n|  || \"\" || Eidolon ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || Aurealis (#27-28) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || CSFG Publishing (Nor of Human...) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || F&SF ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Aurealis (#27-28) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || F&SF ||\n|- style=\"background:lightyellow;\"\n! rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" |\n| * ||  || F&SF ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Redsine ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Aurealis (#29) ||\n|-\n|  ||  || Agog!
