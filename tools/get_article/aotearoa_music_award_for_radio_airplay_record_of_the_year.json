Brooke Fraser's \"Deciphering Me\" followed in 2007, while Opshop won the award in 2008 with \"Maybe\". In 2009, \"Always on My Mind\", by Tiki Taane, was awarded the title. Stan Walker twice won the award two years in a row &mdash; in 2010 with \"Black Box\" and in 2011 with \"Choose You\", and again with \"Take It Easy\" in 2013 and \"Bulletproof\" in 2014.\nWinners\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Artist\n!Song\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Reference\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2004\n|Goldenhorse\n|\"Maybe Tomorrow\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2005\n|\n|\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2006\n|\n|\"Stand Up\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2007\n|\n|\"Deciphering Me\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2008\n|Opshop\n|\"Maybe\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2009\n|\n|\"Always on My Mind\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2010\n|\n|\"Black Box\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2011\n|\n|\"Choose You\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2012\n|Six60\n|\"Don't Forget Your Roots\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2013\n| Stan Walker\n| \"Take It Easy\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2014\n| Stan Walker\n| \"Bulletproof\"\n|align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| Broods\n| \"Mother & Father\"\n| align=\"center\" |\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| Six60\n| \"White Lines\"\n| align=\"center\" |\n|}\nWhile nominees are not normally announced for this category, in 2004 and 2015 nominees were included.\n* The non-winning nominees for 2004 were: Bic Runga - \"Listening for the Weather\" and Carly Binding - \"We Kissed\".\n* The non-winning nominees for 2015 were: Benny Tipene - \"Step On Up\", Broods - \"L.A.F.\", Lorde - \"Yellow Flicker Beat\", Six60 - \"Special\".\nReferences"
