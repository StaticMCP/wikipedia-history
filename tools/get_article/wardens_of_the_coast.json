On behalf of the King of England they were responsible for the direction and co-ordination of the King's fleet, the equipping of boats and processing payments to sailors and the superintendence of the Sea Guard Militia assigned to each coastal maritime county during the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. The most notable of these were the Warden of the Cinque Ports (1226–1267), later called Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Constable of Dover Castle (1267–present), and the Wardens of the Marches (1297–1603). By the beginning of the 16th century they were replaced by the vice-admiralties of the coast.\nSources"
