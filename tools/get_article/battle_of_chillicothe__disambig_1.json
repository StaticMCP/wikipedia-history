In May 1779, Colonel John Bowman of the Kentucky County militia, accompanied by Benjamin Logan and Levi Todd, led between 160 and 300 militiamen against the Shawnee settlement of Old Chillicothe. Dividing their forces, Bowman and Logan attacked the town from two sides but were eventually repulsed. Unable to draw the Shawnee from their single blockhouse, Bowman burned much of the town and left with  163 horses valued at $32,000. Although initially blamed for a defeat, as well as the  dozen casualties suffered by the Americans, Bowman and Logan were eventually credited by some with a major victory for the Patriots. With the destruction of a major Shawnee settlement and the death of Blackfish, additional war parties were discouraged from moving against American settlers in Kentucky. According to Theodore Roosevelt in The Winning of the West, \"the expedition undoubtedly accomplished more than Clark's attack on Piqua next year.\"\nReferences"
