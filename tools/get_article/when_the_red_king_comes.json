It is a concept album about the Red King's kingdom. The cover art is taken from a section of an imaginary map called “The Land of Make Believe”,  drawn in 1930 by Jaro Hess. A more complete version of the map can be seen in ''The Writer's Map: An Atlas of Imaginary Lands''.\n\"Needles in the Camel's Eyes\" is a cover of the Brian Eno song.\nCritical reception\nTrouser Press wrote that \"though still noisy, the improved sound coincides with a sharper focus in the songwriting (that's good) and the first hint of impending mythological obsessions (not so good).\" The Chicago Tribune thought that \"in Elf Power's hands, psychedelia is a means of transforming personal trauma into a twisted kind of triumph.\"\nAllMusic wrote that \"the fuzzy, lo-fi production is an Elephant 6 hallmark, but the unique instrumentation (electric horns, pump organs, even Nepalese percussion) and cryptic, stream-of-consciousness wordplay suggest something altogether different.\"\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\n* Andrew Rieger - guitars, vocals, flute, zanzitophone, keyboards, bass, percussion\n* Laura Carter - keyboards, vocals, Moog synthesizer, zanzithophone, loops\n* Bryan Helium - bass, vocals, guitar, sitar, keyboards\n* Aaron Wegelin - drums, vocals, percussion\nReferences"
