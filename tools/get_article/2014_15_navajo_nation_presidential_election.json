Russell Begaye and Jonathan Nez, who finished third in the primary, won the election.\nIn the primary election, Joe Shirley Jr. and Chris Deschene initially advanced to the general election. Originally the general election between Shirley and Deschene was to be held on  November 4, 2014. However, two former presidential candidates, Dale E. Tsosie and Hank Whitethorne, who were eliminated in the primary election, challenged Deschene's candidacy over his fluency of the Navajo Language, a requirement to run for president. This resulted in the disqualification of Chris Deschene and his running mate Fannie L. Atcitty.\nDue to the disqualification, the election was delayed to April 21, 2015, between Shirley and Dineh Benally against Begaye and Nez.\nHistory\nOn August 25, 2014, the Navajo Nation held primary elections for the Office of President. Joe Shirley Jr. and Chris Deschene had the two highest vote counts. In the weeks following, two other primary candidates sued in tribal court, invoking a never-used 1990s law that required candidates to be fluent in the Navajo language. They asked for an assessment of the leading candidates' language skills.\nOn October 23, 2014, the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the tribe held the first hearing on the complaint filed against Deschene. The meeting was presided by chief hearing officer Richie Nez. The court body ruled in favor of Dale Tsosie and Hank Whitethorne, the former primary candidates, and issued a default ruling against Deschene, who had refused to participate in assessment.\nLater that day, the Navajo Supreme Court, in a special session on the matter, enforced the ruling from the lower Court body and ordered that the Navajo government remove Deschene from the presidential ballot because of his lack of Navajo language skills.\nThe High Court ruled that the presidential election scheduled for November 4 (12 days later) would be postponed, and ordered that it be held by the end of January 2015. Chief Justice Herb Yazzie and Associate Justice Eleanor Shirley ruled for the 2–1 majority; Justice Irene Black wrote in her dissent that the technicality must be sent back to the lower court for correction there. The decision did not outline who would act as executive at the end of the current president's term (January 2015).\nIn the early hours of October 24, 2014 the Navajo Council passed legislative Bill 0298-14 amending the Navajo Nation Code. The legislation repealed the language requirement of the qualifications sections for president. This enabled Chris Deschene's participation in the election.\nThe following Monday, the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors (NBES) met but took no action to implement the court directives. Counsel for NBES motioned the High Court for further instruction. The next day, the Navajo Nation Election Board commissioner, Wallace Charley (joined later by Kimmeth Yazzie, Navajo Election Administration) announced that Deschene's name would remain on the ballot. Though he had vowed to continue, Deschene resigned from the race on October 30.\nOn October 29, Navajo President Ben Shelly vetoed the bill repealing the language requirement. The Navajo general election was held. Joe Shirley Jr. had the majority of votes by the unofficial tally.\nThe Navajo Council scheduled a primary and general election for June and August 2015. On Monday, January 5, 2015, President Shelly vetoed the language fluency bill. On January 7, five assistant attorneys-general filed petition with the Navajo Nation Supreme Court for clarification on the question of the presidential vacancy issue. Through a controversial agreement and resolution, the Court and the Council appointed Ben Shelly to act as interim President.\nIn the special election, businessman Russell Begaye was elected as president and Jonathan Nez as vice-president. In May 2015, they were sworn in. Begaye supports encouraging native language use among the Navajo, who have the most members of nearly any tribe who speak their native language. Approximately half of the Nation's 340,000 members speak Navajo. Begaye came to office supporting the Grand Canyon Escalade, a proposed project to increase tourism at the canyon, as well as initiatives to develop a rail port to export crops and coal from the reservation and to pursue clean coal technology.\nCandidates\nAdvanced to general election\n* Joe Shirley Jr. former Navajo Nation President (2003-2011), vying for a third term.\n** Dineh Benally.\n* Chris Deschene, Marine Veteran & former AZ State House of Representatives.**\n** Fannie L.
