The party was formed on 22 June 2017 by senior officials who have split from the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) faction allied to President Salva Kiir.\nHistory\nFormer governor of the defunct Warrap state, Lewis Anei Madut, was heavily endorsed to be the party's new chairman. The new party's deputy chairman and secretary general were also elected at the same meeting of the founding members. Speaking at the official launch of the party, Lewis Anei Madut said \"the Republican Party of South Sudan is a non-violent political organization formed after being inspired by the call to unite the country along a political party that aspires for equal rights of all the people of South Sudan.\"\nMembers\nElected officials\n*Chairman:  Lewis Anei Madut - Former governor of the now defunct state Warrap\n*Deputy Chairman:\n*Secretary General:\n*Party Lawyer: Philip Manyok Kuol\nFounding members\n*Anthony Agiem Akot\n*John Garang Dau USA-Chapter\n*Salva Kiir\n*Paul Malong Awan\n*Kuol Manyang\nSee also\n* Sudan People's Liberation Movement\nReferences"
