Nominees were announced on 22 May, 2008, and the award winners in 12 traditional music categories (of 47 nominees) and 23 popular music categories (of 124 nominees) were selected by a panel of 33 judges after four rounds of jury meetings. Initially, there were 10,632 submissions from 185 companies in the music industry, making it the largest submission pool in the Awards' history.\nWinners for artistic and traditional music categories were announced on 21 June, 2008, at Taipei County Hall in a ceremony separate from that for popular music categories. It was the second consecutive year that the ceremony for this category group was held separately, and it did not attract as much media attention as the ceremony for the popular music categories. By contrast, artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and Canada attended the awards ceremony for popular music categories, which was held at the Taipei Arena on 5 July, 2008. Actress sisters Barbie and Dee Shu, former news anchor Patty Hou, and actress Matilda Tao hosted this event, whose list of award presenters included Canadian recording artist Daniel Powter and Japanese drama stars Akito Kiriyama, Junta Nakama, and Yuya Takaki. Both events were broadcast on the satellite cable Azio Television channel on June 28 and July 5, respectively.\nMalaysian singer Gary Chaw and Singaporean singer-songwriter Tanya Chua were named Best Mandarin Male and Female Singers in the popular music category, respectively. Chua won the Best Mandarin Female Singer award for the second time; she last won the award in the 17th Golden Melody Awards. Chua's record seven nominations for her album Goodbye & Hello are the most received by a female artist. Taiwanese musician and singer Jay Chou, who received a record-breaking eight nominations for his album On the Run and film Secret, was not able to attend the event due to his tour in China. Chou's primary lyricist Vincent Fang was present to receive the award of Best Lyricist for the song \"Blue and White Porcelain\" (). Pop rock band Sodagreen received its second consecutive award as Best Band for its album Incomparable Beauty.\nNominees and winners\nWinners are listed first and highlighted in boldface.\nPopular music categories\nBest song\n* 'Blue and White Porcelain (青花瓷) – On the Run (我很忙) – Jay Chou'\n** Against the Light (逆光) – Against the Light (逆光) – Stefanie Sun\n** A Moment (一眼瞬間) – Star – A-mei (and Jam Hsiao)\n** Darwin (達爾文) – Goodbye & Hello – Tanya Chua\n** Incomparable Beauty (無與倫比的美麗) – Incomparable Beauty (無與倫比的美麗) – Sodagreen\n** Love Song – Wonderland (未來) – Khalil Fong\nBest Mandarin album\n* 'L!VE IS...KAREN MOK (拉活...莫文蔚) – Karen Mok'\n** Against the Light (逆光) – Stefanie Sun\n** Goodbye & Hello – Tanya Chua\n** Incomparable Beauty (無與倫比的美麗) – Sodagreen\n** On the Run (我很忙) – Jay Chou\n** Star – A-mei\nBest Taiwanese album\n* 'Love Songs (真情歌) – Ricky Hsiao'\n** Close to Home (厝邊) – Cheng Chiu-hsuan (鄭秋玄)\n** Love of Life III—Companionship (人間有愛3—歡喜作伴) television soundtrack\n** ''Kou!
