It began operations in 1998 but ceased these in 1999. In 2002, 49% of its shares were acquired by Michigan-based Auxer Group with an attempt to restart operations with a single Lockheed L-1011 TriStar in 2004, but this was unsuccessful.\nFleet\nQueen Air operated a single Airbus A320-200 (N302ML) wet-leased from TransMeridian Airlines. Additionally, two McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15s were ordered but were not delivered.\nSee also\n*List of defunct airlines of the Dominican Republic\nReferences"
