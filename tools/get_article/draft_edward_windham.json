He was a younger son of Thomas and Susan Clere Wyndham and grandson of Sir Henry Wyndham (b. circa 1545).   He was a descendant of Thomas Wyndham of Felbrigg, a renowned sea captain and Vice-Admiral (b. 1466).\nHe is the member of the Wyndham family who links his numerous US born descendants to historical and present day  Wyndhams in England and Australia.\nHe came to America on the ship John and Dorothy in 1634 with Capt. Adam Thoroughgood , at the age of 26. He married Abigail Offley b. 1602 and daughter of Robert Offley b. 1561, who was an Adventurer of the Virginia Company of London.\nSarah Offley b. 1609, Abigail's sister, was married to Adam Thoroughgood in London in 1627, and secondly, in 1647, to Francis Yeardley, son of the Governor of Virginia  George Yeardley.\nHis sister, Ann, is said to have married Adam Thoroughgood's brother Thomas in Norfolk, England circa 1620-1630.\nThe tideland nature of the coast of Norfolk, England  resembles that of Lower Norfolk County, Virginia.\nHistorical and Political context\nFamily relationships were closely connected to political and economic status in both England and colonial Virginia. Major events in England, including religious dissensions, the Grand Remonstrance,  economic policies and the conflicts between royalists and Parliamentarians,   had a major impact on life in Virginia and the development of later institutions.\nLloyd Fowler argues that \"Self-government in Virginia during the 1650s was the direct result of the English Civil War and the   British  Interregnum .\"\nTobacco was a critical cash commodity of interest to the Virginia Company, and a driver of political decision making in both England and the colony, at the same time that the colony had strategic significance amidst the rivalry between England, Spain and the Netherlands.\nA further critical driver was the series of Anglo-Powhattan wars from 1622-1644., which were concurrent with the rivalries between the colonists for land acquisition and recognition in England, notably those between George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore  and William Claiborne.\nThe broader perspective is one of European rivalries in North America and the conflicts with the indigenous peoples.\nIn lower Norfolk County, there were engagements with the Nanticoke tribes. Court records of July 17th 1639 state that \"it was ordered that 15 men out of Lower Norfolk County be appointed to march against the Menticoke Indians.\" Adam Thoroughgood and Edward Windham  were among the stated members of the court in Lynnehaven.\nPolitical career in Virginia and Maryland\nHe represented Lower Norfolk County, Virginia in the 1642/3 Virginia General Assembly.\nIn 1642-3, he was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, which convened at Jamestown on March 1. He was the first burgess elected from Lower Norfolk County, and he served in that capacity with Cornelius Lloyd and the other member from his county. He was present at the Assembly held on April 1st, 1642.\nHis protest, as a burgess, against the dissolution of the proprietary government is indicative of his royalist leanings.\nHe served as a judge and military advisor in the Tidewater Region of  Virginia. On June 16, 1637, William Berkeley, Governor of Virginia issued a commission appointing him as one of the commissioners for keeping monthly courts in Lower Norfolk. On January 6, 1639, he was appointed inspector of tobacco crops for the county Clerk's Office, in Portsmouth, Virginia. He was one of the eight members of the council of war which met on June 3, 1645 in the middle of the  Third Anglo-Powhattan Wars.\nIn 1651 Edward was still a resident of Lower Norfolk County but is said to have joined the Puritan emigration to Maryland. In March 1652, he was appointed as one of the six members of the council to govern Maryland during the argument between the party of Oliver Cromwell and George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore. This council was named to administer the oath of allegiance to the English Commonwealth from the province of Maryland, as evidenced by the written Proclamation of the council on March 29th 1652.\nHe and Richard Burke were replaced as council members in 1653 by  Captain John Price and  Thomas Hatton, who is described as a \"loyal friend of Lord Baltimore.\"\nIn the same year, Francis Yeardley became a member of the House of Burgesses.\nDeath and legacy\nHe returned to England at about that time.  He was buried in Stokesley, Norfolk on September 6, 1664. His son, Edward, was born in 1635, Isle of Wight , Virginia, married in 1654, leaving multiple descendants.\nReferences"
