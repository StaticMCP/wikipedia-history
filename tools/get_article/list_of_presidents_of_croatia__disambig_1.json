However, with the Constitution of 2001, the powers of the President (much expanded in 1990) were now again severely curtailed, as Croatia shifted from a semi-presidential system, to an incomplete parliamentary system. As in most parliamentary systems, the President is now by-and-large a ceremonial office, with the Prime Minister de facto heading the executive branch.\nPresidents of the Republic of Croatia (1990–present)\nSource:\nOn 30 May 1990 Franjo Tuđman was elected by Parliament as the President of the Presidency of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, then still a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and held office together with several Vice Presidents of the Presidency of SR Croatia. The collective presidency was reduced to seven members on 25 July 1990 and the name of the constituent Yugoslav republic was changed to the Republic of Croatia by removing the word Socialist from its name and the names of its institutions. The collective presidency was abolished in favor of the post of President of the Republic of Croatia with the adoption of a new constitution on 22 December 1990. The Croatian Parliament then declared independence on 25 June 1991, when Tuđman formally became the first president of an independent Croatian nation under the name the Republic of Croatia.\n(*)The constitutional amendments of November 2000 abandoned a semi-presidential system for a parliamentary system (with a directly elected president) and also made the presidency a non-partisan office, meaning that even if they are elected to office as a candidate of a particular political party, the president must resign membership in that party before taking office.\n|Croatian Democratic Union|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (2)\n|Social Democratic Party of Croatia|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (2)\n|Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}} (1)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |No.\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Picture\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=23% |Name(Birth–Death)\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Political party\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |No.\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |Term start\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" |Term end\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background: ; text-align: center;\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |\n| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |Franjo Tuđman(1922–1999)\n| style=\"background: ; text-align: center;\" |\n|30 May 1990\n|12 August 1992\n|—\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Croatian Democratic Union\n|-\n| style=\"background: ; text-align: center;\" |\n|12 August 1992\n|11 August 1997\n|1992 (56.73%)\n|-\n| style=\"background: ; text-align: center;\" |\n|12 August 1997\n|10 December 1999 †\n|1997 (61.41%)\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |Parliament elected him the President of the Presidency of SR Croatia in May 1990, but with the adoption of a new constitution on 22 December 1990, the title of the office was changed to President of the Republic of Croatia and the Presidium of Croatia (Presidency) was abolished. Tuđman presided over the period when Croatia gained independence and ultimately joined the United Nations in May 1992. Tuđman won re-election to a de facto second and third term in 1992 and 1997, winning election outright both times without the need for a run-off.
