For the most part they were used to varying degrees in the Middle Ages and surrounding time periods.  Some of these systems found their way into later systems, such as the Imperial system and even SI.\nEnglish system\nBefore Roman units were reintroduced in 1066 by William the Conqueror, there was an Anglo-Saxon (Germanic) system of measure, of which few details survive. It probably included the following units of length:\n* fingerbreadth or digit\n* inch\n* ell or cubit\n* foot\n* perch, used variously to measure length or area\n* acre and ''acre's breadth\n* furlong\n* mile\nThe best-attested of these is the perch which was approximately 5.03 m or 16 feet.  It remained in use until the twentieth century.\nLater development of the English system continued in 1215 in the Magna Carta. Standards were renewed in 1496, 1588 and 1758.\nSome of these units would go on to be used in later Imperial units and in the US system.\nDanish system\nFrom May 1, 1683, King Christian V of Denmark introduced an office to oversee weights and measures, a justervæsen, to be led by Ole Rømer. The definition of the alen was set to 2 Rhine feet. Rømer later discovered that differing standards for the Rhine foot existed, and in 1698 an iron Copenhagen standard was made. A pendulum definition for the foot was first suggested by Rømer, introduced in 1820, and changed in 1835. The metric system was introduced in 1907.\nLength\n* skrupel &ndash; Scruple,  linie\n* linie &ndash; Line,  tomme\n* tomme &ndash; Inch,  fod\n* palme &ndash; Palm, for circumference, 8.86&nbsp;cm\n* kvarter &ndash; Quarter,  alen\n* fod &ndash; Defined as a Rheinfuss 31.407&nbsp;cm from 1683, before that 31.41&nbsp;cm with variations.\n* alen &ndash; Forearm, 2 fod\n* mil &ndash; Danish mile. Towards the end of the 17th century, Ole Rømer connected the mile to the circumference of the earth, and defined it as 12000 alen. This definition was adopted in 1816 as the Prussian Meile. The coordinated definition from  1835 was 7.532&nbsp;km. Earlier, there were many variants, the most commonplace the Sjællandsk miil of 17600 fod or 11.130&nbsp;km.\nVolume\n* potte &ndash; Pot, from 1603  foot3\n* smørtønde &ndash; Barrel of butter, defined as 136 potter from 1683\n* korntønde &ndash; Barrel of corn, defined as 144 potter from 1683\nWeight\n* pund &ndash; Pound, from 1683 the weight of  fot3 of water, 499.75&nbsp;g\nMiscellaneous\n* dusin &ndash; 12\n* snes &ndash; 20\n* gross &ndash; 144\nDutch system\nThe Dutch system was not standardised until Napoleon introduced the metric system.  Different towns used measures with the same names but differing sizes.\nSome common measures:\nLength\n*duim &ndash;2.54&nbsp;cm\n*kleine palm &ndash;3&nbsp;cm\n*grote palm &ndash;9.6&nbsp;cm, after 1820, 10&nbsp;cm\n*voet &ndash;12 duim = abt. 29.54&nbsp;cm, many local variations\n*el &ndash; about 70&nbsp;cm\nVolume\n*Pint &ndash; 0.6 L\nWeight\n*Ons, Once &ndash;  pond = 30.881&nbsp;g\n*Pond (Amsterdam) &ndash; 494.09&nbsp;g (other ponds were also in use)\n*Scheepslast &ndash; 4000 Amsterdam pond = 1976.4&nbsp;kg = 2.1786 short tons\nFinnish system\nIn Finland, approximate measures derived from body parts and were used for a long time, some being later standardised for the purpose of commerce. Some Swedish, and later some Russian units have also been used.\nLength\n*vaaksa &ndash; The distance between the tips of little finger and thumb, when the fingers are fully extended.\n*kyynärä &ndash; c. 60&nbsp;cm &ndash; The distance from the elbow to the fingertips.\n*syli &ndash; fathom, c. 180&nbsp;cm &ndash; The distance between the fingertips of both hands when the arms are raised horizontally on the sides.\n*virsta &ndash; 2672 m (Swedish), 1068.84&nbsp;m (Russian)\n*poronkusema &ndash; c. 7.5&nbsp;km &ndash; The distance a reindeer walks between two spots it urinates on. This unit originates from Lapland (i.e. Sápmi).\n*peninkulma &ndash; 10.67&nbsp;km &ndash; The distance a barking dog can be heard in still air.\nArea\n*tynnyrinala &ndash; 4936.5&nbsp;m2 &ndash; The area (of field) that could be sown with one barrel of grain.\nVolume\n*kannu &ndash; 2.6172 L\n*kappa &ndash; 5.4961 L\nWeight\n*leiviskä &ndash; 8.5004&nbsp;kg\nMiscellaneous\n*kortteli &ndash; 148&nbsp;mm (length) or 0.327&nbsp;L (volume)\nFrench system\nIn France, again, there were many local variants. For instance, the lieue could vary from 3.268&nbsp;km in Beauce to 5.849&nbsp;km in Provence. Between 1812 and 1839, many of the traditional units continued in metrified adaptations as the mesures usuelles.\nIn Paris, the redefinition in terms of metric units made 1&nbsp;m = 443.296 ligne = 3&nbsp;pied 11.296 ligne.\nIn Quebec, the surveys in French units were converted using the relationship 1 pied (of the French variety; the same word is used for English feet as well) = 12.789 inches (of English origin).  Thus a square arpent was 5299296.0804&nbsp;in2 or about 36,801&nbsp;ft2 or 0.8448 acre.\nThere were many local variations; the metric conversions below apply to the Quebec and Paris definitions.\nLength\n* ligne &ndash;  pouce 2.2558&nbsp;mm\n* pouce &ndash; Inch,  pied  27.070&nbsp;mm\n* pied &ndash; Foot, varied through times, the Paris pied de roi is 324.84&nbsp;mm.  Used by Coulomb in manuscripts relating to the inverse square law of electrostatic repulsion. Isaac Newton used the \"Paris foot\" in his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.\n*  1 Roman cubit = 444&nbsp;mm (so 10000 Roman cubits = 4.44&nbsp;km, a closer approximation to  degree)\n* toise &ndash; Fathom, 6 pieds. Originally introduced by Charlemagne in 790, it is now considered to be 1.949&nbsp;m.\n* arpent &ndash; 30 toises or 180 pieds, 58.471&nbsp;m\n* lieue de poste &ndash; Legal league, 2000 toises, 3.898&nbsp;km\n* lieue metrique &ndash; Metric system adaptation, 4.000&nbsp;km\n* lieue commune &ndash; French land league, 4.452&nbsp;km,  Equatorial degree\n* lieue marine &ndash; French (late) sea league, 5.556&nbsp;km, 3 nautical miles.\nArea\n* arpent &ndash; square arpent, 900 square toises, 3419&nbsp;m2\nVolume\n* litron &ndash; 0.831018 litres\nWeight\n* livre &ndash; 0.4895&nbsp;kg\n* quintal &ndash; 100 livres, 48.95&nbsp;kg\nGerman system\nUp to the introduction of the metric system, almost every town in Germany had their own definitions. It is said that by 1810, in Baden alone, there were 112 different Ellen.\nLength\n* Linie &ndash; Line, usually  inch, but also .\n* Zoll &ndash; Inch, usually  foot, but also .\n* Fuss &ndash; Foot, varied between 23.51&nbsp;cm in Wesel and 40.83&nbsp;cm in Trier.\n* Rheinfuss &ndash; Rhine foot, used in the North, 31.387&nbsp;cm\n* Elle &ndash; Ell / cubit, distance between elbow and finger tip. In the North, often 2 feet, In Prussia  feet, in the South variable, often  feet. The smallest known German elle is 402.8&nbsp;mm, the longest 811&nbsp;mm.\n* Klafter &ndash; Fathom, usually 6 feet. Regional changes from 1.75&nbsp;m in Baden to 3&nbsp;m in Switzerland.\n* Rute &ndash; Rod, Roman origin, use as land measure. Very differing definitions, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18 or 20 feet, varied between approx. 3 and 5 m.\n* Wegstunde'' &ndash; 'Way's hour', one hours travel (by foot), used up to the 18th century. In Germany  Meile or 3.71&nbsp;km, in Switzerland 16000 feet or 4.8&nbsp;km\n* Meile &ndash; 'Mile', a German geographische Meile or Gemeine deutsche Meile was defined as 7.420&nbsp;km, but there were a wealth of variants:\n** Anhalt &ndash; 7532 m\n** Baden &ndash; 8889&nbsp;m before 1810, 8944&nbsp;m before 1871, 8000&nbsp;m thereafter\n** Böhmen &ndash; 7498 m\n** Brabant &ndash; 5000&nbsp;m\n** Bayern &ndash; 7415 m, connected to a  Equatorial degree as 25406 Bavarian feet.\n** Hamburg (Prussia) &ndash; In 1816, king Frederick William III of Prussia adopted the Danish mile at 7532&nbsp;m, or 24000 Prussian feet. Also known as Landmeile.\n** Hessen-Kassel &ndash; 9206 m\n** Lippe-Detmold &ndash; 9264 m\n** Oldenburg &ndash; 9894 m\n** Osnabrück &ndash; 5160 m\n** Pfalz &ndash; 4630 m\n** Rheinland &ndash; 4119 m\n** Sachsen &ndash; Postmeile, 7500 m. Also 9062&nbsp;m or 32000 feet in Dresden\n** Schleswig-Holstein &ndash; 8803 m\n** Westfalen &ndash; 11100 m, but also 9250&nbsp;m\n** Vienna &ndash; 7586 m\n** Wiesbaden &ndash; 1000 m\n** Württemberg &ndash; 7449 m\n* Reichsmeile &ndash; 'Imperial / (The) Realm's mile', new mile when the metric system was introduced, 7.5&nbsp;km. Prohibited by law in 1908.\n* Schainos &ndash; Uncertain use, between 10 and 12&nbsp;km,\n* Stadion &ndash; Uncertain use\nNorwegian system\nBefore 1541, there were no common definition for length measures in Norway, and local variants flourished. In 1541, an alen in Denmark and Norway was defined by law to be the Sjælland alen. Subsequently, the alen was defined by law as 2 Rhine feet from 1683. From 1824, the basic unit was defined as a fot being derived from astronomy as the length of a one-second pendulum times  at a latitude of 45°. The metric system was introduced in 1887.\nLength\n* skrupel &ndash; Scruple,  linje or approx. 0.18&nbsp;mm.\n* linje &ndash; Line,  tomme or approx. 2.18&nbsp;mm\n* tomme &ndash; Thumb (inch),  fot, approx. 2.61&nbsp;cm. This unit was commonly used for measuring timber until the 1970s. Nowadays, the word refers invariably to the Imperial inch, 2.54&nbsp;cm.\n* kvarter &ndash; Quarter,  alen.\n* fot &ndash; Foot,  alen. From 1824, 31.374&nbsp;cm.\n* alen &ndash; Forearm, 62.748&nbsp;cm from 1824, 62.75&nbsp;cm from 1683, 63.26&nbsp;cm from 1541.

A suitable distance between rests when walking. Believed to be approx. 9&nbsp;km before 1541.\n* mil &ndash; Norwegian mile, spelled miil prior to 1862, 18000 alen or 11.295&nbsp;km. Before 1683, a mil was defined as 17600 alen or 11.13&nbsp;km. The unit survives to this day, but in a metric 10&nbsp;km adaptation\n* landmil &ndash; Old land-mile, 11.824&nbsp;km.\nArea\n* kvadrat rode &ndash; Square stang, 9.84&nbsp;m2\n* mål &ndash; 100 kvadrat rode, 984&nbsp;m2.

The Islamic influence was more present in the south of the country. Fundamental units like the  and the  were imported by the northwest of Portugal in the 11th century, before the country became independent of León.\nThe gradual long-term process of standardization of weights and measures in Portugal is documented mainly since the mid-14th century. In 1352, municipalities requested standardization in a parliament meeting (). In response, Afonso IV decided to set the  () of Lisbon as standard for the linear measures used for color fabrics across the country. A few years later, Pedro I carried a more comprehensive reform, as documented in the parliament meeting of 1361: the  of Santarém should be used for weighing meat; the  of Lisbon would be the standard for the remaining weights; cereals should be measured by the  of Santarém; the  of Lisbon should be used for wine. With advances, adjustments and setbacks, this framework predominated until the end of the 15th century.\nFurther information: Portuguese customary units.\nRomanian system\nThe measures of the old Romanian system varied greatly not only between the three Romanian states (Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania), but sometimes also inside the same country. The origin of some of the measures are the Latin (such as iugăr unit), Slavic (such as vadră unit) and Greek (such as dram unit) and Turkish (such as palmac unit) systems.\nThis system is no longer in use since the adoption of the metric system in 1864.\nLength\n* Cot (cubit) – 0.664&nbsp;cm (Moldavia); 0.637&nbsp;cm (Wallachia)\n* Deget (finger) – the width of a finger\n* Palmac – 3.48&nbsp;cm (Moldavia)\n* Lat de palmă (palm width) –  palmă\n* Palmă (palm) –  of a stânjen\n* Picior (foot) –  of a stânjen\n* Pas mic (small step) – 4 palme (Wallachia)\n* Pas mare (large step) – 6 palme (Wallachia; Moldavia)\n* Stânjen – 2&nbsp;m (approximately)\n* Prăjină – 3 stânjeni\n* Funie (rope) – 20 – 120 m (depending on the place)\n* Verstă – 1067 m\n* Leghe (league) – 4.444&nbsp;km;\n* Poştă – 8 – 20&nbsp;km (depending on the country)\nArea\n* Prăjină – 180–210&nbsp;m2\n* Feredelă –  pogon\n* Pogon – 50000&nbsp;m2\n* Iugăr – the area ploughed in one day by two oxen 7166&nbsp;m2 (Transylvania in 1517); 5700&nbsp;m2 or 1600 square stânjeni (later)\n* Falce – 14300&nbsp;m2\nVolume\n* Litră –  oca\n* Oca – (pl. ocale), 1.5 litres (Moldavia); 1.25 litres (Wallachia)\n* Pintă – 3.394 litres (Transylvania)\n* Vadră – (pl. vedre, in Transylvania 'Tină), 10 ocale; 12.88 litres (Wallachia); 15 litres (Moldavia)\n* Baniţă – 21.5 litres (Moldavia); 33.96 litres (Wallachia)\n* Chiup – 30–40 litres (a chiup was a large clay pot for liquids)\n* Obroc mic – 22 ocale\n* Obroc mare – 44 ocale\n* Merţă – 110–120 ocale (Moldavia); 22.5 litres (Transylvania)\n* Giumătate – 80–100 vedre (poloboc)\n* Feredelă –  bucket (Transylvania)\n* Câblă – A bucket of wheat\nWeight\n* Dram – 3.18–3.25&nbsp;g sau 3.22–3.80&nbsp;cm3\n* Font – 0.5&nbsp;kg (Transylvania)\nRussian and Tatar systems\nSee:\n* Obsolete Russian weights and measures\n* Obsolete Tatar weights and measures\nScottish system\nLength\n* inch &ndash; 2.554&nbsp;cm\n* foot &ndash; 12 inches, 30.645&nbsp;cm\n* ell &ndash; Elbow, 37 Scots inches. 94.5&nbsp;cm\n* fall &ndash; 18 Scots feet\n* mile &ndash; 320 falls, 1814.2 m\nSpanish system\nThere were several variants.

Before that, there were a number of local variants. The system was slightly revised in 1735. In 1855, a decimal reform was instituted that defined a new Swedish inch as  foot. It did not last long, because the metric system was subsequently introduced in 1889. Up to the middle of the 19th century there was a death penalty for falsifying weights or measures.\nLength\n* linje &ndash; Line, after 1863  tum, 2.96&nbsp;mm.

For 58 years both the international and the traditional units were in use, but after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic, the traditional units became obsolete. In 1931 by Act No. 1782, international units became compulsory and the traditional units were banned from use starting 1 January 1933.\nLength\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Local name\n!In English\n!Equivalence\n!In modern units\n|-\n|nokta\n|نقطه\n|point\n|\n|0.219 mm (0.0086 in)\n|-\n|hat\n|خط‎\n|line\n|12 nokta\n|2.63 mm (0.104 in)\n|-\n|parmak\n|پرمق\n|finger\n|12 hat\n|31.57 mm (1.243 in)\n|-\n|kerrab or kirab\n|\n|\n|\n|42.5 mm (1.67 in)\n|-\n|rubu or urup\n|\n|\n|2 kerrab\n|85 mm (3.3 in)\n|-\n|ayak or kadem\n|آیاق\n|foot\n|12 parmak\n|378.87 mm (1.2430 ft)\n|-\n|endaze\n|\n|ell\n|\n|650 mm (2.13 ft)\n|-\n|arşın\n|آرشين or آرشون\n|ell\n|\n|68 cm (2.23 ft)\n|-\n|zirai\n|\n|agricultural/yard\n|2 ayak\n|757.74 mm (2.4860 ft)\n|-\n|kulaç\n|\n|fathom\n|\n|1.8288 m (6.000 ft)\n|-\n|berid or menzil\n|بريد or منزل\n|range\n|600 ayak\n|227 m (745 ft)\n|-\n|eski mil\n|\n|nautical mile\n|5,000 ayak\n|1,894.35 m (1.02287 nmi)\n|-\n|fersah\n|فرسخ\n|league\n|3 eski mil\n|5,685 m (3.532 mi)\n|-\n|merhale\n|مرحلة\n|stage, phase\n|200 berid\n|45.48 km (28.26 mi)\n|}\nArea\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Local name\n!In English\n!In modern units\n|-\n|eski dönüm\n|اسكی دونوم\n|old dunam\n|919 m2 (9,890 sq ft)\n|-\n|büyük dönüm\n|بیوك دونوم\n|big dunam\n|2,720 m2 (29,300 sq ft)\n|}\nVolume\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Local name\n!In English\n!Equivalence\n!In modern units\n|-\n|şinik\n|\n|peck\n|\n|9.25 L (2.44 US gal)\n|-\n|kile (Istanbul)\n|كيله‎\n|bushel\n|4 şinik\n|37 L (9.8 US gal)\n|}\nWeight\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Local name\n!In English\n!Equivalence\n!In modern units\n|-\n|kırat\n|قيراط\n|carat\n|\n|0.2004 g (1.002 carats)\n|-\n|dirhem\n|درهم\n|(Turkish) dram\n|16 kırat\n|3.207 g (0.1131 oz)\n|-\n|okka\n|اوقه\n|oka\n|400 dirhem\n|1.282 kg (2.83 lb)\n|-\n|miskal\n|مثقال\n|\n|1.5 dirhem\n|4.25 g (0.150 oz)\n|-\n|batman\n|بطمان\n|\n|6 okka\n|7.697 kg (16.97 lb)\n|-\n|kantar\n|قنطار\n|weighbridge\n|\n|56.449 kg (124.45 lb)\n|-\n|çeki\n|چكی\n|\n|4 kantar\n|225.789 kg (497.78 lb)\n|}\nVolumetric flow\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Local name\n!In modern units\n|-\n|hilal\n|هلال\n|0.6526 L/min\n|-\n|çuvaldız\n|\n|1.125 L/min\n|-\n|masura\n|\n|4.5 L/min\n|-\n|kamış\n|قامش\n|9 L/min\n|-\n|lüle\n|لوله\n|36 L/min\n|}\nTime\nThe traditional calendar of the Ottoman Empire was, like in most Muslim countries, the Islamic calendar. Its era begins from the Hijra in 622 CE and each year is calculated using the 12 Arabian lunar months, approximately eleven days shorter than a Gregorian solar year. In 1839, however, a second calendar was put in use for official matters. The new calendar, which was called the Rumi also began by 622, but with an annual duration equal to a solar year after 1840. In modern Turkey, the Gregorian calendar was adopted as the legal calendar, beginning by the end of 1925. But the Islamic calendar is still used when discussing dates in an Islamic context.\nSee also\n* Mesures usuelles\n* Weights and measures\nReferences\n* Measure for Measure, Richard Young and Thomas Glover, .\n* Masse und Gewichte, Marvin A.
