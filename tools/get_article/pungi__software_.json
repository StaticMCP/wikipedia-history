Pungi is mainly a distribution compose tool. Pungi consists of multiple separate executables backed by a common library.\nOrigin of name\nThe name Pungi comes from the instrument used to charm snakes. Anaconda being the software Pungi was manipulating, and anaconda being a snake, led to the referential naming.\nThe first name, which was suggested by Seth Vidal, was FIST, Fedora Installation  Tool. That name was quickly discarded and replaced with Pungi.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://pagure.io/pungi Pungi page at Fedora project]"
