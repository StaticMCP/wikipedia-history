The Cape Melville National Park is in the north-east of the locality extending into neighbouring Starcke to the east. Apart from the Rocky Islets, all of the islands in the locality are either fully or partially within the Flinders Group National Park.\nMost of the locality is within these protected areas, while the remaining land is mostly undeveloped. There is a small area used for grazing on native vegetation east of the mouth of Normanby River along the coast.\nHistory\nFlinders Island and the Flinders Group were named by Lieutenant Charles Jeffreys, a naval officer on HM Armed Brig Kangaroo on 30 May 1815, after Captain Matthew Flinders. Clack Island was also named by Jeffreys, but the origin of the name is unknown.\nThe other islands are all believed to be named after naval officers who commanded survey vessels operating around the northern Queensland coast:\n* King Island named after Lieutenant (later Rear Admiral) Phillip Parker King, commander of HM Colonial Cutter Mermaid from 1818 to 1820\n* Blackwood Island named after Captain Francis Price Blackwood, who commanded HMS Fly from 1843 to 1845\n* Stanley Island named after Captain Owen Stanley, who commanded HMS Rattlesnake from 1847 to 1848\n* Denham Island named after Captain Henry Mangles Denham, who commanded HMS Herald from 1853 to 1861\n* Maclear Island named after Lieutenant John Maclear, who commanded HMS Alert from 1881 to 1882.\nDemographics\nIn the , Lakefield and surrounding areas had a population of 184 people.\nIn the , Lakefield had a population of 16 people.\nIn the , Lakefield had a population of 21 people.\nHeritage listings\nLakeland has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n* Old Laura Homestead, Rinyirru National Park ()\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Lakefield.

Also there are no secondary schools nearby. The alternatives are distance education and boarding school.\nReferences\nExternal links"
