It is the first single player MechWarrior game since 2002. It was initially available as an Epic Games Store exclusive title, which, like other games with Epic Games Store exclusivity deals, was met with criticism. On May 7, 2020, it was made available through Xbox Game Pass for PC. On May 27, 2021, it was made available on additional platforms including Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Steam and GOG, in addition to the DLC pack Heroes of the Inner Sphere, Call to Arms, and Rise of Rasalhague. The game has sold two million units as of October 2024. Piranha Games released a sequel, MechWarrior 5: Clans, on October 16, 2024.\nSynopsis\nMechWarrior 5: Mercenaries is set in the BattleTech universe. The game starts in 3015 during the final decade of the Third Succession War, casting the player as a rookie mercenary MechWarrior rising from the ashes of a demolished mercenary unit. They are able to accept contracts from the various factions available in this time period. The campaign goes all the way up to 3049, just before the Clan Invasion.\nPlot\nThe player takes the role of \"Commander Mason\", the only son of Nikolai Mason, commanding officer of Nik's Cavaliers, a small mercenary outfit whose home base is on the Federated Suns world of De Berry in 3015. Having come of age and taking a rebuilt 'Centurion' model BattleMech through its paces with his father, this training mission is interrupted by a surprise attack by a mysterious mercenary unit demanding information from Nikolai. Refusing to divulge mysterious coordinates that they seek, Nikolai orders his son to return to base and flee aboard the unit's DropShip, sacrificing his life to ensure their escape.\nReduced to just two BattleMechs, Mason and the survivors of the Cavaliers (Ryana Campbell, the operations officer, and Fahad Arazad, the chief technician) reach out to Sebastian Spears, a high level agent of the company Interstellar Expeditions and a long-term friend of his father who provides assistance in escaping the system. Using a re-used mercenary registration number to mask their origins, Commander Mason must rebuild his command to locate and defeat his enemies and avenge his father, as well as uncover the secret his father took to his grave.\nAs Mason completes missions over time, Nik's Cavaliers' reputation grows and they build up a company of progressively stronger 'Mechs with veteran pilots. After leaving Federated Suns space for the Free World's League in search of leads, they finally learn the name of the mercenary outfit who attacked them: Black Inferno. Through a series of skirmishes against Black Inferno taking place from the Free World's League to the Lyran Commonwealth, Mason finds out that there are in fact two people responsible for his father's death: Andreas Kane, leader of Black Inferno (who killed Nikolai), and Kenzo Yamata, who gave the order. Yamata is a high-ranking member of the immensely powerful and secretive company ComStar: controllers of virtually all interstellar communication, and Black Inferno's benefactor.\nAt Spear's recommendation, Nik's Cavaliers raid Black Inferno's repair and salvage base for stronger 'Mechs in preparation for an attack on Black Inferno's stronghold. Zavarov, an elite officer of Black Inferno, pilots Nikolai's 'Victor' 'Mech as a form of psychological warfare against Mason. Mason kills her and retrieves his father's 'Mech. With enough firepower at last, Nik's Cavaliers launch an all-out attack on Black Inferno's final base. There, Mason faces off against Kane in his 'King Crab' 'Mech. Though Mason prevails and even destroys the entire Black Inferno base, Yamata escapes, using Kane as a distraction.\nWith Spear's help, Ryana manages to decipher a series of coordinates from Nikolai's 'Victor', leading them into uncharted space on the periphery of Draconis Combine space. They discover that the planets there are strewn with ancient lost technology (known as LosTech) that ComStar wishes to exploit. With their target now switching from Black Inferno to ComStar, Mason captures and destroys ComStar outposts on several planets. Finally, Yamata himself arrives in his LosTech 'Annihilator' 'Mech to deal with Mason once and for all. After a hard-fought battle, Mason defeats Yamata. Immediately afterwards, Fahad relays that Nikolai's 'Victor' is sending a signal to a secret 'Mech bay nearby. There, they uncover a LosTech 'Mech called a 'Nightstar'.\nThrough an audio log in the 'Nightstar', Mason and his allies realize that the immensely powerful 'Mech belonged to Nikolai. He hid it decades ago to avoid rousing suspicion on his origins, as that 'Mech model had not been seen in the Inner Sphere of known space for over two centuries. Moreover, 'Nikolai Mason' was an identity he adopted for a spy mission in the Inner Sphere. Reaching the final set of coordinates that Nikolai left behind, Nik's Cavaliers and Interstellar Expeditions arrive at a massive underground base with a treasure-trove of LosTech. It is conspicuously marked with a red star emblem reminiscent of the Star League Defense Force (an ancient military that protected the Inner Sphere and who disappeared hundreds of years ago). ComStar catches up to them, sending waves of BattleMechs to destroy them and secure the LosTech for themselves. With nowhere left to run, Nik's Cavaliers make a last stand, as Ryana retrieves all the LosTech data of the base before Nik's Cavaliers escape on their DropShip.\nMason finally understands that his father originated from an unknown region of space beyond the Inner Sphere. However, his arrival was detected by ComStar. Knowing that he had access to LosTech, ComStar tracked him for years before finally sending Black Inferno to attack him at the beginning of the game. Nik's Cavaliers hand over the data to Spears, who promises that Interstellar Expeditions would use it for the betterment of the Inner Sphere. Having avenged his father's death and solved the mystery of the coordinates at last, Mason is finally at peace. Ryana and Fahad speculate that Nikolai's people will one day arrive in the Inner Sphere.\nProduction\nUp to 2003 FASA Studio had been developed Mechwarrior 5. That game was cancelled in March 2003, do to \"''not advancing the genre enough to meet and exceed our customer's expectations.\"\nMechwarrior 5: Mercenaries'' was officially revealed in an early alpha stage during Piranha Games' annual MechCon show in December 2016, where Russ Bullock, the CEO of Piranha Games did [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUdUP4WobSU a live demonstration]  showcasing the game with a hangar, a Shadowhawk mech, and combat against an AI-piloted Raven mech.

Later in June 2019, Piranha Games revealed that they had agreed with Epic Games on Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries becoming a launch exclusive on their online digital store Epic Games Store, thereby going back on the promise of Steam and GOG copies to those who had preordered, as stipulated in the Community Edition.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and pivoting to remote development, the first downloadable content was pushed towards at the end of 2020. This coincided with the news that Piranha Games were to be acquired by the investor group EnadGlobal7 in November 2020. This acquisition put Piranha Games in touch with other companies within EnadGlobal7, such as the marketing companies Sold Out and Petrol, which suggested that the next DLC should be combined with not only the upcoming Steam and GOG release, but also an Xbox One/Xbox Series S/X console version that Piranha had been working on, thereby resulting in one major marketing push. This meant that Piranha Games combined the first DLC titled Heroes of the Inner Sphere with a major game update called 'Year One' and the Steam, GOG, and Xbox release in one single release on May 27, 2021. The Year One update included a range of quality of life improvements for the game, such as better AI, new sound effects, better graphical effects, a revamped introduction, and new cutscenes. Heroes of the Inner Sphere included new mission types, new mech chassis and variants, new biomes, and new tailored missions. This release saw a heavy marketing push with for example the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u674H-KiVnQ E3 PC Gaming Show presented as taking place within the Mechwarrior universe].\nDLC2: Kestrel Lancers and PlayStation release\nWhile Heroes of the Inner Sphere had been worked on during 2020, Piranha Games had also worked on the second downloadable content for Mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries.

This marked the first time in over 20 years that a Mechwarrior game had appeared on PlayStation since Mechwarrior 2: Arcade Edition in 1997, since Microsoft has owned the rights to all electronic instantiations of Battletech and Mechwarrior after acquiring FASA Interactive in January 1999. The Kestrel Lancers featured a new linear campaign set in the 4th Succession War, urban biomes, new mech variants, and its base game update included melee combat, new HUD, and lancemate switching.
