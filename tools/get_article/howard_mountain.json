It is the second-highest peak of the Never Summer Mountains which are a subrange of the Rocky Mountains. The mountain is situated on the western boundary of Rocky Mountain National Park and is visible from Trail Ridge Road within the park. The west side of the peak is in the Never Summer Wilderness which is managed by Medicine Bow–Routt National Forest, and the peak is the highest point of the wilderness. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's west slope drains into the South Fork of the Michigan River and the east slope drains into headwaters of the Colorado River except a portion of which is diverted by the Grand Ditch. The counterintuitive direction of water flow is because the Continental Divide forms a loop in this area, whereby the peak's west slope runoff flows to the Atlantic Ocean and the east slope to the Pacific. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises over  above the Colorado River in  and  above the South Fork Michigan River in .\nEtymology\nThe namesake of the mountain's toponym is a mystery as it was applied on early maps, perhaps it was named for an early prospector in this area. The toponym was officially adopted in 1932 by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\nGallery\nFile:Howard Mountain se.jpg|Southeast aspect\nFile:Howard and Cirrus.jpg|Howard Mountain (left) and Mt. Cirrus (right)\nFile:Howard Mountain, snowy.jpg|Howard Mountain centered in the distance\nClimate\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Howard Mountain is located in an alpine subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and cool to warm summers. Due to its altitude, it receives precipitation all year, as snow in winter, and as thunderstorms in summer, with a dry period in late spring.\n(1991–2020 normals)\n|single line = y\n|Jan high F = 20.1\n|Feb high F = 20.0\n|Mar high F = 27.0\n|Apr high F = 34.2\n|May high F = 43.3\n|Jun high F = 54.0\n|Jul high F = 60.6\n|Aug high F = 58.6\n|Sep high F = 51.6\n|Oct high F = 39.5\n|Nov high F = 27.1\n|Dec high F = 20.3\n|Jan mean F = 11.7\n|Feb mean F = 11.4\n|Mar mean F = 17.4\n|Apr mean F = 23.4\n|May mean F = 32.5\n|Jun mean F = 42.8\n|Jul mean F = 49.8\n|Aug mean F = 47.8\n|Sep mean F = 41.0\n|Oct mean F = 29.9\n|Nov mean F = 19.0\n|Dec mean F = 11.9\n|Jan low F = 3.3\n|Feb low F = 2.9\n|Mar low F = 7.8\n|Apr low F = 12.7\n|May low F = 21.7\n|Jun low F = 31.7\n|Jul low F = 38.9\n|Aug low F = 37.1\n|Sep low F = 30.4\n|Oct low F = 20.3\n|Nov low F = 10.8\n|Dec low F = 3.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.79\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.91\n|Mar precipitation inch = 4.14\n|Apr precipitation inch = 5.19\n|May precipitation inch = 4.53\n|Jun precipitation inch = 2.22\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.24\n|Aug precipitation inch = 2.56\n|Sep precipitation inch = 2.62\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.49\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.71\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.38\n|source=PRISM Climate Group\n}}\nSee also\n* List of peaks in Rocky Mountain National Park\n*\n*\n*\nReferences\nExternal links\n* Weather forecast: [https://www.yr.no/en/forecast/daily-table/2-5578203/United%20States/Colorado/Grand/Howard%20Mountain Howard Mountain]"
