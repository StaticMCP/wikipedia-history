The railmotors suffered from continuous gearbox problems and Queensland Railways elected to purchase 2000 class rail motors instead.\nRM1900 was stripped down for an overhaul in the mid 1980s but the work didn't proceed and it was scrapped in August 1988.\nRM1901 is retained by Queensland Rail as part of its Heritage Fleet. It is used for heritage tours and occasionally used for track inspections. When not required for use it is stored at the Workshops Rail Museum, North Ipswich.\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://sites.google.com/site/queenslandgreattrains/Home/the-railmotors/1900-class-the-budd-cars|Queensland's Great Trains gallery]"
