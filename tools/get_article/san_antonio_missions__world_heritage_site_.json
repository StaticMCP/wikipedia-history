The World Heritage Site consists of five mission sites, a historic ranch, and related properties. These outposts were established in the early 1700s by Catholic religious orders to spread Christianity among the local natives. These missions formed part of the colonization system of New Spain that stretched across the Mexican Northeast in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. With the independence of Texas and the Mexican-American war, they became part of the United States in 1848.\nThey were inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2015. Their architectural designs combine Spanish and Coahuiltecan cultures, including Catholic symbols and indigenous designs. They also process the remains of water distribution systems, that shows the combination of the indigenous and colonizers cultures.\nList of the sites\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style =\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Picture\n!
