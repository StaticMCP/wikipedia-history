The project was founded in 2018 and has released two albums, Delta Tales and Signs & Wonders, under the record label of PeacockSunrise Records.\nOverview\nAt age five, John Blangero began taking piano lessons in New Castle, Pennsylvania and developed an interest in music. After five years, he learned the fundamentals of western classical, gospel, and rock music.\nBlangero then joined a rock band at his school when he was fourteen. Later he co-founded his band Harlequin as his regional popularity amplified in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nHe continued with the band Harlequin until he joined college and focused mainly on his studies. In 1986, he earned his PhD and became a biomedical research scientist.\nIn the 2000s, Blangero started playing live for blues bands in San Antonio, Texas. In 2018, he launched his professional moniker Sun King Rising. In 2019, Nick Katana after rebranding his music company Melodic Revolution Records to PeacockSunshine Records, signed Blangero for Sun King Rising.\nIn 2020, Blangero hired Steven \"Ace\" Acker, a member of a 1970s band named LAW, to produce his first album Delta Tales, which was released on October 2, 2020. In the same year, he released an independent video song Free Will in China Blues.\nOn October 1, 2022, Sun King Rising released another album, Signs & Wonders.\nDiscography\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Album\n!Song\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |2022\n| rowspan=\"10\" |Sign and Wonders\n|No. 6 Magnolia Avenue\n|-\n|Bitter Water Sweetened\n|-\n|One More Story\n|-\n|Jubal Takes a Wife\n|-\n|Low Wine and Cruel Ruin\n|-\n|Lanterns on the Levee\n|-\n|Buried in the Blues\n|-\n|Anchorless\n|-\n|Alabama Nocturne\n|-\n|She was a Blonde\n|-\n|2020\n|Free Will in China Blue\n|Free Will in China Blue\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |2020\n| rowspan=\"10\" |Delta Tales\n|The Snake\n|-\n|Milkweed and Thistle\n|-\n|Down The Delta Road\n|-\n|In a State of Grace\n|-\n|Take It Down\n|-\n|Beneath The Southern Sun\n|-\n|Evangeline in The Morning\n|-\n|Love Turns Grey\n|-\n|Drive Me To Nashville\n|-\n|Let There Be Light\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.sunkingrising.com/ Official website]\n*"
