It was built in 1749 by immigrant James Witherspoon (1700-1765), and is a two-story, five-bay, frame \"I-house\" dwelling with a hall and parlor plan and exterior end chimneys.  It features full-length piazzas on the front and rear elevations. To preserve it, the house was moved from an inaccessible rural site to Kingstree on land donated as a memorial park, known as Fluitt-Nelson Memorial Park. The house has been restored to its 18th-century appearance and is open to the public by appointment with the Williamsburg Historical Society.\nIt was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\nReferences"
