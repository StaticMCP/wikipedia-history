However, the Sammarinese government later denied these reports.\nThen, when Italy surrendered, San Marino declared neutrality. On 26 June 1944, the Allied Forces under British command erroneously bombed San Marino in the belief that it was harbouring German forces. On 21 September 1944, San Marino declared war on Germany.\nIn 2023 the two countries signed a double taxation convention.\nReparations\nAt UN-sponsored talks between 17 and 22 July 1961, the British government agreed to pay San Marino reparations to the sum of £80,000 for their part in the erroneous wartime bombing of the republic after the latter had filed a claim for 732 million lire.\nDiplomacy\nHis Majesty's Ambassador to the Italian Republic is accredited as Non-Resident Ambassador to San Marino and the UK Embassy in Rome also covers San Marino. San Marino appoints a non-resident ambassador to the UK, currently a position held by Dario Galassi since 2023. The only diplomatic representation with a physical presence in the UK is the Honorary Consulate, where the current honorary consul is Maurizio Bragagni.\nThe Foreign Minister of San Marino, Luca Beccari, has visited the UK on multiple occasions, as have the various Captains Regent of the country.\nThe British All Party Parliamentary Group on San Marino has paid visit to the country, as has Theresa May shortly after leaving office as Prime Minister.\nSee also\n*Foreign relations of the United Kingdom\n*Foreign relations of San Marino\n*Britons in San Marino\nReferences"
