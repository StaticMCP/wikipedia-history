The former monoclinic structure can reach a maximum packing fraction around 0.77073 for ellipsoids with maximal aspect ratios larger than \\sqrt{3}. The packing fraction of the square-triangle crystal exceeds that of the monoclinic crystal for specific biaxial ellipsoids, like ellipsoids with ratios of the axes \\alpha:\\sqrt{\\alpha}:1 and \\alpha \\in (1.365,1.5625). Any ellipsoids with aspect ratios larger than one can pack denser than spheres.\nSee also\n* Packing problems\n* Sphere packing\n* Tetrahedron packing\nReferences"
