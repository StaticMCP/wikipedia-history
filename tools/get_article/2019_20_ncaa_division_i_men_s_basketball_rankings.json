Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season ended March 12, 2020. As a result, the NCAA did not bestow a national championship. Instead, that title was de facto bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There were two main weekly polls that began in the preseason—the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll.\nKansas, while having not officially made a claim, finished first in both polls.  While the program recognised the Helms Athletic Foundation mythical national championship rankings for the 1921-22 and 1922-23 seasons as national championships, this team has yet to be recognised.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px;\" |\n|

It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775.\n|Week2Date = Nov. 18\n|Week3Date = Nov. 25\n|Week4Date = Dec. 2\n|Week5Date = Dec. 9\n|Week6Date = Dec. 16\n|Week7Date = Dec. 23\n|Week8Date = Dec.
