The ceremony was broadcast on ABC and was hosted by Angela Lansbury. MTV received its first major nomination at this ceremony.\nFor its fourth season, Seinfeld won its first, and only, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. Cheers was once again nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series. It was nominated for all eleven years that it ran and won four times. This tied the record set by M*A*S*H which also went 11/11, but only won once.\nOn the drama side, Northern Exposure was the defending champion and was seen heavily as the favourite coming into the ceremony being the most nominated show with nine major nominations—but in a major upset, Picket Fences took home Outstanding Drama Series. Northern Exposure set the dubious record for the largest shutout of all time, as it lost all 11 major nominations; including its Creative Arts Emmy Awards nominations, the record increases to 0/16. This record would later be tied by The Larry Sanders Show in 1997, but both of these records were later broken by Mad Men (0/17) in 2012, and again by ''The Handmaid's Tale'' (0/21) in 2021.\nWith David Clennon's win for Outstanding Comedy Guest Actor, this was the first time HBO won an Acting Emmy.\nWinners and nominees\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Seinfeld (NBC)'\n** Cheers (NBC)\n** Home Improvement (ABC)\n** The Larry Sanders Show (HBO)\n** Murphy Brown (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Picket Fences (CBS)'\n** Homefront (ABC)\n** ''I'll Fly Away (NBC)\n** Law & Order (NBC)\n** Northern Exposure (CBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Saturday Night Live (NBC)'\n** Late Night with David Letterman (NBC)\n** MTV Unplugged (MTV) (Episode: \"Rod Stewart\")\n** The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (NBC)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Bob Hope: The First 90 Years (NBC)'\n** The 46th Annual Tony Awards (CBS)\n** The 65th Annual Academy Awards (ABC)\n** The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe (Showtime)\n** Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall (PBS)\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Barbarians at the Gate (HBO)\n* Stalin (HBO)'\n** Citizen Cohn (HBO)\n** The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom (HBO)\n** Tru (PBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Prime Suspect II (PBS)'\n** Alex Haley's Queen (CBS)\n** Family Pictures (ABC)\n** The Jacksons: An American Dream (ABC)\n** Sinatra (CBS)\n|}\nActing\nLead performances\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Ted Danson as Sam Malone in Cheers (NBC) (Episode: \"The Guy Can't Help It\")'\n** Tim Allen as Tim Taylor in Home Improvement'' (ABC) (Episode: \"Where There's a Will, There's a Way\")\n** John Goodman as Dan Conner in Roseanne (ABC) (Episode: \"Terms of Estrangement\", Part 2)\n** Jerry Seinfeld as Jerry Seinfeld in Seinfeld (NBC) (Episode: \"The Opera\")\n** Garry Shandling as Larry Sanders in The Larry Sanders Show (HBO) (Episode: \"What Have You Done for Me Lately?\")\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Roseanne Arnold as Roseanne Conner in Roseanne (ABC) (Episode: \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\")'\n** Kirstie Alley as Rebecca Howe in Cheers (NBC) (Episode: \"One for the Road\")\n** Candice Bergen as Murphy Brown in Murphy Brown (CBS) (Episode: \"Games Mothers Play\")\n** Helen Hunt as Jamie Buchman in Mad About You (NBC) (Episode: \"Pilot\")\n** Marion Ross as Sophie Berger in Brooklyn Bridge (CBS) (Episode: \"Brave New Worlds\")\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Tom Skerritt as Jimmy Brock in Picket Fences (CBS) (Episode: \"High Tidings\")'\n** Scott Bakula as Sam Beckett in Quantum Leap (NBC) (Episode: \"Lee Harvey Oswald: October 5, 1957-November 22, 1963\")\n** Michael Moriarty as Ben Stone in Law & Order (NBC) (Episode: \"Night and Fog\")\n** Rob Morrow as Joel Fleischman in Northern Exposure (CBS) (Episode: \"Kaddish for Uncle Manny\")\n** Sam Waterston as Forrest Bedford in ''I'll Fly Away (NBC) (Episode: \"All in the Life\")\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Kathy Baker as Jill Brock in Picket Fences (CBS) (Episode: \"Thanksgiving\")'\n** Swoosie Kurtz as Alex Halsey in Sisters (NBC) (Episode: \"Mirror, Mirror\")\n** Angela Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher in Murder, She Wrote (CBS) (Episode: \"Night of the Coyote\")\n** Regina Taylor as Lilly on I'll Fly Away'' (NBC) (Episode: \"Comfort and Joy\")\n** Janine Turner as Maggie O'Connell in Northern Exposure (CBS) (Episode: \"Love's Labour Mislaid\")\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" |\n* 'Robert Morse as Truman Capote in Tru (PBS)'\n** Robert Blake as John List in Judgment Day: The John List Story (CBS)\n** Robert Duvall as Joseph Stalin in Stalin (HBO)\n** James Garner as F.
