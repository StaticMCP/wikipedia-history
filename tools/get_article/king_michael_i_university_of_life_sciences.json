It was named in honor of King Michael I of Romania.\nHistory\nThe existence of USVT is related to the establishment of the Faculty of Agronomy, within the Polytechnic Institute of Timișoara, by Law no. 617 promulgated by King Michael I on 30 July 1945. In 1948, the Faculty of Agronomy was transformed into an Agronomic Institute. In the same year, the Institute of Zootechnics and Veterinary Medicine was established in Arad, with two faculties: Zootechnics and Veterinary Medicine. In 1955, the Faculty of Zootechnics was transferred to the Agronomic Institute in Timișoara, and in 1957, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was integrated into a similar faculty in Bucharest. In 1957, the Faculty of Zootechnics was transformed into a section of the Faculty of Agronomy and functioned until 1962 under the name of the Faculty of Agriculture and Zootechnics. In 1962, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was established within Timișoara's Agronomic Institute. In 1968, by the Order of the Minister of Education no. 80646, the Faculty of Zootechnics was re-established, the Agronomic Institute functioning, until 1987, with three faculties: Agriculture, Zootechnics and Veterinary Medicine.\nThe overall degradation of the economic and social life, the crisis of the Romanian society and the restructuring of the university life by reduction in 1987 finds the Agronomic Institute with a single faculty with three sections (Agriculture, Zootechnics and Veterinary Medicine). In 1991, based on the Order of the Minister of Education no. 4894, the Agronomic Institute becomes the Banat University of Agricultural Sciences. In 1995, by Government Decision no. 568, the name of the university becomes the Banat University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, and in 2013, by Government Decision no. 493, the institution is named after King Michael I of Romania, the symbolic founder of the university. The current name was approved by Government Decision no. 976 of August 2022.\nFaculties\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Faculty !! Dean !! Bachelor's degreespecializations !!
