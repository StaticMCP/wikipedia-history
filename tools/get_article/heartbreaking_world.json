While every other Squeeze single was written by the team of Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook, this one was penned by Difford and keyboardist Jools Holland.  This is also the only Squeeze single to feature a lead vocal by Holland. Holland's younger brother Chris Holland also plays emulator on this track.\nTrack listing\n7\"\n# \"Heartbreaking World\" (5:07)\n# \"Big Beng\" (4:02)\n10\"\n# \"Heartbreaking World\" (5:07)\n# \"Big Beng\" (4:02)\n# \"By Your Side (live)\" (4:32)\n# \"Tempted (live)\" (4:16)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050816200821/http://www.squeezenet.co.uk/ Squeeze discography at Squeezenet]"
