Their duties consisted of assisting the monarch with dressing in his armour, taking care of the monarch's weapons, and supplying him whenever he was to take arms.\nThe Chief Armourer was also the depositary of the precious Livro do Armeiro-Mor, the oldest and most important roll of arms of the Kingdom, starting with Álvaro da Costa, who occupied the position under King Manuel I in c. 1508–1522. The office became hereditary under Álvaro da Costa, and would later pass to the Counts and Viscounts of Mesquitela.\nList of Chief Armourers of the Kingdom\nTentative list published in Luís Caetano de Lima's Geografia Histórica de Todos os Estados Soberanos da Europa (1734):\n# Vasco Anes Corte-Real\n# Antão de Faria\n# Gomes de Figueiredo\n# Agostinho Caldeira\n# Álvaro da Costa\n# Duarte da Costa\n# Álvaro da Costa\n# Francisco da Costa\n# Gonçalo da Costa\n# Pedro da Costa\n# António Estêvão da Costa\n# José da Costa e Sousa\n# José Francisco da Costa, 2nd Viscount of Mesquitela\n# Luís da Costa de Sousa Macedo e Albuquerque, 1st Count of Mesquitela\nReferences"
