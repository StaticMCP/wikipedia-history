They had been in the top 25 for the prior 312 consecutive weeks, starting with 29 November 1999 (17 seasons). The 312 week run is the third longest streak in history.\nLegend\n{| style=\"border:1px solid black;\"\n| style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Increase in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Decrease in ranking\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px;\" |\n| &nbsp;\n| Not ranked previous week\n|-\n| Italics\n| &nbsp;\n| Number of first place votes\n|-\n| (#-#)\n| &nbsp;\n| Win–loss record\n|-\n| т\n|\n| Tied with team above or below also with this symbol\n|}\nAP Poll\nThis poll is compiled by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play.\nSources:\nThis marks the 40th year of the AP poll which was started in November 1976. Tennessee was not in the initial poll but made the final season poll in the first year and every subsequent year until this year. Texas now has 500 appearances in the poll, joining Tennessee and Georgia with this distinction.\n|Week5-1   \t= Connecticut (6-0) (32)\n|Week5-1-Color \t=\n|Week5-2   \t= South Carolina

It is compiled by a rotating group of 32 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can receive is 800.\nSources:\n|Week4-1   \t= Connecticut (4–0) (32)\n|Week4-1-Color \t=\n|Week4-2   \t= South Carolina (7–0)\n|Week4-2-Color \t=\n|Week4-3   \t= Notre
