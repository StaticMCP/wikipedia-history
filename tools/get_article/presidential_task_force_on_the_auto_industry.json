It reviewed financial and operational restructuring plans submitted by Chrysler and General Motors (GM) and made its own specific recommendations at cabinet level meetings to the President regarding the restructurings and the requests for funds from the companies. Recommendations also included directives on improving wage and benefit structures, and developing competitive fuel efficient cars for the future. In March 2009, the Task Force recommended up to $5 billion in support for automotive industry suppliers, and by late May 2009, following the recommendations of the Task Force, the U.S. government had lent approximately $25 billion in total to the companies. At that time, it was estimated that GM might require $30 billion more to emerge from bankruptcy. By mid-July 2009, both companies had restructured and emerged from bankruptcy. The Task Force was scaled back from \"day to day\" involvement to periodic \"monitoring\".\nAccording to an April 2014 report of the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the U.S. government had lost $11.2 billion (~$}} in ) in its rescue of General Motors. The U.S. government spent $50 billion to bail out GM, meaning it recovered 77.6 percent of its investment amount.\nMembers and official designees\nThe Task Force was composed of the following cabinet members and public officials:\nMembers\n*Co-chairs:\n**Secretary of the Treasury, Tim Geithner\n**National Economic Council Director, Larry Summers\n*Secretary of Transportation\n*Secretary of Commerce\n*Secretary of Labor\n*Secretary of Energy\n*Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, Christina Romer\n*Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Peter R.
