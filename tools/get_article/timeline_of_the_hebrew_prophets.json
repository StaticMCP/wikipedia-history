Daniel's prophetic visions revealed successive empires that would follow, one after the other as well as providing a backdrop of God's eternal, unshakeable kingdom continuing in spite of the earthly upheaval and power struggles. The scholarly view is that the \"prophecy\" of Daniel was written in the 2nd Century B.C. during the time of the Seleucid dynasty.  Note that in Jewish scripture, Daniel is not considered a prophet and is not included among the prophetic books.\n;c. 520 BC&ndash;c. 411 BC: prophecy of Haggiah, Zechariah, Joel(?)\nReturn to the land under Persian rule, and writings of Ezra-Nehemiah\nStory of Esther\n;c. 433 BC [?]: prophecy of Malachi during the times of the Persian Empire\n(535 BC: First portion of Ezra; 515 BC: Second portion of Ezra and Haggai and Zecharia; Joel possibly some time later; 474 BC: Esther; 450 BC: Remainder of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Malachi.)\n;c. 312 BC&ndash;c. 63 BC: Judah's subjugation under the Seleucid Empire\nDuring this period Judah became the sovereign nation of Israel: The Maccabean Revolt 167 to 160 BC\nReferences"
