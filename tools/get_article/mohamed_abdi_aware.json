He was assassinated outside a mosque in Bossaso, capital of Puntland.\nSheikh Mohamed Abdi Aware was notorious for sentencing many Islamists from Al-Shabaab and other rebel movements as well as tens of pirates and human traffickers and putting them into jail. It is thought that his murder was in retaliation to some of these sentences. Police reports two masked gunmen shot him. He suffered injuries to his head and chest and died instantly.\nReferences"
