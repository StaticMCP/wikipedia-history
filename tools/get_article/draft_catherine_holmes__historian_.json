She is Professor of Medieval History at the University of Oxford and a tutorial fellow in history at University College.\nEarly life and education\nHolmes was born in 1968 to George and Patricia Holmes; she has one brother, Robert. Holmes completed her undergraduate studies at the University of Cambridge, where she was introduced to Byzantine studies by Jonathan Shepard. Among her undergraduate tutors were the medievalists Anna Abulafia, David Abulafia and Christine Carpenter.\nHolmes then moved to Balliol College, Oxford for her graduate studies, completing a DPhil under the supervision of James Howard-Johnston and Mark Whittow. Her doctorate focused on the reign of Byzantine emperor Basil II. Holmes later remarked that when she began her graduate work in 1995, \"few emperors had been as comprehensively ignored\" by scholars of Byzantium as Basil. From 1995–7 Holmes held a Jowett senior scholarship at Balliol College and her studies were funded by the British Academy. She completed her doctorate in 1999.\nOf the difficulties of engaging with the historical sources related to Basil II's reign as a graduate student, Holmes stated:\nAcademic career\nIn 1998 Holmes was elected to a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. In 2001 she was elected to a tutorial fellowship in history at University College, Oxford and a university lectureship in medieval history at the University of Oxford. In November 2020 Holmes was awarded the title of distinction of Professor of Medieval History by the University of Oxford. Since September 2025 she has served as the History Faculty's director of undergraduate studies.\nResearch\nHolmes expanded her doctoral dissertation into her first monograph, Basil II and the Governance of Empire (976–1025), published in 2005 by Oxford University Press as part of their Oxford Studies in Byzantium series. Reviewing the book for Speculum, Walter Kaegi praised it, and the dissertation preceding it, as a \"long-overdue and balanced study\" of the Greek sources relating to Basil II's reign, focusing specifically on the histories of Michael Psellos and John Skylitzes.\nFor Skylitzes's account, Holmes \"stresses the theme of aristocratic cooperation and enthusiasm\" as being particularly relevant \"for the early Komnenian dynastic context of the 1090s\". Kaegi notes that Holmes \"plausibly\" dates his work to that decade rather than the 1070s as previous scholars had. For Kaegi, Holmes \"could have made more use of archaeology\" and utilised more foreign-language research, but classed the work overall as \"a well-proportioned study that takes account of the most important recent discoveries and changes in interpretation\".\nOn the insights to be drawn from Holmes' monograph, Kaegi concluded that:\nIn addition to her monograph, Holmes has co-edited three collections of essays which have signified an expansion of her research interests beyond the Byzantine Empire. The first, co-edited with Judith Waring and published in 2002, explored literacy and scribal culture inside and outside Byzantium. The second, co-edited with Jonathan Harris and Eugenia Russell and published in 2012, focused more broadly on cross-cultural interaction in the eastern Mediterranean after 1150. The third, co-edited with Jonathan Shepard, Jo van Steenbergen and Björn Weiler and published in 2023, moved even further afield to compare the political cultures of the Latin West, Byzantium and the Islamic world in the Middle Ages.\nIn 2018 Holmes also co-edited with Naomi Standen a special issue of the journal Past & Present entitled The Global Middle Ages, a further reflection of her expanding focus. This issue presented findings funded by an Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) grant entitled 'Defining the Global Middle Ages', of which Holmes was principal investigator between January 2013 and March 2015. Holmes is also a member of the supervisory board of the AHRC-funded project 'Noblesse Oblige? 'Barons' and the Public Good in Medieval Afro-Eurasia', based at the University of Exeter.\nEditorial roles\nFrom 2013 until 2021, Holmes was an editor of The English Historical Review. She remains a member of their editorial board. Holmes also sits on the editorial board of the Oxford Studies in Byzantium series at Oxford University Press.\nPublic lectures\nIn May 2021, Holmes gave a public lecture to the Royal Historical Society entitled 'The Making and Breaking of Kinetic Empire: Mobility, Communication and Political Change in the Eastern Mediterranean, c.950–1100 C.E.'. In December 2022, this lecture was published as an article in the society's Transactions journal.\nHonours and awards\nHolmes was elected a fellow of the Royal Historical Society in May 2021.\nPersonal life\nPolitics\nIn June 2011, Holmes was one of many members of the University of Oxford's Congregation to vote that they had no confidence in the policies of the then-Minister of State for Universities, Science and Cities, David Willetts.\nBibliography\n*Literacy, Education and Manuscript Transmission in Byzantium and Beyond (co-editor with Judith Waring; Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2002)\n*Basil II and the Governance of Empire (976–1025) (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005)\n*Byzantines, Latins, and Turks in the Eastern Mediterranean World after 1150 (co-editor with Jonathan Harris and Eugenia Russell; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012)\n*The Global Middle Ages (special issue of Past & Present; co-editor with Naomi Standen; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018)\n*Political Culture in the Latin West, Byzantium and the Islamic World, c.700–c.1500: A Framework for Comparing Three Spheres (co-editor with Jonathan Shepard, Jo van Steenbergen and Björn Weiler; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2021)\nReferences"
