Qualifying for the 2021 NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Tournament, the program ranked as the #8 seed.\nThe Colonials' five-girl senior class featured Emily Curlett, named an assistant captain, and Emilie Harley as well as forwards Anjelica Diffendal, Lexi Templeman, who served in the role of team captain, and goaltender Molly Singewald.\nDuring the first period of a January 30, 2021 tilt versus the Rochester Institute of Technology Tigers, team captain Lexi Templeman recorded the first natural hat trick of her career, part of a four-point offensive outburst in a 7-0 shutout win. It marked the first natural hat trick scored by a Colonials skater since Michaela Boyle achieved the feat on November 24, 2019.\nOn Senior Night, celebrated on February 20, 2021, goaltender Molly Singewald made her first career start. A member of the Colonials Class of 2021, she recorded a shutout victory.\nMaking their fifth consecutive appearance in the CHA championship game, Gillian Thompson would score the game’s only goal, while Raygan Kirk recorded 36 saves in a tightly contested 1-0 victory on March 6 versus the Syracuse Orange, resulting in their third playoff crown.\nOffseason\nRecruiting\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \"\n| Molly Pedone||Forward ||  || Played at Shattuck St. Mary's\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \"\n| Ellie Marcovsky ||Forward ||   ||Competed with the Selects Hockey Academy U19 program\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \"\n|Chace Sperling  || Defense||  || Graduate of the Pursuit of Excellence Hockey Academy\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\" \"\n|}\nStandings\nRoster\n2020–21 Colonials\n2020-21 schedule\nSource:\n|-\n!colspan=12 style=\" background:#0a2351;
