The series stars Sylvester Stallone as Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi, an American Mafia caporegime who has been recently released from prison in New York and is sent to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he begins to set up a criminal organization. It is Stallone's first leading role in a scripted television series.\nThe series also stars Andrea Savage, Martin Starr, Jay Will, Max Casella, Domenick Lombardozzi, Vincent Piazza, A. C. Peterson, Garrett Hedlund, and Dana Delany. After receiving an early premiere in theaters on October 29, 2022, the series was released on Paramount+ from November 13, 2022, to January 8, 2023. Shortly after premiering, Tulsa King was renewed for a second season, which premiered on September 15, 2024 and concluded on November 17.\nTerence Winter was the showrunner for the first season, but due to differences with Sheridan, he was demoted to head writer before the second, while director Craig Zisk produced the second season. Dave Erickson took over as showrunner for the third season. The first season was largely filmed in Oklahoma City, but primary production on the second season relocated to Atlanta after the cast and crew complained. Annabella Sciorra, Tatiana Zappardino, Frank Grillo, and Neal McDonough joined the second-season main cast. Paramount later confirmed the third season renewal by announcing the start of production. A fourth season as well as a spin-off series called NOLA King which will star Samuel L. Jackson, have both been ordered. The third season premiered on September 21, 2025.\nThe series has proved to be a success by providing a television ratings boost during its broadcast on Paramount Network and setting viewership records on Paramount+. Critics have given Tulsa King generally positive reviews. Many have praised Stallone's performance, but some criticized the dialogue and overall story arc. In 2023, Tulsa King was nominated for a Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award.\nPremise\nDwight \"The General\" Manfredi is the American Mafia capo from New York City who has just finished serving a 25-year prison sentence. Upon release, Dwight's boss sends him to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to establish criminal operations there. Dwight, who does not know anyone in the area, seeks a new crew to help him establish his empire. He first meets taxi driver Tyson Mitchell, whom he recruits as his personal driver, and acquires financing by threatening and later befriending Lawrence \"Bodhi\" Geigerman, the owner of a local dispensary. While attempting to grow his enterprise, Dwight gains many more associates, including Mitch Keller, who owns a bar Dwight frequents. Dwight initially remains in contact with the syndicate in New York but later begins to despise them. Dwight and his crew become enemies with the outlaw biker gang The Black Macadams. During this time, Dwight experiences personal and family problems as a result of his actions.  Stacy Beale, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE; commonly known as ATF) agent and Dwight's love interest, investigates Dwight's actions and those of his crew.\nCast and characters\nOverview\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Seasons\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\" | 1\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\" | 2\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20%;\" | 3\n|-\n| Sylvester Stallone\n| Dwight Manfredi\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Andrea Savage\n| Stacy Beale\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\n|-\n| Martin Starr\n| Lawrence \"Bodhi\" Geigerman\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Jay Will\n| Tyson Mitchell\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| Max Casella\n| Armand \"Manny\" Truisi\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\n|-\n| Domenick Lombardozzi\n| Chickie Invernizzi\n| colspan=\"2\"\n|\n|-\n| Vincent Piazza\n| Vince Antonacci\n| colspan=\"3\"\n|-\n| A.C.

Bevilaqua demands compensation from Dwight for operating in Tulsa. Dwight firmly refuses, declaring that he answers to no one and owns Tulsa. The jury finds Dwight not guilty. Later, Chickie orders Goodie to lure Dwight out of the casino, where Carl, Bevilaqua's enforcer, plans to ambush him. During Dwight's celebration party, Goodie informs him that Carl wants to meet.

Dwight later visits New York for a sit down with Ray Renzetti, a senior mafioso, who offers him a senior New York role which Dwight declines, but who then threatens Dwight for refusing to cut him in on Dwight's Tulsa operation. Dwight attempts to separate himself from Margaret anticipating that she will otherwise be compromised by Musso. Mitch runs into Cleo Montague at the car dealership, who tells him that her father's distillery business is under threat from a rival, Jeremiah Dunmire, and wants to sell: Dwight decides he's interested, but at a subsequent meeting with Theodore Montague his initial offer is refused, with Theodore citing a prior commitment with Dunmire. Bodhi, Grace and Tyson are sent to make a cash drop to Bevilaqua's crew, using Bodhi's electric car which requires a change of location due to range limits. At the meet, the bag turns out to contain Bodhi's books instead of cash, so Bodhi and one of the crew return for the cash, who Bodhi subsequently threatens at gunpoint because he was Jimmy's killer. Cole Dunmire, Jeremiah's son, reveals to him that Theodore Montague has decided to accept Dwight's offer.

He left of his own accord before season three, but eventually returned for season four.|alt=Terrence Winter]]\nOn December 6, 2021, it was reported Taylor Sheridan and Terence Winter were developing a series titled Kansas City for the digital streaming platform Paramount+. The series was created by Sheridan, who had signed a multi-year contract with ViacomCBS to create new series during the COVID-19 pandemic. The series would be centered around Sal, an Italian-American mobster from New York City who is tasked with returning the mafia to Kansas City, Missouri. Sheridan, Winter and series-star Sylvester Stallone were announced as executive producers alongside Braden Aftergood from Stallone's banner Balboa Productions which was served as co-producer for the series along with Sheridan's company Bosque Ranch Productions; and David C. Glasser, Ron Burkle and Bob Yari from the production company 101 Studios who would also be serveed as co-producer. Winter was also the series' showrunner, as MTV Entertainment Studios will be producing the upcoming television series as producer.\nSheridan wrote the pilot episode in a week. Winter moved the show's setting to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to give the characters a more-remote setting. In 2022, Deadline Hollywood stated the show was given a straight-to-series order under the title Tulsa King to reflect the change in location. Stallone involved himself in several aspects of the production. Winter noted: \"With Stallone, you're getting a writer, a director, a producer, an editor\"; and Glasser said Stallone was \"heavily involved in the editing process\".\nOn November 30, 2022, Tulsa King was renewed for a second season. The following February, it was announced Winter had resigned as showrunner due to \"creative differences\"; a new showrunner was sought but Winter would remain as an executive producer of the show. It was later revealed Sheridan had dismissed Winter because of differences in writing style; Sheridan stated he preferred character-driven plots whereas Winter preferred plot-driven characters. In February 2024, Winter was re-hired as a writer after an opening in his schedule due to delays caused by the 2023 Writers' Guild of America strike. In his modified position, Winter is the series' head writer and works outside Sheridan's direct supervision. Sheridan chose not to use a conventional showrunner for the second season and instead decided to hire a director and executive producer to oversee day-to-day production. It was announced Craig Zisk would fill this role.\nIn November 2024, it announced that Tulsa King was on track to secure a third and fourth season renewal. Winter once again resigned from the series in order to work on the untitled Sammy the Bull series for FX. A third season was officially confirmed in March 2025. At this time, it was reported that Dave Erickson would fill the position of a traditional showrunner, with Zisk's status unknown. Ahead of the season three premiere, it was reported that a fourth season had been ordered. Erickson will depart the show due to obligations on another Sheridan series, Mayor of Kingstown, and Winter is set to once again join the program, returning in a head writer and executive producer capacity. By August 2025, during the production of the third season, Paramount Television Studios had taken over production of the series following the merger of MTV Entertainment Studios' parent company Paramount Global with Skydance Media into Paramount Skydance.\nCasting\nstars in the series lead role as Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi. |alt=Sylvester Stallone]]\nAt the time the series was announced, Sylvester Stallone was participating in negotiations to star as Tulsa King lead character Sal in his scripted television debut. Stallone's character was later renamed Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi. Stallone stated filming television was more difficult and time-consuming than the films in which he had starred. On March 24, 2022, Max Casella, Domenick Lombardozzi, Vincent Piazza and Jay Will were added to the cast; Casella, Lombardozzi and Piazza portray members of the Invernizzi family crime syndicate while Will stars as a recent college graduate who becomes a member of Dwight's crew. In May, A. C. Peterson, Andrea Savage, Garrett Hedlund and Martin Starr were reported to be starring in the series; they were followed in July by Dana Delany and Annabella Sciorra in August. Miles Mussenden also stars in the series. Stallone's daughter Scarlet appears in the series as Spencer, a barista and stable hand who is recruited to work with Dwight. Scarlet was originally considered for the role of Stallone's on-screen daughter but was considered too young for the role, which instead went to Tatiana Zappardino. Additional casting for minor characters and background actors occurred in May 2022.\nBefore production of the second season, Sciorra and Zappardino were promoted to the main cast. Frank Grillo also joined the main cast, starring as Bill Bevilaqua, a mobster from Kansas City. On May 1, 2024, it was reported Neal McDonough would appear as Cal Thresher. Two days later, Rich Ting was cast in the recurring role of Jackie Ming. Jelly Roll, an American singer, songwriter, and rapper, made a cameo appearance as himself. He said he had been a fan of the series and is friends with Sistine, another daughter of Stallone's, who made the necessary connections. Casting for additional extras in the second season occurred in June 2024.\nDuring filming for the second season, Stallone and an unnamed director were accused of making disparaging remarks about background extras. Stallone was allegedly heard calling certain background actors \"ugly\", \"tub of lard\" and \"fat guy with a cane\". Stallone also suggested the production should instead cast \"pretty young girls to be around me\". The Atlanta-based casting agency Rose Locke & CL Casting, which had been responsible for hiring extras, resigned from the production soon after. Zisk responded to the comments through TMZ by denying the statements were made and stating the casting agency had hired extras who were older than the requested age range. CNN reported Paramount was investigating the allegations and that no formal complaints had been filed. The actors' labor union SAG-AFTRA also responded to the allegations, saying its scope does not include background actors in Atlanta but that it would provide any requested guidance; it also issued a statement condemning such comments toward any actor. Thomas Mooneyham, a background actor on the series, stated he believed the comments were about him after he and another extra were replaced with younger people. Stallone did not respond to the allegations.\nIn November 2024, Stallone signed a contract to star in a third and fourth season of the program. With this, he reportedly received a raise after making  and  per episode in the first two seasons, respectively. In March 2025, Chris Caldovino, McKenna Quigley Harrington, and Mike \"Cash Flo\" Walden were promoted to series regulars for season three.\nIn November 2025, Gretchen Mol joined cast as a new series regular for the fourth season.\nProduction design\nThe series' costume designer Suzanne McCabe based many outfits on the Gambino crime family and Franzese Crew, as well as photographs from newspaper clippings in the 1980s; she cited John Gotti as an inspiration. McCabe also stated she tried to mostly use monochromatic colors for the show's costumes, using dark colors for the New York City-filmed scenes and softer colors for scenes in Oklahoma to represent that state's red soil. Sylvester Stallone was allowed to pick many elements of his own costumes, including bolo ties, jewelry and shoes. Production designer Todd Jeffery used a mix of soundstages and on-location filming for Tulsa King. The sets for \"The Higher Plane\" dispensary featured in the series was created in a former Texaco gas station. Mirrors were used in a scene that was filmed in a strip club to make the space appear larger. Location manager Patrick Mignanom was tasked with finding a dilapidated structure whose owner would be content with having it blown up. Saunder Jurriaans and Danny Bensi composed Tulsa Kings theme song.\nFilming\nin Oklahoma City, which also housed production offices.|alt=The exterior of a large building located in Oklahoma City that is used as film and television studios]]\nPrincipal photography occurred over six months in Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Bethany, concluding on August 31, 2022. Some filming occurred at Tulsa International Airport on March 29, 2022. Additional locations used in Tulsa include Center of the Universe and the Mayo Hotel. Other scenes were filmed on-location in Brooklyn, New York. The series interior scenes and production offices were housed at Prairie Surf Studios. Additional photography wrapped by October. Filming in Oklahoma boosted the state's economy by an estimated $56 million.\nIt was later reported the show's second season would not be filmed in Oklahoma due to costs, and complaints from the cast and crew, who did not like the extreme temperatures there. Filming on the second season occurred in the Atlanta, Georgia, suburb Norcross, using Eagle Rock Studios for sound stages. Filming began on April 1, 2024, and was scheduled to run until July 31. Some filming also took place in Gainesville, Georgia. Jelly Roll's scenes were filmed in April while he was touring for his latest studio album Beautifully Broken and was in the area. Stallone improvised lines for this scene which featured Jelly Roll performing a rendition of his song \"I Am Not Okay\". A second unit filmed b-roll scenes in Tulsa in mid-June 2024. Filming for the second season wrapped on August 2.\nFilming for the third season began in March 2025, with production taking place in Atlanta and Oklahoma. The first episode was directed by Jim McKay. Filming wrapped on July 2, 2025.\nFilming for the fourth season began in November 2025.\nRelease\nThe series premiere episode of Tulsa King received an early promotional screening with the fifth-season premiere of Yellowstone in AMC Theatres on October 29–30, 2022. Tulsa King began its weekly release schedule on Paramount+ from November 13. The series' first two episodes were broadcast on Paramount Network on November 20 and 27, serving as a lead-out for episodes of Yellowstone. The first season concluded on January 8, 2023.

CNN Entertainments Brian Lowery described the series as an \"odd mix of attributes\" but praised the series' use of time. Reviewing for The Guardian, Lucy Mangan praised the comedy aspect of the series but failed to see it innovating further. Los Angeles Times writer Robert Lloyd called the series \"likeable\", commending its use of comedy and character focus.\nTulsa King was often compared poorly to Winter's and Sheridan's other series; Sheridan was overseeing eight other series at the time Tulsa King debuted. The Hollywood Reporters Daniel Fienberg wrote Sheridan's and Winter's main strength is not in comedy writing, despite the series being primarily marketed as a comedy. Fienberg goes on to state: \"the first two episodes definitely give the impression of being something that Sheridan, Paramount+'s golden goose at this point, gestated between work on 15 different Yellowstone sequels and prequels\". According to Anita Singh of The Daily Telegraph: \"One of the writers, Terence Winter, has The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire on his CV, but this show is to The Sopranos what Paw Patrol is to the works of David Attenborough\".\nWriting for the National Public Radio (NPR) talk show Fresh Air, David Bianculli compared the formula of Tulsa King to that of Yellowstone and noted the \"sense of time passing and the importance of family\". Stephan Lee with The Wrap said there is a \"distinct straight-to-DVD quality to Tulsa King\" but suggests the series stands on its own and is only poor when compared to Sheridan's and Winter's other works. Ben Travers of IndieWire described Tulsa King as \"less serious\" and a \"breath of fresh air\" compared to the seriousness and consequences in Sheridan's other series.\nStallone's acting received the highest praise from critics, although some criticized it for its lack of originality. Reviewing the first two episodes for Variety, Joshua Alston credited most of the series' success to Stallone, stating: \"Tulsa King isn't a great show with him, but it would be far less interesting without him\". Richard Roeper, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, said the series was written to Stallone's strengths. The A.V. Clubs Todd Lazarski also praised Stallone's acting but described the series as an \"undercooked fish-out-of-water mob story\". USA Today writer Kelly Lawler criticized both the overall concept and Stallone saying he is \"probably the king of something, but it's certainly not Tulsa, Oklahoma\", and called the show \"bad Goodfellas fan fiction\".\nSeason 2\nJeff Ewing with Collider wrote that the second season \"introduced new threats, but struggles to find its tone\", feeling that it started off with too many filler episodes before building exposition in the later episodes.\nDeciders Joek Keller stated that Tulsa King \"has become less of a fish out of water story and more of a story about just what kind of absurd scheme Dwight and his motley crew can pull off\". He further elaborated by saying that the first episode addressed too many storylines at one time and believing that it is becoming more focused on comedy than crime. Writing for EscribiendoCine, Emiliano Basile praised Stallone's acting, writing that he \"gives his character the characteristic charisma and powerful phrases that have accompanied him since Rocky.\" Basile also applauded the series costume design, and highlighted Sheridan's views on cultural views in the United States.\nThe Quapaw Nation issued a statement during the broadcast of Tulsa Kings second season, criticizing its portrayal of fictional tribal leaders in criminal conspiracies. They stated that production members did not give the tribe the chance to review the potential use of a fictionalized portrayal of themselves and that it \"constituted cultural appropriation\". In a follow-up statement, they later declared that a \"positive resolution\" had been reached with Paramount.\nAwards and nominations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year !! Award !! Category !!

The series was ordered under the title NOLA King on June 5, 2025, with Samuel L. Jackson taking on the lead role of Russell Lee Washington, Jr., a character similar to Stallone's. He will executive produce the project alongside Glasser and Erickson, the latter of who will also write and showrun the series. Like Tulsa King, it will be produced by 101 Studios and MTV Entertainment Studios Jackson's character is set to be introduced during a multi-episode third season story arc; the program will then begin filming in February, with Erickson departing from Tulsa King to work on the spin-off instead. However, Erickson's remaining obligations to Tulsa King and Mayor of Kingstown, another series of Sheridan's, forced him to step down as showrunner of the spin-off after writing the pilot episode in July. At that time it was reported that the search for a replacement was underway.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
