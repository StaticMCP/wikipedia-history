Fisher Award and Lectureship) is a very high recognition of achievement and scholarship in statistical science that recognizes the highly significant impact of statistical methods on scientific investigations. The award was funded in 1963 by the North American Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) \"to honor both the contributions of Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher and the work of a present–day statistician for their advancement of statistical theory and applications.\" The COPSS Starting in 1964, the Distinguished Lecture is given at the Joint Statistical Meetings in North America and is subsequently published in a statistics journal. The lecturer receives a plaque and a cash award of US$2,000. It is given every year if a nominee considered eligible and worthy is found, which one was in all but five years up to 1984, and in all years since. In June 2020, the name of the award was changed to its current name after discussions concerning Fisher's controversial views on race and eugenics.\nPast recipients of the award\n*1964 Maurice Bartlett\n*1965 Oscar Kempthorne\n*1967 John Tukey\n*1968 Leo Goodman\n*1970 Leonard Savage\n*1971 Cuthbert Daniel\n*1972 William G.

A. Fisher was a eugenicist. A petition to \"Rename The Fisher Lecture After David Blackwell\" was initiated by Miles Ott (Smith) on Change.org. The COPSS leadership responded by soliciting input via an online form on the official website.\nHarry Crane (Rutgers), Joseph Guinness (Cornell) and Ryan Martin (NCSU) posted a comment arguing against the renaming on June 13, 2020. They argued that the lectureship was established to honor Fisher's scientific achievement, not the scientist. They proposed to amend the description of the lectureship instead of renaming it.\nOn June 15 the Executive Director of ASA, Ron Wasserstein, notified its members that the leadership has recommended changing the lectureship name to COPSS. The process that led to the decision was unclear. Ron commented on Twitter, \"There is no principle of greater value than the principle of strengthening the statistical community by moving forward to form a more just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive society\".\nOn June 23, the name R. A. Fisher Award and Lectureship was officially retired and the announced recipient of the award for 2020, Kathryn Roeder, was to receive the award under the new name. The chair of COPSS, Bhramar Mukherjee, also made the announcement on Twitter. In their statement, the COPSS mentioned that they retired the previous name of the award \"to advance a more just, equitable, diverse, and inclusive statistical community.\"\nOther lecture series named after R. A. Fisher\nTwo other series of lectures are also named after R. A. Fisher:\n*The Fisher Memorial Lecture on an application of mathematics to biology,  usually given in the UK, first given in 1964\n* The Sir Ronald Fisher Lecture on genetics, evolutionary biology or statistics, given at the University of Adelaide, Australia, first given in 1990\nSee also\n* COPSS Presidents' Award\n* International Prize in Statistics\n* Guy Medals\n* List of mathematics awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://community.amstat.org/copss/awards/copss-lecture Official website]"
