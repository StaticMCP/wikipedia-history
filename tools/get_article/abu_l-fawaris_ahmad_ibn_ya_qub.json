Abu'l-Fawaris was active in the reign of the Fatimid imam-caliph al-Hakim (), and a contemporary of the fellow Isma'ili scholars, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Naysaburi and Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani. All three elaborated Isma'ili ideas about the Imamate, apparently independently, since they do not cite each other's works.\nAbu'l-Fawaris' only known work is the Risāla fi’l-imāma ('Epistle on the Imamate'), likely composed before 1017, is divided in sixteen chapters, deliberately chosen to correspond with al-Hakim being the sixteenth Isma'ili imam. In it, Abu'l-Fawaris argues about the existence of the imamate as a necessity, as the Quran, the  (the body of Islamic law) and the  (the traditions ascribed to Muhammad) are not sufficient. The treatise has been published in a critical edition with English translation by Sami N. Makarem as The Political Doctrine of the Ismāʿīlīs: The Imamate. Caravan Books, Delmar, New York, 1977.\nReferences\nSources\n*  }}"
