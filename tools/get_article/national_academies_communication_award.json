The awards were established in 2003 and administered by the Keck Futures Initiative, a project of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine that was funded by the W.M. Keck Foundation.

The Awards continued through 2019. A $20,000 prize was awarded in each of four categories: Book, Film/Radio/TV, Magazine/Newspaper, and Online. The Online category was created in 2009.\nIn 2022, the National Academies launched, in partnership with Schmidt Futures, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Awards for Excellence in Science Communication to recognize and develop excellence in science communication by research scientists and by early career, local, and freelance science journalists.  The program provides winners with cash awards as well as training and resources to further expand their communication skills.\nList of recipients\nBook\n{|\n|2019\n|Carl Zimmer\n|She Has Her Mother’s Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity\n\"A sweeping yet engaging examination from a personal perspective of the evolving nature of the scientific understanding of heredity across the centuries.
