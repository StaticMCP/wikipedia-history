The software was developed and distributed by the former PowerQuest Corporation, beginning in 1997. It runs under MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows environment.\nDrive Image version 7 became the basis for Norton Ghost 9.0, which was released in August 2004.\nOverview\nDrive Image 1.0 was released in September 1997.\nDrive Image 2002 (version 6) is the last release that allows the creation of a rescue set on floppy disk, which can be used to create and restore an image.\nDrive Image version 7 was the last version published under the PowerQuest corporate brand. It was also the first version to include a native Windows interface for cloning an active system partition; prior versions required a reboot into a DOS-like environment in order to clone the active partition. In order to clone active partitions without requiring a reboot, Drive Image 7 employed a volume snapshot device driver which was licensed from StorageCraft Technology Corporation.\nDrive Image version 7 became the basis for Norton Ghost 9.0, which was released to retail markets in August 2004. Ghost was a competing product, developed by Binary Research, before Symantec bought the company in 1998.\nSee also\n*List of disk cloning software\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.broadcom.com/products/cybersecurity Symantec Corporation website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051230155343/http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,111800,00.asp Drive Image v7 review by PCWorld]"
