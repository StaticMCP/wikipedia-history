He reveals that he used government assistance to survive during that period.\nHe goes on to explain that this tragedy motivated him to work harder and eventually run for office. He then explains how he handles congressional bills and politics in general, including his experience as a vice presidential nominee in 2012. He stresses the idea that civil society, not government, is what leads to job creation and growth.\nRyan goes on to argue that Republicans should stop preaching to the choir and start reaching out to new voters like Hispanics and African Americans.\nCritical reception\nThe book was only sold as an e-book on Amazon.com until Ryan complained about it on television. It was then sold at a discounted price with a quick shipping period.\nIn The National Review, George Will praised the book, suggesting it was a response to President Barack Obama from \"a man who has a better mind and better manners\". Similarly, Peter Wehner of Commentary Magazine described it as \"both candid and self-reflective, and at times even self-critical\".\nWriting for The American Conservative, Ross Kaminsky suggested, \"It is not an election tell-all, nor a screed intended to rile up the right-wing or harangue Democrats.\" He added, \"Ryan's book is reasoned and explained well enough that even the mainstream media is having a hard time criticizing it.\" He concluded that the book was \"a welcome and valuable addition to our ongoing political conversation\". In The Washington Post, Matt Miller compared it to \"drooled-upon pages of Ayn Rand\". However, he agreed with Ryan that health-care expenditure would have to be curtailed.\nReferences"
