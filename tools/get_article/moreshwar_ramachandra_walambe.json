He wrote style guides and textbooks on the grammar of Marathi.\nEarly life and education\nWalambe was born at Ramadurg in the state of Karnataka, India. After completing his primary education at Mudhol, he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from Rajaram College, Kolhapur. He served in various capacities as a school teacher, educator and editor of textbooks at several educational institutions in Maharashtra, including a fifteen-year stint at the New English School in Satara and another of equal length at the New English School in Pune. He was also instrumental in the compilation of Marathi dictionaries for Tilak Smarak Mandir, Pune.\nCareer\nWalambe's interest and command of the rules governing the stylistic aspects of written Marathi led him to work as a proofreader for Marathi publishing houses, and as a pro bono consultant for printing presses. His treatise  'सुगम मराठी व्याकरण व लेखन' has become a standard reference in this area.\nWalambe was an avid reader of Marathi literature. He nurtured close personal friendships with several prominent Marathi writers, such as V.S. Khandekar, G. D. Madgular, N. S. Phadke and Malati Bedekar.
