It was originally built around the 1980s and reopened in 2005, covering an area of almost 59 acres. Named after King Abdulaziz ibn Saud, the park mostly gets frequented by families on weekends and on holidays during Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and Saudi National Day.\nOverview\nThe park was originally built around the 1980s but was later closed to the general public by the Riyadh Municipality, following which it was kept under constant maintenance and renovation. By mid-2005, the park prepared itself to be reopened in September 2005 by Prince Abdulaziz bin Mohammed bin Ayyaf, the-then mayor of Riyadh. Al Riyadh reported that within a week after its inauguration, the park received over 20 thousand visitors.\nIn 2009, Riyadh Municipality held several events at the park during the Eid holidays, such as the Telematch-based game competition for children. The park hosted a wide range of entertainment and cultural activities during the Eid holidays in 2010. In 2011, the Saudi National Day celebrations were organized by the Riyadh Municipality in the park, followed by similar Eid al-Fitr celebrations the next year in 2012.\nReferences"
