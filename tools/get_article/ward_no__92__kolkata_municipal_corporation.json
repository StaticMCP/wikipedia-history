The Municipal Consolidation Act of 1888 and certain steps taken thereafter saw the addition of peripheral areas in the eastern and southern parts of the  city to the corporation area. In 1888, there were 75 commissioners, 50 of whom were elected, 15 appointed by the government and 10 nominated from bodies like Chambers of Commerce, Trades Associations and the Port Commissioners.  The Calcutta Municipal Act of 1923 brought about important changes. The adjacent municipalities of Cossipore, Chitpore, Manicktola and Garden Reach were amalgamated with Kolkata. Garden Reach was later taken out.\nPost-independence developments saw the introduction of adult franchise in municipal elections in 1962. The number of wards increased from 75 to 100. Tollygunge was merged with Kolkata in 1953. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act 1980, which came into effect in 1984, extended the boundaries of Kolkata by including South Suburban, Garden Reach and Jadavpur municipalities in Kolkata. With the addition of Joka to Kolkata, the number of wards rose to 144.\nGeography\nWard No. 92 is bordered on the north by Sarat Ghosh Garden Road and Budge Budge branch of Eastern Railway; on the east by Kalipada Roy Lane, Jheel Road and the western boundary of former Haltu Union Board; on the south by Jadavpur Station Road, Garfa Road and the northern boundary of former Haltu Union Board; and on the west by Raja Subodh Chandra Mullick Road and Gariahat Road (South).\nThe ward is served by Kasba and Jadavpur police stations of Kolkata Police.\nPatuli Women police station has jurisdiction over all police districts under the jurisdiction of South Suburban Division i.e. Netaji Nagar, Jadavpur, Kasba, Regent Park, Bansdroni, Garfa and Patuli.\nDemographics\nAs per the 2011 Census of India, Ward No. 92, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, had a total population of 36,450, of which 17,865 (49%) were males and 18,585 (51%) were females.
