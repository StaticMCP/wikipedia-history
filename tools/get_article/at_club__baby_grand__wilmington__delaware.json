Bailey keeps up with things and Schwartz gets a word in now and then, but this is Smith's show all the way.\"\nTrack listing\nAt Club \"Baby Grand\" Wilmington, Delaware, Vol. 1\nAt Club \"Baby Grand\" Wilmington, Delaware, Vol. 2\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n* Jimmy Smith – organ\n* Thornel Schwartz – guitar\n* Donald Bailey – drums\nTechnical personnel\n* Alfred Lion – producer\n* Rudy Van Gelder – recording engineer\n* Reid Miles – design\n* Francis Wolff – photography\n* Leonard Feather – liner notes\nReferences"
