It was a descendant of the Havana Infantry Regiment Band (Banda de Música del Regimiento de Infantería de La Habana). It plays an important role in providing accompaniment for military parades that take place on Revolution Square on January 2. This group is also present at ceremonial activities on the island. In May 2007, the band took part in the welcoming of the Capitán Miranda of the National Navy of Uruguay at Havana Harbor. During the state visit of President Barack Obama to Havana, Obama greeted Ney Miguel Milanes Gálvez and praised the band for their performance of The Star-Spangled Banner saying that they did a \"Good job\".
