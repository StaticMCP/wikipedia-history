After one season, Stewart moved to St Mirren and went on loan to Alloa Athletic. In 2018, he joined Ross County, spending three seasons with the club before joining Sunderland in 2021 and helping them win promotion to the Championship. Stewart then signed for Southampton in 2023.\nClub career\nJunior League\nAfter spells with the youth systems of professional clubs, Stewart started his career in the Scottish Juniors with Ardeer Thistle and Kilwinning Rangers, before making the step-up to senior football with Albion Rovers in July 2016. The part-time Coatbridge club were unable to pay the £1,500 transfer fee, with the funds instead provided by their supporters' club members and by Stewart's father.\nSt Mirren\nAfter just one season with Albion Rovers, Stewart signed for Scottish Championship club St Mirren on a two-year full-time contract (a goalkeeper with the same name also joined at the time). Stewart scored on his debut for the Paisley club in a Scottish League Cup win versus Stranraer but failed to break into the first-team and was loaned out to Scottish League One club Alloa Athletic in December 2017, for the remainder of the season.\nRoss County\nOn 10 August 2018, Stewart signed for Ross County. He made his debut for the club in a 2–1 victory in the Scottish Challenge Cup against Heart of Midlothian Colts. Stewart scored his first goal for the club in the next round of the cup in a win against Montrose. He finished his first season at Ross County with 11 goals, three of them coming against County's Rivals Inverness Caledonian Thistle as Ross County were promoted to the Scottish Premiership.\nSunderland\nOn 31 January 2021, Stewart joined English side Sunderland for an undisclosed fee. Stewart scored on his Sunderland debut after coming on as a substitute against Accrington Stanley in a 2–0 away win on 17 March 2021. He was later given the nickname 'Loch Ness Drogba' by Sunderland supporters in reference to his Scottish heritage and comparisons with prolific former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba.\nOn 21 May 2022, Stewart scored the second goal in the 2022 EFL League One play-off final as Sunderland defeated Wycombe Wanderers 2–0 to gain promotion back to the EFL Championship. He finished the season as the league's joint top goalscorer with 26 goals and was later voted the PFA Fans' Player of the Year for League One.\nDuring a 1–1 draw with Fulham on 28 January 2023 in the FA Cup fourth round, he was forced off in the first half after suffering an achilles injury. A week later, it was confirmed that Stewart would miss the remainder of the 2022–23 season.\nSouthampton\nOn 1 September 2023, Stewart joined Southampton on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut for the club on 11 November 2023 in a 2–1 victory against West Bromwich Albion, replacing Adam Armstrong in the 83rd minute. During Southampton's 1–1 draw with Huddersfield Town on 25 November 2023, Stewart picked up an injury, with manager Russell Martin later confirming he was expected to be sidelined until late January. On 22 December 2023, it was confirmed that the injury to his hamstring would rule Stewart out for the rest of the season. Stewart returned from injury in a 2–1 away victory against Leeds United on the final day of the 2023–24 season, replacing Adam Armstrong in the 83rd minute.\nOn 14 September 2024, Stewart made his first Premier League appearance in a 3–0 home defeat against Manchester United after he replaced Cameron Archer in the 62nd minute. During his first start for the club since his permanent transfer, on 5 October 2024, Stewart suffered a muscle injury in a 3–1 defeat against Arsenal. On 25 May 2025, he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 home defeat against Arsenal.\nInternational career\nStewart received his first call-up to the senior Scotland squad in March 2022 whilst playing for Sunderland. He made his international debut on 8 June 2022, appearing as a substitute in a Nations League game against Armenia.\nCareer statistics\nClub\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|National cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|League cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Other\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Albion Rovers\n|2016–17\n|Scottish League One\n|25||12||2||0||5||0||1||0||33||12\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|St Mirren\n|2017–18\n|Scottish Championship\n|9||0||1||0||4||1||3||1||17||2\n|-\n|2018–19\n|Scottish Premiership\n|1||0||0||0||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|—||4||1\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!10!!0!!1!!0!!7!!2!!3!!1!!21!!3\n|-\n|Alloa Athletic (loan)\n|2017–18\n|Scottish League One\n|19||7||0||0||0||0||4||3||23||10\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Ross County\n|2018–19\n|Scottish Championship\n|23||6||3||2||0||0||6||3||32||11\n|-\n|2019–20\n|Scottish Premiership\n|21||7||0||0||5||4||colspan=\"2\"|—||26||11\n|-\n|2020–21\n|Scottish Premiership\n|19||2||0||0||5||4||colspan=\"2\"|—||24||6\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!63!!15!!3!!2!!10!!8!!6!!3!!82!!28\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|Sunderland\n|2020–21\n|League One\n|11||2||0||0||0||0||2||1||13||3\n|-\n|2021–22\n|League One\n|46||24||0||0||4||0||3||2||53||26\n|-\n|2022–23\n|Championship\n|13||10||2||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||15||11\n|-\n|2023–24\n|Championship\n|0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||0||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!70!!36!!2!!1!!4!!0!!5!!3!!81!!40\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|Southampton\n|2023–24\n|Championship\n|3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||1||0||4||0\n|-\n|2024–25\n|Premier League\n|12||1||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||13||1\n|-\n|2025–26\n|Championship\n|8||2||0||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|—||10||2\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!23!!3!!0!!0!!3!!0!!1!!0!!27!!3\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|Career total\n!203!!70!!8!!3!!29!!10!!20!!10!!267!!96\n|}\nInternational\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Appearances and goals by national team and year\n!National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals\n|-\n|Scotland\n|2022||2||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total!!2!!0\n|}\nHonours\nRoss County\n*Scottish Championship: 2018–19\n*Scottish Challenge Cup: 2018–19\nSunderland\n*EFL Trophy: 2020–21\n*EFL League One play-offs: 2022\nSouthampton\n*EFL Championship play-offs: 2024\nIndividual\n*PFA Fans' Player of the Year: 2021–22 League One\n*PFA Team of the Year: 2021–22 EFL League One\n*EFL League One Team of the Season: 2021–22\n*Sunderland Player of the Year: 2021–22\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n* [https://www.southamptonfc.com/en/teams/profile/ross-stewart Profile] at the Southampton F.C. website\n}}"
