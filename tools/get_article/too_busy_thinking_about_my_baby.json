The song was first recorded by The Temptations as a track on their 1966 album ''Gettin' Ready''. Eddie Kendricks sings lead on the recording, which was produced by Whitfield.

It remained unreleased until 1997.\nThree years later, Motown artist Marvin Gaye recorded a cover version of \"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\" as a follow-up single to his 1968 hit \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\", another Whitfield/Strong composition, which was a trans-atlantic top five hit. Whitfield produced Gaye's version as well, which featured background vocals by The Andantes. The song's lyrics feature the male narrator discussing how he has \"no time to discuss weather\" or \"think about what money can buy\", because when he thinks about his woman, \"I ain't got time for nothing else\".\nIn terms of chart success, \"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\" was Gaye's second biggest hit of the 1960s, after \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\". \"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\" peaked at No.4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, and remained at the No.1 position on ''Billboard's'' Black Singles Chart for six consecutive weeks, from the weeks of, June 7 until July 12, 1969, with sales close to two million records. The single was the top-selling R&B single of the year, and also reached No.14 on Billboard’s year-end charts. The tune was the first release from Gaye's 1969 studio album M.P.G.. The single also reached No.5 in the UK Singles Chart.\nCash Box described it as a \"medium paced rock effort\" with a \"solid vocal\" and \"a phenomenal production using tom-tom effectiveness to stoke up dance fan fires.\"\nPersonnel\nTemptations version\n* Lead vocals by Eddie Kendricks\n* Background vocals by David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin, Paul Williams, and Otis Williams\n* Instrumentation by the Funk Brothers\nJimmy Ruffin version\n* Lead vocals by Jimmy Ruffin\n* Background vocals by David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin, Paul Williams, and Otis Williams\n* Instrumentation by the Funk Brothers\nMarvin Gaye version\n* Lead vocals by Marvin Gaye\n* Background vocals by the Andantes: Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow and Louvain Demps\n* Instrumentation by the Funk Brothers\nChart history\nWeekly charts\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
