The award was handed out by Rex Kingsley of the Sunday Mail. As there were no Football Writers' awards (until the SFWA awards in 1965) or Players' Association awards (until the PFA Scotland awards in 1978), the Rex Kingsley Footballer of the Year award was generally considered to be the most prestigious of its type at the time.\nList of Winners\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
