In their second season under head coach Jim Garrett, the Crusaders compiled an 8–0–1 record (6–0 in conference games), won the MAC Northern College Division championship, and outscored opponents by a total of 224 to 71. The season was part of a 22-game unbeaten streak that began on October 22, 1960, and ended on September 21, 1963.\nTwo Susquehanna players received first-team honors on the 1961 MAC Southern College Division all-star team. The honorees were senior guard and team captain Ben DiFrancesco and sophomore fullback Larry Kerstetter. Di Francesco was also selected by the Associated Press as a second-team player on the 1961 All-Pennsylvania football team.\nSchedule\n|Sunbury HS field|Sunbury, PA|W 7-0||\n|September 30|at|||Collegeville, PA|W 28-6||\n|October 7||Swarthmore|University Field|Selinsgrove, PA|W 34-12|4,000|\n|October 14|at|Wagner||Staten Island, NY|W 28-24|2,500|\n|October 21||Western Maryland|University Field|Selinsgrove, PA|W 34-8|3,000|\n|October 28|at|Delaware Valley|Alumni Field|Doylestown, PA|W 30-0|2,200|\n|November 4||Oberlin|University Field|Selinsgrove, PA|T 7-7|3,000|\n|November 11|||University Field|Selinsgrove, PA|W 35-6||\n|November 18|||Selingrove HS Field|Selinsgrove, PA|W 21-8||\n}}\nStatistics\nSusquehanna tallied 2,781 yards of total offense (309 yards per game), consisting of 2,376 rushing yards (264 yards per game) and 405 passing yards (45 yards per game).
