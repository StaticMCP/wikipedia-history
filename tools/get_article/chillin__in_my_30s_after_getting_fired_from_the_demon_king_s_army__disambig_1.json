Homeless, Dariel wanders aimlessly until he meets a young woman named Marika fleeing a monster. Despite being unfamiliar with human weapons Dariel uses Marika's dagger and kills the monster. Grateful, Marika drags Dariel to her village. Hiding his demon identity Dariel only reveals he was fired recently. Marika's parents insist he stays with them and become a guild adventurer so he can protect the village from monsters. Dariel tries to protest as receiving a guild seal would expose him as not human, yet he somehow passes the test. Dariel realizes that despite being raised by demons he must actually be human. Dariel learns of Aura, a human magic that boosts weapon abilities, and despite believing himself weak he discovers his affinity for Aura, making him a master-class warrior. Marika's father Envil suggests Dariel might be better suited to a larger guild in a city, but Dariel decides to stay in the village. Marika is overjoyed but the village's only other adventurer, Gashita, is unimpressed until it is discovered the monster Dariel killed was one Gashita has failed to kill for over two weeks.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Dariel is promoted for killing the monster and accepts a quiet herb-gathering quest but is perplexed when Marika insists on joining him, holding his hand, and doing most of the quest for him. Dariel notices Marika is skilled enough to be an adventurer; Marika claims she is scared of fighting and yet hunts monsters for food without a problem. Dariel settles into village life with Marika's romantic interest in him becoming more obvious. Envil reveals Gashita recklessly decided to hunt a Blaze Deathscythe, even though it is too high rank for him, and a team from a city guild has already accepted the official quest. Dariel volunteers to retrieve Gashita but finds him already running scared of the Deathscythe. Dariel's sword is broken so he combines two Aura skills and throws a sword fragment into the Death scythe's mouth, killing it.  Gashita realizes he has been a reckless idiot. Meanwhile, the four Demon Kings struggle in their war against the Hero as Dariel is secretly the one who keeps everything in the army running smoothly; without him, everything is falling apart, yet Bashverza furiously rejects his fellow Kings' requests to bring Dariel back.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Gashita begins following Dariel on his quests to learn from him. Marika's hugs begin to cause Dariel injuries. Dariel notices most houses in the village are vacant and Envil explains the village was a trade route for a nearby mithril mine, but since the demon army captured the mine trade stopped. Dariel, once the mine's overseer for the demon army, visits the mine and finds it being totally mismanaged by one of Bashvasa's new commanders. The Knockers, a demon sub-species suited to mining who all respect Dariel greatly, are tired of being repressed and begin a revolt. Dariel hides his face and protects the Knockers as an anonymous adventurer, defeating the demon soldiers non-fatally. The commander surrenders, revealing he isn't even a soldier, just a demon Bashverza randomly hired at a party. At Dariel's insistence, the commander resigns and the soldiers return home. The grateful Knockers decide to switch allegiance to the human race. The Adventurer Guild's main headquarters takes the Knockers under their protection to reopen the mine properly, making the village prosperous again. Marika hugs Dariel so hard he is tackled to the floor unconscious.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bashverza is punished by the Demon Lord for losing the mithril mine and his continued mismanagement of the army. Marika almost asks Dariel to marry her but is interrupted by Gashita arguing with Fitbitan, the arrogant leader of the adventurer team sent to hunt the Blaze Deathscythe. Gashita reveals that Dariel killed the Deathscythe, infuriating Fitbitan. Later, a misunderstanding results in Envil accepting a confused Dariel as Marika's fiancé. Guild headquarters ask Dariel to negotiate with the Knockers as they refuse to meet anyone else, but once Dariel reassures them the Knockers happily negotiate with Guild representative Bestfred. The demon Rizet is sent by the Demon Lord to convince the Knockers to return, but he encounters Dariel instead. Rizet reveals the demon army is near collapse due to Bashverza's incompetence and begs Dariel to return. Dariel refuses due to being human and instead has Rizet negotiate with Bestfred to buy mithril from the guild, reasoning that buying mithril is easier than starting a war over the mine. A furious Fitbitan tries to murder Rizet but is stopped by Dariel. Bestfred berates Fitbitan before agreeing to sell mithril to the demons. Dariel looks forward to future peace between demons and humans since both races are precious to him.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bestfred asks Dariel to reopen the mithril foundry; however, Fitbitan has already claimed the foundry for the Campbell guild. The Central guild sends Smith, the greatest living mithril blacksmith, to work in the foundry. Smith refuses to work with Campbell guild blacksmiths due to Fitbitan's rudeness. Smith reveals he intends to forge the greatest mithril weapon of his career, customized for Dariel's unique Aura. Fitbitan tries to recruit Dariel to the Campbell guild to deny the Centre guild access to the mine, but Dariel refuses so Fitbitan challenges Dariel to a duel. Fitbitan reveals his smiths have forged a mithril sword and shield, and mocks the dagger that Smith forges for Dariel. However, Smith reveals it is the Hermes Blade, which with Dariel's Aura can become any shape, including a sword and whip. Fitbitan's inferior mithril is destroyed. Bestfred decides to arrest Fitbitan but Dariel, knowing Fitbitan was doing his best for his guild and teammates, insists Fitbitan be forgiven if he repairs the houses damaged in their duel. Bestfred offers Dariel a job at Central Guild, overheard by Marika. Later, Dariel contemplates the job offer clothed in a towel in a sauna. Marika, also dressed in a towel, joins the shocked Dariel, insisting they discuss something important.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Marika tells Dariel she will support his taking the Centre Guild job. Dariel had already decided not to go, causing Marika to cry tears of joy and they kissed. Bashverza visits his and Dariel's father, Granverza, who retired after being injured by the Hero. Bashverza is too ashamed to admit his failures so he claims Dariel is still working for him. Granverza attacks him, having known the truth already and demanding Bashverza find Dariel. Bashverza refuses and leaves to prove he can succeed without Dariel. Marika's mother sneakily confirms that Dariel and Marika spent the night together, leaving Dariel so weak he falls down the stairs. Dariel frets over whether to confess everything but before he can Envil announces he wishes Dariel to replace him as Chief. Dariel agrees and asks Marika to marry him. One year later Dariel is Chief, has married Marika, and had a son, Gran. The Hero visits the village. Dariel has mixed feelings as the Hero almost killed Granverza, but he finds the previous Hero has retired and been replaced by a young woman who is so new to the role she has notes for heroic behavior written on her hands. As it is her destiny to defeat the Demon Lord she has come to the village for mithril armor.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The Hero, Lady, and her subordinates Satome and Sessha, are entranced by the mithril weaponry. Lady announces she is seeking a third subordinate and is accepting challengers. Gashita comes close to winning but Dariel is forced to save his life when Lady almost kills Gashita by accident. Lady duels and is defeated by Dariel, but is confused when he rejects her invitation to join her party. Dariel recalls Lady Droyes, one of the Demon Kings who valued peace above everything and is determined not to help Lady defeat the Demon Lord. Lady begins stalking Dariel and slowly realizes Dariel values life over war. She begs him to join her once more but Dariel refuses, revealing the demon army only exists to protect the Demon Lord from the Hero and has never once started a war with humans as it was always the Hero who attacked first. Lady relents and asks Dariel to be her mentor. Dariel agrees, hoping to steer Lady away from war altogether. Droyes is despondent Dariel is still missing as Bashverza has not attempted to manage the army in months. Meanwhile, Rizet visits Dariel but is followed by Zebiantes, one of the four Demon Kings, who finally locates Dariel.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Zebiantes punishes Rizet and confronts Dariel but decides to behave after witnessing Marika's suppressed rage. Zebiantes decides to take over responsibility for the mithril contract from Rizet but Dariel refuses to work with her. Zebiantes challenges Dariel to a duel but loses comically fast. During the fight, Dariel accidentally snatches Zebiantes' panties and is forced to sell her a mithril weapon to not tell Marika. While Zebiantes visits the foundry to have a weapon forged Dariel is forced to distract Lady so she won't meet Zebiantes, only for the two to meet anyway at the sauna. Dariel is forced to admit everything about his past, having already done so to Marika before their wedding. Marika prevents a fight from breaking out so Zebiantes and Lady decide on a duel. After a restless night, the two meet with their mithril weapons, Lady a sword, and Zebiantes a Wind Magic necklace. The two are evenly matched until they almost collapse a cliff onto Gran and both save him. With the duel over the two realize they actually had fun together and become friends. Dariel hopes such friendships will lead to the peace he longs for between humans and demons. Later the village is visited by Alanzir, the retired previous hero.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Far from the bloodthirsty warrior Dariel remembers Alanzir appears as a kindly old man. Alanzir plans to resume Lady's training but learning Dariel has also been training Lady he asks to spar with him. Dariel unhappily agrees but Zebiantes accidentally uses demon magic, exposing herself and Alanzir tries to kill her. Dariel is forced to save Zebiantes, informing Alanzir that peaceful demons are welcome in his village. Sensing Dariel's strength Alanzir offers to have Dariel replace Lady as the Hero. Dariel refuses so Alanzir injures him, demanding to know why Dariel wants peace with demons. Dariel reveals he was raised by demons. Granverza meets the Demon Lord and begs him to fire Bashverza who has not left his room in over a year. The Demon Lord is unhappy Granverza blatantly prefers the human Dariel over Bashverza but he gives Granverza Dariel's location, having known it all along. Granverza recalls 33 years ago the former Water Demon King Bezetan was slain by Alanzir, but he left Granverza the perfect weapon to one day kill Alanzir, the baby Dariel. Alanzir abruptly reveals Dariel must be his long-lost son, kidnapped by Bezetan as a baby. Before Dariel can react to this revelation Granverza arrives.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Alanzir cannot forgive that Granverza got to be a father while he did not. Granverza never knew Dariel was Alanzir's son as Bezetan never told him. They almost fight until Marika interrupts, actually scolding a Hero and a Demon King for upsetting their grandson. Meeting Gran the two grandfathers make peace. Bashverza finally reappears, claiming to have the plan to defeat the Hero, only to find he will soon be fired and all anyone can talk about is Dariel. Bashverza decides to kill Dariel. During a party, Envil is nervous about being joint grandfathers with Alanzir the Hero and Granverza the Demon King, but Dariel feels hopeful when they start getting along. Lady asks about her training but due to their new circumstances, Alanzir admits the Demon Lord isn't the cause of humanity's suffering. The war was started by humanity's leaders to seize the Demon Lord's ability to bestow magical powers, finally allowing humans to use magic. Lady decides to remain the Hero to expose the truth. The mine is attacked by a dragon so everyone rushes to help. Dariel realizes the Knockers are trapped and rushes to free them while Granverza and Alanzir distract the dragon.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = Realising the Knockers will be in danger as long as the dragon is nearby Dariel joins the fight. After knocking the dragon from the sky it flies away. Granverza returns home with Zebiantes and confronts Bashverza, revealing Bashverza controlled the dragon with forbidden hex magic he stole from the Demon Lord's vault. Granverza is enraged as Hexes affect the user's sanity. Still trying to prove his superiority over Dariel Bashverza flies away on the dragon to kill the heroes Alanzir and Lady. In the mine, Dariel is confronted by Gigantomachia the Magical Earth Beast. He is upset his friend Salamandra the Magical Fire Beast is suffering and, seeing Dariel has a good heart, improves his Hermes Blade since the mithril was mined from his body. Marika gives Dariel armored gloves and her wedding ring to keep him safe. Bashverza announces he will end the war by killing all humans, starting with his greatest failure, Dariel. As they duel Dariel acknowledges how hard Bashverza must have worked and how unfair it was that no one was proud of him. Enraged at being pitied Bashverza begins to turn into a dragon as the hex further joins him to Salamandra.\n}}\n| ShortSummary        = The hex begins to affect Dariel, synchronizing their minds and dragging him into Bashverza's memories. Ever since Granverza brought Dariel home, Bashverza has felt like Dariel replaced him as Granverza's son. Even when it looked like he could work beside his father, Granverza retired and assigned Dariel as his aide instead. Dariel is deeply affected by Bashverza's loneliness, which only makes Bashverza angrier. Dariel draws Bashverza into his own memories, showing him his own loneliness over never fitting in as a demon and treasuring Bashverza as his younger brother. Bashverza realizes that his own stubbornness caused his pain and weeps, breaking the hex. Salamandra, free of the hex, prepares to rampage. Bashverza fuses with Salamandra's body to fly him far away at the cost of his life, but Granverza and Dariel work together to save him. Returning home victorious, Marika's hug almost kills Dariel. The Demon Lord exiles Bashverza for eternity so he visits Dariel and meets his nephew Gran. Gran speaks his first words, big brother Bashverza. Dariel commissions a family portrait, of humans, demons, and heroes together. Bashverza leaves to travel the world but promises to visit occasionally. Life in the village returns to peaceful normality.\n}}\n}}\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n*  at Shōsetsuka ni Narō\n*\n*\n*"
