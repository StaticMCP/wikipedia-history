Upon arrival, the president goes into the main chamber to the tune of the presidential fanfare, before beginning the ceremonies with a rendition of Shche ne vmerla Ukraina by a choir and band.

The performance of the Molytva za Ukrainu (Prayer for Ukraine) will then follow. The president will then receive state symbols and heraldry, including the seal, the collar and bulava of the president of Ukraine. Once this is done, the president will deliver a speech that will be given in the Ukrainian language, although on some occasions Russian has been used throughout the speech. After the speech, the swearing-in-ceremony is declared closed and the president walks to the nearby Mariinskyi Palace to take the salute as supreme commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This formal military ceremony has also been known to take place at the Office of the President on Bankova and in 2014, on Sofia Square. During the ceremony the president receives the salute of the commander, Kyiv Presidential Honor Guard Battalion who reports the following:\n:Mr/Mrs President of Ukraine, Supreme Commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Guard of Honour is formed up in your honor, Commander of the Guard of Honour, (states rank and name).\nThe president then inspects the guard before greeting them:\n:President: Glory to Ukraine!Parade formation: Glory to the Heroes!\nThe president then goes on to receive the report from the chiefs of the senior administrative institutions and the uniformed services of the military, including the minister of defence and the head of the security service, as of the most recent inauguration in 2019, the commanders state their name and rank (only if in uniform) and declares their institution's readiness to carry out their task. After this the battalion performs a marchpast to the tune of a march by its attached military band before heading inside.\nThe entire ceremony is covered on Ukrainian TV channels such as NTN, 5 Kanal, 1+1 and ICTV.\nList of inaugural ceremonies\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
