The bridge was built by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. The  bridge is a multiple span dual roadway with a steel plate structure. The roadways are  wide each and separated from each other by a concrete Jersey barrier.\nThe facility opened to the public on December 16, 1953, at ceremonies attended by Governor of Pennsylvania John S. Fine and Governor of New Jersey Alfred E. Driscoll. However, local reports indicate that limited vehicle access began on December 13 due to a snowstorm-related detour. The bridge carried US 611 (now Pennsylvania Route 611) for  in New Jersey to a connection with Route 94. I-80 was routed onto the bridge in 1959.\nThere is a pedestrian sidewalk on the south side of the New Jersey-bound section of the bridge, separated from motor vehicles with a concrete divider. The pedestrian walkway on the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge connects Pennsylvania's northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail with New Jersey's southern end. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area straddles both sides of the river near the bridge; Worthington State Forest is located along the bridge's New Jersey side.\nA six-lane toll plaza, one of which is an Express E-ZPass lane, is located on the Pennsylvania side of the bridge, serving westbound traffic only. The cash toll for automobiles is $3.00. E-ZPass users pay $1.50.\nSee also\n* List of crossings of the Delaware River\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110526223437/http://www.drjtbc.org/default.aspx?pageid=87 Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge at the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission website]\n*"
