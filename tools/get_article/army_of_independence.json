Soon after the group's founding, one of its founders, Movses Gorgisyan, was killed during a battle with Azerbaijani forces near Yeraskh.\nIn February 1990, the Army of Independence participated in the creation of a defense coordination committee that was meant to coordinate the activities of the various armed militias in Armenia.\nOn 23 March 1990, the Army of Independence cut ties with the Union for National Self-Determination and became an independent group. Several leaders of the Army of Independence joined the ranks of the Republican Party of Armenia, which was founded by Ashot Navasardyan on 2 April 1990. The Army of Independence created a new military council with Navasardyan as supreme commander and Leonid Azgaldyan as general commander. By December 1989, the group had units in Yerevan, Etchmiadzin, Artashat, Armavir, Ararat, Masis, Charentsavan, Kamo, Vardenis, Vanadzor, Ijevan, Tashir, and Nagorno-Karabakh.\nOn 27 May 1990 the Army of Independence prevented the Soviet Army from entering Yerevan at Yerevan railway station.\nThe Army of Independence was dissolved in August 1990.
