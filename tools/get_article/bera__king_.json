      "text": "# Bera (king)\n\nAccording to the Bible, Bera ( Beraʿ; possibly meaning \"gift\") was the king of the wicked city of Sodom, spoken of in Genesis 14:2, \"... that they made war with Bera king of Sodom.\"\nScholars are divided on Genesis 14. According to Frances Anderson, \"Opinions range from identifying Genesis 14 as a piece of late fiction\" to scholars who believe there may be \"some historical foundation\" behind the narrative it relates.\nIn the narrative, Bera joins four other Canaanite city kings in rebelling against Chedorlaomer, an Elamite king and his allies who rule a vast area. In the Battle of the Vale of Siddim, the combined imperial forces plunder Sodom and nearby cities, taking many people captive and also much plunder. Bera and the king of Gomorrah, Birsha, flee the battle and fall into one of Siddim's many tarpits while other survivors escape into the mountains (14:10).\nIn popular culture\nIn the Israel film Zohi Sdom, roughly based upon the Biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah, King Bera is portrayed by actor Eli Finish as the corrupt dictator of the city.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
