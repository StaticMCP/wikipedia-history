I also remember being naked as a 14-year-old, 15-year-old, 16-year-old, even at 13 years old, dude, it's — I remember being naked in a bathtub for Italian Vogue when I was not even 14 years old. I remember being given champagne, and I never knew what to do with that. How could any child know what it is to do with that? You're just trying to get through it, and there's this pervasive terror that if you don't participate, you'll be sent home.\"\nKing shared the trauma of her early modeling days living without family at 13 years old in New York: “I was terrified. I was terrified. I mean, I was a child. I think I was 13 and a half. The first time I came to New York, my mother and I came together, but when she eventually went home, I moved in with one of the editors of Harper’s Bazaar. After that, I was sort of shuffled between different people’s households, you know; basically, wherever my agent told me I should go, that’s where I was placed. I was a child, and this may sound harsh but I believe it’s true: A child at that age should not be in the fashion industry.” King made the decision to leave the modeling industry at age 18.\nIn October 2025, King revealed on Heather McDonald's podcast that she has ADHD and was diagnosed with autism in her late 20s after she discovered it was a common comorbidity.\nFilmography\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Film\n|-\n!
