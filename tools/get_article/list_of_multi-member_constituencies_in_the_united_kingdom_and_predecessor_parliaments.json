It is sub-divided into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland (including Northern Ireland from 1922).\nThis list excludes periods when a constituency only returned one member. The from date is the year from which the multi-member constituency is known to have been regularly represented. The until date is the year when the constituency was either disenfranchised or ceased to have more than one member. It covers the Parliament of England, the Protectorate Parliament, the Parliament of Scotland, the Parliament of Ireland, the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nIn some cases there were earlier periods of enfranchisement in the Parliament of England but those before the sixteenth century are excluded from this list. In the English and Welsh sub-lists the 'Prot' column only covers the first two Protectorate Parliaments (1654–1658). The English and Welsh seats in the third Protectorate Parliament (1659) used the same seats as the 'a || 1832 || 2 || 2 || - || - || - || - || Durham\n|-\n|North Durham || 1832 || 1885 || - || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Durham\n|-\n|South Durham || 1832 || 1885 || - || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Durham\n|-\n|}\nE\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Constituency!!From!!Until!!Prot!!c || - || - || - || Lancashire\n|-\n|South East Lancashire || 1868 || 1885 || - || - || - || 2 || - || - || Lancashire\n|-\n|South West Lancashire || 1868 || 1885 || - || - || - || 2 || - || - || Lancashire\n|-\n|Lancaster || 1523 || 1868 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || - || Lancashire\n|-\n|Launceston || 1295 || 1832 || - || 2 || - || - || - || - || Cornwall\n|-\n|Leeds || 1832 || 1885 || - || - || 2 || 3 || - || - || Yorkshire\n|-\n|Leicester || 1295 || 1918 || 2 || 2 || 2 || 2 || 2 || - || Leicestershire\n|-\n|Leicestershire || 1290 || 1832 || 4 || 2 || - || - || - || - || Leicestershire\n|-\n|North Leicestershire || 1832 || 1885 || - || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Leicestershire\n|-\n|South Leicestershire || 1832 || 1885 || - || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Leicestershire\n|-\n|Leominster || 1295 || 1868 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || - || Herefordshire\n|-\n|Lewes || 1295 || 1868 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || - || Sussex\n|-\n|Lichfield || 1547 || 1868 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || - || Staffordshire\n|-\n|Lincoln || 1295 || 1885 || 2 || 2 || 2 || 2 || - || - || Lincolnshire\n|-\n|Lincolnshire || 1290 || 1832 || 10 || 2 || - || - || - || - || Lincolnshire\n|-\n|Mid Lincolnshire || 1868 || 1885 || - || - || - || 2 || - || - || Lincolnshire\n|-\n|North Lincolnshire || 1832 || 1885 || - || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Lincolnshire\n|-\n|South Lincolnshire || 1832 || 1885 || - || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Lincolnshire\n|-\n|Liskeard || 1295 || 1832 || - || 2 || - || - || - || - || Cornwall\n|-\n|Liverpool || 1545 || 1885 || - || 2 || 2 || 3 || - || - || Lancashire\n|-\n|City of London || 1298 || 1950 || 6 || 4 || 4 || 4 || 2 || 2 || Middlesex\n|-\n|Lostwithiel || 1305 || 1832 || - || 2 || - || - || - || - || Cornwall\n|-\n|Ludlow || 1472 || 1868 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || - || Shropshire\n|-\n|Ludgershall || 1295 || 1832 || - || 2 || - || - || - || - || Wiltshire\n|-\n|Lyme Regis || 1295 || 1832 || - || 2 || - || - || - || - || Dorset\n|-\n|Lymington || 1584 || 1868 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || - || Hampshire\n|-\n|}\nM\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Constituency!!From!!Until!!Prot!!a || 1885 || 4 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Yorkshire\n|-\n|Northern West Riding of Yorkshire || 1865 || 1885 || - || - || (2) || 2 || - || - || Yorkshire\n|-\n|North Riding of Yorkshire || 1832 a || 1885 || 4 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Yorkshire\n|-\n|Southern West Riding of Yorkshire || 1865 || 1885 || - || - || (2) || 2 || - || - || Yorkshire\n|-\n|West Riding of Yorkshire || 1832 a || 1865 || 6 || - || (2) || - || - || - || Yorkshire\n|-\n|Yorkshire || 1290 || 1832 || - || 2+ b || - || - || - || - || Yorkshire\n|-\n|}\nNotes:-\n* a Before the constituency was regularly enfranchised, it sent members to the First and Second Protectorate Parliaments 1654–1658.\n* b In 1826 the representation of Yorkshire was increased to 4 seats.\n* c In 1861 the representation of South Lancashire was increased to 3 seats.\nMulti-member constituencies in Wales\nArticle names are followed by (UK Parliament constituency). The constituencies which existed before 1832 were all part of the Parliament of England (from the date indicated until 1707), the Parliament of Great Britain (1707–1800) and the Parliament of the United Kingdom (from 1801).\nFor the purposes of this list Monmouthshire is treated as part of Wales throughout its existence as a Parliamentary county, although before the twentieth century it was regarded as part of England.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Constituency!!From!!Until!!Prot!!a || 1885 || 2 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Carmarthenshire\n|-\n|Denbighshire || 1832 a || 1885 || 2 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Denbighshire\n|-\n|Flintshire || 1654 || 1658 || 2 || - || - || - || - || - || Flintshire\n|-\n|Glamorganshire || 1832 a || 1885 || 2 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Glamorganshire\n|-\n|Merthyr Tydfil || 1868 || 1918 || - || - || - || 2 || 2 || - || Glamorganshire\n|-\n|Monmouthshire || 1542 || 1885 || 3 || 2 || 2 || 2 || - || - || Monmouthshire\n|-\n|Montgomeryshire || 1654 || 1658 || 2 || - || - || - || - || - || Montgomeryshire\n|-\n|Pembrokeshire || 1654 || 1658 || 2 || - || - || - || - || - || Pembrokeshire\n|-\n|Radnorshire || 1654 || 1658 || 2 || - || - || - || - || - || Radnorshire\n|-\n|}\nNote:-\n* a Enfranchised with one seat in 1542, but given two seats in the First and Second Protectorate Parliaments (1654–1658), before being allocated two seats again in 1832.\nMulti-member constituencies in Scotland\nConstituency names until 1707 are followed by (Parliament of Scotland constituency). Those from 1708 are followed by (UK Parliament constituency). The constituencies which existed before the Union in 1707 were all part of the Parliament of Scotland (from a currently unestablished date until 1707). Apart from the members co-opted to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain, who are treated in this list as representing Scotland as an undivided whole, there were no Scottish multi-member constituencies from 1707 until the boundary changes for the Parliament of the United Kingdom seats in 1832.\nSee the list of constituencies in the Parliament of Scotland at the time of the Union for more details, including a discussion of the possible inaccuracy of the constituency and shire names in the list.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Constituency!!From!!Until!!Prot!!a || 1885 || 2 || 2 || 2 || - || 2 || 2 || - || - || Edinburghshire/Midlothian\n|-\n|Edinburghshire || b || 1707 || 1708 || - || - || - || 45 || - || - || - || - || undivided country\n|-\n|Selkirkshire || a Edinburgh was allocated two seats in the Protectorate Parliaments (1654–1659).
