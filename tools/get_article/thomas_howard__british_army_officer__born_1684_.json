George Howard was a younger son of Sir Charles Howard of Eastwick and a great-great-grandson of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham through his second son Sir William Howard of Lingfield; George's elder brother Francis had succeeded as fifth Baron Howard of Effingham in 1681. Thomas Howard was baptised at Great Bookham on 13 August 1684. His father died on 13 December the same year and his mother on 16 September 1704; Howard would raise a memorial to his parents and their children Henry, Frances and Mary in Great Bookham Church on 26 November 1744.\nMilitary career\nHoward joined the Army as an ensign on 4 February 1703. During the War of the Spanish Succession he served in the Netherlands and Germany under the Duke of Marlborough, and in 1707 was present as a captain in Wade's Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Almanza, where he was taken prisoner. He was a prisoner of war in France for two years, but was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the 24th Regiment of Foot in 1708 and served at the Battle of Brihuega in 1710, where he was again captured. On 15 November 1711 he was granted brevet rank as a colonel of Foot. Howard was dismissed for his political opinions, but was reinstated by King George I, and in 1717 he purchased the colonelcy of the 24th Regiment of Foot, succeeding General Primrose.\nHoward was promoted to brigadier-general in 1735. On 27 June 1737, following the death of Lieutenant-General Tatton, he was removed from the 24th Foot to the colonelcy of the Buffs – so called to distinguish them from the Green Howards, of which his kinsman Sir Charles Howard was colonel. He was promoted to major-general in 1739, and served as aide-de-camp to King George II for several years. In 1742 Howard went to Flanders to join the Pragmatic Army commanded by Lord Stair, and was appointed to the office of Governor of Berwick.
