Built on a reclaimed dumpsite, the structure stood over 40 feet tall. It featured a prominent hand symbol at its peak, representing the \"hand of God.\" The monument was intended as a tourist attraction.\nIt was considered during the administration of former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha and was officially commissioned by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. On 30 May 2019, the monument was demolished using earth-moving equipment under the administration of Emeka Ihedioha, who succeeded Okorocha as governor that year.\nReferences"
