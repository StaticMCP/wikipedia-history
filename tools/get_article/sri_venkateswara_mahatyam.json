Pullaiah and produced by V. Venkateswarlu. It is based on the Venkateswara avatar of Vishnu at Tirumala. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Savitri, and S. Varalakshmi with music composed by Pendyala Nageswara Rao. The film was dubbed into Tamil and released as Srinivasa Kalyanam.\nPlot\nThe film begins with the advent of Kaliyuga. The earth faces threats of all sorts. To reduce it, Saptarshi, helmed by Kashyapa, performs a Yagna when Narada arrives and asks who the patron deity of the sacrifice is. Since they cannot answer, Bhrigu moves to test Trimurthi. After Siva & Brahma become the victims of his curse, he approaches Vaikuntha when Vishnu & Lakshmi are immersed in love and ignore him. So, furious, Bhrigu kicks Vishnu in the chest. To pacify the sage, Vishnu held his legs and pressed the eye in his foot to symbolize his egotism when the sage sought to apologize. With a shattered ego, Lakshmi quits when Vishnu is behind her, first step on the earth at Tirumala, and settles in an anthill without food & water. Taking pity, Brahma & Siva assumed the forms of a cow & calf to serve him. Lakshmi sold them to the King, and they fed him.\nMeanwhile, the cow does not yield milk at the palace, so the queen chastises the cow herder Sarabha. So, he follows it secretly, discovers the cause, and flung his axe. Here, Vishnu rose after receiving the blow and cursed Sarabha to be a ghost until he formed a deity at that place. After that, Vishnu landed at his ardent devotee Vakala's Ashram; she called him Srinivasa and provided hospitality. Once, Srinivasa chases a wild elephant led into a garden, where he meets Padmavati, daughter of Aakasa Raju, and the two crushes. After hesitation, Aakasa Raju and his wife, Dharani Devi, accept the proposal for its expenses, Srinivasa debts from Kubera, and say they will repay only the interest till the end of Kaliyuga. Narada briefs Lakshmi about the wedlock, and fuming, she confronts Vishnu. Then, a clash between his two consorts leads Srinivasa to become a statue. Following, Padmavathi comes to his side, and Vakula Devi as a garland.\nThe entire universe is blissful for launching a deity to protect the earth. Generations pass by, and Bhavaji, an ardent devotee, arrives and calls Balaji. However, temple authorities hinder his entrance. From there, the Lord visits him every night to spend time playing dice. One day, Balaji loses his ornament in the bet when the public spot opens doors and accuses Bhavaji of theft. The King arrives to conduct an interrogation, and Bhavaji explains the truth. Hence, the King tests his spirituality by keeping him in prison, full of sugar cane, and asks him to eat before dawn. At this point, the Lord appears as an elephant and finishes it within moments. In the morning, the people are astounded to see the miracle. Since then, he has been eminent as Hathiram Bhavaji, and the King endorses his temple authority. At last, generations pass, and the number of devotees to the temple increases. Finally, the movie ends by showing Srivari Brahmotsavam.\nCast\n*N. T. Rama Rao as Vishnu / Venkateswara\n*S.

The deification of Rama Rao began and his residence in Madras became a shrine for pilgrims, who would visit him after a trip to Tirupati. NTR fans waited in long queues outside his house for a darshan of their \"living god\". They used to apprise him of their problems back home in their villages and he listened to them patiently before rushing to the studio in the morning.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
