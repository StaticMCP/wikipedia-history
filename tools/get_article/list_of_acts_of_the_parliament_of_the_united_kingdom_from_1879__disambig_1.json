It was the sixth session of the twenty-first Parliament of the United Kingdom. Sources published during the regnal year 42 Vict refer to this session as 42 Vict, because, at that time, it was not known when the session would end.\nDuring this session the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed 78 public general acts; 41 public acts of a local character, which were placed amongst the local and personal acts; 225 local acts; and 8 private acts printed by the Queen's Printer.\nThe number shown after each act's short title or popular title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held. Most but not all of these acts have a short title. Some have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\nPublic general acts\n* Annual Turnpike Acts Continuance Act 1879 c. 46 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Appropriation Act 1879 c. 51 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Army Discipline and Regulation Act 1879 c. 33 — repealed by Reserve Forces Act 1882 (45 & 46 Vict. c. 48)\n* Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act (1868) Amendment Act 1879 c. 64 — repealed by Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890 (53 & 54 Vict. c. 70)\n* Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act 1879 c. 63 — repealed by Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890 (53 & 54 Vict. c. 70)\n* Assessed Rates Act 1879 c. 10 — repealed by Local Government Act 1966 (c. 42)\n* Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1879 c. 11\n* Bills of Sale (Ireland) Act 1879 c. 50\n* Children's Dangerous Performances Act 1879 c. 34 — repealed by Children and Young Persons Act 1932 (22 & 23 Geo. 5. c. 46) and Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1932 (22 & 23 Geo. 5. c. 47)\n* Civil Procedure Acts Repeal Act 1879 c. 59 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1958 (6 & 7 Eliz. 2. c. 46)\n* Commissioners of Woods (Thames Piers) Act 1879 c. 73 — repealed by Crown Estate Act 1961 (9 & 10 Eliz. 2. c. 55)\n* Commons Act 1879 c. 37\n* Companies Act 1879 c. 76 — repealed by Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 69)\n* Confirmation of Marriages on Her Majesty's Ships Act 1879 c. 29\n* Consolidated Fund (No. 1) Act 1879 c. 2 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Consolidated Fund (No. 2) Act 1879 c. 7 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Consolidated Fund (No. 3) Act 1879 c. 14 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Consolidated Fund (No. 4) Act 1879 c. 20 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Convention (Ireland) Act Repeal Act 1879 c. 28\n* Convention of Royal Burghs (Scotland) Act 1879 c. 27\n* Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 Amendment Act 1879 c. 40 — repealed by Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1913 (3 & 4 Geo. 5. c. 20)\n* Customs Buildings Act 1879 c. 36\n* Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1879 c. 21\n* Dispensary Houses (Ireland) Act 1879 c. 25\n* District Auditors Act 1879 c. 6 — repealed by Local Government Act 1933 (23 & 24 Geo. 5. c. 51)\n* East India Loan Act 1879 c. 60 — repealed by East India Loans Act 1937 (1 Edw. 8 & 1 Geo. 6. c. 14)\n* East Indian Loan (Annuities) Act 1879 c. 61 — repealed by Indian Loan Act 1881 (44 & 45 Vict. c. 54)\n* East Indian Railway (Redemption of Annuities) Act 1879 c. 43 — repealed by East India Loans Act 1937 (1 Edw. 8 & 1 Geo. 6. c. 14)\n* Elementary Education (Industrial Schools) Act 1879 c. 48 — repealed by Children Act 1908 (8 Edw. 7. c. 67)\n* Endowed School Acts Continuance Act 1879 c. 66 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Exchequer Bills and Bonds Act 1879 c. 62 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Exchequer Bonds (No. 1) Act 1879 c. 3 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Expiring Laws Continuance Act 1879 c. 67 — repealed by Statute Law Revision Act 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. c. 56)\n* Friendly Societies Amendment Act 1879 c. 9.
