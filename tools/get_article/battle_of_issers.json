Hayreddin Barbarossa resented Ahmed as his troops had seemingly abandoned Oruç Reis.\nHayreddin Barbarossa assumed military command of Algiers and immediately organised an expedition against Sultan Ahmed which led to a sharp conflict. The Hafsids had sent reinforcements to Ahmed. Sultan Ahmed attacked the troops of the Sultanate of Algiers from behind and inflicted heavy losses on the army of Hayreddin Barbarossa. The battle was described as bloody. Sultan Ahmed won the battle and went on to capture Algiers the following year.\nReferences"
