Leiria. He made his senior debuts with amateurs U.F.C.I. Tomar, switching after one year to Caldas Sport Clube in the third division.\nAfter stellar performances, Kingsley moved straight to the Primeira Liga in the 2003 summer, signing with S.C. Beira-Mar. He made his debut in the competition on 17 August in a 0–1 away loss against C.S. Marítimo (21 minutes played), and finished his first season with 33 games – 29 starts – and four goals, helping the Aveiro club to the 11th position.\nKingsley joined AEK Larnaca F.C. in the Cypriot First Division in January 2007, following an unassuming spell in Egypt with Zamalek SC. He scored four times in only ten appearances in his debut campaign, and also helped his team reach the semi-finals of the Cypriot Cup. In July 2008 he moved sides and countries again, signing for Ukrainian Premier League's FC Metalurh Donetsk for €620,000.\nIn July 2010, Kingsley returned to his previous club. He played the last match of his career on 29 January 2012, netting once in the 6–0 win over Nea Salamis Famagusta FC for the league championship; he retired subsequently at the age of only 30, and accepted an offer to become his last team's chief scout.\nKingsley came out of retirement in the 2014 summer after two years of inactivity, signing with Nikos & Sokratis Erimis also in Cyprus.\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*[http://www.kingsley-ekeh.com Official website]"
