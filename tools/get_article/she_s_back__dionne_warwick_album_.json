It was released by Kind Music and eOne Entertainment on May 17, 2019. Chiefly produced by her son Damon Elliott along with Teddy Harmon, initial editions of ''She's Back'' contained a remastered version of Warwick's 1998 album Dionne Sings Dionne as a bonus disc. It debuted and peaked at number 19 on the US Independent Albums.\nCritical reception\n}}\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic wrote that Warwick's son and chief producer Damon Elliott \"paints ''She's Back'' with all manners of modern flair: the rhythms are electronic, the instruments largely synthesized, and the bass is often cranked. Several vocalists are invited to help broaden Warwick's appeal, too. Her duet partners are relatively old-fashioned (Kenny Lattimore, Brian McKnight), relatively hip (Musiq Soulchild), and certainly surprising (Krayzie Bone, whose verse on \"Déjà Vu\" is disarming), and they all help nudge ''She's Back'' into the 21st century, even if the overall aesthetic remains lodged in the 20th century [...] Since the album relies so heavily on ballads and slow jams, it becomes apparent that Warwick's voice isn't as supple as it once was, a transition that is inevitable with age, but the songs and settings of ''She's Back'' cast this human deficit in an unfortunately harsh light.\"\nTrack listing\n| title1          = Am I Dreaming\n| note1           = featuring Musiq Soulchild\n| writer1         = Sam Dees\n| extra1          =\n| length1         = 5:06\n| title2          = Tears Ago\n| writer2         = Rahsaan Patterson\n| extra2          =\n| length2         = 4:55\n| title3          = What Color Is Love\n| note3           = featuring Kenny Lattimore\n| writer3         = Terry Callier\n| extra3          =\n| length3         = 4:06\n| title4          = How Do You Keep the Music Playing\n| note4           = featuring Kevon Edmonds\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          =\n| length4         = 4:18\n| title5          = Déjà Vu\n| note5           = featuring Krayzie Bone\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          =\n| length5         = 6:09\n| title6          = Forever in My Heart\n| note6           = featuring Brian McKnight\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          =\n| length6         = 3:42\n| title7          = Dream with No Love\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          =\n| length7         = 4:10\n| title8          = We're in Love\n| writer8         = Patti Austin\n| extra8          =\n| length8         = 3:26\n| title9          = You Really Started Something\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          =\n| length9         = 3:19\n| title10         = Two Ships\n| note10          = featuring Fiji\n| writer10        = Dionne Warwick\n| extra10         = |Fiji}}\n| length10        = 4:55\n| title11         = Life Is Waiting\n| writer11        = Brenda Russell\n| extra11         = }}\n| length11        = 4:01\n| title12         = If I Want To\n| writer12        =\n| extra12         =\n| length12        = 4:34\n| title13         = We Need to Go Back\n| note13          = featuring Jubilation Choir\n| writer13        = Ashford & Simpson\n| extra13         = Elliott\n| length13        = 3:17\n| title14         = What a Fool Believes\n| writer14        =\n| extra14         = }}\n| length14        = 4:02\n| title15         = What the World Needs Now\n| note15          = 2019 version; featuring Jubilation Choir\n| writer15        =\n| extra15         = Elliott\n| length15        = 4:49\n}}\n| extra1          = Steve Tyrell\n| length1         = 3:44\n| title2          = Love Begins with You\n| writer2         =\n| extra2          =\n| length2         = 4:08\n| title3          = Reach Out for Me\n| writer3         =\n| extra3          =\n| length3         = 4:14\n| title4          = High Upon This Love\n| writer4         =\n| extra4          = Giles\n| length4         = 4:22\n| title5          = I Say a Little Prayer\n| writer5         =\n| extra5          =\n| length5         = 4:24\n| title6          = (There's) Always Something There to Remind Me\n| writer6         =\n| extra6          = Elliott\n| length6         = 4:46\n| title7          = If I Want To\n| writer7         =\n| extra7          = George Duke\n| length7         = 4:30\n| title8          = Aquarela do Brasil\n| writer8         =\n| extra8          = Elliott\n| length8         = 3:53\n| title9          = I Promise You\n| writer9         =\n| extra9          = Duke\n| length9         = 5:08\n| title10         = Be My Neighbour\n| writer10        =\n| extra10         = Elliott\n| length10        = 3:14\n| title11         = All Kinds of People\n| writer11        =\n| extra11         = Shrock\n| length11        = 3:37\n| title12         = What the World Needs Now Is Love\n| writer12        =\n| extra12         = Elliott\n| length12        = 4:19\n| title13         = Do You Know the Way to San Jose\n| writer13        =\n| extra13         =\n| length13        = 3:35\n| title14         = Humbly I Pray\n| writer14        = Tim Miner\n| extra14         = Miner\n| length14        = 4:45\n}}\nNotes\n*  denotes vocals producer\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Various\n| May 17, 2019\n|\n|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n|-\n|}\nReferences"
