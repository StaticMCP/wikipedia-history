The 2024 state election gave the Liberal National Party of Queensland a majority in parliament, winning 52 of 93 seats to defeat the incumbent Labor government. Following the election, Liberal National leader David Crisafulli became the 41st Premier of Queensland and was sworn in by the governor of Queensland, Jeannette Young, on 28 October 2024. The 58th Parliament opened on 26 November 2024.\nMajor events and legislation\n2024\n* As part of David Crisafulli's election campaign, he pledged that the Liberal National's \"making Queensland safer\" laws targeting youth crime would be legislated before Christmas. Following Crisafulli's election victory, the [https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/bill.first/bill-2024-043 Making Queensland Safer Bill 2024] was introduced to Parliament on 28 November. The bill featured the new government's \"adult crime, adult time\" policy, in which youth offenders would be sentenced as adults for a list of 13 offences designated as serious crimes, such as murder, manslaughter, break-ins, and dangerous operation of a vehicle. If found guilty of murder, youth offenders would also be given a mandatory life sentence with a minimum non-parole period of 20 years. Additionally, the bill would remove the principal of detention as a last resort. The bill passed Parliament on 12 December, with only Greens MP Michael Berkman and independent Sandy Bolton voting against the bill. The new laws came into effect the following day after Governor Jeannette Young gave royal assent to the bill.\n* During the election campaign, Robbie Katter, leader of Katter's Australian Party and member for Traeger, announced his intention to introduce a private member's bill to repeal abortion laws upon the resumption of parliament. This resulted in abortion becoming a major talking point in the election, as uncertainty surrounded the possibility of a Liberal National conscience vote if such a bill was introduced. However, Liberal National leader David Crisafulli assured questioners that abortion was not a priority for his party and that there would be no changes to the law. During a sitting of parliament on 10 December, Crisafulli moved a motion to prevent any amendments to or discussion regarding the [https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/asmade/act-2018-023 Termination of Pregnancy Act 2018] for the remainder of the Parliament's term. The motion passed in the affirmative with 50 votes to 38. Leader of the Opposition Steven Miles described the motion as \"grubby\", stating that it would prevent progress and was a sign that the Premier could not control his party.\nLeadership\nSpeaker\nFollowing the opening of Parliament on 26 November 2024, Premier David Crisafulli nominated Pat Weir, the member for Condamine, for the position of Speaker.
