For acts passed up until 1707, see the list of acts of the Parliament of England and the list of acts of the Parliament of Scotland.  For acts passed from 1707 to 1800, see the list of acts of the Parliament of Great Britain.  See also the list of acts of the Parliament of Ireland.\nFor acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the list of acts of the Scottish Parliament, the list of acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the list of acts and measures of Senedd Cymru; see also the list of acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.\nThe number shown after each act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\", meaning the 67th act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign.  Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \"41 Geo. 3\" rather than \"41 Geo. III\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \"41 Geo. 3\".  Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.\nAll modern acts have a short title, e.g. \"the Local Government Act 2003\".  Some earlier acts also have a short title given to them by later acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896.\n59 Geo. 3\nThe first session of the 6th Parliament of the United Kingdom, which met from 14 January 1819 until 13 July 1819.#\nThis session was also traditionally cited as 59 G. 3.\nPublic general acts\n}}\n|  intituled \"An Act to extend an Act made in the Eighteenth Year of His late Majesty King George the Second, to explain and amend the Laws touching the Elections of the Knights of the Shire to serve in Parliament for England, respecting the Expences of Hustings and Poll Clerks, so far as regards the City of Westminster.\"|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n| or the Steamboat Act 1819|public|5|23-03-1819|archived=n|An Act to ascertain the Tonnage of Vessels propelled by Steam.}}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  for preventing Aliens from becoming naturalized, or being made or becoming Denizens, except in certain Cases.|note4= }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|  }}\n|\n|  and Fifty eighth Years of His present Majesty, for reducing the Duties payable on Horses used for the Purposes therein mentioned, to the Fifth Day of April One thousand eight hundred and twenty one;
