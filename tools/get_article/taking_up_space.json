The book includes interviews with students from UK universities about their experiences. Kwakye holds a degree in history and Ogunbiyi in human, social and political sciences. Taking Up Space was the first independent book to be published by #Merky Books, an imprint with the publishing house Penguin Random House in collaboration with grime artist Stormzy, who has a scholarship programme that funds black British students to go to Cambridge University.\nIn 2020, Sid Gentle Films acquired the television rights to the book.\nReferences"
