The organization subsequently decided to increase the number of acting awards again, with the new awards separated by genre of film instead of performer gender; beginning with the 12th Canadian Screen Awards in 2024, distinct awards will now be presented for Best Supporting Performance in a Drama Film and Best Supporting Performance in a Comedy Film.\n2020s\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#bebebe;\"\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Actor\n! style=\"width:19%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:2%;\"| Ref\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2023  12th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Chantal Thuy\n| Ru\n|\n|-\n| Laurie Babin\n| Red Rooms (Les Chambres rouges)\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Nelson Coronado\n| Richelieu\n|-\n| Martin Dubreuil\n| Kanaval\n|-\n| Frances Fisher\n| The King Tide\n|-\n| Charles-Aubey Houde\n| The Dishwasher (Le Plongeur)\n|-\n| Alexis Vincent-Wolfe\n| Slash/Back\n|-\n| Aden Young\n| The King Tide\n|-\n| rowspan=\"9\" align=\"center\"| 2024  13th Canadian Screen Awards\n|- style=\"background:#FAEB86;\"\n| Jeremy Strong\n| The Apprentice\n|\n|-\n| Lise-Yolande Awashish\n| Atikamekw Suns (Soleils Atikamekw)\n| rowspan=7|\n|-\n| Zahra Bentham\n| Village Keeper\n|-\n| Lothaire Bluteau\n| The Thawing of Ice (La fonte des glaces)\n|-\n| Micah Mensah-Jatoe\n| Village Keeper\n|-\n| Tom Mercier\n| Darkest Miriam\n|-\n| Sandra Oh\n| Can I Get a Witness?\n|-\n| Maxine Simpson\n| Village Keeper\n|}\nReferences"
