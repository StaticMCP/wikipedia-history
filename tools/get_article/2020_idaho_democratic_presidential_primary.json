The Idaho primary required that voters would be registered Democrats or unaffiliated, and awarded 25 delegates towards the 2020 Democratic National Convention, of whom 20 were pledged delegates allocated on the basis of the primary results.\nWith only former vice president Joe Biden and senator Bernie Sanders left as relevant candidates after Super Tuesday, Biden won the primary with almost 49% of the vote, one of the narrower results of the day, and picked up 12 delegates over Bernie Sanders, who achieved around 42% of the vote and 8 delegates.\nProcedure\nIdaho was one of six states (along with Democrats Abroad) that held primaries on March 10, 2020, one week after Super Tuesday. On June 30, 2018, the Idaho Democratic Party announced at its state convention that it would switch from using caucuses to a state-run primary in 2020.\nVoting took place throughout the state from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. until 8:00&nbsp;p.m. local time. In the primary, candidates had to meet a threshold of 15% at the congressional district or statewide level in order to be considered viable. The 20 pledged delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention were allocated proportionally on the basis of the primary results. Of these, between 6 and 7 were allocated to each of the state's 2 congressional districts and another 3 were allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 4 at-large delegates. The March primary as part of Stage I on the primary timetable received no bonus delegates, in order to disperse the primaries between more different date clusters and keep too many states from hoarding on a March date.\nOn April 4, 2020, county caucuses chose delegates to the state convention in Boise. The state convention on June 6, 2020, elected all 20 pledged delegates for the Democratic National Convention. The delegation also included 5 unpledged PLEO delegates: 5 members of the Democratic National Committee.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text-align:center;float:none;padding:5px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pledged nationalconvention delegates\n|-\n!
