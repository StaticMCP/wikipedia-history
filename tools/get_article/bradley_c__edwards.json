Edwards is an American  physicist who has been involved in the development of the space elevator concept.\nBiography\nEdwards received his PhD degree in Physics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1990. His thesis work was in astrophysics on the soft x-ray background. During his graduate work, he worked on x-ray micro calorimeters and several sounding rocket and Shuttle payloads.\nAfter receiving his PhD, Edwards was hired as a staff scientist  at Los Alamos National Laboratory where he was co-investigator on the ALEXIS satellite, developed superconducting tunnel junction detectors, a lunar orbiter, a Mars mission, a Europa orbiter and the world's first optical cryocooler. In 1998, Edwards began working on the space elevator concept.\nEdwards received funding from the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts to examine the idea and published two papers in 2000 and 2003. He proposed methods for deploying a space elevator and overcoming perceived obstacles such as orbital debris, anchoring, climber design, and power delivery and examined construction costs and scheduling, laying the groundwork for current discussions.\nEdwards also published two books on the subject, The Space Elevator: A Revolutionary Earth-to-Space Transportation in 2003 and Leaving the Planet by Space Elevator in 2006 which gained coverage on major news media.\nIn interviews, Edwards has estimated that price per pound of launching into low Earth orbit could be reduced to 100th the cost of Shuttle missions.\nEdwards spent eleven years working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, researching advanced space technologies. He attempted a number of ventures associated with the space elevator concept and spent six years as a senior engineer at Sea-Bird Electronics, an oceanographic company. In 2007 has started a new company to develop carbon nanotube technology.\nBooks\n*The Space Elevator: A Revolutionary Earth-to-Space Transportation System, by Bradley C. Edwards and Eric A.
