It was a fishing community in eastern Kings County.\nThe community was named by Welsh farmers, later it was thought to be named after James Brudenell, 5th Earl of Cardigan, later Duke of Montague. Situated on the Cardigan River and originally named Cardigan Bridge, the community started and grew as a result of the shipbuilding industry and lumber trade.\nToday the community's primary industry is manufacturing, followed by fishing, most notably lobster, mussels and clams.\nThe community is also home to Canada's smallest library.\nOn September 28, 2018, it was combined with six other municipalities and adjacent unincorporated areas to create the town of Three Rivers.\n}}\nAttractions\n* Canada's Smallest Library\n* Cardigan River Heritage Centre\n* Shipbuilding Museum\n* Cardigan Marina\n* Cardigan ball fields\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.gov.pe.ca/placefinder/index.php3?cgndb=BAECF&formattype=&city=Cardigan Cardigan, Prince Edward Island Government Homepage]"
