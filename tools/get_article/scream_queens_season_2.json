Fox renewed the series for a second season on January 15, 2016. It premiered on September 20, 2016, and concluded on December 20, 2016. The season consists of 10 episodes.\nEmma Roberts, Abigail Breslin, Billie Lourd, Lea Michele, Keke Palmer, Niecy Nash, Glen Powell, Oliver Hudson and Jamie Lee Curtis reprise their roles from the previous season. John Stamos, Taylor Lautner, James Earl and Kirstie Alley were added to the main cast. Unlike the first season, which took place in a sorority house, the second season takes place in a hospital.\nOn May 15, 2017, Fox announced the cancellation of the series, making this the final season of the show.\nPlot\nAfter the events at Wallace University, Dean Cathy Munsch becomes a global icon and purchases the C.U.R.E. Institute in order to reform America's health care system and to cure incurable diseases. Hester confesses her crimes, leading to the Chanels' release from prison. However, the Chanels remain hated in the nation. Cathy then casts two doctors — Dr. Cassidy Cascade and Dr. Brock Holt — to fulfill the mission of the hospital, and installs Zayday Williams and the Chanels as medical students. Meanwhile, flashbacks to 1985 show the hospital's dark past, as a new serial killer surfaces: the Green Meanie.\nCast and characters\nMain\n* Emma Roberts as Chanel Oberlin\n* Kirstie Alley as Nurse Ingrid M.

Denise takes Munsch and the Chanels to the maximum-security institution where Hester is incarcerated, where they learn that Hester knows the details of the Green Meanie and the hospital's past.
