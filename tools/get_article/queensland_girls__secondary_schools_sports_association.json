Competition is offered to, and organised for, girls from Years 7 to 12.\nHistory\nThe Sports Association of Secondary Schools of Queensland, was formed in 1908, with three members: Brisbane Girls Grammar School, The Brisbane High School for Girls (now Somerville House) and Eton High School (now St Margaret's Anglican Girls School). There is some evidence to suggest that Moreton Bay College may also have participated in sporting competitions in the early years. The association had been initiated by Constance Elizabeth Harker, co-Principal of Somerville House, and its aim was to \"promote a friendly spirit between schools and at the same time deepen and strengthen the loyalty of individual girls to their own school\".\nIpswich Girls' Grammar School and St Hilda's School joined the Association in 1911, followed by Brisbane State High School in 1921, St Aidan's Anglican Girls' School in 1939, Clayfield College in 1941, Moreton Bay College in 1945, and St Peters Lutheran College in 1946. Several other schools have also been members of the QGSSSA at some time, &ndash; Girton College Toowoomba, Commercial State High School, University High School, Wynnum High School and Technical College.\nSchools\nCurrent Members\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School\n!Location\n!Enrolment\n!Founded\n!Denomination\n!Day/Boarding\n!Year EnteredCompetition\n!School Colors\n|-\n|Brisbane Girls Grammar School\n|Spring Hill\n|~1,150\n|1875\n|Non-Denominational\n|Day\n|1908\n|Royal blue\n|-\n|Brisbane State High School\n|South Brisbane\n|~3,150\n|1921\n|Secular\n|Day\n|1921\n|Cerise and navy blue\n|-\n|Clayfield College\n|Clayfield\n|~945\n|1931\n|Uniting Church\n|Day & Boarding\n|1941\n|Green, gold and blue\n|-\n|Ipswich Girls' Grammar School\n|Ipswich\n|~860\n|1892\n|Non-Denominational\n|Day & Boarding\n|1911\n|Navy blue, pale blue, and white\n|-\n|Moreton Bay College\n|Manly West\n|~1,137\n|1901\n|Uniting Church\n|Day\n|1945\n|Maroon and gold, with pink often used to represent sporting teams\n|-\n|St Aidan's Anglican Girls' School\n|Corinda\n|~857\n|1929\n|Anglican\n|Day\n|1939\n|Blue, white and brown\n|-\n|St Hilda's School\n|Southport\n|~1,188\n|1912\n|Anglican\n|Day & Boarding\n|1911\n|Red, yellow and blue\n|-\n|St Margaret's Anglican Girls School\n|Ascot\n|~900\n|1895\n|Anglican\n|Day & Boarding\n|1908\n|Navy, white and brown\n|-\n|Somerville House\n|South Brisbane\n|~1,200\n|1899\n|Uniting Church\n|Day & Boarding\n|1908\n|Blue and green\n|}\nHead of the Schoolgirls Regatta\nSwimming\nReferences\nSee also\n*List of schools in Queensland\n*Head of the River (Queensland)"
