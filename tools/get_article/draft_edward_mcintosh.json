He obtained his professional architecture degree from the Facultad de Arquitectura of the Universidad Catolica Santiago de Guayaquil.   After obtaining his undergraduate degree, Edward won a [https://fulbright.org.ec/ Fulbright Scholarship]  to continue his postgraduate studies at Columbia University's GSAPP.  Edward has worked in several prominent projects including FIFA World Cup Stadia,  Large scale mixed-use developments and as the designer of The Mukaab and New Murabba developments in Saudi Arabia\nEarly Life and Education\nEdward started his training as an architect at the Facultad de Arquitectura of the Universidad Catolica Santiago de Guayaquil. After working for several local firms and creating his own practice, he continued his postgraduate studies at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning & Preservation under a Fulbright Scholarship where he studied under Sir Peter Cook, [https://www.mr-studio.com/ Mark Rakatansky],  Kenneth Frampton, [https://phd.aaschool.ac.uk/faculty/pier-vittorio-aureli/ Pier Vittorio Aureli], [https://cooper.edu/architecture/people/joan-ockman Joan Ockman], Reinhold Martin & Hernan Diaz Alonso  graduating with [https://www.arch.columbia.edu/kinne awards] and honors.  During his postgraduate studies, Edward focused on the threshold realm between the real world and the virtual world, culminating in his 2007 project under Sir Peter Cook titled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTby9oxPkrk Capitalistic Symbiosis] having renowned avant-garde speculative architect Lebbeus Woods as part of his jury.  His research in this field influenced his award-winning proposals \"Capitalistic Symbiosis\" and \"Zero Restrain Mobility\" which won First Place in the [https://www.evolo.us/capitalistic-symbiosis-new-housing/ Evolo 2007 Housing Competition] and a special mention in the [https://www.evolo.us/zero-restrain-mobility/ Evolo 2007 Skyscraper Competition] .   His interest in bringing the virtual world into the real world was further explored in experimental projects such as \"[https://www.dezeen.com/2009/05/26/autonomous-living-unit-by-eduardo-mcintosh/ Autonomous Living Units]\", a version of which was inserted into the virtual world platform of Second Life and exhibited at [https://www.fashions-addict.com/Le-Design-a-trouve-sa-Biennale-a-Saint-Etienne_373___5766.html 2010 Saint Etienne Art Biennale.]\nThese decades-long interest in  merging of the virtual and physical worlds through architectural devices aided him to create the competition-winning entry for The Mukaab project in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2022.  The Mukaab will not only serve as a bridge between the physical word and the virtual world,  but it will also become  the largest architectural manifestation of the Najdi architectural style\nCareer\nEarly Years\nEarly in his career, during his time in Ecuador,  Edward researched and developed bamboo-based construction methodologies which culminated in [http://www.larevista.ec/actualidad/vivienda-y-decoracion/conciencia-ambiental ecologically-focused] hospitality projects like [https://hosteria-la-meson-del-quijote.ruta-del-sol-mejor-hoteles.com/es/ La Meson del Quijote] in Ayampe, Ecuador\nSports and Event Architecture\nIn Ecuador, he started his career-long involvement designing large scale sport, event and entertainment venues working for ecuadorian architect Jose Vicente Viteri.  His expertise in venues of this kind further expanded while working for internationally renowned sports architects Populous.  During his tenure at Populous, Edward was part of the design teams that created Parc Olympique Lyonnais,  Fisht Olympic Stadium, plus several sports masterplans and entertainment arena proposals\nDuring his time at Populous, while based out of the UK, Edward remained connected to academia holding teaching positions as studio lead at Birmingham City University School of Architecture and Digital Techniques invited tutor at the Architectural Association\nChief Architect in China\nAfter his tenure at Populous,  Edward worked as Chief Architect for Chinese multidisciplinary office [http://www.js-design.cn/ JSD] based out of Guangzhou,  focusing on large-scale entertainment,  residential,  commercial, retail and hospitality projects. Notable proposals created by him during his tenure at JSD include the Lai Xi Stadium Complex, MBA Campus at Wuhan University, Yingde commercial city CBD, Foshan Furniture Mall, Hubei State Library and Enping Aviation Museum\nMiddle East & South East Asia\nUpon his return to the UK,  he joined Grimshaw Architects focusing on sports and recreation projects in the Middle East and later relocating to Kuala Lumpur to work at Grimshaw's South East Asia office, where Grimshaw acted as precinct architects for the Tun Razak Exchangeproject,  Malaysia's next generation CBD.  Grimshaw worked on several aspects of the overall development with special focus on contributing to the design of The Exchange, TRX's lifestyle mall\nAlbeit small in the context of Grimshaw's remit, one of the most interesting, design-focused elements of design Edward developed was [https://trx.my/city/trx-public-realm-designing-community-sustainability-and-multifunctionality-one Singgah Sana Plaza], an intervention that straddles between \"space\" and \"building\" and has become one of the most vibrant public zones of Tun Razak Exchange serving as a magnetic gathering point,  multi-directional connector and cultural hub\nDuring this period McIntosh lectured in several institutions in South East Asia including the National University of Singapore and the University of the Philippines\nRegional Design Director and Gigaprojects\nIn 2019, Edward moved to the Middle East to become AtkinsRéalis Regional Design Director for Architecture in the MENA region   During his time at AtkinsRéalis, Edward has been leading design teams involved in projects such as Marsa Al Arab (based on a concept developed by Killa Design), The Iris Icon,  Diriyah Gate,  Qiddiya, The Royal Diriyah Equestrian and Polo Club, New Murabba  and The Mukaab.  Alongside providing design leadership and client management,  Edward's primary focus has been to develop and mentor AtkinsRealis architecture team and to actively engage in the Middle East's academic and professional discussions regarding architecture and the built environment\nMcIntosh's design approach in the GCC region focuses on finding a balance between global design-best practice and the particularities of the regional context.   His interest is to develop a legible identity representative of the historical trajectory of the GCC nations, their current standing in the world and the projection of their population's ambitions into the future.  Most of his latest investigations are focused on learning from Video-Game development methodologies in order to comprehend the behavioral traits that make certain virtual constructs appealing to humans and through this find comparable parameters which could enhance human-occupied environments in the real world\nImplementation of practical design principles and development methodologies to ensure the delivery quality and adherence to the project's Vision is another topic high on McIntosh's agenda\nAI Experimentation\nSince early 2022,  Edward has been a prolific explorer in the field of AI enabled design having been part of exhibitions such as [https://adc102.oneclub.org/project/edward-mcintosh ADC's One Club for Creativity]  and investigating the use of AI generated imagery as a tool for [https://www.designboom.com/architecture/midjourney-hybridizes-urban-skyscrapers-sustainable-bamboo-structural-frames-edward-mcintosh-01-26-2023/ lateral thinking within architectural design] to create hybrids such as high-tech architecture blended with bamboo architecture details\nConceptual Architecture and personal research\nSince his childhood Edward was intrigued by the the human experience within the built environment.  This interest has manifested in different streams of exploration such as typologies that mix High-Tech skyscrapers with bamboo architecture,  imagining skyscrapers with alternative vertical circulation systems to replace standard elevator shafts, dwellings as extensions of the human body which would serve as interface between the real world and the virtual world, and envisioning viable living communities in the open ocean (seasteading)\nConcrete-Steel-Bamboo hybrids\nBased on his earlier work constructing bamboo structures, Edward participated in the Spiretec international competition to design a mixed-use skyscraper in Noida, India alongside Dr. Kostas Grigoriadis.  His competition-winning scheme proposed a concrete and still super-structure which resembled large scale \"structural shelves\" within which 6-storey buildings could be slotted-in creating a hybrid structure, and bringing the extra-large scale of a skyscraper down to a neighborhood-like human scale\nZero-Restrain Mobility\nDuring his studies of the history behind the skyscraper typology, McIntosh realized that since its inception, the skyscraper typology has been linked to the advancement of the elevator technology.  The majority of high-rise buildings are constrained by a vertical core that houses services and vertical transportation.  In his entry for 2007's Evolo Skyscraper competition,  Edward explored the idea of an external means of vertical transportation that would \"climb\" the building carrying occupants with large scale robotic appendages.  By freeing the high-rise typology from the constrains of the vertical elevator core,  the tower itself could adopt new formal expressions.  In this particular experiment,  the proposed tower followed a lattice-like morphology that allowed for deeper penetration of natural light and a structural solution resembling a spaceframe system\nCapitalistic Symbiosis\nin 2007, During his years at graduate school in New York city,  Edward started his deep interested in William Gibson's writings (Sprawl, Bridge, Blue Ant & Jackpot trilogies) and was greatly influenced by Mamoru Oshii's 1995 Anime, Ghost in the Shell and Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation. These interests,  merged by living in New York within the financial exuberance which preceded the 2008 financial crisis served as a petri dish for McIntosh to envision a narrative-based project which he dubbed \"Capitalistic Symbiosis\".  Capitalistic Symbiosis imagine the most intimate manifestation of architecture as being a second skin or cocoon within which individuals would live, immersed in a virtual reality construct that served as mediator between the real world and a curated fictional world in exchange for the computing power of their brains which would be used by technology giants for cheap data processing.  The raise of VR,  Social Media, Fake News and AI deep fakes  in the 15 years after McIntosh's original vision was conceived,  has given this project a somewhat prophetic aura\nSeasteading\nAs an offshoot to his interest in the human-experience within architectural constructs (both in the real world and in the virtual), McIntosh started investigating the features that would make extremely unnatural environments appealing for long-term human inhabitation.  During the early 2010's,  within the graduate Design Studio he led at Birmingham City University's school of architecture, McIntosh's Studio created proposal's for the inhabitation of such environments most notably the Maunsell Forts in the Thames estuary.  This explorations motivated him to get involved with the seasteading community through Joe Quirk, contributing to one of Quirk's books with designs that imagined different approaches to conventional seasteads.  McIntosh's hypothesis regarding seasteads poses that they need to embody and incorporate features of the everyday, recognizable quotidian to avoid long-term residents to feel alienated or imprisoned.  Thus,  the proposal's he created focused on the lived-in \"patina\" and layers of human experience successful communities tend to have.   Born out of this thinking he developed his thoughts around \"Feel Crafting\"\nSport & Entertainment venues\nAfter his stints at Viteri Arquitectos in Ecuador and Populous in the UK,  Edward has remained interested in the evolution of sports, performance and entertainment venues.  Developing concepts focused on a more intensively used venue (incorporating mixed-use elements into the main program),  merging venues with the surrounding urban fabric (by breaking down the mass and thinking creatively about control points and security) and exploring how VR,  social media and digital technologies can augment the reach of the experience which so far has been limited to the physical domain of the built venue.  One notable example was the development of the idea of the \"virtual tier\" while working for Populous on the Santiago Bernabeu design competition.  While working on the design competition,  it became obvious that any physical venue would have a capacity limitation due to distance to the match, viewing angles and spectator comfort and safety. With this in mind, McIntosh started to think about a solution to allow  world-famous sports teams like Real Madrid with a fan base in the hundreds of millions located all around the globe, to be able to make those fans part of the experience in their physical venue.  Drawing from his previous experimentations with architectural devices that inhabited the threshold between the real-world and the virtual-world, McIntosh proposed a 360 LED ring floating above the Bernabeu's seating bowl which would broadcast live-feeds from Real Madrid franchised sports bars from around the world during matches where in turn, fans would compete through gamified experiences to be featured in this virtual tier.  In this manner both physical venue and remote, satellite venues could be linked in a blurred virtual-real realm.  This device aimed at not only expanding the capacity of the physical venue beyond the realms of the conventional stadium, but also at creating a totally new monetization model with global reach\nin 2017 Edward (alongside Ecuadorian architect Gabriel Hidalgo) created a stadium proposal named Boedo 365 for San Lorenzo de Almagro Football club in the Boedo neighborhood of Buenos Aires. This proposal looked at the stadium typology like a neighborhood rather than a standalone venue in order to elevate the revenue generating potential of the real-estate proposition,  as well as regenerating the club's historical neighborhood\nAwards and Honors\n* Design Middle East, Powerlist Top 30 Influential Architects 2025\n* Design Middle East, Powerlist Top 30 Influential Architects 2024\n* Design Middle East, Powerlist Top 30 Creative Architects 2023\n* Excellence in Design Award, Columbia University GSAPP, New York\n* Kinne Traveling Fellowship Award, Columbia University GSAPP, New York\n* Fulbright Scholarship, 2006\n* Academic Excellence Scholarship, UCSG\nNotable Architecture and Design Competitions\n* The Mukaab & New Murabba, international Architecture Competition. 1st Prize/ Design Contract\n* Royal Diriyah Equestrian and Polo Club, International Architecture Competition.  1st Prize/ Design Contract\n* Super SkyScrapers International Design Competition 2013, Mention\n* Spiretec Design Competition 2011, 1sr Prize.
