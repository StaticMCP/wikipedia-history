In 1910, the museum moved to the Cerdán building. In the 1950s, the museum moved again to its current premises, also known as Casa de la Cultura. The Spanish State transferred the museum's management to the Murcia's regional administration in 1984, while retaining its ownership.\nFile:Leon de coy3.jpg|Lion of Coy (2nd half of the 1st millennium BC)\nFile:Capitel paturro.JPG|Ionic capital found in the Roman vila of Huerta del Paturro (Portmán, La Unión)\nFile:Satiro-portman.JPG|Satyr's head from Huerta del Paturro, Portmán.\nReferences\n;Citations\n;Bibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
