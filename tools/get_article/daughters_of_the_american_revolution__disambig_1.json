A non-profit and non-political group, the organization promotes historical preservation, education and patriotism. Its membership is limited to direct lineal descendants of soldiers or others of the American Revolution era who aided the revolution and its subsequent war. Applicants must be at least 18 years of age. DAR has over 190,000 current members in the United States and other countries. The organization's motto was originally \"Home and Country\" until the twentieth century, when it was changed to \"God, Home, and Country\".\nHistory\nIn 1889, the centennial of President George Washington's inauguration was celebrated, and Americans looked for additional ways to recognize their past. Out of the renewed interest in United States history, numerous patriotic and preservation societies were founded. On July 13, 1890, after the Sons of the American Revolution refused to allow women to join their group, Mary Smith Lockwood published the story of patriot Hannah White Arnett in The Washington Post, asking, \"Where will the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution place Hannah Arnett?\" On July 21 of that year, William O. McDowell, a great-grandson of Hannah White Arnett, published an article in The Washington Post offering to help form a society to be known as the Daughters of the American Revolution. The first meeting of the society was held August 9, 1890.\n'' sculpture honoring DAR's four founders]]\nThe first DAR chapter was organized on October 11, 1890, at the Strathmore Arms (810 12th Street NW), the home of Mary Smith Lockwood, one of the DAR's four co-founders. Other founders were Eugenia Washington, a great-grandniece of George Washington, Ellen Hardin Walworth, and Mary Desha. They had also held organizational meetings in August 1890. Other attendees in October were Sons of the American Revolution members Registrar General Dr. George Brown Goode, Secretary General A. Howard Clark, William O. McDowell (SAR member #1), Wilson L. Gill (secretary at the inaugural meeting), and 18 other people.\nThe U.S. First Lady Caroline Lavina Scott Harrison, wife of President Benjamin Harrison, lent her prestige to the founding of DAR, and served as its first President General. Having initiated a renovation of the White House, she was interested in historic preservation. She helped establish the goals of DAR, which was incorporated by congressional charter in 1896.\nspeaks at the NSDAR Convention in 1908.]]\nOn March 3, 1913, the Woman Suffrage Procession concluded with a rally at Memorial Continental Hall, the society's national headquarters, as many members of DAR were active in the women's suffrage movement.\nStructure\nDAR is structured into three Society levels: National Society, State Society, and Chapter.  A State Society may be formed in any US State, the District of Columbia, or other countries that are home to at least one DAR Chapter. Chapters can be organized by a minimum of 12 members, or prospective members, who live in the same city or town.\nEach Society or Chapter is overseen by an executive board composed of a variety of officers.  National level officers are: President General, First Vice President General, Chaplain General, Recording Secretary General, Corresponding Secretary General, Organizing Secretary General, Treasurer General, Registrar General, Historian General, Librarian General, Curator General, and Reporter General, to be designated as Executive Officers, and twenty-one Vice Presidents General.  These officers are mirrored at the State and Chapter level, with a few changes: instead of a President General, States and Chapters have Regents, the twenty-one Vice Presidents General become one Second Vice Regent position, and the title of \"General\" is replaced by the title of either \"State\" or \"Chapter\". Example: First Vice President General becomes State First Vice Regent.\nHistoric programs\nhonoring Allentown patriots from the American Revolution who are buried in the cemetery]]\nThe DAR chapters raised funds to initiate a number of historic preservation and patriotic endeavors. They began a practice of installing markers at the graves of Revolutionary War veterans to indicate their service, and adding small flags at their gravesites on Memorial Day.\nOther activities included commissioning and installing monuments to battles and other sites related to the War. The DAR recognized women patriots' contributions as well as those of soldiers. For instance, they installed a monument at the site of a spring where Polly Hawkins Craig and other women got water to use against flaming arrows, in the defense of Bryan Station (present-day Lexington, Kentucky).\nIn addition to installing markers and monuments, DAR chapters have purchased, preserved, and operated historic houses and other sites associated with the war.\nDAR Hospital Corps (Spanish–American War, 1898)\nIn the 19th century, the U.S. military did not have an affiliated group of nurses to treat servicemembers during wartime. At the onset of the Spanish–American War in 1898, the U.S. Army appointed Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee as Acting Assistant Surgeon to select educated and experienced nurses to work for the Army. As Vice President of the DAR (who also served as NSDAR's first Librarian General), Dr. McGee founded the DAR Hospital Corps to vet applicants for nursing positions. The DAR Hospital Corps certified 1,081 nurses for service during the Spanish–American War. DAR later funded pensions for many of these nurses who did not qualify for government pensions.\nSome of DAR-certified nurses were trained by the American Red Cross, and many others came from religious orders such as the Sisters of Charity, Sisters of Mercy, and Sisters of the Holy Cross. These nurses served the U.S. Army in the U.S., Cuba, and the Philippines during the war. They paved the way for the eventual establishment—with Dr. McGee's assistance—of the Army Nurse Corps in 1901.\nTextbook committees\nDuring the 1950s, statewide chapters of the DAR took an interest in reviewing school textbooks for their own standards of suitability. In Texas, the statewide \"Committee on Investigations of Textbooks\" issued a report in 1955 identifying 59 textbooks currently in Texas public schools that had \"socialistic slant\" or \"other deficiencies\" including references to \"Soviet Russia\" in the Encyclopedia Britannica.\nIn 1959, the Mississippi chapter's \"National Defense Committee\" undertook a state lobbying effort that secured an amendment to state law which added \"lay\" members to the committee reviewing school textbooks. A DAR board member was appointed to one of the seats.\nContemporary DAR\nThere are nearly 180,000 current members of the DAR in approximately 3,000 chapters across the United States and in several other countries. The organization describes itself as \"one of the most inclusive genealogical societies\" in the United States, noting on its website that, \"any woman 18 years or older—regardless of race, religion, or ethnic background—who can prove lineal descent from a patriot of the American Revolution, is eligible for membership\". The current DAR President General is Ginnie Sebastian Storage, a medical practice administrator from Virginia.\nEligibility\nMembership in the DAR today is open to all women, regardless of race or religion, who can prove lineal bloodline descent from an ancestor who aided in achieving United States independence. The National Society DAR is the final arbiter of the acceptability of the documentation of all applications for membership.\nQualifying participants in achieving independence include the following:\n* Signatories of the United States Declaration of Independence;\n* Military veterans of the American Revolutionary War, including State navies and militias, local militias, privateers, and French or Spanish soldiers and sailors who fought in the American theater of war to include the Island of Cuba;\n* Civil servants of provisional or State governments, Continental Congress and State conventions and assemblies;\n* Signers of Oath of Allegiance or Oath of Fidelity and Support;\n* Participants in the Boston Tea Party or Edenton Tea Party;\n* Prisoners of war, refugees, and defenders of fortresses and frontiers; doctors and nurses who aided Revolutionary casualties; ministers; petitioners; and\n* Others who gave material or patriotic support to the Revolutionary cause.\nDAR published a book, available online, with the names of thousands of minority patriots, to enable family and historical research. Its online Genealogical Research System (GRS) provides access to a database, and it is digitizing family Bibles to collect more information for research.\nThe organization has chapters in all 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.. DAR chapters outside the U.S. have been founded in Australia, Austria, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom. DAR is a governing organization within the Hereditary Society Community of the United States of America, and each DAR President General has served on HSC's board since its inception.\nEducational programs\nDAR says that they contribute over $1 million annually to support five schools that provide for a variety of special student needs. The five supported schools are:\n*Berry College in Mount Berry, Georgia\n*Crossnore School in Crossnore, North Carolina\n*Kate Duncan Smith DAR School in Grant, Alabama\n*Hillside School in Marlborough, Massachusetts\n*Hindman Settlement School in Hindman, Kentucky\nScholarships and funds are given to Native American youth at Chemawa Indian School in Salem, Oregon and Bacone College in Muskogee, Oklahoma.\nCivic work\n]]\nDAR members participate in a variety of veteran and citizenship-oriented projects, including:\n* Providing more than 200,000 hours of volunteer time annually to veterans in U.S. Veterans Administration hospitals and non-VA facilities\n* Offering support to America's service personnel in current conflicts abroad through care packages, phone cards and other needed items\n* Sponsoring special programs promoting the Constitution during its official celebration week of September 17–23\n* Participating in naturalization ceremonies\nExhibits and library at DAR headquarters\nDAR maintains a genealogical library at its headquarters in Washington, D.C., which provides guides for individuals doing family research. Its bookstore presents scholarship on United States and women's history.\nTemporary exhibits in the galleries have featured women's arts and crafts, including items from the DAR's quilt and embroidery collections. Exhibit curators provide a social and historical context for girls' and women's arts in such exhibits, for instance, explaining practices of mourning reflected in certain kinds of embroidery samplers, as well as ideals expressed about the new republic. Permanent exhibits include American furniture, silver, and furnishings.\nLiteracy promotion\nIn 1989, the DAR established the NSDAR Literacy Promotion Committee, which coordinates the efforts of DAR volunteers to promote child and adult literacy. Volunteers teach English, tutor reading, prepare students for GED examinations, raise funds for literacy programs, and participate in many other ways.\nAmerican history essay contest\nDAR holds an annual national American history essay contest for students in 5th through 8th grades. A different topic is selected each year. Essays are judged \"for historical accuracy, adherence to topic, organization of materials, interest, originality, spelling, grammar, punctuation, and neatness.\" The contest is conducted locally by DAR chapters. Chapter winners compete against each other by region and nationally; national winners receive a monetary award.\nScholarships\nDAR awards $150,000 annually in scholarships to high school graduates, and music, law, nursing, and medical school students. Only two of the 20 scholarships offered are restricted to DAR members or their descendants.\nDebutante balls\nCertain chapters of the DAR partner with the Sons of the American Revolution to host debutante balls where daughters of members are presented to society as debutantes and sons of members are presented as \"patriots\". Members of the Children of the American Revolution may also be presented. The Pennsylvania State Society of the DAR hosts the annual Constitution Debutante Ball in Valley Forge. In Lafayette, Louisiana, the Galvez Chapter of the DAR hosts the annual George Washington Ball, commemorating the birthday of George Washington. Young women in the Children of the American Revolution who are either eighteen years of age or a senior in high school may be presented as debutantes at the Virginia DAR State Conference in Richmond. Debutantes are also presented at the Georgia DAR State Conference.\nDiversity and inclusion\nAfrican Americans and DAR\nOn December 3, 1896, Eunice Russ Ames Davis, a multiracial abolitionist and founding member of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, joined the Old South Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Boston, Massachusetts. She was of African, Narragansett Indian, Penobscot, and European ancestry and the daughter of American revolutionary Prince Ames. She was presented with a gold spoon by the DAR, as a \"Real Daughter of the Revolution\", on her 97th birthday.\nIn 1932, DAR adopted a rule excluding African American musicians from performing at DAR Constitution Hall in response to complaints by some members against \"mixed seating\", as both black and white people were attracted to concerts of black artists. This was during the time when Washington, D.C. was a racially segregated city. In 1939, they denied permission for Marian Anderson to perform a concert at the hall. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, a DAR member, resigned from the organization in protest.\n, soprano and CEO of the Marian Anderson Museum and Historical Society, performing at DAR Constitution Hall in 2023.]]\nIn her letter to the DAR, Roosevelt wrote, \"I am in complete disagreement with the attitude taken in refusing Constitution Hall to a great artist...You had an opportunity to lead in an enlightened way and it seems to me that your organization has failed.\"  African-American author Zora Neale Hurston criticized Roosevelt's refusal to condemn the Board of Education of Washington, D.C.'s simultaneous decision to exclude Anderson from singing at the segregated white Central High School.  Hurston declared \"to jump the people responsible for racial bias would be to accuse and expose the accusers themselves. The District of Columbia has no home rule; it is controlled by congressional committees, and Congress at the time was overwhelmingly Democratic. It was controlled by the very people who were screaming so loudly against the DAR. To my way of thinking, both places should have been denounced, or neither.\"\nAs the controversy grew, American media overwhelmingly backed Anderson's right to sing. The Philadelphia Tribune, an African American newspaper in Philadelphia, wrote, \"A group of tottering old ladies, who don't know the difference between patriotism and putridism, have compelled the gracious First Lady to apologize for their national rudeness.\" The Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote, \"In these days of racial intolerance so crudely expressed in the Third Reich, an action such as the D.A.R.'s ban... seems all the more deplorable.\" At Eleanor Roosevelt's behest, President Roosevelt and Walter White, then-executive secretary of the NAACP, and Anderson's manager, impresario Sol Hurok arranged an open-air concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with a dignified and stirring rendition of \"America (My Country, 'Tis of Thee)\". The event attracted a crowd of more than 75,000 in addition to a national radio audience of millions.\nIn 1952, DAR reversed its \"white performers only\" policy.\nIn 1977, Karen Batchelor Farmer (now Karen Batchelor) from Detroit, was admitted to the Ezra Parker Chapter in Royal Oak, Michigan as the first known DAR African American member. Batchelor's admission as the first known African American member of DAR sparked international interest after it was featured in a story on page one of The New York Times.\nIn 1984, Lena Lorraine Santos Ferguson, a retired school secretary, was denied membership in a Washington, D.C. chapter of the DAR because she was Black, according to a report by The Washington Post. Ferguson met the lineage requirements and could trace her ancestry to Jonah Gay, a white man who fought in Maine. Sarah M. King, the President General of the DAR, told The Washington Post that DAR's chapters have autonomy in determining members, saying \"Being black is not the only reason why some people have not been accepted into chapters. There are other reasons: divorce, spite, neighbors' dislike. I would say being black is very far down the line....There are a lot of people who are troublemakers. You wouldn't want them in there because they could cause some problems.\" After King's comments were reported in a page one story, outrage erupted, and the City Council threatened to revoke the DAR's real estate tax exemption. King quickly qualified her comments, saying that Ferguson should have been admitted, and that her application had been handled \"inappropriately\". DAR changed its bylaws to bar discrimination \"on the basis of race or creed.\" In addition, King announced a resolution to recognize \"the heroic contributions of black patriots in the American Revolution.\"\nSince the mid-1980s, the DAR has supported a project to identify African Americans, Native Americans, and individuals of mixed race who were patriots of the American Revolution, expanding their recognition beyond soldiers.\nIn 2004, Maria Williams-Cole and Arleathia Carter Williams became the first two African-American members of the DAR in Prince George's County, Maryland.\nIn 2008, DAR published Forgotten Patriots: African-American and American Indian Patriots in the Revolutionary War. In 2007, the DAR posthumously honored Mary Hemings Bell, an individual enslaved by Thomas Jefferson, as a \"Patriot of the Revolution\". Because of Hemings Bell's declaration by the DAR to be a Patriot, all of her female descendants qualify for membership in the DAR.\nIn 2018, Reisha Raney became the first black woman elected to serve as a DAR state officer in Maryland. She previously served on the national level of the organization as the vice chairwoman of the membership committee division. Raney founded Daughter Dialogues, a podcast documenting the narratives of black members of the DAR, which launched on July 1, 2021. In September 2018, Sonja Addison, Stephannie Addison-Mudd, and Brooke Addison Moore became the first African-American members of the Fauquier Court House Chapter of the DAR in Fauquier County, Virginia.\nIn June 2019, Wilhelmena Rhodes Kelly became the first African American elected to the DAR National Board of Management when she was installed as New York State Regent.\nIn 2022, Sheryl Sims became the first African-American woman to join the Nelly Custis Chapter of the DAR in Alexandria, Virginia. In September 2022, Sharon Fort became the first African-American woman to join the DAR in Arkansas. In December 2022, DAR donated $150,000 to the Marian Anderson Museum to help with restoration costs following flood damage to the building in 2020.\nIn October 2023, Johnette Gordon-Weaver became the first African-American member of the Williamsburg chapter of the DAR. Gordon Weaver is a descendant of Anthony Roberts, the first free African-American patriot recognized by the organization at the national level.\nIn 2024, Regina Lynch-Hudson became the first woman of color to join the Greenlee Chapter of the DAR in Old Fort, North Carolina, and the first black female descendent of Colonel John Carson to join the national society.\nTransgender women\nIn June 2023, at the 132nd DAR Continental Congress, the organization voted to add an amendment to their bylaws that states the chapters \"may not discriminate against an eligible applicant based on race, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.\" DAR spokesperson Bren Landon told Newsweek that the amendment \"provides additional non-discrimination language\" that protects the society's tax-exempt status. She also told Newsweek that \"the new language does not change the criteria for membership,\" and that \"DAR's longstanding membership policy remains unchanged since our founding in 1890.\"\nAt Continental Congress, Jennifer Mease, a delegate and Regent of the Liberty Bell Chapter in Pennsylvania, inquired whether chapters could vote against admitting a new member \"whose birth certificate has been altered by their state to indicate they are female even though they were born a male.\" President General Wright responded to Mease's inquiry by stating \"if a person's certified birth certificate states 'female,' they are eligible for membership, and your chapter cannot change that.. if their birth certificate says they are a female, and you vote against them based on their protected class, it's discrimination.\" In an official newsletter released after the congress, Wright wrote, \"some have asked if this means a transgender woman can join DAR or if this means that DAR chapters have previously welcomed transgender women. The answer to both questions is, yes.\" A retired United States Air Force colonel, who is a transgender woman, joined the Daughters of the American Revolution in New Jersey in 2022.\nNotable members\nSince its founding, many notable women have been members of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Six former First Ladies of the United States were members of the DAR: Caroline Harrison, Sarah Childress Polk, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosalynn Carter, Barbara Bush, and Laura Bush. Two Second Ladies of the United States have also been members, Letitia Stevenson and Cornelia Cole Fairbanks. Other notable public figures and federal-level politicians include U.S. Senators Tammy Duckworth, Elizabeth Dole, Rebecca Latimer Felton, and Margaret Chase Smith, U.S. Congresswomen Alice Robertson and Katherine G. Langley, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and U.S. District Court judge Ada Brown. Prominent state politicians and public officials have also been members of the DAR, including Kentucky Governor Martha Layne Collins, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, and Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Illinois state representative Sarah Bond Hanley, West Virginia state representative Mary Martha Presley Merritt, Washington state representative Gene Bradford, Iowan first lady Anna Matilda Larrabee, Kentucky Second Lady and Department of Veterans Affairs Commissioner Heather French Henry, Kentucky Treasurer and Secretary of State Emma Guy Cromwell, Illinois first lady MK Pritzker, and North Carolinian first ladies Mary McKinley Daves Ellis, Fanny Yarborough Bickett, Alice Willson Broughton, Mildred Stafford Cherry, Eleanor Kearny Carr, and Margaret Gardner Hoey. Other notable DAR members include officers in the U.S. Armed Forces, such as Brigadier General Wilma Vaught, Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, Rear Admiral Donna L. Crisp, Colonel Westray Battle Long, Command Chief Warrant Officer Phyllis J. Wilson, and Major Almyra Maynard Watson, and prominent entertainers such as the actresses Ginger Rogers, Lillian Gish, and Bo Derek and the singer Rosanne Cash.\nList of DAR presidents general\nThe presidents general of the society have been:\nFile:Caroline_Harrison.jpg|Caroline Scott Harrison, First DAR President General\nFile:Southern Woman Named DAR President General.png|Mrs. Julius Young Talmadge Named DAR President General\nFile:Dillon Silver Arrow.jpg|Silver Arrow, the symbol of the Dillon administration in the form of a pin.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

It was sculpted by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, a DAR member.\nIn popular culture\nIn 1932, American artist Grant Wood painted the satirical painting Daughters of Revolution after a local chapter of the DAR complained about his use of German glass in a commission he created for a veterans memorial.\nIn 1963, fashion photographer Richard Avedon photographed the executive officers of the Daughters of the American Revolution during their convention at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. The portrait, titled The Generals of the Daughters of the American Revolution, is now part of the collection of the National Museum of American History. A print of the image hanging at an inn in Minneapolis was shot at on November 11, 1986, becoming a popular tourist attraction. The American indie pop band The Mynabirds used the portrait as inspiration for their 2012 album Generals.\nIn the American comedy-drama television series Gilmore Girls, the character Emily Gilmore (portrayed by Kelly Bishop) is a regent of a chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Her granddaughter, Rory Gilmore (portrayed by Alexis Bledel), is presented to society at a DAR debutante ball and later joins and works for the organization. In the show's 2016 revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Emily Gilmore resigns from the DAR.\nIn the American medical drama television series ''Grey's Anatomy, the character Miranda Bailey (portrayed by Chandra Wilson) mentions in the third season episode Scars and Souvenirs that she received a DAR scholarship in her youth. In the fourth season of the American political drama television series The West Wing, in the episode Privateers, First Lady Abbey Bartlet (portrayed by Stockard Channing) is questioned on the validity of her DAR membership by another member.\nSee also\n*The Hereditary Society Community of the United States of America\n*Children of the American Revolution\n*National Society Daughters of the American Colonists\n*Colonial Dames of America\n*The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America\n*National Society Colonial Dames XVII Century\n*Old Stock Americans\n*Society of the Cincinnati\n*Sons of the American Revolution\n*Sons of the Revolution\n*Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War\n*The United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada\n*United States Daughters of 1812\nReferences\nWorks cited\n*\nFurther reading\n; Independent accounts\n*Anderson, Peggy.
