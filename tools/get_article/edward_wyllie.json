He moved to California in 1886 to work as a photographer. He also worked as a medium and spirit photographer. His spirit photographs were exposed as frauds. Negatives of pre-made spirit images were found in his house and it was also discovered that Wyllie had used a method of \"palming small spirit drawings executed in luminous paint and pressing them to the photographic plate\" which he confessed to.\nHe died in London in 1911.\nReferences"
