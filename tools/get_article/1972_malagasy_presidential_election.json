Incumbent President Philibert Tsiranana of the Social Democratic Party was the only candidate, and won the approval of 99.7% of voters. However, public unrest led to him handing over power to General Gabriel Ramanantsoa. Ramanantsoa put forward proposals for a five-year transition period during which the National Assembly would be suspended. The plans were approved in a referendum later in the year.\nResults\nReferences"
