This culture is located temporally in the interval between the fall of the Xiongnu Empire (2nd century CE) and the rise of the First Turkic Khaganate (6th century CE). In Russian archaeology, it is considered as belonging to the \"Hunno-Sarmatian period\" (2nd century BCE and 5th century CE).\nThe Kokel culture has also been named \"Syyn-Churek culture\", or \"Shurmak culture\", based on the names of the sites of various archaeological discoveries.\nCarbon dates for the Kokel sites generally range from the 2nd to the 4th centuries CE.\nKokel culture graves (2nd-4th century CE) tend to be found in conjunction with earlier graves of the Early Iron Age (9th century BCE-) Saka cultures, and the later graves of the Turkic period (5th century CE-).\nFile:Sites of the Kokel culture.jpg|Sites of the Kokel culture, just north of the frontier with Mongolia\nFile:Kokel Culture site at Tunnug 1, Tuva Republic.jpg|Kokel Culture cemetery, next to the Saka Arzhan tumulus at Tunnug 1, Tuva Republic.\nFile:Kokel culture gold artifacts from Tunnug 1.jpg|Kokel culture gold artifacts from Tunnug 1\nFile:Kokel culture arrowheads from Tunnug burials.jpg|Arrowheads found in the skeletal remains of people of the Kokel culture\nFile:Kokel culture iron and ceramic vessels.jpg|Kokel culture iron and ceramic vessels\nReferences\nSources\n*\n*"
