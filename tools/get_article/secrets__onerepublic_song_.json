It was released as the first single in Germany and Austria owing to its presence on the soundtrack of Til Schweiger's film Zweiohrküken.

The song was released in the United States iTunes Store on November 3, 2009. The song was due for a UK release on April 5, 2011 but was later canceled. It was sent to U.S. Top 40/Mainstream radio on June 1, 2010. \"Secrets\" is written in the key of D major.\nCritical reception\nJohn Hill from About.com rated it with 4.5 stars (out of 5), praising OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder for bringing nuance to the lyrics. Hill writes \"The song starts out more like a conversation, but turns into a powerful plea by the time the chorus comes around.\" Hill speculates as to the meaning of this plea but thinks it best that listeners find their own meaning.\nMusic videos\nThe music video debuted on German television on October 16, 2009.
