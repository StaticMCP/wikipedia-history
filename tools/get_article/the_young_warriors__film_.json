The novel was inspired by Matheson's own experiences as an 18-year-old infantryman with the 87th Infantry Division in Germany in World War II. The film was directed by John Peyser.\nIt was filmed cheaply by Universal on their backlot using many of its contract players, with Matheson asked to do a rewrite of his screenplay in order to use the battle sequences from Universal's To Hell and Back. When Universal wished to \"lighten\" Matheson's screenplay, they had Jonathan Daly write a comedy relief scene of chasing a duck through a minefield. The film was released as a double feature with Rosalind Russell's Rosie!\nPlot\nIn Europe, 1944, a group of replacements are assigned to Sgt Cooley's squad and sent into battle.  Initially frightened, Hacker grows to love killing but loses that feeling as well.  He is promoted to Corporal and later given his own squad as a Sergeant in the end.\nCast\n* James Drury as Sergeant Horatio Cooley\n* Steve Carlson as Hacker (Hackermeyer in the novel)\n* Jonathan Daly as Guthrie\n* Robert Pine as Foley\n* Jeff Scott as Cpl.

Zanuck was making The Longest Day) and Fred Zinnemann.  Zinnemann told Matheson that he wanted to make the film but had several other projects at the time; Matheson refused to wait and turned him down.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
