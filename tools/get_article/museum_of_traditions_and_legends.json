The museum building was once the infamous XXI prison where, from 1921 to 1979, many prisoners were tortured. Today, the prison cells depict Nicaraguan traditions and legends through puppet illustration, while wall paintings portray how tortured prisoners suffered.\nThe museum charges an admission fee. A Spanish guided tour is available.\nSee also\n* List of museums in Nicaragua\nExternal links\n* [http://www.vianica.com/sp/activity/58/museo-de-leyendas-y-tradiciones Museo de Leyendas y Tradiciones information]"
