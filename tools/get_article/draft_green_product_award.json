It is open to companies, start-ups, and designers, honoring innovations in design, sustainability, and impact. In parallel, the Green Concept Award recognizes visionary, not-yet-marketed ideas, often from students and young designers; it is supported in cooperation with the IKEA Stiftung. The award is organized by the non-profit Green Future Club, based in Germany.\nHistory\nThe competition was launched in 2013. Since then, the number of international submissions has grown steadily: in 2023 about 1,300 entries from 40 countries were submitted, and in 2024 around 1,500 entries from 54 countries – a new record.\nCategories\nThe award covers a wide range of thematic categories, including Architecture, Interior & Lifestyle, Workplace, Kitchen, Mobility, New Materials, Fashion, Children’s Products, Consumer Goods, Packaging, and Freestyle. For non-marketed projects, the parallel Green Concept Award is presented.\nGreen Trend Books\nSince 2013, the annual Green Trend Books have documented around 200 international best practice examples each year. In addition to winners and finalists, the books feature trend analyses, jury insights, and expert articles. They are intended as an inspiration for designers, businesses, and consumers.\nSelected winners\nThe following overview lists selected winners by year:\n2025\n* OliPhenolia (Fattoria La Vialla) – natural cosmetics from olive polyphenols\n* WOODMER® Seal (Ecohelix) – biobased packaging\n* Carpe Diem (Organoid Technologies) – interior material\n* Stadtfuchs – 3D-printed e-bike\n* RAIS (rolf.produktions GmbH)\n2024\n* Archisonic Cotton (Impact Acoustic)\n* LOVR (Revoltech)\n* Forestlines Slats (Paulussen Houthandel)\n* Maxwell (HT Materials Science)\n* Cocoli (Cocoli GmbH)\n* Second Use for E-Motors (Audi AG)\n2023\n* NEOO (Object Carpet) – first circular carpet made of pure polyester\n* Rex (Circuform / Ineke Hans) – deposit-return chair\n* Dishwasher G 7465 SCVi AutoDos (Miele)\n* Daika Wood (start-up by May Meyerson & Guy Gurevich)\n* Adapt Heat Pump (Kronoterm)\n2022\n* BE O Cup (BE O Bottle B.V.)\n* Rufus (Rufus)\n* recable (recable GmbH)\n* Waterdrop (Waterdrop GmbH)\n2021\n* Shoes made from apple waste\n* Sunglasses from ocean plastic\n2020\n* Desserto – Cactus Vegan Leather (Adriano Di Marti)\n* No Footprint House (A-01)\n* Grohe Plus (Grohe AG)\n* Loadster (citkar GmbH)\n2019\n* SYSBOARD / WALL (Studio Hartensteiner GmbH)\n* Bananatex (QWSTION International GmbH)\n* WELLTEX (Object Carpet GmbH)\n* Pocket Rocket (SOL Motors)\n2018\n* Resysta Universal Performance Board (Resysta International GmbH)\n* Grohe Sense Guard (Grohe AG)\n* LignoLoc (Raimund Beck KG)\n* plantCube (Agrilution GmbH)\n* EnBW mobility+ App (EnBW AG)\n2017\n* Haier BCD-360WDCAU1 (Haier)\n* Fairphone (Fairphone B.V.)\n* Drumback (Viasit)\n* Blue Home (Grohe AG)\n* Greentom Baby Stroller (Greentom)\n2016\n* Aqua Balance (Weber Saint-Gobain)\n* Grano (Giroflex)\n* Corcrete (Design Studio Niruk)\n* Kahla Porcelain – public award\n2015\n* Soulbottles (Soulbottles GmbH)\n* Acoustic Green 2.0 (Akustik Fabrik)\n* Artichair (Spyros Kizis Studio)\n2014\n* Lease a Jeans (Mud Jeans)\n* MOTO Biopolymer Pedal (MOTO Bicycles)\n* Nachbars Garten – sustainable apple juice (Das Geld hängt an den Bäumen)\n2013\n* Winners documented in the Green Product Book 2013/14.\nCriticism\n* Costs: Participation fees have been criticized as a barrier for small actors. The organizers respond with discounts for start-ups and free entry for students in the Concept Award.\n* Transparency: Jury criteria are published; participants have received detailed, point-based feedback since the award’s inception.\n* Sustainability: Whether winning products survive on the market is difficult to track. This is addressed through expert feedback, exhibitions, and the annual Green Trend Books.\nReception\nInterviews with founder Nils Bader highlight the award’s role as a platform for networking and knowledge transfer. In his md Magazin column, Bader regularly analyzes trends in green product development. Media such as *Cradle Mag*, *Designboom*, and *Spielwarenmesse.de* have described the award as an important driver in sustainable design.\nExternal links\n* [https://www.gp-award.com Official website]\nReferences"
