A post office operated under the name Stovalls Gap from 1926 to 1927 and under the name Howard from 1927 to 1942. Moss & McCormack, a coal company based in Birmingham, leased the area in 1923 to open a coal mine. A miner from Kansas, Alabama died in a mining accident at the Howard Mine in 1935.\nReferences"
