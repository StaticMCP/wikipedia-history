The book recounts Becker's 1978 reporting trip to Democratic Kampuchea, accompanied by journalist Richard Dudman and academic Malcolm Caldwell, upon the invitation of senior Khmer Rouge officials. Becker was one of the few foreigners to travel to the country during the regime, and included her interviewing Pol Pot. It was loosely adapted into the 2024 Rithy Panh film Meeting with Pol Pot.\nReferences"
