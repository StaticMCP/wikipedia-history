Subsites of a site are in the format XX00-00101-. For example, the Aghade Holed Stone (located in County Carlow) has the RMP code CW013-032---. It is also National Monument number 347; the two numbering schemes are not connected.\nWhile many sites recorded on the RMP are protected under the National Monuments Acts, not all entries are automatically afforded heritage protection.\nSee also\n* National monument (Ireland)\n* National Inventory of Architectural Heritage\n* Northern Ireland Sites and Monuments Record\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.archaeology.ie/publications-forms-legislation/record-of-monuments-and-places RMP maps and manuals by county]"
