Here, learning that Mustafa Çelebi was marching on him, he went south and met the Ottoman army in Kıreli. The Aq Qoyunlu army, which launched a sudden attack as soon as the battle started, faltered in the face of the rapid response of the Ottomans and lost its battle order.\nWhile most of the Aq Qoyunlu army was destroyed, Yusufça Mirza and his brothers Zeynel and Ömer Mirzas were captured.
