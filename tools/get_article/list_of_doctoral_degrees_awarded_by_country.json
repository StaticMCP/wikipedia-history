In fact, Czech lawgivers have enacted an orthographical mistake.\nDenmark\nThe Danish ph.d. degree has no further subdivisions and grants the holder the postposed title of ph.d..

All research doctorates are Ph.D. without any further specification. These doctorates are the only Dutch doctorates formally allowing the use of the title \"doctor\". The Netherlands has one professional doctorate in Engineering bestowed by the (research) universities of technology (at its start called PDEng - professional doctorate in engineering but since renamed). Since 2023, Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences have piloted the Professional Doctorate (UAS-PD), a practice-oriented doctoral program designed to develop research professionals within applied sciences. Unlike traditional PhD programs, the UAS-PD emphasizes solving practical challenges in professional contexts. Van Houten critically compares the UAS-PD with professional doctorates in the United Kingdom, noting differences in orientation, programme structure, and challenges related to international recognition of the degree. The exact naming of a future title was still not settled upon by mid 2025.\n* Doctor / PhD\n* Engineering Doctorate (EngD)\nPakistan\n* Doctor of Medicine (MD)\n* Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)\n* Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)\n* Doctor of Science (DSc)\n* Doctor of Law\n* Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM)\n* Doctor of Nutrition and Dietetics (DND)\n* Doctor of Physiotherapy (DPT)\n* Fellow of College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan (FCPS)\n* doctor of optometry (OD)\nSouth Africa\n:See: List of universities in South Africa''\n*Doctor of Philosophy  (PhD or DPhil) offered at Traditional Universities\n*Doctor of Engineering  (DEng or DIng) offered at Traditional Universities\n*Doctor of Science  (DSc) offered at Traditional Universities; may be the Higher doctorate in Science\n*Doctor of Business Administration  (DBA) Offered at Business Schools\n*Doctor of Literature and Philosophy (DLitt et Phil) offered at the University of South Africa and other formerly Afrikaans Universities\n*Doctor of Technology (DTech, also \"Doctor Technologiae\") offered at the Universities of Technology\n*Doctor of Laws (LLD) offered at South African Law schools; at some, the Higher doctorate in Law - see Doctor of Law#South Africa\nSri Lanka\n* Doctor of Philosophy (PhD or DPhil)\n* Doctor of Science (DSc)\n* Doctor of Laws (LLD)\n* Doctor of Letters (DLitt)\n* Doctor of Medicine (MD)\n* Doctor of Business Administration (DBA)\nUnited Kingdom\nFirst doctorates\nGraduate-entry degrees in which the candidate must prepare (usually over a period of three or four years full-time, under the supervision of a more experienced researcher) a thesis or other portfolio of publishable research, demonstrating a contribution to knowledge in the chosen field. The Quality Assurance Agency categorises doctorates into three types: \"subject specialist doctorates\", \"doctorates by publication\", and \"professional and practice-based (or practitioner) doctorates\". Doctorates in the last category, such as the EdD, DClinPsych, DBA and EngD, have a greater emphasis on applied research and professional practice, however they still contain a substantial research component.\nSubject specialist doctorates\n* Doctor of Philosophy (PhD or DPhil)\n** Integrated subject specialist doctorates are usually qualified as 'Integrated PhD', 'PhD by integrated study' or 'PhD with integrated study'.\n* European Doctorate (DocEuro)\nDoctorates by publication\n* Doctor of Philosophy by publication or Doctor of Philosophy by published works (PhD or DPhil)\nProfessional and practice-based (or practitioner) doctorates\nIf not given a generic title, these are frequently titled 'Doctor of [subject name]', with the abbreviation D[subject abbreviation] or [subject abbrecation]D.\nGeneric titles:\n* Doctor of Work-based Learning (DProf)\n* Professional Doctorate (ProfDoc, DProf or Prof.D)\n* Doctor of Professional Practice/Doctorate in Professional Practice (DProf)\n* Doctor of Professional Studies (DProf or DPS)\nHealth, Medicine and related subjects:\n* Professional Doctorate in Advanced Healthcare Practice (DAHP)\n* Doctor of Applied Education and Child Psychology (Ap.Ed and ChildPsy D)\n* Doctor of Applied Educational Psychology (Professional Training) (DAppEdPsy)\n* Doctor of Applied Psychology (Education) (DAppPsyEd)\n* Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy or DClinPsych)\n* Doctor of Clinical Science&ndash;Psychotherapy (DClinSci&ndash;Psychotherapy)\n* Doctor of Counselling Psychology (DCounsPsy)\n* Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS)\n* Doctor of Dental Science (DDSc)\n* Doctor of Educational Psychology (DEdPsy)\n* Doctor of Forensic Psychology Practice (Foren.Psy.D or DForenPsy)\n* Doctor of Health Research (DHRes)\n* Doctor of Health Science (HScD)\n** Doctor of Health Science (Clinical) (HScD (Clin))\n* Doctor of Health Studies (DHS)\n* Doctor of Medicine (MD or MD (Res)) (In most universities this degree is a first doctorate, although some classify it as a higher doctorate.)\n* Doctor of Occupational Psychology (DOccPsych)\n* Doctor of Psychology (DPsych)\n* Doctor of Public Health (DrPH)\n* Professional Doctorate in Workplace Health and Wellbeing (DocWHW)\nOther subjects:\n* Doctor of Architecture (DArch)\n* Professional Doctorate in Architecture, Design and Built Environment (DArch)\n* Professional Doctorate in Agriculture and Food (DAgriFood)\n* Doctor of Business Administration (DBA)\n* Doctor of the Built Environment (DBEnv)\n* Doctor in Civil Engineering (EngD)\n* Doctor in Construction (EngD)\n* Doctor of Construction Management (DConsMgt)\n* Doctorate in Creative Arts (DCreative)\n* Professional Doctorate in Criminal Justice (DCrimJ)\n* Professional Doctorate in Security Risk Management (DSyRM)\n* Doctorate in Criminology and Criminal Justice (DCCJ)\n* Professional Doctorate in Applied Criminology (DAppCrim)\n* Professional Doctorate in Data Science (DDataSci)\n* Doctorate in Design/Doctor of Design (DDes)\n* Doctor of Digital Media (DDM)\n* Doctor of Education/Professional Doctorate in Education (EdD)\n* Doctor of Engineering (EngD or DEng)\n* Doctor of Fashion Industry (DFI)\n* Doctor of Fine Art (DArt)\n* Doctorate in Fine Arts/Doctor of Fine Art (DFA)\n* Doctorate in Heritage (DHeritage)\n* Doctor of Legal Practice (DLegalPrac)\n* Professional Doctorate in Applied Linguistics (DAppLing)\n* Doctor of Management (DMan)\n* Doctor of Ministry (DMin)\n* Doctorate in Music (DMus)\n* Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA or AMusD)\n* Doctor of Practical Theology (DPT)\n* Doctor of Public Management (DPM)\n* Doctor of Public Policy (DPP)\n* Professional Doctorate in Policy Research and Practice (DPRP)\n* Doctor of Real Estate (DRealEst)\n* Professional Doctorate in Security Risk Management (DSyRM)\n* Doctor of Social and Public Policy (SPPD)\n* Doctor of Social Practice (DSocPrac)\n* Doctor of Social Science/Doctorate in Social science (DSocSci)\n* Doctor of Social Work (DSW)\n* Doctorate in Sport and Exercise (DSE)\n* Doctor of Theology (Th.D.)\n* Professional Doctorate in Pastoral Theology (DPT)\n* Doctor of Practical Theology (DPT)\n* Professional Doctorate in Practical Theology (DPracTheol or DThM)\n* Professional Doctorate in Veterinary Science (DVet)\n* Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM)\n* Doctor of Veterinary Science (DVet Med, DVSc or DVS)\nHigher doctorates\nHigher doctorates are awarded to established academics in recognition of a substantial body of original research undertaken over the course of many years.
