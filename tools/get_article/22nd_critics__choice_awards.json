The ceremony was broadcast on A&E and T.J. Miller returned to host for the second consecutive time. The television nominations were announced on November 14, 2016, while the film nominations were announced on December 1, 2016. HBO led the nominations for television with 22, followed by ABC and Netflix with 12 each. The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story won four awards, becoming the biggest TV winner of the night, followed by Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, Saturday Night Live and Westworld'' with two wins each.\nThis year's ceremony date was moved to December from its usual January slot. The move came in hopes to get ahead of the 74th Golden Globe Awards on NBC. However, the following ceremony returned to its traditional January date in 2018.\nViola Davis received the first-ever #SeeHer Award, an honor that recognizes her work furthering the portrayal of three-dimensional women onscreen in 2016. The award is presented by the Association of National Advertisers in conjunction with A&E Networks.\nWinners and nominees\nFilm\n, Best Director winner and Best Original Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Best Actor winner]]\n, Best Actress winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actor winner]]\n, Best Supporting Actress winner]]\n, Best Young Actor/Actress winner]]\n, Best Original Screenplay co-winner]]\n, Best Actor in an Action Movie winner]]\n, Best Actress in an Action Movie winner]]\n, Best Actor in a Comedy Movie winner]]\n, Best Actress in a Comedy Movie winner]]\n, Best Score winner]]\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\nLa La Land\n* Arrival\n* Fences\n* Hacksaw Ridge\n* Hell or High Water\n* Lion\n* Loving\n* Manchester by the Sea\n* Moonlight\n* Sully\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n'Damien Chazelle – La La Land'\n* Mel Gibson – Hacksaw Ridge\n* Barry Jenkins – Moonlight\n* Kenneth Lonergan – Manchester by the Sea\n* David Mackenzie – Hell or High Water\n* Denis Villeneuve – Arrival\n* Denzel Washington – Fences\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n'Casey Affleck – Manchester by the Sea as Lee Chandler'\n* Joel Edgerton – Loving as Richard Loving\n* Andrew Garfield – Hacksaw Ridge as Desmond Doss\n* Ryan Gosling – La La Land as Sebastian Wilder\n* Tom Hanks – Sully as Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger\n* Denzel Washington – Fences as Troy Maxson\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n'Natalie Portman – Jackie as Jackie Kennedy'\n* Amy Adams – Arrival as Dr. Louise Banks\n* Annette Bening – 20th Century Women as Dorothea Fields\n* Isabelle Huppert – Elle as Michèle LeBlanc\n* Ruth Negga – Loving as Mildred Loving\n* Emma Stone – La La Land as Mia Dolan\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n'Mahershala Ali – Moonlight as Juan'\n* Jeff Bridges – Hell or High Water as Marcus Hamilton\n* Ben Foster – Hell or High Water as Tanner Howard\n* Lucas Hedges – Manchester by the Sea as Patrick Chandler\n* Dev Patel – Lion as Saroo Brierley\n* Michael Shannon – Nocturnal Animals as Detective Bobby Andes\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n'Viola Davis – Fences as Rose Maxson'\n* Greta Gerwig – 20th Century Women as Abbie Porter\n* Naomie Harris – Moonlight as Paula\n* Nicole Kidman – Lion as Sue Brierley\n* Janelle Monáe – Hidden Figures as Mary Jackson\n* Michelle Williams – Manchester by the Sea as Randi Chandler\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n'Lucas Hedges – Manchester by the Sea as Patrick Chandler'\n* Alex R.
