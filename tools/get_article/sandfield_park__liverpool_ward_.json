The Sandfield Park ward was created as a single-member ward from the western quarter of the former West Derby ward and the north-western corner of the former Knotty Ash ward. The ward boundaries follow Muirhead Avenue, Almonds Green, Barnfield Drive, Eaton Road, Thomas Lane then behind Thomas Lane Playing Field, the North Liverpool Extension Line, Alder Road, and Queens Drive.
