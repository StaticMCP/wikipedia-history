Starting in late December Japanese began bombing the city;ground forces reached the city by 11 January 1942.\nThe battle was part of Empire of Japan's expansive attack across the Pacific in December 1941, invading and attacking all over the Pacific, from Pearl Harbor, striking islands across the Pacific, Philippines, Malaya, Borneo, Burma, and Thailand. The invasion of Malaya leading up this battle had started after midnight on December 8 with the invasion of Kota Bharu.\nBackground\nJapanese naval aircraft launched the first air raid over Kuala Lumpur on 21 and 22 December 1941. British anti-aircraft guns and RAF aircraft intercepted the attack and shot down one Japanese aircraft and damaged another. More raids followed on the 25th and 27th. The last bombing was on 10 January 1942, after Port Swettenham fell.\nBy 7 January, the northern part of Malaya, including Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and the Straits Settlement of Penang had fallen into Japanese hands.\nAfter the Battle of Slim River, the Japanese troops' next military objective was Kuala Lumpur. Being the capital of the Federated Malay States it was of utmost importance to the Japanese. Kuala Lumpur by then was also the capital of the State of Selangor. The city was also home to RAF Kuala Lumpur.\nPrelude\nOn 7 January, it was decided to abandon Selangor and Negeri Sembilan to the Japanese, and British forces began a quick retreat to Johor then to Singapore. The city, now abandoned, quickly descended into a state of anarchy and chaos. Looting was widespread; the Robinsons and Whiteaway and Laidlaw department stores at Java Street were sacked by panicked KLites. Cinemas such as Cathay and Odeon at Batu Road were closed, and the Malay Mail published its last pre-war issue. The FMS administration is no longer in place.\nAs the British retreated, they continued the scorched earth policy they had used in Perak - tin mines, rubber plantations and munitions were simply torched. Fires continued to burn for days even after the Japanese took over Kuala Lumpur.\nJapanese entry\nOn 10 January the Japanese reached Serendah, about 26&nbsp;km from Kuala Lumpur.\nThe following day the Japanese entered Kuala Lumpur without much resistance, besides small skirmishes. The British troops had left the city. The Japanese troops quickly took control of government and institutional buildings, such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, the railway station and the Pudu Jail.\nAfter the battle, the Japanese used Pudu Jail as a POW detention centre. Many Allied POWs were tortured to death.\nAftermath\nJapanese troops continued their advance southward along highway 1. Kajang was bombed on 12 January; the bombs, intended for the railway station, missed, and landed on a nearby church instead.\nKuala Lumpur, with the rest of the peninsula, remained under Japanese occupation until September 1945, when the Japanese home islands surrendered unconditionally after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by American forces in August 1945. The British Military Administration took over thereafter.\nLittle is known about the battle, since it did not bear much significance when compared to greater battles in British Malaya such as the Battle of Singapore.\nSee also\n* Battle of Slim River\n* Battle of Singapore\n* Bombing of Kuala Lumpur (1945)\n* Operation Tiderace (1945)\nNotes\nReferences\n*"
