Howard (1817 – 1897) was an American, Ohio statesman, who lived in Winameg, Fulton County, Ohio.\nLife and work\nHoward was born 3 November 1817 in Dresden Yates Co., New York. His family moved to Fort Meigs when he was three years old.\nHe served as a negotiator between the government and the Odawa Native American tribe in northwest Ohio. He was a frequent advocate on behalf of the Odawa. Howard named the first Fulton County seat, Ottokee, Ohio, after a local Odawa chief of the same name. He also served as the first president of the Fulton County Historical Society.\nHe aided in the Underground Railroad, helping slaves reach freedom in Ohio. He also served as a Senator in Ohio.\nDeath\nHe died of cancer on 9 November 1897 in Winnameg. He was laid to rest near his home in Winameg, and near the tomb of the Odawa Chief Winameg. His tomb was of his own making. A historical plaque located in Winameg, memorializing Dresden, reads as follows:\nCouncil Oak\nFrom around 1692 to 1992, a White Oak (Querus alba), that became known as the Council Oak, grew on this spot. At full maturity it stood 75 feet high and measured 5 feet in diameter. From 1800 to 1840 many important meetings concerning the Potawatamie took place under its branches.\nTwo of the best-known people to meet under this tree were Chief Winameg and a young American named Dresden Howard who lived on this farm. Because of his knowledge of the Potawatamie language and customs, Dresden, who was later known as a \"Colonel\" Howard, represented the U.S. government in negotiations with the Potawatamie.\nThe diseased tree was cut down on May 27, 1992. A section of the tree was carved into a life-sized depiction of Dresden Howard and Chief Winameg and is displayed at the Sauder Village in nearby Archbold, Ohio.\nBoth Chief Winameg and Dresden Howard are buried on this property.\nDresden Howard is remembered in the Fulton County community with life-size depiction of him that is that displayed at Sauder Village in Archbold, Ohio.\nReferences"
