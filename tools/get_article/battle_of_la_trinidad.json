He then took possession of a tobacco factory, an important place in western Honduras, and headed for the city of Comayagua. Milla set up his headquarters in San Esteban, southwest of the Honduran capital.\nSiege of Comayagua\nOn April 4,1827 while General Milla prepared to attack the city, Francisco Morazán was among the city's defense force. Milla ordered an advance and, without respite, faced the Honduran troops under heavy fire. The action ended in Milla's favor, who proceeded to set fire to the city. President of Honduras Dionisio Herrera was taken prisoner on May 9, 1827, who then capitulated the following day and was sent to Guatemala. While José Justo Milla was taking control, General Morazán managed to escape the city with Colonel Remigio Díaz and Colonel José Antonio Márquez. Morazán and his officers went to Tegucigalpa, where they were reinforced with 300 men and made plans to return to Comayagua. Before they could reach Comayagua, on the heights of Villa de San Antonio, they were attacked by an advance troop under the command of Colonel Hernández and Captain Rosa Medina. Morazán took a defensive position at the estate of La Maradiaga and entered into combat with on May 29, where Colonel Hernández and his invading forces were defeated. Morazán returned to Tegucigalpa and reinforced again.\nAllied Army\nFrancisco Morazán, having safe passage, went to Choluteca in the south of Honduras where he met with his family in Ojojona. He was then taken prisoner by the Commandant of Arms of Tegucigalpa. Being let out on bail some 23 days later, he was obliged to retire to El Salvador on July 28, 1827. Following this he went to León in Nicaragua where his friend, General José Anacleto Ordóñez Bermúdez, known as \"Cleto\" Ordóñez, provided him with 135 men. Later, he was joined by Salvadoran soldiers under the command of Colonel José Zepeda. Morazán, commanding the allied forces, managed to return to Choluteca where Colonel José Antonio Márquez was waiting with a division of men to join the \"cause of liberty\". The first Honduran town they arrived in was San Antonio de Texiguat which also offered support with arms and men.\nThe Battle\nLieutenant General José Justo Milla discovered the presence of Francisco Morazán in the south of Honduras and quickly moved with his men to Tegucigalpa where he established his headquarters. Morazán went to the town of Sabanagrande to prepare for a decisive combat in the \"Valle de la Trinidad\".\nAt 9:00 in the morning of November 11, 1827, Colonel Ramón Pacheco made the first maneuver commanding his force of men to take a position at the road leading from Ojojona to the Valle de la Trinidad.\nColonel Remigio Díaz commanding his force of 150 men moved along the shore of a \"Sicatacaro\" ravine, heading northeast from Ojojona to the Valle de la Trinidad to attack the enemy's rear.\nGeneral Morazán along with Colonel Román Valladares in command of the other detachment of the Allied forces surrounded the \"Caranguije\" hill and attacked the right flank of the Federal forces.\nThe fighting intensified during the next five hours, and at 3:00 pm the Federal troops under Milla were crushed by the men under the command of General Francisco Morazán. Defeated, General José Justo Milla and some of his officers that survived fled the field of battle leaving documents, trunks, and other equipment behind. There were 40 casualties including wounded and dead.\n(1827).
