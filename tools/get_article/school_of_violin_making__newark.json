It is in early Italian Gothic style and incorporates a manager's house. In 1891 the bank suffered an embarrassment when it was revealed that the manager of the Newark branch, Robert James Beard, had defrauded the bank of £25,000 () before drowning himself in the River Trent. The bank covered the loss from its reserves.\nIt became the London, County, Westminster & Parr's Bank in 1919. The tower was reduced in height in 1957.\nSchool of Violin Making\nAround 1972 the building was surplus to requirements and was converted for the use of the School of Violin Making. This is now part of Lincoln College, Lincolnshire.\nSee also\n*Listed buildings in Newark-on-Trent\nReferences"
