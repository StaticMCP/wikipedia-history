It lies approximately  north-east of Złocieniec,  north-east of Drawsko Pomorskie, and  east of the regional capital Szczecin.\nUntil the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the area was part of the Kingdom of Poland, in 1772–1871 it was in Prussia, and in 1871–1945 belonged to Germany. After World War II it was reintegrated with Poland. During the war the Germans established and operated a forced labour camp for prisoners of war of various nationalities in the village.\nReferences"
