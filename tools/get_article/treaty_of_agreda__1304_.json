King Ferdinand IV of Castile and King James II of Aragon were present with their courts. The negotiations were mediated by King Denis of Portugal, who issued an arbitral decision at Torrellas, near Tarazona in Aragonese territory, on 8 August.\nBackground\nIn his last will and testament, Alfonso X had given the king of France the right to defend the rights of inheritance of Alfonso's grandsons, the sons of his late heir, Fernando de la Cerda. In 1288, however, Alfonso's second son, Sancho IV, negotiated the Treaty of Lyon with King Philip IV of France whereby the latter dropped his support for Sancho's nephews. The elder of the nephews, Alfonso de la Cerda, then sought the support of King Alfonso III of Aragon, who had him crowned in opposition to Sancho IV. The young king in exile then ceded Murcia to James, who conquered it between 1296 and 1301. He also invaded lands of the Lordship of Villena. The resolution of the war over Murcia was dependent on a resolution of the disputed Castilian succession.\nThe infante John of Valencia de Campos, the younger brother of Sancho IV and uncle of Alfonso de la Cerda, could claim a share of the kingdom through his father's will. In 1295, he was recognzied as King of León by King Denis of Portugal. The result was an alliance between Portugal, John of Valencia de Campos, Aragon and Alfonso de la Cerda against Ferdinand IV. In 1300, however, John made peace with Ferdinand and became his close ally.\nNegotiations\nThe treaty, originally drawn up in the Castilian language, was eventually copied into the Livro Quinto, a cartulary of King Denis's chancery, where it is accompanied by six subsidiary documents. These documents trace the progress of the negotiations that culminated in the treaty. On 20 February 1304, Ferdinand IV appointed his uncle, John of Valencia de Campos, as his representative. John met with James II and Alfonso de la Cerda, who claimed the throne of Castile, on 20 April for preliminary negotiations. There were six separate agreements negotiated before the finally treaty as part of the process:\n#On 20 April, Alfonso and John (on behalf of Ferdinand IV) agreed to accept the arbitration of James II and Denis over the right to the throne of Castile.\n#On 20 April, James II submitted his claims to Murcia to the arbitration of King Denis, John of Valencia and Bishop Jimeno de Ahe, handing them the castles of , , ,  and  as surety.\n#On 21 April, in a separate agreement, James II promised the arbitrators that he would not attack the castles he handed over.\n#On 3 May, Ferdinand IV submitted his claims to Murcia to the arbitration of King Denis, John of Valencia and Bishop Jimeno de Ahe, handing them the castles of Alfaro, , Autón,  and Atienza as surety.\n#On 7 May, Ferdinand IV agreed to accept the arbitral decision of King Denis.\n#On 10 June, Ferdinand informed Denis that he and James had reached an agreement regarding the Murcian border.\nOn 1 August 1304, Ferdinand IV appointed his chancellors, Ferrench Gómez and Diego García, to act as his proxies at Ágreda for the Murcian dispute. He empowered the infante John to act as his proxy in the case of Alfonso de la Cerda. He himself did not cross the border.\nArbitral decisions and treaty signing\nAs a result of these agreements, two arbitral tribunals handed down decisions in two separate suits on 8 August. King Denis, John of Valencia and Bishop Jimeno demarcated the border between the two crowns in Murcia, while King Denis and King James decided the fate of Alfonso de la Cerda. A record of the latter sentence still exists, but no record of the former sentence has been preserved.\nFollowing the sentences handed down in Torrellas (Torrijos) in Aragon, the final peace treaty between the sovereigns was signed at Ágreda in Castile. James II, Ferdinand IV, Denis and John of Valencia de Campos were the signatories. In the words of the treaty:\n}}\nIn the treaty, Aragon was awarded many cities north of the Segura, and James retained a portion of Villena. However, the treaty did not establish a definitive border, something only finalized the following year by the Treaty of Elche. According to the Crónica of Ramon Muntaner:\n, Crevillente, Abanilla, Callosa, Orihuela, and Guardamar.}}\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*"
