He broke with the Neo-Gothic style adopted by his predecessors Thomas Seaton Scott and Thomas Fuller; rather he embraced the Baronial style exemplified in several important buildings.\nPersonal\nEwart was married to Jeanne Marie Doyen until her death in 1885 and then with Annie Sigsworth Simpson from 1887 to his death in 1921. His son John Albert Ewart was an acclaimed Ottawa architect.\nWorks\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:1em auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:lightblue;\"\n!width=28%|Building\n!width=8%|Year Completed\n!width=20%|Builder\n!width=10%|Style\n!width=32%|Location\n!width=7%|Image\n|-\n| Rideau Cottage\n| 1905\n| David Ewart - 1905 rear addition\n| Georgian Revival\n| Ottawa, Ontario\n|\n|-\n| Connaught Building\n| 1913\n| David Ewart\n| Tudor-Gothic\n| Ottawa, Ontario\n|\n|-\n| Victoria Memorial Building\n| 1912\n| David Ewart\n| Baronial style\n| Ottawa, Ontario\n|\n|-\n| Royal Canadian Mint\n| 1908\n| David Ewart\n| Tudor-Gothic\n| Ottawa, Ontario\n|\n|-\n| Mappin Wing (or front facade) of Rideau Hall\n| 1913\n| David Ewart\n| Baronial style\n| Ottawa, Ontario\n|\n|-\n| Customs Examining Warehouse, Sinclair Centre\n| 1911-1913\n| David Ewart\n| Scottish Baronial architecture\n| Vancouver, BC\n|\n|-\n| Moose Jaw City Hall\n| 1914\n| David Ewart\n| Edwardian Classical\n| Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan\n|\n|-\n| Strathcona Public Building\n| 1913\n| David Ewart\n| Baronial style\n| Edmonton, Alberta\n|\n|-\n| Post Office Building, Sinclair Centre  (home to Postal Station A; clock by John Smith & Sons, 1909)\n| 1905-1910\n| David Ewart\n| Edwardian Baroque architecture\n| Vancouver, British Columbia\n|\n|-\n| Prince Edward Building\n| 1906\n| David Ewart\n| Baronial style\n| Regina, Saskatchewan\n|\n|-\n| Bowmanville Post Office\n|\n| David Ewart\n| Baronial style\n| Bowmanville, Ontario\n|\n|-\n| Humboldt Post Office\n| 1911\n| David Ewart\n| Baronial style\n| Humboldt, Saskatchewan\n|\n|-\n|Royal Military College of Canada Fort Lasalle Dormitory Building R33\n|1912\n| David Ewart\n|Baronial style\n|Kingston, Ontario\n* recognized Federal Heritage Building 1990\nhonours René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle.
