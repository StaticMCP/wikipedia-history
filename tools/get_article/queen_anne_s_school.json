There are around 450 pupils. Nearly half are full, weekly or flexi-boarders. The school awards scholarships in academic subjects, sport, music, art and drama at ages 11 and 13 and at sixth form entry.\nQueen Anne's is a member of the Girls' Schools Association and the Boarding Schools' Association. Queen Anne's was chosen as one of Tatler magazine's Top 225 prep and public schools 2010.\nHistory\nIn 1698 eight merchants founded the Grey Coat Hospital, a Christian foundation. In 1706 the foundation received a royal charter from Queen Anne. In 1874 Grey Coat Hospital became a girls' school. The Grey Coat Hospital Foundation used part of its endowment to buy a mansion in Henley Road in Caversham which became Queen Anne's School in 1894. The site was previously occupied by Amersham Hall School. The history of the school is covered in a 2008 book by Daniel Talbot, former head of history, ''The Scarlet Runners: A Social History of Queen Anne's, Caversham''.\nFacilities\nQueen Anne's campus is a  site with landscaped gardens and playing fields immediately adjacent to the teaching and boarding accommodation. The facilities include a café for sixth formers and parents (opened 2009) and a Chapel, designed by Reginald Blomfield. In 2016, the school opened a new Sixth Form Centre.\nThe Main Block and Chapel at Queen Anne's School are Grade II listed buildings.\nSport\nLacrosse, tennis, swimming and netball are major sports at Queen Anne's and there is provision for most other sports either at the school or at local clubs. The school has produced Olympic and national-level sportswomen.\nMusic\nThe school's own groups include: Chamber Choir, Consort Choir, Saxoholics, Saxability, Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, Wind Quartet, Flute Group, Swing Band and Junior Wind Band. The Chamber Choir, Saxoholics and Consort Choir have performed in New York, London and Rome.\nDrama\nThe school puts on three full-scale productions a year, and organises masterclasses and workshops with professional practitioners. In 2007, a Queen Anne's student featured in the St Trinians film.\nDebating and public speaking\nQueen Anne's School was a founder of the World Individual Debating and Public Speaking Championships and its students participate in the competition every year. It has also hosted the event on a number of occasions, most recently in 2003.\nAcademic performance\nThe 2011 Ofsted Social Care report rated the school as 'outstanding', which Ofsted translates as \"The main inspection finding is that this is an outstanding\nboarding school. The outcomes for boarders as described in the Every Child Matters document and underpinned by the nationally agreed standards are excellent. The school has an exceptionally high commitment towards enabling girls to fulfil their potential.\"\nThe Independent Schools Inspectorate's Inspection Report 2011 said: \"The pupils’ overall achievement is excellent. The school meets highly successfully its aim to enable pupils to go onto higher education, and develop their talents fully.\" and \"The quality of the pupils’ personal development is excellent, ensuring that the school’s aim to enable them to become confident, well-balanced individuals is met with resounding success.\"\nNotable former pupils\n*Lesley Abdela, human rights campaigner\n*Barbara Brooke, Baroness Brooke of Ystradfellte, politician\n*Olivia Carnegie-Brown, Olympic rower\n*Christine Chaundler, children's author\n*Janet Chisholm, MI6 agent during the Cold War\n*Helena Cobban, writer and researcher on international relations\n*Valerie Eliot, wife of poet T.
