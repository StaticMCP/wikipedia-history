In July 1827 he accepted the office of principal of a college and school at Mount Radford, Exeter, and began his duties on 29 September 1827. In consequence of disputes with the proprietors he resigned or was dismissed from this office (the immediate cause of his leaving depends on the rights of the case) in the following January.\nIn 1835, Burrow went out to Gibraltar as civil chaplain, and was appointed Archdeacon of Gibraltar in 1842. Having remained there until his health became feeble, he then returned to England in 1859 and resided at Lyme Regis and other places on the south coast.
