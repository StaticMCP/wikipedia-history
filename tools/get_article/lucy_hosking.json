One of Hosking's most important contributions is her publication on the Devonian rocks of the Kimberley region of north-west Western Australia. Her insights were produced by analysing field notes and reports produced by Arthur Wade, palaeontologist from the Freyey Oil Company, and two collections of fossils: Minyu Gap specimens courtesy of Torrington Blatchford and Henry William Beamish Talbot (geologists from the Geological Survey of Western Australia) in 1929, and Barker Gorge specimens collected by Allan Thomas Wells in 1922. Both collections are deposited in the UWA Geological Collection (currently the Edward de Courcy Clarke Earth Science Museum of the UWA).\nAfter Hosking married, she resigned her career as a geoscientist.\nOutside of geology, Hosking was also a fan of dramatic art and won a bachelor's degree in arts from the UWA in 1925.\nThe Royal Society of Western Australia sponsors a Memorial Award in her name.\nSelected works\n* E. d.
