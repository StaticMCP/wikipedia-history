Many of the events in the book are based on Uris's own World War II experience with the 6th Marine Regiment.\nThe story is largely told in first person from the viewpoint of the Battalion Communications Chief, \"Mac,\" although it frequently shifts to third person in scenes where Mac is not personally present.\nThe book was a commercial success. The New York Times gave it a mixed review. A film version followed in 1955.\nPublication\nThe novel was rejected by a dozen publishers before being published by G.P. Putnam's Sons. It went on to be a commercial success, due in part to its patriotic spirit. It was one of the best-selling books of 1953, as determined by Publishers Weekly. Warner Brothers purchased the film rights.\nCharacters\nThe characters in the book come from a variety of backgrounds, and cover a broad range of American archetypes.  The interaction of the characters as they learn to put aside their prejudices and biases to bond, developing esprit de corps, is a primary theme of the novel.\n* \"Mac\": A Master Tech Sergeant, a career Marine with 30 years of service in the Corps, and the Battalion Communications Chief. He gives his name only as \"Mac.\" He is the book's primary narrator and provides much of the old hand viewpoint of the story, also providing perspective on changes in the Marine Corps during the war.\n* Daniel \"Danny\" Forester: An All-American boy from Baltimore. While the book does not have one central character, the story tends to focus on Danny more than anyone else. He leaves high school before graduation and gives up a scholarship to Georgia Tech to join the Marine Corps when the war breaks out; goes through Boot Camp and becomes a member of 2nd Battalion's radio squad.\n* Lamont Quincy \"L.Q.\" Jones: The unit's clown, from Los Angeles.

A member of the radio squad. The most openly racist character in the unit. His attitude toward certain other men, particularly Pedro Rojas and Jake Levin, is the source of significant interpersonal conflict.\n* Andrew \"Andy\" Hookans: A lumberjack from Washington, the \"big dumb Swede.\" A member of the radio squad.\n* Shining Lighttower: A Navajo Native American.

Also described are their boot camp experiences in San Diego and their two assignments to US Marine camps in New Zealand, the first time for preparatory training for the Battle of Guadalcanal and then back again for rest and recovery before the Tarawa campaign.  Their experiences in New Zealand reveal the very different cultures of the two allies, and how much the young marines enjoyed the hospitality of the local people, in spite of being what has been called a 'friendly invasion'.\nReviews and Reception\nThe New York Times gave Battle Cry a mixed review, praising it as the most authentic account of how Marines were trained and how they fought, but noting its conventional approach to character development.\nThe book is listed on the U.S. Marine Corps Commandant's Professional Reading List.\nFilm\nThe film version of this novel was made in 1955, directed by Raoul Walsh and written by Uris. The film stars Van Heflin, Aldo Ray, James Whitmore, Tab Hunter and Fess Parker\nReferences"
