Best known for exploring the avant-garde cinema in depth (especially in the third issue when Mekas originally criticized the 'adolescent' character of American experimental film culture with homophobic overtones and arguing the empty gap between the self-absorbing experimental filmmaking and Hollywood's populism), it also published articles on other aspects of cinema, including Hollywood films.\nArticles from Film Culture are compiled in a book entitled Film Culture Reader, published by Cooper Square Press.\nFilm Culture ceased publication 1996. During its existence the magazine produced 79 issues and issue 80 was published shortly before Mekas’ death in 2019.\nFilm awards\nThe magazine presented awards to independent film makers:\n* First Independent Film Award: John Cassavetes for Shadows (1959)\n* Second Independent Film Award: Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie for Pull My Daisy (1960)\n* Third Independent Film Award: Ricky Leacock, Don Pennebaker, Robert Drew and Al Maysles for Primary (1961)\n* Fourth Independent Film Award: Stan Brakhage for The Dead and Prelude (1962)\n* Fifth Independent Film Award: Jack Smith for Flaming Creatures (1963)\n* Sixth Independent Film Award: Andy Warhol for Sleep, Haircut, Eat, Kiss and Empire (1964)\n* Seventh Independent Film Award: Harry Smith for his entire body of work (1965)\n* Eighth Independent Film Award: Gregory Markopoulos for his entire body of work (1966)\n* Ninth Independent Film Award: Michael Snow for Wavelength (1968)\n* Tenth Independent Film Award: Kenneth Anger for Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969)\nSee also\n*Cinephilia\n*New American Cinema\n*List of American independent films\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.ubu.com/papers/film_culture.html Selections from FILM CULTURE Magazine (1955-1996)] on UbuWeb\n* [https://www.ubu.com/sound/afa.html Jonas Mekas Audio] from Anthology Film Archives on UbuWeb"
