The specific epithet (queenslandica) refers to this most common member of the S. galegifolia – S. greyana group of species in Queensland.\nDistribution and habitat\nThis species of pea grows in a variety of soils in coastal and inland parts of central and south-eastern Queensland and inland areas of north-eastern New South Wales.\nReferences"
