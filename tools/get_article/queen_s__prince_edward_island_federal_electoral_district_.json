It consisted of the County of Queen's and elected two members. In 1914, it was redefined to elect only one member unless the British North America Act, 1867, were amended to entitle the province of Prince Edward Island to four members. When that happened, before the next election, Queen's again was entitled to elect two members. It continued to have two members until it was abolished in 1966. Queen's and the riding of Halifax were the last two multi-member ridings used in Canadian elections.\nIt elected its MPs through Block Voting.\nMembers of Parliament\nThis riding has elected the following members of Parliament:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
