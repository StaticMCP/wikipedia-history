He is currently serving as the Labor Party member for Bundaberg in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, first being elected by a 9-vote margin at the 2020 state election. Despite being the most marginal seat in the state, Smith managed to retain Bundaberg at the 2024 state election with a 1.4% swing in his favour, even as the LNP won majority government and all but wiped Labor out in regional Queensland.\nBefore his election, Smith was a secondary school teacher.\nReferences"
