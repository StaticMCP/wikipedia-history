He was a right-handed batter who bowled occasional leg break. Tiwary represented Bengal in domestic cricket and appeared for multiple Indian Premier League (IPL) franchisees like Delhi Daredevils, Kolkata Knight Riders, Kings XI Punjab and Rising Pune Supergiants across multiple editions of the IPL. He played One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals for the Indian national cricket team. In 2021, he joined All India Trinamool Congress political party and was elected to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly later in the year.\nTiwary reversed his all-format retirement decision on 8 August 2023, less than a week after his initial announcement on 3 August 2023. He stated that he wanted one final attempt at winning the Ranji Trophy title for Bengal in the 2023/24 season.\nInternational career\nTiwary plays as an aggressive right-handed batsman. He made his international debut against Australia in the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series in which he scored only 2 runs in his only innings. He was later included in the India team for the West Indies tour of 2011, as a replacement for Yuvraj Singh, who opted out of the series due to a lung infection. Tiwary played the 4th and 5th ODI in the series. He was later picked for England's tour of India in October. He played in the 5th ODI and scored 24 runs. He also played the only T20 and scored 15 runs. Tiwary was subsequently named in the squad for the ODIs against West Indies in November–December. He played in the 5th ODI at Chennai when India was down by two wickets for only one run in the first over of the match. Tiwary then went on build a solid innings which got him his scoring maiden ODI century (104 not out) despite having cramps and retired soon after getting his century. Eventually India won the match by 34 runs and he was awarded the Man-Of-The-Match for this match-winning knock. Even after the unbeaten century, Tiwary was made to sit in the reserves for 14 successive matches following the century. However, he made an auspicious comeback as an all-rounder replacing leg spinner Rahul Sharma against Sri Lanka at Colombo as he took 4/61 from his 10 overs with his leg-breaks to restrict the hosts to 251/8. He took the wickets of Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis and Thisara Perera, and followed it with a fighting 21 from 38 at a tough time coming at 60/3. India eventually won the match as Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten ton.\nTiwary also was picked for the Commonwealth Bank tri-series against Australia and Sri Lanka, but he didn't play any matches. Manoj Tiwary was again selected in the Indian team for the Asia Cup 2012 where again he didn't play any matches.
