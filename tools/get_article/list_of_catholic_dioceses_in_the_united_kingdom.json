In the island of Ireland, Northern Ireland is a constitutional part of the United Kingdom. No separate episcopal conference exists for Northern Ireland; instead, the Church is part of the hierarchy or episcopal conferences of the Catholic Church in Ireland. There are also a number of Eastern Catholic dioceses in the UK.\nLatin Rite Dioceses\nLatin Rite Dioceses in Great Britain\nWithin the island of Great Britain, the Episcopal Conference of England and Wales has five provinces, subdivided into 22 dioceses; the Episcopal Conference of Scotland has two provinces, subdivided into 8 dioceses.\nEpiscopal Conference of England and Wales\n; Ecclesiastical province of Birmingham\n* Archdiocese of Birmingham\n** Diocese of Clifton\n** Diocese of Shrewsbury\nEcclesiastical province of Cardiff (in Wales; also includes the ceremonial county of Herefordshire in England)\n* Archdiocese of Cardiff\n** Diocese of Menevia\n** Diocese of Wrexham\n; Ecclesiastical province of Liverpool\n* Archdiocese of Liverpool\n** Diocese of Hallam\n** Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle\n** Diocese of Lancaster\n** Diocese of Leeds\n** Diocese of Middlesbrough\n** Diocese of Salford\n; Ecclesiastical province of Southwark\n* Archdiocese of Southwark\n** Diocese of Arundel and Brighton\n** Diocese of Plymouth\n** Diocese of Portsmouth\n; Ecclesiastical province of Westminster\n* Archdiocese of Westminster\n** Diocese of Brentwood\n** Diocese of East Anglia\n** Diocese of Northampton\n** Diocese of Nottingham\nEpiscopal Conference of Scotland\n; Ecclesiastical province of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh\n*Archdiocese of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh\n**Diocese of Aberdeen\n** Diocese of Argyll and the Isles\n** Diocese of Dunkeld\n** Diocese of Galloway\n; Ecclesiastical province of Glasgow\n* Archdiocese of Glasgow\n** Diocese of Motherwell\n** Diocese of Paisley\nLatin Rite Dioceses in Northern Ireland\nThe Catholic dioceses located in Northern Ireland are organised together with those in the Republic of Ireland, as the Catholic Church in Ireland was not divided when civil authority in Ireland was partitioned in the 1920s.
