It was the first important victory of the Russian fleet in its history. It is commemorated in Russia as one of the Days of Military Honour.\nName of the battle\nThe name Gangut is a romanization of Гангут, the Russian cyrillization of Hangöudd, the Swedish name for the Hanko Peninsula. Less common names include the Battle of Hangö (Finnish: Hanko) and Battle of Hangöudd (Finnish: Hankoniemi). The battle took place in Rilax Bay, near Riilahti Manor. In Sweden and Finland, it is known as the Battle of Rilax (Finnish: Riilahti). Some sources refer to it as the Battle of Ahvenanmaa, after Åland, which Russia seized after its victory.\nBackground\nThe Russian Tsar Peter I had begun his offensive in Finland in the spring of 1713. The Russian armies quickly advanced all the way to Åbo (Turku) on the southwestern coast of Finland, and with Russian victory in the Battle of Storkyro (Isokyrö) on 19 February 1714, left southern Finland fully in Russian control. The Russian governor in Finland, Prince Mikhail Galitzine, with his headquarters in Åbo, was unable to receive support by sea, which was then far more important than land-based support as Swedish battle fleet under Admiral Gustav Wattrang had started blockading the coastal sea route past Hanko Peninsula already on 24 April. While it also blockaded the Russian supply route the blockade also prevented the Russian coastal fleet from reaching Sweden and raiding the Swedish coast. First Russian transports left from Helsingfors (Helsinki) in early May but had to stop east of Hanko (Hangö) to Ekenäs from where the supplies needed to be hauled overland. Russian attempts to provide ships to west of Hanko ended when newly formed Swedish coastal squadron led by Captain Anton Wrangel intercepted the Russian supply ships south of Åbo on 10 May and in one sided engagement sunk most of them while the rest were scattered. Admiral Apraksin's fleet was sent from its base at Kronstadt by the Tsar to open these service lines.\nArrival at Hanko\nWhen the 80 ship strong Russian galley fleet arrived near the peninsula on 29 June 1714 they were met by a strong Swedish naval fleet consisting of 16 ships of the line and 7 smaller ships under the command of Admiral Wattrang. Apraksin decided to withdraw his ships farther away to the eastern side of the peninsula and call for reinforcements while he waited for the further 20 galleys to arrive from Helsingfors where they had been over the winter. The majority of the troops in Åbo were moved according to his request to the peninsula.\nA plea for help was also sent to the Tsar, who was with the rest of the Baltic Fleet in Reval (Tallinn). Admiral Apraksin specifically let the Tsar know that he should come personally to lead the attack. A Russian battle fleet of 10 ships of the line and 6 frigates was originally intended to participate in the breakthrough attempt at Hanko but upon inspecting the fleet, the Tsar found it ill-prepared for battle and abandoned the use of the battlefleet. Further, he ordered that the fleet should not engage unless it would have clear superiority in artillery (3:2). Peter I reached the Russian coastal fleet on 20 July.\nBreakthrough\nThe first attempt in breaking through the Swedish lines was made by attempting to pull the galleys over the peninsula. The friction was reduced using ox skins between the ground and the ships. The first galley was successfully pulled over with much trouble, but the second was damaged, and the attempt was subsequently abandoned. However, Admiral Wattrang had been informed of the Russians' attempt, and he sent a small naval detachment consisting of 11 ships led by Schoutbynacht (equivalent of a rear admiral) Nils Ehrenskiöld to intercept the Russians. Swedish efforts forced Russians to abandon their plans few days later.\n, as this 1715 etching testifies]]\nEhrenskiöld's detachment consisted of following ships:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

G. Tornquist is hugely inflated and increased from 127 men killed and 347 wounded, a figure supported by documentary evidence, to 3,000 dead and 1,600 wounded, which is more than the number of Russian sailors engaged in the fighting. Furthermore, despite the Swedish claim that only 60 Russian galleys made their way to Åbo due to severe damage, it is known from wartime sources that all the galleys sailed there on 1 August 1714 in full force. The overall number of Russian galleys was slightly smaller than reported: 98. Krotov also discovered numerous sources mentioning that over the course of the battle 4 Russian “scampavia” gunboats attacked the Swedish ships from the rear.\nRussian galleys were designed differently from Swedish galleys. While carrying generally inferior artillery at two 6-pounder guns per galley, they had a larger crew complement, usually close to 200 men per galley. The Russians substantially outnumbered the Swedish, according to some Swedish sources 15 to one. Russian numbers in the battle were such that there wasn't enough room for all Russian vessels to fight at once, so only 23 vessels engaged.\nConsequences\nWhile the defeat of the small Swedish squadron didn't have much consequences, the fact that over 70 Russian galleys had run the Swedish blockade at Hanko and reached the Archipelago Sea did. The Swedish battlefleet which had been blockading Hanko Peninsula was quickly moved west of Åland to protect Sweden against raids by Russian galleys. This also opened the coastal seaway for the Russian transports. A Russian galley fleet under Admiral Apraksin started from Rilax on 1 August to sail towards Åbo from where he continued already on 5 August towards Åland. By 8 August Apraksin reached the east coast of Åland triggering Swedish withdrawal from the islands. On 13 August whole of Åland was under Russian control. As the Swedish battlefleet prevented Apraksin from reaching Sweden the galleys were diverted to support the Russian army fighting along the coast of Gulf of Bothnia with small squadron plundering and razing the Swedish town of Umeå on 18 September. The Presence of the Russian galley fleet on Bay of Bothnia forced the remnants of the Swedish army in Finland to hastily withdraw to Torne River to avoid getting encircled.\nLegacy\n(1735–39) contains a memorial to the Battle of Gangut.]]\nRussians later embellished the description of the battle of Gangut by reclassifying the oared flat-bottomed gun pram Elefanten into a full sailing frigate.\nThe battle was the first major victory of the Russian galley fleet, and is occasionally as such compared by Russians with the Battle of Poltava.\nThe victory is even nowadays celebrated by the Russian Navy; Russia's Navy Day holiday takes place on the last Sunday of July in commemoration of the battle. The Imperial Navy traditionally had one vessel named Gangut, with its first series of Dreadnought battleships named the Gangut class.\nThe first monument to commemorate the Russian Navy, a wooden cross, was erected on the site in 1869 by Rear Admiral Rimsky-Korsakov, brother of the famous composer, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The wooden cross was replaced by a more permanent stone cross in 1870 by the order of Tsar Alexander II. The memorial is at Riilahti manor in Bromarv, Raseborg, Finland, which is owned by the Aminoff family.\nRelated battles\n* Battle of Grengam (1720) – was fought on the same day six years later and marked the end of Swedish supremacy in the Baltic waters;\n* Battle of Svensksund (1790) – Sweden's most ambitious attempt to regain supremacy in the Baltic.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\nExternal links\n*[http://www.neva.ru/EXPO96/book/chap2-2.html Vyborg and Gangut] in [http://www.neva.ru/EXPO96/book/book-cont.html History of Russian Navy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050901080650/http://www.shiphistory.navy.ru/ History of the Russian Navy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060323012125/http://www.nylbr.fi/fanbararen/pdf/304.pdf Article 'Slaget vid Rilax' in magazine 'Fanbäraren']\n*[https://runeberg.org/nfbg/0025.html Nordisk familjebok, Volume 7 (1907), Column 17, Nils Ehrenschiöld]"
