The name \"Traikutakas\" seems to be derived from the words for a three-peaked mountain (\"Tri-kuta\"). The Traikutakas are mentioned in Kalidasa's Raghuvamsa, in which they are located in the area of northern Kokan. The dominions of the Traikutakas further included Aparanta and northern Maharashtra.\nThe coins of the Traikutaras are found extensively in southern Gujarat, and southern Maharashtra beyond the Ghats. Their design is very close to that of the Western Satraps, from which they probably inherited some territories, and traces of the obverse legend with Greek letters can still be seen.\nHistory\nSome scholars theorize that the Traikutakas were a branch of the Abhiras, and refer to them as the \"Abhira-Traikutakas\". These scholars assume that the Traikutaka records were dated in the so-called Chedi-Kalachuri era, starting in 249 CE. However, later epigraphic discoveries and numismatic evidence contradict this theory, and it is likely that the Traikutakas used the Shaka era.\nIndradutta, Dahrasena & Vyaghrasena were well known kings from this dynasty. King Dahrasena expanded his realm, which soon bordered the Vakataka realm. This led to conflict and the Vakataka king Narendrasena, who with the help of his son & crown prince Prithivishena, probably defeated the Traikutikas, as later king Prithivishena's inscriptions refer to him twice rescuing the \"sunken fortunes of his family\".\nTraikutikas were known for their Vaishnava faith. and Dharasena performed Ashvamedha Yajna too. During the reign of Maharaja Madhyamasena, the kingdom was invaded by the Vakataka king Harishena. The dynasty ended around AD 550, when Vikramasena, the last known king died. The Traikutakas were probably reduced to a vassal status under the Vishnukundins and had to accept Madhavavarman I's authority.\nTraikutaka rulers\nThe following Traikuta rulers are known from the coins and inscriptions of Gupta period-\n* Maharaja Indradatta (AD 415-440, only mentioned on the coins of his son)\n* Maharaja Dahrasena, son of Indradatta (A.D. 455), he performed Ashwamedha\n* Maharaja Vyaghrasena, son of Dahrasena (A.D. 480)\n* Maharaja Madhyamasena, son of Vyaghrasena (A.D. 504)\n* Vikramasena, son of Madhyamasena (A.D. 533)\nFurther reading\n*\n*\n*\nSee also\n* Kalchuri Era\n* Abhira\n* Konkan\nReferences\nReferences\n* \"A catalogue of the Indian coins in the British Museum.
