This timeline is also based on (and of course partly overlapping with) the  timeline of aviation, but focuses specifically on the transport of cargo or freight within air transport as an overall mode of transport. All texts in the diagram are clickable links to other Wikipedia articles, where further information and references can be found.\nA few historical developments are reflected in the timeline:\nAirmail vs Air cargo\nAlthough airmail has a special legal and regulatory status under postal frameworks - governed by Universal Postal Union (UPU) regulations for postal operators and designated postal carriers - it is typically treated today as a subset of air cargo, which refers to all property transported by aircraft (excluding baggage). In the early decades of aviation, the carriage of mail was one of the primary drivers of air transport infrastructure, aircraft development, and contracted air services. However, from the late 1960's, growth in non-postal freight (parcels, industrial goods, supplies) increased rapidly, aided by larger aircraft and extended route networks, reducing the dominance of mail in overall air freight volumes and value. In the early 21st century, the boom in e-commerce and express parcel delivery has driven strong growth in small parcels and mail-like shipments, which has further blurred the distinction between traditional postal mail and commercial air freight parcels.\nCivil vs Military\nCivil and military air cargo operations have historically influenced one another in a reciprocal manner. Technological advancements and innovations originating in military contexts—particularly during periods of conflict—have frequently been adapted for civilian use. Conversely, developments in civil aviation and logistics often serve as foundational technologies for subsequent military applications. This is also applicable for the domains of aviation, logistics and air cargo, where shared infrastructure, dual-use technologies, and evolving operational practices reflect the ongoing exchange between civil and military sectors.\nGrowing towards maturity\nBeing relatively young interconnected industries, the aviation, airline, airmail and air cargo industries needed the largest part of the 20th century time to land in a more mature legal and business representation structure after pioneering through a number of incidents, scandals and failures.\nTimeline\nImageSize  = width:500 height:2000\nPlotArea   = left:50 right:0 bottom:10 top:10\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1780 till:2025\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical order:reverse\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:1880\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:5 start:1880\nPlotData=\nColor:red mark:(line,blue) align:left fontsize:S\nshift:(15,-3) # shift text to right side of bar\n# there is no automatic collision detection, fontsize:XS\n# so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap shift:(25,-10)\nat:1783 text: 1st untethered manned hot air balloon flight (France)\nat:1784 text: 1st steerable dirigible hot air balloon flight (France)\nat:1785 text: 1st mail to be carried by an air vehicle (hot air balloon)\nat:1799 text: 1st concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine (U.K.)\nat:1804 text: 1st successful model hangglider flight (U.K.)\nat:1848 text: 1st powered propeller driven unmanned airplane flight (U.K.)\nat:1853 text: 1st towed, controlled, manned glider flight (U.K.)\nat:1859 text: 1st delivery of airmail in the United States (hot air balloon)\nat:1874 text: General Postal Union (GPU) is established, later becoming Universal Postal Union (UPU)\nat:1884 text: 1st powered, propeller driven, fully controllable flight of a non-rigid airship (France)\nat:1885 text: 1st successful partly controllable manned glider flights (U.S.)\nat:1889 text: large secured fixed wing aircraft with two powered propellers lifts from ground (U.K.)\nat:1890 text: fixed wing aircraft with powered propeller lifts from ground (France)\nat:1891 text: 1st repeated controlled manned hangglider flights (Germany)\nat:1900 text: 1st rigid airship flight (Zeppelin, Germany)\nat:1903 text: 1st sustained flight by a manned heavier-than-air powered and controlled airplane (U.S.)\nat:1910 text: 1st commercial air cargo flight by airplane (U.S.)\nat:1911 text: 1st (scheduled) airmail flight  by airplane (India, U.K.); 1st cargo charter flight by airplane (U.K.)\nfrom:1914 till: 1918 text: ---> World War I\nat:1915 text: 1st air supply operation in history (during the Siege of Kut, 1916)\nat:1917 text: 1st airmail stamp (Italy)\nat:1918 text: 1st military and civilian scheduled international airmail services\nat:1920 text: 1st airmail service established officially by an airline (Colombia)\nat:1921 text: 1st air traffic control (ATC) at an airport (Croydon, U.K., 1920)\nat:1922 text: 1st airway beacon / lighthouse networks are built for visual navigation in Europe and U.S.\nat:1925 text: U.S. Air Mail Act of 1925 (Kelly Act)\nat:1926 text: International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) is founded\nat:1927 text: U.S. Air Commerce Act (Watres Act, 1926)\nat:1928 text: the Universal Postal Union adopts comprehensive rules for airmail (1929)\nat:1929 text: Warsaw Convention\nat:1930 text: U.S. Air Mail Act of 1930 (McNary-Watres Act)\nat:1931 text: Low Frequency Radio Range system (LFR) begins to replace the visual Air Beacon system (as of 1929)\nat:1933 text: British Empire Airmail Scheme is conceived (1934)\nat:1934 text: airmail scandal in the U.S. ;\nat:1935 text: U.S. Air Mail Act of 1934 (Black-McKellar bill) ; 1st air route traffic control center (U.S.)\nat:1936 text: 1st large military supply airlift (Spain)\nfrom:1940 till: 1945 text: ---> World War II\nat:1941 text: large military supply airlifts a.o.
