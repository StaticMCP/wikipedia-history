He was appointed by the second Caliph, Umar ibn al-Khattab, to march on Sindh. Which led to the expansion of Muslim rule into the Indian subcontinent.\nConquest of Kaikan\nThe Arabs called the Jats (Zutt) of Qiqan the Qiqaniyya. Many Qiqani Zutts had been taken captive between 659 and 664 by al-Abdi to Iraq, who was appointed as the governor of the regions surrounding Sindh.\nConquests and administration\nAbdi's military prowess was evident in his successful campaigns in the region of Kalat, where he was martyred in battle. His conquests laid the foundation for further Muslim expansion into the Sindh and Makran areas. After his death, Sinan bin Salamah al-Hazli continued his mission and succeeded in bringing the territory under Muslim control.\nDeath\nEmir Abd Allah ibn Amir, or the Caliph Mu'awiya I himself, is said to have sent al-Abdi to Sindh to Kaikan. Where he is said to have fought and captured some spoils, but is said to have been killed by the jats in there.\nSee also\n* Harith ibn Murrah al-Abdi\nReferences"
