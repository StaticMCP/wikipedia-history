LV is a duo of Si Williams and Will Horrocks, who met when they were both studying at University College London. Critics said that Tigran and LV did not gel well together, leaving the music sounding disjointed. LV and Tigran first met when they were performing at a Maida Vale session in 2012 for Gilles Peterson's final BBC Radio 1 show.\nTrack listing\nReferences"
