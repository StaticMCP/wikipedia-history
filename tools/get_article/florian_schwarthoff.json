Schwarthoff had his best season in 1995 when set a new German record of 13.05 sec. in Bremen. He was expected to compete for a silver or bronze medal at the World Championships in Gothenburg behind the overwhelming favourite Allen Johnson from the United States. However, Schwarthoff did not finish the semi-final as he fell over a hurdle. Schwarthoff remained for several years a world class hurdler but never won a gold medal.\nPersonal bests\n*100 metres - 10.57 (1996)\n*200 metres - 20.86 (1991)\n*110 metres hurdles - 13.05 (1995) - German record\n*Long jump - 7.69 (1986)\nAchievements\n{|\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Representing\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1987\n|European Junior Championships\n|Birmingham, United Kingdom\n|bgcolor=silver|2nd\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.81\n|-\n|World Championships\n|Rome, Italy\n|15th (sf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.98\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1988\n|European Indoor Championships\n|Budapest, Hungary\n|5th\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.77\n|-\n|Olympic Games\n|Seoul, South Korea\n|17th (qf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.67\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1989\n|European Indoor Championships\n|The Hague, Netherlands\n|6th\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.72\n|-\n|Universiade\n||Duisburg, West Germany\n|bgcolor=CC9966 | 3rd\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.63\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1990\n|European Indoor Championships\n|Glasgow, United Kingdom\n|bgcolor=CC9966 | 3rd\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.61\n|-\n|European Championships\n|Split, Yugoslavia\n|8th (sf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.59\n|-\n!colspan=\"6\"|Representing\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1991\n|rowspan=2|World Championships\n|rowspan=2|Tokyo, Japan\n|7th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.41\n|-\n| –\n|4 × 100 m relay\n|DQ\n|-\n|1992\n|Olympic Games\n|Barcelona, Spain\n|5th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.29\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1993\n|World Indoor Championships\n|Toronto, Canada\n|4th\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.54\n|-\n|World Championships\n|Stuttgart, Germany\n|5th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.27\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1994\n|European Championships\n|Helsinki, Finland\n|bgcolor=\"silver\" | 2nd\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.16\n|-\n|World Cup\n|London, United Kingdom\n|4th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.47\n|-\n|1995\n|World Championships\n|Gothenburg, Sweden\n|2nd (qf)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.24\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1996\n|rowspan=2|Olympic Games\n|rowspan=2|Atlanta, United States\n|bgcolor=CC9966 | 3rd\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.17\n|-\n|3rd (h)\n|4 × 100 m relay\n|38.77\n|-\n|1997\n|World Championships\n|Athens, Greece\n|4th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.20\n|-\n|1998\n|European Championships\n|Budapest, Hungary\n|4th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.23\n|-\n|1999\n|World Championships\n|Seville, Spain\n|7th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.39\n|-\n|2000\n|Olympic Games\n|Sydney, Australia\n|6th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.42\n|-\n|2001\n|World Championships\n|Edmonton, Canada\n|11th (h)\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.58\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2002\n|European Indoor Championships\n|Vienna, Austria\n|4th\n|60 m hurdles\n|7.59\n|-\n|European Championships\n|Munich, Germany\n|4th\n|110 m hurdles\n|13.37\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*\n*"
