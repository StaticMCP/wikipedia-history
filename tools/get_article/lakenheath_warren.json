It is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I, and part of Breckland Special Area of Conservation and Breckland Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. The RAF Lakenheath base is located nearby.\nThis is the largest remaining area of heath in the Breckland, and it has a history of use for sheep grazing and as a rabbit warren from the thirteenth century, and continuing until the Second World War. There are several rare lichens and plants, and over fifty species of breeding birds.\nPart of the site is common land with a right of public access.\nHistory\nThe most important use of the Warren, dating back to at least the 14th-century, was keeping rabbits. During the 18th century, it is estimated that the rabbit population was 15 per acre. During the 19th century, the rabbit population decreased as the Warren became increasingly popular as a game reserve.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x37645 Lakenheath Warren excavated artifacts] in the British Museum\n* [https://heritage.suffolk.gov.uk/Monument/MSF17748 Monument record LKH 174-Lakenheath Rabbit Warren]"
