The structure was demolished in 2015 to make way for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia expansion.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\nHistory and architectural features\nBuilt by the United States Marine Corps in two sections in 1941 and in 1943, this historic structure was a six-story, orange brick building that was designed in the Moderne style. A one-story, brick addition was built circa 1970. The warehouse has an off-center tower over the entrance, unornamented parapet and flat roof, long bands of steel windows, and wide loading bays separated by rounded concrete columns. Occupied by the U.S. Marine Corps into the 1960s, it was subsequently used as a vocational training facility, the John F. Kennedy Vocational Center, by the School District of Philadelphia into the 1980s, and then used for administrative offices and storage.\nIt was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\nReferences"
