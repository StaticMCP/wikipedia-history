The songs were released on February 25, 2021, as the second joint single for the band's 11th album, Bodies.\nBackground\nAFI guitarist, Jade Puget, revealed that the band had completed writing Bodies in April 2020, but that they had chosen to push back the release due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shortly after its release, the band detailed the meaning of \"Looking Tragic\" on their Twitter account with a quote from the band's frontman, Davey Havok:\"Looking Tragic\" addresses the theme of overstimulation resulting in desensitization. Melodic and driving, the song came to life quickly and immediately stood out as a track to make bodies, if not sentiments, move.Additionally, drummer, Adam Carson, gave details on the writing process for \"Begging for Trouble\":After years of receiving early versions of songs from Jade and Davey, in forms that span loosely arranged chords and scratch vocal to fully realised demos, I think I have become quite adept at knowing which songs will or will not make the record. \"Begging for Trouble\" was greenlit, at least in my mind, the moment I heard the vocals come in. To me, the track is a cornerstone of the new record.\nRelease and reception\nAFI began to tease new music the day before the single came out. The single was announced alongside both the release date for Bodies, and a new music video for \"Looking Tragic\". The video shows the band playing the song in a vibrantly colored room while continuously being covered in multicolored streamers.\nTrack listing\n* Digital download\n# \"Looking Tragic\" – 2:37\n# \"Begging for Trouble\" – 2:20\nPersonnel\nAFI\n* Davey Havok – vocals, songwriting\n* Jade Puget – guitar, songwriting, producer\n* Hunter Burgan – bass guitar, songwriting\n* Adam Carson – drums, songwriting\nProduction\n* Jeremy Lubsey – assistant mastering\n* Mike Fasano – instrument technician\n* Paul Fig – mixing\n* Tony Hoffer – mixing\n* Vlado Meller – mixing\nReferences"
