He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, and was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round of the 2017 NFL draft. He was also a member of the Buffalo Bills, Houston Texans, and Las Vegas Raiders.\nEarly life\nHoward attended Autauga Academy in Prattville, Alabama.\nHoward was rated by Rivals.com and Scout.com as a five-star recruit and was ranked by both as the best tight end in his class. He committed to the University of Alabama to play college football.\nCollege career\nAs a true freshman at Alabama in 2013, Howard played in 13 games with five starts. He made his collegiate debut with three receptions for 68 yards in a victory over Texas A&M. On October 19, against Arkansas, he scored his first collegiate touchdown. In his next game, a victory over LSU, he had a 52-yard receiving touchdown. He finished the year with 14 receptions for 269 yards and two touchdowns. As a sophomore in 2014, he had 17 receptions for 260 yards. His best performance of the season was when he had three receptions for 81 yards in a loss to Ole Miss. As a junior in 2015, Howard had 38 receptions for 602 yards and 2 touchdowns.  He was the Offensive MVP of Alabama's victory over Clemson in the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship after recording five receptions for 208 yards and two touchdowns. As a senior in 2016, he had 45 receptions for 595 yards and three touchdowns. His best performance of the season came in the National Championship rematch against Clemson. In the 35–31 loss, he had four receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown.\nHoward was considered by some to be underutilized in the Crimson Tide offense despite back to back seasons recording the most receptions ever for a tight end under Saban at Alabama. When asked about Howard's role in the offense after the 2016 season, Saban said, \"O.J., quite honestly, should have been more involved all year long.\"\nHoward played for the South team in the 2017 Senior Bowl. He has stated that he tries to model his play off of Jason Witten, Jimmy Graham, and Jordan Reed.\nCollege statistics\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"\"| Season !! style=\"\"| Team !! style=\"\"| GP !! style=\"\"| Rec !! style=\"\"| Yds !! style=\"\"| Avg !! style=\"\"| TD\n|-\n! 2013 || Alabama\n| 10 || 14 || 269 || 19.2 || 2\n|-\n! 2014 || Alabama\n| 9 || 17 || 260 || 15.3 || 0\n|-\n! 2015 || Alabama\n| 12 || 38 || 602 || 15.8 || 2\n|-\n! 2016 || Alabama\n| 15 || 45 || 595 || 13.2 || 3\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| [https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/oj-howard-1.html Total] !! 46 !! 114 !! 1,726 !! 15.1 !! 7\n|}\nProfessional career\nPre-draft\nComing out of college, Howard was projected as a first round pick by the majority of NFL experts and scouts.
