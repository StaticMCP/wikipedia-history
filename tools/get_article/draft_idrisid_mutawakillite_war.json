The Emirate maintained its autonomy along the Red Sea coast while navigating complex relations with the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, the Ottoman Empire, and neighboring tribal confederations.\nAfter the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen sought to consolidate power over the western highlands and the Tihama coastal region, areas historically contested with Asir. Saudi Arabia, then the Sultanate of Nejd, maintained influence in Asir and supported local rulers opposed to Imam Yahya's expansion. Meanwhile, British forces in Aden observed closely due to their interests in the Red Sea and South Arabian trade routes.\nConflict\nIn 1925, Imam Yahya launched an offensive to extend Yemeni control into Asir-held territories, beginning with a campaign through the Tihama plains and toward the city of Al Hudaydah. Emir al-Idrisi responded by mobilizing local tribes and fortifying his strongholds in Jizan and Sabya, receiving limited aid from Nejd.\nTribal alliances were fluid throughout the war. Some groups in the lowlands cooperated with the Yemeni army, while others resisted under Idrisid leadership. Sporadic clashes occurred across the rugged borderlands, but neither side achieved a decisive victory. Yemeni forces temporarily gained influence over coastal territories but faced logistical difficulties in maintaining control.\nAftermath\nThe 1925 campaign weakened the Idrisid Emirate's independence and set the stage for greater Saudi involvement in Asir's affairs. Continued pressure from both Yemen and Nejd led to Asir's gradual absorption into the expanding Saudi state by 1930.\nEventually, territorial disputes between Yemen and Saudi Arabia culminated in the Treaty of Taif (1934), which confirmed Saudi control of Asir, Jizan, and Najran, while Yemen retained sovereignty over its northern highlands. Despite Yemen's military initiative in 1925, the shifting alliances and the rise of Ibn Saud's power fundamentally changed the balance in Arabia.\nLegacy\nThe conflict marked one of the last attempts by the Mutawakkilite Kingdom to expand its influence before Saudi unification. It also reflected the transitional nature of Arabian politics in the 1920s, where tribal allegiances, colonial influence, and emerging state powers converged.\nThe 1925 war remains an important event in understanding early 20th-century Yemeni–Saudi relations and the shaping of modern borders in the Arabian Peninsula.\nSee also\n* Emirate of Asir\n* Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen\n* Treaty of Taif\n* Saudi–Yemeni War (1934)\n* History of Saudi Arabia\nReferences"
