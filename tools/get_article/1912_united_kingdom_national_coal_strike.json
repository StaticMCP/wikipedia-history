Its main goal was securing a minimum wage. After 37 days, the government intervened and ended the strike by passing the Coal Mines Act, extending minimum wage provisions to the mining industry and certain other industries with many manual jobs.\nThe dispute centred upon an attempt by the Miners Federation of Great Britain, the main trade union representing coal miners, to secure a minimum wage for miners in their district and replace the complicated wage structure then in place which often made it difficult for a miner to earn a fair day's wage. The same issues had caused a major dispute the previous year in South Wales and had become a national issue. The strike was a repeat of the unsuccessful strike of 1894 which also sought a minimum wage.\nThe strike began at the end of February in Alfreton, Derbyshire and spread nationwide. Nearly one million miners took part. It ended on 6 April after 37 days. The strike caused considerable disruption to train and shipping schedules. depicting a miner emerging out of the earth with a pick axe and head seeking the light up.\n(in reference to coal strikes of 1912 in the US and UK) |274x274px|center]]\nSee also\n* West Virginia coal wars & strikes (1912–1921)\n* 1926 United Kingdom general strike\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Sires, Ronald V. \"Labor Unrest in England, 1910–1914.\" Journal of Economic History 15.3 (1955): 246–266.
