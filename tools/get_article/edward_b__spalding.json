By April 6, 1862, he was serving as a sergeant in Company E of the 52nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. On that day, at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, during the Battle of Shiloh, he was severely wounded but continued to fight for the remainder of the battle. For this action, he was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on January 15, 1894.\nSpalding's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\nAlthough twice wounded, and thereby crippled for life, he remained fighting in open ground to the close of the battle.\nSpalding died on March 4, 1920, at age 80 and was buried at Floyd Cemetery in Sioux City, Iowa.\n}}\nExternal links\n*"
