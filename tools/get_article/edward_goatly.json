Goatly was a middle-order, right-handed batter and an occasional left-arm spin bowler.\nGoatly's obituary in ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' explains that despite a 14-season first-class cricket career, he was only occasionally a regular in Surrey's first team: \"A very sound if unattractive batsman,\" it stated, \"he was too slow in the field to command a regular place.\" He played in 23 matches in the 1913 season, making 884 runs at an average of 23.26. In 22 matches in 1911, he scored 883 runs at an average of 30.44 runs per innings.\nSee also\n* List of Surrey County Cricket Club players\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
