      "text": "# The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas During the English Revolution\n\nThe World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas During the English Revolution is a book by the British historian Christopher Hill, published in 1972 and republished many times since.  It offers a \"history from below\" perspective on the English Civil Wars focussing on the ordinary people that participated in radical religious groups such as the Diggers, the Seekers, the Ranters, the Quakers and the Levellers.\nBhogal & Haydon (2017) in their book .''An Analysis of Christopher Hill's The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas During the English Revolution'' argue that Hill has inspired and influenced a whole generation of historians in the study of the English Revolution and the approach to be taken. They argue that Hill argues that to be able to understand what the Revolution was really like we need to understand intellectual currents which lay behind many of the actions taken and this is what he provides.\nContents\nPreface\n# Introduction\n# The Parchment and the Fire\n# Masterless Men\n# Agitators and Officers\n# The North and West\n# A Nation of Prophets\n# Levellers and True Levellers\n# Sin and Hell\n# Seekers and Ranters\n# Ranters and Quakers\n# Samuel Fisher and the Bible\n# John Warr and the Law\n# The Island of Great Bedlam\n# Mechanic Preachers and the Mechanical Philosophy\n# Base Impudent Kisses\n# Life Against Death\n# The World Restored\n# Conclusion\nAppendices:\n# Hobbes and Winstanley: Reason and Politics\n# Milton and Bunyan: Dialogue with the Radicals\nReviews\n* Bhogal, H., & Haydon, L.
