The renaming allows for Hip Hop DJs to enter their albums in addition to Rap residing in this category.\n*Best African Adult has changed to Best African Adult Contemporary Album. The category does not carry language exclusion.\n*Best Africa Artist has changed to Best African Artist. This has also been made a special category so that South African artists can enter their works and compete for the bragging rights of being named the best artist in the African continent.\nControversy\nIn April 2018, The Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA) announced that the artist Sands' entry for Record of the Year, \"Tigi\", had been struck off the nominees' list because Sands was a citizen of Eswatini. Mobi Dixon's nomination for Best Remix of the song, \"Lake by the Ocean\", had also been disqualified because it was a remix of an international song which was a contravention of the SAMA rules. \"Tigi\" by Sands was replaced by \"Love Me in the Dark\", by Sketchy Bongo on the nominations list. In the place of \"Lake by the Ocean\" by Mobi Dixon was the remixed song, which \"Mwanangu\" by Jackie Queens and VeneiGrette, remixed by Enoo Napa.\nReferences"
