Washington National Monument is a National Monument near the community of Hardy, Virginia, and is located entirely in rural Franklin County, Virginia.  It preserves portions of the 207-acre (0.90&nbsp;km2) tobacco farm on which educator and leader Booker T. Washington was born into slavery on April 5, 1856.  It provides interpretation of Washington's life and achievements, as well as interpretation of 1850s slavery and farming through the use of buildings, gardens, crafts and animals.\nCongress authorized the Booker T. Washington Memorial half dollar to fund the purchase of the site. This commemorative half dollar was the first US coin to feature an African American, and was minted from 1946 to 1951 at three different mints. 18 varieties of the coin were produced, and more than 1.5 million were sold (primarily to collectors). Yet, after the coin's production was finished, the BTW Commission owed more money than it had assets, and the Commonwealth of Virginia had to step in to provide funds to purchase the site.\nThe site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 and designated a National Monument on April 2, 1956.\nSee also\n*Hale's Ford, Virginia\n*Tuskegee University\n*List of national monuments of the United States\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n* [https://www.nps.gov/bowa/index.htm Booker T.
