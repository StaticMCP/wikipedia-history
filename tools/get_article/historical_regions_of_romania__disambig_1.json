Romania came into being through the unification of two principalities, Wallachia and Moldova in 1862. The new unitary state extended over further regions at various times during the late 19th and 20th centuries, including Dobruja in 1878, and Transylvania in 1918.\nThese regions are part of Romania today:\n35px Wallachia (united with Moldavia in 1859 to create modern Romania):\n*20px Muntenia (Greater Wallachia);\n*20px Oltenia (Lesser Wallachia): the territory between the rivers Danube and Olt and the Southern Carpathians became part of the Principality of Wallachia in the early 14th century.\n35px Moldavia (united with Wallachia in 1859 to create modern Romania):\n*20px Western Moldavia: in today's form part of Romania since 1944;\n*20px Southern Bukovina: following the union with Romania in 1918 (initially, the entire region of Bukovina was part of Romania, until World War II).\n35px Dobruja:\n*20px Northern Dobruja: in Romania since 1878 (with the exception of some Danubian islands and Snake Island, which were incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1948, and became part of Ukraine in 1991).\nWallachia, western Moldova, and Dobruja are sometimes referred collectively as the Regat (The Kingdom), as they formed the Romanian \"Old\" Kingdom before World War I.\n35px Transylvania (the term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also part of the historical regions of Crișana, Maramureș, and Banat. The new borders were set by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 between the respective states):\n* Transylvania proper: following the declaration of the union with Romania in 1918;\n*20px Banat: since 1918 claimed and eventually divided between Romania, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (today Serbia) and Hungary;\n*20px Crișana: the region bordered by the rivers Mureș and Someș and the Apuseni Mountains, following the declaration of the union in 1918, eventually divided between Hungary and Romania;\n*20px Maramureș: part of the mountainous northwestern region,  following the declaration of the union in 1918, eventually divided between Czechoslovakia and Romania (today, Northern Maramureș is part of Ukraine).\nBetween 1918 and 1920, during the Revolutions and interventions in Hungary, the Hungarian–Romanian War affected also part of these territories until the final resolution of state affairs by the Paris Peace Conference.\nThese regions and territories were part of Romania in the past:\n*20px Bessarabia: this territory was part (as the eastern half) of Moldova until 1812, when it was incorporated into the Russian Empire.
