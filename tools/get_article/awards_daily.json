Originally called Oscarwatch, it was launched as a website covering the race for the Academy Awards from start to finish. It was later expanded to include a television coverage section as well. In addition, the site also features movie trailers, film scripts, previews of upcoming movies and interviews. In 2006, it was renamed Awards Daily after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences sued Stone for copyright infringement due to the use of Oscarwatch as the site's name for eight years prior.\nAwards Daily started holding an annual poll that recognizes excellence in both American and international film and television. The winners are chosen by the National Film Critics Circle, which comprises more than 100 film critics nationwide, and are generally announced during the first half of the year. In October 2010, Awards Daily launched a weekly podcast called Oscar Poker. Guests have included Fran Walsh, Peter Berg, Sarah Paulson, and Rachel Weisz.\nSince its founding, Awards Daily has received a Shorty Award nomination. It has been used as a source on NPR's Weekend Edition and regularly collaborates with the awards prediction website Gold Derby. It was profiled by Boris Kachka in New York Magazine about the growing industry of Oscar punditry, which Awards Daily helped launch.\nIn 2024, three contributors to Awards Daily left the website to found a new site named The Contenders, in response to Stone's shift in political views toward supporting Donald Trump.\nSee also\n* Gold Derby\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
