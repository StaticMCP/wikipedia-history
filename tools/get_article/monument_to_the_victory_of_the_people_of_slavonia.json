It was destroyed by the Armed Forces of Croatia in 1992.\nHistory\nIt was built over a decade, from 1957 to 1968. At the time of its opening it was the largest postmodern sculpture in the world. It was dedicated to the people of Slavonia during World War II and made of stainless steel. The opening ceremony was performed on 9 November 1968 and attended by Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito.\nDemolition\nDuring the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1991, the works of Vojin Bakić were on the \"list\" for monuments to be demolished. In 1992, an unprecedented culturicide occurred when, according to eyewitnesses, the commander of the 123rd Brigade of the Croatian Army, Major Miljenko Crnjac, ordered the demolition of the monument on February 21. The monument was completely demolished only after the ninth attempt with further explosives.\nSee also\n*List of Yugoslav World War II monuments and memorials in Croatia\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.spomenikdatabase.org/kamenska Spomenik Database - Kamenska Monument] educational & historical resource"
