The team was founded in November 2015, and began its first season in May 2016. The team's usual home is Dietz Stadium in Kingston, the team played the 2023 season at Tenney Stadium in Poughkeepsie due to ongoing renovations at Dietz.\nThe team plays in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), a national semi-professional league at the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid.

Dan Hoffay and Nick Hoffay were named the club's lead scouts.\nIn January 2017, management announced that David Lindholm, a coach for Bard College's soccer team, would replace Vizvary as the new head of the coaching staff. In February of the same year, Lindholm announced his coaching staff. Rory Becker and Charles Wilder will continue as assistant coach and goalkeeper coach respectively. Newcomer Ben Walsh will serve as a second assistant coach to Lindholm.\nThe team is named after the stockade fortification that protected the original Dutch settlement of Kingston back in the 1600s. Dietz Stadium is a short walk from the historic Kingston Stockade District. The stockade fortification is also referenced in the team's crest. The name of the team's first supporters group, Dutch Guard, is also a reference to this historical period.\nIn its second season, the team qualified for its first playoff match finishing at the top of the table. It played in the conference final against Hartford City FC on July 15. After regular time, the score was 1–1, and the game went into overtime. Michael Creswick scored the winning goal in the 94th minute, giving Stockade its first ever conference championship. On May 9, 2018, it played its first U.S. Open Cup game against the Long Island Rough Riders losing 6–3.
