It marked the first dynastic fusion between the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi and the Imperial Cholas of Tamilakam, resulting in a combined rule over parts of present-day Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.\nOrigin\nThe dynasty was founded by Kulothunga Chola I, son of Rajaraja Narendra (Eastern Chalukya prince) and Ammanga Devi (a Chola princess). His succession through his mother’s Chola lineage marked the first time in South Indian history that an emperor inherited power matrilineally.\nPolitical Role\nThe Chalukya-Cholas ruled Andhra Desa by inheriting the Samantha system, a feudatory administrative structure. Though they retained nominal supremacy, several of their feudatories—such as the Velanati Cholas, Kondapadumatis, and Kona Haihayas—exercised considerable autonomy.\nThey engaged in major campaigns, including the repulsion of Western Chalukya invasions and expeditions in Kalinga. The Battle of the Godavari was a key event that elevated loyal feudatories to powerful regional roles.\nMajor Feudatories\n* Velanati Cholas (c. 1100–1300 CE): Based in Chandavolu (modern Guntur district), they defended Vengi against invasions and gradually gained near independence.\n* Kondapadumatis (c. 1100–1282 CE): Feudatories who ruled from Nadendla and served under both Eastern Chalukyas and Chalukya-Cholas. They held alliances with the Velanati Cholas.\n* Kona Haihayas, Chagis, and others: These families ruled regions such as Palnadu, the Godavari delta, and Vinukonda, and often claimed descent from Durjaya.\nDecline\nBy the end of the 12th century, central authority weakened. Many feudatories omitted Chalukya-Chola kings’ names from inscriptions, signaling growing independence. The Kakatiya dynasty later absorbed many of these regions during its rise.\nLegacy\nThe Chalukya-Chola era was one of political hybridization and decentralization. It bridged two major dynastic traditions and laid foundations for successor states such as the Kakatiyas, who inherited administrative systems and territorial alignments from the Chalukya-Cholas.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n* Krishna Kumari, M.
