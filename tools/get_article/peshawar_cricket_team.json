The team's home ground is Arbab Niaz Stadium, Peshawar. They participate in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. It was refounded in the 2023/24 season after a revamp of the domestic structure.\nHistory\nBefore 2023\nThe List A and Twenty20 side was known as the Peshawar Panthers.\nPeshawar first played in first-class competitions in 1956–57, and they have competed in most seasons since then, except for a hiatus between 1977–78 and 1983–84. Apart from a few matches played by North-West Frontier Province in the 1970s, Peshawar were usually the only first-class team from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (formerly known as North-West Frontier Province) until the debut of Abbottabad in 2005–06.\nPeshawar won the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy in 1998-99 and 2004–05 and the ABN-AMRO Cup National One-day Championship in 2006–07. They also won the 2011-12 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Division Two.\nIn first-class cricket to the end of 2013 they had played 262 matches, with 82 wins, 99 losses, 80 draws and one tie. Their highest individual score is 300 not out, by Shoaib Khan against Quetta in 2003–04. Their best bowling figures are 9 for 62 by Safiullah Khan against Railways B in 1971–72.\nIn List A cricket they have played 73 times, with 22 wins, 49 losses, one tie and one no-result.\nIn January 2017, they won the 2016–17 Regional One Day Cup, beating Karachi Whites by 124 runs in the final.\nSince 2023\nIn 2023, the Peshawar cricket team was refounded as part of the restructuring of the Pakistani domestic system.\nCurrent squad\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.
