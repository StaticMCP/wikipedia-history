It is a subtype of transphonologization.\nExamples\nOne of the most common examples of unpacking is the separation of nasal vowels into sequences of a vowel and a nasal consonant when are borrowed into languages that do not have nasal vowels. That can be seen in English borrowings of French and Portuguese words like monsoon  from Portuguese  ; likewise, Lingala  reflects French  \"balance\". In such examples, the nasality of the vowel is separated out as a nasal consonant; otherwise, the nasality would be lost.\nUnpacking occurs also as a sound change within the same language. For example, Classical Armenian changed the Proto-Indo European syllabic sonorants *m̥, *n̥, *r̥, and *l̥ to am, an, ar, and al: this kept the syllabic nature of the sound, while preserving the consonant value. Thus, the privative prefix *n̥- became  , and the word *mr̥tos became  .\nSee also\n* Fusion, the opposite of unpacking\n* Vowel breaking\n* Transphonologization\nReferences\n*Crowley, Terry.
