The awards, presented annually since 1962, recognize individual general aviation professionals on the local, and national levels for their contributions to aviation, education, and flight safety.\nThe General Aviation Awards Program is administered by volunteer members of  General Aviation Awards, Inc., a nonprofit organization. Awards are presented to professionals in the following fields:\n# Certificated Flight Instructor\n# Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT)\n# FAASTeam Representative\nCandidates are selected based on long-term performance, specific accomplishments and contributions in their specific fields.\nDistrict award winners are chosen by industry peers at the more than 100 FAA  Flight Standards District Offices (FSDOs) located throughout the United States. Regional award winners are then chosen from among these and announced by representatives of the nine FAA Regional Offices.  In July of each year, the three national award recipients are honored in a ceremony at EAA AirVenture in Oshkosh, Wisconsin; traditionally, the awards are presented by the  FAA Administrator.\nSee also\n* List of aviation awards\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://www.generalaviationawards.org General Aviation Awards website]\n* [http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/awards/ FAA-sponsored award programs]\n* [http://www.generalaviationawards.com/2019-general-aviation-award-winners/ 2019 award winners]\n* [http://www.generalaviationawards.com/donate-sponsor/ how to donate/sponsor]\n* [http://www.generalaviationawards.com/sponsors/ 2019 Sponsors]\n* [http://www.generalaviationawards.com/news/ 2020 Award Winners]\n* [http://www.generalaviationawards.com/gaalive/ Honorees Live Broadcasts at FAASafety.gov]"
