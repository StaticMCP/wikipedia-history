On March 23, the troops led by Generals Rafaél de Echagüe y Bermingham, Antonio Ros de Olano and Juan Prim defeated the Moroccan forces in the valley of Wad-Ras. The military defeat dispersed the irregular Moroccan forces and led to the immediate request for talks to arrange peace.\nThe peace was signed in Tetouan on April 26, 1860 by the Treaty of Wad-Ras between Spain and Morocco, represented by O'Donnell and Muley el-Abbás (brother of the Sultan). Through this treaty, Spain enlarged the limits of Ceuta and annexed Sidi Ifni.\nAftermath\nFollowing the successive defeats suffered by Morocco in its confrontations against Spanish troops and in particular after the Battle of Wad Ras, Sultan Muhammad IV of Morocco was forced to ask for peace from Queen Isabella II of Spain through the Treaty of Wad Ras, signed in Tetouan on 26 April 1860.\nThe Museo del Prado has an oil painting on cardboard measuring 54 by 182 cm, depicting the battle of Wad-Ras, made by Mariano Fortuny, who was commissioned by the Provincial Council of Barcelona to immortalize for posterity the feat of the Spanish army, made up in part of the sons of Barcelona. The National Art Museum of Catalonia houses the enormous painting La batalla de Tetuán measuring 300 by 972 cm.\nThe lions of the Congress of Deputies, made of bronze by the Spanish sculptor Ponciano Ponzano, were molded with the cannons captured from the Moroccans in that battle.\nReferences\nBibliography\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*"
