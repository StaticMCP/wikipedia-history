AllMusic writer Gregory Heaney commended Kweli's and Hi-Tek's musical chemistry and wrote \"Hi-Tek's soul-infused beats create the perfect laid-back atmosphere for Kweli's casual verbal acrobatics, crafting beats that bring the listener into the group's chilled-out space with their minimal aesthetic\". Steve Juon of RapReviews gave it a 9/10 rating and praised Kweli's rapping, stating \"Kweli is using his keen powers of observation to see the world for what it really is, and then translate that knowledge into a musical form you can simultaneously enjoy and learn from\". Exclaim!s Anupa Mistry wrote that Revolutions per Minute is \"doused in their working chemistry\". Boston Phoenix writer Chris Faraone gave it 3 out of 4 stars and stated \"The chemistry between these two remains bubbling\". HipHopDX writer Kathy Iandoli gave it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that it \"displays the evolution of both the emcee and the deejay\". Giving it an 8/10 rating, PopMatters writer Dave Heaton praised Kweli's lyrics concerning the importance of money in life, building a career in hip hop, the differences between celebrity and work, and the former's effect on a person, stating:\nGiving it 4 out of 5 stars, Slant Magazine writer M.T. Richards described the album as \"brainy, energizing stuff\" and praised Kweli's rapping, stating \"Sinking his no-frills flow into calm, bassy tracks, Kweli lands punchline after punchline with the kind of finesse Jay and Common could only dream of\". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave the album a B rating and wrote \"Hi-Tek lacks a trademark style, but his chemistry with Kweli remains potent, even when Minute doesn't hit the heights of the duo's debut\". Mosi Reeves of Spin gave the album 3½ out of 5 stars and viewed Hi-Tek's \"jazz-inflected riffs and soulful vibes\" as complementary to Kweli's \"mercurial\" style, stating \"congenial beats balance intricately daring rhymes\". Alternative Press writer Casey Boland gave it four out of five stars and viewed it as an improvement for Hi-Tek's producing and Kweli's rapping, stating \"he sounds at home with Hi-Tek. His cadence has never locked so tightly with the tune, his lyrical flow never so sinuous\". Henry Adaso of About.com noted a \"musical maturation\" by the duo and wrote that the album \"finds Kweli masterfully marrying the physical with the philosophical atop Hi-Tek's rich palette of headphone music\". Pitchfork Medias Nate Patrin gave Revolutions per Minute a 7.5/10 rating and commended its \"conscious yet unpretentious lyricism delivered with acrobatic dexterity over on-point, no-gimmick beats\".\nTrack listing\n*All songs produced by Hi-Tek.\n| length1  = 1:06\n| title2   = City Playgrounds\n| writer2  =\n| length2  = 4:43\n| title3   = Back Again\n| note3    = featuring Res\n| writer3  =\n| length3  = 3:26\n| title4   = Strangers (Paranoid)\n| note4    = featuring Bun B\n| writer4  =\n| length4  = 2:51\n| title5   = In This World\n| writer5  =\n| length5  = 3:31\n| title6   = Got Work (Fame)\n| writer6  =\n| length6  = 4:16\n| title7   = Midnight Hour\n| note7    = featuring Estelle\n| writer7  =\n| length7  = 4:40\n| title8   = Lifting Off\n| writer8  =\n| length8  = 5:22\n| title9   = In the Red\n| writer9  =\n| length9  = 3:00\n| title10  = Black Gold (Intro)\n| length10 = 0:18\n| title11  = Ballad of the Black Gold\n| writer11 =\n| length11 = 5:34\n| title12  = Just Begun\n| note12   = featuring Jay Electronica, J.
