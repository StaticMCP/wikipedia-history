The ceremony was held at  the NBC Studios in Burbank, California. Desi Arnaz hosted the event. All nominations are listed, with winners in bold and series' networks are in parentheses. Categories were sorted based on running time, instead of by genre.\nThe top shows of the night were ''Caesar's Hour and Playhouse 90''. Each show won a then-record five major awards, (however, two of Playhouse 90's wins came in now defunct categories).\n''Caesar's Hour became the first show to be nominated in all four major acting categories. Caesar's Hour also made history when it swept the four acting categories. For over fifty years, it remained the only show to win every major acting award. In 2004, the miniseries Angels in America became the second show, and first miniseries/television film, to sweep the acting field. In 2020, Schitt’s Creek became the first comedy or drama series to win in all four acting categories.\nWinners and nominees\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (‡).\nPrograms\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'The Phil Silvers Show (CBS)'\n** Alfred Hitchcock Presents (CBS)\n** Father Knows Best (NBC)\n** The Jack Benny Program (CBS)\n** Person to Person (CBS)\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n*'''Caesar's Hour (NBC)'\n** Climax!
