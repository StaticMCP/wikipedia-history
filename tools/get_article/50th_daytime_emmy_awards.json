The award ceremony was originally scheduled to be held on June 16, 2023, at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles, but was postponed to December 15, 2023, due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes.\nKevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner, co-anchors of the syndicated entertainment news magazine Entertainment Tonight, hosted the ceremony for the second consecutive year.\nThe full list of nominations were announced on April 26, 2023, with some key categories unveiled on April 25 on programs such as Access Hollywood, Entertainment Tonight, Extra and E! News. ABC series General Hospital led the nominations with fourteen main nominations plus five creative arts nominations. After the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike began on May 2, the NATAS announced the postponement of the ceremony on May 16. Then after the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike began on July 14, NATAS president Adam Sharp stated on July 24 that they had intended not to reschedule the ceremony until both strikes had ended. After the WGA Strike ended on September 27, and then the SAG-AFTRA on November 9, the NATAS confirmed on November 10 that the ceremony would be rescheduled to December 15.\nCBS holds the U.S. rights to broadcast the ceremony and stream it on Paramount+.\nCategory and rule changes\nFollowing a realignment between the Daytime Emmy Awards and Primetime Emmy Awards for the 2022 ceremonies, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced in August 2022 that all categories for game shows would move to the primetime ceremony.\nThe maximum age limit for those eligible for Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series has been lowered officially to 18.\nThe separate categories for \"entertainment\" and \"informative\" talk shows, and \"entertainment\" and \"informative\" talk show host, have been merged back into single talk show and talk show host categories, respectively. The categories have thus been re-named to Outstanding  Daytime Talk Series and Outstanding Daytime Talk Series Host.\nWinners and nominees\n, Outstanding Performance by a Lead Actress in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series winner]]\n, Outstanding Daytime Talk Series Host winner]]\nThe complete list of nominations for both the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards and the Creative Arts & Lifestyle Daytime Emmy Awards were announced on April 26, 2023.\nProgramming\n{|class=wikitable\n|+\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top;\" width=\"50%\" |\n* 'General Hospital (ABC)'\n** The Bay (Popstar!
