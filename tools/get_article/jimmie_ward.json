He played college football for the Northern Illinois Huskies, and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft.\nEarly life\nBorn in Racine, Wisconsin, Ward attended Davidson High School in Mobile, Alabama. He led the Warriors in tackles as a senior with 101 tackles, 73 solo, as Davidson went 10–3 and advanced to the state quarterfinals, while earning team Defensive MVP honors.

As a junior, Ward made 93 tackles, broke up seven passes and intercepted five. He also caused a pair of fumbles and blocked two kicks. He is the cousin of former NBA player Caron Butler.\nWard was considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com.\nCollege career\nWard attended Northern Illinois University from 2010 to 2013. In 2010, Ward played in all 14 games as a true freshman and blocked a school-record three punts on the year.

He also earned first-team All-MAC honors for the second consecutive season.\nProfessional career\nPre-draft\nComing out of Northern Illinois, Ward was projected to be a first or second round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He received an invitation to the NFL Combine as a top defensive back prospect, but was unable to participate in any physical running or jumping drills after discovering a stress fracture in his foot on the eve of the combine. On March 7, 2014, he opted to participate at Northern Illinois' pro day even though he was still injured and performed all of the combine drills except for the bench press. Scouts and team representatives from 30 NFL teams attended Northern Illinois' pro day as Ward, Jordan Lynch, and five other teammates worked out. Ward attended five private workouts with teams, that included the Indianapolis Colts and Minnesota Vikings. He was ranked the top strong safety prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com and was ranked the third best safety prospect by NFL analyst Mike Mayock and Sports Illustrated.\n}}\nSan Francisco 49ers\nThe San Francisco 49ers selected Ward in the first round (30th overall) of the 2014 NFL draft.
