Since 2008 he has been a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Prior to re-entering academia, French was a longtime foreign correspondent and senior writer with The New York Times.\nBiography\nFrench was a university instructor in the Ivory Coast in the 1980s before becoming a journalist. He has reported extensively on the political affairs of Western and Central Africa. These reports were the basis for his 2004 book, A Continent for the Taking.\nFrench joined The New York Times in 1986 and served as its bureau chief for the Caribbean and Central America from 1990 to 1994, covering Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and numerous other countries. He was one of the newspaper's first black correspondents.\nFrom 1994 to 1998, French covered West and Central Africa for the Times, reporting on wars in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Central Africa, with particular attention to the fall of the longtime dictator of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko.\nFrom 1998 to 2003, French was Tokyo bureau chief for the Times, covering Japan and the Koreas. To prepare for the job, he spent a year studying Japanese at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. From 2003 to 2008, he was the Shanghai bureau chief. He reported on the political and social affairs of China, including the growth of civil society, the government crackdown on dissent in the Dongzhou protests of 2005, and the Sichuan earthquake of 2008.\nIn addition to his native English, he speaks Mandarin, French, Spanish, and Japanese.\nFrench has written frequently for The New York Review of Books and also contributed to The Atlantic and other publications, including writing \"longreads\" articles for The Guardian. Besides his reporting for The New York Times, French has authored a weekly column on regional affairs for the International Herald Tribune, and another weekly column on international affairs for Foreign Policy.\nAmong his five books, French is best known for the award-winning Born in Blackness: Africa, Africans, and the Making of the Modern World, 1471 to the Second World War (Liveright, 2021). The book challenges previous scholarship by giving Africans a more significant role as \"prime movers\" in the history of the Western World since the 15th century. His 2025 book, \"The Second Emancipation: Nkrumah, Pan-Africanism, and Global Blackness at High Tide\" (Liveright, 2025) was named as one of the best non-fiction books of 2025 by Publishers Weekly.|url=https://best-books.publishersweekly.com/pw/best-books/2025/nonfiction#book/book-21| His previous book was ''Everything Under the Heavens: How China's Past Helps Shape its Push for Global Power (Knopf, 2017).\nFrench is also an internationally exhibited documentary photographer. His multi-year project, \"Disappearing Shanghai\", captured the rapidly shrinking old quarters of Shanghai. The exhibit was shown in Asia, Europe and the U.S. A book containing this work, Disappearing Shanghai: Photographs and Poems of an Intimate Way of Life, was published in 2012, in collaboration with the novelist and poet Qiu Xiaolong.\nIn 2025, French was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. French is a member of the board of the Columbia Journalism Review and past president of IRIN (since renamed The New Humanitarian), a non-profit news agency based in Geneva that focuses on the humanitarian sector.\nFellowships:\n*1999 Jefferson Fellow, East-West Society, Honolulu, Hawaii\n*2011 Open Societies Foundation fellow\nHonors\n*2025 Elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n*2022 Winner, Massachusetts African American History Museum Stone Book Award for Born in Blackness\n*2022 Winner, Hurston/Wright Award for Non-Fiction for Born in Blackness\n*2016 Professor of the Year, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism\n*2005 Finalist, Hurston Wright Award for Non-Fiction for A Continent for the Taking: The Tragedy and Hope of Africa\n*2004 Honorary Doctorate - University of Maryland, for commentary on East Asia\nWorks\nBooks\n*A Continent for the Taking: The Tragedy and Hope of Africa, Knopf, 2004.\n*Disappearing Shanghai: Photographs and Poems of an Intimate Way of Life with Qiu Xiaolong, Homa & Sekey 2012.\n*China's Second Continent: How a Million Migrants are Building a New Empire in Africa, Knopf 2014.\n*Everything Under the Heavens: How the Past Helps Shape China's Push for Global Power, Alfred A.

Belgium, driven by avarice and national pride, and the US, driven by paranoia about Soviet expansionism, were irremediably hostile to African leaders who sought to preserve a degree of nonalignment, used progressive rhetoric, and spoke defiantly and proudly about Africa's rightful place in the world.\" (p.&nbsp;36.)\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[https://www.howardwfrench.com/ Official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040929050247/http://www.lettre-ulysses-award.org/authors04/french.html Short biographic profile]\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/aglimpseoftheworld/ A Glimpse of the World]French's photos on Flickr\n*Howard French on [https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/howard-french-on-born-in-blackness/ Born in Blackness: Africa, Africans, and the Making of the Modern World, 1471 to the Second World War], from the \"Teach the Black Freedom Struggle\" online series."
