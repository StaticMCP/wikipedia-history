The establishment and abolishment of the Eighteen Kingdoms marked the beginning and end of a turbulent interregnum known as the Chu–Han Contention.\nThe details of the feudal division are as follows:\n{| width=\"525\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=10%|Name\n!width=5%|Name (Chinese)\n!width=20%|Ruler\n!width=35%|Areas covered (in present-day China)\n!width=35%|Fate\n|-\n|Western Chu || 西楚 || Xiang Yu || Jiangsu, northern Anhui, northern Zhejiang, eastern and southern Henan || Defeated by Liu Bang\n|-\n|Hàn || 漢/汉 || Liu Bang || Sichuan, Chongqing, southern Shaanxi ||\n|-\n|Yong|| 雍 || Zhang Han (Qin general) || central Shaanxi, and eastern Gansu || Defeated by Liu Bang\n|-\n|Sai|| 塞 || Sima Xin (Qin general) || northeastern Shaanxi || Defeated by Liu Bang\n|-\n|Di(zhai)|| 翟 || Dong Yi (Qin general) || northern Shaanxi || Defeated by Liu Bang\n|-\n|Hengshan || 衡山 || Wu Rui (Qin official supported by Yue tribes) || eastern Hubei, Jiangxi ||  Allies with Liu Bang\n|-\n|Hán || 韓 || Han Cheng (Hán royalty) || southwestern Henan ||\n|-\n|Zhao, briefly called Dai|| 趙/代|| Zhao Xie (Zhao royalty) || northern Shanxi, northwestern Hebei || Defeated by Liu Bang\n|-\n|Henan || 河南 || Shen Yang (Zhao official) || northwestern Henan ||\n|-\n|Changshan || 常山 || Zhang Er (Zhao vice chancellor) || central Hebei || Allies with Liu Bang\n|-\n|Yin || 殷 || Sima Ang (Zhao general) || northern Henan, southern Hebei || Allies with Liu Bang\n|-\n|Western Wei || 西魏 || Wei Bao (Wei royalty) || southern Shanxi || Defeated by Liu Bang\n|-\n|Jiujiang || 九江 || Ying Bu (Chu general) || central and southern Anhui || Allies with Liu Bang (surrendered, originally a Chu general)\n|-\n|Linjiang || 臨江 || Gong Ao (Chu general) || western Hubei, northern Hunan ||\n|-\n|Yan || 燕 || Zang Tu (Yan general) || northern Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin || Allies with Liu Bang\n|-\n|Liaodong || 遼東 || Han Guang (Yan royalty) || southern Liaoning || Surrendered to Liu Bang\n|-\n|Qi|| 齊 or 齐 || Tian Du (Qi general) || western and central Shandong || Defeated by Liu Bang\n|-\n|Jiaodong|| 膠東 || Tian Fu (Qi royalty) || eastern Shandong ||\n|-\n|Jibei|| 濟北 || Tian An (Qi rebel leader) || northern Shandong ||\n|-\n|}\nThe Eighteen Kingdoms were short-lived. Almost immediately rebellion broke out in Qi, after which Tian Rong conquered Jiaodong and Jibei, reuniting the old Qi state. Meanwhile, Xiang Yu had Emperor Yi of Chu and King Han Cheng of Hán killed. Thereafter, Liu Bang of Hàn conquered the lands of the Three Qins, thereby formally starting the Chu–Han Contention. Following many battles and changing alliances, Han defeated Chu and subdued all other kingdoms, where Liu Bang appointed vassal kings while making himself the first Emperor of the Han dynasty in 202 BCE.\nSee also\n* Fengjian\n* Ancient Chinese states\n* Kings of the Han dynasty\nNotes\nReferences"
