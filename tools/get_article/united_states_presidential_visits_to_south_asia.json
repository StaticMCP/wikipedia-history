The first trip by a sitting president to South Asia was by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959. Of the eight countries in the region, only 4 of them have been visited by a sitting American president: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The other four countries, Bhutan (which has no formal diplomatic relations with the US), the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have never been visited by a sitting American president.\nTable of visits\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Total Number of Visits in each country in South Asia\n!Countries\n!Total Number of visits\n|-\n|\n|9\n|-\n|\n|8\n|-\n|\n|5\n|-\n|\n|1\n|-\n|\n|0\n|-\n|\n|0\n|-\n|\n|0\n|-\n|\n|0\n|}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!President\n!Dates\n!Countries\n!Locations\n!Key details\n|-\n|nowrap rowspan=3|Dwight D.
