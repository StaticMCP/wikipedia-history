A three-quarter, Holder represented the Buller Rugby Union at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national rugby union side, the All Blacks, in 1932 and 1934. He played 10 matches for the All Blacks including one international. After missing selection for the 1935 All Black tour to Britain, Holder switched to rugby league and played in England, first for Streatham and Mitcham and then for Wigan. He was subsequently reinstated to rugby union during World War II.\nHolder was educated at Nelson College from 1922 to 1924.\nReferences"
