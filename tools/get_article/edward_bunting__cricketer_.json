      "text": "# Edward Bunting (cricketer)\n\nEdward Lancelot Bunting (10 December 1883 – 26 February 1962) was an English cricketer who played a single first-class match in 1922, for Worcestershire against Yorkshire.\nHis brief experience of the first-class game was not successful: Yorkshire, who would go on to the County Championship title, beat their opponents by an innings and 220 runs inside two days. Bunting himself made 1 and 0, with his four overs of leg-spin going for 38 runs, though he took a catch to dismiss George Macaulay.\nBunting was born in Tillington, Staffordshire; he died in Barnwood, Gloucestershire aged 78.\nExternal links\n*"
