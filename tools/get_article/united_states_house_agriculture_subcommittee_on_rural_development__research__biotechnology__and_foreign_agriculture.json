Its jurisdiction includes rural development, farm security and family farming matters, foreign agricultural assistance, and trade promotion programs.\nThe subcommittee was previously known as the Subcommittee on Specialty Crops and Foreign Agriculture, but rural development was added to the subcommittee's portfolio at the start of the 110th Congress.
