Warleta's tenure as chief of naval staff coincided with the Spanish–American War, during which he attended a meeting on 23 April 1898 led by the naval minister Segismundo Bermejo y Merelo, where he supported the proposal of deploying Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete's squadron to Cuba—a decision that led to the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Previously, he had served as the head of the logistics branch of the Ministry of the Navy, and from 1888 until 1890 he commanded the cruiser Reina Regente as a ship-of-the-line captain.\nReferences"
