The day thereafter, on 17 March, the first confirmed cases of local transmission were announced by government labs, 4 in Gauteng, 3 in KwaZulu-Natal, and 1 in the Western Cape. On the next day, 18 March, the first confirmed case of local transmission in Mpumalanga was announced by government labs.\nOn 19 March, the Health Minister suggested that two-thirds of the South African population could contract the virus, a prediction in line with Europe's estimates on population infection.\nOn 20 March, the Free State province recorded seven cases, becoming the sixth of South Africa's nine provinces to be infected.
