Its expansion aligns with rising deportation efforts from countries including Libya, the U.S., and several EU nations.\nHuman Rights Watch and academic analysts note that while the IOM claims RCMS supports voluntary return, the use of detention and coercion in some cases challenges this narrative.\nMobile Apps and Peer-to-Peer Communication\nProjects such as “Migrants as Messengers,” led by the IOM and ITU, employ smartphone apps and community-driven reporting. Returning migrants record testimonies of their journeys in countries like Nigeria, Senegal, and Guinea, then share via social media to educate prospective migrants about risks and realities.\nThese initiatives have amassed over 2 million video views and trained returnees as digital peer educators—though they primarily emphasize awareness rather than supporting formal repatriation processes.\nRepatriation Transparency and Community Feedback\nSome digital tools integrate feedback loops from migrants, enabling human-rights monitoring and reinforcing messaging around assistance and post-return support.\nNonetheless, critics argue that such platforms often overlook the needs of undocumented migrants who fear digital data being used against them regarding arrest or deportation.\nDiscussion and Debate\nSupporters argue digital tracking accelerates return processing, improves data accuracy, and ensures migrant safety through real-time coordination. Detractors counter that surveillance technologies can erode trust, violate privacy, and facilitate authoritarian uses of migrant data.\nFuture Directions\nPolicymakers and NGOs propose integrating digital identity systems with robust data protections and local oversight—striving for transparent, rights-based deployment aligned with African digital sovereignty ambitions.\nHowever, questions remain about ensuring accountability, consent, and equitable access—especially for irregular migrants lacking formal identification or fearing punitive outcomes.\nReferences"
