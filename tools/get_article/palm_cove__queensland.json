It was named in 1965 after Mount Buchan, which in turn was named by explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple on  20 October 1873, after Buchan in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The use of the name Buchan has fallen into disuse over the years.\nHistory\nPalm Cove is situated in the Djabugay (Tjapukai) traditional Aboriginal country.\nThe first documented British visit to the area was by a coastal expedition led by George Elphinstone Dalrymple in 1873. Dalrymple's group had stopped in the area for a few days and accessed a large lagoon at Palm Cove. Immediately after landing, a large number of Aboriginal people came out of their camps and attempted to prevent the groups passage to the lagoon. Darlrymple's group used gunfire. Afterward, all of the group \"heartily rejoiced at the severe lesson which their unwarrantable hostility had brought upon them\".\nShortly before World War I in 1918, the land that is today Palm Cove was bought by Albert Veivers from Archdeacon Campbell. Archdeacon Campbell had been known as a priest at Cairns church who experimented with bringing different agricultural crops to the Cairns region. Veivers was important in the advancement of Palm Cove by having the first road built. The creation of the road led property values in Palm Cove to increase dramatically, leading to more prosperity for the community.\nShortly after World War II, in which Palm Cove was used as a training base for Australian soldiers, the number of people travelling to Palm Cove greatly increased.\nThe opening of the Ramada Reef Resort in 1986 marked the first international hotel chain to be located in Palm Cove, and the area has continued to increase in national and international recognition ever since.\nIn 2024, Palm Cove was rated the number-one \"Best Beach in the World\" by Condé Nast Traveler, who described it as the \"epitome of a tropical paradise\".\nDemographics\nIn the , Palm Cove had a population of 1,215 people.\nIn the , Palm Cove had a population of 2,059 people.\nIn the , Palm Cove had a population of 2,450 people.\nEconomy\nThe major industry for Palm Cove is the Accommodation and Food Services sector which relates to tourism. 21.2% of residents were employed in this sector in 2011\nEducation\nThere are no schools in Palm Cove.
