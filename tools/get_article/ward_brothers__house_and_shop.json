It consists of a two-story, two-bay, one-room plan frame dwelling built around 1880, and the brothers' barber shop, a composite building composed of individual structures grouped together behind a long false front.  The brothers Lemuel T. Ward, Jr. (1896–1985) and Steve Ward (1895–1976) are recognized as the fathers of the modern movement in decorative wildlife, or decoy, carving in America.\nThe Ward Brothers' House and Shop was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The house was demolished in November 2013.\nReferences\nExternal links\n* , including photo from 1992, at Maryland Historical Trust"
