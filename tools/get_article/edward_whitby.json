Whitby was accused of official corruption and the committee voted to remove him from office. However the meeting was extremely unruly and a decision was deferred until his return.  At the hearing he defended himself successfully and was reaffirmed in his office. He was re-elected MP for Chester in 1621, 1624, 1625, 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years.\nWhitby continued as Recorder until his death in 1639. His house at Bache Hall was demolished during the siege of Chester in the English Civil War, when Parliamentary troops used it as a garrison.\nWhitby married Alice Gamull, widow of Thomas Gamull and daughter of Richard Bavand of Chester.\nReferences"
