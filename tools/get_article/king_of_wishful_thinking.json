It was featured in the film Pretty Woman and appeared on its soundtrack. It was later featured on Go West's third studio album, Indian Summer, in 1992.\nIn terms of the group's discography, \"King of Wishful Thinking\" has become their best known song. The track reached number three in Canada, number six in Australia, number eight in the United&nbsp;States, and number 18 in the United&nbsp;Kingdom. At the 1991 Brit Awards, the song was nominated for the Brit Award for British Video of the Year.\nCritical reception\nMusic journalist Hannah Dailey of the U.S. publication Billboard has labeled the song as \"one of the crown jewels of ’90s classic hits\".\nMusic video\nThe song's official music video is known for featuring various absurdist elements alongside the pop duo as they act on a solid white stage. It was produced, directed and written by Paul Flattery and Jim Yukich of FYI. Though the film does not outwardly utilize film clips from Pretty Woman, outside of brief glimpses superimposed on actual celluloid, the video includes lookalikes of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere (dressed as his character from An Officer and a Gentleman). An actor playing Roy Orbison, performer of the titular song from the film, also appears.\nIn 2018, actor Paul Rudd and late-night host Jimmy Fallon made a shot-for-shot recreation of the music video for The Tonight Show. Some elements such as a dancing Pope, zebras, and a trained circus elephant, present in the original video, were not reproduced in the remake. American band the Roots made a cameo appearance.\nTrack listings\nUK 7-inch and cassette single\n# \"The King of Wishful Thinking\" – 4:00\n# \"Tears Too Late\" – 4:25\nUK CD single\n# \"The King of Wishful Thinking\" – 4:00\n# \"The King of Wishful Thinking\" (Jon Gass US 12-inch) – 5:49\n# \"Tears Too Late\" – 4:25\n# \"The King of Wishful Thinking\" (acapella) – 2:45\n* The UK 12-inch single switches tracks one and two.\nUS and Canadian cassette single\n# \"King of Wishful Thinking\" (LP version)\n# \"King of Wishful Thinking\" (power mix)\nPersonnel\nPersonnel are taken from Sessionday.\nGo West\n* Peter Cox – lead vocals, backing vocals, keyboards\n* Richard Drummie – backing vocals, keyboards, guitars\nAdditional musicians\n* Peter Wolf – keyboards, drum programming\n* David Williams – guitars\n* Dan Higgins – saxophones\n* Larry Williams – saxophones\n* Gary Grant – trumpet\n* Jerry Hey – trumpet, horn arrangements\nCharts\nWeekly charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1990)\n!Peakposition\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100)\n|49\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|8\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Adult Contemporary (Billboard)\n|7\n|}\nYear-end charts\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1990)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)\n|62\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM)\n|35\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM)\n|40\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100\n|70\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|US Adult Contemporary (Billboard)\n|44\n|}\nCertifications\nSee also\n* 1990 in music\nReferences\nExternal links\n*\n*"
