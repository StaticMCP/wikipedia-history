The album peaked at number 15 on the ARIA Charts.\nReception\nBruce Baker from The AU Review said \"Home features rich story telling, some sweet guitars and beautiful harmonies. From the hopefull sorrow of 'One Too Many Times' the celebration of acceptance and contentment in 'Burning Holes' and the shredding guitars in 'Last One's Kicking In', Home is their strongest work to date.\"\nLars Brandle from Rolling Stone Australia gave the album 3.5 out of 5 describing the album as \"A set that strolls deep into blues-rock territory and invites us to come along\".\nTrack listing\nCharts\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Chart performance for Home\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2023)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peakposition\n|-\n|}\nRelease history\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Release history for Home\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Australia\n| 24 February 2023\n| rowspan=\"2\"|\n| Kingswood / MGM\n| KINGSWOOD001CD / KINGSWOOD001LP\n|}\nReferences"
