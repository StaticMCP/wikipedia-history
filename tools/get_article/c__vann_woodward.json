He was long a supporter of the approach of Charles A. Beard, stressing the influence of unseen economic motivations in politics.\nWoodward was on the left end of the history profession in the 1930s. By  the 1950s he was a leading liberal and supporter of civil rights. His book The Strange Career of Jim Crow makes the case that racial segregation was an invention of the late 19th century rather than an inevitable post-Civil-War development. After attacks on him by the New Left in the late 1960s, he moved to the right politically. He won a Pulitzer Prize for History for his annotated edition of Mary Chestnut's Civil War diaries.\nEarly life and education\nC. Vann Woodward was born in Vanndale, Arkansas, a town named after his mother's family and the county seat from 1886 to 1903. It was in Cross County in eastern Arkansas. Woodward attended high school in Morrilton, Arkansas. He attended Henderson-Brown College, a small Methodist school in Arkadelphia, for two years. In 1930, he transferred to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where his uncle was dean of students and professor of sociology. After graduating, he taught English composition for two years at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. There he met Will W. Alexander, head of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, and J. Saunders Redding, a historian at Atlanta University.\nWoodward enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University in 1931 and received his M.A. from that institution in 1932. In New York, Woodward met, and was influenced by, W. E. B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, and other figures who were associated with the Harlem Renaissance movement. After receiving his master's degree in 1932, Woodward worked for the defense of Angelo Herndon, a young African-American Communist Party member who had been accused of subversive activities. He also traveled to the Soviet Union and Germany in 1932.\nHe did graduate work in history and sociology at the University of North Carolina. He was granted a Ph.D. in history in 1937, using as his dissertation the manuscript he had already finished on Thomas E. Watson. Woodward's dissertation director was Howard K. Beale, a Reconstruction specialist who promoted the Beardian economic interpretation of history that deemphasized ideology and ideas and stressed material self-interest as a motivating factor.\nIn World War II, Woodward served in the Navy, assigned to write the history of major battles. His The Battle for Leyte Gulf (1947) became the standard study of the largest naval battle in history.\nCareer\nWoodward, starting out on the left politically, wanted to use history to explore dissent. He approached W. E. B. Du Bois about writing about him, and thought of following his biography of Watson with one of Eugene V. Debs.  He picked Georgia politician Tom Watson, who in the 1890s was a populist leader focusing the anger and hatred of poor whites against the establishment, banks, railroads and businessmen. Watson in 1908 was the presidential candidate of the Populist Party, but this time was the leader in mobilizing the hatred of the same poor whites against blacks, and a promoter of lynching.\nThe Strange Career of Jim Crow\nWoodward's most influential book was The Strange Career of Jim Crow (1955), which explained that segregation was a relatively late development and was not inevitable. After the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, in spring 1954, Woodward gave the Richards Lectures at the University of Virginia. The lectures were published in 1955 as The Strange Career of Jim Crow. Popular myth holds that Martin Luther King Jr. called The Strange Career \"the historical Bible of the Civil Rights Movement\" in a speech at Montgomery, Alabama on March 23, 1956, though he did not do so; he did cite the book and aver that it proved racial segregation was \"a political stratagem\", in King's words, and not a natural state of American society. It reached a large popular audience and helped shape the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.\nJim Crow laws, Woodward argued, were not part of the immediate aftermath of Reconstruction; they came later and were not inevitable.  Following the Compromise of 1877, into the 1880s there were localized informal practices of racial separation in some areas of society along with what he termed \"forgotten alternatives\" in others. Finally the 1890s saw white southerners \"capitulate to racism\" to create \"legally prescribed, rigidly enforced, state-wide Jim Crowism.\"\nOrigins of the New South, 1877–1913\nOrigins of the New South, 1877–1913 was published in 1951 by Louisiana State University Press as multivolume history of the South. It combined the Beardian theme of economic forces shaping history and the Faulknerian tone of tragedy and decline. He insisted on the discontinuity of the era and rejected both the romantic antebellum popular images of the Lost Cause school and the overoptimistic business boosterism of the New South Creed. Sheldon Hackney, a Woodward student, hailed the book.\nAppointments, teaching and awards\nWoodward was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958 and the American Philosophical Society in 1959.\nWoodward taught at Johns Hopkins University from 1946 to 1961. He became Sterling Professor of History at Yale from 1961 to 1977, where he taught both graduate students and undergraduates. He did much writing but little original research at Yale, frequently writing essays for such outlets as the New York Review of Books. He directed 25 PhD dissertations, including those by\n* John W. Blassingame, former chair of the African American studies program at Yale;\n* James M. McPherson, Professor of History at Princeton University;\n* J. Morgan Kousser, Professor of History at California Institute of Technology\n* J. Mills Thornton, Professor of History at University of Michigan\n* Patricia Nelson Limerick, Professor of History at the University of Colorado at Boulder;\n* Lawrence N. Powell, Professor of History at Tulane University\n* Michel Wayne, Professor of History at the University of Toronto;\n* Steven Hahn, Professor of History at the New York University;\n* John Herbert Roper, Richardson Chair of American History at Emory & Henry College;\n* Barbara Fields, Professor of History at Columbia University.\nIn 1974, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary asked Woodward for an historical study of misconduct in previous administrations and how the Presidents responded. Woodward led a group of fourteen historians, and they produced a 400-page report in less than four months, Responses of the Presidents to Charges of Misconduct.\nIn 1978, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Woodward for the Jefferson Lecture, the federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. His lecture, entitled \"The European Vision of America\", was later incorporated into his book ''The Old World's New World.\nWoodward won the Pulitzer Prize in 1982 for Mary Chesnut's Civil War'', an edited version of Mary Chesnut's Civil War diary. He won the Bancroft Prize for Origins of the New South.\nMove to the right\nPeter Novick stated, \"Vann Woodward was always very conflicted about the 'presentism' of his work. He alternated between denying it, qualifying it, and apologizing for it.\" The British historian Michael O'Brien, the editor of Woodward's letters in 2013, says that by the 1970s\nHe became greatly troubled by the rise of the black power movement, disliked affirmative action, never came to grips with feminism, mistrusted what came to be known as \"theory,\" and became a strong opponent of multiculturalism and \"political correctness.\"\nIn 1969, as president of the American Historical Association, Woodward led the fight to defeat a proposal by New Left historians to politicize the organization. He wrote his daughter afterwards, \"The preparations paid off and I had pretty well second-guessed the Rads on every turn.\"\nIn 1975–76 Woodward led the unsuccessful fight at Yale to block the temporary appointment of the communist historian Herbert Aptheker to teach a course. Radicals denounced his actions but a joint committee of the Organization of American Historians and the American Historical Association exonerated the process and found that there was no evidence that political criteria had been used. In 1987 he joined the conservative scholars who made up the National Association of Scholars, a group that explicitly opposes the academic left. Woodward wrote a favorable review in the New York Review of Books of Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus. It said that Duke University used racial criteria when it hired John Hope Franklin, who publicly feuded with Woodward. Hackney stated, \"Woodward became an open critic of political correctness and in other ways appeared to have shifted his seat at the political table.\"\nDeath and legacy\nC. Vann Woodward died December 17, 1999, in Hamden, Connecticut, at the age of 91.\nWoodward cautioned that the academicians had themselves abdicated their role as storytellers:Professionals do well to apply the term \"amateur\" with caution to the historian outside their ranks. The word does have deprecatory and patronizing connotations that occasionally backfire. This is especially true of narrative history, which nonprofessionals have all but taken over. The gradual withering of the narrative impulse in favor of the analytical urge among professional academic historians has resulted in a virtual abdication of the oldest and most honored role of the historian, that of storyteller. Having abdicated... the professional is in a poor position to patronize amateurs who fulfill the needed function he has abandoned.\nThe Southern Historical Association has established the C. Vann Woodward Dissertation Prize, awarded annually to the best dissertation on Southern history. There is a Peter V. and C. Vann Woodward Chair of History at Yale; it is now held by southern historian Glenda Gilmore. (Peter was Woodward's son, who died at the age of 26 in 1969.)\nHe was a Charter member of the Fellowship of Southern Writers.\nWorks\nBooks\n* [https://archive.org/details/AgrarianRebel1938BiographyOfTomWatson Tom Watson, Agrarian Rebel] (1938)\n*  The Battle for Leyte Gulf (1947, new ed. 1965) [https://archive.org/details/battleforleytegu0000wood online]\n* [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;q1=woodward;q2=ACLS%20Humanities%20E-Book;op2=and;rgn=works;rgn1=author;rgn2=series;view=toc;idno=heb00007.0001.001 Origins of the New South, 1877–1913] (1951) [https://archive.org/details/originsofnewsout00wood borrow for 14 days]\n* Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction (1951, rev. edn 1991)\n* [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;q1=woodward;q2=ACLS%20Humanities%20E-Book;op2=and;rgn=works;rgn1=author;rgn2=series;view=toc;idno=heb02029.0001.001 The Strange Career of Jim Crow].
