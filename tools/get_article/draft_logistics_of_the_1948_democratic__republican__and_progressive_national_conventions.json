Only a few minutes of kinescope film have survived of these historic, live television broadcasts. The coaxial cables cables allowed the television networks to broadcast live coverage to as many as 10 million viewers living on the East Coast.\nThe television networks agreed that they would use a pool feed for fixed-position footage. The networks installed five fixed-position cameras and shared a single feed director. In addition, networks had their floor correspondents travel with early TV mobile cameras, using early-model mobile setups that required correspondents to wear heavy equipment backpacks.\nCBS Radio correspondent Edward R. Murrow successfully lobbied his employer to allow him to take part in the coverage of the CBS television network, and he was assigned a floor correspondent for the conventions.\nTelevision broadcasting would be expanded upon during the 1952 Democratic and Republican conventions, which received nationwide live television broadcasts.\nPreparation of Convention Hall\nAhead of the convention,\nThe convention took place amid a three-month heatwave impacting Philadelphia. The arena lacked air conditioning, and the heat generated by television lights inside of it only worsened attendees' discomfort. The heatwave was strong during the Republican convention, and only worsened by the time of the Democratic convention.\nOther significant venues\nThe Progressives held the final evening of their convention (featuring acceptance speeches) at Shibe Park allowing a crowd of 32,000 to spectate Wallace's acceptance speech.\nHotels and other overnight accommodations\nPhiladelphia and its region lacked enough hotel rooms to adequately accommodate  the demand generated by the conventions.\nHotels in the\nThe Progressive convention's attendance was dominated not by experienced members of the political class, but by nascent political activists. Some in attendance camped in tents in a temporary tent city that popped-up in the convention center's parking lot during the Progressive convention.\nTransportation\nSome West Coast Republicans complained of the travel expenses required for them to attend a convention held on the East Coast. https://www.newspapers.com/image/564492249\nSome of the political activists that attended the Progressive convention (which was, unlike the major party conventions, dominated by nascent activists than the experienced political class) traveled to Philadelphia by hitchhiking.\nFunding\nAs it had pledged to, Philadelphia locally provided a total of $400,000 to fund the conventions, with each party receiving $200,000. By holding conventions in the same city, both parties saved money on preparations. They had done the same in the previous election, when they both met in Chicago.\nTicketing and credentials\n's Jefferson Memorial)]]\n(an American Founding Father)]]\n)]]\nOther related events in Philadelphia\nYouths for Wallace convention\nReferences\nDemocratic Republican Progressive National Conventions logistics\nDemocratic Republican Progressive National Conventions logistics\nDemocratic Republican National Conventions logistics\nDemocratic Republican National Conventions logistics\n1948 Democratic Republican Progressive National Conventions logistics\n1948 Democratic Republican Progressive National Conventions logistics\n:Category:Democratic National Conventions\n:Category:Republican National Conventions\n:Category:Progressive Party (United States, 1948)\n:Category:Event management"
