Chandran. It is a sequel to the 1995 comedy Mannar Mathai Speaking and the third installment in the Ramji Rao franchise. Actors Innocent, Mukesh, Sai Kumar, Biju Menon, Vijayaraghavan and Janardhanan reprised their roles; while Aparna Gopinath, Shammi Thilakan and a few others are also included in the cast. The film features original music and background score composed by Rahul Raj.\nPlot\nYears after their earlier adventures, Mannar Mathai runs a travel agency, Urvashi Tours & Travels, with his old partners Gopalakrishnan and Balakrishnan. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of their drama troupe, Mathai plans a new play, though his partners are reluctant due to past troubles in the theatre.\nWhen they advertise for a new English-speaking driver, Mathai secretly adds another ad seeking a “heroine” for the play. This brings in Nithya and her friend Unni. While Unni is hired as the driver, Mathai sees Nithya as his lead actress. Soon, the trio encounters their former foe, Mahendra Varma, now mentally impaired after an accident. They forgive him, but new complications arise when they learn that Nithya and Unni are fugitives falsely accused of bank fraud.\nIt is revealed that Nithya is the daughter of Ramji Rao, who has since reformed, taken the name Kunjumon, and become a pastor. Meanwhile, Mahendra’s identical twin brother, Hareendran — an international criminal — arrives in search of a stolen diamond hidden in a bag now held by SI Babumon. When Hareendran kidnaps Gopalakrishnan’s daughters to retrieve the diamond, Mathai and his friends attempt a risky rescue.\nAmid chaos involving mistaken identities, betrayals, and overlapping kidnappings, a massive brawl breaks out between the criminals, police, and theatre members. Hareendran is apparently arrested, but it is later revealed that he escaped after swapping clothes with his twin brother, Mahendran.\nThe film ends during the troupe’s 25th anniversary play, where Gopalakrishnan notices the lost diamond embedded in Mathai’s crown. As Mathai hints that someone may soon come looking for it, they spot Hareendran in the audience — only for him to vanish moments later.\nCast\n* Innocent as Mannar Mathai\n* Mukesh as Gopalakrishnan\n* Sai Kumar as Balakrishnan\n* Biju Menon in a dual role as:\n** Mahendra Varma\n** Hareendra Varma\n* Vijayaraghavan as Ramji Rao / Pastor Kunjumon\n* Aparna Gopinath as Nithya\n* Janardhanan as Garvasees Aashan\n* Indrans as Ponnappan\n* Priyanka Anoop as Shakunthala\n* Shammi Thilakan as Driver Koshi\n* Akshitha as Malayali House Fame\n* Kalabhavan Shajon as SI Babumon\n* Niyas Backer as Cook Manjulan\n* Basil Paulose as Unni\n* Chembil Ashokan\n* Ullas Pandalam\n* Andrew Ross as the Diamond Smuggler\n* Naseer Sankranthi\n* Vani Viswanath as Meera/Stella Fernandez [Special appearance in the title song] (From the first part's film shots)\n* Sukumari as Gopalakrishnan's mother [Special appearance in the title song] (From the first part's film shots)\nMusic\nThe music and background score of the movie are composed, orchestrated, and produced by Rahul Raj.
