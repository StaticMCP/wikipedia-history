The War Hawks, transitioning to Division II and Lone Star Conference (LSC) membership, competed as an independent and provisional Division II member. They played a mixed schedule of schools from the FCS, NAIA, and D-II. McMurry competed in the Division II postseason via the LSC's bid to the C.H.A.M.P.S. Heart of Texas Bowl.\nThe War Hawks were led by Hal Mumme in his fourth and final year as head coach. Mumme stepped down in January 2013 before being named an offensive assistant at SMU the following March.\nSchedule\n}}\n|)\n| opponent = McNeese State\n| site_stadium = Cowboy Stadium\n| site_cityst = Lake Charles, LA\n| score = 7–69\n| attend = 13,291\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Wilford Moore Stadium\n| site_cityst = Abilene, TX\n| score = 76–13\n| attend = 3,019\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Carl Wooten Field\n| site_cityst = Goodwell, OK\n| score = 42–33\n| attend = 824\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Gopher Warrior Bowl\n| site_cityst = Grand Prairie, TX\n| score = 22–19\n| attend = 653\n| source =\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n}}\n|\n| homecoming = y\n| site_stadium = Wilford Moore Stadium\n| site_cityst = Abilene, TX\n| score = 29–11\n| attend = 2,849\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Wilford Moore Stadium\n| site_cityst = Abilene, TX\n| score = 53–0\n| attend = 1,553\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Wilford Moore Stadium\n| site_cityst = Abilene, TX\n| score = 47–14\n| attend = 1,347\n| source =\n}}\n|\n| site_stadium = Bulldawg Stadium\n| site_cityst = Copperas Cove, TX\n| gamename = C.H.A.M.P.S.
