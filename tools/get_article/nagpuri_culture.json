People drink it during festivals and marriage feasts.\nReligion\nSadan people observe festivals such as Asari, Karam, Jitiya, Nawakhani, Sohrai, Fagun and Bad Pahari. In these festivals the elder of family members propitates Sun, Moon, ancestors and other deities by offering sacrifices and liquor.  In the village festival, the rituals are performed by the village priest \"Pahan\" and his assistant \"Pujar\", who offer sacrifice to village deity. According to scholars, the deities which are not found in Hindu scriptures are deities of  folk tradition which is a non-vedic  tradition. According to June McDaniel, folk Hinduism is based on local traditions and cults of local deities and is the oldest, non-literate system. It is a pre-vedic tradition extending back to prehistoric times, or before the writing of the Vedas. The influence of Vedic religion reached in the region during the reign of the Nagvanshi.  The Nagvanshi kings constructed several temples during their reign and invited Brahmins from various parts of the country for priestly duties. But rituals in the village are carried out by village priest Pahan.\nMegasthenes, the Greek Ambassador to Maurya, Emperor Chandragupta Maurya, mentioned India in his book Indica. According to him, Indians make wine from rice, drink rice bear in sacrifice and mainly eat rice pottage.\nIn 1989, the Jharkhand Co-ordination committee (JCC), who was instrumental in the demand for a separate Jharkhand state in front of the central government, also stated in their paper that Sadan may be the earliest Aryan population and could be the subcategoriable as Naga people as they differ from dominant Aryan group and did't strictly follow Brahmanical religion.\nMarriage tradition\nNagpuri weddings are held for several days. Prior to marriage, the groom's relatives go bride's home to see and negotiate for marriage and a token amount (bride price) is paid by the groom's family to the family of the bride. Some wedding rituals are madwa, baraat, parghani, sindoordan, bidai. Domkach folk dance is performed during the wedding. The musical instruments used in the nagpuri wedding are nagara, dhak and  shehnai.\nThe practice of bride price was mentioned in Ramayana and Mahabharata where during weddings of Kaikeyi, Gandhari and Madri, bride price was given. The practice of giving bride price was considered Asura Vivah in Smriti texts such as Grihas Sutra and Dharma Sutra.\nTraditional administrative System\nIn Chotoanagpur, there was a traditional administrative system to govern villages known as to the Parha system. In the Parha system, there were the posts of  Mahto (village chief), Pahan (village priest), Pujar or Pani bharwa (assistant of Pahan), Bhandari (treasurer), Chowkidar (watchman), Diwan (minister) and Raja (king). During the reign of Nagvanshi, the landowners were known as Bhuinhar. Bhuinhar refers to the first people who cleared forest, built farmland and houses in a village. Sadans were in the post of Diwan, Thakur, Pandey, Karta (executive), Lal, Mahato, Pahan and Raja.\nThe owner of lands known as Bhuinhars.\nMahto made assessments and settlement of all land not held by hereditary cultivators. He collects rent. Pahan, the village priest, does all the rituals for village deities. Bhandari assists with the collection of rents and summoning ryots who work for farmers or Zamindars. There was Gorait, who was a messenger to Zamindar, and Kotwar, who was a police officer in each village. The village has a blacksmith and a Gowala who rear the cattle of the village.\nCinema\nNagpuri language films have been produced since 1992. Sona Kar Nagpur (1992) was the first nagpuri film produced and directed by Dhananjay Nath Tiwari. The Nagpuri cinema faces several challenges, such as lack of funds and lack of infrastructure, as the majority of the audience reside in villages. Despite all these, several films are produced per year and few get released.\nSee also\n*Culture of Jharkhand\n*Culture of India\nReferences\nExternal links=="
