The awards are awarded for the most popular drama series couple by an actor and actress. It was last awarded in 2016 to Qi Yuwu and Jeanette Aw for their roles as Jason Lam 蓝钦辉 and Zhao Fei'er 赵非儿 in The Dream Makers II.\nHistory\nThe category was introduced in 2011, at the 17th Star Awards ceremony; Christopher Lee and Jeanette Aw received the award for their roles in Breakout and it is given in honour of a pair of artistes–one actor and one actress (not necessary to be contracted under Mediacorp)–who portrayed a drama series couple that is deemed the most popular among the television audience. In 2011, the nominees were determined by a team of judges employed by Mediacorp. The rule was removed in 2012 to allow the public to determine the nominees entirely via online voting. Winners are also selected by a majority vote from the public via online voting as well.\nSince its inception, the award was given to four onscreen couples – four different actors and two different actresses. Desmond Tan and Chantalle Ng are the most recent and final winners in this category for their roles in All That Glitters.  Elvin Ng and Rui En; Qi and Aw; and Xu and Ng are the onscreen couples to win in this category twice. In addition, Lee and Jesseca Liu; Li Nanxing and Rui En; Ng and Rui En; Qi and Aw; Qi and Joanne Peh; Qi and Rui En; Xu and Ng have been nominated on two occasions, more than any other onscreen couple.\nFor the actors who were nominated in this category, Ng, Qi and Xu Bin are the only actors to win in this category twice. In addition, Qi has been nominated on six occasions, more than any other actor. Li holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with three.\nFor the actresses who were nominated in this category, Aw is the only actress to win in this category four times, surpassing Ng who has three wins. Rui En has been nominated on 13 occasions, more than any other actress. Ann Kok, Liu, Peh, Julie Tan, and Zhou Ying hold the record for the most nominations without a win, with two.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Onscreen couple\n!
