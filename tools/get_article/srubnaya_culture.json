It is a successor of the Yamnaya culture, the Catacomb culture and the Poltavka culture. It is co-ordinate and probably closely related to the Andronovo culture, its eastern neighbor. Whether the Srubnaya culture originated in the east, west, or was a local development, is disputed among archaeologists.\nThe Srubnaya culture is generally associated with archaic Iranian-speakers. The name comes from Russian сруб (srub) / Ukrainian зруб (zrub), \"timber framework\", from the way graves were constructed.\nDistribution\n]]\nThe Srubnaya culture occupied the area along and above the north shore of the Black Sea from the Dnieper eastwards along the northern base of the Caucasus to the area abutting the north shore of the Caspian Sea, west of the Ural Mountains. Historical testimony indicate that the Srubnaya culture was succeeded by the Scythians.\nIn the early 2nd millennium BC, the Lola culture in the North Caucasus came under increasing pressure from the Srubnaya culture, who were advancing from the Middle Volga region. By 1800 BC, the Srubnaya replaced the Lola population. The Lola culture had previously replaced the local variants of the Catacomb culture. The physical type of the Lola population was very different from that of the Srubnaya and Catacomb populations.\nCharacteristics\nThe Srubnaya culture is named for its use of timber constructions within its burial pits. Its cemeteries consisted of five to ten kurgans. Burials included the skulls and forelegs of animals and ritual hearths. Stone cists were occasionally employed. Srubnaya settlements consisted of semi-subterranean and two-roomed houses. The presence of bronze sickles, grinding stones, domestic cattle, sheep and pigs indicate that the Srubnaya engaged in both agriculture and stockbreeding.\nThe use of chariots in the Srubnaya culture is indicated by finds of studded antler cheek-pieces (for controlling chariot horses), burials of paired domesticated horses, and ceramic vessels with images of two-wheeled vehicles on them. The predecessor of the Srubnaya culture, a variant of the Abashevo culture known as the Pokrovka type, is considered to be an important part of the early 'chariot horizon', representing the rapid spread of the 'chariot complex'.\nLanguage\nThe Srubnaya culture is generally considered to have been Iranian. Its area, which coincides with the presence of Iranian hydronyms, has been suggested as a staging region from which the Iranian peoples migrated across the Caucasus into the Iranian Plateau.\nGenetics\n( EHG), Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer ( CHG), Anatolian Neolithic () and Western Hunter Gatherer ( WHG) ancestry.]]\nMathieson et al. (2015) surveyed 14 individuals of the Srubnaya culture. Six men from 5 different cemeteries belonged to the Y-chromosome haplogroup R1a1. Extractions of mtDNA from fourteen individuals were determined to represent five samples of haplogroup H, four samples of haplogroup U5, two samples of T1, one sample of T2, one sample of K1b, one of J2b and one of I1a.\nA 2017 genetic study published in Scientific Reports found that the Scythians shared similar mitochondrial lineages with the Srubnaya culture. The authors of the study suggested that the Srubnaya culture was ancestral to the Scythians.\nIn 2018, a genetic study of the earlier Srubnaya culture, and later peoples of the Scythian cultures, including the Cimmerians, Scythians, Sarmatians, was published in Science Advances. Six males from two sites ascribed to the Srubnaya culture were analysed, and were all found to possess haplogroup R1a1a1. However Cimmerian, Sarmatian and Scythian males were found to carry mostly haplogroup R1b1a1a2, although one Sarmatian male carried haplogroup R1a1a1. The authors of the study suggested that rather than being ancestral to the Scythians, the Srubnaya shared with them a common origin from the earlier Yamnaya culture.\nIn a genetic study published in Science in 2018, the remains of twelve individuals ascribed to the Srubnaya culture was analyzed. Of the six samples of Y-DNA extracted, three belonged to R1a1a1b2 or subclades of it, one belonged to R1, one belonged to R1a1, and one belonged to R1a1a. With regards to mtDNA, five samples belonged to subclades of U, five belonged to subclades of H, and two belonged to subclades of T. People of the Srubnaya culture were found to be closely related to people of the Corded Ware culture, the Sintashta culture, Potapovka culture and the Andronovo culture. }} }} These were found to harbor mixed ancestry from the Yamnaya culture and peoples of the Central European Middle Neolithic. The genetic data suggested that these cultures were ultimately derived of a remigration of Central European peoples with steppe ancestry back into the steppe.}}\nLazaridis et al. (2022), analysed the remains of seven individuals ascribed to the Srubnaya culture. Of the specimens yielding a pigmentation phenotype, 28.6% were predicted as blue eyed, while 14.3% were predicted as blond haired. The skin tone was intermediate for 100% of the examined samples.\nIn a 2023 study, the genomes of an extended Bronze Age family buried at the site of Nepluyevsky, belonging to Srubnaya-Alakul culture and located in Southern Urals, were found to be genetically closely related to the Middle Bronze Age Sintashta individuals, as well as individuals from the Fatyanovo culture from modern-day Russia. The samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to haplogroup R1a-Z94, R1a-Z93, Q-L56, Q-L939 and Q-L933. The samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to the haplogroups K2b1a1, T2b34, H15a1, U2e2a1a2, U5b2c, U2e2a1d, U5a1g1, H3g, H2b, U5b1b, U5a1b1f, H6a1b, U1b2, T1a1, U2e2a1, U4b1a1a, N1a1a1a1, T2b4e and U5a1b1.\nGallery\nFile:Srubnaya ceramic Donets3.png|Ceramic sherd\nFile:Srubna culture05.jpg|Bronze axes\nFile:Srubna culture06.jpg|Horse bridle items\nImage:Srubna hut.jpg|Reconstructed Srubnaya hut\nFile:Kurgan.png|Timber grave and tumulus\nFile:Dispersion of double-horse burials ca. 2000 to 1400-1300 BCE.png|Dispersion of double-horse burials ca. 2000–1400/1300 BCE.
