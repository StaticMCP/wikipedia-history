In this case, it is a biblical quotation from the First Epistle of Peter (5:8): Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.  The French title is more apposite, referring to an aspect of the werewolf myth that plays some part in the story, that the werewolf when in human form is wearing the wolfskin inside out.  An alleged werewolf may therefore be exposed by cutting (generally fatally), when wolf-hair will be seen in the wound.\nRecognition\nIn 2004, it became the second of her novels to be translated into English (by award-winning translator David Bellos), and was shortlisted for the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger.\nReception\nA reviewer for Publishers Weekly wrote \"the unusual cast of characters and off-beat humor should help Vargas win new fans.\"\nWhile Kirkus Reviews commended the author for creating \"a notably intriguing policeman in Adamsberg ... whose story this time draws you in and keeps you guessing until the dazzling dénouement.\"\nReferences"
