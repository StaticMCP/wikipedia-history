      "text": "# The Battle Pavane\n\nThe Battle Pavane (alternative spelling: Battle Pavan) is an instrumental piece by Tielman Susato which he published in 1551 in alderhande Danserye, a collection of Renaissance dance music.\n, Bob Margolis' arrangement of it has gained mass popularity among high school wind ensembles in the USA. The piece is often played by Renaissance-style bands and always features a large trumpet part. The piece begins with a melody based around repeated pitches, with the rhythm half-quarter-quarter in modern notation (minim, crotchet, crotchet). It ends with a fanfare of rapidly repeated sixteenth notes in modern notation (semiquavers). This piece is very typical of the mid-sixteenth century court music  and would have been played by consorts of instruments of the same type, like sackbutts and cornetts, shawms, viols, recorders, and possible also by mixed consorts.\nReferences"
