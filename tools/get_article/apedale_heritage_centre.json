It is located just outside the village of Chesterton near Newcastle-under-Lyme in the Apedale Community Country Park.\nAttractions include mine tours and a museum which concentrates on the area's history, and industrial heritage. Opening times are 10:30 to 16:00 daily with the underground tours taking place on weekends and bank holidays.\nThe site is also the home of the Moseley Railway Trust's collection of narrow gauge industrial locomotives.  A selection of locomotives can be viewed in the heritage centre museum and the trust holds open days for the public.  Work is under way to construct a separate museum and railway for the collection. Construction began in 2025.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.apedale.co.uk/ Apedale Heritage Centre]\n*[http://www.mrt.org.uk/ The Moseley Railway Trust]"
