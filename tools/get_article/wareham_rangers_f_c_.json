The Senior team have a long history of playing county league football.\nHistory\nWareham Rangers F.C. were founded in 1896 and spent their early days playing friendly fixtures before joining the Dorset Football League, where they held membership for many years.\nIn 1957, Wareham Rangers became founder members of the Dorset Combination and won the League Cup in 1963, after a thrilling 4–3 win over Portland United Reserves. They were losing finalists the following two seasons. In 1968 they were relegated, but returned three years later. Although they frequently struggled in the league, Wareham performed better in the cups, twice more reaching the league cup final and the 1978 Dorset Senior Cup final, when they were beaten by a strong Weymouth side.\nIn 2002, the Dorset Combination became known as the Dorset Premier League, but four years later Wareham finished bottom of the table and were relegated. After a spell of rebuilding, they were promoted back in 2012. This time, their form improved and they finished fifth, equalling their highest final position (achieved twice previously).\nTragedy struck in November 2022 when first team coach Rob Braid passed away on a match day. The trauma and suddenness of the incident shook the club to such a point that it was necessary for the well-being of everyone involved to withdraw and come to terms with the tragic events.\nWareham continued to operate in the Dorset League, maintaining the Reserves position in Division 1, which had recently been strengthened by an influx of new clubs from the now defunct Bournemouth League. In 2025 they were promoted to the Senior Division and relaunched their youth section. Their efforts in promoting a calmer mindset has been recognised by the Dorset FA.\nHonours\n*Dorset Football Association\n**Senior Cup Finalists 1977/78\n*Dorset Premier League\n**League Cup Winners 1962/63, Finalists 1963/64, 1964/65, 1980/81 and 1989/90\n*Dorset League\n**Senior Division Runners-up 2011/12\n**Division 1 Runners-up 2024/25\n**Veterans League Champions 2018/19\nDorset Premier League Career\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center\n!Season\n!Position\n!Significant events\n|-\n|1957/58|| ?||\n|-\n|1958/59|| ?||\n|-\n|1959/60|| ?||\n|-\n|1960/61|| ?||\n|-\n|1961/62|| ?||\n|-\n|1962/63|| ?||League Cup winners\n|-\n|1963/64|| ?||League Cup finalists\n|-\n|1964/65|| ?||League Cup finalists\n|-\n|1965/66|| ?||\n|-\n|1966/67|| ?||\n|-\n|1967/68|| ?||Relegated\n|-\n|1968-71|| - ||\n|-\n|1971/72|| ?||\n|-\n|1972/73|| ?||\n|-\n|1973/74|| ?||\n|-\n|1974/75|| ?||\n|-\n|1975/76|| ?||\n|-\n|1976/77|| ?||\n|-\n|1977/78|| ?||Dorset Senior Cup Finalists\n|-\n|1978/79|| ?||\n|-\n|1979/80||9/18||\n|-\n|1980/81||6/18||\n|-\n|1981/82||11/18||\n|-\n|1982/83||7/18||\n|-\n|1983/84||9/18||\n|-\n|1984/85||10/18||\n|-\n|1985/86||12/18||\n|-\n|1986/87||17/18||\n|-\n|1987/88||6/19||\n|-\n|1988/89||11/18||\n|-\n|1989/90||14/17||League Cup finalists\n|-\n|1990/91||17/18||\n|-\n|1991/92||15/19||\n|-\n|1992/93||18/20||\n|-\n|1993/94||19/20||\n|-\n|1994/95||5/20||\n|-\n|1995/96||5/20||\n|-\n|1996/97||14/19||\n|-\n|1997/98||17/19||\n|-\n|1998/99||17/19||\n|-\n|1999/00||13/19||\n|-\n|2000/01||7/18||\n|-\n|2001/02||15/18||\n|-\n|2002/03||10/18||Competition renamed\n|-\n|2003/04||14/17||\n|-\n|2004/05||14/17||\n|-\n|2005/06||18/18||Relegated\n|-\n|2006-12|| - ||\n|-\n|2012/13||10/18||\n|-\n|2013/14||5/17||\n|-\n|2014/15||9/18||\n|-\n|2015/16||15/17||\n|-\n|2016/17||11/17||\n|-\n|2017/18||16/17||\n|-\n|2018/19||17/17||Re-elected\n|-\n|2019/20||  - ||season abandoned due to pandemic\n|-\n|2020/21||  - ||season abandoned due to pandemic\n|-\n|2021/22||17/18||\n|-\n|2022/23||18/18||Left competition\n|}\nGround\nWareham Rangers Football Club play at Purbeck Sports Centre, Wareham, Dorset, BH20 4PN.\nThe venue is owned by Dorset County Council.
