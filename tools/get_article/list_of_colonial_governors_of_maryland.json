When the Catholic King of England, James II, was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, the Calverts lost their charter and Maryland became a royal colony. It was governed briefly by local Protestants before the arrival of the first of 12 governors appointed directly by the English crown. The royal charter was restored to the Calverts in 1715 and governors were again appointed by the Calverts through the American Revolution.\nColonial period\nThis list includes appointed governors, including those briefly appointed by the Cromwellian government, but excludes those who claimed themselves as governors of the colony without a formal appointment from London.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\n!Name\n!Picture\n!Took office\n!Left office\n|-\n!colspan=5|Proprietary governors\n|-\n|1\n|Leonard Calvert\n|\n|1634\n|1647\n|-\n|2\n|Thomas Greene\n|\n|1647\n|1649\n|-\n|3\n|William Stone\n|Stone\n|1649\n|March 28, 1652\n|-\n|4\n|Rev.
