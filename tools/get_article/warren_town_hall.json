The Renaissance Revival structure was built in 1900 to a design by Henry Hyde Dwight. The previous town hall, an 1879 Richardsonian Romanesque building was heavily damaged by fire, and its shell formed part of the framework for the new building. The old building was faced in buff-colored brick and extended a further thirty feet, making the building  long and  wide. The old building's north tower was completely rebuilt, and the building's interior was completely new. The main entrance is sheltered by a portico supported by six Doric columns.\nThe building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.\nSee also\n*National Register of Historic Places listings in Worcester County, Massachusetts\nReferences"
