It has mostly smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white flowers and cup-shaped or hemispherical fruit.\nDescription\nEucalyptus nandewarica is a tree or mallee that typically grows to a height of  and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, greyish bark mottled with other colours, sometimes with some rough, fibrous bark near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull green, lance-shaped leaves that are  long and  wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, the same shade of dull light green on both sides,  long and  wide tapering to a petiole  long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of three or seven in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle  long, the individual buds on pedicels up to  long. Mature buds are oval to diamond-shaped,  long and about  wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been observed in December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped or hemispherical capsule  long and  wide with the valves protruding strongly.\nTaxonomy and naming\nEucalyptus nandewarica was first formally described in 1990 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal Telopea, from specimens collected in the Mount Kaputar National Park in 1986. The specific epithet (nandewarica) refers to the Nandewar Range where this species occurs.\nDistribution and habitat\nMallee red gum grows in mallee shrubland in the Nandewar Ranges, the Warrumbungle Range and nearby ridges.\nReferences"
