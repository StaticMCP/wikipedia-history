The grrrls in the post-punk Brooklyn band Triple-Crème are not afraid of a little heavy bass or some catchy guitar riffs. They’re also not afraid to kick your ass.\" Christa Martin of GT Weekly says \"This colorful romp in high school antics and edginess is a wild ride of a music video.\"\nElaine Mak of New England Film said that \"award-winning director Leah Meyerhoff has built up a large list of accomplishments as a filmmaker\" and Flavorpill writes: \"post-punk lez rockers Triple Creme enlisted the brightest and most buoyant of New York's burlesque scene to star in the new music video for their single Team Queen.\"\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.teamqueen.com/ Team Queen official site]\n*[http://www.triplecreme.com/ Triple Creme official site]"
