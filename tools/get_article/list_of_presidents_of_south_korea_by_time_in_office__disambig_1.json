The basis of the list is the difference between dates; if counted by number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater.\nOf the elected individuals, three resigned from office (Rhee Syng-man, Yun Po-sun, and Choi Kyu-hah,) one was assassinated (Park Chung Hee,) and two were impeached and removed (Yoon Suk Yeol and Park Geun-hye.)\nChoi Kyu-hah spent the shortest time as president, while Park Chung Hee spent the longest. Park is the only president to have served more than three terms in office. Following the ratification of the Presidential Election Act of 1987, presidents—starting with Roh Tae-woo, have been limited to a single five-year term. Chun Doo-hwan, the incumbent in 1987, was blocked from serving a third term, which had he been re-elected, would last from 1988–1995.\nWhile there have been 14 total presidents of South Korea, 21 terms have been served; Rhee, Park, and Chun Doo-hwan have served multiple terms.\nRank by time in office\nKey:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
