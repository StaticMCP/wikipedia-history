In 1983, it opened a production facility in Panama City, Florida. The firm was sold to  Yamaha in 1995, and in 2012, it was acquired by Allcraft Marine of Florida. Following its bankruptcy in 2025, a Florida-based organization has assumed management.\nHistory\nThe Century Boat Company was founded in 1926 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by two brothers, James and William Welch, who specialized in building wooden plank hulls for speed.\nThe company moved to Manistee, Michigan, in 1928. By 1930, the company produced 1,000 boats. It expanded into new outboard-powered models.\nIn September 1931, five Century hulls set a series of official world speed records, powered by Johnson or Evinrude outboard motors.

In 2012, Allcraft Marine, based in Dade City, Florida, purchased and revived the brand with a line of saltwater fishing and family boats. Allcraft Marine sold a controlling interest in Century Boats to Sorfam Capital in March 2020.\nThe business filed Chapter 11 in early 2025.
