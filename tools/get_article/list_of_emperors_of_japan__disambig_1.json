      "text": "# List of emperors of Japan__disambig_1\n\nJapan has been ruled by emperors since antiquity. The sequence, order and dates of the early emperors are almost entirely based on the 8th-century Nihon Shoki, which was meant to retroactively legitimise the Imperial House by dating its foundation further back to the year 660 BC. Emperor Kinmei () is often considered the first historical emperor, but the first Japanese ruler supported by historical evidence is actually Emperor Yūryaku (), who is mentioned in the 5th-century Inariyama and Eta Funayama Swords. According to Chinese sources, the unification of Japan took place between the 2nd and 3rd centuries.\nThe terms Tennō ('Emperor', 天皇), as well as Nihon ('Japan', 日本), were not adopted until the late 7th century AD. In the nengō system which has been in use since the late 7th century, years are numbered using the Japanese era name and the number of years which have elapsed since the start of that nengō era.\nEmperors of Japan\nAncient Japan\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! class=\"unsortable\" | Portrait\n! scope=\"col\" | Personal name\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"200px\" class=\"unsortable\" | Reign and era names Regnal years are counted using inclusive reckoning until Empress Jitō, the last reign covered by the Nihon Shoki.}}\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"275px\" class=\"unsortable\" | Life details\n|-\n|\n|\n| Hikohohodemi\n| Emperor Jimmu\n| 660–585 BC\n| 721 or 711–585 BC\nSon of kami Ugayafukiaezu.
