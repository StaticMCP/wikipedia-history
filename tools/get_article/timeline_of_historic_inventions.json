This page lists nonincremental inventions that are widely recognized by reliable sources as having had a direct impact on the course of history that was profound, global, and enduring. The dates in this article make frequent use of the units mya and kya, which refer to millions and thousands of years ago, respectively.\nPaleolithic\nThe dates listed in this section refer to the earliest evidence of an invention found and dated by archaeologists (or in a few cases, suggested by indirect evidence). Dates are often approximate and change as more research is done, reported and seen. Older examples of any given technology are often found. The locations listed are for the site where the earliest solid evidence has been found, but especially for the earlier inventions, there is little certainty how close that may be to where the invention took place.\nLower Paleolithic\nThe Lower Paleolithic period lasted over 3 million years, during which there many human-like species evolved including toward the end of this period, Homo sapiens. The original divergence between humans and chimpanzees occurred 13 (Mya), however interbreeding continued until as recently as 4 Mya, with the first species clearly belonging to the human (and not chimpanzee) lineage being Australopithecus anamensis.  Some species are controversial among paleoanthropologists, who disagree whether they are species on their own or not. Here Homo ergaster is included under Homo erectus, while Homo rhodesiensis is included under Homo heidelbergensis.\nDuring this period the Quaternary glaciation began (about 2.58 million years ago), and continues to today. It has been an ice age, with cycles of 40–100,000 years alternating between long, cold, more glaciated periods, and shorter warmer periods – interglacial episodes.\n* 3.3 Mya – 2.6 Mya: Stone tools - found in modern-day Kenya are older and only found on the archetype road. Ancient stone tools from Ethiopia (Oldowan) were hand-crafted by Australopithecus or related people.\n* 2.3 Mya: Earliest likely control of fire and cooking, by Homo habilis\n* 1.76 Mya: Advanced (Acheulean) stone tools in Kenya by Homo erectus\n* 1.75 Mya – 150 kya: Varying estimates for the origin of language\n* 1.5 Mya: Bone tools in Africa by Homo erectus and/or Paranthropus boisei\n* 900 kya – 40 kya: Boats\n* 500 kya: Hafting in South Africa by Homo heidelbergensis\n* 500 kya – 450 kya: Woodworking construction in Zambia by Homo heidelbergensis (The oldest known surviving buildings are made from stone and date back no more than 9,500 years.)\n* 420 – 200 kya: Food storage in the form of uncracked bones saved for their marrow in Qesem cave, Israel.\n* 400 kya: Hide and leather  clothing, footwear and shelter.\n* 400 kya: Pigments in Zambia by Homo heidelbergensis\n* 337 kya – 300 kya: Schöningen Spears in Germany likely by Homo heidelbergensis or early Neandarthals.\n* 320 kya: The trade and long-distance (up to 50 miles) transportation of resources (e.g. obsidian), use of pigments, and possible making of projectile points in Kenya\nMiddle Paleolithic\nThe evolution of early modern humans around 300 kya coincides with the start of the Middle Paleolithic period. During this 250,000-year period, our related archaic humans such as Neanderthals and Denisovans began to spread out of Africa, joined later by Homo sapiens. Over the course of the period we see evidence of increasingly long-distance trade, religious rites, and other behavior associated with Behavioral modernity.\n* 279 kya: Hafting and early stone-tipped projectile weapons in Ethiopia\n* 200 kya: Simple glue (adhesive) made of one kind of material, birch tar, in Central Italy by Neanderthals.\n* 200 kya: Beds in South Africa.\n* 170 kya – 90 kya: Clothing, among anatomically modern humans in Africa. Genetic evidence from body lice suggests a range of dates centering over 100 thousand years ago. The first bone scrapers appropriate for scraping hides to make supple leather were found in Morocco dating to 90–120,000 years ago.\n* 164 kya – 47 kya: Heat treating of stone blades in South Africa.\n* 135 kya – 100 kya: Beads in Israel and Algeria — implying string or thread\n* 100 kya: Ochre processed, and compound paints made in South Africa\n* 100 kya: Funerals (in the form of burial) in Israel\n* 90 kya: Harpoons in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n* 70 kya – 60 kya in Sibudu Cave in South Africa by Homo sapiens:\n** Compound adhesives\n** Arrows and other evidence of bow-and-arrow technology\n** Sewing needle (implying thread of some kind)\n* 61 kya – 62 kya: Cave painting in Spain by Neanderthal\n* 55.8–51.2 kya: Representational and Narrative art in Indonesia by Homo sapiens\nUpper Paleolithic to Early Mesolithic\n50 kya was long regarded as the beginning of behavioral modernity, which defined the Upper Paleolithic period. The Upper Paleolithic lasted nearly 40,000 years, while research continues to push the beginnings of behavioral modernity earlier into the Middle Paleolithic. Behavioral modernity is characterized by the widespread observation of religious rites, artistic expression and the appearance of tools made for purely intellectual or artistic pursuits.\n* 49 kya – 30 kya: Ground stone tools – fragments of an axe in Australia date to 49–45 ka, more appear in Japan closer to 30 ka, and elsewhere closer to the Neolithic.\n* 47 kya: The oldest-known mines in the world are from Eswatini, and extracted hematite for the production of the red pigment ochre.\n* 45 kya – 9 kya: Earliest evidence of shoes, suggested by changes in foot bone morphology in China by Tianyuan man. The earliest physical shoes found so far are bark sandals dated to 10 to 9 kya in Fort Rock Cave, United States. The oldest known leather shoe dated to 5.5 kya was found in excellent condition in the Areni-1 cave located in the Vayots Dzor province of Armenia.\n* 44 kya – 42 kya: Tally sticks (see Lebombo bone) in Eswatini\n* 42 kya: Flute in Germany\n* 37 kya: Mortar and pestle in Southwest Asia\n* 32-28 kya: Rope and Cords for \"hafting stone tools, weaving baskets, or sewing garments,\" according to Elis Kvavadze et al.\n* 31 kya: Amputation and surgery. Medicine in a meaningful sense likely predates the human-chimpanzee split, as, for example, herbal medicine has been observed in other primates.\n* 28 kya: Ceramics (direct evidence) and weaving (impressions left in the ceramics) in Moravia (Czech Republic) and Georgia. (The oldest piece of woven cloth found so far was in Çatalhöyük, Turkey and dated to about 9,000 years ago.)\n* 24 kya: Oldest known ceramic sculpture\n* 23 kya: Domestication of the dog in Siberia.\n* 22 – 17 kya Bullroarer\n* 22 kya: Fish hook in Okinawa Island, modern day Japan.\n* 21 – 3.7 kya: Star chart in France, and later Spain, Kashmir, Germany, and Egypt.\n* 20 – 16 kya: Pottery in China\n* 17.5 kya: Spear-thrower (atlatl), found in France.\n* 14.5 kya: Bread in Jordan\n* 12 kya: Spindle whorl, also the oldest wheel-like tool, at Nahal Ein Gev II (Israel)\nAgricultural and proto-agricultural eras\nThe end of the Last Glacial Period (\"ice age\") and the beginning of the Holocene around 11.7 ka coincide with the Agricultural Revolution, marking the beginning of the agricultural era, which persisted there until the industrial revolution.\nNeolithic and Late Mesolithic\nDuring the Neolithic period, lasting 8400 years, stone began to be used for construction, and remained a predominant hard material for toolmaking. Copper and arsenic bronze were developed towards the end of this period, and of course the use of many softer materials such as wood, bone, and fibers continued. Domestication spread both in the sense of how many species were domesticated, and how widespread the practice became.\n* 10,000 BC – 9000 BC: Agriculture in the Fertile Crescent\n* 10,000 BC – 9000 BC: Domestication of sheep in Southwest Asia (followed shortly by pigs, goats and cattle)\n* 9500 BC – 9000 BC: Oldest known surviving building – Göbekli Tepe, in Turkey\n* 9000 BC – 6000 BC: Domestication of rice in China\n* 9000 BC: Mudbricks (unfired bricks), and clay mortar in Jericho.\n* 8400 BC: Oldest known water well in Cyprus.\n* 8040–7510 BC: The Pesse canoe is the oldest boat we have found, while early human habitation of Crete and Australia make clear human seafaring goes back tens or hundreds of thousands of years.

Perhaps the oldest known dice, resembling modern ones, were excavated as part of a backgammon-like game set at the Burnt City, an archeological site in south-eastern Iran, estimated to be from between 2800 and 2500 BC. Later, terracotta dice were used at the Indus Valley site of Mohenjo-daro (modern-day Pakistan).\n* 3000 BC: Tin extraction in Central Asia\n* 3000 BC – 2560 BC: Papyrus in Egypt\n* 3000 BC: Reservoir in Girnar, Indus Valley.\n* 3000 BC: Receipt in Ancient Mesopotamia (Iraq)\n* 3000 BC – 2800 BC: Prosthesis first documented in the Ancient Near East, in ancient Egypt and Iran, specifically for an eye prosthetics, the eye found in Iran was likely made of bitumen paste that was covered with a thin layer of gold.\n* 3000 BC – 2500 BC: Rhinoplasty in Egypt.\n* 2650 BC: The Ruler, or Measuring rod, in the subdivided Nippur, copper rod, of the Sumerian Civilisation (modern-day Iraq).}}\n* 2600 BC: Planned city in Indus Valley.\n* 2600 BC: Public sewage and sanitation systems in Indus Valley sites such as Mohenjo-daro and Rakhigarhi.\n* 2600 BC: Public bath in Mohenjo-daro, Indus Valley (modern-day Pakistan).\n* 2600 BC: Levee in Indus Valley.\n* 2600 BC: Balance weights and scales, from the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt; examples of Deben (unit) balance weights, from reign of Sneferu (c. 2600 BC) have been attributed.\n* 2556 BC: Docks structure in Wadi al-Jarf, Egypt, which was developed by the reign of the Pharaoh Khufu. constructed at some point between 2400-2000 BC; however, more precise dating does not exist.}}\n* 2500 BC: Puppetry in the Indus Valley.\n* 2400 BC: Fork in Bronze Age Qijia culture in China\n* 2400 BC: Copper pipes, the Pyramid of Sahure, an adjoining temple complex at Abusir, was discovered to have a network of copper drainage pipes.\n* 2400 BC: Touchstone in the Indus Valley site of Banawali (modern-day India).\n* 2300 BC: Dictionary in Mesopotamia.\n* 2200 BC – 2000 BC: Iron smelting in Kaman-Kalehöyük.\n* 2200 BC: Protractor, Phase IV, Lothal, Indus Valley (modern-day India), a Xancus shell cylinder with sawn grooves, at right angles, in its top and bottom surfaces, has been proposed as an angle marking tool.\n* 2000 BC: Water clock by at least the old Babylonian period (c. 2000 – c. 1600 BC), but possibly earlier from Mohenjo-Daro in the Indus Valley.\n* 2000 BC: Chariot in Russia and Kazakhstan\n* 2000 BC: Scissors, in Mesopotamia.\n* 1850 BC: Proto-alphabet (Proto-Sinaitic script) in Egypt.\n* 1600 BC: Surgical treatise appeared in Egypt.\n* 1500 BC: Sundial in Ancient Egypt or Babylonia (modern-day Iraq).\n* 1500 BC: Glass manufacture in either Mesopotamia or Ancient Egypt.\n* 1500 BC: Seed drill in Babylonia.\n* 1400 BC: Rubber, Mesoamerican ballgame.\n* 1400 BC – 1200 BC: Concrete in Tiryns (Mycenaean Greece),\n* 1300 BC: Lathe in Ancient Egypt.\n* 1200 BC: Distillation is described on Akkadian tablets documenting perfumery operations.\nIron Age\nThe Late Bronze Age collapse occurs around 1200 BC, extinguishing most Bronze-Age Near Eastern cultures, and significantly weakening the rest. This is coincident with the complete collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation. This event is followed by the beginning of the Iron Age. We define the Iron Age as ending in 510 BC for the purposes of this article, even though the typical definition is region-dependent (e.g. 510 BC in Greece, 322 BC in India, 200 BC in China), thus being an 800-year period.\n*  1100 BC Star catalogue — Three Stars Each is the earliest known catalogue in long-running tradition of Babylonian astronomy, likely drawing on Sumerian and/or Elamite constellations.\n* 700 BC: Saddle (fringed cloths or pads used by Assyrian cavalry).\n* 7th century BC: The royal Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh had 30,000 clay tablets, in several languages, organized according to shape and separated by content.
