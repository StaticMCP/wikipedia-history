The Congo lacks good transport networks and along with its political instability, civil war, and the extreme poverty of the country, it is difficult for it to maintain a proper national league structure.\nLike many African countries, the historical connection with France is a mixed blessing. For a number of years, Congolese rugby players would leave to play there, which deprived rugby in the Congo of any real competition.\nSee also\n* Republic of the Congo national rugby union team\n* Confederation of African Rugby\n* Africa Cup\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://carugby.com/ CAR]\n* [http://www.pointenoirealive.com/content/15032009-premier-championnat-de-rugby-du-congo-brazzaville-%C3%A0-pointe-noire Premier championnat de rugby du Congo Brazzaville, à Pointe Noire]\n* [http://wesclark.com/rrr/islamic_rugby.html \"Islam and Rugby\" on the Rugby Readers review]"
