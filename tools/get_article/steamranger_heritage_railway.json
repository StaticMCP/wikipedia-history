It is operated by the not-for-profit South Australian Division of the Australian Railway Historical Society. As the last operating non-suburban line of the former broad-gauge network, on which Australia's first public railway was opened, the line and its associated rail assets have high historical significance.\nHistory\nIn the 1970s, the South Australian Division of the Australian Railway Historical Society established SteamRanger as a not-for-profit railway preservation offshoot to operate its train tours from Adelaide, mainly on rural lines throughout the state's broad-gauge networks. SteamRanger opened their first purpose-built depot at Dry Creek railway station,  north of Adelaide in 1980. From the mid-1980s, SteamRanger gradually took over the operation and maintenance of the Victor Harbor railway line in the Adelaide Hills.\nWhen plans were announced for the Adelaide to Melbourne line to be converted to  standard gauge, SteamRanger had to choose between staying at Dry Creek and losing its investment in the Victor Harbor line, or move and become isolated from Adelaide's suburban railway lines. Since the first choice would break the society's financial viability, in a huge project all of SteamRanger's locomotives and rolling stock were moved.\nA new depot was built at Mount Barker railway station, at the northern end of the broad-gauge line to Victor Harbor. As part of the move, the District Council of Mount Barker renovated the station building, derelict at the time, to become SteamRanger's headquarters. Conversion of the interstate line was completed in 1995 as part of the One Nation infrastructure upgrade program. Following that most of South Australia's broad-gauge tracks have been closed, the line has become the last operating memory of locomotive-hauled trains on the broad gauge.\nServices\n, scheduled SteamRanger trips were as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable floatleft mw-collapsible mw-uncollapsed\" border= \"1\" style= \"width:95%; font-size: 86%; float:left; margin-left:2em; margin-right:2em; margin-bottom:2em\"\n! scope=\"col\"|Name\n! scope= \"col\"|Between (round&nbsp;trips)\n! scope= \"col\"|Distance and&nbsp;time (round trips)\n! scope= \"col\"|Days\n! scope= \"col\"|Steam or diesel?\n! scope= \"col\" |Notes\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|Cockle Train– off peak\n|\t|Goolwa and Victor Harbor\n|\t|.About 1 hour, 30 minutes.\n|\t|Most Wednesdays and weekends\n|\t|Heritage diesel locomotives or railcars*\n|\t|Buy tickets on day of travel at SteamRanger stations (does not have reserved seats)\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|Cockle Train– during school holidays\n|\t|As above\n|\t| As above\n|\t|Every day during school holidays\n|\t|Normally steam locomotives; diesel when a total fire ban for the Mount Lofty Ranges is in force*\n|\t|As above\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|Southern Encounter\n|\t|Mount Barker to Victor Harbor\n|\t.About 8 hours 45 minutes including 2 hours 40 minutes lunch and several 10-minute stops.\n|\t|First, third and fifth Sundays May to November\n|\t|Steam locomotives\n|\t|Bookings essential**\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|Hills Encounter\n|\t|Victor Harbor to Mount Barker\n|\t|.About 8 hours including 2 hours 20 minutes lunch.\n|\t|As on [https://www.steamrangerheritagerailway.org/our-trains/thehills-encounter/ website]\n|\t|Normally steam locomotives; diesel when a total fire ban for the Mount Lofty Ranges is in force*\n|\t|Passengers can optionally leave train at Strathalbyn for lunch and shopping then join return trip.
