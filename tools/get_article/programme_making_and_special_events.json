In North America, the use of spectrum to provide these services is usually called broadcast auxiliary service or BAS.\nTypical examples include theatrical wireless-microphone use, wireless-camera newsgathering operations and fixed point-to-point microwave links. The most significant PMSE users are those who use wireless microphones, talkback systems and/or in-ear monitors.\nThese devices operate in various spectrum bands. Traditionally, most PMSE equipment uses spectrum that is interleaved with other existing services. This is possible due to their low radiated power, thus making efficient use of the spectrum. Most used spectrum bands are the broadcasting bands (Band III and Bands IV/V) and military spectrum between roughly 1 and 5 GHz.\nWithin broadcasting, these applications are commonly known as SAB/SAP applications.\nSpecial Event equipment is different from that used in broadcasting and may include more extensive use of lighting and sound equipment.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.telecomabc.com/p/pmse.html Telecom ABC]"
