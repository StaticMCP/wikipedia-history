It was raised from men volunteering for Lord Kitchener's New Armies and assigned to the 32nd Division. The brigade, initially composed of three service battalions (the 14th, 15th and 16th, the Birmingham Pals) of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and one (the 12th, Bristol's Own) of the Gloucestershire Regiment, was sent to the Western Front in November 1915, where it was to serve for most of the war, and later briefly on the Italian Front in late 1917 before returning to the Western Front in April 1918.
