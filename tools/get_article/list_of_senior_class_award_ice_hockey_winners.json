      "text": "# List of Senior CLASS Award ice hockey winners\n\nThe Senior CLASS Award is presented each year to the outstanding senior NCAA Division I Student-Athlete of the Year in men's ice hockey. The award was established in 2007.\nSo far, no women's version of this award has been created. Three NCAA sports that are sponsored for both men and women have Senior CLASS Awards for only one sex—ice hockey and lacrosse do not have women's awards, and volleyball does not have a men's award.\nRecipients\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Winner\n!School\n!\n|-\n|2007\n|David Brown\n|Notre Dame\n|\n|-\n|2008\n|Landis Stankievech\n|Princeton\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Jeff Lerg\n|Michigan State\n|\n|-\n|2010\n|Colin Greening\n|Cornell\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Jacques Lamoureux\n|Air Force\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Jack Connolly\n|Minnesota–Duluth\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Cheyne Rocha\n|Army\n|\n|-\n|2014\n|Brock Higgs\n|Rensselaer\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Spiro Goulakos\n|Colgate\n|\n|-\n|2016\n|David Glen\n|Penn State\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|Brendan Harms\n|Bemidji State\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Jake Evans\n|Notre Dame\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|Kyle Haak\n|Air Force\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Nolan Nicholas\n|Alaska Anchorage\n|\n|-\n|2021\n|Jordan Kawaguchi\n|North Dakota\n|\n|-\n|2022\n|Zach Driscoll\n|North Dakota\n|\n|}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*[http://www.seniorclassaward.com/hockey/ Official site]"
