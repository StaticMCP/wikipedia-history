Kinsale King's first stakes win was in the Vernon O. Underwood Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack on December 6. He followed that up by winning the Grade 2 Palos Verdes Handicap on January 23, 2010. He won at odds of 9:1 while defeating Breeder's Cup Sprint winner Dancing in Silks. Kinsale King came to fame when he earned his third straight stakes win in the Dubai Golden Shaheen on March 27. His win continued the United States' dominance in that race in which they had won nine of the past eleven renewals. Kinsale King's next race was on June 19 at Ascot Racecourse in the Golden Jubilee Stakes on turf. He finished third by a head to the longshot Society Rock having been on the heels of Starspangledbanner, the eventual winner.\nThe 2016 film Chasing the Win is all about Kinsale King's racing career.\nReferences\n* [http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbHorseInfo.cfm?refno=7515659&registry=T Kinsale King's pedigree and racing stats]"
