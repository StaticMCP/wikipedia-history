USA Today called the album \"powerful yet nuanced, a kind of rock confident enough in itself that it rarely needs force to make its point.\" Consequence of Sound was less charitable, saying \"It’s a record that largely eschews typical hard rock fare, opting instead for a blues rock that slinks and wafts as much as it crunches and blusters.\"\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Jeff Angell and Barrett Martin, except as noted.\nPersonnel\n;Walking Papers\n*Jeff Angell – lead vocals, guitar, piano\n*Duff McKagan – bass, backing vocals\n*Benjamin Anderson – keyboards, backing vocals\n*Barrett Martin – drums, percussion, upright bass, keyboards, backing vocals\nAdditional musicians\n*Mike McCready – Guitar solo on tracks 2 and 8\n*Dave Carter – Trumpet on tracks 4 and 10\n*Dan Spalding – Baritone sax on tracks 4 and 8\n*Ed Ulman – Trombone on track 4\nReferences"
