The packaging includes a fully illustrated book in a box, with the design of each individual CD resembling those of the late 1960s British record labels Deram, Reaction and Immediate, and Shel Talmy's Planet Records. The liner notes are by Bomp's Greg Shaw.\nCritical reception\nEntertainment Weekly wrote that \"its melodious late-’60s clamor pays tribute less to the cool of the Beatles and Stones than to the alienation of the Who and the Kinks—with a nod to the American garage.\" The New York Times wrote: \"This follow-up to the 1998 boxed set of classic American garage-rock and psychedelic nuggets is a highly recommended grab-bag of bad-boy classics and obscurities.\"\nTrack listing\nDisc one\n# \"Making Time\" (The Creation) – 2:58\n# \"Father's Name Is Dad\" (Fire) – 2:29\n# \"I Can Hear the Grass
