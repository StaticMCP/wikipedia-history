      "text": "# Mad'arovce culture\n\nThe '''Mad'arovce culture''' was an archaeological culture of the Early Bronze Age (c. 1750-1500 BC) located in western Slovakia. It formed part of the broader Mad’arovce-Věteřov-Böheimkirchen cultural complex, also found in Austria and Moravia, which had links with Mycenaean Greece. There was a gradual evolution from the preceding Únětice and Hatvan cultures to the Mad'arovce culture from c. 2000 BC to 1750 BC, and it was succeeded by the Tumulus culture after 1500 BC. The Mad'arovce culture is sometimes considered to be a sub-group in the final Únětice tradition. Important sites include the fortified settlements of Fidvár and Nitriansky Hrádok which are described as belonging to a 'Únětice-Maďarovce' archaeological horizon.\n.
