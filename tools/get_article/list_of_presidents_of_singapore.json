Preceded by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, the office of president was created on 22 December 1965 after Singapore's independence in August 1965, with Yang di-Pertuan Negara Yusof Ishak serving as the first president. Under the Constitution, presidents must be a Singaporean citizen, non-partisan, and elected by a popular vote.\nOriginally elected by Parliament, a 1991 constitutional amendment was made to allow for the president to be directly elected by a popular vote, with the 1993 presidential election between Ong Teng Cheong and Chua Kim Yeow being the first time a president was directly elected by popular vote. Singapore follows a non-executive model of the Westminster parliamentary system where the president serves as the head of state, separate to the head of government which is instead served by the Cabinet, led by the prime minister. In 2016, a second constitutional amendment was made that allowed for a presidential election to be reserved for an ethnic community in Singapore if no one from that community had served as president for the last five presidential terms.\nThe role of the president was originally ceremonial and symbolic, carrying residual powers, however the role was later given executive powers such as the reserve power to veto certain bills, most notably in relation to Singapore's reserves as a check and balance process as well as revoking and appointing public service appointments among other powers listed in the Constitution. The president also represents the country at official diplomatic functions, with a 2023 constitutional amendment allowing the president to take up appointments internationally which are of interest of Singapore.\nThere have been nine presidents since Singapore gained independence in 1965. The term of president was previously 4 years, with it being extended to 6 years following the 1991 constitutional amendment. Two presidents, Yusof Ishak and Benjamin Sheares, have died in office; one president, Devan Nair, has resigned mid-term; and the longest serving president is S. R. Nathan, at 12 years over two terms.\nList of presidents\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px #aaf solid;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | No.\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Portrait\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"150\" |Name\n! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Election\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n! width=\"95\" | Took office\n! width=\"95\" | Left office\n! width=\"95\" | Time in office\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |1\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Yusof Ishak\n| rowspan=\"2\" |9 August1965\n| rowspan=\"2\" |23 November1970\n| rowspan=\"2\" |.}}\n| He served in this role as the head of state from 3 December 1959 to 9 August 1965.}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|1967\n|-\n!\n|\n|Yeoh Ghim Seng\n|23 November1970\n|2 January1971\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |2\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Benjamin Sheares\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2 January1971\n| rowspan=\"3\" |12 May1981\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|1970\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\n|-\n|1974\n|-\n|1978\n|-\n!\n|\n|Wee Chong Jin\n|12 May1981\n|14 May1981\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n!\n|\n|Yeoh Ghim Seng\n|14 May1981\n|23 October1981\n|\n|\n|-\n!3\n|\n|Devan Nair\n|23 October1981\n|28 March1985}}\n|\n|1981\n|\n|-\n!\n|\n|Wee Chong Jin\n|28 March1985\n|31 March1985\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n!\n|\n|Yeoh Ghim Seng\n|31 March1985\n|2 September1985\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |4\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Wee Kim Wee\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2 September1985\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1 September1993\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|1985\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|1989\n|-\n!\n|\n|Lim Kim San\n|6 March1989\n|9 March1989\n|\n|\n|-\n!5\n|\n|Ong Teng Cheong\n|1 September1993\n|1 September1999\n| years\n|1993\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |6\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |S.
