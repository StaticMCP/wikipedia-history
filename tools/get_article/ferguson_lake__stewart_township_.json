It is part of the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin.\nFerguson Lake has two unnamed inflows, both at the southwest. The primary outflow is an unnamed creek at the east which flows through several lakes and eventually to the Little Jocko River. The Little Jocko River flows via the Jocko River and the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawrence River.\nThe Ontario Northland Railway passes through the community of Tomiko about  northwest of the lake.\nSee also\n*List of lakes in Ontario\nReferences"
