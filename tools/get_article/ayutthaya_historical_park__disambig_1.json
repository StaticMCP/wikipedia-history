The city of Ayutthaya was founded by King Ramathibodi I in 1351, though it is likely to be significantly older, based on evidence showing that the area was already populated during the Mon Dvaravati period. Sources further mention that around 850 AD, the Khmers occupied the area and established a stronghold there, naming it Ayodhya, after one of the holiest Hindu cities in India of the same name. The early history of Ayutthaya is connected to this Khmer settlement. Additionally, Prince Damrong has also attested to the existence of a city named Ayodhya, founded by the Khmers ruling from Lopburi at the point where the three rivers meet. An excavation map shows traces of an ancient baray (water reservoir) close to the southwestern tip of Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon, which could have been built on a former important Khmer temple complex.\nThe principal basis for the aforementioned claims is the Śri Canāśa Inscription K.949 inscription, which is dated to the reign of Bhagadatta, a ruler of Qiān Zhī Fú who presided over Si Thep in the 850s. This inscription has frequently been cited as evidence for Ayutthaya's early existence. It has been argued, however, that the inscription may have been relocated to Ayutthaya at a considerably later time than that indicated by its original dating, a view supported by the absence of archaeological materials in Ayutthaya that can be securely attributed to the period in question. The earliest extant reference to Ayutthaya is found in the , which attributes the foundation of the city to a nobleman from the northern region in the year 944.\nThe city was captured by the Burmese in 1569. Though not pillaged, it lost \"many valuable and artistic objects\". It was the capital of the country until its destruction by the Burmese army in 1767.\nIn 1969, the Fine Arts Department of Thailand began renovations of the ruins, scaling up the project after the site was declared a historical park in 1976. Part of the park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991.\nPark sites\nWorld Heritage core zone\nThe following monuments are located within the inscribed core zone of the Historic City of Ayutthaya, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.\n* Wat Mahathat\n* Wat Ratchaburana, Ayutthaya\n* Wat Phra Si Sanphet\n* Wat Phra Ram\n* Wat Thammikarat\n* Wat Lokayasutharam\n* Wiharn Phra Mongkhon Bopit\n* Phra Chedi Suriyothai\n* Ayutthaya Historical Study Centre\nPark sites (buffer zone)\nThe following sites lie outside the inscribed area but within the Ayutthaya Historical Park.\n* Wat Chaiwatthanaram\n* Wat Kasatrathiraj\n* Wat Kudi Dao\n* Wat Phanan Choeng\n* Wat Yai Chai Mongkhon\n* Wat Phu Khao Thong\n* Japanese village\n* Baan Hollanda (Dutch village)\n* Elephant camp\nGallery\nThailand - Ayutthaya (24845839706).jpg|Ruins inside Ayutthaya Historical Park\nWat_Phra_Sri_Sanphet,_Ayutthaya_Historical_Park,_Thailand.jpg|Wat Phra Si Sanphet\nTemplo Phra Si Sanphet, Ayutthaya, Tailandia, 2013-08-23, DD 02.jpg|Chedi of Wat Phra Sri Sanphet\nTemplo Mahathat, Ayutthaya, Tailandia, 2013-08-23, DD 08.jpg|Wat Mahathat\nCabeza de Buda en el árbol, Wat Mahathat, Ayutthaya 2.tif|The head of Buddha, Wat Mahathat\nเศียรพระพุทธรูปในรากโพธิ์.jpg|The Buddha head in tree roots\nWat Lokayasutharam (Temple) Ayuthaya, Thailand.jpg|Reclining Buddha at Wat Lokayasutharam\nワット・ラーチャブーラナ.JPG|Wat Ratchaburana\nWat ratchaburana March 2025 25.jpg|Buddha on the prang of Wat Ratchaburana\nTemplo Yanasen, Ayutthaya, Tailandia, 2013-08-23, DD 02.jpg|Wat Yanasen\nTemplo Phra Ram, Ayutthaya, Tailandia, 2013-08-23, DD 04.jpg|Wat Phra Ram\nTemplo Thammikarat, Ayutthaya, Tailandia, 2013-08-23, DD 08.jpg|Wat Thammikarat\nHistoric City of Ayutthaya-111235.jpg|Altar in Wat Chaiwatthanaram\nHistoric City of Ayutthaya-111237.jpg|Headless statues\nSunset at Wat Chaiwatthanaram, Ayutthaya, Thailand.jpg|Wat Chaiwatthanaram\nSee also\n* History of Thailand\n* List of World Heritage Sites in Thailand\n* Ayutthaya Kingdom\n* Si Satchanalai Historical Park\n* Sukhothai Historical Park\n* Si Thep Historical Park\n* Phu Phra Bat Historical Park\n* Ban Chiang\nNotes\n*  The city was founded on Friday, the 6th day of the waxing moon of the 5th month, 1893 Buddhist Era, corresponding to Friday, 4 March 1351 Common Era, according to the calculation of the Fine Arts Department of Thailand.\n*  Calculated based on the text given in the chronicle: \"สิ้น 97 ปีสวรรคต ศักราชได้ 336 ปี พระยาโคดมได้ครองราชสมบัติอยู่ ณ วัดเดิม 30 ปี\" which is transcribed as \"...at the age of 97, he passed away in the year 336 of the Chula Sakarat (corresponding to 974 CE).
