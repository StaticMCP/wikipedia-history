This was supposedly their last album together before they parted ways. \"Sayonara Goodbye\", which features on the album, is a Thai cover of \"Sayonara\" performed by Pat Kirby.\nThe famous songs were \"Sayonara Goodbye,\" \"Oh Yes,\" \"In My Heart,\" \"Go Go Go!,\" and \"Ruu Tao Bang Mai.\" Raptor Monchos Dance Concert, on 4 July 1998 at MBK Hall, was the biggest concert in this album but was not the last concert, as they continued to tour around Thailand throughout July and August 1998.\nThe Raptor's last album, The Memory (May 1998), is a collection of their hits from all of their albums, along with remixes and a special song, \"Kwam Shong Jum (The memory).\"\nGoodbye Concert Sayonara Raptor in 1998 at MBK Hall was their last live performance.\nSolo career\nAnwar's debut solo album, Bad Boy, was released in May 2000.\nAnwar worked together with Montonn Jira [http://www.montonn.com/] and composed a song \"Go Now,\" which received the FAT AWARD: RECORD OF THE YEAR AWARD from 104.5 FAT Radio in 2002.
