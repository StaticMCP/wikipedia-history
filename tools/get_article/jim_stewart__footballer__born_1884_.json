Although Carlton tried recruiting him, Stewart opted to join St Kilda in 1905. He was used as a centreman originally but ended up spending most of his time on a half forward flank and topped St Kilda's goal-kicking in both 1907 and 1908, with 21 and 28 goals respectively. His best effort in 1907 was a seven-goal haul in a win over Geelong at Corio Oval, breaking the club record, which had stood at four goals. He returned to North Melbourne in 1911 and then spent a season with Carlton.\nReferences"
