Per ESPN, on December 14, 2016, Massimino, Keiser University's men's basketball coach, became the third active coach to achieve 800 career wins and the ninth coach overall. Massimino was 82 years old at the time.\nBowling\nWith the backing of the world-famous Kegel Training Center in Lake Wales, Florida, Webber's bowling program has become one of the most successful in the United States. The men's program began in the 2008–2009 season, with a women's program added in the 2009–2010 season. The team has advanced to the national championship tournament in every season in program history.\nThe women's team won the 2010 intercollegiate team championship of the United States Bowling Congress (USBC), held in El Paso, Texas, in its first year as a program. The final was aired on ESPN2 on May 5, 2010. The women's team followed this feat by winning two more USBC national titles in 2012 and 2016.\nIn the 2010–2011 season, the men's team was ranked # 1 for the entire season by the Bowling Writers Association of America and the National Collegiate Bowling Coaches Association (NCBCA). However, at that year's intercollegiate championship tournament in Columbus, Georgia, the team lost to Fresno State in the finals, which later were aired on ESPN2. In 2012 the men's team bounced back to win the USBC national championship. The team also won national USBC championships in 2017 and 2019, although the 2017 result was later vacated due to an ineligible player.\nIn 2009 in its first year as a program, the men's team finished as national semi-finalists, losing to the eventual national champion, Wichita State. Head Coach Slowinski was named the NCBCA National Coach of the Year in 2010, in addition to being a finalist in both 2009 and 2011.\nMen's soccer\nOn October 27, 2010, the Warriors defeated local rivals Warner to win the Crooked Lake Cup and qualify for the 2010 Sun Conference regional tournament. Although the series was tied 2–2 on aggregate, Webber won the conference portion and therefore were awarded the trophy.\nClub teams\nClub sports include bowling and weightlifting.\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
