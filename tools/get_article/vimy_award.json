The \"VIMY AWARD\", a -scale statue of a World War I officer by André Gauthier, was commissioned for the CDA Institute.  The award, first presented in 1991, is given annually in November at a dinner held at the Canadian War Museum. The 2013 Vimy Award went to Brigadier-General Don Macnamara, a former President of the CDA Institute and member of the CDA Institute's Board of Directors; the CDA is the sponsor of the Vimy Award since 1991.
