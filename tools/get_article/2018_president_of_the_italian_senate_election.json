It took place by secret ballot, as required by the assembly's standing orders. Former President of Italy Giorgio Napolitano, being the oldest Senator present, served as the acting presiding officer.\nFollowing an agreement between the centre-right coalition and the Five Star Movement, Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati became the first woman to be elected to the office.\nProcedure\nThe election takes place by secret ballot, as required by the assembly's standing orders. Pursuant to the current rules of procedure, an absolute majority of the whole membership is needed to win on the first ballot. On the second and third ballot, a simple majority of votes cast (including blank ballots among the totals) suffices. If the first three ballots fail to deliver a winner, a runoff is held between the two candidates who got the most votes on the third ballot, with votes for any other candidate deemed invalid and blank ballots not included among the totals. In the event of a tie, the oldest candidate is deemed to have been elected.\nResults\nFirst ballot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Emma Bonino\n|More Europe\n|1\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Roberto Calderoli\n|Lega\n|1\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Fabio Di Micco\n|Five Star Movement\n|1\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Giorgio Napolitano\n|Independent\n|1\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Paolo Romani\n|Forza Italia\n|1\n|-\n|colspan=3|Blank votes\n|312\n|-\n|colspan=3|Did not vote\n|4\n|-\n|colspan=3|Needed to win\n|161\n|}\nSecond ballot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Anna Maria Bernini\n|Forza Italia\n|57\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Emma Bonino\n|More Europe\n|2\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Roberto Calderoli\n|Lega\n|1\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Giorgio Napolitano\n|Independent\n|1\n|-\n|colspan=3|Blank votes\n|255\n|-\n|colspan=3|Invalid votes\n|3\n|-\n|colspan=3|Did not vote\n|3\n|-\n|colspan=3|Needed to win\n|161\n|}\nThird ballot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: align=left\"\n!colspan=2|Candidate\n!Party\n!Votes\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati\n|Forza Italia\n|bgcolor=#CEF6D8|240\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Valeria Fedeli\n|Democratic Party\n|54\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Roberto Calderoli\n|Lega\n|3\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Roberta Pinotti\n|Democratic Party\n|2\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Liliana Segre\n|Independent\n|2\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Maurizio Gasparri\n|Forza Italia\n|1\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Paolo Romani\n|Forza Italia\n|1\n|-\n|bgcolor=|\n|Luigi Zanda\n|Democratic Party\n|1\n|-\n|colspan=3|Blank votes\n|14\n|-\n|colspan=3|Invalid votes\n|1\n|-\n|colspan=3|Did not vote\n|3\n|-\n|colspan=3|Needed to win\n|160\n|}\nSee also\n*2018 President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies election\nNotes\nReferences"
