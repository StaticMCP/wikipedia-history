When the enemy engaged Coventry, strafing her with machine-gun fire, Petty Officer Sephton was mortally wounded, a bullet actually passing through his body and injuring an able seaman beside him. Although in great pain and partially blinded, nevertheless he stuck to his instruments and carried out his duties until the attack was over. He died of his injuries next day.\nThe medal\nSephton's Victoria Cross was stolen from Coventry Cathedral in 1990.\nReferences\n*British VCs of World War 2 (John Laffin, 1997)\n*Monuments to Courage (David Harvey, 1999)\n*The Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997)\nExternal links\n*[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2496712 CWGC entry]\n*[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/valgal/valour/INF3_0427.htm Petty Officer A.E.
