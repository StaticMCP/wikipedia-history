The monument was designed by the sculptor , also known for other works: \"Korobeinik\", \"Assol\", and \"Monument to the first-grader\".\nHistory\nThe monument was opened on September 24, 2014, in honor of the 225th anniversary of the veterinary service of the city, on the eve of an International Veterinary Congress. The date for the anniversary was established basing on a document dated by 1879, found in Rostov archives about the award to  Don Cossack veterinarian Paramonov who risked his life while treating horses of anthrax.\nDescription\nThe monument depicts a smiling bearded man, dressed in an apron, sitting on a simple bench. The doctor gently pets a foal that stands in front of him. The doctor himself is sculptor's impression of Paramonov. The foal was chosen as an animal not by chance – it is a symbol of the Don and new life. On the shoulder of the vet located a bag of tools at the disposal of any farrier of the time. It also has a small hole for donations. The money collected in this way will go to charitable organizations.\nThe monument is located away from the city center, on the Line 16 Street, next to the house 18. In the same house lived a honored veterinarian of the RSFSR . For a long time, he headed the station for treatment of animals, gave official approval and helped in the introduction of various vaccines in the region.\nSee also\n*List of monuments to veterinarians\nReferences"
