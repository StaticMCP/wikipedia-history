      "text": "# Ten de Shōwaru Cupid__disambig_1\n\n}}\n|lead=yes}} is a Japanese romantic comedy manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It was serialized in the Shueisha magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1989 to 1990. Togashi is best known from his later works YuYu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter, also serialized in the same publication.\nPlot\nThe storyline of Ten de Shōwaru Cupid follows , a sweet and introverted 15-year-old who lives with his four stepsisters and their father, the leader of the Koinobori yakuza and promiscuous playboy by heritage, just like his own father, grandfather, and so on. Ryuji's family has a tendency to make fun of his innocent nature, causing the boy to continuously try to run away from home. After escaping one day, Ryuji witnesses a beautiful girl with a devil tail bathing in a forest pool. Embarrassed, Ryuji returns to his home only to be confronted by girl the following day. As it turns out, this devil girl named Maria was hired by Ryuji's father to live with them in order to teach his son \"the pleasures of the flesh\" and make him follow in the family's perverted footsteps.\nCharacters\n;\n: The protagonist of this work. He's the heir to the Koinobori-gumi of the Kanto Daigoku yakuza syndicate and a third-year student at Gokuraku Junior High. Although he's in a position to inherit a yakuza family, he has no intention or spirit to do so (according to  later, it's apparently \"because his mother left all the childcare to others\"). He's pure and longs for fairies and fairytales. He's an irregular existence, arguably the only one born into the Koinobori family without an \"evil soul.\" He's lost interest in real women because he's seen his sisters constantly look down on him and be too insensitive. He has a habit of running away from home frequently, but he always returns quickly.\n: His life is disrupted by , who comes to his home for his rehabilitation, and he gradually becomes attracted to her.\n: He's a member of the art club and has drawn many pictures of his ideal fairy, which he also displays in his room. He's usually an uninspired boy, but once he gets angry (or drinks alcohol or escapes reality), his perverted and violent true nature emerges. In this state, even  can't handle him.\n;\n: The heroine of this work. She moves into the Koinobori household to turn , who has absolutely no interest in real women, into a full-fledged pervert. Her true identity is that of a low-ranking demon who trades human souls. She has a tail, wings, and horns, and can use spells. When living in the human world, these are hidden by a secret medicine and spells, but they appear when she's bathing or sleeping.\n: Her personality is more mischievous than innocent. Deceiving others is second nature to her (her main victim is ). She has no qualms about exposing herself in her underwear or even naked. She boldly showed her naked body upon their first meeting. However, she also has a timid side and is terribly afraid of ghosts. She even faints during a test of courage. She also doesn't seem to be very strong against tickling, as she laughed hysterically when restrained and tickled by  (mentioned later).\n: She transfers to the same Gokuraku Junior High as , disrupting his school life as well. However, she's an excellent student, ranking first in her grade in the midterm exams. Due to her beauty and talent, she gains considerable popularity within the school. Because of this, she causes and gets involved in trouble.\n: According to  (mentioned later), as a \"low-ranking demon, she's close to humans and easily affected by human emotions,\" and originally \"there were times when she strangely lacked malice for a demon,\" making her a very human-like existence.\n: Her three sizes are B85, W58, H85. Her nipple color is pink (according to her). Her maximum MP is 45. She has a habit of using spells anywhere and often runs out of magic power.

The \"evil soul\" passed down through generations of the Koinobori family is said to be as valuable as a supreme jewel in the demonic world, and this applies to  as well. He's troubled by 's ineptitude as an heir, so he hired and housed  as a perverted \"private tutor.\" Despite being extraordinarily lecherous, he never lays a hand on .\n: On the other hand, he's overprotective of his daughters, preventing any \"bugs\" from coming near them. He also has biased views (people who don't speak Japanese are Americans, he dislikes cats because he can't communicate with them, etc.).\n;\n: The eldest daughter of the Koinobori family. 24 years old. A high school teacher. However, she loves alcohol and cigarettes, and has gone drinking with her students and gotten them all drunk, making her an extremely problematic teacher.

Because of this, he held a grudge against  and engaged in voyeurism (under the guise of studying and to set her up). He has an anachronistic sense of style, wearing a rising sun headband and ninja attire. He took a picture of 's true form while she was bathing but was beaten up by yakuza members and had his photo confiscated. He tried to expose 's secret at the morning assembly the next day, but his memory had been lost due to shock.\n;\n: A student in a different class from  and . He shares the same birthday as . He's the grandson of the Kanekura Group president and the richest student in the school, with a monthly allowance of about 30 million yen.

After putting  to sleep with a sleeping pill, he tied her to an operating table in the basement in an X-shaped crucifixion. With  helpless due to lack of magic power, he unilaterally played a perverted doctor game, gradually cutting her dress with a scalpel, tracing and teasing her soft skin with the scalpel while stripping her naked, leaving her with only one pair of panties remaining. When  showed an angry expression at being toyed with, he fearlessly and teasingly tickled her side. This had a tremendous effect, with  shaking her head and begging for mercy, exhausting herself. After enjoying the tickling, he finally cut one side of her panties, bringing her one step away from complete nakedness and greatly humiliating her. However, just as he was about to finish, a drunken and transformed  burst in and knocked him out with one blow.\n;\n: Initially misunderstood to be in love with , she's actually a lesbian underclassman who harbors an admiration, akin to romantic feelings, for .

He was raised to be solely focused on studying, with a dream of becoming a politician. He was an honor student with a bob haircut, thick glasses, and always carrying reference books, but upon their reunion, he had become rebellious, growing into a full-fledged delinquent who loved cigarettes and women (the reason being his yakuza father doing as he pleased while forcing him to study constantly).

A few years prior to conceiving it, Togashi had created several one shots featured in the same magazine. Togashi produced manuscripts for Ten de Shōwaru Cupid within his Tokyo apartment when it started serialization during the summer of 1989. He began hiring assistants after the first few chapters of the manga's run. Togashi used his weekly messages to fans to recruit assistants by encouraging readers to send in their best work to his Shuiesha editor Toshinaga Takahashi. Togashi's younger brother, another prospective mangaka, would also help out occasionally. Towards the finale of its serialization, Togashi realized that there would not be enough chapters to fill the fourth and final  volume of manga and that it would be 50 to 100 pages too short. To remedy this, Shueisha included two of his earlier works: Sensē wa Toshishita!! and Jura no Miduki. In the last volume, Togashi also addressed plot holes, such as Ryuyi's middle school age or the fate of the characters Kakisugi and Kitou, by telling fans not to read too deeply into the story.\nYears after its conclusion, Togashi has admitted he considers Ten de Shōwaru Cupid a failure and that writing romantic comedy was beyond his capabilities. Having been given an opportunity to serialize his first major work within such a prominent publication, he was embarrassed that he found it so extremely difficult to produce it week after week. In addition, he felt intimidated by many of his more popular contemporaries within Weekly Shōnen Jump and that he was struggling to compete for the reader poll votes necessary to keep the series afloat. He eventually lost his desire to continue Ten de Shōwaru Cupid. After ending it in early 1990, Togashi was anxious and excited to begin working on another manga that better expressed his own interests. This came in the form of the supernatural, fighting manga series Yu Yu Hakusho, which began its serialization late that same year.\nPublication\nTen de Shōwaru Cupid was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from its 32nd issue in 1989 to its 13th issue in 1990. The chapters were collected into four  volumes between January and November 1990. A  re-release was published in three volumes from March 18 to May 19, 1994. Finally, a  (pocket) version was published in two volumes on November 15, 2002.\nChapters\n* 02.\n* 03.\n* 04.\n* 05.\n| ChapterListCol2 =\n* 06.\n* 07.\n* 08.\n* 09.\n| Title   =\n}}\n* 11.\n* 12.\n* 13.\n* 14.\n| ChapterListCol2 =\n* 15.\n* 16.\n* 17.\n* 18.\n| Title   =\n}}\n* 20.\n* 21.\n* 22.\n* 23.\n| ChapterListCol2 =\n* 24.\n* 25.\n* 26.\n* 27.\n| Title   =\n}}\n* 29.\n* 30.\n* 31.\n* 32.\n| ChapterListCol2 =\n*\n*\n*\n| Title   =\n}}\nReferences\nExternal links\n*"
