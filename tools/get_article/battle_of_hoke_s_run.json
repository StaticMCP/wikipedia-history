Notable as an early engagement of Confederate Colonel Thomas J. Jackson and his Brigade of Virginia Volunteers, nineteen days before their famous nickname would originate, this brief skirmish was hailed by both sides as a stern lesson to the other. Acting precisely upon the orders of a superior officer about how to operate in the face of superior numbers, Jackson's Confederate forces resisted General Robert Patterson's Union forces briefly and then slowly retreated over several miles.\nOpposing forces\nUnion order of battle\nThe Department of Pennsylvania represented the Union Army at the Battle of Hoke's Run during the outset of the American Civil War. Although the entire force crossed the Potomac River into Virginia, the First and Sixth Brigades were primarily engaged.\nMilitary rank\n* MG = Major General\n* BG = Brigadier General\n* Col = Colonel\n* Ltc = Lieutenant Colonel\n* Maj = Major\n* Cpt = Captain\nOther abbreviations\n* w = wounded\n* mw = mortally wounded\n* k = killed\n* c = captured\nDepartment of Pennsylvania\nMG Robert Patterson\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=30% | Division\n! width=30% | Brigade\n!

Robert Patterson's division crossed the Potomac River near Williamsport, Maryland and marched on the main road to Martinsburg. Near Hoke's Run, the Union brigades of Cols. John J. Abercrombie and George H. Thomas encountered regiments of Col. Thomas J. Jackson's Confederate brigade, driving them back slowly. Jackson accomplished his orders to delay the Federal advance, withdrawing before Patterson's larger force.\nCasualties\nEstimates of casualties sustained during the battle vary. The National Park Service quotes Union as 23 and Confederate as 91 (without differentiating types of casualties).  Kennedy cites 75 Union deaths and 25 Confederate deaths. In his Official Report, Major-General Robert Patterson states the number of Confederate deaths as \"over sixty\" but does not describe Union casualties. One Confederate battle flag was captured by the First Wisconsin, but the surrendering Confederate regiment is not identified.\nAfter the time for propagandizing the casualty figures ended, the following Union regiments precisely reported the sacrifices of their comrades-in-arms:\n:*First Wisconsin Infantry: 1 killed, 5 wounded, 1 captured.\n:*Eleventh Pennsylvania Infantry: 1 killed, 10 wounded, none captured.\n:*Fifteenth Pennsylvania Infantry: 1 wounded, 35 captured (six of whom died in Confederate prisons within nine months).\nIn addition to the above, \"The Official Records of the Union and Confederates Armies, 1861-1865\" and \"History of Pennsylvania volunteers, 1861-5\" state the following casualties:\n:*2nd US cavalry: 2 captured\n:*14th Pennsylvania: 12 Captured (the 1st Virginia Cavalry took 47 prisoners from the company A, 14th and company I, 15th Pennsylvania)\n:*McMullen's Rangers: 1 killed and 1 wounded (from the Sunbury American)\nTotal casualties for Union force: 3 killed, 17 wounded, and 50 captured\nFor the Confederacy:\n:*1st Virginia Cavalry: 2 killed and 1 wounded\n:*2nd Virginia Infantry: no record/report (casualties unknown)\n:*5th Virginia Infantry 9 killed and 11 wounded\nTotal casualties for Confederate force (incomplete): 11 killed, 12 wounded\nAftermath\nOn July 3, Patterson occupied Martinsburg, but made no further aggressive moves until July 15, when he marched to Bunker Hill. Instead of moving on Winchester, however, Patterson turned east to Charles Town and then withdrew to Harpers Ferry.\nPatterson's retrograde movement took pressure off Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and allowed Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's Army of the Shenandoah to march to support Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard at Manassas Junction.\n}}\nReferences\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121108185041/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/CWSII/WestVirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Greenbrier%20River%20to%20Kesslers%20Cross%20Lanes.pdf CWSAC Report Update and Resurvey: Individual Battlefield Profiles]\n* Gimbel, Gary. \"The End of Innocence: The Battle of Falling Waters\", in Blue & Gray, Volume XXII, issue 4 (Fall 2005).
