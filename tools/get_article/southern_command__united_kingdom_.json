By the 1830s the command included the counties of Kent and Sussex (the original Southern District during the Napoleonic Wars) as well as Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire (the original South Inland District) and Hampshire, Wiltshire and Dorset (the original South-West District) and Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire (the original Severn District).\nThe role of South-West District Commander, which was doubled hatted with that of Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth, was originally based at Government House in Grand Parade in Portsmouth. This building became very dilapidated and a new Government House was established in the High Street in Portsmouth in 1826. In January 1876 a ‘Mobilization Scheme for the forces in Great Britain and Ireland’ was published, with the ‘Active Army’ divided into eight army corps based on the District Commands. 5th Corps was to be formed within Southern Command, based at Salisbury. This scheme disappeared in 1881, when the districts were retitled ‘District Commands. A third Government House, which was built in red brick on Cambridge Road in Portsmouth, was completed in 1882.\nTwentieth century\nThe 1901 Army Estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on six regional commands. As outlined in a paper published in 1903, II Corps was to be formed in a reconstituted Southern Command, with HQ at Salisbury Plain. Lieutenant General Sir Evelyn Wood was appointed acting General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOCinC) of Southern Command on 1 October 1901. Southern Command was initially based at Tidworth Camp.\nFirst World War\nAt the end of 1914, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, the GOCinC, left Southern Command to form II Corps in France, and Lieutenant General William Campbell was placed in command. On 8 March 1916, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Sclater, took charge of Southern Command. Sclater served as GOC-in-C there until May 1919.\nSecond World War\nIn 1939 regular troops reporting to Southern Command included 1st Armoured Division, based at Andover, and 3rd Infantry Division, based at Bulford. Other Regular Troops reporting to Southern Command at war time included:\n*8th Royal Tank Regiment\n*9th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery\n*6/23 Field Battery, 12th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery\n*3rd Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery\n*4th Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery\n*1st Survey Regiment, Royal Artillery\n*2nd Survey Regiment, Royal Artillery\n*2nd Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery\nPost War\nThe command moved to Erskine Barracks near Fugglestone St Peter in Wiltshire in 1949. From 1955 to 1961 it included the TA 30th Anti-Aircraft Brigade with its headquarters at Edenbridge in Kent.\nIn 1968, a new command (Army Strategic Command) was formed at Erskine Barracks, largely staffed by the Southern Command personnel already based there. At the same time a new HQ Southern Command was established at Hounslow Barracks, into which was merged HQ Eastern Command (which was thence disestablished as a separate command). This new, expanded Southern Command, with geographical responsibility across the old Eastern and Southern command areas, was itself merged into HQ UK Land Forces (HQ UKLF) in 1972.\nFormation sign variants\nDuring the Second World War and after, Southern Command, in common with other UK Commands, used its formation sign as a badge, (or flash) on uniforms.  The HQ sign itself (see top of this article) with its horizontal red, black, red background colouring indicated an army level command, on which were five stars of the Southern Cross. Uniquely in Southern Command the background colour of the shield, and occasionally the stars, was changed to show the colours of the service corps of the personnel, other commands used their formation sign with an arm of service stripe ( thick) below it. The various designs and changes for visibility or similarity are shown below.\nFile:Southern command RAC.svg|Southern Command Royal Armoured Corps (Vertical red/yellow halves with white and red stars)\nFile:Southern command RA.svg|Southern Command Royal Regiment of Artillery (Vertical blue/red halves with white stars)\nFile:Southern command RE.svg|Southern Command Royal Engineers (Red with a blue diagonal line and white stars)\nFile:Southern command RCS.svg|Southern Command Royal Corps of Signals (Vertical blue/white halves with white and blue stars)\nFile:Southern command inf.svg|Southern Command Infantry (Red with white stars)\nFile:Southern command RAMC.svg|Southern Command Royal Army Medical Corps (Maroon with white stars)\nFile:Southern command RASC (1).svg|Southern Command Royal Army Service Corps (first pattern) (Yellow with white stars)\nSouthern-cmd-rasc-embroid.jpg|Southern Command Royal Army Service Corps (second pattern) (Vertical blue/yellow halves with white and blue stars)\nFile:Southern command RAOC (1).svg|Southern Command Royal Army Ordnance Corps (first pattern) (Blue with white stars)\nFile:Southern command RAOC (2).svg|Southern Command Royal Army Ordnance Corps (second pattern) (Red with a vertical blue stripe and white stars)\nFile:Southern command REME.svg|Southern Command Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (Three vertical red, yellow, blue stripes with blue vertical stars and two white outer stars)\nFile:Southern command CMP.svg|Southern Command Corps of Military Police (Vertical red/black halves with white stars)\nFile:Southern command RADC.svg|Southern Command Royal Army Dental Corps (Vertical green/white halves with white and green stars)\nFile:Southern command RAPC.svg|Southern Command Royal Army Pay Corps (Yellow with blue stars)\nFile:Southern command AEC (1).svg|Southern Command Army Education Corps (first pattern) (Light blue with white stars)\nFile:Southern command AEC (2).svg|Southern Command Army Education Corps (second pattern) (Dark blue with light blue stars)\nSouthern-cmd-pioneers-printed.jpg|Southern Command Royal Pioneer Corps (Vertical green/red halves with white stars)\nFile:Southern command IC.svg|Southern Command Intelligence Corps (Green with white stars)\nFile:Southern command APTC.svg|Southern Command Army Physical Training Corps (Black with red stars)\nFile:Southern command ATS.svg|Southern Command Auxiliary Territorial Service (Brown with a green border and light brown stars)\nFile:Southern command ACC.svg|Southern Command Army Catering Corps (Grey with yellow stars)\nFile:Southern command misc PW.svg|Southern Command miscellaneous units post WW2 (Black over red horiztontal split)\nGeneral Officers Commanding\nGOCs have included:\nGeneral Officer Commanding South-West District\n*1793–1796 Colonel Thomas Trigge\n*1796–1799 Lieutenant-General Cornelius Cuyler\n*February–June 1799 Major-General Thomas Murray\n*1799–1804 Major-General John Whitelocke\n*1804–1805 Colonel Hildebrand Oakes\n*June–December 1805 Major-General Hon.
