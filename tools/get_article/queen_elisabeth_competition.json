      "text": "# Queen Elisabeth Competition\n\nThe Queen Elisabeth Competition (, ) is an international competition for career-starting musicians held in Brussels. The competition is named after Queen Elisabeth of Belgium (1876–1965). It is a competition for classical violinists (since 1937), pianists (since 1938), singers (since 1988) and cellists (since 2017). It also used to hold international competitions for composers from 1953 to 2012. The Patron is Queen Mathilde of Belgium.\nSince its foundation it has been considered one of the most challenging and prestigious competitions for instrumentalists. In 1957 the Queen Elisabeth Competition was one of the founding members of the World Federation of International Music Competitions.\nHistory\nEugène Ysaÿe, Belgian concert violinist, wanted to set up an international music competition for young virtuosi showcasing their all-round skill, but died before he could do so. Queen Elisabeth, patroness of the arts and good friend of Ysaÿe, set up the competition in his memory in 1937. The prestige of Ysaÿe and Belgium's Royal Court (King Albert and Queen Elisabeth were admired heroes of the First World War) assured that the first competition would draw great entrants.\n1937–1950\nThe first two editions of the competition, in 1937 for violin and in 1938 for piano, were named after Ysaÿe. World War II and other impediments prevented the competition from taking place from 1940 to 1950.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n! 1937\n! 1938\n|-\n| Violin\n| X ||\n|-\n| Piano\n| || X\n|}\n1951–1986\nIn 1951, the competition was renamed for its patroness, Queen Elisabeth, and has taken place under that name since then. It is one of three musical institutions (the others being the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel and Antwerp Symphony Orchestra, residence orchestra of the Queen Elisabeth Hall) dedicated to the former Queen.\nEntrants are expected to learn a compulsory work written especially for the competition. (The work is picked during the composition competition.) Usually there is also a section where contestants are expected to perform a work by a Belgian composer. From 1963 to 1980, Marcel Poot of the Brussels Conservatory chaired the jury of the competition and wrote several commissioned works to mark the occasion, that were used as competition-required pieces.\nThe competition restarted with four-year cycles, starting with two consecutive years for violin and piano respectively, followed by a year for international composition competitions. The fourth year of each cycle had no competition. The years 1973 to 1974 were a transition to cycles with instrument competitions in even years, and the internationional composition competition in the year between the violin and the piano competitions, until the early 1980s when the cycles were re-arranged again.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Resources are varied: part of the funding for the prizes laureates receive is provided by public authorities and patrons, corporate sponsors, donors contributions, ticket and programme sales, advertising in the programmes and the sale of recordings. The Competition also benefits from the volunteer assistance of families who open their homes to candidates for the duration of the competition.\nPrizes for the laureates of the competition (amounts as awarded in the 2015 violin competition):\n* First prize, International Queen Elisabeth Grand Prize – Prize of the patron Queen (as of 2015: Queen Mathilde Prize): 25,000 euro, numerous concerts, recording on CD; for the violin competition also: loan of the 'Huggins' Stradivarius violin from the Nippon Music Foundation until the next violin competition.\n* Second Prize, Belgian Federal Government Prize: 20,000 euro, concerts, recording on CD\n* Third Prize, Count de Launoit Prize: 17,000 euro, concerts\n* Fourth Prize, Prize awarded alternately by each of the communities of Belgium (2015: awarded by the Government of the Federation Wallonia-Brussels): 12,500 euro, concerts\n* Fifth Prize, Brussels Capital Region Prize: 10,000 euro, concerts\n* Sixth Prize, City of Brussels Prize: 8,000 euro, concerts\n* For the other six laureates, sums donated by the Belgian National Lottery: 4,000 euro each\nLaureates\nCompetitions for performing musicians have 12 finalists performing as a soloist before a full symphonic orchestra. Originally and until 1993, all finalists became ranked laureates, later only the first six laureates were ranked. The first editions of the competition were dominated by candidates from the USSR: the 1937 violin competition was won by David Oistrakh and the next year Emil Gilels won the piano competition. The piano competition of 1952 and the violin competition of 1955 were the first to see winners from the United States. By the time of the 50th competition in 2012, an increasing number of Asian contestants reached the finals.\nSource.\nViolin\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\"\n! width=\"5%\"| Year\n! width=\"19%\"| 1st\n!

Broadcasting via television expanded in the 1960s. French-language and Dutch-language Belgian broadcasting organizations started to award prizes based on the preferences of their audiences from 1975 and 1991 respectively. Abdel Rahman El Bacha, Pierre-Alain Volondat, Severin von Eckardstein and Denis Kozhukhin were among the few contestants that were as convincing to the competition jury as to the general audience. Recorded performances were commercialised from 1967. In the 21st century recordings of the competitors' performances were streamed live on the internet and/or made available as video or audio downloads, followed by social media discussions.\nSee also\n* List of classical music competitions\n* Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel\n* Queen Fabiola Competition\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://concoursreineelisabeth.be/cgi?lg=en www.concoursreineelisabeth.be] – website of the Queen Elisabeth Competition\n* [https://perso.unamur.be/~jmlamber/re/ Data regarding competition finals collected by M-P & J-M Lambert]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170104151335/http://www.baranov.com/?page_id=29 Biography at Andrey Baranov website]"
