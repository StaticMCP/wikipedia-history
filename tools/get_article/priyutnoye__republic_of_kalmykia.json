It is located on the R216 highway,  southwest of the Kalmyk capital of Elista near the Nain Shara River, a tributary of the Manych River. In 2021, its population was 5,182 souls.\nAn 1848 imperial decree to create settled villages in ethnically Kalmyk areas led to the 1850 founding of a settlement of Russians near the lake of Amtya-Nur (, from the Kalmyk  Ämtä Nur, lit. \"sweet lake\"). Noted scientist Karl Ernst von Baer visited the area in 1856 and tried unsuccessfully to convince the inhabitants to move from the area due to lime concentrations in the lake.\nReferences"
