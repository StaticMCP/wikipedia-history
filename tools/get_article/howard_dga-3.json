Howard claimed that the aircraft was so fast from his use of \"Go Grease\".\nDesign and development\nThe DGA-3 was started as a side project based on getting the best performing aircraft using a Wright Gipsy engine Howard had available. The aircraft went from the drawing board to completion in eight months.\nThe fuselage was made of welded steel tubing with aircraft fabric covering. The control surfaces were wood with plywood covering. The cockpit was sized to an absolute minimum. The axle between wheels was shaped like an airfoil, producing some of the lift. In 1947, \"Pete\" was rebuilt as the \"Baker Special\" with a Continental engine for midget racing. The aircraft was rebuilt once again by the Experimental Aircraft Association founder Paul Poberezny as \"Little Audrey\". The aircraft was mounted with Luscombe wings and a Continental A-75.\nOperational history\n*1930 National Air Races – Howard flew five firsts and two third-place finishes at 163&nbsp;mph.\n*1930 Thompson Trophy race, third place.\n*1931 National Air Races – three second, one fourth, and one sixth-place finish.\n*1932 National Air Races – one second place at .\n*1933 Chicago Air Race – pilot Joe Jacobson flew to Two second and one fifth-place finish.\n*1933 International Air Race – one fourth, one fifth, and one sixth place with pilots Helen Lantz, Gordon Israel, and Art Gross.\n*1934 National Air Races – Joe Jacobson purchased and flew \"Pete\" to one fourth, and three fifth-place finishes at 159&nbsp;mph.\n*1935 National Air Races – One third and one fourth-place finish at 147&nbsp;mph.\n*1947 Goodyear races – As the \"Baker Special\" The aircraft was partially destroyed in a hangar fire after the races.\nIn 1953 \"Pete\" was rebuilt as a homebuilt sportsplane \"Little Audrey\". The aircraft flew until 1981. It was last owned and flown jointly by Victor Edwin Zinn and Walter Fritz who based the aircraft in Noblesville Indiana.  After being slightly damaged in a runaway airplane incident Zinn and Fritz, both active EAA members elected to donate the aircraft to the EAA museum.  It was once in the collection of the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum. A restoration was performed and the aircraft was donated to the EAA Airventure Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 1991.\nSpecifications (Howard DGA-3)\nSee also\nReferences"
