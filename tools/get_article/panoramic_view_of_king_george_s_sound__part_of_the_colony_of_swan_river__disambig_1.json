He was assigned to the Surveyor-General's department, and thus spent his four years in the colony exploring and surveying. He was the first European to cross the Darling Range, and was thus the European discoverer of the fertile Avon Valley.\nThe ''Panoramic View of King George's Sound'' originated with sketches made by Dale from the summit of Mount Clarence. As an experienced topographic surveyor and cartographer with military training in field sketching, Dale's sketches were a highly accurate and effective representation of the scene.\nIn 1833, Dale returned to London. Shortly afterwards he completed his sketches, and engaged publisher Robert Havell to have them made into a panorama. A prospectus was advertised, in which the project was dedicated to the Royal Geographical Society.\nAs it was Havell who arranged for the sketches to be etched, printed and hand-coloured, he is sometimes erroneously credited as the author.\nThe print\nThe panorama is  high and  long. It was printed in eight distinct panels, then hand-coloured, and the panels joined. The print presents a view from the summit of Mount Clarence. In the foreground is illustrated the granite outcrops characteristic of the geology of the region, and the distinctive plant genera, including Banksia, Zamia, Xanthorrhoea, Kingia and Nuytsia. The middle ground shows Indigenous Australians engaged in various cultural pursuits including hunting, fishing and possum hunting; also shown is Indigenous Australians in friendly conversation with white soldiers. Beyond this is a neatly laid out town site, being the present-day town of Albany. The background shows the major geographical and physical features, including Oyster Bay, King George Sound, Princess Royal Harbour, the Porongurup Range and the Stirling Range.\nGeorge Fletcher Moore saw a print of the panorama in 1835, remarking in his diary:\nJanda Gooding has analysed the subtext of the panorama. She argues that it \"present[s] a complex construct of race, place and local politics\" and \"maps out a series of relationships, including representations of racial superiority that support and enable British military, political, social and economic aims.\" Of particular importance is the way in which it depicts \"two cultures in harmony with each other and their environment\"; this would be reassuring to prospective British emigrants to the colony.\nThe accompanying pamphlet\nDale intended the panorama to be sold in a roll accompanied by an explanatory pamphlet entitled ''Descriptive account of the panoramic view, &c. of King George's Sound, and the adjacent country''. In addition to providing detailed information on the panorama, this pamphlet gave an account of the events leading up to the killing and beheading of the Indigenous warrior Yagan. Dale had brought Yagan's head to London, and had entered into an arrangement with Thomas Pettigrew whereby Pettigrew was given the exclusive right to exhibit the head at his parties. Pettigrew in turn displayed the head in front of a copy of Dale's panorama, and encouraged his guests to buy a panorama as a souvenir of their evening.\nThus, if Dale's panorama is intended to depict racial harmony, its purpose was contradicted by the accompanying pamphlet. It has been suggested that Dale included the information on Yagan in order to support his friend, Lieutenant-Governor Frederick Chidley Irwin, who had returned to London along with Dale in order to justify the killing of Yagan to his superiors.\n}}"
