Originally named ''Queen's Ferry'', the station had two lines running through it but the stretch was quadrupled in the late 19th century. At its peak there were four platforms although two platforms were removed long before closure.\nGoods services were halted 4 May 1964 and passenger services 14 February 1966. In the 1980s the number of tracks running through the abandoned site were reduced back down to two. Although most of the station building have gone one platform and the ticket office remain in situ.\nReferences\nFurther reading\n*\n}}"
