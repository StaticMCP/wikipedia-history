His poems were published in \"The Collected Poems of the First Ward Regent\", Ichijo Sessho Gyoshu, and in Hyakunin Isshu (poem No. 45). He was handsome and wise, and his personality was flashy.\nHe is also known as Kentoku-kō (謙徳公).\nCareer\nEmperor Murakami named Koretada conservator of Japanese poetry in 951.\nKoretada served as a minister during the reign of Emperor En'yū.\n* 7 March 970 (Tenroku 1, 27th day of the 1st month): Koretada is named udaijin.\n* 26 June 970 (Tenroku 1, 20th day of the 5th month): After the death of Fujiwara no Saneyori, Koretada is named sesshō (regent).\n* 22 November 971 (Tenroku 2, 2nd day of the 11th month): Koretada assumes the office of daijō daijin.\n* 23 January 972 (Tenroku 3, 5th day of the 1st month): The enthronement of Emperor En'yu is supervised by Koretada.\n* 9 December 972 (Tenroku 3, 1st day of the 11th month): Koretada died at age 49; and he was posthumously raised to first class rank.  He was granted the posthumous title of Mikawa-kō. His body was buried in Tenanji Temple.\nThe immediate consequence of Koretada's death was a period of intense rivalry between his brothers Kanemichi and Kaneie.\nGenealogy\nThis member of the Fujiwara clan was the son of Morosuke.  He was the oldest son; and became head of the Hokke branch of the clan after his uncle Saneyori died in 970.\nHe was born between Fujiwara no Morosuke and Fujiwara no Moriko.\nKoretada had four brothers: Kaneie, Kanemichi, Kinsue, and Tamemitsu.\nNotes\nReferences\n* Brinkley, Frank and Dairoku Kikuchi.
