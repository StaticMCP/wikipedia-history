Its  course drains a watershed of  and comprises challenging whitewater rapids popular with canoers and kayakers, as well as smooth water sections for tubing, and spots for sport fishing. Anglers hail some of those spots as among the best sport fishing in AL.\nThe Locust Fork River ranks in the top 2% of the nation's free flowing rivers with “outstandingly remarkable values” in all seven categories of the Nationwide Rivers Inventory of the National Park Service.\nThe Locust Fork is home to the nationally sanctioned annual Locust Fork Canoe and Kayak Races.\nIn the late 1980s, the Birmingham Water Works proposed damming the river as a source of drinking water.  When those plans became public, the  grass-roots Friends of the Locust Fork River formed to investigate. The group  held public meetings and suggested better sources of water for the metropolis.  Plans for the dam were finally suspended.\nHistory\nThe Locust Fork is an ancient river with a surprising history. The river and its tributaries have carved a path through the surrounding ridges of sandstone and chert at least a dozen times - geological evidence that this river is older than the hills through which it flows.\nThat geology demonstrates that across the millennia as the Appalachians and other uplifts of the land slowly took place, the river cut through.  Today it exhibits hairpin curves bordered by steep bluffs, called “entrenched meanders”. Together the river and ridges have created an array of habitats for a distinctively rich diversity of life.\nIn spite of threats, the Locust Fork remains free-flowing, preserving some of that rich bio-diversity, although human activity has caused many extinctions of rare and unusual species.\nThe river provided Native Americans ample food and shelter, resulting in abundant artifacts in the watershed.\nThe river's winding course caused the early white settlers to build many bridges, some of which survive from the past: Swann Covered Bridge, Horton Mill Covered Bridge, and Easley Covered Bridge.\nToday in Blount County, 115 bridges longer than 20 feet currently in operation cross the Locust Fork River.\nSettlers also built water-powered grain mills in almost every valley. Most of them are gone.\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [http://flfr.org Friends of the Locust Fork River] website\n* [https://www.discoveringalabama.org/uploads/1/0/3/2/103210354/locust_fork.pdf Discovering Alabama: Locust Fork]"
