However, Andrews was promoted to a series regular starting the tenth season.\nErik Kain of Forbes in the episode \"Bounty\" praised the development of Cooper Andrews and wrote: \"Jerry is wonderful. Cooper Andrews needs to do a movie with Jason Momoa where they're brothers who just chill and crack jokes and drink beer and maybe solve mysteries or save the world or something. I'd watch that movie.\"\nWriter for Comicbook Brandon Davis also praised Jerry's development and said: \"Jerry, played by Cooper Andrews, brought a layer of humor to the AMC series which fan have been unfamiliar with. After all, this is a show which earned its popularity on the mantra of, 'No one is safe.'\"\nNat Berman of TV Overmind also praised the character played by Andrews and wrote: \"If you are a fan of The Walking Dead, then you know that Cooper Andrews' character, Jerry, is a faithful steward to (the former) King Ezekiel, played by Khary Payton. The character played by Andrews brings a much-needed air of comic relief to a show that can be downright terrifying at times.\"\nDustin Rowles of Uproxx praised Andrews and wrote: \"The actor who plays The Walking Deads new best character is Cooper Andrews, and if he looks familiar, it's probably because you've seen Halt and Catch Fire, where he plays the similarly delightful Yo-Yo Engberk.\"\nReferences"
