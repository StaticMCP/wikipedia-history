The timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), and the India Meteorological Department (IMD), such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation's during the 2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season.\nDuring the year, 10&nbsp;tropical depressions, 4&nbsp;Cyclonic storms and 1&nbsp;Severe Cyclonic storm formed. The scope of this basin is north of the Equator and west of the Malaysian Peninsula. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) monitor tropical cyclones in this basin. This basin is divided into two different seas by the IMD; the Arabian Sea to the west of India, which is abbreviated as ARB by the IMD, and the Bay of Bengal to the east of India, which is abbreviated as BOB by the IMD.\nTimeline of storms\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20\nLegend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/04/2008 till:01/01/2009\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/04/2008\nColors     =\nid:canvas value:gray(0.88)\nid:GP     value:red\nid:TD   value:rgb(0,0.52,0.84)      legend:Depression_(31–50_km/h)\nid:DD     value:rgb(0.43,0.76,0.92)    legend:Deep_Depression_(51–62_km/h)\nid:TS     value:rgb(0.3,1,1)    legend:Cyclonic_Storm_(63–88_km/h)\nid:ST     value:rgb(0.75,1,0.75)        legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(89–117_km/h)\nid:VS     value:rgb(1,0.85,0.55)        legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(118–165_km/h)\nid:ES     value:rgb(1,0.45,0.54)    legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(166–220_km/h)\nid:SU     value:rgb(0.55,0.46,0.9)    legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_(≥221_km/h)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData =\nbarset:Hurricane\nbar:Month\nPlotData=\nbarset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\nfrom:27/04/2008 till:03/05/2008 color:ES text:Nargis (ES)\nfrom:05/06/2008 till:07/06/2008 color:TD text:ARB 01 (D)\nfrom:16/06/2008 till:18/06/2008 color:TD text:BOB 02 (D)\nfrom:09/08/2008 till:10/08/2008 color:TD text:BOB 03 (D)\nfrom:15/09/2008 till:19/09/2008 color:DD text:BOB 04 (DD)\nfrom:19/10/2008 till:23/10/2008 color:DD text:ARB 02 (DD)\nfrom:25/10/2008 till:27/10/2008 color:TS text:Rashmi (CS)\nfrom:11/11/2008 till:16/11/2008 color:TS text:Khai-Muk (CS)\nbarset:break\nfrom:25/11/2008 till:29/11/2008 color:TS text:Nisha (CS)\nfrom:03/12/2008 till:07/12/2008 color:DD text:BOB 08 (DD)\nbar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\nfrom:01/04/2008 till:01/05/2008 text:April\nfrom:01/05/2008 till:31/05/2008 text:May\nfrom:01/06/2008 till:01/07/2008 text:June\nfrom:01/07/2008 till:01/08/2008 text:July\nfrom:01/08/2008 till:01/09/2008 text:August\nfrom:01/09/2008 till:01/10/2008 text:September\nfrom:01/10/2008 till:01/11/2008 text:October\nfrom:01/11/2008 till:01/12/2008 text:November\nfrom:01/12/2008 till:01/01/2009 text:December\nApril\n;26 April\n:*18:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) &ndash; The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) reports that Tropical Depression 01B has formed roughly 765&nbsp;km (465&nbsp;mi) east of Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\n;27 April\n:*03:00&nbsp;UTC (8:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) &ndash; The India Meteorological Department (IMD) designates Tropical Depression 01B as a depression.\n:*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) &ndash; The IMD reports that Depression BOB 01 (01B), has intensified into a deep depression.\n:*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) &ndash; The JTWC reports that Tropical Depression 01B has intensified into a tropical storm.\n;28 April\n:*00:00&nbsp;UTC (5:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) &ndash; The IMD reports that Deep Depression BOB 01 (01B), has intensified into a cyclonic storm and names it \"Nargis\".\n:*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) &ndash; The JTWC reports that Tropical Storm Nargis (01B), has intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone.\n:*09:00&nbsp;UTC (2:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) &ndash; The IMD reports that Cyclonic Storm Nargis (01B), has intensified into a severe cyclonic storm.\n;29 April\n:*03:00&nbsp;UTC (8:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) &ndash; The IMD reports that Severe Cyclonic Storm Nargis (01B), has intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm.\n;30 April\n:*06:00&nbsp;UTC (11:30&nbsp;a.m. IST) &ndash; The JTWC reports that Tropical Cyclone Nargis (01B), has weakened into a tropical storm.\n:*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:30&nbsp;p.m. IST) &ndash; The JTWC reports that Tropical Storm Nargis (01B), has re-intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone.\nMay\nExtremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nargis (01B) approaching landfall on 2 May\n;1 May\n:*12:00&nbsp;UTC (5:30&nbsp;pm.
