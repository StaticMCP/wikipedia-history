It is a mystery novel set in the imaginary New England town of Wrightsville, US.\nPlot summary\nEllery Queen investigates a series of murders that seem to be related by an old rhyme: \"Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, ....\"\nLiterary significance and criticism\n\"The last full-fledged Wrightsville novel is as usual strong on characterizations.  But some of the deductions made from the clues seem more speculative than logical.\"\nFootnotes\nExternal links\n*[http://www.worlds-best-detective-crime-and-murder-mystery-books.com/ellery_queen.html \"Ellery Queen is the American detective story.\"]"
