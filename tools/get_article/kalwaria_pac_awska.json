It lies approximately  south-west of Fredropol,  south of Przemyśl, and  south-east of the regional capital Rzeszów.\nThe village took its name from the big calvary that arose in the XIVth century around the Orthodox Church of Simeon Stylites. After the region fell into the control of Poland, it was transformed and developed as a Catholic religious center by Andrzej Maksymilian Fredro and became a popular pilgrimage site. It has also a miraculous image of Our Lady.\nReferences"
