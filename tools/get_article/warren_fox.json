In regards to Lomas and Whittle's casting, a Hollyoaks spokesperson stated: \"We're delighted to welcome Ricky and Jamie to the Hollyoaks cast. Their characters are set to bring lots of drama to the show!\"\nFire stunt and fake death\nIn 2009, Lomas decided to quit the soap opera after three years. He said: \"I've had a fantastic three years at Hollyoaks but having fully explored the character, I felt the time was right for me to move on. I'm delighted to be going out as part of such a dramatic storyline and my final scenes are some of the most dramatic I've ever filmed. I'm sure viewers will be hooked!\"\nFollowing the announcement of Warren's return in October 2010, Lomas was asked if he thought the character  changed since his last appearance. He replied, \"I don't think you can really change a character like Warren. I think it would be a little boring if he came back as some sort of softie but, like I say, there are new people around now for him to bounce off.\"\nDuring an interview with Digital Spy, Lomas admitted he initially wanted to stay on the show for only two years: \"Well I wanted to go after two years. I sat down with Bryan Kirkwood who told me what he had in store and it was too good to refuse! The storyline was so fantastic.\" He later revealed how he felt about his final appearance, admitting: \"To be honest with you, when I knew I was filming my final scene – obviously I've spent three years of my life there and I've got lots of good friends there – I got really emotional. I had to take myself off and have a word with myself and say 'Come on – you need to pull it together!' It was great because all the producers came down and clapped me and bought me a bottle of champagne. It was very emotional.\"\nLomas was announced to return to Hollyoaks in October 2010 after the character was revealed to have survived the fire. Series producer Paul Marquess commented on Warren's return, saying: \"We were hopeful that Jamie's return would be the best-kept secret in soap history, but when Jamie arrived on set it proved impossible. When Warren Fox died in the Loft fire, we all thought that was the end of the dangerous gangster that terrorized the residents of Hollyoaks village. But when our writers made the shocking suggestion to bring back Warren in a juicy plot, it was just too irresistible to ignore as they not only made it feasible that Warren could have escaped the fire and fled the village, they created an explosive and very clever plot with lots of twists and turns that is guaranteed to have the audience hooked. When the idea was pitched to Jamie, he knew it was too good an opportunity to miss. Warren Fox was one of the soap's most memorable villains and we're very excited about his return.\" He returned on 29 October 2010. Lomas later expressed his feelings about returning, saying: \"I'm really excited. I got the call and I got told about the storyline and it was great – full of twists and turns. I kind of thought that my character had run his course with the other characters that were around before, but there's a new breed in now, so that means plenty of potential for Warren to come back in and cause some more mayhem.\" On-screen, flashback sequences were filmed to show how Warren survived the fire. Hollyoaks announced a special episode centered around Warren and how he survived the fire to be broadcast on 1 December 2010, shown to viewers in various flashbacks.\n2011 departure\nIn August 2011, it was announced that Lomas had decided to leave the serial once again, and he filmed his final scenes in October 2011. His departure was broadcast on 23 December 2011.\nReturns and departures\nIn March 2016, it was confirmed that Lomas had agreed to reprise his role as Warren.

In an attempt to leave the village with some money, Warren makes a deal with Justin to burn down The Loft for £5,000 so that he can claim the insurance money and Justin can get money to start a new life with Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby). Justin agrees and goes to meet Warren at The Loft, but is stopped by Calvin who tells him not to get involved with another of Warren's schemes. Justin changes his mind and leaves, only to be seen by Sasha. While waiting for Justin in the club, Warren is knocked out by Clare using a baseball bat. She tells him that both he and Justin have ruined her life and makes Warren call Justin to meet at The Loft. Calvin then arrives to speak to Warren and finds Warren tied up, Clare with a match and The Loft covered in petrol. He is about to call the police, but after Warren taunts Clare by saying that he always wins, Calvin backs off and leaves his fate in Clare's hands. Hannah arrives at The Loft to find Justin and Clare accidentally knocks her out. She wakes up and attacks Clare, who drops a match onto the bar, and the pair fall through the banister to the floor below unconscious. Justin enters The Loft through the upstairs door, where he finds Warren tied up. Justin asks him where Hannah is and Warren tells him that she is not there. Justin starts to untie him but he hears Hannah's calls for help and realizes that Warren lied. He leaves him in the fire and escapes with Hannah. Clare is nowhere to be seen and has escaped.

Warren reveals how he escaped the fire: days before the fire Warren meets a suicidal man named Dale Greer (Chris Geere). Dale and Warren bond and he begins working for him. When Clare starts the fire and Warren is apparently killed by the mirror, the floors collapsed and Warren is found by Dale in the cellar. After being rescued by Dale, Warren realizes everyone believes he is still in the club, and he kills Dale before putting his body in the cellar. Warren then threatens to kill Theresa, who witnesses him escaping if she tells anyone and then leaves the village. With Warren still threatening to push her, she admits she killed Calvin and they start a platonic relationship, in which they both protect the other's secret.\nWarren breaks into Chez Chez and tries to break the floor with a sledgehammer, but he is interrupted by Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). Brendan asks who Warren is, and he lies, saying that he is Cheryl's boyfriend before phoning Mandy for information about him. Warren enters The Dog to the surprise of local residents.

Brendan jumps to the wrong conclusions believing that Warren really killed Calvin and that Theresa is taking the blame for him. Brendan pretends to be Warren and encourages Kyle to seek revenge on Theresa.\nAlthough Warren is supposed to be with Cheryl, he cheats on her with Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton). Warren does not understand why she is interested in Brendan, not knowing their relationship is fake. Warren and Mitzeee almost sleep together but are stopped before they have chance when Cheryl walks in. Warren reassures Theresa when she hears that Kyle is still around, thinking that Brendan has ensured that Kyle took the money and ran. Warren becomes suspicious when Kyle comes to Chez Chez asking for Warren, and he later sees him talking to Brendan. Warren desperately persuades Theresa not to leave with her baby in fear of Kyle, but she leaves anyway. When Warren phones Theresa and Kyle answers, telling him that he is doing what they had arranged, Warren realizes that Brendan has been pretending to be him. At first Brendan refuses to tell Warren where Kyle has taken Theresa, but tells him when he realizes that Theresa and her baby, Kathleen-Angel, might die. Warren turns up and Kyle knocks him out. Warren regains consciousness afterwards and shoots Kyle in the back, not knowing that he is holding Kathleen-Angel, and Kyle falls down the lift shaft with her. Theresa is horrified and believes that Warren had been plotting with Kyle all along after what Kyle had said on the phone. Ethan, who had been pushed down the lift shaft by Kyle previously, helps Warren get Kathleen-Angel out but cannot get out himself. Warren urges Theresa to leave with Carmel and the baby but she goes back to save Ethan. She falls into the lift shaft while trying and forces Warren to save Ethan before she lets him save herself. He saves Ethan and then suddenly the lift plummets with Theresa still on top of it.\nAs Theresa fights for her life in the hospital, Carmel accuses Warren of being in love with Theresa. Warren makes sure Ethan stays quiet and Theresa thanks him. He then sleeps with Mitzeee before fighting with Brendan. They call a truce until Ste attacks Brendan with a baseball bat, which hospitalises him. Warren steals drugs from Brendan later that month and starts a relationship with Mitzeee.

Mitzeee leaves Warren, and he throws Mitzeee's clothes into the river in retaliation before threatening Ste and Cheryl.

Warren goes into denial, believing the claim to be either one of Brendan's games or a lie told to Joel by his mother, but Theresa convinces him to take a DNA test which confirms the claim. After this happens Brendan returns and he and Warren declare a truce but Warren tells Ethan he is going to kill Brendan and he wants an alibi from him.\nMitzeee and Brendan hatch a plan to get Warren out of the way by uncovering Louise's murder and getting him sent to prison.
