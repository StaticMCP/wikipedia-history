The park is a primary place of recreation for residents of Queensbridge Houses and has a riverfront promenade, baseball diamonds, running paths, lawns and areas for picnicking.\nHistory\nThe New York City government acquired the land on which Queensbridge Park lies in 1939, the same year the Queensbridge Houses across Vernon Boulevard opened. While New York City Housing Authority had jurisdiction over the land, it was operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the park was known as \"River Park\", in reference to the East River that runs next to it.\nDuring construction for the 63rd Street Tunnel, which was completed in 1989, a  combined ventilation structure and emergency exit was constructed in the park.\nIn 2014, a large seawall was constructed against the East River to protect against erosion. The project also created a  wide promenade which was named for longtime park advocate Elizabeth McQueen.\nIn 2019, the park was used in the filming of the film Clifford the Big Red Dog.\nToday\nQueensbridge Park is the venue for numerous summertime live concerts, with music ranging from R&B to Latin. It also serves as the home of the Queensbridge Little League.\nGallery\nFile:Queensbridge Park river view.jpg|View of East River\nFile:Queensbridge Park view of Queensboro Bridge.jpg|View of Queensboro Bridge\nFile:Queensbridge Park river walk.jpg|Walk along East River\nFile:Queensbridge Park grass field.jpg|Grass field\nFile:Queensbridge Park paths.jpg|Walking and cycle paths in the park\nFile:Queensbridge Park playground.jpg|Playground\nFile:Queensbridge Park cycle path.jpg|Cycle path outside the park\nFile:Queensbridge Park.jpg|Cercis canadensis in bloom\nFile:Queensbridge Park jeh.JPG|Aerial view with Ravenswood Generating Station\nReferences\nExternal links\n* [https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/queensbridgepark Queensbridge Park : NYC Parks]"
