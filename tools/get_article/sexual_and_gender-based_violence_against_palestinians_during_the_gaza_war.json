In February 2024, UN experts cited at least two cases of Palestinian women being raped by male Israeli soldiers. Palestinian boys and men have also been raped and subjected to torture, and in some cases, the impact of rape and torture has led to death of the victim.\nIn its June 2024 investigative report, the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory (CoI) concluded,\nThe frequency, prevalence and severity of sexual and gender-based crimes perpetrated against Palestinians since 7 October across the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) indicate that specific forms of Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) are part of Israeli Security Forces (ISF) operating procedures.\nIn August 2024, Israeli human rights organization, B'Tselem, released a report on systematic Israeli abuse, torture, sexual violence and rape of Palestinian detainees, calling the Israeli prison system a \"network of torture camps\". The report includes extensive testimonies from Palestinians. The Guardian also interviewed Palestinian detainees, and reported they \"back up [the] report by rights group B'Tselem, which says jails should now be labelled 'torture camps'.\"\nIn March 2025, the UN Human Rights Commission published a report on sexual and gender-based abuses perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people, which concluded that sexual abuse of Palestinians is \"committed either under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership.\" Acts of sexual violence such as compulsory nudity, rape threats and sexual assault \"comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians\", says the report, with Commission member Chris Sidoti adding that, \"Sexual violence is now so widespread that it can only be considered systematic. It's got beyond the level of random acts by rogue individuals.\"\nIn addition to concluding that Israel uses sexual violence to \"dominate and destroy the Palestinian people\", the report also lists several measures taken by Israel during the Gaza War, such as the bombing of Gaza's reproductive clinics and restrictions on the arrival of medical supplies, as genocidal acts aimed at destroying the reproductive rights of Palestinian women and preventing the birth of Palestinian babies.\nSexual abuse prior to 7 October\nClaims of torture, ill-treatment, and sexual violence against detained Palestinians by Israel, have been made before the 7 October attacks and invasion of Gaza, with documentation recorded by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) and Amnesty International. There have been extensive reports of sexual violence against both male and female detainees, including imprisoned Lebanese Amal leader Mustafa Dirani who sued Israel. A former official of the US State Department stated that his office had verified rape claims made by a Palestinian child. In a 2012 article entitled \"The Blot of a Light Cloud: Israeli Soldiers, Army, and Society in the Intifada\", Israeli academics (and former IDF soldiers) Nuphar Ishay-Krien and Yoel Elizur quoted another, anonymous soldier as saying that \"I have no problem with women. One threw a slipper at me, so I gave her a kick here (pointing to the groin), broke all this here. She can't have children today.\" In a 2024 Haaretz article, Yoel Elizur goes on to add that \"These soldiers were remorseless and did not report moral injury. Some of them were convicted by military courts. They felt bitter and betrayed.\"\nThe UN's Commission of Inquiry concludes in its June 2024 report that Israeli sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians precedes October 7 and arises out of the context of the occupation: \"SGBV constitutes a major element in the ill-treatment of Palestinians, intended to humiliate the community at large. This violence is intrinsically linked to the wider context of inequality and prolonged occupation, which have provided the conditions and the rationale for gender-based crimes, to further accentuate the subordination of the occupied people. The Commission notes that these crimes must be addressed by tackling their root.\"\nRape and sexual assault of women and girls\nOn 19 February 2024, a group of United Nations special rapporteurs released a report stating \"rights experts call for probe into violations against Palestinian women and girls.\" According to the report, there is evidence that during the Gaza war, Palestinian women and girls were subjected to wartime sexual violence. According to these reports, Palestinian women and girls were also subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the IDF, such as they were denied menstruation pads, food and medicine, and were severely beaten, raped, assaulted, threatened with rape and sexual violence, and subjected to multiple forms of sexual assaults. Palestinian women and girls were also stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army officers. OHCHR denounced that Israeli troops had photographed female detainees in “degrading circumstances” and that the photos had been uploaded online.\nThe UN report states, \"Palestinian women and girls in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual assault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army officers. At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly raped\". One of the special rapporteurs; Reem Alsalem, cautioned that the reservation in reporting sexual violence was common due to reprisal concerns. Alsalem stated that since the 7 October attacks, women and girls in Israeli detention had faced an increasingly permissive attitude by Israeli officials towards sexual assault. According to Middle East Eye, the phrase \"at least\" highlighted the fact that many occurrences remain unrecorded, as victims dread the stigma and repercussions associated with speaking out about sexual abuse in \"a patriarchal society reluctant to address such atrocities\".\nThe special rapporteurs have also raised concerns over a number of Palestinian women and children going missing, with reports of children being separated from their parents. In one instance a female infant was reportedly forcibly moved to Israel by the IDF. In response to the report, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State said, \"Civilians and detainees must be treated humanely, and in accordance with international humanitarian law.\" Physicians for Human Rights-Israel also described the sexual humiliation of detainees, including sexual insults and urination on prisoners.\nThe Associated Press in March 2024 reported on Palestinian women giving testimony about having been abused during their detention by Israel, one woman said that Israeli soldiers conducted strip searches, and during the detention, if \"we raised our heads or uttered any words, they beat us on the head [...] Loud music, shouting and intimidation — they wanted to humiliate us. We were handcuffed, blindfolded, and our feet were tied in chains\"; another woman alleged that an Israeli soldier smashed her face into a wall when she would not kiss the flag of Israel.\nA detailed and legally mandated June 2024 investigative report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory stated both Israel and Hamas had committed sexual violence and torture, along with intentional attacks on civilians. Regarding Israeli actions against Palestinians, the report concludes that sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) is deployed by Israeli forces and civilians against Palestinian women and men, throughout the occupied Palestinian territories. The report concludes that: \"The frequency, prevalence and severity of sexual and gender-based crimes perpetrated against Palestinians since 7 October across the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) indicate that specific forms of Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) are part of Israeli Security Forces (ISF) operating procedures.\"\nThe Commission's report was completed through the use of interviewing victims and witnesses along with a variety of other means, and Israel had previously announced its refusal to cooperate. The report indicates that sexual violence was used by the IDF to push the idea of \"the subordination of an occupied people\" in both Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nIn December 2024, dozens of Palestinian women and girls reported that sexual abuse were committed against them by Israeli forces during the storming of the Kamal Adwan hospital. They described being forced to undress, strip-searched and sexually harassed. Those who attempted to resist were \"brutally beaten\". One witness stated \"They told us they would film us to show [the world] that Hamas was using us as human shields. When we arrived, they dragged us by our hair across the schoolyard, forced us into toilets, and ordered us to undress\".\nIn March 2025, a report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, submitted to the Human Rights Council, detailed the systematic use of sexual and gender-based violence by Israeli Security Forces since October 2023. The report documented multiple instances of Israeli soldiers attempting to humiliate Palestinian women by wearing or posing with their underwear and sharing the images online, while referring to them as \"prostitutes\" and \"sluts.\" The Commission also detailed instances of sexual violence directed against Palestinian girls. Female prisoners were forced to pose in degrading circumstances, including in their underwear and in front of an Israeli flag, with the photos also circulated online. They were subjected to sexual assault, harassment, forced nudity, and threats of rape.\nSexual abuse, rape, and sexualized torture of boys and men\nIn March 2024, an investigation by The Independent based on indictments, autopsy reports and testimonies from detainees described abuses and torture of Palestinians in Israeli facilities, including torture, sexual violence, and rape with sharp objects.\nIn April 2024, a Palestinian prisoner released from the Sde Teiman detention camp described how guards used carrots and iron batons to rape prisoners.\nThe UN CoI report from June 2024 notes that \"Men and boys experienced specific persecutory acts, including sexual and gender-based violence amounting to torture and inhuman and cruel treatment.\" The report documented a \"significant increase\" in the frequency and severity of the sexual violence perpetrated by Israeli Security Forces, and linked this to an intent to humiliate and punish Palestinians.\nMany detained victims by IDF forces were allegedly interrogated or abused while either naked or partially dressed, while blindfolded and made to kneel or had their hands tied behind their backs. Others were forced to strip in public and walk while being sexually harassed, at times in front of their family members who were forced to watch. While both genders were forced to do this, men and boys were reportedly targeted specifically. In June 2024, men detained at the Sde Teiman detention camp stated Israeli forces had inserted \"hot metal sticks\" and \"electric sticks\" into their rectums, resulting in the death of at least one man. Sexual abuse and torture leading to death is also suspected in the case of Adnan al-Bursh, a Palestinian surgeon from Gaza who was arrested and killed in Israeli custody in the context of the war.\nIn June 2024, a Palestinian prisoner released from the Sde Teiman detention camp gave testimony that prisoners were raped by dogs.\nIn July 2024, Mohammed Arab, a journalist who was arrested in March while covering the Israeli siege of Al-Shifa Hospital, testified to his lawyer Khaled Mahajneh that he had witnessed systematic use of rape, sexual violence, torture and killing in the detention camp. One detainee \"was completely stripped and electrocuted, his genitals were yanked\". Arab also testified that Israeli guards sexually assaulted six prisoners with a stick in front of other detainees. As Mahajneh recounted: \"When he talked about rapes, I asked him, 'Muhammad, you're a journalist, are you sure about this?'\"...\"But he said he saw it with his own eyes, and that what he was telling me was only a small part of what was happening there.\"\nIn early August, Ibrahim Salem, who appeared in one of the first leaked photos from Sde Teiman, was released after being held there for 52 days without charge. He reported widespread torture, including by medical staff, as well as electrocution during interrogations, sexual abuse, constant beatings, forced stripping, genital grabbing, and frequent occurrences of rape committed by both male and female soldiers. Children were also subjected to rape. In one instance, a prisoner in his 40s was handcuffed and forced to bend over a desk while a female soldier inserted her fingers and other objects into his rectum. If the prisoner moved, a male soldier positioned in front of him would beat him and compel him to remain in that position. According to Salem, \"Most of the prisoners will come out with rectal injuries [caused by the sexual assault].\" In an interview with CNN, Salem stated that Palestinians were transported \"like animals\" to Israeli prisons on trucks, and described being hit in the genitals with metal detectors, as well as raped with a baton. Salem stated, \"You’re exposing your body to male and female soldiers who harass you and touch you with objects on your sensitive parts. They hit you on your butt, pull you by the hair, call you obscenities\".\nOn 5 August 2024, B'Tselem released a report on systematic Israeli abuse, torture, sexual violence and rape of Palestinian detainees: \"Welcome to Hell: The Israeli Prison System as a Network of Torture Camps\". The report includes extensive testimonies from Palestinians. The Guardian also interviewed Palestinian detainees, and reported they \"back up [the] report by rights group B’Tselem, which says jails should now be labelled ‘torture camps’.\" The report includes a testimony of a Palestinian former detainee from Hebron, in the occupied West Bank, identified as \"A. H.\", who describes an attempt by Israeli guards to rape him with a carrot. B'Tselemen introduces the testimony by noting that similar incidents were reported by other Palestinian detainees.\nTestimony from released Palestinian detainees collected by Channel 4 found \"shocking allegations of physical, psychological and sexual abuse\" committed by Israeli forces. In one testimony, a Palestinian victim of sexual violence recounts: \"When the female soldier grabbed me by the balls and penis, she wounded me with her nails, digging them into my penis. I started screaming and biting the wire.\"\nWalid Khalili, a paramedic and ambulance driver with the Palestinian Medical Relief Society who was detained in Sde Teiman, described severe mistreatment by Israeli soldiers. Detainees were forced to wear diapers, suspended from chains attached to metal handcuffs, and subjected to beatings. Khalili reported enduring electric shocks every other day, stress positions, cold water dousing, and torture during interrogations. He also received no medical care despite having broken ribs, witnessed a detainee's leg being amputated due to shackling, and saw another detainee die from what appeared to be cardiac arrest. After 20 days, Israeli forces transferred Khalili to a detention facility he identified as \"al-Naqab\" prison. During the transfer, he was cuffed, blindfolded, and said that soldiers threatened him with rape. At al-Naqab, Khalili encountered other sick and wounded detainees, including a man who was visibly \"bleeding from his bottom\". The man confided in Khalili, stating that before his detention, \"three soldiers took turns raping him with an M16 [assault rifle]. No one else knew, but he told me as a paramedic. He was terrified. His mental health was awful, he started talking to himself.\"\nIn October 2024, a UN commission stated that it had found thousands of adults and children detained in Gaza had been subjected to \"widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence.\" It described instances of rape and abuse of male prisoners by Israeli Security Forces, and asserted that such violence was institutionalized by Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.\nIn November 2024, Mohammed Arab, an Al-Araby TV correspondent detained in Ofer Prison after being transferred from Sde Teiman, detailed instances of sexual torture committed by Israeli guards, including prisoners being raped by dogs and hit on their genitals with electrical batons. In another instance, a prisoner was raped with the fire nozzle of a fire extinguisher, with guards emptying it inside him until he lost consciousness.\nIn January 2025, Israel refused a UN request from Pramila Patten, the UN's Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, to investigate claims of sexual violence by Israeli soldiers towards Palestinians in detention. Patten's office stated that they were told this refusal could lead to Israel being included in the UN's list of entities responsible for sexual violence in conflicts. Israeli women's rights groups shared the same concern.\nIn March 2025, a nurse who used to work at Al-Shifa hospital and was detained by Israeli forces in November 2023 testified at a UN public hearing about the treatment he suffered for months at the hands of Israeli officers. During his detention, he said he was forced to strip naked and was subjected to beatings and threats of rape. During an interrogation in January 2024, he was struck all over his body, including his genitals, and as a result, \"I was bleeding everywhere, I was bleeding from my penis, I was bleeding from my anus.\"\nAlso in March 2025, a UN report from the Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory accused the IDF of using sexual violence as a \"method of war\", stating that “Sexual and gender-based violence, including rape and violence to the genitals, were committed either under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel’s top civilian and military leadership”. The Commission stated that sexual assault, sexual harassment and forced public stripping and nudity were “standard operating procedure” of the Israeli Security Forces toward Palestinians.\nThe report also noted that Israeli soldiers photograph and disseminate online the abuses they commit against Palestinian men and boys \"to punish, humiliate and intimidate [them] into subjugation.\"\nIn August 2025, ABC News reported that in June 2025, two Palestinian teenage boys were taken by Israeli forces while walking to an aid distribution site in southern Gaza. According to the boys, they were sexually abused inside an unknown Israeli prison. One of them, a 17-year-old, stated that:\n}}\nLeaked video of gang rape\nIn late July 2024, a Palestinian prisoner in Sde Teiman was hospitalised with a ruptured bowel and a severe injury to his anus. He had also suffered from lung damage and broken ribs. A doctor from the detention camp reported that the prisoner sustained \"a ruptured bowel, severe injuries to his anus, lung damage, and broken ribs\".\nSubsequently, nine Israeli reservists, including a major, were arrested on suspicion they had sodomized him and suspicion of mistreating the detainee. Protestors, including Knesset members, broke into the base where the reservists were being detained, demanding their release.\nOn August 6 2024, Israel's Channel 12 broadcast a leaked surveillance video from Sde Teiman, which allegedly depicted Israeli soldiers gang-raping a Palestinian prisoner. Israeli lawmakers condemned the video leak, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling for an \"immediate criminal investigation\" to uncover the source of the leak, and describing the video as having \"hugely damaged Israel internationally\". UN special rapporteur on torture, Alice Jill Edwards, condemned the video and the surrounding case calling it \"particularly gruesome\" and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable. When asked directly about the video, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, stated that the US government was aware and had seen the video and had called for a full investigation as there should be zero tolerance for sexual abuse or rape of any detainee.\nNational Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir defended the brutality of Israeli soldiers, saying that any action in the name of the security of the state of Israel is permissible. Minister Smotrich, likewise, seemed more concerned with the \"crime\" of leaking the video than with the violent acts it revealed. Government ministers took part in the riots that broke in support of the detained soldiers. A UN Human Rights Commission report published in March 2025 adduced the support provided by Israeli ministers to the incriminated soldiers as an example of how sexual abuse of Palestinians is encouraged by \"top civilian and military leadership\" in Israel.\nExecution of women in Gaza\nOn 19 February 2024, a group of United Nations special rapporteurs reported on claims that Palestinian women and children were \"arbitrarily\" targeted and killed in Gaza. Some were killed while holding white pieces of cloth, seeking refuge or fleeing.\nSexual abuse in the Gaza Strip\nIn May 2024, a group of UN special rapporteurs condemned \"unacceptable\" sexual violence and enforced disappearances of women and children in Gaza, stating, \"We are appalled that women are being targeted by Israel with such vicious, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks\".\nThreats of rape and sexual violence\nPalestinian women in Gaza have alleged threats of rape and sexual violence by invading Israeli soldiers. Speaking to Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, one Palestinian woman, who was pregnant, described being forced to undress by an Israeli soldier, who threatened to rape her.\nMultiple Palestinian prisoners reported threats of rape following the outbreak of the war. One such woman, the journalist Lama Khater, reported threats of rape against female prisoners including herself: \"They threatened to rape me... It was clear the goal was to intimidate me.\" Israel denied the allegations and threatened to prosecute her lawyer for incitement. Another released Palestinian female prisoner made similar allegations.\nIn June 2025, several photos circulated in social media of allegedly showing coffee bags that were sent to IDF soldiers containing a message in Hebrew telling them to rape Palestinians 'with a rusty iron bar until there is blood coming.' The photos garnered support from Israelis online.\nDestruction of reproductive rights\nIn its March 2025 report on sexual and gender-based violence against the Palestinian people, the UN Human Rights Commission also examined Israeli attacks on medical facilities in the Gaza Strip, focusing in particular on an Israeli bombing in Gaza City in December 2023 against Al-Basma IVF Centre, the territory’s main in vitro fertilisation clinic. The commission concluded from a visual analysis of photos of the damage that the attack was consistent with Israeli artillery fire and that it was carried out intentionally. More than 4,000 embryos were destroyed in the bombing, as well as 1,000 sperm and egg samples. The report found that the attack amounted to \"two categories of genocidal acts in the Rome Statute and the Genocide Convention, including deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians and imposing measures intended to prevent births.\" Another form of attack on reproductive rights, listed by the Commission among the genocidal acts committed by Israel against the Palestinian people, is the blocking of medication for pregnancy, deliveries and neonatal care from the Gaza Strip.\nCoverage in media\nSocial media posts by IDF members\nVideos and pictures of Israeli soldiers going through Palestinian women's underwear in Gaza went viral, leading MIFTAH, a Palestinian women's advocacy organization, to state they showed \"depravity\". In one video, an IDF soldier records himself going through a Palestinian woman's wardrobe, including her underwear while making derogatory and sexist remarks about Arab women. Another image shows two male IDF troops, one wearing a Palestinian woman's bra while the other stands next to him groping the empty bra and sticking his tongue out, while another male IDF soldier is recorded detailing how he intends to bring back Palestinian women's belongings back to his girlfriend in Israel. A video was posted by an IDF soldier showing him sitting on top of a tank holding a female mannequin dressed in a black bra and helmet, stating \"I found a beautiful wife, serious relationship in Gaza, great woman.\"\nA UN Human Rights Office spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, called the postings \"...demeaning to Palestinian women, and all women.\" An assistant professor of law at Queen's University in Canada stated the posts violated article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which states all civilians are entitled to respect with women being especially protected against any attack on their honour.\nFalse report allegation\nOn 24 March 2024, Al Jazeera reported in its live blog on an allegation against the IDF of committing rape at Shifa Hospital. The story was based on a testimony from Jamila al-Hissi (also transliterated as Jamila Al-Hessi), a Gazan woman, who said she had seen IDF soldiers \"raping women then killing them and burning entire families alive.\" These reports quickly gained international attention and provoked widespread condemnation. However, it was subsequently reported that an investigation by Hamas determined that her allegations were false. Yasser Abuhilalah, a columnist and former director at Al Jazeera, said on social media that Hamas had found her allegation to be baseless. He added that \"the woman who spoke about rape justified her exaggeration and incorrect talk by saying that the goal was to arouse the nation’s fervor and brotherhood.\" In response the next day Al Jazeera first removed its video and later the content on its live blog.\nInternational reactions\nIn response to the UN report, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State said, \"Civilians and detainees must be treated humanely, and in accordance with international humanitarian law.\" The Palestinian Prisoner's Society has repeatedly stated that Palestinian men and women have been subjected to severe sexual assault, including attempted rape and violating strip searches. It cited video and dozens of testimonies documented by rights groups such as B'Tselem.\nOn 8 August 2024, the US and European Union denounced alleged sexual abuse and torture of Palestinian prisoners by Israeli troops. “The EU is gravely concerned by the allegations of human rights violations and abuses, including torture and sexual abuse of Palestinian detainees at the Sde Teiman military facility in Israel and elsewhere,” said Peter Stano, a spokesperson for the bloc’s diplomatic service. He also called on Israel to allow Red Cross humanitarian workers to visit prisons where Palestinians are held.\nU.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on August 7: \"We have seen the video, and reports of sexual abuse of detainees are horrific. There ought to be zero tolerance for sexual abuse, rape of any detainee, period.\" Miller further called on Israel to conduct a \"swift\" and \"full\" investigation of itself. Philip H. Gordon, the National Security Adviser to the U.S. vice president, called for an investigation of abuse in Israeli prisons, stating, \"Perpetrators of sexual violence everywhere must be held to account\".\nThe US said it could not independently confirm independently earlier reports of sexual abuse in the UN report from February, and Israel criticized the report as biased. Israel alleged that one of the report’s authors had rhetorically legitimized Hamas’s 7 October attack a few days prior to the UN panel, and that another had \"publicly doubted the testimonies of Israeli victims of gender-based and sexual violence.\" The Israeli mission to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland stated that \"Israel forcefully rejects the despicable and unfounded claims published today by a group of so-called U.N. experts\".\nIn an opinion piece in The New Arab, Maryam Aldossari criticized Western feminists' ignoring of Israel's sexual violence against Palestinians, stating, \"Remaining silent on one of the worst atrocities against women and children in our lifetime is indefensible.\" Alice Jill Edwards, the U.N. special rapporteur on torture, condemned the alleged sexual abuse of detainees at Sde Teiman detention camp, stating, \"There are no circumstances in which sexual torture or sexualised inhuman and degrading treatment can be justified\".\nSee also\n*Human rights violations against Palestinians by Israel\n*Mass detentions in the Gaza war\n*Sexual and gender-based violence in the October 7 attacks\n*Torture during the Gaza war\n*War crimes in the Gaza war\n*Women in the Gaza war\nReferences"
