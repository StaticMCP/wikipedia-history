In the , Collingwood Park had a population of 9,246 people.\nGeography\nCollingwood Park, a residential suburb, is  east of the Ipswich, next to the historic suburb of Redbank. Its eastern boundary is delineated by Goodna Creek and the western boundary by Six Mile Creek. Housing development began circa 1980 with the establishment of two HIA display villages. Redbank Plaza is a large shopping mall, located on the northern boundary of the suburb. The main thoroughfare is Collingwood Drive which runs south from the shopping centre.\nHistory\nPrior to the establishment of the suburb, in 1967, Westfalen No. 3 Colliery commenced mining under a mining lease and the land was mined for the next 7 years (until 1974). In 1976, part of the land above the mine was rezoned as residential land. This would become a problem by the 1980s when roads within the region were beginning to show signs of cracking.\nThe suburb was named and bounded on 28 August 1982.\nThroughout the 1980s, Collingwood Park was marketed as, \"The Dress Circle Suburb of Ipswich\". The suburb's name implied a \"leafy\" residential area which differentiated it from nearby Redbank, the site of several collieries and industries: a map, c.1940, showed the area as devoid of any development apart from a perimeter road.\nThe 13th Australian Scout Jamboree, (28 December 1982– 8 January 1983) was held within the suburb.\nCollingwood Park State School opened on 28 January 1986.\nWoodlinks State School opened on 1 January 2011.\nDemographics\nIn the , Collingwood Park had a population of 6,622 people, 50.6% female and 49.4% male.
