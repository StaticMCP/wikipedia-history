The street runs downhill from central Warsaw toward the Vistula River and connects ulica Świętokrzyska with the Świętokrzyski Bridge.\nThe street's name originates from a small dam () that once dammed a stream that formerly flowed along the course of the present street. The name was already mentioned as early as 1743, referring to embankments built along the Vistula River.\nIn 1965, the street, as part of Warsaw's urban layout, was entered into the register of historical monuments. Later, on January 15, 1975, a 42-meter-long footbridge over the street, designed by Łucja Bogaczyk and Zenon Franz, was opened for use.\nDescription\nin the background]]\nThe street begins at Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie Street in the Powiśle district.
