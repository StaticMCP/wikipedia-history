Butler High School opened in 1954. It was chosen in 1988 as the second high school in Jefferson County to offer the Traditional Program. In this program the standards of patriotism, morality, and personal integrity are stressed in a structured learning environment. The school has a strict dress code, discipline code, heterogeneous grouping, technology major, and college preparatory curriculum. It is the only school in JCPS to obtain and/or exceed its goal for CATS testing every year during the existence of the yearly examinations. They recently, in the 2009–2010 school year, added the Freshman Academy to their school. Within the next two or three years they plan on changing from the traditional semester to trimester schedule.\nIn 2009 it was a Host School for Superintendent Sheldon Burman's Superintendent's Student Advisory Council to discuss how JCPS can better prepare high schoolers for life after high school.\nButler Traditional won the Top School Award (WLKY's High School Cribs) in Kentuckiana from WLKY News 32 in 2007. It was also featured on WLKY High School Cribs again in 2009.\nSports\nNotable alumni and faculty\n* John Bell, Senator, Virginia General Assembly\n* Lance Burton, master magician\n* Adam Duvall, Major League Baseball outfielder\n* Terry Hall, women's basketball coach at University of Louisville and University of Kentucky\n* Adrienne Johnson, former WNBA player\n* Bryce Jones, television meteorologist at WDRB News\n* Jodie Mudd, former PGA golfer\n* Dale Romans, horse trainer (2011 Preakness winner)\n* John Wesley Shipp, television and movie actor\n* Chris Smith, Major League Baseball pitcher\n* Jordan Watkins, current NFL and former college football wide receiver\n* Jared Wolfe, Pro Golfer\nSee also\n* Public schools in Louisville, Kentucky\nReferences"
