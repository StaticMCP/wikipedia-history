The game takes inspiration from real events in the Myanmar Civil War. Ko Thoot further stated that the character artwork is based on a diverse range of real anti-junta fighters that include doctors, the LGBTQ community, Muslims and other groups.\nImpact and restrictions\nAccording to Ko Toot, War of Heroes raised approximately over $500,000 via revenue from in-game ads. The funds are then donated to PDF guerrillas.\nThe State Administration Council military junta banned the game on 24 April 2023; they claimed that the game slandered the Tatmadaw and encouraged sedition.\nInitially releasing as just The PDF Game, Apple removed it from the App Store, and claimed that the game violated its policy against games that “[target a] real world government, corporation, or any other real entity”. After changing the name to War of Heroes and amending the artwork, the game was reinstated.\nGoogle requested Ko Thoot to rename the game as they were concerned that the game violated guidelines against allowing games that “capitalise on or are insensitive toward a sensitive event” on Google Play. However, the game was ultimately left up after the name change as the moderators deemed that it “intends to alert users or to raise awareness” about the Myanmar Civil War.\nSee also\nEnd Game: Union Multiplayer- Multiplayer mobile game that has a similar Myanmar Civil War setting\nReferences"
