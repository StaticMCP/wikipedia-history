It was developed by Career Soft, and published in Japan by Atlus in 2006. Atlus USA published the game in North America on September 18, 2007, and Rising Star Games released it in Europe on June 13, 2008.\nGameplay\nThe game uses strategic party-based combat and has a player-manageable character ability tree. It uses hand drawn animation and character portraits by Satoshi Urushihara. It has the ability to cultivate intimate relationships with characters. Battles take place in real-time, and there is no transition to a separate battle map (which is usually found in traditional Japanese RPGs). As such the game forces players to come up with strategies and tactics immediately as the situation calls for it.\nPlot\nOnce, an isolated island continent was plunged into war. The people who wished to end the warring revived a powerful weapon called the \"Admonisher\" and threatened the participants of the war with it. Thus all of the wars were ended by force. The people behind this called themselves the \"Peace Maintenance Brigade\". 20 years later the old men of the Brigade are no longer able to maintain the peace.\nNow war has once again broken out among the inhabitants of the continent. A mysterious famine has appeared, leaving the citizens to fight over what little fertile land is left, while the cities are constantly attacked by fierce amphibious monsters known as \"Screapers\".[http://www.atlus.com/growlanser/ Official Growlanser: Heritage of War]\nCharacters\nSeldous: He sought to end war, and along with Isaac and help from others, they revived an ancient weapon called the Admonisher.
